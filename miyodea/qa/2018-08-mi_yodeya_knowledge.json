Someone I know commented on how I \"pronounced each word very clearly and didn't slur\" (in their own words), and I replied that I trained myself to do this years ago as I was told that it is commendable to pronounce each word carefully, making sure to enunciate each syllable and separate each word without slurring.</p>\n<p>It would be easy to say this is a good idea, because it aids in <em>kavana</em>, etc., but is there any source for that?</p>\n<p>(Please note that I am not discussing the \"correct\" <em>havarah</em> (pronunciation of Hebrew).

The conclusion there is that it is valid even if the words were not pronounced carefully. However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> rules (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=2&hilchos=6&perek=2&halocha=8&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Kerias Shema 2:8</a>) that lechatchila one should still try to pronounce the words carefully. Thus it would seem to be a worthy idea.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemara's discussion is only about Shema which is a Biblical obligation. One could argue that standard prayer, being only rabbinic, would have a lower threshold. Indeed, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Meir Simcha of Dvinsk</a> in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=8075&rid=478\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to the aforementioned ruling of Rambam</a> explains how the tanna derived this law from the verse that speaks about Shema. If that is the case then it would seem to be specifically for Shema where there is a Scriptural derivation, but not for general prayer where there is no Scriptural derivation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Ya'akov Emden</a>, <strong>yes</strong> (but that might not mean you have to do it).</p>\n<p>He considers \"systematic\" pronunciation and \"dialectal\" pronunciation (<em>havarah</em>?) inextricably linked. At the very beginning of the <em>Sulam Gadol</em> introduction to his <em>sidur</em>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42977&st=&pgnum=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the first <em>chavak</em></a> \"explains the quality of the proper pronunciation\". Relevant highlights include</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צריך להיות שלם בחיתוך השלון, כל מום לא יהיה בו - באות, בניקוד, בטעם.</p>\n<p>[One] must be complete in lingual precision, no blemish should be present - in letter, pointing, or accent. . .\nParticularly not reading 'ע's as 'א's. . . Unlike we Ashk'nazim do with the weak 'ת' which we shamefully read like a 'ס'. Though we do great with vowels, unlike the S'faradim that don't distinguish between <em>kamatz</em> and <em>patach</em>. . .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to encourage the prayer to differentiate between the various vowels which have a tendency to be conflated, as well as between the varieties of <em>sh'va</em>, not to join words across phrase breaks, to pause appropriately, and to emphasize the correct syllables. But he concludes with a mitigation, which might explain the disparity between viewpoints in the question's motivating anecdote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובמי שאפשר לו ויודע הדברים אמורים</p>\n<p>אבל מי שלא הגיע בידי מדה זו בנעורים</p>\n<p>א\"א להטריחו בהנחת הטעמים שטורחו רב ומייגע דבורו</p>\n<p>והפסדו מרובה משכרו</p>\n<p>לכן טוב שלא לבלבל הקורא אשר לא נסה באלה</p>\n<p>במטבע תפלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Paraphrasing, one who grew up learning these principles and internalizing them should implement them. But they are too burdensome to be taken on by those who didn't, so they are better off just leaving them alone.</p>\n<p><sub>The above quotes, as well as almost the entirety of the massive introduction to this <em>sidur</em>, are in rhyming couplets in the original.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who says the wicked are full of remorse? Help tracking down a supposed statement of Chazal\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One section of the Tanya is called Likutei Amarim. Chapter 11 of this section contains the statement “Concerning such a person, the Rabbis of blessed memory have said, “The wicked are full of remorse.”</p>\n\n<p>In the Bilingual edition of the Tanya, this sentence appears on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028910/jewish/Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">p. 45</a>. In the paper edition (but not in the online edition) it is marked with superscript 10. The related footnote 10 says “Nedarim 9b.”</p>\n\n<p>In Lessons in Tanya, this sentence appears in volume 1 on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7890/jewish/Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">p. 166</a>, and is marked with superscript 8. The related footnote 8 says “Nedarim 9b. (So cited in early sources, though not to be found in current editions of the Talmud).”</p>\n\n<p>This latter footnote is correct, at least as to the parenthetical part. Nedarim 9b does not contain the statement that the wicked are full of remorse.</p>\n\n<p>I searched at Hebrew Books for the statement that the wicked are full of remorse, and the only match I could find was the book Sadeh Tsoifim, which appears to be a commentary on the Talmud, and which contains <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37028&hilite=69b234fa-5461-470c-af8e-e3dc876dd1a3&st=%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the magic words</a>:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F1caF.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F1caF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I’m not totally clear on the meaning of that remark, it being abbreviated right out of my ken.</p>\n\n<p>At my shul we have a green dictionary of statements of Chazal, a dictionary which, unfortunately, I cannot describe more precisely right now. But I looked up the statement about the wicked, and the entry was almost exactly the footnote in Lessons in Tanya. It said that the statement was said to appear on Nedarim 9b in the book Shevet Mussar, but that it does not actually appear in the Talmud. <a href=\"http://www.chinuch.org/AdarI.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Apparently</a>, the book Shevet Mussar was written by the year 1729, the year when the author died, so (to paraphrase Dean Vernon Wormer) we know that he didn't copy from the Tanya.</p>\n\n<p>Can you explain this? Are there, or were there, editions of the Talmud containing the statement? Did it appear on p. 9 of Nedarim? The Tanya was published in 1796, so (to judge from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this Wikipedia article</a>) the author might have had a printed Talmud such as the Bomberg Talmud of 1523 or the Benveniste Talmud of 1645, but probably not the Slavuta Talmud of 1795 and certainly not the Vilna Talmud of 1835. (But of course he doesn’t actually say that the statement is in the Talmud, exactly.)</p>\n\n<p>Obviously we must all rely on books to tell us what the Rabbis said. But doesn't it seem strange that an author would attribute this expression to the Rabbis with no pre-18th-Century source for that attribution?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think this statement is a paraphrase of the following which does appear on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.9b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 9b</a> (translation and interpolation: R Steinsaltz)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה רבי יונה היינו טעמא כשהן תוהין נוזרין וכשהן מטמאין ורבין עליהן\n  ימי נזירות מתחרטין בהן ונמצאו מביאין חולין לעזרה</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yona said to him: This is the reason: When they regret their\n  misdeeds they become nazirites, and when they become ritually impure\n  and the days of their naziriteship are increased, as they must become\n  pure and then begin their terms of naziriteship again, they regret\n  having become nazirites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the wicked regret their misdeeds, then become nazirites, then regret it (because the term of their nazirut keeps increasing as they become ritually impure). Thus <strong>the wicked are full of remorse</strong>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>R Adin Steinsaltz has an excellent 3-volume commented edition of the Tanya. In the <a href=\"http://a.co/hhl54cO\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first volume</a>, p. 277, he explains this statement in the following way</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Such a person repeatedly sins and regrets, sing and regrets. Such regrets are a sign not of hypocrisy or self-deception but of the inner struggle between the two forces that dichotomize his inner self: his Godly and animal souls. The feelings of regret and the thoughts of repentance are not by chance or fluke but the reaction of the Godly soul to the triumphs of the animal soul. It is not arbitrary but inherently necessary that a Jew should experience remorse after he sins, because one part of his soul will never give him rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As I could understand of his letter and his works, there was a proto-Ashkenazi long <em>ō</em> for <em>cholam</em> that was affected over the centuries by different linguistic phenomena <em>(Great Yiddish Vowel Shift,</em> see pp. 71–73 <a href=\"http://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1993b.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and in his dissertation on pp. 77–81). First this resulted a vowel that he calls <em>ɔu<sub>42</sub>,</em> and it was further affected by the changes in the Yiddish language that they spoke (which was influenced by the German dialects of that era).</p>\n\n<p>The fate of this sound used for <em>cholam</em> was connected with the following long vowels and diphthongs that existed in the various German dialects (see pp. 51–52):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Vowel 22 (long): originally this was in Yiddish at ל<strong>יי</strong>ב, ב<strong>יי</strong>ז or ש<strong>יי</strong>ן (in German b<strong>ö</strong>se, L<strong>ö</strong>we and sch<strong>ö</strong>n)</li>\n<li>Vowel 42 (long): in Yiddish גר<strong>וי</strong>ס, בר<strong>וי</strong>ט or וו<strong>וי</strong>נען (in German Br<strong>o</strong>t, gr<strong>o</strong>ß and w<strong>o</strong>hnen)</li>\n<li>Vowel 24 (diphthong): in Yiddish  גל<strong>יי</strong>ב or קל<strong>יי</strong>ד (in German gl<strong>au</strong>ben and Kl<strong>ei</strong>d)</li>\n<li>Vowel 44 (diphthong): in Yiddish א<strong>וי</strong>ג, ב<strong>וי</strong>ם or ט<strong>וי</strong>ב (in German B<strong>au</strong>m, <strong>Au</strong>ge and <strong>tau</strong>b)</li>\n<li>Vowel 54 (diphthong): in Yiddish ה<strong>וי</strong>ז or ט<strong>וי</strong>ב (in German H<strong>au</strong>se and T<strong>au</strong>be).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ztvfP.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ztvfP.jpg\" alt=\"Geographic distribution of the Yiddish dialects\"></a></p>\n\n<p>In the areas, where the dialects of Western Yiddish were spoken (see the map on p. 1023 <a href=\"http://www.dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1983a.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>), <em>ɔu</em> was retained for <em>cholam</em> (the Yekkish <em>au</em> for vowel 54). In the intermediate areas <em>ɒj</em> was used (the Böhmen/Mähren/Ungarn <em>ay</em> for vowel 54). However, the speakers of Central Eastern and Southeastern Yiddish merged vowel 42/44/54 and created <em>ɔj</em> (the Galizianer <em>oy),</em> the thing you asked, which is also reflected in the current standard Yiddish orthography. On the other hand, the Northeastern dialect merged 22/24/42/44 (see p. 50), so for both <em>tzeirei</em> and <em>cholam</em> they used the same vowel (the Litvish <em>ey).</em></p>\n\n<p>For further questions – in this particular case – consult your local linguist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -7)\n\n<p>This phenomenon appears to be related to the fact that, at least in most Yiddish dialects, the cholem is almost always followed by a yud (except where the word is, e.g., of Hebrew origin, in which case it is still generally pronounced as if followed by a yud).  Considering that the communities who developed this pronunciation were exiled to specific European countries during specific (e.g. early Medieval) periods of European linguisitic development, it seems reasonable to speculate that the Yiddish (and correspondingly, the Hebrew) pronunciation was influenced by the phonemes used by the surrounding natives.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps at some point during the development of Yiddish, in European language(s) of the countries where the Jewish people were living, there was little use of the \"o\" sound except as an \"oy\".  As such, Yiddish may have developed to automatically conjoin the cholem and yud \"וי\".  This seems to have spilled over into Hebrew pronunciation as well.</p>\n\n\n",

And, at will, regurgitate the live animal (for example, a frog). </p>\n\n<p>The main question here is if a Jewish person could do such a thing with a living creature of some kind, that would be ordinarily absolutely forbidden. </p>\n\n<p>Points of clarification would be, what exactly defines a normal case of eating something not kosher, how does eating something alive play into this. </p>\n\n<p>The point of contention here is that one is not eating it at all, <em>or is he?</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>At the end of perek Gid Hanashe (103 IIRC) in Chullin, the gemara cites a question concerning what is considered eating. Do we say its the benefit of the throat or the digestion of the stomach? The gemara ends off seemingly holding that its the throat which determines eating. In fact the Rambam codifies this as halacha regarding eating food that was vomited out and eaten again.  It would seem just the fact of swallowing would be enough to make one liable, even though its regurgitated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Text of Rambam Maachalos Asuros 14:3 : כזית שאמרנו חוץ משל בין השינים\nאבל מה של בין החניכים מצטרף למה שבלע שהרי נהנה גרונו מכזית אפילו אכל\nכחצי זית והקיאו וחזר ואכל אותו חצי זית עצמו שהקיא חייב שאין החיוב אלא\nעל הנאת הגרון בכזית מדבר האסור:</p>\n<p>Translation (Chabad) : The measure of \"the size of an olive\" that we\nmentioned does not include what is between one's teeth. What is\nbetween one's gums, however, is included in what one swallows, for his\npalate benefited from an olive-sized portion of food.</p>\n<p>Even if one ate half of an olive-sized portion, vomited it, and then\nate the same portion that was half the size of an olive that he\nvomited, he is liable. For the liability is for the benefit one's\npalate receives from a forbidden substance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>While it's likely forbidden as <em>bal teshaktzu</em> (as noted by @mbloch) and as <em>tzaar balei chayim</em> (causing animal suffering), swallowing an animal whole would seem to be no more <em>derekh hanaathan</em> (in the way they are enjoyed) or <em>k'derech achila</em> (in the manner of eating) than is swallowing a pill, which is also not considered halachik eating (at least on a bibilical level). See e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De%27ah.155.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch YD 155:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בִּשְׁאָר אִסוּרִים מִתְרַפְּאִים בִּמְקוֹם סַכָּנָה, אֲפִלּוּ דֶּרֶךְ הֲנָאָתָן. וְשֶׁלֹּא בִּמְקוֹם סַכָּנָה, כְּדֶרֶךְ הֲנָאָתָן אָסוּר; שֶׁלֹּא כְּדֶרֶךְ הֲנָאָתָן, מֻתָּר, חוּץ מִכִּלְאֵי הַכֶּרֶם וּבָשָׂר בְּחָלָב שֶׁאֲסוּרִים אֲפִלּוּ שֶׁלֹּא כְּדֶרֶךְ הֲנָאָתָן אֶלָּא בִּמְקוֹם סַכָּנָה.</p>\n<p>With other forbidden (therapeutic food item) one can be healed when mortally (ill) even in the manner they are enjoyed (i.e. normal consumption).  And when there is no risk (of dying from the illness), it is forbidden (to partake of the forbidden therapeutic food item) in the way they are enjoyed, but it is permitted (to consume them in a manner that is) not the way that they are enjoyed, except for <em>kilei hakerem</em> (produce of forbidden vineyard mixing) and meat (cooked) in milk which are forbidden even not as they are enjoyed, except when in mortal danger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This halacha is referenced by kashruth agencies (such as the <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/medicine/452/a-kashrus-guide-to-medications-vitamins-and-nutritional-supplements/#fA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Star-K</a>) when allowing the swallowing of nonkosher medication:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Those listed above may take non-kosher medication shelo k’derech achila, in an uncommon way of eating, if a kosher alternative is not readily available. Items which are designed to be swallowed without chewing (caplets, swallow tablets, and even gelatin capsules), poor tasting chewable tablets, and poor tasting liquids have a shelo k’derech achila status. For example, if someone has the flu, and the only fever reducer available is a non-kosher gelatin capsule, one may swallow the product. Similarly, one may swallow Celebrex in a gelatin capsule or tablets containing chondroiton (derived from non-kosher bovine trachea cartilage) for chronic debilitating arthritis pain. However, under normal circumstances one may not take non-kosher products if it requires eating in a normal manner (e.g. non-kosher chewable tablets that taste good).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Considering that, as opposed to pleasant tasting, chewed food items, the surface of the skin of a live frog is unlikely to trigger a pleasurable gustative sensory response in the throat, it would seem swallowing even a dead frog whole, should not be considered halachik \"eating\".</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.torahbase.org/shelo-kderech-achila-5777/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>There is halacha of Bal Teshaktzu</strong> (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2012/06/disgusting-behavior/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) <strong>which prohibits from engaging in any activity that could be viewed as disgusting.</strong> For this reason, the Rema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 13:1</a>) forbids eating live animals which don't require <em>schechita</em>.

    "content": "# Source for Zohar quote about kiss\n\n## Frage\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"The Zohar states that a kiss is the merging of one breath with another. Love begins with physical attraction. Then, as lovers begin communication, they begin to speak. As they get closer, they stop speaking and are merely aware of each other's breath. Finally, they come still closer, and their communication becomes a kiss, at which point they are actually in physical contact. At this moment, in the kiss, they are aware of each other's life force. Kissing is thus a natural consequence of increased intimacy in speech. The two mouths come closer and closer and progress from speech, to breath, to the kiss. Thus, there are four levels in the intimacy of love: physical attraction, speech, breath, and the kiss. These same levels exist in the relationship of a person with the Divine.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Quotation from <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805210377\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Medidation: A Practical Guide</a> by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan (p. 139).</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know the source for this idea in the Zohar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>It's a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar_Chadash,_Shir_HaShirim.3?vhe=Zohar_Chadash&with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zohar</a> from the beginning of Shir Hashirim:</p>\n\n<p>אָמַר לֵיהּ הֵיאַךְ. אָמַר לֵיהּ, זֶה הַבָּא מִתּוֹךְ אַהֲבַת נְשִׁיקָה. הֵיאַךְ נְשִׁיקָה מֵאַהֲבָה אֵינוֹ אֶלָּא בַּפֶּה, וּמִתְחַבְּרָן רוּחַ בְּרוּחַ, וְכָל אֶחָד מֵהֶם כָּלוּל מִשְׁתֵּי רוּחוֹת, רוּחוֹ וְרוּחַ חֲבֵירוֹ, נִמְצְאוּ שְׁנֵיהֶם בְּאַרְבַּע רוּחוֹת. וְכָּל שֶׁכֵּן הַזָּכָר וְהַנְּקֵבָה בְּהִתְחַבְּרָם, שָׁם אַרְבַּע רוּחוֹת יַחַד. וְהַבֵּן הַבָּא מֵהֶם, זֶהוּ רוּחַ הַבָּא מֵאַרְבַּע רוּחוֹת. כְּמָא דְאַתְּ אָמֵר, מֵאַרְבַּע רוּחוֹת בֹּאִי הָרוּחַ, וְזֶהוּ רוּחַ שָׁלֵם.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, the connotation of the word moneh is that whatever is included in the set that is counted must be something respectable or important — something worth counting. In contrast, the word mispar also means “number,” but especially connotes the use of a number as a limit... For this reason the Aramaic word for a nation’s border is sfar (which limits a nation’s territorial domain), and the Aramaic word for barber is sapar (because by giving his client a haircut, he limits the growth of his hair). By this rubric, Rabbi Mecklenburg explains that Sefirat Ha’Omer uses the word sefirah because wording of that commandment reads: “Until the morrow of the seventh week you shall count.” The verb “to count” in this context is being limited to forty-nine days, so the word used is sefirah instead of moneh.</li>\n<li>Additionally, Rabbi Mecklenberg suggests that the counting of sefirah differs from the counting of moneh in that the latter is simply the counting of numbers, while the former denotes something extra deliberately done or required to mark each unit. Sefirah is not just a count of quantity, but a count of quality as well. The goal of a sefirah-type counting is not just to count the raw numbers, but to also qualitatively improve oneself, to cleanse oneself of impurities. He connects the word sefirah to the Hebrew word sapir (“sapphire” in English) in that sefirah cleanses a person, just as a precious gem is free from impurities.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>SOURCE: <em><a href=\"https://ohr.edu/this_week/whats_in_a_word/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What's in a Word?</a></em>, \"When Just Counting Doesn't Count\"</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, his chosen role is to channel midrashim in order to show how Chazal understood the pesukim, in a manner that is consistent and runs through the each pasuk in turn.</p>\n\n<p>Often, while doing this, he acts as a conduit for one primary midrashic source. (See <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2011/06/did-rashi-sin-in-saying.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here about Sifrei and a switch to Tanchuma</a> within sefer Bamidbar. <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2013/01/can-rashi-on-chumash-bring-pasuk.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or here</a>, where he channels Mechilta on sefer Shemot, even though it ends up like a position against halacha, of Bet Shammai against Bet Hillel.) Rashi's primary midrashic source for sefer Vayikra is Toras Kohanim, that is, the Sifra. While other sources are interjected, see the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9924/jewish/Chapter-23.htm#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">perek in full here at Chabad.org</a> with its repeated running references to Toras Kohanim.</p>\n\n<p>So it is not Rashi vs. Rambam as to the source pasuk.

    "content": "# Skipping the last verse in Aleinu\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was recently in Jerusalem for a period of time and while I was there, I would join a minyan at a nearby yeshiva for mincha every day. At the end of <em>mincha</em>, the person davening from the amud would conclude Aleinu by saying</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ככתוב בתורתך ה׳ ימלוך לעולם ועד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He would not say the second verse that is included in every siddur I have ever seen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונאמר והיה ה׳ למלך על כל הארך ביום ההוא יהיה ה׳ אחד ושמו אחד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Kaddish would begin immediately after he finished (i.e. there was no time for someone to have said the verse quietly before beginning kaddish). The shaliach tzibur was different every day, but they always followed this pattern. The siddur they were using was סדור כלילת יופי - אשכנז which does include the skipped verse.

But then again, we have electric lights nowadays which can also replace candles in times of need.

They became un-fit for use years ago, and I have since replaced them with a sturdier pair, B''H. They aren't vintage, but they have seen better days for sure (<em>peshutim</em> don't hold up well in day-to-day use). </p>\n\n<p>Understanding that they were a cheap pair, I was curious as to what the parchments looked like inside. I'd heard \"horror stories\" about cheap <em>tefillin</em>, and although I don't have the know-how to declare <em>tefillin</em> or <em>mezuzos</em> useable or not, I wasn't impressed with what I saw. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, when I opened up the <em>tefillin shel yad</em> and removed the parchment, something else fell out of the box. Upon inspection, I found that it was a small piece of cut <em>retzuah</em> (leather strap) that was stuffed in the compartment along with the parchment. I must say this was very unexpected.</p>\n\n<p>I have never heard of any custom of putting a piece of <em>retzuah</em> in with the parchment.  Why would there be a piece of <em>retzuah</em> in the compartment of the <em>tefillin shel yad</em> along with the parchment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It is filler material to prevent the parchment from turning or slipping down and it is not a good idea.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stam.net/about_me.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Yerachmiel Askotzky</a> in his book <a href=\"http://a.co/gZZ3cz8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tefillin and Mezuzos</a> writes (p. 89)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to some <em>poskim</em>, loose <em>klaf</em> or a piece of <em>retzuah</em> should\npreferably not be placed between a <em>parashah</em> [<em>klaf</em>] and the wall of the\n<em>bayit</em> to prevent it from turning or slipping down, as it will separate\nbetween the <em>parashah</em> and the majority of a wall or <em>shin</em>.</p>\n<p>Instead, the\n<em>matlit</em> (the piece of parchment or animal skin that serves inside the tefillin boxes as a protective covering over the <em>parshiot</em> of the <em>tefillin</em>) should be made very long so that the excess can be used\nto make an accordion that will hold it it place.</p>\n<p>Note: one cannot cut\npieces from a used <em>retzuah</em> to hold the <em>parashiot</em> in place within the\nbatim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I realize this is an old question, but it caught my eye and I have a different possible explanation. Are you sure that the piece of retzuah was actuality in the compartment with the klaf? The reason I ask is that the sofer I use puts a small piece of retzuah in the Ma'abarta (the area that the retzuah is passed through). He does this to hold the retzuah in place so the knot stays against the bayis (many will tie a piece of sinew through the Ma'abarta and around the knot to achieve the same goal). It's possible that in your case this is where the piece fell from when you opened it, as opposed to from inside the bayis itself.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who is worried about affecting a refrigerator's thermostat on shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When one opens a refrigerator door, there are two classes of effects:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Immediate result - e.g. light going on, or in newer models a fan might start.</p>\n\n<p>This class of effects can normally be fairly easily circumvented on shabbat by removing the light-bulb and/or ensuring the sensor which checks whether or not the door is closed is continually activated for the whole of shabbat (e.g. by using tape or magnets).</p></li>\n<li><p>Eventual response - opening the door allows warm air to enter, which will affect the refrigerator's thermostat, and, eventually, trigger the motor to cool down the refrigerator.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/?CategoryID=250&ArticleID=901\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> from Machon Zomet, they write that their approach is not to worry about this second class of effects, because many <em>poskim</em>, most prominently R. Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, were not concerned about the indirect effect on the thermostat.</p>\n\n<p>However, they note at the end of the article that there do exist refrigerators with a 'mehadrin shabbat mode', whose purpose is to neutralize the effect of opening the door on the thermostat, and that they define the use of such models as a <em>chumrah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>With whose opinion are these 'mehadrin' refrigerators attempting to comply?</p>\n\n<p>Please cite sources from Rabbis or <em>poskim</em> who either forbid or discourage opening a refrigerator door due to the affect on the thermostat. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R Howard Jachter wrote <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/opening-refrigerators-on-shabbat-by-rabbi-howard-jachter?rq=%22Opening%20Refrigerators%20on%20Shabbat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> a long article on the topic -- find a summary below with light edits. To immediately answer the question of those who rule more strictly he cites R Tzvi Pesach Frank, R Mordechai Yaakov Breish & R Yitzchak Yaakov Weiss and those who recommend that one to be strict if possible: Rav Yosef Henkin and Rav Ovadia Yosef.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach rules that it is entirely permissible to\n  open a fridge door when the motor is not running.  In fact, he writes\n  that it is not right to be strict on this matter, as it will lead one\n  to limit his Oneg Shabbat, enjoyment of Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>His reasoning is based on the fact that opening up the door will not\n  immediately lead to turning on the motor. The inevitable time delay\n  between the opening of the door and causing the motor to go on leads\n  Rav Shlomo Zalman to classify this as a \"Grama\" - \"Koach Sheini\"\n  (indirect action).</p>\n  \n  <p>Now the Rama (334:22 and see Biur Halacha ad. locum. s.v. D'Gram\n  Kibui) rules that Grama is permitted only in situations of great need.\n  Rav Shlomo Zalman asserts, however, that since one's intention is\n  merely to open the door and not to turn on the refrigerator's motor,\n  Grama would be permissible in all situations even absent any\n  unconventional needs.  Moreover, he writes that since he is only\n  causing the motor to go on earlier than it would have gone on without\n  his opening the refrigerator door, (also see Minchat Shlomo 91:10) one\n  may treat the act of opening of the door even more leniently than\n  Grama. Thus, opening the refrigerator door would be permissible in all\n  situations.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many poskim concur with Rav Shlomo Zalman's lenient approach. Indeed,\n  Rav Aharon Lichtenstein told this author that Rav Soloveitchik agreed\n  with the lenient approach. Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe O.C IV:\n  74- Bishul -28) seems to fully accept Rav Shlomo Zalman's ruling (also\n  see Igrot Moshe O.C. 2:68)- as does Rav Eliezer Waldenburg (Tzitz\n  Eliezer 8:12 and 12:92). (See Encyclopedia Talmudit 18:663 note 13.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Many eminent authorities, on the other hand, either rule strictly (Har\n  Zvi O.C. I:151; Chelkat Yaakov 3:179; and Minchat Yitzchak 2:16) or at\n  the least recommend that one to be strict if possible (Rav Yosef\n  Henkin, Eidut L'Yisrael p. 122; Rav Ovadia Yosef, Yabia Omer I:O.C.\n  27).  The problem is that once an action is performed routinely it\n  cannot be classified merely as  Grama (see Shabbat 120b and Rabbeinu\n  Chananeil ad. loc. s.v. Rav Ashi and Bava Kama 60a and Rosh Bava Kama\n  6:11). Rav Shlomo Zalman responds that this applies only when one\n  intends to create the resultant action. When opening the door one does\n  not intend to turn on the motor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Yair Hoffman writes <a href=\"http://www.5tjt.com/is-your-fridge-kosher/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that the answer changes over time as refrigerator technology evolves and brings additional views of whose who disagreed with RSZA</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>Rav Eliyahu Henkin, zt’l, ruled that one can only open the\n  refrigerator when the compressor is on and it is forbidden to do so\n  when the compressor is off</li>\n  <li>This was also the view of Rav Elyashiv,\n  zt’l, as cited in Mitbach K’halacha, page 303</li>\n  <li>The Chazon Ish ruled\n  that it is forbidden to open the refrigerator at all, whether the\n  compressor is on or off. (Cited in HaPardes, Cheshvan 5719/1958)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes that issues are actually becoming more complicated with modern refrigerators and brings additional poskim being concerned</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><p>Rav Hershel Schachter holds that recording the information on a computer [as is done in modern fridges] would under many circumstances\n  at least be considered ksiva miderabanan. He also feels that there may\n  be issues of davar shemiskaven–the person intends for it to happen\n  since it is beneficial for him–even on a rabbinic violation.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Rabbi Eli Gersten of the OU stated that Rav Yisroel Belsky pushed to have timers on refrigerators. He told Rabbi Gersten that his\n  grandfather, Rav Wilhelm, used to sell timers in his hardware\n  store–they called it “the Rav Henkin switch.” Rabbi Gersten also\n  stated that Rav Belsky used the language of “chashashos,” concerns, of\n  a Torah prohibition. Rabbi Gersten further stated that when one student from Yeshiva Torah\n  Vodaath (who accompanied Rav Belsky at the OU on Thursdays when he\n  came to rule on questions) expressed grave concerns after purchasing a\n  new refrigerator, he said, “Look, until a timer comes out, just open\n  it with a shinui. When the timer comes out, purchase it.”</p></li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/kosher-appliances/464/keeping-your-cool/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> from Star-K and <a href=\"http://www.shabes.net/shabat-files/alonim/mekarerim-eng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for additional concerns.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>SEE <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/blog/news/ou-endorsed-ge-shabbos-keeper-the-ultimate-shabbos-refrigerator-solution/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HERE</a> for full source article.</p>\n\n<p>I will quote some of the points (from the article) relevant to your question:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Most of today’s refrigerators include a multitude of systems and sensors that regulate a variety of functions.</strong> \nElectronic counters and sensors regularly monitor refrigerator moisture and temperature levels, while these and other instruments determine when other systems, such as the auto-defrost heating element turns on and off.</p>\n\n<p>According to Darin Franks, Chief Engineer at General Electric, today’s refrigerators have “as many as seven or eight computers onboard.” <strong>Many compressors run periodically, or continually but at variant power levels, and are often affected directly by each and every opening or closing of the fridge door\".</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Switches that could once be circumvented before Shabbat are now commonly replaced by sensors that cannot be avoided.</strong></p>\n\n<p>SEE <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=253&ArticleID=143\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MECHON TZOMET SITE</a> for a comprehensive article on the subject of opening Refrigeraters.</p>\n\n<p>I will quote one paragraph which will point out the major issue of modsesrsn refrigeraters and Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p><strong>E. \"Digital\" refrigerators are not recommended for use! They have a minicomputer. Opening the door starts a timer that sounds a buzzer if the door is not closed within two minutes. They also often have an electronic display which is directly influenced by the opening of the door. Disconnecting the display or any other signal light or buzzer does not solve the problem of the electronic mechanism, which continues to send the information to the computer whether the buzzer sounds or not.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>This means that not only according to \"stricter Poskim\" but even according to Mechon Tzomet, who are generally known as less strict in many areas, there is still a problem involved.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Most of the discussion among the poskim in the past was concerning the old models which did not have all these sensorss, and the issue was only about the thermostat. Today the issue is much more serious, as the resulting changes are DIRECTLY affected by the opening of the door.</p>\n\n\n",

This is why we can make kiddush multiple times on shabbat morning. Artscroll notes on this that <em>arvut</em> only works if the person repeating the blessing was himself obligated. That is not the case with mezuza where you were never obligated in your neighbor's mezuza to start with. In other words <em>arvut</em> <strong>allows</strong> you to repeat a blessing you had to say for yourself, it doesn't per se obligates you to say it (as in your question).</p>\n\n<p>The second mention in the gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.39a.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shevuot 39a</a>) explains the verse \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.26.37?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And a man will stumble over his brother</a> (Lev 26:37)\" as meaning that all Jews are responsible for one another and will be punished one for the other but limits it to a case where people could have protested and prevented the individual from sinning but they did not protest.</p>\n\n<p>So perhaps one can learn from these two passages the parameters and limits of <em>arvut</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>one <strong>can</strong> say a blessing on behalf of someone when one is obligated</li>\n<li>one should protest (or <strong>kindly suggest</strong>) to his neighbor to put on a mezuza</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But none of these sources obligates us to do something we are not obligated in on behalf of our neighbor.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly the idea that one regularly puts on a mezuza for his neighbor is explicitly codified in halacha and the language of the blessing is different whether you do it for yourself (\"<em>likboa mezuza</em>\") or for your neighbor (\"<em>al kviat mezuza</em>\") - see Rambam MT <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Blessings.11.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brakhot 11:13</a> or <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/07-10-13/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pninei Halakha</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rema at the end of Yoreh Deah, siman 334, writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אף על פי שחייב אדם למחות בעוברי עבירה וכל מי שאינו מוחה ובידו למחות\n  נתפס באותו עון, מכל מקום אין אדם חייב להוציא ממונו על זה, ולכן נהגו להקל\n  מלמחות בעוברי עבירה שיש לחוש שיהיו עומדין על גופינו ומאודנו (מהרי\"ו\n  סימן קנ\"ז)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, according to the Rema, the obligation of tochechah does not require spending one's money. The Pri Megadim in his Teivas Gomeh, cited by the Pischei Teshuvah in Yoreh Deah 157, maintains that the Rema is discussing only a case of potential danger; according to the Pri Megadim, one would be obligated to spend a fifth of his wealth in order to fulfill the mitzvah of tochechah (and perhaps all his wealth to prevent violation of a <em>lo sa'aseh</em>). However, the Pischei Teshuvah points out that the language of Rema cited above does not sound this way. </p>\n\n<p>This is the teshuvah of Mahari Weil that Rema cites: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב טוב לאהו' מהר\"ר מיישטרלין י\"ץ מה שכתב מר אהא דאמרו רבותי' כל שיש\n  בידו למחות כו' ואינו מוחה שאלת טעמא מאי איך אנו יוצאים ידי חובותינו\n  שאין אנו מוחי'? כיון שרבו פרצי עמינו המלעיגין ומלעיבין בתורה ובלומדיה\n  ואינם שומעי' למוכיחי' אם היינו מוחים בידם איכא למיחש לסכנה שהיו עומדי'\n  עלינו על גופינו ועל מאודינו. והא דאמר מי שיש בידו למחות ואינו מוחה כו'\n  היינו היכא דליכא סכנה. וכה\"ג אמרינן פרק עשרה יוחסים ובדקו עד לסכנה\n  ופירשו. ומה שכתבת אם חייב אדם להוציא ממון על זה נראה דאינו חייב וראייה\n  מדאמרינן פרק בן סורר דילפינן מלא תעמוד על דם רעך דחייב להציל חבירו\n  ומקשה תלמודא האי מהכא נפקא מהתם נפקא אבידת גופו מניין תלמוד לומר\n  והשבותו לו ומשני אי מהתם ה\"א ה\"מ בנפשיה אבל למיטרח ואגורי לא קמ\"ל.\n  אלמא אי ליכא קרא יתיר' לא הוה אמרינן שמחוייב להוציא ממון אפילו להציל\n  נפש חבירו. וכ\"ש הכא גבי עשה דתוכיח דאין חייב להוציא ממון. ועוד\n  מדאיצטריך קרא לכתוב בכל מאודך שחייב אדם למסור כל ממונו בשביל קידוש השם\n  ואם היה חייב להוציא ממון להציל חבירו מן העבירה אם כן כ\"ש עצמו ואם כן\n  מאי איצטריך בכל מאודך? ודוחק לומר דהתם איירי דחייב למסור כל ממונו אבל\n  הכא גבי עשה דתוכיח אינו חייב למסור כל ממונו רק מקצת דא\"כ מה שיעור יש\n  בדבר? דבשלמא גבי הכאה עד שיכנו כל דהו אין צריך להוכיחו יותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The question hinges on first understanding the meaning of the saying, \"כל ישראל ערבים זה בזה\", to which Alshich on Devarim 29:9:4 says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוד יתכן על פי דרך זה באומר כל איש ישראל פירש ענין היות כלם צדיקים והוא <strong>כי ישראל נקרא גוי אחד ונפש אחד</strong> כמה דאת אמר שבעים נפש שהוא להיותם משורש הקדושה שהיא אחדות שלימה <strong>ועל כן ישראל ערבים זה לזה יחשבו כל איש ואיש מישראל כאשר אחד מגוף שלם וכל הכללות כגוף מקובץ מאברים רבים ונפשותם כנפש א' המחיה את כלם יחד</strong> והנה בהיות קצת ישראל צדיקים ונמצאו בעמנו רשעים בטל האחדות כי הלא אם עיקר אילן שיש לו ענפים רבים עם שראש העליון מהענפים נפרד זה מזה הלא יחשבו כל הענפים אחד מפאת חבור שרשי כל הענפים בעיקר האילן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although the Jewish people are comprised of individuals like other nations, they have an additional state of being that the nations do not possess. Like HaShem, the Jewish people are one. And that is the meaning of כל ישראל ערבים זה לזה. The individual Jews are a mixture that makes up a single being.</p>\n\n<p>An individual has a responsibility to safeguard their own life. And in the same way, the Torah commands each of us to be proactive in safeguarding the lives of our fellow Jews, like is seen in VaYikra 19:16 and Sanhedrin 73a.</p>\n\n<p>One of the ways we safeguard our own lives is through having kosher mezuzot in our homes. And so, one has a responsibility, when possible, to safeguard his Jewish neighbors life if it is at risk. This includes mezuzot.</p>\n\n<p>And that is the foundation of the Lubavitcher Rebbe’s <em>Mezuzah Campaign</em>, like is found <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2593497/jewish/The-Mezuzah-Campaign.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. The article paraphrases the words of the Rebbe in his talks at the time that he was pushing the campaign which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the Shema it says that fulfilling the mitzvah of mezuzah “assures long life for you and your children.” In other words, <strong><em>a mezuzah protects the Jewish person and home even when its inhabitants are not at home.</em></strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Someone informed the Rebbe that twenty-one mezuzos in the school\n  premises were later found to be not kosher – corresponding to the\n  exact number of students murdered. In the home of the massacred\n  family, every mezuzah was invalid.</p>\n  \n  <p>[The Rebbe explained that he] was wondering what pushed him to\n  campaign for this particular mitzvah over the past few months. It was\n  obvious now that the mitzvah of mezuzah is one which requires greater\n  attention and focus. <strong><em>It is critical that all Jews around the world,\n  especially in the Holy Land, become strengthened in this important\n  mitzvah by ensuring that a kosher mezuzah is affixed to every required\n  doorpost</em></strong>, and the mezuzos must be checked that they are still kosher –\n  as the code of Jewish Law maintains – at least twice in seven years.\n  (The Rebbe also pointed out that the women should not solely rely on\n  their husbands to take the mezuzos to be checked, but they should help\n  make sure it gets done.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be done with permission and cooperation because the emphasis is on maintaining the unity of the Jewish people, that we are one. If done via compulsion or force, the benefit would be lost.</p>\n\n<p>And this is what is expressed by the Tur, Choshen Mishpat, 177:4 which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ו<strong>שותף אינו חייב באחריות חבירו</strong> דשותפין הן שומרי שכר זה לזה בעסק הממון <strong>אבל בעסק שמירת גופות כל אחד <em>שמירת גופו עליו</em> ואין חייב בשמירת חבירו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The obligation to safeguard ones body falls on every individual. When the Jewish people are seen as one, like it says in davening, \"מי כעמך ישראל גוי אחד בארץ\", then your fellow Jew is not a partner to whom you have no obligation. They are yourself literally.</p>\n\n\n",

I don't see any such problem in either place. What is Tosfot talking about? Did he have a different version of the  Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maharsha on that Tosfos asks this same problem. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בספרים שלנו אינו כן דויחל הוא אחר ד׳ פסוקים והקרבתם אחר ג׳. ועיין בתשובת מהרי״ל סימן קמט וקשה לי. </p>\n  \n  <p>In our scrolls this is not so, for Vayichal is after four pesukim, and Vehikravtem is after three. See in the Teshuvah Maharil §149, but it’s a problem to me. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, let’s take a look in the Maharil, then. You can find this text online <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/mahril/mahril10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> at the top of page 8. The translation that follows is mine. I’ve translated some parts loosely where a literal translation doesn’t flow well, though I made sure to keep the inherent meaning of the words the same, and in places where I’ve added my own expansion on his words I’ve used brackets. I’ve also expanded his abbreviations. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וההיא דוהקרבתם לא ראיתי עליו תירוץ מקובל דדוחק הוא לומר דבימי הר״י היו הפסוקים בענין אחר מלדידן. וכל רבותינו המתחברים דבתראי אינון מייתי ליה. והתוספות בפרק יש נוחלין דזימנין לא היו בקיאין האמוראים בפסוקים וכן משמע פרק הפרה. ואם נאמר על רבותינו המתחברים צריך עיון.</p>\n  \n  <p>And on that of Vehikravtem, I have not found an accepted answer, because it’s far-fetched to say that in the days of the Ri the pesukim were split up differently than ours. All of the Rabbis who compiled [the Sifrei Torah] later do not bring his [divisions]. Tosfos in Yeish Nochalin [write] that sometimes the Amoraim were not experts in the [divisions of] pesukim, and it’s similarly implied in Perek HaParah, but if you say this on the Rabbis who compiled, that requires further study. </p>\n  \n  <p>שוב נתתי אל לבי דלמא מנהג צרפתי להתחיל פסוק והקרבתם בפרשת מוספין. ושוב מצאתי כן בתשובת רבינו תם אההיא דמפטיר עולה וזה לשונו וביום טוב קרו כולהו בעניינא דיומא והמפטיר הששי קורא והקרבתם עד כאן לשונו. </p>\n  \n  <p>I later thought that perhaps the French custom was to begin [with] the passuk of Vehikravtem in the Mussafin. [Apparently he originally thought that we had the same minhag, leading to the earlier confusion of the division of the pesukim.] I later found in the responsa of Rabbeinu Tam similarly, on the topic of that Maftir Aliya, and these are his words: “On Yom Tov we read the entire topic of the day, and on the sixth day we read from Vehikravtem,” end quote. </p>\n  \n  <p>אבל ויחל אינו קשה דכמה פיסקי פרשיות יש בספרי תורה של צרפתים דלא כרמב״ם [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>But Vayichal is not an issue, for there are many divisions in the Parshios of the French Sifrei Torah which are not like the Rambam. [The rest does not relate to our topic, and so I conclude the quote here.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, according to the Maharil, the French minhag was indeed to divide the parshios differently than ours, which are based off of the Rambam (as @DoubleAA correctly intuited <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92100/please-help-explain-1st-tosfot-on-megillah-22a#comment299515_92100\">in the comments to the OP</a>). The Maharsha, for whatever reason, did not want to say this, so he left it as a question. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Minchat Shai (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14036&st=&pgnum=44\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 32:11</a>), the books of Torah used by Tosafot, had a new paragraph break between Exodus 32:8 and 32:9 (supported by the tikkun of Rabbeinu Tam and a manuscript), and between Numbers 28:16 and 28:17.</p>\n\n\n",

Even though the term is worded to refer to Jews is it applied to others equally?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>TL;DR: Since the idea of tinoq shenishba is an example of compulsion, and it's absurd to think that someone is punished for something they were compelled to do, there must be a concept of non-Jewish tinoq shenishba. That said, a good number of Noachide Laws are self-evident; eg there is no tinoq shenishba when it comes to outright murder.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Tinoq sheNishba is more of an example than a status. The source gemara is Shevuos 5a, from a discussion of a case in the mishnah, of someone who entered the Beis haMiqdash not knowing they were tamei, and found out while there. What about if he didn't know what tum'ah was? Here's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.5a.13?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the quote with R' Shteinzalts's commentary</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל רב פפא לאביי? אלא דקתני אין בה ידיעה בתחלה ויש בה ידיעה בסוף, מי איכא דלית ליה ידיעת בית רבו? א\"ל: אין משכחת לה. בתינוק שנשבה לבין הנכרים:</p>\n<p>Rav Pappa said to Abaye: But [how can you explain the halakha] that is taught [in the mishna: For cases in which] he did not have awareness at the beginning but had awareness at the end? [According to your explanation,] is there [anyone] who does not have [the elementary] knowledge [of the halakhot of ritual impurity that he gained] from his school? [Abaye] said to him: Yes, you find it in the case of a child who was taken captive among gentiles[, who never received even the most elementary level of knowledge].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see the law is about someone who never knew that something was prohibited. The constrast there is to people who once know, and forgot. Or knew for step A and step C, but forgot during the middle step B.</p>\n<p>This kind of ignorance is a case of oneis, being forced to sin. It is just that for well-known laws, as tum'ah was in the days of the Beis haMiqdash, the example case was someone who was raised in captivity and therefore didn't have a basic education or even cultural osmosis of the basic laws.</p>\n<p>The actual rule is \"אונס רחמנא פטריה -- The All-Merciful pardons the one compelled\". In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.54a.3?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 54a</a>, Rav Zeira says the source is the verse \"ולנער [וְלַֽנַּעֲרָה֙] לֹא־תַעֲשֶׂ֣ה דָבָ֔ר -- and to the girl, you shall do nothing.\" (Devarim 22:26). A betrothed woman who has an affair is punished, but here Hashem adds that if she were a rape victim, she is not.</p>\n<p>With that background, I think we can get to your question.  As we see from the Jewish case, the leniency accorded such ignorance is because the sin is considered under compulsion. So, the only way a non-Jew who is a tinoq shenisba could be held punishable would be if a non-Jew who is forced to sin were punished for sinning. Such as if the Torah would expect the execution of a non-Jewish married rape victim. Which I am sure you agree would be absurd.</p>\n<p>Now for the logistic problem: Which of the 7 laws need teaching?</p>\n<p>That stealing and murder are bad is self-evident. Even among murderous thieves; they feel the \"energy\" of breaking taboo. But abortion, while not murder (in most opinions) is also under this umbrella. Wouldn't be known without proper upbringing.</p>\n<p>Rav Elchanan Wasserman Hy\"d zt\"l (Maamar al haEmunah) says that believing there is a G-d is self-evident, and only desire pushes people to rationalize not accepting the obvious. This itself is not self-evident to me. But if so, belief in G-d and avoiding blasphemy would also not be subject to tinoq shenishba treatment, simply because it can't happen.</p>\n<p>Avoiding idolatry is not necessarily self-evident, even according to R' Elchanan. There are many religions that believe in a Creator and Ruler, but also worship middlemen and helpers. So, I guess someone raised Mormon could be a tinoq shenishba with respect to their teachings about the Godhead.</p>\n<p>Illicit sex? I suppose it would depend on which kind. But had you asked in the 1950s, I bet I would have assumed that homosexuality being a sin was self-evident. Time proved me wrong. In any case, I don't think someone raised in a community that has marriage needs to be taught that marital infidelity hurts. Even among \"swingers\" (like what I wrote about murderous thieves), knowing they're breaking taboo is part of the allure the promiscuity has for them.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure how one follows the other, but okay.</p>\n<p>In finding which Hebrew word this relates to, I can only suspect that it is the same as N-G-S (concordance results <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Concordance/5065.%D7%A0%D6%B8%D7%92%D6%B7%D7%A9%D7%82\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), which seems to mean \"to pressure\" (in line with the above).  I would move more to a meaning of agitation in this case, although I don't know that it will necessarily fit across the board.  Feedback welcome.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>However, it seems like quite the mystery as to how/why it means that, and I would like to suggest that it is a combination of two words that are both spelled similarly.</p>\n<p>\"Gas\" appears to mean two or three different things (in many of the lexicons, including Jastrow).  One meaning is some sort of serving dish - and not a spoon.  This can be found in places such as Targum Onkelos as a translation of Keara (Bamidbar 7, for all of the Nesi'im):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קׇרְבָּנ֞וֹ קַֽעֲרַת־כֶּ֣סֶף אַחַ֗ת</p>\n<p>קוּרְבָּנֵיהּ מְגִסְּתָא דִּכְסַף חֲדָא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The root seems to be from M-G-S, and CAL gives us the Peshitta/Syriac to Bamidbar 4:7 (also translation of Keara) as the source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>mgs, mgsˀ   (magsā)   n.m.  vessel\n1  a type of plate or jar  Syr. P Nm4:7 : ܘܢܪܡܘܢ ܒܗ ܡܓ̈ܣܐ ܘܟܦ̈ܐ ܘܡܢ̈ܩܝܬܐ ܘܛܪ̈ܘܠܐ ܕܢܘܩܝܐ‏  they should put down dishes and spoons, and libation bowls and spoons . IshNum 88:8 : ܡܓ̈ܣܐ ܠܦܝ̈ܠܣܐ ܩܿܪܐ܂ ܒܪܡ ܦܝ̈ܠܣܐ ܫܛܝܚܝܢ ܡܢ ܡܓ̈ܣܐ‏ .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can only imagine that the source of this word is N-G-Sh in Hebrew, which means to serve, and therefore, some sort of serving platter is related to this word (technically it means to come/bring forth, but is used to mean serve, such as Bereishis 27:25).</p>\n<p>Another usage seems to be to \"come up\", rise, as per Targum Pseudo-Yonasan to Devarim 17:20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְבִלְתִּ֤י רוּם־לְבָבוֹ֙ מֵֽאֶחָ֔יו</p>\n<p>מטול דלא יגיס לביה יתיר מן אחוי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>CAL has a number of similar words, with G-S-Y meaning a fountain, to vomit up, and other similar words, all of which relate to bringing up.  This likely also comes from the same root as above as G-Sh is used a number of times to mean come forward/come up.</p>\n<p>I would suggest that the action of mixing got it's name from a combination of these.  The mixing action was likely to lift the food inside the pot, and therefore, one becomes a Megis.  However, it is possible that since the spoon was also serving portions of the food, this name stuck as well, even though it originally referred to other vessels.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there any liturgical practice to compensate for the various lengths of psalms?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's quite a lot of variation in the length of the individual psalms (e.g., 117 and 119). In Jewish liturgical practice, is there any system for evening that out? Or is the variation in the time it takes to read/pray such a psalm just accepted?</p>\n\n<p>(My initial assumption was that psalms were read in services. When I searched the site, however, the answers <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/79117/what-happens-in-a-modern-jewish-liturgy\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9047/how-do-jews-pray\">here</a> didn't refer much to use of the psalms. If the psalms aren't actually read in services, please correct me.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Psalms are indeed very prevalent in Jewish services, in some ways forming the backbone of the <em>siddur</em> (prayerbook).  Not all psalms are used on a regular basis and the order often varies from the numbered sequence.  Also sometimes individual verses from various psalms are strung together to form what is essentially a new composition, for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz,_Weekday,_Shacharit,_Pesukei_D'Zimra,_Y'hi_Chavod_(18_verses).1?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Y'hi Chavod</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are psalms that are generally known to be longer.  For example the psalm for Wednesday (Psalm 94) is the longest among the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shir_shel_yom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shir Shel Yom</em> (song of the day)</a> while Friday (Psalm 93) is the shortest.</p>\n\n<p>Among the examples you bring, Psalms 117 is usually sung as part of the Hallel service on festival days and at the beginning of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/45794/3483\">most months</a>.  It is quite short, but it fits into the larger structure of Hallel that is based on Psalms 113 -118.  Specific practices vary, but at my synagogue, each of those psalms gets sung with a unique melody that sets it apart from the others and contributes to the build-up to the climax of the Hallel service.</p>\n\n<p>Your other example, Psalm 119, is so long that I cannot recall it having any place in the standard liturgy,  although if I have overlooked it I am sure someone will correct me.  It would not surprise me if its length had something to do with that choice.  The rabbis were often practical about such things.  For example, according to Seligman Baer, the reason that we leave off certain psalms from the weekday service that are still said on the Sabbath and Festivals because it was too much of a burden to have such a lengthy service on weekdays.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Question of Ribbis (interest) with personal use of employer's gasoline and reimbursement using his own credit card\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone travels to work out of town with his own car. He received a credit card from his employer to pay for the gas for the trip to and from the workplace and his home.\nThe employer does not mind if he makes short local trips before or after work for his own purposes, although he is using gas which was paid for by he employer.\nwhen he travels on longer personal trips he is supposed to pay for his own gas. Sometimes, instead of filling the car with gas before a personal trip he will instead make the trip using gas already in the car which he had previously paid for with the employer's credit card, and as reimbursement to the employer for  the gas used for his personal use, he will fill the car with gas before he goes to work the next time using his own credit card. With this he then travels to work on the gas which he paid for himself, and thus he has repaid his debt.</p>\n\n<p>The question which arose is as follows:\nSince sometimes the trip which he traveled using the employer's gas may be shorter than the trip to and from work which he paid for with his personal credit card, it would turn out that he repaid the employer more than he \"borrowed\".\nWould there be a <em>ribbis</em> problem with such a scenario?</p>\n\n<p>We must also consider the point that the price of gas may have risen by the time he returns it. If it indeed did than he would be returning more value than he took, even if he returned the same quantity of gas as he used.\nMORESO even if the price DID NOT go up, we may be involved in a question of \"<em>seah besah</em>, which forbids borrowing any expendable item with intent to return another of the same item. The reason for the prohibition is because the price of the may rise by the time he returns it. Nonetheless, the prohibition of borrowing <em>Seah Besah</em> is <strong>EVEN IF THE PRICE DOES NOT GO UP</strong>. The chachamim made an <em>issur</em> because it MIGHT go up. So too here to we might have that problem even if he returns exactly the same amount as he took, and the 2 trips were of exactly the same length, and the price of gas did not rise, it still may be forbidden because of <em>Seah Besah</em> as explained.\nOne of the exceptions to the rule of \"<em>seah besah</em>\" is called \"<em>yesh LO</em>\"\n This means that if at the time of the borrowing, the borrower already has in his possession any amount of the item being borrowed he may borrow the item and we are not concerned about a future price rise\nThus, if the car owner had any of his own gasoline in the car at the time which he used the employers gas for himself, there would be no concern of '<em>seah besah</em>'</p>\n\n\n",

For example, in Parashat Bemidbar: Numbers 3:4 and Ruth 1:5\n  (death of brothers), Numbers 4:18 and Ruth 4:10 (cutting off), in Nasso,\n  Numbers 5:8 and Ruth 3:12 (a redeemer), Numbers 6:24 and Ruth 2:4\n  (“May God bless you”), Numbers 6:27 and Ruth 4:14 (a name in Israel),\n  and in Beha'alotcha, the section in Numbers 10: 29-30, where Yitro returns\n  home “to my land and to my family,” a reverse parallel of Ruth.

    "content": "# If pirates demand you turn someone over, why can't you choose the person already subject to the death penalty?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm learning <em>Ketuvot</em> in my shiur, and we brought in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/r/r1608.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Terumah 8:4 on 47a</a>. It states that a boat was traveling and robbers / murderers boarded and said: <em>\"Give us one of you and we'll let the rest live!\"</em> You can't give anybody over, because who says your life is better than the one you were going to give over. </p>\n\n<p>Then in another case it was said that the robbers / murderers chose somebody and it becomes an argument. Rabbi Yochanan says you can give him over if he was chosen, even if he's not like <em>Sheva ben Bichri,</em> but the other rabbi says you can't give him over, only if he is like <em>Sheva ben Bichri.</em> (Sheva ben Bichri was subject to the death penalty when he was killed.)</p>\n\n<p>Then he says if there is a guy, who is due for death in the crowd, and he wasn't chosen by the murderers, you can't give him over. My question is why can't we give him over if he wasn't chosen? If his life is worth less (because he's already subject to the death penalty), then we should be able to give him over. And if we say that his life is worth at least as much as everybody else's, then why can we give him over if they chose him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>To summarize and expand a bit, Yerushalmi Terumah 8:4 says:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If travelers are accosted by a group of gentiles who say \"give us one of you or you'll all be killed\", they can't turn someone over.</li>\n<li>If the murderers designated somebody, as in the case of Sheva ben Bichri, then they should turn him over.</li>\n<li>R' Shimon ben Lakish says: only if he has incurred the death penalty, like Sheva ben Bichri had.</li>\n<li>R' Yochanan says: no, we can hand him over even if he hasn't incurred the death penalty.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>An implication of the first two bullets is: guilt for murder falls (at least partially) on the one who does the choosing.  If the <em>murderers</em> choose somebody then we can hand him over to save the group, according to R' Yochanan.  Reish Lakish places additional restrictions but still allows it in some cases -- so we're allowed to hand him over if <em>we didn't choose him</em>.</p>\n\n<p>But, you argue, there's a special case of a \"dead man walking\", somebody who's dead anyway but it just hasn't been carried out yet, so why can't we extend that to choosing that guy specifically?</p>\n\n<p>The problem isn't that he's subject to the death penalty (or not); it's that <em>we would be doing the choosing</em>.  There is no \"life-value math\" that allows a group to sacrifice one person to save the rest; all human life is infinitely valuable to HaKadosh Baruch Hu.  (R' Jonathan Sacks makes this argument in \"The Practical Implications of Infinity\" in <em>To Touch the Divine</em>, as cited in some study materials I have.)  In the specific case where the murderers choose, we are allowed to go along with that and let the guilt fall on them, but we cannot take an active part in choosing who will be killed, because your blood isn't redder than his.</p>\n\n<p>We can make a further argument based on breaking objects.  In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=17b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Kama 17b</a> we learn that if somebody throws another's (clay) vessel off a roof and, while it's in mid-air, somebody else hits it with a stick and shatters it, that second person isn't liable because it was going to break anyway.  <em>But</em> the tosafot there says that if, instead, somebody threw a rock at the vessel and the second person hit and shattered it, the one who actually broke it is liable -- because the rock might not have hit it or might have hit with too little force to shatter it.  So in the one case the vessel is \"already broken\", but in the other it is not.  I would argue that a person subject to the death penalty but who has not yet been executed is like the second case -- a witness might still come forward to exhonorate him or the court might not carry out the sentence for some other reason.  So, while the person is under a sentence of death, while it is <em>likely</em> that he will be killed, it's not certain.  The death sentence is like the rock being thrown at the vessel, not like the drop from the roof.  (This is my own argument, but I wouldn't have been able to make it if I hadn't taken a course last year where these passages came up in two different sessions, the first on trolley-car dilemmas and the second on hastening inevitable outcomes.)</p>\n\n\n",

With regard to the former, your point is to absorb the moisture into the napkin, not to release it.  If some was unintentionally extracted as well, that would be considered a <em>davar she'eino mithkavein</em> (unintentional) and therefore also permitted (even according to those who hold one would violate <em>dosh</em>/<em>mefarek</em> for desirable re-extraction of an artificially absorbed substance).   With regard to <em>melabein</em>, the napkin typically is not desirably cleaner as a result of the drying of the cup.  See, e.g., Shulchan Arukh OC 302:12, Mishna Berura 302:59, and Shemirath Shabbath Kehilchatha 12:19,21, all cited <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Melabain\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If one did indeed intend/desire to clean a dirty cloth in the process, that would be forbidden.

If we both agree to let a bet din decide the matter, then you inherit and the matter is closed.  But if I take you to secular court and the court (after all appeals are exhausted) says I inherit, we have a clear question for dina d'malchuta dina.  Does the latter ALWAYS apply in financial matters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Two things I found.  First, taking someone to secular court over a personal matter violates halacha:\n\"When a case is between two Jews [ben adam l’chavero], we judge it with Jewish law only.\" [Chazon Ish C.M. Likkutim 16:1]  The Talmud says: \"Rabbi Tarfon used to say: In any place where you find non-Jewish law courts, even though their law is the same as the Jewish law, you must not resort to them.\" [Gittin 88b]</p>\n\n<p>Second, this article I found (\"Yerusha and Dina D'malchuta Dina\")\n<a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/yerusha-and-dina-dmalchuta-dina-part-three-by-rabbi-howard-jachter-and-martin-m-shenkman-esq\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/yerusha-and-dina-dmalchuta-dina-part-three-by-rabbi-howard-jachter-and-martin-m-shenkman-esq</a>\nseems to answer my question.</p>\n\n<p>-The secular laws of intestacy (dying without a will) generally contradict halacha.</p>\n\n<p>-The deceased violated halacha if he died without a will that follows halacha.</p>\n\n<p>-Dina D'malchuta Dina does not apply to the rules of inheritance. [Rashba 6:254]</p>\n\n<p>-Following the secular court's ruling is theft.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The point of the Rashba, broadly, is that dina d'malchusa dina concerns matters in which the state has an interest; most notably the Gemara talks about taxes and drafts. If two parties can agree to any terms they like on a matter between them, then the state may write a law which applies to the default case -- or a case where the two sides don't/can't agree -- but if both sides are happy with something different, the state is fine with that too. </p>\n\n<p>So if siblings agree how to split family assets, it may be different than what US law says, but that's fine. To call this Dina D'Malchusa Dina -- and this is the Rashba's point -- is to say we can throw away Jewish law in cases between two parties where the state is just as happy for them to apply halacha, mediation, or Ouija board to settle their dispute out of court! If so we'd be doing away with halachic civil law entirely. </p>\n\n<p>In short: this sounds like a case for a beis din.</p>\n\n<p>Just to throw in one caveat -- if I'm selling someone a house, the two of us could stipulate that the terms of the sale follow the law of California; a Malaysian mufti; the defaults of halacha; or whatever else we like. Both halacha and the state are okay with this -- if the two of us agreed to those terms. So absent any agreement, what do we assume are people's terms? In some cases a case can be made that both parties implicitly agreed to the terms of the local state; if so, <strong>a beis din</strong> could instruct the parties how to handle the property accordingly.</p>\n\n\n",

A few examples:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0101.htm#24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 1:24</a> - And God said, \"Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle and creeping things (remes) and the beasts of the earth according to their kind,\" and it was so.</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 1:25 & 26 says the same thing in essence</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0106.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 6:7</a> - And the Lord said, \"I will blot out man, whom I created, from upon the face of the earth, from man to cattle to creeping thing (remes), to the fowl of the heavens, for I regret that I made them.\"</p>\n\n<p>Genesis 6:20 - Of the fowl after its kind and of the animals after their kind, of every creeping thing (remes) upon the ground after its kind; two of each shall come to you to preserve alive.</p>\n\n<p>All throughout the Noah story remes is only used as a reference to creeping things, while other words are used to describe other animals.  The same goes for 1 Kings, Psalms, Ezekiel, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So my question is, why in Genesis 9:3 is remes translated as all moving things when no where else is this even implied, much less explicit?  Did HaShem actually tell Noah he could eat all moving things that live?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The narrow sense definition of the word רמש is provided by R' Yechiel Michel Stern in his sefer <em>Lashon Limudim</em> through a series of comments on the entry רמשים, p. 398. He first brings <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.24?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 1:24</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורמש — It means creeping swarms that creep low upon the ground; they appear as though they are dragged along, for how they move is not discernible. What we call רמש and שרץ in our (Hebrew) language, they call in old French <em>mouvoir</em>; English to move.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then he brings <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.24?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban on Bereshis 1:24</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורמש (AND CREEPING THING). Rashi wrote: “These are creeping swarms that creep low upon the earth, appearing as though they are dragged along.” Now in this chapter we find: <em>And over every animal ‘haromeseth’ (that creepeth) upon the earth;</em> (Bereshis 1:28, <em>Here Rashi’s interpretation could not apply to animal.</em>) and it is further written, <em>And all flesh ‘haromes’ (that moved) upon the earth perished, both fowl and cattle, and beasts, and every swarming thing that swarmeth upon the earth;</em> (Bereshis 7:21). also, <em>Wherein all the beasts of the forest ‘tirmos’ (do creep forth).</em> (Psalms 104:20). But the meaning of <em>r’misah</em> is as if it were written with the letter samech, as in <em>The foot tirm’senah (shall tread it down)</em>, (Isaiah 26:6). and other related expressions. He thus says of beasts and cattle, ‘romes’ (that tread) on the earth, (Bereshis 1:26) and of creeping things that drag along, ‘remes’ (that creep) upon the ground, (Bereshis 1:25) because they tread on the ground with their entire body.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Stern also brings comment attributed (to Ramban) wrote here that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רמשים - creatures that are treaded by men's feet due to their small size and lowliness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Stern also brings HaGR\"A from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aderet_Eliyahu%2C_Genesis.1.25.1?ven=hebrew%7CAderet_Eliyahu,_Halberstadt,_1860&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aderes Eliyahu on Bereshis 1:25</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רמשים are fruitful and multiply al lot, but they are creepy, born from mouldy things. This kind of creatures is brought from the element of fire from heating garbage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, we have a comment of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yachin_on_Mishnah_Parah.9.11.1?ven=hebrew%7CMishnah,_ed._Romm,_Vilna_1913&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiferes Israel on mishnah Parah 9:11 Yachin</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רמשים - living creatures that do not have bones (i.e. skeleton), like flies, mosquitoes, and worms</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>However, in the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.3?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 9:3</a> we are dealing with the wider translation of the word רמש as <em>moving thing</em> and we have to understand it specifically according to Ramban on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.3?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 9:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>EVERY רמש (MOVING THING) THAT LIVETH. This refers to cattle, beasts and fowl — and also the fish in the sea — since all of them are called “moving things,” just as it is written: Every living creature ‘haromeseth’ (that creepeth) wherewith the waters swarmed. (see above, Bereshis 1:21).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps, in times of drought, one could consume even lower creatures if there is a safe way, for as we know from the science of biology the lowly things carry many different parasites that are dangerous to humans.</p>\n\n\n",

The parameters of telling the truth vary though and there are four types of circumstances where one can bend the truth (adapted from Hershey H. Friedman and Abraham C.

Is it reflective of a more prevalent understanding that had to be eradicated?\"</p>\n\n<p>My answer is an emphatic yes. Interpreting the term בני אלהים literally as \"sons of God\" would imply that the Hebrew God has a body and is capable of having children, just like the ancient pagans believed about their anthropomorphic gods. This interpretation was actually quite popular in the midrashic and aggadic sources of the time, see <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/8867/who-were-the-sons-of-god-bene-elohim-in-genesis-62\">this question</a>. However, this view of course is anathema to the Hebrew view of an omnipotent God that does not resemble humans in any way and cannot bear children. That is why R Shimon cursed anyone who interpreted this verse literally; he felt that this view was contrary to Jewish philosophy and belief and had to be eradicated.  </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this can used as support to the Maimonidean position that belief in Anthropomorphism is heresy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Baruch Spinoza was cursed for his opinions in a book he published in the seventeenth century and is one of the most notable examples.

'The belief that Moses wrote the Pentateuch at the dictation of God was shared by Christians as well as Jews in the seventeenth century.

Biblical criticism in the nineteenth century relied on Spinoza to develop the whole subject further.'

In regards to the doctrine of the Jews as a Chosen People, he said: '“at the present time there is nothing whatsoever that the Jews can arrogate to themselves above other nations” (TTP, chap. 3, G III.56/S 45). 'Spinoza thereby rejects the particularism that many—including Amsterdam’s Sephardic rabbis—insisted was essential to Judaism.

The source that David died on Shabbos is Bavli Shabbos 30a-b, but they don’t say anything about Shavuos. As all of these are Amoraim, they can argue on one another. </p>\n\n<p>That answer doesn’t work, though, because Rus Rabbah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ruth_Rabbah.3.2?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:2</a> says he died on both Shabbos and Shavuos. </p>\n\n<p>However, all is not lost, as there’s no reason to say Shavuos could not have been on Shabbos. David HaMelech lived long before we had a pre-established calendar, rather than being established monthly based on when witnesses came. In our current calendar you are correct that Shavuos can’t fall on Shabbos (OC 429), but in the days before a calendar any day of the year could fall on any day of the week.</p>\n\n<p>For example: Yom Kippur, according to our current calendar, cannot fall out on a Sunday, Tuesday, or Friday (ibid.). However, the Rambam (Hil. Eruvin 8:10) writes that when it’s up to witnesses, Yom Kippur could fall on these days. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, we have another discussion of Shavuos falling on Shabbos. The following is a Mishnah, from Chagigah 2:4 (h/t @DoubleAA):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עֲצֶרֶת שֶׁחָל לִהְיוֹת בְּעֶרֶב שַׁבָּת, בֵּית שַׁמַּאי אוֹמְרִים, יוֹם טְבוֹחַ אַחַר הַשַּׁבָּת. וּבֵית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים, אֵין יוֹם טְבוֹחַ אַחַר הַשַּׁבָּת. וּמוֹדִים <strong>שֶׁאִם חָל לִהְיוֹת בְּשַׁבָּת</strong>, שֶׁיּוֹם טְבוֹחַ אַחַר הַשַּׁבָּת.</p>\n  \n  <p>When Shavuot occurs on Friday, Beit Shammai says that the day of slaughter [for its burnt offerings] is after Shabbat [i.e., on Sunday]. And Beit Hillel says, that the day after Shabbat is not the day for slaughter [rather it is Friday], but agrees that <strong>if Shavuot occurs on Shabbat</strong>, the next day [Sunday] is the day of slaughter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The calendar you're talking about wasn't invented yet. For example, on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.21a.1?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rosh haShanah 21a-b</a> there is a discussion about years when both Nissan and Elul are short, whether one has to worry about the possibility of 2 short months in a row, and the like. So the calendar we used wasn't fixed yet.</p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion among rishonim as to whether in the Beis haMiqdash, the month was determined by when witnesses saw the moon, or the month was determined by the courts' computation, and that was when they accepted witnesses to testify about the moon as a formal halachic step in the ritual of declaring the month. (The latter opinion is given by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.2?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Chananel&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Chananel on Shemos 12:2</a>.) But even according to the later opinion, gemaros like the one in Rosh haShanah mean that the computation was not the same as the one we use today.</p>\n\n<p>The discussion in the gemara is illustrated with stories of Rabbi Yochanan (180–279 CE), one of his students Rabbi Aivu bar Nagarei and Rabbi Chiyya bar Abba, and Rava (280 – 352 CE). Rava one year fasted a whole \"Yom Kippur\" only to be told that the actual Yom Kippur was the next day. He fasted 49 hours!</p>\n\n<p>His contemporary, Abayei (d. 338), lived when our computation became standardized, and the calendar would be known in advance. It was his day that the Jews of the Diaspora receieved a letter telling them to continue observing 2 days for each holiday, despite now knowing the date, \"<em>minhag avoseikhem beyedeikhem</em> -- the custom of your ancestors is in your hand\", now as commemorative rabbinic law. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beitzah.4b.12?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beitzah 4b</a>)</p>\n\n<p>So, the calendar dates to the early 4th century CE. Well after King David.</p>\n\n<p><hr>\nAside from that, DonielF is right to draw our attention to the reality that amoraim not only argue about halakhah, but they could argue about aggadita too. There is no reason to assume the tradition that says David died on Shabbos is in agreement with the one who says he died on Shavuos.</p>\n\n<p>In general, I am giving the same 2 part answer as he did, just with more detail about the calendar.</p>\n\n\n",

But if you look carefully, he's discussing a different minhag: to put trees in shul. That minhag was <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.494.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brought</a> by the Magen Avraham, not the Rema.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>While your thought, that the Vilna Gaon only prohibited trees, has become popular recently with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_tree#18th_to_early_20th_centuries\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">popularization of Christmas trees</a>, it's not historically accurate. He prohibited greenery on Shavuot because it paralleled the greenery set up in churches (especially Orthodox ones) for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pentecost</a> (the Christian holiday which parallels Shavuot) which commonly includes birch branches and red flowers. This is noted explicitly in his student's <em>Chayei Adam</em> (131:13):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והגר״א ביטל מנהג מלהעמיד אילנות בעצרת משום שעכשיו הוא חק העמים להעמיד .אילנות בחג שלהם שקורין זאלאני״ע או פינגסט״ן‏<br>\n  And the GR\"A nullified the custom to put up trees on Shavuot because now it's the practice of the nations to put up trees on their holiday that they call <a href=\"https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zes%C5%82anie_Ducha_%C5%9Awi%C4%99tego\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zelelnia</a> or <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pfingsten\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pfingsten</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's all the Chayei Adam wrote. He never mentioned a custom about \"grasses\" beforehand that you can learn that he meant \"trees\" specifically and not \"greenery\", nor would such a read make sense since churches on Pentecost don't exclusively use trees. Indeed another of the Vilna Gaon's students, R' Mordechai ben <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Leib_Epstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aryeh Leib</a>, wrote (Sefer HaLikuttim):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מנהגו של החסיד שביטל העשבים בשבועות אף שהרמ״א הביאו...‏<br>\n  The custom of [the Vilna Gaon] who nullified the grasses on Shavuot even though the Rama brought it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Igrot Moshe (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=922&st=&pgnum=214\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 4:11:5</a>) also understands the Chayei Adam and Vilna Gaon to be referring to both \"trees\" and \"grasses\" because of Pentecost.</p>\n\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan, after writing about the old customs of both \"grasses\" and \"trees\", concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם בדורות שלפנינו ביטלו האילנות והעשבים, מטעמים שידעו הגדולים שבדור.‏<br>\n  However, in the generations that preceded us they nullified the [customs of] trees and grasses [because of the Vilna Gaon].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan's assessment of common practice matches yours.</p>\n\n<p>(I note though the custom is still alive and well in some communities.)</p>\n\n\n",

Where is this brought down, and whats the reason for this? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The source that someone obligated in a mitzvah receives more reward than someone not obligated is a statement of R. Chanina which appears several times in the Talmud. The first appearance is <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 31a</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"ר חנינא ומה מי שאינו מצווה ועושה כך מצווה ועושה עאכו\"כ דאר\"ח גדול\n  מצווה ועושה ממי שאינו מצווה ועושה אמר רב יוסף מריש ה\"א מאן דהוה אמר לי\n  הלכה כר\"י דאמר סומא פטור מן המצות עבידנא יומא טבא לרבנן דהא לא\n  מיפקידנא והא עבידנא השתא דשמעיתא להא דא\"ר חנינא גדול מצווה ועושה יותר\n  ממי שאינו מצווה ועושה אדרבה מאן דאמר לי דאין הלכה כרבי יהודה עבידנא\n  יומא טבא לרבנן</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, R. Hanina observed thereon, If one who is not commanded [to\n  honour his parents], yet does so, is thus [rewarded], how much more so\n  one who is commanded and does so! For R. Hanina said: He who is\n  commanded and fulfils [the command], is greater than he who fulfils it\n  though not commanded.  R. Joseph said: Originally, I thought, that if\n  anyone would tell me that the halachah agrees with R. Judah, that a\n  blind person is exempt from the precepts,I would make a banquet for\n  the Rabbis, seeing that I am not obliged, yet fulfil them. Now,\n  however, that I have heard R. Hanina's dictum that he who is commanded\n  and fulfils [the command] is greater than he who fulfils it though not\n  commanded; on the contrary, if anyone should tell me that the halachah\n  does not agree with R. Judah, I would make a banquet for the Rabbis.\n  (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nashim/Kiddushin.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosafot</a> on the spot explains that the reasoning behind this is that an obligated individual goes through more worry and anguish that he might mess it up, while the non-obligated individual has nothing to worry about because he is not even obligated. The extra worry/anguish gets him extra reward.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה דהיינו טעמא דמי שמצווה ועושה עדיף לפי שדואג ומצטער יותר פן יעבור\n  ממי שאין מצווה שיש לו פת בסלו שאם ירצה יניח</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Tov_Asevilli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ritva</a>, in his commentary there, first quotes \"our rabbis\" as explaining that Satan goes after one who is commanded and not one who is not commanded. Therefore, one who is commanded receives more reward in accordance with the extra effort that was required. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פירשו רבותינו ז\"ל טעם הדבר שזה שטן מקטרגו כשהוא מצווה וזה אין שטן\n  מקטרגו ולפום צערא אגרא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He than quotes \"our great rabbi\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ramban</a>) as explaining that one who is obligated fulfills the decree of the King by doing a mitzvah whereas one who is not obligated does not fulfill a decree of the King; hence the former gets more reward.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורבינו הגדול ז\"ל פירש שהמצות אינן להנאת האל יתברך המצוה אלא לזכותינו\n  ומי שהוא מצווה קיים גזירת המלך ולפיכך שכרו מרובה יותר מזה שלא קיים\n  מצות המלך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Alex focused on the question from the \"from where\" angle, I will talk about the \"why\" after the \"/\" in the title version of the question.</p>\n<p>I think it makes sense from a-priori principles.</p>\n<p>Why was this action obligated to this person, and this one left optional for that person? It would seem that the obligatory <em>mitzvah</em> is one that Hashem (in the case of <em>deOraisa</em>) or the Sanhedrin (in the case of <em>deRabbanan</em>) determined was more critical for this person to do.</p>\n<p>In other words, logically speaking, it's not that the obligation directly or indirectly causes the reward. It is that the greater reward and the greater obligation are both consequences of the <em>mitzvah</em>'s greater value to this particular person.</p>\n<p>One can also read Tosafos in a manner consistent with this observation. They write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה דהיינו טעמא דמי שמצווה ועושה עדיף לפי שדואג ומצטער יותר פן יעבור ממי שאין מצווה שיש לו פת בסלו שאם ירצה יניח</p>\n<p>It appears this this is the reason: Someone who is commanded and does is greater because he is worried and troubled more, lest he violate [the command], compared to someone who was not commanded who has his \"bread in his basket\" [i.e. his needs are taken care of] so if he wants, he could rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While at first glance this Tosafos says that it's the command itself that causes the extra trouble which in turn causes the extra reward, they could be saying something very different. This read makes \"<em>pas besalo</em> -- bread in his basket\" an awkward use of the idiom. It implies that one has a need that the other already has met, not that the other never needed. Someone who is not commanded has \"<em>pas besalo</em>\", because they are deemed less lacking in this area. Which is the whole reason it wasn't put on their to-do list. Whereas someone who is commanded is commanded because the <em>mitzvah</em> is a growth experience and a challenge he must overcome. Thus, it takes him more work to avoid violating the command.</p>\n<p>This is why the Ramban writes, \"המצות אינן להנאת הקל יתברך המצוה אלא לזכותינו -- <em>mitzvos</em> aren't for the blessed G-d the Commander's benefit, but for our own merit.\" The one who is commanded and performed is one who needs that particular kind of merit. As the Ritva continues the thought, the commanded person's <em>yeitzer hara</em> is more active in this area than the non-commanded person. To explain: Which is the whole reason they didn't need the command.</p>\n\n\n",

Because if not, when he reads the curses, there is a danger to someone whom he doesn't like. He also told me that if someone knows that the chazzan (Torah reader) is not fond of him, if he will call him up for [the aliya of] the curses he should be careful and not go up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The explanation to this is because the Baal-Koreh might have in his mind during the reading of the curses that they should fall upon the person whom he does not like.</p>\n\n<p>Question: If the בעל קורא did indeed have in mind that the curse which he reads should befall a specific person, and he read a pasuk with Hashem's name in it (eg.

Most of the time they are kneeling, prostrating or falling on their faces. We see that when Moshe prayed, he fell on his face (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 14:5</a>, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=206\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 16:4</a> for two of many examples.) </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14260&st=&pgnum=56\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 6:11</a>, we see that he faced Jerusalem and prayed 3 times daily in a kneeling position. The 3 times daily prayer facing Jerusalem looks like the closest \"imitation\" to our current <em>Amidah</em> (in terms of facing Jerusalem.)</p>\n\n<p>There are some exceptions. Regarding Avraham it says, \"He was still <strong>standing</strong> before G-d.'

See Mishnah Bavli <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=22b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 3:5</a> and <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=30b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 5:1</a> which both use the term \"standing\".</p>\n\n<p>At what point and why did the posture change to standing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maaseh_Rokeach_on_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.5.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'aseh Rokeach to Hilchot Tefillah 5:2</a> writes that a source for the requirement to stand during prayer is the concept of:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין שירות אלא מעומד</p>\n  \n  <p>The [priestly Temple] service was only performed while standing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.38a.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 38a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of his comment is that our prayers today are modelled (to an extent) on the Temple service.

In the Torah scroll there is no line break either. Where does this <em>minhag</em> come from and what is its meaning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The issue is discussed in detail by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binyamin_Shlomo_Hamburger\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Hamburger</a> in Volume 4 of his priceless series, <a href=\"https://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/en/shorshei\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shorshei Minhag Ashkenaz</a>, and a bit shorther, but in English in the <a href=\"https://www.moreshesashkenaz.org/en/shorshei/4-shorshei-english\" rel=\"noreferrer\">kitzur edition</a>. His main point is that in Ashkenaz most Jews became unfamiliar with the proper melody of Torah reading over the centuries (see <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A1%D7%90_%D7%9B%D7%93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orach Chayim 61:24</a>), so they didn't read it anymore aloud and they also finished it earlier than the rabbi. As they were waiting for the rabbi, he started to read it aloud, and he had multiple reasons to do this. First of all, on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.12b.23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berakhot 12b</a>, when the reading of the last paragraph in the evening is discussed, the <em>mishnah</em> uses the word <em>remind</em> (מזכירין) instead of <em>remember</em> (זוכרין). So by reading out aloud the last paragraph, he could remind the congregation of the Exodus, which is a positive commandment based on <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0516.htm#3\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 16:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹֽא־תֹאכַ֤ל עָלָיו֙ חָמֵ֔ץ שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִ֛ים תֹּֽאכַל־עָלָ֥יו מַצּ֖וֹת לֶ֣חֶם עֹ֑נִי כִּ֣י בְחִפָּז֗וֹן יָצָ֨אתָ֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם <strong>לְמַ֣עַן תִּזְכֹּ֗ר אֶת־י֤וֹם צֵֽאתְךָ֙ מֵאֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֔יִם כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽיךָ׃</strong></p>\n<p>Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction; for in haste didst thou come forth out of the land of Egypt; <strong>that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The exact meaning of <em>all the days of your life</em> is discussed in the well known <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mishnah</a> and in the <em>Haggadah.</em> This explains well the recital of the last paragraph, but not the verse <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0511.htm#21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 11:21</a>. However, this verse is of particular importance, because if someone errs during the recital of the <em>Shema,</em> but remembers that he has already said it, there is no need to return to the beginning of the paragraph (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.16a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berakhot 16a</a>). Many rabbis considered this verse suitable to bless all the Jews that made the effort to come to the synagogue, and read it aloud. (While there were others that opposed this practice, saying he shouldn't have anything else in mind when fulfilling the commandment of reciting the <em>Shema.)</em> I would also add that the word למען in Devarim 16:3 can allude to Devarim 11:21.</p>\n<p>The line break can hint that from this point on the rabbi reads the verses aloud, which is recorded in multiple places, such as in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=28283&width=0&scroll=0&udid=0&pagenum=31\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Divrei Kehilot</a> by R' Geiger:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the rabbi (and if he is not present in the synagogue it is upon the teachers from the leaders of the community to take his place) says aloud למען ירבו until אמת with the <em>teamim.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On p. 5 of the <a href=\"https://opensiddur.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Tefiloh-Sefas-Yisroel-3-Arvit.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefas Yisroel siddur</a> it is also written:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>.'הרב הקורא שמע בטעמים מרים קולו מ'למען ירבו' עד 'אמת</p>\n<p>The rabbi, who reads <em>Shema</em> with the <em>teamim</em> raises his voice from למען ירבו until אמת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is also mentioned in the <a href=\"http://mek.oszk.hu/04000/04093/html/0537.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hungarian Jewish Encyclopedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The rabbi recites this part of the [second] chapter aloud.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If Avraham had answered him, \"Behold You have not given me offspring other than this, and You promised me, and how could I do it?\", he would not be regarded as a sinner, and he would not have received any punishment. Nonetheless, by his love for HaShem he found in his heart to do the Akeida, Only so that he would do the will of Hashem, even though if he had not done it, he would not have attained punishment at all.

So if Avraham was not commanded to do the Akeida, this would diminish the greatness of the act of the Akeida, not show its greatness.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your citation of the Derashos HaRan is incomplete. Here is the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41560&st=&pgnum=47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">text</a> of the entire paragraph:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם יתאמת שמי שישען עליו באמת להיות (נשען) [נכנס] בעובי הקורה\n  בעבודתו יתברך שיעשה מעשה יותר רחוק מן הטבע [יורה על היותו נשען על השם\n  יתברך באמת] והיותר רחוק מן הטבע הוא מעשה אברהם אבינו עליו השלום בעקידת\n  יצחק כי לא היה נמשך לו עונש כלל אם לא יעקדנו כי לא צוהו השם יתברך בזה\n  והנה הבטיחו  כי ביצחק יקרא לך זרע וזהו לשון הכתוב קח נא את בנך וגו'\n  וכבר נודע שזה המאמר אינו לשון צווי אלא לשון בקשה שהראה לו שייטב בעיניו\n  אם ימחול אברהם על הבטחתו ויעקוד בנו ולו היה אברהם משיבו הן לי לא נתתה\n  זרע כי אם זה והבטחתני בו ואיך אעשה זה לא נחשב לו עון ולא ישיגנו עונש\n  מזה ואף על פי כן לגודל אהבתו את השם יתברך מצא את לבבו לעקדו כדי שיעשה\n  חפץ השם יתברך לבד ואף על פי שאילו לא עשאו לא היה משיגו עונש כלל וזהו\n  ענין העקידה וסודו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ran is defining the category of \"ישען עליו באמת\" \"relying on Him (God) in truth\". He says that the epitome of this category is doing something that is \"יותר רחוק מן הטבע\" \"most distant from nature\", i.e. the most unnatural thing for a human to do. The greatest example of this, he says, is Avraham performing Akeidas Yitzchak. This is so because slaughtering one's child is incredibly painful and difficult. Had the situation been one in which Avraham would have been punished for not complying with the request, it would be less incredible that Avraham did it. Since, however, Avraham had the option to \"opt out\" at any time with no consequences, the fact that he went through with it is so much more incredible and it demonstrates an unparalleled love for God.</p>\n\n<p>According to this understanding, the test is made harder by the fact that it would have been so easy for Avraham to not go through with it.</p>\n\n<p>How does this relate to the general concept of \"gadol hametzuveh v'oseh\"? If your question is simply how Akeidas Yitzvhak can be greater than the other tests if it was not commanded and they were commanded**, (and this is the implication of your final paragraph) I would say that this is likely a misunderstanding of \"gadol hametzuveh v'oseh\". What this concept means is that If Person A is commanded to do XYZ and Person B is not commanded to do XYZ, A's performance of XYZ is greater than B's performance of XYZ. That does not mean, however, that if A is commanded to do XYZ and B is not commanded to do ABC that A's performance of XYZ is greater than B's performance of ABC, because it is possible that ABC is intrinsically greater than XYZ. So in this case the non-commanded Akeidas Yitzchak could still be greater than the other commanded tests because the act itself is intrinsically greater than the other acts. (In other words \"gadol hametzuveh v'oseh\" is only applicable in a comparison of two identical acts.)</p>\n\n<p>However, if your question is (and this is the implication of the title) why the non-commandedness of Akeidas Yitzchak would increase its greatness relative to itself (i.e. that Akeidas Yitzchak being  non-commanded is greater than Akeidas Yitzchak if it would have been commanded) the above does not suffice.</p>\n\n<p>To address this I would say that it depends how you understand the reason for \"gadol hametzuveh v'oseh\". In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92292/13438\">this answer</a> I quoted the opinion of Tosafos that it is because doing an obligated mitzvah involves more anguish than doing a voluntary mitzvah because when doing a voluntary mitzvah you know that you can always give up, and the first opinion cited by the Ritva that obligatory mitzvos are harder due to Satan's machinations. Indeed these explanations would seem to be contradictory to the Ran who appears to be saying the opposite – that being voluntary makes it harder.</p>\n\n<p>However, the second answer cited by the Ritva (in the name of the Ramban) is that it is greater when one is fulfilling the King's command than when one is not fulfilling the King's command. I think this could fit with the Ran's explanation here. A general example of \"einah metzuveh v'oseh\" is someone that was never asked by God to so something at all (e.g. women performing time-bound positive commandments). That would fall under the category of not fulfilling the King's command because it is purely voluntary. By Akeidas Yitzchak it was not purely voluntary; God requested that Avraham do it but just didn't assign a punishment if he wouldn't do it. In this case he was directly fulfilling the request of the King. In other words, it is possible that despite everything the Ran said he would still consider this a case of \"metzuveh v'oseh\" and not \"einah metzuveh v'oseh\", and thus no contradiction arises.</p>\n\n<p>A further point is that perhaps the Ran understands the rule of \"gadol hametzuveh v'oseh\" as referring to general mitzvos. This is because in general mitzvos are not designed to be specifically cruel to the performer. Therefore it is not inherently super-difficult to perform the mitzvah; adding the obligatory nature would make it harder in accordance with Tosafos and Ritva 1. But Akeidas Yitzchak is by design fundamentally difficult, perhaps even cruel. Avraham is being asked to slaughter his own child. In that case it is precisely the voluntary nature that makes it harder, because he had the ability to easily avoid causing excruciating pain to himself by simply opting out. In other words, it is possible that in general being obligatory makes something harder but in unique situations being voluntary makes something harder.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Summary of three main points</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"Gadol hametzuveh v'oseh\" is only applicable in a comparison of two\nidentical acts.</li>\n<li>It is possible that despite everything the Ran said he would still\nconsider this a case of \"metzuveh v'oseh\" and not \"einah metzuveh\nv'oseh\", and thus no contradiction arises.</li>\n<li>It is possible that in general being obligatory makes something\nharder but in unique situations being voluntary makes something\nharder.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>**This is not even taking into account that some of the other tests were commanded. In fact R. Yoel Stanitzky argues (Peri Mussar, Ma'amar Asarah Nisyonos) that Akeidas Yitzchak was a bigger test than getting thrown into the furnace, precisely because the former was commanded while the latter was not.</p>\n\n\n",

He will be marrying a divorcee without waiting three months after her first marriage [הבחנה]. This is forbidden even when only doing kedushin. (Even Haezer 13) However, if the [דבר עבירה] rule applies to עבירות that are not part of the main service the agent is doing, is a matter of dispute.

There’s a fascinating sugya on the concept of an aveirah lishmah, a sin done for the sake of Heaven, discussed in Horayos 10b-11a. The following quotes are excerpts of it that are relevant to the OP, all from Sefaria. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משל ללוט ושתי בנותיו הן שנתכוונו לשם מצוה צדיקים ילכו בם הוא שנתכוון לשם עבירה ופושעים יכשלו בם</p>\n  \n  <p>It is comparable to Lot and his two daughters. They, who intended to perform a mitzvah - “the righteous will walk in them;” he, who intended to sin - “the sinners will stumble in them.” [The Gemara proceeds to support its assertion that Lot intended to sin.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב נחמן בר יצחק גדולה עבירה לשמה ממצוה שלא לשמה שנאמר (שופטים ה, כד) תבורך מנשים יעל אשת חבר הקיני מנשים באהל תבורך מאן נינהו נשים באהל שרה רבקה רחל ולאה איני והאמר רב יהודה אמר רב לעולם יעסוק אדם בתורה ובמצות אפילו שלא לשמה שמתוך שלא לשמה בא לשמה אימא כמצוה שלא לשמה</p>\n  \n  <p>Says Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak: Great is a sin for the sake of Heaven, more so than a mitzvah not for its sake, as it says, “Blessed among women is Yael the wife of Chever HaKeini [who was intimate with Sisera, who was attacking Bnei Yisrael], to tire him out so she could kill him]; from women in the tent should she be blessed.” Who are the women in the tent? Sarah, Rivkah, Rachel, and Leah. Is that so? But Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav: a person should always strive to do a mitzvah not for its sake, for through doing it not for its sake he will come to do it for its sake!

    "content": "# Halachic issues with double ring wedding ceremony\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was at a wedding in Israel where the rabbi was religious (orthodox) and the couple wasn't. Towards the end of the ceremony, the Rav said that the bride also wanted to give a ring to the groom. The bride said a few nice words then handed a ring to her new husband. I was quite surprised since I thought giving such a ring might invalidate the wedding but didn't get a chance to ask the rabbi himself.</p>\n\n<p>I see that this practice is known as a \"double ring ceremony\" and is frown upon, e.g., R Yosef Resnick of Chabad <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/477319/jewish/Is-a-Double-Ring-Wedding-Ceremony-Kosher.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The legal transaction implied by the groom giving the bride a ring has\n  now been matched one for one, and thereby cancelled. Her status\n  remains unchanged. It is as if the bride has not received anything at\n  all, or as if she has given back the gift.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also read <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48775/11501\">here</a> on MY that R Elyashiv said it could possibly invalidate the <em>kiddushin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>What are halachic issues with such a double ring ceremony? Do <em>poskim</em> believe it does invalidate the <em>kiddushin</em>? Does it make a difference if the rabbi says something like \"Now that the <em>kiddushin</em> is over the <em>kalla</em> wants to give a ring to the <em>hatan</em>\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>This question was posed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Ephraim Greenblatt in 1969, and is recorded in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&pgnum=438\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe E.H. 3:18</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the first paragraph he explains that the kiddushin is still effective even with a double-ring-ceremony:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בדבר אלו שאחר שהחתן קדש בטבעת את הכלה נתנה גם הכלה להחתן טבעת ואמרה\n  הריני מקודשת לך או אתה מקודש לי ודאי לענין הקידושין מאחר שכבר נתקדשה\n  כדין הם קידושין גמורים ומה שגם היא נתנה וגם אמרה מה שאמרה הם דברי הבל\n  ושטות ואף שידעו מתחלה הם והעדים שיעשו כן שגם היא תתן טבעת ותאמר לא\n  שייך לבטל הקידושין משום שנימא שהוא כאיגלאי מילתא שרוצים שהקידושין יהיו\n  גם ע\"י נתינתה ואמירתה דהרי אף אם היו מתנים כן בפירוש היה זה כמתנה ע\"מ\n  שכתוב בתורה שאינו כלום וכ\"ש שלא מועיל גילוי מילתא לבד ואף אם יתנו\n  בתנאי כפול כהלכות תנאי שיחולו קידושין רק באם תתן לו גם היא אח\"כ טבעת\n  ובאמירה נמי ודאי יחולו הקידושין כשיתקיים התנאי כתנאי דע\"מ שתתן לי\n  מאתים זוז וכל תנאי וזה פשוט    </p>\n  \n  <p>With regard to the matter of those who, after the groom performs\n  kiddushin to the bride with a ring the bride also gives a ring to the\n  groom and says \"hareini mekudeshes lecha\" or \"atah mekudash li\",\n  certainly with regard to the kiddushin since it was already performed\n  lawfully it is a complete kiddushin, and the fact that she gave [a\n  ring] and said what she said is simply folly and stupidity. And even\n  if they and the witnesses knew in advance that they would do this –\n  that she would also give a ring and make a declaration – it is not\n  possible to nullify the kiddushin on the basis that this is an\n  indication that they want the kiddushin to be effected also through\n  her giving and speaking. This is so, because even had they explicitly\n  made this a condition, it would be like one who makes a condition\n  about something written in the Torah, which is worthless, and\n  certainly here where it is only an indication. And even if they made a\n  double condition, in accordance with the rules of conditions, that the\n  kiddushin should only take effect if she also gives him a ring\n  afterwards and makes a declaration, the kiddushin certainly takes\n  effect when the condition is fulfilled, just like a condition [that\n  the kiddushin should only take effect] \"if you give me 200 Zuz\" or any\n  condition, and this is obvious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, he spends the rest of the responsum arguing that it is forbidden to do it because it will lead people to think that a woman can perform kiddushin to a man, it will lead to laws of kiddushin being forgotten, and it might even be forbidden as a gentile practice:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אסור לעשות זה לא מבעיא אם מנהג הנכרים הוא כן שהוא איסור מדאורייתא\n  אפילו אם אינו חק לע\"ז אלא חק הבל ושטות שכתבו התוס' בע\"ז דף י\"א דבלא\n  כתיבא באורייתא אף שאינו היפוך דין התורה נמי אסור וכ\"ש בזה שהוא נגד דין\n  התורה ובדיני הנכרים צריכה גם היא לקדש שנמצא שעושין כחק שלהם שודאי הוא\n  באיסור הלאו אלא אף אם אינו כלל חק הנכרים נמי נראה דאסור לעשות כן בשעת\n  החופה אף בלא אמירה ובאמירה אף אח\"כ אם הוא סמוך להחופה דיש לדמות זה\n  להגזירה דהבא ראשו ורובו במים שאובין דא\"ר ביבי א\"ר אסי בשבת דף י\"ד שהוא\n  משום דבתחלה היו טובלין במי מערות מכונסין וסרוחין והיו נותנין עליהן מים\n  שאובין להעביר הסירחון ומ\"מ בא מזה שאמרו לא אלו מטהרין אלא אלו מטהרין\n  אף שהיה ידוע שנתנו המים שאובין להעביר סירחון וכ\"ש הכא שמה שגם היא\n  נותנת טבעת הוא לקידושין שיש לחוש שיבא מזה שיאמרו שגם האשה יכולה לקדש\n  את האיש ואף שעדיין לא נמנו ב\"ד לגזור ואין זה ממילא איסור ממש מ\"מ ודאי\n  זה עצמו שעושין דבר שיכול לבא לזה הוא ודאי ענין איסור  </p>\n  \n  <p>ובעצם נראה לע\"ד שהוא איסור גדול שהרי עי\"ז עושין שישכח מהרבה דין\n  קידושין  ושכחת דין אף שלא יבא לשום קלקול הוא איסור לאו דהא אמר ר\"ל\n  במנחות דף צ\"ט כל המשכח דבר אחד מתלמודו עובר בלאו ולרבינא בשני לאוין\n  ולרנב\"י בג' לאוין וגם עיין ביש\"ש ב\"ק פ\"ד סימן ט' דלשנות הדין אף לצורך\n  גדול ואף כשיש חשש פקוח נפש אסור משום דהוא ככופר בתורת משה והתם איירי\n  בליכא חשש קלקול ומכשול דהא איירי שם בשור של ישראל שנגח שור של עכו\"ם\n  שברור שב\"ד רשאין לחייב להישראל לשלם להעכו\"ם כשיש חשש פ\"נ ומ\"מ לומר\n  שהדין הוא כן אסור אף במקום פ\"נ וא\"כ הוא רק מצד שינוי דין התורה לבד בלא\n  קלקול למעשה מזה ולכן בעושין מעשה שיגרום שישכחו דין האמת ולשנותו לדין\n  אחר עוברין על איסורין אלו ואין להקשות מהא דהקשה אבא על טעם אביי שהטעות\n  היה שאמרו אלו ואלו מטהרין מאי נ\"מ הא קא טבלי בהנך אף דאיכא בזה שכחה\n  ושינוי הדין דהתם הא עשו זה להעביר הסירחון ולא היה להם לחוש שיגרום זה\n  לטעות ולכן אף אחר שראו שגרם זה לשכחת הדין היה זה מגרם רחוק שאין לאסור\n  וגם אולי בכלל אין לאסור לאדם לעשות דבר לצורכו בשביל חשש רחוק כזה מצד\n  איסור דשכחת הדין שהוא ודאי פשיעתם שלא רצו ללמוד ולהשים אל לבם כלל עשה\n  הטעות והוצרך רבא לומר שרק משום שבא ממש קלקול להרבה אנשים לעבור על\n  איסור כרת דנדה וטומאת קדשים גזרו אבל הכא כשירגילו שגם היא תתן טבעת\n  ותקדש שהוא בלא טעם כלל רק לשנות הדין יש לאסור מצד זה עצמו אף אם לא יבא\n  לידי קלקול כלל שלא יטעו לומר שסגי רק בקידושין שלה אלא יאמרו דהדין הוא\n  שצריך שתרוייהו יקדשו נמי הוא איסור גמור וברור מצד שכחת הדין ושינוי\n  הדין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Rakeffet-Rothkoff\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Aaron Rakeffet</a> mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/901488/rabbi-dr-aaron-rakeffet-rothkoff/rav-silver-and-national-kashruth-problems/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a recent lecture</a> (about 36 minutes in) that he once turned down an offer to officiate at a wedding because they wanted a double-ring ceremony. One of the people attending the lecture asked what would be wrong with such a ceremony, and said that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Lookstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Lookstein</a> allowed it. R. Rakeffet said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rav [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph B. Soloveitchik</a>] is gonna walk in and chop your head off in one minute.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The questioner then clarified that he was talking about giving the second ring not as part of the kiddushin/chuppah but afterwards, and R. Rakeffet seemed to agree that that would be okay.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Kiddushin is fundamentally the act of the groom taking the bride, not the other way around or both ways. Hence, a double ring ceremony under the Chuppah would undermine the very mechanics of Kiddushin and is prohibited. Doing so is also a violation of the Torah’s mandate not to imitate non-Jewish practices. (Iggerot Moshe (Even HaEzer vol. 3 Siman 18 and 25, vol. 4 Siman 32:2) and Shu”t HaRishon LeTzion (vol. 1 Even HaEzer 18))</p>\n\n<p>Depending on who’s officiating (such as a Reform or Conservative rabbi) and how they perform the Kiddushin (how the double ring ceremony is understood and presented), Rav Moshe Feinstein holds it could even be null and void. See <a href=\"http://www.rabbis.org/pdfs/Gray_Matter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gray Matter</a> (vol. 1 page 73) for a full discussion of the effectiveness, not the permissibility of the ceremony, as well as Minchat Asher (vol. 1 Siman 72, vol. 2 Siman 98).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The main issue with the double ring ceremony is if the participants consider this to be an 'exchange' of rings, leading to there have been no kiddushin. This can be the case even if one ring is given later; if at the time the woman expected to get back the ring as an exchange.\nHowever if we knew for sure that that was not the intention, there would be no problem.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the later form stated clearly does greatly reduce the chances of a problematic kiddushin, but note: the people involved may <em>still</em> not understand that this is not an exchange and have the intention for one; this means that many people would argue to avoid it completely even before any hashkafic issues are taken into account </p>\n\n\n",

It is because it is a mountain upon which hatred [sina] for the idolaters descended.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, some commentators say it talks about the hatred that God and the Jews have towards the idolaters.  But other commentators say it talks about the hatred that the idolaters have towards the Jews.  (In other words, that antisemitism began with the giving of the Torah, because it preached things the gentiles did not want to hear.)  </p>\n\n<p>The second is compelling.  But the first is bolstered by what the Gemara says later:</p>\n\n<p>[It was called] the Sinai desert, because hatred descended on it. What was its [real] name? Its name was Horeb… because desolation [hurbah] to idolaters descended on it.  [Shabbat 89b]</p>\n\n<p>So which is it?  Both, perhaps?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hatred is more related to a cause in this subject while destruction is a consequence of the hatred.</p>\n\n<p>This idea is all based upon the principle from Shemot Rabbah 12:3, explaining Tehillim 115:16, which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר ה' אל משה נטה ידך על השמים, הדא הוא דכתיב (תהלים קלה, ו): כל אשר חפץ ה' עשה וגו', <strong>אמר דוד אף על פי שגזר הקדוש ברוך הוא (תהלים קטו, טז): <em>השמים שמים לה' והארץ נתן לבני אדם</em>,</strong> משל למה הדבר דומה, למלך שגזר ואמר בני רומי לא ירדו לסוריא ובני סוריא לא יעלו לרומי, <strong>כך כשברא הקדוש ברוך הוא את העולם גזר ואמר: השמים שמים לה' והארץ נתן לבני אדם, כשבקש לתן התורה בטל גזרה ראשונה ואמר <em>התחתונים יעלו לעליונים והעליונים ירדו לתחתונים</em>, ואני המתחיל</strong>, שנאמר (שמות יט, כ): וירד ה' על הר סיני, וכתיב (שמות כד, ט): ואל משה אמר עלה אל ה', הרי כל אשר חפץ ה' עשה בשמים ובארץ וגו'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Prior to the giving of the Torah, there was a limit beyond which, the <em>Lower Realms</em> could not challenge and encroach upon the <em>Upper Realms.</em> This was due to G-d's original decree from the time of creation (<em>that the Heavens belong to G-d and the earth belongs to the children of man</em>) mentioned in the Midrash. That also placed a governor upon the hatred between the two opposites.</p>\n\n<p>When that limit was removed and replaced with a different decree, the hatred increased on both sides.</p>\n\n\n",

Others maintain that witnesses would be required to validate that the husband is the one on the phone directing. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sources to allow such a get are the mishna on Gittin 66a (translation and interpolation by R Steinsaltz)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With regard to one who was thrown into a pit and thought that he would\n  die there, and he said that anyone who hears his voice should write a\n  bill of divorce for his wife, and he specified his name, her name, and\n  all relevant details, those who hear him should write this bill of\n  divorce and give it to his wife, even though they do not see the man\n  and do not know him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara a bit below comments</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Sage from the school of Rabbi Yishmael taught: During a time of\n  danger, when there is the likelihood that the wife would assume\n  deserted wife status, one writes and gives a bill of divorce even\n  though the people instructed to do so are not familiar with the man\n  who gave the instructions. Here too, when a voice is heard from a pit,\n  one writes and gives the bill of divorce, as there is no possibility\n  of properly clarifying the issue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam codifies this as halacha in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957707/jewish/Gerushin-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Gerushin 2:13</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So in case of emergency there is no need to appear in person and someone who knows the caller (in times of danger: even someone who doesn't) would be able to start the <em>get</em> process.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Looks like the Shulchan Aruch has the answer.  Shulchan Arukh, Even HaEzer 141:19:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it is the same regarding someone who was thrown into a pit and\n  said: 'anyone who is able to listen to my voice, go write a divorce\n  bill to my wife', and he makes explicit what are his name and his\n  wife's name, the name of his town and the name of her town, those\n  should write [and deliver] it to her. and even if he was brought up\n  and did not acknowledge [the divorce bill], it is still effective,\n  since it is like [what happens in] a moment of danger: we write and\n  deliver, even if we do not acknowledge [later]. And there are those\n  who say that these words only apply when they saw a figure of a man,\n  or even a faint resemblance, so that one does not suspect it to be a\n  demon, since usually demons are found in pits and fields.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is \"Hinei yomim boim\" - a truncated version of Amos 8:11 sung as though it is words of nechomoh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Posuk 8:11 of Amos says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִנֵּ֣ה יָמִ֣ים בָּאִ֗ים נְאֻם֙ אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִ֔ה וְהִשְׁלַחְתִּ֥י רָעָ֖ב בָּאָ֑רֶץ לֹֽא־רָעָ֚ב לַלֶּ֙חֶם֙ וְלֹֽא־צָמָ֣א לַמַּ֔יִם כִּ֣י אִם־לִשְׁמֹ֔עַ אֵ֖ת דִּבְרֵ֥י יְהֹוָֽה</p>\n<p>Behold days are coming says the Lord God, and I will send famine into the land, not a famine for bread or a thirst for water but [an unfulfilled desire] to hear the words of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי אם לשמוע. שתפסוק מכם רוח הקדש</p>\n<p>They will cease to have ruach hakodesh (divine inspiration).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly the Metzudas Dovid says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי אם לשמוע וגו׳. ר״ל יהיו תאבים אל הנבואה ולא ימצאו כי תפסק הנבואה בהיותם בגולה:</p>\n<p>It is saying that they will desire prophesy and not find it because prophecy will cease in exile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context of the entire chapter 8 of Amos is a kloloh (curse) foretelling tragedy. So why is there a zemer that is often sung at shalosh seodos and other occasions that seem to imply that these are words of nochoma (comfort)?</p>\n<p>To be clear: Rashi and metzudas Dovid are both saying that the lack of prophecy directly causes the \"famine\" in wishing to hear the word of Hashem. This is in distinction to the possibility that there is an additional external force making people wish to hear the word of Hashem in addition to the end of prophecy. This later possible peshat is not anything I have seen in the rishonim. But if it does exist I would very much like to see it.</p>\n<p>[The text of the zemer is הִנֵּה יָמִים בָּאִים ... וְהִשְׁלַחְתִּי רָעָב בָּאָרֶץ לֹא רָעָב לַלֶּחֶם וְלֹא צָמָא לַמַּיִם כִּי אִם לִשְׁמֹעַ אֵת דִּבְרֵי ה’.]</p>\n<p>Links to the zemer:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQiswj_To0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxQiswj_To0</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJASoxnKziQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJASoxnKziQ</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although The words itself in the passuk refer to the tragic situation of the lack of nevuah and Ruach Hakodesh at in Galus, but the passuk also beholds a prophecy of nechamah by stating that there come a time when there will be a hunger/thirst/desire for these lofty things, rather than just famine for bread or a thirst for water.\nThe fact that the lack of Nevuah and Ruach Hakodesh is considered a famine and a hunger by the people is a nechamah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Amos.8.11?lang=bi&with=Midrash%20Lekach%20Tov%20on%20Ruth&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Medrash Lekach Tov</em> on <em>Megillas Rus</em></a> has an interesting insight that mentions this verse (text courtesy of Sefaria.org):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויהי רעב בארץ. עשר פעמים רעבון באו לעולם, אחד בימי אדם הראשון שנ' (בראשית ג' י\"ז) ארורה האדמה בעבורך ואחד בימי למך שנ' (שם ה' כ\"ט) מן האדמה אשר אררה יי', ואחד בימי אברהם שנ' (שם י\"ב י') ויהי רעב בארץ וירד אברהם מצרימה, ואחד בימי יצחק שנ' (שם כ\"ו א') ויהי רעב בארץ מלבד הרעב הראשון אשר היה בימי אברהם, ואחד בימי יעקב שנ' (שם מ\"ה ו') כי זה שנתים הרעב בקרב הארץ, ואחד בימי שפוט השופטים, ואחד בימי אליהו ואחד בימי אלישע שנ' (מלכים ב' ו' כ\"ה) ויהי רעב גדול בשמרון, ואחד בימי דוד שנ' (שמואל ב' כ\"א א') ויהי רעב בימי דוד, ואחד מתגלגל ובא לעולם לעתיד לבא שנ' (עמוס ח' י\"א) לא רעב ללחם ולא צמא למים כי אם לשמוע דברי יי' וכולן לא באו אלא בימי אנשים צדיקים וגבורים שהם יכולין לעמוד בהן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize: There are ten times that major famines occurred in the world; all of them correlate to a different righteous biblical figure, e.g.a famine during the times of Avraham, during the tenures of Eliyahu and Elisha, respecively, etc. The common theme of these \"great hungers\" is that they only come when there are <em>tzadikkim</em> and spiritual heavyweights who are able to endure these trying times.</p>\n<p>The implication is that once again in the end of days there will be a great hunger - a spiritual one - and commensurate with that trial will be individuals who can endure it. While it is <em>prima facie</em> a sobering prophecy there is also a glimmer of hope underlying the words of the <em>Navi</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Considering that the Impossible Burger is is likely to be consumed by consumers in a manner that would create the impression that it is biblically-forbidden <em>basar b'chalav</em> (meat cooked with dairy), e.g. because it is still a relatively unheard of product, shouldn't this argument no longer hold water?  </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, considering that <em>marit ayin</em> seems to be an issue even when one's in private (<em>b'chadrei chadarim</em> - see e.g. Shabbat 64b), shouldn't one need to make it self-evident to <em>any</em> potential onlooker (e.g. including those who don't read English, even if only the English-literate are around) that the product is plant-based?  How would that be accomplished since the product is still relatively unknown (as opposed to, say almond milk or fish blood, both of which are and were potentially well-known, such that <em>any</em> potential onlooker might guess the ambiguous origin based on local clues of almonds or fish scales - see e.g. Ramo Y.D. 87:3, Chakhmath Adam 40:3, Arukh Hashulchan 16, all cited <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Marit_Ayin/Suspicious_actions#Milk_from_Almonds\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>?  </p>\n\n<p>(While apparently the OU had a controversial ruling [mentioned, but not explained, <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Marit_Ayin/Suspicious_actions#cite_note-34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>] for a restaurant that served cheeseburgers with pareve \"cheese\" that they just needed to include language that indicated the cheese's pareve status, this would seem to be harder to control with regard to private consumers and would seem to be more of an issue with a novel, unknown product.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>R Shlomo Aviner was asked about a cheeseburger made with this product and <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2018/05/kosher-cheeseburger.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">answered</a> that it is permissible for two reasons:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>since everyone today has seen and knows veggie burgers, there is no problem of <em>marit ayin</em> </li>\n<li>\"we do not make new decrees\" and our Sages did not make a decree against eating parve burgers with parve cheese</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Hot from the press: the impossible burger was <a href=\"https://www.foodandwine.com/news/first-ever-kosher-cheeseburger-impossible-burger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">just certified kosher</a> by the OU.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In a Hebrew journal titled <a href=\"https://m.ebay.com/itm/Hebrew-HAMASHBIR-in-Honor-of-Rabbi-Ovadia-Yosef-vol-I/371741188802?hash=item568d8062c2:g:MkoAAOSwv0tU6jE0:sc:USPSMedia!10024!US!-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaMashbir</a>, there is an essay (vol. 1 <a href=\"https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?189710&&lang=eng\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">192ff.</a>) on the issue of things (food, clothing etc.) which <strong>appear</strong> to be of prohibited nature but, in actuality, are permissible and its organic composition is common. </p>\n\n<p>The author, R.

Ovadia Yosef (Yabia Omer vol. 6 YD §8) who permitted drinking synthetic milk after meat (though the author argues, after a discussion of ROY's resp., that the latter would permit the consumption even at the meal). </p>\n\n<p>One of the popular examples he cites is the permissibility of wearing shoes on Yom Kippur that look like leather which a number of authorities permit. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I recently saw in kitzur shlchan aruch that if one cooks meat using almond milk one should place almonds on the dish as a sign.

Why does the gemara add that the snake saw their honor and was jealous. He explains the reason why the gemara added that part to the question was to show that this incident took place before the sin of the Eitz Hadaas. Therefore the animals were also immortal since they weren't fed from the tree yet. Therefore it was impossible to have an animal that died on its own then. Thus the gemara assumed Adam killed it.</p>\n\n\n",

Maschil. Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is pardoned.\n  Happy is the man unto whom the LORD counteth not iniquity, and in whose spirit there is no guile.\n  When I kept silence, my bones wore away through my groaning all the day long.\n  For day and night Thy hand was heavy upon me; \n  my sap was turned as in the droughts of summer. Selah\n  I acknowledged my sin unto Thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid; \n  I said: 'I will make confession concerning my transgressions unto the LORD'– \n  and Thou, Thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah\n  For this let every one that is godly pray unto Thee in a time when Thou mayest be found; \n  surely, when the great waters overflow, they will not reach unto him.\n  Thou art my hiding-place; Thou wilt preserve me from the adversary; \n  with songs of deliverance Thou wilt compass me about. Selah</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Most of the text bears this out quite nicely, with the exception of psukim 8 and 9, which to my ears appear to be spoken by HaShem:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אַשְׂכִּֽילְךָ֨ ׀ וְֽאוֹרְךָ֗ בְּדֶֽרֶךְ־ז֥וּ תֵלֵ֑ךְ    אִֽיעֲצָ֖ה עָלֶ֣יךָ עֵינִֽי׃\n  אַל־תִּֽהְי֤וּ ׀ כְּס֥וּס כְּפֶרֶד֮    אֵ֤ין הָ֫בִ֥ין\n  בְּמֶֽתֶג־וָרֶ֣סֶן עֶדְי֣וֹ לִבְל֑וֹם    בַּ֝֗ל קְרֹ֣ב אֵלֶֽיךָ׃</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>\"I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shalt go; I will give counsel, Mine eye being upon thee.\"\n  Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no understanding; \n  whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, that they come not near unto thee.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>רַבִּ֥ים מַכְאוֹבִ֗ים לָרָ֫שָׁ֥ע    וְהַבּוֹטֵ֥חַ בַּֽיהוָ֑ה חֶ֝֗סֶד יְסֽוֹבְבֶֽנּוּ׃\n  שִׂמְח֬וּ בַֽיהוָ֣ה וְ֭גִילוּ צַדִּיקִ֑ים    וְ֝הַרְנִ֗ינוּ כָּל־יִשְׁרֵי־לֵֽב׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Many are the sorrows of the wicked; but he that trusteth in the LORD, mercy compasseth him about.\n  Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous; and shout for joy, all ye that are upright in heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>\"I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go\"</em> is a pretty strange thing to say to Hashem, <em>\"Be not as the horse or as the mule\"</em> is even stranger. </p>\n\n<p>The rest of the psalm, though, is clearly addressed to Him. If it is indeed Hashem speaking these two lines, shouldn't there be more of an indication of that, or a transition of some sort?

I will list some of those which I remember (I do not recall the sources):</p>\n\n<p>1- גדול המצווה ועושה ממי שאינו מצווה ועושה  - Greater is one who is commanded and observes a mitzvah, than one who is not commanded and does it. Since Milah can only be done once, therefore Avraham waited until he was commanded.</p>\n\n<p>2- Avraham was forbidden to circumsize himself because even a non-Jew is forbidden to do damage to his body. חובל בעצמו -  As long as he didn't have the mitzvah it would have been an aveira.</p>\n\n<p>3- A \"bris\" is a covenant. As long as Hashem did not tell him of the bris there was no covenant.</p>\n\n<p>4- R' Chaim brisker said that a bris can only be done on an ערל. Until the mitzvah of milah, Avraham was not considered an ערל.</p>\n\n<p>5- The מהרש\"א says that Avraham only began doing mitzvos after his bris milah.</p>\n\n<p>There are other reasons, and some known difficulties with some of these reasons,  which I don't presently recall. </p>\n\n<p>Question: Since Avraham knew what the Mitzvos would be, and what their details were, Maybe he also knew that (just as Yitzchok's mitzvah of milah was to do it at 8 days old, and Yishmael's mitzvah was to do it at 13 years old) he may have known that his own mitzvah of milah was only for him to do it at the age of 99 years old, and therefore no mitzvah of milah existed for him at all until the age of 99? </p>\n\n\n",

I will bring a number of opinions, from <em>rishonim</em> to <em>aharonim</em>, who strongly limit its scope and thereby explain why women are appointed or elected as shul presidents (the classical case in much of recent rabbinic literature), principals of day schools and other positions of leadership.</p>\n<p>R Howard Jachter provides a good summary <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/women-and-leadership-by-rabbi-howard-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam's major commentaries, the Kesef Mishnah and Radbaz, cite the Sifrei on the aforementioned verse, as the source for\nthe Rambam.  However, the Sifrei merely states, מלך ולא מלכה, that a\nwoman may not be appointed as the nation's leader.  The Rambam does\nnot have an explicit source for the extension of the Sifrei's rule to\nany position of leadership.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>Although the Rambam rules that a woman may not be appointed to a\nposition of authority, Rav Moshe and Rav Chaim David Halevi (the\nSephardic Chief Rabbi of Tel Aviv, in an essay published in Techumin\n01:811-321) note that many Rishonim appear to disagree with the\nRambam.</p>\n<p>Tosafot in Baba Kama 51a (s.v. אשר) write that a woman is permitted to serve as a דיין (a rabbinic judge).  <strong>It is clear that\nTosafot believe that a woman can be appointed to a position of\nauthority.</strong></p>\n<p>The Sefer Hachinuch (Mitzvah 794) cites the Sifrei that a woman may not be appointed as king, yet he does not write that a woman\nmay not be appointed to any position of authority.  Indeed, in the\nnext mitzvah, the prohibition to appoint a convert as king, the Sefer\nHachinuch writes that this law does apply to any position of\nauthority.  <strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein writes that this seems to clearly indicate that\nthe Sefer Hachinuch does not agree with the Rambam.</strong></p>\n<p>Rav Moshe adds that it appears from both Rashi (s.v. כל) and the Ran (s.v. גרסינן) commenting on Kiddushin 67b that they do not\naccept the Rambam's ruling.  Rashi and the Ran explain that the source\nfor the rule that a convert may not be appointed to any position of\nauthority is from an extra word in the Torah מקרב אחיך תשים עליך מלך\n(Devarim 71:51).  The Torah could have merely stated \"שום תשים עליך\nמלך מקרב אחיך.\"  The fact that the Torah adds another \"תשים\" teaches\nthat the rule forbidding appointment of a convert as king applies to\nany position of authority.</p>\n<p><strong>It can be readily inferred from this comment of Rashi and the Ran that\nthey disagree with the Rambam. Finally, the Ramban (Shevuot 03a s.v.\nוכן) and the Rashba (Ibid s.v. ולא) seem to also disagree with the\nRambam.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Modern <em>poskim</em> have different approaches to the issue (the first four are from R Jachter's <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/halachah/women-and-leadership-by-rabbi-howard-jachter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a>)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Moshe Feinstein</a></strong> writes that although many Rishonim disagree with the Rambam, the Rambam's view should be followed in practice.  He explains that since it is a matter of dispute (over a Biblical prohibition) that has not been settled in the Shulchan Aruch, in ordinary circumstances the Rambam should be followed.  Thus, Rav Moshe writes, a woman should not be appointed as the president of a synagogue.  However, in a case of great need, Rav Moshe felt it appropriate to rely on the Rishonim who disagreed with the Rambam.  For example, Rav Moshe permitted a poor widow to be appointed as a Kashrut supervisor, despite the fact that it is a position of authority</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayim_David_HaLevi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Chaim David Halevi</a></strong> writes that the Rambam would explain these historical phenomena by stating that women cannot be imposed as leaders over the people.  However, if the people accept her leadership, then the prohibition seems not to imply, Rav Halevi notes that this seems to follow what the aforementioned Rambam and Rashba said about Devora - she could serve as a ruler because the nation accepted her rulings.  According to Rav Halevi a woman is permitted to be elected to a position of authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben-Zion_Meir_Hai_Uziel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Ben-Zion Meir Uziel</a></strong> (former Sephardic Chief Rabbi of Israel) adopts the same position (Teshuvot Mishpetei Uziel Choshen Mishpat 6)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Amital\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Yehuda Amital</a></strong> adopted this ruling in practice. In 1988 he allowed a woman to be on the parliamentary list of his political party Meimad. He explained that this ruling of the Rambam did not apply to a democratically elected position. According to this approach, it would seem that halacha would sanction a woman serving as a president of a synagogue, if she were to be democratically elected to that position.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Lichtenstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Aharon Lichtenstein</a></strong> noted that it is clear the dati-leumi/Modern Orthodox community and its rabbinic elite have clearly come down in favor of a more narrow reading of the Rambam’s restriction. He pointed to the fact that for the past two decades religious women have run for Knesset as candidates of dati-leumi religious parties across the board and some have served as members of parliament. In addition, a few have served as ministers in coalition governments with the approval (despite an occasional rumble here and there) of the rabbinic leadership of those parties. These have included scholars such as R. Avraham Shapira, R. Mordechai Eliyahu, Rav Yaakov Ariel and others.

[The Gemara deduces from the terminology of the phrase] “over you,” [i.e., when presiding over Jews by birth either as a king, a judge, or any other official, that] from here it is where we require that the official must be: “From among your brothers,” meaning a Jew by birth. However, a convert may judge his fellow convert, [as the requirement of “one from among your brothers” doesn’t apply when presiding over fellow converts].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Assuming the Talmud's inference is based on an equation between the \"you\" of \"אחיך\" and \"עליך\", the logic would seem to apply to women having authority over other women, as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In a responsum about whether women could serve on on a synagogue board, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Ginzberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Louis Ginzberg</a> wrote:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=r8uJAAAAMAAJ&dq=the%20responsa%20of%20professor%20louis%20ginzberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Ma'aneh Levi</a> p. 270</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would go even one step further and maintain that Maimonides would\n  have no objection to women on the boards of synagogues. <strong>What he had in\n  mind was exclusively the administration of city or town affairs.</strong> (My emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Mishnah Berurah (including the Be'ur Halakhah) has a number of idioms for soft stringency, ie for presenting a stringency as a desired objective but not as baseline law. Some statistics from <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/4966640\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Benjamin Brown's article in <em>Contemporary Jewry</em></a> (table on pg 2 of the PDF):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Yeish/tov/nachon/raui lehachmir</em>: 458 times</li>\n<li>... <em>lachush</em>: 223</li>\n<li>... <em>lizaheir / lehizaheir</em>: 104</li>\n<li>... <em>limnoa' / lehimana</em>: 36</li>\n<li><em>Yarei Shamayim yir'eh</em> (or another verb) <em>lehachmir</em>: 35</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>and the oft-quoted <em>baal nefesh yachmir</em> being used the fewest (!):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ba'al Nefesh Yachmir</em>: 24</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Total is 885 soft stringencies. By Comparison, the Shulchan Arukh with Rama invoke these soft stringency terms a total of 104 times. The Mishnah Berurah's contemporary, the Arukh haShulchan (most of which predates the MB, but Arukh Chaim does not), uses them 274 times, in roughly the same proportions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92492#92514\">Oliver's answer</a> addresses the soft stringency concept in general, and I would have posted something similar about Rav Amital, citing a <em>sichah</em> of his that was emailed out by Yeshivat Har Etzion's (Gush's) Virtual Beis Medrash.</p>\n\n<p>So, I will just add something about \"<em>ba'al nefesh yachmir</em>\" in particular.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The first usage in the major codes is the Beis Yoseif. It's not in the Rif, Rambam or Tur. The Beis Yoseif was written by Rav Yosef Caro (who later wrote the Shulchan Arukh), who was among the Qabbalists of Tzefas. So when he says \"<em>nefesh</em>\", he means \"soul\" with the connotations particular to the word \"<em>nefesh</em>\" in Qabbalistic use. In contrast to other possible terms for soul, such as <em>ruach</em> or <em>neshamah</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Nefesh</em> connotes the soul in its basest, most animalistic form. Animals too have <em>nefashos</em> -- which is why the Torah explains (?) the prohibition against consuming meat with circulatory blood in it by saying \"<em>ki hadam hu hanefesh</em> -- because the circulatory blood is [of?] the soul\" of the animal whose flesh one is eating. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.12.23?vhe=Tanach_with_Nikkud&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 12:23</a>, c.f. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.17.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayiqra 17:11</a> for different wording.) Soul as life-force, the impact of living in a body and the power to do that living.</p>\n\n<p>A <em>ba'al nefesh</em> is not everyone who is spiritually inclined. That would likely be the <em>yarei shamayim</em>. Nor is it someone who is worried about legal concerns regarding rejected theory, as there are numerous other terms for that. It is someone trying to overcome their physicality, meaning their bodily desires and laziness.</p>\n\n<p>And this is consistent with the Mishnah Berurah's usages. For example, the first usage: The Shulchan Arukh says that David did not to take a nap during the day that is than the time it takes to make 60 breaths (Orach Chaim 4:16). The Be'ur Halakhah says it's either 3 hours (based on narrative about the Ari's Shabbos nap), a little over 30 min, or 3 min. And then he says the <em>ba'al nefesh</em> should try to minimize according to his abilities.</p>\n\n<p>Mishnah Berurah 299:40 (on OC 299:10) says that a <em>ba'al nefesh</em> should not be lighting a lamp immediately after Shabbos (with a \"<em>Barukh haMavdil</em>) but should wait until after <em>UVa leTzion</em>. (Although the <em>gabbai</em> of the <em>shul</em> should not be stringent in this way, so that he can light the lamps before <em>Borkhu</em> so that people can see their <em>siddurim</em>.) For the <em>ba'al nefesh</em>, wanting more light isn't reason to skimp on holding onto Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>So it would seem to me that \"<em>ba'al nefesh yachmir</em>\" means \"someone who is trying to overcome / who has overcome their physical side, should be stringent\" and not give it a foothold on this issue.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.torahanytime.com/#/speaker?l=828\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

According to the first answer, you would. Because, you borrowed a probably clean eggs, so you must return a probably clean egg. However Rav Elyashiv [quoted in :ספר חשוקי חמד בבא מציעא דף מב] paskens, that if the original owner doesn't sell eggs, the borrower does not have to return an egg, since even if he did not give it to his neighbor, he would discard it. </p>\n\n<p>Now, applying that to your case of 4 eggs, it would seem that returning the forth egg is more than you are obligated and considered Ribbis.</p>\n\n<p>In the case where you borrowed from a store keeper, logic would say that it is not Ribbis. You would actually need to repay him the forth egg, according to Rav Elyashiv's P'sak [regarding Choshen Mishpat].</p>\n\n<p>[<img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DudqE.jpg\" alt=\":חשוקי חמד ב\"מ מב\"></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Rabbi Reissman's seffer on Hilchos Ribbis, he says it is allowed to return the full amount of eggs. The following is a quote from page 34, footnote 10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If someone borrowed a dozen eggs and found that one of them had a blood spot which rendered it non-kosher, he would still be permitted to return a dozen eggs. Anytime a person buys a dozen eggs, there is a possibility that some of them have blood spots. The market value of the eggs which were borrowed took this into account. The eggs which are being returned have the identical value, since some of them might contain blood spots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I received the following answer from \"sabbahillel\" as a comment, with the added note \"Since I do not have a source for this, I am leaving it as a comment\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since there would be no way of being sure that all four eggs have no\n  blood spots, returning 4 clean eggs would probably not be ribbis. One\n  is returning 4 eggs of the same status as those received. That is,\n  <em>probably clean</em>, but not certain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a lecture on the laws of Ribbis which I heard from R' Pinchos Vind Shlita of Yerushalayim, who is a renowned expert on ribbis issues, and author of many works on the subject of ribbis, he mentioned the scenario discussed here, and he ruled that there would be no problem of ribbis in returning 4 eggs. His reasoning for this ruling was exactly the reason given by sabbahillel in his comment, with slight elucidation. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Vind said \"since in todays world, when a person purchases eggs, and finds a bloodspot in one of them, it is accepted that he cannot demand the seller to replace the egg with another one. This shows that the price paid for eggs is for eggs which are \"<em>probably clean</em>\", and thus finding a bloodspot after the purchase does not grant the buyer any right to reimbursement. Based on this, if one borrowed 4 <em>probably clean</em> eggs, and returns 4 <em>probably clean</em> eggs, he is returning eggs of the same value which he borrowed, and no ribbis is involved. The fact that the borrower found a bloodspot in one of the eggs after borrowing the eggs does not change the value of the eggs at the time which they were borrowed.\"</p>\n\n<p>[So, this is the source for Sabbahillel's comment, and thus it is hereby elevated to the status of an Answer.]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Four Pairs of Tefillin: Why only the Shel Rosh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Although not a normative custom, there is a rare custom practiced by lofty individuals to put on four pairs of tefillin (Rashi, Rabbeinu Tam, Shimusha Rabba and Raavad). </p>\n\n<p>In <em>Hayom Yom</em>, the Lubavitcher Rebbe specifies that one who follows this custom should only put on the <em>shel rosh</em> for the Shimusha Rabba and Raavad tefillin, while using the <em>shel yad</em> for Rashi and Rabbeinu Tam respectively (See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5865/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Menachem-Av-19.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5865/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Menachem-Av-19.htm</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Any idea why the custom is to only use the <em>shel rosh</em>? Obviously this is not a regular practice, but still curious. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks! </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It's important to remember that for the arm-Tefillin the four sections are written on one piece of Klaf, while for the head-Tefillin they are written on four separate pieces of Klaf and placed in four separate boxes.</p>\n\n<p>The natural question to ask about the head-Tefillin becomes: do the four sections get inserted from right to left from the perspective of the one wearing the Tefillin or do they get inserted from right to left from the perspective of the one looking at the front of the Tefillin. (This is like how stage-right is <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/house_left#English\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">house-left</a>.) The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=30&daf=34b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 34b</a>) actually quotes different sources that phrase the proper order from different perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>But for the arm-Tefillin where it's all on one piece of Klaf and there are no alternative perspectives, of course you'd write it from right to left like any other Hebrew writing. After all neither side denied that the sections are supposed to be right to left in whatever perspective.</p>\n\n<p>From a Rabbenu-Tam/Raavad perspective, the same argument applies: in the head Tefillin the \"correct\" perspective for reading is from the outside in, so you put section 1 and 3 in an outer box and then 2 and 4 respectively in the box just inward from it. From one side you encounter 1 then 2, and from the other side you encounter 3 then 4. But again for the arm-Tefillin there is only one reasonable perspective to choose: reading in order as written on the single sheet. No one reads from the beginning and end of a single sheet inwards.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Joseph_of_Corbeil\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Semak</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15275&st=&pgnum=139\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">153</a>) indeed writes that no one argues against Rashi about how the arm-Tefillin is written.</p>\n\n<p>I'm certain there are opinions that recommend being strict to write the Klaf for an arm-Tefillin in the same order as the sections of a paired Rabbenu-Tam/Raavad/Shimmusha-Rabba head-Tefillin are placed in their boxes, but you asked why some would be lenient regarding the arm-Tefillin and I'd expect this to be why. </p>\n\n\n",

Who says it, besides the Chasam Sofer?</p>\n\n<p>I checked to see if Rav Saadya Gaon, who lists how the 613 are included in the 10 in his poem known as Azharos (see link above), excludes these three.

A search of the word To'im turned up some commentaries who used the word:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Lekach Tov says, \"ולא כמו שאומרים התועים עצרת לאחר השבת\" seeming\nto point to those who reject the oral law in computing the date for\nShavu'ot, so the \"Torah\" in the following line would be the Oral Law.</p></li>\n<li><p>In his Seder Pesach, Amram Ga'on writes \"ותלמידי ענן ירקב שמו, אבי\nאביו של דניאל, חוט המשולש ברשע ובמינות, שאמר לכל התועים והזונים\nאחריו, עזבו דברי משנה ותלמוד ואני אעשה לכם תלמוד משלי\" referring to a\ngroup that also rejected Oral Law as taught by Chazal (though they\nreplaced it with their own Talmud).</p></li>\n<li><p>The Ibn Ezra on Daniel 11:30 writes, \"One is surprised by Sadducee\nsages who interpreted this as referring to the future. They said that\nthe sanctuary is Mecca, around which the Ishmaelites circle. and they\nput aside the daily sacrifice the five prayers (the Salat). and they\nset up the abomination, idolatry. And <strong>they are the mistaken</strong>. As\nis it may be that miqdash/sanctuary refers to Jerusalem alone.\"\nThough I can't tell if he means that the \"they\" is the Sadducees or\nthe Ishmaelites.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Abarbenel on Bereishit 15 writes, \"כדי לצרוף את בני ישראל\nולהבחינם בקרב מצרים התועים לראות היעמדו באמונתם כמו שהיה ראוי לצרוף\nולזכך העם שהיה עתיד לקבל התורה ולרשת את הארץ ולהדבק בו\" which is\neither pointing to a faction among the Israelites or among the\nEgyptians but not about the Oral Law.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Alshich (Mishlei, 3:1) writes \"הנה עד כה הבדילנו מן התועים\nומפתויי החטאים וילמדנו להקשיב לחכמה אזננו\" which seems to point to a\ngeneric \"sinners\" while the Apiryon (I hope I have the name right) on\nLech Lecha uses the word in reference to those who deny divine\ncreation of the world (לאפוקי דעת התועים ואומרים שהכל הוא בטבע). He\nuses it in a variety of other places to refer to those who deny\nHashem and His power in the world.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So who exactly are the to'im and how are we separated from them? How did this idea become crystallized in this phrase and become such a central part of our prayers? The Aleinu seems to echo some of these ideas but doesn't use the word \"to'im.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8_%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Yehuda bar Yakar</a><sup>1</sup>, in his commentary on this prayer<sup>2</sup>, cites three Biblical sources for this line.

Could you perhaps enlighten the rest of us as to what these two works have to say on this matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>(FTR, in the linked-to shiur the speaker [which, from his voice, sounds like R. Eli Mansour] refers to the “Yayin Ha-meshumar that was written in the 1800s” - except he’s off by 150+ years.)</p>\n\n<p>In the 16th century there was a great controversy surrounding the lenient attitude of Moravian Jews, among others, with regards to the consumption of <em>stam yeinam</em> (wine that came in contact with a gentile). To make things worse, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Moses Isserles</a> penned a responsum (Shu”t Rema <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1204&pgnum=182\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">§124</a>) grasping to justify their prevalent attitude, though he explicitly added that the attitude should not be followed. This caused quite a frenzy among the halachists of that era (to the extent that the responsum was omitted in some editions of his responsa and subsequently rejected as a forgery by some halachic commentators).</p>\n\n<p>At the behest of many rabbis, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Nata_Spira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Nathan Spira</a>, a highly respected rabbi and Kabbalist, authored <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/44454\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yayin HaMeshumar</a> (published first in 1660) detailing the severity regarding these laws both in Jewish law and mysticism. The book carried the approbations of many important rabbis and attached letters of previous rabbis who spearheaded the polemic; <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Josef Karo</a>, to mention one. </p>\n\n<p>The second book, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/21437\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ayuma KaNidgalot</a> was written by R. Isaac Onkeneira and first published in Constantinople 1577. Contrary to the aforementioned <em>shiur</em>-giver, I wouldn’t exactly classify the book as he calls it “a <em>sefer mussar</em>” (book on ethics). It appears to be a hodgepodge of dubious Midrashim (cf. <a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9C_%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%90_%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S. C. Kook</a>’s ‘Iyunim uMechkarim vol. 1, 247ff.), some sprinkling of mysticism, philosophy and ethical lessons in the framework of alphabetic-style poetry. (Kook, ibid., and Isaac Meisles, Tagim 1975 v., p. 43, suggest that the core work is an imitation of the poem by the 15th century scholar R. Solomon Sharbit HaZahav.)</p>\n\n<p>The material germane to the Ben Ish Chai’s discussion on <em>stam yeinam</em>, at OP’s link, is a story the author repeats as told by his father, R. Yehudah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21437&st=&pgnum=56&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 24a</a>). Briefly put: a king invited rabbis to a feast and bid them to demonstrate their loyalty to him by partaking in one of three things: drinking his wine, committing adultery or eating food cooked by his gentile staff (<em>bishul akum</em>). After their reckoning they decided the most lenient option would be to drink the wine [as it was at most <em>stam yeinam</em> and not <em>yayin nesech</em>]. While at the feast and the rabbis were intoxicated the king had the round table shifted and they ate from his food instead of their kosher food and subsequently engaged in adultery, unintentionally, in their intoxicated state. Lesson: even men of stature must be careful consuming wine. (Indeed, the preface to the story is not focused on <em>stam yeinam</em> rather on the good/bad of wine in general.)</p>\n\n\n",

Moving something via another object doesn't make the motion more \"from the side\". Does it mean you're moving the object from <em>your</em> side? But you always move things from <em>your</em> side, as your hands are on your sides. Or does it perhaps mean you're moving the object from <em>its</em> side?

The Yerushalmi says that everything taught by students in foront of their masters was already said to Moshe at Sinai?</p>\n\n<p>Suggested reconciliation:</p>\n\n<p>The words in the Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer read: \"יותר ממה שקבלו מסיני\" more than <em>they</em> received at Sinai, which may be understood to mean that which the <em>B'nei Yisrael</em> learned at Sinai. And the Yerushhalmi says \"נאמר למשה בסיני\" was said to Moshe at Sinai, so it may not be a contradiction, because Maybe Moshe was taught everything, but not B'nei Yisrael, and R' Eliezer taught that which had not been learned by B'nai Yisrael at Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>But, see <em>Orchos Tzadikim</em> - Ways of the Righteous, <em>Sha'ar Hatorah</em> which cites the Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer, and he says \" </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן מצינו ברבי אליעזר הגדול: מתוך שעסק בתורה הרבה, העידו עליו רבותינו\n  זכרונם לברכה שנתגלה לו <strong>מה שלא נתגלה למשה מסיני</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we find with R' Eliezer the Great: since he studied much Torah our Rabbis testified that it was revealed to him even that which was <strong>not revealed to Moshe at Sainai</strong>\".</p>\n\n<p>So according to the understanding of The <em>Orchos Tzadikim</em> R' Eliezer taught  words of Torah in excess of even what Moshe received at Sinai.

David Luria in his commentary to the statement in Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer. He notes that it appears to be contradictory to the statement about all future Torah being already said to Moshe at Sinai. He states that this is resolved with the textual emendation attributed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Elija of Vilna</a>, which replaces the words \"שקיבלו מסיני\" with \"שקיבל ממני\", in which case R. Yochanan Ben Zakai was referring to himself, not to Moshe.</p>\n\n<p>In your edit you note that the Orchos Tzadikim has a version of the text which clearly states \"that was not revealed to Moshe at Sinai\", and thus the question remains how the author would address the above contradiction. This too is addressed by R. David Luria, and he suggests that R. Yochanan Ben Zakai was specifically referring to the reasons for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_heifer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Red Heifer</a>, which is already established by other midrashim as something that was revealed to R.

Occasionally, the hallway gets a bad odor from patients. On the other side of the shul wall is a dialysis center, and while most of the time there is no problem, occasionally a foul odor passes through the wall.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the patients that join the minyan may have \"accidents\" during davening. We had this a few weeks ago, and we had to end davening prematurely. (Someone proposed continuing outside on the patio, but we couldn't move about 5 patients all in wheel chairs.)</p>\n\n<p>Considering all these factors, there's a fairly high possibility of having a foul odor occur during the services, esp. on Shabbat or Yom Tov when services are longer (as quickly as we try to make it, anyway.)

Therefore, it is stated with regard to them,“a waving before the Lord” (verse 13), for even they were assigned holy work-the curtains and the clasps, which could be seen in the Holy of Holies.

That involved shaving all his air, bathing in water and staying in his tent seven days (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.14.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 14:8</a>).</p></li>\n<li><p>in our parasha, the Torah tells us how the Levites had to undergo a purification procedure similar to the <em>metzora</em> (explains <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.8.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.8.7.2&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> to Bamidbar 8:7: because the Levites were serving in the Mishkan as atonement for the idol worship of the golden calf and both idol worship and the <em>metzora</em> are connected to death in various verses)</p></li>\n<li><p>this is why Rashi connects both the waving of the Levi with the waving of the <em>metzora</em>'s offering.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>We see a similar analogy a verse before (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.8.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:10</a>) where the community of Israel leans their hands on the Levites. <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578193288.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Artscroll</a> brings Divrei David (a commentary of Rashi by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_HaLevi_Segal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taz</a>) who explains the Levites bodies were viewed as offerings on behalf of the entire nation of Israel (since they were chosen to assist in the Temple instead of all firstborns<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [Bamidbar 3:12]</a>). Thus the entire nation served in the role of the owner of an offering who stands next to his sacrifice and leans his hands upon it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This waving can also be viewed with a symbolic interpretation (although this does not preclude the more literal understanding). This lifting and waving was a gesture in which Aharon essentially elevated his sons preparing them for their holy service. This idea is asserted by Rav Shimshon Raphael Hirsch on the pasuk (found <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/8.11#e0nf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) who notes that the whole process was an expression of dedication and turning to Hashem.</p>\n<p>He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והניף אהרן וגו׳ – שלוש פעמים נעשית ״תנופה״ בחינוך זה של הלויים: בפסוקים יא, יג, טו. משמעות התנופה ידועה כביטוי של הקדשה, ייעוד והכוונה (עיין פירוש, שמות כט, כב–כה). הלויים כאן נכנסים לעבודתם על ידי שלוש הקדשות, כמבואר בפסוקים טז–יט: ישראל מקדיש אותם לה׳, ה׳ מקדיש אותם לאהרן, אהרן ובניו מקדישים אותם לעבודת המקדש. נמצא שהלויים תופסים את מעמדם וממלאים את תפקידם, בשם ה׳, בשם העם ובשם אהרן, ושלוש בחינות אלו של ייעודם מובאות לידיעתם על ידי שלוש התנופות. כאן בפסוקנו מופיעה תחילה הקדשת הלויים אל ה׳ על ידי ישראל: ״והניף וגו׳ לפני ה׳ מאת בני ישראל והיו לעבד את עבדת ה׳⁠ ⁠״</p>\n<p>*<em><strong>Aharon shall lift up</strong></em> <em>- Three times (it mentions how they were) \"waved\" with the training of the Leviim: in verses 11, 13 and 15. The implication is that the waving is an expression of dedication/holiness of their mission and intention (see the explanation on Exodus 29:22-25). The Leviim here entered into their service via three dedications like we explained in verses 16-19: Israel dedicates themselves to Hashem, Hashem presents them to Aharon, and Aharon and his sons dedicate them to the service in the sanctuary. <strong>So we find that the Leviim (lit.) grabbed their position and fulfilled their duties in the name of Hashem, in the name of the people and in the name of Aharon and these three relationships of their role was brought to their attention through these three wavings.</strong> Here in our verses it first appears that the Leviim are being dedicated to Hashem by the nation: \"And Aharon shall offer the Levites before the Lord for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may carry out the service of Hashem.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Hertz Chumash (page 606) says that \"the Levites were probably led backwards and forwards by Aharon in the direction of the Holy of Holies, or he may have only waved his hand over them.\"</p>\n\n<p>On the Chabad web site, Rashi's comment is about the [cleansing of a] metzora (leper) and the wave offering brought by the metzora (one afflicted with tzara’ath):\n\"in the same way that the guilt-offering of one afflicted with tzara’ath requires waving [the animal] while it is alive.\" (He says there were three wavings for the sons of Aharon - Kohath, Gershon and Merari.)</p>\n\n<p>One comment I saw referenced 2 Kings 5.11 (\"But Naaman was wroth, and went away, and said: 'Behold, I thought: He will surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the L-RD his G-D, and wave his hand over the place, and recover the leper.\"\nEventually, Naaman was cleansed and had faith in HaShem. 5.15, 17 but what stands out to me is the humility eventually shown by Naaman: 5.13, 14\n\"if the prophet had bid thee do some great thing [...] when he saith to thee: Wash, and be clean?' 14 Then went he down, and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the saying of the man of G-D; and his flesh came back like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. \")</p>\n\n<p>Anyways, I was thinking that perhaps Aharon \"lifted and waved\" his sons [when they were at a young age] as representatives of the Tribe of Levi.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# No true novel Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If Kohelet said there is nothing new under the sun, then can there ever really be a novel Torah? Also, could it be that the Torah we deem as novel is really just dvar Torahs that were conceived in a past gilgul?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It depends what Midrash you’re reading.</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand we have the Gemara, Shabbos 30b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכתיב (קהלת א, ג) מה יתרון לאדם בכל עמלו שיעמול תחת השמש ואמרי דבי ר' ינאי תחת השמש הוא דאין לו קודם שמש יש לו</p>\n  \n  <p>As it’s written (Koheles 1:3): “What benefit is there to a person in all of his labor which he works under the sun?” And the academy of R’ Yannai said: “‘Under’ the sun is where he doesn’t have; ‘before’ the sun he has.” </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi explains, this means that if one toils in Torah, which was created before the sun, he is exempt from this teaching of Koheles, and he will reap its rewards. </p>\n\n<p>We see from here that “under the sun” excludes Torah; therefore, it’s logical to apply this to our verse, in 1:9, which says that there is nothing new “under the sun” - but Chiddushim are new. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi, while not going on that particular exposition, says a similar thought on Koheles 1:9 itself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מַה שֶּׁהָיָה הוּא שֶׁיִּהְיֶה וְגוֹ'. בְּכָל־מַה שֶּׁהוּא לָמֵד בְּדָבָר שֶׁהוּא חֲלִיפֵי הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ, אֵין בּוֹ חִדּוּשׁ; לֹא יִרְאֶה אֶלָּא מָה שֶּׁהָיָה כְבָר, שֶׁנִּבְרָא בְשֵׁשֶׁת יְמֵי בְרֵאשִׁית. אֲבָל הַהוֹגֶה בַתּוֹרָה, מוֹצֵא בָהּ תָּמִיד חִדּוּשֵׁי טְעָמִים, כְּעִנְיָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר, \"דַּדֶּיהָ יְרַוּוּךָ בְכָל־עֵת\". מָה הַדַּד הַזֶּה, כָּל־זְמַן שֶׁהַתִּינוֹק מְמַשְׁמֵשׁ בּוֹ מוֹצֵא בוֹ טַעַם, אַף דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה כֵּן. וְכֵן מָצִינוּ בְמַסֶּכֶת חֲגִיגָה, שֶׁאָמַר רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר בֶּן־הוֹרְקְנוֹס דְּבָרִים שֶׁלֹּא שְׁמָעָתַן אֹזֶן, בְּמַעֲשֵׂה מֶרְכָּבָה: </p>\n  \n  <p>“That which was is that which will be.” In whatever he learns, if it’s in exchange for the sun [i.e. for a livelihood], there is nothing new. He will only see that which was already, which was created during the six days of Creation. But one who speaks in Torah, he will find new flavors in it constantly. This is like that which is said, “Her breasts will feed you at all times.” Just as this breast, whenever the infant suckles on it, he finds flavor, so, too, are the words of Torah. So do we find in Maseches Chagigah, that R’ Eliezer Ben Hurkanis said things which nobody had previously heard regarding the Ma’aseh Merkavah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That’s a very nice answer, but there’s an alternative one: the OP’s assumption is actually correct. </p>\n\n<p>Says the Midrash in Koheles Rabbah (editions vary, but in mine it’s in 1:10):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יֵשׁ דָּבָר שֶׁיֹּאמַר רְאֵה זֶה חָדָשׁ הוּא, כְּתִיב (דברים ט, י): וַיִּתֵּן ה' אֵלַי אֶת שְׁנֵי לוּחֹת הָאֲבָנִים כְּתֻבִים בְּאֶצְבַּע אֱלֹהִים וַעֲלֵיהֶם כְּכָל הַדְּבָרִים, אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי, עֲלֵיהֶם, וַעֲלֵיהֶם, כָּל, כְּכָל, דְּבָרִים, הַדְּבָרִים, הַמִּצְוָה, כָּל הַמִּצְוָה, לְלַמֶּדְךָ שֶׁמִּקְרָא וּמִשְׁנָה הֲלָכוֹת תּוֹסֶפְתּוֹת וְהַגָּדוֹת וּמַה שֶּׁתַּלְמִיד וָתִיק עָתִיד לְהוֹרוֹת, כְּבָר הָיָה וְנִתַּן הֲלָכָה לְמשֶׁה מִסִּינַי, מִנַיִן, מִמַּה שֶּׁכָּתוּב יֵשׁ דָּבָר שֶׁיֹּאמַר רְאֵה זֶה דָּבָר חָדָשׁ הוּא, וַהֲרֵי חֲבֵרוֹ מוֹכִיחַ עָלָיו כְּבָר הָיָה לְעוֹלָם.</p>\n  \n  <p>“There will be a thing which you will say, ‘See, this is new!’” It is written (Devarim 9:10): “And Hashem gave to me the two stone tablets, written with the Finger of G-d, and upon them was like all the words [that were on the first ones].” Said R’ Yehoshua Ben Levi: “[Instead of] ‘On them’ [it says] ‘“and” on them.’ [Instead of] ‘all’ [it says] ‘“like” all.’ [Instead of] ‘words’ [it says] ‘“the” words.’ [Instead of] ‘the commandment’ [it says] ‘the “entire” commandment.’ This teaches you that Tanach, Mishnah, Halacha, Tosefta, Aggadah, <strong>and that which a conscientious student will teach in the future - they already existed and were given to Moshe on Sinai.</strong> How do I know this? From that which it says, ‘There is a thing which you will say, “See, this is new!”’ - and his friend will rebuke him, “‘It already was in the world!’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there’s two lines of thought. One is that, indeed, Chiddush is not such a Chiddush, and the other (which I’ve heard quoted much more often), that Chiddushim are actually exempt from “nothing is new under the sun.”</p>\n\n\n",

Are there any exceptions? For number three, is there a consensus on what consitutes a long vowel?</p>\n\n<p>Are there any further instances where a <em>sh'va</em> is <em>na</em>?</p>\n\n<p>As a starting point I have heard the word רִצְפַת (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c3301.htm#6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Esther 1:6</a>) read with a <em>sh'va na</em> on the <em>tzadi</em>, as well as the word הַמְבֹרָךְ (as part of tefillah) with a <em>sh'va na</em> on the <em>mem</em>. What rule(s) are these following?</p>\n\n<p><sup>* Thanks to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1569/b-a\">b a</a> for looking it up in the original book!</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I want to simplify this whole thing for you: Shva is na` at the beginning of a syllable.</p>\n<p>That’s pretty much it.</p>\n<p>Now, how can you tell if a letter is at the beginning of a syllable?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it’s at the beginning of a word, it obviously starts a new syllable. If it’s at the end of a word, it does NOT start a new syllable. This rule overrides all othersᶜ, and is unbreakableᶜ.</li>\n<li>If it has a Dagesh Chazzaq, the letter both ends the previous syllable, and starts a new one. Therefore, a Shva under such a letter is na` (e.g. וַתְּכַבֵּד, /vat-<strong>te</strong>-chab-ˈbēd/).</li>\n<li>If the <em>previous</em> vowel is an <em>inherent long vowel</em>, the Shva is na`. The long vowels are קמץ גדול, צירי, חיריק מלא, חולם, and שורוק. An <em>inherent</em> long vowel is when a given word always has that vowel, regardless of its syntactical position. For example, לַיְלָה is usually has a פתח; but at a major break in a verse (signified by an אתנח/אתנחתא or a סוף־פסוק trope), it takes a קמץ instead (לָיְלָה). This קמץ is <em>not inherent</em>, so the Shva under the following י remains silent. On the other hand, a word like שֹׁמְרֶיךָ ALWAYS starts with a Cholam, regardless of its position in a verse; thus, the Cholam is an <em>inherent</em> long vowel, and the following Shva is na` (/shō-<strong>me</strong>-ˈrē-cha/).ᵃ</li>\n<li>When there are two Shvas in a row (in the middle of a word), you will find that the first Shva always ends the previous syllable. This means that the following letter, with the second Shva, starts the next syllable. Therefore, the first Shva is silent, and the second Shva is na` (e.g. יִשְׁמְרוּ, /yi<strong>sh-me</strong>-ˈrū/).¹</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Here are some small notes, not so much “rules”:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If an identical letter follows a Shva nach (e.g. הַלְלוּ), the shva is pronounced, but very weakly, even relative to other Shvas. Its only purpose is to separate between the letters.ᵃ</li>\n<li>Most non-inherent long vowels are stressed.</li>\n<li>Because Shva na`s are so weak, they never occur in closed (consonant-final) syllables. Thus, in words ending with two Shvas, <em>both</em> Shvas are nach (e.g. נֵרְדְּ, וַיִּשְׁבְּ).</li>\n<li>A Shva after a word-initial Cholam (e.g. וּבְכֹל) is almost always nach. (Side point—the Cholam itself is pronounced /wu/, not just /ū/.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>רִצְפַת in Ester is something of an exception. This shva is only pronounced to differentiate this word, meaning \"floor\", from an otherwise identical one meaning \"hot coal\". In a good Tikkun, you'll find that the chiriq under the Resh has a ga'ya, indicating that the vowel is long. (Thus: /r<strong>ī-ṣe</strong>-fat/)</p>\n<p>When a מ or ל following the definite article (הַ) happens to have a Shva, the Shva is <strong>na`</strong>, but the letter doesn’t have the expected Dagesh. The reason is that they originally <em>did</em> have the dagesh, but it was lost over time because of the \"weak\" nature of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonorant\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sonorants</a>. (In Masoretic manuscripts, the preceding Patach usually takes a ga’ya, indicating that it should be lengthened. This preserves the Masoretic rule that two CV syllables cannot follow each other, by changing the first syllable to CV<strong>ː</strong>).</p>\n<p>When a י occurs after any of the prefixes that normally cause a dagesh in the following letter (מִ־, וַ־, שֶׁ־, הַ־, בַ־, כַ־, לַ־), and the י takes a Shva, it does not receive the expected dagesh, and the Shva is <strong>silent</strong>. However, if the י precedes ע or ה, it is treated as a normal letter and receives a Dagesh Chazzak, so the Shva is na`\\ (e.g. לַיְּהוּדִ֕ים in אסתר ח׳)ᵇ. This is probably due to a more advanced version of the process that occurred with the other sonorants, מ and ל.</p>\n<p>Another exception: שְׁתַּיִם and שְׁתֵּי begin with a silent Shva. That’s why the following ת takes a Dagesh Qal. (In fact, a few Mizrahi communities pronounce it as <strong>אֶ</strong>שְׁתַּיִם—a Minhag mentioned in several Masoretic sources as having been quite common).</p>\n<p>All these rules apply to all reading traditions. Due to a series of mistaken Ashkenazi grammarians in the 14th to 18th centuries, some Ashkenazim are less careful with Shva (especially note #4); but by now, those groups are a minority.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>ᵃ<sub> In fact, in the Masoretic era, this wasn’t the case: All such Shvas were silent. Nowadays, it has become the <em>universal</em> practice to pronounce the Shva as I wrote. Those who don’t are not attempting to follow the Masoretes; rather, they’re either misinformed (see last paragraph) or uneducated.</sub></p>\n<p>ᵇ<sub> A meta-meta-exception is כַּיְעֵנִים in איכה ד׳.</sub></p>\n<p>ᶜ<sub> Except in a couple of words; see penultimate paragraph</sub></p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sources (several more pending):</p>\n<p>¹<sub> דקדוקי הטעמים §11 (סדר שוא)</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes your Rule 3. is incomplete.</p>\n<p>There is some description at <a href=\"https://forum.unilang.org/viewtopic.php?t=50118&start=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this unilang  forum link</a>\nThat Bachur/Levita identified(or came up himself!), 5 rules.

(The rule is often misstated as just after a long vowel)</p>\n<p>(rule 3 is weird because it means it can even be after a short vowel)\na simpler form of rule 3 would be long vowel with no primary stress.. but it is more complex than that.. as noted above..</p>\n<p>Other cases to know about besides those 5 rules, are vav patach prefix, and vav shuruk prefix. I mention details re those below..</p>\n<p>And another thing to know about is meteg can play a role according to some traditions, maybe moreso sephardi tradition.</p>\n<p>And worth bearing in mind that in ashkenazi tradition i'm not sure if there is a long/short kamatz, given that in ashkenazi tradition the kamatz mark has one pronunciation.</p>\n<p>In the case of a vav shuruk prefix, I don't know whether it's a long vowel or a short vowel. But either way,  if there's a shva following it, then in ashkenazi tradition, it's a silent shva. Like oov-shochbecha in the shema, even though there's a meteg there. (Though sure, when many of us were in school, with our ashkefardi pronunciation, we learnt it as oo-vuh-shochbecha and didn't think twice about it!). In Sephardi tradition, maybe when there's a meteg with the vav shuruk prefix, they vocalize the shva.</p>\n<p>Our instincts may say for HalVeeyim vs HaLuhVeeyim, that it's vocal but actually it's silent. It's following a patach.  Sometimes its a patach with a meteg.  According to the book \"Chanting The Hebrew Bible\" by Joshua Jacobson, P267 there is a difference of opinion re whether it's vocal when there is a meteg.   I think I learnt it as halveeyim, and I think that's what ashkenazi tradition is. Especially since vav shuruk with meteg in ashkenazi tradition is still silent shva.</p>\n<p>P.268 Jacobson gives some interesting sources regarding the vav shuruk with meteg.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>קֵ֔דְמָה  Lev 1:16</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0C9OZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0C9OZ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>shva (there), is preceded by a tsere, tsere is a long vowel. But there is primary stress on that syllable with that vowel. So it doesn't match that rule(it doesn't match any rule , for it being vocal), so it's silent.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>There is a point about nasog achor,that could shift stress, and if a verb or noun has a suffix then perhaps stress might shift or a vowel might shift.. and one should look at the word without the suffix and correcting also for any nasog achor. So, after reversing any effect of nasog achor or suffixes.. Then see if the long vowel preceding the shva, has no primary stress, if it has no primary stress, then it's shva na(vocal shva). As rule 3 says \"after a tenua gedolah(long vowel), where the long vowel has no primary stress.....\", but one must look at the word with the vowel it has when without the suffix.</p>\n<p>So for example, gemu-luh-chem(joel 4:4)..</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F0zJstuV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/F0zJstuV.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>we see from the Feldheim Tanach Simanim that it has a vocal shva, even though it's preceded by a kubutz, which is a short vowel</p>\n<p>To see why, we have to look at the word without a suffix.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 35:4</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdmYyra4.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DdmYyra4.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>the word when without the suffix, it's gemul with a shuruk. Shuruk is a long vowel. So if we take the word \"gemulchem\"(leaving open the question of whether it's a vocal shva or a silent shva), and ask, is it ge-mul-chem(i.e. silent shva) or is it gemu-luh-chem(i.e. vocal shva). It's vocal shva, because one works out the shva as if it were a shuruk there.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4p70A.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4p70A.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V1OMT.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V1OMT.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And it's not a conjunctive shuruk.. a conjunctive vav shuruk i.e. a conjunctive vav followed by a Bet Mem or Peh, then that may actually be another shva rule.. (but either way there's an important note regarding it that i'll mention)</p>\n<p>A Shuruk, that's not a conjunctive vav shuruk, is a long vowel.</p>\n<p>We see that vav shuruk is in the middle of the word, so it's not a conjunctive vav.</p>\n<p>We treat that word  / read that word like it's with a vav shuruk, rather than a kubutz.

Gemu-luh-chem</p>\n<p>For a different example.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a Meteg can indicate that a shva is vocal.</p>\n<p>The rule with the kamatz is clear(the meteg makes the kamatz long) and thus the shva vocal.</p>\n<p>Exodus 31:16   (shabbat morning kiddush)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/grzWP9Iz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/grzWP9Iz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Ve-Sha-muh-ru (sephardi)</p>\n<p>Ve-Sho-muh-ru (ashkenazi)</p>\n<p>It's a vocal shva</p>\n<p>In that instance it's not really the meteg making/indicating the shva vocal . It's the meteg making/indicating that the kamatz is long, and that long vowel, making the shva vocal.</p>\n<p>But there are some complexities with the meteg, including some unknown complexities</p>\n<p>From Jacobson, P289  it looks like, when a word begins with Vav and patach then yud with shva, there is or tends to be a meteg there, but regardless of that meteg, the shva is silent. I think i've seen this in Feldheim too, how they do things there. So Gen 34:20  VayDabru not VaYuhDabru.    Gen 1:5 vay-hee not va-yuh-hee,  Gen 5:6 vay-chee, not va-yuh-chee.  (Many [casual] leiners i've heard do a vocal shva there but apparently really serious leiners would do a silent shva there matching what Jacobson wrote)</p>\n<p>And this rule mentioned in Jacobson P289, and i've heard from a really serious grammarian too.\nvav shuruk with meteg.     The famous example is Oov-shochbecha in the Shema.   Deut 6:7 (oov-shochbecha). There's a meteg there.  Ashkenazim do a silent shva there. Maybe sephardim do a vocal one.  The Sacks singers siddur mixes traditions up on that and has a vocal shva, there was quite a disagreement in connection with that, the singers sacks had oo-vuh-shochbecha.  The Koren Sacks siddur, has Oov-shochbecha.</p>\n<p>Another case and this one it's not clear from jacobson's book how one determines this. It says P289 regarding a meteg indicating a 'missing letter' (by which he means a word written in shorter form spelling than 'normal'). As in spelling can be ktav hasar(short) or ktav male(full). And he gives examples of a meteg with a chirik, where the chirik is not a chirik yud. And he's saying it should be treated like the vowel is long (chirik yud). And so any following shva is long.  Similarly he gives an example of a meteg with a kubutz, and says that any following shva should be treated as long, as if it were preceded by a shuruk. Gen 48:20 Yuh-Shee-muh-cha (as opposed to Yuh-Shim-Cha),   Deut 28:11 vehoh-tee-ruh-cha(as opposed to Ve-Hoh-Tir-Cha). Maybe the rule is the rule about removing the suffix though he doesn't mention that rule.   P288-291 have 17 observations regarding \"secondary stress\" i.e. meteg.</p>\n<p>A strange one is on the bottom of P288 Jacobson. Strange 'cos what Jacobson says there isn't reflected in Feldheim's tanach simanim  Num 20:19 Bamsila or Ba-muh-sila  Jacobson says is vocal. Feldheim tanach simanim has it silent.</p>\n<p>And other than that, there are some unknown complexities with the meteg. Jacobson mentions different types of Meteg, including a normal one, and a \"euphonic\" one, and Jacobson says a shva following a euphonic meteg, is silent.  Jacobson P293 quotes a grammarian Yedidyah Norzi who says that the rule for when a meteg is euphonic is not clear / we don't have a straight/valid rule to determine that, and if anybody were to pronounce a euphonic meteg as vocal then it'd some strange to the listener</p>\n<p>Jacobson P.293 quotes Grammarian Yedidyah Norzi to say that they don't have a straight and valid rule to differentiate when a meteg is a \"euphonic meteg\".  Whether he is indicating that this affects pronunciation or not,  I don't know.  And Jacobson suggests on P292 that a euphonic meteg is silent. And on P291 says that a euphonic meteg is a meteg in a seemingly inexplicable position.</p>\n<p>Jacobson P289 mentions Gen 34:20  VayDabru (vav patach and meteg), but silent shva. And other examples.  The vav patach prefix with meteg, followed by shva, then the shva seems to be silent.  but apparently some disagree.</p>\n<p>I guess that experienced baal koreh probably know the problematic or difficult ones from memory and have some decision based on a particular source. And they might also work the difficult ones out in their head, but given particular traditions.</p>\n<p>In the case of the Shema, and Oov-Shochbeca(Ashkenazi way).</p>\n<p>Note-the artscroll ashkenazi siddur puts a horizontal line above a letter with a vocal shva where the letter is in the middle of a word. So given that it has no line over the \"vet\" of oov-shochbecha it's indicating a silent shva there.  The Sacks Singers has any vocal shva when occurring as not the first letter, as bold. It takes the vet as having a vocal shva, you see it puts the shva in bold, so it goes the sephardi way there.</p>\n<p>We see the Artscroll Ashkenazi getting it correct as per ashkenazi tradition.  The Singers Sacks picks the Sephardi way for that.  (I don't know whether singers sacks is consistently sephardi but it is certainly not consistently ashkenazi).  The Feidheim Tanach Simanim, like the ashkenazi artscroll, have it right as per ashkenazi tradition. oov-shochbecha.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pTm1V.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pTm1V.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PcigO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/PcigO.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Interestingly, and this is wild. The Artscroll Siddur Ahavat Shalom, 2nd edition 8th impression 1996 .. Has vocal shva there for that word. And it says Ashkenaz on it.  So, that's strange. I know from baal koreh, including ones that know biblical hebrew that it should be oov-shochbecha in ashkenazi tradition. So I will check with artscroll what is up there with there ahavat shalom siddur.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>@barlop, you must be looking at a very early Artscroll siddur. The first edition from the 1980's did have <strong>ובשכבך</strong> with a shva nach, but they soon changed it to a shava na in later editions of all their siddurim.</p>\n<p>At that time, I had heard that they originally followed one opinion, and then subsequently switched to a different opinion. If that rumor was true, those must be the two opinions you quoted from Jacobson P267. I don't have access to Jacobson, but I believe those two opinions are discussed in <em><strong>גליון 116 - תורת הקורא פרשת בראשית תשע''ו</strong></em> footnote <em><strong>ח</strong></em>, linked to <a href=\"https://forum.otzar.org/viewtopic.php?t=10317&start=360#p310782\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230912150629/https://forum.otzar.org/download/file.php?id=37512\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">archive</a>). I am by no means an expert, but my understanding of that discussion is that all agree that a meteg under the shuruk at the beginning of a short word indicates a shva na. Hence the shin in <strong>הטה... אזנך ושמע</strong> (דניאל ט:יח) (found in the long tachanun on Mondays and Thursdays) has a shva na. For long words, there are opinions (ר' שבתי סופר, רוו\"ה, הגר\"א, ועוד) that the meteg also indicates a shva na. The other opinion (הבחור) is that in such a case the meteg is a \"<strong>מתג כבד</strong>\" and does not indicate a shva na.</p>\n<p>I am not sure what the Ashkenazi minhag is with regard to this, or whether there's an Ashkenazi minhag at all, but it's worth noting that the opionions that it is a shva na is attributed there to Ashkenazi grammarians.</p>\n\n\n",

You're in a tough situation, living in a family which I assume is not interested in keeping Torah. You also have a non-Jewish father, which complicates things.

However, according to a beraita in Seder Olam [which places Creation at 3760 BCE] and the gemara in Bava Batra 4a, the Second Temple stood for only 420 years.

It will be seen that the allowance, contrary to historical facts, of only thirty-four years for the Persian domination is necessary if agreement with the Biblical text is to be insisted upon; for it is stated (Dan. ix. 24) that the second exile was to take place after seventy Sabbaths of years (= 490 years). If from this number the seventy years of the first Captivity be deducted, and the beginning of Alexander's domination over Palestine be placed, in accordance with Talmudical evidence, at 386 years before the destruction of the Second Temple, there remain only thirty-four for the Persian rule.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Suggested Further Reading: <strong>Seder Olam: The Rabbinic View of Biblical Chronology</strong>, Heinrich Guggenheimer, editor.

Serving God for\n  the sake of reward leads to serving him for its own sake, but such a\n  person is still \"far from perfection\" (chapter 16), and that at the\n  beginning of the book, the reader isn't expected to be at such a level</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>because the MY writes clearly in his opening statement, that he is teaching us במה צריך שישים מבטו ומגמתי בכל מה שהו עמל <strong>כל ימי חייו</strong>ת - to what he needs to direct his gaze and his aspiration in <strong>all that he toils all the days of his life</strong>\" so this is obviously not just a beginners's entry level exercise, but rather the ultimate end toward which one toils and aspires all his life.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question is essentially how the Mesilat Yesharim can say a person should always aspire towards the reward of the World to Come, against the other sources which say a person shouldn't serve God in order to merit the World to Come.</p>\n<p>The Ramchal himself explains clearly (in Mesilat Yesharim chapter 19) that the ideal isn't the reward in the World to Come, but to serve God in order to increase God's honor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמנם ודאי שמי שמתכוין בעבודתו לטהר נפשו לפני בוראו, למען תזכה לשבת את פניו בכלל הישרים והחסידים, לחזות בנועם ה' לבקר בהיכלו, ולקבל הגמול אשר בעוה\"ב לא נוכל לומר שתהיה כונה זו רעה.</p>\n<p>אכן לא נוכל לומר גם כן שתהיה היותר טובה, כי עד שהאדם מתכוין לטובת עצמו, סוף סוף עבודתו לצורך עצמו.</p>\n<p>אך הכונה האמתית המצויה בחסידים אשר טרחו והשתדלו להשיגה, הוא <strong>שיהיה האדם עובד רק למען אשר כבודו של האדון ב\"ה יגדל וירבה</strong>.</p>\n<p>However, he whose motivation in his divine service is to purify his soul before his Creator in order to be worthy of sitting among the Just and the Pious, \"to gaze upon the pleasantness of G-d and to dwell within His sanctuary\", and receive the reward in the World to Come, we certainly cannot say that his motive is evil.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we also cannot say that this is the best of motives. For as long as a person is motivated by his own benefit, in essence, his divine service is for his own self-interest.</p>\n<p>But the true motivation which is found among the Pious, who have exerted themselves and strove to attain it, is <strong>for one to serve solely in order to raise and increase the honor of the Master, blessed be He</strong>.</p>\n<p><sub>(translation copied from <a href=\"https://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The easiest answer is that the Mesilat Yesharim is written for gradual improvement. His statement about thinking about the World to Come is only the motivation for someone at a low level, whereas someone who is at the level of piety (חסידות) should serve only for God's honor with no thought of reward.</p>\n<p>This would be similar to the different motivations he gives for different groups of people in chapter 4, which are focused on reward and punishment at worst, and self-improvement at best. Serving God for the sake of reward leads to serving him for its own sake, but such a person is still \"far from perfection\" (chapter 16). It could be that at the beginning of the book, the reader isn't expected to be at such a level.</p>\n<p>However, I think his statement in chapter 1 may still be universally applicable.  Rabbi Chayim Friedlander observed (in his commentary to Da'at Tevunot 58) that what the Mesilat Yesharim says in chapter 1is that taking pleasure in God in the World to Come <em>is</em> a person's obligation in the world. According to the Ramchal, God's desire is to do good to his creations. Yet when people do bad actions, they prevent him from doing that, and (as if it were possible) weaken him and force him to punish them (<a href=\"http://www.hebrew.grimoar.cz/luzzato/daat_tevunot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'at Tevunot</a> 48). So receiving reward is not necessarily just a selfish motivation, but it can also be doing a kindness to God (מתחסד עם קונו, Mesilat Yesharim chapter 19) by allowing him to do more kindness to us.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As I pointed out <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/90620/rambams-view-of-worship-in-order-to-attain-olam-haba\">here</a>, the Rambam you cite as being against worship for the sake of Olam Haba is contradicted by what he writes in several other places, including the immediately preceding halacha.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=9&halocha=2&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuva 9:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומפני זה נתאוו כל ישראל נביאיהם וחכמיהם לימות המשיח כדי שינוחו ממלכיות\n  שאינן מניחות להן לעסוק בתורה ובמצות כהוגן וימצאו להם מרגוע וירבו בחכמה\n  כדי שיזכו לחיי העולם הבא</p>\n  \n  <p>For these reasons, all Israel, [in particular,] their prophets and\n  their Sages, have yearned for the Messianic age so they can rest from\n  the [oppression of] the gentile kingdoms who do not allow them to\n  occupy themselves with Torah and mitzvot properly.

AA was created by members of the Oxford Group, an Evangelical Christian organization for spiritual growth, and is an elaboration of their programming. They expanded a list of 4 practices into a sequence of 12 steps. And while AA adapted itself to addressing non-Christians, their \"Big Book\" even has a section about how atheists can relate to their program, those roots are very evident. Also pragmatically, they often meet in places like church classrooms or social halls.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Elyashiv was asked about joining AA, and he permitted. As far as I know, the response was never published, but a friend of mine who is a JACS Rabbi has a copy. (JACS is a group for Jewish members of 12 Step Programs and their families; the acronym is for \"Jewish Alcoholics, Chemically Dependent Persons and Significant Others\".) He not only permitted joining, but even to say \"The Lord's Prayer\" in the context of their meeting.</p>\n\n<p>Subsequently, debate arose as to how much of the permissive attitude was because of the risk to live involved in addition.</p>\n\n<p>In our terms, there is a dispute as to whether Rav Elyashiv permitted use of the Serenity Prayer, or would only permit the use when someone needs to join such a group to get their life back on track.</p>\n\n<p>As for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92625/1570\">Maurice Mizrahi's find of a Jewish precedent</a>, this is more akin to the question of using the Lord's Prayer. In both cases, even if the sentiment is inherently Jewish, the fact is the coinage was for another religion. We are prohibited from using others' rituals, even if to worship Hashem Yisbarakh. There was even initial resistance to placing sermons in shul worship over this issue; never mind one of their prayers. Finding a parallel in content isn't enough to permit. Still, Rav Elyashiv might have, anyway.</p>\n\n\n",

If the fragrance comes from a produce that is fit to eat,\n  whether it’s the fruit of a tree or of the ground, even if the fruit\n  is unfit to eat on its own like a lemon, nevertheless since its\n  primary purpose is to be eaten, the bracha is “haNosein reiach tov\n  b’peiros,” that G-d places a pleasing smell in the fruit. (Mishnah\n  Brurah 216:9 favors the alternate text, “asher nasan reiach tov\n  b’peiros,” in the past tense.) One only says the bracha if he intended\n  to smell the fruit. If he meant to eat it and smelled it incidentally,\n  one does not recite a bracha. <strong>One says this bracha when enjoying the\n  scent of roasted coffee beans.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this blessing apply only when smelling the actual fruit or would it apply to smelling vapors that may be mixed with other items or during a cooking process?

I.e., you are most likely smelling the coffee vapor / steam, rather than the coffee fruit, itself.</p></li>\n<li><p>The smell of beer comes from the vapors emitted during the brewing process. Beer vapors probably have a mix of alcohol from the yeasts (not considered a fruit, AFAIK) as well as hops and barley, which are fruits / veg.

Bulka.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To be a master of war means to master war, but to be a master of war is more than just being a superb general, an ingenious tactician, or a brilliant strategist. It means to be a winner in war AMD a winner in life. It implies the capacity to wage war even while loving life - to protect without militaristic experience has a contagious effect in which it is quite easy to become insensitive to life.</p>\n<p>Only G-d can be called a Master of war because all those who take part in battle are G-d’s own children, and remain as such. Battles are never pleasant. G-d is the Master of war. G-d is His name. The essence of G-d does not change through militarism. In life, there is an obligation to emulate G-d. It is impossible to be as G-d, but it is possible to emulate, to be aware of, what is godly, and to approximate, this godliness to whatever human extent possible. In the dimension of war, this implies the obligation not to let the necessity to fight in-vade the personality.</p>\n<p>Yaakov, when he was about to confront his brother, Esav, was greatly\nafraid and distressed (Bereshit 32:8). The midrash explains this\ndouble anxiety state as referring to two things which worried Yaakov -\nthe fact that he might be killed, and the fact that he might kill\nothers. Why was Yaakov botheted about having to kill others? Perhaps\nbecause he did not know what effect this would have on his\npersonality, whether it would change him from a peace-loving\nindividual into a bellicose, belligerent individual. This disturbed\nhim.</p>\n<p>Throughout Jewish history, we have had many military confrontations, but we do bot gloat over them. Indeed, the very victory over Egypt is only a partial celebration for which a half of Hallel is recited on the last six days of Pesach (Arachin 10a). The first days celebrate the leaving from Egypt, which was a total celebration. The last days celebration, the annihilation of Egypt, can never be a total celebration. Hannukah is celebrated not on the day of victory but on the day after, the day of rededication of the Temple. The holiday of Purim was made possible by military victory, but Purim is celebrated on the day the Jewish people ‘rested from their enemies’ (Esther 9:17-18).</p>\n<p>These are subtle but potent emulations of the godly quality that war should not permeate and overcome one’s human tendencies. In our time, this very feature is lived in the delicacy of Israel’s existence. Almost every able-bodied citizen is at once a defender of the state and a lover of peace. The Jewish subconscious relates back to its primordial roots.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can geirus (conversion to Judaism) be done without the prospective convert knowing at least the basics of ALL the mitzvos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When discussing the procedure of conversion to Judaism - Geirus, The Rambam (Hilchos Isurei Biah 14:2) Writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמוֹדִיעִין אוֹתוֹ <strong>עִקְּרֵי הַדָּת</strong> שֶׁהוּא יִחוּד הַשֵּׁם\n  וְאִסּוּר עַכּוּ''ם. וּמַאֲרִיכִין בַּדָּבָר הַזֶּה. וּמוֹדִיעִין\n  אוֹתוֹ <strong>מִקְצָת מִצְוֹת קַלּוֹת וּמִקְצָת מִצְוֹת חֲמוּרוֹת. וְאֵין\n  מַאֲרִיכִין בְּדָבָר זֶה.</strong> וּמוֹדִיעִין אוֹתוֹ עֲוֹן לֶקֶט שִׁכְחָה\n  וּפֵאָה וּמַעֲשֵׂר שֵׁנִי. וּמוֹדִיעִין אוֹתוֹ עונשין שֶׁל מִצְוֹת</p>\n  \n  <p>And they inform him of the main principles of the religion, which is\n  the unification of God's name, and the prohibition of idol worship,\n  and they dwell at length on this matter. And they inform him of <strong>some\n  of the lenient commandments, and some of the stringent commandments.\n  And they do not dwell at length on this</strong>. And they let him know the\n  sin of “gatherings” “forgotten sheaves” “corners of the field” and\n  “second tithe.” And they tell him of the punishments for not keeping\n  the commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since conversion to Judaism is an irreversible undertaking, how can it be done without the prospective convert knowing at least the basics of ALL the mitzvos?\nWe might end up with a situation where a convert was completely misinformed about what accepting Judaism involved, and his conversion would still be valid and irreversible. Why should this be so?\nWhat if he says later \"It never dawned on me in my wildest dreams that this was included in the practice of Judaism\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Viewing <em>geirut</em> as spelling out every detail of the <em>b'rit</em> seems impractical.  Even many Jews from birth don't know the basics of <em>all</em> the commandments, and while it's reasonable to have a higher bar for those seeking to become obligated, that's an awful lot of learning and testing before the person can enter into the community.</p>\n\n<p>A convert is required to agree to two key principles, <em>kabbalat ol hamitzvot</em> (accepting the yoke of the commandments) and <em>kabbalat ol malchut shamayim</em> (accepting the yoke of heaven).  If you truly agree that God is king, that God has given us commandments, and we are obligated to those commandments, then you don't need to know all the details in order to make a decision -- you've already opted in to the <em>system</em>.  When you learn that something is forbidden or required you'll follow it, because God commanded it.  This is as true for the born Jew who encounters new situations requiring new <em>p'sak</em> as it is for the <em>ger</em> who hasn't learned everything yet or the <em>ba'al teshuva</em> who becomes observant after not being raised that way -- or for all of <em>k'lal yisrael</em> who stood at Sinai and said נעשה ונשמע, we will do and (then) we will understand.</p>\n\n<p>As a practical matter, a rabbi works with a prospective <em>ger</em> for a significant amount of time before the candidate goes before the <em>beit din</em>.  During that time the rabbi will probe the candidate in various areas.  If he discovers something that might pose a problem, I trust that he would teach those <em>halachot</em> and discuss the matter even if that subject wouldn't otherwise be part of the \"curriculum\".  Nobody involved wants this to end badly, after all.</p>\n\n<p>(No sources, just my own reasoning.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam you cite comes straight from the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.47a.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 47a</a>, which continues</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And they do not overwhelm him with threats, and <strong>they are not exacting\n  with him about the details of the mitzvot</strong>. If he accepts upon himself all of these ramifications, then they circumcise him immediately. [...] When he is healed from the circumcision, they immerse him immediately, and two Torah scholars stand over him at the time of his immersion and inform him of <strong>some</strong> of the lenient mitzvot and <strong>some</strong> of the stringent mitzvot. Once he has immersed and emerged, he is like a born Jew in every sense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that in Talmudic times even the instruction on (some of the!) mitzvot was happening at the end of the conversion process. Remember also how Hillel converted a gentile (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 31a</a>) before teaching him \"That which is hateful to you do not do to another; that is the entire Torah, and the rest is its interpretation. Go study.\"</p>\n\n<p>The Shulhan Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.268.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 268:2</a>) builds on the same language and adds \"<strong>Don't say too much about this [the mitzvot], and don't get too specific either.</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam goes event beyond this and writes (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960661/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Thirteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Issurei Biah 13:17</a>) that <strong>even if</strong> a <em>beit din</em> did not inform a convert of the mitzvot and the punishment for [the failure to observe] the mitzvot and he circumcised himself and immersed in the presence of three ordinary people, he is a (valid) convert. (The SA YD 268:12 disagrees).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>There are at least two ways to explain this</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>R Eliezer Melamed <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/14767\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> quotes the Schach (268:4) who writes the reason is that even <strong>if the convert is sincere, if suddenly confronted with all of the stringencies and fine details, he will recoil and change his mind about converting</strong>. Therefore the custom was to convert a candidate after having been taught a few of the minor and major commandments, and after he undertook to keep all the mitzvot. This was the custom in the past, since a convert always joined a religious community. As a result, it was clear that, in principle, he agreed to observe the commandments. Over time he would learn to fulfil them all, even though at the time of conversion he was only aware of part of them.\n<br><br>\nR Melamed notes that in recent times, as converts don't always join observant communities, they need to spend more time learning the mitzvot so their acceptance is more meaningful.</p></li>\n<li><p>R J Simcha Cohen (in <a href=\"http://a.co/7bcLXSx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How does Jewish law work?</a>, pp. 65ff, online <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=8XBjccyzdL8C&lpg=PA68&ots=jqGd83qSGM&dq=geirus%20halacha%20knowledge%20mitzvot&pg=PA68#v=onepage&q=geirus%20halacha%20knowledge%20mitzvot&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), brings a number of opinion from R Dovid Hoffman, R Yehiel Yaakov Weinberg (the Sridei Eish) and R Yosef Dov Soloveichik that it is the <strong>acceptance</strong> of the mitzvot which is critical to legitimize a conversion and a <em>beit din</em> aims to assess if the convert will truly perform the commandments, even if he is - for now - ignorant of law and mitzvot.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Regarding your last question (what if the convert later says he didn't imagine a certain mitzva could exist?) there is a famous Igrot Moshe (YD 3:108) that if one converts knowing he will be unable to keep one of the mitzvot it is a kosher conversion (cited <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/35632/11501\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Feinstein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

Some mention forehead between the eyes. Some don't.</p>\n\n<p>Which one is right?</p>\n\n<p>Last time I checked, our forehead is not exactly between our eyes. Putting tefillin between the eyes would require a diagonal string to keep it in place. Or using glue I suppose.</p>\n\n<p>But that's not how it's worn. Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This is a classic question. I'm quite surprised we didn't have a question like this already on this site. I will do my best to explain. </p>\n\n<p>First of all, let's examine the actual passuk:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>:וּקְשַׁרְתָּ֥ם לְא֖וֹת עַל־יָדֶ֑ךָ וְהָי֥וּ לְטֹֽטָפֹ֖ת בֵּ֥ין\n  עֵינֶֽיךָ</p>\n  \n  <p>And you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be\n  for a reminder between your eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Hebrew word here most often translated as \"between\" (בֵּין) can also mean \"opposite.\" With this in mind, we can translate the passuk as \"...They shall be for a reminder <strong>opposite</strong> your eyes\" and this would make more sense when we examine how tefillin are actually worn.</p>\n\n<p>As you linked, the box is placed somewhere at the hairline, and not \"between the eyes\" on the bridge of the nose. As per Jewish Law, the tefillin shel rosh must be positioned centered between the eyes while remaining placed on the hairline. This would make them \"opposite\" the eyes. </p>\n\n<p>The first link you brought is from a Karaite source. Karaites reject the Oral Torah and the instructions from the Rabbis and generally follow the Written Torah from a literal level. If one were to follow the Torah literally, he would place the tefillin between the eyes, on the bridge of the nose. (This would be incorrect as per Jewish Law.) But what's more interesting is that Karaites do not wear tefillin at all, they interpret this passage as non-literal, and that you do not have to literally have the words on your arm and head, but rather that the passuk means that you should constantly have the Torah on your mind and in all your actions. But we're not here to talk about what Karaites think. Let's get back to the subject.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Menachot 37b brings the reasoning behind placing the tefillin on the hairline:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גובה שבראש מנלן דת\"ר בין עיניך זו גובה שבראש אתה אומר זו גובה שבראש או\n  אינו אלא בין עיניך ממש נאמר כאן בין עיניך ונאמר להלן (דברים יד, א) לא\n  תשימו קרחה בין עיניכם למת מה להלן בגובה שבראש מקום שעושה קרחה אף כאן\n  בגובה של ראש מקום שעושה קרחה</p>\n  \n  <p>From where do we learn that the tefillin shel rosh must be on the\n  upper part of the head? For our Rabbis taught: \"Between your eyes\",\n  that is, the upper part of the head. You say it is the upper part of\n  the head, but maybe it means literally between the eyes? It is written\n  here: \"Between your eyes\", and it is written there: \"Nor make any\n  baldness between your eyes for the dead\". In the latter case it means\n  the upper part of the head where baldness can be made, so therefore in\n  the former as well it means the upper part of the head where baldness\n  can be made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This the basic answer. There are many more things to say on this matter. I'd suggest reading the whole Gemara there in Menachot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a>, commenting on the verse in Exodus 13:9, explains why we do not wear tefillin between our eyes. He lists three reasons why that cannot be what the Torah meant:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is no room between the eyes for tefillin.</li>\n<li>Tefillin worn between our eyes would block our vision.</li>\n<li>Tefillin worn between our eyes would cause the nations to laugh at us.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן אין הכוונה שנניח תפילין של ראש בין העינים מפני מה שאמרה התורה בהם\n  ולזכרון בין עיניך ולטוטפת בין עיניך וזה כי אין שם מקום יתכן שיונחו בו\n  עם שהם יהיו סנורים בעינינו רוצה לומר שכבר ימנעונו מראיית הדברים כהוגן\n  עם שזה יהיה דבר יביא אותנו להיות ללעג ולשחוק לשאר העמים וזה הפך כוונת\n  התורה כאומרו כי הוא חכמתכם ובינתכם לעיני העמים</p>\n  \n  <p>And also the intent [of the Torah] is not that we should place the\n  head-tefillin between the eyes on account of the Torah saying about\n  them \"and as a remembrance between your eyes\" [and] \"and as totafot\n  between your eyes\". This is because there is no space where it is\n  possible to place it there, and they would be blinders in our eyes\n  (meaning to say that they would prevent us from seeing things\n  properly), and it would be something that would bring us to be a\n  mockery and a laughingstock to the other nations – the opposite of the\n  intent of the Torah when it says \"for this is your wisdom and\n  understanding to the eyes of the nations\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'll give a short answer the way I understand the mitzvah of tefillin- the shel rosh serves as a sign - witness Shmoth 33.6 : \"and it shall be for a reminder between your eyes [and my eyes,\"] that is, when each person sees the <em>totafoth</em> (<em>shel rosh</em>) on the head of a fellow Jew it shall serve as a reminder to discuss the Exodus; for as it says in Shmoth 13.9, \"And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thine eyes, that the law of the L-RD may be in thy mouth; for with a strong hand hath the L-RD brought thee out of Egypt. \"</p>\n\n<p>The Torah is using an euphemism for \"between your eyes and my eyes\" but is not saying we should place the shel rosh literally \"between our eyes\" that would as one posting said elicit mockery  </p>\n\n<p>Shmoth 13.8 stipulates that during the Pesach season we are to discuss the Exodus: \"And thou shalt tell thy son in that day, saying: It is because of that which the L-RD did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.\"</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, Shmoth 13.9 is teaching us that seeing the Shel Rosh serves to initiate discussion of Pesach and the Exodus; something the shel yad cannot do once it is placed opposite the heart!</p>\n\n\n",

And how did they recite this song? If a baby was lying on his mother’s lap or an infant was nursing from his mother’s breasts, once they saw the Divine Presence, <strong>the baby straightened his neck and the infant dropped the breast from his mouth,</strong> and they recited: “This is my God and I will glorify Him” (Exodus 15:2).

    "content": "# Zevulun or Yissachar: Who Goes First?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Devarim 33:18 Rashi cites Breishit Rabbah 99:9 saying that Zevulun preceded Yissachar in receiving Moshe’s bracha because that shevet enabled Yissachar to learn Torah by providing for their material and financial needs.</p>\n\n<p>In Bamidbar 7:18 Yissachar offers his offerings before Zevulun and Rashi says that he was the second of the tribes to offer korbanot because he was learned in Torah (citing Divrei Hayamim I 12:32).  Here, one of Rashi’s criteria for precedence is being learned in Torah.  In Devarim 33:18 Rashi said Zevulun’s ability to finance Yissachar’s Torah learning was more important and allowed Zevulun precedence.  If so, why doesn’t Zevulun get to offer his korbanot before Yissachar in Bamidbar 7:18?</p>\n\n<p>Why does Rashi seem to contradict himself?  Which is more important according to Rashi: learning Torah full time (Yissachar) or providing for one who learns full time (Zevulun)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The simplest answer (as with most contradictions in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>'s commentary) is that Rashi did not make up these ideas. In each case he is quoting a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash</a>, and the two midrashim are not necessarily in agreement. The comment in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Numbers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar</a> is based on a midrash in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_Rabbah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabba</a>, while the comment in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Deuteronomy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim</a> is based on a midrash in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sifre\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can still address this specific question to see whether there is even a contradiction to begin with. To do this it is helpful to see the exact text. Rashi in Devarim says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפיכך הקדים זבולן ליששכר שתורתו של יששכר על ידי זבולן היתה</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, Zevulun preceded Yissaschar [in the order of the blessings]\n  because the Torah of Yissaschar was on account of Zevulun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that Rashi does not say \"Zevulun’s ability to finance Yissachar’s Torah learning was more important\".</p>\n\n<p>In Bamidbar Rashi states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שבשביל שני דברים זכה להקריב שיני לשבטים אחת שהיו ידועים בתורה שנאמר\n  ומבני יששכר יודעי בינה לעיתים ואחת שהם נתנו עצה לנשיאים להתנדב קרבנות\n  הללו</p>\n  \n  <p>Due to two things he merited to bring the offering second of the\n  tribes: <strong>1.</strong> They [the tribe of Yissaschar] were knowledgeable in\n  Torah, as it says \"and from the children of Yissaschar were knowers of\n  the wisdom of the times\". <strong>2.</strong> They gave advice to the tribal\n  leaders to donate these offerings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here Zevulun is not mentioned at all, and there are two reasons given for Yissachar's precedence. Therefore, one could argue that it was only the combination of the two reasons that gave them precedence over Zevulun, but their Torah knowledge alone would not have. Alternatively one can simply say that since neither source discusses the relative importance of studying vs financing, there may simply be different criteria for precedence by blessings and by offerings. In one case financing is deemed to have precedence while in the other case studying is deemed to have precedence.</p>\n\n<p>Now one could still ask why the criteria for blessings and offerings have different orders of precedence. Of course, we could simply answer that God's calculations are unknown, and be done. However, I think we can suggest a difference:</p>\n\n<p>There are two different measurements involved. There is the measurement of sechar (Divine reward) that one receives for keeping the Torah, and there is the measurement of how we must relate to people in this world.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to sechar, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud</a> lays down the following principle:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=9&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 9a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר אלעזר גדול המעשה יותר מן העושה</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Eleazar said: He who causes others to do good is greater than the\n  doer (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Baba_Bathra.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That \"greater than\" refers to reward is evident from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>'s codification of this in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=7&hilchos=35&perek=10&halocha=6&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Matnot Aniyim 10:6</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הכופה אחרים ליתן צדקה ומעשה אותן שכרו גדול משכר הנותן שנאמר והיה מעשה\n  הצדקה שלום ועל גבאי צדקה וכיוצא בהם אומר ומצדיקי הרבים ככוכבים</p>\n  \n  <p>A person who compels others to give charity and motivates them to do\n  so receives a greater reward than the person who actually gives, as\n  [alluded to by Isaiah 32:17]: \"And the deed of charity is peace.\"\n  With regard to the collectors of charity and the like can be applied\n  [the words of praise, Daniel 12:3]: \"Those who bring merit to the many\n  are like the stars.\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/986711/jewish/Matnot-Aniyim-Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Touger translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus it would seem that in terms of reward, financing Torah surpasses studying Torah, and therefore when it comes to the Divine blessings that are received Zevulun is greater than Yissaschar.</p>\n\n<p>However, when it comes to relating to people in this world, we have a law that demands that honor be given to Torah scholars. Part of this honor is that Torah scholars come first. (See e.g. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=28&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horayot 13a</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when it comes to bringing the offerings, the Torah scholars must be honored and therefore Yissaschar comes first, even though in terms of sechar studying Torah might not be better than financing it. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Of course, Yissachar is the greater of the two, in that they embody the Torah. That is why Zevulun sacrifice so much to support them. But the brachos were for success and wealth. Yissachar's financial well being is based on Zevulun's success. A bracha for Zevulun is a bracha for Yissachar.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Heaven is also a place among us?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Targum Yonathan on Isaiah 6:3 teaches that \"the most exalted heaven is the dwelling place of His Presence\". Likewise Isaiah 66:1 teaches that heaven is His throne. </p>\n\n<p>But then I came acrosse these commentaries from the Sefaria website:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An alternate reading of a verse from Malbim (Rabbi Meir Leibush ben Yechiel Michel, a 19th Century commentator). He chose to read v'shachanti b'tocham, \n  \"I will dwell among them\" as \"I will dwell within them.\" He wrote: \". . . in them, the people, not in it, the sanctuary. We are each to build a Tabernacle in our own heart for G-d to dwell in.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi,\n  The idea is that the Tabernacle represents the resting of G-d's presence on the Jewish people as it says, \"And I shall dwell amongst them\" and it says, \"a Temple of G-d it is.\" What is this need for a G-dly abode down below?  Our Rabbis teach us Medrash Tanchuma: G-d desired a dwelling place in the lowest worlds.  But does it not say that \"the Heavens and Earth I fill\"?  But the concept is that this dwelling place is the revelation of G-dliness, Blessed be God's Name.  The Lowest Worlds specifically should have this revelation, and these lowest worlds are not a place.  After all, G-d declares to Moses \"the place is with Me!\" which means that both Above and Below are not places in the physical sense but represent levels in and expressions in G-dly expression.  In this lowest of all worlds, it is the lowest of G-dly expression because it is the last rung of the levels of orders of creations of the worlds.  Therefore, here, in this world, the conceptualization of G-dliness is understood in a way of hiddeness and great darkness.  G-d desires that we light up the darkness specifically.  How do we do this?  Through mitzvoth and Torah.  This explains a statement of our Sages: One hour of teshuva and good deeds is greater in this world than the whole world to come.  This is because through one deed in this world, one can draw down more G-dliness than anything in the next world... We make this lowest of all worlds a dwelling place through making souls in bodies specifically on the level of being separate and unique. By being separate within a body, through mitzvoth, one can achieve the level of holiness of \"I will dwell amongst you\" and this is achieved through staying away from evil and attaching one's self to good. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Could one say that a piece of Heaven, HaShem, His Shechinah, could (figuratively) dwell/resides in us?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Shechinah, Hashem's presence on earth, is typically understood to dwell <strong>on</strong> the Jew, or <strong>between</strong> the Jews as in</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a man and woman merit reward through a faithful marriage, the\n  Divine Presence rests <strong>between</strong> them (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.17a.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 17a</a>)</p>\n  \n  <p>When three sit as judges, the Shechinah is <strong>with</strong> them (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.6a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 6a</a>)</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shechinah dwells <strong>over</strong> the headside of the sick man's bed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.12b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat\n  12b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There is however indeed a part of Hashem implanted in man, and that is the <em>neshama</em>.

    "content": "# Why didn't women complain about not being able to bring the Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the first year in the desert, some men were tamei and complained that they couldn't bring the Pesach.

Even if you argue that they would have complained but these men were quicker and got in first, they should <em>still</em> have complained again, because the mitzvah of Pesach Sheni didn't address their needs.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Sifri Bamidbar 6,22 Moshe kept on pushing off the <em>Temeim</em> (ritually impure people) by saying that they simply were not obligated at all to bring the Pesach Offering since they were <em>Tamei</em> minority and were exempt. Only certain men (see Pesachim 6a who exactly these men were) argued to Moshe that Pesach offering could be brought from a <em>Kal Vachomer</em> from <em>Chatos</em>. Just like a <em>Chatos</em> could be brought to atone on behalf of someone <em>Tamei</em> by Kohanim who were <em>Tahor</em> even though it was <em>Kodshei Kodoshim</em> -Higher Sanctity, how much more so could the <em>Pesach</em> have been brought on behalf of <em>Temeim</em> (by Tahor Kohanim) which was <em>Kodshei Kalim</em> Lower Sanctity (albeit not to be eaten rather to just fulfill the Mitzva of the blood on the Mizbeach).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>למה נגרע א\"ל אין קדשים קרבים בטומאה. אמרו לו [אם קדשים שיש להם אחריות קרבים קדשים שאין להם אחריות לא יקרבו. אמר להם אין קדשים נאכלים בטומאה.] אמרו לו אם כן יזרק הדם על הטומאה והבשר נאכל לטהורים. והדין נותן ומה חטאת שהיא קדשי קדשים דמה נזרק על הטומאה ובשרה נאכל לטהורים, פסח שהוא קדשים קלים דין שיזרק הדם על הטמאים והבשר נאכל לטהורים  אמר להם לא שמעתי עמדו ואשמעה כאדם האומר אשמע דבר מפי רבי...אמר ר' חדקא [שמעון] השקמוני היה לי חבר מתלמידי ר”ע ואמר יודע היה משה שאין טמא אוכל את הפסח, על מה נחלקו, אם יזרק הדם עליהם אם לאו. ראויה היתה פרשת טמאים שתאמר על [ידי משה] אלא שמגלגלים זכות ע”י זכאי וחובה ע”י חיב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These men had to have been massive <em>Talmidei Chachamim</em> to argue with Moshe and require a response from Hashem Himself. Since women in general did not study Torah and even most men were not learned enough to argue with Moshe (see Pesachim 6a where there were numerous men who were <em>Tamei</em> and the <em>Tanaim</em> argue which <em>specific</em> men came forward to argue with Moshe), when Moshe at first told those <em>Temeiim</em> they were simply exempt they accepted without argument (it didn't occur to anyone that there would be a Pesach Sheini). But these stubborn <em>Talmidei Chachamim</em> who persisted and invoked a response from Hashem to do <em>Pesach Sheini</em>, of them it is said in the Sifri \"merit is incurred through the meritous,\" may our portion be like theirs.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I just thought of this answer:</p>\n<p>The commandment to bring the Pesach the second year <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.9.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">starts with</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְיַעֲשׂ֧וּ בְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל אֶת־הַפָּ֖סַח בְּמוֹעֲדֽוֹ׃</p>\n<p>The Jewish people should bring the Pesach at its proper time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.9.2.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> says (from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Bamidbar.65.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifri</a>, which elaborates a lot more)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"במועדו\" אף בשבת, \"במועדו\" אף בטומאה ‏</p>\n<p>\"at its proper time\" meaning even on Shabbos or in a state of tumah [if the whole nation is tamei from corpses]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These men also used the same word במועדו:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַ֠יֹּאמְרוּ הָאֲנָשִׁ֤ים הָהֵ֙מָּה֙ אֵלָ֔יו אֲנַ֥חְנוּ טְמֵאִ֖ים לְנֶ֣פֶשׁ אָדָ֑ם לָ֣מָּה נִגָּרַ֗ע לְבִלְתִּ֨י הַקְרִ֜ב אֶת־קָרְבַּ֤ן יְהוָה֙ <strong>בְּמֹ֣עֲד֔וֹ</strong> בְּת֖וֹךְ בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ ‏</p>\n<p>And those men said to him \"We are tamei from a corpse.  Why should we be left out and not be able to bring the offering to Hashem <strong>at its appointed time</strong> among the Jewish people\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems from their usage of this word that they were basing themselves on the permission to bring the Pesach when the entire nation is tamei, and wanted to bring it even when only their little group was tamei.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.9.7?lang=he&with=Daat%20Zkenim&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daas Zekeinim</a>'s explanation goes in this direction.  (Something is messed up on Sefaria, I can't get it to display in Hebrew.)</p>\n<p>To take it a step further: wfb mentioned in the comments that there's another drasha brought in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.66b.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Pesachim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ופסח גופיה מנא לן אמר רבי יוחנן דאמר קרא איש איש כי יהיה טמא לנפש איש נדחה לפסח שני ואין ציבור נידחין לפסח שני אלא עבדי בטומאה ‏</p>\n<p>How do we know that the Pesach can be brought even in a state of tumah?  Rabbi Yochanan says, because the pasuk says \"If someone is tamei from a corpse...\" - one person can be pushed off to Pesach Sheni, but the whole nation can't be pushed off to Pesach Sheni.  Rather, they bring it even though they're tamei.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the time when these people complained, the pasuk Rabbi Yochanan is quoting hadn't been said yet, so they may not have seen any reason to distinguish between a few people and the entire community.  Without איש איש, it's perfectly reasonable to believe במועדו is a blanket permission to bring the Pesach in a state of tumah.</p>\n<p>Since the normal allowance of tumah doesn't work for other kinds of tumah, their argument wouldn't have worked for women who were niddos.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, it seems from the whole commandment of Pesach Sheini that it's primarily designed for corpse tumah specifically, איש איש כי יהיה טמא לנפש.  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Bamidbar.69\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Practically you can bring it for other kinds of tumah as well</a>, but that's a secondary derivation; the main association seems to be to tumah from corpses.  This may be have something to do with why women didn't complain after the fact, but could use further development.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I'd suggest as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The mitzvah of Korban Pesach has two components that can be done by non-kohanim - shechting it, and eating it.</p>\n\n<p>The first of these most likely wouldn't be done by women. First of all, וכי אשה בעזרה מנין (Kiddushin 52b); second, it's not so simple whether women are allowed to shecht, or if yes, whether when it comes to kodshim they can do so lechatchila or not. (See Tosafos, Chullin 2a and Kiddushin 76b, and Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 1:1.) So whether they're tamei or not would be immaterial to that part of the mitzvah. Whereas the men could, and likely would,** do their own shechting. (They may also have been aware of the rule that טומאה הותרה\\דחויה בצבור, and thus argued that they ought to be able to enter the chatzer of the Mishkan for this purpose even if they're a minority, in order to be able to join with the tzibbur.)</p>\n\n<p>The eating part is indeed binding on both men and women. But it's specifically about the Korban Pesach that Chazal tell us (Nazir 23a and Horios 10b) that eating it לשום אכילה גסה is wrong (and R. Yochanan goes so far as to call a person who does so a פושע). One definition of אכילה גסה is \"just because he's hungry and desires it\" (Mefaresh to Nazir ibid.), or \"not for the sake of the mitzvah, just eating it as dessert\" (Rashi to Horios ibid.). If, then, women came forward to ask what accommodation could be made for them to eat the Korban Pesach when they're tahor, they might well be accused (by Moshe, or even by Hashem if their motives weren't 100% pure) of wanting to do so לשום אכילה גסה. (Note that the men neatly sidestepped that issue; their complaint is למה נגרע לבלתי <strong>הקריב</strong> קרבן ה' במועדו, not לבלתי אכול, and Rashi there notes that they would have been satisfied if יאכל הבשר לטהורים so long as they could participate in the bringing of the korban.)</p>\n\n<p>** It may be true, as DoubleAA noted in the comments, that many men wouldn't be doing the shechting anyway (i.e., that multiple households, each with their own male head, would share in one Korban Pesach). I'm not convinced of that point. But even if we grant it: each man <em>could</em> still be the one to shecht his group's korban (if they're able to do so even when tamei), while the women would not.</p>\n\n\n",

Although it is not listed in the \"seven commandments\" of Sanhedrin 56b, the Gemara clarifies one daf later that the list is only meant to include obligation to <em>not</em> do something, not positive commands. This would explain why the people of Sedom were destroyed on account of not doing charity (see Yechezkel 16:49). This also seems to be the position of <strong>Rabbeinu Bachayei</strong> (Bereishis 18:20) and perhaps also the <strong>Netziv,</strong> who wrote in his fascinating approbation to <em>Sefer Ahavas Chesed</em> (written by the Chofetz Chaim) that non-Jews are obligated in doing acts of kindness.</p>\n\n<p>However, it is fairly clear from <strong>Rambam</strong> (Mishnah Torah 10:10) that he disagrees, as he includes giving charity as something acceptable but not obligatory.

If no, which one was he supposed to? </p>\n\n<p>What about Sheis? Rashi expounds each time את appears in 4:1-2 as a reference to another sister, but no such word appears in either 4:25 or 5:3 regarding his birth (though it does appear in both regarding his name). Since he therefore wasn’t born with a twin, did he marry Kayin’s twin sister or did he marry one of Hevel’s? Or perhaps he married a female descendant of Kayin’s?</p>\n\n<p>These questions are specifically in Rashi’s opinion that Kayin married his twin sister. If there are alternative explanations as to whom each brother married that might possibly fit into Rashi’s opinion, I will only accept such an answer if you can demonstrate that Rashi holds that way as well. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi is quoting the opinion in Medrash Rabba Which says that Kayin had 1 twin sister and Hevel had 2 twin sisters:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָמַר רַבִּי הוּנָא תְּאוֹמָה יְתֵרָה נוֹלְדָה עִם הֶבֶל, זֶה אוֹמֵר אֲנִי נוֹטְלָהּ שֶׁאֲנִי בְּכוֹר, וְזֶה אוֹמֵר אֲנִי נוֹטְלָהּ שֶׁנּוֹלְדָה עִמִּי, וּמִתּוֹךְ כָּךְ וַיָּקָם קַיִן.<br>\n  An extra twin sister was born with Hevel, Kayin said i should marry her because i am the firstborn, Hevel said i should marry her because she was born with me and through this dispute Kayin got up and killed Hevel</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that Kayin and Hevel were both married to their twins, and that Hevel didn't get a chance to marry his second twin until he got killed. We also see later after Kayin killed Hevel and Hashem banished him from humans in Bereishis 4,17 וַיֵּדַע קַיִן אֶת אִשְׁתּוֹ i.e that Kayin knew his (singular tense) wife which implies that his original wife was allowed to remain with him and that he never ended up taking another wife. So According to the Medrash Rabbah which Rashi is reffering to , <strong>Hevel's second twin married neither Kayin or Hevel</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>It could be that this second twin ended up marrying Sheis, or it could be that Sheis married other daughters of Adam as it says וַיּ֥וֹלֶד בִּדְמוּת֖וֹ כְּצַלְמ֑וֹ which clearly indicates the birth of more children at the time of Sheis' birth. Indeed many women must have been available, as Lemech married 2 wives in spite of the fact that only one את was written at the birth of Chanoch, Irod, Mechiyael, Mesushael and lemech. So if each of the above names married their twin, Lemech must have got his second wife from somewhere.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When the Mishnayos were compiled, were they compiled into the perakim we have today, or were they just compiled into masechtos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many times throughout Shas, it seems as if the Perakim are sliced in completely arbitrary places. To name a few examples:</p>\n\n<p>In Maseches Shabbos, the halachos of Tzad, trapping, are discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.13.5-14.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">13:5-14:1</a>. It seems odd that the last Mishnah regarding trapping is attached to the following chapter rather than having all of the halachos of trapping in the same chapter. </p>\n\n<p>Further on, Muktzeh is discussed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.17.1-18.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17:1-18:2</a>. Why not attach those two Mishnayos to chapter 17? The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.17.1-18.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">third and final Mishnah in chapter 18</a> discusses helping animals and women give birth on Shabbos, and what one may do with the baby afterwards. These prohibitions and permissions, according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.128b.20&p2=Rashi_on_Shabbat.128b.20.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Shabbos 128b</a>, relate to the prohibition against doing extra work on Shabbos and the permission to do whatever is necessary to save a person’s life. These have nothing to do with Muktzeh, but this Mishnah is the springboard with which the Mishnah justifies the following chapter being about what acts of Bris Milah may be done on Shabbos. Based on that, it would make more sense that it start chapter 19, rather than conclude chapter 18, which it doesn’t have anything to do with. </p>\n\n<p>Another example from an entirely different masechta: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.1.3-3.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh HaShanah 1:3-3:1</a> discusses the witnesses’ testimony for Rosh Chodesh, and the procedure done once their testimony was accepted. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.3.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:2</a> picks up with the halachos of Shofaros, discussed through the end of the masechta. Why is 3:1 not the end of chapter 2?</p>\n\n<p>For one final example: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.7.1-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzi’a 7:1-8</a> talks about someone hired to watch produce. <em>In the middle of Mishnah 8</em>, the Mishnah switches to talk about general halachos of Shomrim, which it continues through <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.7.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah 10</a> (with a slight tangent in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.7.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah 11</a>). In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Metzia.8.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 8</a>, the Mishnayos continue with halachos of shomrim. Why is the end of chapter 7 not prepended to chapter 8?</p>\n\n<p>There are many more examples I could bring of these types of scenarios. While the order of Mishnayos within a masechta are in order (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.7a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 7a</a>), can one deduce from such scenarios as the ones above that the perakim were a later, perhaps arbitrary decision? Especially in light of the example in Bava Metzi’a, perhaps one could extend this argument to where the Mishnayos begin and end. </p>\n\n<p>I am not asking for an explanation for these particular cases. I am asking if anyone says explicitly that the perakim in Mishnayos were a later addition or not. If the answer turns out to be negative, perhaps I’ll ask that separately. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10879-mishnah#anchor14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">answers</a> that the division of the several treatises into chapters as well as the sequence of these chapters was the work of Rabbi [Yehuda HaNasi] himself although some changes were made over time.

Apparently, whenever the Yerushalmi was printed, using the typesetting reasoning, something must have been different that they left that at page 1.</p>\n<p>Why would there be that difference with the two? Or, is there some other reason as to why there is a difference?</p>\n<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> In the linked question, various reasons are given as to why Bavli starts at daf bet. Here, I'm asking specifically, as to why there is a difference between the Bavli and Yerushalmi. From what I see, all the reasons mentioned for Bavli could have applied to Yerushalmi, but for some reason, they weren't. Why is that?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There were no standards of printing. They were developed by different printers in different countries, etc. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were no numbers at all on original manuscripts. The Torah has no numeration. Whoever printed a book decided if and how to enumerate the text. Some books were arranged by full columns on each page. Many were arranged with four columns, two on the front and two on the back.</p>\n\n<p>The first Hebrew book ever printed was the Commentary of Rashi on the Chumash, in Italy. Only in the second printing, in 1475, did the printer think of dating the printing, (historyofinformation.com: “Abraham Ben Garton issues first dated book, etc.”)  something that we consider today obvious to include.</p>\n\n<p>When the Talmud was printed (first 16 tractates printed by Joshua Soncino in 1483; [first complete edition, finished in 1523, by Daniel Bomberg, a non-Jewish printer] (Wikipedia, “Daniel Bomberg”), the decision was made to include not only the text of the Talmud, but also two commentaries: Rashi and Tosafot. Someone decided to deem the cover page as “Alef” (without the letter) and the first page of actual text as page “Beit.”</p>\n\n<p>The publisher of Talmud Yerushalmi was at a later time and someone decided to count page ”Alef” as the first page of text, not counting the title page. In a desire to make it easier to remember, most printers kept the same pagination of the Talmud until it became accepted practice. [I remember seeing a one-volume copy of the Talmud that had only the text of the Talmud and the Rashi commentary, printed in the early 20th century by a newspaper company, iirc, which had different pagination, but it was not accepted and I heard from a Rabbi that it was decried.]</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Reish Lakish: While your coat [addemiktorakh] is still on you, go and retract your rulings. This is because the town of Bezer which is mentioned among the cities of refuge (Deuteronomy 4:43) is not the same as Bozrah. Bozrah is not part of Eretz Yisrael, and one is not obligated to separate tithes from its produce. The water is also permitted as it is water that belongs to the public, and water that belongs to the public is not rendered prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>רבי יוחנן לטעמיה</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara notes that Rabbi Yoḥanan conforms to his standard line of reasoning,</p>\n\n<p>59a\nדא\"ר יוחנן משום ר\"ש בן יהוצדק מים של רבים אין נאסרין הא דיחיד נאסרין</p>\n\n<p>as Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: Water that belongs to the public is not rendered prohibited.

The Gemara explains: No, it is necessary to derive this halakha from the fact that the water belongs to the public in a case where a wave raised the water and detached it from the ground. In this case worshipping water owned by an individual would render it prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>סוף סוף אבני הר שנדלדלו נינהו תסתיים דר' יוחנן דאמר אסורות</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara challenges: Nevertheless, the water ultimately falls into the category of objects that were detached without human involvement, such as boulders of a mountain that dislodged on their own. The Gemara (46a) cites a dispute between Rabbi Yoḥanan and the sons of Rabbi Ḥiyya with regard to boulders that dislodged without human involvement and were then worshipped, and does not conclude who deems the boulders permitted and who deems them prohibited. May it be concluded from Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement that it is Rabbi Yoḥanan who says that the boulders are prohibited?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.58b.8-59a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Text and translation Sefaria</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>To add to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92803/9682\">@Josh K’s excellent answer</a>, the Shulchan Aruch paskens like that Gemara (YD 145:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל שֶׁאֵין בּוֹ תְּפִיסַת יַד אָדָם וְלֹא עֲשָׂהוּ אָדָם, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנֶּעֱבַד, הֲרֵי זֶה מֻתָּר בַּהֲנָאָה. לְפִיכָךְ הַמִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶה לָהָר, לֹא נֶאֱסַר. וַאֲפִלּוּ אַבְנֵי הַר שֶׁנִּדַּלְדְּלוּ, וַעֲדַיִן הֵם בִּמְקוֹמָם וַעֲבָדָם שָׁם, אֵינָן נֶאֱסָרִין. <strong>וְכֵן הַנְּהָרוֹת וְהַמַּעְיָנוֹת שֶׁל רַבִּים</strong> וְאִילָנוֹת שֶׁלֹּא נְטָעָן לְשֵׁם עֲבוֹדַת כּוֹכָבִים, <strong>אֵינָם נֶאֱסָרִים</strong>. וּמִכָּל מָקוֹם אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁלֹּא נֶאֱסַר גּוּף הָאִילָן כְּשֶׁמִּשְׁתַּחֲוֶה לוֹ, כָּל הַשָּׂרִיגִים וְהֶעָלִים וְהַפֵּרוֹת שֶׁיּוֹצִיא כָּל זְמַן שֶׁהוּא נֶעֱבָד, אֲסוּרִים בַּהֲנָאָה.</p>\n<p>Anything which no individual has rights to [loose translation] and which no person created, even if it was served, it is still permissible to benefit from it.

However, if you are walking through a known dangerous area (I guess certain areas of New York City that are considered high crime areas would qualify), then you should recite with a bracha. I'm excerpting some parts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It does not matter whether one travels by foot, automobile, boat,\n  train or airplane. As long as the trip consists of the minimum\n  distance, tefilas haderech is recited. (Mishnah Berurah 110:30, Sefer\n  Ishei Yisrael chap. 50, footnote 5, Sefer Tefilah K’Hilchasah 27:27,\n  Shu”t Be’er Moshe vol. VII chap. 114:1)</p>\n  \n  <p>In earlier generations intercity roads passed through desolate and\n  totally unpopulated areas. Therefore, the danger of highwaymen and\n  wild animals was very prevalent. It is for this reason that these two\n  dangers are specifically mentioned in the text of tefilas haderech.</p>\n  \n  <p>The question is, however, what is the status of our roadways? Very\n  often, even intercity roads traverse populated areas, thus minimizing\n  the original types of dangers mentioned in tefilas haderech. Does one\n  recite tefilas haderech if he travels on such a road?</p>\n  \n  <p>The crux of the issue is: Did Chazal institute tefilas haderech only\n  because of those specifically mentioned dangers, or was it instituted\n  for other types of danger as well?</p>\n  \n  <p>This is debated by contemporary poskim. The Chazon Ish zt”l maintains\n  that all types of dangers were included and since automobile travel is\n  dangerous, one recites tefilas haderech even if traveling intercity in\n  built up areas. HaRav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zt”l, however, holds that\n  tefilas haderech was instituted only for the stated types of danger.\n  Hence on many of our roads, tefilas haderech is said without the\n  concluding bracha.</p>\n  \n  <p>Of course, if the area of travel is known to be a dangerous place,\n  tefilas haderech is recited with the concluding bracha, as we\n  previously mentioned. (Sefer Ishei Yisrael chap. 50, footnote 24)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The term \"travel\" doesn't seem to be restricted to just by automobile. I'd be surprised if Chazon Ish and Rav Auerbach would nullify with Mishna Berurah and others have stated. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If Tzitzis is such an important Mitzvah, why is there no obligation to purchase a four cornered garment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (24/1) writes that there is no obligation to wear a four cornered garment. Rather if you wearing one you must have tzitzis strings on it.</p>\n\n<p>Yet we find that wearing tzitzis is a very important thing. It reminds you of all the mitzvos, you benefit  great rewards (Shlchan Aruch 24/6), it saves you at a time of Hashem's anger (Menachos 41a), and there is a great punishment for those that don't keep this Mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>If Tzitzis is such an important Mitzvah, why is there no obligation to purchase a four cornered garment?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I heard the following explanation from <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yonason_Sacks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yonason Sacks</a> regarding the difference in obligation between the two mitzvos that we wear - tzitzis and tefillin. </p>\n\n<p>The mitzvah of tefillin carries an absolute chiyuv (obligation), while the mitzvah of tzitzis only applies if you opt in. You only become obligated in tzitzis if you <em>choose</em> to wear a garment with four corners; without that choice, you have no obligation.  </p>\n\n<p>He explained the reason for the difference as follows: </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in a number of places (including Berachos 11a) describes tefillin as a p’eir - an adornment. The Gemara says that this is true to the point that one doesn’t wear tefillin during the first day of aveilus (mourning). Even though once his relative’s body is buried the mourner is no longer an onein and is obligated in all other mitzvos, he is not allowed to wear tefillin, as doing so is considered a contradiction to his state of mourning. The way Rav Sacks said it is that it would be like coming to a funeral dressed in extravagant, royal robes; it’s totally inappropriate given the nature of the situation.</p>\n\n<p>As a symbol of royalty, tefillin represent that that the wearer is a ben melech - a child of the King. </p>\n\n<p>When it comes to tzitzis, on the other hand, Tosfos on Menachos 43b (ד״ה חותם של טיט) say that tzitzis symbolizes avdus (servitude), like a garment or uniform that a slave wears to represent that he is a servant of his master. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Sacks pointed out based on this distinction that, while maybe counterintuitive, we see that Hashem <em>demands</em> that we see ourselves as children and <em>requests</em> that we see ourselves as servants. Apparently to be an eved just because the Torah demands it and we have to is not the kind of service that Hashem is interested in. Hashem wants us to opt in. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Its \"importance\" only begins once the obligation of doing the mitzvah begins. As long as one doesn't wear a four cornered garment the obligation of doing the mitzvah does not yet begin so that importance does not exist yet.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this is even part of what that halacha of the Shulchan aruch teaches us.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>After the story of the wood-gatherer, Moshe turned to Hashem and said \"during the week we have <em>tefillin</em> which serves to remind us of all the commandments in the Torah; on Shabbos, we have nothing like that.\" Hashem replied that He would give us the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>tzitzis</em> to fill that role (see Ohr HaChaim Num. 15:37)</p>\n\n<p>I heard an explanation from Rabbi Yissachar Frand where he examined the similarities of the language used at the beginning of the story of the <em>meraglim</em> (\"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>v'yasuru...</em></a>\";\"<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lasur es ha'aretz</a></em>\") and the <em>parsha</em> of <em>tzitzis</em> (\"<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.39?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">v'lo sasuru...</a></em>\") which appears at the end of that Torah portion. </p>\n\n<p>The commentaries explain that the sending of the <em>meraglim</em> was an optional idea; God didn't command it but allowed <em>b'nei Yisrael</em> to implement this mission. Unfortunately, it ended in an unmitigated disaster. Rabbi Frand posited that the parallel language used in the mitzvah of <em>tzitzis</em> was to illustrate to us the importance of properly fulfilling even optional <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "When asking for personal requests in Shemoneh Esrei, how should one phrase them?",
    "content": "# When asking for personal requests in Shemoneh Esrei, how should one phrase them?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (OC 119:1) rules that one may add to a middle Brachah (i.e. from Atah Chonein to Shema Koleinu, inclusive) of Shemoneh Esrei a personal request on the topic; for instance, if one wishes to daven for a sick person, he may include it at the end of Refa’einu. In Shema Koleinu, one may add any requests he has. The Rema holds that one may only add to the end of a Bracha. The Shulchan Aruch quotes Rabbeinu Yonah that one who davens for many people should phrase his request in the plural, and one who davens for an individual should phrase his request in the singular, though if one adds to Shema Koleinu or the end of Shemoneh Esrei, he can phrase it however he wishes. </p>\n\n<p>Other than those brief statements there (which is all the Shulchan Aruch quotes on the topic), how should one phrase it? If one is davening in Hebrew, should he add his requests in Hebrew as well? If one is davening for himself, should he just refer to himself in the first person, or should he use his full name (ben/bas mother’s name)? Does it even matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (101:4) brings two opinions about asking your personal requests - such as for a sick person or other situations - in language other than Lashon HaKodesh. However, if one is davening with a minyan or in the presence of a sick person (M\"B 101:9), where Hashem's accepts the tefila directly, he may daven in any language according to all opinions.</p>\n\n<p>The reason one must say the name of a choleh when davening, is so that his tefila is clear. Therefore when davening in the presence of the choleh, no name needs to be said (Aruch HaShulchan 119:1). The אשי ישראל פרק כ\"ג הערה קפ\"ט quotes ר' חיים קניבסקי that when davening for one's own child they can just say בני/בתי and their name without the mothers name. It follows that when asking for yourself, you can be \"clear\" without saying any names.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (.נדרים מ) brings from Mekubalim, that it is better not to say the name of a choleh if one can daven without mentioning their name, such as when in the presence of the choleh.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>You can pray in the language which is easiest for you and do not need the full name of the person.</p>\n\n<p>R Heshy Kleinman in <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422600153.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Praying with fire</a> (p. 209) writes </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All of these [personal prayer] requests <strong>can even be made in the person's own language</strong> if\n  he has difficulty reciting them in Hebrew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then quotes the Chaye Adam (quoted by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.122.2?lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.122.8&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brura 122:8</a>) on the importance of adding personal requests to <em>Elokai Netzor</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is appropriate and worthwhile for every person to pray each day\n  specifically for his own financial needs, and other practical part of\n  life, and that his children should be Torah scholars and that all his\n  descendants should be God fearing people... <strong>And if he cannot phrase\n  these thoughts in the Hebrew language of prayer, let him say his\n  thoughts in his own language as long as they come from the depths of\n  his heart.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also SA <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.101.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 101:4</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I saw in another <em>sefer</em> (but couldn't find it now) that a prayer should be phrased starting with \"May it be Your will that\". I found a proof to that in the prayer composed by the Chazon Ish (Kovetz Igrot Chazon Ish 1:74) for the success of a child in Torah study</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>May it be Your will, our God and the God of our fathers, that</strong> you have\n  mercy on my child (name and the mother's name) and turn his heart to\n  love and fear Your Name and to dedicate himself to the study of our\n  Holy Torah; and remove all the factors which prevent him from Torah\n  study, and prepare all the factors which will bring him closer to\n  learning your holy Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that same sefer, it said one can pray for himself by saying \"May it be your will that you help me etc.\" without using one's full name. This is similar to how one can pray in presence of a sick person without using his full name.</p>\n\n\n",

The Hebrew is the original, via Sefaria, and the English is the most literal translation I can muster that makes any sort of sense. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מה טבו אהליך.</strong> על שראה פתחיהם שאינן מכוונין זה מול זה (ב\"ב ס, א): </p>\n  \n  <p>“How goodly are your tents” - on that [Bilam] saw that their openings weren’t directly facing this one. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So they could have been facing toward each other, as long as it’s not a direct angle wherein they could see straight into each others’ tents. </p>\n\n<p>I looked at the Gemara and it seems this is the Gemara’s intention as well. As above, the Hebrew is via Sefaria, and the English is as literal as I can make it. The square brackets are added for clarity, while the curly brackets are added based on Rashbam’s commentary. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מתני׳</strong> לא יפתח אדם לחצר השותפין פתח כנגד פתח וחלון כנגד חלון ... <strong>גמ׳</strong> מנהני מילי א\"ר יוחנן דאמר קרא (במדבר כד, ב) וישא בלעם את עיניו וירא את ישראל שוכן לשבטיו מה ראה ראה שאין פתחי אהליהם מכוונין זה לזה אמר ראוין הללו שתשרה עליהם שכינה:</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Mishnah:</strong> A man cannot open into a courtyard of partners a door facing a door and a window facing a window. ... <strong>Gemara:</strong> From where are these words [sourced]? Said R’ Yochanan, “[it’s] as the verse says, ‘And Bilam raised his eyes, and he saw Yisrael camping according to its tribes.’ What did he see? He saw that their tents were not directly facing each other {and therefore said ‘how goodly are your tents’}. He said, ‘It is fitting that these should have the Shechinah rest on them.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don’t see any indication from this verse that they faced any particular direction. If anything, the fact that they faced each other, just not directly head-on, indicates that they faced in multiple directions. </p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Wherever you got that original quote from is either wrong or misleading. It’s not that they didn’t face each other, but that they didn’t face directly at each other, so that they couldn’t see into the neighbors’ homes directly from their own. </p>\n\n\n",

The following theory is based mostly on the commentary of R. Yissachar Tamar to Yerushalmi Megillah 4:1, reproduced below with key parts bolded.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud tells us of a decree promulgated by Ezra:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=31b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 31b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא ר' שמעון בן אלעזר אומר עזרא תיקן להן לישראל שיהו קורין קללות\n  שבתורת כהנים קודם עצרת ושבמשנה תורה קודם ר\"ה מאי טעמא אמר אביי ואיתימא\n  ריש לקיש כדי שתכלה השנה וקללותיה בשלמא שבמשנה תורה איכא כדי שתכלה שנה\n  וקללותיה אלא שבתורת כהנים אטו עצרת ראש השנה היא אין עצרת נמי ראש השנה\n  היא דתנן ובעצרת על פירות האילן</p>\n  \n  <p>It has been taught: R. Simeon b. Eleazar says: Ezra made a regulation\n  for Israel that they should read the curses in Leviticus before\n  Pentecost and those in Deuteronomy before New Year. What is the\n  reason? — Abaye — or you may also say Resh Lakish said: So that the\n  year may end along with its curses. I grant you that in regard to the\n  curses in Deuteronomy you can say, ‘so that the year should end along\n  with its curses’. But as regards those In Leviticus — is Pentecost a\n  New Year? — Yes; Pentecost is also a New Year, as we have learnt: ‘On\n  Pentecost is the new year for [fruit of] the tree’. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Megilah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino\n  translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In order to read these sections before Shavuot and Rosh Hashanah (without skipping) one must of necessity complete the entire Torah every year. How then could there have been a triennial cycle, if that would fly in the face of Ezra's decree?</p>\n\n<p>This question is in fact asked by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Emden\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Emden</a>, and he has no answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא מיהא הא קשיא לי טובא דהאמרינן שילהי מכילתין עזרא תקן שיהו קורין\n  קללות שבת\"כ לפני עצרת ושל משנה תורה לפני ר\"ה וכה\"ג [דמנהג בני מערבא]\n  מי מתרמי להו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is similarly pointed out by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Chajes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Tzvi Hirsch Chajes</a>, who likewise has no answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נ\"ב לפ\"ז לא ידעתי לבני מערבא דמסקי אורייתא בתלת שנין עי' לעיל כ\"ט ע\"ב\n  איך היו עושים בתקנת עזרא זאת שתבא  קריאת הקללות קודם עצרת בכל שנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it is possible that Ezra's decree never fully took hold in all of Israel, because it was too much for the people to bear, just like we find regarding his decree requiring immersion after a seminal emission. The reason why it would have been to hard to bear was that the Torah was read with a verse-by-verse Aramaic translation. In order to complete the entire Torah in one year with the verse-by-verse translation, many hours of Synagogue services would be necessary. that was simply too much for the people, so they only completed 1/3 of the Torah each year.</p>\n\n<p>However, the practice of reading the Torah with the verse-by-verse translation eventually died out. Already in the ~Twelfth Century Tosafot states that this was no longer the custom. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=23b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 23b s.v.

To keep things straight I’m referring to the people in question as Reuven and Shimon instead of “him” and “him.”</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַמַּדִּיר אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ שֶׁיֹּאכַל אֶצְלוֹ, וְהוּא אֵינוֹ מַאֲמִינוֹ עַל הַמַּעַשְׂרוֹת, אוֹכֵל עִמּוֹ בַּשַּׁבָּת הָרִאשׁוֹנָה, וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵינוֹ מַאֲמִינוֹ עַל הַמַּעַשְׂרוֹת, וּבִלְבַד שֶׁיֹּאמַר לוֹ מְעֻשָּׂרִין הֵן. וּבְשַׁבָּת שְׁנִיָּה, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנָּדַר מִמֶּנּוּ הֲנָיָה, לֹא יֹאכַל עַד שֶׁיְּעַשֵּׂר: </p>\n  \n  <p>If Reuven makes a neder that Shimon cannot benefit from him if Shimon does not eat by him, but Shimon doesn’t trust Reuven regarding Ma’aser, Shimon may eat by Reuven for Reuven’s Shabbos Sheva Berachos, even though Shimon doesn’t trust him regarding Ma’aser, as long as Reuven tells him Ma’aser has been taken. If it’s the Shabbos after Sheva Berachos, then even if Reuven made a neder against benefit, Shimon cannot eat by him until he takes off Ma’aser himself. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Drawing the analogy over to “regular” Kashrus, since meat can’t be shechted again once it’s already neveilah, Shimon would be stuck and unable to eat by Reuven. </p>\n\n<p>Now, it’s not an exact comparison: Demai is only Rabbinic, and so it’s much more lenient than other prohibitions against eating; maybe that’s the only reason that they were lenient in a case where he made a neder. By ordinary Kashrus, which is much stricter, certainly Shimon would be unable to eat by him. </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that some cases people are generally strict not to eat when there’s nothing wrong with it. Take eating on glass plates: glass does not absorb and therefore can be used for both milchigs and fleishigs, provided it’s cleaned and beyond 24 hours from its last use at the strictest (see, ex., <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25909/9682\">here</a>. Some people insist on being stricter, but it’s not necessary. There are many such instances; the line of logic above is only when the food is a concern of being actually treif. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Somehow it totally slipped my mind before, but ultimately this ends up being a classic case of Safek d’Oraisa l’chumra. </p>\n\n\n",

Yeshaya gave him a Nevuah that he would die from this illness, and after telling Chizkiya that there was nothing that could be done at this point, as the decree had already been handed down, Chizkiya had this to say:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בן אמוץ כלה נבואתך וצא כך מקובלני מבית אבי אבא אפי' חרב חדה מונחת על צוארו של אדם אל ימנע עצמו מן הרחמים</p>\n  \n  <p>Son of Amotz, cease your prophecy and leave! Thus have I accepted from the house of my forefather: even if a sharp sword is placed on a person’s neck, he should not withhold himself from mercy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As the verses in Yeshaya 38 continue, Chizkiya davened that he recover, and indeed he did, gaining for himself another 15 years on the throne. </p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, the tradition to which Chizkiya refers is the fact that, as described at the very end of Sefer Shmuel, his forefather David saw the malach prepared to smite Yerushalayim but still prayed.</p>\n\n<p>What we see from here is that even if all seems lost, the doors of prayer are never closed. One is always able to pray. </p>\n\n<p>In fact, this is actually codified in Halacha. One who is on his deathbed should say Vidui, whose basic text, as recorded by the Shulchan Aruch (YD 338:2), reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מוֹדֶה אֲנִי לְפָנֶיךָ ה' אֱלֹהַי וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתַי שֶׁרְפוּאָתִי וּמִיתָתִי בְּיָדְךָ, יְהִי רָצוֹן מִלְּפָנֶיךָ שֶׁתְּרַפְּאֵנִי רְפוּאָה שְׁלֵמָה, וְאִם אָמוּת, תְּהֵא מִיתָתִי כַּפָּרָה עַל כָּל חֲטָאִים וַעֲוֹנוֹת וּפְשָׁעִים, שֶׁחָטָאתִי וְשֶׁעָוִיתִי וְשֶׁפָּשַׁעְתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ, וְתֵן חֶלְקִי בְּגַן עֵדֶן, וְזַכֵּנִי לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא הַצָּפוֹן לַצַּדִּיקִים.</p>\n  \n  <p>I admit to You, Hashem, my G-d and the G-d of my forefathers, that my healing and my death are in Your hands. May it be Your will before You that You heal me with a complete healing, but if I die, may my death be an atonement for all of my sins which I have sinned before You, and give my portion in Gan Eden, and may I merit the World to Come which is hidden in waiting for the righteous. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While a large portion of this prayer describes the imminent death which the one praying will seemingly be subjected to, what it is <em>really</em> saying is that Hashem should spare him and let him live, but that if he should die anyway, at least let it be an atonement for his sins. Like by Chizkiya and David, the one praying should never despair, even if there is a sharp sword on his throat. </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps you may argue that the OP’s case is different, though, as it’s someone else davening for him, rather than the patient davening for himself. To that I point to an earlier Gemara in Berachos, on 5b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין חבוש מתיר עצמו מבית האסורים</p>\n  \n  <p>A prisoner cannot free himself from prison. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In context, this means that while a sick person cannot pray to be saved from his own ailment, someone else can. Certainly in our case, where a sick person <em>can</em> save himself, someone else can!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://nmhs.blogspot.com/2006/06/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">National Medical Halacha Society</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Praying for a Miracle</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Rav Hershel Schachter</strong> writes regarding the prohibition of asking G-d for a miracle: \"The Shaarei Teshuvah quotes the three exceptions\n  to the rule as stated by the Acharonim, as to when one is permitted to\n  ask for a nes: 1) One may ask for a nes nistar. For this is what\n  hashgacha is all about- God controls the world from behind the scenes,\n  without openly violating any of the rules of nature. 2)Since we\n  believe that, \"ein mazal le-yisrael,\" that the Jewish people are,\n  \"lemala min hateva,\" there is nothing at all improper about requesting\n  a nes nigleh on their behalf. 3) Even if the nes is not for Klal\n  Yisrael, but only on behalf of an unusual tzadik, this too is allowed,\n  as is evidenced from the various stories related in the Gemara Taanit\n  regarding several tzadikim who prayed for miracles. The great tzadik\n  is also \"lemala min hateva.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>In Parshat Korach we find Moshe Rabbeinu requesting of God that even\n  if the opening of Gehenom not be here, that He make a nes and \"yivra\n  Hashem\" - let it move to here. Because the miracle was needed- either\n  for klal yisrael or the unusual tzadik- Moshe was allowed to pray for\n  it. A similar situation appears in the Haftorah. Shmuel Ha-navi calls\n  upon God to bring about a miracle on Shmuel's personal behalf, to\n  indicate his righteousness. This appears to be the thematic similarity\n  between the sedra and the Haftorah: the exceptions to the rule i.e.\n  when one is permitted to pray for a miracle.</p>\n  \n  <p>To illustrate this point, I remember many years ago, when I visited\n  the Ponovez Yeshina in Benai Brak, the tzibbur was reciting tehillim\n  on behalf of a cancer patient on whom the doctors had given up hope.\n  The Mashgiach, Rav Yecheskel Levenstein - refused to participate in\n  the prayers because in effect they were praying for a miracle.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>There is much discussion in the medical halacha literature regarding\n  the permissibility of praying for the DEATH of a terminally-ill\n  patient. However, it appears from Rav Shachter's analysis above that\n  the reverse question must also be addressed. Is one allowed to pray\n  for the continued LIFE of a terminal patient? The answer, I suspect,\n  is not absolute. In many cases praying for the cure of a terminal\n  patient may only require a nes nistar, which is permissible.\n  Apparently, Rav Levenstein ZT\"L felt that an even more open miracle\n  would have been required in the case of the cancer patient.</p>\n  \n  <p>Avi Oppenheimer</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This appears to be addressed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ben_Samuel_of_Regensburg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# Why is emphasis put on the sparing of the Jewish people at Makas Bechoros more than at any of the other Makos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shmos 12:27 --------------- שמות יב כז</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַאֲמַרְתֶּ֡ם זֶֽבַח־פֶּ֨סַח ה֜וּא לַֽיהוָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר פָּ֠סַח\n  עַל־בָּתֵּ֤י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בְּמִצְרַ֔יִם בְּנָגְפּ֥וֹ\n  אֶת־מִצְרַ֖יִם וְאֶת־בָּתֵּ֣ינוּ הִצִּ֑יל...׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And you shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to the LORD, because\n  He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He smote the\n  Egyptians, but saved our houses..</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The pasuk tells us that The korban Pesach was brought for, and called so - (and so too is called (by chazal) the name of the Holiday itself), because Hashem was \"<em>poseach</em>\" (which means either skipped over or had mercy on, or let escape, depending on different meforshim (commetaries), and did not kill the firstborn sons of the Jew during <em>Makas B'choros</em> (plague of the firstborn) when he killed the firstborn sons of the Mitzrim (Eygyptians).</p>\n\n<p>As the pasuk says (ibid 23 - פסוק כג)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>וְעָבַ֣ר יְהוָה֮ לִנְגֹּ֣ף אֶת־מִצְרַיִם֒ וְרָאָ֤ה אֶת־הַדָּם֙</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>עַל־הַמַּשְׁק֔וֹף וְעַ֖ל שְׁתֵּ֣י הַמְּזוּזֹ֑ת וּפָסַ֤ח יְהוָה֙\n  עַל־הַפֶּ֔תַח וְלֹ֤א יִתֵּן֙ הַמַּשְׁחִ֔ית לָבֹ֥א אֶל־בָּתֵּיכֶ֖ם\n  לִנְגֹּֽף׃</p>\n  \n  <p>For when the LORD goes through to smite the Egyptians, He will see the\n  blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, and the LORD will pass over\n  the door and not let the Destroyer enter and smite your home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Question: Why is so much emphasis put on the saving/sparing of the Jewish people specifically at <em>Makas Bechoros</em> more than at any one of the other <em>Makos</em> which also affected only the <em>Mitzrim</em> and not the Jews?</p>\n\n<p>I would even go further and say that there were other Makos at which sparing the Jews from being smitten was a greater wonder and miracle than that of <em>Makas B'choros</em>. for example, <em>Makas Arov</em>, the plauge of wild animals. When there are many wild animals roaming the city, and they stay away from any Jewish person, that is quite a wonder. Also <em>Makas Arbeh</em>, The locust, where huge throngs of locust cover the cities and eat every drop of vegetation of any kind belonging to the Mitzrim, and they selectively spare anything beolonging to a Jew. This phenominon is quite evident during other Makos also.</p>\n\n<p>At Makos B'choros there was no desease or epidemic going on which may have been contracted by some Jewish people along the way. It was totally like what the Israeli Mosad calls \"<em>chisul m'mukad</em>\" \"pointedly targeted elimination\", where each specific target is pointed out and exclusivly eliminated.</p>\n\n<p>[Although chazal tell us, in regard to <em>Makas B'choros</em> \"כיון שניתן רשות למשחית אינו מבחין בין צדיק לרשע\" -  once permission is given to the destroying angel, he makes no distinction between righteous and wicked - But this was avoided by the Jews not leaving their homes during Makos B'choros. (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.12.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.12.22.5&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">RASHI ibid 12:22</a>, together with the fact that Hashm did not allow the <em>Malach Hamoves</em>, the Angel of death, to go out on his own that night but accompanied him on this mission of this targeted elimination. (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.12.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Daat_Zkenim_on_Exodus.12.23.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'as Z'keinim</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.12.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni,_Exodus.12.23.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a>).</p>\n\n<p>So, why is all the excitement about the <em>posachti</em>/saving/sparing the Jews at <em>Makas B'choros</em> more than at any of the other <em>Makos</em>, when the same took place during the other Makos, and is seemingly even more pointworthy?</p>\n\n\n",

Skip to the line break below if you don't want the intro.</p>\n<p>A preview of the answer is that <strong>there is no issue to invest in such a company as a minority investor is not in a controlling position - therefore the workers are not working for the investor.</strong> See below for rationale.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The background is that a Jew is permitted to own a non-controlling amount of shares in a Gentile-owned company which operates on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>R Yosef Kushner, the author of <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/commerce-and-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Commerce and Shabbos</a> writes p. 324</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is because the Jewish minority shareholder is not in a position\nto decide the operating schedule of the business and the controlling\npartners are running the business on Shabbos by their own choice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a Jew to be the controlling partner or sole owner of a company that remains in operation on Shabbos, a number of requirements need to be met</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>the day to day managing and running of the company is delegated to a non-Jewish CEO (\"<em>baal melacha</em>\")</li>\n<li>the Jew doesn't require the non-Jewish CEO to keep the business operating on Shabbos, rather he allows him to run the business as he\nsees fit</li>\n<li>the non-Jewish CEO receives a small percentage of the company profits in addition to his salary</li>\n<li>it is common knowledge that the Jew is not involved in the daily running of the business and is simply a financial backer in the\ncompany</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example the Orthodox financier <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Reichmann\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshe Reichman</a> once purchased an oil company which had to operate on Shabbat and asked <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Miller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Shlomo Miller</a> what to do, who in turned asked R Moshe Feinstein. Since the CEO/<em>baal melacha</em> was non-Jewish, RMF said there was no issue (heard from R Kushner at 24'40'' on this <a href=\"http://podcast.headlinesbook.com/e/6218-guest-hosted-by-shadchan-freddy-friedman-and-elchonon-schwartz-lmhc/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">podcast</a>).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now I assume your question is on a company like facebook where the founder owns a minority of the shares but a controlling amount of them (57.9% as of September 3, 2020 according to <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/082216/top-9-shareholders-facebook-fb.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Investopedia</a>) and where both CEO and Deputy CEO are identifying as Jews.</p>\n<p>Such a company does not meet the criteria above. Leaving aside whether the controlling stakeholder can work there halachically, another Jew might be prevented from buying shares in that company as he would become a partner of the Jewish controlling owner and be responsible for e.g., <em>hilul</em> Shabbat if the company has to operate 7/7.</p>\n<p>I didn't find explicit differences in halacha between controlling shareholder and majority shareholder. A controlling shareholder can sell the company, change its strategy, direct its activities just as much as a majority shareholder. Even more so when he is also the CEO.</p>\n<p>Now outside of Israel, it can be presumed that a majority of people working on Shabbat in such a company are non-Jews (since the majority of people outside Israel are non-Jews). Also in such a large company, the CEO doesn't directly direct work. So if there are Jews working on Shabbat, it is statistically likely that the managers ordering them to do so are non-Jews.</p>\n<p>As such it is possible that one could apply the rulings of R Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe Even HaEzer I:7) and R Yitzchak Weiss (Minchat Yitzchak III:1) who both permitted holding even the majority of shares of a company which is open on Shabbat as long as only non-Jews work on Shabbat (as reported <a href=\"http://www.besr.org/library/stocks5.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Also, and likely to be the most convincing, R Doniel Neustadt writes <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/weekly-halacha-5770-vaeschanan/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most contemporary poskim rule that buying stock shares is not\nconsidered to be aiding and abetting Shabbos desecrators as there is\nno shortage of investors who are ready and able to buy shares. Anyone\nwho buys shares does so for his own investment purposes and not for\nthe purpose of financing the company.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Finally I asked your question to R Yosef Kushner who wrote the above book. He responded (and agreed to be quoted)</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[There is no issue] to invest in that company as the investor is still\nnot in a controlling position, so the workers are not working for the\ninvestor, and in terms of לפני עור (<em><a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Lifnei_Iver\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lifnei iver</a></em>), that the\ninvestor is helping facilitate a transgression, that would not be an\nissue since they could easily run the company without the investors\nmoney.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above are obviously only considerations to bring up before asking the question to a qualified rav.</p>\n\n\n",

Normally Kohanims we are tall.. handsome..big hands.. etc. I can easily recognize a fellow cohen.</p>\n\n<p>For instance I was in Europe not long ago, and someone say here a new person in the synagogue he says is a cohen, why dont u go and talk to him.. Which I did, I looked at him (I thought right away was not a kohen) asked one question or two, and I told him he was not a cohen unfortunatelly (I talked to him i n a good kind manner) because he wasnt a cohen after all, only the last name.</p>\n\n<p>Ah also, since my family is well known cohen family, I asked my Rab that is an av bet din (he is also a Cohen) and that he has known (and his father and grandfather before him) that we are kohanim..I asked him to make me like a certificate of being a kohen. Something saying he saw me performing birkat kohanim to me and to also my father, etc.\nWith the credentials, stamp, etc. HE is a very important Rab.</p>\n\n<p>Interesting enough after presenting that and other things in Israel, like the ketubah of my parents or grandparents saying that is a kohen, etc. I added to my last name the title Hakohen.

There are a large number of possible, acceptable interpretations of a verse. Chazal picking one of them does not preclude him from preferring another. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, it should not be surprising that Ramban is willing to explain the sin of the Golden Calf somewhat differently to the way it was explained by Chazal (and Rashi).</p>\n\n\n",

You will see that - 1) It is debatable if one needs to wash at all. (Most would agree that one should, of course, for sanitary reasons, if not halachic ones.) 2 - If one does wash, does he need to use a cup?</p>\n\n<p>I encourage you to read the full article, so that first, you can understand it, yourself. (Even after reading it, I have some trouble :) Only, <strong>then</strong> would I attempt to explain it to a Gentile. (There's little worse than trying to explain a halachic matter that you don't understand yourself to a Gentile. It would make you look foolish!) I'm excerpting what I think is the most relevant parts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All the sources that mention a non-Beit Hamikdash-related washing\n  after the bathroom are post-Talmudic.[4] These sources include the\n  Tashbetz, Kolbo and Mordechai, all of whom are cited by the Beit Yosef\n  (OC 4). Other than cleanliness, there are two reasons discussed for\n  the washing. Similar to washing before davening (OC 92:4), some view\n  it as a preparation for reciting the berachah Asher Yatzar after using\n  the bathroom (see Tur OC 165 and commentaries). Additionally,\n  according to the Mishnah Berurah (4:40; 227:11) and others, merely\n  entering a beit hakisei (an old-fashioned as opposed to a modern\n  bathroom) imposes a ruach ra, which must be removed by washing.[5]\n  However, the mishnah regarding the Temple referred to above presumably\n  refers to a Kohen who took care of his needs in a bathroom[6] and yet\n  the Talmud makes no mention of a ruach ra. Furthermore, many\n  authorities argue that a modern, clean, multi-purpose bathroom does\n  not convey a ruach ra even if an old-fashioned bathroom does.[7] </p>\n  \n  <p>The Aruch Hashulchan (OC 7:3) summarizes these sources as follows: If,\n  while using the facilities, one did not touch anything dirty or any\n  part of his body that is normally covered, there is no requirement to\n  wash at all. Nonetheless, the custom is to wash, either because of\n  cleanliness or because it is proper in order to say Asher Yatzar. He\n  observes that some have the custom to wash thrice, but the Beit Yosef\n  does not rule that way. The Aruch Hashulchan makes no mention of a\n  keli or ruach ra.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to those who hold that the washing is for cleanliness or in\n  preparation for Asher Yatzar, there are few ritual requirements.\n  Similar to the washing prior to davening, such a washing requires\n  neither a keli nor three washings. According to the Mishnah Berurah\n  (4:38), which holds that the washing is due to a ruach ra, the washing\n  still has fewer rules than other ritual washings—such as for bread—and\n  does not require a keli (Mishnah Berurah 165:2). The washing after\n  using the bathroom is more akin to a washing for hygienic reasons,\n  such as is required after removing one’s shoes or cutting one’s hair\n  (Shulchan Aruch OC 4:18). Because the ruach ra of a bathroom is less\n  potent than that which exists upon awakening (Sha’arei Teshuvah 4:12),\n  only one washing is required for the former, while three are required\n  for the latter (Magen Avraham 7:1).[8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Of course, when explaining to a Gentile, use the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">KISS</a>\" method. Don't try reciting multiple <em>shitot</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>It is forbidden to teach a gentile this, for it is part of Torah and one may not teach a gentile Torah.\nThe reasons for the mitzvos, minhagim etc. are all part of Torah, whether it is a mitzvah of the Torah, D'rabanan, (Rabbinical) or just a <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=4938\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">minhag yisrael</a>. Minhag is also Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So in answer to your question \"How does one explain to a non-Jew...?\" The answer is>> <strong>One doesn't!</strong></p>\n\n\n",

This is where they began to say to the people in their tents that the land consumes its inhabitants. </p>\n\n<p>The spies claim that the Land was deadly contradicted what they had said earlier about the fertility of the Land in front of Moses and Aaron that it flows with milk and honey [at Shelach, 13:27]. This was one of the lies they perpetrated to the people in their tents but not while in front of Moses and Aaron. They also embellished their wording to incite despair so the people would not be willing to fight.</p>\n\n<p>Later, in 13:33 they exaggerated their description of the Anak calling them Nephilim descendents of Anak to try to frighten and terrify the people further. (This differs from their description of them in 13:23 where they are referred to merely as יְלִידֵ֖י הָֽעֲנָ֑ק 'descendants of Anak'.) </p>\n\n<p>After some searching I am doubtful whether Anak are truly descendants of Nephilim. It appears the spies lied (with maybe some possibility in their minds that it could be true to justify portraying such a lie). I have not come across any hard evidence. How would the spies truly know the sons of Anak were from Nephilim besides some 'weak unverified evidence' of their historical account which the Ramban addresses in his commentary at 13:33. This seems to be the way (at least I interpret) the Ramban is portraying this idea of the spies having lied.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הם \"מן הנפלים\" הקדמונים אשר שמעתם עליהם כי המה הגבורים \"אשר מעולם אנשי השם\" (בראשית ו ד).  They are from \"the Nephilim\" of the ancient times whom you have heard about them for they were the mighty, \"who are from old, men of reknown\". </p>\n  \n  <p>ולפי שהיה ענין הנפילים שבדורות נח נודע בעולם, הזכירו להם שאלו בני הענק מהם, כדי ליראם ולבהלם. ולכך אמרו עתה \"ונהי בעינינו כחגבים וכן היינו בעיניהם \"And since they were the Niphilim that were in the generations of Noah were known throughout the world they mentioned to them that they were, the sons of Anak from them\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also in Genesis Rabbah 26:7 Nephilim are referred to as seven names and Anakim is indeed one of them.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַנְּפִלִים הָיוּ בָאָרֶץ בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם (בראשית ו, ד), שִׁבְעָה שֵׁמוֹת נִקְרְאוּ לָהֶם, אֵימִים, \n  רְפָאִים, גִּבּוֹרִים, זַמְזֻמִּים, עֲנָקִים, עַוִּים, נְפִלִים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However there is a footnote by Yefeh To'ar in the Artscroll Midrash Rabbah that clarifies they were not proginators of the giants in Deuteronomy, for the giants referred to in Genesis 6:4 were destroyed in the Flood. The seven names are meant to reference families of giants before and after the Flood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The fact that the meraglim lied is stated in the passuk <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.13?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bamidbar 13:32)</a> וַיּוֹצִ֜יאוּ <strong>דִּבַּ֤ת הָאָ֙רֶץ֙</strong> אֲשֶׁ֣ר תָּר֣וּ אֹתָ֔הּ אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל</p>\n\n<p>Thus they spread <strong><a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/calumny\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">calumnies</a></strong> among the Israelites about the land they had scouted.

After the fourth one, he had violated his nezirus, and was punished by losing his strength.</p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Jumping up with your hair tied into a loom definitely has the consequence of those hairs being torn out of your head.  According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.50b.1?lang=he&p2=Rashi_on_Shabbat.50b.1.4&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Shabbos 50b</a>, the halachos of psik reisha apply to Nazir as well as to Shabbos*.  Therefore, jumping up with the loom should have been an active violation of his nezirus.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the fourth time, he didn't actively do anything - Delilah was the one who cut his hair while he was sleeping, and if he had been awake he probably would have objected.  It's not obvious to me that this is forbidden on a Torah level, and the relevant derabbanans most likely hadn't been introduced yet.</p>\n\n<p>For all these reasons, the third time should have been a worse violation of his nezirus.</p>\n\n<p>It didn't <em>actually</em> turn out that way, because Hashem made a miracle and his hairs had supernatural strength.  But He could have made the same miracle when Delilah cut his hair and just made her fail.  Why did Hashem miraculously prevent Shimshon from actively violating his nezirus but not from passively violating it?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>* <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.50b.1?lang=he&p2=Tosafot_on_Shabbat.50b.1.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos</a> disagrees with Rashi about the particulars of the case in that Gemara and says that the problem there is davar hamiskavein rather than psik reisha (some discussion <a href=\"http://hearos.blogspot.com/2012/11/shabbos-50b-psik-reisha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), but it's not clear that he disagrees with the application of psik reisha to a Nazir in other cases - such as trying to lift up a loom by the strength of 7 hairs.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the source?</p>\n  \n  <p>Answer:</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sephardic custom is that the Chazan stands on the raised platform\n  in the center of the Shul. This custom appears in Sefer Hamanhig who\n  explains that it is based on the Talmud Succah 51b. The Talmud\n  describes that in the Shul of Alexandria, Egypt there was a wooden\n  raised platform in the middle and the Chazan stood on it, and when it\n  was time to answer Amen, they would wave with a cloth do to the huge\n  size of the Shul.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Ashkenazi custom is that the Chazan stands in front of the Amud\n  near the Holy Ark. The custom should not be changed and the Chazan\n  should not stand on the raised platform in the middle of the Shul\n  unless it is an unusual case were there are very many people, and the\n  Chazan will not be heard if he does not stand at the Bimah. This\n  custom appears in the Tur and is explained at length in Igrot Moshe.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Magen Avraham writes that nowadays the custom is that the place\n  were the Chazan stands is lower than the rest of the Shul, because of\n  “Mima’amakim Kraticha Hashem”, and that is the reason the Chazan is\n  always called “Yored Lifnei Hateivah” [goes down in front of the\n  Teivah]. This Halachah is also quoted by the Misnah Berurah, but\n  nevertheless the Igrot Moshe explains that the custom in most places\n  is not like the Magen Avraham but like the Shulchan Aruch and Rema\n  that don’t require a low place.</p>\n  \n  <p>The custom of all is that during the reading of the Torah the Ba’al\n  Kore stands at the elevated Bimah in the center of the Shul. This\n  custom appears in the Rema, and the Biur Halacha adds that it is an\n  ancient custom that is explained in the Rambam and the Tur, and the\n  source is in Succah 51b as the Gra wrote. Unfortunately this ancient\n  custom was breached in some places, where they started placing the\n  Bimah near the Holy Ark, because they wanted to follow the way of the\n  idol worshipers, as they do in their temples. The latest Poskim spoke\n  against these people at length.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As oat bread is absolutely nasty (and expensive), I only have it on Shabbos and Yom Tov, so this question is very relevant to me.

However, in my shul, the Bimah is much closer to the front of the shul. I've seen this pattern across many shuls: some have them toward the front, some toward the back, and some in the middle. In general, among the shuls I've been to, it seems that Ashkenazim have the Bimah more central or further forward, while Sefardim have it further back. the Romaniote schul in NYC has it against the back wall. Are there any restrictions on where in the shul the Bimah may be placed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The main source for this seems to be the <strong>Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.51b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 51b</a></strong>, which states that the shul of Alexandria, Egypt had a wooden bimah in its center. Based on this Gemara, the <strong>Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.11.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Tefillah, 11:3</a>)</strong> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמַעֲמִידִין בִּימָה בְּאֶמְצַע הַבַּיִת כְּדֵי שֶׁיַּעֲלֶה עָלֶיהָ הַקּוֹרֵא בַּתּוֹרָה אוֹ מִי אֲשֶׁר אוֹמֵר לָעָם דִּבְרֵי כִּבּוּשִׁין כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּשְׁמְעוּ כֻּלָּם. וּכְשֶׁמַּעֲמִידִין הַתֵּבָה שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהּ סֵפֶר תּוֹרָה מַעֲמִידִין אוֹתָהּ בָּאֶמְצַע וַאֲחוֹרֵי הַתֵּבָה כְּלַפֵּי הַהֵיכָל וּפָנֶיהָ כְּלַפֵּי הָעָם:</p>\n<p>In the center of the building, a Bimah is erected, which the Reader of the Torah, or whoever exhorts the people, mounts, so that all the congregation may hear.

Toward the end, he asks the following question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואל תשיבני מהבימות שבונים בימים האלו בקצת מקומות בסוף בה''כ ולא באמצע וכן התיבות שעליהם מניחים התורה שהם בסוף הבימות לא באמצע</p>\n<p>Do not refute me from the Bimos which are built nowadays in some places in the back of the shul, and not in the middle, and likewise the Bimos on which they place the Torah which are placed on the back of the [first type of] Bimah and not the center...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he answers:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי העמדה באמצע אינו מהחיוב אך הכל לפי המקום והזמן שבאותם הזמנים שהיו בתי כנסיות גדולים עד מאד היו צריכים להעמיד הבימה באמצע כדי להשמיע לכל העם אבל בזמנים הללו שבעונותינו בתי כנסיות שלנו הם קטנים וכל העם שומעים יותר נוי הוא להיות לצד אחד מלהיות באמצע ואף ע''פ שעכשיו אין מעמידין הס''ת באמצע הבימה אפשר שנהגו כן לכבוד הזקנים וכבר כתבתי שלא הקפידה הברייתא על כך אלא הכל כפי המקומות</p>\n<p>...because placing it in the center is not an obligation, but rather everything goes after the place and the time. In those days [of the Rambam] when the shuls were very big, they needed to put the Bimah in the center, so that everyone could hear. But nowadays, that in our sins our shuls are much smaller, and therefore people can hear better, it's a beauty that it be to a side, rather than being in the center. And even though now we don't put the Torah in the center of the Bimah, it's possible that they did this in the honor of the elders. But I have already written that the Braisa was not particular about this, but rather everything goes after the place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Karo doesn't say anything further in either the Beis Yosef or the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.150\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur in OC 150</a></strong> says like the simple understanding of the Rambam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומעמידים בימה באמצע ב\"ה לעמוד עליה הקורא בתורה כדי שישמעו כולם</p>\n<p>And we place a Bimah in the middle of the shul to stand upon it the one who reads from the Torah, so that everyone can hear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.150.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema in OC 150:5</a></strong> as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועושין בימה באמצע ב\"ה שיעמוד עליה הקורא בתורה וישמעו כלם</p>\n<p>And we make a Bimah in the middle of the shul, that the one reading from the Torah should stand over it, and everyone will hear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To switch over to the more modern-day Poskim, the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.150.5.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bi'ur Halacha there</a></strong> argues vehemently against placing the Bimah anywhere but the center:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובעו\"ה באיזה מקומות פרצו מנהג קדומים זה והתחילו לעשות הבימות סמוך לארון הקודש מפני שרצו לילך בדרכי העו\"ג כמו שעושין בהיכלות שלהן [שקורין טעמפיל] ויש לקרוא עליהן וישכח ישראל עושהו ויבן היכלות</p>\n<p>But in our many sins, many places have broken with this earlier custom and have begun placing the Aron closer to the Aron Kodesh, because they want to go in the ways of those who serve idols, as they do in their sanctuaries (which they call a \"temple\"). There is room to apply to those [who follow this practice the verse (Hoshea 8:14)] \"And Yisrael forgot its maker, and he built [idolatrous] sanctuaries.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 1:42)</strong><sup>1</sup> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בדבר הבימה אין קפידא שיהיה באמצע בית הכנסת ממש, וכמעט שעוד עדיף שיהיה קרוב יותר לפנים, דברוב פעמים אין המתפללין ממלאין כל ביהכ״נ ועומדים רובם יותר קרוב לפנים וממילא צריכה הבימה להיות באמצע עמידת המתפללין כיון שעיקר הטעם הוא כדי שישמעו העם קה״ת.</p>\n<p>Regarding the Bimah: We aren’t particular that it should be literally in the middle of the shul, and if anything, it’s better that it should be closer to the front, since many times the congregants don’t fill the entire shul, and the majority of them stand toward the front, and it comes out that the Bimah needs to be in the middle of where the congregants are standing, since the main reason is that the congregation can hear the reading of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I don’t know that the logic of R’ Moshe would apply to every shul that it should be toward the front rather than the back, the underlying logic would remain: wherever congregants tend to stand when the shul is only partially full, the center should be where the Bimah should go.

How much more so it works to forbid the 5 grains which is forbidding the <em>Mitzvah</em> indirectly.

    "content": "# According to R' Moshe regarding the location of the Bimah in a shul, what is defined as the \"center\" of the congregation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is based off of my lengthy answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92920/9682\">here</a> regarding the location of the Bimah in a shul. As a result of that research, I was left with one question.</p>\n\n<p>In that answer, I quote R' Moshe Feinstein in Igros Moshe OC 1:42, who says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בדבר הבימה אין קפידא שיהיה באמצע בית הכנסת ממש, וכמעט שעוד עדיף שיהיה קרוב יותר לפנים, דברוב פעמים אין המתפללין ממלאין כל ביהכ״נ ועומדים רובם יותר קרוב לפנים וממילא צריכה הבימה להיות באמצע עמידת המתפללין כיון שעיקר הטעם הוא כדי שישמעו העם קה״ת.</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding the Bimah: We aren’t particular that it should be literally in the middle of the shul, and if anything, it’s better that it should be closer to the front, since many times the congregants don’t fill the entire shul, and the majority of them stand toward the front, and it comes out that the Bimah needs to be in the middle of where the congregants are standing, since the main reason is that the congregation can hear the reading of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And I inferred from there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While I don’t know that the logic of R’ Moshe would apply to every shul that it should be toward the front rather than the back, the underlying logic would remain: wherever congregants tend to stand when the shul is only partially full, the center should be where the Bimah should go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Based on the above, what defines the \"center\" of the congregation? Let's say that 90% of the congregation is in the front, and 10% is in the back, with a wide gap in between them. If I were to draw a shape that perfectly encompasses all congregants, the center of that shape would roughly approximate the actual center of the room. On the other hand, 90% of the congregation is in the front, so perhaps the Bimah should be further toward the front, in the mean center of the population.</p>\n\n<p>I am asking specifically according to this understanding of R' Moshe. I don't want answers according to other opinions. I will accept answers that can prove my assumption wrong, though I would rather an answer that can demonstrate from a different teshuvah of R' Moshe if he addresses what he means by the center.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm inferring that when he says \"the majority of them stand toward the front\", it may be that they do this because the <em>amud</em> is at the front of the shul and this where the <em>chazzan</em> davens from. (Rav Feinstein does state that the chazzan may daven from the bimah if people can hear him better from the bimah.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, since the majority of the time people are listening to <em>tefilla</em> done by the chazzan, rather than Torah reading done on the bimah, Rav Feinstein suggests that the bimah be placed in the middle of where the congregants are, namely physically more towards the front of the shul rather than specifically the geometric center of the shul. This way, people have the advantage of equally hearing the chazzan as well as Torah reading.</p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that Rav Feinstein allows a leniency in that if the bimah happens to be in the geometric center of the shul, and people cannot hear him from the amud, then, he can daven from the bimah. To me, that implies that, with a small minyan, people should probably crowd around the amud to hear the chazzan best, as, ideally, he should daven from the amud. However, when there are many people, and thus, this is impossible, then, he allows the chazzan to daven from the bimah if it is in the geometric center.</p>\n\n<p>In summary, Rav Feinstein implies that ideally, the amud and bima should both be near the front of the shul. I rarely see this configuration, but, then, again, the shuls that I generally attend are in large buildings many of them close to a century old. When these shuls were built, they were regularly full, so it made sense to have the bimah in the center. (I won't delve into the reasoning as to why the chazzan is in front and Torah reading is in the center.) With a mostly empty shul during the past 30 years, roughly, if it were feasible to move the bimah toward the front, I guess, they should be doing that. Perhaps, this begs the question as to why the chazzan still davens from the amud or why most of the people scatter themselves around the shul when they have trouble hearing him. I guess the concept of following other people's \"Amen\" response is sufficient.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason is that since an individual does not say <em>kedushah</em>, they enacted to recite this formula, so that he has <em>kedushah</em> in his prayer, just like the <em>shaliach tzibbur</em>. So I have found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, since the paragraph לדור דור does not explicitly sanctify G-d in the way that <em>kedushah</em> does, it was enacted that an individual, who does not say <em>kedushah</em>, should instead say a paragraph beginning with אתה קדוש (You are holy) so that he too can explicitly sanctify Him.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Moshe send these spies?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi to Bamidbar 13:26, on the words וילכו ויבאו, explains that the spies left with the intention of slandering, just as when they came back. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מהו וילכו להקיש הליכתן לביאתן מה ביאתן בעצה רעה אף הליכתן בעצה רעה (סוטה לה, א): </p>\n  \n  <p>Why does it say “and they went” [when they are returning]? To connect their going with their coming. Just as their coming was with an evil plan, so was their going with an evil plan. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And Moshe knew about this, as he prayed that Yehoshua be saved from their evil plan, as Rashi explains on verse 16. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>התפלל עליו יה יושיעך מעצת מרגלים (במ\"ר. סוטה שם): </p>\n  \n  <p>[Moshe] davened for [Yehoshua]: “May Hashem save you from the plot of the spies.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So why did Moshe send the spies if he knew they had poor intentions? Even if he felt like his hand was forced - what would it look like if the people was asking for a report on what Eretz Yisrael looked like (see Rashi to v. 2) and he refused? - then why didn’t he pick better candidates? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm not sure Moshe had a choice. Once Hashem allowed him to send the spies (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi%20on%20Numbers%2013:2:2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Bamidbar 13:2</a>), I assume he would have to consult the Sanhedrin since he absolved himself from making decisions alone (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.14-16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 11:14-16</a>). The Sanhedrin outvoted him (as they can't listen just because he's greater, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 4:8</a>) and then Moshe had to send the spies.</p>\n<p>Interesting that the laws of Sanhedrin are learned from the spies (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.1.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 1:6</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p><em>I know I'm a bit unorthodox here, but I'll try, according to Drush:</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>When talking about the behavior of the fathers of our nation an important distinction must be made - knowing the TRUTH לכתחילה or בדיעבד.</p></li>\n<li><p>Many Torah stories show that there's no way לכתחילה of knowing whether a certain behavior was a Mitzvah or a sin, only בדיעבד, when Torah explicitly judges it. For example, Jacob deceiving his father, Yehuda and Tamar, Moses breaking the Luchos or Aharon making the Golden Calf - all of them looked as definite transgressions and turned out to be Mitzvot; or the opposite - Moses hitting the rock - turned out to be a sin.</p></li>\n<li><p>Same is true for the various arguments between the leaders of our nation - in the moment of the argument we can not possibly know its outcome (think Yossef vs Brothers or R' Eliezer vs Rabbis). It is only בדיעבד, when HKB\"H picks a side and reveals us who \"the Oscar goes to...\". To wit, would you consider it outrageous, if HKB\"H would pick R' Eliezer's side and kill all the Rabbis for rebelling him and the heaven's decree?</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The DISPUTE between the Spies and Moses:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Conquering the Holy Land (from the 7 nations) was a necessary step in bringing the final Geulah - there were no doubts about it. However, Moses and the spies represented different methods for achieving that: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Moses and Yehoshua held that despite the high spiritual level of Dor Hamidbar, the people could possibly change their designation from Torah scholars (Toratam Omanutam) to Torah warriors (Dor Ha'aretz) and be physically engaged in the conquest (so called \"קידוש החומר\").</p></li>\n<li><p>The tribe leaders held that confronting the evil nations could seriously harm the highest, angel-like spiritual level they achieved, but instead they would be able to eliminate the enemies in the Holy Land by being engaged in Torah learning in the Desert. <em>(This idea is very popular in Torah, Yaakov, Moses and other used it many times to fight the evil, similar to נשלמה פרים שפתינו)</em></p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Unfortunately (<em>as it always happens with our Rabbis</em>) they were all prejudiced, and they all decided the outcome before they even started the journey, <strong>hence the Haykesh of the Gemmorah.</strong> Therefore Moses warned Yehoshua not to change his mind, knowing that the spies will not change theirs.</p>\n\n<p>As we can see, when they returned, they all interpreted the facts they observed in the Land to prove their points - Yehosua claimed the severity of the situation with the evil nations proves our strengths and our trust in Hashem, while the leaders claimed the danger of falling is inevitable, and staying in the Desert is the only solution.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now to your questions:</strong> </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Moses would definitely not fail the whole nation if he knew in advance they gonna kill them all, don't you think? THat was a sure Rodef, so he could arrest them and even get them killed as the King. Therefore, Moses knew that they think differently, he did not know what HKB\"A will choose.</p></li>\n<li><p>The leaders were the peoples representatives, they were the Nesiyim of the tribes' Sanhedrins, they were all a-priori Kosher (<em>as Torah testifies, Rashi</em>)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I really hope it sheds some light on the Parshah. \n<em>NB. Very same logic applies to other disputes, like Korakh etc.</em></p>\n\n\n",

I've learnt that the root word for הָאֵ֑לֶּה is אֵ֫לֶּה which is also translated as \"these\". But there are parts in the Hebrew Scriptures where both words are translated as either \"these\" and \"those\" alike. </p>\n\n<p>For example, Deuteronomy 18:14 uses the word הָאֵ֑לֶּה (most commonly translated as \"these\") is translated as \"those\". In Numbers 16:14, the word  הָהֵ֔ם is translated as \"these\". </p>\n\n<p>Why are there two different words which seem to mean the same thing? And why is there a root word (אֵ֫לֶּה) that simply means \"these\", not \"this\" or \"that\" etc.?</p>\n\n<p>The reason I ask is because of Zechariah 8. In this chapter God says how is now going to restore Jerusalem, unlike in the former days where he was determined to punish Jerusalem for its iniquity. In this chapter. He uses both words: הָאֵ֑לֶּה and הָהֵ֔ם. </p>\n\n<p>I know this question may seem strange and irrelevant but it will be a great help to know the difference between the two words.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>אֵלֶּה is a demonstrative pronoun, the plural of the singular demonstrative pronouns זֶה‎ and זֹאת‎ (masculine and feminine respectively). הָאֵלֶּה is the same word, but with the definite article attached to it.</p>\n\n<p>הֵם is the third person masculine singular pronoun, the plural of הוּא‎, and הָהֵם is likewise the same word with the definite article attached to it.</p>\n\n<p>About the difference between them, here is a passage from Gesenius' grammar (<a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/136._The_Demonstrative_Pronoun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paragraph 136</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The distinction between them in usage is that זֶה‎ (like hic, ὅδε) almost always points out a (new) person or thing present, while הוּא‎ (like is, ille, αὐτός, ἐκεῖνος) refers to a person or thing already mentioned or known (see the examples below).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The word הָהֵם in Zechariah 8 is always in connection with הַיָּמִים הָהֵם, \"those days\" (once in the chapter הָהֵמָּה, which is no different in meaning from הָהֵם). In general (without commenting specifically on the usage in the chapter in Zechariah), these words are an exception to the rule, since the meaning is not about some aforementioned days, but about <em>those days</em> in the future: the idiom used in the Bible often has \"in those days\" or \"on that day\" (בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא) as a reference to specific days in the past or future even without having mentioned that time beforehand. This usage is also cited by Gesenius:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Nevertheless זֶה‎ and אֵ֫לֶּה‎ are also found in certain common combinations where הוּא‎ and הֵ֫מָּה‎ would be expected, and vice versa; thus almost always הַדָּבָר הַזֶּה‎, plur. הַדְּבָרִים הָאֵ֫לֶּה‎, but בַּיָּמִים הָהֵ֫מָּה‎ or בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Most of the vicinity of אסף אסיפם is at least as bad as that haftara itself. All over Tanach, there are unfortunately plenty of bad things that we've done, warnings about the punishments, and actual punishments.  Which ones are bad enough to be read with the Eicha trop?  To give a few examples from Neviim Rishonim:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Achan?</li>\n<li>ויעשו בני ישראל הרע בעיני ה' ‏, all over Shoftim?</li>\n<li>Pesel Micha?</li>\n<li>Pilegesh Begiv'ah?</li>\n<li>The Pelishtim taking the Aron, which happened at the same time as the destruction of the Mishkan in Shilo?</li>\n<li>ויעש {מלך} הרע בעיני ה'? ‏</li>\n<li>The destruction of the Beis Hamkidash at the end of Melachim?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Even in the list of pesukim that are traditionally read with the Eicha trop, the standards seem to fluctuate.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The two haftaros of the weeks before Chazon are not much better than Chazon itself, if at all.</li>\n<li>The first few pesukim of Chazon are an introduction to the entire Sefer Yeshaya, which includes plenty of good nevuos, so they're really only bad in the context of the haftara.</li>\n<li>I would have considered the tochachos worse than איכה אשא לבדי.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's pretty clear that these minhagim come from reading these verses close to Tisha Be'av.  But what about Esther, which is halfway across the year?  Setting aside the references to the destruction of the Beis Hamikdash, is איככה אוכל וראיתי any worse than other threats of bad things happening all over Tanach?</p>\n\n<p>Or are these minhagim about using Eicha trop outside of Eicha meant specifically for public reading and not for personal learning?</p>\n\n<p>Ideally, answers would be one of:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a comprehensive list of pesukim that are traditionally read with Eicha trop when learning Tanach (which could consist of just Eicha itself)</li>\n<li>general rules for determining whether a pasuk or group of pesukim is bad enough</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<h2>Where We Leyn with Eikha Trop – a saga in two parts</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Part 1: during the Tisha b'Av season</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Eikha chapters 1, 2, 4, 5 (and 3 in communities like Ḥabad that don't\nuse the chapter 3 niggun) </li>\n<li>Almost the entire haftarah for Tisha b'Av –\nJeremiah 8:13 – 9:21 (vv. 9:22-23 are usually in normal haftarah\ntrop) </li>\n<li>Much of the Shabbat Ḥazon haftarah – Isaiah 1:1–26.

We smash a glass at a wedding to stop excessive celebration, we leave a section of the wall unpainted, etc., etc. On Purim, the happiest, craziest, raunchiest day of the year, maybe we add some Eikha trop to bring us back down to earth, just a little – just as we don't read Hallel on Purim since it wasn't a complete redemption.</p>\n\n<p>There's an old joke: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>What's the difference between Yekke (aka German Jewish) Purim and\nYekke Tisha b'Av?</em></li>\n<li><em>On Purim they wear leather shoes.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It's meant to poke fun at the stereotype of the stoic, serious, fun-hating, \"Lutheran lite\" German Jew. But there's a deeper level to it. The connections between the two, the happiest exile day and the saddest exile day, are much deeper than surface-level. Perhaps we ought to remember that when we're putting on our fancy shoes next Purim. </p>\n\n\n",

This fish is listed elsewhere on the package as a product of Poland. I would seem reasonable that this would then be the hechsher of local Polish rabbi, certifying this fish for consumption, but I cannot kind this \"Crown PL\" on any lists of international kosher symbols.  It may mean something else entirely.  Does anyone know anything about this symbol?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This logo does <strong>not</strong> appear on the list of kosher products in Poland (see p. 50 of <a href=\"https://www.koszernapolska.pl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). They list (p. 35) salted herring as kosher without symbol <strong>but</strong> only when with salt and water only.</p>\n\n<p>The product above is fish with oil. Even though it is written rapeseed oil, adding small quantities of other (non-kosher) oil wouldn't necessarily need to appear on the label, and there is indeed a possibility that non-kosher oils can be used with canned fish as they are cheaper (heard from an OU Kosher interview, see also e.g., <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/btus/2016/03/21/certifying-oil-as-kosher-its-not-easy-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> from the OU). I have always read that kosher fish in water is kosher but <strong>not</strong> in oil unless there is a <em>hekhsher</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The issue becomes even more complicated when you realize the same <a href=\"http://transnationalfoods.com/our-brands/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">importer</a> also produces non-kosher <a href=\"http://transnationalfoods.com/portfolio_category/canned-seafood/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seafood</a> under the same brand incl. <a href=\"http://transnationalfoods.com/products-items/pampa-fancy-smoked-mussels/?portfolioCats=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mussels</a> and <a href=\"http://transnationalfoods.com/products-items/pampa-boiled-oysters/?portfolioCats=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">oysters</a>. It is possible they come from different factories and that the Polish herring is kosher while the seafood come from a different place but the bar for <em>kashrut</em> just became higher.</p>\n\n<p>As such you should ask your rav what to do with such fish. An alternative if you really want to find out about this possible <em>hekhsher</em> is to email Chabad in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/centers/default_cdo/aid/331526/jewish/Chabad-Lubavitch-of-Poland.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Warsaw</a> or <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/centers/default_cdo/aid/419504/jewish/Chabad-Lubavitch-of-Krakow.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Krakow</a> to ask if they have more information.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Had the very same question and found this post in my search.

Have in included the link below.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.crowncork.com/beverage-packaging\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.crowncork.com/beverage-packaging</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p><em>Before I answer, let me just state that I do not know that specific symbol.</em></p>\n\n<p>The crown (without the PL chars) looks just like the one in the link graciously posted above by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/759/double-aa\">DoubleAA</a>. But that's just about it. (And I would also suggest here Rav Umberto Piperno that allegedly seem to issue the \"Crown K\" stamps to provide some insight on the level of Kashrus he maintains and by what Laws does he abide).</p>\n\n<p>Note that symbols of \"Kosher\" can be given by local Rabis everywhere, and quite a few are (unfortunately) being given by reform \"Rabays\" that are in most cases not even aware of the various Denim required to stand by the claim that a certain food (and the process of making and packing it) is Kosher. </p>\n\n<p>Note also that if in most cases if Google does not even know the symbol is definitely isn't a good sign.</p>\n\n\n",

However, this is a sort of meekness that originates from the forces of evil (<em>kelipos</em>). It is opposite the ideal state, in which a person's heart is \"lifted up in the way of God\" (<em>Divrei HaYamim</em> 17:6).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Chiti</strong>, from the word <em>chet</em> - \"fear\" (חת). This causes a person to constantly fear that his repentance is not effective.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Emori</strong>, from the word <em>emor</em> - \"speak\". This force does not stop speaking to a person for a minute, trying to subtly entice him and trap him in various types of sin.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Prizi</strong>, from the word \"unwalled\" (as in \"unwalled cities\" - ערי הפרזות). This relates to the trait of watonness; that is, when a person does not seek to be bound to his Creator, but imagines that he do whatever he desires.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Chivi</strong>, from the Aramaic word for \"snake\" (חיוא). It schemes like the primordial Serpent, first trying to seduce a person to sin. Then it bites him repeatedly [with negative feelings of guilt and remorse].</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Yivusi</strong>, from the word \"to trample\" (as in <em>Tehillim</em> 60:14). It seeks to trample and annihilate a person from this world and the next.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Girgoshi</strong>, from the word <em>girushin</em> - \"divorce.\" It constantly floods a person's mind with foreign thoughts in order to break his connection to God and prayer. In addition, when a person is in the middle of doing a mitzvah, it suddenly wants to kill him, and applies various schemes and evil thoughts to prevent him from completing his deed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These are the forces of impurity that a person must be wary of.

In this\n  figurative sense, the verb yalad (to bear) is employed when it is said\n  of Adam, \"And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat\n  (va-yoled) a son in his own likeness, in his form\" (Gen. V. 3). As\n  regards the words, \"the form of Adam, and his likeness,\" we have\n  already stated (ch. i.) their meaning. Those sons of Adam who were\n  born before that time were not human in the true sense of the word,\n  they had not \"the form of man.\" With reference to Seth who had been\n  instructed, enlightened and brought to human perfection, it could\n  rightly be said, \"he (Adam) begat a son in his likeness, in his form.\"\n  It is acknowledged that a man who does not possess this \"form\" (the\n  nature of which has just been explained) is not human, but a mere\n  animal in human shape and form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he seems to be saying that people who aren't brought to perfection are really just animals, and he apparently includes Cain and Abel among these.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp046.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>1:36</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you think that there is an excuse for those who believe in the\n  corporeality of God on the ground of their training, their ignorance\n  or their defective comprehension, you must make the same concession to\n  the worshippers of idols: their worship is due to ignorance, or to\n  early training, \"they continue in the custom of their fathers.\" (TḄ.\n  Ḥullin, 13a) You will perhaps say that the literal interpretation of\n  the Bible causes men to fall into that doubt, but you must know that\n  idolaters were likewise brought to their belief by false imaginations\n  and ideas. There is no excuse whatever for those who, being unable to\n  think for themselves, do not accept [the doctrine of the\n  incorporeality of God] from the true philosophers. I do not consider\n  those men as infidels who are unable to prove the incorporeality, but\n  I hold those to be so Who do not believe it, especially when they see\n  that Onkelos and Jonathan avoid [in reference to God] expressions\n  implying corporeality as much as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he seems to say that one is guilty of heresy even if it was unintentional.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp052.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>1:42</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Mavet signifies \"death\" and \"severe illness,\" as in \"His heart died\n  (va-yamot) within him, and he became as a stone\" (1 Sam. xxv. 37),\n  that is, his illness was severe.

The peculiar\n  constitution of the organs, indispensable for the conservation of\n  their particular forms and for the performance of their primary\n  functions, produces, whilst it serves its special purpose, according\n  to the nature of the substance, other things, such as the hair and the\n  complexion of the body. Being mere accessories, they are not formed\n  according to a fixed rule: some are altogether absent in many\n  individuals; and vary considerably in others. This is not the case\n  with the organs of the body. You never find that the liver of one\n  person is ten times larger than that of another person, but you may\n  find a person without a beard, or without hair on certain parts of his\n  body, or with a beard ten times longer than that of another man.\n  Instances of this phenomenon, viz., great variation as regards hair\n  and colour, are not rare. The same differences occur in the\n  constitution of the Universe. Some species exist as an integral part\n  of the whole system: these are constant and follow a fixed law; though\n  they vary as far as their nature permits, this variation is\n  insignificant in quantity and quality. Other species do not serve any\n  purpose: they are the mere result of the general nature of transient\n  things, as, e.g., the various insects which are generated in\n  dunghills, the animals generated in rotten fruit, or in fetid liquids,\n  and worms generated in the intestines, etc. In short, everything\n  devoid of the power of generation belongs to this class. You will,\n  therefore, find that these things do not follow a fixed law, although\n  their entire absence is just as impossible as the absence of different\n  complexions and of different kinds of hair amongst human beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he rejects God's total involvement in the world, saying that there are many things that simply exist for no purpose.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp093.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:6</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These passages do not convey the idea that God spoke, thought,\n  reflected, or that He consulted and employed the opinion of other\n  beings, as ignorant persons have believed. How could the Creator be\n  assisted by those whom He created! They only show that all parts of\n  the Universe, even the limbs of animals in their actual form, are\n  produced through angels: for natural forces and angels are identical.\n  How bad and injurious is the blindness of ignorance! Say to a person\n  who is believed to belong to the wise men of Israel that the Almighty\n  sends His angel to enter the womb of a woman and to form there the\n  fœtus, he will be satisfied with the account; he will believe it, and\n  even find in it a description of the greatness of God's might and\n  wisdom; although he believes that the angel consists of burning fire,\n  and is as big as a third part of the Universe, yet he considers it\n  possible as a divine miracle. But tell him that God gave the seed a\n  formative power which produces and shapes the limbs, and that this\n  power is called \"angel,\" or that all forms are the result of the\n  influence of the Active Intellect, and that the latter is the angel,\n  the Prince of the world, frequently mentioned by our Sages, and he\n  will turn away; because he cannot comprehend the true greatness and\n  power of creating forces that act in a body without being perceived by\n  our senses. Our Sages have already stated--for him who has\n  understanding--that all forces that reside in a body are angels, much\n  more the forces that are active in the Universe. The theory that each\n  force acts only in one particular way, is expressed in Bereshit Rabba\n  (chap. 1.) as follows: \"One angel does not perform two things, and two\n  angels do not perform one thing\"; this is exactly the property of all\n  forces. We may find a confirmation of the opinion that the natural and\n  psychical forces of an individual are called angels in a statement of\n  our Sages which is frequently quoted, and occurs originally in\n  Bereshit Rabba (chap. lxxviii.): \"Every day God creates a legion of\n  angels; they sing before Him, and disappear.\" When, in opposition to\n  this statement, other statements were quoted to the effect that angels\n  are eternal--and, in fact, it has repeatedly been shown that they live\n  permanently--the reply has been given that some angels live\n  permanently, others perish; and this is really the case; for\n  individual forces are transient, whilst the genera are permanent and\n  imperishable. Again, we read (in Bereshit Rabba, chap. lxxxv.), in\n  reference to the relation between Judah and Tamar: \"R. Jochanan said\n  that Judah was about to pass by [without noticing Tamar], but God\n  caused the angel of lust, i.e., the libidinous disposition, to present\n  himself to him.\" Man's disposition is here called an angel. Likewise\n  we frequently meet with the phrase \"the angel set over a certain\n  thing.'' In Midrash-Koheleth (on Eccles. x. 7) the following passage\n  occurs: \"When man sleeps, his soul speaks to the angel, the angel to\n  the cherub.\" The intelligent reader will find here a clear statement\n  that man's imaginative faculty is also called \"angel,\" and that\n  \"cherub\" is used for man's intellectual faculty. How beautiful must\n  this appear to him who understands it; how absurd to the ignorant!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he rejects and ridicules a standard conception of angels.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp095.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:8</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must not find it strange that Aristotle differs here from the\n  opinion of our Sages. The theory of the music of the spheres is\n  connected with the theory of the motion of the stars in a fixed\n  sphere, and our Sages have, in this astronomical question, abandoned\n  their own theory in favour of the theory of others. Thus, it is\n  distinctly stated, \"The wise men of other nations have defeated the\n  wise men of Israel.\" It is quite right that our Sages have abandoned\n  their own theory: for speculative matters every one treats according\n  to the results of his own study, and every one accepts that which\n  appears to him established by proof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he asserts that the Sages were mistaken in scientific matters. In <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp150.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:14</a> he again mentions their scientific mistakes.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp098.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:11</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All we wish to point out is this: in the first place, that the whole\n  Creation is divided into three parts, viz. (1) the pure Intelligences;\n  (2) the bodies of the spheres endowed with permanent forms--(the forms\n  of these bodies do not pass from one substratum to another, nor do\n  their substrata undergo any change whatever); and (3) the transient\n  earthly beings, all of which consist of the same substance.\n  Furthermore, we desire to show that the ruling power emanates from the\n  Creator, and is received by the Intelligences according to their\n  order: from the Intelligences part of the good and the light bestowed\n  upon them is communicated to the spheres, and the latter, being in\n  possession of the abundance obtained of the Intelligences, transmit\n  forces and properties unto the beings of this transient world. We\n  must, however, add that the part which benefits the part below it in\n  the order described does not exist for the sole purpose of producing\n  that benefit. For if this were the case it would lead to the paradox\n  that the higher, better, and nobler beings existed for the sake of\n  beings lower in rank, whilst in reality the object should be of\n  greater importance than the means applied for attaining it. No\n  intelligent person will admit that this is possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he indicates that the celestial bodies are greater than man, and therefore it cannot be that everything was created for the sake of man. (He reiterates this in <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp148.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:12</a>.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp103.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:16</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>IN this chapter I will first expound my view on this question, and\n  then support it by argument-not by such arguments as those of the\n  Mutakallemim, who believe that they have proved the Creatio ex nihilo.\n  I will not deceive myself, and consider dialectical methods as proofs;\n  and the fact that a certain proposition has been proved by a\n  dialectical argument win never induce me to accept that proposition,\n  but, on the contrary, will weaken my faith in it, and cause me to\n  doubt it. For when we understand the fallacy of a proof, our faith in\n  the proposition itself is shaken. It is therefore better that a\n  proposition which cannot be demonstrated be received as an axiom, or\n  that one of the two opposite solutions of the problem be accepted on\n  authority. The methods by which the Mutakallemim proved the Creatio ex\n  nihilo have already been described by me, and I have exposed their\n  weak points. As to the proofs of Aristotle and his followers for the\n  Eternity of the Universe, they are, according to my opinion, not\n  conclusive; they are open to strong objections, as will be explained.\n  I intend to show that the theory of the Creation, as taught in\n  Scripture, contains nothing that is impossible; and that all those\n  philosophical arguments which seem to disprove our view contain weak\n  points which make them inconclusive, and render the attacks on our\n  view untenable. Since I am convinced of the correctness of my method,\n  and consider either of the two theories--viz., the Eternity of the\n  Universe, and the Creation--as admissible, I accept the latter on the\n  authority of Prophecy, which can teach things beyond the reach of\n  philosophical speculation. For the belief in prophecy is, as will be\n  shown in the course of this treatise, consistent even with the belief\n  in the Eternity of the Universe. When I have established the\n  admissibility of our theory, I will, by philosophical reasoning, show\n  that our theory of the Creation is more acceptable than that of the\n  Eternity of the Universe; and although our theory includes points open\n  to criticism, I will show that there are much stronger reasons for the\n  rejection of the theory of our opponents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he states that (contrary to several rishonim who claim to have done so) it is impossible to prove that the universe was created, and we have to accept it on faith.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp112.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:25</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WE do not reject the Eternity of the Universe, because certain\n  passages in Scripture confirm the Creation; for such passages are not\n  more numerous than those in which God is represented as a corporeal\n  being; nor is it impossible or difficult to find for them a suitable\n  interpretation. We might have explained them in the same manner as we\n  did in respect to the Incorporeality of God. We should perhaps have\n  had an easier task in showing that the Scriptural passages referred to\n  are in harmony with the theory of the Eternity of the Universe if we\n  accepted the latter, than we had in explaining the anthropomorphisms\n  in the Bible when we rejected the idea that God is corporeal. For two\n  reasons, however, we have not done so, and have not accepted the\n  Eternity of the Universe. First, the Incorporeality of God has been\n  demonstrated by proof: those passages in the Bible, which in their\n  literal sense contain statements that can be refuted by proof, must\n  and can be interpreted otherwise. But the Eternity of the Universe has\n  not been proved; a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not\n  sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical\n  text, and explaining it figuratively, when the opposite theory can be\n  supported by an equally good argument.</p>\n  \n  <p>Secondly, our belief in the Incorporeality of God is not contrary to\n  any of the fundamental principles of our religion: it is not contrary\n  to the words of any prophet. Only ignorant people believe that it is\n  contrary to the teaching of Scripture: but we have shown that this is\n  not the case: on the contrary, Scripture teaches the Incorporeality of\n  God. If we were to accept the Eternity of the Universe as taught by\n  Aristotle, that everything in the Universe is the result of fixed\n  laws, that Nature does not change, and that there is nothing\n  supernatural, we should necessarily be in opposition to the foundation\n  of our religion, we should disbelieve all miracles and signs, and\n  certainly reject all hopes and fears derived from Scripture, unless\n  the miracles are also explained figuratively. The Allegorists amongst\n  the Mohammedans have done this, and have thereby arrived at absurd\n  conclusions. If, however, we accepted the Eternity of the Universe in\n  accordance with the second of the theories which we have expounded\n  above (ch. xxiii.), and assumed, with Plato, that the heavens are\n  likewise transient, we should not be in opposition to the fundamental\n  principles of our religion; this theory would not imply the rejection\n  of miracles, but, on the contrary, would admit them as possible. The\n  Scriptural text might have been explained accordingly, and many\n  expressions might have been found in the Bible and in other writings\n  that would confirm and support this theory. But there is no necessity\n  for this expedient, so long as the theory has not been proved. As\n  there is no proof sufficient to convince us, this theory need not be\n  taken into consideration, nor the other one; we take the text of the\n  Bible literally, and say that it teaches us a truth which we cannot\n  prove; and the miracles are evidence for the correctness of our view.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he says that the text of the Torah itself does not even necessarily imply that the universe was created.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp116.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:29</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our opinion, in support of which we have quoted these passages, is\n  clearly established, namely, that no prophet or sage has ever\n  announced the destruction of the Universe, or a change of its present\n  condition, or a permanent change of any of its properties. When our\n  Sages say, \"The world remains six thousand years, and one thousand\n  years it will be waste,\" they do not mean a complete cessation of\n  existing things; the phrase \"one thousand years it will be waste\"\n  distinctly shows that time will continue: besides, this is the\n  individual opinion of one Rabbi, and in accordance with one particular\n  theory. But on the other hand the words, \"There is nothing new under\n  the sun\" (Eccles. i. 9), in the sense that no new creation takes place\n  in any way and under any circumstances, express the general opinion of\n  our Sages, and include a principle which every one of the doctors of\n  the Mishnah and the Talmud recognises and makes use of in his\n  arguments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he rejects the Talmudic belief that the world will come to an end after a certain amount of time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp116.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:29</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>First, the account given in Scripture of the Creation is not, as is\n  generally believed, intended to be in all its parts literal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he argues that the creation narrative in Genesis is not necessarily literally an accurate description of the creation of the universe.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp121.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:34</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here a principle is laid clown which I have constantly expounded,\n  viz., that all prophets except Moses receive the prophecy through an\n  angel.

We intend to discuss in this treatise the reasons of the commandments, and we shall then show, as far as necessary, the justice and wisdom of the Law, on account of which it is said: \"The Law of God is perfect, refreshing the heart\" (Ps. xix. 8).

If, therefore, the bed of Og was nine cubits in\n  length, he must, according to this proportion, have been six cubits\n  high, or a little more. The words, \"by the cubit of a man,\" mean, by\n  the measure of an ordinary man, and not by the measure of Og; for men\n  have the limbs in a certain proportion.

There is, however, a\n  difference of opinion among philosophers with reference to the\n  existence of any particular thing. Some of them consider its existence\n  to be impossible, and hold that God cannot produce the thing in\n  question, whilst others think that it is possible, and that God can\n  create it if He pleases to do so. E.g., all philosophers consider that\n  it is impossible for one substratum to have at the same moment two\n  opposite properties, or for the elementary components of a thing,\n  substance and accident, to interchange, so that the substance becomes\n  accident, and the accident becomes substance, or for a material\n  substance to be without accident.

It is distinctly stated in the\n  Law, that all is done in accordance with justice; and the words of our\n  Sages generally express the same idea. They clearly say: \"There is no\n  death without sin, no sufferings without transgression.\" (B. T.\n  Shabbath, 55a.) Again, \"The deserts of an are meted out to him in the\n  same measure which he himself employs.\" (Mish. Sotah, i. 7.) These are\n  the words of the Mishnah. Our Sages declare it wherever opportunity is\n  given, that the idea of God necessarily implies justice; that He will\n  reward the most pious for all their pure and upright actions, although\n  no direct commandment was given them through a prophet; and that He\n  will punish all the evil deeds of men, although they have not been\n  prohibited by a prophet, if common sense warns against them, as e.g.,\n  injustice and violence. Thus our Sages say: \"God does not deprive any\n  being of the full reward [of its good deed]\" (B. T. Pes. 118a) again,\n  \"He who says that God remits part of a punishment;, will be punished\n  severely; He is long-suffering, but is sure to exact payment.\" (B. T.\n  Baba K. 50a.) Another saying is this: \"He who has received a\n  commandment and acts accordingly is not like him who acts in the same\n  manner without being commanded to do so\" (B. T. Kidd. 31a); and it is\n  distinctly added that he who does a good thing without being\n  commanded, receives nevertheless his reward. The same principle is\n  expressed in all sayings of our Sages. But they contain an additional\n  doctrine which is not found in the Law; viz., the doctrine of\n  \"afflictions of love,\" as taught by some of our Sages. According to\n  this doctrine it is possible that a person be afflicted without having\n  previously committed any sin, in order that his future reward may be\n  increased; a view which is held by the Mu’tazilites, but is not\n  supported by any Scriptural text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he bases normative Jewish thought on a rejected Talmudic passage, and he rejects another unrejected Talmudic passage.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp153.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:17</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My opinion on this principle of Divine Providence I will now explain\n  to you. In the principle which I now proceed to expound I do not rely\n  on demonstrative proof, but on my conception of the spirit of the\n  Divine Law, and the writings of the Prophets. The principle which I\n  accept is far less open to objections, and is more reasonable than the\n  opinions mentioned before. It is this: In the lower or sublunary\n  portion of the Universe Divine Providence does not extend to the\n  individual members of species except in the case of mankind. It is\n  only in this species that the incidents in the existence of the\n  individual beings, their good and evil fortunes, are the result of\n  justice, in accordance with the words, \"For all His ways are\n  judgment.\" But I agree with Aristotle as regards all other living\n  beings, and à fortiori as regards plants and all the rest of earthly\n  creatures. For I do not believe that it is through the interference of\n  Divine Providence that a certain leaf drops [from a tree], nor do I\n  hold that when a certain spider catches a certain fly, that this is\n  the direct result of a special decree and will of God in that moment;\n  it is not by a particular Divine decree that the spittle of a certain\n  person moved, fell on a certain gnat in a certain place, and killed\n  it; nor is it by the direct will of God that a certain fish catches\n  and swallows a certain worm on the surface of the water. In all these\n  cases the action is, according to my opinion, entirely due to chance,\n  as taught by Aristotle. Divine Providence is connected with Divine\n  intellectual influence, and the same beings which are benefited by the\n  latter so as to become intellectual, and to comprehend things\n  comprehensible to rational beings, are also under the control of\n  Divine Providence, which examines all their deeds in order to reward\n  or punish them. It may be by mere chance that a ship goes down with\n  all her contents, as in the above-mentioned instance, or the roof of a\n  house falls upon those within; but it is not due to chance, according\n  to our view, that in the one instance the men went into the ship, or\n  remained in the house in the other instance: it is due to the will of\n  God, and is in accordance with the justice of His judgments, the\n  method of which our mind is incapable of understanding.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he argues that much of the world is not governed by divine providence.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp154.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>3:18</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The relation of Divine Providence is therefore not the same to all\n  men; the greater the human perfection a person has attained, the\n  greater the benefit he derives from Divine Providence. This benefit is\n  very great in the case of prophets, and varies according to the degree\n  of their prophetic faculty: as it varies in the case of pious and good\n  men according to their piety and uprightness. For it is the intensity\n  of the Divine intellectual influence that has inspired the prophets,\n  guided the good in their actions, and perfected the wisdom of the\n  pious. In the same proportion as ignorant and disobedient persons are\n  deficient in that Divine influence, their condition is inferior, and\n  their rank equal to that of irrational beings: and they are \"like unto\n  the beasts\" (Ps. xlix. 21). For this reason it was not only considered\n  a light thing to slay them, but it was even directly commanded for the\n  benefit of mankind. This belief that God provides for every individual\n  human being in accordance with his merits is one of the fundamental\n  principles on which the Law is founded.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he says that even for man Divine providence is limited, and he states that the ignorant are little more than animals and their lives are not very valuable.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp158.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:22</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I believe that I have fully explained the idea contained in the\n  account of Job; but I will now show the character of the opinion\n  attributed to Job, and of the opinions attributed to his friends, and\n  support my statement by proofs gathered from the words of each of\n  them. We need not take notice of the remaining passages which are only\n  required for the context, as has been explained to you in the\n  beginning of this treatise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he states that large swaths of Scripture have no inherent meaning/value/purpose, and simply exist to provide context for the important parts.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp162.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:26</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I will now tell you what intelligent persons ought to believe in this\n  respect; namely, that each commandment has necessarily a cause, as far\n  as its general character is concerned, and serves a certain object;\n  but as regards its details we hold that it has no ulterior object.\n  Thus killing animals for the purpose of obtaining good food is\n  certainly useful, as we intend to show (below, ch. xlviii.); that,\n  however, the killing should not be performed by neḥirah (poleaxing the\n  animal), but by sheḥitah (cutting the neck), and by dividing the\n  œsophagus and the windpipe in a certain place; these regulations and\n  the like are nothing but tests for man's obedience. In this sense you\n  will understand the example quoted by our Sages [that there is no\n  difference] between killing the animal by cutting its neck in front\n  and cutting it in the back. I give this instance only because it has\n  been mentioned by our Sages; but in reality [there is some reason for\n  these regulations]. For as it has become necessary to eat the flesh of\n  animals, it was intended by the above regulations to ensure an easy\n  death and to effect it by suitable means; whilst decapitation requires\n  a sword or a similar instrument, the sheḥitah can be performed with\n  any instrument; and in order to ensure an easy death our Sages\n  insisted that the knife should be well sharpened.</p>\n  \n  <p>A more suitable instance can be cited from the detailed commandments\n  concerning sacrifices. The law that sacrifices should be brought is\n  evidently of great use, as will be shown by us (infra, chap. xlvi.);\n  but we cannot say why one offering should be a lamb, whilst another is\n  a ram; and why a fixed number of them should be brought. Those who\n  trouble themselves to find a cause for any of these detailed rules,\n  are in my eyes void of sense: they do not remove any difficulties, but\n  rather increase them. Those who believe that these detailed rules\n  originate in a certain cause, are as far from the truth as those who\n  assume that the whole law is useless. You must know that Divine Wisdom\n  demanded it--or, if you prefer, say that circumstances made it\n  necessary--that there should be parts [of His work] which have no\n  certain object: and as regards the Law, it appears to be impossible\n  that it should not include some matter of this kind. That it cannot be\n  avoided may be seen from the following instance. You ask why must a\n  lamb be sacrificed and not a ram? but the same question would be\n  asked, why a ram had been commanded instead of a lamb, so long as one\n  particular kind is required. The same is to be said as to the question\n  why were seven lambs sacrificed and not eight; the same question might\n  have been asked if there were eight, ten, or twenty lambs, so long as\n  some definite number of lambs were sacrificed. It is almost similar to\n  the nature of a thing which can receive different forms, but actually\n  receives one of them. We must not ask why it has this form and not\n  another which is likewise possible, because we should have to ask the\n  same question if instead of its actual form the thing had any of the\n  other possible forms. Note this, and understand it. The repeated\n  assertion of our Sages that there are reasons for all commandments,\n  and the tradition that Solomon knew them, refer to the general purpose\n  of the commandments, and not to the object of every detail.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this quote he asserts that the details of mitzvos have no reasons/purpose.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp168.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:32</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But the custom which was in those days general among all men, and the\n  general mode of worship in which the Israelites were brought up,\n  consisted in sacrificing animals in those temples which contained\n  certain images, to bow down to those images, and to bum incense before\n  them; religious and ascetic persons were in those days the persons\n  that were devoted to the service in the temples erected to the stars,\n  as has been explained by us. It was in accordance with the wisdom and\n  plan of God, as displayed in the whole Creation, that He did not\n  command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of service;\n  for to obey such a commandment it would have been contrary to the\n  nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used; it\n  would in those days have made the same impression as a prophet would\n  make at present if he called us to the service of God and told us in\n  His name, that we should not pray to Him, not fast, not seek His help\n  in time of trouble; that we should serve Him in thought, and not by\n  any action. For this reason God allowed these kinds of service to\n  continue; He transferred to His service that which had formerly served\n  as a worship of created beings, and of things imaginary and unreal,\n  and commanded us to serve Him in the same manner; viz., to build unto\n  Him a temple; comp. \"And they shall make unto me a sanctuary\" (Exod.\n  xxv. 8); to have the altar erected to His name; comp. \"An altar of\n  earth thou shalt make unto me\" (ibid. xx. 21); to offer the sacrifices\n  to Him; comp. \"If any man of you bring an offering unto the Lord\"\n  (Lev. i. 2), to bow down to Him and to bum incense before Him. He has\n  forbidden to do any of these things to any other being; comp. \"He who\n  sacrificeth unto any God, save the Lord only, he shall be utterly\n  destroyed\" (Exod. xxii. 19); \"For thou shalt bow down to no other God\"\n  (ibid. xxxiv. 14). He selected priests for the service in the temple;\n  comp. \"And they shall minister unto me in the priest's office\" (ibid.\n  xxviii. 41). He made it obligatory that certain gifts, called the\n  gifts of the Levites and the priests, should be assigned to them for\n  their maintenance while they are engaged in the service of the temple\n  and its sacrifices. By this Divine plan it was effected that the\n  traces of idolatry were blotted out, and the truly great principle of\n  our faith, the Existence and Unity of God, was firmly established;\n  this result was thus obtained without deterring or confusing the minds\n  of the people by the abolition of the service to which they were\n  accustomed and which alone was familiar to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he claims that sacrifices (which form a large portion of the Torah) are just a necessary evil, catering to the unsophisticated level of understanding God that the ancients had.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp181.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:45</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The commandment that the stones of the altar shall not be hewn and\n  that no iron tool shall be lifted up upon them (Deut. xxvii. 5), has\n  been explained by our Sages as follows: It is not right that the tool\n  that shortens man's life should be lifted up upon that which gives\n  length of life. As an Agadic explanation this is good: but the real\n  reason is this: the heathen used to build their altars with hewn\n  stones: we ought not to imitate them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he asserts that the Sages' explanation for the mitzvah is not the real explanation.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp184.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>3:48</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When in the Talmud (Ber. p. 33b) those are blamed who use in their\n  prayer the phrase, \"Thy mercy extendeth to young birds,\" it is the\n  expression of the one of the two opinions mentioned by us, namely,\n  that the precepts of the Law have no other reason but the Divine will.\n  We follow the other opinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he argues that a Talmudic law is based on a fundamentally incorrect philosophical notion.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp187.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:51</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Those who arrive at the palace, but go round about it, are those who\n  devote themselves exclusively to the study of the practical law; they\n  believe traditionally in true principles of faith, and learn the\n  practical worship of God, but are not trained in philosophical\n  treatment of the principles of the Law, and do not endeavour to\n  establish the truth of their faith by proof.

While he permits regular butter from a gentile for consumption he nevertheless prohibits butter which was mixed with whey (see the reasons given there).

I heard this from him during last week's <em>Seudah Shlishit</em>, after the herring:</p>\n\n<p>There are two sins that B'nai Yisra'el did where G-d proposes to destroy all the people and make Moshe into a great nation - The Golden Calf and the Spy Mission. In both occasions, Moshe turns down the offer and appeals to G-d in similar fashion in both. His initial argument in both is \"What will Egypt (or the other nations) think?\"</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of the Golden Calf, he invokes the merit of Avraham, Yitzhak and Ya'akov as part of his appeal. We do not see the forefathers' merit used in the Spy incident?</p>\n\n<p>Why did Moshe not make any mention of this in the spy incident?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ramba\"n on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14084&st=&pgnum=176\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bemidbar 14:17</a> (the link points to the continuation page, where the part I shall summarize is) notices that when Moishe uses the 13 <em>middot</em> formulary, he omits נוצר חסד לאלפים (\"passes kindness to a thousand generations\") as an allusion to the forefathers' merit.</p>\n\n<p>The reason Moshe omits this is that the land was promised to the forefathers and <em>B'nai Yisra'el</em> was supposed to inherit the land from them. However, by rebelling against the land, essentially, they are also rebelling against the forefathers because they are refusing the very gift that the forefathers chose. </p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in the Golden Calf incident, Moses says, \"And this land you said to them, 'I will give to your seed and they will inherit it, forever.\" In the spy incident, how could Moses say this phrase, truthfully, when it was clear that B'nai Yisra'el implied \"We cannot accept this gift\"?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>My analysis</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><em>Zechut Avot</em> is frequently a powerful defense against G-d's punishment. View how often this idea is invoked in Tanac\"h, and it is a point frequently stated in <em>Tachanun</em> and <em>Selichot</em>. <em>B'nai Yisra'el</em> doubted G-d's abilities with other issues, while they were in the desert. However, by specifically doubting G-d's bringing them to the land, they lost the power of <em>Zechut Avot</em>. Even if <em>teshuva</em> would have worked, (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/17111/5275\">this question</a>.) they couldn't have invoked <em>zechut avot</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

Shraga Feivish Schneebalg has a responsum about this precise question, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22684&st=&pgnum=48\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Shraga Hameir 8:23</a>.</p>\n\n<p>He begins by noting that he had this question for many years, but because it was not relevant to him (as he was a man) and no one had ever asked him for a ruling he never recorded his view. Now, since someone asked him, he wrote a responsum about it.</p>\n\n<p>At first he discusses the nature of \"amen\" and how it means different things for different types of berachos, and that therefore it is very important to know which beracha you are saying amen to so that you can have the correct meaning in mind.</p>\n\n<p>He explains that the beracha of \"shelo asani isha\" is a praise to God for creating the person as a man with full mitzvah obligation rather than a woman with only partial mitzvah obligation (women are exempt from time-bound-positive-commandments). The meaning of \"amen\" for this type of beracha is that the praise is true and fitting. Since even a woman knows that a man has the advantage of all the mitzvos she can say amen to his beracha, affirming that the praise is true and fitting.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the relevant paragraph:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כאת נחזור לשאלתינו הברכה של שלא עשני אשה שהוא שבח יקר וגדולה לאל מלך\n  יוצר כל יתברך שברא לו איש שחייב בכל המצות ולא אשה שפטורה ממצות עשה\n  שהזמן גרמה ומלימוד תורה הקדושה אז העונה אמן אחר ברכה זו צריך לכון אמת\n  היא הברכה והשבח המברך ואני מודה ומאמין שהשבחים לו יאים ונאים וגם אשה\n  יודע שיש שבח לאיש שמקיים כל התרי\"ג מצות היינו גם המצות עשה שהזמן גרמה\n  וגם לימוד התורה הקדושה ומשבח לבורא יתברך שמו שנברא לאיש וע\"כ יש אפשרית\n  גם לאשה לענות אמן ולכוון כוונה זו שמודה ומאמינה שהשבחים לו יתברך הם\n  יאים ונאים לשבח להשי\"ת בשבח זה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Some 80 years earlier, R. Menachem Nosson Nota Auerbach had already ruled this way as well, in Orach Ne'eman 124:18. He cited a ruling against women saying amen (or a man saying the beracha in public) because it is embarrassing to women, but said that according to his explanation that \"shelo asani isha\" refers not to being created as a man but to the fact that the man wasn't changed into a woman, it is not embarrassing to women and they would therefore be obligated to affirm the truth of the beracha by saying \"amen\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולפי\"ז אינו מוכרח לחדושי המח' מאורי אור (בח' באר שבע סי' מו') דמחדש\n  שאשה אינה עונה אמן על ברכת שלא עשני אשה וגם דאין לברך ברכה זו ברבים\n  משום דהוא בכלל הלבנת פניהם ברבים דלפמש\"כ הברכה אינו על עיקר בריאתו אלא\n  על שלא נשתנה מבריאתו הקודמת ואין בזה הלבנת פניהם וחייבת גם היא לאמת\n  הברכה ששומעת מהמברך וז\"פ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Aren’t they each necessary to teach a novel ruling? As it is taught in a baraita: Rabbi Elazar says: If it is stated: “Tabernacle,” why does it state: “Temple”? And if it is stated: “Temple,” why does it state: “Tabernacle”? He explains: Had the verse stated only: “Tabernacle,” and not stated: “Temple,” I would have said that one is liable for entering the Tabernacle in a state of impurity, since it was anointed with the anointing oil, and therefore it carries greater sanctity, but he is not liable for entering the Temple, which was not anointed with the anointing oil. And had the verse stated only: “Temple,” and not stated: “Tabernacle,” I would have said that one is liable for entering the Temple in a state of impurity, since its sanctity is an eternal sanctity, but he is not liable for entering the Tabernacle, whose sanctity was only for its time. For this reason, it is stated: “Tabernacle,” and for this reason, it is stated: “Temple.”</p>\n<p>The Gemara answers: Rabbi Elazar did not base his derivation on a superfluous verse, but on the change in wording between the two verses. This is what is difficult for him: Since the Tabernacle is also called Temple and the Temple is also called Tabernacle, then let the verse write either in both verses: Temple, or in both verses: Tabernacle; why do I need both “Tabernacle” and “Temple”? Conclude two conclusions from it, i.e., that one is liable even for impurity contracted inside the grounds, and that the halakha applies both in the Tabernacle and in the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

See the editor's note, as he has a valid point. I'm not suggesting that Rambam's evaluation would fit with today's common halachic practices. But, it offers one opnion in answer to your question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yesodei HaTorah 3:8</p>\n<p>Among the stars that we can see, there are small ones (which were\nbelieved to be smaller than the Earth) and large ones that are much\nlarger than the Earth. The Earth is about 40 times the size of the\nmoon; the sun is about 170 times the size of the Earth. Therefore, the\nsun is about 6,800 times the size of the moon. None of the other stars\nis as large as the sun, nor as small as the planet Mercury.</p>\n<p>Editor’s note: I am not able to explain the Rambam’s astronomy. In\nHilchos Kiddush HaChodesh (17:24), he says that it is based on the\nscience of Greek astronomers. In Moreh Nevuchim, he is willing to\ndisregard Talmudic dicta (3:14) and even Biblical verses (2:25) in\nfavor of observable science when necessary. Readers are free to assume\neither that the Rambam was sharing the best science of his day, or\nthat he is describing spiritual rather than physical phenomena.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a debate on how one calculates this in terms of time. From <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:2z8BjUxGGSEJ:https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/%3Fid%3D5534%20&cd=10&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>great Rabbis of the previous generations (especially Rav Tukachinkski\nzt\"l) calculated that these three stars (and the absence of red in the\nwestern sky) occurs 32 minutes after sunset in winter, and up to 38\nminutes in summer. This is when the sun is 8 degrees below the\nhorizon. This calculation of 8 degrees below the horizon is used in\nmany (most?) countries - and comes out to 50-60 minutes in Europe and\nAmerica. It gets longer as one goes north.</p>\n<p>There are other opinions - such as the Chazon Ish who fixed it at\n45-50 minutes after sunset. Or those who act according to Rabbenu Tam,\nwho wait 72 minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My analysis of the above - The mentioning of red in the sky is the only visible phenomenon mentioned among the various opinions. Thus, Venus tends to be the first star that is visible and you will see it while there is still a good amount of light on the horizon. That would classify as a \"big\" star. So, at the least, you'd have to wait until all the \"red\" is gone - most likely, you'd be waiting a bit longer.</p>\n\n\n",

And he did not want to publicize that she had begun to\n  menstruate, therefore he did not want to pour it [the wine] into\n  another cup (saving his own cup from becoming <em>tamei</em>), and send it to\n  her:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Question: Even if the suggestion of the Sifsei Chachamim of pouring the wine into another cup would have solved the issue concerning the wine and cup becoming <em>tamei</em>, Avraham should also have been concerned about the Rabbinical prohibition of a husband sending his wife wine while she is a <em>nidah</em>? And this could have been the reason why he did not use the idea suggested by the <em>Sifsei Chachamim</em>  to pour it [the wine] into  another cup and send it to Sarah, because pouring into another cup especially for her <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.195.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">is prohibited</a> when she is a nidah.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93030/did-avraham-avinu-keep-the-rabbinical-harchakos-in-the-laws-of-nidda\">My question here</a> asking whether Avraham kept harchakos of niddah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A few explanations are possible (presuming that Avraham/the Avot kept even rabbinic laws):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>It is permissible to send the cup when other participants of the meal are tasting from the cup and it is not designated only for the menstruant.</li>\n<li>Being that the meal was in honor of the guests (angels), and the <em>halacha</em> is that the most distinguished of the party leads the grace (Ber. 46a), the cup was being sent by an angel and not by Avraham, in which case it would also be permitted as it wasn't being sent by Sarah's husband. </li>\n<li>The angels did not intend for the cup to be sent at this meal, rather hinting that when Sarah would become clean the cup should be sent to her so that she merit being fertile by drinking from the <em>kos shel berachah</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>(Source: R. Ovadiah Yosef, Taharat HaBayit vol. 2 191ff.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Even if we assume that Avraham kept the harchakos of niddah, it could have been permissible to send her the cup. </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5538\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 195:13</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשם שאסורה למזוג לו כך הוא אסור למזוג לה ולא עוד אלא אפילו לשלוח לה\n  כוס של יין אסור לא שנא כוס של ברכה לא שנא כוס אחר אם הוא מיוחד לה\n  <strong>אבל אם שותים הם מאותו הכוס ושתית איהי אבתרייהו לית לן בה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Just as it is forbidden for her to pour him, so it is forbidden for\n  him to pour her. Not only that, even to send her a cup of wine is\n  forbidden, whether it is a cup of blessing or another cup, if it is\n  specifically for her. <strong>But if they drink from that cup and she drinks\n  after them, there is no problem.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yehoshua Falk</a> explains, this is even if the only person to drink from the cup is the husband:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Perisha Y.D. 195:11</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא שנא כוס אחר אם הוא מיוחד לה. פירוש לאפוקי היכא דקא שתה איהו ההוא\n  כסא ושתיא איהי בתריה לית לן בה רשב\"א ומשמע שם דהוא הדין דמותרת לשתות\n  ג\"כ מיד אחר בעלה ואפילו אין לו בני בית שישתו ג\"כ מאותו כוס ולא אסור\n  אלא אם כן מייחד לה כוס דאז נותן דעתו עליה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, had Avraham wanted to send Sarah the cup it would have beeen simple to do it in a permissible way. Therefore, the Sifsei Chachamim comes up with another reason why he did not want to send her the cup, namely, that it would advertise that she had become a niddah.</p>\n\n\n",

Aaron's excellent answer addresses the mechanics of what <em>is</em> a mikvah; I'll walk through when one needs to use one.</p>\n\n<p>There are plenty of times the Torah talks explicitly about a requirement for someone to immerse in water; have a look at <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. Chapter 15</a> for example. Our tradition has it that this means a mikvah. In fact the term mikvah is spelled out explicitly as such in <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=11#C2265\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. 11:36</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So a Mikvah for Niddah is a Torah law. That's why a Jewish community needs a Mikvah immediately -- without one, married couples can't be together. This is the #1 reason for a mikvah. (In the 1940s there was a Senator Taft from Ohio who received a document from a Jewish community listing many reasons why a mikvah is so important; he looked it over and immediately realized -- correctly -- that the paramount one is so there can be family life.)</p>\n\n<p>Mikvah for conversion is also a Torah law. (This one is derived from the Sinai experience, effectively a mass conversion, where it says they had to wash themselves.) But unlike Niddah, there's not the same burning need for every community to be able to do conversions any day of the year.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that -- in Temple times, people had to be ritually pure if they wanted to enter the Temple or eat a sacrifice in Jerusalem, so <em>if</em> you wanted to do that (and you needed to for Passover), you'd have to find a mikvah. </p>\n\n<p><em>Today</em>, many men have the very nice practice of dipping in a mikvah on a daily, weekly, or pre-holiday basis; this is certainly not of Biblical force and is ... well a custom with some rabbinic-law underpinnings, let's put it that way. (To oversimplify: At one point there was a rabbinic policy that the same way men had to immerse in a mikvah to eat sacrifices, they should immerse to study Torah every day.)</p>\n\n<p>It is really, really important not to confuse the vital needs of the mikvah with the nice-to-haves. Rabbis Samson Raphael Hirsch and Moshe Feinstein both wrote that if men using the mikvah causes it to be less clean, which results in one married woman not using it -- or even makes it difficult for the women -- then get your priorities straight -- throw the men out of there! It would then be meritorious -- but not obligatory -- for the community to build a separate men's mikvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, it's a Torah law to immerse in water. One only needs enough water to submerge their whole body, and the water can be collected from any source. </p>\n\n<p>Mishneh Torah Laws of Mikwa'ot Chapter 3</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>According to Scriptural Law, it is permissible to immerse in any collected body of water, as implied by Leviticus 11:36: \"a gathering\n  of water,\" i.e., any gathering, provided it contains enough water for\n  the entire body of a human being to immerse in it at one time. Our\n  Sages measured this figure as a cubit by a cubit by a height of three\n  cubits. This measure contains 40 se'ah of water. According to\n  Scriptural Law, the water is acceptable whether drawn or not.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>א דין תורה שכל מים מכונסין טובלין בהן שנאמר מקוה מים מ\"מ והוא שיהיה\n  בהן כדי להעלות בהן כדי טבילה לכל גוף האדם בבת אחת שיערו חכמים אמה על\n  אמה ברום שלש אמות ושיעור זה הוא מחזיק מ' סאה מים בין שאובין בין שאינן\n  שאובין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However an actual \"mikweh\" with it's requirements on the type of water used and the amount of water is Rabbinic in origin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>According to Rabbinic Law, water that is drawn is invalid for immersion.

    "title": "Why did Shabbos exist when there was no electricity? Isn't Shabbos all about not doing מלאכה which is basically electronics?",
    "content": "# Why did Shabbos exist when there was no electricity? Isn't Shabbos all about not doing מלאכה which is basically electronics?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Please Note: This is not the same question as \"what is considered work on Shabbos\" because I'm just looking for why we had Shabbos before electricity. And for the person who wrote \"your understanding of the 39 Melachosmare very untrue\" that may be right because I definitely don't know all of them but during Shabbos basically all (I said basically) of the Melachos still have a connection to electricity. Also, the rule that you can't do electricity on Shabbos was made before electricity was found so why is that if they didn't even have electricity then?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>We live in an eletronically-heavy world, so growing up, little kids have to learn \"don't turn on lights on Shabbos\" before they learn \"don't use flint and tinder (or rubbing sticks) to make fire on Shabbos.\" I think that's what's driving your question.</p>\n\n<p>In a pre-industrial world, plowing, planting, harvesting, threshing, winnowing, weaving, making charcoal and the like were absolutely part of daily life for everyone. Stopping all of those on Shabbos was a major change. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't think it's a well-phrased question exactly b/c of what @ezra mentioned. But, it is a good question wondering \"what's behind a melacha?\" The concept of <em>melacha</em> is an extremely difficult concept for even devoutly religious Jews to comprehend. The <em>melachot</em> were based on activity done for the <em>mishkan</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, most sources that I've seen translate melacha as \"work\". Thus, many people equate \"work\" with \"effort\" or \"labor\". So Jews and, moreso, Gentiles are absolutely puzzled as to why one may run around an athletic field (strenuous exercise is prohibited according to many for a separate reason that is not related to <em>melacha</em>) on Shabbat as that seems like \"work\" whereas one may not turn on or off a light that involves minimal effort.</p>\n\n<p>So, <em>melacha</em> has nothing to do with electronics directly. Many of the  Shabbat laws, I find, I do even if I don't understand them. I implicitly trust a rabbi's opinion, unless it's clearly obvious to me that he's wrong. (E.g. if a rav told me a product was kosher and I discover that it is not, of course I won't eat it.) The point is that I don't feel that I need to understand why I do things. It's nice if I can, of course. If you want to understand exactly what is a melacha and what isn't and why they became that way, there are many resources to help you or confuse you :-)</p>\n\n\n",

But I don’t understand Tosfos, for I can put up a tent inside my Sukkah (as long as there isn't a there isn't a one tefach wide flat area - Sukkah 10a), and I can eat and sleep inside the tent and also abrogate the reason it’s a \"bad sign.”</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>it must be that the scach of a sukkah can't be rain proof because if it was then when the rabbanim say that rain on sukkos is a bad sign wouldn't be true because we could just put up rain proof scach.

Presumably, Tosfos understands that if the Succah <strong>itself</strong> is what is judged in the criteria of being exempted, and holds one which will never come to exemption is not a kosher Succah.</p>\n\n<p>Another, slightly different possibility is that Tosfas holds that everything is taken into account for the exemption, but holds that it's still a bad sign if you're only there because of a reason external to the Succah, whilst if the reason you're okay is because of the Succah itself it cannot be seen as a 'rejection' of the Succah. To riff of the example of Chazal, the first case is like wearing a waterproof face covering, the second is like the master not throwing the cup of water you just fetched in your face at all.</p>\n\n\n",

There we see that when Amram divorced Yocheved she had these two sons from Elitzaphan ben Parnech. In Bamidbar 34 25 we find him listed as the Nasi of Zevulin.</p>\n\n<p>And then there is the Daas Zikeinim mentioned by the OP found in Bamidbar 11 27. There we find the idea that Amram fathered them after Har Sinai when he and Yocheved heard they couldn't be married since she was his aunt, and he went and married a different women. </p>\n\n<p>That would of course put them in the tribe of Levi.</p>\n\n<p>(Interestingly, a source mentioned in the D.Z. calls them paternal half brothers of Aharon, and doesn't mention Moshe.)</p>\n\n<p>The D.Z. also quotes the idea previously mentioned from Bamidbar Rabba. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This link explains a lot and brings the sources from the answer above as well, but it also adds a footnote to Igrot Kodesh Vol 15 letter 5537, where the Lubavitcher Rebbe answers when Amram might have separated from Yocheved and fathered Eldad and Medad, according to the tradition brought by the Daas Zekainim. Basically, it seems like he answers that Amram may have become aware prophetically of the future issur of arrayos and separated from Yocheved again, at some point after Moshe was born (perhaps learning about it through Moshe.)\n<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/4407977/jewish/Eldad-Medad-The-Mysterious-Prophets.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/4407977/jewish/Eldad-Medad-The-Mysterious-Prophets.htm</a>\nIgrot Hakodesh Vol. 15 linked here: <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15912&st=&pgnum=236\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15912&st=&pgnum=236</a></p>\n\n\n",

(One who is stringent in this will be blessed.</p>\n\n<p>The sefer <em>Shailos Uteshuvos Beis Ephraim</em> says that this may be the reason why (outside of Israel) Birkhat Kohanim is not recited daily.

The principle of <em>yeherag ve al yaavor</em> is derived not based on severity of the <em>aveira</em> involved but rather based on a logic of \"how do you know that your blood is more valuable than that of the other.\" (see Sanhedrin 74a)</p>\n\n<p>And, while you point out that based on the severity of the punishment meted out it would appear that <em>chilul Shabbos</em> is the more sever <em>aveira</em>, Double AA astutely pointed out that the Gemara in Yoma (85a) advances a <em>kal ve chomer</em> argument based on the assumption that murder is a more severe <em>aveira</em> than <em>chilul Shabbos</em> because the spilling of blood contaminates the land and drives away the <em>Shechina</em> (R'L). What emerges from this is that <em>chilul Shabbos</em> has an aspect which is more severe (being punishable by stoning) and murder has an aspect which is more severe (contaminating the land and driving away the <em>Shechina</em>). One is not more sever than the other, they both have aspects of severity over the other in different areas.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that although some will argue that gauging the severity of <em>aveirot</em> is a bad thing, I would argue that this evaluation and weighing will aid us in appreciating the gravity of <em>aveirot</em> and therefore in doing <em>Teshuva</em> and preventing us from being <em>over aveirot</em>.

It would seem from this that if he has other intentions he is forbidden to relate the lashon hara even for the purpose of saving someone from getting hurt.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Hilchos Issurei Rechilus</em> (9:2), the Chofetz Chaim also lists this condition, regarding <em>rechilus letoeles</em>, but in the <em>Be'er Mayim Chaim</em> he writes that even if one has other (non-toeles) intentions, he must still relate the <em>rechilus</em>. because of the mitzvah of <em>Lo sa'amod al dam re'acha</em>, (not standing by to save someone), but he should try as hard as possible to relate it for the positive <em>toeles</em> purpose.</p>\n\n<p>Does this apply only to <em>recilus</em>? If yes why? What's the difference? If it applies to lashon hara too, why does the Chafetz chaim say it only in <em>hilchos rechilus</em>, and not by <em>lashon hara</em>??</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ask your LOR but  it  seems  to me that the Halacha  applies equally.

The only remaining  recourse is taking him to Beis  Din to try to get repaid for damages.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Rechilus the CC is discussing knowledge of <em>future</em> damage that will be caused to someone by doing something as serious as partnering with someone else .In such a case it would  be a violation of \" Lo sa'amod al dam re'acha not to speak up. </p>\n\n<p>A person with knowledge of future harm usually  has more of an obligation to speak up than someone who has knowledge of past harm because there is a much more clear Toelis in  doing so (an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of  cure) Therefore by Rechilus the CC stresses that just because you hate someone  you aren't absolved from <em>Lo sa'amod al dam re'acha</em> You  should force yourself to not only speak  out of hate. Conversely  by  Loshon  Hora  there may be toelis in knowing who the thief was to try to get the item  back    but not always will it be so  important as to fall into the category of  <em>Lo sa'amod al dam re'acha</em></p>\n\n<p>In  both cases the main criteria of having to force yourself to speak up but not only out of hate is the question of  does this situation fall into <em>Lo sa'amod al dam re'acha</em></p>\n\n\n",

There is no source for claiming the the chabad nusach is the only valid one and in fact in the introduction to the Tehilas Hashem siddur there is an explanation of why there are multiple nusachos. In conclusion there is nothing about what this person did which is chabad policy.</p>\n\n\n",

It is often called <em>makom kavu'ah</em>. (I'll abbreviate it as M.K.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויקבע מקום לתפלתו שלא ישנהו אם לא לצורך גדול (ס\"א לצורך מצוה) דאמר רב הונא כל הקובע מקום לתפלתו אלהי אברהם בעזרו ואין די לו במה שיקבע לו ב\"ה להתפלל בה תדיר אלא <strong>גם בב\"ה שקובע בה צריך שיהיה מקומו קבוע</strong> וידוע ולא ישב היום כאן ולמחר במקום אחר דהכי אתמר בירושלמי א\"ר תנחום בר חייא צריך אדם לייחד לו מקום בב\"ה שנאמר ויהי דוד בא עד הראש אשר ישתחוה שם השתחו' לא נאמר אלא ישתחו' משמע שהיה תדיר משתחוה שם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there a fixed amount of time to establish a place as a M.K.? How long / often is this? And, does this amount of time need to be contiguous? Can one lose his <em>kevi'ut</em> if he is not there for a while? If so, how long?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related:</strong> Some shuls sell the seats, such as for High Holidays. I assume, then that the M.K. status lasts for the duration of the holidays, only. But, let's say seats are sold for the entire year, and that payment is due by a specific date. If a person is late paying but still intends to keep his seat, has he lost his M.K. by not paying, or is his intent to pay still valid, and for how long?</p>\n\n<p>Actual occurrence:</p>\n\n<p>My shul has a \"chapel\" which is used for \"daily\" davening, and a larger shul used only on Shabbat and Yom Tov. I've been attending the shul upstairs weekly for many years. After about a year of deveining in the same spot, one week someone asks me to vacate my seat because he claims that it is <strong>his</strong> M.K. Apparently, he <strong>used</strong> to daven there years ago, went to another shul, and decided to return. If someone is gone for a long time, doesn't he lose that spot?</p>\n\n\n",

Bimei</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורש\"י היה נוהג איסור להושיט מפתח מידו לידה בימי נדותה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The term \"נוהג איסור\" is not the most precise of halachic categories. I would render it something to the effect of \"he treated it like it was forbidden\", implying that Rashi did not claim that it was outright prohibited but his minhag was to refrain from it. </p>\n\n<p>Tosafot suggests basis for Rashi's practice from a parallel version of the Talmudic story (i.e. the story here which Tosafot is commenting on) found in the Midrash. In that version<sup>1</sup> Eliyahu asks the woman:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמא הבאת לו את השמן שמא הבאת לו את הפך</p>\n  \n  <p>Perhaps you brought him the oil, perhaps you brought him the jug?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would apparently indicate that a niddah should not be bringing her husband the oil or the jug, i.e. she cannot pass things to him. However, Tosafos points out that the Midrash immediately continues with: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונגע ביך באצבע הקטנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would indicate that the only issue with passing something is if they actually touch, in which case there would be no support for Rashi's practice.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Asher\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Yosef Karo</a> in his commentary there quotes rishonim that agree that one should be concerned for this, as well as rishonim that think that there is no such concern. The concern appears to be that when passing something, they might end up touching:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ\"ש ולא יושיט מידו לידה שום דבר ולא יקבלנו מידה בפ\"ק דשבת ובפרק אף\n  על פי  כתבו התוספות שרש\"י היה נזהר בכך מדאמרינן בסדר אליהו בההוא עובדא\n  דקרא ושנה הרבה ומת בחצי ימיו שאמר לו אליהו שמא הבאת לו את השמן שמא\n  הבאת לו את הפך והם ז\"ל כתבו דאין משם ראיה וכן כתבו סמ\"ג וספר התרומה\n  ואכתוב לשונם גבי כל מלאכות שאשה עושה לבעלה נדה עושה לבעלה והרא\"ש בפרק\n  אף על פי כתב דשפיר יש ראיה משם למנהג רש\"י והרב המגיד בפרק כ\"א מהלכות\n  אישות דקדק מלשון הרמב\"ם שכתב שנדה אינה נותנת הכוס ביד בעלה משמע ששאר\n  דברים יכולה היא להושיט מידה לידו וכן דעת קצת מפרשים ויש מחמירים בכל\n  דבר עכ\"ל והרשב\"א מן האוסרים שכתב  וז\"ל לא יושיט מידו לידה שום דבר שמא\n  יגע בבשרה וז\"ל רבינו ירוחם העידו על רש\"י שלא היה רוצה לתת מפתח מידו\n  לידה וכן נכון להחמיר אפילו בדבר ארוך שמא לא יזהר בטוב ויגע בידה עכ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Isserles\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Moshe Isserles</a> in his commentary there quotes the Beis Yosef and adds earlier sources who extend this practice to throwing things as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתוב בבנימין זאב סימן קנ\"ט ועל אותן המתירין לעצמן וזורקין מפתח או דבר\n  אחר מידו לידה וכו' ראוי לגעור בהן עכ\"ל וכן הוא בשערי דורא בהגהות בשם\n  מהר\"ם ז\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yehoshua Falk</a>, however, seems to think that the Tur does not agree with this extension:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5377\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Derisha Y.D. 195:4</strong></a></p>\n  \n  <p>ואסורה ליצוק לו מים לרחוץ בו פניו ידיו ורגליו אפילו אינה נוגעת בו. זה\n  לשון ב\"י [כן כתבו] סמ\"ג וסמ\"ק והרשב\"א דמיירי שהוא (רחוק) [רוחץ] והיא\n  מוצקת דאילו ליגע היא בידה אפילו בלי רחיצה אסור דהא איכא קירוב בשר\n  ואסור ליגע בה ואפילו באצבע קטנה עכ\"ל ומוכח בהדיא מזה דבשעה שהוא רוחץ\n  היא מוצקת מרחוק על ידיו וכן מוכח מדברי רבינו שלא מיעט אלא הנגיעה\n  ולאפוקי מיש מפרשים שאמרו שבכהאי גוונא נמי לא איצטריך למימר דאסור דהא\n  אפילו שאר דברים אסור להשליך מידה לידו אפילו בלי נגיעה אלא מיירי הכא\n  שאסורה ליצוק לו מים תוך משיכלא ושהוא ירחץ בו וזה אינו דרבינו לא איירי\n  בהכי ויש לומר דבכהאי גוונא סבירא ליה דמותר ומה שכתב בש\"ע וב\"י הביאו\n  דאפילו בלא רחיצה אסור להשליך מיד ליד  אפשר שהאחרונים החמירו בזה והוא\n  לא החמיר כל כך א\"נ מיירי הכא דמיקטף קטף למיא דלא נגעה אפילו על ידי\n  ניצוק ואפילו הכי אסור משום חיבת שימוש דרחיצה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Yosef Karo codifies the practice in the Shulchan Aruch, with the explanation that passing might cause touching, without mention of the extension to throwing. R. Moshe Isserles adds in the extension there:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5535\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 195:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא יושיט מידו לידה שום דבר ולא יקבלנו מידה שמא יגע בבשרה וכן על ידי\n  זריקה מידו לידה או להיפך אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Yoffe\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Mordechai Yaffe</a> codifies this practice as well, including the part about throwing, and mentions that it is because they might touch:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9276&st=&pgnum=224\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Levush Y.D. 195:2</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא יושיט מידו לידה שום דבר ולא יקבלנה מידה שמא יגע בבשרה ואפילו על\n  ידי זריקה מידו לידה או איפכא אסור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Azulai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Avraham Azulai</a>, in his glosses to the above statement of R. Mordechai Yaffe, cites an opinion that one need not be stringent regarding throwing unless it is done in a frivolous manner:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב הריק\"ש ועל ידי זריקה אין להחמיר כל שאינו דרך שחוק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Hirsch_ben_Jacob_Eisenstadt_of_Byelostok\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Avraham Hirsch Eisenstadt</a> cites a dispute whether even throwing something indirectly is problematic (i.e. throwing it up in the air and the wife \"happens\" to catch it):</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5535\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pitchei Teshuva Y.D. 195:3</a></strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עי' בשו\"ת שבסוף ס' מנחת יעקב שכתב דאסור לאשה נדה להסיר מבעלה נוצה דרך\n  נפיחה ומביא ראיה מאמימר דשקיל גברא גדפא מיניה א\"ל פסילנא לך לדינא ע\"ש\n  ועי' בתשו' הר הכרמל חי\"ד סי' י\"ח שדחה זה והעלה להתיר ע\"ש גם הכו\"פ כתב\n  דאין להחמיר בזה עוד כתב שם שראה נוהגין שזורקין דבר כלפי מעלה ולא לנוכח\n  אשתו כמתכוין לזרוק לידה והיא פושטת ידה ומקבלתו ויש להקל בזה ע\"ש [אכן\n  בס\"ט כתב דאע\"פ שיש להקל מעיקר הדין מ\"מ אין להתיר וכל המחמיר בענינים\n  כאלה תע\"ב ע\"ש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Michel_Epstein\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

I have not found a Midrash with precisely the version quoted by Tosafot. However there are other similar versions with slightly different wording, for which Tosafot's point would still be applicable.

Rambam's view has merit in places such as Avraham's meeting with the angels, because of the usage of multiple \"vayera\" - Avraham <em>sees</em> himself doing things he normally actually does. However, in the context of Yeshayahu, there's no indication that he merely saw himself doing things, but actually did those things. Moreover, an exact date and context for the event is given, which provide an explanation why it was necessary for Yeshayahu to do such a thing.</p>\n<p>The background of this strange act by Yeshayahu comes from the political turmoil that was going on at the time:</p>\n<p>Some years prior, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiglat-Pilesser III</a>, king of the Assyrian Empire, began the exile of the Ten Tribes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.15.29?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:15:29</a>), severely weakening the Kingdom of Yisrael. The exile was the Assyrian Empire's punishment for insurgent nations – they executed this punishment all over the Empire. Yisrael were punished because King Pekach had formed an alliance with Retzin, king of Aram, hoping to rebel against the Assyrians. Hoping to strengthen the alliance, they turned to Achaz, king of Yehudah, for assistance. Fearing both the wrath of the Assyrians, Achaz declined. This led the alliance to decide that Achaz and the House of David were not needed, and plotted to overthrown Achaz and set up a puppet-king, someone known only as \"ben Tav'al\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.7.5-6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 7:5-6</a>). Yeshayahu, through prophecy, assures Achaz that this won't come to pass. He must only hold out for a year or two, and the danger will pass. Yeshayahu insists that Achaz not turn to the Assyrians for help, and that salvation will come only from trusting Hashem (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.8.13-23?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 8:13-23</a>).</p>\n<p>Achaz, however, is unable to hold out for so long, and surrenders to the Assyrians, begging for help (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.16.7-9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:16:7-9</a>). The Assyrians agree, and defeat the alliance. While in Assyria, Achaz is drawn to the Assyrian idolatrous religion, and upon his return, executes changes to the Temple, building a new altar based on the one used in Damascus and allows Tiglat-Pilesser to make sacrifices on it (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.16.10-18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 10-18</a>) and then proceeded to make sacrifices himself to the gods of Assyria and built bamot all over Yehudah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.28.22-25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 2:28:22-25</a>). It is surmised that for his evil deeds, his full name, Yehoachaz, was erased from the Tanach (per the <a href=\"http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/rinap/rinap1/qpn-x-people#Q003460.65\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tiglath-pileser III 47 inscription</a>).</p>\n<p>Naturally, Yeshayahu was very angry from what had happened. That had been the consequence of what he had warned against, trusting the Assyrians. During Achaz's son Yechizkiyahu's reign, other regions in the Assyrian Empire were forming alliances to stand up against the Assyrians.</p>\n<p>One case is referred to in this chapter, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.20.1-6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 20</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was the year that the Tartan came to Ashdod—being sent by King Sargon of Assyria—and attacked Ashdod and took it...And now the LORD said, “It is a sign and a portent for Egypt and Nubia. Just as My servant Isaiah has gone naked and barefoot for three years, so shall the king of Assyria drive off the captives of Egypt and the exiles of Nubia, young and old, naked and barefoot and with bared buttocks—to the shame of Egypt!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a reference to a rebellion by the people of Ashdod, who had overthrown the Assyrian puppet-king Achimati and had made king Yamani. Yamani allied himself with the Nubian Pharaohs (of whom <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.19.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tirhaqah</a> was a descendant of) and that alliance seems to have turned to Yehudah for further assistance. Though this isn't directly mentioned in the Tanach, it's both implied in this chapter and makes sense, considering a different alliance is directly stated to have turned to Yehudah: The Kasdim, at the behest of Berodach Bal'adan, king of Babylon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.20.12-15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:20:12-15</a>). When the Babylonians turned to Yechiakiyahu, he actually welcomed them and entertained them, showing them his treasury. It would make sense that Yechizkiyahu equally pondered the Ashdodean-Nubian/Egyptian alliance's requests.</p>\n<p>For this reason Yeshayahu removed his clothes and walked barefoot, to make the statement he made in the name of Hashem in the chapter: All such alliances have no hope, all such alliances will fall and be exiled in disgrace, naked and barefoot. Rabbi Bin Nun explains that most likely Yeshayahu didn't walk around that way for three whole years, but did it whenever any group of envoys would come to Yehudah to request the king's assistance. It took three years of doing this, before the alliance fell. Yechizkiyahu had ultimately not assisted them, but it seems that his considering this possibility brought upon the fall of Lachish and other cities in Yehudah and the near-fall of Yerushalayim (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.18.13-19.37?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:18:13-19:37</a>) – punishment for trusting other world powers instead of Hashem, as Yeshayahu had warned.</p>\n\n\n",

People have told me that this is an absolute - 40 days of non-stop rain. It's obviously false. While Houston got the equivalent of their 40 days of rain (and more) last year, I know of nowhere in the world that has had 40 days of continuous rain since the days of Noach. It's possible that the expression means, more simply, that there will be rain <strong>at some point</strong> of each of the next 40 days. That is possible and does happen in numerous tropical climates. I gather that during the summer it rains at some point daily in Florida during the summer, esp. But, I think if you asked a meteorologist, I don't think she would correlate this with Shavuot.</p>\n\n<p>As for the source of this idea, I have heard these:</p>\n\n<p>Torah is compared to water. Moshe was on the mountain for 40 days, beginning from Shavuot, receiving and learning the Torah. So, it must have rained up there for 40 days.</p>\n\n<p>The giving of the Torah was accompanied by a \"thunderstorm\" on Shavuot. The Torah never mentions anything about it stopping. So, people assumed that this storm lasted the entire time that Moshe was on the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>Take the above as mere hearsay. This <em>may</em> be the actual source or not. It's just what I have heard in the past from a few people. I have no idea where they heard it from. It's often difficult to verify the source of superstitions.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Killing of the nations of Canaan\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always understood Judaism as being the most peaceful religion, the one that doesn't go on crusades or various campaigns of forced conversions. However, how do I approach the fact that we killed the nations in Canaan in order to get Eretz Yısrael? Because at the end of the day our doing so is no different than any other religion claiming they kill because of their religion.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>First, we can't take that much credit for not launching a Crusade or Jihad -- for the past 2,000 years we lacked the opportunity! So, as a debating point with outsiders, it won't get you very far.</p>\n\n<p>That said, within Judaism, there aren't the grounds for doing so. We do not believe in a world where everyone is supposed to be Jewish, or that non-Jews are fated for a horrible afterlife, or any some such.</p>\n\n<p>So, what about the Canaanites...</p>\n\n<p>Hashem plunked us down in the middle of a horrible barbarian society. Where girls like Rachav were routinely placed into prostitution by their own family (!) when she was 10 (Zevachim 116b) and boys were routinely burnt alive as sacrifices to Molekh. (Later ritualized into passing the son over the fire, or between two fires.)</p>\n\n<p>Still, there are limitations on the war. We must offer peace first (Devarim 20:10-11, also Sifri, Devarim #199, and codified by the Rambam at H. Melakhim 6:1). Which means non-combatants were given a chance to escape, if their rulers would allow the option. When laying siege to a city, you have to give the civilians a route to escape. (Ramban on Sefer haMitzvos, assei #5, Rambam ibid 6:7) Also, women and children are not to be killed. (Rambam ibid 6:4; although one may kill someone posing an immediate threat, even if a child, as a danger to life would trump this halakhah.)</p>\n\n<p>What does this gain, if the law is genocidal? Let's get back to the Crusades for a moment. No, we weren't expected to tell the Canaanites \"convert or die\". But, those escaping could choose to observe the 7 mitzvos benei Noach and leave the label \"Kenaani\" (Canaanite) that way. For a deeply polytheistic people, it is a significant conversion of sorts.</p>\n\n<p>None of which directly answers your question, just modified it. It's where I run out of sources.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my own opinion: Since we were, indeed, dealing with a bunch of barbarian warriors, let's understand what would happen if we showed any weakness. It could be that we were told to take out Amaleiq entirely, people and culture, the way new prisoners in fiction are advised that to get peace, they should start by taking on \"the toughest prisoner in the cell block\". And similarly a strong stance with the other local warring tribes. What looks to us, living in a modern civilization, as a violent path. may well have been advised by G-d as the path to the least death overall!</p>\n\n<p>But we didn't actually finish either job -- neither killing out Amaleiq nor dispossessing the Kenaani tribes. Hashem then brings civilization to the region -- through Assyria and Sanhcheirev. An empire that sought unity by mixing populations, weakening loyalty to one's own specific tribe and land at the expense of Greater Assyria. The \"Ten Lost Tribes\" are lost at this point, but the identity of the Amaleiqim and Kenaanim are also lost. All of these laws become moot. And just when the force of a civil government makes my suggested reason for such laws also moot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I will only address the aspect of why God commanded killing the Canaanite nations, as I gather that is the basis of your question.</p>\n\n<p>Devarim (Deuteronomy) 27:16-18, states that regarding the \"close nations\", namely, the Canaanite nations, you should not offer them any peace treaty but rather kill every soul. Verse 18 explains why - so that they should not teach you to do the abominations that they did to their gods.</p>\n\n<p>The land of Israel is unlike other lands in the world. Everywhere else, people inhabit the land and act as they wish. When God promised the land of Israel, he wanted the land to be a holy place inhabited by holy people who would obey God's laws as given to B'nai Yisra'el. We see numerous times throughout the Torah that God specifically states that one of the punishments for not following his laws would be exile.</p>\n\n<p>A good example of my point can be found near the end of Vayikra (Lev.) chapter 18. It lists illict relationships, and then mentions not to sacrifice your child to Molech, and some other items. Beginning in verse 24, its says not to defile yourselves with all these things, because this is what the other nations did. These people defiled the land, and the land purged them. (Actually, G-d caused the land to do this.)</p>\n\n<p>Verse 28 is the \"key\" verse. It says not to imitate the nations habits so that the land won't purge you in the same way that it purged the other nations.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, it is as if the land of Israel has an inherent \"personality\". Things such as idolatry, harlotry, illicit relationships, child sacrifices to gods etc. cause the land itself to be \"sickened\" and \"vomit\" its inhabitants. Thus, G-d doesn't want His chosen people to be influenced in any way by such inhabitants. Call it \"preventive medicine\", given by the ultimate doctor (See Ex. 15 where God is called a \"doctor\".)</p>\n\n<p>As for your claim, \"it is no different than any other religion claiming they kill because of their religion,\" I am not knowledgeable about the reasoning or foundations of every other world religion to know exactly why they murder people. If you are able to show that in their religious book (such as the Koran, etc.) that God commanded killing people with an explanation of exactly when and why that command was given, we can have an intelligent discussion / debate on this. Beyond that, I have demonstrated that God's commandment to destroy specific nations as above as well as Amalek, was limited to that time, only, and only those people. Other than self defense, there is no instance where God has commanded killing a nation. So, without a different religion explaining these same ideas, I think we can conclude that another religion claiming killing for religious purposes is a man-made idea and not God-given.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is important to note that, before starting war, there is a commandment (obligation) to offer peace. According to at least Ramban and Rambam that also applied to Canaanite nations.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When you approach a town to attack it, you shall offer it terms of\n  peace (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 20:10</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On this the Ramban <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.10?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">comments</a> (translation artscroll)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] the calling out for peace must be done even in an obligatory\n  war, for we are required to call out for peace even to the seven\n  Canaanite nations [as can be seen with Sihon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.2.26?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:26</a>), one of the\n  seven nations].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ramban continues and explains one Canaanite city did indeed make peace with Israel (the Hiviite in Gibeon) and comments all is asked of them is to accept the seven Noahide commandments.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam codifies this in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MT Melachim 6:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>War is not conducted against anyone in the world until they are first\n  offered peace (and refuse it), whether this is a Discretionary War or\n  a War of Mitzvoh, as it says, “when you come close to the city to\n  fight with it, you shall call to it to make peace” (Deut. 20:10). If\n  they make peace and accept the Seven Commandments incumbent upon the\n  Sons of Noah (Gentiles), none of them are killed [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.6.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:4</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If they do not come to peaceful terms or they make peace but do not\n  accept the Seven Commandments, we engage in war against them [and bad\n  things happen]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The reason that he is not punished is since he is unresponsible for his actions he is considered an <em>oness</em> (acting unwillingly).</p>\n\n<p>He then asks if so why does the Gemara need to use a is a special pasuk  <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.114a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Lo Saachilum\"</a> to teach that an adult may not feed a minor non-kosher food, why wouldn't this be included in the general prohibition of <em>lifnei iver lo titen michshol</em> (causing or being an accessory to someone else's sinning)?</p>\n\n<p>He answers that although when the katan eats the food and enjoys it it is considered a <em>maaseh aveira</em> (act of sin), it is not considered a <em>michshol</em> (stumble), since (as mentioned above) he is considered an <em>oness</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We can clearly deduce from this that, in his opinion, when someone causes someone to commit an aveira through <em>oness</em>, there is no aveira of <em>lifnei iver</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In the same sefer (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9608&st=%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%A1%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A1&pgnum=175\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קונטרס בעניני אונס ענף ג</a>), in regard to מכניס עצמו לאונס (someone who brings himself into a situation where he does an aveira through <em>oness</em>), the author writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מצד הסברא נראה לי ברור דפטור כיון דמ\"מ בשעה שעובר אנוס הוא... <strong>אף\n  דבודאי איסור דאורייתא עשה במה שהכניס עצמו לאונס משום לפני עור לא תתן\n  מכשול</strong>, דמה לי מכשיל אחרים או שמכשיל את עצמו, אבל מ\"מ בגוף העבירה\n  אנוס הוא.</p>\n  \n  <p>When someone causes himself into a situation where he does an aveira\n  through <em>oness</em>, although <strong>he definitely transgresses the aveira of\n  <em>lifnei iver lo titen michshol</em></strong>, for there is no difference between when one causes another to stumble, or if he causes himself to\n  stumble, nevertheless he is not punished with the punishment of the\n  aveira itself, since after all as far as the aveira is concerned he is\n  an <em>oness</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This shows that even when the sinner is considered an oness and therefore not punished for his aveira, the one who caused him to do it is nevertheless guilty of <em>lifnei iver</em>.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be in contradiction to that which he said by a <em>katan</em>. How can we resolve it?</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/92004/is-someone-permitted-to-force-another-person-to-do-an-aveira-by-threatening-him\">Is someone permitted to force another person to do an Aveira by threatening him with death?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We can clearly deduce from this that, in his opinion, when someone\n  causes someone to commit an aveira through oness, there is no aveira\n  of lifnei iver.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I believe this is an unnecessary deduction, because he says this explicitly in the paragraph beginning ואין להקשות by using the term חברו.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for the substance of your question I think the answer may be as follows:</p>\n\n<p>There is a clear difference between the first case and the second case. In the first case he is talking about a situation where a person is an אנוס prior to anyone else's involvement. A katan is an אנוס because he lacks <em>da'as</em>. He lacks <em>da'as</em> whether someone enables him to do an <em>aveirah</em> or whether he is on an isolated island for his entire life. If he would do an <em>aveirah</em> himself, it's not a problem since he is an אנוס – as the author writes, the act does not even require atonement. Therefore, when someone else enables him to do an <em>aveirah</em> he is not enabling anything problematic, and therefore there is no <em>issur</em> of <em>lifnei iver</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the second case it is an entirely different story. There is no inherent אונס involved. If we imagine the person split into two people, we have the guy who actually does the <em>aveirah</em>, and the guy who put him into the situation where he had to do the <em>aveirah</em>. In this case, had the first guy done the <em>aveirah</em> on his own it would have been a full-fledged sin. The second guy who put him in the situation where he had to do the sin, has therefore caused him to do a full-fledged sin. Of course, then, the second guy has violated lifnei iver – there is no greater lifnei iver than this! He actually forced someone to do an aveirah. Now it happens to be that after the fact we will say that the first guy is exempt because he was forced, but that only means that we're transferring the blame from the first guy to the second guy. In no way can that be used to pardon the second guy.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's merge the two people back together again. When the person does the <em>aveirah</em> in the moment of אונס he is only pardoned because the blame is transferred to his earlier self which forced him into the situation. That earlier self caused the later self to do a full-fledged <em>aveirah</em> and has thus violated <em>lifnei iver</em>.</p>\n\n<p>We can see this principle by viewing another angle. Imagine someone feeds someone else non-kosher food (where the second guy believes that it's kosher). Now the second guy didn't do anything wrong (he is allowed to rely on the first guy that it's kosher) so would you say that the first guy does not violate <em>lifnei iver</em>? </p>\n\n\n",

I wanted to bring a proof from halacha 11 which discusses a kohen which has a 6th finger and if he cuts it off then he is kasher to do avodah(if the finger didnt have a bone). So we see that this can be corrected ,so maybe it applies to all blemishes. However, the Rambam does not give this advice for many of the other blemishes.  Does anyone discuss this question? </p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Whence \"בחזקת בשרי\"?",
    "content": "# Whence \"בחזקת בשרי\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Besides the main categories of meat, dairy, and pareve (non-meat, non-dairy) foods, two special subcategories of pareve foods are relevant to <em>halacha</em> (e.g. <em>Yore Dea</em> 93): pareve food cooked using clean meat utensils, and pareve food cooked using clean dairy utensils.</p>\n\n<p>In America, those foods are colloquially known as \"[meat/dairy/<em>other words</em>] <em>kelim</em>\" or \"[meat/dairy/<em>other words</em>] equipment\". (<em>Kelim</em> means \"receptacles\".) In fact, what's probably the largest kashruth supervisory agency in the United States, <a href=\"//oukosher.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Orthodox Union</a>, has in the past allowed products to have a \"DE\" certification mark, signifying \"dairy equipment\". And this all makes a lot of sense: the phrase \"dairy equipment\", or \"meat <em>kelim</em>\", or the like, refers, as a <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">metonym</a>, to the food that was prepared on such equipment.</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, on the other hand, those foods are called \"<em>b'chezkas [b'sari/chalavi]</em>\", \"with/in a <em>chazaka</em> of [meat/dairy]\". In its normal uses in <em>halacha</em>, \"<em>chazaka</em>\" is probably best translated \"status\": it refers to the state that something or someone is in or can be presumed to be in absent evidence of a change of state. So these foods are called \"with a status of meat\" or \"with a presumption of dairy\" or the like. Why? They're not meat or dairy themselves; nor is there any halachic <em>chazaka</em> (that I know of) that says that they are. Where does this \"<em>b'chezkas</em>\" wording come from and why is this state referred to by this terminology?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>They are referred to as B'echezkat because they are always held and used for the purpose of cooking or storing said products. It also can refer to food that's pareve but was cooked in (generally) clean receptacles, so that although the food isn't strictly speaking meaty or milky, it may not be eaten together.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Israel you will often find foods considered בחזקת בשרי have parve ingredients but may have been contaminated by nearby meat foods, such as french fries in a fast-food schwarma restaraunt.</p>\n<p>According to sefardic halachic tradition, \"meat equipment\" is an irrelevant category.   It is identical to parve.   But \"chezkat besari\" cannot be considered parve.</p>\n\n\n",

The accepted practice is that one makes no shrouds for\n  them as [for] other dead, but one buries them in their garments over\n  which [they place] a sheet as [in the case] of other dead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Question: At what point in the birth process is the woman's death called a death at childbirth, in regard to not burying her with <em>tachricim</em> (shrouds)? At what point does it begin? From the beginning of labor? If so what point is the beginning? Until when? Until the completion of the delivery of the child? What if complications began at childbirth and the actual death occurred later on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The reason for this Halacha, is the same reason a murder victim is buried in his clothing. That way any blood considered דם הנפש - that the life left with this blood - would be buried. According to this, the B'ach writes, it all depends on blood loss at the time of death. If there is none, normal tachrichim would be used.</p>\n\n<p>The Taz is of the opinion that within 30 days of the birth, tachrichim would not be used. </p>\n\n<p>The Chochmas Adam 157/11 brings the Bach and a number of other minhagim, and conclueds נהרא נהרא ופשטא meaning there are various minhagim, and each one is fine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Partial answer:</p>\n\n<p>The Pischei Teshuvah (YD 364:5, printed under the Shulchan Aruch) quotes the Teshuvos Shemen Rokeiach 2:13 regarding whether a woman who died during childbirth and the midwives can’t get the baby out naturally, if they can perform a C-section on her. The Pischei Teshuvah disagrees with the Rokeiach’s answer and holds that one really shouldn’t, and it certainly shouldn’t hold up the burial, but that since the Minhag is to do it anyway, we give them three days to remove the child. </p>\n\n<p>From the fact that he brings down this discussion here implies that he understood the Rema to be discussing a case where she died shortly before the birth itself. </p>\n\n<p>This isn’t the strongest of proofs, which is why I labeled it as a partial answer. </p>\n\n\n",

Rambam (and others) hold that the <em>berachah</em> is recited by the <em>mesader kiddushin</em> on behalf of the groom over the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>kiddushin</em> that he is about to perform (<em>birkat hamitzvot</em>).

Thus, if the groom were to speak between the <em>berachah</em> and the <em>kiddushin</em> there would be a <em>hefsek</em>. <strong>However, we would not tell him to repeat the <em>berachah</em> before performing the <em>kiddushin</em>, because of the principle that we are lenient when it comes to doubtful <em>berachot</em>, and there is the opinion of the Rosh that it is a <em>birkat hashevach</em>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus it seems that in your case as well, we would not require that the <em>berachah</em> be repeated, in deference to the view of Rosh.</p>\n\n\n",

Blessed is He Who chose them and their teachings. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/84860/9682\">Here</a> I ask why this particular formulation is used, but the idea is that it makes the point that this Perek is not actually from Mishnayos Avos, but rather a Braisa (in this case, Kallah and Seder Eliyahu Zuta). </p>\n\n<p>Why is it only here? Take the fourth Perek of Bikkurim as an example, Perek Adreigonus. It’s not actually from Mishnayos Bikkurim, but rather added from the second Perek of Tosefta Bikkurim. I don’t see that Perek beginning with this notation. For a single-Mishnah example, take Pesachim 4:9; the Gemara on 56a only quotes 4:8 and brings down 4:9 as ”Tanu Rabbanan” (which introduces a Braisa). So why is Avos 6 the only one that gets this notation?</p>\n\n<p>While one could argue that it’s because it’s recited publicly, the words of Rashi on the Mishnah would seem to indicate otherwise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>שָׁנוּ חֲכָמִים בִּלְשׁוֹן הַמִּשְׁנָה.</strong> כְּלוֹמַר בְּרַיְתָא הִיא וּבִלְשׁוֹן הַמִּשְׁנָה הִיא שְׁנוּיָה, אֲבָל אֵינָהּ מִשְׁנָה. וּמַה שָּׁנוּ, רַבִּי מֵאִיר אוֹמֵר וְכוּ'. וּלְפִי שֶׁעַד עַכְשָׁיו כָּל הַפְּרָקִים מִשְׁנָה, לְפִיכָךְ הֻצְרַךְ לְהוֹדִיעַ שֶׁמִּכָּאן וְאֵילָךְ בְּרַיְתָא הִיא. וּמִתּוֹךְ שֶׁהַלָּלוּ דִּבְרֵי הַגָּדָה הֵן וּמְסַפְּרוֹת בְּעֵסֶק תַּלְמוּד תּוֹרָה נָהֲגוּ לְאָמְרָן בְּבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת עִם שְׁאָר פְּרָקִים הַלָּלוּ שֶׁל מַסֶּכֶת אָבוֹת:  </p>\n  \n  <p>That is to say, this is a Braisa, taught in the language of the Mishnah, but it’s not a Mishnah. What was taught? “R’ Meir said, etc.” Since up until now all these Perakim were Mishnah, therefore it’s needed to inform that from here on is Braisa.

I'm not talking about long flights from LA (Friday) to Australia (Saturday) - this is a 30-minute flight and the time difference between American Samoa and \"New Zealand\" Samoa is 24 hours!</p>\n\n<p>What do you think about a case like this?</p>\n\n<p>We assume the day of Shabbat follows the convention of the international date line, so can you skip on Shabbat in a very short time?

Are you going back in time by 24 hours? Can you do that or that's not allowed?</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone ever looked into the case of \"jumping\" between time zone from one place to another in a very short time?

This is stated explicitely Bava Kama 87a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חֵרֵשׁ, שׁוֹטֶה וְ<strong>קָטָן, פְּגִיעָתָן רָעָה</strong>. הַחוֹבֵל בָּהֶן חַיָּב, וְהֵם שֶׁחָבְלוּ בַּאֲחֵרִים פְּטוּרִין<br>\n  A deaf and mute ,an imbecile and <strong>a child, one should avoid meeting as meeting them is of a bad consequence</strong>. One who damages them is liable, but if they damage someone they are exempt from paying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramban says don't stand on a roof without a fence. So one who does is not <em>oneis Gammur</em> because a responsible person should anticipate that any wind that pushes him off even unlikely as hurricane could make him fall off and damage someone else when there is no fence. He is <em>oneis</em> which means he has to pay regarding human damage.   </p>\n\n<p>But the Ramban agrees that were he utterly helpless like when he damaged someone who slept next to him (after he'd fallen asleep), he is not liable to pay for any damage as he is an <em>Oneis Gammur</em>. Simalarly A child, imbecile and a deaf mute, are not accountable and their actions are like those sleeping without control (i.e the child has no mitzvos to keep to stop him damaging others). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(I think this might be largely similar to David Kenner's answer, perhaps just expressed differently.)</p>\n\n<p>There is a fundamental difference between an adult and a minor. An adult is a person who has responsibility for his actions while a minor is a person who does not have responsibility for his actions.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to determining if an adult is chayav in a particular case, there are various mitigating factors that we can look at which can potentially absolve him. One such factor is the concept of אונס. This is a way of saying that even though the person is responsible for his actions, there are certain things which free him of his responsibility.</p>\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=11&hilchos=64&perek=4&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">if a person locked up his sheep properly and it somehow got out and it damaged, the person is exempt</a> because he fulfilled his responsibility by locking it up; the fact that it got out is considered \"beyond his control\".</p>\n\n<p>Ramban's point is that when the damage is committed by the person himself, there is no such thing as \"beyond his control\". That is to say that there is nothing that can free him of his responsibility when it comes to his own self doing damage. The only thing that can get him out of being chayav in such a case is if the blame is shifted to another person. For example, as Ramban explains there, in the case where someone goes to sleep and someone else lies down next to him, the first person is exempt if he damages the second person while sleeping because the second person should not have laid down next to someone sleeping:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומצאתי בתוס' בב\"ק שמפרשים אותה משום אדם המזיק וא\"כ למה פטרוהו לדברי\n  האומר אנוס הוא והלא אדם מועד לעולם בין באונס בין ברצון והם השיבו שאינו\n  חייב באונסין גדולים וסמכו אותה מן הירו' שאמרו בישן ובא חבירו וישן אצלו\n  הוא המועד ואי אפשי להעמידה דהתם משום דשני פשע בעצמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, by a minor where he is not responsible for his actions in the first place, it is completely irrelevant whether something was beyond his control or not; even if it was not beyond his control he is still exempt because he is not responsible for his actions. In a sense, the difference can be described as follows: An adult can be put on trial and can argue that he has an excuse in a specific case, with the caveat (according to Ramban) that there are no excuses when the damage is committed with his own self. A minor can never be put on trial in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>The fact that the Chelkas Yoav uses the term אנוס when referring to a minor is somehwhat of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">red herring</a>. As I explained in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93192/13438\">my answer</a> to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93185/contradiction-in-chelkas-yoav-regarding-lifnei-iver-when-the-aveira-is-done-by-o\">your other question about the Chelkas Yoav's view of אונס with regard to minors</a>, he is using the term in a limited sense, to compare it to the case in the Torah where someone does not get punished for committing a sin. He is by no means using the term to <strong>increase</strong> a minor's level of obligation. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This seems ultimately logical to me from studying the matter. I have no source right now. :</p>\n\n<p>A person has two levels we are looking at.</p>\n\n<p>1) If the person can be responsible for anything in the first place?\n2) Once responsibility is possible, then to what extent?</p>\n\n<p>Adults are capable of responsibility being placed upon them. They must then be assigned a level of culpability (accident, total accident, premeditated, etc.) depending on the situation (like sin, or damages etc.)</p>\n\n<p>Minors are not capable of having any responsibility placed upon them.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, any further discussion of \"accident vs intentional\" is completely irrelevant. </p>\n\n<p>We might be dismayed at the Ramban claiming an adult is obligated to pay even when it is a complete accident. However, that has no follow up bearing upon minors, who could never be responsible for anything at all. The logical proof may be seen by the case of a minor who certainly intends to do harm and causes direct damage... he is exempt from any and all payments. Why? Because he has nothing to do with any responsibility for his actions, period.</p>\n\n<p>But, an adult, who does have an initial concept of responsibility placed upon him, is now subject to questions of responsibility for onus. </p>\n\n<p>The Chelkas Yoav, is comparing a minor's trangressing a sin willingly, to an adult's sin when \"compelled\". He does not compare to the case of \"damages\" at all. Paying a damage is a question of financial responsibility. That is something a minor has no connection to. An adult's sin is a function of his intent, not only a function of his responsibility. An adult's damages are purely a function of responsibility, not intent. (generally)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

Period. Not to curse your parents is a different prohibition, and it’s learned out from Shemos 21 and Vayikra 20, where it says that one who does so gets the death penalty. That one gets a curse, as should be clear by this point, does not make something a prohibition. No need to resort to Devarim 27. </p>\n\n\n",

The Saducees believed that the priest who burnt the red cow needed to be totally pure such that he'd only be allowed to do it if he waited for sunset. The sages held that he is able to burn the cow, even after only immersing in water, thus they made him impure and had him immerse so that everyone could see that they were not following the opinion of the Saducees.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a matter of fact, since the Kohen involved was rendered impure to a certain extent, the Sages enacted many other stringencies in the purity required for the preparation of the Parah Adumah ashes, so that people would not take it lightly.

What would be so terrible if people mistakenly adopted the stricter view of the Saducees in this case? What would be the chances of a Parah Adumah naturally ever being prepared by a <em>tevul yom</em> (someone who has immersed and is waiting for sunset), and thus serving as a source of conflict between those following the views of the Rabbis and those following the Saducees?</p>\n\n<p>Was this solely about discrediting the Saducees whenever and wherever possible, or is there something else going on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I heard an explanation in the name of Rav Shimshon Pinkus ZTL, as to why the <em>Chachamim</em> (sages) chose the <em>Para Adumah</em> as one of the places to discredit the opinion of the <em>Tzedokim</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Based on RASHI BAMIDBAR 19:22:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פרה אדמה. משל לבן שפחה שטנף פלטין של מלך אמרו תבא אמו ותקנח הצואה, כך\n  תבא פרה ותכפר על העגל:</p>\n  \n  <p>A RED COW — Why this rite was performed with a cow may be exemplified\n  by a parable it may be compared to the case of a handmaid’s child that\n  defiled the king’s palace.

(Midrash Tanchuma, Chukat 8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Summary: The <em>Parah Adumah</em> came as an atonement for the sin of the <em>Eigel- hazahav</em> (the golden calf).</p>\n\n<p>The <em>meforshim</em> (commentaries) explain, (There are many sources to this, I don't have them available at present), that the sin of the B'nei Yisrael at the <em>eigel</em> was the request to serve Hashem through tangeble/visual \"<em>emtzaim</em>\",  intermediaries.</p>\n\n<p>This is rooted in the difficulty of accepting what one cannot physically see.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main areas in which the <em>Tzedokim</em> disagreed with the mainstream Torah ideology, was regarding the acceptance of <em>Torah-Shebaal-Peh</em>, The oral Torah.</p>\n\n<p>This is also connected to the idea of \"What I see (in the written Torah with my own eyes) is what I accept.</p>\n\n<p>Since the atonement of the <em>Parah Adumah</em> for the Sin of the <em>eigel</em> depended on uprooting this ideology, therefore the <em>Chachamim</em> felt it important to go out of their way to discredit the <em>Tzdedokim</em> in the process of the <em>Parah Adumah</em> procedure.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch explains in his commentary to <em>Chukas</em> that this command was chosen for the discrediting because it was such a public ceremony.

Things are going great, they're succeeding in all sorts of areas, when suddenly there occurs (ch\"v) a tragedy in this person's family. The situation, so to speak, \"covers\" over his regular joy, not allowing it to shine through as usual.</p>\n\n<p>Another scenario: consider someone who is extremely intelligent, but has a speach impairment which effectively prevents his great intellect to be expressed outwards properly. </p>\n\n<p>In Chassidus/Kabbalah, oftentimes the words Darkness and Light are mentioned. In a (very) general sense, these terms can be observable in the above instances. Light = where things are looking good, you can see a bright future ahead, etc; intellect, where ideas are clear in your head, the answers are known to you (like when you turn on the lights in a dark room) and so on.\nDarkness = the hidden state of those things, like (from the above examples) a speech impairment or a tragedy. </p>\n\n<p>The thing is, that darkness isn't really a \"thing\". All it is, is a lack of light. But I cannot, for example, make a device that creates darkness.</p>\n\n<p>In Chassidic teachings, G-dliness (meaning, a positive spiritual expression, whether as a miracle, as a positive state of being, or quite simply a palpable, practical connection to G-d) is likewise represented by the term \"Light\". </p>\n\n<p>And then there's the darkness which blocks off the G-dliness, something which can occur in many different ways. One classic example: when the world is in full-on \"G-dliness\" mode, it is clear and plain for all to see that all is in the hands or G-d, that He is running the show, and so on.

    "content": "# Is one allowed to attend a wake for a Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I understand, Jews are not allowed to have a wake for a Jewish person. But, let's say for some reason, they do it, anyway. Is a Jew allowed to attend this event if s/he doesn't view the deceased? In other words, is there a problem with going to the funeral home where the wake is and standing by the coffin and just offering condolences to the deceased's family, etc. but just not viewing the dead body? Any problem of <em>marit ayin</em>, conveying a message of consent / approval (similar to someone attending an intermarriage), or anything else, perhaps?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/01/24/attending-an-open-casket-funeral/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">dinonline</a> was asked that question and answers</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Question: Can [a Jew] attend a wake where the body is laid out in an open casket?<br><br>\n  Answer: Certainly. In Jewish burials, the body is buried without the casket,\n  although it is usually coverered over in respect for the deceased.\n  There is no prohibition, however, in attending a funeral where the\n  body is not covered over.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sources: See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.362.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De’ah 362</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I am not 100% sure they understood the question, possibly because their <em>rabbanim</em> are based in Israel where wakes don't exist. But it clarifies the issue is not with the opened casket. Although I heard from two rabbanim one shouldn't uncover a body or watch it because it is in a state where it cannot defend itself from <em>mazikin</em> (would be interested if anyone has a source).</p>\n\n<p>However, as the SA quoted above mentions, there is a halacha to bury the dead and our practice is to do so as quickly as practical. As such practices that unnecessarily delay the burial are frowned upon.</p>\n\n<p>I thought that maybe a wake has idolatrous connotations (e.g., a source in worshipping the dead) and should be forbidden because of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/535/what-makes-something-chukat-goyim\"><em>hukot hagoyim</em></a>. But interestingly, it is possible the wake has its <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wake_(ceremony)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">origins</a> in the Jewish practice to guard the dead (<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shemira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shemira</a></em>) before burial.</p>\n\n<p>The closest I found to forbidding a wake is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.343?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 343:1</a> which places a ban on someone who sees an unburied Jewish corpse and does not attend to its burial needs.</p>\n\n<p>So ultimately this might depend on circumstances. Maybe in some cases going to a wake and participating in a voluntary delay on the funeral will be forbidden. If the funeral is <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281551/jewish/Timing-the-Funeral-Service.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">delayed</a> to wait for a close parent, maybe going there and saying <em>tehilim</em> is part of guarding the deceased.</p>\n\n<p>As always, <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">ask your rav</a> before trying anything you read here in the real world.</p>\n\n\n",

What does the third day accomplish and why would it be necessary -- other seven day impurities aside from tumat met have their purification at the close of the impurity time. Why add in an interim step?</p>\n<p>The \"three day\" period seems to have a halachic consequence in terms of <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Shiva#cite_note-34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">working</a> (as per Moed Katan, 21b) but I'm wondering if there is a stronger explanation for the third day's sprinkling.</p>\n<p>*the midrash also connects it to the \"third month\" during which we received the Torah but doesn't explore that idea.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>, in his grand exposition of the symbolism in the red heifer procedure<sup>1</sup>, relates the third and seventh days of the procedure to the Third and Seventh Days of Creation and to the basic regulations of Man that were introduced on each.</p>\n\n<p>The point of the procedure, according to R' Hirsch, is to restore the patient's sense of human free-willed ability to choose service of God over sin. This sense had been damaged by the patient's contact with a dead body, which evokes a strong sense of humans as strictly physical beings, strictly compelled by the laws of nature. The free-willed submission to God's will that the procedure revives applies to two basic aspects of human existence: physical and mental/spiritual.</p>\n\n<p>The very basest physical activities that humans engage in - consumption, growth, reproduction, etc., we share with all living things, starting (as far as the Torah's categories in the Creation account are concerned) with plant life. In the Creation account, God Created plants on the Third Day and immediately applied a law to regulate their reproduction - \"לְמִינוֹ\" - \"for its own species\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 1:11</a>). In his commentary on Genesis 1:11-13, R' Hirsch, channeling the Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.60a.55-63?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chulin 60a</a>, says that this law of heredity, which the plants follow as a matter of natural law, is meant to be an example to humans of all the checks on our own physical activities that laws of morality are meant to impose, should we choose to submit to them. So we sprinkle on the third day of the procedure to restore our sense of free will in submitting to God's restrictions on our physical activities.</p>\n\n<p>On the Seventh Day, God stopped His own Creation activity, thus setting an example for humans' duty to regulate the aspect of ourselves that'd Godly - our ability to impose our will on the world around us through creative acts.<sup>2</sup> So, we sprinkle again on the seventh day of the procdeure to restore our sense of free will in submitting to God's restrictions on our high-level, mental, spiritual, willful activities.</p>\n\n<p>The sprinking must occur in these two stages in order, since the human has to first assume free-willed control over his/her physical powers before assuming control over his/her mental/spiritual powers.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1.

If there was a tool that received its first <em>haza'a</em> and then broke, it could have its second one immediately - on the same day. Although this is disputed in the <em>mishna</em>, according to Ra\"v the dissenting opinion is not based on a disagreement with the rationale of separating the two purification steps, but an external technicality that this <em>d'rabanan</em> purification should follow the same guidelines as the official one required by the Torah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִזָּה עֲלֵיהֶן, נִשְׁבְּרוּ בוֹ בַיּוֹם, הִתִּיכָן וְחָזַר וְהִזָּה עֲלֵיהֶן שֵׁנִית בּוֹ בַיּוֹם, הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ טְהוֹרִין, דִּבְרֵי רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר.</p>\n<p>רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ אוֹמֵר, אֵין הַזָּיָה פָּחוֹת מִשְּׁלִישִׁי וּשְׁבִיעִי:</p>\n<p>הלכך לא חשו אלא שיהא כאן שתי הזאות. ומיהו בעודן שבורים לא מהני הזאה, דלא שייכא הזאה בשברים. ובעי נמי שתהא שבירה מפסקת בין הזאה להזאה, לפי שיש הפסק ימים בין הזאת שלישי להזאת שביעי. ולא רצו להחמיר בחזרת טומאה ישנה, שהיא דרבנן, והקלו שתועיל בה הזאה אפילו שתיהן ההזאות ביום אחד:\nר׳ יהושע אומר אין הזאה פחות משלישי ושביעי. דתקון כעין דאורייתא. והלכה כרבי יהושע:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The root of the word \"רעה\" means \"friend\", as <em>Elokim horoeh osi me'odi</em>, G-d who has been my shepherd (Breishis 48:15, see the Ramban ad loc.). This, indeed, is the <em>teruah</em> of \"<em>u'teruas Melech bo</em>, the blast for the King is among them\" (Bamidbar 23:21) mentioned in the verses of the <em>Malhiyos</em> blessing. This connotes closeness and intimacy between <em>Ribbono Shel Olam</em> and <em>Bnei Yisroel</em> and is proof that we are priviledged to have <em>HaKadosh Baruch Hu</em> as a friend. This is not <em>din</em> but rather <em>rachamim</em>, mercy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>With this new given meaning of teruah: \"teruah\" denotes a sense of kinship and closeness. Bamidbar 23:21 “<em>He perceived no iniquity in Jacob, and saw no perversity in Israel. Hashem his God is with him, u’teru’at Melech bo</em>” (Bamidbar 23:21). Rashi renders this last phrase as “and the friendship of the King is in him,” since, he explains, the word teru’ah is a derivative of the Hebrew word re’ut, friendship. </p>\n\n<p>Is this what 'the shout of a King amongst them' or 'shouting for the King is among them' or 'And their King’s acclaim in their midst' means? <strong>Why is this friendship or closeness specifically connected with the sound of a Shofar in the form of a Teruah blast</strong>? </p>\n\n<p>I didn't understand these explanations quite well, so maybe someone could explain it more clearly to me. </p>\n\n\n",

There were grammatical comments which seemed to say that this is the only and proper vowel placement, though when I compare it with בְּקֹרְאֵי earlier in the pasuk it seemed that the chirik should be under the aleph as it is in the title of <a href=\"http://israelbookshop.com/mm5/graphics/Israeli_Textbooks_Language/ISR-TXT-H-10480.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this book</a>.</p>\n<p>R. Hirsch however, writes (במדבר פרשת שלח פרק יד)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א' של \"קראים\" היא נחה והקרי הוא \"קורים\", כאילו נגזר הפעל משורש \"קרה\". נראה לנו שהבדל זה שבין קרי לכתיב מגלה את הסוד, במה זכו הם שה' ענם יותר משאר בני תמותה. כאשר קראו אל ה' הם \"נקרו לקראתו\", נפגשו עמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He says that the vowels point to a root not meaning \"call\" but \"happen upon\" or \"meet\" ending with a hey and not an aleph. This adds a layer of meaning absent in commentary like the Metzudat David who writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הם היו קוראים לה׳‎</p>\n<p>והוא היה עונה להם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply (though I could be wrong) that were the vowels different, i.e. with a vowel under the aleph, the word would mean something different and the placement here is intentional to point to a different meaning.</p>\n<p>I cannot see, though, how this grammatical understanding would explain the analogous nekudot choice in \"chotim\" to explain what it means.</p>\n<p>Are there any other commentators who deal with the vowel placement for either of these two words as a meaningful choice? Is there any other record of R. Hirsch applying this explanation to the other example of parallel vowels?</p>\n\n\n",

May one use the items on Shabbos?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R Yosef Kushner answers this question (pp. 60ff in his book <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/commerce-and-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Commerce and Shabbos</a>) and forbids it.</p>\n\n<p>He first explains one can complete a necessary transaction on Shabbat <strong>from a Jew</strong> if three conditions are met: one does not use the term \"buy\" or \"sell\", one makes no reference to \"paying\" or \"getting paid\" after Shabbat and one does not refer to the item by its cost or weigh during the course of the sale. As such one could take an object (after having made a previous agreement) or one could say \"I will make the necessary arrangements after Shabbat\". He notes it is important that this method should only be used when it is necessary for Shabbat or a mitzva. (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/77021/11501\">this other answer</a> for more details).</p>\n\n<p>However he notes that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to many poskim, <strong>even when the above three conditions are\n  met, one should not purchase an item from a gentile store on Shabbat.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He quotes the Rema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.500.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 500:1</a>) that even the permissible methods of purchasing on Shabbat should only be used when purchasing from a fellow Jew but not from a Gentile, and gives three reasons</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Taking an item from a Gentile store on Shabbat gives more of a sale-like appearance</li>\n<li>There is a concern the Gentile will speak out the price</li>\n<li>Many <em>poskim</em> forbid purchasing from a gentile store on Shabbat since it is considered an <em>uvda d'chol</em> as it constitutes a weekday-like activity</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(see the original at length for sources)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This would seem to be permitted - both the buying and the using - if:<br/> (1) No discussion about money happens on Shabbos <br/>\n(2) There's an Eruv that permits one to carry from the shop to one's house.<br/>\n(3) The items were within the Techum of Shabbos (about 1 Km) before Shabbos started.<br/>\n(4) The Remo in Shulchan Aruch סימן רנב adds that the items were not made on Shabbos specifically for this Jew.</p>\n\n<p>See Kitzur Shulchan Aruch סימן עג - באיזה אפן מתר לתת קודם שבת מלאכה לאינו יהודי ולהשאיל ולהשכיר לו כלים in 73:9 where he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאֵינוֹ יְהוּדִי שֶׁאֵינוֹ אֻמָּן, אֶלָּא שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ חֲנוּת שֶׁמּוֹכֵר מִנְעָלִים וְכַדּוֹמֶה, מֻתָּר לְיִשְֹרָאֵל הַמַּכִּירוֹ לִקַּח מִמֶּנּוּ בַּשַׁבָּת וּלְנָעֳלָם, וּבִלְבַד שֶׁלֹּא יִקְצֹץ עִמּוֹ דְּמֵי הַמִּקָח, וְגַם לֹא יִהְיוּ דְּבָרִים שֶׁהוּבְאוּ מִחוּץ לַתְּחוּם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There are several instances, though, where he names people as his teachers, relatives, contemporary or near contemporary rabbinic figures.

It appears that the most mentioned figures are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_ben_Yakar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov (Ben Yakar)</a>, R. Yitzchak Ben Yehuda, and R. Yitzchak Halevi, perhaps indicating that they were his primary teachers.

Judah, the head of the school of Mayence, a school\n  rendered illustrious through R. Gershom b. Judah (the \"Light of the\n  Exile\"), who may be regarded as Rashi's precursor, although he was\n  never his teacher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here are some of the passages from Rashi's commentary

And I did not see (anything) about this custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As has already been noted this point is also raised in the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3447091/jewish/Shulchan-Aruch-Chapter-299-To-Neither-Eat-Drink-Nor-Perform-Any-Work-Before-Reciting-Havdalah.htm#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch HaRav 299:20</a> as well as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.299.13.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yosef 299:13</a>.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I came across a sicha of the Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"https://asktherav.com/10884-water-after-shabbos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, Motzei Shabbos, Parshas Chukas (1979) תשל\"ט which perhaps can shed some light as to whether this practise has any relevance today, especially given the fact that the Rema says \"ולא ראיתי למנהג זה\" - \"And I did not see anything about this custom.\"</p>\n<p>In short, the sicha mentions that at first glance, the fact that the Rema says ולא ראיתי could imply that one should not do it. However, the Rebbe counters that conceivably the reason why the Rema said he never saw it was in order to prevent the women in Cracow, Poland from running immediately after barchu to draw water from springs and wells. As such, it does require further examination. He mentions that the Shulchan Aruch HaRav who came after the Rema (as mentioned above) brings this idea but does not say like the Rema that he never saw this idea explicitly. As such he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפשר לומר על זה לכאורה שזה דבר שנשאר באמיתיות, שלמנהג זה יש מקום גם היום, ולראיה מביא זאת אדמוה”ז בשו”ע שלו!</p>\n<p>It is possible to say about this, at first glance, that this (custom) remains true, that this custom has a place even today, and the proof is the fact that the (Alter) Rebbe (Rav Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav) brings it down in his own Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the Alter Rebbe made his Shulchan Aruch “השווה לכל נפש” - \"to be equal to every soul\" i.e. accessible for everyone, which would mean it is still applicable today. He continues, that if we focus on the reason behind the custom, namely that it results in a refuah (a cure) for those who need, then \"המעשה הוא העיקר\" - \"the action is the main thing\", and as such:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאשר מביאים בהלכה סיפור מעשה אז זו ראיה מוכחת שההלכה היא הלכה קיימת!</p>\n<p>When you bring a story of action into Halacha, then it is proven proof that Halacha is existing Halacha!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then qualifies the Kol Bo (the source of the custom) by saying that there it also clearly spells it out as a מעשה, an action - i.e. that a woman would go to pump water and if she delayed her husband would be upset or 'angry' as per the expression used in the Kol Bo. And out of fear of incurring her husband's wrath, the pitcher fell and broke, and the water she drew spilt out, and thus (I'm not entirely sure what this means) she really drew from Miriam's well, and her husband had a p'sak (a halachic ruling) as a result of the water splashing him. In those places where they hurt his body, they were healed with complete healing, and in the other places where the water did not reach, he remained, with his health opposite to what it was before.</p>\n<p>Explains the Rebbe, it is a matter that brings a cure and health and justifies the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.35a.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">masechata Shabbos 35a</a> that if one want to see Miriam's well he should  ascend Mount Carmel and he will see the sea of Tiveria and then a rock that resembles a sieve - and that is the well of Miriam.</p>\n<p>He continues that this Gemara is somewhat cryptic, but he reasons that is relevant to the story related in the Kol Bo. In addition, Rav Chaim Vital relates that he sailed with the Arizal in the sea of Tiveria, and the Arizal drew water when they came to a fixed place, and commanded him to drink, and said \"You drink from Miriam's well.\"</p>\n<p>As such, the Rebbe concludes that the Well of Miriam clearly works in a physical capacity, like the Kol Bo seems to suggest, which means all the more so, it works spiritually. Therefore:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מובן שברוחניות בוודאי שהמנהג קיים, ו”לא ראיתי מנהג זה” אפשר לומר רק בנוגע לגשמיות הענינים, לגשמיות המנהג</p>\n<p>It can be understood that spiritually the custom definitely exists. And \"I didn't see this custom\" (as stated by the Rema) can mean only in a physical sense of the custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And when one learns from what the Shulchan Aruch HaRav wrote on the matter, we can assume that the healing nature of Miriam's well continues every motzei Shabbos and lasts all week, allowing for a healthy week in both physicality and spirituality, as well as the study of Torah and mitzvah observance.</p>\n<p>In short, he thinks it is still very much relevant today, and there is nothing to be lost from doing it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is mentioned clearly in the mishna berura\nAnd a tap has the din of a well</p>\n\n\n",

I ask this question due to the apparent contradiction between dietary laws.</p>\n\n<p>Also, does the Tanakh ever say that gentiles can enter the world to come, or judged for their sins?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Gentiles who wish to convert to Judaism follow Noachide laws, and as they learn more gradually follow more of Mosaic laws (called <em>halacha</em>). Until they have formally converted, they are forbidden to fully observe the <em>shabbat</em> so typically transgress one law on Shabbat to respect this.</p>\n\n<p>I am not clear which contradiction in dietary laws you are referring to and it might be worth <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/posts/93354/edit\">editing</a> your question to clarify.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (one of the greatest codifiers of Jewish law) writes explicitely (MT Melachim 8:11) that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Anyone who accepts upon himself and carefully observes the Seven\n  Commandments is of the Righteous of the Nations of the World and has a\n  portion in the World to Come.</strong> This is as long as he accepts and\n  performs them because (he truly believes that) it was the Holy One,\n  Blessed Be He, Who commanded them in the Torah, and that is was\n  through Moses our Teacher we were informed that the Sons of Noah had\n  already been commanded to observe them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Anyone interested in converting should approach a rabbi and discuss the proper path to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer to your question depends on what you mean by \"convert\" to Judaism. In general, when we talk about conversion to Judaism we are referring to the process of becoming a member of the Children of Israel. Such a person is obligated to follow all of the Mosaic laws as he is considered the same as any other Jew.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have personally long distinguished between the Jewish religion and the Jewish nation. What we consider \"conversion\" nowadays involves joining the Jewish nation, which requires the observance of all 613 commandments. But one could convert to accepting the Jewish system of beliefs without actually joining the Jewish nation.</p>\n\n<p>For example, suppose a practicing Christian realized that he really doesn't believe in the Christian understanding of God, but actually the Jewish understanding seems right. He does some studying and realizes the truth of the Torah and the Jewish religion. There is no requirement that this person join the Jewish nation and follow all 613 commandments. Instead, he could choose to remain a gentile and follow the seven Noachide laws, and he would be fulfilling everything that is expected of him. According to Rambam, such a person would merit entering the world to come.

A <em>tashmish kedusha</em> may not be discarded and must be buried (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/tags/genizah-storage/info\"><em>genizah</em></a>) (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x535\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 154:3</a>, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6797\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 282:12</a>). Placing a cloth over the table ensures that the table (even if the table was designated for this use, such as the <em>bimah</em> in <em>shul</em>), will only be a <em>tashmish d'tashmish</em>, and permitted to be discarded (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=26b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 26b</a>), while the cloth (if designated for this use) will become a <em>tashmish kedusha</em> (see Rashi <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=26b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 26b</a>, Taz <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6797\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 282:9</a>).

A Jew of acceptable repute must check the knife\n  and afterwards give it to this apostate to slaughter with, for it can\n  be presumed that he will not trouble himself to check [the knife].</p>\n  \n  <p>If, by contrast, he was an apostate because of worship of false\n  deities, one who violates the Sabbath in public, <strong>or a heretic who\n  denies the Torah and [the prophecy of] Moses our teacher, as we\n  explained in Hilchot Teshuvah, he is considered as a gentile and [an\n  animal] he slaughters is a nevelah</strong>.

Yet a mere two halachot later he writes:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&hilchos=29&perek=4&halocha=16&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Shechitah 4:16</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלו הצדוקין והבייתוסין ותלמידיהן וכל הטועים אחריהן שאינן מאמינים בתורה\n  שבעל פה שחיטתן אסורה ואם שחטו בפנינו הרי זו מותרת שאין איסור שחיטתן\n  אלא שמא יקלקלו והם אינן מאמינין בתורת השחיטה לפיכך אינן נאמנין לומר לא\n  קלקלנו</p>\n  \n  <p>These Tzadukkim, Beotosim, their disciples and all that err, following\n  their path, who do not believe in the Oral Law - their slaughter is\n  forbidden. If, however, they slaughtered [an animal] in our presence,\n  it is permitted. For their slaughter is forbidden only because it is\n  possible they blunder. Since they do not believe in the laws of ritual\n  slaughter, we do not accept their word when they say, \"We did not\n  blunder.\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/971830/jewish/Shechitah-Chapter-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he clearly states that the slaughter of those who deny the Oral Law like the Sadducees and Boethusians is in fact valid, provided we know they slaughtered correctly. This implies that such people are not heretics, for if they were then their slaughter would be invalid as per halacha 14.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, in a responsum Rambam writes:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shu\"t HaRambam 1:20 (Machon Yerushalayim edition)</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואותם הקראין אינם אלה שקורין אותם החכמים מינים אבל יקראו אותם צדוקין\n  וביתוסין להוציא הכותים והמינים הם אשר נתחלפו להם עיקרי תורתינו ומכללם\n  האומר אין תורה מן השמים</p>\n  \n  <p>And those Karaites are not those that the sages called sectarians.\n  Rather they called them Sadducees and Boethusians, to exclude\n  Cuthians. The sectarians are those that have exchanged the\n  fundamentals of our Torah, and included among them is one who says\n  that the Torah is not from Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here he seems to be clearly saying that they are not considered as having exchanged the fundamentals of our Torah, unlike those who deny the Divine origin of the Torah, yet in Hilchot Teshuvah he put both in the same category of \"deniers of the Torah\".</p>\n\n<p>How can we reconcile these statements of Rambam? Are those who deny the Oral Law heretics or not? Or is there some middle ground that can address this?</p>\n\n\n",

Actually, there are 6 verses that start at the top of the column, though the 1st one, is the first verse of the Torah, so that's easy to do. I learned last week that a Torah need not be written in sequential order.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious what <em>sofrim</em> do to assure that verses like these happen this way. Do they begin writing each of the 6 verses first at the top of a column, perhaps at the start of a new piece of parchment, and then write the rest of the Torah to \"fit in\" to these verses? How do they accomplish this \"feat\"? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Everyone nowadays uses a pre-printed layout of the whole Torah where whoever designed that PDF thought it through on the computer and made it work.</p>\n\n<p>Historically, you could copy from a Torah scroll that had it worked out if you were lucky enough to have one, stretch/shrink letters and/or column widths to get it to work out, or skip out on this custom.</p>\n\n<p>Many, many Poskim opposed the second method (see Rama YD 273:6) though it was still quite commonly practiced.</p>\n\n<p>R.

These Tikun Sofrim were arranged by expert sofrim to conform with many rules, not just the ב*\"ה שמ\"ו rule mentioned in the question. They\"ve been around for many years,even before the computer age.</p>\n<p>2 - Each column has 60 \"spaces\" per line. A space would be the size of a Yud, so an Alef would take up three spaces. At the beginning of each line there two letters, indicating how many \"letters\" are actually written on that line.  י\"ג would mean יתר ג, there are three extra spaces needed for all these letters, so squeeze the letters a little.  ח\"ב would mean חסר ב, there are two letter spaces that are actually not needed, so space out the letters more.  ש\"ת means that there are exactly 60 letters.  Spaces between words count as a \"letter\". [See attached Megillas  Esther.]</p>\n<p>3 - I know of an old Sefer Torah (written without a tikun), where the sofer \"messed up\", and realized he needed to get הבאים before אז ישיר as the first word on the column a little too late. He stretched out the letters להאדר\"ת in the column before אז ישיר to get הבאים in the correct place. It is kosher, however nowadays many would question any sofer that writes without a tikun.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q9mA7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Q9mA7.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

I could have sworn that the Braisa said that the snake <em>pushed Chavah</em> into the tree, rather than touching it itself.

It is derived from this verse, as it is stated with regard to teruma of the tithe: “And you shall give the teruma of the Lord to Aaron the priest” (Numbers 18:28). And does Aaron exist forever so that one can fulfill the mitzva by giving him the teruma of the tithe? But is it not so that Aaron did not enter Eretz Yisrael, the only place where the people would give him teruma? Rather, the verse teaches that Aaron is destined to live in the future and the Jewish people will give him teruma. From here it is derived that the resurrection of the dead is from the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.90b.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Further on the same page</a> (2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא ר' סימאי אומר מניין לתחיית המתים מן התורה שנאמר (שמות ו, ד) וגם הקימותי את בריתי אתם לתת להם את ארץ כנען לכם לא נאמר אלא להם מכאן לתחיית המתים מן התורה</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Simai says: From where is resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated with regard to the Patriarchs: “I have also established My covenant with them to give to them the land of Canaan” (Exodus 6:4). The phrase: To give to you the land of Canaan, is not stated, as the meaning of the verse is not that God fulfilled the covenant with the Patriarchs when he gave the land of Canaan to the children of Israel; rather, it is stated: “To give to them the land of Canaan,” meaning to the Patriarchs themselves. From here is it derived that the resurrection of the dead is from the Torah, as in the future the Patriarchs will come to life and inherit the land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.90b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And immediately following</a> (3–7):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלו מינין את רבן גמליאל מניין שהקדוש ברוך הוא מחיה מתים אמר להם מן התורה ומן הנביאים ומן הכתובים ולא קיבלו ממנו</p>\n<p>Heretics asked Rabban Gamliel: From where is it derived that the Holy One, Blessed be He, revives the dead? Rabban Gamliel said to them that this matter can be proven from the Torah, from the Prophets, and from Writings, but they did not accept the proofs from him.</p>\n<p>מן התורה דכתיב (דברים לא, טז) ויאמר ה' אל משה הנך שוכב עם אבותיך וקם אמרו לו ודילמא וקם העם הזה וזנה</p>\n<p>The proof from the Torah is as it is written: “And the Lord said to Moses, behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise” (Deuteronomy 31:16). The heretics said to him: But perhaps the verse should be divided in a different manner, and it should be read: “Behold, you shall lie with your fathers, and this people will arise and stray after the foreign gods of the land.”</p>\n<p>מן הנביאים דכתיב (ישעיהו כו, יט) יחיו מתיך נבלתי יקומון הקיצו ורננו שוכני עפר כי טל אורות טלך וארץ רפאים תפיל ודילמא מתים שהחיה יחזקאל</p>\n<p>The proof from the Prophets is as it is written: “Your dead shall live, my corpse shall arise. Awake and sing, you that dwell in the dust, for your dew is as the dew of vegetation, and the land shall cast out the dead” (Isaiah 26:19). The heretics said to him: But perhaps the prophecy was fulfilled with the dead that Ezekiel revived. No proof may be cited from that verse with regard to any future resurrection.</p>\n<p>מן הכתובים דכתיב (שיר השירים ז, י) וחכך כיין הטוב הולך לדודי למישרים דובב שפתי ישנים ודילמא רחושי מרחשן שפוותיה בעלמא כר' יוחנן דאמר ר' יוחנן משום ר\"ש בן יהוצדק כל מי שנאמרה הלכה בשמו בעולם הזה שפתותיו דובבות בקבר שנאמר דובב שפתי ישנים</p>\n<p>The proof from Writings is as it is written: “And your palate is like the best wine that glides down smoothly for my beloved, moving gently the lips of those that sleep” (Song of Songs 7:10), indicating that the dead will ultimately rise and speak. The heretics said to him: But perhaps merely their lips will move, in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan, as Rabbi Yoḥanan says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Yehotzadak: Anyone in whose name a halakha is stated in this world, his lips move in the grave as if repeating the statement cited in his name, as it is stated: “Moving gently the lips of those that sleep.” No proof may be cited from that verse, as it is unrelated to resurrection.</p>\n<p>עד שאמר להם מקרא זה (דברים יא, כא) אשר נשבע ה' לאבותיכם לתת להם לכם לא נאמר אלא להם מיכן לתחיית המתים מן התורה</p>\n<p>This exchange continued until Rabban Gamliel stated to them this verse: “That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land that the Lord took an oath to your forefathers to give them” (Deuteronomy 11:21). The phrase: To give you, is not stated; rather, it is stated: “To give them,” to the Patriarchs themselves, as in the future the Patriarchs will come to life and inherit the land. From here resurrection of the dead is derived from the Torah.</p>\n<p>וי\"א מן המקרא הזה אמר להם (דברים ד, ד) ואתם הדבקים בה' אלהיכם חיים כלכם היום (פשיטא דחיים כולכם היום אלא אפילו ביום שכל העולם כולם מתים אתם חיים) מה היום כולכם קיימין אף לעוה\"ב כולכם קיימין</p>\n<p>And there are those who say that it is from this following verse that he said to them his ultimate proof: “But you who cleave to the Lord your God every one of you is alive this day” (Deuteronomy 4:4). Wasn’t it obvious with regard to the children of Israel whom God was addressing, that “every one of you is alive this day”? Rather, the meaning of the verse is: Even on the day when everyone is dead you will live; just as today every one of you is alive, so too, in the World-to-Come every one of you will be alive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.90b.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The gemara then repeats one of the sources in a different context</a> (3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלו רומיים את רבי יהושע בן חנניה מניין שהקב\"ה מחיה מתים ויודע מה שעתיד להיות אמר להו תרווייהו מן המקרא הזה שנאמר (דברים לא, טז) ויאמר ה' אל משה הנך שוכב עם אבותיך וקם העם הזה וזנה</p>\n<p>The Romans asked Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya: From where is it derived that the Holy One, Blessed be He, revives the dead, and from where is it derived that He knows what is destined to be? Rabbi Yehoshua ben Ḥananya said to them: Both of those matters are derived from this verse, as it is stated: “And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, you shall lie with your fathers and arise; this people will go astray” (Deuteronomy 31:16). This indicates that Moses will die and then arise from the dead and that the Holy One, Blessed be He, knows what the children of Israel are destined to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.90b.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And further on the same page</a> (8):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא א\"ר אליעזר בר' יוסי בדבר זה זייפתי ספרי מינים שהיו אומרים אין תחיית המתים מן התורה אמרתי להן זייפתם תורתכם ולא העליתם בידכם כלום שאתם אומרים אין תחיית המתים מן התורה הרי הוא אומר (במדבר טו, לא) הכרת תכרת הנפש ההיא עונה בה הכרת תכרת בעולם הזה עונה בה לאימת לאו לעולם הבא</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Eliezer, son of Rabbi Yosei, says: With this following matter, I refuted the books of the Samaritans, as they would say that there is no source for the resurrection of the dead from the Torah. I said to them: You falsified your torah and you accomplished nothing, as you say there is no source for the resurrection of the dead from the Torah, and the Torah states: “That soul shall be excised; his iniquity shall be upon him” (Numbers 15:31). You interpret the phrase “that soul shall be excised” to mean that a sinner will be punished with death in this world. If so, with regard to the phrase “his iniquity shall be upon him,” for when is that destined to be? Is it not for the World-to-Come, i.e., the world as it will exist after the resurrection of the dead? Apparently, there is a World-to-Come and there is an allusion to it in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.90b.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Further on this page we have another source brought</a> (9), intriguingly attributed to Queen Cleopatra rather than to one of the sages:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלה קליאופטרא מלכתא את רבי מאיר אמרה ידענא דחיי שכבי דכתיב ויציצו מעיר כעשב הארץ אלא כשהן עומדין עומדין ערומין או בלבושיהן עומדין</p>\n<p>The Gemara relates: Queen Cleopatra asked Rabbi Meir a question. She said: I know that the dead will live, as it is written: “And may they blossom out of the city like grass of the earth” (Psalms 72:16). Just as grass grows, so too, the dead will come to life. But when they arise, will they arise naked or will they arise with their garments?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.91b.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Then on 91b we have</a> (10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבא רמי כתיב (דברים לב, לט) אני אמית ואחיה וכתיב (דברים לב, לט) מחצתי ואני ארפא אמר הקב\"ה מה שאני ממית אני מחיה והדר מה שמחצתי ואני ארפא ת\"ר אני אמית ואחיה יכול שתהא מיתה באחד וחיים באחד כדרך שהעולם נוהג ת\"ל מחצתי ואני ארפא מה מחיצה ורפואה באחד אף מיתה וחיים באחד מיכן תשובה לאומרין אין תחיית המתים מן התורה</p>\n<p>Rava raises a contradiction. It is written: “I will kill and I will bring to life” (Deuteronomy 32:39), indicating that God is capable of reviving the dead. And it is written immediately afterward: “I wounded and I will heal,” which indicates that God will only heal the wounded. Rather, it should be understood: The Holy One, Blessed be He, is saying: What I kill, I bring to life, indicating that God revives the dead. And then what I wounded, I will heal.</p>\n<p>The Sages taught in a baraita with regard to the verse: “I will kill and I will bring to life.” One might have thought that it means that there will be death for one person and life for one other person, in the typical manner that the world operates. Therefore, the verse states: “I wounded and I will heal.” Just as wounding and healing take place in one person, so too, death and bringing back to life take place in one person. From here there is a response to those who say that there is no resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.91b.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Followed by</a> (11–12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא אמר רבי מאיר מניין לתחיית המתים מן התורה שנאמר (שמות טו, א) אז ישיר משה ובני ישראל את השירה הזאת לה' שר לא נאמר אלא ישיר מכאן לתחיית המתים מן התורה כיוצא בדבר אתה אומר (יהושע ח, ל) אז יבנה יהושע מזבח לה' בנה לא נאמר אלא יבנה מכאן לתחיית המתים מן התורה</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Meir said: From where is resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: “Then Moses and the children of Israel will sing this song to the Lord” (Exodus 15:1). It is not stated: Sang, in the verse; rather, the term “they will sing” is stated, indicating that Moses will come back to life and sing the song in the future. From here it is proved that resurrection of the dead is derived from the Torah. On a similar note, you can say: “Then Joshua will build an altar to the Lord God of Israel on Mount Ebal” (Joshua 8:30). It is not stated: Built, in the verse; rather, the term “will build” is stated. From here, resurrection of the dead is derived from the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.91b.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A little later we have</a> (13):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר יהושע בן לוי מניין לתחיית המתים מן התורה שנאמר (תהלים פד, ה) אשרי יושבי ביתך עוד יהללוך סלה היללוך לא נאמר אלא יהללוך מכאן לתחיית המתים מן התורה וא\"ר יהושע בן לוי כל האומר שירה בעוה\"ז זוכה ואומרה לעולם הבא שנאמר אשרי יושבי ביתך עוד יהללוך סלה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: From where is resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: “Happy are they who dwell in Your house; they will yet praise You, Selah” (Psalms 84:5). It is not stated: They praised you, in the verse; rather, the term “they will praise you” is stated. From here, resurrection of the dead is derived from the Torah. And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says: Anyone who recites song to God in this world is privileged and recites it in the World-to-Come, as it is stated: “Happy are they who dwell in Your house; they will yet praise You, Selah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.91b.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And</a> (14):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר חייא בר אבא א\"ר יוחנן מניין לתחיית המתים מן התורה שנאמר (ישעיהו נב, ח) קול צופיך נשאו קול יחדו ירננו וגו' ריננו לא נאמר אלא ירננו מכאן לתחיית המתים מן התורה וא\"ר חייא בר אבא א\"ר יוחנן עתידין כל הנביאים כולן אומרים שירה בקול אחד שנאמר קול צופיך נשאו קול יחדו ירננו</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says: From where is resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: “Your watchmen, they raise the voice; together shall they sing, for they shall see eye to eye the Lord returning to Zion” (Isaiah 52:8). It is not stated: They sang, in the verse; rather, the term “together shall they sing” is stated. From here resurrection of the dead is derived from the Torah. And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba says that Rabbi Yoḥanan says: All the prophets are all destined to recite song in one voice, as it is stated: “Your watchmen, they raise the voice; together shall they sing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.92a.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On 92a we find</a> (15–17):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבא מניין לתחיית המתים מן התורה שנאמר (דברים לג, ו) יחי ראובן ואל ימות יחי ראובן בעולם הזה ואל ימות לעולם הבא רבינא אמר מהכא (דניאל יב, ב) ורבים מישני אדמת עפר יקיצו אלה לחיי עולם ואלה לחרפות לדראון עולם רב אשי אמר מהכא (דניאל יב, יג) ואתה לך [לקץ] ותנוח ותעמוד לגורלך לקץ הימין</p>\n<p>Rava says: From where is resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah? It is derived from a verse, as it is stated: “Let Reuben live and not die, in that his men become few” (Deuteronomy 33:6). This is interpreted: “Let Reuben live” in this world “and not die” in the World-to-Come. Ravina says that resurrection is derived from here: “And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awaken, some to everlasting life, and some to reproaches and everlasting disgrace” (Daniel 12:2). Rav Ashi says proof is derived from here: “But go you your way until the end be; and you shall rest, and arise to your lot at the end of days” (Daniel 12:13).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.92a.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Finally, further on the page</a> (18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' טבי אמר ר' יאשיה מאי דכתיב (משלי ל, טז) שאול ועוצר רחם ארץ לא שבעה מים וכי מה ענין שאול אצל רחם אלא לומר לך מה רחם מכניס ומוציא אף שאול מכניס ומוציא והלא דברים קל וחומר ומה רחם שמכניסין בו בחשאי מוציאין ממנו בקולי קולות שאול שמכניסין בו בקולות אינו דין שמוציאין ממנו בקולי קולות מיכן תשובה לאומרין אין תחיית המתים מן התורה</p>\n<p>Rabbi Tavi says that Rabbi Yoshiya says: What is the meaning of that which is written: “There are three that are never satisfied…the grave, and the barren womb, and earth that does not receive sufficient water” (Proverbs 30:15–16)? And what does a grave have to do with a womb? Rather, they are juxtaposed to say to you: Just as a womb takes in and gives forth, so too a grave takes in and also gives forth, with the resurrection of the dead.</p>\n<p>And are these matters not inferred a fortiori: If with regard to a womb, into which one introduces the embryo in secret, one removes the baby from it accompanied by the loud sounds of the woman crying out during childbirth, then with regard to the grave, into which one introduces the corpse with sounds of wailing and mourning the dead, is it not right that one removes from it the resurrected dead accompanied by the loud sounds of the resurrected multitudes? From here there is a response to those who say: There is no resurrection of the dead derived from the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Daniel 12/2</p>\n\n<p><strong>ורבים מישני אדמת־עפר יקיצו</strong> אלה לחיי עולם ואלה לחרפות לדראון עולם </p>\n\n<p><strong>Many of those that sleep in the dust of the earth will awake</strong>, some to eternal life, others to reproaches, to everlasting abhorrence.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi :<strong>ורבים מישני אדמת עפר יקיצו</strong>. יחיו המתים</p>\n\n<p>If you want one from the Chumash, then there is a hint brought in Rasi on אז ישיר:</p>\n\n<p>אז ישיר משה THEN SANG MOSES — with regard to the usage of the future ישיר,...

(See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/72937/501\">here</a> for the origins of Perek Shira.)</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, the person says (to himself and Hashem) \"I will say Perek Shira for 40 days so that in the merit of doing so <em>I will get engaged/cured/whatever is bothering  me</em> and if my prayers are answered I will publicize this\".</p>\n\n<p>Where does this concept come from of promising to publically publicize one's redemption - <strong>and how it was done</strong> -  if one is redeemed after doing something?</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas, hints, stories and even sources are welcome.</p>\n\n<p>(I think the concept of publicising a redemption per se can be easily sourced.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I also live in Jerusalem, and I was also young once, and in the beginning of my Teshyvah I desperately needed a fast and a sure cure for my Shlom Bays problems (also triggered by Teshuvah). As you mentioned, the Haredi neighborhoods in Jerusalem are full of promising publications: just give some Tzedokeh, daven at the W.Wall etc, so I asked my Rabbi Z\"L which one should I do to seek my eternal redemption!</p>\n\n<p>And he said: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"You sound like a poor needy man that needs a medicine but does not have money to pay the doctor.

(e.g., an insurance claim that was paid, a second doctor that would have confirmed it?) or is it all in the eyes of the client?</p>\n\n<p>Assume everyone is Jewish if that makes a difference. And I'm of course interested in halachic sources vs. only personal opinions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Short answer: it probably was Lashon Hora.</p>\n\n<p>Long answer: this is very subjective, and very much depends on the specific details of each case. There's a big difference between the extremes on one end where 'this person literally stabs every one of his customers' and the other end of 'he fixed our A/C and it was supposed to last for ten years but broke after only nine and a half'. Most cases lie somewhere in the middle, upon which every detail of the situation could change the Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim gives 7 rules for when speaking Lashon Hora is permitted (in Hilchos Lashon Hora 10:1-2, translation from the <a href=\"https://seferchofetzchaim.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/dcompanion-the-seven-rules-of-toeles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first result when I searched 'loshon hora rules of toelet'</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>One must be absolutely certain that the information is accurate. Either one had to have witnessed the incident himself, or he investigated the report and found it to be accurate. If one has second-hand negative information which he wishes to relate for a constructive purpose, he must make it clear that his words are based on hearsay.</p></li>\n  <li><p>One must think the matter through and be sure that a wrong has actually been committed. Sometimes, what one may think is a\n  misdeed may in fact be permitted by halachah. One must be certain that\n  his information and his interpretation of the information are correct\n  before the information can be related.</p></li>\n  <li><p>One must first approach the wrongdoer and attempt to persuade him to rectify his behavior. For example: A storekeeper was\n  seen cheating a customer. The first step would be to speak to the\n  storekeeper and try to persuade him to return the money. Only after\n  this fails should one consider informing the customer that he was\n  cheated.</p></li>\n  <li><p>One is not permitted to exaggerate in any way. This can be especially difficult in a situation where one is relating information\n  regarding an emotional issue.</p></li>\n  <li><p>One’s intention must be solely to help the person who is being victimized. If one harbors any ill will toward the subject of\n  the report, then he is not permitted to relate it for a constructive\n  reason. (Of course, one should make every effort to rid oneself of\n  such ill will.) For example, for a storekeeper to tell a potential\n  customer about his competitor’s wrongdoing would have the likely\n  effect of drawing this customer into his own store. In that case, the\n  discussion would be forbidden. In a case where one has constructive\n  negative information to relate but feels that he has a personal\n  interest in the matter, it would be advisable for him to consult a rav\n  (rabbi).</p></li>\n  <li><p>If one can effect the same result without speaking loshon hora, then he must use that option. If one wants to warn a friend not\n  to shop in a certain store because of the proprietor’s dishonesty, and\n  there is a way to convince him to shop elsewhere without speaking\n  badly of the proprietor, then that option must be used.</p></li>\n  <li><p>One is not allowed to convey the information if this will result in the subject suffering a greater loss than the halachah\n  allows.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The specific (albeit quite vague) situation mentioned in the question likely violates several of these precepts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Number 6 is likely violated. Many situations could be resolved with something along the lines of 'X is a good option' as opposed to 'Y is a bad option'.</li>\n<li>Number 7 is likely violated. It's unlikely that everyone in the group needs to be aware of the information, and the fact that it's something that might be of use in a vague manner some time in the future likely spills over in to the realm of an innapropriate damage to the service provider.</li>\n<li>Number 5 is probably violated too. The person relaying the information was personally affected in a negative manner by the service provider, so he likely has ill will towards him.</li>\n<li>(Number 2 may have been violated, but that can't really be known without a thorough understanding of the situation and the person relaying the information. In most situations, there are two sides to every story, and the person relaying the information likely only shared his own side. Number 4 is also something that may have been violated, but that as well depends on the details)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>And in closing, I want to stress again that every case is different and the rules of Toelet are very fluid construct where every detail can affect what the practical Halacha is. However, the Chafetz Chaim gave a pretty comprehensive set of rules, and they can often be applied to a large range of cases with a bit of thought.</p>\n\n\n",

And, if he's taking that risk, does that mean that any negative comments that might harm him may be permitted and therefore not considered <em>lashon hara</em> since, in a sense, he allowed such comments?

R Chaim Navon <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/shiur-07-mechitza\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here the solid, unequivocal and consistent custom in all Jewish\n  communities is that <strong>there should be a mechitza in the synagogue during\n  prayer times</strong>. Jewish prayer is conducted in the framework of total\n  separation between men and women. No halakhic authority challenges the\n  obligation to have a mechitza.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Daniel Mann at Eretz Hemda <a href=\"https://eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=4&cat=1&newsletter=1375&article=5211\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>It is agreed that regarding davening in a place that is not\n  set for tefilla, the formal requirement of mechitza per se does not\n  exist.</strong> This is more obvious in a public place, like a plane. The need\n  for a mechitza is more of an obligation to put one in the proper place\n  than a prohibition to daven without it. Therefore, since there is no\n  way to expect an airline servicing Jews and non-Jews to put up a\n  mechitza, there is no problem. Even in places like sheva berachot and\n  a shiva house, there is not a formal need for a mechitza (see Igrot\n  Moshe OC I:39 and V:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He specifically writes that a <em>shul</em> itself elevates the level of sanctity and requires a mechitza but sees a <em>kula</em> if only one or two women are there</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If men are davening in a shul at a time when there is no minyan, it\n  would seem that a mechitza is needed if women are present (<strong>one or two\n  women are likely not a problem</strong> (see ibid.; Ishei Yisrael 9:28)). After\n  all, they are davening and the shul has sanctity that elevates tefilla\n  even without a minyan (see Shulchan Aruch, OC 90:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(see at the end there for further guidelines)</p>\n\n<p>R Chaim Navon <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/shiur-07-mechitza\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> quotes R Moshe Feinstein that a mechitza is there to prevent mingling, not visual separation. As such it is possible that a very large room would not require a mechitza if women are far enough that distance prevents mingling.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The mechitza in the Temple was meant to prevent mingling that involves\n  levity, and not necessarily visual separation. So too writes the\n  Rambam (cited above) regarding the need for a balcony in the Temple:\n  “So that they would not mingle.” Rav Feinstein therefore rules that a\n  shoulder-height mechitza suffices, as it provides enough separation to\n  prevent the mingling of men and women during the prayer service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Finally R Yehuda Henkin in <a href=\"http://a.co/1P4i4ph\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Responsa on Contemporary Jewish Women's Issues</a> p. 124 <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1QAZVzTJz2MC&lpg=PA99&pg=PA124#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Outside of a synagogue a <em>mechitza</em> is mandatory when two conditions\n  are met: first both the men and the women intend to participate in the\n  prayers, and second, the place is being used at the time solely for\n  prayer [...] where these conditions do not apply, a <em>mechitzah</em> is not\n  required. For this reason no <em>mechitzah</em> is required in a wedding hall\n  when a <em>minyan</em> of men gather in one corner, both because the women do\n  not participate and the hall is not being used exclusively for prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So to answer your questions</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is this only in a shul (synagogue) or anywhere men are praying?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Only in a <em>shul</em><br><br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there a minimum amount of women present to require a mechitza?<br>\n  If there is a large shul with one woman present, may the men daven there, or must she leave first?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to R Mann, one woman is not an issue assuming she doesn't mingle with the men.<br><br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there any distance criteria?<br>\n  If the shul is very large, and the men are only way up-front and there are a few women all the way in the back, is that ok?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to R Navon and R Henkin it should be OK, if there is no mingling, the women do not participate in the prayer and the place is not used only for prayer at that time.<br><br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a public area, like in an airport or at a wedding hall, must there be no woman at all in the whole room in order for the men to be allowed to daven?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we have seen, this is not a requirement.

The mistake was either a <em>shidduch</em> he broke or a <em>shidduch</em> he allowed to be broken.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the thirteenth of Menachem Av, 5589, Rabbi <a href=\"http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Banet_Mordekhai_ben_Avraham\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mordechai Banet</a> ztvk\"l,\n  the Chief Rabbi of Nikohlsburgh, passed away. Since it was during the\n  summer months, he was at the baths in Karlebad when he died, and he\n  was buried in the town of Lichtenshtatt, which was nearby. <strong>When the\n  community of Nikohlsburgh heard of the tragedy which had befallen\n  them, they insisted that their great Rabbi be moved to their town\n  immediately, to be buried in honor in the grave of his ancestors.</strong>\n  However, the community of Lichtenshtatt argued that they had been\n  privileged to receive the Holy Rabbi's body and it should remain by\n  them. The dispute was brought before the greatest Rabbis of the\n  generation, including the Chasam Sofer, who said that it would be\n  permissible to move the grave, but did not rule decisively what to do.</p>\n  \n  <p>About six months later, the Chasam Sofer dealt with the issue again\n  and this time he wrote to the Judges of Nikohlsburgh that now he had\n  definitely decided that they should move their Rabbi back to their\n  town and bury him there. That is exactly what they did and he was\n  buried there with honors on the twelfth of Adar, 5590.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the version that is recorded in the book Chut Hameshulash\n  where it is explained that Rabbi Banet came to the Chasam Sofer in a\n  dream and asked him to allow them to move his body to Nikohlsburgh. He\n  revealed that when he was a bachur (an unmarried boy) he was engaged\n  to the daughter of the Rabbi of Lichtenshtatt and he broke the\n  shidduch, causing shame to the family of his betrothed. Therefore, he\n  was punished that for half a year he would have to lie in their\n  cemetery, far from his home town and from the graves of his ancestors.\n  However, his penalty was over now and therefore he requested that the\n  Chasam Sofer see to it that he be returned home where he belonged.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the author of the book Pe'er Mordechai, who wrote the\n  biography of Rabbi Mordechai Banet, argues that the Rabbi never broke\n  a shidduch in his life. He maintains that there is a mistake in the\n  way the story is written in the Chut Hameshulash and brings another\n  version from the son of the Chasam Sofer who heard it from his father.</p>\n  \n  <p>He told that even the first time the Chasam Sofer dealt with the\n  question, he wrote that they are obligated to return the body to\n  Nikohlsburgh. However, before he could send his decision away, he fell\n  asleep and Rabbi Banet came to him in a dream and asked him to delay\n  his ruling for a while. He explained that he is being punished and\n  must be buried in Lichtenshtatt for half a year because he once gave\n  someone permission to break a shidduch. The Rabbi stressed that\n  \"although my decision was correct according to the Torah,\n  nevertheless, since people's honor is a very serious matter and I\n  caused pain and embarrassment to the girl and her family, therefore I\n  am being punished!\" In order to prove that his words were true, Rabbi\n  Banet told the Chasam Sofer that they can check and see that the\n  betrothed girl is buried right next to the grave where he is lying\n  now. The Chasam Sofer did so and found his words to be true. Therefore\n  he waited six months before having the Rabbi's body returned home.</p>\n  \n  <p>We must learn from this how careful we must be never to cause pain or\n  embarrassment to anyone, even if he or she deserves it. Then we will\n  be truly happy in this world and in the World-to-Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The story is told elsewhere incl. <a href=\"http://www.mishpacha.com/Browse/Article/6295/The-Hidden-World-of-Shidduchim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> quoting the <em>sefer</em> Siach Nechamah by Rav Chaim Kanievsky, page 192.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As to the halachic permissibility of the re-interment, dinonline notes <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/07/01/disinterment-of-graves-a-grave-concern/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> it is permissible if the person is being relocated to the Land of Israel, or to the family burial plot (kever avos) (but see Igrot Moshe YD 3:153 who writes that decisions of relocation the grave can only be taken by the children of the deceased, and not by the general Jewish community).</p>\n\n<p>The Sridei Eish writes (vol. 2, no. 100) the highest halachic authorities gave their permission to move R Banet's remains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The removal of bones from one gravesite to another … is a matter that\n  our rabbis and decisors in all generations have treated with great\n  severity, for we find that Chazal were very insistent on the proper\n  respect to be paid to the dead…. And therefore we observe that time\n  after time when a question concerning the disinterment of bones came\n  before the great masters, they would apply themselves to this halachah\n  with great gravity and seriousness, and they would preoccupy\n  themselves in the clarification and meticulous examination of all\n  possibilities, and they would not rush to permit even under\n  circumstances where the basis for leniency was clear and obvious. <strong>It\n  is well known how the gedolei hador were filled with fear and\n  trepidation when they had to decide whether to permit the disinterment\n  of the pure body of the Gaon Rabbi Mordechai Benet from Lichtenstaut\n  to Prague.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For further analysis, you could search for the the <em>tshuva</em> from the Seridei Eish or look for the relevant <em>tshuva</em> from the Hatam Sofer.

If you are placing it on a bimah, then you will need to adjust your measurements based on the bimah's dimensions.</li>\n<li>For the sides, mainly, allow enough room for the <em>gabbaim</em> to stand comfortably between the side of the shulchan and the railing or end of the bimah. It sounds crazy, but I have seen bimot that had steps and the spacing was so narrow that people almost fell down the steps!</li>\n<li>For the width, i.e., the area where you will lay down the Torah, I recommend that you take out the largest Torah that you would use <em>ever</em> on any occasion of the year. Lay it on a regular table and open it up as if you were about to do <em>hagbah</em> (I think it's about 3 - 5 columns.) That will tell you the width and height that you need. I would allow an extra few inches on both dimensions to have some leeway.</li>\n<li>For the height - If you have a regular paid <em>ba'al Kri'ah</em>, get a table, and have him read / look at a Torah. If he has to bend over to read, then it's an indication that you need to make it higher. Trust me - bending down while you're reading <em>Matot-Mas'ei</em> is hard on the back. Reading Megillah, esp. if you have long <em>Haman</em> breaks is even longer!</li>\n<li>For the angle - fairly simple rule. If an average siddur starts to slide or a pen rolls very quickly, your angle is too steep.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A minor additional factor that you may want to consider is having ample storage space depending on what you wish to store under the shulchan top. Most shuls store a few <em>siddurim</em> and a <em>haftarah</em> book and perhaps a few tallitot. Those don't require much space. However, my shul stores bottles of wine for <em>Kiddush</em> (yes, it's aged and awful, too), so if you'll be doing that or something similar, you'll need more room, and, that may increase the shulchan's height.</p>\n\n\n",

The prohibition covers all types of food-producing plants: herbs, vegetables, grains, trees.

The word “asher” is an allusion to the fact that that the Holy\n  One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Your strength is true [yishar\n  koḥakha] in that you broke the tablets, as the breaking of the first\n  tablets led to the foundation of the Torah through the giving of the\n  second tablets.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this we learn that sometimes breaking off from the study of Torah for the purpose of improved learning in the future, is considered a fundamental part of Torah learning itself.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the Schar (reward) see Rashi (ibid):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שביטולה של תורה - כגון שמבטל תורה להוצאת המת ולהכנסת כלה זהו יסודה\n  כלומר <strong>מקבל שכר כאילו יושב ומייסדה ועוסק בה</strong> שנאמר אשר שברת ולא אמר\n  ליה בלשון כעס שמע מינה הסכימה עמו דעת השכינה כשביטל תורה ושיברן כיון\n  דנתכוין לטובה:</p>\n  \n  <p>For the withdrawal of Torah - for example one who withdraws from\n  learning Torah to escort the deceased and for ushering in the bride\n  this is the foundation of Torah meaning to say <strong>he receives reward as\n  if he is sitting and learning</strong> as it says that you have broken and it\n  does not say it with anger implicating that G-d agreed with his action\n  when he eliminated Torah when breaking the tablets since he intended\n  for the good:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So not only is there no problem with doing so, but even during the time when he is not learning he receives reward as if he is sitting and learning</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# At what stage of Joshua's leadership did he become Judge?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Seder Olam states that Joshua was a judge over Israel for <strong>28 years.</strong> (Seder Olam 12) We know that he succeeded Moses 40 years after leaving Egypt (Joshua 1:1), and that he died at the age of 110. (Joshua 24:29) So, that makes him 42 years old at the time of the Exodus. (110 – 28 – 40 = 42)</p>\n\n<p>However, Numbers 11:28 describes Joshua as a ‘youth’ when he started as Moses assistant, so I suspect that his ‘judgeship’ is deemed to have begun at a point later than the invasion of Canaan.  </p>\n\n<p>My question therefore is, at what stage of Joshua's leadership did Joshua actually become Judge?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<h1>Why this must be wrong</h1>\n<p>The Gemara Zevachim 118b derives from Kalev’s statement that he was 40 when he was a spy (Joshua 14:7), 85 when he said those words (v. 10), and 78 when they crossed the Jordan (40+38=78) that the Jews fought for 7 years (85-78). Based on a complicated algebra regarding when the Temple was destroyed (which comes from Seder Olam itself) or a comparison to the fighting, the Gemara concludes that they took 7 years to settle as well. As such, the 28 yers mentioned here <em>must</em> overlap Moses’ leadership - there were only 14 years after Moses died.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I suspect that you’re reading a corrupted text or translation.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>What the text actually says</h1>\n<p>You don’t cite where in Seder Olam exactly you got this from, so I’m basing the following based on guesswork. Seder Olam 12 begins with the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יהושע פרנס את ישראל עשרים ושמנה שנה ויהי אחרי הדברים האלה וימת יהושע בן נון וגו׳ ויקברו אותו וגו׳</p>\n<p>Joshua was a provider for the Jews for 28 years. “And it was after these things that Joshua son of Nun died...and they buried him...”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The quote at the end is toward the end of Joshua 24. The important part is the beginning. He wasn’t a judge for 28 years; he was a provider. The word שופט means judge; the word פרנס refers to someone who provides for people’s needs.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Where your text may have come from</h1>\n<p>The remainder of the chapter, after addressing Elazar son of Aaron’s death, goes down the list of judges. Perhaps the translator assumed that Joshua and Elazar are also judges for that reason.</p>\n<p>Further, the following chapter opens up with the following statement about Eli the Priest:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עלי פרנס את ישראל ארבעים שנה</p>\n<p>Eli was a provider for the Jews for 40 years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this same Eli is identified as having judged the Jews for the same 40 years in I Samuel 4:18:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והוא שפט את ישראל ארבעים שנה</p>\n<p>And he judged the Jews for 40 years</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps whoever translates your copy of Seder Olam confused פרנס for שפט for that reason, and since the same word is used by Joshua, that error extended to him.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>TL;DR, and questions left hanging</h1>\n<p>When did Joshua become a judge? Never. When did he become a provider? Fourteen years before entering Israel. What does being a provider mean in a world in which they have food raining from the sky and water flowing from a miraculous well? I’m not sure exactly. But that’s what the Midrash says - feel free to <a href=\"https://Judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/ask\">ask</a>, maybe someone can help you out with that piece, because I’m at a loss.</p>\n\n\n",

As a result, they were attacked by the normal type of snakes that were to be found. As Rav Hirsch translates 21:6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then Hashem let the poisonous serpents loose against the people, and\n  they bit the people and many people of Israel died.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלח in the Kal means to send to put something in motion towards a\n  goal. But שַלֵחַ in Piel predominantly has the meaning of letting\n  something go, to leave it to its natural way, not to hold it back.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, we see in Noach when he sent out the raven and the dove and in other places.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here too, not Hashem <strong>sent</strong> serpents, but let them go, did not keep\n  them back. Hence not נחשים שרפים but הנחשים השרפים, they had always\n  been there in the wilderness, but hitherto they had been kept back by\n  Hashem's careful protecting Power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that the term <em>burning</em> is a reference to the physical nature of the serpents and does not refer to the <em>Seraphim</em> that you reference from Yeshaya. The reason for the usage of the term there is because on a spiritual level the navi <em>saw</em> beings of <em>fire</em>. The two places refer to completely different concepts.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Surgeons and the Three Weeks / Nine Days\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>May an observant surgeon perform elective surgeries during Nine Days?\nDoes it make a difference if the patient is not Jewish?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Non-emergency surgery should be avoided during the 3 weeks (Kovetz MiBeit Levi, page 11, halacha 8).\nThe Shulchan Aruch(551) advises against being involved in situations that might involve \"sakana\" (danger) during the 3 weeks (bain hemetzarim). The Sh. Aruch(551:18) further cautions against hitting a child during the 3 weeks (based on Midrash Shocher Tov). If hitting a child is considered a \"sakana,\" a surgical operation certainly is (Sha'aray Halacha Uminhag, siman 226 cited in Nitei Gavriel, Bain Hemetzorim, Vol. 1, page 145).  </p>\n\n<p>Maharsham writes in Sefer Da'at Torah (551:18) that the concern regarding hitting children is only in a room that does not have a mezuzah. Rabbi Yitzchok Zilberstein writes in Sefer Torat Hayoledet (page 307) that a a woman who requires a C-section should try and postpone it for after bain hametzorim.  If this is not feasable, there is no concern because \"shomer mitzvah lo yedah davar ra\".  He then quotes the above Maharsham, that a mezuzah guards protects and saves and therefore if the operating room has a mezuzah, there would be no concern.  At any rate, continues Rabbi Zilberstein, G-d will protect the mothers who fulfil the mitzvah of pirya verivya (procreation).  Moreover, a shaliach mitzvah comes to no harm.  </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein had a different approach.  He permitted surgery during the 3 weeks up until the 9 days.  He quotes the Shulchan Aruch that the prohibition against hitting a child during the three weeks is because \"keter meriri sholait,\" the evil spirit has control. He says this only refers to hitting that causes suffering as occurs when one hits out of anger.  However, hitting that is for the person's benefit and with his consent is not included in this prohibition.  During the nine days, a time of misfortune, one should avoid surgery, if possible (Masoret Moshe, Vol. 1, page 170). </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Asher Weiss' yeshiva published a Sefer Darchei Hora'ah - Bain Hemetzorim.  Rabbi Yosef Weingarten writes that it is preferable to postpone any elective surgery. The comparison to spanking a child may not be compelling. When a child is spanked, the desire is for divine intervention to help improve the child's behavior and the \"meriri\" (divine judgement) can now step in and cause harm.  An operation, however, is performed to cure and not cause harm and should be permitted.  He then quotes Rabbi Zilberstein and writes (quoting Shu\"t Hitorerut Teshuva) that shomer mitzvah lo yeda davar ra. </p>\n\n<p>So, regarding the surgeon, what should he do?  Rabbi Feinstein presents a lenient view until the nine days.  Rabbi Weingarten appears to be even more lenient.  There is a principle - \"Halacha rofefet beyadecha - pook chazi my ama davar.\"  When one is unsure of the halacha, go out and see what people are doing.  I perform surgery, and I am unaware of any observant doctor in my area who does not perform needed surgery during bain hametzorim. </p>\n\n<p>May Hashem grant all of Klal Yisroel good health and may the time come when doctors can inform their patients, \"You are in good shape, no treatment required.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>R' Yitzchak Zilberstein taught in a lecture:</p>\n\n<p>Elective surgery which can be postponed until after Tisha B'Av should not be done during the 9 days. Before that (during 3 weeks) it is ok to do it.</p>\n\n<p>A Dr. who will lose his job if he refuses to do surgery then may perform the surgery even during the 9 days.</p>\n\n<p>Since the reason for not performing surgery during the 9 days is because of ריע מזליה, and therefore it is not advisable for a Jewish surgeon to perform elective surgery even on a non Jew during that time, (if avoidable) because it may not be successful, and it may be detrimental for the Dr's reputation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In Judaism, is there a view which is similar to the Original Sin of Christianity?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>First, I would like to describe a little bit of my background. I'm not Jewish, and I'm not a Christian. Currently, I'm in a debate with some Christian members in a Christian forum with our mother language about Original Sin (OS), where I said that OS is not logical, or, if they say it's logical, then (I say) it's coming from a weak background.</p>\n\n<p>I've read two similar questions, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/73836/how-is-the-jewish-understanding-of-the-sinful-soul-of-mankind-different-from-the\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/91856/evil-inclination-history\">here</a>, but to be honest - I don't find a satisfying answer there.</p>\n\n<p>I found in Google inormation about Yetzer ha-Ra', and my conclusion is that it is <em>\"a desire to do bad things\"</em>. (I hope my conclusion about Yetzer ha-Ra' is correct).</p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if there is a similarity in Judaism with the Christian\ndoctrine of Original Sin. From the forum, what I found based from answers is something like this: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Before Adam eats the fruit, Adam doesn't have the inclination to do bad things or to break the Law.</p></li>\n<li><p>After Adam eats the fruit, Adam now has that inclination to do bad things. The evidence is:<br></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>a. Adam now knows that he is naked<br> \nb. Adam hides after he hears God is coming<br>\nc. Instead of admitting his wrong act, he throws the fault to Eve.<br></p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Adam's future babies will be born sinners. The evidence:<br>\nIt is known that there is an event where a toddler hits his younger brother - although that toddler has already been told \"Don't hit anyone.'</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It is because of those 3 points above that I say that OS <em>\"has a weak background\"</em> - and I haven't touched on the reference to it in the writings of Paul yet.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A sentence from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/91856/evil-inclination-history\">here</a> say :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of the medieval commentators explains that previous to the first\n  sin, the Yetzer ha-Ra' (= the snake) was external to the person. After the\n  first sin, the Yetzer ha-Ra' was internalized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Assuming the quote above is correct in the point of view of Judaism, my question is : <br></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>How is the situation of Adam between before and after Yetzer ha-Ra' became internal in him? <br></p></li>\n<li><p>After Adam eats the fruit, <br></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>a. is the Yetzer ha-Ra' like a \"virus\" by which all Adam's future babies will be \"infected\" once they are born (where the evidence of the \"infection\" is their first wrong act) ? or <br></p>\n\n<p>b. Adam's future generation must do wrong first, and then it gets \"infected\" by it?<br></p>\n\n<p>I realize that maybe I will need to edit some of my questions if the quote above is not correct from the point of view of Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you.<br></p>\n\n<p>PS: Because I'm not from an English-speaking country, I'm sorry if my English is difficult to be understood.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The online <em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> ('Original Sin') states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Man is responsible for sin because he is endowed with free will (\"beḥirah\"); yet he is by nature frail, and the tendency of the mind is to evil: \"For the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth\" (Gen. viii. 21; Yoma 20a; Sanh. 105a). Therefore God in His mercy allowed man to repent and be forgiven. Jewish theologians are divided in regard to the cause of this so-called \"original sin\"; some teach that it was due to Adam's yielding to temptation in eating of the forbidden fruit and has been inherited by his descendants; the majority, however, do not hold Adam responsible for the sins of mankind.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Roman Catholic Church, which teaches the doctrine of original sin, commands infants (male and female) to be baptized right after birth to nullify the penalty of exclusion from Paradise and the tree of life decreed upon Adam and Eve and their descendants.<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/...limbo/catholic-church-buries-lim...\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> Judaism does not have this doctrine and rite.  It has circumcision (for males only), and this rite is not connected with the sin of Adam and Eve.  'Although a few of the Rabbis occasionally lament Eve's share in the poisoning of the human race by the Serpent, even they declare that the antidote to such poison has been found at Sinai' (R' Joseph H. Hertz, former Chief Rabbi of the British Empire, in <em>The Pentateuch and Haftorahs</em>, page 196).  </p>\n\n<p><em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> ('Yetzer Ha-Ra'') defines yetzer ha-ra' this way: 'Evil inclination or impulse, popularly identified with the lusts of the flesh. The idea is derived from Gen. viii. 21: \"the imagination of the heart of man is evil from his youth.' . . . It would appear that the Yeẓer Ṭov comes with reflection, and at the age of bar miẓwah or confirmation, because it is said to be thirteen years [older] than the Yeẓer ha-Ra', <em>which is an inborn impulse</em> (Ecclesiastes Rabbah ix. 14). \" (Italics mine.)</p>\n\n<p>The Christian concept of original sin is different.  The online <em>Catholic Encyclopedia</em> ('Original Sin') states: 'Original sin may be taken to mean: (1) the sin that Adam committed; (2) a consequence of this first sin, the hereditary stain with which we are born on account of our origin or descent from Adam. From the earliest times the latter sense of the word was more common, . . .'  In the section entitled 'Nature of Original Sin,' it is admitted: 'This is a difficult point and many systems have been invented to explain it.'  The concept derives from Paul's <em>Letter to the Romans</em> 5:10-21, a very challenging and profound passage, which, however, does not argue for the nearly universal practice of the rite of infant baptism in Christianity. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/...limbo/catholic-church-buries-lim...\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a> See the online 2007 article '<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/...limbo/catholic-church-buries-lim...\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Catholic Church buries limbo after centuries</a>' for the recent voiding of the centuries-old teaching that infants who die without being baptized do not go to Heaven and are denied the vision of God there, but are rather sent to a place called limbo, imagined to be not a place of fire as Purgatory and Hell are conceived to be. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>You asked, \"if there is a similarity in Judaism with the Christian's point of view of Original Sin.\" You went on to also quote \"medieval commentators\", suggesting to me that a quote from the Talmud/Gemara would be acceptable. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, without suggesting that the following is a main view, the answer is yes, there is / was,  \"a similarity in Judaism with the Christian's point of view of Original Sin\" - ... that ALL are sinners ...: </p>\n\n<p>www.Sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.101a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Eliezer said to him: Akiva, have I failed to fulfill any portion\n  of the entire Torah? Rabbi Akiva said to him, you taught us, our\n  teacher: “For there is not a righteous man upon earth who does good\n  and sins not”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rather, Tishah b’Av was a Shabbos, and they pushed it off to after Shabbos, and Rebbe said, ‘Since it’s being pushed off, let it be pushed off.’ But the Chachamim did not agree to him.” He applied to him the passuk (Koheles 4:9) “Two are better than one.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is Rebbe’s logic? Since Tishah b’Av isn’t being observed in its time, why bother having it at all? Is it so important that Tishah b’Av be held on that day, that if we mourn the Beis HaMikdash the following day, it doesn’t count? If so, why, indeed, do we not follow this practice?</p>\n\n<p>Further, why does he only argue on Tishah b’Av? Several fast days can fall out on Shabbos - whenever Tishah b’Av falls out on Sunday, for instance, Shivah Asar b’Tammuz does, as well - and back then, when there was no fixed calendar, any fast day could.

There is not room here to list all of them\n  but we can mention a few.</p>\n  \n  <p>First of all he explains that the main purpose of the Mikdash is to\n  bring forgiveness to those who sinned. The Mikdash was called <em>LEVANON</em>\n  because SHEMALBIN AVONOTEI- HEN SHEL YISRAEL, it whitened (cleansed)\n  the sins of Israel (Yoma 39:). There was never anyone in Jerusalem who\n  had sins on him since the morning TAMID sacrifice brought forgiveness\n  for sins they did at night and the late afternoon <em>Korban Tamid</em> sacrifice for\n  sins done during the day. The Talmud says that Shabbat had the same\n  capacity. “Anyone who says <em>Vaychulu Hashamayim</em>… (which we say in\n  Kiddush) all his sins are forgiven” (Shabbos 119:). Anyone who\n  realizes that Hashem is the one who created the world (as we state in\n  Kiddush) and who runs it even today realizes that he can’t do anything\n  against Hashem and he will not sin.</p>\n  \n  <p>All the malachos – creative work that we are forbidden to do on\n  Shabbat is learned from the work done in building the Mishkan.</p>\n  \n  <p>Special clothing for Shabbos, like the special clothing of the Kohanim\n  serving in the Mishkan / Bais Hamikdash.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the Mikdash there were Lechem Hapanim, On Shabbos we hve special\n  breads, challos, and we put specific emphasis on the bread by doubling\n  them with <em>lechm mishnah</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos has special songs. The <em>Zemiros</em> of Shabbos. Each day a\n  specific psalm was sung in the Bais hamikdash. As added emphasis, the\n  song for shabbos is the only one which the passuk itself prefaces with\n  the opening words \"<em>Mizmor Shir L'Yom Hashabbos</em>\".</p>\n  \n  <p>He even goes on to connect the special smells of Shabbos,with the\n  smells of the Ketores i the bais hamikdash. See quote and story in\n  <a href=\"https://www.ouisrael.org/torah-tidbits/the-shabbat-the-mishkan/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on these points, Rav Pincus explained the idea that the building\n  of the Bais Hamikdash was interrupted for shabbos. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.6a.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Yevamos\n  6a</a>. (He added that although the Gemara there gives an explanation\n  of כולכם חייבין בכבודי, there is deep understanding to this idea).</p>\n  \n  <p>He explains that the shabbos is somewhat of an alternative, (and\n  somewhat higher) manifestation of the concept of Bais Hamikdash.\n  Therefore, We interrupt it's construction for Shabbos.</p>\n  \n  <p>With this idea he explains the postpoement of the mourning of the\n  destruction of the Bais Hamikdash when tisha B'Av falls on shabbos.\n  \"When we have Shabbos, we have Bais Hamikdash\", we therefore do not\n  mourn it's dstruction on shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>__    ____    ____</p>\n\n<p>Based on this concept, IMHO, we can understand why Rebbe posited that \"הואיל ונדחה ידחה\" - The year which Tisha B'Av fell on shabbos \"we had Bais Hamikdash on Tisha B'av\", and thus there is no need to reeinstate mourning for the Bais Hamikdash anymore that year.\n(the Chachamim, who disagreed with Rebbe, opined that this concept is enough to postpone the mourning from shabbos, but not to do away with it completely.</p>\n\n<p>This can also answer the (poster's second) question, why does [Rebbe] only argue on Tishah b’Av? Several fast days can fall out on Shabbos...?</p>\n\n<p>If this writer's explanation is correct, it only applies to Tisha B'av but not to other fasts of which the reason for the postponement is only due to the prohibition of fasting on shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

Get a metal baking/roasting pan, put the glass containers—votives, whatever…—onto the sheet upside down. Place them in the oven and turn the oven up to the minimal temperature it can be set at. That’s usually 200 degrees Fahrenheit based on U.S. measurements.</p>\n\n<p>Now let the oven heat up with the glasses in there for about 5 to 10 minutes. Peek inside to see if the wax has melted. If it has, the wax would melt down into the pan and the glasses should be a bit cleaner.</p>\n\n<p>When you feel the wax as melted out as much as possible, take the pan out of the oven and then—using paper towels or a rag you won’t need anymore—take each glass container and wipe away as much of the still liquid-like wax as possible.  If all goes well, the glasses should be clean of all wax.</p>\n\n<p>If somehow there are some residual pieces of wax, I would recommend just boiling the glasses on the stove in a pot with a small amount of water, wait for that wax to melt again and and wipe it away again with the paper towels and/or rags.</p>\n\n<p>The reality is some wax will be melted in with the water and head down the drain.

While Rashi brings a prooftext, at least over there the word “see” makes sense in context; here, the word “see” sounds very out of place.

His father seeds the white parts in him: bones, sinews, nails, the brain in his head, and the whites of his eyes. His mother seeds the red [i.e. darker] parts in him: skin, flesh, hair, {blood} and pupils. Hashem gives him a Ruach, a Neshamah, a countenance, eyesight, ability to hear, speech, ability to walk, understanding, and thought.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words: the mother and father provide the physical body of a person, while Hashem provides the physiology. The Gemara continues that when a person dies, Hashem takes His part and leaves the parents’ part before them.</p>\n<p>Go see if you can find a non-Jew. Does he have skin and pupils? Great, he had a mother. Does he have whites in his eye and fingernails? Great, he had a father. Is he alive? Great, Hashem helped in his birth.

On one side, the whole point of opening the ark is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/19070/11501\">to inspire the <em>kahal</em></a> which also works without a minyan. On the other, <em>Hazal</em> prescribed a certain form to the <em>tfila b'tzibur</em> which we are not deviating from.

The two <em>rabbanim</em> I asked said that, since it was a custom when praying in <em>minyan</em>, one shouldn't do so when praying without. One suggested that, if the majority of the <em>tzibur</em> wanted it, there is nothing to prevent it, but it shouldn't be the default option.</p>\n\n<p>Since other <em>rabbanim</em> might rule differently, as always, <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/q/1734\">CYLOR</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The case of the expanding heresy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Mitzvah # 387 in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Hachinuch</a> is not to go astray towards heresy and licentiousness. In that mitzvah, the Sefer Hachinuch writes the following line:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ענין לאו זה שנמנענו שלא ניחד מחשבותינו לחשוב בדעות שהם היפך הדעת\n  שהתורה בנויה עליו לפי שאפשר לבוא מתוך כך למינות</p>\n  \n  <p>The nature of this prohibition is that we are prevented from directing\n  our thoughts to think about ideas that are contrary to the ideas that\n  the Torah is built upon, because it is possible to come from this to\n  heresy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This seems to be saying that there is a prohibition of thinking about things that might lead to heresy, because they might lead to heresy. I.e. this mitzvah is designed to prevent one from reaching heresy. This implies that the intermediate step – thoughts about ideas contrary to the ideas the Torah is built upon – is not actual heresy. I.e. thinking things contrary to the Torah foundations may lead to heresy but is not itself heresy.</p>\n\n<p>In the second Beiur Halacha (ד\"ה הוא) <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Meir_Kagan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yisrael Meir Kagan</a> quotes the Sefer Hachinuch about Six Constant Mitzvos, of which mitzvah # 387 is the sixth. In his quote for this mitzvah he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובכלל אפיקורסות הוא כל מחשבות זרות שהם היפך דעת התורה</p>\n  \n  <p>And included in heresy are any foreign thoughts that are contrary to\n  the view of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This does not seem to be an accurate quote/paraphrase of the Sefer Hachinuch on two counts.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Beiur Halacha claims that these thoughts are themselves heretical, while the Sefer Hachinuch only says that they lead to heresy.</li>\n<li>The Beiur Halacha seems to include anything that goes against <strong>any</strong> Torah idea, whereas the Sefer Hachinuch only mentions things that go against the Torah's <strong>foundational</strong> ideas.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Did R. Yisrael Meir Kagan believe that the Sefer Hachinuch is in consonance with what he wrote? If yes, what is the explanation? If not, why does he claim that he is quoting/paraphrasing the Sefer Hachinuch when he is in fact expanding on the ideas mentioned in the Sefer Hachinuch?</p>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1569/b-a\">b a</a> pointed out, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chayei_Adam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Adam</a> (1:5) contains a similar formulation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובכלל מינות הוא כל מחשבות זרות שהם היפך דעת התורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is thus possible that the Beiur Halacha's interpretation was influenced by the Chayei Adam, or he remembered the Chayei Adam's formulation instead of the Sefer Hachinuch's formulation, or he was actually quoting the Chayei Adam (he does say to look at the Chayei Adam who speaks at length about this \"ועיין בח\"א כלל א' שהאריך ג\"כ בהם\"). This third option is perhaps less likely because he says at the end of the paragraph that he took everything from the Sefer Hachinuch \"כ\"ז לקטתי מלשונו הנחמד בקצרה\", and, moreover, in Shemiras Halashon (2:2) R. Yisrael Meir Kagan discusses this idea again, and he explicitly attributes this very line to the Sefer Hachinuch:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב החינוך שבכלל מינות הוא כל מחשבות שהם היפך דעת התורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regardless, the question still stands – where did either the Beiur Halacha/Shemiras Halashon or the Chayei Adam derive this expansion from?</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruch_HaShulchan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan</a> that contains footnotes with the rulings of the Mishnah Berurah that diverge with those of the Aruch Hashulchan, this Beiur Halacha is cited as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובבה\"ל (ד\"ה הוא) כתב דבכלל מינות ואפיקורסות הוא כל מחשבות זרות שהם\n  היפך דעת תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't know if this was deliberate or not but as you can see they left out the \"ה\" in התורה so that now it reads דעת תורה (instead of דעת התורה as it was in the Beiur Halacha), which in contemporary times can have an entirely different connotation. (I.e it can be read as saying that anything that goes against <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da%27as_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Da'as Torah</a> is heretical.) This would be an even greater expansion of the Sefer Hachinuch.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I looked through approximately 50 sefarim that quote the Beiur Halacha, Shemiras Halashon, or Chayei Adam, and not one of them noted this issue. In fact, one of them actually said \"these are the words of the Sefer Hachinuch in his introduction...\" but then just cited the Beiur Halacha:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ז\"ל החינוך בהקדמתו שלא נתור אחר מחשבת הלב וראיית העיניים ולא תתורו\n  אחרי לבבכם וגו' ואמרו חכמים אחרי לבבכם זו אפיקורסות עיניכם זו זנות\n  ובכלל אפיקורסות הוא כל מחשבות זרות שהם היפך דעת התורה מובא בביאור הלכה\n  סימן א</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Re: question 1. The Sefer Ha-Chinuch is addressing the prohibition of לא תתורו, which means (in a <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912360/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translated version of the Rambam's words</a>) \"We should not turn our minds to these matters, think about them, or be drawn after the thoughts of our hearts.\" Therefore, the Sefer Ha-Chinuch states that <em>thinking about</em> such ideas may lead to heresy--because even contemplation of these ideas, without accepting them, can <em>lead to</em> heresy. The Beiur Halachah, on the other hand, is defining what heresy is, not how one may come to it. </p>\n\n<p>Re: question 2. The words הדעת שהתורה בנויה עליו mean \"the opinion on which the Torah is based.\" This can also be stated as דעת התורה--the opinion of the Torah--without doing any damage to the meaning. Defining heresy as a rejection of the opinion of the Torah is not a controversial assertion (or \"expansion\" of heresy), since the eighth principle of the Rambam includes as heresy rejection of any part of the Torah. (Of course, this does not resolve the question of what the opinion of the Torah is. However, knowingly rejecting the Torah's opinion would constitute heresy according to all rabbinic views.) In fact, the Rashbetz suggests that believing that what the Torah says is true is perhaps the only principle of the Torah (copied from <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/vol20Krakowski.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">note 6 here</a>): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>העיקר הגדול בכל זה הוא להאמין מה שכללה אותו התורה...ולזה יצדק לומר\n  כי עיקרי התורה הם כמספר אותיות שבתורה או כמספר תיבות...כי מי שאינו\n  מודה באחת מהן הוא משומד ואינו בכלל ישראל. ויצדק לומר גם כן שאין בתורה\n  כי אם עיקר אחד והוא והוא <strong>להאמין כי כל מה שכללה אותו התורה הוא האמת</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>You open up a huge discussion about <strong>the Poskim carefully choosing their words</strong>. This is another \"common belief\" which turns out very untrue.</p>\n\n<p>It turns out they don't, especially when the topic is very fuzzy or/and educational or/and emotionally loaded.

    "content": "# Was Bilam evil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a plain reading of the text it seems that Bilam acted righteously. He always did as Hashem commanded, prostrated immediately before the angel that he met, blessed the Jewish people and forthrightly stuck to his principle in following Hashem's instructions the whole way through Bamidbar chapters 22 - 24.</p>\n\n<p>When Bilam fist met with messengers from Balak's party, Bilam asks Hashem if he should go, Hashem replies (22:12):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר אֱלֹהִים אֶל-בִּלְעָם, לֹא תֵלֵךְ עִמָּהֶם; לֹא תָאֹר אֶת-הָעָם, כִּי בָרוּךְ הוּא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bilam tells Balak's party that he cannot go, on account of Hashem's edict; he send's Balak's party on their way... \"more honourable\" servants return after giving word to Balak to curse the Jewish people. Yet, still, Bilam is insistent (22:18):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיַּעַן בִּלְעָם, וַיֹּאמֶר אֶל-עַבְדֵי בָלָק, אִם-יִתֶּן-לִי בָלָק מְלֹא בֵיתוֹ, כֶּסֶף וְזָהָב--לֹא אוּכַל, לַעֲבֹר אֶת-פִּי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָי, לַעֲשׂוֹת קְטַנָּה, אוֹ גְדוֹלָה. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bilam then tells these servants that he will 'sleep on it', expecting Hashem to answer him in a dream (22:20):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיָּבֹא אֱלֹהִים אֶל-בִּלְעָם, לַיְלָה, וַיֹּאמֶר לוֹ אִם-לִקְרֹא לְךָ בָּאוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים, קוּם לֵךְ אִתָּם; וְאַךְ, אֶת-הַדָּבָר אֲשֶׁר-אֲדַבֵּר אֵלֶיךָ--אֹתוֹ תַעֲשֶׂה.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's not clear what the plain meaning of \"אִם-לִקְרֹא לְךָ בָּאוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים\" is. However, the follow up shows that Bilam did do something wrong is in Bamibar (22:22):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּחַר-אַף אֱלֹהִים, כִּי-הוֹלֵךְ הוּא, וַיִּתְיַצֵּב מַלְאַךְ יְהוָה בַּדֶּרֶךְ, לְשָׂטָן לוֹ; וְהוּא רֹכֵב עַל-אֲתֹנוֹ, וּשְׁנֵי נְעָרָיו עִמּוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Despite doing something (unobviously) wrong Bilam never gives the impression that he will ever curse the Jewish people. Hashem had initially told Bilam not to go with them (period), however, it seems like this was only on the condition that he doesn't curse them; which he continuously says that he wont.</p>\n\n<p>He is immediately repentant upon discovering the identity of the angel, blesses the Jewish people and always shows righteous allegiance to the word of Hashem regardless of following Balak's servants! There is obviously something that Bilam does wrong to invoke Hashem's anger. However, this is a far cry from Bilam being evil; it seems, from the plain reading of the text, that Bilam acted righteously. Do any commentaries mention this?</p>\n\n<p>It was always my understanding that both Balak and Bilam had evil intentions. Balak's bad intentions are clear from the text, however, Bilam's are certainly not clear.</p>\n\n<p>Was Bilam indeed evil?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When G-d told Bilam not to go, the Pasuk says \"לֹא תֵלֵךְ עִמָּהֶם\", don't go with them. The word <em>imahem</em> implies \"In mind and in deed\"; whereas when the second Pasuk says, \"קוּם לֵךְ אִתָּם\", <em>itam</em> implies \"Go with them physically.\" While it's true that Bilam went with them only when G-d told him to, G-d was telling him to only go with them physically, but not with their evil intentions. Bilam is wicked (besides for all of the Midrashim and Gemaras that speak of his evil) because although he listened to what G-d said he ignored what G-d intended, and went with the intention to curse the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Gemara, Bil'am was evil (and punished) for indirectly causing the Jews to sin with the women of Midian and Moav.  This is clear from the Talmud (Gittin 57a, Sefaria translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אזל אסקיה לבלעם בנגידא אמר ליה מאן חשיב בההוא עלמא א\"ל ישראל מהו לאידבוקי בהו א\"ל (דברים כג, ז) לא תדרוש שלומם וטובתם כל הימים א\"ל דיניה דההוא גברא במאי א\"ל בשכבת זרע רותחת</p>\n<p>Onkelos then went and raised Balaam from the grave through necromancy. He said to him: Who is most important in that world where you are now? Balaam said to him: The Jewish people. Onkelos asked him: Should I then attach myself to them here in this world? Balaam said to him: You shall not seek their peace or their welfare all the days (see Deuteronomy 23:7). Onkelos said to him: What is the punishment of that man, a euphemism for Balaam himself, in the next world? Balaam said to him: He is cooked in boiling semen, as he caused Israel to engage in licentious behavior with the daughters of Moab.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do we burn Tamei and Passul Karbanos Pesach on the 15th?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Pesachim (82a,83a) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הפסח שיצא או שנטמא ישרף מיד. נטמאו הבעלים או שמתו תעובר צורתו וישרף בט״ז. ר׳ יוחנן בן ברוקה אומר אף זה ישרף מיד לפי שאין לו אוכלין. העצמות והגידין והנותר ישרפו בט״ז. חל ט״ז להיות בשבת ישרפו בי״ז לפי שאינן דוחין לא את השבת ולא את היום טוב. </p>\n  \n  <p>A Pesach which left [Yerushalayim] or became tamei is immediately burned. If the owners became tamei or died, we leave the Karban over and burn it on the 16th. R’ Yochanan Ben Beroka said, even in this case it’s burned immediately, since there are no eaters. Bones, sinews, and leftover Karbanos are burned on the 16th. If the 16th fell on Shabbos, we burn it on the 17th, since it doesn’t push off Shabbos nor Yom Tov. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When I learned these Mishnayos with my 10-year-old Chavrusa, he asked me a very simple question, which I was kind of embarrassed that I didn’t come up with on my own. </p>\n\n<p>The Halacha follows Rav (Gemara on 6a) that one who found Chametz on Pesach should cover it and burn it on Chol HaMoed (OC 446:1). Thus, he posed a simple Kal v’Chomer: if Chametz, which has a prohibition against owning it, we still wait to burn it, a Tamei Karban Pesach, which does not have a prohibition against owning it, is it not logical that we should wait to burn it? So why in the beginning of the Mishnah does the Tanna Kamma say that we burn it immediately?</p>\n\n<p>Then we read a bit further and got to the end of the following Mishnah, which said that it doesn’t push off Shabbos and Yom Tov, further strengthening his question. I checked the Gemara, and indeed, 84b-85a gives not one but four different sources that this is the case (Chizkiya’s source that the passuk has an extra “ad boker,” Abaye’s source of “olas Shabbas biShabbato,” Rava’s comparison to a Bris Milah that was pushed off, and Rav Ashi’s understanding that this is an aseh versus an aseh and a lav). Even if his Kal v’Chomer fell apart, he has a Mishnah, defended by several pesukim, that support his question!</p>\n\n<p>I originally thought to answer that Nosar, the subject of the end of the Mishnah, is different than a Tamei or Passul, the subject of the beginning, but then I saw that these <em>same expositions</em> appear in Shabbos 24b-25a regarding the Mishnah of אין מדליקין שמן שרפה ביו״ט, we don’t light on Yom Tov with Shemen Sereifah (Terumah oil that’s Tamei and must be burned). Since the same pesukim are applied by Shemen Sereifah and Nosar, there’s clearly no distinction between Tamei and Nosar. Why, then does the Tanna Kamma in our Mishnah in Pesachim learn that we burn a Tamei or Passul Karban Pesach immediately?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Pesachim.7.9.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Ovadiah miBartenura</a> explains that this <em>mishnah</em> is discussing a case where the <em>korban pesach</em> became impure or left Jerusalem <strong>on the fourteenth of Nissan</strong>. In such a case, it is burnt immediately <strong>on the fourteenth of Nissan.</strong> It cannot, however, be burnt at any time on the fifteenth, as it is forbidden to burn invalid sacrifices on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>This is in contrast to a case requiring <em>ibbur tzurah</em>, such as the owners all dying on the fourteenth of Nissan after the <em>korban pesach</em> had been brought. In such a case, it cannot be burnt until it has become <em>notar</em> (on the morning of the fifteenth). And, since the fifteenth is Yom Tov, one must wait to burn it until the morning of the sixteenth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>Partial answer, for reasons to be explained at the very end.</em></p>\n\n<p>Tosfos (Pesachim 83b “Litein boker sheini lisereifaso”) ask: if the passuk is specifically adding a second <em>morning</em>, implying that you can’t burn it on the second <em>night</em>, how can we derive over in Shabbos that we can’t burn Shemen Sereifah on Yom Tov <em>night</em>? They answer that the real prohibition learned from here indeed is regarding Yom Tov day, and we find elsewhere (Pesachim 3a) that even Shelamim which become Nosar on the third night still are only burned the following morning. We see from here that Kodshim can’t be burned at night. </p>\n\n<p>The Tiferes Yisrael (Yachin §43) adopts this same approach. Therefore, he says, the Mishnah must be talking about a case where it was taken outside when it was still the 14th, and so there’s no problem with burning it immediately. </p>\n\n<p>So this is all well and good if you learn like Chizkiya. The problem is according to the others. </p>\n\n<p><em>Perhaps</em> you can argue the same in Rava, similar to how a Bris Milah can’t be performed at night. <em>Perhaps</em> you can argue the same in Abaye, similar to how an Olah can only be brought in the morning. But according to Rav Ashi, the approach adopted by the Bartenura to our Mishnah, the question still stands: that an aseh can’t push an aseh and a lav doesn’t matter whether it’s a daytime or nighttime mitzvah, and so according to him, the question should still stand.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The fundamental difference is that <em>there's no</em> mitzva <em>to burn chametz</em> - בביטול בעלמא סגי, just revoking ownership gets you out of the prohibition, and the burning is a Rabbinical addition in case one find a גלוסקא יפה, delicious cake, and eats it before remembering it's Pesach. </p>\n\n<p>However, burning נותר is a <em>mitzva</em>, not a precaution. </p>\n\n\n",

R. Breuer (in טעמי המקרא section ג.10-11) says that in this situation, the light accent becomes a kadma (or azla, if you will) only when not in the domain of a revia. Here, however, revia does follow, and R. Breuer lists this among several exceptions (along with Lev 14:51, Deut 25:19, and Sam 1:4:18). He suggests that perhaps the transformation still occurs when t'lisha g'dola precedes, even with a revia following.

For example regular ribbis is forbidden even after the loan was paid back, if given explicitly as payment for the loan, <em>ribbis devarim</em> is only forbidden as long as the loan is yet unpaid.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hilchos Malveh V'Loveh 5:12 writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שלוה מחבירו ולא היה רגיל מקודם להקדים לו שלום אסור להקדים לו שלום,\n  ואצ\"ל שיקלסו בדברים או ישכים לפתחו שנאמר נשך כל דבר אפילו דברים\n  אסורים, <strong>וכן אסור לו ללמד את המלוה מקרא או גמרא כל זמן שמעותיו בידו</strong>\n  אם לא היה רגיל בזה מקודם שנא' נשך כל דבר.</p>\n  \n  <p>When a person who borrowed money from a colleague would not ordinarily\n  greet him first, it is forbidden for him to greet him first. Needless\n  to say, it is forbidden for him to praise the lender in public or go\n  to his home. These prohibitions are derived from the phrase\n  Deuteronomy 23:20: \"All types of neshech\"; even words are forbidden.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Similarly, it is forbidden for the borrower to teach the lender Scripture or Talmud throughout the duration of the loan</strong> if the\n  borrower was not accustomed to doing so previously,52 as implied by\n  the phrase: \"All types of interest.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rambam is including the prohibition of the borrower to teach the\n  lender as part ofthe Halacha of <em>ribbis devarim</em>. And it is for this\n  reason that he writes \"כל זמן שמעותיו בידו\" - that this is only\n  forbidden as long as the loan is yet unpaid, as per the halacha of\n  <em>ribbis devarim</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Question: The halacha (Gemara BM 64b/ Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 166/ Rambam ibid Ch.6 and others) forbids the borrower to rent/work/sell to the lender anything for free or at a discounted rate if he would not do so if the lender had not lent him the money. This is not ribbis Devarim, but standard ribbis derabanan (if not conditioned at the time of the loan).</p>\n\n<p>Why is the borrower teaching the lender when he would not have done so otherwise, different than the above halacha, that it is considered only <em>ribbis devarim</em>?</p>\n\n<p>I can understand why saying greeting a lender is only <em>ribbis devarim</em>, since greetings are not something which have monetary value, and are usually not paid for. But teaching is a job with definite monetary value, so why should it be only considered <em>ribbis devarim</em>?</p>\n\n\n",

It doesn't really \"make sense\" according to how we would likely break chapters ourselves.</p>\n\n<p>Is there an underlying logic to why chapters were cut this way by R Yehuda HaNasi? Are there rules written somewhere or that someone extracted? I didn't find them in the Rambam's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.15.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">introduction to the Mishna</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I have a somewhat novel approach, I have not heard this anywhere...it is pure speculation :) </p>\n\n<p>We know that one of the goals of the way Rebbi Yehuda Hanassi structured the Mishna was in order to make it easy to remember by heart. Maybe it was structured that way in order to remember the order of the chapters better. Meaning if the topic of one chapter continues into the next chapter, that makes it harder to forget the order of the chapters. In other words, doing it this way, links the chapters together.</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully someone has a better answer than this :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why father that teaches Torah is equal in honoring to divorced mother?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Here's another tricky question about Halakhot of honoring parents (Shu\"A ר\"מ-רמ\"א).</em> I rewrite it to change the line of thinking.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>THe Gemmorah (Kid 30b, also Mishna Kritus 6,9 <strong>\"**האב קודם לאם בכל מקום\"</strong>) states that as long as they are married, honoring the father takes precedence over the mother (when in contradiction or at the same time). The reason is that she's subordinate to him by the marriage contract (as long as they are married). </p></li>\n<li><p>When comparing honoring his father vs his Rabbi, <strong>the Rabbi takes precedence</strong>, because \"the father brings him to this world, and the Rabbi to the world to come\" (B\"M 33a). The Gemmorah there proves that <strong>anyone who taught him a single Halacha deserves to be called Rabbi</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>The father has numerous Torah obligations toward his son</strong> (Kid 29a), such as Milah, Pidyon, learning Torah, educating for Mitzvos (let alone his obligatory financial support). So there's no way he does not teach his sons some Torah or Halakhah. Therefore in my understanding, he automatically falls under a category of \"a Rabbi\" (of some kind).</p></li>\n<li><p>However <strong>the Mom is totally exempt from all those</strong> - and does not usually teach the Torah or educate for Mitzvot. Therefore I conclude, that honoring the father (as a part-time Rabbi) must take a precedence over his mother when divorced.</p></li>\n<li><p>However, the Gem. concludes differently: <strong>once they are divorced - they are equal in honor</strong> and the child can pick one randomly. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The question: <strong>given #3, why would honoring the father equal to that of the divorced mother</strong>?   </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Karo</a> discusses a contradiction between two rulings of Rambam about this law. In the last line he writes:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=81715&rid=202\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesef Mishneh Hilchot Talmud Torah 5:1</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל דינים הללו ברבו מובהק אבל רבו שאינו מובהק אפילו אין אביו תלמיד חכם\n  אבידת אביו קודמת דיותר חייב בכבוד אביו מכבודו דלא מקרי הביאו לחיי\n  העולם הבא כל שלא למד ממנו רוב חכמתו</p>\n  \n  <p>And all these laws are regarding his outstanding rabbi. But regarding\n  his non-outstanding rabbi, even if his father is not a Torah scholar\n  the lost object of his father takes precedence, because he is more\n  obligated in the honor of his father than the honor [of his\n  non-outstanding rabbi], since one is not considered to have brought\n  someone to the World to Come unless the person learned most of his\n  wisdom from him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This being the case, we can now compare a father and mother. Even if the father teaches the son more than the mother does, it will not impact the order of returning lost objects. As long as the father is not his \"outstanding rabbi\" it is not considered to be a clash between one who brought him to this world and one who brings him to the World to Come. Therefore we are left with a clash of two people to whom he has equal obligations of honor. Therefore, if the father and mother are married the father takes precedence because the mother also has an obligation to honor her husband. If they are not married, there are no obligations other than the son's equal obligation of honor to both of them, so he does not have to give precedence to his father.</p>\n\n\n",

He suggests that considering how Kozbi was speared, the blood under discussion was actually blood from her makor, dam nida. Which is only impure on a rabbinic level by nonjews, but nonetheless, this miracle spared Pinchas from even that.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהרי דם זה בא מן המקור שדקר אותה שם והוא טמא ומטמא עכ׳פ מדרבנן בעובדי כוכבים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Edit:</em> If we take this idea of the Matnas Kehuna into consideration and assume that the miracle spared him from a rabbinic impurity, then we can suggest another idea based on a comment from @msh210.</p>\n\n<p>There is something called <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Oholot.3.5?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dam Tevusa</a>. This is a blood which came out of a dying person which later mixed with blood that came out of him after he died. The details are subject to dispute in the linked mishna, and Rambam rules in accordance with Rabi Akiva there. But according to all opinions there is at least the possibility that the blood coming out of Zimri could theoretically combine with blood that came out of his body after he died and combine into a riviis to render Pinchas impure, at least on a rabbinic level.</p>\n\n<p>This of course is a further step removed from the actual rabbinic impurity mentioned by Matnas Kehuna, as this blood is only a precursor to the blood from after death. However, it is something that could theoretically be impure, that a miracle would be appreciated to save him from.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can the Rambam say that Kiddushin is a Mitzvah, against the Gemara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Marriage.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Ishus 1:1</a> makes the following statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כֵּיוָן שֶׁנִּתְּנָה תּוֹרָה נִצְטַוּוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁאִם יִרְצֶה הָאִישׁ לִשָּׂא אִשָּׁה יִקְנֶה אוֹתָהּ תְּחִלָּה בִּפְנֵי עֵדִים וְאַחַר כָּךְ תִּהְיֶה לוֹ לְאִשָּׁה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כב יג) \"כִּי יִקַּח אִישׁ אִשָּׁה וּבָא אֵלֶיהָ\": </p>\n  \n  <p>Once the Torah was given, the Jews were commanded that if a man wants to marry a woman, he should take her first before witnesses, and afterwards she should be to him as a wife, as it says, “When a man takes a woman and comes upon her” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 22:13</a>). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam clearly states that Kiddushin is a mitzvah (he should take her <em>before</em> marrying her - in the Hebrew text, the marriage is referred to as לשא, a form of נשואין, Nisuin, the second stage of marriage; therefore, this must refer to the first stage of marriage, Kiddushin). </p>\n\n<p>Now read the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.18b.6-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Kattan 18b</a>. Shmuel said that Kiddushin is permissible on Chol HaMoed, and the Gemara proposed that the fact that the earlier mishnah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.8b.7-8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Kattan 8b</a>) only forbade Nisuin, it must be that Kiddushin is permissible. The Gemara refutes this proof:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא מיבעיא לארס דלא קעביד מצוה אלא אפילו לישא נמי דקא עביד מצוה אסור</p>\n  \n  <p>[The Mishnah means to say:] It goes without saying that Eirusin [i.e. Kiddushin], by which he is not doing a Mitzvah, [should be forbidden,] but even Nisuin also, by which he does a Mitzvah, is forbidden. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Um...</p>\n\n<p>How can the Rambam learn that Kiddushin is a Mitzvah, when the Gemara explicitly states that Kiddushin is <em>not</em> a Mitzvah?!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><em>Rambam</em>'s son, <em>R.

Avraham the son of Rambam</a>. This was his answer:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43006&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birchas Avraham # 44</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואותה הקושיא שהקשית על עיקר דבריו לא קשיא עליה שבמנין המצוות בתחלת\n  הלכה  אמר שהמצוה לישא אשה בכתובה וקידושין ולא אמר לקדש אשה וכן אמרינן\n  לישא דקא עבד מצוה וזה שאמר וליקוחין אלו מצות עשה לפי שהיא תחלת מצות\n  הנשואין וכך אמר בתחלה יקנה אותה תחלה בפני עדים ואחר כך תהיה לו לאשה\n  שנאמר כי יקח איש אשה ובא אליה אבל קידושין בלא נישואין ודאי לא השלים\n  המצוה עדיין ומצות פריה ורביה מצוה אחרת היא שמצות פריה ורביה כשיהיה לו\n  בן או בת קיים המצוה ומצות הקדושין והנשואין אפילו יש לו כמה בנים וכמה\n  בנות ויש עמו כמה נשים כל אשה שירצה לישא אותה מצוה עליו שישא אותה\n  בקדושין ועיין בדבריו ז\"ל בספר מצות יתבאר לך ההפרש שביניהם ואין בנו\n  צורך להאריך בדבר זה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding of this is as follows: Rambam holds that there is a mitzvah of marriage which is made up of two components. <strong>1.</strong> Kiddushin <strong>2.</strong> Nissuin. If one performs Kiddushin but never gets around to doing Nissuin, he has started the mitzvah but has not completed it, and thus he is not considered to have fulfilled the mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Talmud in Moed Katan means that when one does Nissuin he is fulfilling a mitzvah (because having already done Kiddushin, he is now completing the mitzvah) but when one does Kiddushin he is not fulfilling a mitzvah (because not having done Nissuin, the mitzvah is incomplete). This explains how Rambam's view is to be reconciled with the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>As for how, R. Avraham fits this explanation into Rambam's words (or how he derives it from Rambam's words), I believe the following is correct:</p>\n\n<p>There is no indication of this explanation from Sefer Hamitzvot. There Rambam lists two mitzvot, one about procreation (#212) and one about marriage (#213). It is certainly implied that these are two separate mitzvot (i.e. one can fulfill the mitzvah of marriage without procreating), but there is no indication here that the mitzvah of marriage consists of Kiddushin + Nissuin. If anything, the implication there is that Kiddushin is the entirety of the mitzvah of marriage, as that is all that is mentioned there. </p>\n\n<p>However, the indication that Rambam's view is in fact that only Kiddushin + Nissuin = the mitzvah of marriage, is in Mishneh Torah. In the beginning of Hilchot Ishut Rambam lists the mitzvot that are included in this section. The first one is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לישא אשה בכתובה וקידושין</p>\n  \n  <p>To marry a woman, granting her the rights of the formal marriage\n  contract (ketubah) and sanctifying the relationship through the rites\n  of kiddushin; (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952874/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Avraham picks up on the fact that Rambam does not say simply \"לקדש אשה\" which would be sufficient if Kiddushin was the entirety of the mitzvah, but instead says \"לישא אשה בכתובה וקידושין\" which indicates that there is an additional component, namely, Nissuin.</p>\n\n<p>R. Avraham does not note this, but in Shemonah Perakim (Chapter Eight) Rambam has a similar formulation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפי שהאשה הזו <strong>אם לקחה בכתובה וקדושין</strong> והיא מותרת לו ונשאה לפריה\n  ורביה הרי זו מצוה (Kafih translation, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Avraham then clarifies that the mitzvah of marriage (i.e. Kiddushin + Nissuin) is distinct from the mitzvah of procreation. The mitzvah of procreation is fulfilled by having a surviving son or daughter. The mitzvah of marriage can be fulfilled even if you already have many sons, many daughters, and many wives. For any woman that you want to marry, there is a mitzvah to marry her via Kiddushin + Nissuin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Good question. The \"Kessef Mishnah\" on the Rambam (Ishus 1:3) quotes R' Avraham, the son of the Rambam, who noted that this question was posed to him.</p>\n\n<p>Before we get to his answer, I note that the Rambam in Hilchos Ishus 1:1 is not the only source for this position. It is also found in \"Sefer HaMitzvos\" (Asei 213):</p>\n\n<p>הצווי שנצטוינו לבעול בקידושין:\nבמתן דבר ביד האישה, או בשטר, או בביאה - וזוהי מצות קידושין.</p>\n\n<p>The 213th mitzvah is that we are commanded to acquire [by kiddushin1] a woman before having relations with her: either by giving her something [of sufficient value]; by giving her a document [of marriage]; or by having marital relations [for the purpose of kiddushin]. This is the mitzvah of kiddushin.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the \"Kessef Mishnah\" in the name of R' Avraham, the son of the Rambam:</p>\n\n<p>כתב הר\"א בנו של רבינו, שהקשו לו על מה שכתב רבינו מצות עשה של תורה לקדש את האשה ממ\"ש בפרק אלו מגלחין (מ\"ק דף יח) לא מיבעיא קאמר לא מיבעיא לארס דלא עביד מצוה שאסור אלא אפילו לישא דקא עביד מצוה נמי אסור. ותירץ, שבמנין המצות בתחלת ההלכה אמר שהמצוה לישא אשה בכתובה וקידושין, ולא אמר לקדש אשה, וזה שאמר וליקוחין אלו מצות עשה, לפי שהיא תחלת מצות הנישואין, אבל אירוסין בלא נישואין ודאי לא השלים המצוה עדיין: </p>\n\n<p>My understanding of his answer is as follows. Kiddushin alone is not a mitzvah (which is what the gemara in Moed Kattan is referring to). The mitzvah is to procreate (Asei 212), with a woman whom we have previously given Kiddushin to.</p>\n\n<p>I conclude with a \"proof\" that the Rambam uses (Asei 213) to support his position:</p>\n\n<p>ובפרוש אמרו על קידושין בביאה שהם דאורייתא. הנה נתבאר שמצות קידושין דאורייתא.</p>\n\n<p>Our Sages (Kiddushin 9b) stated explicitly that kiddushin by means of relations is a Torah law. This statement proves that kiddushin counts as a law of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Fourth Kingdom is Aram/Yishmael\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone pointed out to me the commentary of Ibn Ezra to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Daniel.2.39.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 2:39</a>. In that verse Daniel is understood to be describing the ארבע מלכיות or the four kingdoms. I always understood these four kingdoms to be those which took the dominion of the Jewish people away, and they are Babylon, Persia/Media, Greece and Rome (see beginning of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ner_Mitzvah,_Why_There_Exist_Four_Kingdoms.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ner Mitzvah</a> by the Maharal). The Ibn Ezra says this verse references Babylon, Persia/Media and Greece. Part of my problem is I don't understand the rest of what he's saying.</p>\n\n<p>He brings Rav Saadiah Gaon who says the fourth kingdom is Aram. I thought they only existed in the times of Tanach? How could they come after Greece? He then also mentions Yishmael being one of the kingdoms, I think.</p>\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra sounds like he disagrees, and says Alexander the Great was the ruler of Greece and Aram? Is that so? Then he says Yishmael is the fourth kingdom? What about Rome? Didn't they destroy the Temple?</p>\n\n<p>I'd appreciate some clarification on what the Ibn Ezra/Rav Saadiah Gaon are saying, and if anyone agrees.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422617243.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This edition</a> of Artscroll on Daniel has a lengthy commentary on this verse which addresses, I hope, your question. Here is a summary of what they write</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The identity of the fourth kingdom is a topic of great controversy which transcends  this verse as the theme of the four kingdoms is also found in Daniel (ch. 7), Zechariah (ch. 6) and Hosea (ch. 13) - their commentaries are therefore also relevant</li>\n<li>The midrashim consistently list Greece (Yavan) as the third kingdom and Rome (Romi) as the fourth</li>\n<li>This is followed by almost all commentators starting with R Saadiah Gaon (on Ibn Ezra in 2:40 - your question), Rambam and Ramban</li>\n<li>A notable exception is Ibn Ezra who is followed by Metzudos. This view holds that Rome is included in the third kingdom as relative to the Greeks. The Romans are considered to be the Kittim (Numbers 24:24, Daniel 11:30). The fourth kingdom according to Ibn Ezra is the Arab kingdom</li>\n<li>Ibn Ezra believes the Edomite exile (<em>galut Edom</em>) is a misnomer and that Rome has no intrinsic tie to Edom. Because the Edomites, age-old sworn enemies of the Jews, were the first to rejoice at Israel's destruction, the exile is called <em>galut Edom</em></li>\n<li>The view of the commentary attributed to R Saadiah is very unclear, he seems to lean towards Ibn Ezra's interpretation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ibn Ezra is using \"Aram\" to mean the nation of Rome, which he identifies with Greece (Yavan).</p>\n\n<p>His reasoning is that \"Kittim\" is the son of Yavan (Genesis 10:4). Onkelos to Numbers 24:24 translates Kittim as Romans, and Daniel 11:30, which refers to Kittim, is regarded as a prophecy about the Romans.</p>\n\n<p>He also identifies the Kittim with Rome on the authority of Yosef ben Guryon, presumably based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kittim#Account_in_Yosippon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this story</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As the peoples spread out, it says, the Kittim camped in Campania and built a city called \"Posomanga\", while descendants of Tubal camped in neighboring Tuscany and built \"Sabino\", with the Tiber river as their frontier. However, they soon went to war following the rape of the Sabines by the Kittim, who are correlated to the Romans. This war was ended when the Kittim showed the descendants of Tubal their mutual progeny. They then built cities called Porto, Albano, and Aresah. Later, their territory is occupied by Agnias, King of Carthage, but the Kittim end up appointing Zepho, son of Eliphaz and grandson of Esau, as their king, with the title Janus Saturnus. The first king of Rome, Romulus, is made in this account to be a distant successor of this line.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When he says that Aram still exists alongside Ishmael, he's referring to the Byzantine Empire, which still existed in his time, because the third and fourth kingdoms are simultaneous (Daniel 2:42).</p>\n\n\n",

Previously I had assumed their status was dependent on the principle they denied, so a person who denied the first 5 would be a min, 6 & 7 would be an apikores etc. However after reading this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71056/is-it-heretical-to-not-accept-the-writings-of-the-prophets-besides-of-moses\">Is it heretical to not accept the writings of the Prophets (besides of Moses)?</a> and the responses it seems apparent that a person who denies the 6th principle is not inherently an apikores.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To answer the question straight-on, Rambam writes regarding <em>all thirteen</em> of his principles: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When a person doubts [any] foundation among these foundations [i.e. his thirteen], he has left the community, denied the principle [i.e. God], and is called a <em>min</em> and a <em>epikores</em> and a cutter of shoots, and it is an obligation to hate him, and of him it is said \"shall I not hate those who hate You, God\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, although in Hil. Teshuva (Ch. 3) Rambam differentiates terminologically between those who deny various principles, the end result is the same.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, however, that the <em>reason why</em> such a person ends up denying any of the principles might play a role in the application of this severe consequence. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/48851/5083\">here</a> regarding someone who disbelieves but not out of rebellion (which is not exactly the question asked, but still), and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/48641/5083\">here</a> regarding disbelieving Jews who nevertheless live religiously committed lives, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93591/5083\">here</a> for one example of someone who is simply mistaken as to what the principles entail (an issue which is discussed more generally <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/38254/5083\">here</a>, in the name of R.

It does not follow from there that one would not be a heretic for denying something that is actually one of Rambam's principles, nor does it follow that any other rabbinic authorities agree.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not to say that it is necessarily true that one who denies one of Rambam's principles is a min/apikorus/kofer/heretic; rather, it is to say that there is no basis from the linked question to say that it is not true.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For reference, the Rambam’s list of 13 Ikkarim is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Belief in a G-d who created everything</li>\n<li>Belief in exactly one G-d who is unique like nothing else is</li>\n<li>Belief that G-d does not have a physical form</li>\n<li>Belief that G-d is first and last</li>\n<li>Belief that there is nothing else worth praying to</li>\n<li>Belief in prophecy</li>\n<li>Belief that Moshe Rabbeinu’s prophecy was qualitatively greater than any other prophet who ever lived</li>\n<li>Belief that the Torah we have today is the same Torah Moshe received on Har Sinai</li>\n<li>Belief that the Torah will never be changed</li>\n<li>Belief that G-d knows what goes on in this world</li>\n<li>Belief that G-d rewards good doers and punished evildoers</li>\n<li>Belief in the coming of Mashiach, in spite of his not coming for so long</li>\n<li>Belief in the future resurrection of the dead</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The Rambam himself actually lists 24 people who lose their share in the World to Come in Hilchos Teshuvah chapter 3. The list there is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>One who says there is no G-d who directs Creation</li>\n<li>One who says there are multiple gods</li>\n<li>One who says G-d takes a physical form</li>\n<li>One who says G-d did not create the world</li>\n<li>One who bows to an idol to separate between G-d and man</li>\n<li>One who denies the concept of prophecy</li>\n<li>One who contradicts the prophecy of Moshe Rabbeinu</li>\n<li>One who says G-d doesn’t know what happens on Earth</li>\n<li>One who says G-d did not give even a single passuk or a single word from the Torah, but rather Moshe wrote it on his own </li>\n<li>One who contradicts Torah SheBa’al Peh</li>\n<li>One who says that the Torah was changed, even a single Mitzvah of it</li>\n<li>Deniers of the Resurrection</li>\n<li>Deniers of Mashiach</li>\n<li>One who intentionally violates a particular mitzvah publicly and regularly in order to anger G-d</li>\n<li>One who assimilates during a time of persecution, saying that why should he remain Jewish when this people is being persecuted for doing so? Let me join the nations since they are the stronger party. </li>\n<li>One who intentionally causes the public to sin, regardless of the severity of the sin or the manner in which he does so</li>\n<li>One who separates from communal customs, who does not partake in their sorrows and fasts, but rather goes on his own way as if he was completely separate from them</li>\n<li>One who does Aveiros publicly and insolently, regardless of the severity of the sin</li>\n<li>One who hands over a fellow Jew to the non-Jewish authorities to be killed or attacked</li>\n<li>One who hands over a fellow Jew’s money to the non-Jewish authorities</li>\n<li>Those who put fear on the public not for the sake of Heaven</li>\n<li>Speakers of Loshon Hara</li>\n<li>Murderers</li>\n<li>One who “draws out” their orlah</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A simple comparison of the two lists indicates that principle 11 does not merit losing one’s position in the World to Come, while several actions on top of this list of beliefs could also merit losing one’s World to Come. [As Alex pointed out in the comments, while the text in Ani Maamin would seem to place principle 6 on this list as well, the actual text in the Rambam indicates that it’s the same as #6 in Hilchos Teshuvah.]</p>\n\n<p>As noted in the comments to the OP, this list is specifically according to the Rambam’s opinion. Others vary; the Raavad, for one, argues on several of these right there in Hilchos Teshuvah. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Watching Football (soccer) on TV on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This Shabbat afternoon England play a massive World Cup match that is obviously being broadcast on Television.  </p>\n\n<p>I understand that Poskim prohibit the watching of TV (without sound) on Shabbat primarily because it is not in the spirit of Shabbat as discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/65691/television-on-shabbos\">Television on Shabbos</a>  </p>\n\n<p>For many British Jews however, it will be more agonising and more likely to ruin their shabbat experience if they do not watch the game - however sad people may think that is, it is a reality.  Many will also resent the fact that it is Shabbat since it is preventing them from watching the game.  Is there any scope to therefore be lenient with regards to leaving the TV on from before Shabbat for those that will have their Shabbat experience ruined by not being able to watch the game and will be Plutzing for the last 6 hours of the day because they don't know the score?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The OP sounds like a Hashkafah (outlook) question and not a truly Halachic one. IMHO There are various opinions in Halachah on how a Rav should deal with a person, based on their level of observance, in such a situation. An individual Rabbi might be strict or lenient, depending on the (perceived spiritual) level and situation of the person asking this question. So someone should consult their Rabbi for a ruling.</p>\n\n<p>My answer will focus on my experience in Hashkafah with this type of question.</p>\n\n<p>When I was in high school, R' Akiva Greenberg of Vishnitz taught me that one aspect of the benefit of Shabbos is that Hashem gave us the gift of being in control of our own life. We could be slaves, but Shabbos frees us. He gave an example: Most people will by habit answer a ringing phone. The phone rings and we run so we don't miss a call. Its \"important\". Shabbos comes in and says: \"Nothing is more important than owning yourself.\" So for instance on Shabbos the phone rings and we realize it doesn't matter at all; because our lives are more important and whatever it is can just wait. There is a G-d watching over us and nothing is that important (unless its saving a human life; which G-d has asked us to be involved with Him in case it comes up. This is not because G-d \"needs us\" to save someone, but because He wants us to do what's truly important).</p>\n\n<p>He told me that when he was a boy, Rockafeller center's building would close for business one day a year (which did not fall out on any holiday at all). The reason the owner gave for this was: \"I want to show that we own this building, and therefore we decided one day a year we close.\"</p>\n\n<p>The most important way to exercise \"ownership\" and to \"be your own boss\" is to exercise the power of NOT using something. Shabbos is the gift that teaches us just that. Are you proud of your hobby, or does your hobby own you? If your favorite show is on, do you have to watch it? Really? Why? You may want to watch it, and it may be good to have fun sometimes and enjoy life by tasting all kinds of good things and experiences... but not if you MUST, or else you will have withdrawal symptoms or resent missing it. Then it owns you. Really, you need to own it.</p>\n\n<p>Shabbos teaches you that your time, your friends, your family, and your own growth and ability to own your mind and heart, are of the greatest importance.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the teaching is that even if the game fell out on a Wednesday night, its still ok to \"miss it\" if you realize you do have something of greater value to accomplish instead. OR You may watch the game and enjoy, as long as it was your choice that time and you can easily miss the next one if you need to; because you are more important than any game.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The OP says: \"those that will have their Shabbat experience ruined by not being able to watch the game\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Actually, no ... <strong>They will have their Shabbat experience ruined if they DO watch the game!</strong> Their game experience will also be more enjoyable if they willingly detach from it for more important things. That way when they do watch, they own the game time; so its more enjoyable. This is because enjoyment from choice feels more satisfying than enjoyment from fulfilling addiction.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, the OP says: \"and will be Plutzing for the last 6 hours of the day because they don't know the score?\"</p>\n\n<p>So since the case is that they can spend Shabbos afternoon without having non-Jewish neighbors run around informing everyone in the streets about the score, then not knowing is fine. Just pre-tape, the game, or watch a re-run on the internet after Shabbos, without asking about the score. Then it will be just as if you watched it a few hours earlier, just without all the commercials!</p>\n\n<p>Get a designated person to volunteer to take care of recording it and have a Sat. night party at his house with pretzels and beer.</p>\n\n\n",

Since they provide one minority opinion which differs, it is a question best answered <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">by your rav</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hazal enacted this prohibition forbidding boarding a ship within a few\n  days of Shabbat because doing so will likely interfere with one's\n  \"Oneg Shabbat\" – the enjoyment of Shabbat. It often takes several days\n  to accustom oneself to sea travel and overcome seasickness, and so the\n  Sages forbade boarding a ship too close to Shabbat in order to ensure\n  that one will be comfortable and at ease on Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>Interestingly, Rabbi Moshe Halevi (Israel, 1961-2001), in his work\n  Menuhat Ahava (1:2), raises the possibility that this enactment of\n  Hazal might not apply nowadays, when boats are very large and stable.\n  Furthermore, most people who travel on cruises are accustomed to sea\n  travel and thus do not become seasick. Nevertheless, the vast majority\n  of Halachic authorities dispute this position and forbid boarding a\n  ship after Tuesday (or Wednesday), unless one travels for the purpose\n  of performing a Misva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/en/default.aspx?HalachaID=3218\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more details and the views of the Rif and Rambam - aligned with the above.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishna Brura Orach Chaim 248 which discusses all of the questioners problems.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה המחבר אף שנמשך בס\"ב אחר הרי\"ף שהעתיק פירושו מ\"מ גם הוא ס\"ל כהפוסקים דקודם ג' ימים שרי אף במקום שיצטרך אח\"כ לבוא לידי חילול שבת ע\"י מלאכה וכמ\"ש ס\"ד [ועיין במה שכתבנו שם] אלא דס\"ל דאף אי לא היה בו שום חשש מלאכה ותחומין [כגון שהיא כולה של א\"י דכשנעשה בה מלאכה מסתמא אדעתיה דא\"י נעשה וגם היא במקום שעמוק יותר מעשרה טפחים דאין בזה משום איסור תחומין להרבה פוסקים וכדלקמן בסימן ת\"ד ע\"ש] אפ\"ה אסור משום ביטול עונג שבת לחוד</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch holds that one can travel more than 3 days before Shabbos on a boat even though he might be forced to save his life by doing a Melacha as he is used to the rocking of the boat.\n  However from Wednesday onward one cannot travel on a boat (unless for the sake of a Mitzva) because he is distressed by the jerking of the boat.<br>\n  Even though<br>\n  1.

I am prohibited from walking ~1 mile past the limits of the city where I was located on Friday night. If you are a good walker and/or live near the edge of your city, you could violate <em>Techum</em> just by walking a lot!</p>\n\n<p>So a bus all over Brooklyn would remain within the city limits and thus (in and of itself) within <em>Techum</em>. (A Greyhound bus from St. Louis to Chicago, on the other hand, would violate <em>Techum.</em>) Embarking on almost any ship is bound to violate <em>Techum</em>, unless it is staying very, very close to the shoreline of an inhabited area the whole time (e.g. a yacht circumnavigating Manhattan). </p>\n\n<p>(For this reason, if a ship was far out from land at dusk on Friday, then arrives into port <em>on</em> Shabbos morning, the \"home city\" of the passengers is now the ship, and they are prohibited from disembarking on Shabbos as that also would be a case of breaking <em>Techum</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>There are other issues, as other answers referenced -- seasickness; the likelihood someone would need to save your life if something went wrong -- but the clear difference between bus and boat (in most cases) is <em>Techum.</em> </p>\n\n\n",

He points to Jubilees 16:26 and 21:24 for this. Admittedly, this is a weak reason, since there are also many metaphors related to planting in the Bible and liturgy.

Hence, his grandson had not heard about it, because it was specific for a certain group at a certain time.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, most people kept using that targum, and as time passed, more layers were added to the targum, but at its core, it preserves at least part of the original from the time of the tannaim. He notes that there isn't really any way to approximate the date of the creation of this targum, which is one of the signs that it's old - later targums were heavily midrashic in character. This targum does have midrashic interpretations, but in manuscripts, scribes differentiated between the midrashic additions and the older, more p'shat targum with the letters ת\"א (targum Iyov).</p>\n\n\n",

If so, why does it say “seven days”? To make it up. How do I know that if you didn’t bring the Chagigah on the first day of Sukkos that you can bring it all throughout the Regel and even the last day [i.e. Shmini Atzeres]? The passuk says, “In the seventh month shall you celebrate it.” If it’s from “the seventh month,” I might have thought it’s for all of the seventh month; therefore the passuk says, “it” - it do you celebrate, but not separate from it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, we learn Sukkos from the passuk of וחגותם אותו, and we learn Pesach from a Gezeirah Shavah from Sukkos. </p>\n\n\n",

Sifrei Bamidbar 135). (Alhatorah translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ralbag there elaborates and provides potential reasons why Moshe would have wanted to see it, namely that Moshe had heard a good report of it, and wanted to see some of that firsthand.</p>\n<p>Another answer (given by Shadal to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/27.13#e0n7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bamidbar 27:13</a>, and by Ibn Caspi to Devarim 3:27) is that this was a way of showing Moshe that he did not waste his efforts in bringing the nation to this point.</p>\n<p>Minchas Yehuda to Devarim 3:27 provides a very original thought, noting that God had sworn that none of those that despised him would see the land (Bamidbar 14:23).

Moshe had asked אֶעְבְּרָה נָּ֗א וְאֶרְאֶה֙ אֶת־הָאָ֣רֶץ הַטּוֹבָ֔ה to cross over and to see the land. God responded by allowing him to see the land even though he would be unable to cross over into it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וראה בעיניך. בקשתה ממני ואראה את הארץ הטובה אני מראה לך את כולה שנאמר\n  ויראהו ה' את כלא הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Bechor Shor</a> explains that Moshe asked to cross and to see the land. God responded that He did not want to deny Moshe everything, so even though he would not cross, if he wants to see the land he can see it from the mountain:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואם תאב אתה לראות שא עיניך וראה מכאן כי איני רוצה להשיב פניך מכל וכל\n  אתה שואל לעבור ולראות הראיה תהיה לך ולא העברה שהרי עיקר שאילתך מפני\n  הראיה כי לא תעבור והראה לו הקב\"ה הכל דכתיב ויראהו ה' את כל הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caspi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Ibn Kaspi</a> writes that seeing the land was good for Moshe. After he worked so hard to get them there, if he didn't merit to enter it he at least merited to see it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושא עיניך. בעבור שמשה עמל בהעם הזה וכלה ימיו בם להכניסם לארץ לקח לו\n  נחת רוח בראותו בעיניו הארץ ההיא אחר שלא זכה לקחתה זכה לראותה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Deuteronomy.34.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> in his commentary says <em>Parshas V'Zos HaBracha</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.34.1?lang=bi&aliyot=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 34:1</a>) the following:</p>\n<p>(<em>Source provided by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria.org</a></em>)</p>\n<p>(<em>Partial Quote</em>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וטעם המראה הזאת אשר הראהו בעבור שהיתה הארץ מלאה כל טוב צבי לכל הארצות ומאשר היה גלוי לפניו רוב האהבה שהיה משה רבינו אוהב את ישראל שמחו ברבות הטובה בראות עיניו:</p>\n<p><em>The reason for [G-d] showing [Moshe Rabbeinu the land] because the land was filled with all that was good and pleasurable than all other lands, and being that it was known before Him [i.e. G-d] that Moshe Rabbeinu loved [the people of] Israel, he would be happy with seeing the great good [which G-d would be giving to the people of Israel] with his own eyes</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hope this is insightful!!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any extant communities that would not eat meat from the hindquarters, even expertly porged?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a prohibition to eat from the sciatic nerve of an animal (<em>gid hanasheh</em>) as well as certain fats from a domesticated animal (<em>cheilev</em>). Before meat can be eaten, these must be removed via a process called <em>nikkur</em> (Hebrew) / <em>treibering</em> (Yiddish) / porging (English). See e.g. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23312/what-is-kosher-meat/23313#23313\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/47791/are-we-not-supposed-to-eat-fat/47792#47792\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>As this process is time-consuming and difficult, in most Ashkenazic communities (at least outside of Israel) the entire hindquarters of the animal are instead sold to the non-kosher market.</p>\n\n<p>Despite the relatively widespread belief that Ashkenazic Jews may never eat hindquarter meat, it would seem that the mainstream opinion is that they are in fact permitted to, if the <em>nikkur</em> has been performed by an expert as required. See e.g. <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/machshava/tzarich-iyun/tzarich_iyun_nikkur_achoraim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> by R. Dr. Ari Zivotofsky.</p>\n\n<p>However, as noted in that article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The practice of some communities to refrain from eating hindquarters, owing to the difficulty in excising the forbidden sections, continues to exist among both Ashkenazim and Sephardim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is, are there communities out there today where this practice has the status of a full-fledged <em>minhag hamakom</em> (local custom) such that they would always forbid hindquarter meat, even where the <em>nikkur</em> was correctly carried out by an expert?</p>\n\n<p>One source that I am aware of is R.

    "content": "# Did Aaron have daughters?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We are reading this Shabat parshat Pinchas. In this parsha the Torah mentioned the daughters of Tzelofchad as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצלפחד בן חפר לא היו לו בנים כי אם בנות ושם בנות צלפחד מחלה ונעה חגלה\n  מלכה ותרצה (Bamidbar 26:33)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ותקרבנה בנות צלפחד בן חפר בן גלעד בן מכיר בן מנשה למשפחת מנשה בן יוסף\n  ואלה שמות בנתיו מחלה נעה וחגלה ומלכה ותרצה (Bamidbar 27:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Parshat Pinchas tells us also that Tzelofchad had no sons, only daughters (Bamidbar 26:33). </p>\n\n<p>It is interesting to note that there are no extra words (but the letter Vav) in between the names of Tzelofchad's daughters, whereas, still in the same parsha, the word את is found before each of Aaron's sons' names:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויולד לאהרן את נדב ואת אביהוא את אלעזר ואת איתמר (Bamidbar 26:60)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Midrash (Bereshit Rabba 22:2) gives an explanation for the words את in Bereshit 4:1, as twin sisters were born with Kayin and Evel. </p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know if the Talmud/Chazal/Midrash/Kabbalah make such a drasha on the words את in the case of the Aaron's sons? What does the Torah want to tell us here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Firstly, a similar Drash is made on the Shevatim, that they also had twin sisters born with them.  However, I searched and did not find anyone who makes this Derasha here for Aharon.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In a short Shu\"t sefer of Rav Chaim Kanievski's, an asker bothers him repeatedly asking how it could be possible that Moshe and Aharon had no daughters, and were thus not Mekayem the Mitzvah of Peru Urvu.  Rav Kanievski responds by saying that Aharon had daughters, and I believe he quoted one of the following two similar Pesukim as proof, where Hashem is speaking to Aharon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְזֶה־לְּךָ֞ תְּרוּמַ֣ת מַתָּנָ֗ם לְכׇל־תְּנוּפֹת֮ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵל֒ לְךָ֣ נְתַתִּ֗ים וּלְבָנֶ֧יךָ <strong>וְלִבְנֹתֶ֛יךָ</strong> אִתְּךָ֖ לְחׇק־עוֹלָ֑ם כׇּל־טָה֥וֹר בְּבֵיתְךָ֖ יֹאכַ֥ל אֹתֽוֹ׃ (Bamidbar 18:11)</p>\n<p>כֹּ֣ל׀ תְּרוּמֹ֣ת הַקֳּדָשִׁ֗ים אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָרִ֥ימוּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֮ לַֽי״י֒ נָתַ֣תִּֽי לְךָ֗ וּלְבָנֶ֧יךָ <strong>וְלִבְנֹתֶ֛יךָ</strong> אִתְּךָ֖ לְחׇק־עוֹלָ֑ם בְּרִית֩ מֶ֨לַח עוֹלָ֥ם הִוא֙ לִפְנֵ֣י י״י֔ לְךָ֖ וּלְזַרְעֲךָ֥ אִתָּֽךְ׃ (Bamidbar 18:19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite the simple meaning not being that it is referring to Aharon's literal daughters, but rather to those who marry in as well as future generations, Rav Chaim felt that this proved that he had daughters.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is a Jew allowed to marry a non-observant Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is a Jew allowed to marry another Jew who is generally unconcerned with observing Judaism?</p>\n\n<p>On one hand, the first Jew's observance could be negatively affected by the second Jew's non-observance, and there could be other complications in the marriage if there are differing observance levels. On the other hand, marrying another Jew ensures that the non-observant Jew won't marry a non-Jew and produce non-Jewish or assimilated Jewish descendants.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As cited above, the Shulchan Aruch advises against it. The Mishna in Kesubos talks about divorce if it's discovered that a spouse is non-observant, and/or the non-observance is affecting the observant spouse. (More on that in a moment.) </p>\n\n<p>Let's start with two important points here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Never go into a marriage thinking \"I am saving this person from something worse.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>Never go into a marriage thinking \"I am going to change this person.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(Let's also remember the Gemara says don't go into a marriage that is likely to lead to resentment; \"love your neighbor like yourself\" applies to your spouse too.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Rabbi Mordechai Willig shlit\"a has a YUTorah mp3 on <em>Kibud Av V'em</em> where he addresses the obligation of respect (broadly) towards a non-observant parent. In the course of that, he remarks: <em>Chazal also say you have to respect your spouse. Today it would be scandalous, but not long ago it was not uncommon -- suppose one spouse is observant and the other isn't; does that mean he doesn't have to respect her (or vice versa?)</em></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The really big questions that will need to be asked are how the kids will be raised, and what about things that affect the other spouse -- most notably \"family purity\" and \"is the food in our kitchen kosher?\" (This can get a drop trickier when we address the question of \"can I trust a person who doesn't keep kosher to keep my plates kosher?\") </p>\n\n<p>Long story short: it's generally not the greatest idea, but with a lot of agreement and planning, it could be doable. There doesn't seem to be a clear thou-shalt-not against it. The least-problematic scenario would be something like a second marriage in which the kids are out of the house and Nida is no longer a biological concern. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is the Halacha in the Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 2,6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לעולם ישתדל אדם לישא בת תלמיד חכם ולהשיא בתו לתלמיד חכם. לא מצא בת תלמיד חכם, ישא בת גדולי הדור. לא מצא בת גדולי הדור, ישא בת ראשי כנסיות. לא מצא בת ראשי כנסיות, ישא בת גבאי צדקה. לא מצא בת גבאי צדקה, ישא בת מלמדי תינוקות, ואל ישיא בתו לעם הארץ:<br>\n   הגה: ועל בנותיהן הוא אומר: ארור שוכב עם בהמה. וכל זה בעם הארץ שאינו מדקדק במצוות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically there is a whole list of preferred Jewish girls and it is seriously not recommended to marry a woman from a non orthodox background <strong>who acts like her background</strong> (it is not in your power to change someone as they were given free will) unless of course she now keeps the Mitzvot in which case it is perfectly fine.* </p>\n\n<p>*ולא בכל עם הארץ אלא במי שהוא חשוד לעבור<br>\nThe Tur Beit Yosef says that this only applies to those who are suspect to transgressing Mitzvot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Anyone can achieve a return or teshuva to G-'s holy name.

    "content": "# Is there a halacha or minhag that says that Duchenin should not be done in perfect harmony?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Considering <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37124/5275\">this answer</a> which cites a halacha that Cohanim must duchen together, I'm curious as to why so many shuls that I have attended throughout many years seem to have a group of Cohanim that don't coordinate the duchenin. The Cohanim are not all singing the same tune, they're not in the same tempo, and there are one or two Cohanim that say the last word of each verse a bit after the rest of the group so it sounds like there's an echo. I know that the Levi'im had a choir in the Bet Hamikdash, and they had a conductor. I assume that they had some type of rehearsal, or even if not, they were better coordinated. At least there's a precedence for nice music during tefillah. I would think that Cohanim would care to sound coordinated, at least, if not on tune, as well.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some reason as to why it is this way? Is it a lack of knowing the halacha or carelessness? Why does this happen consistently?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This happens in communities where the mesorah has been lost. This loss is especially prevalent in Ashkenazi communities where the education of the children is expected to be handed off to a school or organization.</p>\n\n<p>In communities where the father is still expected to (and does) educate their own children religiously, you don't have the situation you just described. Because it's typically considered the job of the Kohein to pass on his blessing and melody to his children. For example, here is a recording from a Yemenite community : <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO-_kCmoFz8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LO-_kCmoFz8</a>\nIn this community, all of the Kohanim have the exact same melody and they move through the blessing together as a unit.</p>\n\n<p>Note: It may sound like the Kohanim are a tiny bit out of tune, but this is part of the normal tonality expected in Yemenite communities. They will often sing together in fifths apart, and be just slightly out of tune on those fifths to give it an otherworldly sound. But if you listen to them, they are moving in the same time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is part of the normal tonality expected in Askenazic communities. They don't mind a slight dissonance as part of their communal melodies. They don't see great importance in perfection of tone unity as an integral part of Serving Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I agree with @Aaron.</p>\n<p>We should expect tuneful singing in Duchenen. But the kohanim have to learn the tunes.</p>\n<p>The German-Jewish (Yekke) congregations have special tunes for each Yom Tov.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://breuers2gether.com/audio/nusach-from-the-uk-duchenen-shavuos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> are two poor quality recordings of the tunes for Shovuos.

Does it matter if she was reform converted in the past and then married in a civil ceremony?</p>\n\n<p>***I am not necessarily considering this for myself. I want to convert to Orthodox Judaism, but am not sure if my husband will be willing to take that step. If he's not, then I'll consider. I just want to convert, and don't know all the ramifications to that. Reason I ask is there's two school age children involved, so they would be affected. I do know this is an incredibly complex answer, so I've been researching everything I can PLUS I will be conversing with a Rabbi if my husband is willing (excluding him if he's not). I guess my main questions are what options would I possibly have in this situation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>It sounds like whoever's asking this question is going through a great deal of upheaval of a both personal and religious nature, and would greatly benefit from speaking with a competent rabbi in-person.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, let's address the theory here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>First off, Judaism allows for divorce -- for both Jews (under Halacha) and non-Jews (under Noachide Law). A divorcee is not a sinner or a leper or whatnot.</p></li>\n<li><p>Being divorced in and of itself makes no difference as far as the rules of conversion per se, but in all cases of conversion, the rabbinic panel will ask questions such as \"are there people in your life who will make your observance of mitzvos difficult?\" If there is an ex still in the picture, or children with joint custody, or children around who are old enough to object to <em>kosher</em> or <em>Shabbat</em>, the rabbis will need to understand that better. They wouldn't be doing a convert any favors converting them if two weeks later, halacha is driving a wedge between them and their family. </p></li>\n<li><p>If a parent converts, the children do not automatically become Jewish; they need their own conversions. If the children are young and all parents fully supportive, the process to add in the children isn't very complicated.</p></li>\n<li><p><em>Generally</em> speaking, a Reform conversion is not considered halachic conversion according to Orthodox rabbis, so that would be  makes no difference <em>per se.</em> It would be the same as if it's someone who'd never seen Judaism before.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Again, the interpersonal dynamics can get complicated. Suppose two years ago, the parents signed a divorce agreement whereby both of them would meet with the kids at Lenny's Kosher-Style Restaurant for a one-hour Passover Seder, followed by bowling. And that met everyone's religious needs at the time. Now if one parent demands the kids spend a four-hour seder at their house and spend the night ... that can cause a lot of friction ... and if God forbid that goes back in front of a judge, it will get very messy.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>In short: there are certainly no laws against a divorcee converting; but please consult a good rabbi in-person about how that would actually play out and what's the best way to proceed in your particular case.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

This verse indicates that if a woman dies and the one who struck her is liable to receive the death penalty, he is exempt from payment. This is known as the principle of קים ליה בדרבה מיניה. Since one who rapes a married woman is liable to receive the death penalty, he does not pay any monetary restitution.</p>\n\n<p>What about the case where he doesn't actually receive the death penalty, such as when the witnesses didn't warn him, or in today's times where the death penalty isn't administered? This is learned out by Tanna Devei Chizkiya (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.35a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesubos 35a</a>), that if a capital crime was committed, even if the punishment wasn't administered, the person is exempt from monetary payment.

    "content": "# How was Elazar HaKohen allowed to marry the daughter of Puti (Yisro)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi (quoting Sanhedrin 82b) states that Pinchas' mother was the daughter of Puti (Yisro). We know that  a kohen may not marry a convert (Shulchan Aruch Even Haezer 6,8), and if a kohen does marry a convert his children are not considered kohanim. Because of this, how could Pinchas have been a kohen? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Gemara in Yevamos 60b asks almost exactly the same question about Pinchas marrying one of the midyanite girls after capture from war:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא ר' שמעון בן יוחי אומר גיורת פחותה מבת שלש שנים ויום אחד כשירה לכהונה שנאמר (במדבר לא, יח) וכל הטף בנשים אשר לא ידעו משכב זכר החיו לכם והרי פנחס עמהם\n  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochanan said a Giyores that converted to Judaism under the age of 3 is permitted to marry a kohen as it says the girls you shall keep for yourselves and Pinchos was among them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this the daughter of Yisro could have converted under the age of 3.</p>\n\n<p>However as we pasken like Rabbi Eliezer Ben Yaakov in that gemora who says that 1 parent must be a Yisroel and 1 can be a convert, one of Elazars wifes parents was from the tribe of Yosef and the other was from Yisro so everything is fine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Since Pinchas was born before Yetzias Mitzraim, Elazar was not a kohen at the time of his marriage. Additionally, Aharon and his children were explicitly appointed to the kehuna by Hashem, as was Pinchas. Thus the rules you reference would have applied only to <strong>their</strong> children, not to them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi Bamidbar 25:13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והיתה לו. בריתי זאת: ברית כהנת עולם. שאף על פי שכבר נתנה כהנה לזרעו של אהרן, לא נתנה אלא לאהרן ולבניו, שנמשחו עמו ולתולדותיהם שיולידו אחר המשחתן, אבל פנחס שנלד קודם לכן ולא נמשח, לא בא לכלל כהנה עד כאן. וכן שנינו בזבחים (קא, ב) לא נתכהן פנחס עד שהרגו לזמרי: ‏\n  Based on Gemara zvachim 101b</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Pinehas was already born (the Gemara's statement) when Elazar received the kehuna, we can logically infer that  Elazar  was already married before this event.</p>\n\n\n",

It is discussed by Zedekiah the Physician (identified on page 66 as a contemporary of Isaiah of Trani, both living in the 13th century). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Zedekiah also reports that \"there was once an incident in Lorraine [where it was customary to refrain from eating on Sabbath afternoons], and there was danger [because the fast of Yom Kippur was to begin at sundown], and it was only with difficulty that permission was granted to eat on the eve of Yom Kippur just before the service began.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A page later, Wieseltier writes that Mordecai ben Hillel (Germany, 13th century) records that \"it was Jacob Tam's father -- Meir Ben Samuel, or Meir the Venerable, who was married to Rashi's daughter and was one of the earliest Tosafists, or glossators on the Talmud -- who reported the incident in Lorraine, which must have occureed in the eleventh century.\"</p>\n\n<p>There is no specific date given for the unsourced anecdote (and I don't have Zedekiah's original text to check in) but a quick look <a href=\"http://judaisme.sdv.fr/histoire/historiq/anglais/history.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">online</a> shows that the Jewish community of Lorraine dates to AFTER the time of the gemara.</p>\n\n<p>If this anecdote is accurate, the community in Lorraine, many hundreds of years after the <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1143\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">calendar</a> assured that \"lo adu rosh\" had a situation where Yom Kippur was on a Saturday night/Sunday.</p>\n\n<p>Is the anecdote wrong or were there communities that didn't abide by the fixed calendar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The calendar we use today was established in the Jewish year 4119.

Others say that it is permitted if he (the borrower, the second lender) does not lend him (back) for a longer time than he (the first lender) lent him.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for the first opinion is, since the first loan is given with a condition that the lender receives in payment the principle of the loan itself, and additionally he should also receive a future loan from the current borrower. This second loan is considered ribbis (interest) on the first loan.</p>\n\n<p>Question:</p>\n\n<p>The management of a company with a large employee body decided to divide their paydays into two separate payroll groups. Half of the employees receive their paychecks on Friday at the end of the first and last week of every month, and the other half get paid on Friday at the end of the second and third (middle) week(s) of the month.</p>\n\n<p>Two of the employees (with equal salaries), who were not in the same payrol group, decided to make an agreement between themselves as follows: On each payday, the employee who gets paid on that day, would share half his payment with the other employee. Thus, on each payday, each of the two employees would keep half of their salary and share half with his fellow employee.</p>\n\n<p>According to the first opinion cited by the <em>Rema</em> is this permitted? Is the half of each salary shared with the coworker considered a loan given with a condition to pay it back the following week, and additionally to receive a return loan from him the third week, to be returned on the fourth payday etc.</p>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it is just an agreement between the two employees that each one would only take half of his salary every week and have the other half paid to his coworker for his work.</p>\n\n<p>Would it depend on whether the whole salary was first given to one employee, and he forwarded (by a pre-arranged agreement) to his co-worker, or if (by request of the two employees) half of each week's salary was forwarded directly from the employer to each of the two employees? Is the employer considered a messenger of each employee to lend half of his salary to his co-worker, and thus it might be forbidden even if the pay is given directly from the employer to each employee, or is each employee a messenger of the employer to pay his fellow co-worker every week, and thus it would be permitted even if the whole amount was first given to one employee and was given by him to his coworker? ) </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When were these fasts observed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Tur (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2638\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Orach Chayim 580</a>), quoting the Bahag (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20341&st=&pgnum=460\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Laws of the Ninth of Av</a>), gives a list of days on which to fast. This list is copied or mentioned by some other rishonim (as quoted in the footnote to the Bahag: <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31467&st=&pgnum=11&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eshkol part 2 p. 9</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41293&st=&pgnum=310\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shibolei Haleket 278</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8920&st=&pgnum=130\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tanya 62</a>, Seder Rav Amram 34a, part 2 74a (?), <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9377&st=&pgnum=437\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Machzor Vitri 271</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15217&st=&pgnum=241\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kol Bo 63</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Some sources (e.g. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2939\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magen Avraham</a>) say the list comes from Megilat Ta'anit, but this appears to be incorrect. Although they are written in the style of Megilat Ta'anit, all the dates are in Hebrew, not Aramaic as Megilat Ta'anit is, and the response of the ge'onim (quoted in the Shibolei Haleket and Tanya) also implies that Megilat Ta'anit is separate from it. And the death of Tanna'im is also mentioned in the list, making the second century the earliest possible date, at least for its final form.</p>\n\n<p>The response from the ge'onim that shows that they didn't know who decreed these fasts. The Beit Yosef says about them that he never saw anyone observing any of the fasts, and expresses surprise that some of them are on Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n\n<p>My question is: Apart from the question to the ge'onim, is there any sign that these fasts were actually observed at some earlier point (not necessarily the entire list, but excluding 17 Tamuz, 9 Av, 3 Tishrei, 10 Tevet)? Are <em>any</em> of the days mentioned as having been a day on which someone fasted in any of the sources, especially before the time of the ge'onim?</p>\n\n<p>I ask because Josephus (<a href=\"https://pace.webhosting.rug.nl/york/york/showText?book=14&chapter=4&textChunk=nieseSection&chunkId=58&up.x=14&up.y=13&up=up&text=anti&version=whiston&direction=up&tab=comm&layout=split\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Antiquities 14.4.3</a>) mentions a fixed fast in the third month (apparently in Sivan). Some (William Whiston in the footnote there, and <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=iRU2AQAAMAAJ&lpg=PA185&hl=iw&pg=PA186#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this book</a> I found through searching) suggest dates from this list as the fast he mentions. However, if the dates never appears until the ge'onim, it seems unlikely he was referring to them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I happened to find a similar list of fast days in the Chronology of Ancient Nations (<a href=\"https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.282084/2015.282084.The-Chronology#page/n285/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter 14</a>) of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Biruni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Al-Biruni</a>. Many of the fast days are given on the authority of a Jew Ya'qub ben Musa al-Niqrisi from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorgan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jurjan</a>. This would seem to demonstrate that these fasts were observed by Persian Jews in the 10th century. If we assume the fasting predated the list of fasts, then accounting for the lifetime of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Kayyara\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">author of Halachot Gedolot</a> would seemingly imply that the fasts were observed at least in the eighth to tenth centuries. The fast days are characterized as \"voluntary\" (p. 270), which is in sharp contrast with the list given by the rishonim which refers to these fasts as coming \"from the Torah.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another list, found in an inscription in a synagogue in Beth Shean from the fifth-seventh centuries, is described <a href=\"https://museum.imj.org.il/journal/archive/images/Haggai%20Misgav.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> by Haggai Misgav. It has much fewer dates, but is interesting in that it comes from Israel rather than Babylon, and seems to be earlier than the others. The author of the article judges it to be reflective of an actual practice because of its practicality (it doesn't give reasons for the dates as the other lists or piyyutim do, and because it records more than one fast day per month, which seems more reflective of a practice than of a scheme; the latter reason would also be valid for the list in Halachot Gedolot)</p>\n\n<p>The differences in date between the Tur, Al-Biruni, and the inscription:</p>\n\n<pre><code>             T  AB  I\n             ----------\nTishrei      3   3  ?\n             5   5  5\n             7   7\nMarcheshvan  7   6* 5\nKislev       28  8# ?\nTevet            5\n             8   8\n             9   9\n             10  10\nShevat       5   5\n             23  23\nAdar         7   7\n             9   9\n             $   13\nNisan        1   1 \n             10  10\n             26      27\nIyyar        10  10\n                     18\n                     22\n             28  28\nSivan        23  23\n             25  25\n             27  27  27\nTammuz       17  17  17\n                     27\nAv           1   1   ?\n             9   9   9\n             18  28\n             25  \nElul         17  7   5\n\n* or the Monday between 8th and 13th\n# or the Thursday between the 19th and 25th\n$ 13 mentioned in Tur Orach Chayyim 686\n? unclear\n</code></pre>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is one allowed to save someone with psychological disorders on Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Halacha is well-known: in general, one violates Torah prohibitions in order to save a life. I will specifically focus on Shabbos in this question, but the question can probably be extended if I can think of a relevant case. </p>\n\n<p>I see that the Shevet HaLevi (Shu”t 8:65) discusses a case where a critically ill person who asks for something to be done, and if it’s not his stress levels will increase, leading to things such as higher blood pressure, etc., which, for someone in his condition, could be life-threatening. He paskens that if there is a strong indication that he will die as a result of his wishes not being heeded, then one may do so (“יש רגלים לדבר שיכול לצמוח מזה ספק פקוח נפש״). Barring that, one may ask a non-Jew to perform the action for him. </p>\n\n<p>What is the Halacha regarding one who is suicidal? If someone is known to be suicidal, and he needs his medicine, which requires carrying through a reshus harabim (let’s say, and let’s say further that, for whatever reason, the patient can’t get it himself). Can this be compared to the Shevet HaLevi, in that it’s a psychological/emotional issue that leads to his death, or perhaps it’s different, in that the Shevet HaLevi’s case it happens on its own for physiological issues, whereas in this case it’s directly caused by the patient, with the psycholigical issues being the <em>motivation</em> rather than a <em>direct cause</em>? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Im Yirtzeh Hashem we should never find ourselves in this situation. May Hashem help those who are. </p>\n\n<p>This question was addressed by R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe Even Ha’Ezer 1:65) where he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובדבר אם הרופאים אומרים שאם תתענה תחזור לשטותה אם רשאה לאכול בי״כ פשוט שמותרת משום דשטות הוא סכנה, ואף שהמחלה עצמה לא תמיתנה אבל כיון שמצד המחלה אפשר שתמית עצמה ואת אחרים הוא ג״כ פקוח נפש</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding if doctors say that if a woman fasts she will return to her insanity, is she permitted to eat on Yom Kippur, it’s obvious that she should be allowed since insanity is considered a danger. While the ailment itself isn’t what’s killing her, since it’s because of the ailment that she could possibly kill herself or others, that’s also considered a danger to life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: while in this case it’s only the motivation rather than the direct cause, it is still permissible, since it’s because of the ailment that the patient is suicidal. </p>\n\n<p>R’ Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Shulchan Shlomo 328 note 6) writes similarly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולכן בהתפרצות או בהתקפה הרי זה פקוח נפש לכל דבר</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, regarding a psychotic outburst, this is considered a danger to life for all matters. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I originally came across this information in <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/halachos-of-refuah-on-shabbos.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Halachos of Refuah on Shabbos</em></a>, on pages 108-109, with footnote 123. </p>\n\n\n",

It was explained that the people of Sodom were punished because they rejected kindness. This principle is found in the words of the Rishonim.</p>\n<p>The Ramban wrote (Beresheit 6:13) about why the decree of the generation of the Flood was sealed specifically due to violence, \"And the reason is because it is a rational cause, and there is no need for a prophet to warn them, and furthermore, it is bad for Heaven and creatures.”</p>\n<p>Similarly, Rabbeinu Bachaye wrote about the people of Sodom (Beresheit 18:20), \"Because they were constant in this sin, therefore their judgment was decreed upon them, for there is no nation in the world that does not practice charity with each other, and the people of Sodom rejected it and were extremely cruel, and even though the Torah had not yet been given, charity is one of the rational commandments and it is abominable for a person to see his fellow in need while he is rich and satisfied and does not have compassion on him to sustain his life... therefore the Hashem destroyed them.\"</p>\n<p>However, the Rishoim did not establish an absolute rule to obligate Goyim in commandments beyond their seven commandments. They only sought to explain the conduct of Hashem who was angered by the nations when they multiplied in condemnation and acted in wickedness and cruelty even in matters for which they were not commanded. But there is no new law to be learned from their words concerning the Goyim being commanded in all rational commandments.</p>\n<p>However, the Netziv has a basis in his words from the Chizkuni (Beresheit 7:21), \"And if you say, how were the generations of the Flood punished since they were not commanded in commandments? Rather, it can be said that there are several commandments that people are obligated to observe due to the reasoning of the mind, even though they were not commanded, and therefore they were punished. Like Cain who was punished for shedding blood even though he was not commanded about it.\"</p>\n<p>It can be inferred from his words that indeed there are several commandments that people are obligated to observe due to the reasoning of the mind, even though they were not commanded about them. But even from his words, it seems that this is not a comprehensive and absolute rule, but rather there are several commandments that appear to have such a complete and simple rational basis, and only in those are they obligated even though they were not commanded.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is known the words of Rabbi Nissim Gaon in his introduction to Shas that all the inhabitants of the world were commanded in commandments that the intellect of man obligates them, which stem from the inclination of the heart, and he wrote according to his approach that this is what the sages said (in Masechet Hullin there), that the sons of Noah were commanded with 28 or 30 commandments.</p>\n<p>However, in my humble opinion, I have already written in Minchat Asher (Beresheit, Siman 43) that if not for his words I would have thought that a person is only obligated in what is commanded by Hashem and not to what he invents from his own knowledge and will. And even though I have elaborated in Minchat Asher (see Minchat Asher, Devarim, Siman 51) that besides the six hundred thirteen commandments, a person is obligated to do the will of Hashem, this is only in what he learned from the Torah itself, from its commandments or from the stories of the words of the Torah, and not in what the intellect obligates and has no source and root in the Torah. And furthermore, it seems from this that even if we accept things as they are, this is only for Goyim, but the Bnei Israel, who stood with their feet on Har Sinai, are certainly commanded only in what they were explicitly commanded and not in what is renewed by the feeling of the heart.</p>\n<p>And I was very pleased when I saw again that this is explicitly stated in the Sefer Haikarim of Rabbeinu Yosef Alebo, the great disciple of the Ra’an (3:7), \"And for this reason our sages said that at the beginning of creation, man was immediately commanded regarding the 7 commandments as explained in Tractate Sanhedrin... for without the command of G-d it is impossible for them to know the things that are pleasing to Hashem or those that are not pleasing. Cain was not punished for killing Hevel except because he transgressed the commandment of Hashem. And so too the generation of the Flood were punished for the violence that was in their hands, and the people of Sodom for their sin, and Pharaoh for the matter of Sarah the wife of Avraham, because all of them transgressed what Hashem commanded, but without this they would not have been punished.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, it appears to us that the generation of the Flood and the people of Sodom and Cain were not punished except because they transgressed the word of the Merciful One, and not because they transgressed a rational measure that is renewed from the inclination of the heart.\nAnd it is possible to add to this, as I elaborated at length (Minchat Asher, there), that besides the 613 commandments that the children of Israel were commanded, in them is included a general commandment for every man to do the will of Hashem, and many laws are based on the will of the Lord as we learned from the expositions of the Torah and from its commandments, so too Goyim, besides their 7 commandments, they are commanded with a general commandment to do the will of Hashem in all rational commandments.</p>\n<p>However, after the Torah was given, we only have the will of Hashem as it is revealed in the Torah and reflected from it, but before the Torah was given, the Creator of the Beginning created the world and enlightened the heart of man by nature to know good and evil and to choose life, and whoever condemns and violates the will of Hashem is judged. But it seems to Rabbi Nissim Gaon that just as we only have this Torah, so too Goyim only have their 7 commandments and what can be learned from them.\nI saw a sefer called דור רביעי להגאון ר' משה שמואל גלאזנר זצ\"ל בפתיחה באות ב, that the conduct of morality arising from the inclination of the heart of all humanity and accepted by all enlightened people imposes an obligation on all the world, including the children of Israel.</p>\n<p>However, he went further and diverged greatly, for he did not merely write that we are obligated in these commandments, and his opinion did not settle until he wrote that these commandments, which have no source in our holy Torah, are greater and more severe than the commandments written in the Torah. And these matters are not only lacking in a source, but they also have no place at all, and they are bewildering.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong>\nSo to conclude, if the prohibitions on opposite-gender clothing apply to gentiles under the Noahide laws, and we assume like the mefarshim (see mefarshim on Devarim 22:5) that the prohibitions on opposite-gender clothing is for the moral reason of separation of the sexes, then Rav Asher Weiss (who it wasn't clear to me from the article, but expresses his opinion in the video in the link (around 39:10)), agrees and follows like the Chizkuni, Ramban, Rabbeinu Bechaye, and the Netziv only with regard to the Goyim that they are also commanded in logical mitzvot which would include Lo tishlbash.</p>\n<p>Sorry for the lengthy answer :)</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If rishonim/acharonim frequently make mistakes in their zeal to critique others, can we still justify a belief in their singular devotion to truth?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was always taught that the great Torah scholars were as near-perfect human beings as could possibly be, particularly in their scholarly abilities, but perhaps even more so in their character traits pertaining to scholarship; that is to say that their only goal was the objective pursuit of truth, and they did not care for the honor of producing a novel idea or the victory in refuting an opponent.</p>\n\n<p>This was often illustrated by quoting Talmudic passages where there is a dispute between two amoraim and one of them brings a proof to the position of his opponent. What greater example of selfless devotion to the truth could there be?</p>\n\n<p>But it turns out that there are a lot of sources that indicate that this was not in fact always the case. Specifically, a whole bunch of acharonim leveled accusations against earlier acharonim, and even rishonim, claiming that in their zeal to critique their opponents they made a mistake or misunderstood or distorted something. This seems to be acknowledging that there was an ulterior motive (of critiquing others) that overpowered (perhaps unconsciously) the singular quest for the truth. What follows are several such accusations, with my translations:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19570&st=&pgnum=148\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Avodas Hagershuni # 84</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם מלשון מכ\"ת משמע כאלו אין כאן מקום לקושיות של הרא\"בד כלל וכאלו טחו\n  עיניו מראות דברים פשוטים ונגלי' וחלילה לנו לומר כן על הרא\"בד שגם הוא\n  מאור עינינו ומפיו אנו חיים אך ורק מפני חשק ההשגה לפעמים הוא מגדיל\n  הענין וזה הוא אחד מהם שמן קושיות רפיות עשה דגושות</p>\n  \n  <p>However, from the language of His Honor it is implied as if there is\n  no room here for the questions of the Ra'avad at all, and as if he\n  blocked his eyes from seeing things that are obvious and revealed.

To answer your question I need to discuss this assumption.</p>\n\n<p>The key problem of it is the definition of the word \"truth\", which is commonly misunderstood by the religious vs the scientific world. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The scientific world is based on the \"de-Facto\" truth</strong> (אמת מארץ תצמח).

Since the Mitzvah of following the sages, their sayings become \"de-jure\" true, no matter what the reality is. Remember the תנורו של עכנאי dispute, where the sages explicitly said so - \"we don't care what the reality is - we rule our reality\". This is why it is so important to say who said that - because it is not THE truth, it's A truth, one of many (אלו ואלו דברי א' חיים).</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This distinction undermines your assumption because it is either </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"they are not devoted to THE truth\" or </li>\n<li>\"they are devoted to A truth (of their own)\".</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I hope I made it clear.</p>\n\n\n",

Anecdotally, I have heard of pregnant women being told not to fast at all, to fast until midday (<em>chatzot</em>) or to begin the fast but break it upon feeling even mild discomfort, when Tish'ah B'Av is postponed.</p>\n\n<p>Please bring sources (if they exist) that explicitly rule leniently where Tish'ah B'Av is postponed, or explicitly rule against such a position.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>The Tosefta (Taanit 2:12) cited in part in the Bavli (Pesachim 54b) says that pregnant and nursing women must fast on Tisha Bav (in contrast to other minor fast days). No distinction is made for a postponed fast. Such a ruling is uniformly accepted and documented in all the classical codes, including the Mishneh Torah (Taaniyot 5:10) and the Shulchan Arukh (OC 554:5).</p>\n\n<p>In general the laws of the postponed fast are exactly the same as any ordinary Tisha Bav. There are two Talmudic source which could indicate any degree of leniency for a postponed fast. The first (Megillah 5b) indicates that Rebbe for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/93520/759\">some reason</a> wanted to entirely skip Tisha Bav on years when it was pushed off, but that the Sages did not accept that position. The second (Eruvin 41a) tells of a certain family who had an annual Temple-related celebration on 10 Av who wouldn't complete the fast when it was pushed off to 10 Av. The Mordechai (Moed 630) quotes an opinion that the same should apply to the parties of a circumcision (father/Mohel/Sandek) occurring on a postponed fast on 10 Av since that day is a personal holiday for them. The Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%98_%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 559:9</a>) rules accordingly that the parties of a circumcision can break their fast after Mincha on 10 Av.</p>\n\n<p>In the last few hundred years some rabbis have found room for leniency for pregnant women based on this. </p>\n\n<p>Rav <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ovadiah Yosef</a> is the first person I'm aware of in history to argue that pregnant women are entirely exempt from fasting on a postponed Tisha Bav. He argued that since on an ordinary minor fast day pregnant women are exempt but parties of a circumcision are obligated, in this case where parties of a circumcision are exempt all the more so must pregnant women be exempt. (See Yabia Omer OC 5:40)</p>\n\n<p>There are many problems with his argument. First, many Rishonim (including the Rambam and Rif) do not cite the Talmud in Eruvin about personal holidays overriding a postponed Tisha Bav, and indeed many Acharonim dispute that the Halakha follows the view brought in the Shulchan Arukh (see Magen Avraham and Shaarei Keneset Hagedola about the custom in Turkey, Pe'ulath Tsaddiq <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1718&pgnum=91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:147</a> about Yemen, <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%98#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%98_%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%A3_%D7%98\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Arukh haShulchan</a> about Eastern Europe, that \"we have neither seen nor heard anyone act on this [and break their fast for a circumcision]... such is the custom and one should not change it\").</p>\n\n<p>Second, even those who are lenient for a circumcision generally limit it to after Mincha when one has already mostly fasted (cf. Shaarei Teshuva OC 559 sk 7). Only the Chemed Moshe (562:1) allowed having the circumcision earlier in the day and breaking the fast then. (Regarding a circumcision the Magen Avraham quotes two opinions whether it can happen at 6.5 hours or 9.5 hours into the day, and recommends being strict, though many are lenient.) Accordingly, pregnant women should only be allowed to eat later in the day. (R. Yosef relies on the minority opinion of the Chemed Moshe that the circumcision can even take place in the morning, and seemingly further extends it by arguing that circumcisions must take place during the daytime, but the pregnant women is already pregnant at night.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the argument is predicated on a suspicious Kal Vahomer: a postponed Tisha Bav is more lenient than an ordinary fast because of laws of circumcision, so it must be as lenient as an ordinary fast regarding pregnant women. This is not obvious for two reasons. First, even a postponed Tisha Bav is significantly more strict than an ordinary fast since it still starts at night, has the 4 other afflictions, prohibition on Torah study, etc. How can you say it <em>must be as lenient</em> regarding pregnant women? Second, many Acharonim (Maharash Halevi OC 2, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36276&st=&pgnum=183\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beit Meir 559</a>, Avnei Nezer 1:427,429, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40313&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eshel Avraham (Buchach) 550:1</a>) actually make the exact opposite Kal Vahomer: on a postponed Tisha Bav women are obligated to fast while they are exempt on ordinary fasts, so parties of a circumcision who are exempt on a postponed Tisha Bav must also be exempt from ordinary fasts.</p>\n\n<p>It's true that R. Yosef provides a couple Rishonim who hold that parties of a circumcision are obligated to fast on ordinary fasts, rejecting that conclusion, but we see that all those Acharonim took it as obvious that pregnant women are obligated to fast on a postponed Tisha Bav. Perhaps those Rishonim just didn't hold like the Mordechai that a circumcision overrides a postponed fast so we can't use them to compare to our case? Perhaps what we should be learning from those Rishonim is that Kal Vahomer shouldn't be used here, especially since the reasons for exempting pregnant women and parties to a circumcision don't seem to be the same (health and/or fundamental optional nature of the fast vs. personal holiday pushing off mourning).</p>\n\n<p>(Looking for a moment at the idea that the permission for pregnant women to not fast on the three minor fasts is because those fasts <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20276/759\">are fundamentally optional</a> and the community never accepted that pregnant women should need to fast, Divrei Malkiel (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=804&st=&pgnum=38\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:26</a>) in a responsum during the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1899%E2%80%931923_cholera_pandemic\" rel=\"noreferrer\">sixth cholera epidemic</a> ruled that a city at high risk of cholera did not need to fast on Tisha Bav because of the great danger. He bolsters his position by noting that a postponed Tisha Bav may be considered more lenient since he argues the Second Temple was burned entirely on 9 Av (unlike the First Temple which mostly burned on 10 Av) and therefore a postponed Tisha Bav reverts to fundamentally optional since it is no longer the date of multiple tragedies (cf. RH 18b). He also notes some Rishonim to the Talmud in Megillah interpret Rebbe's wanting to skip a postponed Tisha Bav as following a view that Tisha Bav is also part of the \"fundamentally optional\" fasts. According to this pregnant women could be exempt like on ordinary fasts, but 1) it's not clear he ever relied on this without the overarching concern for cholera, 2) there's no reason to think the will of the community was ever to exempt pregnant women from a postponed fast, and 3) it's not clear we rule like those Rishonim in Megillah, or that the Sages, who we follow, agreed with Rebbe about this point.)</p>\n\n<p>R. Yosef indeed in a later responsum (Yechavveh Daat 3:40) backed off a bit and recommended pregnant women try to fast until the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>A somewhat similar argument was presented earlier in R. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_ben_Joseph_Reischer\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yaakov Reischer</a>'s Shevut Yaakov (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1519&st=&pgnum=217\" rel=\"noreferrer\">3:37</a>), writing about Tisha Bav 1721. This source was quoted by R. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiva_Eger\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Akiva Eiger</a> and then in the Beiur Halakha (not the Mishna Berura, perhaps because he thought it more of an oddity / סניף להקל than mainstream Halakha) so it has received some recent prominence, but it's worth seeing the case inside.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחד היה לו חולי שאין בו סכנה כ\"כ וקיבל עליו התענית והתענה עד אחר חצות לזמן מנחה גדולה ונחלש עד שצוה הרופא שלא יתענה יותר והורה להם המורה שיתפלל מנחה גדולה ואח\"כ יאכל ולפי שהתפלל תפלת מנחה ביחידות שכח מלהניח תפילין כדינו ושאל השואל מה תקנתו.<br>\n  תשובה: הנה בוודאי מה שהורה המורה שיתפלל מנחה גדולה יפה עשה כיון שנדחה ט\"ב על יום א' א\"צ להשלים אפילו בחולי קצת וכן נהגתי להורות ביולדות תוך ל או במעוברות ומיחוש קצת דהא אפילו משום כבוד המילה הקילו בהנ\"ל כמבואר באו\"ח סימן תקנ\"ט סעיף ט' כל שכן בחשש חולי...<br>\n  Someone who was sick without too much danger and accepted to fast and fasted until after noon at the time for Mincha, and he became weak until the doctor ordered him not to fast further, and the rabbi ruled that he should pray Mincha first and then eat, and since he prayed Mincha alone he forgot to don his Tefillin and he asked how to fix the situation.<br>\n  Answer: Certainly that which the rabbi ruled to pray Mincha first was correct, for since Tisha Bav was postponed to Sunday, he does not need to complete the fast even for a smaller illness, and so I have been accustomed to rule to women within 30 days of giving birth or pregnant women who feel unwell, for even for a circumcision are we lenient, all the more so with a risk of illness....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see the level of sickness that he used to permit breaking the fast was such that the man, after being ordered by a doctor to stop fasting, hurried to pray Mincha even without his Tefillin, and that insisting on waiting till after actually praying Mincha was essential. This isn't quite a blanket ruling that all pregnant women categorically are exempt in the afternoon.</p>\n\n<p>So you have this one source from the 18th century which allows for a somewhat weaker standard of illness to exempt from fasting, which gets quoted a couple times after that, and at the same time you have all the above-mentioned sources (Avnei Nezer, etc.), both before and after that source, who explicitly assumed otherwise or didn't cite any leniency for this relatively common situation (about 1/4 years). Even quite recent works like the Arukh haShulchan, who certainly saw R. Akiva Eiger's citation, make no mention at all of any leniency for pregnant women on a postponed Tisha Bav. It doesn't seem like leniency on this issue was at all widespread historically.</p>\n\n<p>R. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Luria\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shlomo Luria</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_Maharshal.53\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shu\"t Maharshal 53</a>, the earliest explicit source on the matter that I've found) ruled that even a woman who gave birth on Saturday 2 Av must fast on Sunday 10 Av since she is past her (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%93\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 617:4</a>) seven day recovery period. Even though the case was explicitly where the fast was postponed, he, by omitting any mention of that, indicates that the postponed case is not treated differently. It was obviously so, since no one had ever suggested otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Magen Avraham (OC 554 sk 9) used the leniency for a circumcision to justify ruling leniently, against Maharshal, like the opinions in Rishonim that a postpartum woman has 30 days to recover before becoming obligated to fast on Tisha Bav, instead of 7 like on Yom Kippur. While notably the first basis for any leniency for women on a postponed Tisha Bav, implicit again is that nursing after the formal recovery days is insufficient to warrant categorical leniency from a postponed fast. This is likely what the Shevut Yaakov is expanding when he says he is lenient on a postponed fast for \"postpartum women within 30 days and pregnant women who feel somewhat ill\".</p>\n\n<p>For some more modern names, R. Yitzchak Ratsabi (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21714&st=&pgnum=185\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Olath Yitschaq</a> 1:67) treats a postponed Tisha Bav like any other. R. Ben-Tzion Abba Shaul (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19980&st=&pgnum=250\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Or Letzion 3:29:3</a>) did as well. R. Moshe Shternbuch (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20026&st=&pgnum=226\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Teshuvot veHanhagot 2:253</a>) fundamentally agrees but feels unable to prevent women from relying on the Beiur Halakha, especially in hot climates (where doctors told him there is significant risk for miscarriage (YMMV)). R. Meir Mazuz <a href=\"https://www.ykr.org.il/question/7025\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is quite hesitant</a> to rely on R. Yosef's leniency. R.

Of course on the other side there are Poskim who take any leniency they can find with fasting nowadays since we are \"weaker\" than in previous generations (cf. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/63949/why-dont-israeli-women-fast\">an extreme example</a>).</p>\n\n<p>Obviously any woman should <a href=\"http://choppingwood.blogspot.com/2015/07/pregnant-and-nursing-women-fasting-on.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">consult</a> with both her doctor and her rabbi to determine how she should stay safe and follow Halakha, especially regarding any complications with her pregnancy or history of miscarriages or preterm labor.

Havdalah should\n  be recited before eating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>R Eliezer Melamed</strong> <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/Articles/Article.aspx/19325\" rel=\"noreferrer\">rules similarly</a> for most women</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But when Tisha B'Av is postponed, the obligation\n  of the Tisha B'Av fast is more similar to that of the minor fasts.\n  Indeed, due to the severity of the of the fast's importance, ideally,\n  when it is not difficult, <strong>pregnant and nursing mothers should also\n  fast; but if there is any difficulty whatsoever, they are exempt, even\n  though they are not considered ill.</strong> In practice, it turns out that\n  about 90% of pregnant and partially nursing women do not need to fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(see <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/05-10-20/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> for more from R Melamed with sources)</p>\n\n<p><strong>R Ovadia Yosef</strong> ruled <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2348\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as follows</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hacham Ovadia Yosef addresses this question (Must Pregnant and Nursing Women Fast When Tisha B’Ab is Delayed From Shabbat to Sunday) in Yalkut Yosef –\n  Ta’aniyot (p. 88; listen to audio recording for precise citation), and\n  advances a “Kal Va’homer” rationale to <strong>allow pregnant and nursing\n  women to eat on Tisha B’Ab in this situation</strong>. He notes that when a\n  Berit is performed on a fast day, the three Ba’aleh Berit (the father,\n  the Sandak and the Mohel) must fast despite the festive occasion; this\n  applies not only on Tisha B’Ab, but even on Shiba Asar Be’Tammuz,\n  Asara Be’Tebet and Som Gedalya. However, when a fast day falls on\n  Shabbat and is observed the next day, and a Berit is performed, the\n  Ba’aleh Berit are permitted to eat. Even on Tisha B’Ab, the Ba’aleh\n  Berit may eat if Tisha B’Ab is observed on the tenth of Ab because the\n  ninth is Shabbat.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hacham Ovadia reasoned that <strong>if Ba’aleh Berit are permitted to eat on\n  Tisha B’Ab in such a case, then this should certainly apply to\n  pregnant and nursing women, as well</strong>. Halacha treats nursing and\n  pregnant women more leniently with regard to fasting than Ba’aleh\n  Berit, as evidenced by the fact that unlike Ba’aleh Berit, pregnant\n  and nursing women are allowed to eat on Shiba Asar Be’Tammuz, Asara\n  Be’Tebet and Som Gedalya. Thus, if Halacha allows Ba’aleh Berit to eat\n  in the case of a delayed Tisha B’Ab, then certainly pregnant and\n  nursing women may eat in such a case, as well. They may eat already in\n  the morning, and it is possible that they may even eat already on\n  Mosa’eh Shabbat, since they are exempt from the fast. Hacham Ovadia\n  adds, however, that pregnant and nursing women in this case should not\n  indulge in food and drink, and should instead eat and drink only as\n  necessary for the wellbeing of the infant.</p>\n  \n  <p>It should also be noted that a woman in this case must recite Habdala\n  before eating, as Halacha does not allow eating after Shabbat until\n  the recitation of Habdala.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On a regular Tisha b'Av see <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/life-cycle/default.asp?id=620\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> from Nishmat.</p>\n\n<p>Remember to always <a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">ask your rav</a> before applying anything you read on the Internet.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My wife ~5 months pregnant was told by Rav Yitzchok Berkowitz from Sanhedria Murchevet Jerusalem not to fast.

    "content": "# \"Kanai\": What criteria must be met by a defendant charged with murder who claims \"kanai\" status (halachik answers only please, not hashkafik/musar)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Much has been written about kanaut, and see for example the famous brother and sister Leibowitz, writing separately, but mine is a purely-halachik question: If someone replicates Pinchas's action, under similar conditions - surely the claim \"I am a kanai\" would not suffice to prevent being arrested by the Sanhedrin's police, nor enough to immediately dismiss charges during the mishpat, so I assume that there must be some process whereby a kanai would be challenged by a sanhedrin to somehow prove that he meets certain criteria.\nמואשם ברצח בועל ארמית (בפרהסיה, 10 עדים, עם התראה וכו') שטוען בהגנתו שפעל לפי  הלכת קנאי, איך הסנהדרין חוקר/קובע אם הוא זכאי לסיווג הזה, ופטור - ז\"א בכדי להיחשב 'קנאי' האם ישנם קריטריונים מקובלים בהלכה פסוקה (לא מוסר/השקפה, אלא הלכה למעשה בפוסקים)? האם היה מקרה כזה, מובא בנ\"ך או בתלמוד? \n.............\nRe the point made about hasro'oh: Can someone killing a boel aramis save themselves from the death penalty by simply mouthing the following self-fulfilling prophecy  \"I am a kanai (and therefore I am sure I am permitted to do this, so I am sure I am not liable for the death penalty) and therefore your hasro'o doesn't work and therefore indeed I will not be liable for the death penalty for doing what I am doing this second, killing this bo'el aramis\". \nI imagine that such a person WOULD get the death penalty UNLESS they could somehow prove that they qualify as a kana'i, otherwise noone could ever be killed for killing a bo'el aramis. \nIndeed, any murderer could say to the witnesses giving hasro'o \"I believe you are not a kosher witness, or you are actually not Jewish or etc, and so I don't believe your testimony will be upheld by Sanhedrin, so I believe I will not be laible for the death penalty\" and presto, the hasro'oh doeesn't work, and the killer can't get the death penalty, as they predicted (unless one can prove that the murderer was lying, and did not think the witness was non-Jewish or etc). [It would not be reasonable to ask Sanhedrin to prove that the murderer indeed did NOT think they were a kanai, since it is impossible to prove that at that moment this was not his belief. Unless one thinks the person truly believes it, and tha tthis is a symptom of mental ilness, and then they can be exempted from the death penalty for that reason.]\nAlso: someone could kill a Jewish husband having relations with his Jewish wife in public and not get the death penalty , by saying to the witnesses \"this woman is an Aramis\" and so as a kanai I can kill him\" and the hasro'oh wouldn't work, etc, unless one can prove he didn't in fact believe she was an Aramis...Maybe the wife could claim she is actually an aramis, and then SHE can kill her husband claiming SHE is a kanai?... ] \nSince this first scenario above is a good way to murder and escape the death penalty, I believe the question IS realistic [now try and prove I don't believe that ! :) ], certainly far more so that some rather exotic scenarios discussed in the gemoro. In any case, my question still stands \"Is there any halachic discussion of this\". I assume the commenter believes there is not, but is this known for a fact?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Sanhedrin_and_the_Penalties_within_their_Jurisdiction.12.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Rambam</a> states that in order for someone to be found guilty in court of murder he must first (immediately before his action) be warned that his action will be met with the death penalty and must reply that he accepts the punishment but will commit the crime anyway (saying 'I know' would not be enough). In a case of kanaut he wouldn't explicitly accept the punishment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While it is not explicit in the Rambam, I understand that the courts will simply not deal with a case of someone who killed in a case of \"kanaim pogim bo\", and there is no need to prove anything. I believe that even if we have no good reason to think the killerwas acting out of \"kanaus\" he would still not be punished, because the rule is that anyone who commited said crimes simply does not have any protection under the law if he was killed in the act.</p>\n\n<p>Even if that is not true, The rule of \"Kanaim pogim bo\" is only in a public setting, with at least 10 other people watching. It would be clear from the context if he was acting out of religious zeal or personal malice.\nEither way, the burden of proof would be on the court to show that he acted out of personal malice. The burden is always on the court to prove that an act needs to be punished, it is not on the defendant to convince them of his innocence.</p>\n\n\n",

In short, we can’t. </p>\n\n<p>The case Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel we’re discussing is when a man gives his wife a get and then is intimate with his wife. Does he need to give a new get? Beis Shammai for once is lenient, and Beis Hillel stringent. In the conclusion of the Gemara, the case is that there were Eidi Yichud but no Eidi Bi’ah. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains the reason behind Beis Hillel’s opinion that Eidi Yichud are considered like Eidi Bi’ah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הן הן כו' - כלומר כיון דראו שנתייחדו אין צריך עדות של ביאה גדול מזה ודאי אנן סהדי כיון דגייסי אהדדי לא פרשו זה מזה:</p>\n  \n  <p>Since we see that they are secluded, we don’t need a greater testimony to their intimacy than this; we are witnesses that since they are close with one another, they won’t separate from each other. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, once he says he’s going to be intimate, we assume that he is. You’re correct - maybe something will prevent them from acting. But we act on the chazakah of לבו גס בה. </p>\n\n<p>This logic of לבו גס בה applies in the other direction also - in a case where they were divorced only after Kiddushin but not Nisuin, the Gemara rules that even Beis Hillel won’t require a second get:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומודים בנתגרשה מן האירוסין שאינה צריכה הימנו גט שני דכיון דאין לבו גס בה לא אמרינן הן הן עדי ביאה\n  They agree when they were divorced from Kiddushin that she doesn’t need a second get, for since he is not close with her, we don’t say that they are witnesses to the intimacy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This lack of absolute knowledge isn't a problem here. Witnesses for Kiddushin are not there, as you say, to verify if Kiddushin occurred. It's not like if there weren't witnesses they'd be married and just unable to convince anyone else of it. Having witnesses is part of the ceremony itself and here their being just outside with a presumption of intent and action is sufficient to make the ceremony effective. If there is actually a doubt if marital relations are occurring in a marriage (eg. one spouse sues the other for divorce with this claim), then witnesses of seclusion are insufficient and the court can't adjudicate the case further (Rambam Ishus 14:16). It is prohibited to bring the witnesses into the room itself to observe due to modesty concerns (ibid.). Indeed even effecting Kiddushin with the witnesses outside the room is strongly discouraged and one is lashed for doing so (ibid. 3:21).</p>\n\n<p>In summary: Witnesses to the seclusion are enough for Kiddushin to be effective. Since he says he’s going to be intimate with her and we see that they are close with one another, we trust the presumption and declare it an act of Kiddushin. There is no way to really verify if intercourse actually took place, but that is not a problem for Kiddushin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'd explain it from a different angle (EDITED: you actually ask two different question here):</p>\n\n<p><strong>1. What the witnesses testify about:</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>THey don't need to see anything but the door closed - they witness the Chazokeh!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>One of the most important bases for judgments in Judaism is Chazokeh (<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%94_(%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%94)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חזקה</a>)</strong>,<br>\ni.g <em>if it walks like a duck and swims like a duck and quacks like a duck, we call it a duck</em>. It is so serious - <strong>we stone people based on חזקה</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>For example, two witnesses see someone transgressing Shabbos - there could be tons of reasons why they saw wrong, but we kill for that חזקה that they claim they saw. Another example - a couple comes to a town with a kid and live together as a family for 15 years and then the kid comes onto his mother claiming she's not. We kill for that חזקה.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if they entered a room openly and willingly before 'witnesses to make an act, and stayed in the room long enough to make it - we need no more details to declare their marriage.</p>\n\n<p><em>NB: The same rule holds for other witnessings of the act, like the Sotah for example.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How the intercourse can be verified:</strong></p>\n\n<p>THe lack of the act could not be possibly verified in any way (forensically?), even if they claim she's still a virgin (there are legit ways to achieve that) or he's impotent etc - nothing holds against a Chazokeh.</p>\n\n<p>The only way to disprove it (I would call it a disproval but a Sofek) is to either bring Eidim Zomemim to disqualify the main Edim or to bring two other Eidim that will testify that the couple jumped out the window straight away and ran away.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand one isn't allowed to create an image on his own and give it form and then call it to be something godlike (divine)</p>\n\n<p>Looking at these prohibitions (see for example Exodus 20:1-4, Deuteronomy 4:15-19, Deuteronomy 5:6-9 etc.) I noticed the emphasis on making such images physical. But what about the images in our thoughts/mind?</p>\n\n<p>We all have an image <em>about</em> G-d (of whom He is and what He does or can do, i.e. His attributes or characteristics), but I don't assume one is allowed to have an image <strong><em>of</em></strong> G-d.

Another question I have regards this topic is that the presence of HaShem is often pictured in the Tenach as a cloud or to dwell in a cloud\n(1 Kings 8:10-11, Exodus 19, 40:34-38 and other verses). I'm quite a visual thinker, so is it wrong to picture these kind of images in my head.

This is why the Sages of blessed memory said with regards to heaven there is no sitting, nor standing, no awakeness, nor tiredness. This is all to say that He does not partake of any physical actions or qualities. And if He were to be a body then He would be like any other body and would not be God. And all that is written in the holy books regarding descriptions of God, they are all anthropomorphic. Thus said our great Rabbis of blessed memory, “The Torah speaketh in man’s language” (i.e. using human terms to offer some understanding). And the Rabbis have already spoken at length on this issue. This is the third pillar and is attested to by the verse, “For you saw no image” meaning that you did not see an image or any form when you stood at Sinai because as we have just said, He has no body, nor power of the body.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93629/what-is-the-status-of-someone-who-denies-one-of-the-rambams-13-principles\">HERE</a> regarding the status of believing in the Rambam's 13 principles, but I do not think that there's any disagreement that this one is a mandatory belief.</p>\n\n<p>If someone imagines GD as a physical image, although he may not be considered an idol worshiper, this is against this fundamental principle of faith.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>With respect to the cloud, it seems there are three possibilities:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The cloud <em>is</em> God.</li>\n<li>The cloud <em>represents</em> God.</li>\n<li>The cloud <em>obscures</em> God.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first two attribute supernatural powers to the cloud, so it's difficult to consider them as anything other than idolatry.</p>\n\n<p>The third simply illustrates your inability to see God in his true form.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Good question.

Does God have a human form?</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the cloud, there are three possibilities. We will show how none of them are correct, offering a fourth approach.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>G-d is not the cloud since G-d has no body and is one.</li>\n<li>The cloud cannot represent G-d as this would imply that the cloud is a separate entity.</li>\n<li>G-d cannot be obscured in one place since G-d is everywhere.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms</strong></p>\n\n<p>French Jewish Bible commentator Rashi (Rabbi Solomon Yitzchaqi) disagreed. He felt that G-d was <a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/controversy/Vol7Slifkinwithletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">corporeal</a>. For example, some have claimed that G-d needed to descend to investigate a matter, quoting scripture: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>G-d came down to see the city and the tower that the people built [the\n  Tower of Babel].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Onkelos (chapter 18,) rejects the anthropomorphic “I will go down,\" substituting a paraphrase: “I will reveal Myself.”</p>\n\n<p>The translator felt that G-d was not traveling down, instead, He was “revealing,” letting it be known that He knows the evil that has been committed. In his Guide of the Perplexed 1:10, Maimonides also explains that “go down” and “go up” is a metaphor for divine communication taking place (down) and ceasing (up).</p>\n\n<p>In his Commentary on the Mishnah, he writes,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“They do this simply due to their ignorance [boorishness] in\n  philosophy, and distance from the sciences. They lack sufficient\n  [intellectual] perfection to awaken themselves...this miserable group,\n  mercy upon their ignorance... destroy the grandeur of the Torah....\n  Many [rabbis] preach publically matters they do not understand\n  themselves. If only they would keep quiet.”[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>An image of G-d in the mind</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rambam writes that we are incapable of knowing anything about G-d except for what G-d is not. Rabbi Ishmael felt that the Torah, “speaks in the language people use,”) which is to say, that G-d does not really speak, get angry, regret, have emotions, or walks. G-d's anger in the Bible should not be understood literally, for G-d does not react emotionally to situations, as humans do. These depictions are figurative. Similarly, we should not picture G-d talking, walking, or listening to our prayers in our minds as that is akin to idolatry. People should act intelligently and philosophically, as shown in the Bible. </p>\n\n<p>Genesis 1:26 states,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Let us make man in our demut.\" Verse 1:27 relates that “G-d made man\n  in His tzelem, in the tzelem of G-d, He made him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It appears that people are made in the image of G-d. Does this verse imply that G-d is a human, only bigger? Actually, it cannot mean “likeness\" since G-d has no body and is one. Onkelos renders 2:7's “a living being,” to ruach m’mal’la, “one with the power of speech,” a characteristic of man's intelligence. Maimonides equates intelligence as tzelem, people should act intelligently because that is like G-d.</p>\n\n<p>Now that it is clear that G-d does not have a form, nor can we imagine G-d in our minds since this would be improper, we can attempt to explain the pillar(s) of clouds.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire</strong> </p>\n\n<p>There are many miracles associated with the Exodus story, one of which being the pillar of cloud and pillar of fire. </p>\n\n<p>Exodus 14:24 states, \"the L-rd looked upon the camp of the Egyptians from the pillar of fire and the cloud,” preventing the Egyptians from entering the Sea of Reeds, and attacking the Israelite camp, waiting to cross. Again Onkelos translates Exodus 16:10 as “the glory of the Lord appeared (Onkelos: was revealed) in the cloud.”</p>\n\n<p>In Deuteronomy 1:31-33, Moses recalls the pillar of cloud and fire, saying,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And in the wilderness, where you saw how the L-rd your G-d carried\n  you, as a man carries his son, all the way you traveled until you came\n  to this place. Yet in this thing you have no trustin the memra (word\n  or wisdom) of the  L-rd your  G-d,  who goes before you on the way, to\n  prepare for you a place, a lodging to rest, with a pillar of fire by\n  night to see the way you are to follow and a pillar of cloud by day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Exodus 40:34-38, records: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Then the cloud covered the Tent of  Meeting, and the glory of the \n  L-rd filled the Tabernacle.  Moses was unable to enter the  Tent of \n  Meeting because the cloud had settled upon it, and the glory of the\n  L-rd filled the Tabernacle. When the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle,\n  the Israelites would set out on their various journeys. But if the\n  cloud did not lift, they would not set out until it did lift. For the\n  cloud of the  L-rd (Onkelos: the cloud of glory of the L-rd) was upon\n  the  Tabernacle by day, “v’aish tihyeh lailah bo,”(literally) and\n  there was fire therein by night (Onkelos: and the appearance of fire\n  would be upon it by night), before the eyes of the entire house of\n  Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The targumist inserts “an appearance of,” (borrowed from Numbers 9:16,) as to avoid a real fire that might burn or ignite the Tabernacle. We see this again in verse 24:17, “Then the glory of the L-rd appeared in the sight of the Israelites as  a consuming fire on the top of the Mountain.”</p>\n\n<p>The targumist softens the anthropomorphic depictions of G-d. The traveling “by the mouth of G-d” is changed to memra (word or wisdom) which represents the pillar by day and by night. According to Onkelos, G-d is not manifested [hiddin or obsercured] within the cloud, instead, it is “the glory of G-d revealed.” Targum Onkelos also demonstrates that during the night the pillar of fire was only an “appearance,\" not a real fire burning on the Tabernacle, G-d forbid. However, this explanation leaves us with several questions.</p>\n\n<p>Is it problematical to suggest that G-d created a miraculous fire that would not ignite the flammable curtains? Since G-d created the laws of nature, is it unreasonable to say that He can suspend them if He so desires? Why couldn't our targumist simply say it was a miracle? Or, is it possible that the biblical pillars of cloud and fire that led the Israelites through the wilderness are a metaphor for G-d's guidance. There are some who think the pillar of cloud and fire is probably a metaphor saying the Israelites knew where they were heading. Is it possible to recognize G-d’s pillars (metaphorically,) leading us today or does the business of the modern world prevents us from doing that?</p>\n\n<p>[1] Commentary to Sanhedrin 10:1</p>\n\n\n",

They will say, \"I know him, I trust him' I won't have to pay\" - He's good for the loan, he never defaults\" etc etc. They don't realize that signing as an arev (especially arev-kablan) means that you are assuming the debt on yourself. In order to do so, you need to be able to pay the debt.</p>\n\n<p>The passuk says:</p>\n\n<p>Do not be one of those who give their hand, Who stand surety for debts, \nLest your bed be taken from under you <strong>When you have no money to pay</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>These last words tell us that the whole passuk is discussing someone who signs as an arev without having the money to pay the debt.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, being an arev for someone, when you can be an arev, ie YOU are good for the loan, you have the means to pay it, and thus helping them obtain a loan when needed, is a big mitzvah!</p>\n\n<p>[Note: This is the norm.

Private property can be shared between partners, but it is a Machlokes (source needed) whether each one owns a part of it, or both own the whole.</p></li>\n<li><p>The status of what we call \"Public places\" is a very interesting issue, as Judaism does not truly recognize democracy especially in a Goyish country. But by the way of elimination, we can say: it is not a הפקר cause people cannot acquire it, not a הקדש, not a King's property, not a private property, but people can, in fact, use it - so it is a sort of a partnership.<br>\n.<br>\n<em>In ancient times some places outside of the towns <strong>were</strong> הפקר, but today all non-private property \"belongs\" to the state (correct me if I'm wrong).</em></p></li>\n<li><p>Use of shared property is subject to the original contract between the parties. In a democratic country that is the federal/provincial/municipal law, in our terms, it is דינא דמלכותא. The local people decide who will be officially in charge of managing all those places and that person(s) decide on permits. Those permits are Halachicly valid as דינא דמלכותא דינא.</p></li>\n<li><p>Therefore, based on that, if the law allows one to cordon off an area <strong>by a permit</strong> - so be it, if it disallows - so be it. If it only allows that to a certain group of people (local taxpayers or LGTB or Jews) - so be it etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>When you ask \"can he keep other out\", in our reality this is a basic idea behind the local Police force - to follow the local laws and guide the public accordingly.

From observing Sifrei Torah, the gist of it seems to be a layering of text, wherein the words are broken up into several word phrases, which are then layered line by line, with gaps in the middle. </p>\n\n<p>What are considered the parshah breaks for these? Both songs are preceded by and followed by a Pesuchah - are those the bounds of the parshah, and one could start an aliyah in the fourth passuk of either song? Or are the breaks in the middle of the lines considered a new parshah each time?</p>\n\n<p>When a ba’al korei reads a parshah, he may not begin an aliyah within three pesukim of the beginning of a parsha, nor may he end one within three pesukim of the end of a parsha (OC 138). To that end, I am aware that the practice is to have several parshah breaks during Shiras Ha’azinu, but none in Shiras HaYam (at least among Ashkenazim). Does this mean that the Shiros are a single parshah? If so, is this limited to Ha’azinu, but the breaks in Beshalach are Parshah breaks? Or does this in theory apply to Beshalach as well, just that in practice it wouldn’t occur without adding aliyos according to our minhag?</p>\n\n<p>In the event that the gaps during a Shirah are not considered Parshah breaks, I would like an explanation as to why that is the case. In the event that Shiras HaYam and Shiras Ha’azinu are different, I would also like an explanation of that as well. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>YD 275:3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב השירה כשאר הכתב או שכתב שאר הכתב כשירה פסול ודוקא שכתב השירה כשאר הכתב בלא פיזור אבל אם שינה בפיזור ממה שנהגו לא פסל ובלבד שיהא אריח על גבי לבינה:‏.</p>\n<p>If he wrote a song like the rest of the text or he wrote the rest of the text like a song it is invalid, but only if he wrote it like the rest of the text without dispersing [the words around gaps]; but if he changed the dispersion from what is customary he did not invalidate it, so long as it is still [in the right sort of pattern/shape].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from here that these gaps are not normal Parsha breaks or else you'd have to keep them between the correct two words. \"Song\" mode is just different from \"prose\" mode. Gaps have different meanings. (It could be there are rules about the size of the gaps in song mode, or something else, which parallel the rules in the other mode, but fundamentally it's a different beast and you shouldn't just expect to treat it like a prose section with a higher density of breaks.)</p>\n\n\n",

I  interpreted this as somehow focusing my attention on Hashem by thinking about him for a moment. However, as a human being, many times I tried to visualise him, which <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/93818/15256\">raises concerns</a> at least. What is the exact meaning of this passage from the <em>gemara?</em> How should one properly perform this in practice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>IMHO I think the intention behind יכוין לבו כנגד אביו שבשמים is to conjure up thoughts in your head directed towards <strong><em>the actions</em></strong> that Hashem does in the world in general and for us specifically. As you know, we can never even come close to understanding the essence of who or what Hashem is. It is completely out of our realm of understanding. But we can know and understand the actions that he has does in the world.</p>\n\n<p>Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I am standing in front of he who has created the world </li>\n<li>I am standing\nin front of he who constantly gives me life out of pure mercy </li>\n<li>The\nlist goes on...</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The words are: יכוין לבו כנגד אביו שבשמים</p>\n\n<p>יכוין comes from the word Keevoon (direction or aim). So the idea is to <strong><em>aim</em></strong> your thoughts towards Hashem, meanwhile knowing that your mind will never fully grasp him.</p>\n\n<p>Like Rav Avigdor Miller points out many times, throughout his writings, לבו in Chazal means mind.

    "content": "# What is Rebbi Yehuda's source for allowing a succah to be above 20 amos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Some say that R' Yehuda held that there is no Biblical source for the 20 amos limit and therefore ruled that a succah could be higher than 20 amos. But that would seem to go against the Gemara that says סוכה דאורייתא תני פסולה מבוי דרבנן תני תקנתא. And if he held there is no source, why did R' Yehuda rule that a מבוי which is דרבנן does not need to be lowered. This suggests that he did have a Biblical source for allowing a higher than 20 amos succah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I think you are misunderstanding the line of דאורייתא תני פסולה מבוי דרבנן תני תקנתא.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the passage in context:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=2&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Succah 2a</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנן התם מבוי שהוא גבוה מעשרים אמה ימעט רבי יהודה אומר אינו צריך מאי\n  שנא גבי סוכה דתני פסולה ומאי שנא גבי מבוי דתני תקנתא סוכה דאורייתא תני\n  פסולה מבוי דרבנן תני תקנתא ואיבעית אימא בדאורייתא נמי תני תקנתא מיהו\n  סוכה (דנפישי מילתה) פסיק ותני פסולה מבוי דלא נפיש מיליה תני תקנתא</p>\n  \n  <p>We have learnt elsewhere : If the [cross-beam above an] alley-entry is\n  more than twenty cubits high, it must be lowered. R. Judah says this\n  is unnecessary. Now wherein lies the difference [between the two cases\n  that] with regard to the Sukkah it is declared NOT VALID, while with\n  regard to [the cross-beam over] the alley-entry, a remedy is\n  indicated? — With regard to the Sukkah, since it is a Pentateuchal\n  ordinance, it [was proper categorically to] state, NOT VALID; with\n  regard to [the cross-beam over] an alley-entry, however, since the\n  injunction is only Rabbinical, a remedy is given. And, if you wish,\n  you may say that even with a Pentateuchal command a remedy may be\n  given, but with regard to the Sukkah, as the ordinances relating\n  thereto are many it was briefly stated, NOT VALID [while in the case\n  of a cross-beam over] an alley-entry, since the regulations thereof\n  are not many, a remedy is indicated.(<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Sukkah.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It does not mean that the Torah says that a succah cannot exceed 20 amos in height, as that would, of course, refute the opinion of R. Yehuda. What it means is that the Sages used the term \"invalid\" because (according to their view) the invalidity of such a succah is already established by the Torah, so they can refer to such a succah as invalid. As opposed to a mavuy where the cross-beam is not discussed in the Torah, so saying that it is invalid if higher than 20 amos is meaningless because prior to the Mishnah there is nothing that makes it invalid. Thus, the Sages instead say that it must be lowered.</p>\n\n<p>R. Yehuda disagrees in both cases. He does not agree that the Torah stipulates that a succah must not exceed 20 amos. Once the Sages declared it invalid, R. Yehuda responds that it is valid. By the mavuy, once the Sages said that it must be lowered, R. Yehuda says that it need not be lowered.</p>\n\n<p>This is essentially Rashi's explanation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סוכה מדאורייתא. דעשרים אמה דילה ילפינן מדאורייתא וקודם שנשנית המשנה\n  נאמרה שיעורה מסיני: תני פסולה. שייך למיתני בה לשון פסול כלומר לא נעשית\n  כתורה וכהלכה: מבוי. דכוליה מדרבנן דמדאורייתא סגי ליה בשלש מחיצות ואינו\n  צריך לקורה זו אלא מדרבנן: תני תקנתא. דלא שייך למתני בה לשון פסול דמאן\n  פסלה קודם שנשנית משנה זו הרי היא תחלת הוראתו ומצותו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Yehuda's source for his view (as explained by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> in his commentary to the Mishnah) is that he disagrees with the premise that a succah is meant to be a \"temporary dwelling\".</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Additionally, regarding the basis of R. Yehuda's position, Rashi states that the disagreement will be explained in the Gemara. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Penei Yehoshua</a> points out though that the Gemara never explains R. Yehuda's position. He first suggests that when the Gemara offers three explanations of the Sages' position, and asks a question on each one, we simply assume that R. Yehuda agrees with the questions. However, he then argues that for the first explanation that can't be true (based on a later Gemara), so he then suggests that Rashi was only referring to the reason according to the explanation of Rava which is the explanation accepted l'halacha. As that explanation is that a succah must be a \"temporary dwelling\", it is understood that R. Yehuda does not require a temporary dwelling.</p>\n\n\n",

But here, the original practice was <strong>not</strong> to bring a korban Musaf on the first day.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R. E. Melamed addresses the issue of the reason for two days of Rosh Chodesh in a footnote <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/05-01-04/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכאורה יש לשאול, הרי ר\"ח הוא היום הראשון של החודש, ומדוע כשהחודש מלא גם יום השלושים לחודש הקודם נחשב לר\"ח? באר בשבולי הלקט קסח, בשם רבנו שלמה והרי\"ד (רבי ישעיה הראשון), וכך מובא בברכ\"י תכז, שכאשר החודש מלא, חידושה של הלבנה חל באמצע היום השלושים (לאחר עשרים ותשעה ימים וחצי), לפיכך, אף שא' לחודש חל למחרת (כדי לאזן את החודשים, כמבואר בהלכה א), מ\"מ ראוי לעשות ר\"ח גם ביום חידוש הלבנה, לפיכך עושים יומיים ר\"ח. והתשב\"ץ ג, רמד, כתב, שהיו נוהגים להימנע ממלאכה בר\"ח ולערוך סעודות, וכבר מתחילת יום שלושים היו נוהגים כן, שאולי יבואו עדים ואותו יום יתקדש כר\"ח, ואם לא היו באים עדים, ממילא נהגו גם ביום שלמחרת ר\"ח. נמצא שכאשר החודש מלא נהגו ר\"ח יומיים (בדומה לר\"ה). <strong>ואף שקרבנות מוסף הקריבו רק בא' לחודש, מתוך הטעמים הללו יוצא שבחודש מלא יש קדושה בשני הימים, ולכן אומרים בשניהם הלל ומוסף ויעלה ויבוא.</strong>‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Seemingly, one could ask: Rosh Chodesh means the first day of month; why then is the thirtieth day of a full month also considered Rosh Chodesh? The Shibolei HaLeket (168) quoting Rabbeinu Shlomo and the Rid (the earlier R. Yeshayah), as well as the author of Birkei Yosef (427), explain that when a month is full, the new moon appears in the middle of the thirtieth day (after 29½ days). Therefore, even though the next day will be the first of the month (in order to balance out the months, as explained above – 1.1), nonetheless, it is fitting to also treat the day on which the moon reappears as Rosh Chodesh. This is why we keep two days of Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Tashbetz (3:244) writes that the Jews in ancient times used to refrain from work, and prepare festive meals in honor of Rosh Chodesh, and they would begin doing so already on the thirtieth day of the month, in the event that witnesses arrive and the Beit Din declares that day the first of the month. And if no one came to testify, they treated the next day as Rosh Chodesh as well. Thus, whenever a month was full, they kept two days of Rosh Chodesh (similar to Rosh HaShanah). <strong>Even though the Musaf sacrifices were offered up exclusively on the first of the month, these two explanations indicate that both days are holy, and we therefore say Hallel, Musaf, and Ya’aleh VeYavo on both days.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><em>(English translation taken from <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/05-01-04/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there are two possible reasons for treating the thirtieth of a month as Rosh Chodesh. Either because the <em>molad</em> falls part way through that day, or (as you suggested) due to the possibility of witnesses appearing during the day, similar to Rosh HaShanah.</p>\n\n<p>Now, R. Melamed points out (as you noted) that they would not have offered up a <em>korban musaf</em> on the thirtieth of the month, unless witnesses arrived and <em>beit din</em> declared that day to be Rosh Chodesh. Nevertheless, because we treat the day as Rosh Chodesh, he writes that we still say <em>tefillat musaf</em> (along with <em>hallel</em> and <em>ya'aleh veyavo</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that the reason for doing so is due to the difficulty that would be involved in instructing people to treat a day as Rosh Chodesh, but telling them <strong>not</strong> to recite <em>tefillat musaf</em>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The musaf offerings were certainly never brought before the Sanhedrin declared that that day was actually rosh chodesh based on the testimony of witnesses to the new moon.  The recitation is only in places where one wouldn't yet know if that declaration had already occurred, akin (as noted by @doubleAA in a comment) to the two day yom tovs of the diaspora (see Rosh Hashana 2:2; see also Rambam Hilchoth Qiddush Hachodesh Ch. 5).</p>\n\n\n",

In other words, a person who made teshuvah can be viewed as a different person compared to the one prior to teshuvah. As evidence he analyzes a query from R. Moshe Chaim Luzzatto \"Mesilas Yesharim\", perek 4,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can teshuvah help a sinner? It would seem that no amount of remorse, regret, or pleading can alter reality. The deed is done. Yet, teshuvah does just that - repentance wipes out misdeed.

The witnesses all present their irrefutable testimony and just before sentencing the judge turns to the bank robber to ask him if he has anything to say in his defence. To which a robber responds, \"Judge it is alll true, but I am sorry. I will not do it again. Can I go now?\" Clearly this is an absurd scenario. Yet with teshuvah this is precisely what would take place - after returning the theft the \"Judge\" pardons the criminal. <em>Teshuvah</em> does work. Why?</p>\n<p>The answer is that <em>teshuvah</em>, too, in a somewhat miraculous manner is transformative. (ספר קובץ מאמרים של מרן הגאון אלחנן בונים וסרמן, מאמר על התשובה)</p>\n<p>In the powerful words of R. Yitzchak Hutner: \"Teshuvah does not <em>better</em> the person, but actually <em>changes</em> the person\" (Sefer Pachad Yitzchak, Rosh haShanah, maamar 8, 20\"9:9). The Almighty creates a kind of \"Witness Protection Program\" for the <em>ba'al teshuvah</em>. He is a new person. Teshuvah also is transformative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, א-ל-הינו \"forgives\" because He is dealing with a <strong>new person</strong>, who returned to י-ה-ו-ה, his/her record is clean - there is nothing to prosecute for.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Malbim on this pasuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וישב אל ה',  ר\"ל כי יש מי ששב אל ה' מצד שמכיר שהוא ה' בורא העולם וזה השב מאהבה ועז\"א וישוב אל ה' וירחמהו. ויש מי ששב רק מצד יראת עצמו שירא שלא יענישהו, שזה נקרא ששב אל אלהינו המשגיח עלינו בפרטות לגמול ולענוש העובדים והממרים, וזה מדרגה קטנה מאד, מ\"מ גם תשובה זו תועיל כי ירבה לסלוח,  וגם להשבים מפני היראה יסלח עונם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two names of G-d mentioned don’t signify different ways in which G-d forgives; rather, they refer to the ways a man might repent. One can return to the eternal love and mercy of G-d, represented by the name הוי״ה, or to His supreme authority and judgement, the name אלקינו.</p>\n<p>To the first method, Hashem responds in kind with mercy and love.

Therefore, it can be deduced that according to the Rabbis on 3b and Beis Hillel on 3a to make one’s sukkah קבע and to transform his house into עראי, he needs only to אוכל ושותה מטייל בסוכה, because in the end a person may not have elegant dishes or fine linens.  And, this requirement corresponds to Beis Hillel’s minimum size sukkah of ראשו ורובו, that a person must be able to literally fit his head and most of his body inside the sukkah in order to be able to fulfill the requirement to אוכל ושותה ומטייל בסוכה.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iVfUuqGj.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iVfUuqGj.gif\" alt=\"20\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, Beis Shammai’s opinion adds to the common denominator of ראשו ורובו, in concluding that a person must literally pull his table out of his house, making his house עראי, and place the table inside his sukkah (ראשו ורובו ושולחנו) in order for him to אוכל ושותה מטייל בסוכה as he normally dwells in his house all year long.  And the proof that Beis Shammai requires the table to be removed from his house is that Mishna 3a states: מי שהיה ראשו ורובו בסוכה <strong>ושולחנו בתוך הבית</strong> ב”ש פוסלין ובית הלל מכשירין.  Why does the Mishna state: ושולחנו <strong>בתוך הבית</strong>?  Let the Mishna simply state that the table is outside the sukkah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V0ADR2Pt.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V0ADR2Pt.gif\" alt=\"21\" /></a></p>\n<p>Regarding the requirement to make one’s sukkah קבע, what are the rationales of the Tannaim?  In 28b, all hold that the Torah requires us to “תשבו” (dwell) in a permanent manner in a sukkah.  Therefore, a sukkah must be a “dwelling” and not like other structures, such as a hut to merely sleep in or a watchtower from which to stand guard.  Rebbe holds that a sukkah needs to be a permanent dwelling like a house, which if built less than 4×4 amos will lose its ability to be a dwelling, similar to the Baraisa on 3b which explains regarding houses: דאי אית ביה ד’ אמות על ד’ אמות דיירי ביה אינשי ואי לא לא דיירי ביה אינשי.  Whereas Beis Shammai holds that the unique feature of a dwelling is that a person eats meals at a table, otherwise it is not a dwelling but more like a hut, watchtower or some other type of structure.  However, Beis Hillel holds that if a person simply sat in the sukkah and ate without a table it was enough to make it a valid dwelling, even without a physical aspect of קבע that would make it a דירת קבע structurally in a physical sense, as is found by the opinions of the Tannaim on 7b.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the argument between Rebbe, Rebbi Yehuda, Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel is regarding the nature of קבע that constitutes a dwelling within which one can fulfill the commandment to “תשבו”.  Beis Hillel uniquely makes his sukkah קבע through simply eating his meals in the sukkah as opposed to his house, while at the same time maintaining that the physical structure of a sukkah requires a דירת עראי based on the words שבעת ימים, like Rava transmits to us on 2a.</p>\n<p><strong>Since the Gemara proves that Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel do argue in a small sukkah over a דאורייתא, and not like Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak suggested over a דרבנן, what then is the driving essence of Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel’s argument in a large sukkah at the conclusion of the Gemara’s discussion on 3a?</strong></p>\n<p>לעולם בתרתי פליגי פליגי בסוכה קטנה ופליגי בסוכה גדולה וחסורי מיחסרא והכי קתני מי שהיה ראשו ורובו בסוכה ושולחנו בתוך הבית ב”ש אומרים לא יצא וב”ה אומרים יצא ושאינה מחזקת אלא כדי ראשו ורובו בלבד ב”ש פוסלין ובית הלל מכשירין</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bmMnRnOU.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/bmMnRnOU.gif\" alt=\"22\" /></a></p>\n<p>The main issue of dispute in both a small and large sukkah is concerning whether a literal table is required inside the sukkah to qualify as a valid dwelling.  Consequently, regarding a small sukkah of ראשו ורובו the issue is not that the sukkah is approximately 6×6 tefachim, but that a sukkah of 6×6 tefachim necessarily does not permit Beis Shammai’s required table inside the sukkah from which a person must be able to eat. Therefore, a sukkah that is too small is structurally invalid on a דאורייתא level according to Beis Shammai, therefore ב”ש פוסלין.  Whereas, regarding the dispute in a large sukkah the issue is not that the table cannot physically fit inside the sukkah.  In this case, the sukkah itself is structurally valid according to the Torah, but since the table is not inside the sukkah from which one must eat their meals, the person does not discharge his דאורייתא obligation to dwell (תשבו) in a permanent manner, therefore ב”ש אומרים לא יצא to dwell in a sukkah.</p>\n<p>So, to summarize the matter the Gemara is always referring to Beis Shammai’s requirement as an actual table which is required to be inside of the sukkah to be qualified as a dwelling when one eats, which tangentially reveals a minimum size for a sukkah as ראשו ורובו ושולחנו on a דאורייתא level.  The difference being not just semantics, but critical to the essence of the argument.  For, if a person always dwelt in a small sukkah (ראשו ורובו) without a table, Beis Shammai would say to them as they did to R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis on 28a: “In all your days you have never fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah”.  They did not state that he was dwelling in an invalid sukkah that was too small, but that they found him dwelling <strong>without a table</strong>.</p>\n<p>מתני׳ מי שהיה ראשו ורובו בסוכה ושולחנו בתוך הבית — בית שמאי פוסלין ובית הלל מכשירין. אמרו להם בית הלל לבית שמאי: לא כך היה מעשה שהלכו זקני בית שמאי וזקני בית הלל לבקר את רבי יוחנן בן החורנית, ומצאוהו שהיה יושב ראשו ורובו בסוכה ושולחנו בתוך הבית, ולא אמרו לו דבר. אמרו להם בית שמאי: משם ראיה?! אף הם אמרו לו: אם כן היית נוהג, לא קיימת מצות סוכה מימיך.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MF3Zm3pB.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MF3Zm3pB.gif\" alt=\"23\" /></a></p>\n<p>And this is the answer to confusion recorded in Mishna 28a between the students of Beis Hillel and the students of Beis Shammai.  The students of Beis Hillel viewed the dispute only in terms of the size of the sukkah and found a proof in the fact that the Elders of Beis Shammai did not say a word to R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis about the small size of the sukkah which was ראשו ורובו.  And Beis Shammai said, a proof from that!  But, the elders of Beis Shammai said to him that if you have always eaten without your table inside the sukkah, you have never fulfilled the mitzvah of sukkah.</p>\n<p>Restated in other words, since Beis Hillel holds that a sukkah is a דירת עראי, which limits the height of a sukkah in accordance with שבעת ימים to 20 amos, it allows a sukkah as small as ראשו ורובו in regard to length.  Therefore, the students of Beis Hillel viewed the dispute between ראשו ורובו and ראשו ורובו ושולחנו in terms of a measurement of length. And therefore, they found a proof that a sukkah is a דירת עראי from the fact that Elders of Beis Shammai did not say anything to R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis regarding the smallness of his sukkah.  Beis Shammai then discounted their proof and supported their own opinion that a sukkah is a דירת קבע in pointing out that while the Elders of Beis Shammai did not speak about the small size of R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis’ sukkah they strongly objected to his eating without a table.  Therefore, the Elders did object to the small size of R’ Yochanan ben HaChoranis’ sukkah at the same time that they were rebuking him for not eating from his table.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the punishment for someone who talks another person into committing suicide?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a famous case in the US of a young woman who basically pressures her online boyfriend to kill himself. The evidence was particularly damning against her and the case is clear that if she hadn't directly intervened the boyfriend wouldn't have killed himself. If you want to find out more details of the case, see here: <a href=\"https://www.boston25news.com/news/all-the-text-messages-between-michelle-carter-and-conrad-roy-they-day-he-died/532942907\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.boston25news.com/news/all-the-text-messages-between-michelle-carter-and-conrad-roy-they-day-he-died/532942907</a></p>\n\n<p>So the question is, what is the halakhic punishment of this crime? Also, what is the name of this crime? Is it murder? Manslaughter?</p>\n\n<p>*Update - I've changed the link to include all of the text messages between them so her level of involvement in the suicide is reflected.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Suicide = Self Murder = Murder</p>\n\n<p>There's no difference if you murder someone else, or if you murder yourself.</p>\n\n<p>If you consider murder to be a sin, then you should also consider suicide to be a sin.</p>\n\n<p>Hashem gave people freedom of choice, and the ability to choose good over evil. In the example given in the question, the suicide victim made a deadly choice to kill himself. Ultimately, the decision was his, and the responsibility for his death remains his. </p>\n\n<p>That being said, the person that egged him on to do the dastardly deed, would be guilty of violating several Torah prohibitions. To the best of my knowledge, these prohibitions do not carry any punishment by Beis Din. However they carry a punishment by Hashem in Heaven.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>מסית לדבר עבירה, incitement to sin.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[See Iggros Moshe (OC 1:99) that even though Beis Din only punishes a person who incites to idolatry, the prohibition against \"inciting\", applies to all sins, and in any case he is punished by the laws of heaven. See also ibid. (OC 2:7) for further discussion of this point].</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>לפני עור לא תתן מכשול, placing  a stumbling block before a blind person.\n[Vayikra 19:14]</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Included in this prohibition, is giving bad advice to another person. </p>\n\n<p>The worst \"bad advice\" that you can give a person, is \"advice\" to kill themselves.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>לא תעמוד על דם רעך,  You shall not stand by [the shedding of] your fellow's blood. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[Vayikra 19:16]</p>\n\n<p>Rashi interprets: \"To see his death and you can save him, such as drowning in a river and an animal or a bandits come upon him\".</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the woman had the power to save this man from murdering himself, and not only did she not save him, she was part of the cause of his death.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>הוכח תוכיח את עמיתך, rebuking a person who is doing a sin.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>[Vayikra 19:17]</p>\n\n<p>\"You shall surely rebuke your fellow, but you shall not bear a sin on his account.\"</p>\n\n<p>[See Rambam (Sefer Hamitzvos, Assei, 205) \"The 205th mitzvah is that we are commanded to admonish a person who is performing a transgression or who is preparing to do so. One must verbally warn him and admonish him...\"]</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the woman would be obligated to admonish the victim, and deter him from killing himself. Instead, she incited him to sin; the antithesis of rebuke.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If one persuades someone to kill someone else we know that there is punishment from G-d similar to one that actively kills someone else  as Dovid was blamed for killing Uria by sending him to the front lines  even though he did't physically kill him as it says in the Gemora Kiddushin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האומר לשלוחו צא הרוג את הנפש הוא חייב ושולחיו פטור שמאי הזקן אומר משום חגי הנביא שולחיו חייב שנא' (שמואל ב יב, ט) אותו הרגת בחרב בני עמון מאי טעמיה דשמאי הזקן קסבר שני כתובים הבאים כאחד מלמדין והוא ההוא לא דריש ואיבעית אימא לעולם דריש ומאי חייב חייב בדיני שמים מכלל דת\"ק סבר אפילו מדיני שמים נמי פטור אלא דינא רבה ודינא זוטא איכא בינייהו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam Hilchos Rotzeach 2,2 paskens such a case is liable to Misa bidei Shamayim which is death  executed by Heaven:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל [א] <strong>השוכר הורג להרוג את חבירו או ששלח עבדיו והרגוהו</strong>. או שכפתו והניחו לפני הארי וכיוצא בו והרגתהו חיה וכן ההורג את עצמו. כל אחד מאלו שופך דמים הוא. <strong>ועון הריגה בידו וחייב מיתה לשמים</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So too if someone persuades someone to kill themselves which is tantamount to killing someone else as clearly stated in the Rambam quoted, the same punishment should apply of Death executed by heaven for the crime of \"killing\" as quoted from Rambam.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, Shammai's adage did not apply to his situation in Maseches Shabbos:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Megachalei Hatorah Avos 1:15</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמאי אומר עשה תורתך קבע וכו' והוי מקבל כל אדם בסבר פנים יפות וראה בשבת\n  לא ע\"א ת\"ר מעשה בנכרי אחד שבא לפני שמאי אמר לו כמה תורות יש לכם וכו'\n  גער בו והוציאו בנזיפה בא לפני הלל גייריה וכו' שוב מעשה בנכרי אחד שבא\n  לפני שמאי א\"ל גיירני ע\"מ שתלמדני וכו' דחפו באמת הבנין וכו' עי\"ש וממעשה\n  זה שראינו יש בו תמיהה מרובה על ההלכה של שמאי שסותר עצמו במעשיו ונראה\n  לתרץ בס\"ד ע\"פ הנאמר בב\"מ קיד ע\"ב דתניא ר\"ש אומר קבריהן של עכו\"ם אין\n  מטמאין שנאמר ואתן צאני צאן מרעיתי אדם אתם אתם קרוין אדם ואין עכו\"ם\n  קרוין אדם (וע\"ע בע\"ז ג' ע\"א בתוס' ד\"ה כהנים) ולפי\"ז פשוט שבאם עכו\"ם לא\n  נכללים בגדר אדם מובן המשנה הוי מקבל כל אדם בסבר פנים יפות אדם דייקא\n  משא\"כ נכרי וכדומה שאין הוא צריך לקבלם בסבר פנים יפות ודו\"ק (ומצאתי שכן\n  כתב השפ\"א ותירץ בדרר אחר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Meir Yosef Katz in She'ar Yoseph on the Mishnah in Avos mentions a few possible resolutions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Shammai's statement in Avos is indeed an admission that Hillel's approach to the gentiles was correct.</li>\n<li>Shammai's statement was not applicable to converts who were trying to convert conditionally</li>\n<li>Gentiles are not included in אדם</li>\n<li>Shammai saw that the specific gentile was not an אדם</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You've asked a terrific question. <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:LGS512-OcAAJ:https://torah.org/learning/pirkei-avos-chapter1-15c/%3Fprintversion%3D1%20&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> provides good insight that Shammai's adage in Pirkei Avot and the situation described in Talmud Shabbat are not contradictory at all. Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is important to recognize, however, that Shammai was not merely\n  exhibiting impatience and short-temperedness. He certainly did believe\n  in greeting others cheerfully. Yet at times it is necessary to speak\n  up for one’s values. A person who wants to become Jewish in order to\n  wear the High Priest’s impressive vestments is seeing Judaism as\n  nothing more than a stepping stone towards fashion and high society\n  (this was an era in which much of the priestly class formed an\n  aristocracy, fashioned after Hellenistic society)</p>\n  \n  <p>Likewise, a person who expects to be taught the entire Torah while\n  standing on one foot is in effect stating that in his mind the Torah\n  is so shallow it can basically be condensed into a few meaningless\n  generalities. The fellow was clearly looking for fast and easy\n  inspiration, some quick- and-dirty spirituality which he could pick up\n  through no effort of his own.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shammai was hardly being impatient. He was simply standing up for what\n  matters. In his mind, he had just witnessed a terrible affront to\n  Judaism and all it stands for. And he was quick to tell the fellow\n  that coming to a rabbi looking for sweet religious nothings basically\n  misses (or attempts to ignore) the entire point of Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Mind you, Hillel had a very different approach to dealing with the Gentiles. So, this is not really a question of right vs. wrong. Theye are just two different approaches by two different people. However, Shammai's behavior, here, does not contradict his general adage to greet people cheerfully. Perhaps, for Shammai, this was an exception.</p>\n\n\n",

Yisrael Meir Kagan</a> writes that every Jewish man needs to know the weekly Torah portion and understand it. He says that the  reason why all of Israel reads the verses twice and the translation once (shenayim mikra v'echad targum) is that doing so leads one to understand the Torah. If that doesn't help you understand then you you have to understand it on your own; otherwise it does not count as learning:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Likutei Amarim Chapter 5</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומה שנהגו בכל ישראל לקרא שנים מקרא ואחד תרגום היינו משום שעל ידי זה\n  יתבונן בהמקרא ויתן לב להבין אבל אם לא השיג ידיעה על ידי זה מחויב\n  להתבונן ולדעת ואז יהיה נחשב לו שלמד מקרא דבלאו הכי אם לא הבין מה שאמר\n  ומה שלמד לא נחשב ללימוד כלל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The choice of wording here is interesting. He describes shenayim mikra as נהגו בכל ישראל, which implies that it is a strong minhag (custom) but not a formal rabbinic obligation. While the language of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Talmud</a><sup>1</sup> does not necessarily indicate that it is a formal obligation, it is codified as such in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishneh_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah</a><sup>2</sup> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a><sup>3</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>Should we then assume that R. Kagan was simply being imprecise in his wording, and actually agrees with these codifications that it is an obligation (especially as Likutei Amarim is not a formal halachic work), or does he in fact hold that shenayim mikra is \"just\" a minhag?

The only legitimate reason for divorce is adultery.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Is Shammai against divorce in general? Or maybe, if a wife doesn't commit adultery, and then she gets a divorce, Shammai thinks the divorce is null and void, and hence, when she gets another guy, it's still adultery, technically.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, if the wife commits adultery before, and the husband divorces her, then he doesn't make her an adulteress because she already is.</p>\n\n<p>What is Shammai's reasoning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The opinion of the House of Shammai, as quoted in the Mishnah (Gittin 90a), is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Beit Shammai say: A man may not divorce his wife unless he finds out about her having engaged in a matter of forbidden sexual intercourse [devar erva], as it is stated: “Because he has found some unseemly matter [ervat davar] in her, and he writes her a scroll of severance” (Deuteronomy 24:1).<br>\n  <sub>(edited from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.90a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria translation</a>)</sub></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If her husband did divorce her for less than adultery, the divorce is still valid, even though he wasn't allowed to have divorced her, as is clear from this discussion (on the same page):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Pappa said to Rava: What if the husband found about her neither forbidden sexual intercourse nor any other matter, but divorced her anyway?<br>\n  Rava said to him that the answer can be derived from what God reveals in the Torah with regard to a rapist: “He may not send her away all his days” (Deuteronomy 22:29), indicating that all his days he remains obligated to remarry her. Only there the husband is obligated to remarry her, as God reveals as much. But here, what he did, he did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Even though Rashi says the question is about the opinion of the House of Hillel, the answer is equally valid for the House of Shammai.)</p>\n\n<p>So she wouldn't be committing adultery if she remarried after being divorced for something other than adultery. Even though a woman who committed adultery remains forbidden to the person with whom she committed adultery even after the divorce (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%98%D7%94_%D7%94_%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sotah 5:1</a>), the divorce allows her to marry anyone else.</p>\n\n\n",

One boy and one girl, as\n  [implied by Genesis 5:2]: \"He created them, a male and a female.\" If\n  the son was a saris or the daughter an aylonit, he is not considered\n  to have fulfilled this mitzvah.

Avraham Ben HaRambam</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/93620/13438\">has a responsum in which he clarifies his father's view about the mitzvah of marriage</a>. In this responsum he distinguishes between the mitzvah of marriage and the mitzvah of peru u'revu. Defining the latter, he writes:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43006&st=&pgnum=77\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Birchat Avraham # 44</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומצות פריה ורביה מצוה אחרת היא שמצות פריה ורביה כשיהיה לו בן או בת\n  קיים המצוה</p>\n  \n  <p>And the commandment of being fruitful and multiplying is a separate\n  commandment; [regarding] the commandment of being fruitful and\n  multiplying, once he has a son or a daughter he has fulfilled the\n  commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is somewhat surprising, as R. Avraham appears to state that the commandment is fulfilled with just one child, boy or girl. This follows neither tannaic view, and is against the ruling of his father. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Meiselman\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Avraham? Does he actually hold that only one child is necessary, against both views in the Mishnah and against the codification of his father? Was he simply being imprecise in his description of the mitzvah? Do any subsequent authorities deal with this puzzling passage?</p>\n\n<p>My own intuition was that there might have been a typo/scribal error, and the words בן או בת really were בן ובת (i.e. an extra א was added) with the original meaning \"a son <strong>and</strong> a daughter\". Indeed I found one contemporary sefer that just casually said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נ' דצ\"ל בן ובת </p>\n  \n  <p>It appears that it should say \"a son and a daughter\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I don't have any manuscript evidence for this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>While he does not make any connection to the view of R. Avraham, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef Qafih</a> cites a view of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Sa'adia Gaon</a> that also considers the commandment to only require one child (at least nowadays).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commentary to Hilchot Ishut Chapter 15 Note 10</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב מבשר הבבלי בשם רס\"ג דמה שבא בתורה שבע\"פ דקיום מצות פריה ורביה\n  בשני בנים או בן ובת דוקא באותן הדורות שהיו ימיהם ארוכים אבל עתה באחד\n  מהם בלבד זכר או נקבה ע\"כ ראה פירושי רס\"ג לתורה מהדורתי בראשית ד יב\n  ואיני יודע יסוד לדעה זו והשוה רס\"ג בסוף ספרו האמו\"ד המאמר העשירי פ\"ט </p>\n  \n  <p>And the <em>Mevaser Habavli</em> wrote in the name of R. Sa'adia Gaon that\n  that which comes in the Oral Law that the fulfillment of the\n  commandment of being fruitful and multiplying is with two sons or a\n  son and a daughter, was specifically in those generations where their\n  lives were long. But now, with one of them alone – a male or female –\n  [it is enough to fulfill the commandment], end quote. See the\n  Commentary of R. Sa'adia Gaon to the Torah, my edition, Genesis 4:12.\n  And I don't know any foundation for this view. Cf. R. Sa'adia Gaon at\n  the end of his book <em>Emunot V'deiot</em> Essay 10 Chapter 9.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I found a contemporary sefer that actually used this question as a proof to his theory about the nature of the commandment of peru u'revu. R. Dovid Metzger argues that when we say that the commandment is to have a boy and a girl it does not mean that if you only have one child you have not fulfilled the commandment. Rather, every child born is a fulfillment of the commandment; the only question is about how much you are obligated to fulfill the commandment. Beit Shammai holds that you are obligated to continue until you have two sons, and Beit Hillel holds that you are obligated to continue until you have a son and a daughter.</p>\n\n<p>R. Metzger argues that this is the implication of various formulations of the law, particularly the formulation in the Mishnah. The Mishnah says that one should not abstain from the commandment unless he already has children. That implies that each child is a fulfillment of the commandment, but there is an obligation to continue fulfilling the commandment until a certain threshold is reached.</p>\n\n<p>R. Metzger then cites R. Avraham Ben Harambam as proof to this idea. If this idea is not true, then R. Avraham is flatly rejecting both opinions in the Mishnah, which is inconceivable. Therefore, it must be that R. Avraham is just saying that the commandment is <strong>fulfilled</strong> by having one child, but of course one is still obligated to further fulfill the commandment and have more children until he reaches the threshold mentioned in the Mishnah.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, according to R. Metzger, R. Avraham's formulation is not a mistake; it is in fact very precise, and it is in full agreement with the Mishnah and subsequent codifications of the law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Daliyos Dovid Siman 21</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונראה שלענין קיום המצוה לית מאן דפליג דלכו\"ע קיים מצות פר\"ו בין בב'\n  זכרים ובין בזכר ונקבה ואף בב' נקבות ויתירה מזו אפי' בבן אחד או בבת אחת\n  נתקיימה מצות פר\"ו וכל המחלוקת היא ממתי רשאי אדם ליבטל ממצוה זו ואינו\n  חייב יותר מן התורה להתעסק במצוה זו שהרי כך מורה לשון המשנה ביבמות שם\n  לא יבטל אדם מפריה ורביה אא\"כ יש לו בנים וכו' וכן בגמ' שם האי יש לו\n  בנים מפריה ורביה בטיל וכו' הרי שלא כתוב כאן שעור במצות פר\"ו שיהיה לו\n  ב' בנים אלא כתוב עד מתי אדם מחוייב במצוה זו ואינו רשאי ליבטל ממנה</p>\n  \n  <p>וכן מורה לשון הרשב\"א בתשו' ח\"ג סי' שלט לא אמרו במשנתינו שלא יבטל מפריה\n  ורביה אא\"כ יש לו בנים אלא יתעסק עד שיהיו לו שני זכרים לב\"ש וכו' וכן\n  מורה לשון תלמידו בספר החינוך מצוה א וז\"ל דיני המצוה וכו' וכמה בנים\n  יהיו לו ויפטר וכו' הרי שלא כתב וכמה בנים יהיו לו ויקיים מצוה זו אלא\n  ויפטר להורות שיש שיעור לחיוב אבל לא לקיום דהקיום הוא בכל בן או בת שאדם\n  מוליד </p>\n  \n  <p>והנה מצאתי בספר ברכת אברהם לרבינו אברהם בן הרמב\"ם סי' מד שמשמע להדיא\n  כן (דן שם בנוסח הרמב\"ם בענין כסף מדברי סופרים ר' לעיל פ\"א) וז\"ל שמצות\n  פריה ורביה כשיהיה לו בן או בת קיים המצוה ולכאורה דבריו מרפסין איגרי\n  שהרי משנה מפורשת ביבמות סא ב דלכו\"ע לא סגי באחד דבעינן שנים אולם להנ\"ל\n  אין כאן שום סתירה שכונת הדברים שקיום מצות פר\"ו יש בכל בן ובת שמולידים\n  ושעור החיוב שחייב במצוה זו עד כמה בנים או בנות שיש לו מחויב עדיין\n  לקיים מצוה זו בזה עוסקת המשנה</p>\n  \n  <p>ולפי\"ז יש לבאר גם את לשון הרמב\"ם כמה בנים יהיו לאיש ותתקיים מצוה זו\n  בידו שכונתו לומר שיותר אינו מחויב במצוה זו ותו לא אבל אין כונתו לומר\n  שבבן אחד או בת אחת לא קיים מצוה זו וגם בסברא לא יתכן לומר שמי שיש לו\n  עשרה בנים או עשר בנות לא קיים מצוה זו ומי שיש לו בן ובת קיים אלא ברור\n  שאין ספק שלגבי קיום המצוה כולם קיימוה וזה שיש לו עשרה בנים או עשר בנות\n  קיים עשר פעמים מצות פר\"ו אלא שעדיין הוא מחויב במצוה זו ואינו רשאי\n  ליבטל ממנה והדבר מוכרח בסברא וכי התורה מצוה אדם על דבר שאינו תלוי בו\n  אם הולד זכר או נקבה והרי זה תלוי בקב\"ה לבדו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is ta'am (flavor) physical or metaphysical?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud and Geonim seem to speak about ta'am and it's ability to transfer as being a very physical process. The literature reads as if one would be able to taste the transfer of flavor from one vessel to another. The Rambam flat out says that if one isn't sure if taste transferred, one should taste the mixture and see if taste transferred.</p>\n<p><strong>Mishneh Torah: Ma'achalot Assurot - Chapter 15:2</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is implied? When the fat of the kidneys3 falls into beans and\nbecomes dissolved, the beans should be tasted. If the taste of fat\ncannot be detected, they are permitted. If [not only] the taste, [but\nalso] the substance of the fat is present, they are forbidden\naccording to Scriptural Law. If the flavor could be detected, but\nthere is no substance, they are forbidden by Rabbinic Law.</p>\n<p>ב כיצד חלב הכליות שנפל לתוך הגריסין ונמוח הכל טועמין את הגריסין אם לא\nנמצא בהן טעם חלב הרי אלו מותרין ואם נמצא בהם טעם חלב והיה בהן ממשו הרי\nאלו אסורין מן התורה נמצא בהן טעמו ולא היה בהן ממשו הרי אלו אסורין\nמדברי סופרים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, many modern discussions do not seem to speak about ta'am in this way. I have never had a Rav suggest that I taste something to see if it's acceptable. Rather in my experience they speak about it in more of a metaphysical sense and say to just throw everything away in a case of doubt.</p>\n<p>Their words don't seem to be discussing a real physical entity, rather it sounds more like speaking about the transfer of purity or impurity, which can only be measured in the metaphysical/spiritual realm. An example of this would be speaking about flavor transfer without asking the question whether the material absorbed flavor to begin with, or checking to see if any flavor actually transferred.</p>\n<p>So which is it? Is ta'am a physical entity that can be measured by our tongues, or it it a metaphysical entity that we can't quantify or interact with in a physical way?</p>\n\n\n",

There is a concept known as a shomer/es, who if you are allowed to have yichud with them, you can have yichud with a different woman who you normally can't.

I plan on looking this up.</p>\n\n<p>Why? because electric lamps (in the time of RZSA) were Aish - fire, according to everybody.</p>\n\n<p>I did hear from The Shmirath Shabbat K'Hilchato - Rav Neuwirth זצ\"ל - in a Shiur in the 1980's that he said that RSZA said that if it were not for the stature of the Chazon Ish, he would argue that electricity is not forbidden because of Boneh-building.</p>\n\n<p>So if you get rid of the Bone and the Aish and no other Issur is involved, then that use of electricity could possibly be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Nothing about Minhag Avosainu. Maybe. See further:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Double AA also says that he heard orally that Rabbi SZA held that certain keilim are only assur because of a similar minhag. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For the record, DoubleAA wrote the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Eh. I respect your sourcing this, but I completely disagree with the metziut then. I heard orally in the name of R ShZ Aurbach that indeed there is no real reason to kasher certain keilim which are obviously clean, but we do it anyway because of a minhag avoseinu of equivalent level to minhag avoseinu of electricity on shabbat. I have also heard from different people that R H Schachter has joked a number of times about how all the rabbis should just get together and permit stainless steel as kosher. Even if there are blios in the pot, it seems they are so small to be halachikly negligible. – Double AA♦ Feb 14 '13 at 18:53 </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again, this is not what I heard from his very close disciple.</p>\n\n<p><strong>More to the point:</strong></p>\n\n<p>You asked:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, why is this not a minhag shtus/foolish minhag </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Because if great Rabbis didn't think so, then it isn't.</p>\n\n<p>A Minhag Shtus has no basis in Halacha. Forbidding electricity has a basis; Boneh according to the Chazon Ish. And maybe \"let's not confuse people between Aish electricity and <em>cold</em> electricity and forbid it all\" or whatever reasoning the Rabbis of yore had.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>EDIT if it only began because people believed/held its assur (in regard to electricity) according to Rav SZA. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>No. They asked there Rabbis, probably over 100 years ago, and those Rabbis decided it wasn't Shabbosdik.</p>\n\n<p>Oh, and how right they were. What would Shabbos Kodesh look like if we could use our phone, cellulars, boom-boxes and what not.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is he saying this (electricity minhag) is LIKE a minhag aveiseinu that we should still do it but don't really have to?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why do you think that <em>a Minhag Aveiseinu is something we do but don't really have to?</em></p>\n\n<p>Yom Tov Sheini is the classic Minhag Aveiseinu and Chazal have some very harsh words for people who think we don't really have to keep it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Or is it actually binding, and if so why?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Firstly, as I quoted, RSZA apparently said that he didn't have the authority/guts/foolishness to argue with the Chazon Ish. You can't simply discount the Chazon Ish, especially since a lot of electric appliances nowadays rely on opening and closing of circuits. (Again: Amazing how much foresight the Rabbis of yesteryear had.)</p>\n\n<p>Secondly, as we learn in Shas, the Rabbis had a habit of not informing the public of the real reasons behind their decrees, for at least a year. So it's possible that this isn't a Minhag, but a decree whose reason we don't know.</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, we know that Minhag Yisroel Torah. We also have cases where Minhag trumps Halacha. So, we don't know why, but we still have to do it.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line:</p>\n\n<p>RSZA wrote a lot about electricity. I suggest we all learn those pieces and find what he really said, instead of relying on rumours and memories from decades ago.</p>\n\n\n",

This concludes the baraita. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If your concern is the underlying linguistic/textual connection, the Bartenura reads</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>י\"ל דאשכחן התפלה נקראת חרב כדכתיב רוממות אל בגרונם וחרב פיפיות בידם. ומלת בקשתי דרשת כמו בקשתי מלשון תפלה ותחינה ובקשה והנה בחרבי ובקשתי היא חכמתי ותפלתי:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. J.B. Soloveitchik explained this as follows (<em>Siddur Mesorat HaRav</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since there is no record of Jacob ever having done battle with the\nAmorites, the Targum translates these two words metaphorically as\n\"בִּצלוֹתִי וּבבָעוּתִי, with my prayer and with my plea.\" The\ndistinction between the sword and the bow is that the sword is used\nfor close combat, while the bow and arrow are utilized from a\ndistance. Correspondingly, צלוֹתהוֹן, prayers, are our requests for\nimmediate personal needs, such as wisdom, health and sustenance, while\nבָּעוּתהוֹן, pleas, are the supplications that relate to Jewish\ndestiny and the ultimate redemption.</p>\n<p>An enigmatic verse in Isaiah\n(21:12) can be similarly explained: \"אָמַר שֹׁמֵר אָֽתָה בֹֽקֶר וגַם\nלָילָה אִם תִּבעָיוּן בּעָיוּ, The watchman said, ‘The morning comes,\nand also the night. If you will inquire, inquire.’\" The meaning of the\nphrase in Isaiah: \"אִם־תִּבעָיוּן בּעָֽיוּ, If you will inquire,\ninquire,\" is that the dawn of our salvation will break – even though\nwe are in the midst of a dark, bitter night of exile – if our vision\nis not limited to the present and immediate circumstances, but rather\nencompasses the boundless opportunities of redemption in the future.\nIf our view is not riveted in current historical circumstances, but\nrather glimpses our future destiny, salvation is at hand.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>At the simplest level, the point is <em>hakol kol yaakov vehayadayim yedei esav</em> -- Yaakov fights via prayer, while Esav fights with his fists. More accurately -- Yaakov knows that God is in control, so the true fight is with prayer. (Though he still was prepared to take up arms.) </p>\n\n<p>If I'm not mistaken it's R. Shimon Schwab who observes that a sword is always dangerous, and anyone can use one; a bow requires a lot more skill. He suggests that deeply emotional prayer is always effective (like a sword), whereas routine prayer needs a lot more work (like a bow). </p>\n\n\n",

The presence of HaShem is often pictured in the Tenach as a cloud or to dwell in a cloud (1 Kings 8:10-11, Exodus 19, 40:34-38 and other verses). \nThe cloud and thick fog were a form of ‘choshech’ (darkness) and choshech is the language of ‘holding back’, as it is written (Bereshit 22): “You [Avraham] have not held back (chasachta) your son, your only one.” </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp145.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this excerpt</a> from Part III Chapter IX of Rambam's Moreh Nevuchim should clarify the phrase that you mentioned as well as explain the general concept of how G-d reveals himself to man:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thus the prophets frequently hint at the existence of a partition\n  between God and us. They say He is concealed from us in vapours, in\n  darkness, in mist, or in a thick cloud: or use similar figures to\n  express that on account of our bodies we are unable to comprehend His\n  essence. This is the meaning of the words, \"Clouds and darkness are\n  round about Him\" (Ps. xcvii. 2). The prophets tell us that the\n  difficulty consists in the grossness of our substance: they do not\n  imply, as might be gathered from the literal meaning of their words,\n  that God is corporeal, and is invisible because He is surrounded by\n  thick clouds, vapours, darkness, or mist. This figure is also\n  expressed in the passage, \"He made darkness His secret place\" (Ps.\n  xviii. 12). The object of God revealing Himself in thick clouds,\n  darkness, vapours, and mist was to teach this lesson; for every\n  prophetic vision contains some lesson by means of allegory; that\n  mighty vision, therefore, though the greatest of all visions, and\n  above all comparison, viz., His revelation in a thick cloud, did not\n  take place without any purpose, it was intended to indicate that we\n  cannot comprehend Him on account of the dark body that surrounds us.\n  It does not surround God, because He is incorporeal. A tradition is\n  current among our people that the day of the revelation on Mount Sinai\n  was misty, cloudy, and a little rainy. Comp. \"Lord, when thou wentest\n  forth from Seir, when thou marchedst out of the field of Edom, the\n  earth trembled, and the heavens dropped water\" (Judges v. 4). <strong>The same\n  idea is expressed by the words \"darkness, clouds, and thick darkness\"\n  (Deut. iv. 11)</strong>. The phrase does not denote that darkness surrounds\n  God, for with Him there is no darkness, but the great, strong, and\n  permanent light, which, emanating from Him, illuminates all darkness,\n  as is expressed by the prophetic simile, \"And the earth shined with\n  His glory\" (Ezek. xliii. 2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is further support to the specific distinction between ערפל which is a thin cloud (See Rash\"i and Siftei Chachamim on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=288\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:9</a>) and is synonymous with the term עב הענן, and the term ענן used by itself which connotes a precipitous cloud that produced the thunder and lightning. This seems to be conveyed by Ibn Ezra on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9596&st=&pgnum=293\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:16</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

If you say that there is not one quality for the best, that cannot be, as Rav Ashi said: I was born on the first day of the week, and one cannot say that there was nothing good about him. Rather, it must mean that there is not one quality for the worst. Didn’t Rav Ashi say: I and Dimi bar Kakuzta were both born on the first day of the week. I became a king, the head of a yeshiva, and he became the head of a gang of thieves, clearly a negative quality. Rather, one born on a Sunday is either completely for the best or completely for the worst. What is the reason for this? It is because both light and darkness were created on the first day of Creation.</p>\n\n<p>האי מאן דבתרי בשבא יהי גבר רגזן מאי טעמא משום דאיפליגו ביה מיא האי מאן דבתלתא בשבא יהי גבר עתיר וזנאי יהא מאי טעמא משום דאיברו ביה עשבים האי מאן דבארבעה בשבא יהי גבר חכים ונהיר מאי טעמא משום דאיתלו ביה מאורות</p>\n\n<p>One who was born on the second day of the week, Monday, will be a short-tempered person. What is the reason for this? It is because on that day, the second day of Creation, the upper and lower waters were divided. Therefore, it is a day of contentiousness. \nOne who was born on the third day of the week will be a rich man and a promiscuous person. What is the reason for this? It is because on that day, the third day, vegetation was created. It grows abundantly but is also mixed together without boundaries between the grass and the plants. \nOne who was born on the fourth day of the week will be a wise and enlightened person. What is the reason for this? It is because the heavenly lights were hung in the heavens on that day, and wisdom is likened to light.</p>\n\n<p>האי מאן דבחמשה בשבא יהי גבר גומל חסדים מאי טעמא משום דאיברו ביה דגים ועופות האי מאן דבמעלי שבתא יהי גבר חזרן אמר רב נחמן בר יצחק חזרן במצות האי מאן דבשבתא יהי בשבתא ימות על דאחילו עלוהי יומא רבא דשבתא אמר רבא בר רב שילא וקדישא רבא יתקרי</p>\n\n<p>One who was born on the fifth day of the week will be a person who performs acts of kindness.

They are sustained by the kindness of God alone. \nOne who was born on the sixth day of the week will be a seeker. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said that this means that he will be one who seeks out mitzvot, as most of the activity on Friday involves preparation for Shabbat. \nOne who was born on Shabbat will die on Shabbat, because they desecrated the great day of Shabbat on his behalf. Rava bar Rav Sheila said: And he will be called a person of great sanctity because he was born on the sacred day of Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there a difference between meat/wine and other restrictions after delayed Tisha B'av\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since the burning of the Temple began on the ninth day of <em>Av</em> and continued on the tenth, therefore it is a good custom not to eat meat on the day after <em>Tisha B'av</em> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2919\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Shulchan Aruch</em> OC 558:1</a>), at least until midday (<em>Rema</em>, ibid.). <em>Magen Avraham</em> quoting <em>Maharshal</em> adds that other restrictions of the nine days (bathing, laundering, haircuts) also similarly apply till then. When <em>Tisha B'av</em> falls on <em>Shabbos</em> though and the fast is pushed off to Sunday, a restriction on eating meat and drinking wine still applies for that night (<em>Rema</em> OC 558:1), but the other restrictions do not (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&st=&pgnum=70\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mishnah Berurah</em> 558:4</a>). What is the reason for this difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There's little reason to expect them to have the same rule. When the day after the fast of <em>Tisha Bav</em> is on 10 Av there is the reason you stated to adopt the restrictive custom: the Temple started burning on 9 Av but continued burning on 10 Av. (Considering that it's actually amazing how lenient we are on 10 Av!)</p>\n\n<p>But that doesn't apply when the day after the fast of <em>Tisha Bav</em> is 11 Av. Nothing happened on 11 Av. So everything should be permitted immediately. Nevertheless there is a custom that you cite to avoid meat and wine that night since it is inappropriate or at least can seem inconsiderate to go straight from such intense mourning to such nice food (\"מפני אבלות של יום because of the mourning from that day\"). Some authorities (Pri Chadash, Birkei Yosef, Kaf HaChayim ad loc) think such a custom is really unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef makes this distinction nicely quoting the Maharil:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל שלא לאכול בשר ולשתות יין ליל מוצאי ט\"ב נ\"ל דיש ג\"כ למנוע כה\"ג למי שנוהג שלא לאכול במוצאי ט\"ב דאין זה משום חומרא דריב\"ז דבו נשרף ההיכל דאפי' מי שאוכל ביום י' בשר יש שנמנעים במוצאי ט\"ב משום חומרא דתענית ואבילות של יום ושייך לבין המצרים:‏<br>\n  To not eat meat or drink wine the night after Tisha Bav [when it was postponed to Sunday] it seems to me that you should also avoid it if you avoid it after a [regular] Tisha Bav, for that is not because of [the story of the Temple burning into 10 Av] for even some of those people who eat meat on 10 Av avoid it on the night after Tisha Bav because of the stringency of the fast and the mourning [nature] of the day and it belongs to the [time period of] \"in the straights\" (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eikha 1:3</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the stringency you see on 10 Av over 11 Av is not at all unexpected.</p>\n\n<p>But that's still all just about meat and wine and why they'd be more likely to be restricted on 10 Av than 11 Av.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the extra restrictions of washing/laundering/haircutting, as it happens, we have the original source of imposing them on 10 Av, a practice not mentioned in any of the Rishonim. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Luria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharshal</a> (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43034&pgnum=132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">responsum #92</a>) thought it logical to be strict to treat 10 Av like the first days of Av which are also customary additions to the laws of the week of Tisha Bav, and luckily for you he directly addresses the case of a postponed fast:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"כ העשירי שהוא בעל מיצרא דט\"ב ובו נשרף עיקר הבית כ\"ש דלא גרע מהני ימים דהן מר\"ח שנהגו בו איסו' אע\"פי שאינם בשבוע שחל ט\"ב בשלמא לפי דין התלמוד לא קשה מידי דלא אסרו אלא עד התעני' לא גזרו אלא בכח שהציבור יכולין לעמוד בה אבל עכשיו שנהגו וקבלו עליהם איסור אכילת בשר ושתיית יין ורחיצה מה שלא אסרה התלמוד משום צער בעלמא לזכור חורבן הבית ולהעלו' על לבם תוגה א\"כ כ\"ש בעשירי שהרי מצינו בירושלמי שהחכמים הראשונים היו נוהגין לעשות אותו כט' באב לעניין צום משום דרכי יוחנן שאמר אלמלא הייתי שם הייתי קובע בעשירי ומ\"מ נראה היכא שחל ט' באב בשבת ונדחה דשרי אחר התענית הכל שהרי כבר עבר אף העשירי וכן מצאתי להדיא שאפילו במוצא התענית שרי מיד לאכול בשר ולשתות יין אלא שהקארו כתב שב\"ל לאסור למי שכבר נהג שלא לאכול בשר במוצאי ט\"ב דאין זו משום חומרא דר\"יב דבו נשרף ההיכל דאפילו מי שאוכל בשר ביום העשירי נמנע במוצאי ט\"ב משום חומרא דתענית ואיבולו של יום ושייך לבין המצרים ע\"כ וכתב מילתא בלא טעמא ומ\"מ נראו דבריו לפי שמצאתי בספר חסידים שכתבו שעיקר תעני' מעליית' היינו שלא לאכול בשר ולא לשתות יין לא בכניסת התענית ולא במוצאי תענית א\"כ כ\"ש בתענית זה שכבר היה ראוי להפסיק מבע\"י שראוי למנוע מבשר ויין בלילה שלאחר תענית<br>\n  10 Av which is the neighbor of Tisha Bav and on it most of the Temple was burned all the more so that it is no worse than the [those days] from Rosh Chodesh [before] the week of Tisha Bav. In the days of the Talmud they only enacted restrictions [on the week of Tisha Bav because] that's what the community could handle, but now that we accepted [various restrictions even earlier] to remember the destruction of the Temple... all the more so [should they apply] on 10 Av for the Yerushalmi mentions [certain rabbis would <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43867/extended-fasting-on-10-av\">fast on 10 Av too</a>]. Nevertheless when [Tisha Bav is postponed to Sunday] everything is permitted right after the fast... But I saw R. [Yosef] Karo wrote [to forbid meat anyway that night] and he wrote something that is without [good] reason; nevertheless I see his conclusion for I found in Sefer Chasidim that the ideal fast involves not eating meat or drinking wine at the start or end of a fast [which should certainly apply to Tisha Bav].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not everyone was so excited about his imposing new restrictions on 10 Av (see Beiur Halakha) but you can hopefully see why no one ever extended his stringency to the night of 11 Av.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does a Shli'ach for carrying adopt the sender's designation of the item?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.10.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Shabbos 10,1</a> says about מלאכת הוצאה:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"הַמַּצְנִיעַ לְזֶרַע וּלְדֻגְמָא וְלִרְפוּאָה, וְהוֹצִיאוֹ בְּשַׁבָּת, חַיָּב בְּכָל שֶׁהוּא. וְכָל אָדָם אֵין חַיָּב עָלָיו אֶלָּא כְשִׁעוּרוֹ.: \"</p>\n<p>If one designates a seed for planting before Shabbos, and then carries it out on Shabbos, even though it's less than the amount that makes one liable for a Korban Chatas, he still has to bring a Korban Chatas because he designated it for planting. However, if someone else carries that seed on Shabbos [without that intention], they would not have to bring a Korban Chatas unless he carries a certain amount.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What if the one who designated the seed asked someone else to carry it on Shabbos - would either of them be required to bring a Chatas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think it would depend on the agent's intent.</p>\n\n<p>The reason why one becomes liable for carrying when the item was predesignated is that the predesignation shows us that the carrier is carrying the item for the specific purpose (in the case of a seed, to plant it), and that shows that he considers the item \"significant\". Even though someone else carrying the same item would be exempt because it is \"insignificant\", by predesignating the item the carrier has made it significant vis-a-vis himself.</p>\n\n<p>Predesignation is just one example of creating \"significance\". In fact the Talmud immediately asks why the Mishnah spoke of a case of predesignatioon, and not simply a case of someone who took out a seed to plant. The Talmud answers the Mishnah is teaching us that even in a case where the person forgot what he had designated it for, so it is unknown why he is currently carrying the item, he is still liable for carrying any size because we follow his original intent when he designated it and we consider it \"significant\" vis-a-vis him.</p>\n\n<p>This indicates that the designation is not necessary to make one liable. As long as one clearly carries for a purpose which shows \"significance\" then he is liable. This is clearly stated by Rashi <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=90b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודאי מוציא לזריעה חייב ואף על גב דלא אצנעיה מעיקרא ומתניתין דבעי מצניע\n  במוציא סתם קאמר כגון לטלטלו מבית לבית דאינו חייב אלא משום דאחשביה\n  בהצנעתו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is also clear from Rambam's codification of this law. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1526\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Shabbat 18:20</a> he first mentions the case of one who carried the seed in order to plant it, and rules that he is liable, and only in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=1527\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the next halacha</a> does he introduce the idea that predesignation is enough to make him liable when it is unknown why he is carrying it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במה דברים אמורים שאינו חייב אלא על ההוצאה כשיעור כשהוציא סתם אבל\n  המוציא לזרע או לרפואה או להראות ממנו דוגמא ולכל כיוצא בזה חייב בכל\n  שהוא</p>\n  \n  <p>When does [the abovementioned rule,] that a person is liable only when\n  he transfers the minimum of a standard measure of a substance, apply?\n  When the person transfers the substance without any specific intent.\n  If, however, a person transfers a [seed] to sow, or a substance for\n  medicinal purposes, to show as an example, or the like, he is liable\n  for the slightest amount. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/935239/jewish/Shabbat-Chapter-Eighteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n  \n  <p>המצניע דבר לזריעה או לרפואה או לדוגמא ושכח למה הצניעו והוציאו סתם חייב\n  עליו בכל שהוא שעל דעת מחשבה ראשונה הוציא. ושאר האדם אין חייבין עליו\n  אלא כשיעורו זרק זה שהוציא כבר לתוך האוצר אע\"פ שמקומו ניכר כבר בטלה\n  מחשבתו הראשונה לפיכך אם חזר והכניסו אינו חייב עד שיכניס כשיעור</p>\n  \n  <p>Should a person who stores a substance to use as seed, or to use for\n  medicinal purposes, or a substance to be shown as a sample,\n  [afterwards,] forget the reason for which he stored the substance,\n  and remove it without any specific intent, he is liable\n  regardless of its size. Another person, by contrast, is not liable\n  [if he transfers this article] unless it is of the prescribed\n  measure.</p>\n  \n  <p>If after transferring the article [for the intent he originally had],\n  the person throws it into a storeroom, even if it is [set aside] in a\n  distinct place, his original intent is considered to have been\n  nullified. Therefore, if he brings in the article afterwards, he is\n  not liable unless it is of the prescribed measure. (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/935239/jewish/Shabbat-Chapter-Eighteen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad.org</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From the above we see that predesignation has no inherent effect on Shabbat-violation-liability; it is simply a metric used to determine why the carrier is carrying it. When the carrier is the one who made the designation then the designation is relevant to determining liability (in the backhanded sense that it shows his intent). When the carrier is someone else, however, the designation is completely irrelevant because one person's designation doesn't speak to another person's intent. There could, of course, be other factors that could demonstrate that an agent does consider an item \"significant\" despite lacking the normal size requirement, but these factors don't necessarily have anything to do with whether the item was predesignated or not.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, to answer your question, the agent would be exempt because there is no indication that he considers the seed \"significant\". If, however, there was some other indication that the agent does consider the seed \"significant\" (and one could perhaps argue that accepting the mission is such an indication) then the agent would be liable, but not because of the predesignation.</p>\n\n<p>The sender/designator would be exempt regardless, because he did not violate any Shabbat labors.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I recommend looking at Kiddushin <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.42b.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">42b</a>-43a. The Gemara there discusses the concept of אין שליח לדבר עבירה, that if Reuven asks Shimon to do an aveirah, Shimon is the one liable while Reuven is entirely exempt. Reuven can tell Shimon דברי הרב ודברי התלמיד דברי מי שומעין - I told you to do X and G-d told you to do Y; who should you listen to?!</p>\n\n<p>There are several exceptions to this rule, as discussed there:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Me’ilah - If Reuven tells Shimon to spend certain coins in the marketplace and it turns out that those coins are Hekdesh, Reuven is the one liable, not Shimon. </li>\n<li>Tevichah u’Mechirah - If Reuven tells Shimon to steal and shecht/sell a cow or sheep, Reuven is the one who pays the four/fivefold payment, not Shimon. </li>\n<li>Shlichus Yad - <em>According to Beis Hillel only,</em> if Reuven is watching an object and tells Shimon to make use of it, Reuven is the one who is liable, not Shimon.<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Murder - <em>According to Shammai in the name of Chagai the Navi</em>, if Reuven tells Shimon to kill someone, Reuven is the one liable, not Shimon.<sup>2,3</sup>\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>According to the Tanna Kamma in the second explanation of the Gemara</em>, Reuven will bear some level of responsibility, but not the full level of punishment like an actual murderer. </li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, to answer your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Can a Shli’ach be exempt where the Sender is liable?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes, in all of the above cases, and in those cases alone. Therefore, in your case of Hotza’ah, the person who actually carried it is liable, since אין שליח לדבר עבירה. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> According to Beis Shammai, the general rule applies here as well, and the extra passuk means that even a thought of doing Shlichus Yad makes you liable. </p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup>The Tanna Kamma says that Shimon is the one who is liable, not Reuven. I discuss their argument in more detail <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/83904/9682\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p><sup>3</sup>Rava notes that if you learn that Shammai in general holds אין שליח לדבר עבירה, in a case where Shimon gets benefit, such as eating treif or being intimate with a prohibited woman, Shimon would be liable, since in no case will Shimon benefit but Reuven be the one liable. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hashem's infinite power\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard many times that Hashem is infinitely powerful. But how do we know this? Perhaps he's just very powerful or even all powerful (possessing all power there is, which is possibly finite). Is there a source for the 'infinite'? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Rambam says that \"all powerful\" is actually a description of what G-d isn't. (Guide to the Persplexed, 1:15). And if G-d did have attributes, there would have to be a cause for that composite coming together. Since G-d is the Creator, not a created entity, He must be Purely One, without any real attributes. (ibid book 2, intro. postulate #21.) These \"attributes\" are really approximate statements based on what Hashem isn't.</p>\n\n<p>(Philosophers call this approach to theology the Via Negativa -- the path of denials. The Rambam also describes a second kind of \"attribute of G-d\", those that describe how his Action looks to us. \"Just as He is called compassionate, so too should you be compassionate.\" -Hilkhos Dei'os 1:6)</p>\n\n<p>Let me start with an easier example of a negative \"attribute\": Omnipresence.</p>\n\n<p>Where is \"1 + 1 = 2\". On the one hand, you can say it's everywhere, because there is no place in the universe where 1 + 1 will equal anything but 2. On the other hand, it's a concept. It doesn't have a volume; it doesn't take up space. One can also say \"1 + 1 = 2\" is nowhere.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, location isn't really applicable to Hashem, so one can describe G-d as both everywhere and nowhere, depending on perspective. Although we tend to use \"<em>shebashayim</em> -- Who is in heaven\" rather than \"nowhere\" to mean spaceless existence.</p>\n\n<p>We talk about G-d always having Been and always will Be. But again, in reality what we are approximating is the idea that Hashem is \"<em>lemaalah min hazman</em> -- beyond time.\" \"When\" isn't a meaningful thing to say about G-d.</p>\n\n<p>With those two examples setting a pattern, let's look at Omnipotence.</p>\n\n<p>We aren't so much saying that Hashem has Infinite Power vs A Real Lot of Power. Rather, the expression means that Hashem doesn't even involve the concept of power. Hashem's Will simply becomes reality in a way that doesn't involve power. Therefore He can't have too little power to get anything done.</p>\n\n<p>Which is the same effect to our eyes as if Hashem had infinite power -- anything He Wills to happen will happen. Omnipotence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question is truly philosophical, but in Judaism, those things are taken for granted.

It is not because of He \"split the sea\" or He did miracles.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Hashem's omnipotence is theoretical</strong>, i.g. it is accepted de-jure, as an axiom. To understand that you have to understand \"how G-d works\" in Judaism.</p></li>\n<li><p>When we think of power, we think of an <strong>external power</strong> - ability to influence things that are external to the source. E.g. you have the power to lift a stone because that stone is external to you. But, can you lift your blood, your brain, and heart? This is meaningless - you may have control over it but not physical \"power\"</p></li>\n<li><p>According to Judaism, G-d is ALL, and there's nothing beyond or beside Him (hard to grasp but try to).

My main question is how do people in these circumstances handle all the extra duties that are required, especially if the distance to a Shul is too great and moving is impossible. Are there steps they can take to begin the conversion or is that basically not an option?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You have asked a useful, practical question. My thoughts on this - much based from experience being a religious Jew as well as some experience of conversing with a close friend of eventually converted.</p>\n\n<p>There is a general rule that we try to discourage people from converting. Religious Jewish life poses many challenges for Jews, and these challenges can seem even greater for a Gentile. I don't want to detail much how things are more expensive. However, I recommend that you consider the expense factor carefully before you decide to convert. The decision is not reversible. Ask a rabbi or a practicing religious Jew to detail the expenses among the other time commitments involved, if you want a better idea.</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned - distance to shul, etc. Technically, of course, you can be Jewish without attending shul, ever. There are numerous Jews throughout the world who never attend shul or observe Shabbat. They are Jews \"in name\", in my opinion. Statistics show that their children have a high likelihood of intermarriage, and as a result of that, if it's a man marrying a Gentile woman, the Jewish continuity stops.</p>\n\n<p>My point is, that continuous ritual is extremely important. It need not be everything, but it should, at least involve Shabbat / holiday observance and having a kosher home. Those two tend to be the \"essentials\" and insure continuity. Yes - they are expensive. Perhaps, you can get some assistance to manage these expenses. But, I strongly recommend that if you decide to convert, be prepared to fund and deal with these expenses for the remainder of your life and make them priority. If you have no means to do this - either yourself or via assistance / funding from someone, then I think conversion may not be the right route for you.</p>\n\n<p>My friend converted about 30 years ago, when she was single. She didn't completely calculate how difficult it would be when she married about 10 years after she converted. She struggled but managed for many years. The community pitched in, frequently. She occasionally told me, \"I wish I had known how expensive this was.\" In her case, I don't think it would have affected her decision. But the fact that she has said this several times, is some indication that knowing this beforehand would have helped her make a better educated decision.</p>\n\n\n",

When Rambam permits remaining unmarried he is referring only to inherent obligations.</li>\n<li>The obligation to get married is only to prevent suspicion; therefore, in a situation where there would be no suspicion (e.g. she lives in her father's house, or there are no men around) she can remain unmarried.</li>\n<li>Women are not obligated to get married but it is <strong>recommended</strong> in order to prevent suspicion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is probably best summed up in the words of the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14243&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan E.H. 1:3</a> where he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם הכל לפי הענין</p>\n  \n  <p>However, everything is [determined] by the situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I would only comment on Alex's answer but it gets lengthy. </p>\n\n<p>I'll summarize the Sugyia:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>There's a dispute between Rishonim if the Kiddushin is a stand-alone Mitzvah (Rambam and Chinuch) (to form a union) or it is just a tool to bring and raise kids, which is an explicit Mitzvah (Ramban I think and more).</p></li>\n<li><p>From the former point of view even if the woman does not take an active action in Kiddushin (she's only \"being Mekudeshet\"), she assists her husband in the Mitzvah of Kiddushin and living together in Kiddushin (AKA suspicion of immoral code etc) and is mildly obligated to do so.</p></li>\n<li><p>From the latter POV, as the resolution of the Gemora (there are opposite views of course) is that a woman is exempt from the Mitzvah of procreation, there's no obligation to get married as an instrument for that.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In any way, she cannot be forced not by a Beit Din, not by her parents.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Arukh (OC 559:9) rules like the Mordechai that the members of a circumcision (father/self, Mohel, Sandek) can break their fast in the afternoon after Mincha. Most Rishonim though don't mention this and indeed many communities do not practice it (Arukh haShulchan ibid., Peulat Tzaddik 3:147, Teshuvot veHanhagot 2:252). In many places the circumcision is done at the very end of the day with the meal following nightfall, just like any other Tisha Bav.</p>\n\n<p>Some recent authorities have extended this leniency to various cases of illness or weakness to varying degrees, but this appears to have been a minority view. See discussion <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93941\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Magen Avraham (OC 557) quotes the Shelah that Nachem is said at all prayers when fasting on 10 Av, since one of the reasons why some only say it at Mincha on regular Tisha Bav is that the Temple only started burning in the afternoon of 9 Av and continued through 10 Av. This is quoted by a number of later sources, though the Levushei Serad claims that this only applies when fasting on 10 Av in addition to 9 Av, so it may not apply in your case.</p>\n\n<p>For the general population though all the regular restrictions (eat, drink, shoes, Torah study, etc.) apply as usual. Tisha Bav is not a Torah command, and the same Sages who instituted it on 9 Av in general instituted to observe it on 10 Av in this sort of year.</p>\n\n\n",

Yitzchok Adlerstein</a>, based on the writings of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholom_Noach_Berezovsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nesivos Sholom</a>, discusses this in an article <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/nesivosshalom-holiday/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Some key excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah calls us banim, children of Hashem. Fatherly love comes in different forms. The most obvious is the love shared at close range. Separate the father from the son, and the love is now compounded by yearning, by the gnawing pain of distance. If we push further yet, we can detect another variety of love, still stronger than the others. Imagine a child deathly ill, desperately in need of surgery. The father is a surgeon, and only he can save the child. The child pierces his heart with his cries. When he places the blade of the scalpel against the tender skin of the child, the parent might as well be cutting into his own flesh. The love that the father feels at that moment is the strongest of all the contradictory and tempestuous emotions. Seeing the child in dire peril, realizing its utter helplessness, save for the intervention of the father – these produce a love beyond any other situation.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is Tisha B’Av, and this is why it is a “holiday” like no other. The love of HKBH for Klal Yisrael is without condition and without bounds. In our moment of greatest weakness, and greatest vulnerability, the compassion of our Father is moved as on no other day. He displayed this love through the paradoxical embrace of the cheruvim, signifying the closeness between Hashem and Klal Yisrael at a time we might have expected Him to emphasize separation and distance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[C]onsider what transpired at the time of the churban. Jews became aware that enemy soldiers were not only on Har Habayis, but had entered the Kodesh Kodoshim. Ordinarily, only the Kohen Gadol would enter, and only on Yom Kippur after elaborate preparation, and as part of a complex avodah. Yet now the enemy impudently entered and defiled it, mocking the Temple, its people and its G-d.</p>\n  \n  <p>No greater insult to national pride could be contemplated. Their personal despair was now compounded by national disgrace and degradation. All who understood what had happened were tortured, broken souls. Those souls still longed for Hashem, wanted desperately to feel close again, even though – or because – they sensed that they had fallen into a spiritual pit.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hashem cherishes the soul that is broken and turns to Him. He reacted to a nation of broken souls by displaying the cheruvim locked in embrace, as if at time of great closeness. And indeed it was. Klal Yisrael’s yearning for Him when He appeared distant led to His reasserting His commitment to them. This is the stuff a moed is made of – a time of special encounter and discovery. Tisha B’Av was indeed a holiday.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Because it will be. “Thus says the Lord of hosts:\n‘The fast of the fourth month,\nThe fast of the fifth,\nThe fast of the seventh,\nAnd the fast of the tenth,\nShall be joy and gladness and cheerful feasts\nFor the house of Judah.\nTherefore love truth and peace.' \"\nZechariah 8:19</p>\n\n\n",

I assume these reports are based on the controversial custom reported by the Ramo (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.553.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 553:2</a>) to refrain from studying Torah after <em>chatzos</em> on <em>erev tisha b'av</em>, even if it falls out on shabbos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונהגו שלא ללמוד בערב תשעה באב מחצות ואילך כי אם בדברים המותרים בתשעה באב ולכן אם חל בשבת אין אומרים פרקי אבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are these reports then based on a misreading of the Ramo (rendering \"אם חל בשבת\" as \"if it [the 9th of Av] falls out on Shabbos\" rather than as the seemingly more reasonable [8th of Av]) or is there some reason to be <em>stricter</em> after midday (even though we are generally more lenient after chatzos on Tisha B'Av, e.g. re sitting low, etc.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This issue is discussed at some length by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.553.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 553:7</a> (on the words of Rema which you quoted):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"כ ק\"ו אם חל ט\"ב בשבת שאסור ללמוד כל היום דהא אסור מדינא ללמוד בט\"ב ועוד דהא דברים שבצנעה נוהג כמ\"ש סימן תקנ\"ד סי\"ט ובתשו' מור\"ם לובלין כ' אם חל ט\"ב בשבת מותר ללמוד דתשמיש גופא חומרא יתירה היא והבו דלא לוסיף עלה עכ\"ל וצ\"ע שלא הביא דברי רמ\"א מיהו בתשו' מהרי\"ל כ' וז\"ל ט\"ב שחל בשבת אסור ללמוד אחר חצות כמו בחול עכ\"ל משמע דקודם חצות מותר ונ\"ל הטעם כיון שנדחה נדחה ואין לו דין ט\"ב רק דין עט\"ב ומ\"מ לענין תשמיש מחמרינן אבל בד\"מ הביא בתשובת מהרי\"ל עט\"ב שחל בשבת וכ\"ה בסימני תשו' מהרי\"ל וא\"כ אין ראי' משם ובכ\"ה מתיר ללמוד בעט\"ב שחל בשבת ואוסר בט\"ב עצמו שחל בשבת ול\"נ להחמי' בשניהם דהא יכול ללמוד דברי' המותרים בט\"ב וכן אשכחן בגמ' שקרא ר' במגילת איכ' בט\"ב שחל בשב' עמ\"ש סי' תקנ\"ד ס\"ד:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rather than translating directly, I'll attempt to summarize the positions he quotes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Magen Avraham believes that Rema would forbid Torah study the entirety of Shabbat 9th Av, as private mourning practices are in effect. When Rema here says that Torah study is forbidden after midday only, that is referring to Shabbat 8th Av.</p></li>\n<li><p>Maharam Lublin permits Torah study on Shabbat 9th Av (seemingly all day). Forbidding marital relations on this day is itself a novel position to which we do not wish to add. Magen Avraham notes that this seems to be unlike the position of Rema here, who would presumably at the very least forbid Torah study after midday. [Joel K - It is not clear what Maharam Lublin's position is regarding Torah study on Shabbat 8th Av but presumably he would also permit it all day.]</p></li>\n<li><p>Maharil forbade Torah study after midday on Shabbat. It is unclear if this is referring only to Shabbat 8th Av (and on Shabbat 9th Av it would be forbidden all day), or also to Shabbat 9th Av. If Maharil is indeed referring also to Shabbat 9th Av, Magen Avraham explains that this is because essentially the fast is totally pushed off until Sunday, such that Shabbat 9th Av has only the rule of Erev Tish'ah B'Av (with an added stringency forbidding marital relations).</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9342&st=&pgnum=154\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kenesset HaGedolah</a> permits Torah study all day on Shabbat 8th Av and forbids it from midday on Shabbat 9th Av. [Joel K - Looking at Kenesset HaGedolah in the original, he explains that the custom to refrain from Torah study on Erev Tish'ah B'Av is strong enough to apply on Shabbat 9th Av (which has the status of Erev Tish'ah B'Av) but not on Shabbat 8th Av.]</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Magen Avraham's conclusion is a little unclear. He seems to be either endorsing position 1, or possibly the second option in position 3.</p>\n\n<p>The position which you quote, forbidding Torah study only from midday on Shabbat 9th Av, seems to be the second of the two possibilities assigned to Maharil, and possibly endorsed by Magen Avraham. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.553.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 553:9</a> also rules that is permitted to study Torah on Shabbat 9th Av before midday.</p>\n\n<p>To conclude it is instructive to consider the words of Ma'amar Mordechai, quoted by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Biur_Halacha.553.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bi'ur Halachah to 553:2</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואיך שיהיה נלענ\"ד דאין לחוש לזה לפי שאין לנו טעם נכון לאסור הלימוד בשבת כלל ומש\"כ הרב מגן אברהם להחמיר מטעם דיכול ללמוד דברים המותרים בט\"ב אומר אני שאין זה מספיק לפי שאין אדם לומד אלא מה שלבו חפץ ועינינו הרואות דכמה ת\"ח מתרשלים בלימוד המותר ביום ט\"ב עצמו משום דצער הוא להם ללמוד במה שאינם רגילין וגם אני בעוה\"ר כאחד מהם ולכן איני חושש לסברא זו ודעתי נוטה להתיר אפילו בחול עד סמוך לביה\"ש ואי לאו דמיסתפינא מחברייא הו\"א דאפילו ביום ט\"ב עצמו היה לנו להקל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He writes that he believes that there is no good reason to forbid Torah study on Shabbat at all (8th or 9th Av), as it causes people to learn less Torah (as they are unused and unwilling to learn the topics which are permitted on Tish'ah B'av). Further, he would even go as far as to permit learning on Erev Tish'ah B'Av after midday on a weekday, and (possibly with a touch of hyperbole) would even have allowed learning on Tish'ah B'Av itself, were he not afraid of his colleagues. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Nebuchadnezzar's statue an image of Daniel himself?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The third chapter of Daniel brings the story of how King Nebuchadnezzar erected a statue made of gold for the people of the land to worship. (Ultimately, this is the story of how Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, Daniel's three friends, were thrown into a furnace for not bowing down to the idol but miraculously survived.)  The first thing noticeable about this chapter is that Daniel is missing from the narrative. The Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.93a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 93a</a>) tells us the reason behind Daniel's absence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Sages taught: Three were</strong> partners <strong>in that plan</strong> to ensure that Daniel would not be in Babylonia when the decree of persecution was in effect: <strong>The Holy One, Blessed be He; Daniel; and Nebuchadnezzar. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: Let Daniel go from here,</strong> <strong>so that</strong> people <strong>would not say</strong> that Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were delivered from the fiery furnace <strong>due to the virtue of</strong> Daniel, rather than due to their own righteousness.</p>\n<p><strong>And Daniel said</strong> to himself: <strong>I will go</strong> away <strong>from here so</strong> that this verse <strong>will not be fulfilled in my</strong> regard: <strong>“The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire”</strong> (Deuteronomy 7:25). Daniel was concerned that because Nebuchadnezzar worshipped him like a deity, his legal status was that of an idol, and he would be burned.</p>\n<p><strong>And Nebuchadnezzar said: Daniel should go</strong> away <strong>from here so</strong> that the people <strong>will not say:</strong> Nebuchadnezzar <strong>burned his god in fire. And from where</strong> is it derived <strong>that</strong> Nebuchadnezzar <strong>worshipped</strong> Daniel? It is derived from a verse, <strong>as it is written:</strong> <strong>“Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshipped Daniel</strong> and commanded that they should offer an offering and pleasing aromas to him” (Daniel 2:46).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nebuchadnezzar worshipped Daniel as a god. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Metzudat_David_on_Daniel.3.12.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudat David</a> on Daniel 3:12 says that Daniel didn't have to worship, because how could a god come to bow down to an idol?</p>\n<p>Now comes my question. Could it be that the statue Nebuchadnezzar made was actually the image of Daniel himself? I have not found a source to back up my claim, but I have not found anything against it either. \"The absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,\" so they say.</p>\n<p><sup>{Question courtesy of my brother.}</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Whilst this doesn't answer your question, it does displace the premise. Your question was based on the principle that Doniel did not have to worship as Nevuchadnezzar saw him as a god-like figure.</p>\n<p>However, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.7.9.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim Rabbah 7:9</a> it says explicitly that Nevuchadnezzar tried to convince him to bow down. He told Doniel to to take a look at the statue and and he would be so overawed he would bow down. Nevuchadnezzar then took the tzitz of the kohen gadol and placed it over the mouth of the statue. All the musicians were then assembled to sing praise before it, after which the image then said, \"I am Hashem your G-d\". On seeing this, Doniel asked Nevuchadnezzar if he could go and kiss it on the mouth. When Nevuchadnezzar queried why the mouth specifically, Doniel answered that it speaks well. Upon his approach, Doniel says that he is a human messenger of Hashem, and that no chilul Hashem (desecration of G-d's name) should happen. He subsequently kissed the mouth, removing the tzitz. Once again the musicians began playing, but this time there was no reaction from the image. It was swiftly overturned by the wind, prompting the other nations of the world to smash their idols and make them into bells.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It seems that acoording to the Beis Yosef Yore Dea 157 bringing proofs from the Gemora in Pesachim 53b and the Medrash, that the Graven image was not a deity rather merely a very large statue replica of kings of Bavel not unlike Mount Rushmore.</p>\n\n<p>רשאי לקדש את השם ולמסור עצמו אפילו על מצוה קלה כדי שיראו העם ליראה השם ולאהבו בכל לבם והיינו דאמרינן [פסחים נג:] מה ראו חנניה מישאל ועזריה שהפילו את עצמן לכבשן האש פי' ולא השתחוו לצלם <strong>והאי לאו עכו\"ם היתה אלא אנדרטי של מלכים לכבוד בעלמא</strong> אלא מתוך שהיו רובן טועין וסבורים שהיתה עכו\"ם היה קדוש השם במה שעשו. ואמרי' נמי במדרש מה לך יוצא ליסקל שמלתי את בני מה לך יוצא ליצלב שנטלתי את הלולב דמשמע שהיו מוסרין עצמם על קדושת השם לפנים משורת הדין דודאי לא היו מחוייבין בכך כיון שבידן להעביר ולבטלם אלא דאפ\"ה היו נהרגין מפני שהיתה השעה צריכה לכך :<br>\n Why did Chananya Mishael and Azarya refused to bow down to the statue  surely <strong>it was not a deity as indicated Pesachim 53b rather it was a statue of the Kings of Bavel (a bit like Mount Rushmore) and showing a sign of respect for the Royalty to bow down</strong> so why did they throw themselves in fire? Rather they saw that the Generation needed Chizzuk so they did more than the law to give up their lives to Sanctify G-d's name. </p>\n\n\n",

Such a prayer should fit the theme of that\n  specific blessing. For example, ask for the speedy recovery of\n  specific person within the blessing of Refa-enu (Heal us), or pray for\n  livelihood in the blessing of Barech Aleinu (G‑d grant blessing).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-12-10/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">THIS ARTICLE</a> Says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Men of the Great Assembly, in their wisdom and divine inspiration,\n  incorporated all the ideal aspirations of the Jewish people in their\n  formulation of the Amida. They meticulously chose every word until\n  arriving at the perfect wording, with which the Jewish soul can pour\n  itself out before the Creator in the most exalted manner possible\n  (above, 1:6).</p>\n  \n  <p>Even so, if one wishes to add personal requests in the middle\n  berakhot, she may. However, in the first three berakhot, which are\n  intended to praise God, and in the last three, which are intended for\n  thanksgiving, one may not add personal requests, so as not to detract\n  from their general purpose (SA 112:1; 119:1).</p>\n  \n  <p>The personal requests permitted in the middle berakhot must be related\n  to the theme of the berakha. For example, one may pray for the sick in\n  Refa’enu, for livelihood in Birkat Ha-shanim, or for relatives to make\n  aliya in the Kibbutz Galuyot. In this respect, Shomei’a Tefila is\n  unique in that one may make all types of requests in it. Since it is\n  the culmination of the petitionary berakhot, it encompasses them all.\n  When one adds personal requests, she begins by reciting the fixed\n  formulation and adds her request just before the last line of the\n  berakha.</p>\n  \n  <p>Personal requests are not only permissible but even encouraged,\n  according to many, since the personal prayers come from the depths of\n  the heart and inspire kavana. Nevertheless, it is preferable that one\n  not prolong her personal prayers excessively, not even in Shome’a\n  Tefila, because the Amida is primarily focused on collective needs,\n  and when one adds numerous personal requests, it negates the universal\n  character of the Amida. It is better that one who wishes to add more\n  personal prayers does so after finishing all the berakhot and saying\n  (the first instance of) “Yihyu le-ratzon…” since everything recited\n  after that is not fully part of the Amida. Nevertheless, since she has\n  not yet taken three steps backwards, she is still standing before the\n  Almighty in prayer, and her personal requests are joined together with\n  the main part of the Amida (SA 119:2; MB 119:12).</p>\n  \n  <p>One must express her requests in the Amida properly. Therefore, when\n  praying for the sick, the patient’s name should be mentioned.\n  Le-khatĥila, it is good to mention the patient’s name along with his\n  mother or father’s name. However, in the presence of the patient, it\n  is unnecessary to mention his name, for her intention is clear (MB\n  119:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(In this case there is also a dividing <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71489/where-is-there-a-munach-legarmei-before-a-kadma/71491#comment208874_71491\">munach legarmeh on וְשֵׁרֵ֥בְיָ֣ה ׀</a> in the middle.)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיֵשׁ֡וּעַ וּבָנִ֡י וְשֵׁרֵ֥בְיָ֣ה ׀ יָמִ֡ין עַקּ֡וּב שַׁבְּתַ֣י ׀ הֽוֹדִיָּ֡ה מַֽעֲשֵׂיָ֡ה קְלִיטָ֣א עֲזַרְיָה֩ יֽוֹזָבָ֨ד חָנָ֤ן פְּלָאיָה֙</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This isn't unusual for a verse of this length. The reason why it isn't common is because usually, lists of names are divided into multiple verses. The 13 names of 1 Chronicles 1:1-4 are spread out across four verses, so there is no division necessary beyond the tipcha of each verse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א אָדָ֥ם שֵׁ֖ת אֱנֽוֹשׁ׃ ב קֵינָ֥ן מַֽהֲלַלְאֵ֖ל יָֽרֶד׃ ג חֲנ֥וֹךְ מְתוּשֶׁ֖לַח לָֽמֶךְ׃ ד נֹ֥חַ שֵׁ֖ם חָ֥ם וָיָֽפֶת׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the verse in Nehemiah also has 13 names, but they only take up part of one verse, so more subdivisions are necessary.</p>\n\n<p>Since there are no dividers weaker than a pazer, long series of names in one verse usually end up with a series of pazer, sometimes followed by telisha gedola, azla/geresh/gershayim, and/or munach legarmeh, before the next divider (either pashta, zarka, tevir, or revi'i).</p>\n\n\n",

(Source: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Yosef</a>, Yabia Omer vol. 6 YD §14. Note: in the new ed., the above added in a gloss that <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Eliyahu_Henkin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Henkin</a> opined that pants which don't stick to the body [essentially outlining the figure] are permissible and can at times be more modest than some skirts worn to the knees.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tzinius is a subjective area of halacha, and what is considered to be modest depends on where you live, your community, and your own personal definition of modesty. </p>\n\n<p>I suggest you talk with your local rabbi (or rebbetzin) and ask what is considered modest according to your community's standards. </p>\n\n<p>This applies to men as much as it applies to women. A man might be permitted to wear shorts in one community, but if he were to move somewhere else this might be considered totally unacceptable.</p>\n\n<p>The main purpose of tzinius is to be <strong>modest</strong>, and remember the definition of this word: humble. Its purpose is to not be flashy, and also to be respectfully dressed before G-d. Make sure also to keep in mind chukas hagoy, that can be a issue for some articles of clothing. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First, you wrongly suggest, that there's a clear definition of Tzniut in the Halachah - not true.</p>\n\n<p>Tznius is all about one thing - not to attract (<s>heterosexual</s>) attention. That's done by two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>An objective covering of private parts</strong>: is about what actually can be exposed. Different communities have different views, but most Orthodox Rabbis agree that only the face, the neck, and the hands can be revealed. The actual boundaries of the exposure tend to expand in the last 100 years, but the idea holds still. You pass this test!</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>A \"subjective\" overall sex-appeal</strong>: that includes bright (esp. red-toned) colors, skinny and tight look, extremely fashionable, fancy accessories etc - anything that screams \"look at me!\". This is subjective because it depends on the surroundings - looks that are accepted in one community stand out in others.<br>\n<em>For example, many Sefardish Rabbis criticize fancy Ashkenazi wigs as being the opposite of Tzanua, because they look so nice - they look much sexier than the natural hair it is supposed to hide!</em></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You seem to pass this test also for our general society (but you wouldn't in Meah Shearim, for example!).</p>\n\n<p>NB: <em>THere are additional considerations that have no strict connection to Tzniut, such as Bechukoteihem (not to wear clothes that are distinctively goyish) or Daas Yehudis (not a clear definition of Jewish women tradition) and more.</em></p>\n\n\n",

This means that we don't derive laws from the Talmudic literature when there is a prevailing custom in the community. The source for this rule is based on the pasuk \"al titosh Torat imecha\" in Mishlei 1:8 (see Gem. Pesachim 50b also, for source regarding the ma'aseh with R' Yochanan and the people of Baishan). Therefore, a custom accepted by the majority of a community, becomes binding on the whole, even if circumstances may cause us to re-examine the minhag (ibid). </p>\n\n<p>However, there are guidelines for this rule. The minhag must be based on the ruling of a Chacham or enacted by the community on their own (and doesn't entail or cause a forbidden act) and is not forbidden outright by the Torah or Talmud. Any minhag that includes a forbidden act, or causes them, may be abandoned if enacted by the community without the ruling of a Chacham. The strength behind the rule of the minhag is to maintain the derech of Tradition and is in accordance with the spirit of halacha l'Moshe m'sinai. </p>\n\n\n",

But it comes from the Giver that desires to do good. This is what we say, that God is the ultimate good because his goodness is not set aside only to those who need it, rather, He shows mercy to somebody who is not even deserving of it.

David Kimchi</a>, in his commentary to Psalms 99:6 writes that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samuel</a> was possibly the greatest prophet after Moses, and in his commentary to\nJeremiah he states this definitively and cites several verses that could be indicative of this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Psalms 99:6</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזכר שמואל לפי שהיה ממשפחת משה ואהרן ונביא כמו הם ואפשר שהיה גדול\n  בנבואה משאר הנביאים אחר משה, וכן אמר אם יעמוד משה ושמואל לפני</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Jeremiah 15:1</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והגדול שבנביאים אחר משה רבינו היה שמואל וכן אמר משה ואהרן בכהניו\n  ושמואל בקוראי שמו ונאמר כי נאמן שמואל לנביא לה' ונאמר ולא הפיל מכל\n  דבריו ארצה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R. Kimchi's ranking is perhaps supported by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanhuma\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma</a> which refers to Samuel as \"Master/Teacher of all the prophets\":</p>\n\n<p><strong>Leviticus Chapter 21</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמואל [רבן] של כל הנביאים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Beyond this, though, are there any authoritative sources that discuss prophet rankings (the earlier the better)? Either in support of, or contravening, R. Emden's view or R. Kimchi's view?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Interestingly, R. Emden's statement has been edited out of most editions of the Talmud. The only edition I was able to find it in was the Nehardea Talmud. Below is an image showing the Nehardea edition with the statement of Elijah's rank, followed by an image showing the Oz V'hadar edition with the part about Elijah's rank missing. That many of R. Emden's Talmudic comments have been censored/edited/concealed has already been pointed out by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_J._Schacter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Jacob J. Schachter</a> in his dissertation on R. Emden:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Jacob Emden: Life and Major Works Chapter 2 Note 60</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These novellae differ from Emden's Hagahot 'al ha-Shas printed in the\n  back of the standard Vilna edition of the Talmud. Those comments\n  represent a partial transcription of Emden's marginalia on his\n  personal copy of the Talmud, presently found in the Jewish National\n  and University Library of the Hebrew Universit in Jerusalem (Heb\n  4<sup>o</sup> 181). See Y. Yoel, \"'Osef Kitvei-Yad bi-Bet Dfus Rom,\"\n  KS XIII (1937), 521-522. Even a cursory comparative study indicates\n  that not everything written by Emden in the margins of his private\n  books was included in the Vilna edition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hlONG.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hlONG.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IOLJh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IOLJh.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi (Eiruvin 5:1, 31a) states that Elijah was טירונין לנביאים. The Korban Ha-Eidah defines this as גדול שבנביאים, and cites the Aruch who explains that this means he was the authority of the prophets (ענין שררה--see also <a href=\"http://www.babynamewizard.com/baby-name/boy/tyron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). [The P'nei Moshe, however, seems to understand the word as related to \"tyro,\" i.e., a beginner.] It would seem that R. Yaakov Emden probably understood the Yerushalmi in accordance with the Korban Ha-Eidah. The Yalkut Shimoni, Melachim 209, gives a long list of parallels between Moses and Elijah, which strengthens the case for Elijah as the greatest prophet following Moses: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זהו שאמר הכתוב ובנביא העלה ה' את ישראל ממצרים ובנביא נשמר, ובנביא העלה\n  ה' זה משה, ובנביא נשמר זה אליהו ז\"ל, אתה מוצא שני נביאים עמדו לישראל\n  משבטו של לוי משה ראשון ואליהו אחרון ושניהם גואלים את ישראל בשליחות,\n  משה גאלם ממצרים ועתה לכה ואשלחך אל פרעה, ואליהו לעתיד לבא הנה אנכי\n  שולח לכם את אליה הנביא, משה גאלם ממצרים תחלה עוד לא חזרו ונשתעבדו\n  במצרים ואליהו כשיגאל אותם מן הרביעית עוד אינם חוזרים ומשתעבדים אלא\n  תשועת עולמים, ואתה מוצא שמשה ואליהו שוים זה לזה לכל דבר משה נביא\n  ואליהו נביא, משה נקרא איש האלהים ואליהו נקרא איש האלהים, משה עלה למעלה\n  ואליהו עלה למעלה שנאמר ויהי בהעלות ה' את אליהו, משה הרג את המצרי\n  ואליהו הרג את חיאל שנאמר ויאשם בבעל וימת, משה נתכלכל על ידי אשה שנאמר\n  קראן לו ויאכל לחם ואליהו נתכלכל על ידי הצרפית שנאמר לקחי נא לי פת לחם\n  משה ברח מפני פרעה ואליהו ברח מפני איזבל, משה ברח ובא לבאר ואליהו ברח\n  ובא לבאר שנאמר ויבא באר שבע, משה אמר אם כמות כל אדם ימותון אלה ואליהו\n  חי ה' וגו' אם יהיה וגו' טל ומטר, במשה ויעבר ה' על פניו ובאליהו והנה ה'\n  עובר, במשה וישמע את הקול ובאליהו והנה אליו קול, משה כנס את ישראל לפני\n  הר סיני ואליהו כנסם להר הכרמל. משה בער עובדי ע\"ז שנאמר שימו איש חרבו\n  על ירכו ואליהו בער עובדי ע\"ז ותפש נביאי הבעל ושחטם, משה קנא מי לה' אלי\n  ואליהו קנא שנאמר ויאמר אליהו לכל העם גשו נא אלי, משה נטמן במערה שנאמר\n  ושמתיך בנקרת הצור ואליהו נטמן במערה שנאמר ויבא שם אל המערה וילן שם.\n  משה ויבא אל הר האלהים, ואליהו (ויבא) [וילך] וגו' עד הר האלהים, משה בא\n  למדבר ואליהו בא למדבר מדברה דמשק, משה השיח עמו על ידי מלאך שנאמר וירא\n  מלאך ה' אליו ואליהו והנה זה מלאך, משה ארבעים יום וארבעים לילה לא אכל\n  ואליהו וילך בכח האכילה ההיא ארבעים יום, משה התפלל על ישראל שנאמר אל\n  תשחת עמך ואליהו התפלל שנאמר ענני ה' ענני, משה תפש זכות אבות שנאמר זכור\n  לאברהם ואליהו שתים עשרה מצבה לאמר ישראל יהיה שמך, משה קבלו ישראל על\n  ידו אהבתו של מקום שנאמר כל אשר דבר ה' נעשה ונשמע ואליהו קבלו על ידו\n  ואמרו ה' הוא האלהים, משה עשה משכן כבית סאתים זרע וכן אליהו, משה כשבנה\n  את המזבח בנה אותו י\"ב אבנים למספר בני ישראל וכן אליהו ויקח אליהו שתים\n  עשרה אבנים וגו'. חי ה' וגו' אשר עמדתי לפניו, ר' ברכיה בר' חלבו בשם ר'\n  שמואל בר רב יצחק וכי לפני שכינה הוא עומד אלא כל זמן שהיה עומד לפני\n  אחיה השילוני כאלו עומד לפני השכינה. אם יהיה טל ומטר י' רעבון וכו'\n  (כתוב ברמז קנ\"ד):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To summarize your two part quest, \"Is there anything to indicate that he (meaning Eliyahu) was actually the greatest prophet after Moses? Whence did R. Emden know this?\"</p>\n<p>As you say, Moshe is the greatest of the prophets (אדון כל הנביאים) like is stated in Sefer Tzeidah l'Derech at the end in the laws relating to redemption and Moshiach.</p>\n<p>Considering that Rabbi Emden was an expert in both the revealed parts of Torah and the concealed parts of Torah, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine that he was familiar with <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Product.aspx?ProductID=10278&strReferer=search&PPGR=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Brit Menucha by Rabbi Avraham of Rimon</a> and which is attributed to Rav Chamaui Gaon.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44425&st=&pgnum=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In the beginning of that book</a>, he explains a concept found in Isaiah 43:7 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל הנקרא בשמי גו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>saying that all prophecy comes to us via/through these three angels represented by the word <em>Shemi</em>. שמ״י which stands for the names of the angels assigned as agents for prophecy.</p>\n<p>Those three angels manifest in this world as Moshe Rabbeinu (<strong>מ</strong>טטרון <strong>ש</strong>ר <strong>ה</strong>פנים מש״ה), Eliyahu HaNavi (יהואל, אליה״ו) and Shmuel HaNavi (שמועאל, שמוא״ל).</p>\n<p>In the order of the Rosh Teivot found in Isaiah, it places Moshe Rabbeinu in the center being escorted by both Shmuel and Elihau. And this is in keeping with the principle found in Brachot 43b that a Talmid Chacham (like Moshe Rabbeinu) should be escorted by two disciples (like Shmuel HaNavi and Eliyahu HaNavi) when traveling.</p>\n<p>In the context of the discussion in Brit Menucha, it corresponds to the general arrangement called <em>the three pillars</em> of Chesed, Gevurah and Tiferet, which also correspond to the three Avot, Avraham (Chesed), Yitzchok (Gevurah) and Yaacov (Tiferet). Tiferet, which is the intermediate connecting link between the two extremes, comprises them both and is the greatest of the three. Chesed and Gevurah are escorts, so to speak to Tiferet, and are equal but opposite to each other.</p>\n<p>Eliyahu is generally associated with Gevurah, which would mean that Shmuel corresponds to Chesed, which is also called <em>Gedolah</em>.</p>\n<p>So linguistically Rabbi Emden would seem to be referring to Eliyahu in the context of being a <em>Gibbor</em>, one who overcomes and overturns his opponent. And that appears to be his explanation in the first of the photographed images in your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It is interesting that we hardly have any nevuos from Eliyahu Hanavi, if he recieved the greatest clarity of nevu'ah after Moshe one would hope to hear more of it!  Shmuel Hanavi unplugged the blockage to nevu'ah in his day and had schools of benei hanevi'im, and re-established the Jewish people's connection to ruach hakodesh. Perhaps in this sense he was the 'avi hanevi'im'. In terms of clarity of nevu'ah, we have this statement in the Talmud Yerushalmi perek 10 about Yeshayahu Hanavi: אֶלָּא שֶׁהָרַג אֶת יְשַׁעְיָהוּ שֶׁהָיָה שָׁקוּל כְּמֹשֶׁה. דִּכְתִיב בֵּיהּ פֶּה אֶל־פֶּה אֲדַבֶּר־בּוֹ. - Yeshaya saw the maaseh hamerkavah and left us so many important nevu'os.  He was the proverbial 'ben bayit' of Hashem.  Perhaps we can say that Yeshayahu was the 'loftiest' of the nevi'im??</p>\n\n\n",

We already discussed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/29957/501\">Plants growing out of the Kotel</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/29966/501\">the accepted answer</a> states that they should not be picked because [leaving them lying around] adds to the feeling of despair.</p>\n\n<p>That would actually point to not moving the stone, but I assume it was moved for safety reasons, and to prevent tourists from picking off chips for souvenirs.</p>\n\n<p>Now that it's been moved, <strong>would it have any Halachic special status</strong>? </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It was part of the Western retaining wall of the Temple Mount, and not actually part of the Bet HaMikdash as such.</li>\n<li>OTOH, we do treat the Kotel as if it has a special holiness, so maybe from a Minhag aspect, (if it's not a Din) it should have some special status.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But I can't find any specific related Halachot. Sources welcome!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/general/1562935/the-fallen-kosel-stone-a-halachic-analysis.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This article</a> quotes Rav Yitzchak Herzog (Heichal Yitzchak OC 18). I do not have access to this source to confirm the accuracy of the following discussion, so take this with a grain of salt until it can be confirmed. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Meiri (Kiryas Sefer, Hil. Beis HaBechirah, ch. 5) writes that the entire Har HaBayis has Kedushah. Since the Rambam (Hil. Karban Pesach 9:1) writes (regarding the walls of the house in which a Chaburah eats their Pesach) that the walls are considered a part of the space within them, the author of the article argues that the retaining wall of the Har HaBayis (of which the Kosel is a part) should similarly be part of the Har HaBayis.</li>\n<li>The problem is that a large part of the Kosel was added by Moses Montefiore in the 19th Century. This was long after the use of the Har HaBayis, and therefore, those stones are not endowed with the same Kedushah as the ones placed when the Har HaBayis was actually in use. </li>\n<li>R’ Moshe Feinstein (YD 4:63) holds that there is a prohibition of not only Me’ilah (making personal use of property of the Beis HaMikdash) but also “Lo Sa’asun Kein LaHashem Elokeichem” (we are enjoined to destroy idols and all objects that are associated with their worship, and we are further enjoined not to do so unto Hashem). </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All of this only helps when the stone is on the wall, though. What about when the stone has already fallen off? This seems to be a machlokes Achronim. (I am not clear if this part of the article is still quoting Rav Herzog or not.)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Magen Avraham (OC 152:6) quotes the Maharam Padua (§65) that the prohibition of taking a stone of the shul (or, apparently, any holy place) is only when it is connected to the ground. The Machatzis HaShekel (no source provided) explains that this is because just like the commandment to destroy idolatrous alters is only when they are connected to the ground, so, too, the prohibition against doing so to holy objects is only when they are connected to the ground. According to these views, it would be permissible to make use of this stone. </li>\n<li>On the other hand, the Chasam Sofer (in his responsa, OC 32) says that the Magen Avraham’s words are astonishing, as they seem to contradict the Gemara (Makkos 22a) which states that one who uses wood from the Mikdash to cook is in violation of Lo Sa’asun Kein - but nobody cooks with wood that’s still attached! Rather, he says, the Maharam Padua must have been referring to vessels inside the Shul rather than a part of the Shul itself. It’s clear from this Chasam Sofer that his opinion was that even when it’s disconnected from the ground it’s still forbidden. (The article doesn’t attempt to defend the Maharam Padua.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

What do the mfarshim say about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>One of the easiest interpretations to grasp, is that it follows the nature of Bereshis 1:5:</p>\n\n<p>First night, lying down - then day, getting up. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים ׀ לָאוֹר֙ י֔וֹם וְלַחֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה וַֽיְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽיְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד׃ (פ)\n  God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, a first day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 2a</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Also, this pasuk was written in this style to serve as a source (and hint?) to why we daven maariv first at night and then shacharis in the morning. It follows the order of the pasuk. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובשכבך ובקומך. מאימתי קורין... וגם סידר של ערבית תחלה על סדר הכתוב\n  בשכבך  ובקומך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Temimah_on_Torah,_Deuteronomy.6.7.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תורה תמימה</a>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Going to sleep is mentioned before waking up because of causal priority.<sup>1</sup></p>\n\n<p>Because life begins in a state of awakeness, the concept of \"waking up from sleep\" does not exist without there first being a concept of \"going to sleep\". The reverse, however, is not true. The concept of \"going to sleep\" could exist without there being a concept of \"waking up from sleep\".</p>\n\n<p>Because \"going to sleep\" is a fundamental prerequisite for \"waking up from sleep\" it is mentioned first.</p>\n\n<p>(No, I do not have a source for this – למה לי קרא סברא היא)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. It is not because of chronological priority (i.e. that night comes before day) because then we would have trouble making sense of a Talmudic passage. The Talmud (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 2a</a>) asks why the Mishnah discusses the Nighttime Shema before discussing the Daytime Shema. The Talmud first answers that the Mishnah was following the order of the verse where ובשכבך comes before ובקומיך. The Talmud then says that alternatively, the Mishnah was following the order of creation, where night occurred before day. If the reason for the order in the verse itself is that night comes before day, then there is no alternative answer. Both answers are saying the same thing, viz, that the Mishnah first discussed the Nighttime Shema because night comes before day.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

And Achan answered Joshua, and said: 'Of a truth I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel.'\" And from where [do we know] that his confession atoned for him? As it says, (Joshua 7:25), \"And Joshua said: 'Why hast thou troubled us? the Lord shall trouble thee this day,'\" today you are troubled, but you are not troubled in the World to Come. And if he does not know how to confess, they say to him: \"Say, 'May my death serve as an atonement for all my iniquities.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from here that even though he is being led out to be killed, he still must do Teshuvah on top of that.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Yoma 8:9:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עֲבֵרוֹת שֶׁבֵּין אָדָם לַמָּקוֹם, יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים מְכַפֵּר. עֲבֵרוֹת שֶׁבֵּין אָדָם לַחֲבֵרוֹ, אֵין יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים מְכַפֵּר, עַד שֶׁיְּרַצֶּה אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ. אֶת זוֹ דָּרַשׁ רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה, מִכֹּל חַטֹּאתֵיכֶם לִפְנֵי יְיָ תִּטְהָרוּ (ויקרא טז), עֲבֵרוֹת שֶׁבֵּין אָדָם לַמָּקוֹם, יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים מְכַפֵּר. עֲבֵרוֹת שֶׁבֵּין אָדָם לַחֲבֵרוֹ, אֵין יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים מְכַפֵּר, עַד שֶׁיְּרַצֶּה אֶת חֲבֵרוֹ.</p>\n<p>Yom Kippur atones for transgressions between a person and God, but for a transgression against one's neighbor, Yom Kipur cannot atone, until he appeases his neighbor.

And likewise, one who wounds his friend and one who damages his money, even though he pays him that which he owes him, he is not atoned for until he does Vidui and returns from doing like this again, as it says (Bamidbar 5:6 [in the context of Vidui]): “from all the sins of man.” [Regardless of the sin, he must do Vidui.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Likewise IBN Ezra (and many others) explain it as \"to swear by His name and not in the name of any other gods\" (compare, “every tongue shall swear” [Isaiah 45: 23]). In other words, you shall not swear in the name of any god, other than G-d alone. But you may swear to affirm testimony, or to confirm a contract — so long as it is true. Do not follow other gods since you may not swear in their name. </p>\n\n<p>But how should I understand this command as it seems to imply that one has to do something.

His opinion concurs with my thinking. Once you have davened Ma'ariv - and it doesn't matter if it is during a weekday or Shabbat - this is your \"acceptance\" of the start of the new day.</p>\n\n<p>He alluded to some halacha (I believe this is mentioned in O.C.) that states that the <em>tzibbur</em> is allowed to start Ma'ariv immediately after a <em>plag</em> Mincha but still before <em>tzeit</em> if there will be no way to get a minyan for Ma'ariv later.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, using this idea, the rav was extrapolating a \"practical\" instance for our shul. We have many elderly members who can't wait for <em>tzet</em> during the summer to daven Ma'ariv. Many of them come to minyan specifically so that they can say Kaddish. (I've already discussed this \"Conservative\" phenomenon in a few M.Y. questions.) Thus, the rav has definitely allowed them to say Kaddish at a pre-tzet minyan even if the <em>yahrtzeit</em> date is the next date. Again, his opinion is that the recital of Ma'ariv is one's acknowledgement of the new date, at least in terms of saying Kaddish.</p>\n\n<p>My supplemental thinking on this - the recitation of Kaddish for <em>yahrtzeit</em> I think is a minhag. It certainly seems to have less halachic \"status\" then Kaddish for a Yatom (mourner.) So, there's probably room for a lot of leniency, here.</p>\n\n\n",

The departed stays there for <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/hashoneh-halachos/tues_03_13_12/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">no more than one year</a> before moving on to Heaven, which is why our custom is to say Kaddish Yatom, the mourners' prayer, for a maximum of only eleven months -- lest we give the impression that the person was so wicked as to require the full twelve months.  I don't know a lot about Christian afterlife ideas, but our Gehinnon is probably closer to your Purgatory.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism doesn't condemn souls to eternal damnation and torment.  Judaism recognizes that <em>teshuva</em>, repentance, is possible and that divine punishment is not permanent.  No external force is required to \"save\" a soul; we are each responsible for our own salvation, by clinging to God and doing as He commands.  If we messed up in life (as we all do), we can still recover.  (So what's Kaddish Yatom about?  It's more about asking for leniency than \"saving\" the person.

Teshuvah 3 and 8, and regarding the afterlife for non-Jews is in Hil. Melachim 8:11. To summarize the more pertinent points, the afterlife is not one size fits all. For Jews, one who sins goes to Gehinnom for some amount of time and then goes to Heaven, but it depends on his good deeds in this world what level of Heaven he gets. However, one who does one of 24 specific sins loses his entire afterlife and ceases to exist upon his death.

The 20th seems to have evolved into a slightly <a href=\"http://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2508069/jewish/Shabbos-Parshas-Eikev-Chof-Menachem-Av-5747-1987.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">more</a> significant date because of the <a href=\"http://wikisicha.org/tiki-index.php?page=Vol%204.16%20-%20Chof%20Av\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nature</a> of this particular donation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There were nine days in the year when wood was donated to the Beis HaMikdash, yet the donation of the 20th of Av showed a greater measure of ahavas Yisrael and Jewish unity than the other days. The reason for this: The Gemara relates that after the 15th of Av, the rays of the summer sun are weaker and no new trees were felled to be used for the altar as they would not be dry enough. (Taanis 31a)</p>\n  \n  <p>According to this, the family which donated wood on the 20th of Av had to take the wood from their existing stock of fire-wood — they gave away their own wood for they could not hew any new wood for the altar. They donated their wood so that other Jews, poor Jews, even past sinners (Heaven forefend) would be able to offer their sacrifices on the altar. Furthermore, it was done in a joyous manner, since they set the day as a holiday. How great was their ahavas Yisrael!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If there is some important object lesson here and the day was one of (at least family/local) celebration, is there any change in davening or in practice? To a lesser degree, is there anyone who can trace himself to this family who then has a tradition of a particular celebration or such in commemoration?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why were there so many Karbanos Eitzim in Av, and so few during the rest of the year?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Taanis 4:4 introduces the concept of Karbanos Eitzim. The Gemara (28a) explains what was so special about these days:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר למה הוצרכו לומר זמן עצי כהנים והעם אמרו כשעלו בני הגולה לא מצאו עצים בלשכה ועמדו אלו והתנדבו משלהם</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages taught: Why was it necessary to state the times for the wood offering of priests and the people? They said: When the people of the exile ascended [to Jerusalem in the beginning of the Second Temple period], they did not find enough wood in the Temple chamber [for the needs of the altar]. And these families arose and donated from their own [wood to the Temple].</p>\n  \n  <p>וכך התנו נביאים שביניהן שאפי' לשכה מלאה עצים יהיו אלו מתנדבין משלהן שנאמר (נחמיה י, לה) והגורלות הפלנו על קרבן העצים הכהנים הלוים והעם להביא לבית אלהינו לבית אבותינו לעתים מזומנים שנה בשנה לבער על מזבח ה' אלהינו ככתוב בתורה:</p>\n  \n  <p>And the prophets among them stipulated as follows, that even if the entire chamber were full of wood, these families would donate from their own property [on these specific days], as it is stated: “And we cast lots, the priests, the Levites and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, according to our fathers’ houses, at appointed times year by year, to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the Torah” (Nehemiah 10:35).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So these days were days on which people had donated wood previously. Now, when were these days? Taanis 4:5 tells us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זְמַן עֲצֵי כֹהֲנִים וְהָעָם, תִּשְׁעָה. בְּאֶחָד בְּנִיסָן, בְּנֵי אָרַח בֶּן יְהוּדָה. בְּעֶשְׂרִים בְּתַמּוּז, בְּנֵי דָוִד בֶּן יְהוּדָה. בַּחֲמִשָּׁה בְאָב, בְּנֵי פַרְעֹשׁ בֶּן יְהוּדָה. בְּשִׁבְעָה בוֹ, בְּנֵי יוֹנָדָב בֶּן רֵכָב. בַּעֲשָׂרָה בוֹ, בְּנֵי סְנָאָה בֶן בִּנְיָמִין. בַּחֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר בּוֹ, בְּנֵי זַתּוּא בֶן יְהוּדָה, וְעִמָּהֶם כֹּהֲנִים וּלְוִיִּם וְכָל מִי שֶׁטָּעָה בְשִׁבְטוֹ, וּבְנֵי גוֹנְבֵי עֱלִי בְּנֵי קוֹצְעֵי קְצִיעוֹת. בְּעֶשְׂרִים בּוֹ, בְּנֵי פַחַת מוֹאָב בֶּן יְהוּדָה. בְּעֶשְׂרִים בֶּאֱלוּל, בְּנֵי עָדִין בֶּן יְהוּדָה. בְּאֶחָד בְּטֵבֵת שָׁבוּ בְנֵי פַרְעֹשׁ שְׁנִיָּה.</p>\n  \n  <p>The times [of the delivery] of wood [for the altar] by priests and people, were on nine appointed days; on the 1st of Nissan, the family Arah ben Jehudah [delivered]; on the 20th of Tamuz, the family of David ben Jehudah; on the 5th of Ab, the family of Parhos ben Jehudah; on the 7th, the family of Jonadab ben Rechab; on the 10th, the family of Sinha ben Benjamin; on the 15th, the family of Zatoo ben Jehudah, and with them priests and Levites, and all those who did not know from what tribe [they were descended], also the family of Gonebé Eli, and that of Kosehai Kesignot; and on the 20th, the family Pachat Moab ben Jehudah; on the 20th of Elul, the family Adeen ben Jehudah; on the 1st of Tebet, the family Parhos, for the second time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So there were nine days on which wood was donated. <em>Five</em> of them were in the month of Av, following a sixth on the 20th of Tammuz. The other ten months of the year have to make do with just three donations. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why are these dates so bunched together?</strong> If people donated when they ran out, why did some families donate so little as to leave the Beis HaMikdash with as little as <em>two days’ worth</em> of wood in some cases? And if people donated when they so chose, not necessarily when the Beis HaMikdash ran out, then why did they decide to bring on these days and not on others?</p>\n\n<p>I should highlight the donation of Adeen Ben Yehudah. They donated on the 20th of Elul, and the following donation wasn’t until Rosh Chodesh Teves. If they donated when they needed, then they not only donated nearly 100 days worth, but that period overlaps Rosh HaShanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkos, plus several Roshei Chadashim, making this the period with the most Karbanos of any of these donations. Compare that to Parhos Ben Yehudah, who brought two days’ worth; no wonder they went back and donated a second time to cover Teves through Adar. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's more practical to give dry wood and by the season of Av, which is 4 months after the end of the rainy season which ends in Nissan (Taanis 2b), the wood is more effectively burnt as it is very dry.</p>\n\n<p>This is from Wikipedia info about wood cutting:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The moisture content of firewood determines how it burns and how much heat is released. Unseasoned (green) wood moisture content varies by the species; green wood may weigh 70 to 100 percent more than seasoned wood due to water content. Typically, seasoned (dry) wood has 20% to 25% moisture content. Unseasoned wood with 65% moisture contains less usable energy than when it has been dried to 20%. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The voice said to him: As the measurements of the dimensions of the outer cave where Abraham is buried, so are the measurements of the dimensions of the inner cave, where Adam is buried. The Gemara notes: And according to the one who says that the Cave of Machpelah consists of two chambers, this one above that one, not two adjacent chambers, the voice said: As the measurements of the dimensions of the upper cave where Abraham is buried, so are the measurements of the dimensions of the lower cave. Therefore, there is no need to measure it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Does this imply that G-d has a physical image?</p>\n\n<p>Note: I <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">saw</a> this listed as a source for Rashi on Genesis 1:27.</p>\n\n<p>See also: Rosh Hashanah 24b (and the parallel in Meseches Avodah Zorah)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Depending on what you mean by \"imply\", yes, the Talmudic passage does imply that God has a physical form/image.</p>\n\n<p>The simple reading of the passage is that God has an image/form. If not for the fact that there is a philosophical/theological issue with a corporeal God we would not reinterpret the passage.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>, the greatest champion of incorporeality, admits that there are verses which at face value seem to be describing God in a corporeal manner, and goes so far as to say that it is harder to reinterpret those verses towards incorporeality than to reinterpret the verses in Genesis towards an eternal (non-created) universe:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 2:25</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>WE do not reject the Eternity of the Universe, because certain\n  passages in Scripture confirm the Creation; for such passages are not\n  more numerous than those in which God is represented as a corporeal\n  being; nor is it impossible or difficult to find for them a suitable\n  interpretation. We might have explained them in the same manner as we\n  did in respect to the Incorporeality of God. We should perhaps have\n  had an easier task in showing that the Scriptural passages referred to\n  are in harmony with the theory of the Eternity of the Universe if we\n  accepted the latter, than we had in explaining the anthropomorphisms\n  in the Bible when we rejected the idea that God is corporeal. For two\n  reasons, however, we have not done so, and have not accepted the\n  Eternity of the Universe. First, the Incorporeality of God has been\n  demonstrated by proof: those passages in the Bible, which in their\n  literal sense contain statements that can be refuted by proof, must\n  and can be interpreted otherwise. But the Eternity of the Universe has\n  not been proved; a mere argument in favour of a certain theory is not\n  sufficient reason for rejecting the literal meaning of a Biblical\n  text, and explaining it figuratively, when the opposite theory can be\n  supported by an equally good argument. (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp112.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_David\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ra'avad</a> explicitly states that many individuals greater than Rambam believed in (some form of) corporeality based on the verses and <strong>aggadot which misled them</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=410\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuvah 3:7</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולמה קרא לזה מין וכמה גדולים וטובים ממנו הלכו בזו המחשבה לפי מה שראו\n  במקראות ויותר ממה שראו בדברי האגדות המשבשות את הדעות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This Talmudic passage would be a prime example of one of the aggadot that could mislead someone into believing in corporeality.</p>\n\n<p>This is all assuming that \"imply\" just meant \"what is the simple meaning of the passage?\", and therefore we could say that even though corporeality is incorrect it is still implied by the Talmud. However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani_the_Younger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaiah of Trani (The Younger)</a> goes a step further and argues that some of the Talmudic Sages actually did believe in corporeality.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Riaz Kuntres Harayos Sanhedrin 90a</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכמה היו מחכמי התלמוד הקדושים שמהם תצא תורה לישראל שלא נתנו לבם\n  להתבונן בענין האלהות אלא הבינו המקראות כפשוטם ולפי תומם חשבו כי הקדוש\n  ברוך הוא בעל גוף ותמונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In that sense, then, we can say that this Talmudic passage fully implies corporeality – it's not just a mistaken conclusion that can be derived from the passage but it might actually be what the Talmudic author meant.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, it doesn't mean that it is true. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a> wrote about something else, we do not determine our theology based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggadah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">aggadot</a>:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Meiri Shabbat 55a:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין עיקרי האמונות תלויות בראיות של פשוטי מקראות ואגדות וכבר ידעת שאין\n  משיבין באגדה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>G-d cannot possibly have \"physical image\" (I don't know what you mean by physical, though) (based on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam's Yesodey Hatora Ch.1</a>):. The idea of an image comes from our human inability to grasp infinity, but only limited details of it. As G-d does not \"consist of details\" but is one, we can not possibly comprehend it.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Explaining the Gemmora:</strong> Knowing G-d can be done in many ways. We're familiar with hearing or reading his word, but there are other, non-verbal means, for example as seeing Him or His image. That's why Moses said, \"הראני נא את כבודך\" (Shm. 33,18). Seriously, after knowing all the Torah (supposedly) what did Moses lack? He knew that by seeing G-d's \"image\" he could achieve levels of understanding impossible by learning (see Meforshim in place).</p></li>\n<li><p>If you remember G-d's answer to Moses, He didn't agree to show His \"fuller image\" but only a fraction \"אחורי\") explaining that a human cannot withstand such experience (similarly Midrashic sources say Hevel \"הציץ בשכינה\" and had to die and the two sons of Aharon). </p></li>\n<li><p>As Adam was created in G-d's image far more than every one of us (\"ואם ראשונים בני אנשים - אנו כחמורים\" Shabbos 112b), seeing him could simply damage R' Bnaa (as with Moses), or alternatively, sentence him to death and the Echo tried to warn him about that.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

In fact, if I understand what they are proposing, then the days that would be Saturdays under our current calendar will move around from year to year and maybe from week to week.</p>\n\n<p>Although I doubt such a reform would ever be adopted, I'm curious what we would do halachically if it were. Would we change the date of Shabbos so that it still always fell on the date that was designated Saturday in the calendar, or would we have to figure out a way to keep Shabbos on the date that would be Shabbos in the current system? (The former might be impossible, because the Invariable Calendar adds a day once a year that has no day of the week. So, if we switched Shabbos to every Saturday in the new system, then at least once a year there would be 8 days between Shabboses.)</p>\n\n<p>The answer to this question depends, I know, on how one rules on this question: [<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/60256/history-of-shabbat-how-or-did-they-count-to-align-with-7th-day-of-creation]\">History of Shabbat: how (or) did they count to align with 7th day of creation?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>While the Jewish holidays are controlled by the Sanhedrin (though, notably, they are not controlled by non-Jewish governments, and even the Sanhedrin's control is bound by divinely received rules), Sabbath is different in that it always repeats every seventh day, regardless of any calendar.  This is one reason given why, in the central prayer of Sabbath/festival/new moons <em>shemoneh esrei</em>, Sabbath is mentioned as directly sanctified by G-d (מקדש השבת), whereas the sanctity of the festivals/new moons is described as corollary to the sanctification of Israel (מקדש ישראל והזמנים).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תני תנא קמיה דרבינא מקדש ישראל והשבת והזמנים אמר ליה אטו שבת ישראל מקדשי ליה והא שבת מקדשא וקיימא אלא אימא מקדש השבת ישראל והזמנים אמר רב יוסף הלכה כרבי וכדתריץ רבינא:</p>\n<p>A tanna taught a baraita before Ravina with a slightly different reading: He concludes the blessing with: Who sanctifies the Jewish people, Shabbat, and the seasons. Ravina said to that tanna: Is that to say that the Jewish people sanctify Shabbat? Isn’t Shabbat already sanctified from the six days of Creation? Every seventh day is automatically Shabbat, without the need for any declaration on the part of the Jewish people. Rather, amend it and say as follows: Who sanctifies Shabbat, the Jewish people, and the seasons, as the Jewish people indeed sanctify the New Moon and the Festival days. Rav Yosef said: The halakha with regard to the conclusion of the blessing is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi and as the difficulty was resolved by Ravina.

If he shaved or bandits\nshaved him it voids the thirty days. A nazir who shaved, whether with\nscissors, with a razor, or if he trimmed at all, is liable. A nazir\ncan rub and trim but not comb. Rabbi Yishmael says: \"He should not rub\nwith earth, since it tears out the hair.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Suppose a Nazir does an action that indirectly causes his hair to be removed (for example, he undergoes chemotherapy and his hair falls out).

The verse uses an active verb, \"yaavor\". But, issur or not, if the result is a loss of the majority of hairs, the nezirut's count is cancelled for 30 days. Rabbi Shimon Ben Yehouda un name of Rabbi Shimon is machmir for the loss of 2 hairs only. </p>\n\n<p><code>the Mishnah seems to say that both Oneis (unavoidable action) and ...are forbidden.</code></p>\n\n<p>Not forbidden for the mitgaleach, by oness he only needs to count again 30 days to reach a situation of \"gadel pera\".</p>\n\n<p><code>Psik Reisha (guaranteed outcome) are forbidden.</code></p>\n\n<p>Psik resha here is an active doing, with entire consciousness, but not entirely intentional.</p>\n\n<p><code>davar sheeyno mitcaven</code> </p>\n\n<p>This is a range below psik resha but is also a full action. </p>\n\n<p><code>would make this case not a violation of Nezirus?</code></p>\n\n<p>I don't see any similar case in Gemara.

Also, in a Miqra Gedolah (a rabbinic Bible) there was a gloss which said, “Our Sages’ [text], ‘them,’ needs to be thought about carefully.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n<p>Based on similar questions <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/45592/16354\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/62498/16354\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/84351/what-is-the-status-of-koheles-and-shir-hashirim-in-the-bathroom\">here</a>, would learning this Chizkuni (or any other Peirushim based on alternate readings of the Torah) be considered Talmud Torah in terms of learning it in the bathroom, etc. etc.?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Proof text in Rosh Hashanah for month of mating season\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in Rosh Hashanah on 11a says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' יהושע אומר מנין שבניסן נברא העולם שנא' (בראשית א, יב) ותוצא הארץ\n  דשא עשב מזריע זרע ועץ עושה פרי איזהו חדש שהארץ מליאה דשאים ואילן מוציא\n  פירות הוי אומר זה ניסן ואותו הפרק זמן בהמה וחיה ועוף שמזדווגין זה אצל\n  זה שנאמר (תהלים סה, יד) לבשו כרים הצאן וגו'</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yehoshua says: From where is it derived that the world was\n  created in the month of Nisan? As it is stated: “And the earth brought\n  forth grass, herb yielding seed after its kind, and tree yielding\n  fruit” (Genesis 1:12). Which is the month in which the earth is full\n  of grass and the trees begin to bring forth fruit? You must say that\n  this is Nissan. And further proof that the world was created in Nissan\n  is that when the world was first created, the animals had to breed in\n  order to fill the world, and the period beginning with Nisan is a time\n  when cattle, and beasts, and birds mate with one another, as it is\n  stated: “The flocks are clothed in the meadows, and the valleys are\n  wrapped in grain; they shout for joy, they also sing” (Psalms 65:14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet earlier in Rosh Hashanah (8a) the Gemara establishes that this text demonstrates that animals primarily mate in Adar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא אמר רבא דכ\"ע לבשו כרים הצאן בזמן שעמקים יעטפו בר באדר </p>\n  \n  <p>Rather, Rava said that the dispute must be explained as follows:\n  Everyone is of the opinion that “the flocks are clothed in the\n  meadows,” i.e., the sheep conceive, primarily at the time when “the\n  valleys are wrapped in grain,” in the month of Adar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's important to note that the Gemara on 8a seems to assume a significant difference between Adar and Nissan. We see this from a machloket there about whether R\"H for ma'aser beheima is in Elul or Tishrei. This is based on an argument from this passuk about whether or not the animals primarily mate in Adar or Nissan. Thus it appears that Adar and Nissan are different enough in terms of when the mating period is. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, my question is how can our Gemara use this passuk as a proof for R' Yehoshua that creation happened in Nissan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A potential answer is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>R. Yehoshua is not adducing a formal proof when he quotes the verse לבשו כרים הצאן. It is simply an additional support. He is saying that I said that creation was in Nissan and you said that creation was in Tishrei, and it makes more sense for it to have been in Nissan because Nissan is around the mating time and Tishrei is not. </p>\n\n<p>This does not mean that he is saying that Nissan is the exact and only time that animals mate. Indeed, he doesn't even say that Nissan is the <em>month</em> (חודש) of mating (as he does with his first proof); he says it is the <em>time</em> (פרק) of mating, which means it is around the time of mating. If the time of mating was three months long (Adar-Sivan) this would still be correct, and it would be evidence that Nissan is more likely than Tishrei to have been the month of creation.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed, when we look back at the passage on 8a, we find that it does not say that <em>only</em> Adar is the time of conceiving. The Talmud first presents it as a dispute amongst tannaim whether the majority conceive in Adar with a minority in Nissan, or the majority conceive in Nissan with a minority in Adar. Even if the passage on 11a accepts Rava's conclusion from 8a that everyone agrees that most animals conceive in Adar, there is still the minority of animals that conceive in Nissan.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, if we know that some animals conceive in Nissan, and the rest of them conceive in Adar which is the same \"time period\" as Nissan, it is fair to assume that the world was created in Nissan over Tishrei, because that would allow the animals to mate. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I subsequently found that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Strashun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Shmuel Strashun</a> also raises this question, and answers similarly that the Talmud on 8a grants that <em>some</em> animals mate in Nissan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Hagahot V'Chidushei HaRashash, Rosh Hashanah 11a</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואע\"ג דמסקינן לעיל (ח) דלכ\"ע לבשו כו' בזמן דעמקים כו' דהיינו באדר מ\"מ\n  כיון דאותן שלא לבשו באדר מתלבשות בניסן כדאמר שם ואיכא נמי כו' שפיר הוי\n  זמן זיוג להנבראים עתה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Capital Punishment and Kares simultaneously\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always understood that if a person does something that warrants capital punishment, and there are witnesses who warned them against the crime, that's all they are punished with. If it was done intentionally but without witnesses or a warning, for certain crimes they get punished instead with <em>kares</em>. But I wouldn't think that the person who is getting the capital punishment <strong>also</strong> gets <em>kares</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in Sefer HaMitzvos in a few places sounds like this. For example, at the end of Mitzvah Lo Sa'aseh <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments.336.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#336</a> he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה התבאר מכל מה שקדם שהעובר על לאו בתו ובת בנו ובת בתו הוא בשריפה, <strong>ואם לא נחקרה העדות בכרת אם היה מזיד</strong>, ואם היה שוגג באחת מהן יקריב חטאת קבועה</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold, from all the above it has been explained on the prohibition of a person with their daughter, son's daughter, or daughter's daughter that the punishment is death by fire. <strong>If there wasn't sufficient testimony then the person gets kares if it was intentional</strong>, and if it was unintentional they bring a chatas offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, in the next mitzvah, #337, he writes differently:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייב שריפה אם נחקרה העדות, <strong>הוא בכרת גם כן</strong> אם היה מזיד. ואם היה שוגג יקריב חטאת קבועה</p>\n  \n  <p>They're punished with death by fire if there were witnesses. If they were intentional <strong>they also get kares</strong>, and if unintentional they bring a chatas offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Am I misunderstanding the Rambam? Was my whole premise mistaken?</p>\n\n<p>The above quote from #337 is from the Frankel Edition. However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments.337?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the version on Sefaria</a> (which they say is the Warsaw 1883 edition) reads differently, in a way that there's no issue:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייב שריפה. ואם לא נחקרה העדות בכרת אם היה מזיד. ואם היה שוגג יקריב חטאת קבועה</p>\n  \n  <p>They're punished with death by fire. If there weren't sufficient testimony, they get kares if it was intentional, and if unintentional they must bring a chatas offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I decided to check the Rav Kapach edition, and his is like the Frankel edition. The original Arabic reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ילזמה שריפה אן אסתקלת אלשהאדה, והו בכרת <strong>איצ/א</strong> אן כאן מזיד, ואן כאן שוגג יקרב חטאת קבועה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My Judaeo-Arabic is pretty rusty, but judging from other <em>mitzvos</em> in this <em>sefer</em>, the word <code>איצ/א</code> means <code>גם</code>, or \"and\".</p>\n\n<p>Something relevant is the following foonote (#70) on the word גם in Rav Kapach's edition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>במהדורתי הקודמת הושמטה תיבת \"גם\" כי לא הובנה</p>\n  \n  <p>In the previous edition of my work, the word \"also\" was removed, since it's incomprehensible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What this shows is Rav Kapach is also bothered by this question.

Even if the prospective \"<em>Sh'ma</em>\" reciter closes his eyes, it's insufficient according to many. However, if the person is covered by clear clothing or behind glass, then closing the eyes is sufficent. <em>Mishna B'rura</em> <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=216\" rel=\"noreferrer\">75:25</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is \"beyond the eyeglass lenses of the prospective reciter\" as good as \"covered by clear clothing or behind glass\"? On the one hand, it's just another case of being behind glass. On the other, I've never heard of this leniency; and maybe the fact that the lens is specifically designed for seeing through, is frequently seen through, and abuts the reciter makes the presence more of a presence, or something.

Night or blindness or closing eyes are equivalent of changing direction. BY notes that this is against Rokeach (who follows Yerushalmi). He perhaps thinks that for erva seeng is the only issue, not Place. </p>\n\n<p>BY opinion is also against the Rashba Brachot 25a who quotes Yerushalmi regarding erva (not covered by Ashashit), concerning night. The Rashba understand that blindness is an equivalent of night.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכדגרסינן בירושלמי רבי ליא וחבריא הוו יתבן קומי פונדקיא ברמשא אמרי רבי מהו מימר מילא דאורייתא אמר לון מכיון דאלו הוה ביממא הוי חמיין מה קומינן ברם כדון אסור. והוא הדין בסומא שאף על פי שאינו רואה מחמת מקרהו הרי הוא במקום שיכול לראות אילו לא היה מקרהו, שהרי כל אדם כסומין בלילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashba also quotes Yerushalmi prohibits to read Shma in front of erva at night  or in a blindness state. It seems now that Rambam didn't agree with the apparent pshat of the Yerushalmi.</p>\n\n<p>Bet Yosef can argue that the Yerushalmi thinks that for erva there is a din of \"Machane\", and we takes the opinion of the Bavli. </p>\n\n<p>Bach </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא נהירא שהרי מפורש בירושלמי דבלילה אסור כיון שאם היה יום היה רואה ולפ\"ז עוצם עיניו נמי אסור כיון שאם לא היה עוצם עיניו היה רואה הערוה לפניו דלא עדיף עוצם עיניו מבלילה וכ\"כ הרוקח דאפילו יעצים עיניו אסור ומביאו ב\"י ולא דמי להחזרת פנים דכשמחזיר פניו חשוב כאילו הערוה היא ברשות אחד והקורא שמע ברשות אחר שהרי עיניו פתוחות ואינו רואה אותה דמותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Bach makes a kind of shalom between Rambam and Yerushalmi (but this teruts is not valuable fo the extension of the din to closing eyes infered by Bet Yosef) that apparently contradict him. Bach makes a chiluk, to change head orientation because the body turned to an other side (machzir panav) is equivalent to changing place (the Taz is machmir to move the whole body, to turn the neck is not sufficient), far from the erva. But closing eyes or to become blind is not changing rapport to the erva  This is a new kind of changing place that remembers the din of tsoa, מחנים קדוש</p>\n\n<p>Mishna Berura sk 29</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב במשבצות זהב דאם הוא ברשות אחד ואדם ערום הוא ברשות אחר כנגדו והוא עוצם עיניו מלראותו י\"ל דשרי בזה לכו\"ע וכן משמע קצת בדרך החיים ובסימן ע\"ט אות ח' באשל אברהם משמע דחזר מזה וכן בח\"א כלל ד' אות ט' לא משמע כן אכן אם חלון של זכוכית מפסיק בינו לערוה ועוצם עיניו מלראותו מהני לכו\"ע כיון דיש עכ\"פ איזה חציצה המכסה נגד הערוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For erva there is no din of \"מחנך קדוש\"  But The Bach extends it to erva.  We have a different concept of place.  Places you can not easily see Are different, not similar to the case of the Yerushalmi. In such a context, closing eyes is good enough even for the cholkim with Bet Yosef.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The source of this chidush is  a Gemara (25b) treating the case of a man immersed paritally in mikveh, up to the level of the abdomen. He can read Shema, despite the transparence of water. This makes the chiluk from the Yerushalmi quoted by rishonim (regarding erva in front of you, in your vision field). So, the chumra of the Yerushalmi regarding night or closing eyes is not relevant for Mike and for Ashashit.  <strong>What is the similarity between the water of a mikveh in which the low part of the body is immersed and the Ashashit? This is the fact that they make a little not easy your gaze, and naturally, you are not watching in the direction of the water or the object inside the Ashashit. So, closing eyes is enough to allow KS. When there is no filters between eyes and erva, you have no difficulty to see it.</strong>  <strong>Glasses are made to improve vision, not to diminish your vision. Glasses facilitate your vision of the erva. Glasses are fixed in front of your eyes, you have no possibility to show things not through glasses.</strong> (I find this in old notes on my Rashba. ). So the Yerushalmi is not a kashia.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Are there any other sources that speak about common things that happen during your sleep that are actually actions of your soul? This interests me greatly. Thanks! </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes, there are connections between the workings of the soul and the involuntary bodily processes of sleep. For example, Milton <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41782-017-0012-y#\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kramer</a> argued that the revolutionary decision of Freud to ascribe medical significance to dreams was connected to ideas about dreams in the Babylonian Talmud. Freud’s hypothesis was that dreams are not simply random electrical noise.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.55b.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 55b</a>, for instance, says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַב הוּנָא בַּר אַמֵּי אָמַר רַבִּי פְּדָת אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: הָרוֹאֶה חֲלוֹם וְנַפְשׁוֹ עֲגוּמָה, יֵלֵךְ וְיִפְתְּרֶנּוּ בִּפְנֵי שְׁלֹשָׁה. ״יִפְתְּרֶנּוּ״?! וְהָאָמַר רַב חִסְדָּא חֶלְמָא דְּלָא מְפַשַּׁר כְּאִגַּרְתָּא דְּלָא מִקַּרְיָא? אֶלָּא אֵימָא: יְטִיבֶנּוּ בִּפְנֵי שְׁלֹשָׁה. לַיְתֵי תְּלָתָא וְלֵימָא לְהוּ: ״חֶלְמָא טָבָא חֲזַאי״. וְלֵימְרוּ לֵיהּ הָנָךְ: ״טָבָא הוּא וְטָבָא לֶיהֱוֵי, רַחֲמָנָא לְשַׁוְּיֵיהּ לְטָב. שְׁבַע זִימְנִין לִגְזְרוּ עֲלָךְ מִן שְׁמַיָּא דְּלֶהֱוֵי טָבָא, וְיֶהֱוֵי טָבָא״. וְלֵימְרוּ שָׁלֹשׁ הֲפוּכוֹת, וְשָׁלֹשׁ פְּדוּיוֹת, וְשָׁלֹשׁ שְׁלוֹמוֹת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Huna bar Ami said that Rabbi Pedat said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: One who sees a dream from which his soul is distraught, should go and have it interpreted before three. The Gemara is surprised by this: Interpreted? Didn’t Rav Ḥisda say: A dream not interpreted is like a letter not read? If one is concerned about a dream, why would he actively promote its fulfillment? Rather, say as follows: He should better it before three. He should bring three people and say to them: I saw a good dream. And they should say to him: It is good, and let it be good, may God make it good. May they decree upon you from heaven seven times that it will be good, and it will be good. Afterwards they recite three verses of transformation from bad to good, three verses of redemption, and three verses which mention peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This tradition, of turning a bad dream into good, appears in the ArtScroll siddur. Here, the Gemara says that rather than ignoring a dream with an apparent negative content, one should recontextualize it in the presence of others by reciting verses from the Torah.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12519653_Sigmund_Freud_and_the_Lubavitcher_Rebbe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Schneider & Berke</a>, the fifth Lubavitcher Rebbe was an analysand of Freud himself. In a reconstructed dialogue, Freud challenges the Rebbe, asking him how it is possible to bridge the gap between “head” and “heart.” The Rebbe responded that one must connect them “with telephone lines and electric wires” to bring the light of the mind to the heart.</p>\n<p>Your question suggests that processes during sleep, such as those governed by the limbic system, could be “actually” workings of the soul. This framing assumes a clear distinction between the soul and the body, which may be related to Greek-influenced translations of the word “nefesh” in Torah sources. There are multiple definitions of “soul” in Lashon HaKodesh, and none of them translate directly into English.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/220/Q4/#:%7E:text=The%20nefesh%20is%20the%20spiritual,working%20and%20the%20person%20alive.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nefesh</a> is the spiritual existence which resides in the body and keeps the physical metabolism working and the person alive. The ruach is a connection between the neshama and the nefesh. It is the cause of feelings and personal qualities. The neshama is the spiritual existence which pulls the man towards G-d, to the performance of good deeds, to be pious and humble and to seek knowledge and achievement in spiritual fields. It resides around the head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>“Soul,” then, refers to multiple different approaches to understanding a spiritual being, including both physical and extra-physical elements.</p>\n<p>The light of the mind connected to the heart with “telephone lines and electrical wires” would be similar to the light of day allowing us to apply our intellect to the “dream-text,” which is itself influenced by, and covered by, the “residue of the day” that provide its raw material.</p>\n<p>When Pharaoh dreamt about cattle, he may have been influenced by seeing his cattle that day, but the genius of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yosef</a> HaTzaddik was recognizing that the cattle represented something else within the consciousness of Pharaoh.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm curious if there are any notable differences between an adult and child circumcision. Examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I've never seen local anesthetics used for a child. Perhaps, babies are more tolerant of the pain than adults. Do they use any anesthetic for adults?</li>\n<li>I assume that there is no <em>sandak</em> at an adult brit? The sandak usually holds the baby on his lap. I don't think a sandak could hold an adult on his lap.</li>\n<li>In what position is the adult? Lying on a \"mat\"? Sitting?</li>\n<li>Is recovery time longer for an adult than for a child? Are there any physical dangers / problems that may occur afterwards for an adult that are different than those that may occur for a baby? (E.g. different or higher degree of infections, etc.)</li>\n<li>In the prayer after the child's brit, there's a phrase that says (loose translation):</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This little one shall grow. In the manner that he entered the brit, so\n  shall he enter Torah, Chuppah and good deeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I assume the we eliminate the 1st sentence.

For instance, on Rosh Chodesh Elul, do we say Barchi Nafshi before L’Dovid, since we say Barchi Nafshi during at least 11 months of the year, but we only say L’Dovid during 2? Or do we say L’Dovid first, since Barchi Nafshi is said on at most 20 days of the year, but L’Dovid is said on 51 days; alternatively, Barchi Nafshi is said at the conclusion of at most 20 tefillos, but L’Dovid is said at that of 102? In other words, if item A is more common than item B if you look at it one way, but item B is more common than item A if you look at it a different way, do we consider either one to take precedence, and if so, how to we determine which one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a similar instance in bentching.</p>\n<p>Shulchan Aruch in 188:5 states that Retzei comes before Yaaleh Veyovo on a Shabbos that falls on Rosh Chodesh or Yom Tov. The Mishna Berura (13) says that it's because Shabbos is Tadir.</p>\n<p>Now, if you count the amount of times you say Yaaleh Veyovo including in Shemona Esrei it's more than the amount of times that we say Retzei. However, the Mishna Berura uses the word \"Shabbos\" not \"Retzei\" seemingly to avoid this problem. It sounds like he means to say that it's not based on the amount of times you say the tefilla but rather the day that causes the tefilla to be said is Tadir (in this case Shabbos vs. Yomim Tovim and Rosh Chodesh).</p>\n<p>In fact, in your case of L'Dovid and Barchi Nafshi, the Mishna Berura in 583:2 clearly says that you should say Barchi Nafshi first. The Maateh Ephraim (583:6) says the reason is because it is Tadir since it is said every Rosh Chodesh while L'Dovid isn't said every Rosh Chodesh. R' Yackov Kamenetzky (Emes L'Yackov 1) explains that although L'Dovid is actually said more times than Barchi Nafshi, since it's not because of a day rather just a season, it doesn't become Tadir just by being said more times. Barchi Nafshi is because of the day.</p>\n<p>So just like Yaaleh Veyovo vs Retzei, we always look at the amount of days that cause something to be said or done, not the actual amount of times it is done.</p>\n<p>P.S. my calculation for more Yasleh Veyovo is as follows:\nRosh Chodesh 54 Tefillos 10 meals (4 on Rosh Hashanah and at least 2 shabbos Rosh chodesh per year)\nYom Kippur 4\nSuccos 24 Tefillos 17 meals\nPesach 24 tefillos 17 meals\nShavuos 6 tefillos 4 meals\nTotal 160\nRetzei is 50 times 3 which is 150\nObviously in Eretz Yisroel it's equal, but if someone washes on Rosh Chodesh during the week that would add more Yaaleh Veyovo.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This question is similar to the question of lighting Channukah candles on Motzaei Shabbos Channukah. There are different minhagim. Look at the footnotes <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/lighting-on-motzei-shabbos/#_ftn7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, where some poskim hold that havdallah is tadir even though in the micro-time period Channukah is more tadir. This however isn't an exact comparison. </p>\n\n<p>You should also know that some things take precedence over tadir v'ayno tadir e.g. something that is pertaining to a special time period, like the special Yom Tov tefillos before krias HaTorah coming before Brich Shmei even though the latter is tadir. Seeing as how L'Dovid isn't directly due to a special time and the Shir Shel Yom of Rosh Chodesh is due to the special Shir of Rosh Chodesh, that is another reason why it might come first.</p>\n\n\n",

He was an Israeli whom people might call \"דתי לאומי\", but beyond that had AFAIK no particular expertise in the subject at hand; but what he said makes good sense to me. He said that the elementary schools called \"דתי לאומי\" (or \"ממלכתי דתי\") generally get a mix of children whose families use various versions of the prayers, and therefore most such schools use \"<em>S'farad</em>\" as a sort of compromise, since it will be least dissimilar to the greatest number of people's home versions.

On the one hand, the Talmud calls dreams 1/60th of\n  prophecy. </p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, the Talmud writes that the interpretation of dreams\n  is in the hands of the interpreter, and that an unexplained dream has\n  no significance at all The implication is that dreams are certainly\n  not prophetic. They do not mean anything at all on their own. They\n  can, however, be interpreted – and their interpretation will come\n  true. </p>\n  \n  <p>Finally, the Talmud states that people are shown in dreams that which\n  they were thinking about during the day, and that even significant\n  dreams contain their share of nonsense. </p>\n  \n  <p>If you had a disturbing dream which you think might be significant,\n  Jewish law outlines a few means of mollifying its effects:</p>\n  \n  <p>(a) Reciting the “amelioration of dreams” prayer. This may be found in\n  any complete prayer book, together with the relevant instructions.</p>\n  \n  <p>(b) The Talmud states that fasting the day after a disturbing dream is\n  especially effective, and that one should do so even on Shabbat if the\n  dream occurred Friday night (Shabbat 11a). In practice, since we\n  generally do not take our dreams that seriously today, we need not\n  fast. However, in lieu of fasting it would be appropriate to give\n  charity, study extra Torah, and refrain from wasteful speech (Piskei\n  Teshuvot 220:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/sp/ph/Judaism-and-Dreams.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish article</a> explains the difference between dreams and prophecy. </p>\n\n\n",

In all of these, I have seen the mourner outside the shul for Kabbalat Shabbat. This occurred in all cases when the mourner is there for Mincha and is necessary for the minyan, or even if he is not needed. (In most cases, the mourner is <em>Shat'z</em>, though in a few shuls, the mourner is not competent to be <em>Shat\"z</em>.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/0035-0052.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> that discusses if Kabbalat Shabbat is considered <em>tefillah betzibbur</em>. It seems to lean to the idea that it is not. If that's the case, it may present the question as to whether a mourner should be out of his home when it is not yet Shabbat other than for the purpose of saying Kaddish which requires a minyan. (There is general consensus that reciting Kabbalat Shabbat is not an acceptance of Shabbat, though, see <a href=\"https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:qDCydb13Su8J:https://www.torahmusings.com/2018/06/ushering-in-an-avel-after-sunset-of-shabbat/%20&cd=20&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> that discusses some interesting issues of a minyan that accepts Shabbat \"early\".) </p>\n\n<p>Thus, while the mourner was present for <em>Mincha</em> to say Kaddish, he is asked to leave for Kabbalat Shabbat because it is still a \"weekday\". Shabbat acceptance begins at the point of saying Psalm 92 (according to many opinions. See 2nd link that discusses alternate opinions.) That's why the congregational \"greeting\" is said then, and for the mourner it is Shabbat, when he may enter the shul.</p>\n\n<p>It is common to say a Psalm prior to reciting the mourner's Kaddish. That partially explains why Psalm 92 is said, then.</p>\n\n\n",

Slandering the item is by extension slandering the person who owns it. See for example R' Nissim Karelitz's Chut Shani 4:4 where h explains the Halachah in this manner.</p>\n\n<p>It can therefore be logically extended to say that speaking slander against a business would be forbidden for the same reason. Since there is almost always a person behind the business, slandering the business would be an externsion of slandering the person behind it.</p>\n\n<p>(Note that this answer is assuming two points: 1) that there is 'a person' behind the company. In most cases there likely is a distinct person who could be named as 'the person behind the company', but perhaps in some cases there is no specific person behind the company (maybe some large, public company?) which would permit speaking Lashon Hora about it. 2) The information being shared falls under the category of Lashon Hora. There are times when one is allowed to share information constructively (Toeles), but that's beyond the scope of this answer, which assuming that the information is not Toeles)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/sidebar/lecture.cfm/899621/rabbi-sariel-malitzky/sefer-chafetz-chaim-shiur-13/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Shiur</a> on YU Torah for the sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://torah.org/learning/halashon-review1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">@torah.org</a> has a useful review of the laws of loshon hora.

Insulting someone’s possessions ultimately\n  insults the owner as well. <strong>Degrading groups of people reflects\n  unfavorably upon each member of the group.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that by saying that a certain school is bad or a restaurant serves bad food, if the responsible individuals can be identified, this will constitute loshon hora. </p>\n\n\n",

But something which is derogatory such as a sin that one has transgressed, it is forbidden to publicize it even if the person himself mentioned it in front of three people or posted it on his website, because it might embarrass him, and the intention of the person publicizing it is to embarrass him.

H/t to @ba who noted the language similarity.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִי שֶׁהָיָה דּוֹלֶה אֶת הֶחָבִית לְהַעֲלוֹתָהּ לַגַּג. וְנִפְסַק הַחֶבֶל וְנָפְלָה עַל חֲבֵרוֹ וַהֲרָגַתְהוּ. אוֹ שֶׁהָיָה עוֹלֶה בַּסֻּלָּם וְנָפַל עַל חֲבֵרוֹ וַהֲרָגוֹ. <strong>פָּטוּר מִן הַגָּלוּת. שֶׁזֶּה כְּמוֹ אָנוּס הוּא. שֶׁאֵין זֶה דָּבָר הַקָּרוֹב לִהְיוֹת בְּרֹב הָעִתִּים אֶלָּא כְּמוֹ פֶּלֶא הוּא.</strong> אֲבָל אִם הָיָה מְשַׁלְשֵׁל אֶת הֶחָבִית וְנָפְלָה עַל חֲבֵרוֹ וַהֲרָגַתְהוּ. הָיָה יוֹרֵד בַּסֻּלָּם וְנָפַל עַל חֲבֵרוֹ. הָיָה מְעַגֵּל בְּמַעְגֵּלָה וְנָפְלָה עַל חֲבֵרוֹ וַהֲרָגַתְהוּ. גּוֹלֶה. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (במדבר לה כג) \"וַיַּפֵּל עָלָיו וַיָּמֹת\" שֶׁיִּפּל דֶּרֶךְ נְפִילָה. <strong>שֶׁהֲרֵי דֶּרֶךְ נְפִילָה מָצוּי בְּרֹב הָעִתִּים לְהַזִּיק וְדָבָר קָרוֹב הוּא לִהְיוֹת. שֶׁהֲרֵי טֶבַע הַכָּבֵד לֵירֵד לְמַטָּה בִּמְהֵרָה. וְהוֹאִיל וְלֹא זֵרֵז עַצְמוֹ וְתִקֵּן מַעֲשָׂיו יָפֶה בִּשְׁעַת יְרִידָה יִגְלֶה.</strong> וְכֵן כָּל כַּיּוֹצֵא בָּזֶה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have bolded two sections of this Ramabm.  The first section is the \"reason\" (see Penei Yehoshua here) given for why Derech Aliyah (going upwards) is exempt from Galus.  The Rambam says that it is because this is not something that happens regularly, rather, it is highly unlikely to happen. \nThe second section writes that a downward fall is more likely to happen, and therefore, if that happens, it is a case of negligence.  </p>\n\n<p>In summary, if it is Derech Yeridah, extra care should have been taken, and therefore, one is negligent if it happened to them.  If it was going upwards, there is no negligence at all, since that very rarely happens.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with this is that if so, it seems unfair that in this case, the person should have no place to run; he is theoretically even more innocent than the negligent person!  In this case, he has no protection from the Goel Hadam!</p>\n\n<p>The Korban Haedah here writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל שבדרך ירידתו גולה. דכתיב ויפול עליו עד שיהא דרך נפילה והטעם שקרוב הדבר שבשגגה נעשה שטבע הכבד לירד למטה במהרה <strong>ודרך עלייה אין רגילות ליפול וקרוב הדבר שהוא מזיד</strong> לכך אינו גולה ואם ימצאנו גואל הדם רשאי להרגו וכל דנקט התנא לאתויי אפילו ירידה שהיא לצורך עלייה מיקרי ירידה: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The bolded section is where he writes that it is highly unlikely that that it will fall downwards when one is going up.  Because it is so unlikely, the odds are that if this happened, it was a case of Meizid, because it is so unlikely to take place as an Ones.  This is an interpretation of the Rambam, that answers the question asked above, of how can we not afford this person any protection.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, in his \"Tosfos-equivalent Peirush\" (Shayarei Korban), he claims that this is the opinion of the Rambam!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל שבדרך ירידה כו'. עיין בקונטרס כ\"כ הרמב\"ם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that there he goes on to disagree with the Rambam personally in the Shayarei Korban.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: I'm not agreeing or disagreeing, simply noting that this was how the Korban Haedah felt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shitta mekubetzes Kesubos 37b says that this is a machlokes between Rashi and tosfos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אפשר לומר דס\"ל לתוס' דגלות לא מקרי כפרה דאדרבה חומרא הוא שהחמירה תורה עליו דלא תסגי ליה בקרבן וכדכתבינן ודרך עליה משום דקיל טפי דהוי אנוס ביותר להכי לא ניתן לשגגתו גלות וכדבעינן למכתב קמן בס\"ד<br>\n  According to Tosfos  exile is a very strict punishment which the Torah imposed on him for an undisclosed time period and did not absolve him with the mere payment of a Korban. Therefore killing upwards which is less strict and is less purposeful does not need the severe punishment of galus.</p>\n  \n  <p>ולשיטת רש\"י ז\"ל ניחא דה\"ק אצטריך סד\"א ה\"מ היכא דהרגו דרך עליה פירוש דמלא תקחו כופר לא שמעינן אלא דרך עליה ותנא דברייתא נקט מיתות קלות שניתן שגגתן לכפרה<br>\n  According to Rashi the passuk \"Velo tikchu kofer\" that forbids payment of money as replacement for punishment would only apply if one killed upwards which is stricter, but the braisa brings an extra passuk to inform us even killing downwards which is more lenient and has an atonement when done by mistake is also not absolved through money rather requires galus.(see Rashi and Tosfos on Kesubos 37b where this is more clear)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rosh quoted in the Shita Mekubetzes and Rambam (rotzeach 6,12) agree with Tosfos that killing upwards is more lenient.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והרא\"ש ז\"ל פירש כפירוש התוספות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shitta Mekubetzes Rav Betzalel Ashkenazi (16th century contempory of the Beis Yosef) agrees with Rashi that killing upwards is more severe:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולשיטת רש\"י ז\"ל ניחא טפי הא לישנא דנקט תלמודא הכי משמע דלא תקחו כופר היכא דהרגו דרך עליה שלא נתנה שגגתן לכפרה לא בממון ולא בגלות אבל הרגו דרך ירידה דנתנה שגגתן לכפרה אימא נשקול ממונא ונפטריה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Although @רבות מחשבות pointed out the premise of my question seems mistaken, the question still stands: does any Rishon hold killing upward is more negligent than downward. @user15464 pointed out that the Shita Mekubetzes to Kesubos 37b  understands Rashi there to be hold thusly.</p>\n\n<p>For completeness I'll add my findings. Footnote 14 in the Mossad HaRav Kook edition of Chiddushei HaRashba (by Rav Yaakov Dovid Ilan) ad. loc. understands that the Ramban, Ra'ah, Ritvah and Rabbeinu Keraskas ad. loc. all hold upward is more negligent. I looked at all those sources, and found no indication how they felt in either direction (pun unintended). The footnote also posits Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Ketubot.35a.3.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to 35a</a> holds its a <em>gezeiras hakasuv</em>, decree of the writ, that inadvertent upward killings don't have exile. This doesn't follow the Shita's understanding of Rashi. I also (humbly so) disagree with the footnote's understanding of that Rashi.</p>\n\n<p>One potentially explicit source is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Halachot_on_Sanhedrin.79b.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha's understanding</a> of Tosafos to Sanhedrin 79b <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.79b.3.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה בין</a>. The Maharsha writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר\"ל דלא ליפטור המזיד עצמו ממיתה בממון אפילו בדרך ירידה דסלקא דעתך אמינא הא דכתיב ולא תקחו כופר לנפש רוצח דלא ליפטור עצמו בממון <strong>היינו בדרך עלייה שהוא חמור</strong> שלא נתנה שגגתו לכפרה אבל דרך ירידה שהוא קל שניתן שגגתו לכפרה על ידי שהוא גולה אימא דבמזיד נמי מקילינן ביה דשקלינן מיניה ממונא וניפטריה ממיתה</p>\n  \n  <p>[Tosafos] mean to say, an intentional killer cannot absolve themselves with money, even by killing downwards. Because I would have said, the verse which says \"don't take a redemption for the soul of the killer\", that he can't absolve himself with money, is talking about where he <strong>killed in an upward fashion, which is more severe</strong> since if done unintentionally there would be no atonement (with exile). However, killing in a downward fashion, which is less severe, since killing inadvertently this way has atonement through exile, I'd say killing intentionally should also have a leniency. That is, we'd take money from him to absolve him from the death penalty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One could perhaps argue that the Maharsha really means that killing <strong>intentionally upward</strong> is more severe, since its correlating case when unintentional has no atonement. However, Keser HaTorah to Rambam Rotzeach 6:12 understands the Maharsha to be saying killing upwards is more negligent, unlike the Rambam. The above-mentioned footnote also understands the Maharsha this way.</p>\n\n<p>Although, to be honest, I don't understand what in Tosafos' words compelled the Maharsha to explain it this way.</p>\n\n\n",

I also think the rabbi or the writer of the article gave an example that in the Talmud there were opinions such as that there will not even be a literal human messiah but God will directly intervene. </p>\n\n<p>However, once Rambam codified the 13 principles it became forbidden to hold contradictory opinions like that. I also read about something similar regarding the nature of God in another article. That before Rambam also codified the 13 principles it was allowed for people to have different opinions about the nature of God. That is why the Talmud has many discussions representing God in a corporeal body. And just as with the messiah, once Rambam codified the 13 principles those opinions became forbidden to accept about the nature of God. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer indeed said this, in his last responsum on Yoreh Deiah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14664&st=&pgnum=293\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"># 356</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאומר אין משיח וקים לי' כרבי הלל הרי הוא כופר בכלל התורה דכיילי אחרי\n  רבים להטות כיון שרבו עליו חכמי ישראל ואמרו דלא כוותי' שוב אין אדם\n  ראוי' להמשך אחריו</p>\n  \n  <p>And one who says \"there is no Messiah for Israel\" and holds like Rabbi\n  Hillel is a denier of the Torah because we measure by the majority.\n  Since the Sages of Israel amassed against him and they said not like\n  him, henceforth it is improper for anyone to follow after him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hillel's view is found in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=99&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 99a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ר' הילל אומר אין להם משיח לישראל שכבר אכלוהו בימי חזקיה אמר רב יוסף\n  שרא ליה מריה לרבי הילל חזקיה אימת הוה בבית ראשון ואילו זכריה קא מתנבי\n  בבית שני ואמר גילי מאד בת ציון הריעי בת ירושלים הנה מלכך יבא לך צדיק\n  ונושע הוא עני ורוכב על חמור ועל עיר בן אתונות</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Hillel said: There shall be no Messiah for Israel, because they\n  have already enjoyed him in the days of Hezekiah. R. Joseph said: May\n  God forgive him [for saying so]. Now, when did Hezekiah flourish?\n  During the first Temple. Yet Zechariah, prophesying in the days of the\n  second, proclaimed, Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion, shout, O\n  daughter of Jerusalem, behold, thy king cometh unto thee! he is just,\n  and having salvation, lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt\n  the foal of an ass. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/nezikin/Sanhedrin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that this does not appear to be the consensus of rishonim on how to deal with Rabbi Hillel's opinion. In fact several rishonim use this as a proof that Rambam is incorrect that belief in the Messiah is a fundamental belief.</p>\n\n<p>For instance, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Albo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Joseph Albo</a> writes the following: </p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34496&st=&pgnum=17&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkkarim 1:1</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא שבלי ספק רבי הלל לא היה מאמין בביאת המשיח כלל ואף על פי כן לא היה\n  נמנה בכלל הכופרים לפי שאין ביאת המשיח עקר לתורת משה כמו שכתב הרמב\"ם\n  ז\"ל כי כבר יצוייר מציאותה זולתו</p>\n  \n  <p>Rather, without a doubt Rabbi Hillel did not believe in the coming of\n  the Messiah at all, and even so he was not counted among the deniers\n  because the coming of the Messiah is not fundamental to the Torah of\n  Moses like Rambam of blessed memory wrote since it's [Judaism's]\n  existence is already conceivable without it [the Messiah].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani_the_Younger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaiah (the Younger) of Trani</a> writes the following:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Riaz Kuntres HaRayos Sanhedrin 90a</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהרי הלל שהיה מחכמי התלמוד היה אומר אין משיח לישראל שכבר אכלוהו בימי\n  חזקיהו וכל המקראות שנאמרו על הגואל היה מפרשן לשעבר ולא נקרא כופר בכך</p>\n  \n  <p>For behold Hillel – who was of the Sages of the Talmud – would say\n  \"there is no Messiah for Israel because they already consumed it in\n  the days of Hezekiah\", and all the verses that were said about the\n  redeemer he would explain [as referring] to that which has passed, and\n  [yet] he was not called a denier for this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

When determining\n  which birds are kosher to eat, we require a clear mesorah, tradition,\n  that our ancestors ate these birds.11 However, when determining which\n  birds are fit for the mitzvah of Shiluach Hakan, we may rely on the\n  physical signs of kosher birds as delineated by Chazal.12 Therefore,\n  we can distinguish among three categories of birds: </p>\n  \n  <p>1) Kosher birds which we eat and may use to fulfill the mitzvah, for\n  example certain species of pigeons, doves, geese, and ducks;</p>\n  \n  <p>2) Birds which exhibit kosher signs,13 yet do not have a clear\n  mesorah, for example sparrows, robins, cardinals, and orioles. These\n  birds may be used to fulfill the mitzvah, but they are not considered\n  kosher to eat; </p>\n  \n  <p>and 3) Birds which are definitely non-kosher with which we should not\n  perform Shiluach Hakan. This includes eagles, ravens and other birds\n  of prey. Eligibility is also determined by gender and age as follows:</p>\n  \n  <p>A. Gender</p>\n  \n  <p>The mitzvah can be fulfilled only when the mother bird is roosting.\n  Since the male also roosts at times, one should determine the gender\n  of the bird before sending it away. However, there is generally no way\n  the layperson can distinguish between genders of birds. Of note, the\n  male dove, pigeon and sparrow will usually sit during the day while\n  the female sits at night. Therefore, the mitzvah should be fulfilled\n  at night. The female American Robin, Canada Goose and Mallard Duck sit\n  both day and night. If the roosting habits are unknown, one should\n  fulfill the mitzvah at night, as we assume it is the mother on the\n  nest.14</p>\n  \n  <p>B. Age</p>\n  \n  <p>One may fulfill the mitzvah any time the mother is incubating her eggs\n  or brood.15 However, once the chicks develop the ability to fly on\n  their own, the mitzvah may no longer be fulfilled.16 Chicks usually\n  develop this ability approximately two weeks after hatching, depending\n  upon the species.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Q What should we do with that egg afterward?</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Taking Eggs or Chicks</p>\n  \n  <p>Once the mother bird has flown away, one must take the eggs or\n  chicks.27 Even if the mother bird is watching, one still fulfills the\n  mitzvah. To perform a halachic acquisition, they should be lifted to a\n  height of three tefachim (about 12 inches).28 Upon completion of the\n  mitzvah, one may put back the eggs or chicks and need not keep them.29</p>\n  \n  <p>After one takes the eggs or chicks, they may be declared hefker by the\n  one who acquired them and then returned to the nest.30 After the\n  mother bird returns, another person may fulfill the mitzvah. In this\n  way, the same nest may be used over and over again.31</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Q What is the purpose of this mitzva</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Possible Reasons for the Mitzvah</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rabbis ruled that a person may not state that the reason for the\n  mitzvah is compassion for the mother bird. One commentator interprets\n  the Talmud’s prohibition as applying strictly to reciting this in\n  one’s prayers, as if to establish compassion as the definitive, sole\n  reason. In reality, there are many reasons for the mitzvah, and\n  compassion is but one facet.3</p>\n  \n  <p>The Ramban states that compassion for the mother bird herself is not a\n  motive for this mitzvah, since human needs override those of animals.\n  Rather, the Torah wishes us to act compassionately so that we instill\n  this trait in ourselves. He also references a profound kabbalistic\n  reason (sod) for this mitzvah. Rabbeinu Bachya states that taking the\n  mother and her offspring at the same time is analogous to destroying\n  the entire species.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Q Is it OK if there's a time gap between scaring off the bird and taking the egg (ten, twenty, thirty minutes)?</em>  - no answer found</p>\n\n\n",

This is helpful because Rambam holds that in a place of Beis Din Kavuah, Shofar would be blown on Shabbos even nowadays.  (Based on this, the Kaf Hachaim here suggests that the words \"on Shabbos\" are not exact, and can be read as on Rosh Hashana, and in fact, many authorities make similar corrections).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Being that you might not like the above answer, I will note that this is asked by a few other Acharonim.  R' Yaakov Emden in Mor Uketziah here is astonished that he could not find anyone who addressed it, and does not provide an answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שם. כתב הרמב\"ם שאמירה לגוי מותרת בשבות שיש בו (קצת)2 צורך מצוה כגון שא\"ל לעלות באילן להביא שופר כו'. דברים הללו תמוהים הם וצריך לדחוק מאד ליישבם, אפילו אליבא דרמב\"ם, דנסיב נמי מאי דלא נהיג האידנא (כמ\"ש בס\"ד בהגהותי לחבורו פ\"ו מהל' שבת). מ\"מ על הטור תמיהא קיימת, כ\"ש הש\"ע דאכפל וטרח למכתב מידי דלא צריך לן לגמרי, (ואין) [ואף] אחד מהאחרונים לא חלי ולא מרגיש. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Machatzis Hashekel suggests that this takes place when Rosh Hashana is on Sunday, and the non-Jew is bringing it to be blown on the following day.  Note that this opens a completely different Halachic discussion, which I will not go in to here.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודע, דלפי מה שכתב בשו\"ע, וכן כתב הרמב\"ם [שבת ו, י], אומר ישראל לגוי בשבת לעלות באילן להביא שופר, והא קיימא לן [סימן תקפח סעיף ה] דתקיעת שופר לדידן לא דחי שבת, על כרחך צריך לומר דמיירי שחל ראש השנה יום שבת ויום א' שאחריו, ומביאו לצורך יום א' שהוא יום שני של ראש השנה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The concept of stealing from one's parents does exist.</p>\n\n<p>We see it by Ben-Sorer, who only qualifies once he steals from his parents. (Sanhedrin Mishna 8:3 - אֵינוֹ נַעֲשֶׂה בֵן סוֹרֵר וּמוֹרֶה, עַד שֶׁיִּגְנֹב מִשֶּׁל אָבִיו)</p>\n\n<p>We also have Mishnayot that discuss how to return stolen goods from one's parents after their demise. (E.g. bava Kama Mishna 7:2 - גָּנַב מִשֶּׁל אָבִיו וְטָבַח וּמָכַר וְאַחַר כָּךְ מֵת אָבִיו)</p>\n\n<p>So you cannot simply go around your parents' house using their private property.</p>\n\n<p>Unless, of course, they give you explicit or implicit permission to use certain items. I think that these 2 paragraphs in the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch - סימן קפב - הלכות גנבה וגזלה sum it up:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>:סעיף י\"ג</strong> \n  אָסוּר לֵהָנוֹת מִשׁוּם דָּבָר שֶׁל חֲבֵרוֹ שֶׁלֹּא מִדַּעְתּוֹ. אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁבָּרוּר לוֹ שֶׁכְּשֶיִוָּדַע לִבְעָלָיו יִשְׂמְחוּ וְיָגִילוּ מִפְנֵי אַהֲבָתָם אוֹתוֹ. מִכָּל מָקוֹם אָסוּר. לְפִיכָךְ הַנִּכְנָס לְפַרְדֵּס אוֹ לְגִנַּת חֲבֵרוֹ, אָסוּר לוֹ לִלְקֹט פֵּרוֹת שֶׁלֹּא מִדַּעַת הַבְּעָלִים. אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁבַּעַל הַפַּרְדֵּס וּבַעַל הַגִּנָּה אוֹהֲבוֹ וְרֵעוֹ אֲשֶׁר כְּנַפְשוֹ, וּבְּוַדַּאי יִשְׂמַח וְיָגִיל כְּשֶׁיִוָּדַע לוֹ שֶׁנֶּהֱנָה זֶה מִפֵּרוֹתָיו, מִכָּל מָקוֹם כֵּיוָן שֶׁעַכְשָו אֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ מִזֶה, הֲרֵי הוּא נֶהֱנֶה בְּאִסּוּר. וְצָרִיךְ לְהַזְהִיר לָרַבִּים, שֶׁנִּכְשָׁלִין בָּזֶה מֵחֲמַת חֶסְרוֹן יְדִיעָה. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Roughly: \"One may not use other people's property without their knowledge, even if you know for a fact they will be thrilled once they find out.\"</p>\n\n<p>So, once they <strong>know</strong> you're using their stuff, and they don't make an effort to keep it out of reach o put it in a room you're not expected to enter (e.g. their bedroom or private study) then one can use it even without explicit knowledge.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>:סעיף י\"ד</strong> \n  וּמִכָּל מָקוֹם מֻתָּר לְבֶן בֵּיתוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם לִתֵּן פְּרוּסָה לְעָנִי אוֹ לִבְנוֹ שֶׁל אוֹהֲבוֹ שֶׁל בַּעַל הַבַּיִת שֶׁלֹּא מִדַּעְתּוֹ, לְפִי שֶׁכָּךְ נָהֲגוּ בַּעֲלֵי הַבָּתִּים. וְאֵין זֶה נִקְרָא שֶׁלֹּא מִדַּעַת הַבְּעָלִים, כֵּיוָן שֶׁכָּךְ נָהֲגוּ, וְהַבְּעָלִים יוֹדְעִין מִזֶּה הַמִּנְהָג. וּמִטַּעַם זֶה, מֻתָּר לְקַבֵּל צְדָקָה מִן הַנָּשִׁים דָּבָר מֻעָט שֶׁלֹּא מִדַּעַת הַבְּעָלִים, הוֹאִיל וְדַרְכָּן בְּכָךְ, וְיוֹדְעִין הַבְּעָלִים שֶׁדַּרְכָּן בְּכָךְ. וְכֵן בְּפַרְדֵּס, אִם הוּא רָגִיל בּוֹ לֶאֱכֹל מִפֵּרוֹתָיו מִדַּעַת הַבְּעָלִים, מֻתָּר. וְכֵן כָּל כַּיוֹצֵא בָזֶה. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Household members may away give small amounts of food, since this is accepted (and expected) behavior\"</p>\n\n<p>So anything that is a normal way to behave is considered <em>not stealing</em>.

When studying Gemora look at the small Hebrew letter adjacent to the saying e.g. א. Then look at the margin in the Ein Mishpat for  א which will say for example: מיי׳ פ׳ח שבת ה׳א a reference to the relevant chapter and Halacha in Maimonides (Rambam) which you can look up in Mishne Torah.  Then look up the corresponding Kiriat Sefer on the very same Halacha which will indicate if it is an Asmachta derabanan or Mideoraisa.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Shalom u'vracha! There are a few ways to tell. Generally, Torah law is explicit and limited to it's simple explanation. Drashot, asmachtot, and the like are more inclusive in their extrapolation to include what's not explicit. Halachot l'Moshe m'Sinai are Torah laws that have no explicit source but are recognized as fact due to their historical presence since the giving of the Tradition. </p>\n\n<p>\"En hamikra yotze midei pshuto\" means that you must take the meaning of the pasuk for it's face value unless we have a tradition from Chazal that the true intention or tradition of understanding it is different than it's pshat/simple explanation. Drashot that expound a pasuk that don't fit with it's simple explanation in the name of one Rav/Tana/Amora, is likely an asmachta. </p>\n\n<p>The practice of using the mikra to derive new or old teachings developed when the tradition of Torah began to weaken over the years from the time of matan Torah. The Chachamim of each generation were forced to revert to expounding the Written Torah in order to learn or revive the original Tradition that wasn't widely practiced. What was practiced, was generally law. New questions that weren't generally practiced, had to be learned through the expounding of the Written Torah according to the tradition they had, or learned, to derive the din. So when Chazal wished to introduce a Rabbinic law, they used their methods of expounding(to a lesser, but still authoritative, extent) to source their institution from a pasuk; like that of the Written Torah. The Rishonim are a good source to test whether a drasha is an asmachta or not, even though there are disagreements. </p>\n\n<p>But the basic test is examining how close the drash is to the simple explanation of the pasuk. If it's not, it's likely an asmachta; unless the tradition dates back to matan Torah.*This clarification is not binding on every drash! It's merely a general guideline to differentiate between a mekor and an asmachta.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is there an apparent \"high priority\" on reciting all 7 Consolation Haftarot?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Last week, I looked at the back of my shul's <em>Tiqun Kor'im</em> (I forgot which version it is, offhand) and noticed a long paragraphs explaining the different customs of what happens when Shabbat parshat <em>R'eh</em> coincides with Rosh Hodesh Ellul or <em>Machar Chodesh</em> (1st day of Rosh Hodesh on Sunday) Ellul. Some customs say to read the parshat <em>R'eh Haftarah</em> and others say to read the Rosh (or Machar) Chodesh Haftarah.</p>\n\n<p>It seems that the most common Nusach Ashkenaz practice that I have seen is to read the Rosh Hodesh haftarah on R'eh. The haftarah from R'eh is made up together with the reading of the Haftarah of Ki Tetze - i.e. Ki Tetze is read first followed by the haftarah of R'eh, as the two texts are next to each other in <em>Yeshayahu</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious as to why high priority is given to asserting that all 7 haftarot should be read and why there is a debate about it at all? The only other conflict that I am aware of that has a similar debate is if <em>Breishit</em> coincides with Rosh Hodesh or Machar Chodesh.</p>\n\n<p>There are other times when Rosh (or Machar) Chodesh coincides with other haftarot, such as:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Chanukah</li>\n<li>Parshat Sheqalim</li>\n<li>Parshat Hachodesh</li>\n<li>Mas'ei or Matot/Mas'ei (2nd week of Haftarot of \"Punishment\". This is a rare occurrence as this would happen when 1st day Pesach was on Sunday.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In these cases, from what I have seen, Rosh or Machar Chodesh haftarah is eliminated and the haftarah for the special day is said. (Though, I have seen some congregations include the 1st and last verses of the Rosh / Machar Chodesh haftarah at the end.)</p>\n\n<p>For those that decide to override R'eh with Rosh Hodesh, what would be so bad about skipping one of the 7 Consolation Haftarot? Why is there this minhag to try to make it up? And, if, in fact, these haftarot are so important, then, why not follow the predence set by the others and just not do Rosh Hodesh?</p>\n\n\n",

However, the gemara in Horayos sounds like it is a more general rule.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This topic is dealt with extensively by Rav Asher Weiss on <a href=\"http://www.torahbase.org/%D7%92%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%94-%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his website</a>. The following is a summary.</p>\n\n<p>To begin with, two major authorities have already said that today there is no practical application of <em>Chazal</em>'s dictum גדולה עבירה לשמה: The Ramchal (Kinas Hashem Tzevakos II ענין יעל) and Rav Chaim Volozhin (As pointed out by @Alex, in Keser Rosh § 132). The former wrote this to negate the behavior of those who still followed Shabtai Zvi ימ\"ש and broke the Torah, using this dictum as justification.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Weiss understands Tosafos and the Ran to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.74b.4?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74b</a> to be saying that a woman's passive participation in forbidden relations (קרקע עולם) isn't a blanket permit, rather it's just an excuse why she doesn't have to give up her life. Yael on the other hand, actively engaged in forbidden relations with Sisera. Therefore, you have to say that <strong>since it was to save the entire Jewish people</strong>, it was permitted.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Maharik (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_Maharik.165?vhe=Responsa_Maharik,_Warsaw_1884&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvos § (167)[165]</a>) says explicitly that forbidden relations are permissible when the reason it to save the entire Jewish people. He learns this from the behavior of Yael and Esther. He writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה דבר פשוט הוא כביעתא בכותחא כי אסתר לא עשתה שום איסור ולא היה בדבר אפילו נדנוד עבירה, אלא מצוה רבה עשתה כשהצילה כל ישראל וכו', וכן מצינו ביעל אשת חבר הקיני ששיבחה הכתוב במעשה דסיסרא וכו' ודבר זה מותר לעשות עבירה זו לשמה, אפילו היא אשת איש להציל את ישראל, וכן מצינו באסתר <strong>שהמציאה עצמה לאחשורוש בשעה שלא היה תובעה כדי שיתאוה לה</strong>, ויהיה נוח להתפתות לעשות לה כבקשתה</p>\n  \n  <p>Behold, it's beyond obvious that Esther didn't do a single forbidden thing, not even a smidgen of transgression. Rather, she did a huge <em>mitzvah</em>, in that she saved the Jewish people...we find similarly with Yael, which the verse praises her [for her actions]. [We see] that it's permissible to perform this transgression with the right intent. Even a married woman can do this, to save the Jewish people. <strong>We find this with Esther, who made herself appealing to Achashverosh even when he didn't ask for her to come to him, in order to entice him</strong>. This way it would be easy for him to be seduced to listen to her request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>All we see from this though is to save the <strong>entire</strong> Jewish people, not an individual.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Weiss brings a huge novelty from the Beis Yaakov (Teshuvos § 39), who discusses a case of someone who threatened to kill a man unless he had forbidden relations with a married Jewish woman. A different woman in this group volunteered to have relations with this criminal if he would spare them all, and he accepted. The question was is this woman forbidden to her husband. The Beis Yaakov says that even though she volunteered, since there was an aspect of coercion, she's permitted. To avoid a contradiction between this and Esther, he innovates that Esther in the end wasn't forbidden to Mordechai. Besides disagreeing with his innovations (as does the Shevus Yaakov II § 117), Rav Asher Weiss sees from his words that the woman in this case <strong>committed no wrong</strong>, and it was only a question if she was forbidden to her husband. This is surprising, as <strong>it was a case of saving an individual</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar case, the Shevus Yaakov (ibid) says <strong>even though the woman did properly</strong>, saving the life of everyone there by committing improper relations, she's forbidden to her husband. He invokes the actions of Yael and Esther and עבירה לשמה. We see another authority employing this idea, even when dealing with saving individuals. Rav Asher Weiss says the Ateres Chachamim (Even HaEzer § 29) writes similarly.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Nodah BeYehudah (Yoreh Deah II § 161) writes that if a married woman volunteers to forbidden relations to save others, not only is she forbidden to her husband, but <strong>she committed the severe transgression of <em>arayos</em></strong>. He says Esther was different because she was saving the entire Jewish people. Also, it was under the ruling of Mordechai and his <em>Beis Din</em>, and maybe it was through <em>ruach hakodesh</em>. Rav Asher Weiss learns from this that the only permit is through <em>ruach hakodesh</em> or a <em>Beis Din</em> with the power of the <em>Anshei Kenesses HaGedolah</em>, which have <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/753\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the power to uproot the Torah</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Weiss then examines the words of <em>Chazal</em> themselves. They didn't say גדולה עבירה לשמה as a permit to perform transgressions. Rather, it was an <em>ex post facto</em> (בדיעבד) praise of Yael's actions. Can we learn a permit at the onset (לכתחילה)? He sees from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.69a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 69a</a> that sometimes we can perform a transgression because of עת לעשות לשם. Shimon HaTzaddik wore the Kohen Gadol's clothing outside of the Temple Service when he greeted Alexander the Great, breaking the transgression of benefiting from them. He says the <em>gemarra</em> is clear the permit wasn't because of saving lives, but because of עת לעשות. Rashi (ad. loc.) even writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עת לעשות לה' - כשבא עת לעשות דבר לשמו של מקום - מותר להפר בו תורה\"</p>\n  \n  <p>עת לעשות לה'‏ - When a time comes to do something for the sake of Hashem, it is permitted to annul the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Asher Weiss sees this as a permit to break the Torah, but only coming from a ruling of \"<em>gedolei hachachamim</em>\". He also brings many cases where <em>chachmei Yisroel</em> ruled to break a light transgression in order to avoid a more severe transgression later. See there (end of § ד) for his examples. He also brings (see § ה) nine examples of <em>poskim</em> who employed the concept of גדולה עבירה לשמה. He ends with the opinion of the Netziv (Meishiv Davar II § 9):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבעניני הנהגת הציבור לפעמים יש לנהוג עפ\"י הכלל דגדולה עבירה לשמה אך ורק בשני תנאים: א. שלא יהיה בזה שום נגיעה והנאה פרטית, וכמו שהקשו חז\"ל על יעל \"והא קמתהניא מעבירה\". ב. שיחשב שכר עבירה כנגד הפסדה והתועלת שתצמח מ\"עבירה לשמה\" תהיה גדולה מן ההפסד שבה</p>\n  \n  <p>Regarding guiding a community, sometimes they should be guided according to the principle of גדולה עבירה לשמה. [However], only under the following conditions: 1) There shouldn't be any bias or personal benefit, like <em>Chazal</em> asked about Yael, that she benefited from her transgression. 2) Calculate the benefit of the transgression against its loss. The outcome which will come from this עבירה לשמה should be greater than the loss.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While there are a lot of details here, I see none of the above cases applying to Chizkiya, which is why he was reprimanded by Yeshaya for breaking the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the book <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31446&st=&pgnum=1&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orchot Chaim (also called Keter Rosh)</a> R. Asher Ashkenazi collected stories/rulings/teachings from his teacher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_of_Volozhin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Chaim of Volozhin</a>, many of which in turn came from R. Chaim's teacher <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Elijah of Vilna</a>. One of the entries there (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31446&st=&pgnum=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#132</a>) is about the concept of <em>aveira lishma</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In short, he states that the concept does not really exist. Once we have the Torah we have to follow the Torah regardless of any other considerations. If <em>aveira lishma</em> was true then there would be no point of having <em>mitzvot</em> – everyone could just do whatever they wanted provided it was with good intentions.</p>\n\n<p>He says that that is for Jews who have the Torah. But for Noahides, or for Jews before the Torah was given, <em>aveira lishma</em> is a real consideration. For those people it is proper to serve God in whatever way they want (after the seven Noahide commandments), as long as they have good intentions.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Hezekiah acted incorrectly by not following the commandment to have kids, even though he was well-intentioned, because since the Torah had already been given he was obligated to follow it despite the other considerations.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the entry he discusses the case of Yael, where the Sages explicitly condoned the <em>aveira lishma</em>. He makes two points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Luria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Luria</a>, Yael was a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgul\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gilgul</a></em>.</li>\n<li>Yael was trying to save all of Israel.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>He concludes with a severe warning not to make comparisons to Yael's case.</p>\n\n<p>It thus seems that even though he at first denies that the concept of <em>aveira lishma</em> has any applicability to Jews after the giving of the Torah, there can perhaps be exceptions under very extraordinary circumstances, but we don't really have the right to invoke it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did the Ramchal have a beard?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems to be common knowledge that the Ramchal did not wear a beard (see <a href=\"https://onthemainline.blogspot.com/2011/01/beards-and-beardlessness-in-italian.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for instance). What sources are there, if any, that say the Ramchal, in fact, did not wear a beard?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Ramchal's beardless face is referenced in several letters among the Italian rabbinic communities of the 18th century, all of which are part of the general controversy that escalated after the Ramchal's assertion of learning through a <em>maggid</em> and his teachings of kabbalah, both activities that led some to suspect him of being a secret follower of Shabbetai Tzvi. The history of the anti-Sabbatean campaign that R. Moshe Hagiz and others waged against him is carefully related in Elisheva Carlebach's work <em>The Pursuit of Heresy.</em> </p>\n\n<p>R. Yeshayahu Bassan, one of the Ramchal's teachers, was one of the participants in the campaign, who became increasingly frustrated with his student. In 1730, after the Ramchal asked that he write to Hagiz in support, Bassan replied with his own worries, such as the fact that he was still single and the \"fact that you do not grow your beard\" (cf. Letter ר׳ משה חיים לוצאטו ובני־דורו #39). </p>\n\n<p>In another letter, R. Yosef Ergas wrote to R. Bassan about the issue of whether the Ramchal was a legitimate kabbalist. He wrote that he heard from others that while the Ramchal was learned in kabbalistic teachings, he did not consider him a <em>Hasid</em> [in the pre-Hassidic-Movement sense, meaning piousness], since: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושאלתי אותם אם הוא נשוי ואם הוא נזהר בטבילה של ע״ש ושלא לספר זקנו כלל אפילו במספרים - ועל כולם השיבוני שאינו מקיימם כלל</p>\n  \n  <p>I asked whether he was married and whether he was careful to immerse in the mikveh on erev Shabbat, and whether he was careful not to cut his beard even with scissors - and for each I was answered no. (Letter #21)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Carlebach found an amusing set of testimonies from the rabbanut in Venice in 1734, regarding students of the Ramchal who had claimed to have found \"a mirror with a black frame, a knife with a black handle, and a candle of black wax\" in his room, strange objects that some in the community feared was evidence of magical practices. After inquiring further, the rabbanut heard the Ramchal's explanation: they were the instruments of his shaving equipment (Carlebach 233).     </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The first source saying that Ramchal “did not let his beard grow” was his early teacher and later critic Rabbi Yosef Ergas.

In smaller than a nutshell, it depends how the husband knows this and if he believes it, if the husband was informed by his wife, the adulterer or someone else. Sometimes the husband is permitted to continue living with his wife, but in essence she is not allowed to live with him although a Beis Din (jewish court) may allow her.\nWithout going into any depth, a man is only forbidden to his wife if there are 2 witnesses or if he believes a single witness or his wife like 2 witnesses. He is not obligated to believe his wife if she says she committed adultery since it is possible she is lying and wants to re-marry, she only said this in order for him to be forced to divorce her. Additionally there is a תקנת רבינו גרשם which stipulates for Beis Din to force a man to stay married even if he believes her, for the reason just mentioned - otherwise any woman who wants a divorce will just tell her husband she committed adultery and then he would be forced to divorce her. This תקנה was initially implemented when the wife later reverts from her claim, however some poskim hold a man may rely on this תקנה and therefore the wife should not say anything to her husband, since he is not obligated to believe her and even if he would, he might not necessarily become forbidden to her.</p>\n<p>Just to cite a few-\nנודע ביהודה קמא עא, ותנינא  יב , כא</p>\n<p>חכם צבי ס' קנ</p>\n<p>מנחת שלמה ח\"ג ס' ק\"ב</p>\n<p>קובץ תשובות חלק ה ' ס' רטו'</p>\n<p>תשובות והנהגות</p>\n<p>There is also a major argument in the acharonim if the Beis Din encourages the woman or adulterer to inform the husband or not.

Thus two of them <strong>had</strong> to be moved to the other mountain.

Here\n  the nation is to separate into two halves to have the Levites in the\n  middle, so two of the eight have to be transferred to the other four.\n  Now, to avoid any appearance of difference of rank in the two halves\n  the tribes of the eldest and youngest of the sons of Leah, Reuben and\n  Zebulun were to join those of Bilha and Zilpa. Hence the grouping:-\n  Simon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph and Benjamin on the one side, and\n  Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali on the other. But also\n  to avoid the slightest appearance of the קללה being said over the\n  group of the בני השפחות, these were given their position just on Ebal\n  so that the קללה pronouncements were made not to seem to be directed at\n  them but to come from them. They were those that עומדים על הקללה and\n  from the side of the בני אמהות the ברכות were directed at them. (But\n  of course, as explained above both the blessing and curse were said as\n  coming from the whole twelve tribes I.L.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Neither system is more correct than the other; they are just serving different purposes.

If you're asking why Ancient Hebrew had a word that refers to both birds and bats, that's not a question about Jewish law, that's linguistic question. Languages develop categories according to what their speakers find pertinent. Presumably, ancient Hebrews found flight to be an issue more pertinent than whether something is a mammal.

Sherira Gaon</a>. The question posed to him was what one should do in a place where people don't wear tefillin. Specifically, is there a problem of <em>yuhara</em> if you wear tefillin when everyone else does not? The question was compounded with an additional factor, namely, that the person wearing tefillin might not be the most scrupulous of individuals in his other religious activity, thereby accentuating the <em>yuhara</em> by specifically doing the mitzvah that no one else is doing while not caring about the other mitzvot.</p>\n\n<p>R. Sherira's answer was pretty emphatic. He begins by saying that the concept of <em>yuhara</em> is applicable to something that is extra piety and not strict law. He then states simply that tefillin is a biblical commandment and there is no way to get out of it. You can't not fulfill a biblical commandment because of such concerns. Even if the person in question is a horrible Jew in general, it doesn't change the fact that he still has an obligation to wear tefillin. The fact that he doesn't fulfill other mitzvot is a shame, but has no halachic impact on his obligation to fulfill this mitzvah. R. Sherira added that if the person in question is a respected individual there is all the more reason for him to publicly wear tefillin so that the rest of the people will follow his example and start fulfilling the mitzvah, and for him not to do so would be a desecration of God's name.</p>\n\n<p>That said, R. Sherira noted that if the person in question really is a \"bad Jew\" then it could smack of <em>yuhara</em> that the one mitzvah he does is the one that no one else does. In such a case the person must still wear tefillin (as mentioned above, since it is a biblical obligation) but should do it in private so as not to demonstrate <em>yuhara</em>.</p>\n\n<p>From this responsum we can derive two important things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Certain halachic obligations (e.g. biblical commandments) completely override any concerns of <em>yuhara</em>.</li>\n<li>Even when halacha obligates you to do something, it doesn't necessarily make it not <em>yuhara</em>. You have to do it, but you also have to do whatever you can to eliminate the <em>yuhara</em> aspect (usually accomplished by doing it in private).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The responsum can be found in <em>Teshuvot U'Peirushei R. Sherira Gaon</em> 1:2, and with minor differences in <em>Teshuvot HaGeonim Im Teshuvot U'Pesakim Mei'Chachmei Provencia</em> §76.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the actual text of the

    "content": "# Anti-altering measures of the Oral Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Oral Torah was [presumably] forbidden to be written down.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Gemmorah clearly shows that even in a span of 100 years there were huge differences in recalling the Mishnaic formulas. For example \"מצוות הבן על האב / מצוות האב על הבן\" (Kiddushin), \"כסף קונה את הזהב / זהב קונה את הכסף\" (B\"M)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>What measures did Moses and the following leaders take to ensure the Mishnayot will not be altered for thousands of years</strong> (or at least until they will eventually be written down)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Surely phrases like ר׳ יהודה אומר weren’t around from back then. I understand the concept to mean that certain halachos were around from Moshe’s time and were passed down, generation to generation, until Rebbe, who then wrote down the Mishnayos. In the interests of keeping things brief, he would write certain halachos explicit, while others he would leave implicit (תנא __ אין מכלל ד__ לא). Some he still left in Braisos even after all that, hence R’ Chiya’s and R’ Oshaya’s job of compiling the Tosefta. Sometimes Rebbe would couch two seemingly disparate halachos together, such as reading the Shema when the Kohanim Tevulei Yom could eat Terumah. </p>\n\n<p>Now, that begs the question still: even if the precise words might have changed over time, how did they ensure that the Halacha wasn’t garbled? This is one of the most common questions on the concept of Mesorah. Have you ever played telephone? The phrase that’s put into the chain is never the same one that the last guy hears. </p>\n\n<p>Well, that’s not quite an accurate metaphor for how it actually went down. Let’s play telephone again, but after the second guy says his piece, the first guy gets a chance to say, “Hold on a second, that’s not right.”</p>\n\n<p>The following is from Eruvin 54b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר כיצד סדר משנה משה למד מפי הגבורה נכנס אהרן ושנה לו משה פירקו נסתלק אהרן וישב לשמאל משה נכנסו בניו ושנה להן משה פירקן נסתלקו בניו אלעזר ישב לימין משה ואיתמר לשמאל אהרן רבי יהודה אומר לעולם אהרן לימין משה חוזר נכנסו זקנים ושנה להן משה פירקן נסתלקו זקנים נכנסו כל העם ושנה להן משה פירקן נמצאו ביד אהרן ארבעה ביד בניו שלשה וביד הזקנים שנים וביד כל העם אחד</p>\n  \n  <p>The Gemara continues to discuss methods of Torah study. The Sages taught the following baraita: What was the order of teaching the Oral Law? How was the Oral Law first taught? Moses learned directly from the mouth of the Almighty. Aaron entered and sat before him, and Moses taught him his lesson as he had learned it from God. Aaron moved aside and sat to the left of Moses. Aaron’s sons entered, and Moses taught them their lesson while Aaron listened. Aaron’s sons moved aside; Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar sat to the left of Aaron. Rabbi Yehuda disagreed with the first tanna with regard to the seating arrangements and said: Actually, Aaron would return to sit to the right of Moses. The elders entered and Moses taught them their lesson. The elders moved aside, and the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their lesson. Therefore, Aaron had heard the lesson four times, his sons heard it three times, the elders heard it twice, and the entire nation heard it once.\n  נסתלק משה ושנה להן אהרן פירקו נסתלק אהרן שנו להן בניו פירקן נסתלקו בניו שנו להן זקנים פירקן נמצא ביד הכל ארבעה</p>\n  \n  <p>Moses then departed to his tent, and Aaron taught the others his lesson as he had learned it from Moses. Aaron then departed and his sons taught the others their lesson. His sons then departed and the elders taught the rest of the people their lesson. Hence everyone, Aaron, his sons, the elders and all the people, heard the lesson taught by God four times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now everyone knows the same halachos as everyone else. From this point on, the Oral Law and the Written Law are no different - if someone tries to change the Halacha, or if he does so unintentionally, he has millions of people contradicting him. </p>\n\n<p>It’s not a perfect system. Things will still change over time. But it’s the best system possible. </p>\n\n<p>What other options are there? Each person make it up as they go? You’ll get several different “authentic” Judaisms very quickly. Passing down the Oral Law through a centralized body which everyone obeys is the best way possible. You’re correct that it’s not 100% foolproof, but that’s only going to happen if prophecy were to have continued to the present day and beyond. </p>\n\n\n",

How do Jews interpret Psalms 45:9: “At thy right hand doth stand the queen (shegal) in gold of Ophir,” a verse used by Christians in support of Mary being made the Queen-Mother by Jesus in Catholic thought?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This verse is interpreted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud</a> in the midst of a broader discussion about a certain king going bad. The part that is relevant to the interpretation of this verse is excerpted below, first in the original Hebrew and followed by the English translation, with the sentences that directly interpret the verse in bold:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=9&daf=4&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 4a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב יוסף ואיתימא רבי יצחק מנלן דאחמיץ מהכא ויאמר לי המלך והשגל\n  יושבת אצלו מאי שגל אמר רבה בר לימא משמיה דרב כלבתא אלא מעתה הא דכתיב\n  ועל מרא שמיא התרוממת ולמאנייא די ביתיה היתיו קדמך ואנת ורברבניך שגלתך\n  ולחנתך חמרא שתין בהון ואי שגל כלבתא היא כלבתא בת משתיא חמרא היא הא לא\n  קשיא דמלפא לה ושתייא <strong>אלא מעתה דכתיב בנות מלכים ביקרותיך נצבה שגל\n  לימינך בכתם אופיר ואי שגל כלבתא היא מאי קא מבשר להו נביא לישראל הכי\n  קאמר בשכר שחביבה תורה לישראל כשגל לעובדי כוכבים זכיתם לכתם אופיר</strong>\n  ואיבע\"א לעולם שגל מלכתא היא ורבה בר לימא גמרא גמיר לה ואמאי קרי לה שגל\n  שהיתה חביבה עליו כשגל אי נמי שהושיבה במקום שגל</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Joseph, (or, as some say, R. Isaac) said: Whence do we know that he\n  deteriorated? From here: And the king said unto me, the shegal also\n  sitting by him. What is ‘shegal’? Rabbah b. Lema said In the name of\n  Rab, a she-dog. But if that is so, what are we to make of the verse,\n  But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven, and they have\n  brought the vessels of His house before thee, and thou and thy lords,\n  thy shegaloth and thy concubines have drunk wine in them. Now how can\n  ‘shegal’ here be a dog? Do dogs drink wine? — This is no difficulty,\n  as [we can suppose that] it was taught to drink. <strong>But what of the\n  verse where it is written, Kings’ daughters are among thy favourites,\n  at thy right hand doth stand the shegal in gold of Ophir? Now if\n  ‘shegal’ is a dog, what promise is the prophet bringing to Israel? —\n  What he means is this: Because the Torah is as dear to Israel as a\n  ‘shegal’ to the heathens, you have earned as your reward the gold of\n  Ophir.</strong> Alternatively I may say that ‘shegal’ does as a rule mean\n  ‘queen’, but in this case Rabbah b. Lema had a tradition [that it\n  means ‘dog’], and the reason why [in the text] it is called ‘shegal’\n  is because it was as dear to him as a queen; or, possibly, because he\n  put it on the queen's seat. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Rosh_HaShanah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Aramaic translation (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum#Targum_Ketuvim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum</a>) translates the word \"shegal\" as Oraisa (אורייתא) which is the Aramaic word for Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The messiah will be born from a Jewish woman but no he will not make his mother queen or give her any titles or powers. Besides being his mother when he is young she will have no other role in the messianic era. The idea of giving the mother of the messiah any titles or special roles or powers is a completely christian concept. As a matter of fact Judaism never mentions the mother of the messiah other than being the person who will give birth to him. </p>\n\n<p>Many Christians project their ideas of Jesus onto the Psalms so for them it would seem as though the psalm is referring to Jesus or some other person. This Psalm like other pslams were written by composers in the time of David and were more than likely referring to him. So when this psalms says \"Daughters of kings are among your honored women;at your right hand is the royal bride in gold of Ophir\" it means what it says at face value that among the many honored women of David are the daughters of kings from David's time and that the royal bride of David is adorned with gold from Ophir. Also notice that this Psalm never even mentions anybody's mother. </p>\n\n\n",

The famous Rabbi Akiva is noted for saying, “a safety fence for wisdom is silence” (Pirkei Avot/Ethics of the Fathers 3:13). Elsewhere in the Talmud it is written, “the best medicine of all is silence. When Rabbi Dimi came, he said: ‘In the west they say a word is worth a sela, silence two selas” (Talmud Megillah 18a).</p>\n\n<p>By extolling the merits of silence, the sages were not trying to hush a gathering of noisy, rambunctious youth. Rather they were discussing a character trait.  Jews may joke, Jews may debate, and Jews may even argue, but Judaism places tremendous importance on peace. Knowing when to refrain from speaking is often the best way to maintain peace. Whether this means refraining from gossip, holding back a sharp retort or not trying to prove that one person knows better than another, shtika is the silence of self-discipline. That is why the recommended remedy to employ when one finds oneself about to say something one shouldn’t, is to tell oneself Sheket...Bevakasha.</p>\n\n<p>(nice text from <a href=\"http://www.jewishtreats.org/2016/09/sheketbevakasha.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jewishtreats.org/2016/09/sheketbevakasha.html</a> )</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Well, if you THINK you CAN hurt a person by saying 'shut up', so of course you cannot say to this person 'shut up', because of the probability to hurt someone's feeling (even worse if more people seeing).</p>\n\n<p>A more lenient way of think is to think 'this person won't be hurted' (if a friend or something else), but we have to remember that there are people watching us and it is not a polite way to talk with a fellow person, can you see a great rabbi like Shalom Arush or Rav Kaduri (blessed his memory) saying 'shut up' to someone?!</p>\n\n<p>Even if this person is saying something you strong disagree, you have more polite ways to talk, or even better, say to yourself: 'Sheket...Bevakasha'.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would say it depends on who started.. Just to say shut up' to someone is hurtful and is prohibited (אונאת דברים), but if he told you first something not nice it would be permitted to answer him back, and the source to this is in the Sefer Hachinuch Mitzva 338... (from sefaria)</p>\n<p>ואולם לפי הדומה, אין במשמע שאם בא ישראל אחד והתחיל והרשיע לצער חבירו בדבריו הרעים שלא יענהו השומע, שאי אפשר להיות האדם כאבן שאין לה הופכים, ועוד, שיהיה בשתיקתו כמודה על החרופין. ובאמת, לא תצוה התורה להיות האדם כאבן, שותק למחרפיו כמו למברכיו, אבל תצוה אותנו שנתרחק מן המדה הזאת ושלא נתחיל להתקוטט ולחרף בני אדם, ובכן ינצל כל אדם מכל זה, כי מי שאינו בעל קטטה לא יחרפוהו בני אדם, זולתי השוטים הגמורים, ואין לתת לב על השוטים. ואם אולי יכריחנו מחרף מבני אדם להשיב על דבריו ראוי לחכם שישיב לו דרך סלסול ונעימות ולא יכעס הרבה כי כעס בחיק כסילים ינוח (קהלת ז ט). וינצל עצמו אל השומעים מחרופיו וישליך המשא על המחרף, זהו דרך הטובים שבבני אדם. ויש לנו ללמד דבר זה שמתר לנו לענות כסיל לפי הדומה מאשר התירה התורה הבא במחתרת להקדים ולהרגו (שמות כב א), שאין ספק שלא נתחיב האדם לסבל הנזקים מיד חבירו, כי יש לו רשות להנצל מידו וכמו כן מדברי פיהו אשר מלא מרמות ותוך, בכל דבר שהוא יכול להנצל ממנו. ואולם יש כת מבני אדם שעולה חסידותם כל כך שלא ירצו להכניס עצמם בהוראה זו להשיב חורפיהם דבר, פן יגבר עליהם הכעס ויתפשטו בענין זה יותר מדאי, ועליהם אמרו זכרונם לברכה (שבת פח, ב) הנעלבין ואינם עולבים, שומעין חרפתם ואינם משיבין עליהם הכתוב אומר (שופטים ה לא) ואוהביו כצאת השמש בגבורתו.</p>\n<p>However according to what it seems, it is not understood that if an Israelite came and began to be wicked to pain his fellow with his bad words, that the listener should not answer him. For it is not possible for a man to be 'like a stone that cannot be overturned' - moreover, that he will be in his silence like one who concedes to the insults. And in truth, the Torah did not command for a man to be like a stone, silent to those who insult him and to those who bless him alike. Rather it commands us to distance ourselves from this trait and that we should not begin to quarrel and insult people. And like this, every man will be saved from all this - since one who doesn't quarrel will not be insulted by people, except for [by] complete fools; and we should not pay attention to fools. And if perhaps some insulting person will force him to answer his words, it is fitting for a wise person to reply to him in a roundabout and pleasant way, and not become  very angry; as 'anger rests on the bosom of fools.' And he will [so] save himself before those who listen to his insults, and he will cast the burden upon the one who insults [him]; and this is the way of the best among men. And we should learn this thing - that it is permitted to us to reply to a fool - according to what it seems from how the Torah permitted one who comes to rob secretly to be preceded and killed (Exodus 22:1). As there is no doubt that a man is not obligated to bear harm from his fellow; as he has permission to save himself from his hand - and similarly from the words of his mouth that are full of deceit and cunning - with anything that he is able to save himself from him. However there is a group of people the righteousness of which rises so much that they do not want to include themselves in this teaching - to reply something to those that insult them, lest anger will overpower them and they become involved in the matter more than is necessary. And about them they, may their memory be blessed, said (Shabbat 88b), \"Those who are humiliated but do not humiliate [back], who hear their insult and do not reply - about them the verse states (Judges 5:31), 'but those who love Him are like the sun coming out in its strength.'\"</p>\n<p>A great source in the Talmud for this (I've seen in a sefer from R' Yaakov Chaim Sofer), is a Gemara Beitza 20b</p>\n<p>אָמַר אַבָּיֵי: הִלְכָּךְ, הַאי צוּרְבָּא מֵרַבָּנַן דְּאָמַר לֵיהּ חַבְרֵיהּ מִלְּתָא, לָא לַהְדַּר לֵיהּ מִלְּתָא טְפֵי מִמַּאי דַּאֲמַר לֵיהּ חַבְרֵיהּ, דְּאִיהוּ אָמַר לֵיהּ: ״מָה זוֹ סְמִיכָה״, וְקָא מַהְדַּר לֵיהּ: ״מָה זוֹ שְׁתִיקָה״.</p>\n<p>Abaye said: Therefore, it is clear from here that a Torah scholar whose colleague says something reprimanding or insulting to him should not answer back with something more than his colleague had said to him, to avoid adding fuel to the fire, as in the above story the one said to the other: What is this placing of hands? and the latter responded to the former using the same language: What is this silence?</p>\n<p>What emerges is that one may only answer as rude and harsh as his friend initiated but not more then that... To that point I will add the Gemara Kesubos 45b</p>\n<p>אֲמַר לֵיהּ: רַחֲמָנָא נַיצְּלַן מֵהַאי דַּעְתָּא: אַדְּרַבָּה, רַחֲמָנָא נַיצְּלַן מִדַּעְתָּא דִּידָךְ</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ile’a said to him: May the Merciful One save us from following this opinion, as your argument is illogical.

    "content": "# Dreams of a bible in another language\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Good morning,\nThank you for taking the time to read this. I’m not Jewish. I grew up in a Pentecostal Church but as a child I had a dream in which I walked into a beautiful cathedral only to have everything in it become twisted and demonic including the pictures within a large beautiful bible. In the dream I ran out of the Church only to get trapped between an evil horde of demons and a ledge dropping into a river of fire. In the dreams I decided to jump into the fire rather than allow myself to be caught by the horde. As I fell towards the fire I was caught up by an open book which had writing I did not understand and seemed to be written in Hebrew. To this day the dreams still haunts me more than any nightmare I’ve ever had. At one point I thought of speaking to a rabbi and considered a change in religion. Looking for a different opinion. Any help is great appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Good Evening, </p>\n\n<p>I will answer your OP to the best of my ability according to what I think you are asking. Please feel free to edit your question by borrowing my wording.</p>\n\n<p><strong>1) Should a person consider making an important life decision, based upon a message or feeling in a dream? What is the Jewish outlook on this?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Jewish tradition on dream interpretation says three things that may be of interest to you:</p>\n\n<p>a) People tend to dream about things they thought of when they were awake.</p>\n\n<p>b) Every dream has a measure of nonesense within it.</p>\n\n<p>c) A dream can be a lower level kind of prophecy. It may be a message to you from your Creator to help you understand something.</p>\n\n<p>These statements are to be found in the Talmud (Brachos: ch. 9 )</p>\n\n<p>So, just because you have a dream, and even if a dream might be a message from Above for you; it is still not a basis for doing something like converting to a certain religion.</p>\n\n<p>After all, a child's nightmare will contain nonesense, and may be the result of a day's worry which manifests in the form of familiar scenes in the child's mind from his or her cultural upbringing. </p>\n\n<p>Practical life choices must be decided by reason and sincerity coupled with prayer and proper guidance. </p>\n\n<p>But what if it is also a Divine message? Well, you can settle the agitation of your soul, by investigating a) Your current religion and b) Judaism, with an open mind, to see if you should consider making any changes.</p>\n\n<p>Specific to the details in the dream you provided, the message <strong><em>may be</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The current Church you are in and the people running it, are not giving you the best view of life. Examining the roots of your beliefs (by seeking out the Jewish sources for the Bible you accept) will bear fruit.</p>\n\n<p>But in the end, use your G-d given talent and reason to be sincere, and investigate the truth. When you are convinced that a certain path is the fear of Heaven, then follow it, regardless of (or instead of) simply relying upon a perceived message in a dream. Even if the dream helped you to look, only rely in the end upon true reason when making a life choice.</p>\n\n<p>As the verse says in Eccl. 5:6 (5:7 in Christian Bibles) \"Even in the midst of <strong>dreams</strong>, futility, and many words (many things), fear G-d!\"</p>\n\n\n",

Who uses which?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Nusach Sefaradi is an overarching name (much like the term \"Sefaradi\") of the Nusach used by Jews who follow Minhagei Sefarad (Spain) and Edot haMizrach. This is an oversimplification, but the intricacies of the differences between different Sefaradi/Mizrachi customs could fill volumes.</p>\n\n<p>Nusach Sfard/Sefarad is the Nusach used by many/most(?) Chassidim, with the notable exception of Chabad. The Nusach which Chabad uses is very similar to Nusach Sfard, which is because (from my understanding) both Nusachim come from the Nusach that the Arizal used. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The nusach used by Jews of Sephardic extraction (meaning either Jews who live in Spain and Portugal, or are descended from those who were expelled from those places in 1492) is called \"Nusach Sepharadi\". This term has been (incorrectly) used to describe the nusach of those of the Edot Hamizrach (Jews from Iran, Syria, Egypt, Israel, and so on). It would be more correct to refer to the nusach of Spain/Portugal as \"Nusach Sepharadi\" and the nusach of other Sephardic communites as \"Nusach Edot Hamizrach\", and truth be told this is how it is today in the world of siddurim. </p>\n\n<p>However, Nusach Sefard is an Ashkenazi nusach, formed by the Chasidim in 19th Century Europe. It was developed to blend the traditional Nusach Ashkenaz with the writings of the Arizal. It is best described as a cross-breed between Nusach Ashkenaz and Edot Hamizrach. </p>\n\n<p>The reason it too is called \"Sefard\" is because the other non-Chasidic communities in Eastern Europe recognized the new nusach's \"Sephardic flavor\" and therefore began calling the new siddurim \"Sefard\". However it is important to note that any siddur marked \"Sefard\" is indeed a Chasidic prayer book. </p>\n\n<p>(There are many variations of the Chasidic siddur, too, the Chabad siddur being one of them.)</p>\n\n\n",

Why was the \"Israeli Mishnah\" accepted unanimously even though the Israeli Rabbis were not trusted so much in Babylon?</p>\n<p><em>Bonus wonder: how would the Bavli Mishnah be different from R' Yehudah's?</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think the simplest reason why is because of the influence of Rav and Shemu'el. Most of the Babylonian amora'im can be traced back to them somehow through their students. Having learned personally from Rabbi Yehuda Hannasi, they would have wanted to continue teaching as they learned, through the mishnayot of the land of Israel. Their influence is clear from the fact that later generations were apparently more familiar with their disputes than with certain parts of the Mishnah itself (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=20&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 20a</a>). <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 30a</a> is another case in which Shemu'el is influential in an actual case deciding the law for pot-sellers. The fact that Rav and Shemu'el, unlike the Resh Galuta, were actually going and teaching people, is probably the biggest reason for the Mishnah, particularly that of Rabbi Yehuda Hannasi, to have become the code of law for Babylonian Jews.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question of how the Babylonian Mishnah would be different from the Mishnah we have: The Mishnah already leans Babylonian. The Mishnah already has a strong preference for the opinions of the school of Hillel the Babylonian (as he is called in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=66&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 66a</a>) over those of the school of Shammai (see for example <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 1:3</a>). (This is probably another reason why it wouldn't have been hard for Babylonians to accept it.)</p>\n<p>There are Babylonian rabbis who aren't quoted in the Mishnah we have, but whom we do know from baraytot (e.g. Rabbi Yehuda ben Betera, who lived in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nusaybin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nisibis</a> according to <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=3b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 3b</a>). I don't know whether they had a set of teachings based on something like the Mishnah Rishonah (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%92_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 3:4</a>) that Rabbi Akiva or Rabbi Yehuda Hannasi worked from, or whether they had only the unconnected teachings that we have attributed to them in baraytot. A Babylonian version of the Mishnah would probably have included more of these people as tanna'im. In any case, these tanna'im did make it into the final law by way of the baraytot, so they weren't forgotten despite not having made it into the Mishnah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Because in Issur VeHetter, the Sanhedrin in Eretz Yisrael had authority over the Reish Galusa.</p>\n<p>The Gemara says in Pesachim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.51a.10?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">51a</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורבה בר בר חנה לית ליה הא דתנן נותנין עליו חומרי המקום שיצא משם וחומרי המקום שהלך לשם אמר אביי הני מילי מבבל לבבל ומארץ ישראל לא\"י אי נמי מבבל לא\"י אבל מא\"י לבבל לא כיון דאנן כייפינן להו עבדינן כוותייהו</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: And is Rabba bar bar Ḥana, who was lenient with regard to a matter that is prohibited, not in agreement with that which we learned in the mishna: When one travels from one place to another, the Sages impose upon him the stringencies of the place from which he left and the stringencies of the place to which he went? Abaye said: That applies when one travels from one place in Babylonia to another place in Babylonia, or from one place in Eretz Yisrael to another place in Eretz Yisrael, or alternatively, from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael. <strong>However, when traveling from Eretz Yisrael to Babylonia, no, this principle does not apply.

I recommend at least flicking through them to get a basic understanding of the whole process of the creation of the mishna.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This question seems to come out of a misunderstanding of the process of the creation of the mishna, or to be more specific, what made Rebbi's mishna \"<strong>The</strong> Mishna\". Typically, Jews are taught that Rebbi used his resources to collect all of the teachings of all of the sages, proceeded to edit them together, and thus, The Mishna was formed. However, proper analysis of Tannaic, Amoraic and later sources shows us that the story was much more complicated than that. In truth, Rebbi was not the first person to create a mishna, i.e., a compilation of discussions of halachot. There are traditions that there were ancient mishnas in the far past. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chagigah.14a.8-9?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 14a</a>, in Yeshayahu's time there were 600 or 700 sidrei mishna. Machzor Vitrei <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Machzor_Vitry%2C_Pirkei_Avot.1.18.8?vhe=Machzor_Vitry,_Berlin,_1893-97&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> this same number as having existed from Moshe's time until Hillel.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.42.2?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on the Torah 42:2</a>, before Metushelach there were 900 sidrei mishna.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Then we have a trace of a tradition that there was some sort of mishna from the time of the Chashmonaim, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epiphanius_of_Salamis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Epiphanius</a>, a Jew who converted to Christianity, wrote in his book Panarion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Scribes had four 'repetitions.' [=this word is typically understood to mean \"mishna\"] One was in circulation in the name of the prophet Moses, a second in that of their teacher called Aqiba or Bar Aqiba, another in the name Addan or Annan, also called Judas, and <strong>another in the name of the sons of Hasmonaeus</strong>.\"​</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that besides for referring either to Sefer Devarim, AKA Mishneh Torah or to some of the traditions of mishnas from the time of Moshe, he also mentions The Mishna authored by Rebbi, as well as a fourth: A mishna by Rabbi Akiva. There is much evidence for Rabbi Akiva's mishna. Just a few examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eichah_Rabbah%2C_Petichta.23?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah Petichta 23</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kohelet_Rabbah.6.2.1?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabbah 6:2</a> mention the mishna of Rabbi Akiva.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Sanhedrin.3.4?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 3:4</a> it is stated by Rabbi Yosei that this mishna is Rabbi Akiva's mishna.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.19a.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 19a</a> it is stated that a braita is from Rabbi Akiva's mishna.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so forth. We also find evidence of mishnas by other Tannaim. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Zevachim.2.4?vhe=Tosefta_Zevachim_-_Machon_Mamre&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Zevachim 2:4</a> mentions Rabbi Eliezer's mishna.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bekhorot.30b.13?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechorot 30b</a> mentions a mishna taught by the unnamed son of Rabbi Chaninah ben Antignos.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Niddah.25b.14?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 25b</a> mentions a mishna taught by Rabbi Nechunyah.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The long and short of everything is that mishnas were being compiled long before Rebbi. As <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99_%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%96%D7%9F-%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishai Rosen-Tzvi</a> put it (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Scholars are in agreement that at least from the time of Rabbi Akiva and onwards there are not only traditions but also organized mishnas, that later became the building blocks of our mishna.\" (בין משנה למדרש - קריאה בספרות התנאים, pg. 86)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mostly, mishnaic compilations were created by the Tannaim to organize all of the halachic discussions from their time and back, to be able to pass these on to later generations in an orderly manner. Rebbi, however, had another reason for creating his compilation. As Rambam put it (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law?vhe=Wikisource_Mishneh_Torah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to Mishneh Torah</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But why did our Holy Master thus, and did not leave the matter as it was heretofore? Because he observed that the number of students continued to decrease, whereas the volume of oppression continued to increase with renewed strength; that the Roman Empire continued to spread out its boundaries in the world and conquer, whereas Israel continued to drift aimlessly and follow extremes, he, therefore, compiled one book, a handy volume for all, so that they may study it even in haste and not forget it. And his whole lifetime, he sat together with the members of his tribunal and gave public instruction in the Mishna.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Was Rebbi planning for his mishna to be the final word on mishnaic compilations? Probably not (particularly considering that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shir_HaShirim_Rabbah.8.2.1?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his students had their own mishnas</a>). But he felt that a new one was necessary for his generation. Recall, Rebbi was born in the waning days of the Bar Kochva Revolt (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.72b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 72b</a>), which led to the exile really starting. A new compilation was needed. Rebbi merited to have his mishna be of such supreme quality, that it became popular very fast and eventually, became known as <strong>The</strong> Mishna. As <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Albeck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chanoch Albeck</a> put it (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Immediately after Rebbi organized a mishnaic compilation of teachings from many batei midrashot and didn't yet finish his holy work, his mishna spread out among the students and became accepted in all of the settlements of Yisrael.\" (מבוא למשנה, pg. 110)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Babylonian mishnas:</strong></p>\n<p>Having explained that other Tannaim created mishnaic compilations, we now turn to the subject of Babylonian Tannaim and their mishnas. Yes, there were mishnas created by the Babylonians. Most notably, Rabbi Natan's mishna, but there is evidence for others:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tehillim.104.15?vhe=OYW&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim 104:15</a> mentions masechtot of Rabbanan Bavlai, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.33.3?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 33:3</a> mentions hilchata of Bavlai and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Bava_Batra.13b.2?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Bava Batra 13b</a> brings a halacha in the name of Rabban Bavlai. So was the differentiation between the mishna of Eretz Yisrael and that of Babylon that at one point Rabbi Natan said to Rebbi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.131a.3?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 131a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>You</strong> taught in <strong>your</strong> Mishna...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You - of Eretz Yisrael - taught in your mishna - the mishna of Eretz Yisrael. Likewise, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Epistle_of_Rav_Sherira_Gaon.1.44?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> Rav Shrira Gaon in his Iggeret (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And in the time of Rebbi and afterwards there was the Mishna of the Babylonians, which was called in Eretz Yisrael \"the Mishna of Rabbi Natan\".\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Explicit mention of his mishna can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Temurah.16a.17?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&qh=%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%AA%20%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Temurah 16a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ketubot.93a.16?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%AA%20%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 93a</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.27.1?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&qh=%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%AA%20%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 27:1</a>. Interestingly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HeArukh%2C_Letter_Kof.271?vhe=Sefer_HeArukh,_Lublin_1883&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">according</a> to the Aruch, Rabbi Natan was the son of the Reish Galuta, so <em>technically</em>, his mishna was probably at the behest of the Reish Galuta.</p>\n<p>As stated above, the reason that Rabbi Natan's mishna was \"overtaken\" by Rebbi's was because Rebbi's was of such good quality both in terms of the content (the great mass of various Tannaic halachic traditions brought) and in terms of editing style, that it became the most popular of compilations.</p>\n<p><strong>What was a Babylonian Mishna like?</strong></p>\n<p>There are two possible answers to this question:</p>\n<p><strong>The first possibility</strong> - There are some traces of Rabbi Natan's mishna that can be found in our sources. To get a sense of what a Babylonian mishna was like, look no further than some of Rabbi Natan's teachings. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Recounting older disputes: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.62a.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 62b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Kiddushin.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Kiddushin 4:1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ketubot.52a.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 52a</a>, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Historical traditions: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zevachim.61b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 61b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Arakhin.2.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Arachin 2:3</a>, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Amoraic references to his mishna as \"משנה יחידאה\": <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sukkah.19b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 19b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.79b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 79b</a>, etc.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The author of Sifrei Zuta, probably a student or students of Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov, also used the mishna of Rabbi Natan in the midrash. Epstein has a detailed explanation which I won't get into now because this answer is already long.</p>\n<p>In short, Rabbi Natan's mishna - or any other mishna of a Babylonian Tanna - differed from Rebbi in the views presented there and/or in historical traditions brought there that were perhaps unknown to Rebbi, or he did not think were necessary to be included in his mishna.</p>\n<p><strong>The second possibility</strong> - From the second and third generations of the Amoraim, we find textual differences between the mishnas repeated by the Babylonians and those repeated by the Eretz-Yisraelians. Well aware that the Yisraeli version was superior, we find that the Babylonians commonly asked their Yisraeli counterparts what was the original way the mishna was taught. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.110a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 110a</a>:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When Rabbi Elazar ascended from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael he found Ze’eiri and said to him: Is there a tanna who taught Rav that an udder roasted without first being torn is prohibited? Ze’eiri showed him Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi. Rav Yitzḥak bar Avudimi said to Rabbi Elazar: I did not teach Rav that an udder is prohibited at all; rather, Rav found an unguarded valley and fenced it in.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.137b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 137b</a>:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When Isi bar Hini ascended from Babylonia to Eretz Yisrael, Rabbi Yoḥanan found him teaching the mishna to his son. Isi taught that the obligation of the first sheared wool applies only in the case of sheep [reḥelim], the masculine plural form of raḥel, meaning a sheep. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Isi: You should teach him using the term reḥelot, the feminine plural form. Isi said to him in reply: I teach the mishna in accordance with that which is written: “Two hundred reḥelim”...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, in general, disputes between the Bavli and the Yerushalmi around the views of different Tannaim (i.e., what each Tanna really said) is taken as evidence that the Babylonians had a different mishna in the name of each Tanna. For example, compare Rashbi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.51b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachaim 51</a> to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.6b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Berachot 6b</a>.</p>\n<p>In short, the mishna of Rebbi was preserved differently by the Babylonians than how it was preserved by the Eretz-Yisraelians. This leads to textual differences - sometimes minute differences in phrasing and sometimes major disputes between the views of the Tannaim.</p>\n\n\n",

I see from earlier questions that Shabbat is not to be kept by non-Jews. What then does “stranger” mean in the commandments to keep the Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>In Genesis 2, the Lord ceases from His creative work and sanctifies that holy time, forever. Doesn't this apply to all mankind/strangers?</p>\n\n<p>P.S. Please answer as you wish but I will be especially grateful for answers that speak from the Tanakh. </p>\n\n<p>__________My thoughts below, if allowed by forum rules___________</p>\n\n<p>This breathtaking \"act\" makes holy this day forever--He doesn't close by saying, the evening and the morning were the seventh day--indicating to me that this Shabbat is universal and unending. Because of this, I, like others, believe the Shabbat is given to all mankind--(there are some 140 languages, ancient and modern that use the word Sabbath for the seventh day) that they should walk in it (potentially bringing them to the One True God and His ways). I don't believe anyone can make unholy that which God has made holy. To bring righteousness to all mankind, which is what the children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob are instructed to do (Deut 4), wouldn't this be the starting point, time is everywhere and everyone lives within time--the \"holy of the Lord--the Shabbat is something everyone lives through whether they, unfortunately, are ignorant of it.</p>\n\n<p>For context: My family keeps Shabbat; we are not Jewish. We spend 24 hours (sunset to sunset) in the study of the Scriptures and in worship. We do not cook, transact business, work, do housework, travel or discuss anything but the Lord and His Word. It is a time of \"not doing our pleasure on His holy day\", \"not doing out own ways, nor finding our own pleasures, nor speaking our own words\" but calling the Shabbat \"a delight\", \"the holy of the Lord\", \"honorable\" and honoring Him (Isaiah 58:13)</p>\n\n<p>I understand this can be a sensitive issue, and I do not mean to offend.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The 7th day Sabbath which began at Creation (Genesis 2:3) has NO instructions for mankind.</p>\n\n<p>It merely notes that God sanctified and blessed a specific day. </p>\n\n<p>Did man even know about it? </p>\n\n<p>Was man commanded to observe the Sabbath in a prescribed manner?</p>\n\n<p>There is no Biblical evidence that God gave the whole world the Sabbath, nor do we find any verse indicating that man observed the Sabbath prior to the Exodus. </p>\n\n<p>Why doesn't the Bible mention anything about Adam, Enoch, or Noah observing the Sabbath prior to the Exodus?</p>\n\n<p>The first time that we find in Scripture that man was commanded to observe the Sabbath, was post Exodus (Exodus 16), when God gave the Sabbath as a gift to the Children of Israel. </p>\n\n<p>Moreover, the verse (16:29) indicates that God GAVE the Sabbath to the Israelites. First of all, it had to be \"given\", i.e. it wasn't \"theirs\" until then. Second, it was given to the Israelites. No one else.</p>\n\n<p>This was followed at Sinai, where the Sabbath commandment is included in the Decalogue.</p>\n\n<p>Exodus 31:16-17</p>\n\n<ol start=\"16\">\n<li><p>Thus shall the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL observe the Sabbath, to make the Sabbath throughout their generations as an everlasting covenant.</p></li>\n<li><p>Between Me and the CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, it is forever a sign...</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>As a gentile, if you want to remember the 7th day of creation, go can out to a bar and enjoy a cold beer, in honor of the Sabbath. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to praise God for the Sabbath, sing a Psalm in the bar, or whatever else floats your boat.</p>\n\n<p>Scripture cannot contradict itself. As per Exodus 31, the Sabbath is a private Covenant between God and the Children of Israel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You would prefer answers based only on the written Torah. We believe that the Torah consists of two parts: the written and the oral Torah. (For further information see <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/812102/jewish/What-is-the-Oral-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this short article</a>). </p>\n\n<p>This answer starts from an Oral Torah source which bases itself on the written Torah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Background</strong>.  גר can have two meanings in Torah. </p>\n\n<p>1] A ger toshav is a gentile who accepts the authority of the Torah and the rabbis upon himself, but specifically as applied to gentiles. </p>\n\n<p>2] A ger tzedek refers to a \"righteous convert\", a proselyte to Judaism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question here</strong> is which sort of ger is referred to in the quoted texts. </p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Tzvi_Mecklenburg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesav veHakabbalah</a> quotes a Mekhilta {for what that is see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mekhilta_of_Rabbi_Ishmael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>} which says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וגרך. זה גר צדק או אינו אלא גר תושב כשהוא אומר (וינפש בן אמתך) והגר,\n  הרי גר תושב אמור, הא מה ת\"ל וגרך זה גר צדק </p>\n  \n  <p>The word וגרך refers to a righteous convert. Or could it  be that it\n  means the righteous gentile? The Torah also says in regards to Shabbat\n  “and the son of the maidservant and the גר will rest” that must mean\n  the  convert rests on Shabbat – not the  righteous gentile .</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that the “stranger” referred to in the two texts is in fact a convert to Judaism and not a non-Jew (any longer!). </p>\n\n<p>There are other places where the Torah speaks about the  righteous convert and obliges him in mitzvos like any other Jew, for example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exodus 12 (48) </p>\n  \n  <p>If a stranger who dwells with you would offer the passover to the\n  LORD, all his males must be circumcised; then he shall be admitted to\n  offer it; he shall then be as a citizen of the country. But no\n  uncircumcised person may eat of it. </p>\n  \n  <p>Numbers 9 (14)</p>\n  \n  <p>And when a stranger who resides with you would offer a passover\n  sacrifice to the LORD, he must offer it in accordance with the rules\n  and rites of the passover sacrifice. There shall be one law for you,\n  whether stranger or citizen of the country.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thus, from a strictly practical standpoint, halacha takes precedence.) Consider that \"derekh eretz\" is defined by the Maharal <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/111660\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as Pirkei Avos</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Kamenetsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Kamenetzky</a> explains this Midrash in his commentary to Parshat Lech Lecha, and he cites it as \"derech eretz kadma laTorah\". He discusses there why Avraham had to go rescue Lot. He writes that according to the laws of the Torah, Avraham would have been exempt because the Torah does not demand that someone put himself in potential danger in order to save someone else. Avraham went to save Lot anyway because the Patriarchs, living before the giving of the Torah, led their lives according to the \"seichel hayashar\". (It's hard to give a precise English equivalent for this term.) R. Kamenetzky explains that this is what the Midrash means when it says that derech eretz preceded the Torah. It is referring to the fact that there is an independent system of proper action that can be derived without the laws of the Torah, and this system was practiced by the Patriarchs before the Torah was given.</p>\n\n<p>Once the Torah was given, Torah Law is binding. If this \"derech eretz\" contradicted the Torah then one would presumably have to follow the Torah. Perhaps if the derech eretz was more lofty than the Torah then one could follow the \"derech eretz\". The main point is though, that according to R. Kamenetzky the Midrash is not giving a value ranking (wherein derech eretz is greater than the Torah); it is telling us that chronologically derech eretz existed before the Torah, and therefore even without the Torah laws there is still some sort of \"ethical life\" (again, hard to find good English terms) that is expected of people – even non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Emet L'Yaakov Genesis 14:14</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנה אילו היה אברהם שואל שאלה אי חייב לילך להציל את לוט בודאי היה נענה\n  שהוא פטור  דהא אין אדם מחויב להכניס את עצמו בספק סכנה בכדי להציל את\n  חבירו [עמש\"כ בענין זה להלן סוף פרשת מסעי]  אלא מה שעשה כן אברהם הוא\n  משום שהאבות נקראו \"ישרים\" [עבודה זרה דף כ\"ה ע\"א]  והיינו שכל הנהגתם\n  היתה לא על פי דיני התורה אלא על פי השכל הישר  כי האלקים עשה את האדם\n  ישר  ועל פי היושר היה מוטל על אברהם להשתדל להציל את לוט וכדביארתי לעיל\n  [י\"ג פ\"ט] כי אברהם הרגיש את עצמו כאחראי לשלומו של לוט מכיון שהרן אביו\n  מת בכבשן אביו משום שאמר שהוא מאמין באלקי אברהם  ולכן ע\"פ היושר \n  \"מענטשליך קייט\"  הוכרח אברהם להריק את חניכיו ולרדוף אחר המלכים ובאמת\n  כל חיי האבות  שחיו קודם זמן תורה  היו מונהגים על פי היושר  וזהו ביאור\n  מאמר חז\"ל [ויק\"ר פ\"ט א\"ג] דרך ארץ קדמה לתורה  והיינו שהאבות התנהגו על\n  פי דרך ארץ והיושר עוד קודם שניתנה תורה </p>\n  \n  <p>ונראה שזהו פשוטו של מקרא להלן סוף פרשת משפטים [כ\"ד פי\"ב] ואתנה לך את\n  לוחות האבן התורה והמצוה  דבשלמא מצוה היינו מצוות שנצטוו בהן  אבל מה זה\n  התורה ונראה שהכוונה היא לסיפורי התורה של האבות שנכתבו בתורה קודם\n  המצוות  והיינו שהרי לשון תורה הוא מלשון הוראה  כלומר מורה דרך  כי\n  סיפורים אלו מורים לאדם איך לחיות אפילו בלי ציווי השי\"ת  וכמו שאמר דוד\n  בקינתו על שאול הלא היא כתובה על ספר הישר  והיינו ספר בראשית וכדאיתא\n  בגמרא [ע\"ז שם</p>\n  \n  <p>והנה רש\"י ריש בראשית הקשה מדוע התחילה התורה מבראשית ברא אלקים היה לו\n  להתחיל מהחדש הזה לכם  ותירץ משום כח מעשיו הגיד לעמו לתת להם נחלת גוים\n  כו' הוא בראה ונתנה לאשר ישר בעיניו וכו' ולכאורה זה רק מיישב מדוע הביאה\n  התורה את סיפורי מעשי בראשית וכו'  אבל כל הפרשיות מלך לך עד פרשת בא \n  עדיין אינו מובן מדוע הוצרכה התורה להאריך בכל זה  ועל זה לכאורה לא תירץ\n  רש\"י כלום אבל לפמש\"כ נראה שבאמת על פרשיות אלו לא קשה כלל  דמהסיפורים\n  האלו אנו למדים מה צריכה להיות הנהגת האדם על פי היושר והדרך ארץ  ודבר\n  זה אפשר לתבוע אפילו מהגויים  כי אע\"פ שמצוות לא ניתנו להם  אבל אעפ\"כ\n  לחיות על פי יושר זה יכול כל אחד אם הוא רק רוצה בזה  ודו\"ק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>1) You have found the correct source. \"דרך ארץ קדמה לתורה\", ~~ \"Derech eretz should come before Torah.\" is actually a paraphrase of the line of Medrash you quoted \"...קדמה דרך ארץ את התורה...\" (\"...Derech eretz precedes Torah...\")</p>\n\n<p>The Alter from Slobodka (R' Nosson Tzvi Finkel; 1849 - 1927) explains that this Medrash is in fact the source that the concept of good character traits preceded the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>\"This is the intent of the Rabbis:</p>\n\n<p>Derech eretz preceded Torah by twenty six generations; for all of\nthe good character traits and attributes are included in derech\neretz; they were ingrained in human nature and for them there\nis no need for the giving of the Torah.\" </p>\n\n<p>(Or HaTzafun Vol. 1 pg. 175) (its good to read from 173 - 176)</p>\n\n<p>A further proof that the Medrash means to promote good character as preceding the Torah, is to be found in the story that is written right before this passage about the 26 generations. :</p>\n\n<p>paraphrase/summaraize: (Rabbi Yannai asked his guest if he knew any Torah, Mishnah, Gemara, or Aggadah, and found that he did not. R' Yannai then decided to call the man a \"dog\". The guest retorted that R' Yannai was out of line for saying so. So R' Yannai asked him about his merits? The guest replied that he never responded to an insult with another insult (or never repeated gossip) and that if he ever saw two people fighting, he would make peace between them. R' Yannai then expressed sincere regret for calling him a dog. R' Yannai then proceeded to expound our verse about the path to the tree of life.</p>\n\n<p>(same passage of Vayikra Rabbah 9)</p>\n\n<p>The point is that while it took 26 generations from Adam until Moshe Rabeinu to receive the Torah, Derech Eretz (good character) was taught as the path to the tree of life during Adam's lifetime.</p>\n\n<p>2) Lets's look at examples in the Torah and what scholars have said. </p>\n\n<p>Obviously, a full treatment of exactly when \"Derech Eretz\" outranks a law in Shulchan Aruch, or vice versa (should they conflict) ; or vs. a D'oraisa or D'rabbanan etc. is beyond the scope of a \"MY\" post. Still, we can answer the OP's 2nd question by illustrating examples that can promote clarity when accompanied by further study, and a case by case inquiry, directed to one's Rav.</p>\n\n<p>a) \"So Moshe went and returned to Yisro, his father-in-law, and said to him, “Let me now go back to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.” And Yisro said to Moshe, “Go in peace.” (Ex. 4:18)</p>\n\n<p>We see that although Moshe Rabeinu was commanded by Hashem to go back to Egypt and redeem Israel, he had to first stop in by his father-in-law and ask his permission to leave. </p>\n\n<p>Millions of Jews are waiting for Moshiach to redeem them from bondage and suffering. But, what kind of redeemer would Moshe be if he couldn't care less about his father-in-law's feelings?</p>\n\n<p>We see something similar when Eliyahu picked Elisha to follow him as his student. Kings I 19:20 \"And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said: \"Let me, please, kiss my father and my mother, and I will go after you,\" and he said to him, \"Go, return, for what have I done to you?\"</p>\n\n<p>So, before listening to the summons of Elijah, go kiss your parents and pay your respects to family (as the next verse shows, he made a \"going away\" party, before leaving.)</p>\n\n<p>b) Yaakov Avinu married two sisters. The famous question asked in Yeshivah is: \"How did Yaakov marry two sisters if the Avos kept the entire Torah before it was given?\"</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe answers that before Matan Torah, the whole world kept the \"Derech Eretz\" ideal that one must keep their word. Yaakov Avinu had promised Rachel to marry her. Now, Laban tricked Yaakov, causing him to marry Leah first. That may have made Rachel the second sister forbidden in marriage by the Torah, but Yaakov had an obligation to keep his word and be a mentch. Since the Torah had not really been given yet, keeping it would be described as \"chassidus\" or above the letter of the law. But, being true to your word and promise <strong><em>was the law</em></strong>. So, he had to marry her too.</p>\n\n<p>But, we see that had a man promised to marry someone after marrying her sister, the Torah's command (not to marry the second sister) would in fact stop him from marrying her nowadays (after the Torah was given) and make it impossible to fulfill his word.</p>\n\n<p>c.) A Rabbi who was once needed to be the 10th man in a minyan for Minchah, asked the Chazon Ish if he should stay for the communal Minchah prayer and help complete the needed ten men, or should he honor his business appointment? He could not be on time for both.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish replied that it would be much better to allow the minyan and prayer to dissolve than to be late for his agreed appointment, in which he gave his word to be there at a certain time.</p>\n\n<p>3) The OP's third question is even more complicated than it seems.</p>\n\n<p>\"Hashem looked into the Torah and created the world.\" (Bereishis Rabbah 1:1)</p>\n\n<p>If so, how does VaYikra Rabbah say that Derech Eretz (a path to the tree of life) came before the Torah? In order for that tree and path to exist, it needed to be created. Yet, that creation needed the Torah to precede it as a blueprint!</p>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avos itself seems unclear on the subject of which comes first:</p>\n\n<p>\"R' Elazar ben Azariah says: If there is no Torah, there is no Derech Eretz; If there is no Derech eretz, there is no Torah.\" (Pirkei Avos 3:17)</p>\n\n<p>If we understand the above, we can answer the Op's 3d question.</p>\n\n<p>The meaning is that there are two types of Derech Eretz. 1) The fine character traits that were invested into the world and Adam for all people to keep as basic law by their internal moral compass. <strong>Then The Torah was Given</strong> (In which all previous obligations of Derech Eretz were included AND new levels of Divine Law and new levels of Derech Eretz were made obligatory) 2) Once the Torah was given, we are offered higher insight into even greater and greater levels of Derech Eretz. </p>\n\n<p>So first, is Hashem's will. This is the Torah. It of course contains every idea of Derech Eretz as well. Then Hashem gave the simple obligatory Derech Eretz to Adam. Then the Torah was given to the Jews. Then the Torah inspires us to even higher states of Derech Eretz. </p>\n\n<p>Now if there is no recognition of Torah, man would be without belief in G-d. If so, then even his own moral compass will be misdirected and ignored without basic belief in Hashem and His Torah. BUT, if there is no basic Derech Eretz in a person that makes him act like a decent human being, then one cannot reach the higher level of living by Torah Law; because Torah was not given to animals.</p>\n\n<p>(That last paragraph explains R' Elazar ben Azariah's cryptic saying above.\")</p>\n\n<p>Some proof for all this can be found here:</p>\n\n<p>\"R' Yochanan Said: Had the Torah not been given, we would have\nlearned to be modest from cats, to avoid theft from ants, to avoid\npromiscuity from doves, and proper marital relations from roosters.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Talmud, Eiruvin 100b)</p>\n\n<p>\"For all precepts that are dependent on logic and intuition of the heart are already binding upon all [humanity] from the day that G-d created man on the earth, upon man and his offspring for all future generations.\" </p>\n\n<p>(Rabeinu Nissim Gaon's introduction to the Talmud)</p>\n\n<p>\"However, upon reflection we will see that character traits and\nattributes are an introduction to the Torah and the primary\nfoundation of the essence of a person, without which a person is\nnot worthy at all of Torah … This is the intent of the Rabbis:\nDerech eretz preceded Torah by twenty six generations, for all of\nthe good character traits and attributes are included in derech\neretz; they were ingrained in human nature and for them there\nis no need for the giving of the Torah. <strong>The giving of the Torah\ncame to build on these [traits and attributes] and to command\nhim (man) to continue to rise heavenward to ever higher levels\ntranscending those which are in the realm of derech eretz.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>(The Alter from Slobodka (Or HaTzafun Vol. 1 pg. 173 - 176))</p>\n\n<p>\"One must first improve one’s own character traits and with that, the\nTorah can endure with him because it cannot endure with a person\nthat doesn’t have good character traits. One cannot learn Torah\nfirst and then acquire good character traits because this is impossible. </p>\n\n<p>Without Torah there is no derech eretz-Meaning that one\nwho doesn’t know Torah is incomplete in character traits of\nderech eretz because a majority of the good character traits\nabout the ways of the world are in the Torah. For example,\nextending loans, severance pay, honest weights and\nmeasures and many others like this. If so, without Torah,\none’s character traits cannot be complete with Derech Eretz.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Rabeinu Yonah on Pirkei Avos 3:17)</p>\n\n<p>So now the answer to the OP's #3 is obvious. Yes, certain elements of \"Derech Eretz\" are higher than the basic elements of Derech Eretz (which are certainly obligatory), yet are still very worthy pursuits even if at first they are not taught as fully obligatory. The Torah's full Pirkei Avos, contains much encouragement to increase our Derech eretz, even beyond the letter of the Law. </p>\n\n\n",

Or is it a different story?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am unaware of a teaching that says only Jews have Bechira Chofshis, or that such bechira would only apply to mitzvos. </p>\n\n<p>Please consider: \"Rebbe [Yehuda HaNasi] said: Which is the straight path that a person should choose for himself? Whichever [path] that is [itself] praiseworthy for the person adopting [it], And praiseworthy to him from [other] people. And be as careful with a light commandment as with a weighty one, for you do not know the reward given [for the fulfillment] of [the respective] commandments.\" </p>\n\n<p>(Pirkei Avos 2:1)</p>\n\n<p>What point would Rebbe be making here if people lacked free will? Who is he advising on which career to choose or which mitzvah to be careful with?</p>\n\n<p>Tanach verses:</p>\n\n<p>Deut 30:19 \"This day, I call upon the heaven and the earth as witnesses [that I have warned] you: I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. <strong>You shall choose life</strong>, so that you and your offspring will live;..\"</p>\n\n<p>Here near the end of the Torah, we are told that we should choose life over death. Hence we must have free choice.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 7:15 \"For, when the lad does not yet know to <strong>reject bad and choose good</strong>, the land whose two kings you dread, shall be abandoned.\"</p>\n\n<p>There is an age when a youth starts to be able to exercise choice.</p>\n\n<p>Gen. 4:7 \"Is it not so that if you improve, it will be forgiven you? If you do not improve, however, at the entrance, <strong>sin</strong> is lying, and to you is its longing, <strong>but you can rule over it</strong>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here, Cain, (a Gentile, since there were no Jews then) is told he has free choice in the matter of sin.</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 56:6 \"..And the foreigners <strong>who join</strong> with the Lord <strong>to serve</strong> Him and <strong>to love</strong> the name of the Lord, to be His servants,..\"</p>\n\n<p>Here Gentiles are described by the Prophet as \"joining, serving, and loving.\" These are things one cannot usually be described to be doing against one's own free will if done in \"love\".</p>\n\n<p>Deut. 23: 16-17 \"You shall not deliver a slave to his master if he seeks refuge. [Rather,] he shall [be allowed to] reside among you, <strong>wherever he chooses</strong> within any of your cities, where it is good for him. You shall not oppress him.\"</p>\n\n<p>Here we see that when a Gentile slave escapes his master and seeks refuge with the Jews, we are to grant sanctuary. Part of the grant is that the Gentile may choose where he wishes to settle. (The Hebrew words used are <strong>\" אֲשֶׁר־יִבְחַ֛ר \"</strong>.)\nThat is the root verb for <strong>\"bechirah\" or \"choice\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>So we see that even in secular matters (not just commandments) a Gentile has a choice.</p>\n\n<p>It seems all (Jews and Gentiles) have free choice in both secular and religious matters.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the quote: \"Everything is in the hands of Heaven except the fear of Heaven.\" </p>\n\n<p>It is not to be found in Pirkei Avos. It is to be found in Talmud Brachos 33b:</p>\n\n<p>\"<strong>And Rabbi CḤanina said: Everything is in the hands of Heaven, except for fear of Heaven.\"as it is stated: “And now Israel, what does the L-rd your G-d ask of you other than to fear the L-rd your G-d,</strong> ... [to walk in all of His ways, to love Him and to serve the L-rd your G-d with all your heart and with all your soul” (Deuteronomy 10:12).]  </p>\n\n<p>The statement means that all things in life may be fully granted by Heaven, except fear of heaven which is a up to a person's free choice; to listen to Hashem. R' CHanina seems to learn this from the structure of the verse: <strong>\"..what does the L-rd your G-d ask of you other than..\"</strong>. So, fear of Heaven is the only thing possible that Hashem would need to ask of us, because everything else is solely up to Him. Yet if he does need to ask us for it, then He must have given us free choice.</p>\n\n<p>It seems from all of the above that the verses of Torah themselves and the words of our Mishnah and Talmud, (quoted above) logically are self evident proofs that all men (Jew or Gentile) have free will to choose in secular and religious matters.</p>\n\n<p>I mean you can read them on their face and you should come to that conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you need a proof from a Rabbinical source that agrees, you should read the Rambam Hilchos Teshuvah ch.5 . I have provided some excerpts of it below.</p>\n\n<p>\"Free will is granted to <strong>all men</strong>. If one desires to turn himself to the path of good and be righteous, the choice is his. Should he desire to turn to the path of evil and be wicked, the choice is his.</p>\n\n<p>This is [the intent of] the Torah's statement (Genesis 3:22): \"Behold, man has become unique as ourselves, knowing good and evil,\" i.e., the human species became singular in the world with no other species resembling it in the following quality: that man can, on his own initiative, with his knowledge and thought, know good and evil, and do what he desires. There is no one who can prevent him from doing good or bad. </p>\n\n<p>A person should not entertain the thesis held by the <strong>fools among the gentiles and the majority of the undeveloped among Israel</strong> that, at the time of a man's creation, The Holy One, blessed be He, decrees whether he will be righteous or wicked.</p>\n\n<p>This is untrue. Each person is fit to be righteous like Moses, our teacher, or wicked, like Jeroboam. [Similarly,] he may be wise or foolish, merciful or cruel, miserly or generous, or [acquire] any other character traits. There is no one who compels him, sentences him, or leads him towards either of these two paths. Rather, he, on his own initiative and decision, tends to the path he chooses.</p>\n\n<p>This was [implied by the prophet,] Jeremiah who stated [Eichah 3:38: \"From the mouth of the Most High, neither evil or good come forth.\" Accordingly, it is the sinner, himself, who causes his own loss.</p>\n\n<p>This principle is a fundamental concept and a pillar [on which rests the totality] of the Torah and mitzvot as [Deuteronomy 30:15] states: \"Behold, I have set before you today life [and good, death and evil].\" Similarly, [Deuteronomy 11:26] states, \"Behold, I have set before you today [the blessing and the curse],\" implying that the choice is in your hands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Any one of the deeds of men which a person desires to do</strong>, he may, whether good or evil. Therefore, [Deuteronomy 5:26] states:</p>\n\n<p>\"If only their hearts would always remain this way.\" From this, we can infer that the Creator does not compel or decree that people should do either good or bad. Rather, everything is left to their [own choice].\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer is Yes, but some background first:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Judaism has no clear tradition regarding the non-Jews.

    "content": "# Retroactive psak and conversions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n\n<p>I constantly read about Orthodox conversions which are retroactively nullified by the Israeli Rabbanut, sometimes affecting multiple generations. I am not writing this question to express nor solicit any opinions on the matter (I believe there may be strong arguments in both directions, but that it is our religious duty as Jews to trust the rabbinate). However, I am interested in the mechanism by which this works. </p>\n\n<p>What is the role of \"revised psak\" and what are its parameters? \nIs it possible to pasken retroactively about the no-longer-living? How, if at all, does the existence of a previous psak by the rabbis of their generation limit the reach of the rabbis in ours?</p>\n\n<p>If it is a question of \"new information\" entering the case -- such as, G-d forbid, a question about the righteousness of the converting rabbis -- why aren't rabbonim constantly reevaluating past piskei din of all kinds in the light of \"new information\"?  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: I am aware of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/66245/retroactive-annulment-of-conversion\">these</a> two <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/52891/am-i-jewish\">questions</a> and strongly believe this is not a duplicate.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Revised psak can be three different things.</p>\n\n<p>1) A Rabbi or Beis din, realizes they made a big mistake. (certain pigs are kosher ... ooops! wrong)</p>\n\n<p>So after the psak (legal decision) is issued (example: that pigs are kosher), the Rabbis issue a public recall and say \"We made a grave error in judgment. It was a mistake. All should know that pigs were never kosher at all and continue to be forbidden for kosher consumption.\"</p>\n\n<p>The ramifications are that anyone who ate pork during this time (when the permission was publicized) has committed a sinful act (albeit mistakenly) and needs to clean and purify (kasher) their pots and pans which were used with the pork. </p>\n\n<p>We do not say that during the time of mistaken permission, everything is OK. Rather, we now know (revealed retroactively) that everyone was eating forbidden food.</p>\n\n<p>The resulting question of how to atone for this, or who is responsible and on what level, is dealt with in the Talmud Tractate Horayos (starting on 2a).</p>\n\n<p>2) In the Book of Ruth, \"Ploni Almoni\" is asked by Boaz, to marry Ruth. He declines to perform the mitzvah, because Ruth is a Moabite (forbidden by the Torah in marriage to a Jew).</p>\n\n<p>Even though the law was taught that the verse means a male Moabite and not a female, \"Ploni Almoni\" was still concerned that a future great court having more members and greater wisdom, would reverse that decision retroactively. It may be that such a decision would not make him into a sinner (because he legitimately relied on the Rabbis of his time) ; but it would cause his children in that future generation to become tainted as Moabite descendants. </p>\n\n<p>A future court may change the Halachah and that may change the ramifications of reality if it is greater in wisdom and number than the previous court. (Talmud Tractate Ediyus 1:5)</p>\n\n<p>3) Finally, there is an example of relying on one opinion to decide Halachah and later switching to another opinion from now on. For instance, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav, in Hilchos Shabbos, constantly states that the time Shabbos starts on Friday night is \"when it becomes dark\" (tzeis hacochavim). However, The Jewish people (including followers of the 1st Lubavitcher Rebbe who wrote Shulchan Aruch HaRav) generally accept Shabbos on Friday night at an earlier time; at sundown (shkiah). The reason is that the Rav changed his mind in a later writing (as did many poskim of the time) and started to teach a stricter practical view of how we should keep Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>This doesn't mean that those who kept the old times sinned. It also does not mean that the Rav was mistaken. Rather, the Jewish people adopted a different path in Halachah based on a new controlling opinion. This has nothing to do with retroactive review.</p>\n\n<p>As you can see, sometimes it may affect the no longer living; and something established as law from previous times is hard to reverse.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As far as reversing conversion psak, it is almost always about \"new information\" being brought to light and how we interpret it.</p>\n\n<p>The important Halachic factors at work are (<strong>\"THE MECHANISM BY WHICH THIS WORKS\"</strong>):</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Tractate Yevamos 47b: The Braisa states: \"...after the convert immerses in the Mikveh he is “Jewish in all regards.” </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara comments on this that \"<strong>If the convert reneges (backslides</strong>, stops keeping the mitzvos, reverts to acting like a Gentile etc.) and then marries a Jewish woman <strong>he is regarded as a sinful Jew and his marriage is valid.</strong>”</p>\n\n<p>Rashi there implies that even if he reverted to being a full Gentile his conversion is still valid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So firstly we see from here that once the kosher conversion process is complete, it is actually irreversible.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>So how is there any room to invalidate a conversion after the fact?</p>\n\n<p>Well crucially, The Gemara above (that says a backslider is always a Jew) is applied to a case where he was a \"sincere convert\" but changed his mind later and decided to backslide.</p>\n\n<p>If however, he was not a sincere convert, then he never was a Jew. So how do we know?</p>\n\n<p>This revolves around revealing information that the initial conversion was a sham (fraud), completely insincere, or not kosher (or not supervised by an Orthodox Beis Din) to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>If that was the case, then the conversion never took place. We may have been misinformed until now (for the past 100 years even) that there was a good conversion process, but now we find out that it was not. This is not \"reversing a psak\" or \"invalidating a psak\". It is the discovery that the convert was never a convert in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Another important Halachic idea:</p>\n\n<p>What are the rules of a sincere and kosher conversion?</p>\n\n<p>a) Here is a strict source :</p>\n\n<p>Our Sages taught: …if an idol worshipper came to accept the Torah except for one thing (mitzvah), we do not accept him. R. Yossi b”r Yehudah says: even if the exception be one of the minutiae of the Rabbanan.</p>\n\n<p>(Talmud Tractate Bechoros 30)</p>\n\n<p>b) Here is a more lenient source:</p>\n\n<p>\"Our Rabbis taught: If at the present time a man desires to become a proselyte, he is to be addressed as follows: “What reason have you for desiring to become a proselyte? Do you not know that Israel at the present time are persecuted and oppressed, despised, harassed and overcome by afflictions”? If he replies “I know and yet am unworthy” he is accepted forthwith, <strong>and is given instruction in some of the minor and some of the major commandments</strong>. He is also told of the punishment for the transgression of the commandments and the reward of the world to come, But he is not, however, to be persuaded or dissuaded too much.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Talmud Tractate Yevamos 47)</p>\n\n<p>As we can see, the two Gemaras seem to differ in the extent the convert is informed and accepts \"ALL MITZVOS.\" </p>\n\n<p>Another concept at work, is called:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"Devarim She'b'lev ainam devarim\" or \"matters of the heart are not considered.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>(see example: Talmud Tractate Kiddushin 49b). </p>\n\n<p>This is a saying throughout the Talmud. In general, Beis Din cannot decide a case based on what is going on inside someone's heart.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, some traditions rely on the convert performing a bris, mikveh immersion, and declaring to accept mitzvos in front of a kosher Beis Din, to make a kosher conversion; but do not demand verified sincerity as a requirement. (see Rambam Hilchos Isurei Biah 13:17)</p>\n\n<p>Stricter traditions, require the court to verify the convert's sincerity, being a requirement for a valid conversion. This is based on Shulchan Aruch 268:3 which requires sincere acceptance of the mitzvos as an integral part of a valid conversion.</p>\n\n<p>The first approach claims that a court cannot know about sincerity at all because <strong>matters of the heart are not considered</strong> by the court. However, some (second approach) would say that in conversion, since the convert's sincerity is an essential ingredient before the court, then the court must try to understand the convert's sincerity. </p>\n\n<p>A third approach says that we do not need to examine \"matters of the heart\" but still if it is blatantly obvious that the convert was not sincere, it is as if witnesses told us he is not and the conversion is invalid. (I believe this is brought as the opinion of R' Moshe Feinstein)</p>\n\n<p>So to sum it all up, a community will accept good presumptions that a person claiming to be a convert, is a kosher Jew. Also, such good presumptions are not subject to review. However, if something is revealed which casts doubt on the person's conversion, an investigation may be made. Now depending upon which opinion(s) you hold of as stated above, the \"new information\" may show us that there never was a conversion in the first place.</p>\n\n\n",

In this case the question is on a joint statement of Rav and Shmuel. (Whether there is also a concept of \"Shmuel is a tanna\" as well is subject to debate, but for the sake of this answer let's assume that there isn't.) Thus even if the Gemara were to answer here that Rav is a tanna, it wouldn't help for Shmuel, who would still be refuted.</p>\n\n<p>Now one could retort that if Shmuel is agreeing with Rav and Rav is a tanna then Shmuel should be on safe ground. However, in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=8&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 8a</a> there is a statement that is cited first in the name of Rav and then in the name of R. Yochanan. When the Gemara challenges the statement of Rav it answers that Rav is a tanna, but when it challenges the statement of R. Yochanan it gives a different answer. Tosafot there asks why R. Yochanan couldn't defend himself by saying that he agrees with Rav who is a tanna. Tosafot answers that R. Yochanan frequently argues with Rav, which shows that even if Rav considers himself a tanna R. Yochanan does not consider Rav to be a tanna. If that is the case then R. Yochanan cannot now hide behind Rav, saying that he is a tanna.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=8&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafot Ketubot 8a s.v.

Thus, the <em>tanna</em>'s statment is an effective refutation of Rav's position.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In that specific case of Berachot 37a, Chazal rejected the reasoning of Rav and Shmuel, so there was no need for the Gemara to support their statement by saying he/they were a Tana. This is in accordance with the rule of \"going with the majority\".</p>\n\n<p>In the case where Rav is considered a Tana, it's because he can argue on another Tana since he was among the later Tanaim(last Tana, first Amora; he lived 400 years). However, Chazal can reject the ruling of any Tana or Amora(according to their times) should they see the emet being contrary to their ruling and the subsequent ruling would be binding on the disagreeing parties, as in the case of rice/mezonot mentioned above. So even if he/they are a Tana, Chazal rejected their reasoning in favor of their collective ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

List sources please.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The cheese does become not kosher and it would be a sin according to Torah for a Jew to eat it, <strong>IF</strong> it falls under scenario #2 below, but not scenario #1 below; as follows:</p>\n\n<p>(We are assuming the OP is talking about an accident. Of course, we do not use meat pans for making grilled cheese.)</p>\n\n<p>The first classic question is if the meat pan was actually used for hot meat within the past 24 hours? Also, was it clean?</p>\n\n<p><strong>1)</strong> If it was not used in the past 24 hours, and is currently clean, then the old taste of meat within the surfaces of the pan is called \"nosen taam lifgam\" or \"a spoiled taste\". This kind of meat taste cannot cause the grilled cheese to become forbidden. (see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 103:5)</p>\n\n<p>The pan must be kashered. (S.A. Y.D. 93:1) </p>\n\n<p>R' Yosef Karo (Sefardi custom) says there that meanwhile, the pan may be used for pareve (neither milk nor meat) foods. However, the Rema (94:5) and the Shach (93:3) forbid this by Ashkenazi custom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2)</strong> If the pan was in fact used for cooking meat in the past 24 hours, then both the grilled cheese (absorbing potent meat flavor) and pan are forbidden. The food is thrown out and the pan is kashered. If the pan actually contained real meat residue, then the grilled cheese touching real meat is certainly a problem. This can happen more often with disposable pans.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, I do not remember the source, but if you do not know when you last used the pan then you may assume it was longer ago than 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>Please use this as a general learning about the Halachic issues. There are many other issues that may come up and new cases might not be comparable. If you have a real question, consult your local Orthodox Rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

There was a calf that was being led to slaughter. The calf went and hung its head on the corner of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi’s garment and was weeping. Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said to it: Go, as you were created for this purpose. It was said in Heaven: Since he was not compassionate toward the calf, let afflictions come upon him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Could we negate an opposite reaction from the Heaven - if they said: \"Well done R' Yehudah, for you truly understand the benefit for an animal of being sacrificed in the Temple before G-d!\"? I doubt, it seems as legitimate as the original outcome.</p>\n<p>Just another example: R' Eliezer and the Sages (B\"M 59b) - G-d could easily kill all the Sages for not listening to the Heavenly Voice, but He acted differently.</p>\n<p>How can we learn from those examples where the outcome is seemingly arbitrary, as it can not be negated?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>NB: a slightly different pattern is that a Rabbi does X and the Gemmorah approves/condemns it, but it follows the same reasoning: as we can't negate the outcome - we can't learn from the story.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How can we learn from those examples where the outcome is seemingly arbitrary, as it can not be negated?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We learn that our reasoning is lacking, to the extent that what we see as two equally likely choices are in fact one correct and one incorrect choice. The lesson the Talmud is teaching us is all the more valuable for its nonobviousness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I suggest that what we learn from stories such as these is <em>not</em> how precisely to balance the specific types of competing values presented in them, but rather the independent strength of both the value that God endorses in the story, <em>and</em> the competing value as well. When we're presented with competing values in real life, the facts of every case are going to be different, and no case is ever going to be identical to the one found in the Talmudic story, so the binary question of which value won in that case is not terribly helpful<sup>1</sup>. However, these stories are very helpful for learning what values to apply, and what values to give qualitatively special weight to, which shapes how we analyze a case to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Applying this suggestion to your first example:</p>\n\n<p>We see from God's response to R' Yehuda Hanasi that the value of compassion is tremendously strong (to the point that in this case, it outweighed that of duty to God's service). We also see from R' Yehuda's initial reaction that the value of duty to God's service is tremendously strong (to the point that in the mind of this exemplar of Torah values, there was reason to believe that it might outweigh that of compassion). So, if we run into a crying person or animal in real life, we know that we should give strong consideration to giving them mercy. And, if we see an opportunity to devote ourselves to God's service, we know that we should give it strong consideration.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. This limitation of the value of binary outcomes for future analysis is analogous to a similar limitation to the value of measurement of binary election outcomes, with the way in which the electoral process chooses a single winner standing in, <em>lehavdil vechulei</em>, for God. That is, if 50.1% of the electorate vote for Candidate A and 49.9% vote for candidate B, and Candidate A therefore wins the office, that doesn't indicate that the values represented by Candidate A are <em>substantively</em> any more important in the minds of the population than those represented by Candidate B. Please don't comment presenting the thousand ways in which this analogy is imperfect; it's meant for illustrative purposes only.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

It questions the definition of an elder but does not question the fact that תקום means respect, unlike in many other places where the Gemmorah asks \"where [in the scriptures] do we learn that from\".</p>\n\n<p>I tried to gather the appearances of the word לקום in the Torah, but couldn't find one that clearly points to a sign of honoring, but the opposite, for example: Kayin - \"ויהי בהיותם בשדה ויקם קין אל הבל אחיו ויהרגהו\", Jacob said \"ויאמר יעקב אל אביו אנכי עשו בכרך עשיתי כאשר דברת אלי קום נא שבה ואכלה\", Moses said \"ויהי בנסע הארן ויאמר משה קומה יהוה ויפצו איבי\". Standing up is clearly not a sign of respect.</p>\n\n<p>What can be the Biblical source for equaling קימה to כבוד and why did Torah use קימה for that Mitzvah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah equates rising before an elder with respect and connects it to fearing Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>VaYikra 19:32 \"You shall <strong>rise</strong> before a venerable person and you shall <strong>honor</strong> the elderly, and you shall fear your God. I am the Lord.</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis 31:35 \"And she said to <strong>her father</strong>, \"Let <strong>my lord</strong> not be annoyed, for I cannot <strong>rise before you</strong>, for the way of women is upon me.\" (\"לָק֣וּם\")</p>\n\n<p>The concept is that when someone of respect walks into your presence, you should not feel \"informal\" and remain seated or lying down comfortably. Standing up shows that you are making a conscious effort to acknowledge the arrival of a respected person. You are not remaining at ease.</p>\n\n<p>Tanach proves this meaning by showing the opposite usage as well. Mordechai refused to even rise up in respect when Haman entered, because he was planning genocide and declared himself as an idol.</p>\n\n<p>Esther 4:9 \"And Haman went out on that day, happy and with a cheerful heart, but when Haman saw Mordechai in the king's gate, and he <strong>neither rose nor stirred</strong> because of him, Haman was filled with wrath against Mordecai. (\"וְלֹא־קָם֙ וְלֹא־זָ֣ע מִמֶּ֔נּוּ\")</p>\n\n<p>We see rising before someone would have been taken as respect.</p>\n\n<p>Also, Tanach uses the term \"<strong>rise</strong>\" (\"ק֗וּמוּ\") as a pre-requisite to blessing Hashem in prayer.</p>\n\n<p>Nechemiah 9:5 \"...<strong>Rise</strong>, bless the Lord your God from everlasting to everlasting,...\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Apparent wrong arrangement of war instructions in Devarim 20:1-9\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While reviewing the instructions that the Cohen tells people prior to going to war, as shown in Devarim 20:1-9, there seems to be an incorrect order of statements. In particular:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Verse 3 - The Cohen makes a general statement that no one should fear the enemy.</li>\n<li>In verses 5-7 the judges list 3 groups of people that are exempt from fighting</li>\n<li>In verse 8, the judges exempt anyone who is still fearful</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Question - What is the purpose of the overall proclamation of not fearing the enemy if you won't be in the army, anyway? </p>\n\n<p>I'm inferring that the purpose of the initial proclamation in verse 3 is not for the general people but for the army since it says in verse 1, already, not to fear them. That seems to be addressed to everyone, overall. Verse 2 says, \"When you approach the war\" - that seems to be the army, as they will be the ones who will fight. Additionally, at the end of citing what the judges say, in verse 9, it says that they appoint leaders of the army.</p>\n\n<p>For me, logically, the declaration of not having fear should be placed just before verse 8. I.e., first he exempts the first 3 groups (just engaged, new house, new field purchase). Then, of those left, he says, \"Don't fear because G-d is fighting with you. Finally, after that, he should say (Even though you have just been told <strong>not</strong> to fear,) if you are still fearful, you are exempt.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.20.8.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on 20:8</a> brings the opinion of R. Yose HaGalili, that the person who is sent home is one who is afraid due to having committed sins.</p>\n\n<p>So, according to this view, we can suggest that 20:3 is telling the soldiers not to be afraid of the physical reality of war (as Rashi says <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.20.3.3?with=all&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>). Then, in 20:8, there is a separate, unrelated exemption for those who have sinned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yerushalmi Sotah 8:1 expressly says that the verses are in the wrong order! So I think you’re right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi to Devarim 20:8 quotes R' Yossi: \"Rabbi Yose the Galilean says that [it means] one who is afraid of his sins [that they will cause him to fall in war, as he is unworthy], and therefore, <strong>the Torah gives him the excuse</strong> of attributing his return home because of a house, a vineyard, or a wife, <strong>to cover up</strong> for those who return because of their sins, so that people should not understand that they are sinners. [Consequently,] one who sees this person returning would say,“Perhaps he has built a house, or planted a vineyard, or betrothed a woman.” - [Sotah 44a]</p>\n\n<p>If you exempt the three groups first, (and they leave) and only then address the remaining army that they should not fear, then the following exemption for fearful people, will be noticed by all as triggering those who are cowardly to leave because of being sinners. That would embarrass them; which the Torah is trying to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>Even if you say that the 3 exemptions were to be delivered first, then all would wait to hear the decree of not being afraid (Those exempt would not yet leave until after the 4th announcement.), and then the fourth exemption was delivered, it is still a problem. This is because the most recent announcement of \"don't fear\" is followed immediately by the exemption of fear. Then the exempt leave. An onlooker will have the discussion of fear in his mind, and by human nature, he will assume and suspect people leaving of simple fear, since that was the last concept discussed and their was a break in between the other exemptions.</p>\n\n<p>By announcing the anti-fear pep talk before any exemptions are announced, it makes the departure of all exempt seem like they could have truly left for any of the four reasons.</p>\n\n\n",

This principle is invoked by later authorities to exempt four-cornered undershirts from <em>tzitzith</em> (see, e.g., <em>Tekhelet V'Argaman</em> 5, s.v. <em>apikresin</em>, citing Rav Chaim Kanievski; <em>Shu\"t Chemdath Tzvi</em> 3:3; and <em>Shevet Miyehudah, Ki Teitzei</em>, cited <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2011/08/25/perftzis-undershirt-tzitzis/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).  Seemingly, even those who argue, agree that this is because the undershirt does have functional garment benefits (ibid):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yet, it does not appear that our undershirts are made solely for the purpose of absorbing sweat, for they also serve to provide a degree of warmth in the winter, and a degree of comfort in their touch. Moreover, they are sometimes worn alone, for instance when playing sport–though it stands to reason that this does not give them any great importance, for it is the way of sportsmen to wear ‘undershirts’ alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What about a garment worn solely for ritual purposes.  For example, if one wraps oneself in an American flag on July 4th, it might be argued that the fact that it is visible gives it a \"fashion\"-like garment function.  But if there was an unusual (hypothetical) custom to hide the flag between one's undershirt and shirt, there would seem to be no garment-like function at all.  </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, why would an otherwise functionless (at least on warm days) traditional <em>tallit katan</em> be obligated in <em>tzitzit</em>?  Is the reasoning that a garment functional in winter, is also considered a בגד when worn in summer?  Likewise, is a <em>tallit gadol</em> only obligated in tzitzit if simultaneously otherwise functional? (Similarly, would the same reasoning apply with regard to carrying on Shabbos and מצות קריעה?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Indeed, perhaps a functionless tallit is not obligated in tzitzit.

However, it seems that it would still be frowned upon to enter into such a situation (both legally and in terms of the honor for such a symbol), and ideally, the corners should be rounded to avoid such an issue. </p>\n\n<p>Others point out some other reasons for leniency, such as that there are not two corners in front and two in back - I personally don't see any reason why if someone is wearing it as a cape (or a tallis), that this leniency would apply, but it would apply if it is simply around their neck and all 4 corners are in the front.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Giving your z'chus to someone else\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H, I did - or almost did - a good deed. (It will be finalized bez\"H in a mazeldiker shoh.) However, when I found out a few months ago that a good result from my actions was on the horizon, I decided in my mind that I would like the z'chus for this action to go to another person who had a hand in it, and who probably needs the z'chus more. </p>\n\n<p>I know that this \"transferring the z'chus\" can be done. It's an old Jewish concept; I can't give a single source because it is everywhere. But I'd like to know a little more about <em>how</em> it is done, and whether I have done it successfully. </p>\n\n<p>1) If one wants to give the z'chus of a deed to someone else, how does one enact this? Should one pronounce words (to G-d, to others, or to the person), or is it enough just to think of it? </p>\n\n<p>2) After you have given the z'chus to someone else, how much credit can you continue to take and how much benefit in this world can you continue to derive from the action you did? Is it permissible for me to tell others that I did it -- or even, more generally, that I have done an action of this type? Or it it more proper for me to disclaim involvement altogether?</p>\n\n<p>If it is traditional to pay someone when they have done this action for you, may I accept the payment, or should I give it to her? </p>\n\n<p>3) Can you give the z'chus away before the action is finalized?</p>\n\n<p>4) In various situations with possible mitigating factors -- the mitzvah wasn't finalized when you gave the z'chus away; you failed to make a pronouncement; you really really need the z'chus now (just kidding) -- can you take the z'chus back? How? </p>\n\n<p>This is a totally serious question and I hope no one would think otherwise. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2017/04/can-you-do-mitzvos-to-benefit-others.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">noted</a> by Rabbi Natan Slifkin, there does not appear to be much early precedent for such an idea, at least as you're describing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my essay \"What Can One Do For Someone Who Has Passed Away?\" I noted\nthat classically, one's mitzvos are only a credit to those people who\nhad a formative influence on you. One's mitzvos cannot help the souls\nof other people. Rashba cites a responsum from Rav Sherira Gaon on\nthis:</p>\n<p>\"A person cannot merit someone else with reward; his elevation\nand greatness and pleasure from the radiance of the Divine Presence is\nonly in accordance with his deeds.\" (Rashba, Responsa, Vol. 7 #539)</p>\n<p>Maharam Alashkar cites Rav Hai Gaon who firmly rejects the notion that\none can transfer the reward of a mitzvah to another person and\nexplains why this is impossible:</p>\n<p>\"These concepts are nonsense and one\nshould not rely upon them. How can one entertain the notion that the\nreward of good deeds performed by one person should go to another\nperson? Surely the verse states, 'The righteousness of a righteous\nperson is on him,' (Ezek. 18:20) and likewise it states, 'And the\nwickedness of a wicked person is upon him.' Just as nobody can be\npunished on account of somebody else’s sin, so too nobody can merit\nthe reward of someone else. How could one think that the reward for\nmitzvos is something that a person can carry around with him, such\nthat he can transfer it to another person?\" (Maharam Alashkar,\nResponsa #101)</p>\n<p>The same view is found explicitly and implicitly in\nother sources, as I noted in my essay. There is simply no mechanism to\ntransfer the reward for one's own mitzvos to other people. It seems\nthat only very recent mystical-based sources claim otherwise.</p>\n<p>Now, I don't see any reason why there should be any difference if the\nperson that one is trying to help is deceased or alive. Nor do I know\nof any source in classical rabbinic literature that one can do a\nmitzvah as a merit to help someone that is sick. Prayer, yes. And\nTehillim are also a form of prayer (though it may depend upon which\nTehillim are being recited). But I know of no classical source that\none can honor one's parents or learn Torah or send away a mother bird\nas a merit for somebody else.</p>\n<p>(The most common example of people attempting to do this may be the\ncustom of women to separate challah on behalf of a sick person. Here\ntoo, though, it appears that the classical basis of this is not that\nthe mitzvah of separating challah is crediting the sick person, but\nrather that the person separating the challah thereby has a special\ntime of power/inspiration, which makes their prayer more powerful.)</p>\n<p>If I'm wrong in any of the above, I'll be glad to see sources showing\notherwise. But so far, I have found that while people are shocked when\none challenges the notion that you can learn Torah on behalf of\nsomeone who is sick, nobody has yet actually come up with any\nclassical sources demonstrating otherwise. Furthermore, if this indeed\nwas a part of classical Judaism, we would certainly expect it to have\nprominent mention in the writings of Chazal and the Rishonim. We\nappear to have another situation of something widespread that is\nbelieved to be an integral and classical part of Judaism, and yet is\nactually a modern innovation that has no basis in classical Judaism\nwhatsoever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Implications of \"According to Your fear is Your anger\" (\"כיראתך עברתך\")\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says in Tehillim 90 (a chapter attributed to Moshe Rabbeinu, if that affects anything): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יא:  מִֽי־י֖וֹדֵעַ עֹ֥ז אַפֶּ֑ךָ <strong>וּ֜כְיִרְאָֽתְךָ֗ עֶבְרָתֶֽךָ:</strong> לִמְנ֣וֹת\n  יָ֖מֵינוּ כֵּ֥ן הוֹדַ֑ע וְ֜נָבִ֗א לְבַ֣ב חָכְמָֽה: 11 Who knows the\n  might of Your wrath, <strong>and according to Your fear is Your anger.</strong>         12\n  So teach the number of our days, so that we shall acquire a heart of\n  wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I saw in another translation: \"According to the fear of You is Your anger.\" </p>\n\n<p>I was trying to find out what all this means and saw the following gemara (Taanit 8a or thereabout) :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי יוחנן כל המצדיק את עצמו מלמטה</p>\n  \n  <p>מצדיקין עליו הדין מלמעלה שנאמר אמת מארץ תצמח וצדק משמים נשקף רבי חייא\n  בר אבין אמר רב הונא מהכא (תהלים צ, יא) וכיראתך עברתך</p>\n  \n  <p>§ <strong>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Whoever is exacting with himself, by striving to\n  act righteously in every way on earth below, he is judged in an exact\n  manner in Heaven above, in order to improve him further still</strong>, as it\n  is stated: “Truth springs out of the earth, and righteousness has\n  looked down from heaven” (Psalms 85:12). Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Avin said\n  that Rav Huna said that this idea is derived from here: “And Your\n  wrath is according to the fear that is due to You” (Psalms 90:11). <strong>The\n  level of God’s wrath correlates with the offender’s fear of God.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>ריש לקיש אמר מהכא (ישעיהו סד, ד) פגעת את שש ועושה צדק בדרכיך יזכרוך הן\n  אתה קצפת ונחטא בהם עולם ונושע אמר ריב\"ל כל השמח ביסורין שבאין עליו\n  מביא ישועה לעולם שנאמר בהם עולם ונושע</p>\n  \n  <p>Reish Lakish said that this principle is derived from here: “You took\n  him away who joyfully performed righteousness, those who remembered\n  You in Your ways, behold You were wroth, and we sinned, upon them have\n  we stayed of old, that we might be saved” (Isaiah 64:4). This verse\n  also teaches that <strong>God displays wrath specifically due to the\n  transgressions of those who are accustomed to acting righteously.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is all very difficult to swallow. It seems to say that one who sins only  occasionally is punished more harshly for his sins than one who sins frequently. How does it not fly in the face of the entire reward and punishment doctrine? (Is it suggesting, for example, that one is still rewarded for increasing observance, but with diminishing returns?)</p>\n\n<p>We have a mitzvah to fear G-d at all times, said Rambam or maybe Rashi. But the assertion that \"the level of God’s wrath correlates with the offender’s fear of God\" is hardly encouraging in this matter. (How can we give our utmost in this mitzvah anyway?)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, how does this all square up with the known idea (again I can't find the source, but I am quite sure it exists in Chasidus Chabad if not elsewhere--I think it is the primary thought underlying the over-the-top efforts we make for Pesach, for example) that one endeavors to go beyond the letter of the Law precisely out of love and gratefulness to G-d for His own chesed in dealing with us? It seems quite backwards that we should set ourselves up to incur punishment if G-d forbid we fell short of our ambitions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are several Talmudic passages that can hopefully provide us with some context to understand this:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=121b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 121b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי אבא אע\"פ כן מת בנו בצמא שנאמר וסביביו נשערה מאד מלמד שהקדוש\n  ברוך הוא מדקדק עם סביביו כחוט השערה ר' חנינא אמר מהכא אל נערץ בסוד\n  קדושים רבה ונורא על כל סביביו</p>\n  \n  <p>R.

R. Hanina said, [Proof may be\n  adduced] from here: A God dreaded in the great council of the holy\n  ones, and feared of all them that are round about Him.

R. Joshua\n  b. Levi remarked: Were it not for the written text one could not\n  possibly have said it. Like a man, as it were, who carries a burden on\n  his face and wants to throw it off. He will not be slack to him that\n  hateth Him. R. Il'a explained: He will not be slack to those that hate\n  Him, but He will be slack to those who are just in all respects; and\n  this is in line with that which R. Joshua b. Levi stated: What [is the\n  implication of] what was written: Which I command thee this day to do\n  them? ‘This day [you are] to do them’ but you cannot postpone doing\n  them for tomorrow; ‘this day [you are in a position] to do them’ and\n  tomorrow [is reserved] for receiving reward for [doing] them.</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Haggai (or as some say: R. Samuel b. Nahmani) stated: What [was the\n  purpose] when Scripture wrote: Long-suffering [in the dual form] where\n  the singular might well have been used? But [this is the purport:]\n  Long-suffering towards the righteous and long-suffering also towards\n  the wicked. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/moed/Eiruvin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As explained by Rashi and Tosafot, this means that God saves the punishment of the wicked and the reward of the righteous for the next world – and the implication is that the righteous receive their (whatever minute amount of) punishment and the wicked receive their (whatever minute amount of) reward in this world.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 7a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבא ואיתימא רב חסדא אם רואה אדם שיסורין באין עליו יפשפש במעשיו\n  שנא' נחפשה דרכינו ונחקורה ונשובה עד ה' פשפש ולא מצא יתלה בבטול תורה\n  שנאמר אשרי הגבר אשר תיסרנו יה ומתורתך תלמדנו ואם תלה ולא מצא בידוע\n  שיסורין של אהבה הם שנאמר כי את אשר יאהב ה' יוכיח. אמר רבא אמר רב סחורה\n  אמר רב הונא כל שהקב\"ה חפץ בו מדכאו ביסורין שנאמר וה' חפץ דכאו החלי\n  יכול אפילו לא קבלם מאהבה תלמוד לומר אם תשים אשם נפשו מה אשם לדעת אף\n  יסורין לדעת ואם קבלם מה שכרו יראה זרע יאריך ימים ולא עוד אלא שתלמודו\n  מתקיים בידו שנא' וחפץ ה' בידו יצלח</p>\n  \n  <p>Raba (some say, R. Hisda) says: If a man sees that painful sufferings\n  visit him, let him examine his conduct. For it is said: Let us search\n  and try our ways, and return unto the Lord. If he examines and finds\n  nothing [objectionable], let him attribute it to the neglect of the\n  study of the Torah. For it is said: Happy is the man whom Thou\n  chastenest, O Lord, and teachest out of Thy law. If he did attribute\n  it [thus], and still did not find [this to be the cause], let him be\n  sure that these are chastenings of love. For it is said: For whom the\n  Lord loveth He correcteth.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Raba, in the name of R. Sahorah, in the\n  name of R. Huna, says: If the Holy One, blessed be He, is pleased with\n  a man, he crushes him with painful sufferings. For it is said: And the\n  Lord was pleased with [him, hence] he crushed him by disease. Now, you\n  might think that this is so even if he did not accept them with love.\n  Therefore it is said: To see if his soul would offer itself in\n  restitution. Even as the trespass-offering must be brought by consent,\n  so also the sufferings must be endured with consent. And if he did\n  accept them, what is his reward? He will see his seed, prolong his\n  days. And more than that, his knowledge [of the Torah] will endure\n  with him. For it is said: The purpose of the Lord will prosper in his\n  hand. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הקב\"ה מייסרו בעוה\"ז בלא שום עון כדי להרבות שכרו בעולם הבא יותר מכדי\n  זכיותיו</p>\n  \n  <p>The Holy-One-lessed-Be-He torments him in this world without any sin,\n  in order to increase his reward in the world to come more than his\n  merits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And of course there is the classic passage dealing with the general question of why the righteous suffer (and the wicked prosper):</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=7&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 7a</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"ר יוחנן משום ר' יוסי שלשה דברים בקש משה מלפני הקב\"ה ונתן לו בקש\n  שתשרה שכינה על ישראל ונתן לו שנאמר הלוא בלכתך עמנו בקש שלא תשרה שכינה\n  על עובדי כוכבים ונתן לו שנאמר ונפלינו אני ועמך בקש להודיעו דרכיו של\n  הקב\"ה ונתן לו שנא' הודיעני נא את דרכיך אמר לפניו רבש\"ע מפני מה יש צדיק\n  וטוב לו ויש צדיק ורע לו יש רשע וטוב לו ויש רשע ורע לו אמר לו משה צדיק\n  וטוב לו צדיק בן צדיק צדיק ורע לו צדיק בן רשע רשע וטוב לו רשע בן צדיק\n  רשע ורע לו רשע בן רשע: אמר מר צדיק וטוב לו צדיק בן צדיק צדיק ורע לו\n  צדיק בן רשע איני והא כתיב פקד עון אבות על בנים וכתיב ובנים לא יומתו על\n  אבות ורמינן קראי אהדדי ומשנינן לא קשיא הא כשאוחזין מעשה אבותיהם בידיהם\n  הא כשאין אוחזין מעשה אבותיהם בידיהם אלא הכי קא\"ל צדיק וטוב לו צדיק\n  גמור צדיק ורע לו צדיק שאינו גמור רשע וטוב לו רשע שאינו גמור רשע ורע לו\n  רשע גמור ופליגא דר' מאיר דא\"ר מאיר שתים נתנו לו ואחת לא נתנו לו שנא'\n  וחנתי את אשר אחון אע\"פ שאינו הגון ורחמתי את אשר ארחם אע\"פ שאינו הגון </p>\n  \n  <p>R. Johanan further said in the name of R. Jose: Three things did Moses\n  ask of the Holy One, blessed be He, and they were granted to him. He\n  asked that the Divine Presence should rest upon Israel, and it was\n  granted to him. For it is said: Is it not in that Thou goest with us\n  [so that we are distinguished, I and Thy people, from all the people\n  that are upon the face of the earth]. He asked that the Divine\n  Presence should not rest upon the idolaters, and it was granted to\n  him. For it is said: ‘So that we are distinguished, I and Thy people’.\n  He asked that He should show him the ways of the Holy One, blessed be\n  He, and it was granted to him. For it is said: Show me now Thy ways.\n  Moses said before Him: Lord of the Universe, why is it that some\n  righteous men prosper and others are in adversity, some wicked men\n  prosper and others are in adversity? He replied to him: Moses, the\n  righteous man who prospers is the righteous man the son of a righteous\n  man; the righteous man who is in adversity is a righteous man the son\n  of a wicked man. The wicked man who prospers is a wicked man son of a\n  righteous man; the wicked man who is in adversity is a wicked man son\n  of a wicked man.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Master said above: ‘The righteous man who prospers is a righteous\n  man son of a righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is a\n  righteous man son of a wicked man’. But this is not so! For, lo, one\n  verse says: Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children,\n  and another verse says: Neither shall the children be put to death for\n  the fathers. And a contradiction was pointed out between these two\n  verses, and the answer was given that there is no contradiction. The\n  one verse deals with children who continue in the same course as their\n  fathers, and the other verse with children who do not continue in the\n  course of their fathers! — [You must] therefore [say that] the Lord\n  said thus to Moses: A righteous man who prospers is a perfectly\n  righteous man; the righteous man who is in adversity is not a\n  perfectly righteous man. The wicked man who prospers is not a\n  perfectly wicked man; the wicked man who is in adversity is a\n  perfectly wicked man. Now this [saying of R. Johanan] is in opposition\n  to the saying of R. Meir. For R. Meir said: only two [requests] were\n  granted to him, and one was not granted to him. For it is said: And I\n  will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, although he may not\n  deserve it, And I will show mercy on whom I will show mercy, although\n  he may not deserve it. (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, to whatever extent we can understand the workings of God, the seemingly harsh punishments meted out to the righteous are for good reason.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does \"Elokim\" (\"אלקים\") solve the problem?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Please seriously pardon my lack of Hebrew skills. </p>\n\n<p>If \"א-ל\" is already a shem Hashem (to the point where in many contexts we might say or write \"קל\" - \"Keyl\"), how is it OK to leave the א-ל intact at the beginning of \"אלקים\"? I understand that by changing ה to ק, we have changed the whole name from being an official <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/matters-of-holiness-in-bathroom/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shem Hashem</a>, and have also broken up the potential vov // hey. But the first reason seems insufficient, because many people would redact the word even if it <em>contained</em> a shem Hashem, as it still does.  [For examples of times when we do this, see \"קלי\" (\"Keli\") and \"הללוקה\" (\"Hallelukah\").] </p>\n\n<p>Why don't we do so here?</p>\n\n<p>Similar (not a duplicate): <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35133/why-is-the-hey-in-elo-replaced-with-a-kuf\">Why is the hey in Elo-* replaced with a kuf?</a> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a minhag (which is not backed by Halachah at all, that I know of,) where some people will not say \"ginger ale\"; but instead say \"ginger kale\" for fear of mentioning \"ale\" which sounds like Aleph Lamed , or one of Hashem's names.</p>\n\n<p>Such people can't enjoy a true IPA unless its an IPK :)</p>\n\n<p>Of course this is nonesense, because \"ale\" is a drink and not a name of Hashem as its used.</p>\n\n<p>It would be like me thinking of saying <strong>\"EL\"</strong> and then, worrying about possibly writing or saying a holy name, changing it to <strong>\"ELK\"</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The E-L is still fully there. But, the word is now something similar to <strong>\"MOOSE\"</strong> in its entirety. The possible \"EL\" of \"ELK\" standing alone is disregarded because it has entirely morphed into a portion of a reindeer for all intents and purposes.</p>\n\n<p>Your example of \"Keli\" or \"Hallelukah\" still needs a \"K\" because the word is only, and merely, modified by an added pronoun or a combining of two words into one. \"Kel - ee\" = <em>my</em> G-d , and Hallelu, Kah became combined into \"Hallelukah\".</p>\n\n<p>\"Elokim\", however, is by itself entirely not a word anymore. So, even the beginning \"E-L\" has no meaning. </p>\n\n<p>True, many Jews have names that include Hashem's name. And, some people do put a dash in between the appropriate letters when writing it as a custom. However, most Jews do not to my knowledge, because there is no obligation. This is because the word became someone's name and not a direct reference to Hashem's name anymore. So, it doesn't have that status.</p>\n\n<p>Examples: </p>\n\n<p>Yisroel (someone may write it \"Yisroe-l\")</p>\n\n<p>Yeshayah (someone may write it \"yeshay-ah\")</p>\n\n<p>However, no one writes \"Yisro-kel\" or \"Yeshaykah\", because its someone's name, not Hashem's name.</p>\n\n<p>Certainly, you never hear anyone call their friend \"Yisrokel\" even if they are the type to say \"ginger kale\" which shows why the whole thing is really inconsistent to begin with.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, consider that if people get too strict about this, the phrase \"elohim acherim\" (\"other/false gods\") would end up being written with a \"k\" instead of an \"h\". But, that would certainly be forbidden to do, since it would be honoring and protecting the name used for idolatry!</p>\n\n<p>That's probably one reason why Halachah is pretty clear about only not erasing a real name of Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>(Some of this was already suggested by the OP)</p>\n\n<p>(P.S. I do remember once seeing a Chumash in an old print from Europe, that had the word printed as \"Elokim\" with a \"kuf\" , but also fudged the \"Aleph - Lamed\" so as to be written a little bit merged together. If my memory is correct, there may have been some who held to the minhag the OP is in fact suggesting. :) )</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Sometimes אל doesn’t refer to God at all; it just means <em>these</em>. </p>\n\n<p>For example, Dev. 19:11</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הערים האל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, I think you need not worry.

Ten years later, after some digging by members of his family, he discovers that his maternal great-grandmother was not Jewish.

Isn't it a comparable situation - both involve an ikkar of not eating something? What is different that it is theoretically ok to touch the fruit in Gan Eden, as long as you don't eat it, but it isn't ok to touch the non-Kosher animals?

This is adding which, in the long run, is subtracting (i.e. it turned out badly), because there was no demarcation between God's command and the extra \"fence\". That is, \"this isn't an [appropriate] 'fence' for the Torah <em>because she said God had said 'don't touch it'</em>\". [He doesn't compare it to cases where God said not to touch something, but if any such exist they're different from this in that they were commanded by God. Likewise, \"fences\" built by the rabbis over the years are different from Eve's case in that the rabbis clearly state what's of divine origin and what's theirs.]</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The end of Rashi's comments to Vayikro 11 (8) are:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If so,] what does Scripture mean by, “you shall not touch their\n  carcasses”? [It means that Israelites may not touch animal carcasses]\n  on the Festivals [since at those times they deal with holy sacrifices\n  and enter the Temple].

(<em>Part 1 of Chizkuni</em>) This is the plain\n  meaning of the verse. (<em>This is not  surprising since:</em>) We find that\n  the Torah does forbid (<em>touching</em>) something that is forbidden to eat,\n  i.e. a carcass that did not die through ritual slaughter. (Compare\n  Leviticus 11,8, where the halachic meaning is that it must not be\n  touched when the purpose is to eat it.) (<em>I do not understand this\n  part because it is after all forbidden to eat it! and we have the\n  Gemoro quoted by Rashi which explains that the prohibition of touching\n  is for purity on Yom Tov</em>) </p>\n  \n  <p>(<em>Part 2 of Chizkuni</em>) The truth is that when one adds a restriction\n  to G-d’s commandment, instead of improving it, one causes harm to it,\n  makes it less effective instead of more effective. Seeing that the\n  additional restriction had not been issued by G-d directly, it is less\n  than useless.

(VaYikra 11:8)\", [The expression <em>don't touch it</em> is intended] according to the plain meaning of the text (נגע to touch or strike). And the true [meaning is], all who add [to the commandments], diminish (יגע to weary or to cause trouble to) [the whole Torah]; and this [addition of not touching found here] is not a fence for the Torah since she said that the Holy One, blessed be He said, \"don't touch it.\"</p>\n\n<p>This is referring to the prohibition of being a <em>Ba'al Toseph</em>, one who adds to the mitzvot of the Torah which is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.2?lang=he&aliyot=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:2</a>. The Torah as given by Moshe is perfect and is G-d's will. If one adds anything to it, it is no longer perfect and no longer G-d's will, meaning it is diminished.</p>\n\n<p>Chava did not add anything to the Torah. She only repeated what she was taught by her husband, Adam. The commentaries and Midrash emphasize that this extra prohibition of not touching the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was instituted by Adam. Because Chava was not present as a separate individual when G-d gave the commandment.</p>\n\n<p>Only Adam was present (See Bereshit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.16-17?lang=he&aliyot=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:16-17</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.20-24?lang=he&aliyot=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:20-24</a>). She had yet to be built from Adam's body and soul. According to the Torah teaching about reincarnation, when a soul is incarnated into a new body, that new body prevents the soul from having knowledge of the previous incarnation.</p>\n\n<p>The building and formation of Chava was a parallel of the diminishment of the Moon, which was originally the same as the Sun in size and luminosity. (See Bereshit 1:3 which states in the beginning of creation, on the first day, there was a single, unified light [אור], like Adam HaRishon. In Bereshit 1:14-15 it says that on the the fourth day the two great luminaries [מארת, מאורות] were created, like the building of Chava from the original unified Adam HaRishon. The defective spelling suggests that this divided structure of Adam and Chava was less than the original, unified form. But the Mem prefix [מ-אור] also emphasizes that they were from the single unified light. It also indicates that because it can be understood as a verb, that Adam and Chava have the potential to be sources of light to the world. And then, in Bereshit 1:16, the second light was diminished and made into a 'Kli', a vessel that would receive its light from the greater light of the sun. And that is what was done to Chava in Bereshit 3:16.)</p>\n\n<p>And after G-d built Chava from the original, first man, Adam HaRishon, G-d told Adam that he was to teach her, like the Moon receives its light from the Sun. And Adam did not think Chava could be trusted to keep the simple prohibition of not eating, so he taught her not to eat from it, nor even to touch it. She believed that this was what G-d had commanded because Adam told her this. And that error on Adams part, gave the opening to the Nachash to cause Chava to transgress because the Nachash was also present before Chava had been built and formed from Adam HaRishon. It knew what G-d had actually commanded and challenged her on what she said was the prohibition about touching. And when she touched the tree and didn't die, it created a doubt in her mind about the prohibition in general. Her doubt, which was the consequence of Adam adding to G-d's prohibition, precipitated and allowed the sin to occur.</p>\n\n<p>This is what the Chizkuni is discussing, as are all the other classical commentaries you mention.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning your last question about the relationship between the citation in Bereshit and that from VaYikra, it is only about the word usage about touching (נגע). There is no additional meaning. The citation from VaYikra is discussing two ideas. The prohibition against eating (לא תאכלו) those non-kosher animals and the second prohibition about not touching (לא תגעו) the carcass of the non-kosher animal and becoming <em>Tameh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Like the commentaries mention there, the warning about not becoming <em>Tameh</em> was intended only toward the Kohanim (See Shulchan Aruch, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.369?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh De'ah 369</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.373?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">373</a>. Although some suggest that it may be applicable to all Jews at specific times (the three Festivals), as contrasted with the Kohanim, because the Yisraelim are supposed to go to the Temple at the time of the three Festivals; the constant warning against becoming Tameh (The prohibition mentioned in VaYikra 11:8 is undifferentiated as to when it applies. That means on the simplest level that it means continuously, just like the prohibition against eating non-kosher animals is understood to be continuous.) only applies to Kohanim because they were involved with Temple service constantly.</p>\n\n<p>This concept about Tumah as it applies to Yisraelim (particularly in the present) is discussed by the Lubavitcher Rebbe in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15950&st=&pgnum=412\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">volume 3 of his Igrot Kodesh, page 374-375 beginning at paragraph 3</a>.</p>\n\n<p>And that detail, that this warning in VaYikra 11:8 about <em>Tumah</em> is intended for the Kohanim, is found in the Oral portion of the Torah which was also given by Moshe Rabbeinu. It is not an addition to the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Blessing \"אשר חלק מכבודו\" on father or Rabbi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemmorah in Kiddushin (30b) brings the idea of the analogy between honoring Hashem and honoring one's father (and mother).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ת\"ר נאמר (שמות כ, יב) כבד את אביך ואת אמך ונאמר (משלי ג, ט) כבד את ה' מהונך השוה הכתוב כבוד אב ואם לכבוד המקום</p>\n<p>The Sages taught that it is stated: “Honor your father and your mother” (Exodus 20:11), and it is stated: “Honor the Lord with your wealth” (Proverbs 3:9). In this manner, the verse equates the honor of one’s father and mother to the honor of the Omnipresent, as the term “honor” is used in both cases.</p>\n<p>וכן בדין ששלשתן שותפין בו ת\"ר שלשה שותפין הן באדם הקב\"ה ואביו ואמו בזמן שאדם מכבד את אביו ואת אמו אמר הקב\"ה מעלה אני עליהם כאילו דרתי ביניהם וכבדוני</p>\n<p>And so too, the equating of one’s attitude toward his parents to his attitude toward God is a logical derivation, as the three of them are partners in his creation. As the Sages taught: There are three partners in the forming of a person: The Holy One, Blessed be He, who provides the soul, and his father and his mother. When a person honors his father and mother, the Holy One, Blessed be He, says: I ascribe credit to them as if I dwelt between them and they honor Me as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And many many more analogies. The Gemmorah in Brochos 58a teaches Birkat Hashvakh on seeing a king \"בא\"ה אמ\"ה שחלק מכבודו ליראיו\".</p>\n<p><strong>Why this (or a similar) Brocho is not used for seeing/honoring the father, whose honor also \"stems\" from Hashem's</strong>?</p>\n<p>Interestingly, some say that the blessing on a king stems from his ability to sentence to death (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/39040/secret-ops-the-president-and-the-blessing-on-a-king\">blessing-on-a-king</a>, but both father or Rabbi \"can freely\" kill a kid (הלכות רוצחים, they are not allowed but exempt from punishment)</p>\n<p><em>Note, this is different from saying Birkat Hamitzvot on the Mitzvah of honoring, which is not said \"because\" the father can forgive his respect.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While the wording of the Bracha seems to be quite generic, and based on the pure definition alone one would think it would apply to anyone who Hashem commands us to respect, the Bracha is actually only applied to a specific subset of people (namely, an absolute monarch). The fact that Hashem commands us to respect others does not directly correlate to saying that Bracha.</p>\n\n<p>For example, not all rulers are created equal. There are certain criteria that need to be fulfilled for one to say the Bracha upon seeing a ruler that, if it doesn't apply to that ruler, one does not say the Bracha. One such example is that the ruler has to have the ability of absolute life and death over his subjects<sup>1</sup> (i.e. has the lawful ability to sentence someone to death).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, while there may be many different people who Hashem commands us to honor for several different reasons (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.224.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">and indeed, some might have different Brachos that apply to them</a>), this Bracha for this scenario is limited only to an absolute ruler.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<ol>\n<li>I want to say the source is in the Teshuvos Radvaz, but I have limited access to sources right now.

    "content": "# How do religious Orthodox Jews reconcile their calendar with the Darwinian theory of evolution?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a genuine question. I'm curious because I read somewhere that even the most religious Orthodox Jews accept the Darwinian theory of evolution, and that even they don't believe dinosaurs lived in the same time period as humans. Is this true? If so, how do they explain the fact that the calculations of the Jewish calendar are the same as the calculations used by young earth creationists to argue that the universe is 6,000 years old? If religious Orthodox Jews don't believe that the universe is 5,778 years old, then what do they mean when they say that we are in the year 5,778? On the other hand, if religious Orthodox Jews do believe that the universe is 5,778 years old, then how can evolution be true since it requires billions of years to take place?</p>\n\n<p>My question is NOT \"Do Jews believe in evolution?\" or \"Do Jews believe in young earth creationism?\" or \"Do Jews believe in the coexistence of dinosaurs and humans?\"</p>\n\n<p>Rather, my question is more specifically about how evolutionist Jews reconcile their Jewish calendar (which seems to imply that the universe is 5,778 years old) with the Darwinian theory of evolution.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The short answer is that most Orthodox Jews either:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't accept evolution.</li>\n<li>Accept it but assume that the calendar only starts counting from Adam, not from the true beginning of the world.</li>\n<li>Think there is some reconciliation that we're not aware of.</li>\n<li>Think the calendar does not accurately reflect the age of the world.</li>\n<li>Don't know/care enough to be bothered by this.</li>\n<li>Have some other variation similar to some of the above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, any calendar starts from an arbitrary <em>zero point</em>. Thus, the calendar that we follow begins from the time given in Bereishis as the creation of Adam. That is, Adam was created on Rosh hashanah (new year's day) of year \"0\", \"1\", or \"2\" (depending on how the previous <em>year</em> is counted). The calendar is then built up using the years shown in the Torah (the flood in 1656, Abraham born in 1948, Exodus in 2448, etc.). This then leads to the date of 5778 in secular year 2018 (conversion factor of 3760). It has nothing to do with the age of the universe. </p>\n\n<p>I give a summary of the dates involved at <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/47308/how-old-is-the-earth/86872#86872\">How old is the Earth?</a></p>\n\n<p>I also explain how the Hebrew calendar years match the secular years at <a href=\"https://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2015/05/rabbi-leibtag-shiurim-hebrew-calendar.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Leibtag shiurim: The Hebrew Calendar and its Missing Years- Parts 1 - 3</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Another point, is that the <em>apparent</em> age of the universe has nothing to do with the actual age of the universe, as creation would start with the universe <strong>apparently</strong> as old as the <em>scientific</em> physical evidence would show. That is trees (as stated in the Torah) were created bearing fuit and so would appear to be as old as needed. Herds of animals were created with an appropriate mixture of ages.

It is true that our sources discuss various philosophical and scientific facts, but all those are just like a dessert for the main course of the Jewish Law, in other words, to make it a little bit more fun to study.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Those discussions have no practical implementation in the Jewish Law</strong> whatsoever, therefore the Orthodox Jews can have any personal opinions on them.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud relates that an extremely poor person lived in the neighbourhood of Mar Ukva, one of the Rabbis of the Talmud. The Rabbi would daily leave four coins behind the pauper's door so that the pauper did not know who his benefactor was. In this way, he would not be embarrassed if he met him. However, the pauper was curious to know who was being so kind to him. One day he decided to wait for his benefactor to arrive, so that he could catch him in the act and see who he was. That particular day, says the Talmud, Mar Ukva was late for the study hall and when he delivered the coins he was walking together with his wife. When the pauper saw the coins being delivered, he came out to see who was there. Mar Ukva and his wife sensed that they were being followed so they ran away and jumped into a hot stone oven to hide there. Mar Ukva's feet started to burn on the stones, whereas his wife's feet were unharmed. His wife said to him, \"Put your feet on mine\" and in this way he was saved from further burns. But Mar Ukva felt bad that this miracle had only happened to his wife and not to him. She explained to him that she merited this miracle because the level of loving kindness of her charity was greater than his. \"I am at home and I provide food for the needy to eat immediately. But you give them money and they have to go themselves and buy food.\" Asks the Talmud, \"Why did Mar Ukva and his wife have to run and hide in a hot stone oven?\" The Talmud answers, \"Because a person should rather let oneself get thrown into a burning furnace than put another person to shame\".</p>\n\n<p>source shemayisrael.com</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Koheles Rabba 11,1 describes the piety of Rabbi Elazar ben Shamua the Tanna accorded to a poor gentile who had lost everything:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן שָׁמוּעַ הֲוָה מְטַיֵּיל עַל כֵּיף יַמָּא רַבָּה, חֲמָא אִילְפָא דְּמִיטָרְפָא בְּיַמָּא, כַּהֲרִיפַת עַיִן טְבַעַת וּטְבַע כָּל מַה דַּהֲוָה בָּהּ, חֲמָא חַד גְּבַר דִּיתֵיב עַל קוּרְשָׁא דִּסְפִינְתָּא, מִגַּלָּא לְגַלָּא סְלֵיק לְיַבֶּשְׁתָּא כַּד הוּא הֲוָה עַרְטִילָאי, וַהֲוָה מִיטַּמַּר בְּכֵיף יַמָּא הֲוָה עַל רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן שָׁמוּעַ שֶׁבַע אִיצְטַלְוָון, שְׁלַח חַד וְיַהֲבֵיהּ לֵיהּ, אוֹבְלֵיהּ לְבֵיתֵיהּ וְאוֹכְלֵיהּ וְאַשְׁקֵיהּ וִיהַב לֵיהּ תְּרֵין מָאוָון דִּינָרִין, וְאַרְכְּבֵיהּ אַרְבְּעָה עֲשַׂר פַּרְסִין, וַעֲבַד לֵיהּ יְקָרָא סַגִּי עַד דְּאַעְלֵיהּ לְבֵיתֵיהּ. לְבָתַר יוֹמִין מֵת קֵיסָר הָרָשָׁע וְאֵימַנּוֹ לֵיהּ מַלְכָּא תְּחוֹתֵיהּ אָמַר לֵיהּ אִית עִמִּי אַרְבַּעַת אַלְפִין דִּינָרִין, סַב יַתְהוֹן וְאִיתְרַחַם עֲלֵיהוֹן. אֲמַר לֵיהּ אַרְבְּעָה אַלְפִין הַלָּלוּ יְהוֹן לָךְ יְהִיבִין חֲלַף תְּרֵין מָאוָון דִּיהַבְתְּ לִי, וּמְדִינְתָּא כּוּלָּהּ תְּהֵא מִשְׁתַּזְּבָא בְּגִינָךְ, חֲלַף מֵיכְלָא וּמִישְׁתְּיָא דְּאוֹכֵלְתְּ וְאַשְׁקֵת יָתִי. וְעוּל לְבֵי גְּעָא וְגִנְזֵי דִּידִי וְסַב לָךְ שַׁבְעִין אִיצְטַלְוָון דִּלְבוּשָׁן, חֲלַף אִיצְטְלָא דִּיהַבְתְּ לִי, וְזִיל בִּשְׁלָם עַל אוּמָּתָךְ וְאַשְׁבִּיקִין בְּגִינָךְ, וּקְרוֹן עֲלוֹי: שַׁלַּח לַחְמְךָ עַל פְּנֵי הַמָּיִם    </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Elazar Ben Shamua was strolling on the sea side, he saw a boat sinking in the sea and one man survived by grabbing hold of a wooden plank and slowly floated on the waves till he reached the shore.

The sages were asked similar questions by the philosophers of Ancient Greece and Rome.</p>\n\n<p>Pesochim 94a is a good example of such dispute, where R' Yehuda easily admits that the scientific approach sounds better than our Sages' (<a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/TheSunsPathAtNight.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>an extensive explanation here</a>, thnx DoubleAA</em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"תנו רבנן שנו חכמים: חכמי ישראל אומרים: גלגל קבוע ומזלות חוזרים וחכמי אומות העולם אומרים: גלגל חוזר ומזלות קבועין. וכו' אמר רבי: <strong>נראים דבריהם מדברינו</strong> שביום מעיינות צוננים ובלילה מעיינות רותחים\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The Jewish Sages say that during the day the sun travels beneath the firmament and is therefore visible, and at night it travels above the firmament. And the sages of the nations of the world say that during the day the sun travels beneath the firmament, and at night it travels beneath the earth and around to the other side of the world. <strong>Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: And the statement of the sages of the nations of the world appears to be more accurate than our statement.</strong> A proof to this is that during the day, springs that originate deep in the ground are cold, and during the night they are hot compared to the air temperature, which supports the theory that these springs are warmed by the sun as it travels beneath the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If I'm not mistaken, <strong>the Sages' position is based on the Oral tradition</strong>, otherwise, there would be no point in such a dispute. And nevertheless, Rabbi discarded the tradition in favor of the empirical science.</p>\n\n<p>There are numerous other, \"pseudo-scientific\" statements by our Sages, for example, <a href=\"http://www.rationalistjudaism.com/2009/07/snake-gestation.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">snake gestation period of 7 years</a> (Bechoros 8a), <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4751/apologetics-for-marriage-at-3-years-old\">regrowing hymen before age of 3</a> (Niddah 45a) and more. Some of them (the former) are purely theoretical, but some (the later) are bases for various Halachic decisions.</p>\n\n<p>What does R' Yehudah's statement mean in general terms (not concerning this specific claim)? How can he discard the Sages' oral tradition in favor of scientific theories? </p>\n\n<p>And does his example let us do the same - in case of a discrepancy between our Sages' claims and the current science - to accept current scientific theories over our tradition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> addresses this in <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 2:8.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must not find it strange that Aristotle differs here from the\n  opinion of our Sages. The theory of the music of the spheres is\n  connected with the theory of the motion of the stars in a fixed\n  sphere, and our Sages have, in this astronomical question, abandoned\n  their own theory in favour of the theory of others. Thus, it is\n  distinctly stated, \"The wise men of other nations have defeated the\n  wise men of Israel.\" <strong>It is quite right that our Sages have abandoned\n  their own theory: for speculative matters every one treats according\n  to the results of his own study, and every one accepts that which\n  appears to him established by proof.</strong> (<a href=\"http://sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp095.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my\n  emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 3:14, Rambam further explains that in astronomical matters the Sages were not quoting traditions, but were using their own analysis or relying on contemporary science:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You must, however, not expect that everything our Sages say respecting\n  astronomical matters should agree with observation, for mathematics\n  were not fully developed in those days: <strong>and their statements were not\n  based on the authority of the Prophets, but on the knowledge which\n  they either themselves possessed or derived from contemporary men of\n  science.</strong> But I will not on that account denounce what they say\n  correctly in accordance with real fact, as untrue or accidentally\n  true. On the contrary, whenever the words of a person can be\n  interpreted in such a manner that they agree with fully established\n  facts, it is the duty of every educated and honest man to do so.\n  (<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp150.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As Rabbi Dr. Natan Slifkin writes in his essay, <em><a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/TheSunsPathAtNight.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Sun’s Path at Night</a></em>, the belief was not just Oral tradition, but also Babylonian (secular, scientific) cosmology.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As we shall later demonstrate from both general history as well as the\n  interpretations of the Geonim and Rishonim, the view of the Sages of Israel was that of ancient Babylonian cosmology.1</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, this is Babylonian vs. Ptolmaic cosmology.</p>\n\n<p>Scientific understandings of the world can have effect on halacha, and it makes sense that an earlier cosmology was a matter to enter the Oral tradition, to be passed down to subsequent generations. And Chazal then operated within that framework, and considered it part of the Oral tradition of the way the world worked. That does not mean that, if they were to encounter a new theory in a new culture, they would not consider its possible validity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Abarbanel in his commentary to Bereshit seems to say that this was simply the tradition of the times (and thus we shouldn't read too much into the fact that Chazal got it wrong).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא תחשוב שלחסרון חכמת חכמינו נפלו באותו דעת, ראיתי להודיעך פה מה\n  שראיתי בדרוש זה כפי קדומי פלוסופיהם. והוא שפליניא\"ו פילוסוף קדום בספר\n  טבעי הנמצאים שהוא ספר יקר מאוד אצל חכמי האומות כתב דברים זה סגנונם</p>\n  \n  <blockquote>\n    <p>בין השמים והארץ ילכו שבעה כוכבי הנבוכה באמצע האויר, וביניהם\n    רחק מה. ובאמצעותם ילך השמש הגדול והיכול המושל לא בלבד בזמנים ובארץ.\n    אבל גם בכוכבי הנבוכה בשמים, כי הוא המכסה אותם והנותן להם אור. ומי\n    שיציירהו ראוי שישפוט שהוא נפש כל העולם ונשמתו, והמנהיג האלהי אשר לטבע\n    הוא השליט הגדול מיד האל, רואה ושומע כל הדברים כפי מה שיראה שר האותיות</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>עד כאן. ושנה ושלש הדעת הזה בספרו פעמים. ומסכים לזה כתב פילוט\"ינו\n  תלמידו מתלמידי ארסטו וגדול מגדוליהם שחבר ספרים בכל הפלוסופיא. כי הוא\n  כתב בביאור שלא היו המאורות חלקי הגלגלים, ולא קבועים בהם, אבל היו\n  הכוכבים הנבוכים מהלכים באויר בין השמים והארץ. והגלגלים הם נחים לא\n  מהלכים. עד כאן.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ומזה תדע שהיה הדעת הזה מקובל בימים ההם</strong>, ולפחות היה הדבר בספק אצל קצתם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Although some verses earlier (Shmot 33,11) Torah does say\n\" וְדִבֶּר ה' אֶל מֹשֶׁה פָּנִים אֶל פָּנִים כַּאֲשֶׁר יְדַבֵּר אִישׁ אֶל רֵעֵהוּ\").

Because I have seen the angel of the L-rd face to face.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"Alas\" is an expression of worry at seeing an angel as if to say \"What will become of me?\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>2) Judges 13: 21-22 \"And the angel of the L-rd did not continue to appear to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the L-rd. And Manoah said to his wife, \"We shall surely die, because we have seen an angel.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew word used by Manoah for what he saw, is \"Elohim\", which can simply be used as G-d's name. However, Targum Yonathan translates it as \"an angel of G-d\"</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, here too in the OP's verse in Genesis 32:31, saying Yaakov saw an \"Elohim\" face to face, should also be translated as an angel of G-d. (see Targum Onkelos and Targum Yonathan, who explain this here as well.)</p>\n\n<p>However, the OP questions why Yaakov would be afraid of seeing an angel? Perhaps Gideon and Manoah were not so used to seeing angels? But Yaakov Avinu was probably used to seeing them often (example: The \"ladder\" dream, Gen. 29:12; Gen. 32:2-3) as may be inferred by the following Medrash brought by Rashi in his comment to Gen. 16:13 which speaks of Hagar's lack of fear when seeing an angel of G-d. :</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"...And you should know that she (Hagar) was accustomed to seeing them (angels), because Manoah saw the angel once and said, “We will surely die,” and this one saw four, one after the other, and she was not frightened. — [from Gen. Rabbah 45:7]\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>So why would Yaakov be more worried to see the face of an angel than Hagar?</p>\n\n<p>First of all, lets see if there is a general danger with encountering an angel and then lets see if there is a specific issue with Yaakov and this particular angel?</p>\n\n<p><strong>A) \"...in order not to afford them an opportunity to see the angels performing their destructive work as angels when there was no need for them to witness this. Watching divine beings in action and being saved by such spectacles requires Divine intervention and should therefore be avoided. Compare the awe with which Manoach comments on what he has seen in Judges 13,22, as well as Yaakov’s reaction in Genesis 32,31 after his wrestling match with the angel of Esau.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Rashbam to Gen. 19:17 commenting on why Lot and his fleeing family were told not to look back.)</p>\n\n<p><strong>B) Exodus 23:20 \"Behold, I am sending an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Beware of him and obey him; do not rebel against him, for he will not forgive your transgression, for My Name is within him. For if you hearken to his voice and do all that I say, I will hate your enemies and oppress your adversaries. For My angel will go before you, and bring you to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hivvites, and the Jebusites, and I will destroy them.\"</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains: \"for he will not forgive your transgression: He is not accustomed to that [i.e., forgiving], for he is of the group that do not sin. And moreover, he is a messenger, and he can do only his mission. -[From Midrash Tanchuma 18]</p>\n\n<p>Here we see that an angel is hard to deal with because it is only capable of pure justice; and it must simply perform its mission. Now when such a being is fully invested with \"G-d's name\" (Elokim is the Divine name which represents   G-d's justice; and Yaakov's wrestling angel is referred to as \"Elohim\"), it is like facing off against justice to perfection, with no mercy and no adjournment. Now we can start to sense why someone would be afraid.</p>\n\n<p>Now let's see if Yaakov Avinu had anything to be especially afraid of when confronting (face to face) this angel?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gen 32:25 \"Jacob was left alone. And a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains: \"Our Rabbis of blessed memory explained that he was Esau’s guardian angel\" (Genesis Rabbah 77:3).</p>\n\n<p>Now, OK, so its Esau's angel, big deal right? Guess again:</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"as it is said: And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him (Genesis. 32:25). It was Samael, Esau’s guardian angel, who wanted to kill him, as is said: When he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched the hollow of his thigh (ibid., v. 26).</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>(Tanchuma Rabbah, 8:3)</p>\n\n<p>OK, so the guy's name is \"Samael\" or the famous \"Samech - Mem\" (Sam). AND he wants to kill Yaakov. So, should we be impressed? How tough is this \"Sam\" anyway?</p>\n\n<p><strong>\"And the woman beheld Samael, the angel of death, and was afraid; yet she knew that the tree was good to eat...\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Targum Yonathan to Gen. 3:6)</p>\n\n<p>So, Esau, being the wicked fellow, has somehow attracted the very primordial angel of death himself, to be his own personal bodyguard/lawyer. We also see that this frightening agent, has been allowed to target Yaakov, at night, and all alone, in the middle of nowhere, with full intent on killing him. And of course, the angel of death is probably the best guy to hire, if you want to kill someone.</p>\n\n<p>But, why would Esau be able to harness G-d's justice ? what merit could he have to persuade Heaven that he should be allowed access to such an advocate? Furthermore, was Yaakov afraid of some sin?</p>\n\n<p><strong>a) Gen. 32:11 \"I have become small from all the kindnesses and from all the truth that You have rendered Your servant, for with my staff I crossed this Jordan, and now I have become two camps.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>Rashi: \"I have become small: My merits have diminished because of the kindnesses and the truth that You have rendered me. Therefore, I fear lest I have became sullied with sin since [the time that] You promised me, and it will cause me to be delivered into Esau’s hand[s]. — [from Shab. 32a, Ta’anith 20b]</p>\n\n<p><strong>b) Gen. 27:36 \"And he said, \"Is it for this reason that he was named Jacob? For he has deceived me twice; he took my birthright, and behold, now he has taken my blessing.\" And he said, \"Have you not reserved a blessing for me?\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>So we see from here that Yaakov Avinu was generally afraid that his sins have taken away his own Divine protection, and that his brother Esau has always had a complaint of injustice against him for \"stealing\" his birthright and \"stealing\" their father's blessings even though Esau was the firstborn son.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the whole Genesis 32 (which culminates in the wrestling match with the angel) is the story of Yaakov facing his brother Esau after many years of absence. Yaakov knew that there were still ill feelings against him over the birthright and blessings. That is why he sends tribute to Esau as a peace offering. However, Esau responds by marching on Yaakov with military force.</p>\n\n<p>The night before they meet, Esau spiritually files a claim against Yaakov in Heaven, which results in Divine justice allowing for a trial. Yaakov understands that he must \"face\" his brother's claim and defends himself by saying the sale of the birthright was honest and legal, plus the taking of the blessings was warranted because Esau planned to renege on his sale. </p>\n\n<p>But Yaakov didn't know he would be found innocent by G-d.</p>\n\n<p>The result however, was that the angel of Esau blesses Yaakov:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gen 32:29 \"And he said, \"Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but Israel, because you have striven with [an angel of] G-d and with men, and you have prevailed.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>By no longer calling him Yaakov, the guardian angel of Esau admits that Yaakov did not trick Esau. (the word Yaakov can mean \"trickster\". see Gen. 27:36 above) </p>\n\n<p>by calling Yaakov, Yisrael; he admits that Yaakov dealt honestly. (Yisrael can be read as \"Yashar-El\" or \"The straight one of G-d\".</p>\n\n<p>So when Yaakov says he saw the angel's face, he means he faced his brother's spiritual and legal complaints before G-d, and he emerged innocent. As Yaakov says to Esau when they meet the next morning:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Gen 33:10 \"Thereupon Jacob said, \"Please no! If indeed I have found favor in your eyes, then you shall take my gift from my hand, because I have seen your face, which is like seeing the face of an angel, and you have accepted me.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>R' Chama B'Rabbi Chanina said:.... He (Yaakov) said to him (Esau), \"Your face looks like the face of your angel.\"</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Shir HaShirim Rabbah 3:6)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. :)</p>\n\n\n",

One makes <em>kiddush</em> in the <em>sukkah</em> in order to recite <em>shehecheyanu</em> in the <em>sukkah</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.639.35?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 639:35</a> quotes opinions that do not allow one to recite the blessing of <em>leisheiv basukkah</em> under such circumstances. He therefore advises one to wait to recite <em>kiddush</em> (for an hour or two, or possibly even until midnight) because:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פן יעבור הגשם דאם יעבור יכנס לסוכה ויברך ברכת לישב בסוכה ויאכל ויוצא בזה המ\"ע לכו\"ע</p>\n  \n  <p>Maybe the rain will clear, and if it does, he can then go into the <em>sukkah</em>, make the blessing of <em>leisheiv basukkah</em> and eat and thus fulfill the biblical <em>mitzvah</em> according to all opinions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I don't understand why one needs to wait to eat. Why can't you make <em>kiddush</em> in the <em>sukkah</em> and simply omit <em>leisheiv</em>? Then eat the entire meal in the house (assuming one can obviate issues with <em>kiddush bimkom seudah</em>). Then wait as long as you can (perhaps until midnight) for the rain to stop, in which case you  return to the <em>sukkah</em>, recite <em>leisheiv</em> and eat a <em>kezayit</em> of bread. If the rain doesn't stop, then, before you go to sleep, simply eat a <em>kezayit</em> of bread in the <em>sukkah</em> in the rain, without <em>leisheiv</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of this method is that this doesn't interfere with one's <em>simchat yom tov</em> (a concern Mishnah Berurah himself worries about in this very same paragraph.)</p>\n\n<p>One issue I can see with this method is that you are reciting <em>shehecheyanu</em> during <em>kiddush</em> on the <em>sukkah</em> at a time when you may be exempt from the <em>mitzvah</em>. However, as Mishnah Berurah points out in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.639.36?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">next paragraph</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דאפילו אם נימא דפטור אז מסוכה מ\"מ יוצא בזה דלא גריע ד\"ז מאלו בירך שהחיינו בחול בשעת עשייה בסוכה דיוצא בזה</p>\n  \n  <p>Even if we say that one was exempt at that time [when he said <em>shehecheyanu</em> in the <em>sukkah</em> while it was raining on the first night], he has nevertheless fulfilled his obligtion. This is because it is no worse than had he recited <em>shehecheyanu</em> before <em>yom tov</em> when he built the <em>sukkah</em>, in which case one has fulfilled the obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The peninei Halacha says (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למנהג אשכנז, העומד לאכול שיעור שחייבים לאוכלו בסוכה, מברך על אכילתו 'לישב בסוכה'. לפיכך, המתכוון לאכול פת או מזונות כשיעור יותר מנפח 'ביצה', יחד עם הברכה על האוכל מברך 'לישב בסוכה'. ומי שאינו מתכוון לאכול כשיעור זה במשך כל שהייתו הנוכחית בסוכה, יברך 'לישב בסוכה' גם על טעימה כל שהיא של מזונות או יין או מאכל חשוב אחר. ואף שיש בזה עוד מנהגים, כך ראוי לנהוג.</p>\n<p>According to the ashkenazi custom, one who plans to eat an amount that one must eat in the sukkah (ie kebeitza) blesses “leishev besukkah”. Therefore if one plans to eat more than on kebeitza of bread or mezonos, says leishev besukkah in addition to the blessing on the food. But one who doesn’t plan on eating a kebeitza during this whole time in the sukkah, says “leishev besukkah” on even a small taste (is less than a kebeitza, probably less than a kezayis) of mezonos OR WINE or any other important food. And even though there are other traditions, this is the best way to act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see from here that one may not drink wine while in the sukkah without saying leishev besukkah, if he’s not planning to eat bread or mezonos before leaving (which is exactly the given case).<br />\nFurthermore, the Mishna Berurah prohibits saying Kiddush in the rain, and gives the reason that it is because of the safek of leishev basukkah, which implies that according to the Mishnah Berurah as well, in this case one must say leishev basukkah even on wine according to some opinions, so the safek stands even for wine.</p>\n<p>The same is true in the given case if it continues raining: one may not eat a kezayis of bread in the sukkah without saying leishev besukkah (and one may not say leishev besukkah while it’s raining according to some opinions, as mentioned in the question). Therefore the suggested solution doesn’t work, and we have to wait until the rain clears.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Maybe it depends on how you look at the patur of rain in general and the mitzvah of eating on the first night. See reshimot shiurim by rav Soloveitchik in the second perek where he talks about the mitzvah. דף כה:ישיבה בסוכה :ב</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Unlike the other days of sukos in which one can merely not make a meal outside of the sukkah in the first night there is an obligation to eat a kazeyis of bread in the sukah. For this reason more effort should be made to eat in the sukkah under the conditions that allow you to make the bracha leishev basukah. See talmud sukkah 27a</p>\n\n\n",

Yitzchak Meir Alter</a>, indeed asserts that the Binding of Isaac took place on the first day of Passover, 15 Nissan. Below is the original Hebrew text in which he wrote this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chiddushei HaRim Al HaTorah, Parshat Vayeira</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>יצחק אבינו ע\"ה נעקד בפסח</strong> ונעקדו עמו כל נשמות ישראל ונטהרו וזכו לקשר\n  השבע מדות אל הקדושה בקשר אמיץ בכח העקידה וזהו וישב אברהם בבאר שבע\n  היינו שבע המדות הקדושות ובכח <strong>העקידה שהיתה ביום ט\"ו בניסן</strong> הי' לו ולזרעו\n  אחריו כח קדוש לתקן את השבע דמדות במצות ספירת העומר שהוא שבע שבתות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The parts that I bolded are where he says, respectively:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Isaac our father, peace be unto him, was bound on Passover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Binding, which was on the 15th day of Nissan</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted, though, that this is a rather late source, and does not cite any earlier sources for its claim. The more mainstream view, as I cited in the above mentioned answer, appears to be that the Binding occurred on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana</a> (1st of Tishrei) or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yom Kippur</a> (10th of Tishrei).</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that R. Alter was basing his claim on a passage from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_Rabbah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus Rabba</a> which states in reference to the month of Nissan:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Exodus Rabba Parsha 15</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובו נולד יצחק ובו נעקד</p>\n  \n  <p>And in it Isaac was born, and in it he was bound</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# Waiting 3 hours to eat dairy after eating meat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is it true that there is no true halachic time one must wait to eat dairy after eating meat for Ashkenazim? (Of course, eating it in the same meal is a sin, and is not allowed!) So by waiting 3 hours after eating meat to eat dairy, do I fulfill the Mitzvah of waiting between meat and dairy? Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source you are looking for is the Rema's (Rabbi Moshe Isserles) commentary for Ashkenazim on the Shulchan Aruch. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De'ah.89.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 89:1</a></p>\n\n<p>It starts with the opinion of R' Yosef Karo (Tzefardim usually follow him.):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>One who eats meat</strong>, even of a wild animal or fowl, <strong>does not eat\n  cheese afterwards</strong> <strong>until he waits six hours</strong>. Even if he waits\n  that period, if he has meat between his teeth he has to remove it. One\n  who chews food for a child has to wait.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rema then comments by saying that some hold you do not need to wait any amount of time at all from meat to milk. Then he says the Ashkenazi custom he is familiar with in his locale is 1 hour. Finally at the end, he does endorse the 6 hour time frame used by R' Yosef Karo.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...There are those that says that <strong>he doesn't have to wait</strong> six\n  hours, <strong>but rather immediately</strong> if he finishes the (meat) meal and\n  says the concluding blessing, <strong>it is permissible</strong> after wiping and\n  rinsing his mouth (Tosafot Hullin 105a - \"At the next meal\", Mordechai\n  chapter 25, Haga'ot Ashri, Haga'ot Maimoniot chapter 9 of forbidden\n  foods, and Ravya). <strong>The simple custom in our countries is to wait\n  after eating meat one hour and to eat cheese afterwards</strong>, but you\n  have to say the concluding blessing after the meat (HaAruch, Haga'ot\n  Shaarei Dura) because then it's like a new meal and permissible to eat\n  according to the lenient view. But with no blessing, waiting alone\n  does no good. It doesn't matter if you waited before the blessing or\n  afterwards (his own reasoning, from the Mahari, as opposed to the\n  Issur v'Heter). If he finds meat between his teeth after the hour, he\n  has to pull it out (his own reasoning, from the Ran above). And there\n  are those that say not to say the concluding blessing in order to eat\n  cheese (Aruch in the name of Maharach) but we're not careful about\n  this. <strong>And some are careful to wait six hours after eating meat\n  before eating cheese, and it's proper to do so.</strong>\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the Shulchan Aruch does not mention a concept of 3 hours. It is either nothing, 1 hour, or six hours.</p>\n\n<p>However, other authorities say or suggest other amounts of time in between 0 - 6 hours. If you just wanted to know if there is an opinion that you only need 0 or 1 hour for Ashkenazim, then yes, there is such an opinion. Your concept of 3 hours certainly fulfills the more lenient opinions which require less waiting time.</p>\n\n<p>Origin (sources) of the three hour wait can be found discussed here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/77114/sources-for-3-hour-time-limit-not-rb-yerucham/77157#77157\">Sources for 3 hour time limit (not Rb. Yerucham)</a></p>\n\n<p>As always, this answer is for learning purposes. If someone has a true question about how many hours they should or should not be waiting between meat and milk, they should consult their personal Orthodox Rabbi for guidance on what is right for them.</p>\n\n\n",

G-d allowed room for his creations to innovate and better themselves.</p>\n\n<p>If a custom beautifies a mitzvah (decorating a Torah with silver adornments) it is derived by the Talmud from the verse expounded by Ex. 15:2 \"This is my G-d, and I will glorify Him.\" (see Shabbos 133b and Babba Kama 9b)</p>\n\n<p>If a chumrah is attached to a mitzvah of some sort, then its category derives from that mitzvah. For instance, those who only eat gefilte fish on Shabbos (as opposed to whole fish) because they do not wish to accidentally remove bones on Shabbos, are keeping a custom that is a chumrah which is obviously linked to the greater mitzvah of Shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes a Jewish custom is related to \"holiness\" relating to the mitzvah in VaYikra 19:2 \"Speak to the entire congregation of the children of Israel, and say to them, You shall be holy, for I, the L-rd, your G-d, am holy.\"</p>\n\n<p>On this mitzvah, our Rabbis comment:</p>\n\n<p>\"Sanctify yourself with that which is permitted to you\" </p>\n\n<p>(Talmud Tractate Yevamot 20a)</p>\n\n<p>In general, Jewish custom is considered \"Torah\" as Tosafos says in Talmud Menachos 20b (\"Nifsal\") \"The custom of our fathers is considered to be Torah.\"</p>\n\n\n",

This reading would not consider the non-anatomic claim of barrels, which he seems to support in the scriptural passage linking maids speaking from new wine (read: over barrels of wine).</p>\n\n<p>If you're looking for more explicit symbolism, R. Yaakov Shulevitz, in his commentary Chevruta, links the barrels to the hymen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הושיבום על פי חבית של יין</strong>, ומי שהיתה <strong>בעולה</strong>, <strong>ריחה</strong> של חבית היין <strong>נודף</strong> ממנה, כיון שפיתחה למטה פתוח, ומי שהיתה <strong>בתולה</strong>, ופיתחה סתום - <strong>אין ריחה נודף</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>They sat them on the opening of a barrel of wine, and the one who was a non-virgin, her breath would smell like the wine from the barrel of wine - <strong>meaning to say that her opening below was open</strong>, and <strong>for the virgin it would be closed</strong>, or \"her breath did not smell like wine\" (Yevamot 60b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, R. Shulevitz seems to suggest a symbolic equivalence (or perhaps a euphemism), in which the virgin's hymen is likened to a barrel of wine, unbroken and preserved. One might further link the color wine to the blood that chazal mark as an indicator of non-virginity, a euphemism for orifices, or perhaps that sitting on a wine barrel allows for an easier inspection. </p>\n\n<p>Whatever the case, if understood literally, it should be noted that a simple reading of the rest of this gemara illustrates that this practice is disturbing. As the scholar Michael Rosenberg writes in his work <em>Signs of Virginity: Testing Virgins and Making Men in Late Antiquity</em>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fact that the sage needed to verify the tradition he had received for testing virginity...introduces doubt to the reader's mind. Rabban Gamliel b. Rabbi had \"heard\" of this tradition, but he had never \"seen\" it put into practice. If this tradition might not be reliable, what other received practices for determining a woman's virginity might not be reliable?...And the anonymous editorial voice, again in Aramaic (as opposed to the rest of the story), makes this doubt explicit: the reason Rabban Gamliel b. Rabbi added this step in the process, we are told, is because \"<em>perhaps</em> this method is not sufficiently reliable.\" This, Rabban Gamliel b. Rabbi's barrel test is at one and the same time \"objective\" and anxiety-inducing. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Hearing aids\n  amplify sounds so they may be detected by damaged ears. Cochlear\n  implants bypass damaged portions of the ear and directly stimulate the\n  auditory nerve. Signals generated by the implant are sent by way of\n  the auditory nerve to the brain, which recognizes the signals as\n  sound. Hearing through a cochlear implant is different from normal\n  hearing and takes time to learn or relearn. However, it allows many\n  people to recognize warning signals, understand other sounds in the\n  environment, and understand speech in person or over the telephone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a rule that one does not fulfill his obligation of hearing the shofar sound unless he is, in fact, hearing the original sound of the shofar and not an amplified sound or an echo.</p>\n\n<p>I'm uncertain if the sound heard via implants would be considered an \"original\" sound or not, and if that would, thus. qualify a wearer to fulfill the mitzvah of hearing shofar.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This issue is discussed by R. J. David Bleich <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/0050-0066.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>A key quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The crucial halakhic difference between a hearing aid and a cochlear implant is that the latter does not transform electrical current into amplified sound waves. Rather, it enhances auditory perception by producing electronic impulses capable of stimulating either residual nerve receptors in the cochlea or in the eighth cranial nerve directly. It is certainly arguable that, since no intermediate waves are created, the resulting sounds perceived by the brain are to be classified as having been generated by a human voice. An argument to that effect is presented by Dr. Israel Brema in a contribution to Tehumin, XXIV (5764). If that argument is correct, the recipient of a cochlear implant is at no disadvantage with regard to fulfilling mizvot requiring auditory perception.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, according to Dr. Brema (with whose position R.

The Rambam paskens <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Murderer_and_the_Preservation_of_Life.5.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this halacha</a> and does not specify that it only applies at a particular time, only when there's a Sanhedrin, or only when there's a goel hadam actually trying to kill the murderer.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any reason it wouldn't apply nowadays?  I understand that for many years it would have been impossible for most people to travel to Israel, and maybe the assumption was that even if they tried to get there they would fail.  Nowadays, Chevron is not the easiest or safest place to live, but it's definitely possible to live there and people do.</p>\n\n<p>Of the other major cities, Golan is just over the Syrian border and was recently retaken from ISIS by the Syrian government, Shechem is fully under the PA and has no Jews, Ramos is in Jordan, Betzer is also in Jordan and its exact location is unknown, and Kedesh is a ruin, so Chevron is probably the safest (!) choice.  I didn't look into the other 42.</p>\n\n<p>The requirement to stay in these cities <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Murderer_and_the_Preservation_of_Life.7.8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">overrides even pikuach nefesh and the needs of the entire Jewish people</a>, so this question is independent of whether it's politically advisable to maintain a Jewish community in Chevron.</p>\n\n<p>Does an accidental murderer have to go live in Chevron?  And are there any accidental murderers currently living in Chevron or one of the other cities for this reason?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch</a> writes as follows:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sefer HaChinuch Mitzvah # 410</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונוהגת מצוה זו בזמן שישראל על אדמתן וסנהדרין של שבעים ואחד יושבין\n  במקומן המוכן להם בירושלם לדין דיני נפשות</p>\n  \n  <p>And this commandment is operative during the time that Israel is on their land and the\n  Sanhedrin of 71 is sitting in their place that is prepared for them in\n  Jerusalem to judge capital cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minchat_Chinuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Minchat Chinuch</a> in his commentary there explains that this is because the law of exile is equivalent to capital cases in all regards – and capital cases can only be tried when the Sanhedrin is in its place – and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> himself writes that the law of exile is equivalent to capital cases:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוה לגמרי לד\"נ כמו שדיני נפשות אם אין הב\"ד יושבים במקומם אין דנין ד\"נ\n  ה\"נ דיני גלות וע' בר\"מ פי\"א מה' סנהדרין דחשיב החילוקים בין ד\"מ לד\"נ\n  וכ' דח\"ג הן כד\"נ א\"כ לכל הדברים ח\"ג שוים לד\"נ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The statement of Rambam that he is referring to:</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=79&perek=11&halocha=4&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Sanhedrin 11:4</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחד דיני נפשות ואחד דיני מלקיות ואחד דיני גלות הדינים האלו שוים בהן\n  אלא שהמלקות בשלשה ואין אחד מהן בשור הנסקל חוץ מדבר אחד שדינו בעשרים\n  ושלשה</p>\n  \n  <p>All of the same laws that apply to cases involving capital punishment\n  apply also to cases involving lashes and exile, except that cases\n  involving lashes are adjudicated by three judges. None of these\n  distinctions are made with regard to the judgment of an ox that is\n  stoned except for one, that the judgment is adjudicated by 23 judges.

Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The dispute you quote regarding when the world was created is that of R’ Eliezer and R’ Yehoshua, in Rosh HaShanah 10b-12a. At the end of that discussion, the Gemara sticks in this Braisa. Translation is mine; the brackets are from Rashi. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת\"ר חכמי ישראל מונין למבול כר\"א ולתקופה כר' יהושע חכמי אומות העולם מונין אף למבול כר' יהושע:</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages taught in a Braisa: The Jewish scholars count [years from] the Flood [and Creation, etc.] according to R’ Eliezer [who holds that the world was created in Tishrei], and they count the [solar and lunar] cycles according to R’ Yehoshua [who holds that the world was created in Nissan]. The non-Jewish scholars count even [the years from] the Flood [etc.] according to R’ Yehoshua. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi (end of DH Chachmei Yisrael) explains this dichotomy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא משום דסבירא להו בתשרי נברא העולם אלא דתשרי ראש השנה לשנים ובניסן נברא העולם כדקתני:</p>\n  \n  <p>Not because they hold that the world was created in Tishrei, but rather that Tishrei is the Rosh HaShanah for years [and therefore we count years from Tishrei], and in Nissan the world was created [and therefore we count the solar and lunar cycles from Nissan]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

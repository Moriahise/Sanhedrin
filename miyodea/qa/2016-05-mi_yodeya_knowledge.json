    "content": "# Cleaning blood from the temple\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Mosaic Law, blood was to be sprinkled on the alters, before the curtains and other places in the temple. </p>\n\n<p>This would result in many places, especially the curtains, being blood stained if not cleansed regularly.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any mention of if and how the temple was cleaned in The Bible, Jewish literature, or elsewhere? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>It is logical to think that the priests were careful, so that the blood only landed on the floor, and not on the actual curtains.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding <em>Beit HaMikdash</em>, the whole place was covered with aqueducts and water channels from the surrounding rivers/lakes. These would lead the blood (and other remains) outside. </p>\n\n<p>For example, the Mishna in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%94_%D7%95\">Yoma 5, 6</a> talks about the blood flowing away and outside into the Kidron river, and even sold to farmers as fertilizer.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%95%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%94_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%98%D7%96_%D7%99%D7%90-%D7%99%D7%93#.D7.A1.D7.99.D7.9E.D7.9F_.D7.9C.D7.96\">Malbim on <em>Vayikra</em> 16, 14</a> explains the <em>passuk</em> that says \"והזה באצבעו על-פני הכפרת\", in which it may seem that sprinkling is actually on the כפרת. Mainly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מלות \"על פני\" הוא לפעמים על גבו של דבר ממש... ולפעמים הוא נגד גב הדבר... בא ללמד שלא יזה על צד מערב הכפורת, ממש על גבה, רק על פני היינו נגד הגב. ובזה מטה ההזיה לצד קדם, כנגד הכפורת, <strong>והטיפים נופלים בארץ</strong>.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's also a book by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C\">Menasheh Harel</a>, with a whole section discussing \"<a href=\"http://www.kotar.co.il/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=30557029#9.6531.6.default\">המים לטהרה, להיגיינה ולפולחן בבית המקדש בירושלים</a>\" (the water for purification, hygiene and worship in <em>Beit HaMikdash</em> in Jerusalem), in which he discusses this as well.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>To supplement, not supplant, <a href=\"/a/67957\">Cauthon's good answer</a>, I'll note that the <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah\"><em>mishna</em></a> (<em>Midos</em> chapter 3) says that the altar and its ramp would be cleaned every Friday with a cloth, because of the blood. (This is <em>Rabi</em>'s statement, but the commentaries note that he's explaining and not arguing on the other rabbi in the <em>mishna</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>(It's not completely clear to me whether this was a mere wiping or the application of whitewash, though it seems to have been the former. The <em>mishna</em> there discusses \"whitening\" with whitewash (lime) twice yearly with a trowel, and \"whitening\" weekly with a cloth. It's possible, as <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/activity/Mishnah_Middot_3.4/en/Sefaria_Community_Translation\">the Sefaria translator</a> seems to think, that the weekly cleaning was whitewashing also, but I see no indication of such in the commentaries on the <em>mishna</em> and don't assume so; indeed, the <em>Rav</em> says \"היו מקנחים אותן במפה\", which doesn't sound like they used any substance.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In addition to the other answers, we have some evidence that blood did land on the veil in the Holy of Holies when the Kohein Gadol (High Priest) sprinkled it there on Yom Kippur, and that they weren't too good about cleaning it.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=36&daf=17b&format=pdf\">Meilah 17b</a> quotes the sage R' Elazar Bar R' Yose as having seen the curtain in the treasury in Rome, and it had specks of blood on it. This doesn't preclude the possibility of it being cleaned occasionally, but we see that it wasn't wiped away immediately. (The Temple was destroyed 10 months after the last time the Yom Kippur service was preformed.)</p>\n\n<p>Of course, it's natural that this curtain wouldn't be cleaned much, if ever, as no-one else is ever allowed into the Holy of Holies.</p>\n\n\n",

Whereas רודף is in רוצח.</p>\n\n<p>3) There are commentaries that say (cannot recall who right now) that there's a difference between a רודף and a בא במחתרת since they have different intentions (one's to kill, one's to steal) therefore a בא במחתרת is one that isn't out to kill you per say but if he sees you, he will. He will not seek you out though. Whereas a רודף is looking and perusing you to kill you.</p>\n\n<p>4) A רודף we kill because of what he's doing right now, where a בא במחתרת is killed for his further sins.</p>\n\n<p>5) If you can save the נרדף in any way other than killing the רודף, you must (according to most). Is that the same in a case of בא במחתרת? One commentator states that it wouldn't apply in this case because it's dark and therefore since the בא במחתרת is just popping out of the tunnel, the homeowner doesn't have time to think if there's a way to save his life without killing the הא במחתרת and therefore he's allowed to just kill him.</p>\n\n<p>6) Finally, why does the Gemara use the rule: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הבא להורגך השכם להורגו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why wouldn't it say the reason you may kill the בא במחתרת is because he is a רודף?</p>\n\n<p>So with all these questions, although the Gemara says the reason anyone is allowed to kill his is because he a רודף, is he really a רודף? Maybe not a full רודף? </p>\n\n<p>How could one answer all these questions and make this idea of a בא במחתרת make sense?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm afraid I don't understand how 3) is a question. If anything, it seems to be the answer to 1) and 2). Which is to say:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It is human nature for a man to defend his property even at risk of life. The <em>ba bamachteres</em> knows this and still pursues the theft. The assumption is that he would murder the homeowner if confronted. As such, the chidush is that he is indeed treated as a murderous <em>rodef</em> (pursuer), even though that is not his actual goal. Nonetheless, while it is human nature to defend one's property (and as noted by @pcoz) it is also one's right, there is no obligation to confront or kill the thief if one could forfeit one's own property without threatening anyone's life. (Self-defense of property is a right, not an obligation.)</p></li>\n<li><p>For this very reason, the Rambam brings these <em>halachoth</em> separately. The primary law of <em>rodef</em> is one of murder and belongs in <em>hilchoth retzicha</em>. <em>Ba bamachtereth</em>, while indeed understood to be based on the concept of <em>rodef</em>, is both biblically and conceptually a law related to theft and its intentions.</p></li>\n<li><p>(See above.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Again, I'm not sure what you mean. Both are being killed for what they will likely do. The murderer intends to murder and the thief intends to murder if necessary.</p></li>\n<li><p>The concept of <em>yachol l'hatzilo b'echad mei'eivarav</em> - he could save him by (injuring) one of his limbs (without needing to actually kill him) is applicable in both cases. In other words, in a case where the end of saving the victim could be accomplished by other means than actually killing the <em>rodef</em>, then to kill the <em>rodef</em> would itself qualify as murder. Again though, the key distinction is that the homeowner has the right to defend his own property even with the life of the <em>rodef</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%91%D7%90_%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%9D_%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%95#cite_note-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">הבא להורגך השכם להורגו</a> - \"<em>If one comes to kill you, rise early to kill him</em>\" is actually a statement of <em>Chazal</em> (connected to במדבר כ\"ה:יז-יח) that indeed explicates the principle of the <em>rodef</em> (seeבמדבר רבה פרשה כא פסקה ד and מדרש תנחומא פנחס פרק ג‏).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>1) One is not <strong>obligated</strong> to kill a \"רודף\", when there are better ways to save the \"נרדף\" (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%93_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">for example</a>, if you can save him by only harming the \"רודף\", then you must do so, instead of killing him).</p>\n\n<p>2) The reason the <em>gemara</em> allows a person to kill a \"בא במחתרת\" (or at least, one is not punished if he does kill) is because \"הבא להרגך השכם להורגו\" - self-defense.\n <br>The Rambam explains that this is similar to a \"רודף\", since we can think of the \"בא במחתרת\" as one who will indeed kill the homeowner if he confronts him.</p>\n\n<p>5) The <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%91_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>gemara</em></a> says explicitly that if you know for sure that the intruder will not kill you, you are not allowed to kill him. The <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/b209.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam</a> gives an example of a father who is the robber. The son knows that the father will not kill him, so he may not kill the father (and we would not consider him a \"רודף\" in this case).</p>\n\n<p>6) The official reason is \"הבא להרגך - השכם להורגו\". The Rambam explains that this is similar to \"רודף\", in order to understand the reasoning behind this <em>halacha</em>. One can think of this as a special case of a \"רודף\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Reb Elchonon asks, why are you not obliged to let the ba be'machteres steal your money in which case you won't have to kill him?</p>\n\n<p>He says, you are not obliged to let anyone steal your money.

We do not suspect Benei Israel for this \"לא נחשדו ישראל על כך\".</p>\n<p>But if there are strong suspicions, then, automatically, we get a strong prohibition. For example Cutim are suspected.</p>\n<p>Here is an extract of our Tosefta:</p>\n<blockquote>‏\n-ב כֵּיצַד שָׁוֶה לָאֲנָשִׁים. מְטַמֵּא בְלֹבֶן, כָּאֲנָשִׁים. וְנוֹשֵׂא, אֲבָל לֹא נִשָּׂא, כָּאֲנָשִׁים. וְאִמּוֹ יוֹשֶׁבֶת עָלָיו בְּדַם טֹהַר, כָּאֲנָשִׁים. ‏ <b>‏ וְאֵינוֹ מִתְיַחֵד עִם הַנָּשִׁים, כָּאֲנָשִׁים ‏</b>‏. וְאֵינוֹ נִזּוֹן עִם הַבָּנוֹת, כָּאֲנָשִׁים. וּמִתְעַטֵּף, כָּאֲנָשִׁים. וְעוֹבֵר עַל בַּל תַּקִּיף וְעַל בַּל תַּשְׁחִית וְעַל בַּל תִּטָּמֵּא לְמֵתִים, כָּאֲנָשִׁים. וְחַיָּב בְּכָל הַמִּצְוֹת הָאֲמוּרוֹת בַּתּוֹרָה, כָּאֲנָשִׁים: ‏\n<br>\nHe is not entitled to isolate with women, as men are not.\n<br>\n<p>ג כֵּיצַד שָׁוֶה לַנָּשִׁים. מְטַמֵּא בְאֹדֶם, כַּנָּשִׁים. ‏ <b>‏ וְאֵינוֹ מִתְיַחֵד עִם הָאֲנָשִׁים, כַּנָּשִׁים ‏ </b>‏ . וְאֵינוֹ זוֹקֵק לְיִבּוּם, כַּנָּשִׁים. וְאֵינוֹ חוֹלֵק עִם הַבָּנִים, כַּנָּשִׁים. וְאֵין אוֹכֵל בְּקָדְשֵׁי הַמִּקְדָּשׁ, כַּנָּשִׁים. וְאִמּוֹ יוֹשֶׁבֶת עָלָיו בְּדָם טָמֵא, כַּנָּשִׁים. וּפָסוּל מִן הָעֵדוּת, כַּנָּשִׁים. וְאִם נִבְעַל בַּעֲבֵרָה נִפְסַל מִן הַתְּרוּמָה, כַּנָּשִׁים:\n‏\n<br>\nHe is not entitled to isolate with men as women are not.</p>\n</blockquote>\nAs says  @magicker72 the Rambam in Isure Bia chapter 22, Halacha 11 wrote that a man is permitted to stay alone with Tumtum and Androgynos.\n<blockquote>‏\nאַנְדְּרֻגִּינוֹס אֵינוּ מִתְיַחֵד עִם הַנָּשִׁים; וְאִם נִתְיַחַד--אֵין מַכִּין אוֹתוֹ, מִפְּנֵי שְׁהוּא סָפֵק.  אֲבָל הָאִישׁ מִתְיַחֵד עִם הָאַנְדְּרֻגִּינוֹס, וְהַטֻּמְטוֹם.\n‏\n<br>\nAn androgynos cannot enter into privacy with women. If he does, he is not given physical punishment, because his status is doubtful. A man may enter into privacy with an androgynus or a tumtum.\n</blockquote><br>\nThe Kesef Mishne noticed the discrepancy with the Mishna and gives an explanation.<br>\nBut the fact that the Magid Mishne sees on Rambam a citation of the Tosefta is the proof that Rambam had a different version of the Tosefta.\nIn responsa 130 <b>Rabbi Menachem Azaria Mipano</b> wrote, because he is not \"spousable for a man\", men departed from him. And when they see that he can spouse women, they consider it as a male. And Israeli men are not prohibited to enter in privacy with men. There is a broad spectrum of cases. If the androgynos looks so much like a woman, probably, he cannot enter in privacy with men.\nIn the Shut he addressed a Subject in Masechet Yebamot: See Mishna Yebamot 8, 6:\n<blockquote><ul><li>\nרַבִּי יוֹסֵי וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אוֹמְרִים, אַנְדְּרוֹגִינוֹס כֹּהֵן שֶׁנָּשָׂא בַת יִשְׂרָאֵל, מַאֲכִילָהּ בַּתְּרוּמָה.\n‏<br>\nRabbi Jose and Rabbi Simeon stated: if a priest who was an hermaphrodite married the daughter of an israelite, he confers upon her the right to eat terumah. {this was the first opinion of Rabbi Yosi, but in Berayta he changed his view and said that Androgynos is a being apart, and they do not decide what is his gender}\n</li><li>\n רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר, ... אַנְדְּרוֹגִינוֹס נוֹשֵׂא, אֲבָל לֹא נִשָּׂא.\n‏<br>\n<p>Rabbi Judah stated: ... the hermaphrodite may marry [a woman] but may not be married [by a man]. {he is a male and a man which penetrates it in which way is punished for homosexual intercourse.}</p>\n</li><li>\n רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר אוֹמֵר, אַנְדְּרוֹגִינוֹס חַיָּבִים עָלָיו סְקִילָה, כְּזָכָר:‏<br>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer stated: [for copulation] with an hermaphrodite the penalty of stoning is incurred as [if he were] a male.{do not agree with Rabbi Yehuda for an intercourse not typically homosexual}</p>\n</li></ul>\n</blockquote>\n<ul><li>\nIf androgynos looks like a woman he is prohibited in Yichud with men,</li>\n<li>\n and if he has a penis obviously he is prohibited in Yichud with women.</li></ul>\n<p>And he said this also according to Rambam, and despite he holds that in the version of the Tosefta of the Rambam androgynose's Ychud is allowed.<br></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h3>Transgender</h3>\n<ul><li>\nA man who became after an operation similar to a woman is obviously prohibited in Yichud with men.<br>\n<b>In conclusion Ychud with androgynos seems prohibited for a man.</b>\nI assume that transgenders post op. (men who became anatomically similar to women) and androgynes are roughly equivalent from the point of view of Yichud with men. At first glance this seems obvious.\n</li><li>\nOn the other hand, the fact that a male who became after surgery anatomically completely or partially similar to a woman would not be allowed to stand alone with women is less obvious. But if he is technically able to have sexual intercourse with a woman, i.e. penetration with erection (not \"משמש באבר מת\") Yichud is very probably prohibited with women.\n</li><li>\nIf male genitalia were removed, he can not have sexual relationship with women (\"ראוי לביאה או אין ביאתו ביאה\"). Therefore Yichud is allowed. (without being directly linked to Halacha, this recalls of the eunuchs harem wardens).<br><br>\n</li></ul></ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I highly recommend listening to <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/900834\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a> about transgenders in halacha. In summary he quotes Sefer דור תהפוכות page 190 who says a woman who becomes a man should not have yichud with a man since the dinim of yichud is based on how you appear, and a man who becomes a women should not have yichud with other men. The chashash by having yichud, negiah etc is that it might lead to גילוי ערוה, and עריות and once your transgender then you are considered the same gender and therefore there is no issur yichud. The דור תהפוכות doesn't differentiate whether you underwent surgery or not, once you identify as female that shows you are attracted to women not men and therefore yichud with women is allowed. Rabbi Ezra Shwartz basically explains why he thinks the author of דור תהפוכות is wrong since once needs to make distinctions between someone who becomes transgender through cross dressing vs getting surgery. He holds that just cross dressing doesn't make you be considered like the other gender for yichud purposes. But with regards to surgery he quotes שו״ת זית רענן that once someone undergoes surgery to become a female (which is assur מדין סירוס and other prohibitions as well), he has a din of a שכוב, and the אוצר הפוסקים quotes that a שכוב can have yichud with other women.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>In ילקוט יוסף, אוצר דינים לאשה ולבת, פרק נ\"ו, he writes about gender change surgeries. He initially discusses whether a woman would still need a get if her husband had a gender change surgery done and now considered himself a woman. </p>\n\n<p>He then writes regarding the permissibility of performing such a surgery:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועכ\"פ ברור שאסור לאיש לעשות ניתוח כזה, דמלבד שמפקיע מעצמו מצות האיש\n  (אף שיש לעיין דשמא עדיין חייב בכל המצוות כאיש) גם עובר על איסור סירוס,\n  וא\"צ להאריך בזה, ופשוט דהוא אסור ע\"פ ההלכה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, it is forbidden to do the surgery because one will be removing himself from the obligation to do the mitzvos that a man is obligated to do (although he writes that it is possible that he is still obligated to do all the mitzvos incumbent upon men, despite his surgery).</p>\n\n<p>The implication is that by doing the surgery he is effectively a woman and no longer obligated in mitzvos that are specifically for men. Therefore one might thing that Yichud should apply. However he himself is not completely sure as he adds that perhaps the person is still obligated in mitzvos. It is clear however that his primary inclination is that the surgery is effective. </p>\n\n<p>Presumably at least as a safek R' Yosef would rule that Yichud applies.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore we need the explanation of the <em>targum</em> for example that states that \"קדוש קדוש קדוש\" doesn't just mean that Hashem is holy and far away from us, but he is \"קדיש על ארעא\" - holy down on earth as well.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Abudraham explains that this <em>kedushah</em> is here for those who came late to prayer, and missed the regular <em>kedushah</em> of <em>amida</em>. They added the Aramaic translation because in that time that was the spoken language.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rav Natrunai also explains that Aramaic was the spoken language, but that they put this <em>kedushah</em> and its translations there as part of a <em>limud</em> of <em>psukim</em> and Mishna etc. that were done towards the end of the prayer. After some time, the rest was gone, but this part stayed on.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rashi on Sota 49a also gives the same explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סדר קדושה שלא תקנוה אלא שיהו כל ישראל עוסקין בתורה בכל יום דבר מועט שאומר קריאתו ותרגומו והן כעוסקין בתורה...‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>Once, our enemies forbade us from saying <em>kedushah</em>, and they even posted guards during prayer hours to make sure no one does. So the Jews postponed the <em>kedushah</em> to the end of <em>teffilah</em>, when the guards left, and added the Aramaic translation so that it is like two different <em>kedushot</em> replacing the two that were missed. During Shabbat, they could say <em>kedushah</em> in <em>Mussaf</em>, so it doesn't appear in the morning prayer.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Since the <em>midrash</em> discussed in the comments does not explicitly say who is Shaul's the biological father, R' Hirsch speculates that it might be Shechem's, but he does not state that this is his definite opinion (because as we discussed, the source can be interpreted either way, though most do think that Shaul is Shimon's biological son):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושאול בן הכנענית. אם \"כנענית\" זו היא דינה, שנישאה לשמעון (עי' בראשית רבה פ, י), הרי אפשר ששאול איננו בן שמעון, אלא הבן שיולד לדינה משכם; אם כך, הרי גם בן זה לא התנכר למשפחת יעקב. היא נקראת \"כנענית\", שכן בנה - מבחינה גופנית - היה בן של כנעני. נמצא אפוא שכבר אז נהג הכלל, כי בהתחבר בת יעקב עם כנעני - הולד הולך אחר האם (עי' יבמות מה ע\"ב).‏\n  <br><br>If the \"Canaanite\" here is Dinah, who married Shimon (see Bereshit Raba 80, 10), it is possible that Shaul isn't Shimon's son, but rather a son born to Dinah from Shechem. If so, even this son did not estrange himself from Jacob's family. She is called \"Canaanite\" because her son, biologically, was the son of a Canaanite (man). Therefore we can conclude that even then, when a daughter of Jacob marries a Canaanite, the newborn's identity is considered based on his/her mother (see Yevamot 45b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I do not know if they ever \"officially\" announced it as such, but it seemed obvious (to us) that it was the same. I do know that we used it at summer camp. I think that the summer camp was the summer before, because I went to Eretz Yisrael the next summer (1964) I do know that after it was released, we all assumed that it had been based on Adon Olam.</p>\n\n<p>Of course since it was so long ago, I could be mistaken about having heard it that summer and conflated it with having heard it during the trip to Israel (the following summer). Even if it was based on Adon Olam, the author could have written an original tune for it. Since it was over 50 years ago, I can no longer be sure.</p>\n\n<p>Note that I have found comments of people who recognized it as Adon Olam, but no references going that far back.</p>\n\n<p>I did find <a href=\"http://uk.warnerchappell.com/song-details/WW001057383000\" rel=\"nofollow\">Poet and The Prophet</a> lists the authors as Joe Sherman(C) and George David Weiss(A)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=iy4hAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA1625&lpg=PA1625&dq=song+%22poet+and+the+prophet%22+sherman&source=bl&ots=caDFz8ygEW&sig=LqJ7yI88CFbHpEyBjPMbuJs9KeI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxss6V4uDKAhVBSyYKHa1DBQcQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&q=song%20%22poet%20and%20the%20prophet%22%20sherman&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Copyright</a> date is shown as 20 December 1963.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, given our \"musical knowledge\" at that time, it could have been the reverse and we still would have believed it.</p>\n\n<p>See the answer by  @ShamanSTK who seems to be able to connect it to a melody that was used in (at least) the 1950's that may have been the base of the song that Sherman wrote for the Village Stompers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Salamone de Rossi, a renaissance composer, wrote an Adon Olam.

    "content": "# Stoning of homosexuals\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is the stoning of homosexuals in the Torah to be taken at face value or is there a deeper meaning beyond the scripture itself? When Moshiach comes, will the courts actually mete out such a punishment and sentence homosexuals to death?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p><strong>There is indeed a confusion between the Torah prescribing capital punishment (by stoning) for homosexual acts and the Torah view of homosexuals.</strong> Some context is required, see precise answers at the bottom.</p>\n\n<p>I addressed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/68062/gay-people-in-the-torah-talmud-kabbalah\">elsewhere</a> the view of the Torah on homosexuals. In a nutshell, the Torah is not so concerned and doesn't judge how people feel or what their desires are. It prohibits actions not thoughts (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/68094/are-thoughts-of-sin-punished-halachically\">here</a> for nuances on this).</p>\n\n<p>Stoning is indeed prescribed for homosexual <strong>acts</strong>. It is important to understand its parameters and limitations. <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=27505\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R Eliezer Melamed writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The punishment of stoning is only when they did it b’mayzid\n  (deliberate violation of Jewish law), and before two witnesses who\n  warned them not to do it, and that if they do, they will be punished\n  by stoning, and nevertheless, they transgressed and sinned before them\n  visibly. In practice, one would have to be completely insane to do so,\n  because no one would dare commit a sin deserving of death before\n  witnesses who warn him that if he continues to sin he will be punished\n  by death. And if he dared, perhaps he really is insane and not\n  responsible for his actions, and exempt from punishment.</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, even though there are dozens of sins for which the penalty\n  of death was determined by the Torah, in actuality, capital punishment\n  by Beit Din (religious court) was very rare, to the point where our\n  Sages said a Sanhedrin that effects a capital punishment once in seven\n  years is branded a destructive tribunal [...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Accordingly, the punishment set by the Torah is meant to teach the\n  gravity of the sin, and is mainly intended to discourage people from\n  transgressing it deliberately and brazenly in front of witnesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Jack Abramowitz similarly <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/mitzvah209/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There’s no prohibition against having homosexual tendencies per se\n  [...] the only act that might potentially result in capital punishment\n  was intercourse, and then only with a warning and qualified witnesses\n  as is the case in any mitzvah that might result in execution by the\n  courts. So there’s no general prohibition against “being gay” and\n  there’s no mitzvah to hate or oppress such people.</p>\n  \n  <p>Lots of mitzvos are potentially capital offenses. These include most\n  of the forbidden sexual relationships [...] Sewing a button on Shabbos\n  or performing other simple labors would likewise be capital offenses.\n  Homosexual intercourse is just one of many, many behaviors that were\n  potentially subject to execution under Torah law. In all of these\n  cases, the odds of actually being executed were pretty slim. According\n  to the Mishna in Makkos (1:10), a Sanhedrin that carried out an\n  execution once in 70 years was considered a “bloody court.” So, the\n  threat of potential execution was more of a general statement as to\n  the severity of a particular mitzvah, not a witch hunt.</p>\n  \n  <p>As far as the term to’eivah (abomination), that’s a common Biblical\n  term far from unique to this mitzvah. Remarrying an ex-wife who had\n  married another man in the interim is called a to’eivah (Deuteronomy\n  24:4), as is selling a dog and using the money to purchase a Temple\n  sacrifice (Deut. 23:19). Non-kosher food is likewise called a to’eivah\n  (Deut. 14:3). So, again, this term is by no means limited to this\n  mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>So to relate to your questions</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>there is no stoning of homosexuals prescribed in the Torah</li>\n<li>the stoning for homosexual acts has to be taken at face value and is strictly framed as described above</li>\n<li>When Moshiach comes, the Beit Hamikdash is rebuilt and the Sanhedrin is re-established, the courts will likely mete out death punishment again as the Mishna tells us in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makkot.1.10?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Makot 1:10</a> <em>\"A Sanhedrin that puts a man to death once in seven years is called destructive. Rabbi Eliezer ben Azariah says: even once in seventy years. Rabbi Akiba and Rabbi Tarfon say: had we been in the Sanhedrin none would ever have been put to death.\"</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Apparently there is a confusion in this question.\nWhen we speak with words specific to the modern language, and naivly use such words to translate the Torah, a confusion happens.\nIf an adultery between a young bride and a man is called heterosexual, You can change the title as \"Stoning the heterosexuals\"</p>\n\n<p>In the Greek antic civilization, the practice of homosexual intercourse was not considered as the fact of \"homosexuals\". Prison inmates does not define themselves as \"homosexuals\". </p>\n\n<p>The concept of gender orientation and gender identity, the psycho-sexual development of the child are the cultural environment of the term \"homosexual\".\nAn man is also a product of his Lexico-Cultural universe. Consequently he cannot avoid to define itself as hetero, homo, etc.</p>\n\n<p>there are indeed people who do not have the right to have a sexual relationship between them, according to the Jewish law. It can be true also for heterosexual relationship. </p>\n\n<p>There are several transgressions which are punishable by death penalty following an extremely rigorous procedure.</p>\n\n<p>In the Torah the death penalty is divided into several kinds of put to death. One of them is stoning, which, however is not as we imagine in general.</p>\n\n<p>An act of anal penetration between two men is prohibited for both. The ultimate grade of condemnation for this transgression is stoning.</p>\n\n<p>Torah is eternal. However, it's hard to translate our universe in Torah language and to translate Torah in our language. We can speak about marriage with a very young girl, slaves, penalty for Shabbat transgression.</p>\n\n<p>If the purpose is to understand and not to make a sensation, it takes a lot of patience and we need to know that we have not answer to all questions. I would not want to appear to condone a very painful problem in the Jewish world in our time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>the torah is quite clear that sex between two males is a capital offense incurring stoning. it's not an exaggeration. though stoning is not like the islamic version of stoning. the talmud derives to chose a more humane version which is to be pushed off a high platform as explained in tractate sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>in the time of moshiach there will be no yetzer hara (evil inclination) everyone will willingly follow the torah from a-z. for details on this latter point see <a href=\"http://www.neveh.org/winston/parsha58/shavuos_5758_part_3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.neveh.org/winston/parsha58/shavuos_5758_part_3.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

It is mainly concerned in how we act.</strong> Nowhere does the Torah consider <strong>feelings</strong> for same-sex people to be a prohibition. But the Torah is concerned about actions and as is well known <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.18.22?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">homosexual male intercourse is forbidden</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The gmara in Kiddushin 40a explicitly says that Hashem doesn’t regard a bad thought that doesn’t lead to action as an action (artscroll comments <em>“hence there is no punishment for the thought”</em>), another gmara (end of Bava Batra 164b) says all men think of sin every single day.</p>\n\n<p>On the other side later in Kiddushin 40a the gmara says that thoughts of sins <em>one has performed and now considers permitted</em> are punished and in Shabbat 64a we see the army returning from the war in Midian offered a korban to atone against their lustful thoughts. Also relevant is R Chaim mi Volozhin who writes (Nefesh HaChaim, gate 1, ch. 4) that the body is like a mishkan, the mind is the kodesh hakodashim and thinking unclean thoughts is a desecration even greater than defiling the Kodesh Hakodoshim since the Mishkan is physical and the mind is even more holy and spiritual.</p>\n\n<p>For more on the Torah perspective on thoughts vs. actions see <a href=\"https://guardyoureyes.com/articles/prevention/item/do-thoughts-really-count\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/archive/develop/11develop.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1754248/jewish/Is-There-Anything-Wrong-with-Sinful-Thought.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>The questions of how people became gay and how to address the situation are contentious.</strong> Specific issues are the root cause of the situation (nurture vs. nature), the ability (or not) for gay people to overcome their inclination, the extent to which they need to undergo therapy and the need (or not) to accept once identity as gay.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading on a Torah approach to same-sex attraction see e.g., in Hakirah <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%2012%20Goldberg.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol13Rapoport.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol%2012%20Berger.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a>, and R Eliezer Melamed <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=27505\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In terms of actual prohibitions:</p>\n\n<p>1- Male homosexual sex is prohibited to both Jew, and under the covenant G-d made with Noah, to non-Jews as well.</p>\n\n<p>2- Male homosexual intimacy that is not prohibited under #1 is prohibited to Jews under the same kinds of laws that prohibit masturbation.</p>\n\n<p>3- At least some forms of female homosexual sex if not all are prohibited by the Torah to Jews. (See Rashi, Yevamos 71a; Rambam Issurei Bi'ah 21:8)</p>\n\n<p>4- There is a prohibition for both Jews and non-Jews to contract a marriage between two men, two women, and one that includes a woman and more than one man. This is derived from the verse \"כְּמַעֲשֵׂה אֶרֶץ-מִצְרַיִם אֲשֶׁר יְשַׁבְתֶּם-בָּהּ, לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ -- as per the actions of the Land of Egypt which you live in, do not do\" (see Rambam ibid.) Notice this prohibition condemns Egypt for contracting such marriages, because the prohibition is on non-Jews as well as Jews.</p>\n\n<p>There is never a prohibition against a desire. (The topic of the 10th commandment and whether it is actually against the feeling of jealousy would take us too far afield, but it is NOT generally taken that way among commentaries.)</p>\n\n<p>So, there is no prohibition against desiring gay relations. Nor against wanting to live monogamously with a partner of the same sex.

In other words, the only kind of \"Gay Pride\" that would be consistent with the Torah would be pride in the knowledge that Hashem thought one was capable of the challenge. Most of us are not, and therefore spared the whole battle against a desire for this particular prohibition. The fact that Hashem thought someone's soul could handle that kind of work says something. The bottom line is, though, that it's a desire that requires channeling and sublimation, as does any other desire to commit a sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Haber notes that the medrash says that Adam cohabited with every animal before cohabiting with Eve whereupon he said 'zos ha'paam etzem me'atzamai'.</p>\n\n<p>He explains this is because woman is the most dissimilar being in existence to man so it is unintuitive for a relationship to exist between them.</p>\n\n<p>However when the relationship does exist, because of their dissimilarity, they become together a new entity.</p>\n\n<p>So that homosexuality is a relationship between likes and heterosexuality is a relationship between dissimilar beings which requires a certain activation energy to overcome the natural repulsion between them and fuse into a new whole.</p>\n\n\n",

It is an acknowledged principle (Bava\n  Kamma 50a): \"Whoever says that the Holy One Blessed be He overlooks\n  things will have his life `overlooked.' \" </p>\n  \n  <p>If He desires justice, then, He must deal with each man according to\n  his ways and according to the fruits of his acts, with the most minute\n  discrimination, for good or for bad. This is what underlies the\n  statement of our Sages of blessed memory (Yalkut Ibid.) that the verse\n  \"He is a G-d of faithfulness, without wrong; He is righteous and just\"\n  has application to the righteous and to the wicked. For this is His\n  attribute. He judges everything. He punishes every sin. There is no\n  escaping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that bad deeds, however small, are judged. But more relevant to the question is what he writes here:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>… the attribute of mercy ... provides that the sinner be given time,\n  and not be wiped out as soon as he sins;  …. the time extension\n  constitutes not a pardoning of the sin, but rather G-d's bearing with\n  the sinner for a while to open the door of repentance to him.</p>\n  \n  <p>But for sins to be pardoned or ignored would be entirely contrary to\n  the concept of justice, for then there would be no judgement and no\n  true law in relation to things. It is, therefore, impossible for such\n  a situation to obtain.

The attribute of mercy may act to delay punishment and give the sinner an opportunity to repent. </p>\n\n<p>I found no information either way about the idea that Hashem punishes until the sinner repents.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From Maimonides' <em>Mishneh Torah</em> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Repentance.1.2?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Repentance Chapter 1:1</a>) it seems <em>Teshuva</em> - returning/repentance  (at least nowadays*) is an essential ingredient of atonement for all categories of sin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...[the sacrifices] do not atone for them until they repent and confess verbally, as it says: <em>he shall confess the matter in which he sinned</em> (Leviticus 5:5). ...their death or lashing does not atone for them until they repent and confess verbally. And also someone who has injured his fellow or damaged his property, even though he has repaid what he owes him, he has not atoned until he confesses and turns away from similar actions forever, as it says: <em>From any of the sins of man</em> (Numbers 5:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the fact that without repentance, even suffering and/or death do not atone, it seems fairly implicit that there is no time limit, at least in this world**.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the implication of <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Repentance.1.4?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:4</a> is that time and suffering <em>only</em> function toward atonement when <em>teshuva</em> is also involved:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even though <em>teshuvah</em> atones for all, and the day of <em>Yom</em> <em>Kippur</em> itself atones - there are some sins that can be atoned for in their time, and some sins which are only atoned after time has passed. What case is that? If a person violated a positive commandment for which the punishment is not <em>karet</em> and did <em>teshuvah</em> - before he can even move he is forgiven, and regarding such people it is said: <em>Return, backsliding children; I will heal your backslidings</em> (Jeremiah 3:22). If a person violated a negative commandment for which the punishment is neither <em>karet</em> nor capital punishment and did <em>teshuvah</em> – the <em>teshuvah</em> suspends it and <em>Yom Kippur</em> effects atonement; and regarding such people it is said: <em>For that day will atone for you</em> (Leviticus 16:30). If a person violated [a commandment for which the punishment is] karet or capital punishment and did <em>teshuvah</em> – the <em>teshuvah</em> and <em>Yom</em> <em>Kippur</em> suspend it and the suffering that falls upon him effects atonement. And no matter how much time passes, he does not receive full atonement until suffering falls upon him; and regarding such people it is said: <em>Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes</em> (Psalms 89:33). What cases are we discussing? Cases in which he did not disgrace the name [of G-d] at the moment of violation. But someone who disgraces the name [of G-d], even if he does <em>teshuvah</em>, and <em>Yom</em> <em>Kippur</em> passes and he remains in his <em>teshuvah</em>, and suffering befalls him – he does not receive full atonement until he dies; the <em>teshuvah</em>, <em>Yom</em> <em>Kippur</em>, and the suffering all suspend and death atones, as it says: <em>And the Lord of Hosts revealed Himself in my ears: Surely this iniquity shall not be atoned until you die</em> (Isaiah 22:14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Relatedly, we find a debate amongst the Tannaim and Amoraim regarding the dependence of the final communal salvation upon repentance (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.97b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 97b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>:אמר רב: כלו כל הקיצין ואין הדבר תלוי אלא בתשובה ומעשים טובים. ושמואל אמר\nדיו לאבל שיעמוד באבלו. כתנאי...</p>\n<p>Rav said: all the deadlines have passed and the thing is only dependent on repentance and good deeds. And Samuel said: It is enough for the mourner to stand in his mourning. This is also disputed by the Tannaim...***</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See there the full discussion.)</p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p>*Interestingly, however, in the time of the Temple service, atonement (at least on the <em>communal</em> level) did not always require <em>teshuva</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1:2 ...But if repentance wasn't done, the goat only atones for the light ones. What are \"light ones\" and what are \"heavy ones\"? The heavy ones are sins that have the obligation of death by court, or excision. And false or vain oaths, even though they do not have excision, are of the heavy ones. And the rest of the negative commandments, and the positive commandments which do not have excision - those are the light ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, considering that the scapegoat is a communal offering, it seems well within reason to argue that Maimonides is commenting here only regarding communal atonement, not of individual atonement, which may well always require some form of actual repentance.</p>\n<p>**There is a tradition that postmortem suffering has a general time-limit of one year (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Eduyot.2.10?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eduyoth 2:10</a>; See also Rosh Hashanah 17a). To what level these types of ideas can be understood simplistically/literally is controversial at best. But the suggestions does seem to be one of finite suffering even absent actual repentance.</p>\n<p>***See however the subsequent passage where indeed it seems that even Samuel's position is that repentance is necessary, but if the final deadline is reached, the level of threat becomes one that precludes real free will, i.e. the teshuva is forced (perhaps akin to the midrashic concept of the acceptance of the Torah - <em>kafa aleihem har k'gigit</em>). See also alternate versions of the debate. In any case, it could certainly also be argued that this view of non-dependence on free-willed <em>teshuva</em> might also only be at the communal level of redemption, not with regard to individual atonement.</p>\n\n\n",

Many medieval scholars assumed that the phenomenon was not really referring to sunset (e.g. Rabbeinu Tam) and there was a custom to assume that it was later. There was also an opinion that it was earlier than sunset. Nonetheless, later authorities, basing themselves partly on the difficulty of such a position when followed in northern European cities such as Wilnius and Prague, assumed that <em>shekiat hachama</em> does indeed refer to literal sunset. This also turned out to be the position of the Geonim, and seems to be the view of Maimonides as well.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, the Talmud is quite clear that <em>shekia</em> is potentially the <em>d'orayta</em> cutoff, and if a person unintentionally violated the Shabbat after <em>shekia</em> but before <em>tzeit</em> both at the beginning and end of Shabbat (the latter earlier in the period than the former) he would definitely be obligated in the <em>chatat</em> offering.</p>\n\n<p>Still, because of the uncertainty, a well as the position of Rabbeinu Tam, there are those who have certain leniencies in times of great need.</p>\n\n\n",

Does the Torah actually have such a distorted view of Earth and the Universe? Or is it a matter of interpretation? If we know the Chazal had it wrong, how can we trust their other interpretations? What is the current view on the firmament in orthodox Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The notion of a semi-spherical shell around the world, that the sun travels under during the day, and then back around and over at night is not necessarily the early Israelite understanding of cosmology. Most of the evidence for it is from an era when he Babylonians and Persians had much much more accurate observations than the Greeks, and it is the Babylonian cosmology. Tannaim (eg R' Eliezer on Bava Basra 25a) and the earlier Babylonian amoraim mapped the Torah to it, much the way rabbis today talk about Relativity and QM in the Torah. Given that it was the dominant science in their mileau, this was actually the rational choice. There is no indication that this was also \"Ancient Hebrew\" belief on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, in Israel, the later tannaim and amoraim switched over to the Ptolemaic system as Ptolemy's work took over the scientific consensus in their region. (See Pesachim 94b) And the debate shifts -- it is taken for granted that the raqia is a spherical shell around the earth, and the question they debate is whether the stars are affixed in the raqia, or move around on their own in front of it.</p>\n\n<p>As opposed to all rishonim agreeing that all of chazal held the same view, it is uniquely the position of Rabbeinu Tam who says Rabbi Yehudah didn't actually switch views to the Ptolmeic system. The talmud in Pesachim says that he found the sages of Athen's words \"appear to be more correct than ours\", the sages' of Israel's. The idiom would usually mean that they are indeed more correct, as can be seen. Rabbeinu Tam (as relayed by the Shitah Mequbetzes on Kesuvos 13b) interprets the line as saying they appear more correct, but in reality the Greek astronomy is mistaken.</p>\n\n<p>In contrast, the more straightforward read is that of R' Hai Gaon, R Sherira Gaon, the Rambam, the Tosafos Rid, the Rosh, the Ritva, the Smag....</p>\n\n<p>In my opinion, it is more important to note the meta-issue... The general tendency is not an assertion that the Torah is a source of scientific theory. Chazal simply understood the verses as per then-contemporary science. And it is recorded in the gemara (except according to Rabbeinu Tam) that they changed their opinion when a new theory came along. Just as we today would with our contemporary science.</p>\n\n<p>None of which means our sages thought the raqia was a shell because the Torah said so. Rather, that the Torah looked to them like it was talking about a shell they took for granted existed -- because their local scientists did. In the same way, it is likely 2,000 years from now, Jews are going to find our explaining Genesis using General Relativity quite antiquated and misguided. Still, it may be appropriate for us to do so, because it is our best understanding of the world and thus the verses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are different opinions regarding the nature of the rakia. One opinion is that of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Avraham Ibn Ezra</a>  who writes in his commentary to Genesis (1:6) (Shitta acheret) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנכון בעיני, כי הארץ היתה מכוסה במים, והרוח יבש המים מעל הארץ כדרך ויעבר א-להים רוח על הארץ וישכו המים (ברא' ח, א) אז נראה. ובעבור האור היה הרקיע. והוא האויר ההוה על הארץ במעשה אור השמש, כאשר יגיע אל הארץ, יתהפך למעלה בעבור עובי הארץ, ויתחמם האויר הסמוך אל הארץ. ועל זה הדרך אמרו קדמונינו ז\"ל (ביצה ד, ז) מוציאין את האור מן המים. רק לעולם יהיה קרים שהם עבים מהחמים. והנה הרקיע הוא זה האויר ועוף תעופף עליו.</p>\n<p>And what appears correct in my eyes is that the earth was covered in water, and the wind dried the water from over the earth in the manner of \"And God passed a wind over the earth and the water abated\" (Gen 8:1), then it was seen. And on account of the light there was the firmament. and it is the air that is on the land per the action of the sun's light, when it reaches the earth, it turns upward due to the thickness of the earth, and the air close to the earth is heated. And in this vein our forebears of blessed memory spoke (Beiza 4:6) 'they remove the fire from the water'. However it will always be the cold that are thicker than the hot. And behold the firmament is this air and birds fly on its face.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although it is a little difficult for me to understand, he seems to say that the rakia is some sort of air.</p>\n<p>This seems to be the opinion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> as well, who in his commentary to Genesis (1: 6) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רקיע - כל דבר הנמתח ומרוקע נקרא רקיע, כמו \"רקועי פחים\" (במדבר י\"ז), והוא האויר הסובב את כל כדור הארצי</p>\n<p>Rakia: anything that is stretched and crushed is called \"rakia\", as in \"beaten plates\" (Numbers 17: 3). And it refers to the air that surrounds the sphere of the Earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The word רקיע means a hammering-out.</p>\n\n<p>At first all of creation was consumed with water. [1] The רקיע was a hammering-out \"inside of the waters\" (verse 6) which would \"separate between the waters\" (ibid). In other words it would force a gap of water, basically a bubble.[2]</p>\n\n<p>The רקיע is simply the great bubble we and everything else in the universe inhabits.  Relative to our position, the waters on earth are below the bubble, and the waters above are those outside the bubble, beyond all the planets and galaxies and stars and darkness.[3] This is the plain reading of the verses and is not refuted by modern science.</p>\n\n<p>[1] This is my reading of verse 2, in which the רוח אלהים hovered or blew over the water which covered the תהום which was dark and תהו ובהו. No mention of the bubble of air we inhabit. Considering that רקיע fits the description of this bubble, I assume the reason there is no mention is because the bubble is the רקיע, which wasn't created yet.</p>\n\n<p>[2] The alternative is that the רקיע is some kind of stable mass (\"firmament\" used to make me think of a giant glass dome) like a wall nothing could penetrate, but the verses place the sun, moon and stars \"in the רקיע השמים\" (verse 17) and some of these things move so this is wrong. רקיע must be something things can travel through as for example things travel through water, but not water because we know it \"separates\" water.</p>\n\n<p>[3] It is no argument that the bubble we inhabit is not the same inhabited by Mars because there are different chemical properties in the air on Earth and on Mars; because whatever the chemical elements in any place are there is still a continuum of non-water penetrable substance which travels throughout the observed universe and it is that continuum, not a specific combination of chemicals which the verses are calling the רקיע.</p>\n\n\n",

It is mainly concerned in how we act.</p>\n\n<p><strong>On one side</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the gmara in Kiddushin 40a explicitly says that Hashem doesn’t regard a bad thought that doesn’t lead to action as an action (artscroll comments “hence there is no punishment for the thought”)</li>\n<li>another gmara (end of Bava Batra 164b) says all men think of sin every single day (presumably meaning it is not punishable)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>later in Kiddushin 40a the gmara says that thoughts of sins one has performed and now considers permitted are punished</li>\n<li>in Shabbat 64a we see the army returning from the war in Midian offered a korban to atone against their lustful thoughts</li>\n<li>R Chaim mi Volozhin writes (Nefesh HaChaim, gate 1, ch. 4) that the body is like a mishkan, the mind is the kodesh hakodashim and thinking unclean thoughts is a desecration even greater than defiling the Kodesh Hakodoshim since the Mishkan is physical and the mind is even more holy and spiritual</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>So how is the halakha judging thoughts of sin?</strong> Are specific halakhic works codifying this (as opposed to more philosophical discussions)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Masechet Yoma (29A) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרהורי עבירה קשין מעבירה וסימניך ריחא דבישרא \n  (Thoughts of sin are harder than sin itself, as smell of meat is more attractive than taste of meat)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, the text addresses the physical harm caused by sexual desire, i.e. thinking of prohibited women (sexual thinking), compared with the physical harm caused by prohibited sexual intercourse:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תאות נשים קשים להכחיש את בשרו יותר מגופו של מעשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Rabenu Bechaye (Cad Hakemach, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41684&st=&pgnum=209\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Taharat Halev</a>), there are many explanations for the Gemara's statement:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The first opinion: Thought is the most <strong>spiritual</strong> thing in man, and to impair or soil it is worse than to impair or soil the <strong>material</strong> body.</li>\n<li>The second opinion: It is more difficult to overcome the impulse to sin caused by repetitive thought patterns than the impulse to sin caused by past physical sins that were not accompanied by continual sinful thinking. </li>\n<li>The third opinion: The Gemara is talking about premeditation. When a man premeditates a sin, he will make every effort to achieve his target, even if he needs to kill someone for this. While planning, he is willing to commit additional sins in order to facilitate his target sin.</li>\n<li>The fourth opinion (attributed to Ramban): The Gemara is talking about sinful thoughts that persist even after the sin has been committed. It is more than a simple desire. He cited a passage from Gemara Kidushin 40B, based on which he says that idle thoughts might not be acted upon and are less significant than a decision to act. Action results from a decision, not just idle thoughts. In his opinion (against the third opinion), a man will not be punished merely because of thinking or desiring; thinking and desiring is not manageable, and thoughts are often egodystonic. Against this argument, Rabenu Bechaye argued the existence of 'proactive' thinking: A man can anticipate and get into the right conditions in which no bad thoughts will come. The choice to adequately prepare for well-oriented thinking is entirely free, and whoever doesn't create the right conditions for himself is liable to punishment. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>It seems that <strong>Rabenu Behaye chooses the first opinion</strong>. (I've seen this in the past: <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14118&st=&pgnum=487\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam (<strong>More Nevuchim III, 8</strong>)</a>. It is a wonderful passage in the book).\nSee also <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52052&st=&pgnum=19&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabenu Yona</a>, who cites a Hazal linked to this topic. There are cases in which the intention to sin, even if the person's plan to sin is foiled, is considered as if the sin was actually committed (in this regard, Rabenu Bechaye also cited thinking about idol worship).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara says if a person is used to doing a sin they are punished for the thought, apparently because there is nothing internal stopping them from realising their thought into action other than external circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>According to Reb YL Bloch you are not obliged to purify your thoughts to the extent that no thought of sin enters your mind because this is un-natural and would prevent you from living a healthy existence.</p>\n\n<p>The other schools of Mussar, notably Novahrdok, disagree.</p>\n\n\n",

And if you grind it and mix it into food and drink, it is very helpful for pregnancy like the <em>duda'im</em> that Reuven found.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Shimon</strong> was on the <strong>Pitda</strong> (some type of green stone) because Zimri ben Salu's face along with all his tribe members who sinned with the daughters of Moav were made green. And Raza\"l give 'greenness' as a sign for sin.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Levi</strong> was on the <strong>Barekes</strong> (some type of bright stone) because the Levite tribe shone with Torah. And also Moshe was from the Levite tribe and when he was born, the house was filled with light.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Yehudah</strong> was on the <strong>Nofech</strong>(another green type of stone) because his face was made green in the story with Tamar and he conquered his inclination and admitted without embarrassment. And also because his father suspected him about Yosef.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Yissachar</strong> was on the <strong>Sapir</strong> (a blue stone) because they were great in the wisdom of the Torah and the Luchos were written on Sapir.

In that case, would it really be the case that everybody who doesn't lead <em>davening</em> is <em>mivatel</em> a <em>chiuv</em>? I have doubts about that because I have seen people who I know to be very pious and knowledgeable who had a <em>chiuv</em> praying in a <em>minyan</em> where someone else with a <em>chiuv</em> was leading the prayer.

If he does not have that consent, he is not\n  permitted to lead the davening because the davening is in place of\n  sacrifices offered by the public, and it is unfitting for a person to\n  offer a sacrifice in the name of the public against its will. If a\n  person attempts to lead the davening against the will of the\n  congregation, the congregation should not answer amen to the blessings\n  he recites. In reciting those blessings, he is considered to be\n  scoffing rather than blessing G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if my shul is an example, but I know that some congregants, myself among them, do <strong>not</strong> always approve of one or two \"chiyuvim\". One, I think, davens too quickly and swallows some words. Another one has an annoying loud voice. I occasionally complain to the gabbai. But I sense that most of the others are not as vocal or think that a \"chiyuv\" cannot be challenged and these people must always be shlichei tzibbur. Perhaps, this or a similar scenario occurs in other shuls.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if the shaliach tzibbur needs unanimous approval or majority approval. But it seems that if the majority do not approve, how can he be considered a \"chiyuv\"? If the majority are regular attendants, and they really don't like his davening (or, perhaps, they just don't like his personality), does the \"chiyuv\" rule still have precedence?</p>\n\n<p>The 2nd challenge is, IIRC, when a person is asked to be shaliach tzibbur, he is supposed to refuse up to 3 times. (I don't recall the source but I think it's in Shulchan Aruch.) In my shul, and I assume mosts others, when they know that the person is a chiyuv, they don't even ask him to be chazzan. Furthermore, the chiyuv just goes up to the bima a few minutes before davening starts, because he knows he's the only chiyuv. Shouldn't he be asked first, and isn't he supposed to refuse? In most places I've davened, either they know who is a chiyuv, or, if it's a \"pop up\" minyan, like at a wedding, someone asks \"Is anyone a chiyuv?\" and someone raises his hand, and they have him do it.</p>\n\n<p>So, here, too, does the chiyuv override standard protocol?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R Eliezer Melamed addresses this (<a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=28063\" rel=\"nofollow\">online under 3</a> but also in <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1613290330\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Laws of prayer</a> p. 51)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The chazan is the emissary of the congregation, and therefore a person\n  is prohibited from taking hold of the chazanut unless he is asked to\n  do so by the congregation or by the gabbai as its representative.\n  Hence, one may not respond Amen to a person who appointed himself to\n  be chazan against the congregation’s wishes (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.53.22?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rama OC 53:22</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Having a good voice, being skilled at chanting and knowing prayers are three important criteria the Shulchan Aruch lists for a hazzan (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.53.4?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA OC 53:4</a>)</p>\n\n<p>So you would be well placed to challenge a hazzan that doesn't have a good voice.

One who has a chiyuv has a good reason to lead the prayer and I have never seen one refuse since he has a legitimate priority. R Neustadt writes regarding this</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A chiyuv who has priority according to Halachah should not readily\n  relinquish his right to be the Sheliach Tzibbur, for the right is not\n  really his to surrender; rather, it belongs to the soul of his parent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Halacha regarding initial refusal (SA OC 53:16) is in the context of \"Someone who is not a \"Shaliach Tzibbur Kavua\", one who does not have a fixed position to lead the davening.  Someone with a Chiyuv would not necessarily need to refuse the invitation to daven if he has established a position in a certain Minyan.  Additionally, the Shulchan Aruch HaRav (53:5) says that even a Bochur who knows what he's saying should take precedence over an unlearned adult with a nice voice. So having a nice voice should not be a deciding factor in all cases.  The SA OC 53:4 quoted above also says the Chazzan should be someone who is well-versed in Scripture which seems to fit with the Shulchan Aruch HaRav that the Chazzan should know what he's saying.</p>\n\n\n",

To search raw trop patterns here regardless of words, just assign the trop character to a single-letter wildcard (?) and surround that wildcard with an * (asterisk) wildcard before and after.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> My own <strong>Base Hasefer</strong> (<a href=\"https://basehasefer.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://basehasefer.com</a>) - it allows one to search for trop patterns of unlimited length.  It allows for searching exact trop patterns as long as there's no repeating trop.  There are multiple ways to accomplish trop searches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple search:</strong> A brief <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ca4ZjPTTHFc&t=285s\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tutorial of this capability</a> can be viewed <em>(the duration of that section is about 90 seconds)</em>. While one can use the virtual keyboard popup to merely enter טעם characters separated by spaces for the searches, it is recommended to use any letter (eg. alef) as a placeholder along with the trop character to make the trop more visible. If one only wants to search by trop regardless of words, one must make sure in the settings bar that the טעמים button is selected and the אותיות\\נקודות buttons are deselected in the search settings panel.</li>\n<li><strong>Advanced search:</strong> this can even simulate per word OR conditions for the trop by using the Nikud/Taamaim tab to select multiple trop from the טעם dropdown.  Best used if the אותיות button is the only one selected in the search settings panel.</li>\n<li><strong>Pasuk settings:</strong>  use this tab within the Advanced Search as a quick way to find whole pesukim based on selecting a list of trop they <strong>must contain</strong> and a list of trop they <strong>must not contain</strong> (eg. all pesukim without אתנחתא).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One final nice trop feature there is the <strong>Taam Parser</strong> which for every single pasuk in Tanach, breaks down the syntax of the words into a visual and interactive tree structure according to the rules set forth in Rav Breuer's ספר טעמי המקרא.</p>\n<p>While the Taam Parser is very quick and intuitive, the search UI mentioned earlier can admittedly be tricky and sometimes sluggish, especially for longer trop patterns.  In addition to the occasional inaccuracies, I hope to improve on all of this in the future.</p>\n\n\n",

This stems from meta-halachic concerns which he discusses there at length. The primary issue is that cannibalism is something which ought to be repulsive to us even sans technicalities, and is to be avoided even at the expense of the prohibition of forbidden meat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל מה שנתקבל בעיני בני אדם הנאורים לתועבה, אפילו אינו מפורש בתורה לאיסור, העובר על זה גרע מן העובר על חוקי התורה . . . ועתה אמור נא, בחולה שיש בו סכנה ולפניו בשר בהמה נחורה או טרפה ובשר אדם, איזה בשר יאכל, הכי נאמר דיאכל בשר אדם שאין בו איסור תורה אע\"פ שמחוק הנימוס שמקובל מכלל האנושי, כל האוכל או מאכיל בשר אדם מודח מלהיות נמנה בין האישים, ולא יאכל בשר שהתורה אסרו בלאו, היעלה על הדעת שאנו עם הנבחר עם חכם ונבון נעבור על חוק הנימוס כזה להינצל מאיסור תורה? אתמהה! </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>this is a good Question, very interesting.

So without dead in the Ohel, not chiburim. This opinion is agreed by Rambam and Shulchan Aruch follows it. But to reach this psak, we see 2 ways in Rishonim: 1.- following Tosfot Nazir 42b, Abbaye is the \"Baal Hadea\" aliba deRabba. But following Shut Harashba 324, Rav Yosef is Baal Hadea, against Rabba. Concerning Rambam, Lechem Mishne and Raavad learned it as the Rashba Psak.\nSo, (lehagdil Tora Ulehaadira) the psak is of Rav Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you need to deal with the Tosfot Rid in Avoda Zara 37b, who comments the above cited Gemara Benazir. The Gemara is seeking a case of nazir Tame who becomes tame again, Tum'a Veohel, Tum'a Vetum'a. He thinks that following one step of Rabba (at least at the starting of the Gemara) if someone touch a dead and after this is Maahil, he is flagelled twice. So, when he eat the dead, he touch it and adds a Lav. If he can burn it without any touching, may be good.</p>\n\n<p>I will be very happy to discuss the topic and discover errors in my answer.</p>\n\n<p>I was still not convinced that there is a Lav to leave a chiburin through Ohel which is by Shev Veal Taasse. But @DoubleAA show me Rambam Avelut 3, 4, and I have found there in Lechem Mishne in name of Kesef Mishne Kilayim in name of Ritba that a lav Sheein Bo maasse that you can cancel is considered as an act by uncancellation and as an Asse.</p>\n\n\n",

The beginning says <strong>If</strong> you read it in Adar 1 and an extra Adar occurred, you have to read it again.

How can you undo what you already read in the 1st Adar if you thought that it would not be a leap year? (It says that <strong>afterwards</strong> they added an extra month.)

He gives her money or monetary equivalent and says to her \"הרי את מקודשת לי\" (behold you are betrothed to me) or \"הרי את מאורסת לי\" (behold you are betrothed to me) or \"הרי את לי לאינתו\" (behold you are a woman/wife to me), behold she is betrothed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara on 5b adds some more examples:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ת\"ר הרי את אשתי הרי את ארוסתי הרי את קנויה לי מקודשת הרי את שלי הרי את ברשותי הרי את זקוקה לי מקודשת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"הרי את\" (behold you) formulation can also be dropped, as we see on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=13&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 13a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לה כנסי סלע זו שאני חייב ליכי וחזר ואמר לה התקדשי לי בו בשעת מתן מעות רצתה מקודשת לא רצתה אינה מקודשת</p>\n<p>If he said to her \"take this selah that I owe you\" and then said \"התקדשי לי בו\" (become betrothed to me through it), and she is appeased, she is betrothed...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, the Gemara (6a) concludes that if they had been generally discussing her becoming betrothed, and then he gave her <em>kiddushin</em>, she is betrothed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנן היה מדבר עם אשה על עסקי גיטה וקידושיה ונתן לה גיטה וקידושיה ולא פירש ר' יוסי אומר דיו ר' יהודה אומר צריך לפרש ואמר רב הונא אמר שמואל הלכה כר' יוסי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What doesn't work is if he phrases it to be about him becoming the husband as opposed to her becoming betrothed/wife, as we see on 5a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"הריני אישך\", \"הריני בעליך\", \"הריני ארוסיך\"-- אין כאן בית מיחוש</p>\n<p>\"Behold I am your husband\", \"behold I am your husband (with a different Hebrew word)\", \"behold I am your betrothed\" - these are not even a concern [of betrothal].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as the codified halacha is concerned, Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7602\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 27:1</a> rules that any language which unquestionably implies betrothal in that locale, such as the examples from the above gemaras, suffices (as long as she comprehends the implication), or any language which universally implies betrothal even if she doesn't understand. The Rema adds that ideally one should use the formulation with which we are familiar, including the \"כדת משה וישראל\" part.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בְּכֶסֶף כֵּיצַד, נוֹתֵן לָהּ בִּפְנֵי שְׁנַיִם פְּרוּטָה אוֹ שְׁוֵה פְּרוּטָה, וְאוֹמֵר לָהּ: ''הֲרֵי אַתְּ מְקֻדֶּשֶׁת לִי בָּזֶה</strong>''.  הַגָּה: וְיֵשׁ אוֹמְרִים שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹמַר לָהּ: ''כְּדַת משֶׁה וְיִשְׂרָאֵל''  (כָּל בּוֹ).   וְכֵן נוֹהֲגִין לְכַּתְחִילָה .... <strong> וְהוּא הַדִּין אִם אָמַר לָהּ: ''הֲרֵי אַתְּ מְאֹרֶסֶת לִי'', אוֹ ''הֲרֵי אַתְּ לִי לְאִשָּׁה'', וְכֵן בְּכָל לָשׁוֹן שֶׁמַּשְׁמָעוּתוּ לְשׁוֹן קִדּוּשִׁין וַדַּאי בְּאוֹתוֹ מָקוֹם, וּבִלְבַד שֶׁהִיא תָּבִין שֶׁהוּא לְשׁוֹן קִדּוּשִׁין, וְאִם הָיָה מְדַבֵּר עִמָּהּ תְּחִלָּה עַל עִסְקֵי קִדּוּשִׁין, וְנָתַן לָהּ אֲפִלּוּ בִּשְׁתִיקָה, הָוֵי קִדּוּשִׁין... וְכָל שֶׁכֵּן אִם אָמַר לְשׁוֹן קִדּוּשִׁין וַדַּאי, אֶלָּא שֶׁאֵינָהּ מְבִינָה אוֹתוֹ, דַּהֲווּ קִדּוּשִׁין</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He writes how in 1942 he was approached by a long time congregant Reb Moshe ben Aryeh who, at great personal risk, sneaked out to the fields to try and get a few potatoes from the leftovers of the harvest in order to share with his beleaguered companions. Unfortunately, the Nazis caught him and beat him to within an inch of his life to set an example, leaving him permanently deaf and mute. R Oshry describes how Reb Moshe's intellect remained intact, and he would regularly communicate with others via writing.

    "content": "# How much weight must we give to the Council of Sages opinions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I understand it, there is no hierarchy within Judaism, per se.  In fact, following a controversial decision by Rav Elyashev, he mentioned to a friend of mine that his rulings really only apply to his congregants, and no one is obligated to follow them.  And yet, in Israel and the U.S. we have Councils of Gedolim.  If one or more of them bans concerts, books, wigs, vaccines, cell phones, or counting certain Jews in a minyan, what obligation does the average shomer Shabbos Jew have to follow their rulings?  What obligation does our congregational rabbi have to follow their rulings?  Is it chutzpah or disrespectful to question the sources and accuracy on which the rabbis' decisions are based?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>@Micha Berger suggested to differentiate between (1) the need to get our halachic rulings from \"the Gedolim\" and (2) how much are we expected to listen to them beyond the domain of actual halachic rulings?</p>\n\n<p><strong>On the first question</strong>, Dr Eli Turkel wrote a very interesting article on the topic in Tradition <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2027/No.%204/The%20Nature%20And.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">(The nature and limitations of rabbinic authority)</a>. He writes there (pp. 83-84)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[…] <strong>community leaders only have religious authority if they are\n  followed by a majority of the community</strong> […] In modern times, no\n  single organization is accepted as authoritative by al Torah observant\n  Jews and, as a result, <strong>no group has the right to impose its views on\n  individuals who do not voluntarily accept them</strong>. […] Hence we\n  conclude that a modern rabbi’s authority is limited to his immediate\n  community or to those people who ask his opinion. No rabbi has the\n  right to impose his views on anyone else. (see also bottom of p. 86)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In conclusion he writes (p. 95)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We have shown that in the absence of a Great Sanhedrin, a court […] or\n  even a gadol hador can impose their halakhic opinions only if they are\n  accepted by the majority of a community. <strong>Even in that case, the\n  decisions affect only that specific community and not others</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>On the second question</strong> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Lichtenstein\" rel=\"nofollow\">R Aharon Lichtenstein</a> asks in <a href=\"http://www.zootorah.com/RationalistJudaism/DaatTorahLichtenstein.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">If There Is No Da’at, How Can We Have Leadership?</a> asks whether one can follow <em>gedolei Torah</em> in all aspects of life, based on the verse (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.11?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 17:11</a>) \"According to the teaching that they instruct you, and according to the ruling which they shall tell you, you shall act, you shall not depart from that which they tell you right or left.\" He shows there is no basis to broaden the concept of <em>da’at Torah</em> beyond halachic matters and into all areas of life.</p>\n\n<p>He shows based on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchok_Hutner\" rel=\"nofollow\">R Yitzhak Hutner</a> that, beyond halachic mastery, the <em>da’at</em> in <em>da’at Torah</em> is a combination of </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Understanding the world and soul of the person who stands in front of a questioner</li>\n<li>Understanding the reality and the situation at hand</li>\n<li>A true and honest accounting of his own conscience, which obligates him to establish whether he is indeed capable of issuing guidance on a specific issuance, and whether he possesses sufficient expertise regarding it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>R Lichtenstein says too few gedolim today can do as Rashi who writes in more than 70 places in his commentary to the Torah and the Talmud, 'I don't know’. He notes R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach was a rare exception, and before him the Rambam and the Noda BiYehuda because “they dwelled amongst their people”.</p>\n\n<p>He notes that unfortunately</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Today many of the gedolim build up tall walls around themselves, doors\n  which are bolted shut, in order that nothing which is occurring in the\n  outside world should penetrate, and drip into the walls of the study\n  hall. This is the reality in which tremendous talmidei chachamim who\n  are totally detached from reality are raised. After decades of total\n  detachment, he is drawn out from hiding, and becomes a 'gadol', a\n  leader and guide. Astonishingly, the field of his leadership is not\n  limited to Torah alone, rather he is requested and required to make\n  decisions on the very issues that he fled from in the past, that he\n  hid from for so many years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

'Tuma following rabbinic laws' but there is no Tuma following the primary Torah's law. The cause of the decrees is not our topic here.</p>\n<p>\"כל הבתים מיטמאין בנגעים, חוץ משל גויים\". in <strong>Negaym 12, 1</strong>\nThe topic is a phenomenon of alteration of dwellings building stone called Tsaraat Batim, the laws of Tsaraat Batim does not apply to houses of Non Jewish people.</p>\n<p>In the Mishna \"גוי שראה קרי, ונתגייר--מיד הוא מיטמא בזיבה\" <strong>Zavim 3, 3</strong>\nThere is an urologic phenomenon, a discharge from the urethra, which benefited from a special atatus of Tuma in Torah, this status (Mideorayta) is not accredited for the non-Jewish people.</p>\n<p>The same law is in <strong>Taharot 5, 8</strong></p>\n<p>the impurity drives people away.\nThere is no contradiction.</p>\n<p>An example of simple Tuma miderabanane is in Mishna <strong>Shabbat 9, 1</strong> \"אמר רבי עקיבה, מניין לעבודה זרה, שהיא מטמאה במשא כנידה:  שנאמר \"תזרם כמו דווה, צא תאמר לו\" (ישעיהו ל,כב)--מה הנידה מטמא במשא, אף עבודה זרה מטמא במשא\"</p>\n<p>A statue of idolatry has nothing to do with Nidda, but the Rabbis decreed that it's unclean as a Nidda.

This blessing is not composed like the other food blessings, e.g., we say <strong><em>bore</strong> pri haeitz</em>, <strong><em>bore</strong> pri haadama</em>, <strong><em>bore</strong> mine mezonot</em>, <strong><em>bore</strong> pri hagafen</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So why is <em>sheakol</em> focusing on <em>bidvaro</em>, creating all <strong>through his word</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Why not <em>she bore et hakol</em> or something similar.</p>\n\n<p>The source of the blessing (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.40b.41?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">Brakhot 40b</a>) is not of much help.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ybm.org.il/default.htm#/article?Item=757\">Rav Eliyahu Lifshitz</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivat_Birkat_Moshe\">Maaleh Adumim</a> <a href=\"http://www.toralishma.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%9B%D7%98.pdf\">explains</a> that this is based on a fundamental conceptual difference between \"<em>shehakol</em>\" and the other <em>birchoth hanehenin</em>. He suggests that really only plant life (<em>tzome'ach</em>) was originally created for consumption. Thus the <em>brachot</em> - \"<em>borei minei mezonoth</em>\"/\"<em>borei pri...</em>\" suggest thanking for the creation of foodstuff. \"<em>Shehakol</em>\" is more an acknowledgement that even these things that were not primarily created as our food, also are created with His word and deserving of this recognition.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shehakol is unique in that it thanks G-d for existence as a whole rather than the specific food in front of you. I think that's because it is defined as the berakhah you make when there is no berakhah specific to the food, or if you cannot determine the right berakhah.</p>\n\n<p>Ideally one makes the right berakhah for the occasion. After all, which would make you feel better seeing in a thank-you card, \"Dear ...., Thanks for your generous gift. I hope to use it wisely and enjoy it.\" Or, \"Thanks for that XYZ, it's exactly what we needed. Now we can...\"? Precision and awareness of what you're thanking for is indicative of greater gratitude.</p>\n\n<p>So, we can talk about how G-d created from nothing baked goods, grape juice and wine, fruit from perennial trees, other food from plants. (Why bread is \"hamotzi ... min haaretz\" instead of \"borei minei\" is a good but different question. Also, Tosefta Berakhos ch 4 and the Yerushalmi have many more specific berakhos than we use today. For example \"borei minei nefashos\" on meat, eggs and milk. Another question would be why they fell out of usage.)</p>\n\n<p>But in Shehakol, we are talking about creation as a whole. Therefore, rather than simply saying \"Borei\" -- \"Who creates\" or \"the Creator of\" this specific item, the berakhah's detail instead goes into how Creation was done.</p>\n\n<p>There is a symmetry to the structure of the berakhah:</p>\n\n<pre><code>ברוך אתה You are the Wellspring from which everything flows\n\n    ה' the Cause of existence\n\n        אלוקינו our Master of all forces (thus the plural)\n\n            מלך העולם Sovereign of the Universe\n\n        שהכל the everything, ie the universe(s)\n\n    נהיה exists\n\nבדברו through His Word\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>The first part of the berakhah is to “You”, the berakhah ends “bidvaro” — His word. One is a progression to accepting Hashem as King, the other a progression from. And there is a symmetry between the two halves. A mirror at “Malekh haOlam”.</p>\n\n<p>The tetragrammaton is the causative of \"hoveh\", present tense, to exist. (Aside from all the connotations the name carries, this is its translation.) Thus the parallel \"nihyeh\", existent.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, barukh is from bereikhah -- a spring of water. It implies a connecting flow between Creator and created. A closeness whose parallel is the closing notion that that existence is as a word Hashem speaks. \"And Hashem said 'let there be light' and it\" -- those very words 'yehi or' -- \"was light\". The Baal Shem Tov said that Genesis 1 uses speech as a metaphor for creation because speech only lasts as long as the speaker speaks. Unlike writing, which rests on the paper after the author puts down the pen. Hashem, to this very day, is saying \"yehi or\", and that is the light we see by. \"Shehakol nihyeh bidvaro\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A rav now showed me the commentary <em>Yachin uBoaz</em> (from R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Lipschitz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Israel Lipschitz</a>, the Tiferet Yisrael, maybe an ancestor of R Eliyahu Lifshitz cited in another answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/68224/11501\">on this page</a> ?) on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.6.3?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Brachot 6:3</a> saying that God directly created fruits, vegetables, grapes and cereals, therefore the bracha on these was <strong><em>bore</strong> pri/<strong>bore</strong> mine mezonot</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The language of the <em>bracha sheakol</em> is different since God didn't directly create the rest of the food but we still want to acknowledge that he indirectly created all of what exists.</p>\n\n<p>The language bidvaro parallels the language of the Torah (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.11?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 1:11</a>) \"And God <strong>said</strong>: let there be\".</p>\n\n\n",

That is, that God \"caused\" it indirectly by granting mankind the ability to act independently.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Exile is only for the criminally negligent. For example, if someone is swinging an axe and the axe-head flies off and kill someone, the person must flee to an ir miqlat (city of refuge). But if the axe head comes off because it struck the wood being chopped, or a chunk of the wood flies off and kills the person, he doesn't need to flee. It has to be the person's direct action, not indirect. Similarly, if someone falls off a ladder and kills another, he only is sentenced to exile if (1) he is descending and (2) the ladder was known to be rickety. (These cases are on Makkos 7b-8a.) It is only for deaths where we could argue that someone who took like more seriously could have prevented the tragedy.</p>\n<p>Given that the person must carry a measure of culpability, a literal read of this verse doesn't seem tenable.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the verse is a source for the Kuzari's idea in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Kuzari.5.20?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5:20</a> (slightly de-thou-ed from Hartwig Hirschfeld's 1887 -- and therefore public domain -- translation; formatting with bullets, mine, but the text mentions \"three other categories\" so I know the intent was to list 4 items):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...  My opinion is that everything of which we are conscious is referred to the Prime Cause in two ways, either as an immediate expression of the divine will, or through intermediaries. An instance of the first kind is found in the synthetic arrangement visible in animals, plants and spheres, objects which no intelligent observer would trace back to accident, but to a creative and wise will, which gives everything its place and portion. An instance of the second kind ... is to be found in the burning of a beam.</p>\n<p>You may even discover the causes of their causes till you arrive at the spheres, then at their causes, and finally at the Prime Cause. One might justly say that everything is ordained by God, and another is equally right in making man's free will or accident responsible for it, without, however, bringing it outside the divine providence. If you like, you may render the matter more intelligible by means of the following classification. Effects are either of divine or of natural origin, either accidental or arbitrary.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The divine ones issue forth actively, having no other causes except\nGod's will.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The natural ones are derived from intermediate,\npreparatory causes which bring them to the desired end, as long as no\nobstacle arises from one of the other three classes.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The accidental\nones are likewise the result of intermediary causes, but accidentally,\nnot by nature or arrangement, or by will power. They are not prepared\nto be brought to completion and standstill, and they stand apart from\nthe other three classes. As regards the arbitrary actions, they have\ntheir roots in the free will of man [see below -mb], when he is in a position to\nexercise it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Free will belongs to the class of intermediary causes,\nand possesses causes which reduce it, chainlike, to the Prime Cause.\nThis course is not compulsory, because the whole thing is potential,\nand the mind wavers between an opinion and its opposite, being\npermitted to turn where it chooses. The result is praise or blame for\nthe choice, which is not the case in the other classes. An accidental or natural cause cannot be blamed, although some of them admit a possibility. But one cannot blame a child or a sleeping person for harm done. The opposite was possible just the same, and they cannot be blamed, because they lack judgment.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice Rabbi Yehudah haLevi here has his protagonist classify free will choices as being indirectly from G-d, as are arbitrary actions. Which would fit ascribing murder by criminal negligence -- somewhere in that spectrum between choice and arbitrary -- to Him.</p>\n\n\n",

He suggests that if we were adept enough in counting this way, we would be able to reach the correct total of 600k.</p>\n\n<p>I saw that Rabbi Leff (in his book on Shemoneh Esrei) wanted to reinterpret the Talmudic phrase to be read in such a way that it doesn't claim that there are 600k letters. He suggests that the words יש ששים רבוא אותיות לתורה does not mean \"there are 600k letters in the Torah\" (which he says would have been more accurately expressed with בתורה instead of לתורה), but rather \"there are 600k letters <em>to</em> the Torah,\" which he suggests means that, in addition to the around 300k letters of the Torah, the \"Torah\" of the Jewish people, made up of 600k letters, is meant to be added.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The founder of Chabad Lubavitch suggested that the vowels would be added to the count of 304,800-plus letters to reach 600,000 total.</p>\n\n<p>Others state that the spaces between the letters for \"white letters\" that add to the count</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1254056/jewish/Where-Are-the-600000-Letters-of-the-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Where Are the 600,000 Letters of the Torah?</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://blog.ajudaica.com/2012/01/600000-letters-in-the-torah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">600,000 Letters in the Torah?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Firstly, there are several non-standard methods of counting that will\n  allow one to arrive at 600.000 letters. For example, the founder of\n  Chabad, Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi, provided a different way of\n  counting which is to count vowel letters that are not included in the\n  text but are implied in the pronunciation of the word. If all these\n  vowels were written out, there would be far more letters in the Torah\n  scroll.</p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, there is another view that explains that the count of\n  304,805 letters refers only to the letters that can be seen in black\n  ink against the white parchment. However, there are also letters in\n  white against black. The heavenly, non-physical version of the Torah\n  is described as black fire on white fire with both the black and white\n  being equally as important. The black letters are those that we can\n  see. The white space- the inverse space between the black letters- are\n  the letters we don’t see and the count of 600,000 includes both black\n  and white letters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Yes, this question was solved in year 2003/2004 by Moshe Dodo ben Barzilai.  At that time, he authored a method of gematria called Mispar haBeka, where each letter of the Hebrew alphabet is \"split\" into its component letters and then these component letters are added up, giving a new sum to each letter.  The letter Alef is comprised of two yuds and a vav, so its value is 26.  The letter Bet is composed of three vavs, so its value is 18.  Gimmel is composed of a zayin and a yud, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Later, in year 2008, an author by the name of Jeffrey Meiliken posted a blog article using a similar method to try to find the 600,000 letters of Torah.  Although, his source for the frequency of each letter in the Torah was wrong and some of the number components he used were questionable, his count came very close to 600,000.  This blog was noticed by Moshe Dodo in 2010.  Moshe checked his prior method of splitting the letters for gematria against the actual letters of Torah and found that it added up to exactly 600,000 letters.  He had the solution for all that time and didn't realize it.  He then began a discussion with Jeffrey Meiliken to compare their solutions.</p>\n\n<p>These are some caveats to the solution.  If we are to assume that the 600,000 letters correspond to the 600,000 Israelites (not including Levi who was not counted with them), we would expect to find a bit less than 600,000 letters.  The reason for this is that all of the 600,000 Israelites died except for Yehoshua, Caleb, and the families of Dathan and Abiram who \"went down alive into Sheol\".  Since Yehoshua and Caleb eventually died in the land of Israel, there remained alive several of the families of Dathan and Abiram, who were Reubenites.  The solution proposed by Moshe Dodo ben Barzilai accounts for this and identifies the letters corresponding to each member of the families of Dathan and Abiram; he provides the location for these letters in accordance with the blessing of Moshe Rabbeinu to Reuben: \"May Reuben live and not die.  And may his population [Dathan, Abiram, and their male heirs] be included in the count.\"  That is to say, even though every other letter corresponds to one of the Israelites that died, some of the letters corresponding to Reuben were originally written in black ink but they sunk into the Torah scroll.  And they should be included in the full count of the letters.</p>\n\n<p>The evidence for the sinking of certain letters into the skin of the Torah scroll is found in the words of Elisha, the prophet.  In fact, the entire solution, the gematria which is the source of the solution, and the author of the gematria, is all found encoded in the words of Elisha in the section describing the bears and the 42 boys.</p>\n\n<p>Jeffrey Meilikin's blog article and proposed solution: <a href=\"http://kabbalahsecrets.com/?p=110\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://kabbalahsecrets.com/?p=110</a></p>\n\n\n",

Gematria or isopsephy was borrowed into the Greek probably soon after their adoption of the Semitic writing system. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Maybe at first it doesn't seem like a big issue that we use this, possibly Hellenistic, method in Torah study. Until you find out there are multiple <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/11553/11052\">Halachot learned from gematria</a>. Is there an opposing opinion about the origins of gematria? If not, how can we trust this method?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Midrash (Yalkut on the Torah, Remez 20 and 692; Bereishis Rabbah 14:2; Bamidbar Rabbah 4:3; Tanchuma, Parshas Bamidbar 18) and Yerushalmi (Yevamos 4:2) record an exchange between a Greek and R' Avahu. There is a concept that some babies are to be born after seven months, while others are to be born after nine. A baby born after eight months is presumed an early nine-monther and not a late seven-monther. Therefore, the baby is presumed not viable (at least back then, when they didn't have the medical equipment we have today.) The Greek asked R' Avahu to prove that an eight-monther will not survive. R' Avahu proved it to him from Greek: <em>zeta</em>, which has a value of seven, means \"life,\" while <em>eta</em>, which has a value of eight, means \"death.\"</p>\n<p>Maharzu to the Midrash in Bereishis Rabbah explains this in light of the pasuk \"Yefes will dwell in the tents of Shem\" (Bereishis 9:27). This is interpreted to mean that there is some chochmah in Greek (Yavan was one of Yefes' sons - Bereishis 10:2) like there is in Hebrew, to the point that although a Torah may not be written in other languages, it may be written in Greek (Megillah 9b). So the fact that Gematria exists in Greek doesn't surprise me in the slightest.</p>\n<p>As far as the etymology of the word, deriving it from geōmetriā (γεωμετρία) is actually the Tosfos Yom Tov's understanding (Avos 3:18, or 3:23 in other editions).</p>\n<p>It sounds likely that it went from these languages to Assyrian, and not the other way around, though I don't have a source to back up that claim.</p>\n\n\n",

If someone reaches into a nest and begins the process of slaughtering one of the chicks, do we have to send away the mother bird? On one hand, since the slaughter was not completed in the nest, the baby bird could sort of be considered like a טרפה at the time it was removed and therefore there would be no obligation of sending away the mother bird. On the other hand, since the person can complete the slaughter and the bird will be <em>kosher</em> perhaps sending away the mother bird would be required.</p>\n\n<p>But <em>Rash\"i</em>'s comment confuses me. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מהו</strong> לחייבו בשלוח האם כיון שבידו לגמור את השחיטה תקח לך קרינא ביה וחייב לשלח או דילמא השתא מיהת כל זמן שלא גמר בהם סימנים <strong>פטור מלשלח ונוטל את האם בהיתר</strong> ואח\"כ גומר שחיטה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He says in the case where we begin the slaughter in the nest that the person is \"exempt from 'sending' and may take the mother bird and afterwards complete the slaughter [of the chick].\"</p>\n\n<p>I don't understand what <em>Rash\"i</em> is talking about here. What does he mean when he says that the person may \"take the mother\"? Doesn't he mean that he may take the chick?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's exactly as you explained. The situation is that the person started cutting, but since he only manged to cut \"מיעוט סימנים\" - they aren't kosher yet (only if he continues to cut until \"רוב סימנים\").</p>\n\n<p>So does he need to send away the mother, or can he take her for himself? Two ways of thinking of this:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If he stops cutting and let the chicks be, they will become \"טריפה\", and in this case the person is exempt from the obligation of sending away the mother (<strong>therefore, he is allowed to take her if she arrives. He's not obligated to send her away</strong>).</li>\n<li>He has the ability to continue cutting and make them kosher, so they are considered kosher, and therefore there's an obligation of sending away the mother (<strong>and he may not take her for himself</strong>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This is exactly what Rashi says.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm curious how a <em>beit din</em> would have resolved this.  (I am asking out of curiosity; I'm not a party to any of this.)</p>\n\n<p>The case involved a customer who was severely injured by a shop's automatic door.  The shop claimed that the manufacturer of the door was responsible; the manufacturer of the door claimed the shop had not performed routine maintenance and so was responsible.  The victim, of course, wasn't party to any manufacturer warranty or maintenance obligations; she just wanted groceries.  I think I have a basic understanding (from, e.g. Bava Metzia) of how cases of damages involving <em>two</em> parties might be resolved, but I don't know what happens with three.</p>\n\n<p>I could imagine that a <em>beit din</em> might say that the victim has a claim against the shop and, separately, the shop has a claim against the manufacturer.  Would they treat it as two independent cases like that, or would all parties convene?  If the latter, on what basis would the <em>beit din</em> decide how to award damages, assuming they decided damages were due?</p>\n\n<p>I'm interested in learning about the general case of how disputes are resolved when two parties are arguing about damage to a third.

In this situation, the prosecutor would have to sue both of the defendants, and beis din would rule on the liability of each independently. As a matter of convenience, a beis din may hear both cases at the same time, but not for the purpose of merging the cases but rather due to the overlap it just saves everyone involved time.</p>\n\n<p>He also told me that the practice of his beis din was not to recommend or instruct a litigant as to what lawsuits would be to their advantage. Meaning, that if this shopper would have brought charges against the shop, and beis din ruled (hypothetically) that she had no case against the shop, they would not advise her to sue the manufacturer, although they may explain to her the reason that she has no case against the shop in such a way as to make it clear to her that she may have a case against the manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p>If the beis din indeed decided that the shop was responsible for the shopper, it would then be the prerogative of the shop to press charges against the manufacturer if they thought they had a case against them.

Is there a significance to it being written in the feminine form?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>The Meaning of the Term</strong></p>\n<p>The word is written in the feminine form because the antecedent would not be the Lord (masculine), but the word for ‘prayer’ (תפלה) mentioned in the verse which is feminine. So the term ‘her song’ would be literally the ‘song of prayer’ (or better, ‘praiseful prayer’) that provides comfort in the darkness of night. According to the <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0913573884\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary</a> of the 19th Century Hebraists Keil and Delitzsch,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. . . the suffix of שִׁירֹה is the suffix of the object: a hymn in praise of Him, prayer (<em>viz</em>., praiseful prayer, <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hab%203%3A1&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hab. 3:1</a>) to the God of his life (cf. Sir. 23:4), <em>i.e</em>., who is his life, and will not suffer him to come under the dominion of death.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Significance of the Term</strong></p>\n<p>This meaning of this term appears consistent with observations from Rashi and the Masoretes, who provide insight into the significance of this term. For example, the margin notes found in both the Masoretic Text in <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/m8a5o.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Aleppo Codex</a> and <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fp4KJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Leningrad Codex</a> connect this word with the word in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Ki%204%3A32&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Ki 5:12</a>; that is, in the margin of the Leningrad Codex there is a note to continue to view the written term as “שירה,” but when reciting aloud to use the term “שירו.” (The literal meaning of “שירו” would be “his song” when aligned with <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Ki%204%3A32&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Ki 5:12</a>.) The Masoretes made the note that these two passages are the only two terms in Scripture that are to be understood with the same meaning in this way.</p>\n<p>However, as already noted <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/83984/8552\">in another posting</a>, Rashi made a correct observation from Midrash Aggadah that this term has a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_entendre\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">double-entendre</a> based on the reference to ‘and Israel dwelt’ (וּשרָא) found in the Aramaic of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam%2017%3A26&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Sam 17:26</a> in the <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1499281447\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Targum Jonathan to the Prophets</em></a>.  The Aggadah provides for the idea that Torah study occurs in day, and comfort occurs at night through praiseful prayer. Rashi appears to have consulted the Babylonian Talmud, which makes the exact same observation of the idea of ‘dwelling’ based on the Targum Aramaic of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Ki%204%3A32&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Ki 5:12</a>. The precise idea is that the study of Torah provides grace from heaven during the day whose “presence” (or praiseful prayer) will fill the night.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>b</em>. <a href=\"http://images.e-daf.com/DafImg.asp?ID=1552&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah, Folio 12B</a><br />\n“And how do we know that it is called heaven? ‘Look down from heaven and see, even from your holy and glorious habitation’ (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is.%2063%3A15&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Is. 63:15</a>).</p>\n<p>“ <strong>‘dwelling:’</strong> is where there are platoons of ministering angels, singing by night and silent by day for the sake of Israel’s glory: <strong>‘By day the Lord commands his loving kindness and in the night his song is with me’</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps%2042%3A8&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ps. 42:9</a>).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, both the Talmud and Rashi juxtapose the idea of ‘dwelling’ (Targum Aramaic of <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sam%2017%3A26&version=NASB;WLC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Sam 17:26</a> = שרָא) with the ‘praiseful prayer’ in Hebrew (שירה = feminine suffix) based on the homonym between both words in Aramaic and Hebrew, respectively. The study of Torah in the day leads to the comforting divine presence at night through ‘praiseful prayer.’ Finally, the literal idea of ‘his song’ (שירו = masculine suffix according to the Masoretic connection to <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Ki%204%3A32&version=NASB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Ki 5:12</a>) is therefore not contradicted, but is instead amplified and complemented.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is a less common orthography, but does appear elsewhere. For example, in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c0149.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 49:11</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֹֽסְרִ֤י לַגֶּ֨פֶן֙ <strong>עִירֹ֔ה</strong> וְלַשֹּֽׂרֵקָ֖ה בְּנִ֣י <em>אֲתֹנ֑וֹ</em> כִּבֵּ֤ס בַּיַּ֨יִן֙ <em>לְבֻשׁ֔וֹ</em> וּבְדַם־עֲנָבִ֖ים <strong>סוּתֹֽה</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Contrast the bolded words with the italicized words. עִירׂה, for instance, is the masculine third person possessive of עַיִר (mule).</p>\n\n<p>Compare the Aramaic suffix -הּ. For example, in the Aramaic translation (Onkelos) of the verse has לְקַרְתֵּיהּ (admittedly translating the word עִיר rather than עַיִר ).</p>\n\n<p>Hebrew also has the suffix in certain cases (e.g. אָחִיהוּ  in Micah 7:2 rather than the usual אָחִיו). However, Hebrew (unlike Aramaic) elides ה in most cases. The orthography of שִירׂה (whether \"song\" or \"dwelling\") is a remnant of the earlier pronunciation *שירהו which was later pronounced ׂשִׁירו.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16263#v=9&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad translation</a>, following Rashi, translates שירה as \"his resting place\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By day, may the Lord command His kindness, and at night, may His\n  <strong>resting place</strong> be with me, a prayer to the God of my life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi comments on שירה עמי:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>may His resting place be with me: Heb. שירה. May His resting place be\n  in our midst. שּׁירה is an expression of camping, as we translate (II\n  Sam. 17:26): “And Israel encamped,” וּשְּׁרָא. I learned this from the\n  Great Masorah, which associates this [word] with (I Kings 5:12): “And\n  his songs (שירו) were a thousand and five,” in the “aleph-beth” of two\n  words with different meanings (homonyms). This taught [me] that this\n  is not an expression of song, but the Midrash Aggadah does interpret\n  it as an expression of song, interpreting in this manner: Israel says\n  to the Holy One, blessed be He: “We remember what You did for us in\n  Egypt. You commanded us one commandment by day on the eve of the\n  Passover, and we observed it, and at night, You redeemed us and we\n  sang Hallel before You. But now we keep many commandments, yet You do\n  not redeem us. Because of this, I will say to God, my Rock, ‘Why have\n  You forgotten me?...’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How can G-d regret anything?",
    "content": "# How can G-d regret anything?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Does G-d regret making or creating something?</em> Of course not! I've always considered this question silly and somewhat inappropriate, knowing that G-d is perfect, knows everything, has infinite wisdom and can't make errors.<br/>\nSo I was shocked when I recently read <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27715/11052\">this answer</a> in Mi Yodeya, quoting from the Gemara that indeed G-d does regret creating not just one, but four things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sukkah 52b:</p>\n<p>ארבעה מתחרט עליהן הקדוש ברוך הוא שבראם ואלו הם: גלות, כשדים, וישמעאלים ויצר הרע<br/>\nThere are four that the Holy One, Blessed is He, regrets having created. And these are they: The exile, the Chaldeans, the Ishmaelites, and the evil inclination.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can G-d regret anything if He doesn't make errors? And if He regrets creating the Ishmaelites, why doesn't He destroy them?</p>\n<p>I also recalled that the Torah literally says G-d regretted having created man in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0106.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 6:6</a>. Why isn't man on the list?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch states (on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8171#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Noach 6:6</a>) that this is not a matter or \"regretting\" a decision (as a man would regret a mistake), but that the expression of Man's free will caused an external series of events. An example that Rav Hirsch uses is Shaul Hamelech. That is, we cannot understand Hashem and we are attempting to explain what it is we see or that happens in human terms. Thus we anthropomorphize the description of Hashem by using human terms like <em>regret</em>. However, we have to be careful not to take such terms literally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Of course Hashem had appointed Shaul to be King, but when Shaul\n  rendered himself unworthy to continue reigning, Shaul's alteration in\n  behavior caused Hashem to alter His decision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that these expressions are necessary to teach the concept of free will and that Hashem does not punish without careful examination of Man's deeds.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The two anthropomorphic expressions here save the two essential\n  conceptions: the freedom, the free-will of Hashem and that of Man. \n  Not for nothing does it say, \"When Hashem saw etc\". The wickedness of\n  Man was not a matter of necessity. Hashem had to see it before He knew\n  it. This expression gives us the guarantee of human free-will. And the\n  fate that overtook mankind was not the result of physical causes which\n  followed set laws, it was preceded by an examination by Hashem and His\n  decision; the decision itself pained the Decider. All this presupposes\n  the personality and free-will of Hashem and keeps this clear in our\n  minds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Rashi says</p>\n\n<p><strong>And the Lord regretted that He had made:</strong> Heb. וַיִנָּחֶם. It was a consolation to Him that He had created him [man] of the earthly beings, for had he been one of the heavenly beings, he would have caused them to rebel. [This appears in Genesis Rabbah (27:40).</p>\n\n<p><strong>and He became grieved:</strong> [I.e.,] man [became grieved],</p>\n\n<p><strong>in His heart:</strong> [the heart] of the Omnipresent. It entered the thought of God to cause him [man] grief. This is the translation of Onkelos [i.e., Onkelos supports the view that וַיִּתְעַצֵּב refers to man]. Another explanation of וַיִּנָּחֶם: The thought of the Omnipresent turned from the standard of clemency to the standard of justice. It entered His thoughts to reconsider what to do with man, whom He had made upon the earth. And similarly, every expression of נִחוּם in Scripture is an expression of reconsidering what to do. [For example] (Num. 23:19): “Nor the son of man that He should change His mind (וְיִתְנֶחָם)”; (Deut. 32:36): “And concerning His servants He will change His mind (יִתְנֶחָם)”; (Exod. 32:14): “And the Lord changed His intent concerning the evil (וַיִּנָּחֶם)”; (I Sam. 15:11): “I regret (נִחַמְתִּי) that I made [Saul] king.” These are all an expression of having second thoughts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>and He became grieved:</strong> Heb. וַיִּתְעַצֵּב, He mourned over the destruction of His handiwork [i.e., according to this second view, וַיִּתְעַצֵּב refers to God], like (II Sam. 19:3): “The king is saddened (נֶעֱצַב) over his son.” This I wrote to refute the heretics: A gentile asked Rabbi Joshua ben Korchah, “Do you not admit that the Holy One, blessed be He, foresees the future?” He [Rabbi Joshua] replied to him, “Yes.” He retorted, “But it is written: and He became grieved in His heart!” He [Rabbi Joshua] replied, “Was a son ever born to you?” “Yes,” he [the gentile] replied. “And what did you do?” he [Rabbi Joshua] asked. He replied, “I rejoiced and made everyone rejoice.” “But did you not know that he was destined to die?” he asked. He [the gentile] replied, “At the time of joy, joy; at the time of mourning, mourning.” He [Rabbi Joshua] said to him, “So is it with the work of the Holy One, blessed be He; even though it was revealed before Him that they would ultimately sin, and He would destroy them, He did not refrain from creating them, for the sake of the righteous men who were destined to arise from them.” - [from Gen. Rabbah 27:4]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I agree with Maimonides that G-d does not has emotions. “I am G-d who does not change (Mal. 3:6). And if He were sometimes angry and sometimes happy, He would be changing (MT, Hilkhot Yesodei HaTorah, 1:12). Yet Maimonides failed to convince most Jews that G-d does not have emotions. For example, Gerald Schroeder, a well-respected scientist wrote that G-d regretted making humans (the flood of Noah). This is not very satisfying. </p>\n\n<p>I prefer Radak who wrote: “When it says that He ‘regretted,’ this is the Torah speaking in human terms” (view of Rabbi Ishmael).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>Man was made in the image of God (Bereshit 1:27), so it is not surprising that God has feelings (regrets - Bereshit 6:7, mercy - Shemot 32:12-14, jealousy - Shemot 34:14) e.t.c This does not make God any less perfect. On the other hand, as answer above points out, God is not man so he does not lie (Bemidbar 23:19). So while God has feelings, they never result in bad actions. Emotions of God a part of God's plan. They are predetermined but they exist nevertheless.</p>\n<p>See Derech Mitzvotecha Ha'amanut Elokut 4-8 for a fuller treatment of God's emotions, so to speak.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ger Tzedek/Tzadik earliest sources and definition\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I understand a \"Ger Tzedek/Tzadik\" is a fully converted follower of the Torah of Moshe. According to Hilchot Melachim 10:3-4, a \"Ger Tzedek\" is defined as someone who has confirmed their conversion (out of a sincere and deep conviction in the truth of the Jewish religion, without any other motivation whatever). Later on (in verse 12), we see that a \"Ger Tzedek\" must non-selectively accept all of the mitzvot of the Torah of Moshe.  The convert who accepts the responsibility to fulfill the mitzvos – the Torah’s path of  tzedek –  is therefore called a ger tzedek. It is this commitment which enables the convert to become a member of Israel – the people of the Covenant. Just as all Israel became the people of the Covenant by proclaiming at Mount Sinai: '<em>Everything that Hashem has spoken, we will do and we will hear</em>' (Exodus 24:7), so too, the convert joins the people by making a similar commitment (like Ruth). Our tradition finds a reference to this idea in the following Divine statement: '<em>The convert who dwells with you shall be like a native among you</em>' (Leviticus 19:34). According to the tradition, these words are revealing the following guideline which the rabbinical court that accepts the convert must follow: <em>'Just as the native Israelite accepted all the words of the Torah, so does the convert. (Toras Kohanim)'</em></p>\n\n<p>But what i would like to know is how this term 'Ger Tzedek' came to exist:  what are it's earliest sources? and can it be literally found in the Tenach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/taleley/ger-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's</a> an interesting article on this subject.</p>\n\n<p>In short, the term <em>ger tzedek</em> is only used in a small fraction of the <em>gemara</em> when speaking about converts. In most cases, even when \"full converts\" are spoken of, the simple title <em>ger</em> is used. The term <em>ger tzedek</em> was introduced in order to emphasize the differences between a full convert, and a <em>ger toshav</em> who is only obligated to the Seven Laws of Noah.</p>\n\n<p>Examples where this differentiation is required (more in the article):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Gittin 57b:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנא: נעמן גר תושב היה, נבוזראדן גר צדק היה</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p><strong>Yevamot 48b:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשהוא אומר \"וגרך אשר בשעריך\" - הרי גר צדק אמור, הא מה אני מקיים \"והגר\"? - זה גר תושב</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The reason for the specific choice of <em>tzedek</em> is also discussed there, mainly since the word <em>tzedek</em> appears many times in the bible referencing the Torah, the <em>Shechina</em>, etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It could be from Tannaitic literature Midrash or the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible. We know for sure that the rabbis (Second Temple times) understood גר תושב (ger toshav) to mean a non-Jew who fulfills some biblical commandments while (ger she-nitgayyer) or (ger tzedek), meaning “a righteous ger,\" refers to a convert who underwent the practice of conversion. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The earliest source I can find is in the Shemona Esrei we say daily</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>על הצדיקים ועל החסידים ועל זקני עמך בית ישראל ועל פליטת סופריהם ועל\n  גרי-הצדק.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting to note in the Selichos of the fourth day of the Aseres Yemei Teshuva from Rabbeinu Gershom Meor Hagola</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גר צדק הראשון לכל נציבים,  בן שלש הכירך יושב כרובים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/kitveyet/taleley/ger-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daat.ac.il</a> for this answer</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Advanced Tanya Shiurim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard it said many times that Lubavitch hasidim learn chassidus like it's gemara. It's easy enough to see what an advanced gemara shiur looks like, being something that presupposes a familiarity with the style and structure (and to an extent, the content) of the Talmud's commentaries and meta-commentaries - but what does an advanced shiur in Sefer Tanya look like? I'm not claiming to be at an advanced level (I'm definitely not); I'd just like to know what it means to learn chassidus \"like it's gemara\". Can be Hebrew or English.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>When a beginner learns Gemara, one of the greatest setbacks is the lack of \"prerequisite\" knowledge. Many concepts are preestablished, including the 13 middos of learning Torah (gzeira shava, binyan av etc. etc.), and even more so there are different styles of sugiyos, how a question is established, how a terutz is attempted and so on.</p>\n\n<p>The seasoned learner will be able to run through a page of Gemara, quickly recognizing through the nuances in the language what exactly is going on. Of course, today we have the Kehati Mishnayos to help us get much of the prerequisite knowledge for understanding a sugiya prior to learning it--much like a hakdama to a shiyur.</p>\n\n<p>And then there's another, deeper level of Gemara learning, which is where the iyun comes in. Deep knowledge (characterized by a detailed, broad understanding) of various other masechtot will deepen one's understanding of other masechtot. Suddenly Tosfos will take on a new light, (rather than have to look up the masechet that Tosfos is referring to, you'll already know exactly what he's talking about, and his question will ring clearly in your head, arousing more questions which will prompt your delving into the sea of meforshim.</p>\n\n<p>The above is what I would consider a sample of what learning Gemara be'iyun should look like (although there are, of course, many styles...the above is only a partial example, perhaps of the Chabad style of learning Gemara--since that is what I am familiar with).</p>\n\n<p>So now, here is the parallel, Chassidus version (don't worry it's not as long--I'll summarize):</p>\n\n<p>In Chassidus, there are dozens (if not hundreds...) of concepts. Much like the various styles of sugiyos mentioned above in Gemara, there are types of concepts which force one to think in slightly abstract (but very practical) concepts. Like with Kehati, there are books explaining the different concepts on their own, and often these books (as well as books explaining specific Chassidic works--Chassidus Mevoeres notably among them) are essential for anyone attempting to learning on their own (in a way similar to Schottenstein Gemaras).</p>\n\n<p>A seasoned student of Chassidus will have been trained in Chassidic thought--a glance at a maamar (a technical term for a work of Chassidus) will show him what type it is, what concepts are being discussed, and what new depth to look for.</p>\n\n<p>An advanced shiyur, then, like the ones mentioned above, by R' Yoel Kahn, will assume the listener has been conditioned to a deep style of thinking. Anyone else can of course listen, and not understand what all the storm is about... (By the way, the majority of online shiyurim by R' Yoel Kahn can be found on <a href=\"http://otzerhachassidus.com\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://otzerhachassidus.com</a> and chassidus.com).</p>\n\n<p>But all in all, I think the following is the most important point of all, in response to the question:\nLike in Gemara, a learner of any level in Chassidus, is expected to understand fully well what the text means before continuing onwards. It happens all too often that someone will consider himself (or is considered) very knowledgeable in Chassidus (there is no lack of rabbis who fit this example), when in fact all they know is words and how to say the technical explanation of concepts by heart from all sorts of sources (like texbook answers). But in reality the depth of understanding is totally lacking.</p>\n\n<p>Someone who truly learns Gemara, for example, can't run through the page--Rashi, Tosfos and all--and really believe that he fully understood the first time! He must examine the page one line at a time, see if he really got it, ask a question, examine the response, see if he really understood that Rashi, and sometimes realize that he has an essential misunderstanding since the very beginning of the page!</p>\n\n<p>Likewise, when learning Chassidus, the learner must examine every line; ask; ponder; consider; reject!; consider again...and so on. This is called Chassidus be'iyun, and learning for a few years in this manner has a substantial, deep rooted impact on the person. Relearning old works with newly acquired knowledge gains brand new depth, almost every single time they are revisited....</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The most advanced online Shiur in Tanya you will find is from Rabbi Yoel Kahn.\nHis Hebrew Shiurim cover the first two sections, you can hear them <a href=\"http://www.yahadut.tv/Lecture-VideoList.asp?MediaCategoryID=133&SupplierID=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yahadut.tv/Lecture-VideoList.asp?MediaCategoryID=123&SupplierID=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The Yiddish Shurim cover almost all of Tanya and are available <a href=\"http://www.chassidus.com/audio/tanya-kahn/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. </p>\n\n<p>His students are compiling them into Hebrew in print (written about <a href=\"http://www.shturem.net/index.php?section=news&id=60443\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://insidechassidus.org/tanya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://insidechassidus.org/tanya</a> \nThere are different levels here. </p>\n\n<p>He also has shuirim on many topics in chassidus and hashkafa</p>\n\n<p>All are in english</p>\n\n\n",

For example, does the groom put the ring onto the bride's finger? There are varying customs.

Some communities would just pass the ring in such a situation.</p>\n\n<p>Also, since the couple cannot consummate the marriage, and has never been together before, there are <em>yichud</em> issues, and they may not sleep together alone in the same room (Shulchan Aruch Yoreh De'ah 192:4). Similarly, they should \"hide\" someone in the <em>yichud</em> room after the chuppah, because real <em>yichud</em> is not permitted at that point.

Kelei Heres. cannot be Kashered with Hag'ala, as we will show in Shulchan Aruch.<br/><br/></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Shulhan Aruch Orah Chayim Siman 451 Sayf 1<br/></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ceramic dishes that have been used for hametz the whole year, even if they were used for oats or other grains, should be wiped well such that there is no noticeable hametz left, and then it is permitted to keep them until after Passover and use them either for what they were used for before Passover or something different. They should be hidden on Passover in a hidden place where one does not normally go, lest one come to use them on Passover. It is good to close them in a room and to hide the key. But refiring it in fire does not work for any ceramic item that was used for hot things, even if it was not used on the fire and boiling liquid was just poured into it. <strong>Rem\"a</strong>: There are those who forbid even for the second container (the Magid chapter 5). Even if they are filled with coals, we are concerned that he will be worried that the containers will crack (meaning that they will break) and will not do a complete refiring. However, if he returns them to the furnace where they make new ceramic items, it is permitted. Because they are sent into a big fire like this, clearly he will not be concerned that they will break. But this is not true of our ovens. Rem\"a: For every object that needs to be made white-hot or scalding, it is forbidden to use it even for cold things without kashering it (Mordechai at the beginning of Chapter Kol Shaah). See in Yoreh Deah Chapter 121. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the pot is glazed,  is the surface layer regarded as glass, \"Keli Zechuchit, this is a next question and what is the status of Zechuchit too.</p>\n\n<p>When a terra cotta pot is used with boiling aliments, there is no way to make Hag'ala. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Theoretically, it is possible to heat up to high temperature to burn\norganic absorbed material.

I did not find this Din in Shulchan Aruch, maybe that in this case too, we are concerned that he will be worried that the containers will crack. </p>\n\n<p>(The interesting here is that the Torah here seems to treat a an other issue than Kashrut.

    "content": "# The Rambam on a forced get\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The famous Rambam(Hilchos Geirushin 2:20) where he writes that if a man is required to divorce his wife (which were enumerated in Hilchos Ishus) and he doesn't want to divorce her ,beis din can force him to give a get. The Rambam writes that this get works is because forcing doesn't work only in a case when it has no connection to Torah observances(sale of land,presents). However,in this case it is his yetzer Harah which is stopping him and really he wants to fulfill his obligation. </p>\n\n<p>My question is that the Rambam writes that this person deep down wants to be part of Israel and wants to keep the mitzvos. Do we say this about a man who became an apikores or mumar which does not fall intof the category of letiavon (for pleasure purposes) or the Rambam meant only in a case where the person is a shomer shabbas?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Rambam's language strongly implies that the answer to your question is no. He writes that the reason why we say that it is merely the case that \"his inclination is forcing him\" to do evil is because he wants to remain Jewish and his general overarching will is to do the right thing: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>מֵאַחַר שֶׁהוּא רוֹצֶה לִהְיוֹת מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל וְרוֹצֶה הוּא לַעֲשׂוֹת כָּל הַמִּצְוֹת וּלְהִתְרַחֵק מִן הָעֲבֵרוֹת</strong> וְיִצְרוֹ הוּא שֶׁתְּקָפוֹ וְכֵיוָן שֶׁהֻכָּה עַד שֶׁתָּשַׁשׁ יִצְרוֹ וְאָמַר רוֹצֶה אֲנִי כְּבָר גֵּרֵשׁ לִרְצוֹנוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is how the Rambam is understood by the Maharik (Shoresh 73, 3), the Shiltei Giborim quoting the Riaz (Gittin 59a in the Rif), Shut Maharitatz (1:83), and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_788_388.pdf\">Shut Machaneh Chayim 2:2</a> </p>\n\n<p>Admittedly, not everyone reads the Rambam in this manner (see Shut Avodas HaGeirshuni 39 and Chazon Ish Hil. Gittin no. 99). Additionally, it should be pointed out that whatever the Rambam may have meant, the halakha might not conform to it. See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x8230\">Even HaEzer 154:1</a> especially</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rav Menashe Klein brings different opinions <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9109&st=&pgnum=442&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (in קונטרסים גיטין on סימן קכ\"א). He quotes the Shut Maharik 63:3 who says that this reason of the Rambam does not apply to someone who converted away from Judaism, however here he says the Rambam agrees that the Rabbis simply invalidated the Kiddushin because of how much they wanted to avoid an Aguna - so in practice forcing works.</p>\n\n<p>He then quotes the Chasam Sofer Vol. 1 131:1 who says that it applies even to a Mumar, and goes on to question if they truly disagree, or if the Chasam Sofer would agree to a Mumar who is deliberately rebelling against Hashem rather than a מומר לתואבון would indeed be unable to be forced according to this reason.</p>\n\n<p>In summation he ends up with three options: It never applies to a Mumar, it applies to a Mumar LeToavon only, and a third option that applies to a anyone who doesn't want to divorce qua divorce, but not to someone who doesn't want to divorce because he is against the concept of a Get and a religious divorce.</p>\n\n<p>He then goes on to mention - without elaboration - that the Chelkas Yoav and the Or Sameiach argue that the Rambam would say it applies to everyone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Rambam does not specify whether this concept applies to someone who does not want to be a Jew/part of the Jewish people, he just sort of assumes that this Jewish man (or perhaps all Jewish men) wants to be part of the Jewish people:  </p>\n\n<p>לְפִיכָךְ זֶה שֶׁאֵינוֹ רוֹצֶה לְגָרֵשׁ מֵאַחַר שֶׁהוּא רוֹצֶה לִהְיוֹת מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל וְרוֹצֶה הוּא לַעֲשׂוֹת כָּל הַמִּצְוֹת וּלְהִתְרַחֵק מִן הָעֲבֵרוֹת וְיִצְרוֹ הוּא שֶׁתְּקָפוֹ וְכֵיוָן שֶׁהֻכָּה עַד שֶׁתָּשַׁשׁ יִצְרוֹ וְאָמַר רוֹצֶה אֲנִי כְּבָר גֵּרֵשׁ לִרְצוֹנוֹ.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it is unclear based purely on the wording of the Mishneh Torah whether Rambam was trying to say that all Jews deep down inside want to be part of the Jewish people and perform mitzvot and therefore this would apply to everyone, or if his statement is limited to only those who have not made it explicitly clear that they do not want to be part of the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n",

If the Beis Din used (decided by the process above) allows Za.B.L.A, usually either side could insist on it. Many Batei Din nowadays will not agree to Za.B.L.A (R' Moshe Feinstein stopped sitting in Za.B.L.A cases after he realised the corruption that they can cause.

The difference is that those before him viewed God as the creator and even controller of the world but without a close level of interaction.

His Torah was the Torah of pure spirituality which does not involve physicality. He is, therefore, the authority on the disconnect between spiritual heights and physical depravity. Therefore, Yaakov visited the Yeshiva of Shem and Ever on his way to Lavan (Rashi to Bereishis 28:11) - a Yeshiva in which one does not sleep (neglect of the body) - in order to understand the Torah of disconnected spirituality, as Lavan had a lofty neshama and was a miserable wretch. Rivka had a pregnancy which she believed to be one individual with very polar opposite pulls. When she walked by a Beis Medrash, Yaakov would start squirming to come out, and when she passed by a house of idolatry, Eisav would squirm to come out (Rashi to Bereishis 25:22). But she did not know that this was two diametrically opposite babies inside her until after she was given that answer - she thought it was one child with an extreme disconnect between his spirituality and the impact it would have on how he lived his life. Therefore, she consulted Shem.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham, on the other hand, believed in spirituality which manifests itself in your every day life. His name was 248 in gematria corresponding to the 248 limbs which are involved in serving Hashem. Nimrod had Avraham thrown into a furnace but left Shem alone (made him a king, no less - Shem was Malkitzedek) because Avraham's was a threatening philosophy but Shem's spirituality did not infringe on how they wanted to live their lives.</p>\n\n<p>So, Avraham was the innovator of the concept of bringing spirituality into the mundane every day life and actions.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are Cherubim (כרובים) on top of the ark exception or contradiction?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Jews are forbidden to create any graven images of anything in the heavens yet Hashem commanded the ark be adorned with cherubim. </p>\n\n<p>Is this an exception or a contradiction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It's a clear exception. I heard Rabbi Benjamin Blech suggest that Judaism values education so highly that God made an exception to allow that imagery -- note that the Cherubim had the faces of a young boy and girl.</p>\n\n<p>Anything other than this exception, however, would be a problem. The Talmud says that even putting one extra Cherub on the Ark would be in violation of the law against images!</p>\n\n<p>In short, the prohibition is against any images other than those specified.</p>\n\n<p>(Similarly, we are told not to slaughter or burn on the Sabbath, but there are daily sacrifices mandated for the Sabbath. Thus, \"don't slaughter or burn anything other than specified.\")</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is known that the heathen in those days built temples to stars, and set up in those temples the image which they agreed upon to worship; because it was in some relation to a certain star or to a portion of one of the spheres. We were, therefore, commanded to build a temple to the name of God, and to place therein the ark with two tables of stone, on which there were written the commandments \"I am the Lord,\" etc., and \"Thou shalt have no other God before me,\" etc. Naturally the fundamental belief in prophecy precedes the belief in the Law, for without the belief in prophecy there can be no belief in the Law. But a prophet only receives divine inspiration through the agency of an angel. Comp. \"The angel of the Lord called\" (Gen. xxii. 15); \"The angel of the Lord said unto her\" (ibid. xvi. 11); and other innumerable instances. Even Moses our Teacher received his first prophecy through an angel. \"And an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the flame of fire\" (Exod. iii.). It is therefore clear that the belief in the existence of angels precedes the belief in prophecy, and the latter precedes the belief in the Law...From the preceding remarks it is clear that the belief in the existence of angels is connected with the belief in the Existence of God; and the belief in God and angels leads to the belief in Prophecy and in the truth of the Law. In order to firmly establish this creed, God commanded [the Israelites] to make over the ark the form of two angels. The belief in the existence of angels is thus inculcated into the minds of the people, and this belief is in importance next to the belief in God's Existence; it leads us to believe in Prophecy and in the Law, and opposes idolatry. If there had only been one figure of a cherub, the people would have been misled and would have mistaken it for God's image which was to be worshipped, in the fashion of the heathen; or they might have assumed that the angel [represented by the figure] was also a deity, and would thus have adopted a Dualism. By making two cherubim and distinctly declaring \"the Lord is our God, the Lord is One,\" Moses clearly proclaimed the theory of the existence of a number of angels; he left no room for the error of considering those figures as deities, since [he declared that) God is one, and that He is the Creator of the angels, who are more than one.</p>\n<p>Rambam, Guide for the Perplexed 3:45</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The TL;DR for this is that the belief in one G-d, and a multiplicity of angels is fundamental to the law. Without angels, there would be no prophecy, and therefore, there would be no Torah. Therefore, the image of angels were placed in the temple to solidify belief in angels. If only one image was in there, it would have been assumed that either the angel was hashem himself being worshiped, or it would have been believed that there was only one angel, which would be a form a dualism. Therefore, two images were placed in the temple to teach the unity of hashem and the multiplicity of angels.</p>\n<p>Because this teaching is fundamental to Judaism, hashem established the images of the angels as a positive commandment. A positive commandment always overrides a negative commandment. The worship of graven images is a negative commandment that one should die before violating. However, as the purpose of these images is to establish the foundation of torah, the exact opposite of idolatry, it is not a concern that they will be worshiped.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramchal (there is a sefer called Kisvei Kabbalah shel ha'Ramchal, this is towards the end of the sefer) explains that the cherubs on the ark correspond to the cherubs in Bereishis that guard the way to the Tree of Life together with the fiery revolving sword.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially he explains that the cherubs are the simple childlike meaning of life which is always true. The fiery revolving sword represents conflict and complication that we experience embodying that simplicity in olam ha'zeh.</p>\n\n<p>Once you enter the kodesh ha'kedashim you have passed from the realm of the fiery revolving sword and encounter the cherubs gaurding the luchos which are the Tree of Life.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore at this point the prohibition of creating an image no longer applies because the image is one with its meaning that leads to God.</p>\n\n\n",

(When it comes to personal requests, they get fulfilled very differently at very different times since their deliverance may not be related. For example, health can be granted very independently from livelihood (but not necessarily).)</p>\n\n<p>Why are the Mashaich-related requests treated as separate if they are truly deeply interrelated? Wouldn't it be logical to have one request for one event?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Raavan (cited by Avudarham at the end of Shemoneh Esrei) writes that there are two groups of 6 blessings that make up the middle section (with sh'ma koleinu being a general summary not in either group), which parallel each other. Thus, <em>atta chonein</em> parallels <em>t'ka b'shofar</em>. (See inside for explanations of the parallelism). Thus, each element of the last 6 corresponds conceptually to an element of the first 6. Grouping them into one blob would lose this parallelism.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Rabbeinu Bachya (Devarim 11:13) writes that the 18 berachos  were modeled off of the 12 permutations of the four-letter name of Hashem (in which 2 letters are the same, yielding 12 unique permutations), with 3 at the beginning, 3 at the end, and 6 in the middle which are doubled as individual and public versions of the same idea (he excludes <em>lamalshinim</em> which was added later). So again we find a significance to the conceptual parallelism between the first 6 and last 6.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Megillah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=17b&format=pdf\">17b</a>) explains that these 6 blessings are a process, in which each leads to the next but they are not identical nor simutaneous and are not \"one event.\" For example, ingathering and reunification of the exiles will lead to reinstatement of the courts and the judgement of the wicked, but the first must come before the second (perhaps in light of the Rambam <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=79&perek=4&halocha=11\">hilchos Sanhedrin 4:11</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While Yez is correct, I just want to add another idea I heard once. </p>\n\n<p>It's very easy for individual Jews and the nation as a whole to forget about the redemption. They can easily find their place in their host country comfortable enough, and not appreciate the importance of the redemption at all. By giving the Redemption pride of place in the Shemoneh Esreh, it remains at the forefront of national consciousness, at least if people pray seriously.</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively, if we were to compose our own prayers, we would definitely include a prayer for health and livelihood. Probably help from our enemies too, and a request for knowledge and perhaps forgiveness. Would we really bother to ask for the Redemption in each prayer? Chazal knew better, and insured that we would give the Redemption the respect it deserves.</p>\n\n\n",

Does not each one get what he deserves, and is there not an objective standard of judgement?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the tanya it means that the righteous have removed the evil inclination to the point where the good inclination is the \"presiding judge\" and as such the righteous person does not normally have evil desires.</p>\n\n<p>The wicked person through sin has given control to the evil inclination and so it is the \"presiding judge\" and so most of his natural thoughts are of non-good things. </p>\n\n<p>And the \"average person\" the two inclinations are evenly matched and so his natural desires are evenly split between good and evil. </p>\n\n<p>Understand that the tanya definition of righteous evil and average are different then one might expect. Not 51% mitzvos 49% sins makes one a righteous person, a rasha the reverse and an average person split evenly. Rather he defines them by how much one has  removed his evil inclination and allowed his good inclination to take over. </p>\n\n<p>See tanya chapters 1, and 10-13 (in 1 and 13 he actually quotes the Gemara in question)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rav Kook, in his book Ein Aya on this segment (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%98_%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">9, 221</a>), reads it differently from your translation (in my opinion, this also fits the verses that were brought as \"proofs\" better).</p>\n\n<p>The term \"יצר הטוב שופטן\" is explained by the Rav Kook as \"the <em>yezter hatov</em> serves as their judge\" - not that it judges <strong>them</strong>, but that their judgement (of other things) is managed by their <em>yetzer tov</em>. </p>\n\n<p>We judge everything with our mind - so our mind is the judge. However, the Rav Kook explains that this isn't exactly true. We do not judge things coldly and purely logically. All \"ענייני המוסר\", issues of morality, cannot be clearly and coldly cut and judged by the mind. Eventually, it comes down to one's \"יושר הלב\" - the \"moral health\" of one's nature.</p>\n\n<p>So a person's moral feelings are intertwined with each and every moral judgement that his mind decrees. If he is righteous, his \"judge\" will be his <em>yezer hatov</em> - his good morality. And if he is evil, those evil feelings will affect his judgement, and his \"judge\" will be <em>yetzer hara</em>.</p>\n\n<p>One last question. Since most people are \"בינונים\" - between righteous and evil - they have both <em>yetzarim</em> affect their judgement. So maybe in this case we can say that their \"judge\" is the pure mind - it has both sides and therefore can decide logically.</p>\n\n<p>But no, this is not true. Morality cannot be judged in itself. It is always connected to the inner feelings and nature of the person judging. So they too cannot judge things 100% with the logical, pure mind. Both <em>yezter</em>s will affect their judgement - both their good and bad inclinations. Therefore, obviously, it is better to be righteous, so that one's judgements can be as true as possible in our life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The verb to judge is used from retrospective and prospective points of view.

Based on this, many (e.g. Rashash on Yuma\n  53b and Chasam Sofer on our verses) explain that this is why there was\n  no Ark in the Second Temple, as the Luchos were “hidden” (or in exile,\n  see Yuma 53b) along with the Ark from the First Temple (shortly before\n  its destruction). This is contrasted with the Choshen, the Kohain\n  Gadol’s breastplate, which was worn in the Second Temple even though\n  the “Urim v’Tumim” were also lost, despite the Torah also telling us\n  (28:30) to put the Urim v’Tumim inside the Choshen. Since those\n  instructions weren’t repeated, the Choshen was allowed (and needed for\n  the Temple service) even without the Urim v’Tumim, while a Luchos-less\n  Ark was not. Some (e.g. Meshech Chachmah) point out that there is a\n  general rule regarding Temple service that whenever a law detail is\n  repeated, the service is not valid without the detail being fulfilled;\n  since putting the Luchos inside the Ark was repeated, the Ark cannot\n  be used without them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That the Ark isn’t really considered a valid “Ark” without the Luchos\n  inside is explicitly stated by Ramban (40:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A very partial element of response.\nFollowing the <strong>Mishna Shekalim</strong> (6,2), the Ark was hidden and not missed.\nBut following the <strong>Mishna Yoma</strong> (5, 2), the Ark was swept away. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemoro Yoma (53B-54A) provides many details on the various opinions</p>\n\n<p>According to many opinions, the Ark is not really missing but intentionally hidden in the Beith Hamikdash (two opinion about his place). So it is not surprising that they did not think to build another, if it was an unavoidable (despite a concern to protect it and its content) necessity to place an Ark, it would be enough to dig it up. I assume that it was prohibited to dig it up, perhaps because they new that the second Bet Hamikdash would be destroyed. So, for the same reason, they did not build a new Aron. For the opinion that the Aron was in Bavel, I don't know. See also the Ben Yehoyada about this Machloket.</p>\n\n\n",

However, firing is needed at the beginning, whether it is used in an oven, a frying pan, a stew-pot without water, or on the ground. However, some forbid putting [the bread] on first and then firing, and it is good to be careful.

Rather it seems concerned that the matzah cooks all the way through, and it is assuming that one is cooking matzah that is soft and thicker than a finger breadth, we know this to be the case because of how it discusses fulfilling the mitzvah of matzah.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One fulfills his obligation with matzo that is baked enough so that no threads can be pulled from it. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The matzah is finished when one pulls apart the matzah and there are no uncooked threads, which cannot happen in the matzah we have now, the matzah that is probably cooked between 600-800 degrees. At least, this is the argument <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:rD2_4iZImC8J:www.realmatza.com/ovens-too-hot.html%20&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us\" rel=\"nofollow\">this website</a> makes, claiming that ovens in contrast could be too hot, stating that poskim ruled that one could matzah on paper, which burns at 392 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>\n\n<p>The same argument that an oven shouldn't be too hot because it might cook the outside instantaneously while leaving the center uncooked is made in <a href=\"http://www.hakirah.org/Vol17Zivotofsky.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This development might\n  have been related to the changing nature of ovens. Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu\n  Henkin (Lev Ivra, p. 40) makes a very important point about the oven\n  temperature. He says that if, while baking thick matzah, the oven is too\n  hot the outside will burn and the inside will still be unbaked. And, he\n  suggests, the halakhik indicators related to ḥimutz (browned outside and\n  stringy dough) won't help because they are valid only with ovens at lower\n  temperature, as were used in talmudic times. This is less of a problem for\n  the baking of thin matzot, but he cautions that the oven temperature\n  should nonetheless not be too hot. He says that this is all based on experience\n  and it is worth noting that he lived among Georgian Jews for many\n  years. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yet one of the leading halachic authorities has ruled in the following ways:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe OC 1:153) was asked about baking Matza on a stove-top and rules that the temperature must be at least hot enough \"that straw would burn\" or else we would have to worry that it is Chametz. He notes that the \"classical\" cooking temperatures of Yad Soledet Bo (~150°F) or boiling (212°F) are definitely insufficient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Taking all these sources at face value would lead one to think there is contradicting information, or that there are two sets of rules: One set of rules for thick soft matzah, and possibly another set for thin dry matzah.</p>\n\n<p>So with all of these factors considered, is there truly a certain minimum baking temperature for matzah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>As you note in the Shulchan Arukh (OC 461:2), a temperature which is too low (and is not \"boils and cooks instantly [such that] the bread doesn't rise\") is problematic as the dough will just rise quicker in the warm environment whilst not cooking.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe OC 1:153) was asked about baking Matza on a stove-top and rules that the temperature must be at least hot enough \"that straw would burn\" or else we would have to worry that it is Chametz.

    "content": "# Oral Tradition in the Book of Yehoshua\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any chapters or verses in the Book of Yehoshua that allude to Torah SheB'Al Peh?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7870/why-was-torah-shebeal-peh-not-allowed-to-be-written\">Why was Torah SheBe'Al Peh not allowed to be written?</a> points out that the Oral Torah was forbidden to be written down. Additionally, the prophets would only show what somebody did rather than explicate a law. Thus, as an example, we see that Elkana (the father of Shmuel Hanavi) אֶלְקָנָה בֶּן יְרֹחָם בֶּן אֱלִיהוּא בֶּן תֹּחוּ בֶן צוּף אֶפְרָתִי  went on a regular basis to the mishkan in Shiloh. We also do not see a reference to the korbon Pesach after the time that Bnai Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael even though we know it was brought. However, since there is no story that requires it to be mentioned, it is not mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, anything that Yehoshua taught would have been oral and Sefer Yehoshua would not mention it unless it was needed as part of the story. While these are two separate issues, both statements are true independently.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Since you are interested in early references, lets start with an allusion at the very beginning of Joshua: Joshua 1:7-8:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַק חֲזַק וֶאֱמַץ מְאֹד לִשְׁמֹר לַעֲשׂוֹת כְּכָל הַתּוֹרָה אֲשֶׁר צִוְּךָ מֹשֶׁה עַבְדִּי אַל תָּסוּר מִמֶּנּוּ יָמִין וּשְׂמֹאול לְמַעַן תַּשְׂכִּיל בְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר תֵּלֵךְ:\n  לֹא יָמוּשׁ סֵפֶר הַתּוֹרָה הַזֶּה מִפִּיךָ וְהָגִיתָ בּוֹ יוֹמָם וָלַיְלָה לְמַעַן תִּשְׁמֹר לַעֲשֹוֹת כְּכָל הַכָּתוּב בּוֹ כִּי אָז תַּצְלִיחַ אֶת דְּרָכֶךָ וְאָז תַּשְׂכִּיל:</p>\n  \n  <p>Just be strong and very courageous to observe and do in accordance with all of the Torah that Moses My servant has commanded you. Do not stray therefrom right or left, in order that you succeed wherever you go: This book of the Torah shall not leave your mouth; you shall meditate therein day and night, in order that you observe to do all that is written in it, for then will you succeed in all your ways and then will you prosper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Verse 7 is referring to the oral Torah \"that Moses my servant has commanded you.\" Verse 8 continues with an injunction to also study the written Torah.  </p>\n\n<p>The phrase in verse 7 \"not straying right or left\" is also clearly a reference to the discussion of the authority of the Great Court in Deutoronomy, where the exact same phrase is used, another reference to the authority of the Oral Law.</p>\n\n\n",

And to my question of who before Geiger equated Jesus with Balaam, I still see no examples given.  It appears that Rabbi Gil student is using a version of the Talmud that has Yeshu, though Gil argues that Yeshu is not Jesus.<br />\n<a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusi.html</a><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesus.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesus.html</a>  and <a href=\"http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusnarr.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.angelfire.com/mt/talmud/jesusnarr.html</a>   though clearly the Soncino translators of Gittin 57a, believe Yeshu was Jesus  <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_57.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://halakhah.com/gittin/gittin_57.html</a> (footnote for \"sinners of Israel\" says Jesus - sinners of Israel being a censored version in Soncino's Hebrew and English, Yeshu being the actual version).  So looking at the text as Gil's link, so  Munich manuscript, not Soncino, it makes clear, Balaam is in boiling semen and Yeshu in boiling excrement with those that mock the sages. \"What is your punishment?  [Yeshu answered]: In boiling excrement.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>You're right, MS stands for manuscript, and the final M stands for Munich. It is the oldest complete manuscript of the Talmud available, which means many consider it to be the most accurate. However as Shalom pointed out, Soncino is NOT citing Jesus as being Balaam, it is citing that Jesus is in place of \"sinners of Israel.\" I think you are seeing Balaam in close proximity to a section of censored Talmud and putting Jesus in the wrong spot. The reason that Geiger and scholars after him think Balaam is a code word for Jesus is the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since the time of Geiger (JZWL, 6 (1868), 31–37) various scholars have tried to view the name Balaam, occurring in many aggadot, as a pseudonym for Jesus. They find their proof in the passage: \"A certain sectarian said to Ḥanina 'Have you heard how old Balaam was?' He replied 'It is not actually stated, but since it is written \"Bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half their days\" [Ps. 55:24] he must have been 33 or 34'. He rejoined 'You have spoken correctly; I personally have seen Balaam's Chronicle, in which it is stated, \"Balaam the lame was 33 years of age when Phinehas the robber killed him\" [Sanh. 106b].'\" On the basis that Jesus lived about 33 years and is called a sectarian, it was maintained that Balaam's Chronicle is none other than the Gospels and \"Phinehas the robber\" Pontius Pilate. However, it is impossible to imagine that a Christian would ask a Jew how old Jesus was, and call the Gospel Balaam's Chronicle or that Pontius Pilate, who is not mentioned even once in the whole of rabbinic literature, should be referred to as Phinehas the robber.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10113.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0011_0_10113.html</a></p>\n<p>Geiger's and other more recent scholarly arguments citing Balaam as Jesus doesn't really have any concrete evidence, their argument is based on drawing connections based on similarities and oddities. However, when we are dealing with the reality of nearly all surviving texts being censored, it's impossible to find out where the censorship begins and ends. Even our oldest \"uncensored\" books could have already been censored, with more recent manuscripts being even further censored!  Unfortunately we don't have a \"dead sea scrolls\" of Talmuds. So while Geiger's argument isn't definitive, those who oppose him don't have a concrete answer either because sometimes we have a clear reference to Jesus that is often edited out of most Talmuds. Such as in Sanhedrin 43, giving fuel to Geiger's argument:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MQ2Qo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MQ2Qo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‘On the Eve of Passover they hung\nJesus of Nazareth for sorcery and leading Israel astray.’ This paper\nargues that other words were added to this tradition in order to\novercome three difficulties: a trial date during a festival; the unbiblical\nmethod of execution; and the charge of ‘sorcery’.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The name Jesus the Nazerene is clearly mentioned. Sometimes when people talk about \"Christian censors\" what they really mean is that things were censored for fear of Christian violence toward Jews. So it could be possible that Jews themselves censored their own documents to prevent programs or other riots of violence. And when these things happen, its hard to know where the censorship began and where it ended.</p>\n<p>If you want to know how prevalent Jesus shows up in this particular section of Talmud by cross referencing other Talmudic manuscripts, check out this website, which allows you to search by sections and compare manuscripts, I suggest you look up the section of Gittin you're curious about: <a href=\"http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/talmud/bavly/selectbavly.asp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/talmud/bavly/selectbavly.asp</a></p>\n<p>Here is a photo of Gittin 57 in question in the Munich Manuscript. You can clearly see the name of Jesus if you look three lines above the large word אתרנגול</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rJ6tl.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rJ6tl.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>It states that Jesus was raised from the dead through incantations: אסקי' לישו בנגיד'. In the standard text this has been altered to read לפושעי ישראל, instead of Jesus.</p>\n<p>Sorry that the quality isn't the greatest. If you want to get a more readable version you can directly view the Munich manuscript <a href=\"http://daten.digitale-sammlungen.de/%7Edb/bsb00003409/images/index.html?fip=193.174.98.30&seite=432&pdfseitex=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here.</a> Unfortunately it's not broken off into daf numbers.</p>\n<p>When it comes to these arguments there will never be a definitive answer. Because it comes down to things like this: If I am an \"Orthodox Jew\" and have a belief that only x manuscript of the Talmud Bavli is the correct one, then i have no concern if there are other manuscripts out there that explicitly mention the name of Jesus.</p>\n<p>Another issue comes down to this: We have hundreds, sometimes thousands of manuscripts, and most of them vary, so how do you find out which is the correct one. You could make the argument that when most of them agree on something, then the minority of manuscripts that differ are the variant. But when the question comes to the potentiality that something was censored, how do you know which is the actual original, the one that has the rare reading, or the ones that all conform to something? What if the oldest manuscript we have (the Munich) has Jesus in several places, whereas every newer manuscript has the name Jesus missing? What do you do when most of the Ashkenazi manuscripts say x, and the Sepharadi or Yemenite ones say y?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I'm interested if anybody before Geiger claimed that Balaam was Jesus. How far back the claim goes and who made it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Undoubtedly when you have such similarities in the texts about Jesus and Balaam there will be lots of people who make this argument. But more than likely most people who made this claim in older times probably weren't Jews, as Jews try to talk as little about Jesus as possible. This can lead Rabbis to ignore sections of any manuscripts that could be too problematic.</p>\n<p>For more information regarding Jesus in the Munich Manuscript I recommend that you read this article: <a href=\"http://www.tyndale.cam.ac.uk/Tyndale/staff/Instone-Brewer/prepub/07_Instone_Brewer.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jesus of Nazareth's Trial in the Uncensored Talmud</a>.

    "content": "# חזקה מעיקרא vs ספק\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am in the middle of מחלוקת with someone as to, if I originally had a חזקה and now there's a ספק to whether that status is still true, whether I maintain that original status or my status changes to something else.</p>\n\n<p>Example: In (נדה דף ב ע״א) it discusses a case where a woman finds blood today (present) but the last time she checked herself was a week ago (past).\nDo we say retroactively she is considered טמאה from her last examination or do we say she keeps her previous חזקה and from this point on she's טמאה? \nIn short: Is she impure from her last examination (which makes everything she touched since then impure) or is it from now on she's impure?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>שמאי says she's impure starting now but she's considered pure since her last examination till now since we aren't positive her status changed till this moment.</li>\n<li>הלל would say she's impure from back then since we have to assume she was impure the second after she examined herself last time (a week ago).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>But then the Gemara says, הלל only holds this way because it's normal for a woman to go through cycles and so we have to assume at some point naturally she was going to become impure and therefore we must assume it naturally happened right after her last examination, otherwise – if we can't assume that the status would change naturally at some point – he would hold like שמאי.</p>\n\n<p>This was one example. But I'm looking for more examples that would back up or disprove this notion that you maintain your previous status until we are positive your status has changed. And once we are positive, only from that point on do you have this new status, not retroactively.</p>\n\n<p>Are there other examples of חזקה העשויה להשתנות where even though there's a ספק we hold that he maintains his previous status until we know for sure he fits into a new category?</p>\n\n<p>Does it mention somewhere that this idea is a blanket rule, that we always maintain his original status unless proof that he's for sure the other way around/ something else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"Does it mention somewhere that this idea is a blanket rule, that we always maintain his original status unless proof that he's for sure the other way around/ something else?\" Can't even begin to comment on all the cases.

A safek is the opposite force: It tells the beis din that they <em>cannot</em> pick a side, that both sides must be included in the decision with whatever consequences that has.<br />\nAs to which one wins, see all the references, see the שב שמעתתא. It's a really big job to work out all the cases.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'll try to help you a little.<br>\nFirst you know surely that Hazokot is one of the spreaded and entangled subjects in the Talmud and that  one of the difficulties is to clarify the differences and similarities between the diverse cases.<br>\nThe gait of the reasoning in the text that you quoted is also far from being trivial.<br>\nI suppose that you know that at this stage, the Gemoro did still not reach its conclusion.<br>\nYou may make a difference  between a natural (or inner following one expression of the Gemoro) hypothetical change and a change due to an external event. We can suppose that death is or an inner event or an external event. <br>\nI remember חזקת חי ומת לפניך\nTaharoth (5, 7)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נָגַע בְּאֶחָד בַּלַּיְלָה, וְאֵין יָדוּעַ אִם חַי אִם מֵת, וּבַשַּׁחַר עָמַד וּמְצָאוֹ מֵת, רַבִּי מֵאִיר מְטַהֵר. וַחֲכָמִים מְטַמְּאִים, שֶׁכָּל הַטֻּמְאוֹת כִּשְׁעַת מְצִיאָתָן: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He touched someone at night and doesn't know if this person was alive or dead. At morning he came up and see him dead.  Rabbi Meir said that he remained  clean and Chachamim said that he became  unclean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last tosfot in Niddah 2A&B says that such Hazokoth meykara (from the beginning)  are not strong enough  and    that we did  learn this stringency  from  <strong>Sotah,  the paradigm of  Sofek Tuma in the private  domain</strong>.</p>\n<p>In private domain (defined for our issue as  a place in which there are less than 3 persons) the Chezkat Tahara does not cancel  the doubt, and even not create a doubt of heyter.\n<br>\n<br><br>\nIt seem's that your intuition is that these Chazokot are impaired by a continual process which  began  from the starting  state. It's like an hourglass that is  \"Behezkat\" full. (the words of the Gemoro \"את הגס הגס\" describes a continuous process). The text below furnish two cases.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Acidification of wine,</li>\n<li>the recess of the mikveh (We do not speak about evaporation which is a continuous process,   but about  loss of water after each immersion which  depends from events.

But after this step, from the \"natural changing\" point of view they may be equivalent.\nI'm afraid my answer is riddled with errors. I apologize and I will be happy to correct.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If a man throws a marriage writee to a woman, and there is a dispute among the witnesses: one says it landed closer to her -- and thus effects a marriage, and the other is sure it landed closer to him -- and they are not married. Leckhat-chilah (ab initio) she may not marry someone else; but if she did marry, bedi'eved (post facto) we do not compel a divorce. (Tur EhE 47, Shulkhan Arukh ad loc, s' 3.)</p>\n\n<p>She starts out this story with the chazaqah of being single (penuyah). The fact that an event happened to cast doubt on the continuation of this chazaqah is enough to partially break the chazaqah. According to Tosafos (Kesuvos 23a \"tarvaihu\" and the Tosafos haRosh and Ritva ad loc) this is miderabbanan and thus only lechumerah (a rabbinic rule to rule stringently in case the chazaqah being broken and thus also to assume it was not broken in cases where that would be the stringency).</p>\n\n<p>So, someone who was tamei who went to the miqvah and we do not know if the miqvah had 40 se'ah of water in it at the time or not is presumed to still be tamei. Even though his chezqas tum'ah now has a rei'usa (a flaw, grounds for doubt), here breaking the chazaqah would be a leniency.</p>\n\n<p>Some (Maharit CM 20) say this is only by qiddushin, since both of the parties involved tried to wed and wanted to  wed. But someothing that happens on its own, bemiqreh (happenstance) does not break a chazaqah.</p>\n\n<p>Also some (also in the Maharit) say this rule is only when the chazaqah is the presumption of the continuation of a halachic state. As in our case, we are presuming she is still single. Not in the presumption that the physical world hasn't changed while we were looking.</p>\n\n<p>(Mostly from the Encyc. Talmudit.)</p>\n\n\n",

The inscription was a symbolic humiliation and degradation of Prague Jews, forcing them to pay for a set of golden letters referring to God and hung around the neck of the statue of Christ (information from Steven Plaut, The \"Vav\" from the Charles Bridge). A bronze tablet with explanatory text in Czech, English and Hebrew was mounted under the statue by the City of Prague in 2000.

That obligation blocks me from taking ownership.</p>\n\n<p>It appears that in the situation at hand, the action would be no different than if I went onto someone's property and destroyed something of theirs -- I am obligated to pay it back, and as the Talmud says, \"even if it means traveling <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_%28region%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">halfway across Iran</a>.\"</p>\n\n<p>If one has exhausted all efforts at identifying the victim, the Talmud advises paying the sum to a public good from which the victim is likely to benefit.

Territory behind the lines of one army is under that army's control and little or no resistance need be expected there. ... In fact, therefore, fighting takes place only at one location, though potentially the line could be drawn anywhere in the territories of the two contending countries.</p>\n<p>The situation is very similar with regard to free choice. Everyone has free choice -- at the point where truth meets falsehood. In other words, free choice takes place at that point where the truth as the person sees it confronts the illusion produced in him by the power of falsehood.</p>\n<p>But the majority of a person's actions are undertaken without any clash between truth and falsehood taking place. Many of a person's actions may happen to coincide with what is objectively right because he has been brought up that way and it does not occur to him to do otherwise, and many bad and false decisions may be taken simply because the person does not realize that they are bad. In such cases, no valid choice has been made. Free will is exercised and a valid choice is made only on the borderline between the forces of good and the forces of evil within that person.</p>\n<p>It must be realized that this \"point of free choice\" does not remain static in any given individual. With each good choice successfully carried out, the person rises higher in spiritual level; that is, things that were previously in the line of battle are now in the area controlled by the positive inclination, and actions done in that area can be undertaken without struggle and without choice. In this sense we can understand the saying that \"one mitzvah leads to another.\" (Avot 4:2)</p>\n<p>And so in the other direction....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I love this model because it's not absolutist, and actually conforms to personal experience. Since it never crossed my conscious mind to just pocket that nice watch I saw in Target today, it's really hard to call this a free-will decision. It's only when the two sides are in enough conflict for me to have to consciously contemplate my options that my will could actually be free.</p>\n<p>Rav Dessler doesn't blame someone for those preconscious decisions, he blames them for whatever they did to move the \"battlefront\" to the point that it could be resolved preconsciously.</p>\n<p>(This would also include decisions not made or made wrongly due to lack of information, or due to physical limitations. A person cannot be held accountable for not flapping his wings and flying.)</p>\n<p>As for whether Omniscience limits free will... I would argue that G-d does not know today what I will decide tomorrow. Yes, G-d knows everything, the flaw in that proposition is the word \"today\" -- G-d is \"above time\", atemporal. Concepts like \"today\" and \"tomorrow\" are things He knows about from the \"outside\". There is no \"today\" to His knowing. I think this is the Tosafos Yom Tov's point, when he says that G-d's knowledge of the future doesn't impact free will any more than His knowledge of the past.</p>\n<p>Or perhaps we just go with the Or Sameiach's non-answer (Hilkhos Teshuvah, essay titled \"HaKol Tzafui\"). He writes that the answers are like trying to keep two people warm in a jacket that barely fits one. It's simply not large enough. When you pull it over to cover one, you uncover the other. It's not a metaphor for falsity, but incompleteness. An answer that is correct, but incomplete because our minds aren't big enough get it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Haamek Davar's implication that God used childbearing terminology",
    "content": "# Haamek Davar's implication that God used childbearing terminology\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>Haamek Davar</em> explains Genesis 17:16–19 as follows: In verse 16, God tells Abraham that He \"will give [Abraham] a son from\" Sarah. Because Sarah is no longer physically capable of childbearing, Abraham understands this blessing as meaning that there will be a boy whom Sarah adopts and then presents to Abraham as his. In verse 17, Abraham expresses this understanding, and in verse 18 he prays that the adopted child be Ishmael. In verse 19, God clarifies that \"your wife Sarah will give birth to a son for you\" and not just rear one. [Note that God never uses the word \"born\" or \"birth\" or the like until verse 19.]</p>\n\n<p>However, the wording of the <em>Haamek Davar</em> is puzzling to me. In <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.17.17\" rel=\"nofollow\">his commentary on verse 17</a>, he writes that the adopted child</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>will thereby be called \"born to her\", like \"a son was born to Naomi\" [Ruth 4:17]….</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why does <em>Haamek Davar</em> feel a need to explain how the son would be considered born to Sarah, as if this clarifies God's earlier statement that that would take place? God had never said a son would be born to Sarah, that we need to explain such wording as meaning adoption. I mean, the <em>Haamek Davar</em>'s wording I just quoted sounds like an allegorical reading of a verse, except that there's no verse he could be explaining this way.</p>\n\n<p>And then in verse 19 he does it again: When God clarifies that Sarah will give birth, <em>Haamek Davar</em> explains that it's</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>not like you're thinking — rather, she'll give birth, in its usual meaning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"In its usual meaning\" sounds, again, like he's referring to some statement of God's, \"give birth\", that Abraham had misinterpreted as adoption and that God was now clarifying really does mean giving birth. But there's no such statement! What gives?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems, you are asking about the point that Abraham himself is trying to clarify according to Netziv at this point. This is the comment 108 in the r. Mordechai Kuperman edition of Emek Davar here:</p>\n<p>כשעל פניו לא מובן ההמשך והקשר הזה בין שמחתו על הבשורה (\"ויצחק\" = \"וחדי\") לבין בקשתו על ישמעאל</p>\n<p>In other words, there had been a doubt in Abraham's heart as to the meaning of Hashem words that a child would be given to Abraham from Sarah, whether it would be a naturally born one or an adopted child. Therefore, Abraham requests conditionally, if (לו) the child would be adopted, may he be Ishmael. This conditional is rejected by Hashem \"not like your thought (מדמה)\", i.e. Sarah will get pregnant from you and give birth to a son.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Netziv says that the verse that Abraham interpreted as referring to an adopted child is וְגַם נָתַתִּי מִמֶּנָּה לְךָ בֵּן (Genesis 17:16). The verb ילד doesn't appear in this verse. Abraham's interpretation is based on the words מִמֶּנָּה (from her) and לְךָ (to you).</p>\n<p>In order to prove that it's possible to understand the word לְךָ of an adopted child, he cites the verse יֻלַּד בֵּן לְנָעֳמִי – not for the verb ילד, but for the preposition ל-‏, which is normally used of the biological father of the child. This proves that ל-‏ can be used in an adoptive sense, hence Abraham's interpretation that he (לְךָ) would adopt a son through an adoption by Sarah (מִמֶּנָּה).</p>\n<p>So far the verb ילד has only been understood literally. So when it appears in our context (שָׂרָה אִשְׁתְּךָ יֹלֶדֶת לְךָ בֵּן) it can only be understood in its literal sense and negates the interpretation that לְךָ could have been referring to an adoption.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>According to <em>Ha'amek Davar</em>'s reading, Abraham understands the blessing to predict that Sarah may adopt a boy who will be considered her own.</p>\n\n<p>Abraham asks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַלְּבֶן מֵאָה שָׁנָה <strong>יִוָּלֵד</strong> וְאִם שָׂרָה הֲבַת תִּשְׁעִים שָׁנָה <strong>תֵּלֵד</strong>?‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Notice that here Abraham asks if Sarah will <strong>give birth</strong> (תלד), even though Hashem didn't use the word \"birth\" (as you mentioned).</p>\n\n<p>But if Abraham is asking about Sarah <strong>giving birth</strong>, how does <em>Ha'amek Davar</em> explain that Abraham was thinking of <strong>adoption</strong>? So he explains that even an adopted child may be considerd \"born\" to someone other than his parents, just like it says \"יֻלַּד-בֵּן לְנָעֳמִי\" (\"a son was born to Naomi\" - even though he was Ruth's).</p>\n\n\n",

We limit our raisonement to the case of bread that has not been previously designed for for further processing (as French Toast is).<br>\nThis is what Rashi learns from this second text:<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב ששת האי חביצא אף על גב דלית ביה פרורין כזית מברך עליו המוציא לחם מן הארץ אמר רבא והוא דאיכא עליה תוריתא דנהמא\n  (Rav Shesheth says that \"this Chavitsa\" despite that the crumbs are small than an olive, one blesses \"Hamotsi\".

Following Tosfoth If we let soak the bread in water for a long time until the water takes a whitish color, it is a sign that the bread is degraded. --> mezonoth --> Meeyn shalosh.\nRambam, Hilchoth Berachoth (3, 8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הפת שפתת אותה פיתים, <strong>ובישלה בקדירה או לשה במרק</strong>--<strong><em>אם יש בפתיתין כזית</em></strong>, או שניכר שהן פת ולא נשתנת צורתה--מברך עליה בתחילה, <strong>המוציא</strong>; ואם אין בהן כזית, או שעברה צורת הפת בבישול--מברך עליו בתחילה, בורא מיני מזונות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Kessef Mishne he conclude that as the same level of intermediate degradation, slices of less than Kezayith differ from the greater. The small are considered as no more bread and the great remain bread. (size is one of the common 'hallmarks' of bread). He differ at first glance from tosfoth because tosfoth descript only one sign of degradation that are as one of his consequence that big slices disintegrate.\n<br><strong><em>SA and Mishna Brura OC 168</em></strong>, 10 follows this last advice (an interpretation in the Rambam)<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>French Toast are big slices greater than kezayith.

The fact of even fry in plenty of oil is a known practice in the 'menahoth' is not obviously against the being bread (תוספות דף ל\"ח ד\"ה לחם העשוי לכותח). More, in Rama (188, 14 Rama), we consider that the small amount of oil is not used as an oil immersion.<br>\n<strong>So toast fashioned into small slices short of a Kazayt ar perhaps hamotzi (להלכה ולא למעשה)</strong></p>\n\n<p>If somewhat is erroneous I will appreciate corrections.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It remains hamotzi so long as the bread was originally hamotzi and remains the size of a kzayis when made into french toast.

R Abba,\n  however, understood this prophecy as referring not to the Jewish\n  people, but to the Temple vessels, which are mentioned in the previous\n  verses. The verse predicts that the vessels will remain in Babylonia\n  throughout all the various exiles of the Jews. They will not be\n  returned until the final ingathering of the exiles (<em>Gra, Imrei\n  Noam</em>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The same verse is brought in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.110b.80?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">Ketubot 110b</a>-111a where \"R Zeira maintains that verse was written in regard to the sacred ustensils\".</p>\n\n<p>R Yehuda there responds with the verse from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.2.7?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">Shir Hashirim</a> \"I have bound you in oath, O daughters of Jerusalem\" and derives that Hashem bound Am Israel and the nations of the world with three oaths. The first oath is, \"<em>shelo yaalu bachoma</em>,\" that the Jews should not forcibly, \"break through the wall,\" and enter Eretz Israel. The second is that the Jews should not rebel against the nations. The third is that the nations of the world should not oppress Israel too much over the course of the exile. </p>\n\n<p>It is from there that the <strong>Satmar Rebbe</strong> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Teitelbaum\">R Yoel Teitelbaum</a>) writes in <em>Va-Yoel Moshe</em> that these oaths apply to the establishment of <em>Medinat Israel</em>, the State of Israel and that Hashem brought about the Holocaust because the Zionist movement caused the Jews to violate the \"Three Oaths.\" Since the Jewish people forcefully went to resettle Eretz Israel, Hashem brought upon them massive destruction, as the Gemara warns in its conclusion.</p>\n\n<p>Many have written on reasons this doesn’t apply. Here is a synthesis of their rationale (see at the end for sources). Note these are not modern Orthodox writers, rather a gamut of opinions across the spectrum of traditional Judaism.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>the gemara regarding the \"Three Oaths\" is <strong>aggada</strong>, and we do not decide halacha based on aggada</li>\n<li>not only are the three Oaths not cited by the <strong>halachic authorities</strong> (e.g., Rif, Rambam, Rosh, Tur, Shulchan Aruch, Mishna Brura), but rather they write that it’s a mitzvah to make aliya and to conquer the Land of Israel in all generations. The <strong>Rambam</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-11.htm\">Hilchot Melachim 11:2</a>) who brings the Bar Kochba rebellion supported by R' Akiva and his many students as the prototype for the way of the rise of mashiach, clearly feels that the oaths are not halachic, for they rebelled against the Romans and tried taking the Land by force</li>\n<li><strong>the gemara in Sanhedrin 98a</strong> says that when Eretz Yisrael gives forth fruit abundantly, it is a sure sign that the redemption is coming. Eretz Yisrael, in the time of the Zionist movement, began blooming and giving forth fruits unlike any previous time since the destruction of the land. This sign of redemption showed that the oath was no longer in effect</li>\n<li><strong>the gemara in Yoma 9b</strong> contradicts the three oaths and says that we actually must (!) “rise up as a wall”, and that we were even punished for not doing so in the time of Ezra, to build the 2nd Temple</li>\n<li><p><strong>Shir HaShirim Rabba 8, 9 (3)</strong>, R. Zeira, the author of the three oaths in Ketubot, changes his mind explicitly, and adopts the contradicting opinion mentioned in Yoma!</p></li>\n<li><p>The <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avrohom_Bornsztain\">Avnei Nezer</a></strong> writes that this oath does not apply when the nations give Yisrael permission to return. Following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration\">Balfour Declaration</a> and the San Remo Conference, in which the nations of the world determined that the Jewish people have a right to settle the land of Israel, the oaths do not apply. The Midrash hints to this idea, that if Bnei Yisrael have permission to enter the land they do not violate the oaths</p></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meir_Simcha_of_Dvinsk\">R Meir Simcha of Dvinsk</a></strong> (the Meshech Chochma and author of the Or Same’ach), in a letter to the Keren Hayesod, dismisses the oaths as aggada, and stresses, especially after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balfour_Declaration\">Balfour Declaration</a> in 1917, ratified internationally in San Remo, where the nations of the world officially recognized the right of the Jews to establish a national homeland in Palestine, “it removes all ‘fear’ of those oaths”. Rashi explained not to take the land by force, but once the nations gave us permission, it’s no problem</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yissachar_Shlomo_Teichtal\">R Yissachar Shlomo Teichtal</a></strong> (in \"Em Habanim Smeicha”), writes that, although the Jews were sworn not to enter Eretz Yisrael forcefully, the nations of the world were also sworn not to persecute the Jews too much. Over the course of the exile, the Jews were severely persecuted by the gentiles. Because the gentiles violated their oath, the Jews were no longer bound by their oath.</li>\n<li>similarly <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Kluger\">R. Shlomo Kluger</a></strong> explains that if the gentiles don’t observe their oath, we are exempt from ours. Nobody who learned about the Holocaust can take the gentile’s oath seriously, as if they didn’t “oppress us too much”, so we clearly are no longer obligated by our oath, and it is no longer “before its time”</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayyim_ben_Joseph_Vital\">R Chayim Vital</a></strong>, the great disciple of Rabbi Yitzchak Luria, writes that the Oaths expired after the termination of the first millennium of the two thousand years of Messiah</li>\n<li><strong>the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\">Vilna Gaon</a></strong> makes specific mention of going out to rebuild the Temple. This could be construed as implying that the prohibition of re-settling the Land by force is limited to the building of the Temple</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Hirsch_Kalischer\">R Zvi Hirsch Kalischer</a></strong> writes that the Oaths only prohibit forcing the actual End, a destiny whose achievement must remain solely in the hands of God. Concerning the beginning, the path of settling the Land that leads “little by little” towards the End, there is no prohibition (and in his opinion, doing so is a religious obligation)</li>\n<li><strong>R Aviezer of Tiktin</strong> (one of the disciples of the Vilna Gaon who immigrated to the Holy Land in the beginning of of the nineteenth century) writes that the prohibitions do not apply to “extraordinary times” in which the coming of Mashiach may be hastened by human action</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yisroel_ben_Shmuel_of_Shklov\">R Yisrael of Shklov</a></strong> (a leading disciple of the Vilna Gaon and one of the leaders of the original settlers) contended that because the Gentiles had not kept their part of the Oaths [namely: not to persecute the Jewish People “overly”], the Jews were absolved of theirs</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Alkalai\">R Yehudah Alkalai</a></strong> explained that the injunction prohibits only collective ascending in a sudden, revolutionary thrust; according to him, the Oath is actually supportive of the move towards settling the Land of Israel: Israel is adjured not to “ascend the wall,” but is obligated to ascend!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are interested in halachic sources showing that alya is a mitzva and halachic requirement, there is a very nice and highly readable book by Michael Kaufman (<a href=\"http://amzn.com/1568717504\">Land of my past, land of my future</a>) where he describes his journey through halachic sources and modern <em>poskim</em> to understand the halachic nature of alyah (spoiler: he moved to Israel after writing the book).

We would be obligated to give the land back because of Pikuach Nefesh.</p>\n\n<p>He quotes the Megilas Esther that says the reason the Rambam omitted the Mitzvah to live in EY nowadays is because the Oaths negate the Mitzvah.  (note Rambam says at the end of Iggeres Teiman: “And these are things the prophets have already foretold, and they have told us about what I have told you, that when the time of the true moshiach draws near, there will be many who lift themselves high and place doubts in people's minds, but their claims will not be born out, and they will perish and many will perish with them. And when Shlomo, peace be upon him, made known with his holy inspiration, that this nation when it is sunk into exile will try to arouse itself not at its proper time, and they will die because of this and travails will come upon them – he warned against this, and made an oath against this in an allegorical way, and said (Shir Hashirim 2:7), ‘I adjure you, daughters of Jerusalem…’ And you, our brethren, our beloved – keep his oath and do not arouse the love before it is desired!”)</p>\n\n<p>Then he quotes the Rashbash who says that the Ramban held that the Oaths only prohibit a massive national ascent to EY, but individuals who want to live in EY are not affected by the Oaths. The Rashbash points out that the Bnei Efraim were annihilated in the desert because they violated the Oaths, and warns us to take heed from what happened to them (\"tzai ur'ah mah irah lbnei efraim.\")</p>\n\n<p>Then he quotes the Rivash who also brings the Oaths l'halachah.</p>\n\n<p>Then he quotes other Achronim who apply the Oaths l'halachah, as well as those who hold l'halachah that the Oaths even negate the Mitzvah of living in EY for individuals - as per the Megilas Esther. They include Rav Yosef Dov Halevi Soloveitchik ZTL (the \"Bais Halevi\").</p>\n\n<p>His conclusion l'halachah is that because of the Oaths, even the Ramban agrees that there is no Mitzvah at all nowadays to endanger Jewish lives to conquer Eretz Yisroel, and therefore, when you can obtain peace by giving up land, you are obligated to give up land because of Pikuach Nefesh.</p>\n\n<p>(Interestingly, later on he refutes one of the most common Zionist blunders against the Oaths - that they expire after 1,000 years.</p>\n\n<p>This is based on a misunderstanding of a statement in the Zohar, and other Kabbalistic works. Chacham Ovadiah says that first of all, it’s crystal clear in the Gemora, the Targum, the Rambam, and Rishonim and Achronim who all quote the Oaths l'halachah after the alleged expiration date, that the Oaths are in fact in effect until Moshiach comes. As for the Zohar, Arizal and Kabbalistic works, he refers the readers to the Satmar Rebbe's Vayoel Moshe, p. 85 and onward, where he says the issue has already been dealt with at length.</p>\n\n<p>The Satmar Rebbe in fact shows that a proper understanding of the Zohar and the Kabbalah shows that they agree 100% with the Halachah, and that the idea that they said the Oaths expire is a total mistake.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Relative status of biblical and rabbinic transgressions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the opening chapter of Sefer Tanya, the rebbe notes that failure to perform a positive biblical commandment is worse than performing a rabbinic transgression.</p>\n\n<p>In his words: “Even one who transgresses a minor prohibition of the sages is called an evil-doer... and all the moreso one who fails to perform a positive [biblical] obligation, such as one who was able to engage in Torah study but who didn’t do so... <strong>And it is obvious that such a one is considered an evil-doer moreso than he who transgresses a rabbinic prohibition</strong>” (ואפילו העובר על איסור קל של דברי סופרים מקרי רשע... וכ”ש וק”ו במבטל איזו מ”ע שאפש’ לו לקיימה כמו כל שאפשר לו לעסוק בתורה ואינו עוסק... ופשיטא דמקרי רשע טפי מעובר איסור דרבנן).</p>\n\n<p>Can somebody please provide me with a source for this idea that violating a rabbinic prohibition is of less severity than failure to observe a biblical obligation? Is it universally held, or are there scholars who hold that violating a rabbinic prohibition (while of less severity than violating a biblical prohibition) is actually worse than non-compliance with a biblical obligation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a dispute as to whether a rabbinic prohibition or mitzvah has the same metaphysical import as a Torah one, or whether it's pragmatic.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Meir Simchah haKohein miDvinsk (Meshekh Chokhmah, Devarim 17:11) holds that Torahitic prohibition describes something that is inherently wrong. The universe is made such that combining meat and milk is a problem (metu’af, meshuqatz). A rabbinic prohibition lacks that reality. Even though the rabbis prohibit the mixture, chicken and milk isn’t inherently damaging. Rather they pragmatically realized that allowing it had led to error through habit or accident. Therefore, one needn’t the same care when dealing with rabbinic extension as when dealing with the damaging or refining thing itself.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is shemittah today, which is rabbinic. Torahitic shemittah comes with a blessing that Hashem will insure sufficient crops in the 6th year for the 6th, 7th (when there is no farming) and 8th years (waiting for the replacement crops to arrive). However, Torahitic yovel and shemittah only apply when most Jews live in Israel, and according to the Tosafists and others, the majority of tribes live on their tribal lands. Meanning that today, and in fact ever since 10 of the tribes were lost in the First Temple period, shemittah is rabbinic. Is there still a berakhah attached?</p>\n\n<p>The Seifer Me’iras Einayim (SM”A, Ch”M 67, #2) someone who keeps rabbinic shemittah today gets no such guarantees. This is in theological agreement with the Meshekh Chokhmah.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazon Ish (Deshevi’is 18, #4), however, writes that the blessing did apply during the 2nd Temple and after its destruction, for the heavenly court fulfills based on what’s decreed down below.</p>\n\n<p>There is a similar statement by Lubavitch's Alter Rebbe. In a rare case of where the Shulchan Arukh haRav discusses the purpose of a law rather than just codifying practice, he discusses the significance of the second day of Yom Tov that is observed by those outside of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>He explains that there is no time in the heavenly realms. The supernal “Pesach” is not associated with any particular time. Hashem made a connection between that Pesach and the 15th of Nissan, giving us a worldly manifestation within time. The SAhR continues that the 16th of Nissan is connected to the very same supernal Pesach. The seder on the 2nd night is a manifestation of the same metaphysical reality. What differs is  who draws down the connection, not what it is we are connected to. Notice that the Alter Rebbe, like the Chazon Ish, believes that rabbinic law creates metaphysical realities, and therefore obeying or violating it can improve or damage the performer and the world.</p>\n\n<p>The pragmaticists would therefore make violation of a Torahitic mitzvah a much worse thing hashkafically, whereas according to the Shulchan Arukh haRav, violating the Torahitic day of rest of Pesach or the Rabbinic one do the same metaphysical damage.</p>\n\n<p>A third position is expressed by Rav Elchanan Wasserman (Qunterus Divrei Soferim), who blurs the distinction altogether. He takes it for granted there is \\a reality behind rabbinic statements. It is all revealed from the Creator, all the Ratzon Hashem yisbarakh (the Will of the Creator, blessed be He).  The difference between a derabbanan and a de’oraisa is the explicitness. In other words, the rabbinic law existed because they detected a pre-existing metaphysical issue, one more minor than the Torah law, but still worth avoiding; or a metaphysical opportunity worth mandating we take advantage of. Therefore rabbinic law is less sacred, and violation involves lesser realities. A difference of quantity, not quality.</p>\n\n<p>So in short:</p>\n\n<p>1- R Meir Simchah haKohein and the Me'iras Einayim saying there is a qualitative difference in which Torahitic law does things to existence, whereas rabbinic laws are \"merely\" pragmatic advice to maximize meaningful observance of Torah law.</p>\n\n<p>2- R Elchanan Wasserman who says both have metaphysical impact, but there is a real quantitative difference in the size of the impact.</p>\n\n<p>3- The Alter Rebbe and the Chazon Ish say that there is nothing inherently spiritually different to a rabbinic law's fulfillment or violation in comparison to a Torah law.</p>\n\n<p>Related is the question of how doubt is treated. ספק דאוריית להחמיר -- when we have a doubt about whether or not something fits Torah law, we play safe. But ספק דרבנן לקולא -- we are lenient when the doubt is in a rabbinic law.</p>\n\n<p>If rabbinic law is \"only\" pragmatic, that is unsurprising. There is a limit to how much effort we invest in this secondary layer around the actual spiritual work.</p>\n\n<p>But according to the other opinions?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps they follow the Ramban, who says that the reason we are stringent in doubts about Torah law is itself a rabbinic law. (The Rambam says something similar to explain ספק ספקא, but this answer is getting long enough.) They did not pass a similar rule about doubts in rabbinic law.  So the whole process of doubt resolution involves legal rules, not risk assessment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps Abba ben Joseph bar Ḥama (c. 280 – 352 CE), aka Rava (in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.21b.20?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eiruvin 21b</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מאי דכתיב (קהלת יב, יב) ויותר מהמה בני הזהר עשות ספרים הרבה וגו' בני הזהר בדברי סופרים יותר מדברי תורה שדברי תורה יש בהן עשה ולא תעשה ודברי סופרים כל העובר על דברי סופרים חייב מיתה שמא תאמר אם יש בהן ממש מפני מה לא \n  נכתבו אמר קרא עשות ספרים הרבה אין קץ</p>\n  \n  <p>What does it mean (Ecclesiastes 12:12) 'But more than all these, my son, take warning for thyself: the making of many books would have no end; and much preaching is a weariness of the flesh.'

Yet gentiles genuinely searching\nfor wisdom (or to observe other commandments) toward personal growth\nmay study without impunity.

Alternatively, this means that the moon would have the blemish caused by its jealousy repaired because the sin of jealousy will have been removed from the world and we would be able to have the \"two great light\" without any flaw (caused by a flaw in middos).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וִיהִי רָצוֹן מִלְּפָנֶיךָ ה׳ אֱלֹהַי וֵאלֹהֵי אֲבוֹתַי לְמַלֹּאת\n  פְּגִימַת הַלְּבָנָה, וְלֹא יִהְיֶה בָּהּ שׁוּם מִעוּט, וִיהִי אוֹר\n  הַלְּבָנָה כְּאוֹר הַחַמָּה וּכְאוֹר שִׁבְעַת יְמֵי בְרֵאשִׁית, כְּמוֹ\n  שֶׁהָיְתָה קוֹדֶם מִעוּטָהּ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר וַיַּעַשֹ אֱלֹהִים אֶת שְׁנֵי\n  הַמְּאֹרֹת הַגְּדֹלִים</p>\n  \n  <p>May it be Your will Hashem, my G‽D and my ancestors’ G‽D, to fulfill\n  the blemish of the “white one” levanah (the moon), and may there be no\n  diminishing at all in her; and may the light of the white one be like\n  the light of the “hot one” ḥamah (the sun), and like the light of the\n  seven days of beginning creation, like it was before she was\n  diminished, as it says “And G‽D formed the two great lights.”7</p>\n  \n  <ol start=\"7\">\n  <li>based on Talmud Ḥulin 60b; for a Kabbalistic interpretation see this article at astillsmallvoice.org</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Assuming a non-literal understanding of this Midrash, I believe this end section of <em>Kiddush Levana</em> is making a reference to a slightly longer version of that Midrash which ends by stating that in the times of <em>Mashiach</em>, the moon will be restored to its full luminance.\nThat being the case, I think this end section of <em>Kiddush Levana</em> can simply be read as a way of asking for G-d to hasten the coming of Mashiach.</p>\n\n<p>However, in more direct response to your two ending point:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The moon's complaints were unfounded, therefore we are asking that G-d restore his creation to how he originally created it, resting on the notion that G-d's original creation was better than the weaker version of the moon we currently possess.</li>\n<li>Whether the moon is more or less bright, appearing during the day or night, the function of the moon being used for Rosh Chodesh relates to the time it takes to orbit Earth (28.5 days), which would not be related to its brightness, therefore presumably would be unchanged.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

I have a few reasons for this.</p>\n<p>Firstly, from a logical perspective. The quality of the oil (say, extra-virgin olive oil) is a qualitative difference that can be sensed in the clarity of the light produced. Similarly, from a culinary perspective, it is something that might be tasted, so the Mishnah had to consider it (via kal vachomer) and then reject it (via a diyuk). For pouring oil on someone's head or anointing vessels, should this really matter?</p>\n<p>Second, an argument from silence. Usually I would say that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. But here, the Mishnah and Gemara explicitly consider other oil situations. And if this were a requirement, we would expect a Biblical verse, Mishnah, Tosefta, Midrash Halacha, or Rishon to say so.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, from a hermeneutical perspective. The Mishnah presents a kal vachomer. If for mere light it is required, then certainly for something that goes on the altar! And the rejection is that the pasuk explicitly says לַמָּא֑וֹר, that only for light. Absent an explicit Biblical verse (see point 2), the only reason we would think it would be required was by analogy or kal vachomer. But we already have the diyuk of לַמָּא֑וֹר to reject such a kal vachomer. (And perhaps the idea behind this diyuk is what I wrote in point 1).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>It says pure beaten in Shemot 27:20</p>\n\n<p>'And thou--thou dost command the sons of Israel, and they bring unto thee pure beaten olive oil for the light, to cause the lamp to go up continually;</p>\n\n<p>Even though it talks about Menorah, it is the same oil that was donated(Shemot 25:6), so I think this would be the answer.</p>\n\n\n",

The simplest way to describe the sound to an English speaker, in my opinion, is by squeezing the throat and using your voice at the same time. A good way to practice this is by bunching up your tongue as far back as you can until you feel your throat’s opening get narrower. Try to replicate that feeling in your throat, but keep the front of your tongue in its neutral position (the tip by your teeth).

The best way to learn to pronounce this letter is to properly learn to pronounce Teth (ט) first. This is a pharyngealized voiceless alveolar stop. To make this sound, make your tongue into a cup. It should be pressing on your furthest back top molars. You should also feel an uncomfortable sensation in your throat, which might cause you to gag a little until you get used to it. Keeping your tongue in this shape, say 'Ta'. It'll come out sounding odd, and half way between a T and D. Once you can do that easily, you're ready to try an Ayin. The glottal stop is the sound you probably don't hear that occurs at the beginning of all the words that start with a vowel sound. It's easiest to hear it as the '-' in 'uh-oh'. Make your tongue into the bowl shape and say 'oh'. It will sound weird again in the same way as the Teth. That's an Ayin. Practice 'uh'-'Oh' until you sound like a Yemenite.</p>\n\n\n",

And hence, if we strip the words “pure” and “impure” of their physical connotations, and perceive a more spiritual meaning, could they signify the presence or absence of holiness?) </p>\n\n<p>Please help me out to get to the clear and pure essence of these words :) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is quite a simple way to define purity and impurity as they are denoted in the Torah. Purity is everything that is connected to Life, hope, possibility and growth. Impurity, or Tameh - stems from the word 'Satum' which means closed off, and connotes anything that is disconnected from its life source, with no possibility for connection, growth or movement. So everything that is connected with death, is in the realm of impurity. These terms have nothing to do with physical cleanliness or dirt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Tameh implies something that is close to hephsed (debilitation).</p>\n\n<p>Tahor implies something that is wholesome within itself.</p>\n\n<p>So that a dead person, which is the greatest hephsed, has the most tumah, for example.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I heard a Rabbi that said that it was the status of the person. Ritually impure or ritually pure.  It did not mean dirty or clean.  He said that a tame person still has to observe Shabbat, eat kosher, etc. although it is ritually impure. Hope this helps, it help me understand better.</p>\n\n\n",

Someone wanting to learn more will find the writings of R Aryeh Kaplan to be a good starting point, e.g., <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0940118564\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0877288550\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Kabbalah has an elaborate metaphysics that is based quite strongly in the neoplatonic, tradition. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Platonism\" rel=\"nofollow\">Middle Platonism</a> posited <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoplatonism#Teachings\" rel=\"nofollow\">four worlds of reality</a> which are reflected in kabbalah's four worlds. The One, Mind, World Soul, Material World, which correspond to Atzilut, Beriah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah respectively. Platonism is discussed fully, openly, and academically. Kabbalah is less so, so it's easier to explain the Platonism, and then return to Kabbalah.</p>\n\n<p>The One is a transcendent unity that is the source, and cause, of the world's oneness and is the primal cause that causes all other things. Most would call this G-d. In Platonism, absolutely nothing can be said about this because it is \"above\" the intelligible world. The intelligible world starts with the Mind, which creates all the forms, i.e., things that can be known. So the idea of rabbit is not known to the One, but it is known to the Mind. This is important, The One is entirely unaware of any level below it. It is not intelligible, and it does not know anything intelligible. If it did, according to the Platonists, it would be a multiplicity. The Mind \"emanates\" the World Soul. The World Soul takes the individual ideas in the Mind and combines them to form the Material World, which it causes to exist. So, the World Soul is the \"form\" of the Material World, and the Mind is the form of the World Soul, and the One is the form of the Mind. So everything is an aspect of the One without actually being the One. Developments in Neoplatonism complicated this slightly by putting in middle terms between each of these four worlds, which roughly correspond to the Tree of Life.</p>\n\n<p>So, starting from the top. Ein Soph is the One. You do not direct your prayers to Ein Soph. Ein Soph is exalted beyond this World and is unconcerned with it. The Mind is the ChaBaD sephiros, that which is technically intelligible. Keter forms the middle term. The idea of a numerical one is intelligible, and it is one, but the One isn't numerically One. It is one only insofar as it is not a multiplicity. ChaBa is Wisdom and Understanding, the Mind, and Daas is the middle between the Mind and the World Soul. Daas is knowledge of what exists, more concrete mental activity as opposed to the more abstract notions of Wisdom and Understanding. The World Soul is represented by the \"Tipheres Circle.\" Tipheres represents the balance between Love and Power (or expansion and repression) and the forces of nature (Netzah and Hod, the \"hands\" of G-d). This is the form of the World. Blessing \"flows\" downwards from the One in the form of continued existence. This \"circle\" emanates the Material World (Malchus) in its image (Yesod which is the link between the two), and changes in the Material World affect changes in the World Soul since they are intimately linked. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theurgy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theurgy</a>, or the manipulation of the Material World in the hopes of affecting higher worlds, finds its manifestation in Kabbalah as a reinterpretation of kavanah, which is defined in Kabbalah as the meditation of the intended spiritual consequences of performance of mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n",

Fish, soup, cholent, liver, eggs and onions, kugel, and I'm sure I'm missing a few others.</p>\n\n<p>What is/are the significance of these foods? (asides from tasting good!)</p>\n\n<p>What other special Shabbos foods am I missing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a Takanath Ezra about some foods in Shabbat.\nThe Mishna in Nedarim (3, 10) says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנודר משובתי שבת--אסור בישראל, ואסור בכותים; מאוכלי השום--אסור בישראל, ואסור בכותים.  מעולי ירושלים--אסור בישראל, ומותר בכותים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and further (8, 4)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רבי יוסי בנו אומר, אמר קונם שום שאיני טועם עד שתהא שבת--אין אסור, אלא עד לילי שבת, שלא נתכוון זה, אלא עד שעה שדרך בני אדם לאכול שום</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"מאוכלי השום\" Jews and Kuthim are called \"garlic eaters\". It is an habits to eat garlic in Lel Shabbat. Why? \nLet's go. I will explain a little more.<br>\nGemara BK (82A):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עשרה תקנות תיקן עזרא שקורין במנחה בשבת... וכו' ומכבסים בחמישי בשבת ואוכלין שום בערב שבת וכו' </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ezra established 10 decress, some of them are related to Shabbath. It is in this context that he establishes to eat garlic. The Gemara enumerates five medicinal virtues of garlic, including that enhance male fertility. It also specifies that night Sabbath is the right time has congugale life for students in Torah (which reintegrated into their homes only at weekends).\n<br><br>\nTo drink wine. There is some texts that I remember.<br>\nThe first in Gemoro Pessahim(106A)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת''ר {שמות כ-ח} זכור את יום השבת לקדשו זוכרהו על היין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We should mention Shabbat with wine<br></p>\n\n<p>The second is a Gemara in Nazir (4A):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ור' שמעון נמי הכתיב מיין ושכר יזיר ההוא מיבעי ליה לאסור יין מצוה כיין הרשות מאי היא קדושתא ואבדלתא  גמרא  הרי מושבע ועומד עליו מהר סיני</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the first reading stage, the Gemara seems to consider that the use of wine Kidush and Havdalah is a commandment of the Torah.<br>\nThe Mefaresh explains</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דכתיב זכור את יום השבת לקדשו זוכרהו על היין אין לי אלא בכניסתו ביציאתו מנין ת''ל כו' (. פסחים דף קו) וקי''ל דנשבע לבטל את המצוה פטור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He actually thinks that even a Nazir to drink wine at Kidush (This opinion is reported in Tosfoth Rabbi Yehuda Hachassid (Brachoth 20B) in the name of Rabbi Yosef Kara who reports himself rabbi Klonimus of Rome.), and reports a drasha on which we will focus later.<br>\nThe Mishna in Berachoth (6, 5) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בירך על היין שלפני המזון, פטר את היין שלאחר המזון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He who blesses the wine before the meal makes quit from. blessing of the wine after the meal. and the <em>Gemara (42B) explains</em> that this is true only in Shabbath and Yom Tov, where we mark the meal with wine.\n<br>\nIn many places Tosfoth counters this explanation, he thinks: The Gemara in Nazir is written otherwise, references to verses are only allusions and not sources. The use of wine at Kidush is a rabbinic command but it is nonetheless a command. As this is the Halacha. <strong>But we have learned the source of the consommation of wine on Shabbath in the Gemara.</strong>\nMany very important elements contained in the response of mbloch. There are still some supplements which I have learned by hearing and say that I do not know original references.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I know a few but far from all - what I find interesting is that there are many <em>halachic</em> reasons behind them</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>soup</strong>: the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.44a.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachot 44a</a> says any meal without soup cannot be called a meal</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>cholent</strong> (from the French <em>chaud-lent</em>, hot-slow): can stay on the fire/plata all night therefore no issue with the <em>melacha</em> of <em>hazara</em> (returning a dish to be cooked)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>gefilte fish</strong>: doesn't have bones so no risk to perform the <em>melacha</em> of <em>borer</em> (selecting the bad from the good)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>kugel</strong>: possibly because it is dry and tastes good even without sauce, therefore no issue of <em>bishul</em> of a dish in sauce (see also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3131238/jewish/Why-Eat-Kugel-on-Shabbat.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>fish</strong> in general: fish is the only animal that didn't fault before the <em>mabul</em> (flood) and <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/749633/rabbi-avraham-gordimer/parshas-noach-why-were-the-fish-spared-/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">therefore wasn't destroyed</a>, see also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3491/eating-fish-on-shabbos\">here</a> on MY and <a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/halacha-hashkafa/why-do-we-eat-fish-on-shabbat/2024/01/03/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>challot</strong>: two loaves of bread for <em>lehem mishne</em> (either the double portion of manna on Fridays, or <em>shamor v'zakhor</em> et yom hashabat)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>couscous</strong>: I need a placeholder for this (my Sephardic wife wouldn't forgive me otherwise) but cannot think about the halachic background</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As @Daniel notes in the comments, it is a mitzva to eat hot food on shabbos lunch, based on the words of Ba’al HaMaor (R Zerachiah HaLevi from Gerona, who lived in the mid-1100s) - from <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/this_week/insights_into_halacha/5294\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is a Takanas Chachamim to enjoy the Shabbos with a\nhot dish.

In Western culture we don't expect to see royalty wearing \"a snake-like crown,\" yet in some parts of the world \"head-dresses\" are a common occurrence: </p>\n\n<p>In India the <em>maangtika</em> is a traditional head piece worn most often at weddings, traditionally by the Hindu bride. It consists of a metallic string, with an attractive pendant attached at one end, which may be of any shape and adorned with precious or semi-precious stones. The <em>maangtika</em> is worn at the middle parting of the hair. Muslim brides wear a <em>jhoomar</em>, which is a similar beautiful ornamental head piece, on one side of the forehead.</p>\n\n<p><em>Bajuband</em> and <em>Vanki</em> are traditional armlets worn on the upper arm. They often have to be secured in place with a gold string. Armlets were traditionally worn by Indian men and women. Some common designs on them include creepers or snakes entwining.</p>\n\n<p>While these Egyptian and Indian customs symbolize different things their relevance to the meaning of <em>tefillin</em> should be apparent even though these customs do not explain the usage of the words <em>totafoth</em> (<em>tefillin shel yad</em> and <em>shel rosh</em>) or <em>totafeth</em> (<em>appuzainu</em>, an ornament worn on the forehead.\") in the Torah and the Mishnayoth.</p>\n\n<p>For a discussion of the term <em>totafoth</em> see this article <a href=\"http://www.balashon.com/2007/01/totafot.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.balashon.com/2007/01/totafot.html</a> where\n<em>Tigay</em> also suggests \"headband\", but derives the word <em>totafot</em> from the Arabic <em>tafa</em> - \"go around, encircle\".</p>\n\n<p><em>Tigay</em> discusses the derivation in this article here: <strong><em>On the Meaning of T(W)TPT on JSTOR</em></strong>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> on <em>Shmoth</em> (13:16) says the <em>totafoth</em> are to be worn as \"an ornament\" between the eyes; although the Torah (<em>Shmoth</em> 13:9) refers to the <em>totafoth</em> as a <em>zikkaron</em> (remembrance - memorial) for whoever sees them [the <em>tefillin</em>] bound between the eyes will recall <em>Pesach</em> and the miracle [of the Exodus] and speak about it, as it says, \"that the Law of <em>HaShem</em> may be in your mouth\" (13.9).</p>\n\n<p>When we say a <em>Bracha</em> over the Hand <em>tefillin</em> we say it with the intention that the <em>Bracha</em> covers the Head <em>tefillin</em> as well. It is explained that the single <em>bracha</em> covers both because, it says, \"bind them for a sign upon your arm and let them be for a remembrance between your eyes;\" and <strong><em>them</em></strong> is written in the plural (<strong><em>them</em></strong> being the words of Torah).</p>\n\n<p>We read in <em>Shmoth</em> 33.4-6 \"And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned; and no man did put on him his עֶדְיוֹ ornaments. And the L-RD said unto Moses: 'Say unto the children of Israel: Ye are a stiffnecked people; if I go up into the midst of thee for one moment, I shall consume thee; therefore now put off thy ornaments עֶדְיְךָ from thee, that I may know what to do unto thee.' And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments אֶת-עֶדְיָם from mount <em>Horeb</em> onward.\" </p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew root used for ornaments is <em>ayd</em> (witness): Maimonides writes in his <em>Mishnah Torah</em> (4.26) that \"one who prays the <em>Shema</em> without wearing <em>Tefillin</em> violates eight precepts of the Torah and bears false witness against himself!\"</p>\n\n<p>Isaiah 43.10 states \"Ye are My witnesses, saith the L-RD, ....\"</p>\n\n<p>Thus, we see from non-Jewish cultural traditions or customs and from Jewish custom that the <em>totafoth</em> (ornaments) serve as a symbol of sovereignty, authority, and royalty; and should be for Jews as a constant reminder of <em>Pesach</em>, of the Exodus and that the Jew is always a witness of HaShem's miracles; which, upon seeing the <em>totafoth</em> worn on the forehead would elicit or inspire a discussion of <em>HaShem's</em> Oath to the Patriarchs and of <em>HaShem's</em> as well as Israel's sovereignty, authority, royalty and the miracles leading up to the sanctification of the firstborn, the Passover Festival, the Exodus and the conquest of and settlement of Canaan (<em>Eretz Yisrael</em>). </p>\n\n\n",

God created this impulse for a purpose. It is meant to push people to get married and have children, and later to strengthen the love-bonds between husband and wife. This impulse is a very strong and important tool; we should keep safe and use it at the right time and place. This idea greatly helped me live through the hormonal years of the youth.</p>\n\n<p>Now, thank God, I am married. I love my wife and I use the physical impulse for the purpose it was created for. But... I still have impulse towards other women. I do not understand why this impulse is needed? Why did God create it? Apparently it does not serve any good purpose. I ask because I want to cope with it better, and the best way to cope with something is to know what it is really there for.</p>\n\n<p>EDIT: Although hillel's answer is good, it is too general. Our sages explicitly say that the physical attraction is there, not only to give us a spiritual challenge to overcome, but also to push us to build the world (they say that, when the sages of \"knesset hagdola\" canceled this attraction, they could not find a fresh egg... so they had to bring it back, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.69b?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">see Yoma 69b</a>). I would very much appreciate an answer in this spirit.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>The question was edited to add the reference to the fact that when the Yetzer Hara was totaly eliminated, chickens stopped laying eggs. This means that the general concept of \"lust\" means that there is a desire to actually do or accomplish. This means that without the drive that we have, people cannot accomplish anything in this world. If we never felt hungry, we would starve to death. Thus, without the \"lust\" that we feel, we would never get married in the first place. An example can be see in the writings of <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/No-Holds-Barred-Kosher-lust-346358\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Shmuley Boteach</a> as shown in the example that I linked.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Original</strong>\nThis is discussed in many areas for example, Rabbi Eliyahu Dessler in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michtav Me'Eliyahu</a> in Kuntras Habechirah, (Michtav MaEliyahu, Vol. 1, page 111-119) explains that everybody is given free will in order to be able to raise himself to whatever level that he is capable of reaching. If a person was only attracted to one person, they would not be able to resist behaving inappropriately nor would it be a matter of free will. Similarly, if one \"<em>mated for life</em>\" and never felt any attraction to another, we would be no more than animals in this respect and would not deserve reward or punishment.</p>\n\n<p>While this is one of the greatest tests, it is still no different (in essence) than feeling a desire for non-kosher food.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michtav Me'Eliyahu</a> as well as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliyahu_Eliezer_Dessler#Michtav_me-Eliyahu\" rel=\"nofollow\">Michtav Me'Eliyahu</a></p>\n  \n  <p>One well known idea of his, expounded on in Michtav me-Eliyahu, is the\n  Nekudas Habechira (point of free will). He states that a man has one\n  point in his service to G-d where he has to fight his evil\n  inclination, while at other points there will be no struggle, for the\n  levels below his Nekudas Habechira have already been conquered,and he\n  will easily win those battles of will; whereas levels higher than his\n  Nekudas Habechira are not yet within his grasp. (For example, someone\n  who adheres to Orthodox Judaism will have no problem keeping kosher,\n  but may sometimes be tempted to rely on unreliable kosher supervision,\n  while somebody farther away from religious practice will have to\n  struggle with whether to eat a ham sandwich (which is non-kosher\n  regardless of supervision).) Each time one defeats the evil\n  inclination by choosing to do good over evil, his Nekudas Habechira is\n  raised a bit higher, and that choice will be easier for him to make in\n  the future. Consequently, Man's task in life is to consistently raise\n  his Nekudas Habechira, thus growing ever greater in his service of\n  God.[1]</p>\n  \n  <p>[1]Michtav me-Eliyahu vol. 1 pp. 113</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would like to try to answer this question as it relates to your request on function you said \n\" I ask because I want to cope with it better, and the best way to cope with something is to know what it is really there for.\" which means you are looking to change ...</p>\n\n<p>you are asking about change and coping IMO</p>\n\n<p>Coping: Coping with thoughts about other women is shown in behavioural research to be very common, most married monogamous men and women report having these thoughts, just because science in terms of evolutionary biology, says it exists and serves a purpose.

If you have mild to  lust here are some ideas about not succumbing to it...being a man or a women lust wreaks havoc. I should know, I am a someone who is guilty of it, and live with that regret. So I am speaking from personal experience, and can tell you that I have not only repented of this sin but taken very SERIOUS steps to not let it happen again. Being 44 years of age I have lived long enough to speak to this. Lol. </p>\n\n<p>Disclaimer: These ideas are from my training as a Acceptance and Commitment (ACT) Therapist. So this type of therapy is used in treatment of unwanted behaviours. </p>\n\n<p>So think about it this way, \nYou value your wife, and you value beautiful women. Your actions towards your wife is based on your values i.e she is beautiful and so you are attracted to her. You also value being sexually pure in thoughts and actions. </p>\n\n<p>Values based actions are not only in line with aligning with Hashem's desires for your life but values based action is also scientifically proved to help you not AVOID things... (see ACT Therapy and any research by Dr Steven Hayes) </p>\n\n<p>If you are having lust or thoughts that are not according to your values, to cope with that you can do the following according to the \"ACT model\" of living a values based life \nScientifically proven approach to recover from habitual unwanted behavior </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Focus on what is important and make small steps towards committed action. ie. when you think of other women, notice that-and refocus your mind towards moving towards what you value and whats important, ie, living a life with habits and actions pleasing and honouring to Hashem</p></li>\n<li><p>If you are using images of other women as an avoidance mechanism- ie. feeling lonley or stressed or not being fulfilled notice perhaps how you feel when you start to think lust full thoughts..are your tired? are you lonely? When notice that you can choose to  t focus on committed action towards whats important-can take action-REST or call someone etc and notice how this improves your moves a way from whats most important to you.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>In my opinion its about being VERY CLEAR on values clarification, and noticing when you are not living according to your values and then making committed action to correct the thought, action or behaviour. </p>\n\n<p>THis is based on values based research from contextualscience.org. or Steven Hayes or Dr Russ Harris work mainly if you want to read more about it. </p>\n\n<p>If you want to see how ACT can help with lust also this link can help which is Russ's ideas on not getting \"hooked\" by these thoughts </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.actmindfully.com.au/upimages/Choice_Point_2.0_A_Brief_Overview_-_Russ_Harris_April_2017.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.actmindfully.com.au/upimages/Choice_Point_2.0_A_Brief_Overview_-_Russ_Harris_April_2017.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>I would like to end my saying I am glad you asked this question, as it is something we all struggle with, and it takes courage to ask this! </p>\n\n<p>Warm Regards, \nRay Frank </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Why does G-d tempt us? \nTo reward us when we do good.</p>\n\n<p>The 'Sahtan' (aka Satan) is an agent of G-d who puts challenges before you and hopes you will over-come them and he, that angel who brings temptation, rejoices when you over-come the temptations.</p>\n\n<p>If you're going to be given an infinity of reward for something, the harder the task, the sweeter the reward.</p>\n\n<p>Nobody every got any happiness out of something that was just given to them, including the lottery.

He must anticipate what will be needed in the future. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Torah, however, sets the working week first, to be followed by the\n  day of rest, the holy Shabbat. \"Six days shall work be done\" and only\n  then \"the seventh day is a Shabbat of solemn rest\" -- the exact\n  reverse of general practice. The precedence of labor before rest\n  indicates that the purpose of man on earth is not to while away his\n  time indolently, but to work for his spiritual as well as his own\n  material welfare and for that of his community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My son cited from the Lekach Tov (quoting Rav Ganzfried who wrote the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch) at his son's Sholom Zachar Parshas Vayakhel 5776 the following explanation.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility is shown <a href=\"http://www.openyeshiva.com/texts/vayakhel_pikudei_5767.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">in Vayakhel</a> in order to teach that no matter what people do, the actual \"work\" (accomplishment) comes from Hashem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And so the Torah tells us, 6 days shall work be done; “te’aseh\n  melacha” work shall be done, in the passive voice, because they were\n  all to understand that it was God who was doing the work, and that\n  they shouldn’t take credit for it</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also cited the Netziv that during the building of the Mishkan, the Bnei Yisrael were machmir that even work done on Friday was completed fully before Shabbos. That is, that not only the active work was completed, but that even the sitting and completing the work passively (when it would normally have been allowed) was finished before Shabbos. An example would be letting wool sit in the dye vat over Shabbos (when already at the point that it would have been allowed according to halacha) was not done.</p>\n\n\n",

Does she inherit before death?After death? How does it work??</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>By the standard laws of the Torah, a daughter does not inherit the parents where there are male, though unmarried daughters may be supported from the estate. </p>\n\n<p>There are two methodologies that may be used to ensure that female children have an \"inheritance\" of sorts.</p>\n\n<p>The first is simple - one who is not yet dead, even if they are terminally ill and/or dying, may divide their estate prior to death with a written document or even verbally. Someone who divides their whole estate in this manner can bequest his possessions to anyone, even a non-relative. This method may also abrogate the standard law of giving the first born a double portion of the estate, though there are debates surrounding whether it is proper to do so. There are some complicated details surround edge cases (if a person is being executed, for instance, or if they suddenly bounce back from death), but generally this is fairly straightforward to implement - a witnessed declaration that a persons possessions are transferred before his death in xyz manner suffices.</p>\n\n<p>The second method requires that a legal document (shtar) be written and notarized during the life of the parent to create a contingency in the process of the inheritance. This contingency specifies that one or all of the daughters are to be deemed as sons for the purposes of dividing the estate. Such a division must be accepted by all relevant inheritors for it to be valid. In order to quell any objections to this modification, the document stipulates that refusal to abide by the terms of this division (accepting the daughter as having a right to inherit equal to the sons) will remove them from inheritance and give the entire estate to the daughter(s).</p>\n\n<p>In the first method, the estate is technically given to the children before the death of the parent, though when exactly that occurs is a matter of the exact language used in the process.</p>\n\n<p>In the second method, the estate is inherited upon death of the parent and divided through this prearranged compromise. Failure to abide by that compromise retroactively awards the estate to the daughter(s).</p>\n\n<p>This is a very complicated section of law, and there are those who are experts at creating simultaneously legally binding and halachically valid wills. If this is at all a practical matter, please consult your local rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

I have heard, but do not believe it to be correct, that the halacha is that one must prefer death to (1) forced conversion to another religion, (2) cursing the name of G-d, and (3) (one other which I forget!). This seems to me contrary to the idea that the laws are for life, and not that life is for the purpose of the laws, for example, it is permitted to eat tref in order to save one's life.

They are idolatry, murder, and sexual impropriety.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ramba\"m</a>, one must also die to avoid public desecration of God's name (e.g. if someone threatens to kill you if you do not perform a sin in public) or when there is a public decree in the land against performing <em>mitzvot</em>. In those cases, death should be chosen over any sin.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This seems to me contrary to the idea that the laws are for life, and not that life is for the purpose of the laws, for example, it is permitted to eat tref in order to save one's life. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I disagree with your claim. I think to some extent, the purpose of life is to follow the laws in order to get closer to God. Eating non-kosher food in order to survive allows us to perform more <em>mitzvot</em> that we wouldn't get a chance to do it we were dead. But if the purpose of life is to get close to God and sanctify his name, it makes sense that we should choose death over doing something that desecrates the name of God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a verse that seems to say to live through or by means of the mitzvot. We shall see later that this is not quite an injunction. The verse say's \"VeHay Bahem\". <br>\nWe will begin the study of the subject by the following assertion. (Gemara Sanhedrin 74A)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא א''ר ישמעאל מנין שאם אמרו לו לאדם עבוד עבודת כוכבים ואל תהרג מנין שיעבוד ואל יהרג ת''ל {ויקרא יח-ה} וחי בהם ולא שימות בהם {Has it not been taught: R`Ishmael said: whence do we know that if a man was bidden, 'Engage in idolatry and save your life', that he should do so, and not be slain? From the verse, [Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgements,' which if a man do] he shall live in them: but not die by them. I might think that it may even be openly practised. but Scripture teaches, Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed? '}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not the opinion retained for the Halacha but it is good as an introduction to the subject, because his reference to our verse around the law of \"Yeahreg Veal Yaavor\".<br> Rabbi Yshmael reads our verse as an injunction, saying that attachment to Mitzvot is not to take over life. But we looked earlier that perhaps the message of the Torah is prognostic in nature. The Torah's message may be: the prognosis (of the Torah) is that thanks to the mitzvot you live (finally). We will trying to visit this subject according to another of drashath Chachamim.<br>\nWe have already announced that according to the Sifra it is a promise:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וחי בהם - \n  לעולם הבא. \n  ואם תאמר בעולם הזה והלא סופו מת הוא, הא מה אני מקיים וחי בהם? \n  לעולם הבא. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You will live in the \"'next' world\" (after the live). <br>\nAppaently the two Hazal contradict one another.\n<br>\nRabbi Yshmael will continue and clarify that there is a principle of passing life before the offense mitzvot is inapplicable when it comes to break publicly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יכול אפילו בפרהסיא תלמוד לומר {ויקרא כב-לב} ולא תחללו את שם קדשי ונקדשתי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He learned this from another verse we will examine.\n<br>\nוְלֹא תְחַלְּלוּ אֶת <strong>שֵׁם</strong> קָדְשִׁי וְנִקְדַּשְׁתִּי בְּתוֹךְ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל אֲנִי ה' <strong>מְקַדִּשְׁכֶם</strong>: \n<br>\nLet's reading and comment the Sifra:\n <strong>ולא תחללו</strong> \nשומע אני ממשמע שנאמר ולא תחלל אמור <strong>קדש</strong> (the verb should be in the active form \"Sanctify\") וכשהוא אומר <strong>ונקדשתי</strong> מסור את עצמך וקדש שמי. \nיכול ביחיד? \nתלמוד לומר:(This occurs, (i.e. that the gift of your life leads to sanctification of My Name)).  בתוך בני ישראל המרובים.(Among the children of Israel (that is to say in the presence of an assembly of Jews))\n<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now consider the dialectic between the promise of life and the importance of ensuring <strong>name</strong> (that is to say a public renown of G_d). We will guide our reflection. There is in a Jewish act (i.e wen a Jew makes an act) an <strong>expression</strong>, in the same way that mention name denotes an object. This dimension is <strong>obvious when the actions of a man are public</strong>. For a Jew, his public activity is related to the meaning of the name G_d.<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>A second step is to note that there are <strong>highly expressive acts</strong>.  In this they are similar to <strong>language</strong>. Such as bow down to an idol. Let's say that acting in such acts is like talking. In this perspective, idolatry in general is more meaningful than the desecration of Shabbat.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The third step of our reasoning is to see in certain acts such <strong>degree of meaning</strong> they disturb man, <strong>even when he is alone</strong>. It is here that fits the divergence between Rabbi Yshmael and Chachamim:\n<br> Sanhedrin hop. cit.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א''ר יוחנן משום ר''ש בן יהוצדק נימנו וגמרו בעליית בית נתזה בלוד כל עבירות שבתורה אם אומרין לאדם עבור ואל תהרג יעבור ואל יהרג חוץ מעבודת כוכבים \n  <br></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Idolatry</strong>, even in the discretion is \"Yahreg Veal Ya'avor\" d/t his expressivity.\n<br>\nRegarding <strong>the other two offenses</strong> It's different. (And besides, there is no Machloketh). </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Gemara say's about the <strong>killing</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי יימר דדמא דידך סומק טפי דילמא דמא דהוא גברא סומק טפי </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Who says <strong>your blood is redder than his?</strong>\" We can not justify thinking of saving himself by causing the death of another.<br>\nGilui Arayoth may be similar perhaps to the latter. But I confess really did not understand.</p>\n\n<p><p>Returning to the beginning of the remarks of Rabbi Ishmael. He sees in the verse \"Vechay Bahem\" a message that the effort not to violate must not take over the life which is assumed to be a value as there is a promise of life (life in general).</p><br>\nI hope to have put a little light</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As Daniel wrote the three averot that one must not do even to avoid death are Avoda Zara (idolatry), murder, and Gilui Arayut (sexual impropriety)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Nevanzal (his books of the parasha) explained why are these three are the averot that one must not do even to avoid death. He explains that these three are working against the way of life... </p>\n\n<p>1 - Avoda Zara - Our whole purpose of life is to embrace G-d so worshiping anything else will differ the purpose of life. (This doesn't mean that you rather die than to convert another religion.

(I rather die than kill also because who says that my blood is better than someone else)</p>\n\n<p>3 - Gilui Arayut (sexual impropriety) - I forgot his reason.</p>\n\n<p>At the end he also says that all three are really a form of Avoda Zara (idolatry), but I also forgot how he got to this.</p>\n\n<p>p.s.</p>\n\n<p>sorry that there are so many parts that I forgot.</p>\n\n\n",

He proves this from the Sifri (Naso 39) which says Kohanim is said by the \"Chazzan\" (in context \"Chazzan\" there is like what we call \"Gabbai\"), and from the Talmud in Sotah (39b) which calls the one who calls out \"Kohanim\" the \"Korei\", as opposed to the one who prompts the words of the blessing the \"Shatz\". Tosfot continues to cite opinions that this was true only when it wasn't common for the Chazzan to recite \"Eloheinu...\" regularly in his repetition, but now that it is [possibly because the Kohanim had stopped Duchening every day? -- AA] he can just say that paragraph and say the word \"Kohanim\" out loud in order that it not be a Hefsek.</p>\n\n<p>R Meir HaKohein of Rothenberg, in his Haghot Maymoniot (Tefillah 14:8), notes that his teacher, Maharm of Rothenberg, told him of his practice to recited \"Eloheinu...\" quietly and \"Kohanim\" out loud in order not to deviate from the custom that the Chazzan calls \"Kohanim\", but when questioned by R Meir haKoehin how he could say that paragraph at all when it was designed only for instances when no Kohanim were present, Maharam admitted and abandoned that practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur (OC 128) quotes Tosfot and Maharam's original practice but leaves off the end of the story.</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Yosef says the common practice is like the Rambam, and so he rules in his Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x494\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 128:10</a>), while the Rama there notes some who practice like Maharam's initial practice.

I didn't (yet) look in the Tur, but the Rambam in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01999.html#HtmpReportNum0017_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הלכות תפילה וברכת כהנים - פרק ארבעה עשר</a> seems to imply that it's <strong>not</strong> the שְּׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר  who says these words. (So <em>(בַּטּוּר בְּשֵׁם ר''י וְרמב''ם)</em> may be referring to the beginning of the phrase.)</p>\n\n<p>The entire time the Rambam mentions הַשְּׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר and then for our point he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ה':</strong> אֵין <strong>הַמַּקְרֵא</strong> רַשַּׁאי (לְהַקְרוֹת לַכֹּהֲנִים) עַד שֶׁיִּכְלֶה אָמֵן מִפִּי הַצִּבּוּר. וְאֵין הַכֹּהֲנִים רַשָּׁאִין לְהַתְחִיל בַּבְּרָכָה עַד שֶׁיִּכְלֶה הַדִּבּוּר מִפִּי הַמַּקְרֵא.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Making it sound like the שְּׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר doesn't call the Cohanim. More puzzling, as the  לחם משנה  and  כסף משנה  point out, is that the Rambam actually says that nobody calls the Cohanim, and they start by themselves.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ג':</strong>  כֵּיצַד הִיא נְשִׂיאַת כַּפַּיִם בַּגְּבוּלִין. בְּעֵת שֶׁיַּגִּיעַ שְׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר לַעֲבוֹדָה כְּשֶׁיֹּאמַר רְצֵה כָּל הַכֹּהֲנִים הָעוֹמְדִים בְּבֵית הַכְּנֶסֶת נֶעֱקָרִין מִמְּקוֹמָן וְהוֹלְכִין וְעוֹלִין לַדּוּכָן וְעוֹמְדִים שָׁם פְּנֵיהֶם לַהֵיכָל וַאֲחוֹרֵיהֶם כְּלַפֵּי הָעָם וְאֶצְבְּעוֹתֵיהֶם כְּפוּפוֹת לְתוֹךְ כַּפֵּיהֶם <strong>עַד שֶׁיַּשְׁלִים שְׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר הַהוֹדָאָה וּמַחְזִירִין פְּנֵיהֶם כְּלַפֵּי הָעָם וּפוֹשְׁטִין אֶצְבְּעוֹתֵיהֶן וּמַגְבִּיהִין  יְדֵיהֶם כְּנֶגֶד כִּתְפֵיהֶם וּמַתְחִילִין</strong>  'יְבָרֶכְךָ'. וּשְׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר מַקְרֵא אוֹתָם מִלָּה מִלָּה וְהֵם עוֹנִים...‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note how here too he uses the term שְּׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר.</p>\n\n<p>The Kitzur in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0099_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">108:8</a> says that it's the Chazzan who says it, but he says כֹּהֲנִים as part of the regular אֱלֹקֵינוּ וֵאֱלֹקֵי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ, just saying the rest quietly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>הַשְּׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר אוֹמֵר</strong> אֱלֹקֵינוּ וֵאֱלֹקֵי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ, בָּרְכֵנוּ בַּבְרָכָה וְכוּ' בְּלַחַשׁ, וְתֵיבַת <strong>כֹּהֲנִים</strong> אוֹמֵר בְּקוֹל רָם, וּבָזֶה הוּא קוֹרֵא אֶת הַכֹּהֲנִים שֶׁיְבָרֵכוּ. וְשׁוּב אוֹמֵר בְּלַחַשׁ, עַם קְדוֹשֶׁךָ כָּאָמוּר‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01582.html#HtmpReportNum0127_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">108:18</a> says like the Remo that the Chazzan should only say כֹּהֲנִים - but if he has the custom to say the rest, it must be done quietly.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>י\"ח:</strong> כשעולים על הדוכן – עומדים פניהם כלפי ההיכל, ואחוריהם כלפי העם, ואצבעותיהם כפופים לתוך כפיהם דלא כמו בשעת הברכה. עד שמסיים שליח הציבור ברכת ''הטוב שמך...'', והציבור עונין ''אמן'', <strong>והשליח ציבור אומר בקול ''כהנים''</strong> – ואז מחזירין פניהם כלפי העם ואחוריהם כנגד ההיכל. דכך צוה הקדוש ברוך הוא: ''כה תברכו'' – פנים כנגד פנים אמור להם, כאדם האומר לחברו (סוטה לח א). וכמה חביבים ישראל לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא שהרשה לכהנים לעמוד אחוריהם כלפי היכל בשביל ברכות ישראל.‏ <br/>\n  <strong>והשליח ציבור לא יאמר כלל ''אלהינו ואלהי אבותינו ברכנו...''</strong>, כי אין לו ענין לברכת כהנים. ואפילו <strong>אותן הנוהגים לאמרו יזהרו לומר בלחש</strong>. וכשיגיע ל''כהנים'' יאמר ''כהנים'' בקול, ו''עם קדושיך כאמור'' בלחש. וכן נוהגין במדינות אלו.‏ <br/> \n  ויש משליחי ציבור טועים, שאומרים בקול ''אלהינו...'', ויש להזהירם על זה. וכן מוכח להדיא בסוטה (לט ב) שאומר שם: אין הקורא רשאי לקרות ''כהנים'' עד שיכלה ''אמן'' מפי הציבור – הרי שקריאת כהנים סמוך ממש להברכה. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that there's no hefsek for the Chazzan to say כֹּהֲנִים; yet it seems from the Shulchan Aruch (and Rambam?) that there are opinions that somebody else should say it.</p>\n\n\n",

[Therefore, God implores Moses to leave\n  Him alone so that He can destroy Israel.] -[from Exod. Rabbah 42:9]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the same as the question about the mabul of Noach. It is also similar to the destruction of S'dom. There are times that no matter how much a child is loved, he has gone so far as to totally destroy his existence. Bnai Yisrael had put themselves in the position of eventually destroying the world. They had acted in a way that would make them like Yishmael to Avraham or Esav to Yitzchak. Hashem could not allow this to continue. </p>\n\n<p>Consider also the situation of parents who have a ben sorer umore. They had to bring their son to judgment. It is a tragedy and one of the utmost sadness, but it must be done.</p>\n\n<p>The world only exists because of the three pillars of Torah, Avodah, and Gemilus Cahsadim.  Bnei Yisroel were in the process of destroying these pillars. It was the choice between them and the world.</p>\n\n<p>As we see in Rashi this was actually Hashem requesting Moshe to intervene to prevent the destruction. Noach is castigated for not begging Hashem to save the world (as Avraham did for S'dom). Moshe did not make the mistake that Noach did, but did step forward (as Hashem had wanted) to save them.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains similarly that the language used הַנִּיחָה לִּי makes the command \"hypothetical\" and that Hashem is giving Moshe the choice to intercede or not. Also, it is not that this is because of Hashem's anger but that this is the inevitable reaction to the action that they did (just as jumping off a cliff leads to falling to death). Additionally, it is not because of Moshe that he will be the start of the new people, but that Hashem will still keep the promise to the Avos in any case (through Moshe).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>So the meaning is: if you were to leave it to me, i.e., if you do not\n  intervene and intercede, if the people are left to themselves, if\n  nothing comes forward out of the people, and in the people, to\n  mitigate and help them over the apostasy, there is no alternative but\n  that they will be destroyed.

I was wondering if anyone here had heard of an explanation for this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I've noticed that a general pattern to many of the differences between Terumah and Vayakhel is that Terumah has a more precise account of the relationship between different parts or descriptions of the Mishkan.  I think this indicates a difference between Hashem's understanding of the Mishkan and a human understanding.  Betzalel and his workers created the Mishkan as Hashem said and could understand each piece in isolation, but didn't quite understand the whole picture of the Mishkan.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Your example of the poles - בהם indicates the relationship between the poles and the Aron, which the people building the Mishkan couldn't quite get.</li>\n<li>Several times (regarding the yerios and also the yados of the kerashim) it says אשה אל אחותה in Terumah, indicating the relationship between the two curtains or yados, while in Vayakhel it says אחת אל אחת.</li>\n<li>Regarding the menorah, in Terumah it says בַּקָּנֶה הָאֶחָד twice, while in Vayakhel the second time it says בְּקָנֶה אֶחָד.  This isn't 100% the same as my other examples, but it goes in a similar direction - while Hashem sees each branch's special task, a human can only understand part of it, and the second one is just \"a branch\".</li>\n<li>I originally included this one, but it's probably incorrect because all the manuscripts quoted by Daat Mikra have a kamatz in both Terumah and Vayakhel.\n\n<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">\n  <p> At the end of the menorah, in Terumah it says כִּכַּר זָהָב טָהוֹר, \"you should make it out of a talent of pure gold\", while in Vayakhel it says כִּכָּר זָהָב טָהוֹר, \"he made it a talent, out of pure gold\" (note Artscroll misses this subtle difference).  Hashem sees the relationship between the two adjectives, a human only sees that it weighs a talent and that it's made of pure gold, in isolation.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I'm the first to admit that this is lacking details, but I think as a general picture it works.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would suggest the following Chiddush, but I welcome feedback as usual.</p>\n\n<p>The prohibition of removing the Badim immediately follows in Shemos 25, but not in Shemos 37.

See <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemot/25.15#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">various Rishonim to 25:15</a> that link the carrying of the Aron with the prohibition of removing the Badim.

And he\n  coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. (Mechon Mamre)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a very clear difference here – the last clause of the first version about doubling the sixth curtain is entirely absent in the second version. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> noticed this and writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא הזכיר כפל היריעה כי הכתוב אחז דרך קצרה</p>\n  \n  <p>[The Torah] did not mention the doubling of the curtain because it\n  grasped the path of brevity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While it is not entirely clear what his exact point is, I think he is saying that because everything was already stated with all the details in Parshas Terumah, the Torah has no obligation to repeat every detail here, and thus if a detail was left out it is a non-issue. We can apply this to the entire topic of the repetition of this parsha – for the most part the Torah repeated everything, but it felt no need to repeat every single detail, and there might not be any point in asking why a specific detail was not repeated.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> has a discussion about why the Torah repeated everything to begin with, and one of his suggestions is that this was simply the way that people told stories back then and the Torah conformed to the normal way of talking. This also might indicate that there is not necessarily a real \"reason\" for any particular inclusion or deviation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואפשר שנאמר שכבר היה מנהג האנשים ההם בזמן מתן תורה שיהיו סיפוריהם בזה\n  האופן והנביא אמנם ידבר לפי המנהג</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

That is why modern slaughterhouses  and people who butcher at home usually stun or kill the animal before letting the blood.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any ancient writings describing the methodology of sacrificing animals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is the method of shechitah (ritual slaughtering used today. We are commanded that the method of slaughtering used for animals (for regular eating) must be the same method as used for the altar. This is explained in Talmud Bavli Masechet Chulin 38a. See the Rashi below.</p>\n\n<p>To explain in more detail, the talmud says that we use the method of shechita which is cutting the throat of the animal using a knife to sever more than 50% of both the esophagus <strong>and</strong> windpipe. </p>\n\n<p>Note that puncturing the animal as with the point of a knife or a spear, invalidates the shechita. Killing or stunning the animal prior to the shechitah invalidates the procedure. The second temple had rings set in the floor to hold the animal in place.</p>\n\n<p>Birds were slaughtered using a different procedure called melikah (using the fingernail to sever the back of the neck). <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/halacha-overview/chapter45.html\">Torah.org</a> cites <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9906#showrashi=true&v=8\">Vayikra 5:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>8 He shall bring them to the kohen, who shall first offer up that\n  [bird] which is [designated] for the sin offering.

I'm not sure if it was always like that and it was just being firmly stated, or if it was a new thing. Not sure if this should be it's own question, but this question assumes the latter (that before then, prophecy was accepted in the realm of halacha).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One of the ways one knows a prophet is false is if he attempts to overturn a halakhah on a permanent basis. (See Rambam, Yesodei haTorah 9:4, Chinukh mitvah #517.) A prophet could be told to make a one-time exception, as Eliyahu did when he offered a sacrificed on Mt Carmel. (Rambam ibid 9:3)</p>\n\n<p>So, if someone were to come claiming to be Elijah, some other fellow is the mashiach, and a whole bunch of halakhah is getting changed through extralegal means, we know he's lying.</p>\n\n<p>However, with the arrival of the messiah (or perhaps somewhat before or after) will be the restoration of the Sanhedrin. One high court can overturn the rulings of an earlier court. According to the Rambam (Hilkhos Mamrim ch. 2), the rules are:</p>\n\n<p>1- Any Sanhedrin can overturn the legal <strong>interpretations</strong> of an earlier Sanhedrin, including derashos (laws derived by through formal hermeneutics of the Torah's text). So if they understand a Torah law or otherwise preexisting law differently, the law could change to fit their understanding.</p>\n\n<p>2- A Sanhedrin that is greater in wisdom and number than an earlier court can repeal that earlier court's <strong>legislation</strong>. This speaks to undoing the creation of new law.</p>\n\n<p>(In practice, I would expect a court that was not greater in wisdom and number would not be too willing to exercise the power to second-guess prior legal decisions either. But the power is theirs to wield.)</p>\n\n<p>So, an ideal messianic Sanhedrin, which would be even greater in number and wisdom than Chazal's couts could indeed change much of halakhah from the way our Chazal interpreted and legislated. In regular, halachic process, ways.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above: Statements like the Zohar's that after the mashiach comes we will switch from following Beis Hillel's rulings to beis Shammai's are aggadic, cannot be taken at face value. It could just be voicing an expectation of how the future Sanhedrin will rule, or even more meta... that they keep current rulings, but the new Sanhedrin would conceptually more Shamaitic in outlook. We'll see that they mean when it happens. But the Torah itself cannot change.</p>\n\n<p>By the way... the source for requiring that law be created by legislative process, with any prophetic input to be ignored, is derived from the verse: \"לֹא בַשָּׁמַיִם הִואֿ -- it is not in heaven.\" (Devarim 30:12) This is invoked in Bava Metzia 59b. Which is why, when Moshe died and 300 laws were forgotten, another 700 thrown into doubt, the rulings are not restored by prophecy. Rather, Osniel ben Kenaz reestablished them deductively, using the rules of legislation. (Yuma 80a)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Dipping in a basket vs. on a bench\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Note that a spring is usable as a <em>mikva</em> for some purposes (e.g., a <em>zav</em> or <em>m'tzora</em>'s dipping) and in some conditions (viz, with fewer than forty <em>s'a</em> and/or while not pooled) that a <em>mikva</em> is not. Sometimes, though, stuff can happen to spring water, after it has come out of the earth, that renders it no longer considered spring water. For example, <em>Mishnayos Mikvaos</em> 5:2 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>העבירו על גבי כלים או על גבי ספסל רבי יהודה אומר הרי הוא כמו שהיה רבי יוסי אומר הרי הוא כמקוה ובלבד שלא יטביל על גבי הספסל</p>\n<p>If he caused [spring output] to go over [the outsides of] receptacles or over a bench, <em>R. Y'huda</em> says it's [considered a spring] like it was and <em>R. Yose</em> says it's considered a <em>mikva</em> provided he doesn't dip on top of the bench.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Rambam</em> rules (<em>Yad</em>, <em>Mikvaos</em> 9:10) like <em>R. Yose</em>.</p>\n<p><sub>(<em>Rash</em> and <em>Rav</em> explain that the <em>tanaim</em> are arguing over whether it's considered a spring so that it doesn't require forty <em>s'a</em> or to be pooled in order to be used as a <em>mikva</em>. <em>Rosh</em> explains that they're arguing over whether it's considered a spring so that it can be used by a <em>zav</em> or a <em>m'tzora</em>.)</sub></p>\n<p>The problem here is that one cannot dip <strong>in</strong> a receptacle. That, <em>Rosh</em> explains, is why <em>R. Yose</em> says the rabbis decreed that one cannot consider this water a spring. And that, too, <em>Rosh</em> and <em>Rav</em> explain, is why one cannot dip on top of the bench.</p>\n<p>I can't pretend to know much about <em>mikvaos</em>, but am wondering as follows. It seems that the rabbis decreed against dipping on receptacle-like things. My local <em>mikva</em> for <em>kelim</em> provides a very holey basket for people to put, e.g., cutlery in, so that they don't have to put the pieces in one at a time and so that there is less risk of dropping them to the bottom of the <em>mikva</em>. That seems to me to be a receptacle-like thing that people are dipping in. Is this a problem?

On the outset we can eliminate the possibility of \"lifnei Iver\" in this case. The problem of Lifney Iver is if you are the person that permits the Avera. <br>\n<b>Tosfoth Avoda Zara 6B</b>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מנין שלא יושיט אדם כוס יין לנזיר. נראה דה''ה בכל שאר איסורין אלא להכי נקט כוס יין לנזיר משום דמסתמא למישתי <strong>קא בעי ליה כיון דכ''ע חמרא שתו ושמא שכח נזירתו אבל ישראל שאמר הושיט לי נבלה או חזיר או שום איסור אין לחושדו מלהושיט לו אבל אם ידוע לו שרוצה לאכלו אסור להושיט לו</strong> ואפי' הוא שלו מדקאמר אי לא יהיב ליה שקיל ליה איהו ולפי זה אסור להושיט למומרים לעבודת כוכבים דבר איסור אע''פ שהוא שלהם כי הדבר ידוע שיאכלוהו והוא נאסר להם דכישראל גמור חשבינן ליה ומיירי בדקאי במקום שלא יוכל ליקח אם לא יושיט לו זה וכדמסיק דקאי בתרי עברי נהרא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Tosfoth, if the Chilul Shabboth is not a habitual action, there is no lifnei Iver. I learn from the example of Tossfoth: Handing a slice of Issur [such as non-kosher food] to a practicing Jew is not called a priori Lifney Iver.<br>The <b>Smag</b> (Lavim 168) by following the same reasoning says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והוא הדין דאסור להושיט דבר איסור למשומדים כענין זה\n  (to give a slice of Issur to a \"meshumad\" (that regarding the problem here is the equivalent of a non-practicing Jew) is prohibited due to Lifney Iver).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I guess it can happen with some of our friends. But we will look at several scenarios below with the aid of the Tosfoth in Massecheth Sabbath. Lets begin from the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p><b>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim</b> 347 Saif 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nמִן הַתּוֹרָה אֵינוֹ חַיָּב אֶלָּא כְּשֶׁעוֹקֵר חֵפֶץ מֵרְשׁוּת הַיָּחִיד וּמַנִּיחוֹ בִּרְשׁוּת הָרַבִּים, אוֹ אִיפְּכָא, אֲבָל פָּשַׁט יָדוֹ לְפָנִים, וְחֵפֶץ בְּיָדוֹ, וּנְטָלוֹ חֲבֵרוֹ הָעוֹמֵד בִּפְנִים, אוֹ שֶׁפָּשַׁט יָדוֹ לַחוּץ וְחֵפֶץ בְּיָדוֹ וּנְטָלוֹ חֲבֵרוֹ הָעוֹמֵד בַּחוּץ, שֶׁזֶּה עָקַר וְזֶה הִנִּיחַ, שְׁנֵיהֶם פְּטוּרִים אֲבָל אָסוּר לַעֲשׂוֹת כֵּן מִדְּרַבָּנָן. וְאִם פָּשַׁט יָדוֹ לְפָנִים וְחֵפֶץ בְּיָדוֹ וְהִנִּיחוֹ לְתוֹךְ יַד חֲבֵרוֹ הָעוֹמֵד בִּפְנִים, אוֹ שֶׁפָּשַׁט יָדוֹ לְפָנִים וְנָטַל חֵפֶץ מִתּוֹךְ יַד חֲבֵרוֹ הָעוֹמֵד בִּפְנִים וְהוֹצִיאוֹ לַחוּץ, שֶׁנִּמְצָא שֶׁהָעוֹמֵד בַּחוּץ לְבַדּוֹ עָקַר וְהִנִּיחַ, הוּא חַיָּב וַחֲבֵרוֹ פָּטוּר אֲבָל אָסוּר, וַאֲפִלּוּ אִם הָעוֹמֵד בַּחוּץ הוּא עַכּוּ''ם, אָסוּר מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהוּא כְּנוֹתְנוֹ עַל מְנַת לְהוֹצִיא. וְהוּא הַדִּין לְהוֹצִיא יָדוֹ לַחוּץ וְהִנִּיחוֹ בְּיַד חֲבֵרוֹ הָעוֹמֵד בַּחוּץ, אוֹ שֶׁנָּטַל מִיַּד חֲבֵרוֹ הָעוֹמֵד בַּחוּץ, וְהִכְנִיס בִּפְנִים, שֶׁהָעוֹמֵד בִּפְנִים חַיָּב שֶׁהוּא עָקַר, וְהָעוֹמֵד בַּחוּץ פָּטוּר אֲבָל אָסוּר</blockquote>\n\n<p><i>We see a case directly related to the question asked.</i>: A beggar reaches his hand inside a house, and the owner offers him a loaf of bread, which the poor man lifts and removes. Only the poor does \"Hotsaa\" but the man who is in the house also violates a ban. Which? Says the <b>Magen Avraham</b> SK 4 (his source is the first <b>Tosfot massecheth Shabbath 3A</b>): Lifne Iver. </p>\n\nLet us try to read this Tossfoth\n\n<p>It addresses several cases and several degrees of fault. Trying to present him step by step.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n\nוא''ת והא קא עבר אלפני עור לא תתן מכשול ואפילו מיירי שהיה יכול ליטלו אפילו לא היה בידו דלא עבר משום לפני עור דמושיט כוס יין לנזיר מוקי לה בפ''ק דמס' עבודת כוכבים (דף ו:) דקאי בתרי עברי דנהרא </blockquote>\n\n<p>If the poor man can lift and remove the bread only thanks to the proximity of the outstretched hand, otherwise it could not reach the interior of the house. We have the paradigmatic situation of Lifney Iver. But if the access to the house is comfortable and the poor man can take the bread without anyone's help...\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n מ''מ איסור דרבנן מיהא איכא שחייב להפרישו מאיסור \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...The owner, however, violated a rabbinic ban. This is the prohibition to hold its next remote from the prohibitions.\n<br></p>\n\n<blockquote>\nואפילו אי מיירי בנכרי דלא שייך לפני עור מיהו איסור דרבנן מיהא איכא כדתניא בשילהי פירקין (דף יט.) נותנין מזונות לנכרי בחצר נטלו ויצא אין נזקקין לו משמע דווקא כשהנכרי בחצר אבל אם עומד בחוץ ופושט ידו לפנים משמע דאסור ליתן להדיא ע''מ להוציא \n ויש לומר דמיירי בנכרי והחפץ של נכרי דאפילו מכניס ומוציא כל היום אין כאן איסור כלל כיון שאין החפץ של בעל הבית\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tossfoth deducted from a Gemara that a ban is the same when the poor man is a non-Jew, although we do not encourage to make a mistake because there is no Sabbath for him. If the object that the non-Jew moves belongs to the Jewish there is a problem. Otherwise, it's enabled (The purpose of Tossfoth is to find a case where the poor man makes hotsaa or hachnassa with the help of the owner and it is permitted lechatechilla. That is the case of the non-Jew poor man with his own object)\n<br></p>\n\n<p></p>\n\n<h2>The response: no it is not lifney Iver DeOrayta. But perhaps a problem of Leafrushey meyissura<sup>[1]</sup>.</h2>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] If you write in Motsach a message for an american friend (a Jew) that is able to open the mail  : \"@PlonyAlmoni ...\", and He see that an unread message is here, it may be a problem of leafrushe miissura.  </p>\n\n\n",

In those leap years, instead of a single day (which we add to our solar calendar), an entire month is added.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Now your question:</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Implications_for_Jewish_ritual\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">According to Wikipedia</a>, at the time when the calendar started, the earliest Passover (corresponding to the 16th year of the 19-year cycle) fell <em>on</em> the vernal equinox and Passover always fell on the first full moon following the equinox.</p>\n<p>Over the centuries, there has been a very slight seasonal drift in the calendar (the average year is just over 6.5 minutes longer than the Gregorian calendar). As a result, the calendar has shifted about 7 and a half days later relative to the equinox. But since the months themselves cannot be shifted by a full week (since the new month is tied to the new moon) the result is that in certain leap-years, the leap-month which is supposed to correct for the drift is inserted a year earlier than it should have been to actually match the equinox. This currently happens in the 8th, 11th, and 19th years of the 19-year cycle. Basically, in those years, there has been one more leap year than there actually \"should have been\" between the fourth century and today.</p>\n<p>As you mentioned, this year Passover is not on the first full moon following the vernal equinox. That is because, this year is the 19th year of the current 19-year cycle, which is one of the years where the leap-month is added \"prematurely\". At this point, there is not much concern about Passover occasionally falling out on the <em>second</em> full moon after the equinox. There is no requirement in the Torah that it fall on the first full moon. There <em>is</em>, however, a requirement that Passover must fall in the Spring (it is called the Spring Festival). If the current calendar were to be followed indefinitely, Passover <em>would</em> eventually fall in the summer due to continued seasonal drift. This would be problematic, but it is not of immediate concern because it would take <em>millenia</em> for this to happen. The hope is that the <em>messiah</em> will come well before then and re-introduce the court-based institution of the months and leap years.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Some bonus information:</h2>\n<p>You may have noticed that I mentioned that our current calendar was instituted in the fourth century. Of course, the time period that Christians are interested in occurred <em>before</em> this time. Prior to the establishment of the fixed (calculated) calendar, the leap years were determined by the courts. The main factors that the courts took into account was the relationship between Passover and the equinox. They needed to make sure that Passover always fell after the vernal equinox.  In addition, however, they could consider other factors that affected the ability of the people living throughout Israel to properly observe the <em>Pesach</em> festival. If the winter rains had destroyed the roads and bridges (which would prevent people from far away from making the festival pilgrimage) or they had destroyed the ovens for roasting the paschal sacrifice, the courts could institute a leap year in order to allow an extra month for the roads and ovens to be fixed before the festival (see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/947921/jewish/Kiddush-HaChodesh-Chapter-Four.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam - Mishneh Torah, Kiddush HaChodesh, Chapter 4, Halakha 5</a>).</p>\n<p>In a year which was declared a leap-year for one of those reasons, it is entirely likely that such an additional month would push Passover to the second full moon following the equinox. So even before the set calendar and seasonal drift, it was possible for Passover to fall out not on the first full moon. I am not aware of how often this happened (if it ever actually happened at all), but it is most likely (in my opinion) that Passover <em>did</em> occur in the first full moon following the equinox (as it does in most years now and probably in almost all years back then) in the year Christians believe Jesus was killed .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Spring Equinox this year is March 2o, 2018. The first new moon after that is April 15-16 (depending on witnesses observations). The first full moon would be 2 weeks later, April 29-30, marking the start of the actual Passover this year IF one follows Torah's instructions. There is already a Sanhedrin in Israel that correctly declared the full moon last year yet we apparently are ignoring their declarations and choosing instead to continue to follow Hillel's fixed (and thus convenient) calendar. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -8)\n\n<p>Most likely it is not correct assumption, because one of the theories about Hebrew calendar states that 15th is always a Shabbat, which will put Passover roughly right after equinox. But I checked, and in such system Passover would not always be the first Shabbat right after equinox, but very close, most likely second. So if Christian messiah was operating on a Lunar Shabbat calendar, this may be correct way to determine the Passover. As far as I can tell, Holy Meetings such as Passover are not tied to the astronomic events such as equinox, but they do happen during equinox/solstice times. This is probably to avoid worshiping the sun. So, the answer to OP would be maybe but probably not.</p>\n\n\n",

Christians had to justify Jesus's death, so they wrote that for the sin of Adam and Eve, G-d punished all of humanity to bear children with pain and produce food \"the sweat of their brows.\"</p>\n<p>Maimonides disagreed. Maimonides understood the \"Garden of Eden\" story to be a parable. The ultimate goal of humanity, according to the Rambam, is to develop the intellect. Thus Maimonides distinguished “truth and falsehood” from “good and bad.\" For example, when Adam ate of the tree of good and evil he recognized his nakedness was a bad but he did not know truth from falsehood (Menachem Kellner). Thus Maimonides saw the parable as teaching intelligent people to live their lives based on reality, on what is true and false. Or, to look at it from another perspective, there is a parable (Talmud, Yoma 69b) where the יצר הרע yetzer hara is captured for a few days. When the rabbis note that no one engages in business, not even a single egg is laid, they conclude that the evil inclination can be used to do good. That the evil inclination is a “necessary evil.”</p>\n<p>The moral of the story is that if everything was given to us for free society would become boring. Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote that when people have things too good they will take a hammer to a window. It is easy to be lazy in the garden where everything is provided. It is much harder to work with \"the sweat of their brows,\" but that is freedom.</p>\n<p>Thus, Genesis, which is at the beginning of the Torah, teaches that to be successful, people need to work hard with \"the sweat of their brows.\" Nothing comes easy. Adam and Eve learn this lession from the tree of good and evil. It seems that from here that it was not really a punishment at all. Rather, our ability to choose between right from wrong, to exercise our free will as G-d intended, is a gift, not a curse, from Adam and Eve.</p>\n\n\n",

R Moshe Feinstein (YD 1:47-49) held that, in countries with highly-regulated milk production (e.g., by the Food and Drug Administration in the US), our knowledge of this fact is the <em>halachic</em> equivalent of a <em>mashgiach</em> witnessing the milking (based on the <em>halachic</em> axiom of <em>anan sahadei</em> – that firm knowledge of something is equal to witnessing it) and the milk is therefore kosher</li>\n<li><strong><em>chalav akum</em></strong>: unsupervised milk with no certainty it is coming from kosher animals.

For he said: He who is twenty years of age and is not married spends all his days in sin. ‘In sin’ — can you really think so? — But say, spends all his days in sinful thoughts.

He writes in Hilchot Ishut (15: 2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האיש מצווה על פריה ורביה אבל לא האשה, ומאימתי האיש נתחייב במצוה זו מבן שבע עשרה, וכיון שעברו עשרים שנה ולא נשא אשה הרי זה עובר ומבטל מצות עשה, ואם היה עוסק בתורה וטרוד בה והיה מתירא מלישא אשה כדי שלא יטרח במזונות ויבטל מן התורה הרי זה מותר להתאחר, שהעוסק במצוה פטור מן המצוה וכל שכן בתלמוד תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, HaNesher HaGadol Rabbenu Yitzchak Abarbanel praises those who like our Patriarch Yitzchak postpone marriage, in his commentary to Genesis (25):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>כי הנה עם היות שארז\"ל בן י\"ח לחופה לא אמרו זה אלא להודיע כי בהיותו בן י\"ח שנה כבר הוא בעל כח ראוי להוליד בנים אבל לא אמרו שאז יקח אדם אשה</strong>. כי הנה האשה כשיקחה אדם בבחרותו תטה את לבבו ותכניעהו יותר מדאי צא ולמד משמשון עם נשיו שהנה היו בעוכריו ומשלמה כי נשיו הטו את לבבו ולמה נבקש עוד והנה אבינו הראשון אמר האשה אשר נתת עמדי היא נתנה לי מן העץ ואוכל ולכן אמר ראש החכמי' בחכמתו (קהלת ז' כ\"ו) ומוצא אני מר ממות את האשה אשר היא מצודים וחרמי' לבה אסורים ידיה טוב לפני האלדים ימלט ממנה וחוטא ילכד בה ולהיות לקיחת אשה סכנה עצומה צריך סיוע אלדי והתישבות השכל ותבונה רבה להמלט ממוקשיה וכבר אר\"זל שלכן אמר הכתוב מי האיש אשר בנה בית ומי האיש אשר נטע כרם ומי האיש אשר ארש אשה לפי שראוי לאד' שראשונה יתעסק בקנין הבית ובנינו ואחר כך בנטיעת הכרם ובאחרונה בלקיחת האשה <strong>הנה מפני זה נתעכב יצחק מלקחת אשה עד ארבעים שנה כדי שיעבור תגבורת הבחרות ותכבה רתיחת דם הנערות ותאות המשגל ויהיה אז החומר היוצא להולדה יותר מוכן לקבל צורה שלימה וכבר אמרו חז\"ל שעשו עשה כזה לקחת אשה בן ארבעים שנה להראות עצמו כשר</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A similar view emerges from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_Moses_ben_Maimon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbenu Avraham ben HaRambam</a>'s <em>Hamaspik L'Ovdey Hashem</em>. He writes that observance of basic halacha trumps pietistic practices such as fasting. The former are supposed to supplement the latter; not the other way around. One of his examples of a pietistic practice is avoiding marriage (chapter one: page 17 of Wincelberg translation).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Wincelberg explains that Rabbenu Avraham does not mean never marrying, but rather postponing marriage by many years; a practiced endorsed by his son Rabbenu Ovadyah (cited there).</p>\n\n<p>See also chapter 10, (page 369 of Wincelberg translation) where he praises significantly postponing marriage.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly he holds that one need not marry by 24, and one may marry later.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashba</a>  was asked about a person who swore not to marry until a certain age. Does this constitute an oath to violate a mitzvah? He answers (Responsa 4:91) that it does not, as he can simply marry later. (See there where he contrasts the mitzvah of marriage, with a time-bound mitzvah like circumcision):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תשובה: שבוע' היא חלה, שאין זה, נשבע לבטל את המצוה. דאפשר לקיים זה וזה. ולא זו בלבד, שאין זמנה בהול, אלא אפילו במצוה שזמנה בהול, כמילה וכו...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They seem to have either held that the Gemara in Kisddushin does not reflect the normative view, or more likely understood the Gemara as not teaching inviolable halachic parameters of a mitzvah, but rather providing general guidance. Like all guidance, it varies with the particular circumstances of the individual.</p>\n\n<p>There may be those who disagree, however, including Rambam, (although as noted in the footnote, his position is far from clear.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><code>1</code> The same way Chazal give guidelines for example about the optimal number of children in a classroom; this <em>shiur</em> which advises the best way to conduct oneself obviously bears no resemblance to the <em>shiur</em> of a kezayit.</p>\n\n<p><code>2</code> One wonders however, how an actual mitzvah incumbent on a person could be superseded by Torah study, which is itself universally superseded by all mitzvot as stated in Hilchot Talmud Torah (3: 4). A question that the commentators have been bothered by. If he holds like his son that the ages mentioned in the Talmud are suggestions rather than discrete obligations, then this question is resolved. Note also Rambam in his introduction to the Mishna where he writes that a court would not force a person to marry. Rather marriage is based on personal choice.  לפי שהנשואין תלוים ברצון האדם, ואין לבית דין לכוף את האדם להתחתן</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Kedushin 29-30a brings various opinions what the latest age to marry is.

According to the Ramban, this commandment means not to be \"disgusting with the Torah's permission\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<strong>Ironically</strong>, this is the same Igros Moshe who said that smoking is not forbidden.) Another answer said the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Reb Moshe answers <strong>NO you may not smoke marijuana</strong>.

But there is a problem:</p>\n\n<p>Many hold that the events of Ki Tisa come before Terumah-Tetzaveh (most famously the Rambam), but what sin had Moshe committed at the point Tetzaveh occurred to lead to his omission there?</p>\n\n<p>Later in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">34:1</a>:</p>\n\n<p>וְכָתַבְתִּי֙ עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֔ת אֶת־הַדְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָי֛וּ עַל־הַלֻּחֹ֥ת הָרִאשֹׁנִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר שִׁבַּֽרְתָּ - And <strong><em>I</em></strong> will write on the tablets the the things/words that were on the first tablets <strong><em>which you broke.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>and the commentary in Yevamos 62a on this:</p>\n\n<p>והסכימה דעתו לדעת המקום דכתיב (שמות לד, א) אשר שברת ואמר ריש לקיש אמר ליה הקב\"ה למשה יישר כחך ששברת - And his knowledge agreed with the knowledge of the Omnipresent, as it says \"which you broke\" - Reish Lakeish says Hashem said to him [Moshe] Your strength was true that you broke them (i.e.: you did the correct thing).</p>\n\n<p>But this is not the only action Moshe took in response to the Golden Calf - he also encouraged the wholesale extra-judicial killing of anyone associated with the Golden Calf, something that seems entirely outside the bounds of halacha. We do not see Hashem approve of this action.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a source that discusses the possibility of Hashem subtly censuring Moshe for encouraging the tribe of Levi to kill without a proper hearing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You say that the killing of anyone associated with the Golden Calf  was extra-judicial and we do not see Hashem approve of this action.

Whereupon a Heavenly Voice cried out: 'Why do ye dispute with R`Eliezer, seeing that in all matters the halachah agrees with him!' But R`Joshua arose and exclaimed: 'It is not in heaven.' What did he mean by this? - Said R`Jeremiah: That <b>the Torah had already been given at Mount Sinai</b>; we pay no attention to a Heavenly Voice<sup>[2]</sup>, because Thou hast long since written in the Torah at Mount Sinai, After the majority must one incline. \n(Soncino's traduction.)\nR`Nathan met Elijah and asked him: What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do in that hour? - He laughed [with joy], he replied, saying, 'My sons have defeated Me, My sons have defeated Me.'\n</blockquote>\nThis passage is cited in the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20701&st=&pgnum=28\" rel=\"nofollow\">disputation of Rabbi Yehiel MiParis)</a> (The Catholic priest accused the Talmud to be heretical, as one could see that the sages refused to bow to god. <b>Following the majority, when one generation decides that it is pure, Hakadosh Baruch Hu agrees, and when in the next generation the majority decide that it is not pure, Hakadosh Baruch Hu agrees too</b>.<h3>So what you call \"prophecy\", that is to say the <i>absolute</i> knowledge, does not compete at the Beth Din because the absolute knowledge is already given in Sinai\n<br>\nAfter the decision of the majority, nothing and nobody can change the Halacha.\n</h3></li></ol>\n\n<p>I hope to have time to complete this answer and add references</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] There is a notion sealed in Halacha, Hatimath HaTalmud (see letter of Rav Shrira Gaon), later we see that there is a notion of Har Sinai.

    "content": "# Could this passage have any relevance to artificial intelligence?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen numerous different discussions online about how to handle artificial intelligence with regards to moral laws. How should we, as orthodox Jews, dispatch of these problems? I turn to this law for guidance,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Exodus 21:28 <em>\"When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable.\"</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The way I read that needn't be specific to an ox. An ox is just one being with agency. Here the law calls for immunity for the owner of the ox, and the stoning of the ox (the subject of the crime). No punishment is dealt to the parental oxens or the species. In the case where a machine injures another, should we turn to Exodus 21:28? If we did, we would grant immunity to the owners and creators of the machine and stone the machine? This may be more difficult to contend with if we have to punish The Cloud, but given enough time and stones I don't believe it's impossible.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://biblehub.com/esv/exodus/21.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">full context of this can be found here,</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>28 “When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten, but the owner of the ox shall not be liable. 29 But if the ox has been accustomed to gore in the past, and its owner has been warned but has not kept it in, and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned, and its owner also shall be put to death. 30 If a ransom is imposed on him, then he shall give for the redemption of his life whatever is imposed on him. 31 If it gores a man’s son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule. 32 If the ox gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master thirty shekelse of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another fellow Jew commented on the relevance of Exodus 21:29. I believe it is also applicable however to a much lesser degree. Exodus 21:29 requires</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>A pattern of goring in the past. For our analogy, this would mean a habitually malicious AI.</li>\n<li>Its owner has been warned. This seems totally reasonable. I imagine a lot of AI owners will be warned, and have this criteria satisfied.</li>\n<li>The failure of the ox to be kept in. I read this to mean the owner having reacted to the warning to mitigate future harm. It seems unlikely that an owner of a malicious AI will be so negligent as to ignore warnings.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Talmudic tractate called Bava Kamma, in many places, discusses the meaning of the various \"damagers\" mentioned in the Torah for various liabilities. The first page of Bava Kamma, explains that the \"ox\" as a damager, by Torah Law, is something that must be described as containing \"Ru-ach Chaim\" (a living soul).</p>\n\n<p>An animal which has a living soul of its own, is categorically unpredictable to a great extent. A computer driven Artificial Intelligence, is more predictable than an ox, in so far as it is programmed by humans via logical machine language.</p>\n\n<p>This is one reason why an ox pays \"half damages\" (the first 3 times it gores) according to the Torah. The very fact that an ox's actions are directed by its own soul, would lend us to exempt its owner from any and all liability! However, the Torah revealed a novel idea, that the owner, who is responsible to the public to watch his animal, should at least pay half. A programmed booby trap, however, (AI) would be much more controlable. Its program would also be known. Therefore, it should fit into categories of damage (like pit and fire), which are more mechanical, and pay full damages; or the category of \"Adam HaMazik\" (man), when a human being is controlling its moves directly. Finally, it may fall under the category of indirect damage like \"gramma\" and cause its owner to pay nothing, because we don't suspect we should guard it well, or the damage is so indirect in relation to the owner, that the Torah does not require Bes Din to pursue the damage in court.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, one should look at Yalkhut Shimoni (Ve’eschanan 837)(and similarly in Shir HaShirim Rabbah). \"...Now even if all the inhabitants of the world were to gather together with the intention of creating even one gnat, they would not be able to create it and infuse it with a soul.\"</p>\n\n<p>Whatever the category an AI would be part of, it would never be called something with a real soul, as per the Medrash. Therefore, any legal comparison between a goring ox and a \"sentient AI\" falls short from a Torah perspective.</p>\n\n\n",

If after those two ounces I want another two, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch writes that I make a new <em>mezonos</em> (as my first bracha didn't have this in mind; but not a hamotzee as I'm only now sitting down to two ounces), eat those two, then say <em>birkas hamazon</em> as I've now eaten four.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Your question assumed that pizza follows the status of \"snacky-bread\", which is a very common opinion, though hardly the only one. (DoubleAA quoted the opinion of Rabbi Welcher and others that pizza is automatically \"real bread\" every time.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The definition of bread following the Halacha is a little different from the definition in litteral common language. According to the Halacha, to call (I mean to call lechem by Bracha Rishona) some food 'bread' refers to the function of this meal. In many verse (and also in philosophical language) bread is the pittance, livelihood, daily bread. The spouse of a man is sometimes called 'bread' (concerning Potifar \"כי אם הלחם אשר הוא אוכל\"). The <strong>main food</strong> is called bread. A food that has both features 1.- to be able to be the main course 2.- and to be perfectly suited for this, is called \"lechem\". It is worthy of bircath \"hamotzi\". A main course meet specific definition. In Mishna, Tanaym talk about this, regarding the Beracha Acharona (3 Berachoth / Meein 3). In the historical background in which Chachamim developed the Halakha, human feed is mainly made up of wheat and water. We kneaded and baked  dough.<br>.In Italy, one of these forms is the Pizza (Note that in the geographic area of Rome, the pizza name also applies to the Focaccia which is composed only of dough bread oil and salt)<br>.\nBut some Kosher pizzas have the mention that the dough was knead with juice, and/or that the Blessing is Mezonot \"ברכתו מזונות\" (Mezonoth). This hilchatic character \nwill disappear if we decide to eat this pizza as our main course. Main course is something that we can not really attribute to any food. \n<strong>The original question is about a Pizza that we consider as \"pat habaa  bekissanin\"</strong> (because it is knead with juice and the taste of the juice is very noticeable or because it is baked with a coating which makes it a little different from bread<sup>[1]</sup>.). When the consumer decided to eat it as a real meal, it comes back to be bread, when it is eaten provides in a sufficient quantity as a normal meal <sup>[2]</sup>. </p>\n\n<h2>Bracha rishona: Hamotzi; Bracha Acharona: Bircath Hamazon</h2>\n\n<p>.<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x977\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 168, 6</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[1] It is generally not considered the case in pizza because the ingredients that garnish the dough are those with witch one eat bread during meals <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x981\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 168, 17,Magen Avraham</a><br></p>\n\n<p>[2] A big meal (Shaar Hatsiun 19) following the Shibolei Haleket (a quote from the Shibole Haleket. \"ופירוש סעודת קבע השיב רבי אביגדור כהן צדק זצ\"ל לרבי בנימין אחי נר\"ו כי קביעת סעודה האמורה בכובא דארעא ולחמניות ופת הבאה בכיסנין הוא סעודת הבוקר והערב\").<br>\nI was previously thought that we could understand the statement Shiboley Haleket as a Chumra  (that is to say that the time fixed for the bi-quotidian meal gives the Keva's connotation even if the meal is smaller than 4 Beitsim) but Acharonim clearly understand it as a Kula, for Hamotsi and BHM we need a great amount (a voluminous meal such as lunch or dinner is also needed for Birkath Hamazon).</p>\n\n\n",

Does Jewish legend support the conjecture that they were Zoroastrian?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Short answer:</p>\n<p>\"Jewish sources\" do not come right out and specifically state which exact religion Ahasuerus and Haman followed. However, we can read the Jewish sources, and secular historical sources, (archeology, ancient texts, modern scholarship) to try to find the best answer <em><strong>implied</strong></em> by the Jewish sources. Dr. Chaim S. Heifetz, a modern day Orthodox Jewish scholar, who has spent many years studying these sources, (both Jewish and secular), <a href=\"http://www.herzog.ac.il/vtc/tvunot/mega14_hefetz.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proposes</a> this answer:</p>\n<p>Ahasuerus and Haman, were both (most likely) Zurvan-type (idolatrous) Zoroastrians. Specifically, they would have been followers of the cult of Mithra, as promoted by the Magi (a priestly class of the Medes). This would be as opposed to Cyrus the great and Darius I (for instance) who (most likely) followed a monotheistic form of Zoroastrianism.</p>\n<p>Longer answer:</p>\n<p>First, we need to understand a brief explanation of the difference between a Zurvan vs. monotheistic, Zoroastrian.</p>\n<p>Zoroaster (or Zarathustra), who founded this Persian religion, taught a monotheistic concept. Ahura Mazda , was the one and only God of light who created everything. Humanity was to use free choice to constantly battle the temptation of being evil. This would uplift humanity, until the final battle of good vs. evil and the resurrection of the dead with the coming of Messiah. Individuals would also be judged to enter heaven or hell based on the majority of their thoughts and deeds while alive.</p>\n<p>The evil spirit was called Ahriman. It was not a god, but rather an emanation set up by Ahura Mazda. This is similar to a Jewish Satan. or Yetzer Hara. Mithra, is mentioned in the Avesta (Zoro-A holy writ) as merely an emanation of an attribute of God.</p>\n<p>This version of belief has not been pinpointed to a certain year, but is usually attributed to approx. the 6th century BCE (also, as far back as the 10th - 12th century BCE). In this version, evil is merely a test supplied by Ahura Mazda, so man can improve. Judaism would find this general belief to be very acceptable (as far as gentile religion goes). One can see the obvious parallels within Judaism.</p>\n<p>However, Persia and Media became established by migration from India. Those peoples were followers of the Hindu Vedas. They had many gods and one of the main ones was Mithra. The Medes and common people led by the Magi priests, continued the old idolatrous ways. When Zoroaster made reforms, many people still needed to mix pure monotheism with idolatry. One version of Zoroastrianism was Zurvanism. Zurvan, was the neutral god of time. He created Ahura Mazda (good god) and Ahriman (evil god) as twin brothers. They fight throughout history. This kind of dualism is idolatry, and appealed more to the masses that followed the Magi and Mithra. (Later, Sassanid Persian royalty, followed Zurvanism, complete with priests (Chavarim) of the fire worship cult which had its source with the Medes.)</p>\n<p>A follower of this kind of Zoro-A, could be happy with sacrificing to different gods. Kings could be incarnations of gods or at least high priests of certain gods like Mithra.</p>\n<p><strong>JEWISH SOURCES:</strong></p>\n<p>Seder Olam, informs us that the Jewish chronology recognizes only four Persian kings. They are Darius I the Mede, Cyrus (the Great), Ahaseurus (of Esther), and Darius I of Persia.</p>\n<p>Isaiah 45, mentions the Persian Cyrus, as being the Messiah of G-d. In Ezra 1, Cyrus authorizes the Jews to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the temple. Cyrus is quoted as referring to the \"G-d of heaven\". Darius I of Persia, who takes over after Ahaseurus, (and may be the son of Esther) orders the temple to be built once again, and renews the decrees of Cyrus, in favor of the Jews.</p>\n<p>Ahaseurus, is discussed by Seder Olam, Esther Rabbah, and the Gemara in Megillah. He is identified with a reversal of Cyrus' order to rebuild the temple. He profanes the temple vessels at his party, and dons the stolen high priest's vestments. Described as an unfit usurper to the throne, his party is explained by the sages as solidifying his reign after the first 2 years of dealing with rebellion. Interestingly, the Jewish temple's ruin means so much to him, that whenever he offers his queen (who he doesn't even know is Jewish) something, he offers her anything she wants: \"until half the kingdom\". The sages explain this to mean: \"but don't ask me to allow the Jewish temple to be rebuilt!.\"</p>\n<p>Haman, is described as wearing an idol around his neck, and wanting to be worshiped as a god. The king raises Haman up as the highest man in the realm and makes a special decree that everyone bow to him. Also, Haman slanders the Jews to Ahaseurus by saying that \"If a fly falls into a Jew's wine, he removes the fly and drinks the wine...but if your majesty touches their cup, they throw it out!\"</p>\n<p>This slander is strange. The Talmud in Chulin (4b) explains that only if wine was offered to an idol, would a Jew not be able to drink it. The decree of \"stam yenam\" (that the mere touching of the wine renders it prohibited) was not decreed until the times right after Hillel and Shammai. This was hundreds of years after Esther. Where did Haman get this? Tosfos answer (in general, to the Gemara referring to Ahab, but I will apply it equally to Haman): that if a gentile is known to be a priest of an idol, then anything he slaughters (I assume wine touched is included) is considered automatically idolatry, and is prohibited. If Haman and Ahaseurus were incarnations of gods, or priests of Mithra, then it makes sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Dr. Heifetz's Theory:</strong></p>\n<p>Dr. Cheifetz interprets these sources to tell us that Cyrus and Darius I of Persia were monotheistic Zoroastrians, while Ahaseurus and Haman were idol worshipping Zoroastrians.</p>\n<p>Cyrus started his success by believing in strict monotheism. Eventually, he understood the prophecy in Isaiah to be supportive of him, and made friends with the Jews. Ahaseurus, rose up against the rule of Cyrus, and took away the throne. In order to fully control the people, he needed to sway them away from the religion of Cyrus, and go back to the roots of idolatry among them. If he could make a new state religion and convince the people, he could blot out the legacy of Cyrus who he usurped. From now on, everything about Jews, monotheism, and the temple, were anti-Ahaseurus. He even married a woman from the old idolatrous royal house of Babylon and used the temple vessels. Elevating Haman, and having people deify him, was what a king would do to sway the people back to Mithra worship and following the chief Magus (Haman?). The Jewish leader Mordechai, not bowing, was indicative, that the Jews would stand in the way of religious reform, and needed to be removed.</p>\n<p>Dr. Cheifetz also claims that a Magi usurper, overthrows the capital, after the death of Ahaseurus. This man is named Guamata in some sources. Other sources call him Hamedatha; which is the name of Haman's father! This man is soon killed. Later temples of Mithra, encouraged worship of two gods not mentioned in the past: Omanos and Anadatos. Strabo writes about them being worshiped in his city in the 1st century CE. Dr. Cheifetz feels these are corruptions of Haman and Hamedatha, two martyrs of the Mithra mystery religion.</p>\n<p>Here is a link to an article written by Dr. Cheifetz's student Brad Aaronson (posted by Lisa (Aaronson) Liel on her website) which touches on some of these points. It was once printed in 1991, in the Jewish Action magazine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.starways.net/lisa/essays/heifetzfix.html#note2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.starways.net/lisa/essays/heifetzfix.html#note2</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Jewish tradition is pretty mum on the subject, as far as I've heard.

Not really our concern, in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Zoroastrianism is very clearly referenced a few centuries later, in the Talmud. (E.g. conversations about when it would be dangerous to have Sabbath candles lit \"as the local non-Jewish population allows fires only in their temples on certain days\"; the intentional rewording from Isaiah to the prayer books of \"God who makes peace and creates evil\" to \"who makes peace and creates everything\"; and the disqualification of a cantor whose prayer language implies there are separate gods for good and evil.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The Chavarim mentioned in the Gemara are most likely the Zoroastrians.

If so, how does <em>Rambam</em> (and <em>Targum</em> Pseudo-Jonathan) read the verses to support this interpretation?

As such, one could suggest that once an idea/words are separated from their speaker, it is akin to their being exiled from him/her. Thus by ascribing them appropriately, you've redeemed and returned them to their rightful place, restoring an order of sorts.</p>\n\n<p>See, e.g., the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohr_Chadash.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal's Ohr Chadash</a> (cited below by Haleivi, as noted by Isaac Moses in a comment):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כאשר אמר דבר בשם אמרו הרי אדם זה מוציא הדבר שהיא תחת ידו ומחזירו אל אשר ראוי לו ובא ממנו וזה נחשב כמו גאולה לדבר כאשר מוציא הענין שהוא בידו ומחזיר אותו אל מי שבא ממנו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Chazal</em> are referencing Esther to show that there is a <em>midda knegged midda</em>, and, like begetting like, a small <em>geulah</em> can snowball.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, it is perhaps also relevant that the first sin is midrashically rooted in the false ascription to G-d not to even touch the Tree of Knowledge, as well as that Bar Kamtza also falsely ascribed intentions to the Jewish people. Both acts resulted in exile. </p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, see also Yalkut Shimoni Mishlei Ch. 6: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והאומר דבר בשם מי שלא אמרו שהוא מביא קללה לעולם</p>\n  \n  <p>And one who says something in the name of one who did not say it, that he brings a curse to the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this sense, קללה (curse) may be associated to the concept of imbalance and a world out of sorts, i.e. גלות (exile), whereas ברכה (blessing) indicates peace, harmony, and balance, with everything in its proper place, i.e. גאולה (redemption).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The Maharal in <a href=\"http://mobile.tora.ws/index.html?bgf=lnn%2815301,80,0%29\">Or Chadash on Megilas Esther</a> explains that Hashem performs miracles in order to create a Kiddush Hashem. However, if the person involved in the rescue will take the credit then there is no Kiddush Hashem generated from this salvation, and it is therefore aborted. But, one who gives credit to whom it is due will surely make it known that it was a miracle and not his own might. Thus, this person brings redemption.</p>\n\n<p>Another explanation given by the Maharal is that when you have someone else's idea in your hands, it is held captive by you. If you decide to claim the credit it will remain forever bound in misattribution. When you reunite the idea with its origin you are redeeming the idea. This person is a right candidate for bringing about redemption.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><em>Tora T'mima</em> to <em>Ester</em> 2:22 (note 44) explains that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the intent is obvious: From anything said in the name of its sayer, it's possible that over time some honorable matter will come about that one cannot foresee or assess ahead of time.

The idea being to avoid drawing the evil eye from others, by which I'm referring to Artscroll's Talmud's explanation: a negative spiritual force that can arise as a result of causing jealousy in others, leading to the Heavenly Court questioning anew someone's aptitude for receiving a bracha. </p>\n\n<p>I have a few questions about that:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>When does the 'first trimester' start, in this regard? Modern medicine counts the start from the first day of the last period before a woman conceived. (Which seems weird - saying someone's pregnant during a time when they were on their period. Any doctors who want to elaborate?) If you count one trimester from that date, you get a date about two weeks earlier than if you count from the mikveh night following the last period. </li>\n<li>Also, is 'one trimester' 12 weeks? 90 days? From the date a woman becomes pregnant (e.g. 15 Nisan) to the same date three calendar months later? Something else? </li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The last <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lubavitcher rebbe</a> quoted in many personal correspondences, in the name of his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Yitzchak_Schneersohn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">father in-law</a>, that a woman should not reveal her pregnancy until the fifth month, except to her doctors, and it is also fine to reveal to relatives or close friends.

Are there any types of crafts to do with the children that are within the limits of Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>Any ideas of appropriate activities would be greatly appreciated - we have 10-20 school aged children (5-12 years old)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Shabbos laws can be very complicated and many activities that might seem innocent enough superficially can be potentially problematic, at a Rabbinic (<em>d'rabanan</em>), or even at a biblical level (<em>d'orayta</em>), which is why it is important to discuss potential activites first with a competent halachic authority. That said, there are e.g. prohibitions on creating letters, images, or certain structures, all of which can become more severe as the permanence of the creations increase. Many games that do not involve writing, drawing, or measuring, can be fine, though often even these can have potential issues. Most crafts would be a problem inasmuch as something is typically created at a more permanent level (i.e. to be brought home). Depending on the particular community and needs of the children, a competent rabbi may have leniencies for some activities that might be prohibited otherwise.</p>\n\n<p>Chabad.org offers some suggestions <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/1508934/jewish/Shabbat-Games.htm\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shemirah Shabbath by Rav Yehoshua Neuwirth discusses games and toys in Chapter 16.

Rather if the children are playing with them, the adults are not required to stop the children. See quotes below.</p>\n<p>Therefore, it would be inappropriate to lead children in a formal group.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(18) a. One need not  stop children from playing with ordinary toy building blocks or interconnecting blocks of any kind, unless they have to be screwed together or very tightly fixed together, in which case they may not be used.</p>\n<p>(30)  although adults should not blow soap bubbles, one need not stop children from doing so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Throughout  The chapter he mentions other examples which are fully forbidden. For example,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(4) a. One need not prevent children from playing with sand, provided the sand is of a fine consistency is dry and was prepared for this use before Shabbos as in a sandbox. [But] b. Is not permitted to mix the sand with water or to pour water over it, as this contravenes the prohibition against kneading.</p>\n<p>(13) it is forbidden a. to shape models out of plasticine, Clay, wax or the like and b. To pour plaster into any kind of mold.</p>\n<p>(19) one should not make boats, hats or other objects by folding paper.</p>\n<p>(20)  it is not permitted to assemble or dismantle a toy from a model making kit, such as a model airplane or ship made from plastic, metal or wooden parts, as the parts join together with a great deal of precision and they are normally built with the intention of leaving them assembled for a considerable time.</p>\n<p>(28) All games involving cutting or sticking,  whether with glue or with adhesive tape are prohibited.</p>\n<p>(36) Plaiting or weaving together threads, strands or strips of plastic or other material is prohibited one Shabbos and YomTov.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the chapter he suggests various games, such as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(5) arbles, only on floors not bare earth or ground outside.</p>\n<p>(6) Table tennis or ball games inside or out with an Eruv but not on ground, only on hard surfaces;</p>\n<p>(11) Playing \"5 avanim\" (an Israeli game normally played with a set of five blocks but could be played with stones, as long as the stones were set aside for the game before Shabbos or YomTov .)</p>\n<p>(23) One is allowed to play games in which letters, or parts of letters or of a picture, are placed side-by-side so as to make up a whole word or picture provided that this does not involve setting the word or picture in a frame that holds it together and the various sections are not interlocked and fixed together as most jigsaw puzzles.</p>\n<p>(16) Playing with a game consisting of (usually) 15 movable letters or numbered squares set in a framed board the size of 16 such squares and rearranging the squares by moving them about within the board, is permissible on Shabbos and YomTov.</p>\n<p>(33) Dice Games, for example \"Chutes and Ladders\" are permitted, so long, of course, as they do not involve any for bidden activity.</p>\n<p>(34) a. Games  like chess, Dominos and \"Fish\" (a card game in which for cards are dealt to each player and have to be made into sets) are allowed.</p>\n<p>b. However care should be taken when play has ended not to separate the pieces or cards by color or type as this contravenes the prohibition against selection.</p>\n<p>c.

However, most American Jewish schools, either Modern Orthodox day schools or more Yeshivish/Chareidi batei midrash fall into a thoroughly Eastern European approach, as far as the Ashkenazi schools go. </p>\n\n<p>This creates a neat conundrum: the children will be learning a separate set of minhagim and a different pronunciation than what a proper Jecke should use and home instruction might merely confuse the ketanim further, unless properly done.</p>\n\n<p>While I have met some folks who have learned a separate minhag from their schools (eg. Chabadniks sending their kids to Litvish yeshivot, but teaching them Chabad nusach/minhagim) I have no knowledge of how to approach this, even though I study at one of the <a href=\"http://Lesley.edu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">foremost universities in the American educational world</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Are there any works, practices, or other materials on how teaching children their family traditions (<em>et c.</em>) could be approached?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When I was learning in yeshiva, I came home for Pesach and saw a homework sheet that Rabbi Moshe  Juravel, a seasoned Mechanech in Baltimore (who studied in Lakewood) had sent home with my second grader brother.\nHe had asked each child to ask his father what HIS Minhag was for Karpas. I was so impressed with that simple idea! It brought back a memory from my elementary school.\nWhen I began in day school, in third or fourth grade, (I had the same Rebbe in both) my Rebbe announced that his friend, a Rabbi from Israel, was coming from Israel to speak to us. This was big news as very few people could travel to or from Eretz Yisrael in the early 60's. When he came to our classroom, after his speech, the rebbe asked him \"Would you like a drink of water?\" He said, \"yes.\" The rebbe handed him a glass, the Rabbi said, \"Burich atuw ...Eloy-kynee meilech Hu-oylam...\"\nWhen he finished, everyone answered \"Amein\" while I thought \"my father knows how to read Hebrew! I don't understand why\"(because I learned the American pronunciation) \"but if Rebbe's friend speaks that way, then it must be ok!\"</p>\n\n<p>When I became a Rebbe, especially when I had a class from many different groups, Ashkenaz, Sephard, Chabad, Jecke, Israeli and  Teiman, I tried to bring up such differences. (Of course I asked the question about Karpas!) </p>\n\n<p>I also made a \"Gadol of the Month\" from the last 150 years except Tishrei. I picked those that had a Yahrzeit in the month. And then gave a picture [except for Gedalyah Ben Achikam and R Yisroel Salanter, who has no known picture] and gave a quick biography, descriptions of sefarim or important topics they stressed, especially those that have relevance to the kids (because of their parents, their teachers or their community, or other things they are aware of should be.</p>\n\n<p>FYI:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>24 Elul: The Chaferz Chaim; Radin, Poland: Shmiras haLashon & Mishneh Brurah</li>\n<li>3 Tishrei: Gedalyah Ben Achikam</li>\n<li>7 Cheshvan Rav Meir Shapira (Polishe Chassidis); Daf Yomi; Askan (member of Polish Parliament); Rosh Yeshiva of Chachmei Lublin.</li>\n<li>2 Kislev: R' Aharon Kotler: Torah Lishmah </li>\n<li>27 Teves: R' Samson R. Hirsch, Frankfurt: 19 Letters, Horeb, The Pentateuch; Torah im Derech Eretz; established separate Orthodox Community in Frankfurt, Germany</li>\n<li>11 Shevat: R' Yosef Yitzchak Schneerson (the \"Frierdickeh Lubavitcher Rebbe\") re-establishing Chassidus on American shores; \"America is 'nisht anderesht'!\" (Not different)</li>\n<li>25 Shevat: R' Yisroel Lipkin (Salanter): Mussar; thinking about our actions; esp <em>bein Adam LaChaveiro</em>.</li>\n<li>27 Adar 1: Sarah Schenirer, started the idea of formal Chinuch for Girls in Lithuania, Poland etc, without which Judaism was dying in Europe; Bais Yaakov Seminary in Cracow; etc etc</li>\n<li>19 Iyar: Rav Ezra Attia; Rosh Yeshiva of Porat Yosef in Yerushalayim which produced many Sephardic Rabbanim</li>\n<li>6 Sivan: R Avraham Mordechai of Ger; re-establishing Polishe Chassidis in Eretz Yisroel. [This was done in 3rd grade]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I also would sometimes compare Minhagim and show that, although they seem different, they are based on similar ideas (ie Karpas) or they are essentially the same (I had one group of four Chabad first graders who wanted to daven from Nusach Ari [normally they would be allowed to do that in 2nd grade but one of them was politely insistent and persuaded the others to be\"good Chassidim of the Rebbe\".]   So I made a worksheet showing the 15 Birchos HaShachar (morning Blessings) in three groups side by side, In the order of Ashkenaz, Sefard and Chabad (Ari). We read the endings group by group and then I asked them to do a match.\nThe idea was to show that, except for a few slight variations in wording, they were the same, even though they were \"different.\" I thought that this was a very important way to show the other kids that they were just fine and the Chabad children would understand that they had their way but wouldn't look down on the others.</p>\n\n\n",

What should one do in this situation? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>As a personal solution, to avoid such situations, when I am invited to someone's house, I casually mention before the host says kiddush, \"Btw, I prefer making my own Kiddush.\" There are some Minhagim that each person makes his own kiddush (at least males above bar mitzvah). (not just on Passover). That generally resolves the problem of discomfort.</p>\n\n<p>If they are using grape juice for kiddush, (or if they are using wine and have only enough for one cup; or it is expensive wine and you feel uncomfortable to ask for a whole new cup) then grape juice can be diluted up to 40% grape juice and 60% water (don't have source) and still require the Bracha \"haGafen\" which could mitigate that issue.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps these ideas would help without coming on to whispering kiddush to yourself before haMotzi.</p>\n\n<p>Please note that our wine (as opposed to the wine mentioned in the Gemara) cannot be diluted, as it is already diluted. Any further dilution would leave one with a safek or definite Bracha of Shehakol. See comment below \"To focus on...\"</p>\n\n<p>Another preemptive Eitzah(piece of advice) could be, if there is an Eiruv, bring a bottle of wine/grape juice for a gift to the host. This certainly alleviates the problem of not having enough wine. It also makes it easier to ask to say your own kiddush.</p>\n\n\n",

So there should be a slight pause between \"ברא\" and \"כרעותיה\", and therefore the \"כ\" has a <em>dagesh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that a proof for the Gaon's way is the following prayer we say on Shabbat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עַל הַכּל יִתְגַּדַּל וְיִתְקַדַּשׁ וְיִשְׁתַּבַּח וְיִתְפָּאַר וְיִתְרומַם וְיִתְנַשּא שְׁמו שֶׁל מֶלֶךְ מַלְכֵי הַמְּלָכִים הַקָּדושׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא. בָּעולָמות שֶׁבָּרָא הָעולָם הַזֶּה וְהָעולָם הַבָּא. כִּרְצונו וְכִרְצון יְרֵאָיו וְכִרְצון כָּל בֵּית יִשרָאֵל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The source for this prayer is <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%9B%D7%AA_%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_(%D7%93%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A1_%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9D_%D7%AA%22%D7%93)/%D7%99%D7%93#.D7.94.D7.9C.D7.9B.D7.94_.D7.99.D7.91\">Sofrim 14, 12</a>, where it would seem that it couldn't be that \"וכרצון יראיו\" is connected to \"ברא\", but to the first part of \"יתגדל\" etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://shut.moreshet.co.il/shut2.asp?id=34821\">http://shut.moreshet.co.il/shut2.asp?id=34821</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ykr.org.il/modules/Ask/answer/4750\">http://www.ykr.org.il/modules/Ask/answer/4750</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Before we start, we make the bracha \"al biur chametz\" (on the \"removal/burning/destruction\" of the Chametz).</p>\n\n<p>But we don't destroy the Chametz until the next day. We simply put it aside (and may even <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Erev_Pesach#Latest_time_to_eat_Chametz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">consume</a> chametz the next morning). The bracha which we made is on the completion of the act (which might, according to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/56534/1362\">this</a> answer, stretch out until the chag begins), the destruction.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I have seen in siddurim, though, the concern about hefsek, an interruption, relates to the time between saying the bracha and starting the search, as per #13 <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/h/pes/l/48969586.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>If the bracha actually applies to an action taken the next morning, why wouldn't there be an concern of hefsek from the moment one makes the bracha, until the moment the fire/destruction completes the act (or, as per that other answer, the holiday begins, completing the obligation)?</p>\n\n<p>N.B. -- the issue might relate to the use of \"al biur\" according to those opinions which say that the formulation indicates imminent completion of the commandment, though it seems that some do not agree with that distinction (as per <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10706/why-are-there-two-different-forms-of-the-mitzvah-brachot-l-and-al\">here</a>). Also, there seems to be an idea that the search is <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Bedikat_Chametz#Texts_for_Bedikat_Chametz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">not</a> the completion.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Great question!</p>\n<p>The Rosh Pesachim 1:10 addresses this:</p>\n<p>“אמר רב יהודה אמר רב הבודק צריך שיברך. דלא תימא אינה כל כך מצוה כיון דאינה אלא לבער את החמץ מן הבית. ומה שאין מברכין על ביעור בשעה חמישית בשעה שהוא מוציא החמץ מן הבית והוא מצוה מן התורה כדכתיב ביום הראשון תשביתו שאור מבתיכם ודרשינן לעיל דביום הראשון היינו בי״ד. אומר אני דהוצאת חמץ מן הבית קודם זמן איסוריה לא נפיק מתשביתו דהא אמר רבי עקיבא לעיל (פסחים דף ה:) תשביתו היינו שריפה. ולא צותה תורה לשורפו אלא אחר שכבר נאסר. מידי דהוה אנותר. לקמן (פסחים דף כז:) אבל בעוד שהוא מותר באכילה לא ישרפנו ומה שמוציאין אותו מן הבית היינו שלא יעבור עליו בבל יראה ואין מפורש בו מצות עשה מן התורה שיהא מצוה לברך עליו. ומן הראוי שיברך קודם בדיקה על בדיקת חמץ ותקנו לומר על ביעור חמץ לפי שלאחר הבדיקה מיד הוא מבטל והיינו ביעור לחמץ שאינו ידוע לו ומצניע את הידוע לו ואוכל ממנו עד שעה חמישית ואז מבערו מן הבית ועל עסק זה נגררה הברכה של בדיקה שהיא תחלת הביעור ונגמר בשעה חמישית.”</p>\n<p>The way I understood this Rosh is that the bracha (על ביעור חמץ) that we say before bedika is really a bracha for the bedika, and not the ביעור! The difficulty is that the lashon of the bracha is על ביעור חמץ (so there are many Rishonim who say that it's not difficult since the bedika is the start of the process). So then one may ask, but isn't the whole mitzvah to destroy the chametz ( תשביתו)? The answer is תשביתו only applies after the זמן איסורו, and there is a big discussion in the Rishonim as to when the time of tashbitu is. Therefore according to this, there is no problem of a hefsek after finishing the bedika because you finished the mitzvah already (bedika), the ביעור only becomes a mitzvah after the zman isuro which doesn't require a bracha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The search is the beginning of the Biur. (If one does not search for the chometz one won't be able to burn/get rid of it.) the Bracha he makes is on the whole process of \"search and destroy Chometz\"</p>\n\n<p>The most critical hefsek is the one between the Bracha and the start of the process. Making sure that the process begins immediately after the Bracha connects the Bracha to the process, which validates the Bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly one may not make a hefsek between making a Bracha and starting the process of eating food on which he made that Bracha. Once he has partaken of some food, he may interrupt, speak get up for a short break and come back, as long as the break is not long enough to be considered to be disassociated with the Bracha. When he determines he is finished his meal (benches or washes may'im achronim, etc) then the eating process has concluded and he may no longer eat without saying a new Bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Here, you make the Bracha on the process of \" Search and destroy\", start with the search, put the found Chometz away and store it in a bag or collect it to a known place in the morning, setting aside (normally) some food for the morning chometz-dig breakfast. You go back in the morning, eat breakfast, join any left over Chometz to the bag or collection of items found in the search and then burn/get rid of it. This is the end of the process as determined not by each individual but by Chazal, so there is no need to make a new Bracha.\nSee ShA 432/1 and MB (for detail see my comment below)</p>\n\n\n",

Elsewhere (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14139&st=&pgnum=408\">Kilayim 9:3</a>) it records how R Yirmeya asked to be laid on his side, as if ready to awake and greet the Mashiach, in his grave. The Bavli (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=74&format=pdf\">BB 74a</a>) describes how the Jews who died while wandering the desert for 40 years were sleeping on their backs.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6517\">YD 362</a>) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולדברי הכל נותנים המת על גביו ופניו למעלה והכי איתא  בירושלמי יהבוני על גבי לא עומד ולא יושב ולא מונח ראשי בין ברכי אלא כאדם שהוא ישן<br>\n  And according to everyone we lay the deceased down on his back with his face up, and so it says in the Yerushalmi [TTBOMK we don't have this exact line in our Yerushalmi -- AA]: Lay me on my back, not standing, not sitting, and not with my head between my knees, but rather as one who is sleeping.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6936\">362:2</a>) rules as well that the deceased should be laid as if sleeping on his back with his face up. The Shakh there (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6936\">sk 2</a>) writes that in a standing or sitting position would be \"דרך גנאי\", a disgraceful way of being buried.</p>\n\n<p>It's hard to say burying someone in the fetal position would not fulfill the obligation of burial, but the traditional position seems to be strongly preferred.</p>\n\n\n",

When it comes to reading the halachic works of kashrut organizations, one needs to know the rules for themselves, because the ps'aks released by kashrut organizations often leave out other important opinions that go against their policy. Another person gave an answer with a link to <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/is-sake-kosher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">an article</a> released by the OU, which cites two major concerns, bishul akum and use of different equipment for storage and or processing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Already at the initial stage, when the rice is steamed, the rice is subject to the issur of bishul akum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What they don't mention (but they are surely very aware of) is that according to the opinions of Rav Moshe Feinstein and Rav Yitzchak Abadi that bishul akum does not apply to companies, because bishul akum is a gezirah to prevent intermarriage, which doesn't apply to a company that you have zero connection to.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Abadi applies general principals and rulings to encourage one to navigate buying products to eat without need of supervision, and if indeed the two concerns are bishul akum, and \"equipment,\" then according to Abadi, there is no issue with Sake. The only issue with sake would be drinking sake during Pesach as there is yeast used. According to him (and Rav Moshe Feinstein) Bishul Akum does not apply to packaged food. And last i checked you would be buying sake from a grocery store. Notice the following question, someone is questioning Abadi where he got his base for saying bishul akum does not apply to packaged foods, because this opinion is not made to be very well known.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Subject:    bishul akum</p>\n  \n  <p>Questioner:   Do you have a recorded halachic source to base your heter\n  for bishul akum on packaged goods or is it the opinion of R' Abadi\n  based on his understanding of the halacha?

Again, there is no definitive prohibition happening. There would be concern if they were stored in uncleaned containers that had small amounts of actual wine in them that would mix with the sake, but if that happened, then the  leftover wine would have to be listed in the ingredients. In my opinion, rice wine vinegar has the same \"risk\" of being stored in containers used for other wines, and they are okay per Rabbi Yitzchak Abadi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Subject:   Roland rice wine vinegar ok for pesach\n  Message:    Ingredients-Rice wine vinegar(reduced with water to 4.5%Acidity by volume ) </p>\n  \n  <p>THANKS !\n      Reply:    yes for all CYA</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=50691&highlight=\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=50691&highlight=</a></p>\n\n<p>If the concerns preventing sake from being kasher without supervision are bishul akum, and storage and <a href=\"http://kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=3827&highlight=\" rel=\"nofollow\">or processing</a>, then they aren't applicable according to my interpretation of the rulings of R Abadi.

We don't give wine to children for health reasons, so each of the kids holds their own cup of grape juice from the beginning of kiddush while my father makes the kiddush on wine and pours off for my mother</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think @Scimonster is misunderstanding.  Shulchan Aruk Ha Rav (SAHR) 190/5 says you have to drink from the cup of blessing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>שולחן ערוך הרב אורח חיים סימן קצ סעיף ה</em></p>\n<p>...אף על פי שמצוה מן המובחר שכל המסובים יטעמו מכוס של ברכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And later ibid he says that if you are not drinking from the main cup, and you have your own cup in front of you - These cups become a cup of blessing and as if you are making kiddush on your own cup through hearing the main recititation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרי כולם הן כוסות של ברכה כמו כוס המברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now his quoted Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim (SAOC) 271:14 - does not give a reason to why they should taste, or what they should taste.  You can say SAHR is explaining or arguing.  If he is arguing, then drinking any wine should suffice.  But that is hard to back up.  In SAOC 190:4 in talking of the cup after grace, he uses the same language - best if everyone tastes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>שולחן ערוך אורח חיים הלכות בציעת הפת, סעודה, וברכת המזון סימן קצ</em></p>\n<p>מ\"מ מצוה מן המובחר שיטעמו כולם ....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now we do not see anywhere that everyone drinks their own cup of wine after grace, but only from the cup of blessing.  It would infer that when the SA talks about a cup of blessing, & says all should taste - it would mean specifically from a cup of blessing.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura (MB)(174/3)says anyone who does not drink from the cup of blessing for kiddush needs to make a blessing on his drinks for the meal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>משנה ברורה סימן קעד ס\"ק ג</em></p>\n<p>ודע שאם קידש על היין והוציא אחרים בברכתו\nאם לא טעמו מכוס של קידוש ורוצים לשתות שארי משקין אף שהיו לפניהם בשעה\nשבירך על היין  צריכים לברך על המשקין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why does the MB go out of his way to say drink from the cup of blessing when he could just say drink, if the rule for kiddush is just to drink.  Rather the drinking of everyone is to be from the cup of blessing.</p>\n<p>The main reason for all to drink the wine is to partake of the cup of blessing. This would lead to being no point of drinking when not the cup of blessing. However you can turn your cup in front of you into a cup of blessing.  The problem with this is you need all the things that a blessing cup needs.  Full, not pagom etc.  But most importantly the cup needs to hold a reviit which is 85ml min.  Not a shot glass of wine.  If all is good your blessing on the wine is covered by the kiddush that takes affect on your cup.</p>\n<p>There is another reason that people would drink wine, unrelated to the cup of blessing, is because of their love of the mitzva of kiddush they want to drink wine even if they cant have from the cup of blessing.  If this is true then there is reason to drink even if not from the cup.  But I have not seen a source for this, and I find it difficult to say that is what the SA means, as per my points above.  Also if this is the reason I think that a blessing should be said on the wine, as we do not say blessings of food for other people today.  That is a point for another thread.  (Kiddush and Bread which we do say for others is on the mitzva not the food.)</p>\n<p>There is no kidush text per say for Saturday, just the blessing on the wine. So its easier to say it is a bracha on the wine rather than the mitzva so could cover the shot glass of grape juice.  But the Brisker Rav learns from the GRAs proof from Pesachim 106a that Saturday kiddush is also a bracha on the mitzva not on the wine.  If true there would be no difference between Friday and Saturday, as indeed the Gra learns from Saturday kiddush to Friday kiddush that you have to drink from the cup.</p>\n<p>I am writing this as I want to be challenged.  And if you do not like anything I am saying I would love to have it pointed out with sources - would be much appreciated.</p>\n<p>EDIT - another Source</p>\n<p>The shut Zevchai Ztedek, Orach Chayim 27 - explains the SA that <em>everyone should taste</em> as only referring to when they have their own cup, but there is no need to drink from the main kiddush cup</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שו\"ת זבחי צדק חלק אורח חיים סימן כז</p>\n<p>הרי בהדיא שדין זה שכתב מרן דמצוה מן המובחר שיטעמו כולם הוא מקורו מן\nהרא\"ש ז\"ל והרא\"ש ז\"ל בהדיא כתב שיש לכל א' וא' כוס בידו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However if there is only the one kiddush cup then because of a love for the mitzvah you drink from it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דצריך לשתות מכוס המברך אפי' אחר ששתה הוא ממנו משום חבוב מצוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So at least it is a source to drink for the love of the mitzvah - but still it is from the cup of blessing!</p>\n\n\n",

When a \"ram\" is specified, it must have lived 31 days <em>into its second year of existence</em> (i.e. it must be at least one year and 31 days old). The animal actually spends one month in a twilight zone during which it's neither a lamb nor a ram.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are a couple of brief excerpts about this practice's significance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And just as the first commandment which the patriarch Abraham fulfilled was that of circumcision, so the first commandment that each and every Jewish male who reaches the tender age of eight days old fulfills is that of circumcision. Indeed, this obligation symbolizes, more than any other religious duty, the eternal bond between the Jewish people and their God, a bond which is sealed upon a Jew’s very skin.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>It is no coincidence that this particular commandment is embellished with great adornment by all Jews, regardless of affiliation to movement and organization. Even if the Jew’s natural bond to some of the commandments has been weakened, when it comes to \"Milah\" there is a general consensus. This agreement is equivalent to the testimony of a hundred witnesses regarding the true feeling of each Jew regarding Jewish faith and the Torah. ... [T]he precept of \"Brit Milah\" is undoubtedly the most widely embraced of the commandments, for, more so than any other ritual, it gives expression to a sense of belonging to the Jewish people - the nation which has been chosen for the task of revealing Divine ideals in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Brit shalom is basically Brit mila without the circumcision, is that okay according to Halacha?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"/a/68890\">Isaac Moses</a> is completely correct that the answer is almost always \"no\". However, under certain unusual circumstances, it is possible for a male to enter into the covenant of <em>mila</em> (<em>b'ris mila</em>) without undergoing circumcision. This occurs when the person already was circumcised (but not in a way that halachically qualifies as <em>mila</em>) and cannot be circumcised again, or was born without a foreskin. Then the <em>mohel</em> (<em>mila</em> surgeon) will, instead of performing circumcision, do something else that qualifies as <em>mila</em> and enters the person into the covenant: he will <a href=\"/q/62061\">draw a drop of blood from the usual site of the foreskin</a> (see that linked-to page for more information and sources).</p>\n\n\n",

How much? R' Ami and R' Asi would taste up until a <em>revi'is</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a dispute in the Rishonim about how to understand this Gemara. Rabbeinu Chananel (cited by Tosefos there) writes that it is only if one spits it out that he does not make a blessing (and the part about up to a <em>revi'is</em> is specifically with regards to a fast [Rosh 2:6]). The Rambam (hilchos berachos 1:2), as understood by the <em>Beis Yosef</em>, rules that one does not make a blessing upon tasting even when swallowing, up until the tasting is a <em>revi'is</em>.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1038\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 210:2</a>, cites both opinions, with the opinion of Rabbeinu Chananel as \"there are some who say\".

Therefore, when one is in this situation, he\n  should intend to have the benefit of what he tastes as food, make a\n  bracha, and swallow it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>from <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/blessings/3-When-is-a-Bracha-Not-Required.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">aish.com</a> (see there for further sources)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A bracha is only made on food that is consumed.

She should continue learning even with mentioning God's name when learning the verses of the Tanakh. One should not be lax during this time. Also the woman who is niddah can go to synagogue. She may touch holy books and objects without restraint. (Although there are some ashkenazim who are stringent about these matters.)\" The quote comes from <a href=\"http://judaicseminar.org/halakhot/taharat_habayit/7-behavior.htm\">here</a> which cites  <a href=\"http://www.mysefer.com/product.asp?cookiecheck=yes&P_ID=3999&strPageHistory=related\">Taharat Habayit</a> Vol. 1 Chapter 12.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.responsafortoday.com/images/Lil5-e.pdf\">This</a> document, though problematic on some levels, certainly summarizes (starting page 11) similar ideas permitting and then introduces some issues of concern.

We have thus shown that the above precepts are very useful in many respects. First, they keep us at a distance from dirty and filthy objects; secondly, they guard the Sanctuary; thirdly, they pay regard to an established custom (for the Sabeans submitted to very troublesome restrictions when unclean, as you will soon hear); fourthly, they lightened that burden for us; <strong>for we are not impeded through these laws in our ordinary occupations by the distinction the Law makes between that which is unclean and that which is clean. For this distinction applies only in reference to the Sanctuary and the holy objects connected with it: it does not apply to other cases.</strong> \"She shall touch no hallowed thing, nor come into the Sanctuary\" (Lev. xii. 4). Other persons [that do not intend to enter the Sanctuary or touch any holy thing], are not guilty of any sin if they remain unclean as long as they like, and eat, according to their pleasure, ordinary food that has been in contact with unclean things. But the practice of the Sabeans, even at present general in the East, among the few still left of the Magi, was to keep a menstruous woman in a house by herself, to burn that upon which she treads, and to consider as unclean every one that speaks with her: even if a wind passed over her and a clean person, the latter was unclean in the eyes of the Sabeans. See the difference between this practice and our rule, that \"whatever services a wife generally does to her husband, she may do to him in her separation\"; only cohabitation is prohibited during the days of her uncleanness.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp183.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also specifically makes mention of the stricter Islamic customs with regard to menstruation in a letter to his son <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# Current Chicken Controversy in Jerusalem\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The original questioner asked the following: What is the kashrus problem with Eida Chareidis Chickens, and why does the Eida think its not a problem? (kikar.co.il/194374.html – @kouty)</p>\n\n<p>However this is unfortunately quite vague. I will therefore explain the situation as I understand it (not based on the article but based on discussions with Rabbonim.)</p>\n\n<p>All chickens receive some sort vaccination when they are born (a few shots actually.) Different hechsherim administer the shots in different places. Some give it in the chest, some in the neck, and some in the leg. The focus of the question is not the location of the shot as that is a different dicussion. The Eidah Charedis gives it always in the leg. This has been common practice by the Eidah Charedis for many years. Recently (in the past month or so) it was discovered by \"someone\", that a number of chickens (in the 1000s it seems) starting showing signs of illness in the place where the vaccination is given. This caused concerned as it's where the \"tzomet hagidim\" are and if the tzomet hagidim are torn the chicken is rendered treif (not kosher.) This is a very broad statement as the actual place on the leg of where the tzomet hagidim are found is a maklokes. However simply put if the gidim (which need to be defined as well) are torn, then the animal would be treif. The supposed illness caused by the vaccination (apparently) was cause for concern and made a \"ra'uso\" (<em>can someone please translate this for me, I can't find the english word best to use?</em>) in the status of the tzomes hagidim and that was the whole cause for concern. The illness didn't cause the gidim to tear (at least I dont' think so) but did cause a change in color or perhaps dis-formation (which I do believe the poskim speak about as raising a cause for concern in the gidim -- in there is a blood clot, etc.)</p>\n\n<p>What came after was a lot of hysteria as it was suspected by some that as many as 90% of the chickens shechted by the Eidah in the last month or so were effected by this. Gatherings of Rabbonim were made to discuss the issue and the Eidah Charedis came out that everything was okay, perhaps even lichatchila, perhaps even mahadrin.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the intention of the questioner was to ask: If the gidim are infected with an illness in some way and have lost their normal look (and are not torn) is this a problem? Is the chicken treif? Is it real cause for concern? Must one be machmir? Why should this be accepted as \"kosher lichatchila\" or even \"mahadrin\" as the Eidah seems to be saying. If it's assumed that this illness effected 1000s of chickens then how can we be sure even after inspecting some and discovering no tearing in the tzomes hagidim that others are also not torn? What if some were found to be torn from this disease, would that effect the status of all of them?</p>\n\n<p>(I'll leave it up to the original questioner to decide if this is right or wrong and to then edit the question appropiately, but at least this is a starting put to have the question be taken off hold. I wanted to ask it myself but had to do more research first, however after seeing this I decided to edit it in one shot based on my conversations with Rabbonim in Jerusalem.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did The Snake In The Garden Of Eden Have Free Will?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that all of creation recognizes Hashem and is obedient to Hashem, and that humans are the only creation from Hashem that have free will.</p>\n\n<p>So why is it that the snake in the garden of Eden was able to tempt Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The snake is an allegory for the ability of the human mind to deceive itself. Adam entered a world in which he would be able to do this by 'partaking' of the Tree of Knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>By doing this, Adam would now be able to construct an emotionally fulfilled world devoid of God, but which would be fuelled by its own gradual destruction.</p>\n\n<p>God created this loop-hole in the human mind in order to allow free will.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Zohar (Beraishis 35b), the snake in the garden was Satan (aka the Yetzer Harah) who is one of the angels.  This angel's mission is to be an opposing force to humankind which gives people the ability to choose between following different paths in life. It is brought down that his name is סמא\"ל which stands for סיום מסכתא אין לעשות ie is equivalent to the opposition we have in our lives to learning Torah and finding God.</p>\n\n<p>In reference to your question, while angels have Independence and can \"do things\" on their own, they have no free will in the way that people have free will.  </p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam in hilchos teshuvah, man's free will has two levels, the one relevant to this discussion is the ability to define one's self and direction in life. Angels do not have this ability because an angel and its mission are the same thing (see Bereishis Rabbah 50:2, \"One angel cannot have two missions. Neither can two angels share the same mission\"). This is why an angel in Hebrew is called 'malach' meaning messenger. The message is its defining characteristic, not its \"self\".  It is a purely spiritual being tied only to its mission (see Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's translation, \"Sefer Yetzirah: The Book of Creation in Theory and Practice\" for a more in depth explanation of this concept).</p>\n\n\n",

Yes there's complicated discussions brought down about mishloach manot, plus discussions about engagement gifts. At the end of the day, Rabbi Hershel Shachter shlit'a is on the record that the \"single guy shouldn't give single lady mishloach manot\" concern is a chumra that extends beyond normal halachic concerns.</p>\n\n<p>I would be so bold as to propose (<em>not</em> that <em>propose</em>!) something simple: normally, single guy gives single girl flowers, fine whatever. But on a day when many people are feeling silly and everyone is going around giving stuff to their neighbors, we don't advise a single-guy-single-girl practice. Because every now and then, a guy (sometimes the girl too) fills silly and says \"you are wed to me\" while handing her a Hershey bar, pizza slice, or the like. (This makes a <em>lot</em> of headaches for rabbis.) So when telling people to go do a mitzva, we don't encourage playing with fire!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><p>See Rema Orach Chayim <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3076\" rel=\"nofollow\">695, 4</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>ואשה תשלח לאשה ואיש לאיש אבל לא להיפך שלא יבא איש לשלוח לאלמנה ויבאו לידי ספק קידושין אבל במתנות לאביונים אין לחוש\n</blockquote> \n\n<p></p><p>\nThe Machatsith Hashekel explain that this Chashash follows the svara that if he send a special gift called \"sivlonoth\". they are certainly already married (according Tosfoth Kidushin 50B). </p>\n\n<p>This question is very serious. There is evidence that despite he has not sent specially witnesses (but witnesses saw that he was offered a gift), a serious problem remain.

One nice explanation comes from <a href=\"http://ou.org.s3.amazonaws.com/publications/brachot/brachotpreface.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is thus apparent that the very wording of the blessing reflects the religious experience of all of humanity. First there is the contrast between the felt immanence of God, His proximity, reflected in the word ata, You. Immediately afterwards the sense of God's transcendence takes over, that is His distance from humanity and how far away He can sometimes seem.</p>\n<p>...When faced with a piece of bread, fruit, meat, or a drink, the gratitude he experiences is one which contains a sense of closeness to God. But that sense is always ephemeral. It cannot last and it quickly transforms into an awareness of God as the powerful Omnipotent Being whose majesty makes all humans feel puny and insignificant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I am left wondering about the texts of the blessings madebefore and during Birchat Kohanim.</p>\n<p>The bracha said by the Kohanim before they bless the people seems to fit the mold as established by many other Brachot, and fir the explanation of the OU site -- \"levarech at amo Yisrael\". The Kohanim address Hashem in second person and then \"move away\" to refer to Hashem in third person.</p>\n<p>But the bracha made before this, by the Chazzan, stays in the second person!\n\"...she'otcha, levadcha b'yir'ah na'avod\" that YOU, alone, we will worship.\"</p>\n<p>This could easily have been written in the third person \"she'oto, levado\" -- that He, alone, we will worship.</p>\n<p>What is there, in terms of meaning, that allows us to continue in the second person, instead of realizing the distance between us and the Divine, and moving to the third person (as the chazzan does if there is no Birchat Kohanim when he says \"hamachazir shechinato\")?</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara answers: Lest you say that with these adornments on her, she has more degradation, as people say in a known aphorism: Undressed, naked, and wearing shoes.

The Gemara answers, \"We would think it should be left on [as further degradation], as the saying goes, 'stripped naked and wearing shoes'.\"</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara is not using it as a parable, but rather for its own sake, to point out how jewelry in this case would be an embarrassment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Gemara is quoting a common saying, and that was most likely used to bring out a lesson.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The gemmora in first perek of megillah says that Achashverosh ordered Vashti to come before him as described in your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The passuk says in Mishlei 11,22, 'Nezem zagav be'af chazir, ishah yaphah v'soras taam'.</p>\n\n<p>A gold ring in the nose of a pig, a beatifull woman with no reason.</p>\n\n<p>The mishna in Avos 6,2 quotes this passuk to describe someone who is blessed with physical endowments but does not learn Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The Ruach ha'Chaim on this mishna explains this is analogous to a naked person being offered jewellery to wear who will repudiate the worthless offer.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Give money to defendants to pay their claims? Won't that increase theft?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Avos d'R' Nasan</em>, 33:1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>… Not only that, but our father Abraham did <em>tz'daka</em> (≈social justice) first and thereafter <em>mishpat</em> (≈justice), as is said [Gen. 18:19] \"for I know him, for he will command his sons and family after him to do <em>tz'daka</em> and <em>mishpat</em>\". When two litigants would come before our father Abraham in a matter of judgement, and one [of them] would say about his fellow \"he owes me a <em>mane</em>\", our father Abraham would take out a <em>mane</em> of his and give it to [the defendant] and tell them \"arrange your case\", and they arranged their cases. If [the] one was found liable to his fellow, [Abraham] would say to the one holding the <em>mane</em> [he had given him] \"give the <em>mane</em> to your fellow\";  if he was not [found liable], [Abraham] would tell them \"split [the <em>mane</em>] and depart in peace\".</p>\n<p>But King David did not do thus; rather he would do <em>mishpat</em> first and thereafter would do <em>tz'daka</em>, as is said [Ⅱ Sam. 8:15] \"David would do <em>mishpat</em> and <em>tz'daka</em> for all his nation\". When litigants would come before King David for judgement, and one [of them] would say \"he owes me a <em>mane</em>\", [King David] would tell them \"arrange your case\" and they would arrange their case. If [the] one was found liable to his fellow for a <em>mane</em>, [King David] would take out a <em>mane</em> if his own and give it to him; if not, he would tell them \"depart in peace\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems like anyone who knew about this policy of Abraham's or of David's could simply refuse to pay his debts, or could steal or damage property, or the like, and know that the damages will be paid for him. With that in mind, how do we explain these policies of theirs?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A similar passage about David (but not the one about Abraham) appears in the <em>Bavli</em> (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 6 <em>amud</em> 2). On it, <em>Maharsha</em> comments:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They say about this that David said [Ps. 119:121] \"I did <em>mishpat</em> and <em>tz'daka</em>; do not leave me to my oppressors\": he prayed that that the pauper and his plaintiff not form a conspiracy against [David], [with the non-pauper] suing the pauper even if he owes nothing so that [David] might pay on his behalf, and then splitting between them what they got out of oppressing [David].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Perhaps</strong> <em>Maharsha</em> would say the same to the present question: that David prayed that he not be the victim of such a scheme.</p>\n\n<p>After that passage, the <em>Bavli</em> offers an alternative explanation of what David did:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Although he did <strong>not</strong> pay from his own property, there was <em>mishpat</em> to [the plaintiff] and <em>tz'daka</em> to [the defendant]: <em>mishpat</em> to [the plaintiff], for he returned him his money, and <em>tz'daka</em> to [the defendant], for he took a stolen item from him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On this, <em>Margaliyos Hayam</em> explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>… How could they say here that his taking a stolen item from someone is <em>tz'daka</em> without giving him anything of [David's] own? However [one can answer as follows]: Lo, we are not dealing with wicked people, that [this defendant] knows that this is a stolen item and is keeping it in his possession. Rather, because a person doesn't see something negative about himself, he thinks that he has a right to this item. The judge who removes it from his possession — this is by learning this law with him and explaining it to him. And they said in [<em>Bavli</em>] <em>K'subos</em> 50, the end of <em>amud</em> 1, \"'his <em>tz'daka</em> stands forever' [Ps 112:9]: this is someone who learns and teaches Torah\", for this is the Torah of kindness. If so, someone who taught him practical law in removing the stolen item from his possession did a first-class <em>tz'daka</em> for him from his own property.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Perhaps</strong> <em>Margaliyos Hayam</em> would say the same to the present question: that this description of David's actions is a description of how he dealt not with wicked people but with misguided ones, and he would not offer his own money to wicked defendants.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What Was The Source Of The Primordial Light On The First Day Of Creation\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It says on the first day of creation in Genesis that there was light. On the fourth day of creation, the sun was created. So what was the source of the primordial light on the first day of creation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is a very good but difficult and very deep question. I will not pretend that I fully understand its answers but let me bring two relevant explanations.</p>\n\n<p>The simpler explanation comes Arthur Kurzweil in <a href=\"http://amzn.com/0470173459\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Torah For Dummies</a>, online <a href=\"https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=t8VZga76bw4C&pg=PA22&lpg=PA22&dq=light%20sun%20creation%20torah&source=bl&ots=jy7OMhiB-9&sig=Rc4WurZd5XE3NhpnaKfhj2jhJgA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBhLTTn67LAhWhJKYKHQPACEAQ6AEILTAD#v=onepage&q=light%20sun%20creation%20torah&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (pp. 22 and 168).</p>\n\n<p>He explains that <strong>the light created on the first day was the light of creation, also called the primordial light, and is the divine emanation that forms the basis of creation. Creation is a contracted and sculpted emanation of that primordial light from God.</strong> It is not light as we know it, think of it more as primordial energy.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>R Avraham Yitzhak Kook writes a deeper explanation in <a href=\"http://amzn.com/1490909362\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sapphire from the Land of Israel</a> (see also online <a href=\"http://ravkooktorah.org/BREISHIT_67.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for a more complete version of the below)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The very first act of Creation, as recorded in the Book of Genesis,\n  was the creation of light. “And God said: There shall be light” (Gen.\n  1:3). What kind of light was this?</p>\n  \n  <p>It cannot be the light that we are familiar with, the light emanating\n  from the sun and the stars. These heavenly bodies were created much\n  later, on the fourth day of Creation. The Sages called this primordial\n  light Ohr Ha-Ganuz, ‘the Hidden Light.’ Too pure for the current state\n  of the universe, God concealed it for a future, more deserving world.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>The philosophers distinguished between chomer, matter, and tzurah, the\n  form or function of an object. For example, wood is a raw material\n  (chomer) that may be used to produce many different functional\n  objects. Once it is designated for use as a table, the wood also has\n  tzurah, form, having acquired a particular purpose.</p>\n  \n  <p>At the very beginning of Creation, there was only chomer. God created\n  numerous elements, but they were without tzurah. They lacked function\n  and purpose. This state of disorder and dissonance is referred to as\n  darkness — “darkness on the surface of the depths” (Gen. 1:2). The\n  Torah calls this unstable primeval stage Tohu and Bohu, indicating\n  that it was chaotic and empty of form.</p>\n  \n  <p>Then God created the Ohr Ha-Ganuz. This special light played a\n  critical role in Creation. Just as regular light allows us to see and\n  relate to our surroundings, the Hidden Light enabled the different\n  elements of creation to interact with one another. It dispelled the\n  initial state of darkness, when all objects were isolated and\n  disconnected from one another.</p>\n  \n  <p>To use the terminology of the philosophers, the illumination created\n  on the first day of Creation stamped a functional tzurah on the\n  material chomer. Through this special light, the universe’s myriad\n  objects acquired purpose and function and were able to work together\n  towards a common goal.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Midrash (Breishit Rabbah 3:4) elucidates the verse in Psalms,\n  explaining that “God wrapped Himself in light like a garment and\n  illuminated the splendor of His glory from one end of the world to the\n  other.” What does it mean that ‘God wore light'?</p>\n  \n  <p>This phrase indicates that the light took on God’s qualities of\n  oneness and unity, just as a garment takes on the shape of the one\n  wearing it. When ‘God wrapped Himself in light,’ this means that He\n  introduced an underlying unity into all aspects of creation, ‘from one\n  end of the world to the other.’</p>\n  \n  <p>[to summarize]</p>\n  \n  <p>At first, God created heaven and earth in an isolated state, as chomer\n  without form and purpose. This was the unstable state of Tohu and Bohu\n  described in Genesis, when the diverse elements of creation existed in\n  chaotic darkness, lacking an underlying unity.</p>\n  \n  <p>Then God said, “There shall be light,” creating the special Ohr\n  Ha-Ganuz, the Hidden Light with which He bound the matter together\n  with a common purpose. God ‘wrapped Himself in the light,’ thereby\n  giving the light His trait of oneness and making it a unifying force.\n  After creating this unifying light, God ’spread out the heavens’ and\n  stabilized the universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemarah in Chagigah 12a brings  two answers to this question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כְּתַנָּאֵי אוֹר שֶׁבָּרָא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְּיוֹם רִאשׁוֹן אָדָם צוֹפֶה וּמַבִּיט בּוֹ מִסּוֹף הָעוֹלָם וְעַד סוֹפוֹ דִּבְרֵי רַבִּי יַעֲקֹב וַחֲכָמִים אוֹמְרִים הֵן הֵן מְאוֹרוֹת שֶׁנִּבְרְאוּ בְּיוֹם רִאשׁוֹן וְלֹא נִתְלוּ עַד יוֹם רְבִיעִי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov said the light that Hashem created on the first day, a person could see from the begining of the world to the end. The Chachamim said that the sun and stars were created on the first day[and gave the light],but they weren't \"hanged\" until the fourth day.</p>\n<p>In other words, according to Rabbi Yaakov this was a seperate light that lit up the entire world, not eminating from the sun or stars, according to the Chachamim it was the light eminating from the sun and stars.</p>\n<p>I think that the first opinion can be explained as the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, that scientists say filled the universe with light before the first stars [as pointed out in the comment of Isaac Kolitzky]. Since it filled the entire universe, one could see from the begining to the end of the world. Scientists have detected a cosmic microwave radiation(CMB) coming at us in every direction. Scientists think that this radiation came after the explosion of the big bang, and was before the stars. It originally was visible light, then as the universe cooled, it became microwaves, so it is currently in microwaves.</p>\n\n\n",

The State Treasurer (who had authority to prevent this) approved this switch. As a result, the cities existing water supplier terminated their contract, giving them 12 months to switch to a new water provider. The cities new supply was not yet ready (and wouldn't be for over two years), and the existing water company knew this. As a result, the city (with the approval of the Department of Environmental Quality) had to move to their backup source of water, the Flint River. The Mayor was given operating authority of the Public Works department (who overseas the water supply). Subsequently, the water was found full of contaminants including carcinogens, lead and pathogens. A year later, the previous water company offered to reconnect the city after they had forced this switch to a contaminated water source. The emergency manager (who gave the authority over the Public Works to the Mayor) declined. Later, the state government forbade reconnecting to the previous water source as a precondition of a loan to the city government.</p>\n\n<p>In all, between 6-12,000 people have been affected by lead poisoning and other illnesses, 10 people have been killed by Legionnaires' disease and 77 others have been infected (this <em>may</em> not have been due to the contaminated water, but it's likely).</p>\n\n<p>The actors:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The City council - chose to switch water suppliers and rejected the offers of the existing water supplier</li>\n<li>The State Treasurer - the final authority in that decision</li>\n<li>The original water supplier - broke their contract knowing that the city didn't have their new source in place</li>\n<li>The new water supplier - whose inability to provide a stop-gap forced the switch to the contaminated backup source of water due to the early termination of the previous contract</li>\n<li>The Department of Environmental Quality - the final authority on the switch to the contaminated water</li>\n<li>The Mayor - responsible for the department which ensures the safety of the city water supply and turned off the old water source</li>\n<li>The Emergency Manager - implemented the switch to the contaminated water and declined reconnecting to the old water supplier, believing the contamination was already fixed</li>\n<li>The State - prohibited the supply of clean water to the city after the contamination had started</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The citizens pay for the provision of clean and safe drinking water directly to their homes, but in this case the water was dangerous and caused harm.

While this would seem to be a \"dina d'malchusa dina\" and a \"Chillul Hashem\" issue, One would first need to answer questions that would determine if the question applies. As a result, one first must determine that there is indeed <strong>no</strong> \"religious exemption\" for <strong>any</strong> religion and what the practice is for other religions. Then one can see if this is a \"religious persecution\" situation or not.</p>\n\n<p>The answer for that situation is that <strong>usually</strong> there would be a discussion which would involve the \"sacramental wine\" used by the Catholic Church in its religious rituals. These laws would seem to be written in such a way as to include the synagogue.</p>\n\n<p>Since the question involves specific locations (such as Quebec) , the answer would be to ask the rav of a specific shul that seems to sell wine exactly what the situation is (and what are the applicable laws) in that location.</p>\n\n<p>I have come across locations in which the shul is (as an example) allowed to stock wine bought at the \"State Store\" for repurchase of its congregants (as a service to those congregants).</p>\n\n<p>As I said each location is different and would have to be looked into. One cannot give a general answer because each case can be different.</p>\n\n<p>Also note the citation below in which the defacto behavior of the locality has \"always been\" to assume a \"religious exemption\" exists and the courts have accepted this even if a specific exemption was not written into the law. If this was done in practice, then it is best to keep quiet and not bring the subject up.

For example, i don't think anyone would have predicted that nearly a thousand years after the Rambam that the only community that still followed him would be the Yemenites. You would have figured the community of Cairo would have been the one to hold his Torch, but sometimes history happens and things change in unpredictable ways.</p>\n<p>It is my opinion that there are a few historical coincidences that caused the Shulchan Arukh to spread as much as it did, and cause it to become a sort of standard up until even today.</p>\n<p>The biggest influence was undoubtedly the expulsion of Jews from Spain in 1492. Not only was Yosef Caro one of the expulsed, but thousands of his comrades were scattered all over the world. And not only were these Sephardim entering new lands in vast numbers, they <em>were not integrating into their new communities.</em> Rather than change minhags to the new lands they found themselves in as was normative halacha, they decided to open up their own Synagogues, or to continue their practices despite the prevailing customs. And so when Yosef Caro wrote his great work the Shulchan Arukh, being a Sephardic work meant for Sephardic Jews, the book quickly spread all over the world, to all the communities where Sephardim had landed. Caro had an idea that his work might be problematic, and therefore included the following words in his intro to the Bet Yosef</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And if there are countries which hold that certain things are prohibited, even if we rule differently, they should continue to uphold their custom, as they already accepted upon themselves the words of the sage who prohibited it, and they may not be lenient in the matter as the Talmud states in Pesahim (51B)”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But despite these concerns, the Sephardim in their new lands were not only holding to Caro despite the prevailing custom, these Sephardim were also trying to bully other communities into following the Shulchan Arukh. This bullying went so far that Yosef Caro himself had to respond to this in one of his teshuvoth.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yosef Karo (author of שולחן ערוך‎):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Who is he whose heart conspires to approach forcing congregations\nwho practice according to the RaMBáM of blessed memory, to go by any\none of the early or latter-day Torah authorities?!</p>\n<p>...  Is it not a\ncase of a fortiori, that regarding the School of Shammai—that the\nhalakháh does not go according to them—they [the Talmudic Sages] said\n‘if [one practices] like the School of Shammai [he may do so, but]\naccording to their leniencies and their stringencies’: The RaMBáM, is\nthe greatest of all the Toráh authorities, and all the communities of\nthe Land of Israel and the Arab-controlled lands and the West [North\nAfrica] practice according to his word, and accepted him upon\nthemselves as their Chief Rabbi.  Whoever practices according to him\n[the RaMbáM] with his leniencies and his stringencies, why coerce them\nto budge from him?</p>\n<p>And all the more so if also their fathers and\nforefathers practiced accordingly: for their children are not to turn\nright or left from the RaMBaM of blessed memory.  And even if\ncommunities that practice according to the Rosh or other authorities\nlike him became the majority, they cannot coerce the minority of\ncongregations practicing according to the RaMBaM of blessed memory, to\npractice like they do.  And there is no issue here concerning the\nprohibition against having two courts in the same city [‘lo\ntithgodedu’], since every congregation should practice according to\nits original custom…”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=636&st=&pgnum=70\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abqáth Rokhél, simán 32. Translation: r. M.S. Bar Ron</a>)</p>\n<p>So we see that in Yosef Caro's lifetime there was an attempt to force congregations to follow him, despite the Rambam being the normative standard for Jews in Arab lands. But we in the modern era cannot fathom the amount of Sephardic Jews that would enter into new communities, sometimes they arrived in such populations that they outnumbered the indigenous communities. So if the normative minhag was x by a population of 500, but now there's a new minhag from a new populace of 3,000, something is bound to change.</p>\n<p>The other reason why the Shulchan Arukh became the standard was because the mindset of the observant Jew was changing. The earlier halachic authors (such as the Rambam) had a mindset (which was shared by the general populus) that there was one right/correct way to practice halachah, and that even if there were contrary opinions, you would have no need to worry about them since you are following the correct path. For the Rambam (and older halachic authors) if the majority of opinions said x, but they felt that y was correct, they would have no issue saying the correct halacha is y. While they might value and consider contrary opinions, they were not things that one needed to be concerned with. There wasn't the same amount of \"weight\" of majority of opinions. The truth was the truth, whether 1 person said it, or 1,000 people. If the Rambam said x, then you could do x without any need to worry about any other contradictory opinions. The Rambam felt that he had the authority and opinion to give new rulings, even if no one had ruled that way before. But as time went on, a new situation started to arise: if the Rambam said X, the Rosh said Y, and the Tur said Z, then people started to doubt what the correct option was as many of these opinions were mutually exclusive. Because if you follow the Rambams X, then you would be going against the Rosh and the Tur who had different opinions. So there became the new option of [XYZ], a combination or comparison of these different opinions, and people would try to fulfill all three, or side with a majority. If the Rambam says that the <em>correct</em> way to pray was to prostrate on the ground, but there are now 5 halachic authorities who go against this, then this new mindset would say that clearly the <em><strong>more</strong> correct</em> way to pray is to follow the majority of the opinions. Yosef Caros work was the beginning of this process as he would compare the 3 main opinions and would [often] side with the majority. Whereas the Rambam would not rule based by majority, he would rule based on correctness. And one wouldn't need to worry what other opinions were, nor feel any pressure to follow them.</p>\n<p>So those are the two situations that caused the work to become as influential as it did. And within 200 years of its authoring, it became the standard for most Jewish communities. And we still see this change in following opinions panning out in today's generations, where \"minority\" opinions aren't as valid as \"majority\" opinions that agree.</p>\n\n\n",

Jewish mystics, such as the 16th-century Kabbalist Isaac Luria, also wrote extensively about the eschatological process and the role of the Messiah in bringing about the final redemption. It should be noted, however, that there is no one authoritative source for Jewish eschatology, and there are many different interpretations and variations on these beliefs within Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

It is a  text that describes, and is intended to guide one through, the experiences that the consciousness experiences after death. So I was wondering if there is something similar in Judaism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is no book of the dead in Judaism. <strong>We have a Torah, which is called <em>Torat Hayim</em>, a Torah of Life.</strong> It does include a Jewish philosophy of life after death including the <em>neshama</em> (soul) rejoining its source, reward and punishment for its actions on earth, and kabbalistic perspectives on reincarnation.</p>\n<p>For further reading, see for instance <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/282508/jewish/What-Happens-After-We-Die.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/life-after-death/#\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/281641/jewish/Life-After-Death.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.

For neither any one person nor the universe in its entirety can attain perfection while wrongfulness prevails over goodness as it does now. That state of affairs has to be transcended through (each individual’s) death and (the universe’s) destruction.</p>\n\n<p>It’s also true that the soul can’t purify a body  until it’s first separated from it at death and the body decomposes. Only then can a new edifice  that can achieve perfection be set up. That explains the need for The Resurrection of the Dead, and for the eventual destruction of the physical universe and its own “resurrection” in the course of the seventh millennium .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class19.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paragraph 10</a> </p>\n\n<p>Thus, true reward will come about after the Resurrection of the Dead, and after the world would have been undone and redone -- when body and soul would have been reunited, after the soul would have purified the body, and when both could then enjoy the great goodness of that reward .</p>\n\n<p>Not everyone there would enjoy the same degree of reward, though, even when there. The more one struggled in this world to grow and perfect himself, the greater would his reward (and experience there) be . Since those efforts would determine the degree to which his body (and its associated aspects) would have been purified by his soul , and would also determine how “close they (i.e., body and soul in combination) would merit drawing to G-d, to basking in the light of His countenance, and to enjoying His true goodness” .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class20.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paragraph 11</a></p>\n\n<p>Body and soul each go their own way at death. The body returns to the dust from which it was made , and the soul goes to The Soul World .</p>\n\n<p>That is, the soul doesn’t just passively anticipate its true and infinite reward in The World to Come while the body decomposes, is purified, and then returns to the soul . It enjoys something of the delight it will enjoy in The World to Come , according to the merits it will have earned in the physical world there in The Soul World (just as the delight it will experience in The World to Come will correspond to its merits) . Nonetheless, as we said , true and fulsome reward and delight will ultimately be experienced by the body and soul together.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class21.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paragraph 12</a> </p>\n\n<p>The soul enjoys a couple of other advantages in the Soul World which will ultimately benefit it and the body when they’re rejoined .</p>\n\n<p>Since it was decreed that one could only achieve perfection after having experienced death, it follows then that even if someone actually earned it while he was alive (which is in fact the only environment in which one could earn it ), he’ll have to wait for it.</p>\n\n<p>What that implies is that the soul has to be exposed to sin and wrongfulness to one degree or another while the individual is in this world , and to become darkened and dimmed  as a result of that exposure. It also implies that the soul can’t express its full inherent luster while the individual is still alive , having been tinged that way.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, the body which could have benefited and been purified from the soul’s luster can’t experience that in this world. And the soul suffers from the fact that it can’t manifest its luster in life too, since it can’t fulfill its raison d’être then, which is to purify the body, given that “things only achieve perfection when they fulfill their G-d-given purpose” . It’s clear then that both the soul and the body lose a lot in life.</p>\n\n<p>Ramchal’s point, then, is that the soul attains some of what it lacked for in life while in The Soul World. It can radiate fully there, and its ability to purify the body is bolstered there, too .</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org/learning/ramchal/classes/class22.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Paragraph 13</a> </p>\n\n<p>In fact, by all rights the soul should actually and quite naturally purify the body to a truly supernatural degree when an individual is born, whether he’s worthy of that or not, given how inherently pure the soul is.</p>\n\n<p>But the point is that G-d purposefully disallowed for that , and keeps the soul at bay, if you will, in the course of one’s life, so that His intentions  can be fulfilled. So the soul does what it does while it is in the body, and no more, where it otherwise sits stifled and withdrawn, so to speak .</p>\n\n<p>It’s also true that the soul should likewise be able to expand and irradiate as the individual engages in good deeds in his life, and to purify the body then to a degree. But that, too, was denied the soul in life.</p>\n\n<p>But those restraints will all be removed in the course of the Resurrection of the Dead, when the soul will purify the body in one fell swoop. And the combination of body and soul will grow higher and higher  to the degree that accords with the sort of person that individual had come to be in life , until they become worthy of the World to Come where they can continue to grow .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>We don't ignore the dead and we show them respect with a proper burial, we do good things in the name of the diseased, and we don't observe the commandments openly nearby graves or wear nice clothing (leather shoes) so as to not appear that we are mocking the dead.</p>\n\n<p>However...</p>\n\n<p>we don't concern ourselves as much with the dead as the living as our divine purpose is fulfilled by carrying out G-d's will when we are alive. Once a person passes on there is  nothing left they can add to what they did during their lifetime. Consider that life is like a market. While the market is open we can barter and make deals. The same is true in our divine service when we are alive we have the opportunity to fulfill G-d's commandments. </p>\n\n\n",

However, the prevalent minhag among Ashkenazim is the one that you mention.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/3222\" rel=\"nofollow\">הוספת \"ולכפרת פשע\" בשנה מעוברת</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל המנהג הרווח הוא, לפי הספרדים כל השנה, ולפי האשכנזים מתחילת השנה עד\n  חודש העבור.</p>\n  \n  <p>The prevalent minhag among the Sefardim is the entire year and among\n  the Ashkenazim until the leap month (Adar II)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explains the Ashkenaz minhag rationale.</p>\n\n<p>Since Adar II is the last month of the year when counting by months, and Rosh Chodesh Nisan is the first month then the minhagim of Rosh Chodesh would follow that way of counting. Thus, the addition of ולכפרת פשע would end at the \"end of the year\" by months. </p>\n\n<p>Even if you count by the change in the year number (Tishrei), by the end of Adar II, the leap month has been added and the months have been reset to synchronize with the seasons.  If the Sanhedrin were to determine the leap year, the end of Adar would be the absolute last time it could have been done. As a result, we have now added the thirteenth month and the brachos for the months now revert to the normal 12. Once Rosh Chodesh Nisan has passed (without an extra month having been set to synchronize it) a leap year cannot be decreed until the following Adar.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the gemara mentions that Chizkiyahu decreed a second Adar at Rosh Chodesh Nisan and the Chachamim stated that he was wrong to do so. See Sanhedrin 12b.</p>\n\n<p>The question would more likely be \"why start saying it in Tishrei rather than the previous Nisan\" if you count by Nisan as the first month.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for that, would be that the earliest simanim that would indicate the the year <strong>might</strong> be a leap year would not show up until Tishrei (Rosh Hashana for the count of years). I remember seeing a reference that he chachamim would not discuss a potential leap year until Tishrei. As a result, we do not start saying ולכפרת פשע until after Tishrei. Note that since Tishrei is Rosh Hashannah, we do not have that part of musaf in Tishrei.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As mentioned in the Rambam<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Sanctification_of_the_New_Month.4.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>, the Sanhedrin could meet to decide about whether or not to make a leap year, even for many years in advance. But they could only publicly declare it after Rosh Hashana.</p>\n\n\n",

Examples include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Backpack vs messenger bag, satchel, handbag</li>\n<li>Child carrier vs carrying a car seat using the handle</li>\n<li>Headphones vs telephone headsets (\"Bluetooth<a href=\"https://www.bluetooth.com/marketing-branding/brand-best-practices-guidelines\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><sup>®</sup></a>\")</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>I've lived for over 10 years among chassidim, and do not remember ever seeing any chassid use the dual-sided implements, while the single-sided ones are a daily sight. My wife's Satmar/Malachim grandfather even promptly got us a stroller when he saw us using a child carrier!* I asked the son of a chassidic rebbe, who agreed that chassidim do not use such items, but was unable to explain it.</p>\n\n<p>One may think that it stems from an aversion to modern trends, but the Bluetooth example would contradict this.</p>\n\n<p>Where does this behaviour come from?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>*It was clear that he was unhappy with the carrier, even though we were traversing stairs daily, using public transportation, and carrying luggage – all activities for which a carrier is more convenient than a stroller.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Pesachim (109b) mentions that pairs (even numbers) are dangerous, while non-pairs (odd numbers) are fine. This is illustrated in a story involving Rabbah (BM 85a). Perhaps Chassidim feel that wearing two straps falls under this category and thus avoid it as a measure of safety.</p>\n\n<p>(I have no idea if this is actually where it came from. I've never heard of such a minhag before. I'm positing a theory.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<h3>Culled from <a href=\"http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/36710/discussion-between-n-and-daniel\">chat</a>.</h3>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-166073.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">US Army regulations</a>, <em>Soldiers may</em> [only] <em>carry these bags by hand, or on one shoulder using a shoulder strap.</em> It would seem from this that dual-sided carrying is considered less dignified, and that would be sufficient reason for chassidim to disapprove.</p>\n\n<p>The Air Force has similar rules, including <em>leaving right hand free to salute.</em> While chassidim do not salute, they do touch mezuzas with their right hand.</p>\n\n<p>It may also be more uncomfortable to wear things like backpacks the more layers you are wearing on your torso. Military and chassidic uniforms each introduce additional torso layers.</p>\n\n<p>I personally wear very light clothing, so I am less bothered by such issues. However, in yeshiva I used to wear a normal suit jacket, and my backpack would wrinkle my jacket and untuck my dress shirt.</p>\n\n<p>So too, an over-the-head headset does not go well with wearing a hat, which many chassidim do throughout the day.</p>\n\n<p>The above is further indicated by the fact that chasidim do wear shirts with two sleeves and glasses with two temples instead of sleeveless shirts and monocles.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for Chasidik practice of imagining yourself giving up your life during the first verse of Krias Shma\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>in a chassidus shiur i heard that the obligation for krias shma (for people busy with parnoso) according to all opinions is the first posuk of shma with kavono</p>\n\n<p>and that the kavono is by saying it you are excepting the yoke of the kinship of haven (i guess the source of this is the mishna)<br>\n<strong>and that you are ready to give your live for echod (Hashem)</strong><br>\nwhat is the source of this?        </p>\n\n<p>i thought that bicol nafshicha means this but what does it have to do the first verse and with the word \"ehod\"? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The first source is multiple, a mishna, a berayta with Rabbi Akiva, Rishonim.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li> \n<a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_soncino.php?ms=Berachoth&df=54a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><b>Mishna</b> Berachoth 9, 5 </a> (pasted here from the Gemara with Soncino's translation)\"<blockquote>'WITH ALL THY SOUL' MEANS, EVEN THOUGH HE TAKES THY SOUL [LIFE]\"</blockquote> but the verse cited is the second verse and not the first.\n</li>\n<li><b>Gemara</b> Berachoth 61B\n<blockquote>When R`Akiba was taken. He prolonged the word ehad until he expired while saying it. A bath kol went forth and proclaimed: Happy art thou, Akiba, <b>that thy soul has departed with the word \"ehad\"!</b> <a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_soncino.php?ms=Berachoth&df=61b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> see here</a></blockquote> It seems this is the first verse that is in question.<br>\nThe explanation is that Rabbi Akiva was amazed by the verse. He wondered, how is it possible to love G_d even when they kill us; that is to say, when it ceases to manifest his presence by the protection it has on us. The lack of perception of G_d is a sign that we are facing something far greater than previously believed. This means that we discover our blindness across as what it really is, and it is much more than what we were we represented (This is an idea often found in the books of Chassiduth, for example Rabbi Menachem Mendel Mivitebsk in <b>Pri Ets</b>, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=3681&st=&pgnum=39\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Drush Leparshath Teshuva</a> If you understand this you may link what he says with this Gemara and an other Gemara with Rabbi Akiva that treat about midath hadin.). One day Rabbi Akiva was able to do all the effort he has developed this Cavana out of the Kriath Shema and in the general rapport with the existence of G_d. He is Echad, in all situations. It is in this spirit that we see a hint in several books as it has in the Rosh's Orchoth Chayim in Rishonim.\n<li>\nHere is <b>Orchoth Chayim</b> from HaRosh (his source is Igeret Hateshuva from Rabenu Yona). He extends this thought to the love of God in general. not just krias shema:\n<blockquote>לאהוב את ה' אלהיך בכל לבבך וגו', למסור גופך וממונך על קדושתו, ובזה תקיים בעצמך דברי המשורר \"כי עליך הורגנו כל היום\".\n\nלבטוח בה' בכל לבבך, ולהאמין בהשגחתו הפרטית, ובזה תקיים בלבבך הייחוד השלם בהאמין בו, כי עיניו משוטטות בכל הארץ, ועיניו על כל דרכי איש, ובוחן לב וחוקר כליות. כי מי שאינו מאמין \"אשר הוצאתיך מארץ מצרים\", אף ב\"אנכי ה' אלוהיך\" אינו מאמין, ואין זה ייחוד שלם. כי זה היה סגולת ישראל על הגויים, וזה יסוד כל התורה כולה: </blockquote>\n<li>\n<b>Noam Elimelech</b>, Tsetel Koton in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19056&st=&pgnum=10&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> the 2 first paragraphs</a> developp the general idea and the cavana in KS. .

In other words, there is a prohibition to celebrate things like New Year's Day, April Fools' Day, May Day, and Canada Day, but not Rosh Chodesh of the Jewish months. While indeed sometimes the Jewish Rosh Chodesh falls on the first of a secular month, we need not be concerned for this minority of cases. (It's worth noting this is quite the novel position, as according to nearly all prior opinions the secular date is irrelevant to Halakha.)</p></li>\n<li><p>Ramah: We apply a Sefeik Sefeika (double doubt): maybe today isn't really the first of the month because everything is shifted by a few quarter days before a leap year, and even if not maybe the Gregorian calendar is wrong and the first of the month was 11 days ago. With so many doubts we need not be concerned about this prohibition. (The Shach there disputes this as being only one doubt: is it Rosh Chodesh or not?)</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.postcodes-australia.com/state-postcodes/tas\">TAS</a> / Aroch Hashulkhan: The prohibition doesn't apply far away from Israel. God knew that in lands far from Israel they wouldn't be able to know when Rosh Chodesh would be declared and the prohibition would be too hard to keep, so He never enacted the prohibition in lands far from Israel. This confusion is evident in the modern practice of sometimes celebrating 2 days of Rosh Chodesh out of doubt. (Some question the application of this to our times when there is no Sha'at HaDechak as we can all readily find out certified Rosh Chodesh times.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Indeed while all of those opinions have holes in them, we can ask a stronger question: <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0410.htm#10\">Numbers 10:10</a> seems to list Rosh Chodesh among the happy days of the year, in that, in contrast to <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0410.htm#9\">Numbers 10:9</a>, the Korbanot in the Mikdash were accompanied by Teki'ah blasts instead of Teru'ah blasts. How then could celebration on Rosh Chodesh be prohibited?</p>\n\n<p>The answer though is clear. The real prohibition of Chodesh only applied to women, as we see from <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0411.htm#20\">Numbers 11:20</a> which limits the negative effects of celebrating Rosh Chodesh to that which comes from men's noses (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0102.htm#21\">not ribs</a>). Since women don't participate in the offerring of sacrifices in the Temple (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=36&format=pdf\">Kiddushin 36a</a>), there is no question from the celebratory procedures there on Rosh Chodesh.</p>\n\n<p>This also explains why <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/1232520/jewish/Why-is-Rosh-Chodesh-Considered-a-Womens-Holiday.htm\">women maintained the practice of not working on Rosh Chodesh</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2136\">OC 417:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It's important to note that for those obligated to celebrate Rosh Chodesh, fasting would be prohibited (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Taanit.2.10\">Ta'anit 2:10</a>, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2136\">ShA OC 418:1</a>). However, while eating on this holiday, they should be careful to seek foods certified Kosher with Yoshon flour, as it says (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0326.htm#10\">Vayikra 26:10</a>) \"In the face of the [Rosh] Chodesh, eat only Yoshon.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>חדש אסור <strong>מן התורה</strong> means that it is forbidden to celebrate months that are <strong>from the Torah</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>As we know well, the months in the Torah do not have names.

Of course, this name is the name of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Names_of_months\">Canaanite month</a>. This is the month that we are celebrating on <em>Rosh Hodesh</em>.

    "content": "# What's so important about a lost blanket-rope? And how did it get lost anyway?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/37438/1713\">This question</a> asks about how we can possibly know that our <em>mesorah</em> (tradition) is correct since we lost the chain of <em>smicha</em>. But what is so important about a chain of blankets? Such things are useful for prison-breaks, but how do they help us maintain our tradition? Perhaps something useful was written on them?</p>\n<p>From the question, I gather that <em>Moshe</em> had a blanket to which <em>Yehoshua</em> attached his own blanket and that this continued throughout the generations. If this continued through generations until the times of the <em>gemara</em> as that question suggests, that must have been quite a large chain of blankets! How could it possibly have been lost?!</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It's not exactly a chain; it's more of a sequence of events.  The <em>s'micha</em> is used for <em>kinyan</em> during the ordination, so the recipient can acquire his status without doubt.  Both the student and the rabbi grasp the corners of the blanket during the ceremony.  (Some require them to also review the first chapter of Bava Metzia during the ceremony.)</p>\n\n<p>The blanket -- the very one that Moshe gave Yehoshua -- was supposed to be kept safe in Yerushalayim, with all rabbis going there to receive their new status.  But the blanket has been lost (I blame Rome), and with it the ability to grant true <em>s'micha</em> status.  It is hoped that when Moshiach comes he will be carrying a bundle of wool.</p>\n\n<p>Why is <em>kinyan</em> needed at all?  As we know, each generation since Sinai has been less than the one before; this is why we don't overturn prior <em>halacha</em>.  Why is each generation diminished?  Because each act of granting <em>s'micha</em> actually <em>transfers</em> a bit of the grantor's <em>s'micha</em>-essence to the grantee.  The acquisition of this <em>s'micha</em> thus requires <em>kinyan</em>, because it is an actual transfer of ownership.  This is like giving somebody a cutting from a plant so he can grow a whole new one; here we are giving somebody a bit of the Tree of Life, the <em>torah</em>, and hoping it will grow further.  But new growth isn't as complete as old growth, hence the gradual diminishing since Sinai.</p>\n\n<p>I was asked in a comment:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[...] why can't another object be used (or why can't we make a new blanket)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You want to use something other than Moshe's sacred blanket, or, worse yet, make a <em>new blanket</em>?  Shall we also convene a new Sanhedrin today to overturn pesky, no-longer-necessary <em>halachot</em> like <em>yom tov sheni</em>?  And from there we could go on to building the Temple -- why continue to settle for a diminished state when we have the means to fix it?  No, in all of these cases we must wait for Ha Kadosh Baruch Hu to enact the divine plan in its proper time -- when Eliyahu returns with the holy blanket we can resume true <em>s'micha</em>, and until then we will just have to make do with what we have.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>\"Ger Yihyeh Zar'echa Ba'eretz Lo Lahem\" - As the Jewish people are considered to be quintessential <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wandering_Jew\" rel=\"nofollow\">wanderers</a>, Chazal state that it is vitally important to <a href=\"http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Towel\" rel=\"nofollow\">keep your towel</a>. This was especially important in the midbar, as the towel could provide shade, allow you to comfortably lay upon the sand, or, as in Moshe's case, double as a mask to hide his glowing face from the nation.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal are not referring to a chain of blankets, they are referring to a specific CHAIN OF OWNERSHIP over a SINGLE TOWEL, specifically the heilege towel Hashem handed Moshe rabbeinu to clean up after writing the first Sefer Torah. This towel obviously doubled as the Masveh, which is in fact the end-shortening of the word Mesorah, where the Reish and Heh are combined into a single letter.</p>\n\n<p>The original process of conferring smicha involved wrapping the towel around the Talmid's head and THEN laying your hands upon the towel turban. The Mitznefet of the Kohen Gadol was worn with the tzitz to symbolize exactly this divine process. This is why the KG cannot raise his hands above the Tzitz, as it would would be placing his hands on top of Hashem's hand, something explicitly forbidden since Chazal say that Hashem purchased Yisroel and therefore \"Yado al ha'elyonah.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I\" rel=\"nofollow\">Theodosius</a> passed laws forbidding <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semikhah#cite_ref-9\" rel=\"nofollow\">towel transmission</a>, leading to the original towel being hidden and it's location lost. It is assumed they passed this decree because the Romans believed the proliferation of towel use among Jews detracted from the glory of their aqueducts and bathhouses, and that forbidding the use of towels was an attempt to enforce assimilation of the Jews into the culture of the Roman Empire.</p>\n\n<p>There is significant dispute among the Sages as to whether a new towel can be ordained with the holiness necessary to reinstate the process of the rabbinic mesorah. Related debates rage about whether the composition of the towel is important, particularly whether the towel should be composed like the mitznefet or the paroches and whether shatnez is a halachic concern in the construction of a new S'michah.</p>\n\n\n",

This is because he was using his phone to videophone with God, as the verse says (Ex. 33:11) \"וְדִבֶּר ה׳ אֶל מֹשֶׁה פָּנִים אֶל פָּנִים / God spoke to Moses face to face\".</li>\n<li><em>Rashi</em> to 34:29 notes that this was <em>Yom Kipur</em>. How, you may ask, did Moses justify using his cell phone on <em>Yom Kipur</em>? Well, he figured it must be okay to use a cell phone, since, after all, God had asked him to bring the Jews two tablets.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is all a big misunderstanding. Michelangelo got the idea that Moshe had horns because he mistranslated the verse you cite. In Latin <em>keren</em> sounds like <em>cornu</em> (<em>corno</em> in Italian), the word for horn.</p>\n\n<p>So Moshe didn't have horns at all and none of your options are correct.

One of the main reasons is that the Torah points out that, while allowed, it is not the ideal (as stated in Bereishis 2:24 with Adam). Rav Hirsch goes into detail about this.

We learn in Shmot 28:15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעָשִׂיתָ חֹשֶׁן מִשְׁפָּט, מַעֲשֵׂה חֹשֵׁב--כְּמַעֲשֵׂה אֵפֹד, תַּעֲשֶׂנּוּ</p>\n<p>And you shall make a breastplate (חושן) of justice, the work of a craftsman; like the making of the vest (אפוד) shall you make it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, the חושן was embedded with twelve stones. Thus, by reverse comparison, the אפוד must be embedded with twelve stones. Although this did not actually happen, it was fulfilled because the איפוד and the חושן were attached (28:23-25):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כג וְעָשִׂיתָ, עַל-הַחֹשֶׁן, שְׁתֵּי, טַבְּעוֹת זָהָב; וְנָתַתָּ, אֶת-שְׁתֵּי הַטַּבָּעוֹת, עַל-שְׁנֵי, קְצוֹת הַחֹשֶׁן.  כד וְנָתַתָּה, אֶת-שְׁתֵּי עֲבֹתֹת הַזָּהָב, עַל-שְׁתֵּי, הַטַּבָּעֹת--אֶל-קְצוֹת, הַחֹשֶׁן.  כה וְאֵת שְׁתֵּי קְצוֹת שְׁתֵּי הָעֲבֹתֹת, תִּתֵּן עַל-שְׁתֵּי הַמִּשְׁבְּצוֹת; וְנָתַתָּה עַל-כִּתְפוֹת הָאֵפֹד, אֶל-מוּל פָּנָיו.</p>\n<p>23 And thou shalt make upon the breastplate two rings of gold, and shalt put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate. 24 And thou shalt put the two wreathen chains of gold on the two rings at the ends of the breastplate. 25 And the other two ends of the two wreathen chains thou shalt put on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod, in the forepart thereof.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In our days, many ignore this halacha. However, your nailing of the vest to the wall could help you in this area-- if your walls contains exactly twelve stones.</p>\n<p>You have completed step one of this mitzvah; once you inlay twelve stones into your wall, you will have completed it fully. But you must hurry to do the second step, for Chazal said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המחבר את אפודו לדבר, כל שעה ושעה שאין שתים עשרה אבנים נתונות בו, מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו מתחייב בנפשו</p>\n<p>One who connects his vest to something, every hour that twelve stones are not inside it (the connected thing) Scripture considers it as if he has forfeited his life (Talmud Bubbly, Masechet Baba Mayseh, Daf 1a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam also codifies it as Mitzvah #614.</p>\n\n\n",

There is a case in the talmud (from memory) in which an amora was going to stop the Baal Tefilah from saying Hallel until he saw that part of it was left out. Thanks to @RonP for pointing out that this story is about Rav in Ta'anis 28b.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a widespread custom to recite Hallel on Rosh Chodesh. Indeed,\n  according to the letter of the law, there is no obligation to do so,\n  because Hallel is required only on days that are called mo’ed\n  (appointed times), and when work is prohibited. Rosh Chodesh is called\n  a mo’ed, but work is permitted on the day. Still, the Jewish people\n  have accepted the practice of saying Hallel on Rosh Chodesh, in order\n  to give expression to the sanctity of the day, which is capable of\n  elevating one to the level of singing God’s praises. To make it clear\n  that the Hallel of Rosh Chodesh is based on custom, and not\n  obligatory, we omit two paragraphs that are said when reciting the\n  complete Hallel (the complete Hallel consists of chapters 113-118 of\n  Tehillim, and we skip 115:1-11 and 116:1-11).</p>\n  \n  <p>The issue of Hallel on Rosh Chodesh is elucidated in Arachin 10b,\n  Ta’anit 28b, Tosafot ibid., and Tosafot Berachot 14a. See Sefer Rosh\n  Chodesh, chap. 6, sections 1-6 and 20, with notes. Notes 2 and 27,\n  there, explain the reason for the custom. There is another type of\n  obligatory Hallel, which is not dependent on the sanctity of a day,\n  rather on a salvation, like the one said on Chanukah. See below 4:6\n  and 11:8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In fact, there is also a machlokes as to whether or not to say the bracha on Hallel.

We see four consecutive <em>Munach</em>s, which hint at her unwillingness to go (<em>Munach</em> comes from \"נחת\", resting, walking slowly).</p>\n\n<p>There are many other enlightening examples, but let's see now what the cantillation say in our case:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַעֲצַ֥ת יְ֝הֹוָ֗ה הִ֣יא תָקֽוּם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's a slight pause of the <em>Munach</em> on \"היא\", which hints at two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <em>Munach</em> is under \"היא\", which means she should rest (<em>Munach</em> is from the root of resting).</li>\n<li>Since there's a pause by the <em>Munach</em>, we must read \"היא - תקום\" - that the man must get up.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>, let us now open our morning prayer book and see what are the next verses in line (before <em>Ashrey</em>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבּוֹת מַחֲשָׁבוֹת בְּלֶב אִישׁ, וַעֲצַת ה' הִיא תָקוּם\n  <br>עֲצַת ה' לְעוֹלָם תַּעֲמֹד, מַחְשְׁבוֹת לִבּוֹ לְדֹר וָדֹר\n  <br>כִּי הוּא אָמַר וַיֶּהִי, הוּא צִוָּה וַיַּעֲמֹד</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We can see that they left us no room for doubt. The second verse says \"עצת ה' לעולם תעמוד\". But still, does \"תעמוד\" mean the husband should get up (גוף שני), or the woman should (גוף שלישי).</p>\n\n<p>So \"בא הכתוב השלישי ומכריע ביניהן\", we have the third verse to remove all doubt and solve our problem: \"הוא צוה - ויעמוד\"! Finally, an explicit command that the husband must get up.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that these problems and tribulations were <strong>hinted in this last verse</strong>, in a more explicit way than mentioned:</p>\n\n<p>\"כי הוא אמר ויהי\": When we reach the situation of \"ויהי\" - <em>Chazal</em> teach us in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%99_%D7%91\">Megillah 10b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי לוי ואיתימא רבי יונתן דבר זה מסורת בידינו מאנשי כנסת הגדולה כל מקום שנאמר ויהי אינו אלא לשון צער\n  <br><br> Said Rabbi Levi, or some say Rabbi Yonatan: We have a tradition from <em>Anshei HaKnesset HaGedolah</em> - anywhere it says \"ויהי\" - it is a sign of sorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some explain that \"וי\" and \"הי\" are both roots of trouble and weeping (\"הי\" is the base of \"נהי\").</p>\n\n<p>So we see that \"כי הוא אמר ויהי\" - when we have troubles (between the parents) and weeping (of the baby) - \"הוא צוה - ויעמוד\" - the man must get up and take care of it. ודו\"ק.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is no question that the woman must rise. The second interpretation is the correct one.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately you omitted the beginning of the verse that you cited, so that you can understand how this is deduced. The full verse is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבּ֣וֹת מַחֲשָׁב֣וֹת בְּלֶב־<strong>אִ֑ישׁ</strong> וַעֲצַ֥ת יְ֝הוָ֗ה הִ֣יא\n  תָקֽוּם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>There are many thoughts in the heart of a <strong>man</strong>....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, man's thoughts are vanity and, essentially worthless as it says:</p>\n\n<p>Psalms 94:11:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יְֽהוָ֗ה יֹ֭דֵעַ מַחְשְׁב֣וֹת אָדָ֑ם כִּי־הֵ֥מָּה הָֽבֶל׃</p>\n  \n  <p>The LORD knows the thoughts of man, That they are vanity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If man were to stand, he would probably begin talking soon afterwards and telling people what he thinks. Even, if he sits, he expresses his thoughts. When he's silent, he doesn't verbally express his thoughts, but, as a man, myself, believe me ... he thinks -  and others know what he's thinking even before he opens his mouth. And, if you're talking about a man's wife ... she knows what her husband is thinking even before the thought enters her husband's vain brain! He may as well not bother thinking at all!</p>\n\n<p>So, the verse is telling you G-d's advice. Since G-d knows best that man's thoughts are worthless, it's better for a woman to stand first and express her thoughts before you hear it from him.</p>\n\n\n",

Moshe ran the first-ever <em>picobrewery</em>, producing a single batch of a single ale.  A quantity was stored alongside the <em>parah adamah</em> water and the shattered tablets, but like those other treasures has now been lost.</p>\n\n<p>So you cannot get <em>true</em> Golden Calf Ale, at least until Eliyahu -- who has a particular interest in alcohol according to every <em>seder</em> I've ever been to -- comes to restore this concoction to us.

Many Greek commentators on the Septuagint, including <a href=\"http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/863/7971/\">Pliny the Elder</a>, claim it was Amber, which means that Moshe was drinking standard Amber Ale. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Saadia Gaon disagreed and said it was onyx, which would imply Moshe was imbibing an exotic <a href=\"http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/31/\">black ale</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Most modern scholars, though, translate Leshem as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacinth\">Jacinth</a>, a orange-crimson stone that lends its color to <a href=\"http://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/style/128/\">red ales</a>. </p>\n\n<p>The jacinth, though is named after the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinth_(plant)\">Hyacinth</a> flower.

But if it had been steady, it would not have been cancelled by the interval of 20. This text is based largely on from Ramban, but it represents only the first opinion quoted by Ramban.</p>\n\n<p>The original text of Ramban is in its book on Hilchoth Nidda, chapter VI, (in Hershler Edition, <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49095&st=&pgnum=309&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halacha 2</a>).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשחוזרת לראות ביום וסתה לכ' אע\"פ שחזר הוסת למקומו יש שהורה שצריכה לחוש ליום ל' ממנו ויש שהורה שאינה חוששת כלום משעה שחזר הוסת הקבוע למקומו נעקר שאינו קבוע ולזה דעתי נוטה שאם אין אתה אומר כן תהא אשה זו כל ימיה רואה מכ' ועדיין צריכה לחוש לשלושים </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that the question is harder in the case below.</p>\n\n<p>. A woman was accustomed to have her menses every 20 days,</p>\n\n<p>. Afterward, the intervals were of 30 days instead of 20.</p>\n\n<p>. The interval of 30 became steady and the interval of 20 was cancelled. See also [SA 189.14][<a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%98_%D7%99%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4</a></p>\n\n<p>. If the intervals become again to be 20 days, Ramban teaches us that there are two opinions: </p>\n\n<p>.     The first is the opinion of the Raavad.<sup>(1)</sup> We cannot halachically cancel the interval of 30 as long as we have not 3 times an amenorrhea long of more than 30 days.</p>\n\n<p>.     The Ramban holds a second opinion: The interval of 30 is halachically cancelled after 3 consecutive intervals of 20. And the SA 189.14 follows him.</p>\n\n<p>. But your case is different, and according to both opinions. Two periods coexist, Because intervals and dates are two kinds of Veset, and are not contradictory. The Raavad in Baale Hanefesh says as obvious that dates are not contradictory if e.g. there is a Veset for the first day of the month and after this Veset became steady, she can make a second Veset steady together, e.g. the 20th of the month.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> </p>\n\n<p>Coexistance of two periodicities based the first on dates and the second on intervals is possible, or two vesatot based on dates is possible. Bu if both are based on intervals, there is a disagreement between Raavad and Ramban. The SA in Sayf 14 holds the Ramban opinion.</p>\n\n<p>(1) Raavad, <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14483&st=&pgnum=51&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baaley Hanefesh Shaar Tikun Vestot</a>, </p>\n\n<p>(2) What is 30?

If I turn the Torah upside down twice (as seems to be implied by his saying this twice), I don't see the purpose because it's in the same position as when I began. So, what am I really accomplishing by doing it in the first place? Besides, he says that EVERYTHING is in it. I'm probably not going to find everything from just two flips.</p>\n<p>SO, I think that Ben Bag Bag means, <strong>continuously</strong> flip it.

They are only learning from the example of Isaac and Rebecca.  She helped Jacob fool her husband in his infirm old age when he could barely see(Genesis 27 has the sordid details).  If Isaac had the proper mistrust, his children, and their later generations, would have probably gotten along better, and not hated each other, prophesizing against each other(Obadiah, for example), and even to the point of declaring war between the countries of Judah/Israel and Edom(II Kings 14, etc). Tanakh plainly shows us that a little healthy mistrust of your wife can save a LOT of trouble later on.  As far as compensating for the stress, as the Talmud(Nedarim 20b)says \"the husband can do whatever he wants to with his wife\".  The wives know they deserve it, since when they misbehave and earn their husband's mistrust and retribution(often finding themselves bent in odd positions), they are contradicting HaShem's words of Genesis 3:16\"he shall rule over her.\"</p>\n\n<p>Actually, come to think of it, Genesis 3 is another perfect example, also the first, of where a little mistrust could have avoided a lot of problems:</p>\n\n<p>\"Hmm-HaShem says don't eat it, but you and some snake-in-the-grass say it's just fine?  I don't THINK so!!!\"  But no, he trusted her instead of HaShem, resulting in all sorts of problems for us humans from then on--pain multiplication, banishment, and, amongst some non-Jews, the source of a \"doctrine of Original Sin\".  A little healthy marital mistrust then could have avoided a LOT of later problems for all of us! </p>\n\n<p>PS - This IS Purim Torah!

You would be allowed to pass to him other items at the table or to put something down next to him so that he can pick it up. </p>\n\n<p>Second, since the two of you are married, he is a Kli shemelachto l'heter.

    "title": "Understanding a qal vechomer in the Mishna",
    "content": "# Understanding a qal vechomer in the Mishna\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a fairly long-handled question, but it boils down to a desire to understand R' Shimon's <em>qal vechomer</em> in the Mishna, Negaim 10:2. Usually, for a <em>qal vechomer</em> to work, there needs to be a relationship of some description between its different components, and an indication that one half of the equation is more severe than the other. The following is the background to his <em>qal vechomer</em> and the <em>qal vechomer</em> itself:</p>\n\n<p>In the Mishna, Negaim 10:2, R' Shimon produces a <em>qal vechomer</em> in order to make a point: that when it comes to <em>tzara'at</em> in the beard or on the head (נתק), thin, yellow hairs are an indicator of impurity only if the blemish predates it. His proof relies on the fact that in regular skin blemishes (בהרות), white hairs are only an indicator of impurity if they are preceded by the blemish. The technical term for this is הפוך: that the blemish \"turned\" the hair white.</p>\n\n<p>In producing a <em>qal vechomer</em>, R' Shimon relies on a key difference between the baheret (the skin blemish) and the neteq (the blemish in the beard/head): when it comes to a skin blemish, while white hairs are a sign of impurity, there is no type of hair that can serve as a sign of <em>purity</em> - in other words, the presence of two white hairs is enough to render the skin blemish impure, regardless of how many black hairs there are. When it comes to a blemish on the beard or head, the presence of black or red hairs will purify the blemish, regardless of how many thin, yellow hairs there are.</p>\n\n<p>His <em>qal vechomer</em> is as follows: Just as the white hair (in a skin blemish), which cannot be redeemed by any other hair (ie: cannot be negated by the presence of a black hair and made clean) is only impure if it was turned white by the blemish, then how much moreso should a thin, yellow hair (in a head/beard blemish), which <em>is</em> redeemed by other hair (ie: is negated by the presence of black or red hairs and made clean), only be considered impure if it was turned thin and yellow by the blemish!</p>\n\n<p>In his lashon, \"מה אם שער לבן שאין שער אחר מציל מידו אינו מטמא אלא הפוך, שער צהֹב דק ששער אחר מציל מידו אינו דין שלא יטמא אלא הפוך\".</p>\n\n<p>I do not understand what could possibly be the relationship between a hair's being changed by the blemish rather than predating it, and its being \"saved\", so to speak, by other hairs (ie: negated by their presence and made clean). Furthermore, I do not understand why one of these cases should necessarily be more stringent than the other. Is the skin blemish more stringent because no amount of black hair can purify it? Or is the head/beard blemish more stringent because black and red hair <em>can</em> purify it?</p>\n\n<p>If somebody understands this <em>qal vechomer</em> and how it serves as a proof, I would appreciate an explanation. (I would also appreciate any reference to mefarshim who either explain it or find it problematic.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've never learned the <em>mishna</em> (or <em>maseches</em>) in question, and am basing this solely on your description and my experience with <em>kal-vachomer</em> arguments elsewhere in <em>Shas</em>. With that caveat:</p>\n\n<p>The argument seems to be this: white hair, which <em>easily</em> renders a person <em>tame</em> (namely, even in the presence of other hair), nonetheless fails to render a person <em>tame</em> unless it followed its blemish. Thus, yellow hair, which <em>hardly</em> renders a person <em>tame</em> (namely, not in the presence of other hair), should a fortiori fail to render a person <em>tame</em> unless it followed its blemish. So all four parts of the argument (white vs. yellow and absence of other hair vs. appearance before the blemish) are about how easily various hairs render a person <em>tame</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The first verse is about a hair being changing. It is a case that an event occurred, like an illness. Torah describes the <b>phenomenon</b> and do not addresses the issues of relationship with any \"<b>mechanism</b>\".</p>\n\n<blockquote>וְרָאָה הַכֹּהֵן אֶת הַנֶּגַע בְּעוֹר הַבָּשָׂר וְשֵׂעָר בַּנֶּגַע הָפַךְ לָבָן וּמַרְאֵה הַנֶּגַע עָמֹק מֵעוֹר בְּשָׂרוֹ נֶגַע צָרַעַת הוּא וְרָאָהוּ הַכֹּהֵן וְטִמֵּא אֹתוֹ<br> רש\"י  ושער בנגע הפך לבן. מתחלה שחור והפך ללבן בתוך הנגע.\nRashi says that it was already a hair at this emplacement, and he remained after the apparition of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitiligo\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vitiligo</a><sup>[1]</sup> and the hair color changed to white.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Up to now, we understand the literal sense.

There is no Tum'a.</li>\n<li><b>A Yellow and thin hair was here on healthy scalp</b>, after time, the scalp develops a tinea. Here is the discussion.</li>\n\n</ul>\n\n<p></li>\n</ul></p>\n\n<h3>Now we are ready for the Qal Vachomer</h3>\n\n<p>If in matter of presence of dark hair, the white hair remain a valid sign, (and this, despite that he may not be a sign when he was here prior the injury of the skin), a yellow thin hair that was a weak sign, altered by the presence of dark hair, QAL VACHOMER, that he loses his propriety of sign when he precede the injury of the scalp. The strength of a sign is measured by its degree of \"pathognomony\". Semiology is different than pathophysiology, thus the reasoning is only about the sign strength, and we measure this following the result.<br><br>\n<h3>We know that Tsaraat is a set of phenomenons</h3>, in skin, clothes, walls.

Thus when one reads the Parsha of Haman he is praying for a piece of Haman's wealth. The reason it works is that Haman does not like when the Jews pray, as Jews prayers caused his downfall, thus he just gives of his wealth to anyone who says it in order to get them to stop.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Chazal say that the reason for the decree of Haman was twofold:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Jewish people derived benefit from the feast of King Achashverosh, a symbol that they were loyal servants reliant on the economy of his kingdom.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Jewish were corrupted by infighting and lashon harah.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When Mordechai rallied the Jews to fast, they displayed an unprecedented (in that generation) level of unity. It was in this merit that they were saved.</p>\n<p>The young man is reading the ninth perek of Megillas Esther. It is called Parshat Haman because it deals with the retribution of the Jews against their aggressors and the final fall of the House of Haman. Of particular importance here is possuk 10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י**  עֲשֶׂרֶת  {ר}  בְּנֵי הָמָן בֶּן-הַמְּדָתָא, צֹרֵר הַיְּהוּדִים--הָרָגוּ; וּבַבִּזָּה--לֹא שָׁלְחוּ, אֶת-יָדָם**</p>\n<p>10 the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Jews' enemy, slew they; <em><strong>but on the spoil they laid not their hand.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This restraint was a rectification of their earlier sin at the feast of Achashverosh. Their refusal to despoil their fallen enemy was a declaration of faith that Hashem is the provider of all bounty.</p>\n<p>The daily reading of this parsha is recommended as a reinforcement of both achdus and bitachon, and in the merit of these Hashem will grant us parnassa.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Parshat Haman is a short parsha Esther 3:1 - 7. The parsha introduces Haman and the key part of this parsha refers to how the righteous Mordechai disobeyed the king's order to bow down to Haman.</p>\n\n<p>The key verse is Esther 3:4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י באמרם [כְּאָמְרָ֤ם] אֵלָיו֙ <strong>י֣וֹם וָי֔וֹם</strong> וְלֹ֥א שָׁמַ֖ע\n  אֲלֵיהֶ֑ם וַיַּגִּ֣ידוּ לְהָמָ֗ן לִרְאוֹת֙ הֲיַֽעַמְדוּ֙ דִּבְרֵ֣י\n  מָרְדֳּכַ֔י כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָהֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Now it came to pass, when they spoke <strong>daily</strong> unto him, and he hearkened\n  not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s words\n  would stand; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From here, we learn that it was because the king's servants spoke to Mordechai <strong>daily</strong> and each day he refused to listen to them, that it was in this merit that Mordechai and the Jews were eventually spared. (Had it ben just a single or occasional warning, it would not have demonstrated Mordechai's merit as strongly.)</p>\n\n<p>We see at the end of the Megillah, that Mordechai became wealthy as he was appointed vice minister to the king, and he wore royal garments, etc.</p>\n\n<p>So this is why it is a good <em>segulah</em> to read this parshat Haman which refers to Mordechai's refusal to Haman.</p>\n\n\n",

I am also often <em>very</em> direct and focused more on a technical aspect when asking or answering, so I hope to not raise feathers.</p>\n\n<p>There are several passages in the thread which are raising my eyebrows:</p>\n\n<p>Jeffiekins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if it's a website that is particularly likely to attract Jews, the author would be contributing to the violation of the Sabbath by the non-observant (similar to the idea of \"attractive nuisance\" in U.S. law), which is not permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later again by Jeffiekins:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to Jewish Law, it is not permitted to make it easier for another Jew to do something they're not supposed to do, <strong>regardless of whether (s)he accepts that the restriction applies to him/her.</strong> (Bold formatting by me).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Daniel:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a religious Jew, though, it becomes relevant to me when I become involved personally. Halakha dictates that I cannot enable a Jew to violate halakha because it is \"placing a stumbling-block. \" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After reading the relevant passages of \"Lifnei iver\", my understanding so far is:\nYou cannot be impartial or have a \"Not my business\" attitude according to halakha: If a Jew is in danger to involuntarily (!) commit a sin, it is a duty to try to prevent the sin. This can be active (shout a warning, block the way) or passive (inform e.g. gentiles about aspects of halakha so that they do not involuntarily facilitate sin). It also includes passive resistance: Do not support business which facilitates sin or give people opportunities to sin. So far nothing unusual.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The website thing is only a specific example which may be a violation or not, so for the sake of the argument we assume now we are talking about a real violation of Halakha</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>The situation is as follows: In most cases a Jew is a customer and a gentile is the provider, admin and designer of the website. Other Jews have no influence on this decision and they also have no way to directly influence the website by visiting it.\nSetting up a website running on Sabbath is also very likely a voluntary act, especially if the customer is of Jewish ancestry and non-religious. \"Attractive nuisance\" refers to <em>children</em> which have a limited self-awareness, so it is not a proper comparison.</p>\n\n<p>I really do not see how \"Lifnei iver\" could be applied in this case.</p>\n\n<p>Essentially it is about a situation where a non-religious person of Jewish ancestry violates halakha on purpose and other Jews cannot influence his actions directly.</p>\n\n<p>What are the boundaries of \"Lifnei iver\" in this case ?</p>\n\n\n",

Thus <strong>when they established Purim for generations, they established it for each day that people rested.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ie- the separate celebration (Shushan Purim) was enacted for this reason.</p>\n<p><strong>2) How does celebrating Shushan Purim in Jerusalem \"allow it to retain its importance\"?</strong></p>\n<p>To answer this question, we need to establish why the criteria for celebrating Shushan Purim is based off of cities that were walled during the time of Yehoshua bin Nun vs cities that were walled during the time of Achashveirosh.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"ל דהיינו טעמא <strong>כדי לחלוק כבוד לא\"י</strong> כדאיתא בירוש' ופירוש הענין שכיון שהוצרכו לחלוק בין מוקפין לשאין מוקפין כשם שנחלקה שושן משאר עיירות אילו תלו הדבר מימות אחשורוש <strong>היתה א\"י שהיתה חרבה באותם הימים נדונית כפרזים והיה גנאי בדבר</strong> ולפיכך תלו הדבר בימות יהושע בן נון</p>\n<p>And there are those who say the reason is <strong>in order to give honor to Eretz Yisrael</strong>  like we see in the Yerushalmi. And explaining the matter that since we needed a distinction between walled vs unwalled cities, just as Shushan was separated from other cities, if we based the the requirement from walled cities during the times of Achashveirosh, <strong>it would be an insult to the Land of Israel which then lay in ruins</strong>. Therefore the distinction of walled vs unwalled is based off the days of Yehoshua bin Nun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Beis Yosef seems to suggest that the fundamental reason why Purim was separated into two days was to honor of the Land of Israel.</p>\n<p>Thus celebrating Shushan Purim in Jerusalem is <strong>explicitly</strong> fulfilling the very purpose of why Shushan Purim was enacted- ie allowing Jerusalem to retain its importance.</p>\n\n\n",

The third passage [verse 35] came and reconciled them: “because the cloud rested upon it.” You may henceforth say that as long as the cloud was upon it, he could not enter, [but when] the cloud withdrew, he would enter and [God] would speak with him. -[from Torath Kohanim, Shalosh Esrei Middoth, Thirteen methods, Section 8]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the next pasuk reads </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>36.When the cloud rose up from over the Mishkan, the children of Israel set out in all their journeys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So when there was no cloud, Moshe could NOT have gone in to the tent because that was when the people traveled.</p>\n\n<p>How exactly is Rashi reconciling the two statements (Moshe could not go in, and Moshe did go in) if what he cites flies in the face of another pasuk?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Shemot/40#35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Rashbam</em> on that verse</a> brings the same idea as <em>Rashi</em>, but explains further.  The event that allows <em>Moshe</em> to enter the tent was the cloud being \"reduced\" (מצומצם) such that it only was over the ark (and not the entire tent).  In his words (and my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ולא יכול משה לבא אל אהל מועד</strong> – בשעת הקמתו, <strong>כי שכן עליו הענן</strong> – מיד, להראות חיבתו של הקב״ה על ישראל. אחרי כן היה מסתלק הענן מתוך האהל ושכן על הארון, כדכת' ונועדתי לך שם ודברתי אתך {וגו'} מבין שני הכרובים (שמות כ\"ה:כ\"ב), ואז בא משה אל אהל מועד, כדכת' ובבא משה אל אהל מועד לדבר אתו וישמע את הקול וגו' מבין שני הכרובים וידבר אליו (במדבר ז:פ\"ט). וכן את מוצא בבית עולמים: ולא יכלו הכהנים לעמוד לשרת מפני הענן כי מלא כבוד י\"י את בית י\"י (מלכים א ח':י\"א), בשעת השלמת הבית היה הקב״ה מקדשו בענן, ואחר כך היה מצמצם שכינתו על הארון בין הבדים.  ואשר שם לבו לדבר יוצרינו אל יזוז מנימוקי זקני רבינו שלמה ואל ימוש מהם, כי רוב הלכות ודרשות שבהם קרובים לפשוטי המקראות [ומיתורם או משינוי] הלשון יש ללמוד כולם, וטוב אשר תאחוז בזה אשר פירשתי וגם מזה אל תנח ידך.</p>\n<p><strong>And Moses was unable to enter the Tent of Meeting</strong> – while it was being erected, <strong>for the cloud rested upon it</strong> – immediately, to show God's love for Israel.  After that the cloud removed itself from the Tent and rested upon the ark, as it's written (Ex. 25:22): \"And I will meet with you and speak with you... between the cherubs\", and then Moses entered the Tent of Meeting, as it's written (Num 7:89): \"And when Moses would enter the Tent of Meeting to speak with Him, he would hear the Voice... from between the two cherubs and it would speak to him\".  You will find similarly regarding the Eternal Temple (1 Kings 8:11): \"And the priests were not able to stand and minister because of the Cloud, for the Glory of God filled the House of God\", as the Temple was finished, God sanctified it with the cloud, and later he reduced his Presence to above the ark between the poles.</p>\n<p>He who pays attention to the matters of our Creator should not depart from the explanations of my grandfather Rabbi Shlomo (<em>Rashi</em>), for most of his <em>halachot</em> and <em>drashot</em> are close to the plain meaning of the written text, and from its additions [<em>ie.</em> extra letters/words] or changes of language we can learn them all, and it would be good to accept what I explained and do not ignore it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A poor <em>shochet</em> did, but was so ashamed that he told Bond \"this <em>k'sav kabala</em> is for your eyes only\", so Bond couldn't use it anywhere. Next, he studied up on babirusas and got <em>kabala</em> from the man from Barbarossa, but it was valid only on those animals. Trying again, he got a <em>kabala</em> that allowed him to <em>shecht</em> on condition that the animal thrash about all day and die another day; but of course that's useless.

    "content": "# Mincha as a Custom\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reviewing for shabbos in my Ezras Torah Luach (I read it twice in the Hebrew, and once in the English translation so I feel prepared for shul) and I noticed a subtle difference in the wording. For many other shabbosim, there is no particular mention of Mincha, or if there is, it is just to point out a change in the liturgy (such as whether or not we say Tzidkascha tzedek, as for Shabbos Mishpatim, page 90) and this is folded in to the last line fot the shacharis entry.</p>\n<p>In some rare cases, the construction is different, with mincha having its own entry, with its order delineated, such as for Shabbos Acharei, page 131. In each case, there seems to be a hava amina that there is something special about mincha that requires clarification.</p>\n<p>But for Shabbos Pekudei, the lashon is altered. In the entry for Shacharis, after the haftarah is listed, the text continues (page 97, but I haven't found a link to this on the Hebrew Books website), \"Customary Mincha; three Aliyas in Parshas Vayikra.\"</p>\n<p>If I recall correctly, the masoretic Hebrew says much the same thing (mincha kanoheg...). But I could not figure out what the hava amina would be that would make mincha worthy of any note. Then I looked at the lashon more carefully -- it reads \"Customary\". I haven't looked at the meforshim on this but it seems to be saying that the saying of mincha on that Shabbos is a minhag, though the hava amina would be that one is required to say mincha! Then, by listing the aliyos the text teaches us that even when mincha is a minhag, we can still lein from the torah! This DOES seem like a chiddush to me, but the text doesn't explain <em>why</em> this is the case.</p>\n<p>Why would Shabbos Pekudei only have mincha as a minhag?

An analogy could be if Hashem decrees a punishment by a famine, drought, or plague, people will die unless they are tzadikim enough to merit rescue from the \"destroyer\". In this case as well, once the destroyer was unleashed, it would have required a special miracle (or an extra level of piety - which none of the Egyptian bechorim had) to be spared.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Yalkut Shimoni stateds that a major part of the \"makat Bechorot\" was that the bechorim, fearing that they would die (as did the cattle during dever), rose up in rebellion against their own parents to force them to send the Bnai Yisrael out.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Psalms (136:10), Hashem is praised for “lemakeih Mitzraim\n  bivchoreihem” — “striking the Egyptians through their firstborn.” It\n  does not say that Hashem struck the firstborn of Egypt but rather that\n  He struck the Egyptians through their firstborn. This is explained in\n  the Midrash (Yalkut Shimoni) as follows:</p>\n  \n  <p>Upon hearing that they would be victims of the last plague, the\n  “bechorim” — “firstborn” — insisted that Pharaoh and their parents\n  release the Jews immediately. When their pleas were refused, a civil\n  war broke out and the desperate firstborn attacked and killed their\n  parents and fellow Egyptians. Thus, the tenth plague dealt a double\n  blow to Egypt, killing both firstborn and non-firstborn.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the Haggadah, the ten plagues are listed as “dam,\n  tzefardei’a...makat bechorot” — “Blood, frogs...plague of the\n  firstborn.” The word “makat” is not mentioned for any of the plagues\n  except for “bechorot” — why?</p>\n  \n  <p>It can be explained that Rabbi Yehudah argues with the author of the\n  Haggadah as to what was the major part of the double-blow plague.\n  According to the author of the Haggadah, the main part was “makat” —\n  the smiting of the Egyptians by their own angry and violent “bechorim”\n  — firstborn.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yehudah’s third acronym is \"באח\"ב\". The final \"ב\" stands for\n  “bechorot.” He did not make the acronym \",באח\"מ\" which would have\n  meant, “Makat bechorot,” because in his opinion the major part of the\n  plague was Hashem’s slaying of the firstborn, and not the smiting of\n  the Egyptians by their own firstborn.</p>\n  \n  <p>(הגש\"פ צוף אמרים בשם יסוד התורה)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I just read <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/5358334/jewish/Why-Did-G-d-Smite-the-Firstborn.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Chabad article</a> and it says that the Egyptions regarded firstborns as gods, in the passuk it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will pass through the land of Egypt on this night, and I will smite every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and upon all the gods of Egypt will I wreak judgments I, the L‑rd.

The piece included private\ncorrespondence between the Seridei Esh (R Weinberg) and his friend\nProf. Samuel Atlas of Hebrew Union College. A lot of people were upset\nthat this private correspondence was published, both because of what\nit was in itself: letters between a גדול and his friend who was a\nprofessor at a Reform university, but also because of the content of\nthose letters. Of course other people felt that this is the truth, and\nthe truth is not upsetting, but just true.</p>\n<p>In the next volume, journal editor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_J._Schacter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Dr. J.J.

As a sign of an alpha particle that both exists and doesn't!</p>\n\n<p>And what language where Bigtan and Teresh speaking? <em>Tarshish</em>! That was the destination of Jonah's boat, which means the sailors spoke it. So presumably any speaker of Tarshish understood the phenomenon of tunnelling. As it says, <em>vayachteru ha'anashim</em>!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, at the end of the story the Jews all understood this as well, as they had \"orah, simcha, sason, and yekar\", i.e. \"ORH, SS, YKR\" The acronym can be rearranged as: \"OR HYSSR K'\", an <strong>obvious</strong> reference to the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/361\" rel=\"nofollow\">Or HaYashar about Kleves</a>, written by R' Shimon of Copenhagen!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Well, borrowing Occam's razor for a shave this morning, I think I figured it out:</p>\n\n<p>First of all, the assassins didn't need to construct a special room and convince Achashverosh to go into it - they just used the Royal Bathroom. They hid the atom apparatus and the poison in the ..um.. Royal Wiping Sponge. Since they knew Achashverosh had a habit of having a Royal Constitutional for over 45 minutes each morning, they chose to use Carbon-11, with a half-life of just over 20 minutes, so by the time Achashverosh was done, the atom would no doubt decay and release the poison.  Just to make sure he would be in there long enough, they fed him plenty of Shmureh Matzah and chicken in pectin for dinner the night before.</p>\n\n<p>Mordechai caught wind of the plot and was able to foil the plan because one of his good friends from shul was the University of Shushan's Chemistry Professor, Dr. Schrodinger.  He just had his friend switch the labels on the bottles, so instead of radioactive  Carbon-11, they used plain old stable Carbon-12.  When the assassins showed up suddenly in the Chemistry Department, the Good Doctor looked up from petting his cat and handed them the \"Carbon-11\" they requested. </p>\n\n<p>SO--the next morning, one of the assassins handed Achashverosh the rigged sponge as he went in to use the facilities, and they waited patiently.  Boy, were they surprised when Achashverosh came out of there after over an hour with a big smile and saying he \"felt like a million Darics\"!  Plot foiled, you know the rest from the Megillah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Xi Factor, the entire universe could be smaller than an atom. Relativistically we cannot determine this because we too are shrunken. Once the universe becomes too small to encompass one wavelength of an electromagnetic spectrum, that spectrum can no longer exist in the universe.</p>\n\n<p>This is obviously what happened during makkas choshech.</p>\n\n<p>Achashveirosh was scared of the dark and would have had a heart attack under these circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>Bigsan and Seresh tried to decay an atom near Achashveirosh, not to kill him with radiation, but to measure the wavelengths emitted by the decay to see how close the Xi Factor had come to excluding visible radiation from the universe.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara lets us know the answer to this if the tunneler was יש לו דמים (\"has blood\" = can't be killed). The Gemara says we must save this tunneler's life even on Shabbat. The Gemara doesn't mention though what happens in a case of אין לו דמים. </p>\n\n<p>Regarding the case of אין לו דמים I have the following question. </p>\n\n<p>The tunneler came into the tunnel with 2 חזקות. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>He is alive (physically).</li>\n<li>אין לו דמים.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>My question is as follows:</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to a חזקה most of the time the ruling is as so: If the חזקה is in question, we maintain the original חזקה until we are sure of his new status. \n<strong>But</strong> there is also an idea of <strong>חזקה שהורעה</strong>: this is a weakened חזקה about which we hold (מדרבנן) that we are strict and we do not maintain the previous חזקה. </p>\n\n<p>Example: I threw a marriage document and we aren't sure whether it fell close enough to the woman to have her married. The rabbis say she cannot maintain her previous status of single since they hold it's a חזקה שהורעה.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Final question</strong>: Once the rubble fell we aren't sure if the tunneler is alive (in this case), if he's alive we will hold that he's not a threat to us since he's pinned down by the rocks. \nHe had 2 original חזקות (mentioned above) but now those חזקות are in question for if he's alive then we hold he's no longer a threat and would be liable to be saved, on the other hand maybe he died אין לו דמים. \nAre these חזקות under the category of חזקה שהורעה or are they a regular חזקה for which we would hold its original status during this time of ספק?

I've quoted and translated it for you below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר אחר: החדש הזה לכם, הדא הוא דכתיב (תהילים עב, ז): יפרח בימיו צדיק ורוב שלום עד בלי ירח, עד שלא הוציא הקדוש ברוך הוא את ישראל ממצרים, ברמז הודיע להם, שאין המלכות בא להם עד שלשים דור, שנאמר: החדש הזה לכם ראש חדשים, החדש שלשים יום, ומלכות שלכם שלשים דור. הלבנה בראשון של ניסן מתחלת להאיר, וכל שהיא הולכת מאירה עד חמישה עשר ימים, ודסקוס שלה מתמלא, ומחמישה עשר עד שלשים אור שלה חסר, בשלשים אינה נראית. כך ישראל, חמישה עשר דור מן אברהם ועד שלמה. אברהם התחיל להאיר, שנאמר (ישעיה מא, ב): מי העיר ממזרח צדק יקראהו לרגלו. בא יצחק אף הוא האיר, שנאמר (תהלים צז, א): אור זרוע לצדיק. בא יעקב והוסיף אור, שנאמר (ישעיה י, יז): והיה אור ישראל לאש. ואחר כך, יהודה פרץ חצרון רם עמינדב נחשון שלמון בועז עובד ישי דוד. כיון שבא שלמה, נתמלא דיסקוס של לבנה, שנאמר (דה\"א כט, כג): וישב שלמה על כסא ה' למלך. וכי יוכל אדם לישב בכסאו של הקדוש ברוך הוא, מי שנאמר בו (דניאל ז, ט): כרסיה שביבין די נור?! אלא מה הקדוש ברוך הוא שולט מסוף העולם ועד סופו, ושולט בכל המלכים, שנאמר (תהלים קלח, ד): יודוך ה' כל מלכי ארץ. כן של שלמה, מסוף העולם ועד סופו, שנאמר (דה\"ב ט, כג-כד): וכל מלכי הארץ מבקשים את פני שלמה וגו'. והמה מביאים איש מנחתו, לכך נאמר: וישב שלמה על כסא ה' למלך. הקדוש ברוך הוא לבושו הוד והדר, ונתן לשלמה הוד מלכות, שנאמר (דה\"א שם, כה): ויתן עליו הוד מלכות. בכסאו של הקדוש ברוך הוא, כתיב (יחזקאל א, י): ודמות פניהם פני אדם ופני אריה. ובשלמה כתיב (מ\"א ז, כט): ועל המסגרות אשר בין השלבים אריות בקר. וכתוב אחד אומר ( שם שם, לג): כמעשה אופן המרכבה. בכסאו של הקדוש ברוך הוא אין דבר רע נוגע, שנאמר (תהלים ה, ה): לא יגורך רע. ובשלמה כתיב (מ\"א ה, יח): אין שטן ואין פגע רע. הקדוש ברוך הוא עשה ששה רקיעים, ובשביעי יושב. ובכסאו של שלמה כתיב ( שם י, יט): שש מעלות לכסא ויושב במעלה השביעית, הרי נתמלא דיסקוס של לבנה, ומשם התחילו המלכים פוחתין והולכין. (דה\"א ג, י): ובן שלמה רחבעם, ובן רחבעם אביה, ובנו אסא, יהושפט, יהורם, אחזיהו, יואש, אמציהו, עוזיה, יותם, אחז, יחזקיה, מנשה, אמון, יאשיהו, יהויקים. כיון שבא צדקיהו, דכתיב (ירמיה נב, יא): ואת עיני צדקיהו עור, חסר אורה של לבנה. וכל אותן השנים, אף על פי שהיו ישראל חוטאין, היו האבות מתפללין עליהן, ועושין שלום בין ישראל למקום, שנאמר (תהלים עב, ג): ישאו הרים שלום לעם, ואין הרים אלא אבות, שנאמר (מיכה ו, ב): שמעו הרים את ריב ה'. ועד מתי היו האבות מתפללין עליהן? עד שאבד צדקיהו את עיניו וחרב בית המקדש, שנאמר (תהלים שם, ז): ורב שלום עד בלי ירח, עד שלשים דור שהיה לישראל מן המלכות, מן אותה שעה ועד עתה. מי עושה שלום לישראל? ה', שנאמר (במדבר ו, כו): ישא ה' פניו אליך וישם לך שלום:</p>\n<p>Another interpretation: This month shall be for you (Ex 12:2), this is what's written (Ps 72:7): In his days the righteous will flourish and much peace until the moon is no more. While God had not yet taken Israel out of Egypt, he alluded to them that Kingship would not be theirs for 30 generations, as it's written (Ex 12:2): This month shall be for you the beginning of months. A month is 30 days, and your Kingship will be in 30 generations.  The moon begins to shine at the beginning of the month of Nisan, and it increases its shine and waxes for 15 days, but from the 15th until the 30th it wanes in intensity, and on the 30th it is no longer seen.  So too for Israel: 15 generations from Abraham to Shlomo.  Abraham began to shine, as it says (Is 41:2): Who raised up one from the east, at whose steps victory attends? Then Yitshak also shone, ... then Yaakov, ... Yehuda, Perets, Chetsron, Ram, Aminadav, Nachson, Salmon, Boaz, Oved, Yishai, David.  Once Shlomo arrived, the moon's disc had become full, as it says (1 Chr 29:23): Shlomo sat on the throne of the Lord as king...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The midrash describes the glory of God and Shlomo's kingdom, then continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the son of Shlomo was Rekhavam, and Rekhavam's son was Aviya, and his son Asa, Yehoshafat, Yehoram, Akhazyahu, Yoash, Amatsyahu, Uzziya, Yotam, Akhaz, Yekhizkiya, Menashe, Amon, Yoshiyahu, Yehoyakim.  Once Tsidkiyahu came, as it's written (Jer 52:11): He put out the eyes of Tsidkiyahu, the moon's light diminished.  All those years, even though Israel was sinning, the Forefathers prayed for them and made peace between them and God... until when did the Forefathers pray for them?  Until Tsidkiyahu lost his eyes and the Temple was destroyed, as it's said (Ps 72:7): And much peace until the moon is no more, that is, until 30 generations that Israel had kingship.  From that moment until now, who makes peace for Israel?  God, as it's said (Num 6:26): May God look favourably upon you and give you peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why aren't sufganiot included in the latke-hamantasche debate?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As everybody knows, there is an ancient <em>minhag</em> of debating <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latke%E2%80%93Hamantash_Debate\" rel=\"noreferrer\">whether <em>latkes</em> or <em>hamantaschen</em> are better</a>. But why does this debate not include <em>sufganiot</em>?  I believe that <em>sufganiot</em> should have been included for the following reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It seems strange that the clearly inferior <em>Chanukah</em> food should be chosen to be the one that is compared to <em>hamantaschen</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Sufganiot</em> are generally more similar to <em>hamantaschen</em> than <em>latkes</em> are, which makes the debate more interesting as the debaters must consider subtle details.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To me, it seems that <em>sufganiot</em> should have been chosen instead of <em>latkes</em> or <strong>at least</strong> in addition to them.  So why was the <em>minhag</em> not established that way?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source for eating sufganiyot is the letter of the Rambam's father R. Maimon in which he <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22994&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow\">describes</a> the tradition of eating sufganiyot: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ופשט המנהג לעשות סופגנין...והם הצפחיות בדבש</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, sufganiyot <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%98%D7%96_%D7%9C%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">correspond to the manna</a>. A debate about whether sufganiyot are superior to hamentaschen would replicate the debate <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%AA%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A2_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">between Turnus Rufus and R. Akiva</a> over which is superior, the creations of God or of man. R. Akiva's victory in that debate would make this superfluous. (This would also explain why we eat sufganiyot on Chanukah, which stands for the open miracle of divine intervention, in contrast to the hidden miracle of Purim in which all events seemingly stem from human action.) </p>\n\n<p>Instead, the debate centers on the hamentaschen (which must be filled with poppy seed, an opiate product popular in the Persian empire)  and the latke, made of fried potatoes and onions. Here, the focus of the debate is about the external vs. the internal--fried foods represent the external <em>hashpa'ah</em> of the oil which gives them their flavor (no one eats raw potatoes or onions, but once they are fried in oil they too become delicious), and the hamentaschen represent the process of <em>hashpa'ah</em> from inside to out. (Cf. Bnei Yissaschar on the symbolism of the dreidl, with its handle from above.) Thus the real question of the hamentaschen vs. latke debate is whether spiritual growth should be centripetal or centrifugal, which would have been obscured had the debate focused on sufganiyot instead. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In actuality, <em>sufganiyot</em> could never be compared to <em>hamantaschen</em>, for they are one and the same, as first mentioned by Ibn Kaspi, cited by the Abarbanel, and then again by the <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2007/02/eliezer-brodt-origins-of-hamentashen-in.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">SeforimBlog</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וצפיחית הוא מאכל הקמח מבושל בשמן כצורת צפחת המים הנאכל בדבש והוא כמו\n  הרקיקים העושים מן הבצק כדמות אזנים מבושלות בשמן ויטבלו אותם בדבש\n  ויקראוהו אזנים</p>\n  \n  <p>And <em>tzappichit</em> is the foodstuff of flour cooked in oil, like the form of the jug of water, that is eaten with honey and it is like the wafers made with dough like the form of the ears cooked in oil and they dipped them in honey and they called them \"Ears\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Al pi sod</em>, this is because Chanuka and Purim themselves are really one and the same, which can be seen in the overlapping themes of the <em>parshiot</em> read on their adjacent <em>Shabbatot</em> (e.g. Yosef appointed viceroy like Mordechai, read on Chanukah; <em>Torat Kohanim</em> read near Purim, etc.).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As you know, in U.S.A., at least, people are becoming more health-conscious. Baked foods are considered healthier than fried foods.</p>\n\n<p>Im contrasting the health benefits of two foods, doctors and nutritionists generally contrast the greatest extremes that they can find amd / or \"appeal\" to the public. The public probably won't see the contrast to sufganiyot, even though they are fried. But, most people assume that they are a type of cake or pastry which is similar to hamantaschen which is also a cake, pastry or cookie.</p>\n\n<p>To emphasize the dangers of eating fried food, nutritionists would choose something that people readily know is fried, which why latkes are chosen as the contrasting food.</p>\n\n\n",

On similar to this the sages said: \"we do not assume any defect without cause\" (Chulin 56b). And \"a judge need be guided only by that which his eyes see\" (Bava Batra 131a). This itself is the intent of the verse we brought earlier \"the clever man sees the evil and hides himself\" (Mishlei 22:3), which states only about escaping from the evil that one can see not of the evil which perhaps, possibly, may occur. This is precisely like the verse brought earlier \"the lazy man says there is a lion in the way..\" (Mishlei 26:13).

    "content": "# What is the function of \"Eloheinu\" in blessings?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many blessings open with the familiar formula:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ברוך אתה יהוה אלהינו מלך העולם  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In additions, many blessings close with the familiar shorter formula:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ברוך אתה יהוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, we know (Berakhot 40b, Rambam Berakhot 1:5, ShA OC 214) that a proper blessing needs to contain mention of both God's name and His kingship (Shem uMalkhut). Clearly \"יהוה\" is a part of the former of those requirements and \"מלך העולם\" is a part of the latter. Where does \"אלהינו\" fit in?</p>\n\n<p>On the one hand, אלהינו is a name of God which cannot be erased (Rambam Yesodei 7:2, ShA YD 276:9) so it seems to be part of the \"Shem\" part of the formulation. Mishna Berura (214 sk 4) rules that אלהינו alone can function as the Shem in a blessing. Indeed the combo \"יהוה אלהינו\" appears quite frequently in Tanakh (with conjunctive Trop on the first word), and, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/19129/759\">even when unwarranted, people automatically run them together</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in the shorter closing formulation of longer blessings the chosen name of God to use is not \"יהוה אלהינו\" but just \"יהוה\". I can accept that Malkhut need not be mentioned again at the conclusion, but why should only part of the Shem be left out? It's worth noting that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/57716/759\">the name אלהינו has associations with Divine Judgement</a> which in a certain sense fits more with Malkhut than Shem.</p>\n\n<p>I note that in many prayer books there are Trop marks on the blessing preceding the Haftarah, opening with בר֨וך את֤ה יהוה֙ אלהינו֙ מ֣לך העול֔ם which, by putting the primary division on יהוה, indicates אלהינו is part of the latter phrase. However, these notes are of unknown origin and clearly do not conform to the regular rules of Trop (you can't have two Pashtas in a row unless they follow a Revi'i; I suspect the notes were just lifted from <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c25a29.htm#10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chronicles 1:29:10</a> without much thought to context). Hence, I don't think this should be taken as conclusive evidence.</p>\n\n<p>I note as well that in my experience, those who say \"Barukh Hu Uvarukh Shemo\" when hearing God's name in a blessing (cf. OC 124:5) do so after hearing the word יהוה but before the word אלהינו (eg. during the Chazzan's recitation of the morning blessings), indicating a separation in the blessing. As before though, this could be a carryover from, for example, the repetition of the Shemoneh Esrei where that phrase is regularly used in the context of the shorter closing formulae of blessings.</p>\n\n<p>So which side is it? Is \"אלהינו\" in a standard blessing part of the Shem or part of the Malkhut? If part of the Shem, then why leave it off in the closing formula and pause between the two halves of the Shem? Proofs from earlier sources (≥Rishonim) are especially sought.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From the Kabale point of view, Elokeinu refers to Gvurah, which is usually translated into rigor and justice.</p>\n\n<p>This world is under Gvurah attribute (Yalkut shim'oni). </p>\n\n<p>Malkhut isn't Gvurah : Malkhut is reign. In fact, it is the attribute that is above and below in Sder Hischtalchelous. Which means Malkhut transfers all 9 attributes above her to the world below. </p>\n\n<p>Then one knows why Elokeinu comes in this order: Malkhut is below (and above as well) the Gvurah attribute. However, making a blessing means elevating a profane object to being Kadosh. For this reason, you refer to all successive levels of Gd presence into the blessing, and there you go : Malkout is under Gvurah, in that case. </p>\n\n<p>Now, Elokeinu functions as a common denomination in scriptures to describe forces that can be considered as divinities by men ('asseret diberos, parachas Kedochim...). So, it could appear not directly linked to Jews Gd. </p>\n\n<p>However, Elokeinu is undoubtedly a Name; which has the Gmatria <em>Hateva'</em> (the Nature), and is the expression of Gd under the Gvurah attribute. Also, it is said \"Havaye hou haElokim\".</p>\n\n<p>The fact that it can be used to describe other divinities as well is a proof of the fact that Gd's presence under those circumstances is a bit hidden. Elokim is hence <strong>a denomination of a leading divinity</strong>. This is the most direct reference for men who accept it as such. You hence got a \"neutral\" divinity on one side, and a direct proof of reign on the other (since it is also an attribute expression). </p>\n\n<p>So that Elokeinu is both Malkhut and a Shem. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It seems that we learn from the Mishna Berurah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.214.4?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">214:4</a>) that it is part of \"Shem\", rather than \"Malchut\", as it suffices for that.</p>\n<p>I agree that there is no reason to trust the trop to reach a different conclusion, and I note that in the <em>halacha</em>, the only two principles at work are that Berachot must contain <em>Shem U'Malchut</em>.</p>\n<p>There is a discussion about the pasuk</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And you shall know today and take it unto your heart, that Havayah is\nthe E-lohim in the heavens above and the earth below; there is nothing\nelse [Devarim 4:39]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>going back to discussions centered around Rambam's formulation of Mitzvot. The conclusion of these discussions is that this is the specific way to fulfil the mitzva of Yichud Hashem. This is <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58882&st=&pgnum=242&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a very deep esoteric discussion</a>, which cannot be elaborated in detail here, but the crux of it is that Hashem and Elokim are the same, rather than two distinct Gods, <em>chas veshalom</em>. I.e. the God who transcends nature and limitation, and the God who we relate to in creation are one and the same and there is no difference.</p>\n<p>This is connected to the concept outlined in this Rishonic statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין סוף הוא שלימות בלי חסרון וא\"ת שיש לו כח בלי גבול ואין לו כח בגבול\nאתה מחסר שלימותו</p>\n<p>The Limitless One is perfect without any deficiency, and if you were to say that He has power over the infinite, but not the finite, you are detracting from His perfection</p>\n<p>-ביאור עשר ספירות, רבי עזריאל מגרונה ז\"ל c.1175  – c.1235 CE</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is therefore taught by the Arizal and associated schools of thought (Shelah Sha'ar HaOtyot, Pri Eitz Chaim Sha'ar HaBerachot or Sha'ar HaTefillah, and references in the Alter Rebbe’s Siddur; see also Sefer HaRokeach on Berachot and Siddur, as well as Avudraham etc) that we add the word \"Elokeinu\" to ensure we are \"unifying Hashem's Name\" whenever we say a <em>beracha</em>. This doesn't need to be repeated, so we don't say it at the end, nor is is part of the original halachic requirement for Shem U'Malchut, so doesn't always need to be there.</p>\n<p>It seems very likely that \"baruch hu u'varuch shemo\" being only after Havaya and not Elokeinu, is purely because we very often do not say Elokienu, so it is standardised in response to the most common formulation of saying the \"Shem\".</p>\n<p>For bonus: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.16?lang=he&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Ramban says</a> that the purpose of creation is \"to gather and say tefilla to Hashem, admitting and thanking Him for creating us\". The world \"Elokeinu\", \"our God\", is indeed a way to do that, so we are fulfilling the purpose of creation every time we say a <em>beracha</em> with Elokeinu!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: not a huge amount we can glean from purely halachic discussions, but our poskim did discuss the hashkafa, and if we put it all together, we can reasonably conclude that the purpose of <strong>Elokeinu</strong> in berachot is to unify Hashem, and fulfil the purpose of creation, every time we say a blessing! This is a bonus, so isn't strictly part of the halachic requirements of a blessing, which explains the anomalies raised in OP.</p>\n\n\n",

The question is, would the Kohanim really want to kill everyone? The answer, unfortunately, is yes. As we learn in Shmuel Alef 22:17:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר המלך... סבו והמיתו כהני יהוה</p>\n  \n  <p>And the king said... \"Turn and kill, O Kohanim of Hashem.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the next Pasuk tells us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וימת ביום ההוא שמנים וחמשה איש </p>\n  \n  <p>And eighty-five men died that day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, it was necessary to tell the Kohanim not to kill Bnei Yisrael.    </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would consider this part of Rav Dessler's Nekudat Habechirah.

He \"couldn't believe he ate the whole thing\", and Alka-Seltzer wasn't available then, so the indigestion from eating all that meat nearly paralyzed him, causing him to cry out \"It was the Lama\" when they tried to rouse him to action.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this clears things up - he was definitely on the Israelites' side, providing noshes as necessary during those tough days in Mitzraim..</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As always, our heilege zemiros recount <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLH63cR_3PM\" rel=\"nofollow\">the many llamos</a> our forefathers dealt with on their exodus from Egypt:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Here's a llama|\n  There's a llama|\n  And another little llama|\n  Funny llama|\n  Fuzzy llama|\n  llama llama duck.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The first llama we see is in 2:13 - לָמָּה תַכֶּה, רֵעֶךָ. This violent animal compelled Moshe to flee Egypt on the back of another llama that threw him off as he approached the house of Yitro (2:20) - לָמָּה זֶּה עֲזַבְתֶּן אֶת-הָאִישׁ. Notice that these first two llamos are both female, and may in fact be the same llama.</p>\n\n<p>This misbehavior might be the reason Moshe chooses to return to Egypt on a donkey rather than a llama.</p>\n\n<p>The theme of camelids continues in the 5th perek, where we see a duality in the nature of llama:</p>\n\n<p>5:22 אֲדֹנָי, לָמָה הֲרֵעֹתָה לָעָם הַזֶּה--לָמָּה זֶּה, שְׁלַחְתָּנִי</p>\n\n<p>Moshe is clearly confused - while one llama seems to be oppressing the people, the other is operating as a divine agent in sending Moshe to Pharaoh. This is evident from the previous two possukim:</p>\n\n<p>5:4 לָמָּה מֹשֶׁה וְאַהֲרֹן, תַּפְרִיעוּ אֶת-הָעָם מִמַּעֲשָׂיו </p>\n\n<p>The llama here comes even before Moshe and Aharon - this is the llama that sends them.</p>\n\n<p>5:15 לָמָּה תַעֲשֶׂה כֹה, לַעֲבָדֶיךָ</p>\n\n<p>And here is the llama that does evil to the people!</p>\n\n<p>Moshe himself struggled to comprehend this, asking Hashem to reveal to him: למה יש צדיק ורע לו, רשע וטוב לו \"Why is there a good llama who has bad things happen to it, and a bad llama who has good things happen to it?\"</p>\n\n<p>Both of these llamos seem to have died during the plagues, as they fail to reappear until after the Jews have left Egypt. In fact, the Torah itself notes their absence: וַיָּבֹאוּ אֵילִמָה 15:27 \"And they came, [but] where was the llama?\"</p>\n\n<p>Shortly thereafter, the aforementioned good llama finds the Jewish people once again in the midbar: לָמָּה זֶּה הֶעֱלִיתָנוּ מִמִּצְרַיִם 17:3</p>\n\n<p>This good malach-llama also manifests the anger of Hashem for the sin of the Golden calf: 32:11 וַיֹּאמֶר, לָמָה יְהוָה יֶחֱרֶה אַפְּךָ בְּעַמֶּךָ  \"The llama of Hashem is getting angry at the nation.\"</p>\n\n<p>Simultaneously, another llama was aiding Moshe in his plea for saving the fledgling Jewish nation: 32:12 לָמָּה יֹאמְרוּ מִצְרַיִם לֵאמֹר \"The llama says the Egyptians will say...\"</p>\n\n<p>We are beginning to understand the dual nature hidden within the llama, as an embodiment of both Din and Rachamim. The divine llama, like Moshe himself, is primarily concerned with the preservation and sanctification of heaven. That is why sometimes it will punish the nation and other times intercede on their behalf!</p>\n\n<p>In remembrance of the greatness of the llama, we commemorate a stone of the Choshen in its honor: 28:19 וְהַטּוּר, הַשְּׁלִישִׁי--לֶשֶׁם שְׁבוֹ, וְאַחְ לָמָה </p>\n\n\n",

It cannot be the second one, because [the first condition there] is nullified?  Rather it is the first one. But in this case it is self-evident?  — You might think that all [the witnesses who can help] to establish that there was a condition can be joined together. We are therefore told [that this is not so]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains the first issue saying,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אילימא אסיפא - פשיטא דאין אחד מן הראשונים כלום שהרי אפילו באו שניהם אינן כלום דהא בטיל ליה ההוא תנאה.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>It's obvious that one of the first set of witnesses can't count for anything, since even if they were both here their witness wouldn't be worth anything being that the first condition is already nullified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>And now, for the question</h2>\n\n<p>Rashi says there that even if both of the first witnesses were here it would be meaningless. But, if we only have the first two witnesses, informing us of the original condition, how would we know of the second condition which overwrote the first?</p>\n\n<p>And if we know through the second pair then we already know about the condition and there is no further purpose for the whole conversation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rashi says there that even if both of the first witnesses were here it\n  would be meaningless. But, if we only have the first two witnesses,\n  informing us of the original condition, how would we know of the\n  second condition which overwrote the first?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi here means that we can assume that the Gemara would not mention the second group disqualifying the first unless they were available. That is, given that the event happened, then there must have been witnesses and we would know about it. That is, the wife could say <code>\"My husband said this in front of the witnesses as he handed it to me\"</code> so we know the second pair exists. Similarly, we cannot even consider the idea of one of each pair testifying unless we already know about both pairs.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi is saying that the situation of one of each pair of witnesses being available to testify can only take place where the two pairs of witnesses (given all four are there) would be valid. That is, whichever condition that she chooses to fulfill would have a pair of witnesses that confirms that it is a valid condition. In that case, the two pairs do not contradict each other nor show that the other pair has been nullified.</p>\n\n<p>That is why the case of one from each pair testifying has to be considered. The answer is that even though they each testify that a valid condition was specified, since they are different conditions, they cannot join together.</p>\n\n<p>An example if the original condition was serve or pay then either is valid but there must be two witnesses who heard whichever part she actually fulfills.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here is the text of Rashi.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין אחד מן הראשונים ואחד מן האחרונים מצטרפין אהייא אילימא אסיפא הרי בטל אלא ארישא פשיטא מהו דתימא כל לקיומא תנאי מצטרפין קמ\"ל:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>מהו דתימא - הואיל ומקיים גיטא בחד מהני תנאי הוו להו כחד תנאה וכל סהדי דמסהדי לקיומי תנאה דהאי גיטא ליצטרפו קא משמע לן:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If you read on accurately.  To create a valuable group of witnesses we need two witnesses with a common testimony.  In the first case   (to help my father, to give 200 zuz) there is a condition anyway, what is the condition? or to help his father or to give 200 zuz. In Hava Amina each witness testimonies to the fact that there is a condition. But obviously if both groups of  witnesses came they help to reach an exact description of the condition: a condition with 2 possibilities. </p>\n\n<p>In the second case the witness from the second group testimonies about the annulation of the first condition.If the second witness says true, the event related by the first witness is irrelevant. Even   if the two witnesses of the first group came together,  <strong>according to the two witnesses of the second group</strong>,  the first group is  halachically irrelevant. After the  Chazara,  there is no first condition. So the value of one witness from the first group cannot be additioned to the value of one witness of the second group.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It might be possible to understand Rashi as simply making the point of how worthless someone of the first pair of witness is. Even if they were both in front of us, their testimony wouldn't be worth anything. It wouldn't be necessary either once we have the second set (through whom we know of the redacted condition), but besides for being unnecessary we understand that they are nullified as well.</p>\n\n<p>Even though this has no legal ramification, the point is illustrated that we can't use someone of the first set.</p>\n\n<p>Now, once we get to this point, we can even find legal ramifications as well. If they become Zomemin these two of the first set would not be flogged, since not only are they extra but they aren't witness at all.</p>\n\n\n",

It's a fair enough question. </p>\n\n<p>The kaddish quote is unrelated, so let me explain that one. Say we have parents Abraham and Sarah, and their son Isaac. Sarah dies, and Isaac walks into synagogue and starts saying kaddish. Abraham hears his son saying kaddish and gets panic attacks as it reminds him of his own mortality, so he asks Isaac to stop. (At least when he's around.) </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>exact same</strong> law would apply if the parents were reversed. Say Abraham dies, and Sarah gets panic attacks hearing Isaac saying kaddish. She can object in the exact same way. (The law was phrased about fathers because more often they'd be hearing kaddish, but the legal concepts are identical.)</p>\n\n<p>As described by other answers, if one's parents are divorced, the child can choose which parent to honor if there's a conflict. The favor only goes to the father if she's currently married to the mother.</p>\n\n<p>So Judaism is not favoring the <em>father</em> over the <em>mother</em>. (If anything, one's core status of Jew-or-not depends on one's mother!) There, does, however, seem to be some legal weight favoring <em>husband</em> over <em>wife</em>. That can also be hard to understand, but I'd recommend asking that as a separate question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Kidushin 30B</p>\n\n<blockquote> It was taught: Rabbi said: It is revealed and known to Him Who decreed, and the world came into existence,that a son honours his mother more than his father, [31A] because she sways him by words; therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, placed the honour of the father before that of the mother.\nIt is revealed and known to Him Who decreed, and the world came into existence, that a son reverences his father more than his mother, because he teaches him Torah, therefore the Holy One, blessed be He, put the fear [reverence] of the mother before that of the father.<br>\nA widow's son asked R`Eliezer: If my father orders, 'Give me a drink of water,' and my mother does likewise, which takes precedence?

Torah does not deny that.</li><li>Respect is a transitive law.

As each of the animals entered the taivah, Noach had to welcome each one of them individually even though they arrived in Pears.

We <strong>should</strong> be saying some type of food bracha on tefillin, because after all, one of the verses relating to tefillin says:</p>\n\n<p>Exodus 13:9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְהָיָה֩ לְךָ֨ לְא֜וֹת עַל־יָדְךָ֗ וּלְזִכָּרוֹן֙ בֵּ֣ין עֵינֶ֔יךָ\n  <strong>לְמַ֗עַן תִּהְיֶ֛ה תּוֹרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בְּפִ֑יךָ</strong> כִּ֚י בְּיָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה\n  הוֹצִֽאֲךָ֥ יְהֹוָ֖ה מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And it shall be for a sign unto thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial\n  between thine eyes, <strong>that the law of the LORD may be in thy mouth</strong>;\n  for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since the tefillin contain words of the Torah, a great way to put the Torah in your mouth would be to eat your tefillin. And, of course, since the tefillin are called \"pear\", and we're not supposed to eat anything without making a bracha first, we <strong>should</strong> be saying <em>Borei Pri Ha'etz</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The reason we don't eat our tefillin is because if we did, we would be erasing G-d's name. It's not the chewing of the tefillin that would be the main problem. The acid in the stomach would completely destroy G-d's name, and we're not allowed to do that. Therefore, we have to wear these pears on our arms and heads and deal with these fruit on our bodies.</p>\n\n\n",

But we see that this stiff-necked people is a near-constant burden for him, from Egypt all the way through his final address before his death.  And <em>he</em> had the clear backing of God, complete with a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/69098/472\">physical sign</a>.

There is also a large prevalence of bagpipes.

We blow horns on Moshe's yahrtzeit to commemorate the horns on Moshe's skin as stated:</p>\n\n<p>Exodus 34:29:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיְהִ֗י בְּרֶ֤דֶת מֹשֶׁה֙ מֵהַ֣ר סִינַ֔י וּשְׁנֵ֨י לֻחֹ֤ת הָֽעֵדֻת֙\n  בְּיַד־מֹשֶׁ֔ה בְּרִדְתּ֖וֹ מִן־הָהָ֑ר וּמֹשֶׁ֣ה לֹֽא־יָדַ֗ע כִּ֥י\n  <strong>קָרַ֛ן</strong> ע֥וֹר פָּנָ֖יו בְּדַבְּר֥וֹ אִתּֽוֹ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai with the\n  two tables of the testimony in Moses’ hand, when he came down from the\n  mount, that Moses knew not that the skin of his face sent forth <strong>horns</strong>\n  while He talked with him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wearing green is because regarding Moshe's sister, Miriam, it says:</p>\n\n<p>Numbers 12:14:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה וְאָבִ֙יהָ֙ <strong>יָרֹ֤ק יָרַק֙</strong> בְּפָנֶ֔יהָ\n  הֲלֹ֥א תִכָּלֵ֖ם שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֑ים תִּסָּגֵ֞ר שִׁבְעַ֤ת יָמִים֙\n  מִח֣וּץ לַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה וְאַחַ֖ר תֵּאָסֵֽף׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the LORD said unto Moses: ‘If her father had made her face greenish, should she not hide in shame seven days? let her be shut up without the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again.’</p>\n\n<p>Miriam was envious of Moshe's beautiful wife, and usuall envious people are green. But since Miriam became leprous, she turned white instead of green, and Moshe prayed for Miriam's healing. Moshe was a humble man, so in the merit of his prayers, even though G-d had said, \"If only her father would have made her green\", that would have happened, when she was envious. However, since she was envious of such a humble person such as Moshe, she turned white instead of green, all in Moshe's merit.</p>\n\n<p>The drinking <em>minhag</em> is easier to explain. Moshe's yahrtzeit is exactly 1 week before Purim. Getting drunk on this date is practice for Purim. (Note, that drinking on Moshe's yahrtziet is not a universal minhag. Some people are not allowed to get drunk for health reasons, and others can drink a ton of beer and never get drunk.) However, we want to guarantee that there is at least one Shabbat between Moshe's yahrtzeit and Purim so that people can rest from their stupor and let it wear off. If it were less than a week, people might still be drunk when reading the Megilla if there was no intervening Shabbat. More than 1 week, and they might feel out of practice. Also, beer, the cheapest alcoholic beverage, loses almost all of its strength after a week. Thus, the minhag to drink on Moshe's yahrtzeit, a week before Purim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This was the cause of Moshe's death.

In any case, even an expression that has an idolatrous origin is permitted to be used when it does not have the same meaning for us. A simple example of this is the use of the name of the month Tammuz (such as in Mishnah Taanit 4:5-6), even though its origin is idolatrous (see Ezekiel 8:14 and Daat Mikra commentary there, and in Moreh Nevuchim 3:29, which connects the name of the month to the name of the idol; see also Schwartz's edition there, note 47). It is possible, however, that there is a reason to avoid doing so (and see Tzitz Eliezer 8:8:8 and 9:14:4, which states that it is preferable to avoid mentioning the names of the Christian calendar months, which were named after idols). In general, it is preferable to avoid using vague expressions whose literal meaning is not given much thought. However, it is possible to intend to give these words a positive meaning: not \"I hold my fingers as a sign of your success\" but \"I hold your fingers,\" like the original Hebrew expression for support - \"hold your hand\" (Zechariah 8:9; Ezra 1:6; Sheviit 5:9) or \"hold your right hand\" (Isaiah 41:13; 45:1).</p>\n<p>If it is indeed discussing the expression, it would seem that it would be permitted to use the expression in a general way, without specifying that one is doing so as a form of hoping for luck etc., but just as some kind of moral support, like \"I've got your back\".</p>\n\n\n",

Given the\n  similarities between Cairo and Israeli nusachos, it is assumed to have\n  been the Nusach Eretz Yisrael in the days of the tannaim and Israeli\n  amora’im. Another indication is that Nusach Provence, the berakhah was\n  always “Shalom Rav“. The Provencial community, which was a true center\n  of Jewish Life and Torah in the days of the rishonim, had a strong\n  tradition of being refugees from the Roman conquest of Israel. In\n  fact, the Jews of Luneil had a tradition that they were descendants of\n  the city of Yericho. The name “Luneil” is from “luna” (French: moon)\n  in the same way “Yericho” would be from “yareiach” (Hebrew: moon).\n  Whether or not this tradition is historically true, it does reflect\n  the community’s roots in Israel. So it would seem Shalom Rav was the\n  Nusach Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is one of a number of cases where Sepharadim follow Nusach Bavel\n  and Ashkenazim find a compromise between Nusach Bavel and Nusach Eretz\n  Yisrael. Among many historians, these cases are caused by the number\n  of captives from Eretz Yisrael taken back to Italy by the Roman army,\n  whose descendants then go up to Ashkenaz in Charlemagne’s day.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Provencal community ended up joining Ashkenaz. The bulk of\n  Ashkenazic Jewry, though, were invited up from Italy by Charlemagne,\n  who needed an economic backbone for the heart of the Holy Roman\n  Empire. But many of these Italian Jews were also descendents of\n  Israel; many taken back to Rome with the departing armies.</p>\n  \n  <p>Another example is the preservation of the Israeli nusach by saying it\n  in only some situations is “LeDor vaDor“, using it instead of “Atah\n  Qadosh” when saying Qedushah.

(a) our material sensuous\n       bodies, like the rest of the created visible world = 6; (b) the\n       breath of free will, invisible, coming from the Invisible One = 7;\n       (c) the calling of Jew, coming from the historical choice of Israel\n       = 8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Jews entered a covenant to assume a role as a \"kingdom of priests\".\n   This priesthood requires reminding the world of the notion of \"8\", so\n   that the world can get beyond the physical \"6\" and reach the\n   free-willed, created, human, sanctity of \"7\". Eight is therefore not\n   above all of creation, but beyond this universe. Eight represents\n   man's ability to rise to angelic heights -- yes an image of growth,\n   but not unobtainable. Man connects two worlds, eight connects those\n   worlds. (Which is why the letter chet, the eighth letter, is drawn in\n   the Torah as two copies of the seventh, zayin, connected by a bridge.)</p>\n\n<p>Which is why the laws of the covenant G-d made with Noah and thereby\n   all of humanity are grouped into <em>seven</em> commandments, and the sign of\n   that covenant is seen in the seven-colored rainbow.</p>\n\n<p>For Rav Samson Rephael Hirsch, the week gives meaning to the numbers\n   six and seven. The Maharal, though, finds that the week itself is\n   based on a more primary idea. He attributes the symbolism of six and\n   seven to the structure of space: When you look closely you will find\n   that the physical has six opposing sides, which are: top and bottom,\n   right and left, front and back. All these six sides are related to the\n   physical, because each side has extent, and limits physical objects.\n   But, it also has in it a seventh, and this is the middle, which has no\n   exposure on any side. Because it is not related to any side it is like\n   the non-physical, which has no extension [takes up no volume of\n   space]. (Gevuros Hashem 46)</p>\n\n<p>Six, then, is the physical world. Not so much evil as something we need a seventh to harness, and an eight toward which to grow. A tool that will hopefully be used for good, not good or evil in-and-of itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Au contraire - <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/489/shisha-mi-yodeya\">Here</a> you can see many things which are positive in Judaism for the number six.</p>\n\n\n",

I can't understand why they feel it's necessary to do this, and they really shouldn't do it this Shabbat.</p>\n<p>What's a good way to tell women that they really should not attend shul on שבת זכר and leave the men alone this week?</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is the Shabbat that everyone is treated like a man. As it says in Bereishis זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בָּרָא אֹתָם Thus we are remembering the original creation so that everyone is supposed to come to shul so as to show this.</p>\n\n<p>Another explanation is that we are told that Amalek was male and that it was the men of that nation who were the ones who attacked (Devarim 25:17). Thus the women come to shul to show that they were not involved in the attack and to remind the men that they need to consult the women before doing something that turns out wrong.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To further the original question, 'שבת זכור' is wordplay on the Pasuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זכור את יום השבת לקדשו</p>\n<p>Remember the Shabbat day for <strong>his</strong> holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it appropriate that only men should come to shul on Shabbat Zachor.</p>\n<p>However, the women began to feel left out and forgotten. Thus, they tried to change the name to שבת זכירה, the 'Shabbat of <strong>her</strong> remembrance'. The Gemara in Megillah 2b states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אשכחן עשייה זכירה מנלן</p>\n<p>We have found the practice of making a (Shabbat) Zechira-- from where is the source?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara answers based on a Pasuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והימים האלה נזכרים ונעשים איתקש זכירה לעשייה</p>\n<p>'And these days are Zechira-d and practiced'-- it connects Zechira to actual practice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is a stamp of approval on the practice of שבת זכירה. However, the Gemara continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דלא כי האי תנא דתניא רבי יהושע בן קרחה אומר כרכין המוקפין חומה מימות אחשורוש קורין</p>\n<p>(This ruling) is not like this tanna (R' Yehoshua ben Levi), as Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, taught: (Only) cities walled from the time of Achashverosh read (the verse in this manner).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, the Sanhedrin was centered in Teveria, about which we learn in a different discussion (ibid. 5b):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חזקיה קרי בטבריא בארביסר ובחמיסר מספקא ליה אי מוקפת חומה מימות</p>\n<p>Chizkiyah read (the Megillah) in Teveria on the fourteenth and the fifteenth, from the doubt over whether it was walled from the time (of Achashveirosh; reading megillah on the 15th and reading the Pasuk as sanctioning שבת זכירה are a package deal for walled cities).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Teveria-based Sanhedrin were unsure which way they were supposed to read the Pasuk. As such, we ended up with a compromise: Women can come to shul on this Shabbat, but it would be called by its original name, שבת זכור.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Remember also Shamor v Zachor b'dibur echad.</p>\n\n<p>So this is also Shabbat Shamor, and perhaps put guards in place. That might be used to prevent women attending.</p>\n\n<p>Incidentally, Shaul applied the principle of G'zeira Shava to the Zachor in \"et yom hashabat l'kadsho\" and Amalek, therefore, as well as remembering Amalek, he kept Agag in chains to observe the \"Shamor\" part.</p>\n\n\n",

Technically, the entire nation \"converted\" by accepting the torah and became a \"religion\" as well as a nation. After that, if a person wanted to join Bnai Yisrael, they had to go through the formal procedure before a bais din, go to the mikavah, and if a male, have a bris milah. Before then thre was no official bais din, but we see that they had to join the family of Avraham Avinu, which implies accepting Hashem and having bris milah, but in the way that Avraham converted the men and Sarah converted the women.</p>\n\n<p>That is, before matan torah, just as the avos accepted the mitzvos as \"ainah metzuva ve-osa\", so too their students and those who married into the family accepted it on that basis. After matan torah, they had to undergo conversion in the same way that Bnai Yisrael did at Har Sinai. We learn the methodology from Rus. Technically, from that time on conversion was the same way as we do it today.</p>\n\n<p>We learn this, not only from Rus, but from the stories of Hillel and Shamai and the geirim that Shamai rejected because he thought they were mocking Judaism and Hillel accepted because he saw how to bring them in.</p>\n\n\n",

About another tree of life God said \"Ye shall not eat it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die\" (B'reishit 3:3), which order Adam and Chava disobeyed.  So if we know what <em>b'racha</em> they made when eating the tree of life, we apply the rule of <em>gzeira shava</em> to know what <em>b'racha</em> you should make when you eat the torah.</p>\n\n<p>So, what <em>b'racha</em> did they say?  The talmud addresses this on B'rachot 40a.  R. Meir says that the Tree of Life was a vine (so <em>borei p'ri hagafen</em>), but R' Nechemiah says it was the fig tree (so <em>borei p'ri ha-eitz</em>).  But R' Yehudah says it was wheat, and there is a discussion of whether we say <em>adamah</em> or <em>eitz</em> over wheat, with <em>adamah</em> winning.</p>\n\n<p>So we have a <em>makhloket</em>, except that the same <em>daf</em> also tells us that if you were supposed to make <em>eitz</em> and instead made <em>adamah</em> you've still fulfilled the obligation.  So according to two of the three, <em>borei p'ri ha-adamah</em> is appropriate.  Since it's two to one we can disregard R' Meir's position.</p>\n\n<p>So Adam and Chava, seeking to fulfill the law except for that one little detail about not eating in the first place, said <em>ha-adamah</em>, and by inference, so should you.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When in doubt, we look to precedents.  In this case, we find one in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1203.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezekiel 3:1-3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮‏וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֔י בֶּן־אָדָ֕ם אֵ֥ת אֲשֶׁר־תִּמְצָ֖א אֱכ֑וֹל אֱכוֹל֙ אֶת־הַמְּגִלָּ֣ה הַזֹּ֔את וְלֵ֥ךְ דַּבֵּ֖ר אֶל־בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ ‏וָאֶפְתַּ֖ח אֶת־פִּ֑י וַיַּ֣אֲכִלֵ֔נִי אֵ֖ת הַמְּגִלָּ֥ה הַזֹּֽאת׃ ‏וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֗י בֶּן־אָדָם֙ בִּטְנְךָ֤ תַֽאֲכֵל֙ וּמֵעֶ֣יךָ תְמַלֵּ֔א אֵ֚ת הַמְּגִלָּ֣ה הַזֹּ֔את אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲנִ֖י נֹתֵ֣ן אֵלֶ֑יךָ וָאֹ֣כְלָ֔ה וַתְּהִ֥י בְּפִ֖י כִּדְבַ֥שׁ לְמָתֽוֹק׃</p>\n<p>And He said unto me: 'Son of man, eat that which thou findest; eat this scroll, and go, speak unto the house of Israel.' So I opened my mouth, and He caused me to eat that scroll. And He said unto me: 'Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this scroll that I give thee.' Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What Ezekiel ate was not a Torah scroll, but nevertheless, it was a God-given scroll, so we can make an analogy from here.  We see that this scroll was \"as honey\" (כדבש).</p>\n<p>There is a <em>makhloket</em> as to what extent the scroll is \"as honey\".  There are some who say that it was like honey <em>mamash</em>, and thus the <em>bracha</em> would be שהכל.  There are some who say no, but rather: where else do we find that some food item has a flavour \"like honey\"?  By the manna that the Jews ate in the desert, as it's written (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0216.htm#31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 16:31</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮‏וַיִּקְרְא֧וּ בֵֽית־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל אֶת־שְׁמ֖וֹ מָ֑ן וְה֗וּא כְּזֶ֤רַע גַּד֙ לָבָ֔ן וְטַעְמ֖וֹ כְּצַפִּיחִ֥ת בִּדְבָֽשׁ׃</p>\n<p>And the house of Israel called the name thereof Manna; and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So by these analogies, it follows that the <em>bracha</em> we should say on eating a Torah scroll is the same as that which we said on manna, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/13900/4940\"><em>viz.</em></a> הממטיר/המוציא לחם מן השמים.</p>\n\n\n",

We can do it via a Shaliach.\nIf we give to a Shaliach to use in Israel for example, If they give out the money at 8 Am it is only 1 AM in North America, so we are not yet fulfilling the mitzva. If they use the funds after 3 PM (i.e. on Purim), then it is day in America and still Purim in Israel so that the Matanot L'Evyonim is being used for Purim and we would have fulfilled our obligation and no further donation would be required on Purim in America (I think). But, if the funds are used in Australia then, when they have their seuda it is either night in America or still Taanit Esther? So how could we be fulfilling giving Matanot L'Evyonim on Purim itself?</p>\n\n<p>In this case, it would be given from America when we are not obligated AND used in Australia again before we are obligated. By the time morning arrives in America, Purim is over in Australia or China (unless I guess the seudah there continues throughout the night?). So would one fulfill the mitzvah of Matanot L'Evyonim via this Shaliach who gave the money to Australia or China? If we sent a cheque, then there is no Shaliach and we could not say that the Shaliach is simply an extension of \"us\" as if we are there so the question remains.</p>\n\n<p>Do we fulfill the mitzvah of Matanot L'Evyonim if we send money for this purpose to Australia or other areas who experience night when we have Purim morning either via a Shaliach or \"direct deposit\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If necessary, the Chayei Adam says you can give before Purim as long as it will be enjoyed on Purim. Alternatively, if you wake up on Purim and can't find any poor people that day, you can set aside money on Purim to be given later.</p>\n\n<p>So you'd still get some mitzva if you set up a transfer on your Purim irregardless of the recipients' situation. (Whether ideal is a different question.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer says it is not rosh chodesh anywhere until the chodesh has been niskadesh in Eretz Yisrael, which should make it impossible to say hallel during shacharis on rosh chodesh in Australia — but it's not.</p>\n\n<p>Thus the implication is that halachically (relative to global mitzva observance) we consider the world to be flat (or at least time-zone-less).</p>\n\n<p>Therefore as long as your Purim mitzvos are given on Purim in the local time zone you have done your mitzva.</p>\n\n\n",

Yechiel Michel Epstein</a>. He explains (Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 475:6) that if we only did Korech, we would not fulfill the mitzvah of matzah. Hillel was able to do both matzah and maror together because in his time both were Biblical mitzvos and therefore would not cancel each other out. However, nowadays when maror is only Rabbinic it would cancel out the matzah.</p>\n\n<p>This explains why we need the step of matzah as well as the step of korech. But why do we also need the separate step of maror? Once we already consumed matzah, the matzah in the korech would only be Rabbinic and since both the matzah and the maror are Rabbinic they would not cancel each other out. So the individual step of maror should be unnecessary.</p>\n\n<p>R. Epstein explains (475:7) that according to Hillel himself this would be true. However, we are simply acting out of doubt as to who is correct – Hillel or the Sages. But if the Sages are actually correct then there is no requirement of korech at all. This would mean that while the maror is a Rabbinic mitzvah the matzah is not a mitzvah at all and would therefore cancel out the maror. Thus, in order to fulfill our obligation according to both Hillel and the Sages, we eat matzah and maror independently and then we eat them together.

If you need to prove your Jewish status it sounds like there is other information you could supply besides what they ask for (for example, information about your maternal great-grandmother).

Last year, I used my personal Megillah. When one of the boys came up to read his portion, he looked at my Megillah and was completely lost because the layout in my Megillah was not the same as the shul's Megillah that he had practiced from. (The teenagers are novices, so they can't transition as easily as I can.)</p>\n\n<p>While I didn't do it, I'm wondering if it would have been permissible for me to switch the Megillah in the middle of the reading and use another Megillah? Or must run read only from one Megillah?</p>\n\n<p>Possible considerations / problems why not:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>People may think that the first was passul (non-kosher)</li>\n<li>Intention was to read from the 1st one and bracha was made on that</li>\n<li>Tircha Detzibbur</li>\n<li>Unnecessary interruption (hefsek)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The first question that needs to be addressed is whether you can have two people read the megillah to be yotzei.The Rivevos Ephraim 7:209 was asked this question. The Magen Avraham 692:2 writes that if the one who is reading the megillah loses his voice then the second person taking over has to start from the beginning. From this Magen Avraham it seems certain that one should not do this lechatchilah ,rather if someone loses their voice then one should take over,but must start from the beginning. </p>\n\n<p>However, Shu\"t Aseh Lecha Rav 4:42 writes that one is yotzei bedieved in such a case,and if it is not a bother for the tzibbur the second reader should start from the beginning.The Elya Zuta 692:4 writes that in such a case the second person starts reading from the place the first person stopped,and one doesnt make a new bracha. He compares this to shofar where one does not need to repeat the blasts nor a new bracha. This does not compare to Torah reading which is connected to the brachos which are connected to the individual. This is not like megillah which the bracha is made for the tzibbur. He also notes that the ending bracha is not connected to the megilla per se and therefore a second person can continue the reading from the place the first one left off.</p>\n\n<p>Now to your question,the switching of megillos shouldn't really make a difference since they are both kosher megillos and the mitzvah is to read from a kosher megillah. Also the halacha of not returning the wrong sefer Torah because of the honor of the sefer Torah(Kaf Hachaim 144:13) ,who says this applies to a megillah which is of much lesser kedusha? Tircha d'tziburah is a factor even by a sefer Torah taken out accidentally and in some cases may be returned in order not to inconvenience the tzibuur(Igros Moshe OC 2:37). Regarding brachos ,I think the Elya Zutah can be applied in this case. Regarding hefsek the Shulchan Aruch 690:5 writes even if one paused long enough to finish all of the text still he has fulfilled his obligation. The Rema writes even if he speaks he is yotzei. Tircha D'tziburah is subjective ,since some people may not mind and other might. You have to know your congregation.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the Shulchan Aruch 690:3 writes :  צריך לקרותה כולה ומתוך הכתב ואם קראה על פה לא יצא וצריך שתהא כתובה כולה לפניו לכתחלה <strong>אבל בדיעבד דאם השמיט הסופר באמצעה תיבות אפי' עד חציה וקראם הקורא על פה יצ</strong>א\nOne can technicality read up to half the words of the megilla(depends what parts of the megilla,some are integral and cannot be missing) by heart and be yotzei bedieved.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As far as i know, it would be permitted. The bracha was made on the action of <strong>reading</strong> the megilla. Not on the actual megilla.</p>\n\n\n",

I did not included everything in the text nor all of the footnotes but the sources for which the entire sections can be found are listed at the top before the smaller sections from individual paragraphs are quoted. It seems that the main two reasons have to do with the soul departing from the body, a spirit of impurity that rests upon a person when the soul leaves the body, and the possibility that our hands may have touched any part of our body which would normally be covered. One of the footnotes gives a source that discusses a person who sleeps or naps during the day but I don't have access to it.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch HaRav: Laws Relating to Rising in The Morning (1:1-1:19)</p>\n\n<p>Paragraph 6:\n\"... Since this statement does not include any of the 7 Divine Names (48) that may not be erased, one is not forbidden to recite it before washing his hands. This applies even when he slept naked and his hands presumably touched unclean parts of his body, as will be explained in section 4.</p>\n\n<p>note 48: The Rebbe points outt in Inyaneh shel toras HaChassidus that the recitation of Modeh Ani was instituted after the Talmudic era. In Talmudic times, people recited the blessing that begins Elokai Neshamah immediately upon rising, b/c at that time they \"were holy and could recite a blessing in purity immeditalt upon rising (Rabbeinu Yonah, gloss to Berachos 60b)</p>\n\n<p>Paragraph 7: As explained in the Talmud (berachos 60b) and subsequent halachic authorities {Rambam, hilchos tefillah 3:3, 4:1; Rosh (on Berachos, ch 9) Sec. 23} rule that when a person sleeps in his clothes, it is possible that his hands did not touch the unclean parts of his body; (as the Alter Rebbe writes in his siddur, the parts of the body which are normally covered 92:7) hence his hands are presumably in a sate to speak words of Torah (Rama 47:13)...he should merely refrain from touching food or drink, as explained there. (Rashi on Yoma 77b) Nevertheless, the Zohar (intro page 10b & in parshas vayeishev p 184b) rules very stringently that one should neither recite blessings, nor study, not touch one's garments(53b), nor walk(Eshel Avraham 4:1. also see likkutei sippurim by R. Chaim Mordechai Perlow p. 287) four cubits while the spirit of impurity still rests on one's hangs before they are washed in the morning. A person who walks 4 cubits before washing is liable for his life, for by allowing this impurity to rest upon his hands, he desecrates the sanctity of G-d which rests upon him...\"</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch HaRav: Laws Relating to Washing the Hands: 4:1-4:2</p>\n\n<p>Paragraph 1: Our Sages ordained that one should wash his hands with water every morning and recite the blessing AlNetilas Yadayim, (berachos 60b) The rationale for this ordinance is explained by some (Rosh, Berachos 9:23; Rmbam, hilchos tefilla 4:1) as preperation for the morning recital of shema and shemoneh esrei, for the hands are active (from the responsum of Rav Amram Gaon) and probably touched unclean arts of the body during sleep...\" </p>\n\n<p>\"...but for the reason explicit in the Zohar (arshas Veyeishev) and also mentioned in the Talmud (shabbos 109a) to remove the spirit of impurity that rests on the hands and that results from the withdrawel of the soul's holiness from the person's body at night when he is asleep. (as to one who sleeps by day see mahadura kama 4:15 also 55:8). The washing enables the erson to sanctify himself in G-d's holiness (responsa of the Rashba vol 1 sec 191; Rokeiach sec 363) by the pouring of pure water from a container...\"</p>\n\n<p>Paragraph 2:  In the Talmud as well (shabbos 109a) the Sages cautioned about this spirit of impurity that rests on a person's hands upon awakening, saying that it is not removed until he washes them three times, alternately, (shaar Hakavanos, inyan birkas hashachar). THey also warned (shabbos 108b) that before washing one should not touch his eyes, ears, nose mouth, anal opening, any place where he has let blood, or his organ - i.e., from the corona and below, or for the purpose of relations. Nor should he touch water that was prepared in a tank to enable all the members of his houshold to wash, so that his hands will not make it impure.</p>\n\n\n",

The <em>gemara</em> claims that the active agent in the sale of a field is the seller, since the verse  says ומכר, <em>and he [the seller] sells</em>, whereas the active agent in <em>kiddushin</em> is the groom, since the verse states כי יקח, <em>when he [the groom] takes</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>gemara</em> then brings a refutation from another verse that flips the agent around for the sale of a field, namely Jeremiah 32:44, which has the words יקנו, <em>they will buy</em>.  The <em>gemara</em> retorts that we actually read this as יַקנוּ (<em>yaknu</em>), <em>they will sell</em>.  This brings the agency back to the seller.  If we were to read יִקָּנוּ (<em>yikkanu</em>), <em>they will be bought</em>, the agency would be unclear.  Indeed, the <em>Maharsha</em> on this <em>sugya</em> confirms that we chose the correct vowels, and explains: הוא מקנה השדה לקונה, <em>he [the seller] sells [makneh] the field to the buyer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, lack of clarity of the agency would be enough to invalidate the <em>gemara</em>'s refutation from this verse, and so it seems not to matter how we read it<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> The rest of the <em>sugya</em> is also no proof, for if in the <em>gemara</em>'s subsequent attempt to re-read יִקַּח (<em>yikkakh</em>), we were to make an analogy to the above and read a <em>hifil</em> form, <em>ie.</em> יַקֵּח (<em>yakkeykh</em>), we would find that we have created a conjugation that is not attested in <em>Tanakh</em>: much better would be to read the <em>hofal</em> form יֻקַּח (<em>yukkakh</em>).  Thus, it is difficult to compare the two re-readings to say they have been changed to the same <em>binyan</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Other sources of light to bless Shabbat over\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In places were candles are unsafe or prohibited from use, could light emitting diodes with batteries substitute?  Closing the circuit would be regarded as work. But so is lighting a candle for any other purpose but the blessing.  Could an analogy of kindling a candle be applied to activating the substitute to honor shabbat only?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes you can light shabbat \"candles\" using battery powered flashlights. Some rule you can even do so using electric lights (although others disagree).</p>\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1655\" rel=\"nofollow\">one source</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hacham Ben Sion, in his work Or Le'sion (vol. 3, p. 189, and vol. 2,\n  18:13), writes that one does not fulfill the obligation of Shabbat\n  candles with electric lights because the \"fuel\" is not present at the\n  time of lighting. When a person lights a candle, all the wax or oil\n  needed to sustain the flame is already present. An electric lamp,\n  however, is sustained by the electric current that is constantly being\n  fed into the lamp. Since that current is not present at the time of\n  lighting, one cannot use such a light for this obligation. Hacham Ben\n  Sion contends that this would be analogous to an oil lamp that has\n  just several drops of oil, and into which one slowly pours oil drop by\n  drop. Clearly, one cannot recite the Beracha over lighting in such a\n  fashion, since the fuel needed to sustain the flame for the required\n  period is not already present. Likewise, according to Hacham Ben Sion,\n  one cannot fulfill the obligation of Shabbat candles with an electric\n  light.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Of course, if we follow this rationale, we would allow using a battery-operated light for this Misva. As Hacham Ben Sion notes, in\n  the case of a battery-operated light all the power is already\n  contained in the mechanism, and it would therefore suffice for the\n  obligation of Shabbat candle lighting.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Hacham Ovadia Yosef, in his work Yabia Omer (vol. 9), disagrees, and rules that in principle, one can, in fact, fulfill the obligation with\n  electric lights.</strong> Since when all is said and done electric lights\n  have the effect of providing illumination, they suffice for this Misva\n  regardless of the fact that the source of power is not currently\n  present.</p>\n  \n  <p>This ruling has numerous ramifications. <strong>For example, if a person\n  spends Shabbat in a hotel or hospital, where he is not permitted to\n  kindle a flame, he may turn on an electric light before Shabbat in\n  fulfillment of the obligation to light Shabbat candles.</strong> (Rav Aharon\n  Kotler is likewise reported to have taken this position.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and here from <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/93/Q2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ohr</a> (!)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most Poskim, therefore, say that you may use electric lights and even\n  recite the blessing over them, since they add to Shalom Bayit and Oneg\n  Shabbat the same way as candles.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some Poskim, however, differentiate between battery-powered lights,\n  such as flashlights, and those that run on electricity generated from\n  a power plant. <strong>Battery-powered lights are all right</strong> since they\n  contain 'fuel' - i.e., the battery - which is right there when you\n  light it. Regular lights, on the other hand, have no 'fuel'. Rather,\n  the electricity is 'piped' in from the outside; and furthermore, the\n  electricity doesn't really exist yet - it's being created every second\n  at the power plant. In a sense it's like lighting a wick with no oil.\n  It's known about Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, zatzal, that once when he was\n  in a hotel and unable to light candles, he 'lit' a flashlight and made\n  a blessing over it.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sources</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>The Radiance of Shabbos, Rabbi Simcha Bunim Cohen</li>\n  <li>Shmirat Shabbat Kehilchata 2:43, footnote 22</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a question of what type of lightbulb qualifies, and whether a traditional incandescent lightbulb is required (because it is closest to fire) or whether fluorescent (and presumably LEDs) would suffice. In an <a href=\"http://cslr.law.emory.edu/fileadmin/media/PDFs/Lectures/Broyde_Electrically_Produced_Fire.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">extensive review of sources</a> R Howard Jachter and R Michael Broyde conclude that fluorescent lights are permitted for shabbat candles in cases where candles are not possible, based on R Ovadia Yosef and R Neuwirth (same sources as above).</p>\n\n<p>As always <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10103/how-do-you-cylor-after-posting-on-judaism-stackexchange-com\">CYLOR</a> before using this in actual cases.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do people start going mad a week before Purim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Last Thursday, a week before Purim, many of my Jewish friends and Jewish co-workers began <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_March_Madness_(CBS/Turner)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">going mad</a>.</p>\n<p>They were frantically writing names of colleges on a grid marked on paper. It looked like there were 64 college names in boxes, and they had to write 32 of these names into other boxes, then 16 more name, then 8, 4 2 and finally 1 name in a giant box in the middle of this grid.</p>\n<p>I asked one guy what he was doing, and he was frantic and said that he had to \"bracket\" something or other. Another person I asked was also in a frenzy and said he was also \"bracketing\".</p>\n<p>OK, so they fill these boxes exactly a week before Purim. They do this early in the morning. Then from late morning to late at night, they watch college basketball games on TV. For 3 weeks afterwards, they go mad while watching these games. Someone told me that this madness continues on Purim itself and Shushan Purim. (well, maybe getting drunk makes people mad.) The madness occurs on Shabbat and Sunday, as well. The madness lasts about 3 weeks, which means that it lasts from a week before Purim to a bit over a week after Purim.</p>\n<p>Is there something about Purim or Adar Sheni that makes people mad to the point that they have to \"bracket\"?</p>\n<p>Note - this madness seems to happen only in USA, for some reason.</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

We run in all directions to prepare the <em>mitzvot</em> of the day: we buy food for <em>mishloach manot</em>, buy for and prepare the festive Purim meal, culminating in a crazy Purim morning where we run across cities to listen to the megila reading, deliver <em>mishloach manot</em>, <em>matanot le'evyionim</em> and attend the festive meal with friends.</p>\n\n<p>Our friendly gentile neighbors see us all excited, running all over the place and want to get in on the action, following the well-known <em><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Hadran.4?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">hadran</a></em> said after learning <em>Masechet Megila</em></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָנוּ רָצִים וְהֵם רָצִים <br> We run and they run</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Our neighbors do not have the same mitzvot but observe this period according to their <em>minhag hamakom</em>.

Does anyone have sources that might shed light on what this would do halachically?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<h3>Yes,  it can be kosher.</h3>\n\n<p>We need a good definition of Ever min Hachay.<br>\nHere is a first trial in order to improve the understanding of the topic. Firstly Rambam Kedusha Maachalot Assurot,  1--3<blockquote><h3>‏הלכות מאכלות אסורות פרק ה ‏ ‏</h3>‏\n <p>1\nAccording to the Oral Tradition, we learnt that [the intent of] the Torah's statement \"Do not partake of the soul together with the meat\" [is to] forbid a limb cut off from a living animal. With regard to a limb cut off from a living animal, it was said to Noah [Genesis 9:4]: \"But flesh, together with its soul, its blood, you may not eat.\"</p>\n\n<p>The prohibition against [partaking of] a limb from a living animal applies to kosher domesticated animals, wild beasts, and fowl, but not to non-kosher species.<sup>[1]</sup>\n</p><p>2\nThe term ever [translated as \"limb\"] applies both to a limb that has flesh, sinews, and bones, e.g., a hand or a foot, and to an organ that does not have a bone<sup>[2]</sup>, e.g., the tongue, the testicles, the spleen, the kidneys, the heart, and the like. [There is, however, one difference.] When an organ does not possess a bone, the prohibition [against partaking of] a limb from a living animal applies whether one cut off the entire organ or only part of it. When, by contrast, a limb possesses a bone, a person is not liable [for violating the prohibition against] a limb from a living animal unless he separates it in its complete state, with its flesh, sinews, and bones. If, however, he only removes flesh from the living animal, he is liable for [the prohibition against partaking of] a trefe [animal] as explained, and not because of a limb from a living animal.<sup>[3]</sup>.\n <p></p>3\nOne is liable for lashes only for partaking of an olive-sized portion of a limb from a living animal. Even if one eats an entire limb or organ, if it is the size of an olive, one is liable; if not he is exempt.</p>\n\n<p>If one cut off a olive-sized portion of flesh, sinews, and bones from the limb according to its natural form and ate it, one is liable, even if it possessed only the smallest amount of meat. If, however, one separated a limb which he tore off from a living animal and detached the flesh from the sinews and the meat, he is not liable for lashes unless he eats an olive-sized portion of the meat alone. <sup>[4]</sup>The bones and the sinews are not included in the olive-sized portion since he changed [the limb's] natural form.\n<p></p>\n\n<h3>Concerning produces See Rambam Zerayim Terumot, 11, 21</h3>\n\n<p>\n<b>Produce that grows from terumah</b> is considered as ordinary produce with regard to all matters except that it is forbidden to non-priests. Our Sages decreed that it be forbidden to non-priests like terumah [as a safeguard], lest a priest maintain possession of impure terumah with the intent of sowing it and producing [a crop of] ordinary produce and this lead to undesirable consequences. Therefore, it is permitted to eat the products [of such plantings] with impure hands and a person who has immersed himself that day may partake of them like ordinary produce</p>\n\n<h3>Halacha 22</h3>\n\n<p>\nProduce grown from produce grown [from terumah] are like ordinary produce with regard to all matters. [This applies] even to types of produce whose seeds do not decompose provided the new growth exceeds the root in the second generation of produce. [In such a situation,] the new growth elevates the root even if the seed does not decompose and the entire [plant] is permitted to be eaten by non-priest<sup>[5]</sup> </p>\n\n<p></blockquote></p>\n\n<p><br>‎[1] For Jewish people,  Ever min Hachay, the prohibition  to eat a member from a live animal concern only animal species which are permitted for consomation (clean species) .\n<br>[2] Organs that are smooth (without bones and ligaments) have status of limb. If we take from a smooth limb a slice of meat, this slice is prohibited as Ever Min Hachay<br>\n[3] I think that the stem cells are sampled from the animal itself as we make in biopsy. If the origin of the stem cells is a smooth organ, as the tong, maybe Issur Ever min Hachay. But anyway there is the Lav of <b>Basar min Hachay</b> for smooth parts on bone organs <br>\n[4] If we extract a \"hard\" limb, in partially full form, that is meat, ligaments and bones, in quantity of Kazayt, this sample is called itself Ever min Hachay. If after this procedure we cut up meat this meat is prohibited as Ever min Hachay.<br>\n[5] After many mitosis (cells reproduction)  we have obviously Giduley Gidulin. Even if Ever min haChay is similar to teruma it is allowed. But without this the stringency of teruma is very specific to teruma only.<br></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>Provisional conclusion</h3>\n\n<ul><li>the meat is allowed.</li><li> I am not sur that his status is Bessari (he come not from a mother, and from a mother that produces milk, as request according to the drashot of Bassar Vechalav)</li></ul>\n\n<p>I think that the problem is solved. After having wrote  this, I see in the link above (meat in vitro. I think thare is no difference. the mitosis is anyway in vitro), they Cited a Shut Cheshek Shelomo. I would like to see it. I see </p>\n\n\n",

Many people equate Sadduccees with Karaites, but this is not correct, Karaites follow the normal Jewish calendar, with exceptions to how a new moon is reckoned, and when Shavu'ot is.</p>\n\n<p>If indeed the Jews at Qumran were Essenes, then we could say that there was an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#The_Qumran_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">Essene calendar</a> that was based off the book <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Enoch\" rel=\"nofollow\">1 Enoch</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Jubilees\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jubilees</a>. While you might not find the very specific phrasing of \"the day begins at sunrise,\" the calendars they propose are solar calendars, which have their basis with the rising and the falling of the sun as their measurement of counting days. Unlike a lunar calendar, which is based on the appearance of (or lack thereof) the moon. Many ancient civilizations used a solar calendar, and in fact a variant of a solar calendar is what is commonly used in America, given to us by the Romans, which is why we reckon the day at sunrise. So when you read discussions of ancient Jewish sects, the term solar calendar has the implicit understanding that the days are reckoned at sunrise.</p>\n\n<p>You can read some information regarding the calendar of Enoch <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoch_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Be aware that if you do a Google search of the Enoch calendar you will find lots of websites of new \"Messianic Christian\" sects that are attempting to revive the use of the Enochian calendar.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of normative Judaism, the Rashbam claims that the Jewish day begins at sunrise, though he also says that his words are not to contradict halachah, but that he is simply giving what he considers the p'shat of the text. It is unknown if he was aware of any Essene documentation or if he came to this conclusion on his own.</p>\n\n<p>Rashbam on Genesis 1:5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויהי ערב ויהי בקר – אין כתיב כאן ויהי לילה ויהי יום אלא ויהי ערב, שהעריב יום ראשון ושיקע האור, ויהי בוקר, בוקרו של לילה, שעלה עמוד השחר. הרי הושלם יום א’ מן הו’ ימים שאמר הק’ בי’ הדברות, ואח”כ התחיל יום שיני, ויאמר אלהים יהי רקיע. ולא בא הכתוב לומר שהערב והבקר יום אחד הם, כי לא הצרכנו לפרש אלא היאך היו ששה ימים, שהבקיר יום ונגמרה הלילה, הרי נגמר יום אחד והתחיל יום שיני:</p>\n  \n  <p>And it was evening and it was morning – It does not say “it was night\n  and it was day”, but “it was evening”, [meaning] the first day passed\n  and the light set, “and it was morning”, the ending of the night, for\n  the dawn broke. One day of the six days mentioned in the Ten\n  Commandments was completed. Afterwards the second day began, and God\n  said “Let there be sky.” The verse is not coming to tell us that\n  evening and morning constitute one day, for we do not need to explain\n  anything but how the six days were, for with the coming of the morning\n  the night was over – thus one day was completed and the second day\n  begun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/can-torah-contradict-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thetorah.com/can-torah-contradict-halacha/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The chronology given for the night of the Exodus from Egypt seems to indicate that (at least at that time) the start of the day must have been at sunrise.

So the night of departure from Egypt had to be a night following the morning, which came after the night the Egyptian first born were killed.\nBut Passover was on 14 Abib.\nIf the days began at evening rather than morning, that second night for the departure would have had to have occurred on 16 Abib.\nI can't see how the chronology of the Exodus events can fit with a departure on the night of 15 Abib unless in those days, each day was beginning at sunrise.</p>\n\n\n",

Ramban continues and say that from an Halachic point of view, we don't follow the opinion of this Agada  and if the lover is a non-Jew the wife remains allowed to her husband despite that the sexual intercourse was not a rape. Tosfot Sanhedrin 74b discussed also this Aggada. It seems that Rabenu Tam will agree with the opinion of Ramban that this Aggada is not relevant from an Halachic point of view.</p>\n\n<p>But the main question was about the fact that she was permitted before this event. The answer is that she was beOness following the opinion of the Aggada. This is true from an Halachic point of view, according to all Rishonim (not Ramban and RT only, but also Baal Hamaor and Rabbi yitschak Bar Mordechai in tosfot Sanhedrin 74b) </p>\n\n\n",

If the money isn't distributed until Shushan Purim, which for me is not Purim (for the most part), am I actually giving the money on Purim? If they give it out in Jerusalem on \"regular\" Purim, then it will be Purim for me, but not for the organization which is distributing it, and anyone who lives in Jerusalem and donated to them might have a problem.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if someone in Jerusalem donates to an American cause that will distribute in the US (or to an Israeli charity which distributes in an unwalled Israeli city, or in a walled city but on the \"regular\" Purim day) then the money will not be distributed on the day which the person who donated considers Purim.</p>\n\n<p>Can I fulfill my obligation to donate ON Purim if my money is distributed to the poor on the Purim which isn't the one I observe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Given that this involves Jews, the correct answer is that it is a machlokes. There are those who say that it can be done as long as it is sent to arrive on Purim. , and there are those who say that it cannot be done. </p>\n\n<p>Another point is that sending to an organization that distributes on Purim is like making a shaliach to give it out for you. This is different from the case of mailing it to the poor person to arrive on Purim. However, the question still arises if one can have his shaliach deliver it on Purim for the poor person when it is no longer Purim for the original sender. Note that it would not matter if it is Purim for the shaliach or not as \"shaliach adam kamoso\".</p>\n\n<p>There are those who say that the requirement of \"on Purim\" is established by the location <strong>of the recipient</strong>. This is not only based on the difference between Yerushalaim and elsewhere, but even for different time zones (such as Australia and the United States). This is cited in the name of the <em>Eishel Avraham</em>. The analogy is given to Mishloach Manos or Seudas Purim.

In this regard, the Talmud here draws the comparison to <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt08b12.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">2 Sam 12:3</a>, where Uriah the Hittite had groomed young Bathsheba to be his wife.

As a result, he adds it at the point that the Chazal stated he should in order to precede the request for an answer to the prayer for communal healing. An individual adds it to Shma Koleinu at mincha because it is an individual prayer, just as he would add a prayer for any private purpose. Rabbi Kaganoff points out that the Chazan does <strong>not</strong> say aneinu during the silent Shmona Esrai of Shacharis.

If he has already said God’s Name, he must complete the\n  blessing of Refa’einu and insert Aneinu in the blessing of Shomei’ah\n  Tefilla, like an individual does. If he forgot it there, too, he says\n  it after the Shemoneh Esrei without a blessing conclusion.

However, during the course of the discussion, we see that the halacha of the other megillos does not require a klaf, unlike megillas Esther. See the Fourth reason of the Rama not to recite a bracha for the other megillos.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Book of Eicha is one of the five megillot (scrolls).  Masechet\n  Soferim 14:1, states that when one reads one of the five megillot, the\n  beracha of Al Mikra Megillah is recited.  R. David Avudraham, Tefillot\n  HaPesach codifies the statement of Masechet Soferim.  Ramban, Torat\n  Ha'Adam (Chavel ed. Pg. 258) applies the statement of Masechet Soferim\n  specifically to the reading of Eicha.  Nevertheless, R. Yosef Karo,\n  Beit Yosef, Orach Chaim 559, notes that common practice is to refrain\n  from reciting the beracha of Al Mikra Megillah on all of the megillot\n  with the exception of Megillat Esther.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rama, Teshuvot HaRama no. 35, addresses the practice of refraining\n  from the recitation of a beracha.  He presents four reasons for this\n  practice.  First, perhaps the beracha of Al Mikra Megillah is only\n  recited upon obligatory readings of a megillah.  If the megillah is\n  read because of a minhag, one does not recite a beracha.  [Rama does\n  note that the reading of Eicha can be considered an obligatory reading\n  since it is based on Talmudic sources.]  Second, there are different\n  versions of Masechet Soferim as to what beracha should be recited. \n  One version is to recite Al Mikra Megillah.  Another version is to\n  recite Al Mikra Ketuvim.  Rama suggests that a tradition developed to\n  omit the beracha in order to avoid this question.  Third, Rama\n  questions whether it is actually appropriate to recite a beracha on\n  reading a megillah (aside from Megillat Esther).  Although Masechet\n  Soferim does endorse reciting a beracha upon recitation of the\n  megillot, Rama suggests that the statement in Masechet Soferim is\n  based on opinions and traditions that are not considered common\n  practice.  <strong>Fourth, Rama suggests that one may only recite the beracha\n  of Al Mikra Megillah if one is reading from a text that is written on\n  parchment and was written according to the laws of writing a sefer\n  Torah.  Since most communities do not have megillot that are written\n  on parchment</strong> (with the exception of Megillat Esther), they do not\n  recite the beracha of Al Mikra Megillah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rama concludes that one should never recite a beracha on the megillot\n  (with the exception of Megillat Esther) even if they are written on\n  parchment.  He notes that if the only reason to refrain from reciting\n  the beracha is that they are not written on parchment, synagogues\n  would make it a priority to purchase a set of megillot.  Since we do\n  not find such a practice, it must be that one would not recite a\n  beracha on the megillot even if they are written on parchment.</p>\n  \n  <p>Magen Avraham 490:9, disagrees with Rama's conclusion and rules that\n  one should recite a beracha on the reading any of the megillot (except\n  Kohelet).  [Magen Avraham does not seem to require parchment in order\n  to recite the beracha.  Ostensibly, Magen Avraham is following his own\n  opinion (284:1) that there is no requirement to use parchment for the\n  Haftorah text (see \"<a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/711551/rabbi-josh-flug/reading-the-haftorah-from-printed-materials/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reading the Haftorah from Printed Materials</a>\").] \n  Mishna Berurah 490:19, sides with the opinion of Rama that one should\n  not recite a beracha on the megillot.  However, he notes that one can\n  justify the practice of reciting a beracha if the megillah is read\n  from parchment.  The Vilna Gaon's personal practice was to read all of\n  the megillot from parchment and to recite a beracha (see Ma'aseh Rav\n  no. 175).  Those communities that follow all of the minhagim of the\n  Vilna Gaon recite a beracha on reading the megillah from parchment. \n  [See R. Yechiel M. Tucatzinski, Sefer Eretz Yisrael 21:2.  R.\n  Tucatzinski implies that reading from a parchment is necessary\n  regardless of whether one plans on reciting a beracha.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Hence, the Ran claims, since mishloach manot is part of the se’uda it is “tethered” to the se’uda: whenever the se’uda occurs, mishloach manot must be disbursed. \n  ...\n  A third issue relates to the exact time on Purim during which this mitzva should be performed. The Rema (OC 695) cites the position that mishloach manot must be delivered during the day. Many attempt to provide an explanation to support this position (see, for example, the Bi’ur Ha-Gra). One solution might be to invalidate evening mishloach manot because the evening is invalid for the se’uda (see Megilla 7b).

However, in order to counterbalance this, nevua was also removed from the world. As we discuss in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/68605/why-did-god-created-physical-impulse-towards-the-wrong-women/68612#68612\">Why did God created physical impulse towards the \"wrong\" women</a> the impulse within man is required to give him the energy to act. This can be for good or for bad. Thus, removing the impulse to worship idols also removes the impulse to dedicate oneself to Hashem. That is why, when the yetzer hara for avodas ara was removed, nevua (true or flase) ceased. In fact, one can claim that this is the point at which the yetzer hara that we call atheism entered the world (as a general situation). However, that is a different discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, once Micha became the last navi, any possibility of nevua among the goyim also disappeared.</p>\n\n<p>I should point out that any neviim among the goyim would not be mentioned unless they had something to do with Bnei Yisrael and the Torah needed to teach a lesson regarding them (as with Bil'am or qas the medrash says, Iyov). We know of 48 neviim among Bnai Yisrael and the talmud tells us that there were large numbers of actual neviim that we do not know (as many as left mitzraim).</p>\n\n<p>From Bava Batra 15b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seven prophets prophesied to the heathen, namely, Balaam and his\n  father, Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the\n  Naamathite, and Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While there could have been more, we cannot know of them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33467/among-the-gentiles-why-job-and-bilaam-were-recognized-as-prophets-whereas-muham\">Among the gentiles, why Job and Bilaam were recognized as prophets whereas Muhammad was not?</a> states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because of Bilaam's wickedness, as emblematic of the wickedness of\n  gentile prophets, God removed prophecy from the gentiles (<a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=4&perek=22&mefaresh=tanhuma\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash\n  Tanchuma, Balak, siman 1</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You also ask a second question that is on a totally different topic.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>would a genuine non-Jewish prophet that created his own religion,\n  would that religion be true</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If the new religion contradicted the Torah or attempted to change sheva mitzvos bnai Noach, then he would be a navi sheker and not a \"genuine prophet\". In any case we do not know of anyone who did this. The only two \"prophets\" that we know of who founded religions were weoll after prophecy in general ended at the <strong>start</strong> of the second temple era. Thus, the two modern invented religions could not have involved genuine prophecy.</p>\n\n\n",

See the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have to admit that the name Rav Bonov was controversial, as I shall explain:</p>\n\n<p>In the paragraph that you alluded to, there is a statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ראש ימיני נשאת ואויב שמו מחית רב בניו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You made him a Rosh Yemini. And those that hate his name, Rav Banav, you erased (i.e., you got rid of them.) (In Hebrew poetry as well as frequently in Tanac\"h, sometimes, a verb intervenes between the subject and the object, as it does here.)</p>\n\n<p>In many schools, for many years, teachers would force left-handed people to become right-handed (in Hebrew, a ימיני.) Scientific research discovered that <a href=\"http://www.anythinglefthanded.co.uk/being-lh/children/changing-left-to-right.html#sthash.Re345ghu.dpbs\" rel=\"nofollow\">this practice was harmful</a> to the left-handed children.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Bonov was a left-handed person who was also forced to become right-handed when he was in Cheder. He became a rebbe of Yeshivat Yemin Moshe, in Jersulem. He was an advocate against this practice of forcing left-handed people to become righties, because he understood how traumatic this was. Thus, the Rosh Yeshiva made him the Rosh Yemini. It's actually a play on words, because it doesn't mean, in this case, \"Head of the right\". meaning the right-handed people, but rather, \"Head of what IS right\", meaning \"the correct thing to do.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now, there were many people who still advocated for the previous system, namely forcing everyone to be right handed, and they wanted to get rid of Rav Bonov. They hated him and hated his name mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Well guess what happened, since they hated his name, they were erased, instead. The yeshiva fired the people who hated Rav Bonov.</p>\n\n<p>By the way, it doesn't say that HE was hanged. It says that his possessions were hung. (You have to read the above with a period after the word \"Bonov\". See above reading.)</p>\n\n<p>The word עץ, here, doesn't mean \"tree\". It means \"wood\". Rav Bonov was a sometimes forgetful man, which is understandable, considering that he become the Rosh Yemini at age 78. Sometimes, he would forget his cane and hat in the room. So, at the end of the day, the Rosh yeshiva came by to check each room, and would just hang his belongings on the piece of wood by the wall.</p>\n\n\n",

That is, <em>Ester</em> was pointing out to <em>Achashverosh</em> that not only was <em>Haman</em> the one who was plotting to kill <em>Ester</em>'s people (see the context there), <em>Haman</em> also had shared a wife with <em>Achashverosh</em>, namely <em>Vashti</em>.</p>\n\n<p><em>Achashverosh</em> was not angered by the latter revelation, since he was, as we know, licentious himself. He was, however, angry about the attempt on <em>Ester</em>'s co-nationals' lives, and stood up for a walk in the garden. When he returned to the party, the following verses tell us,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Haman</em> was falling on the chaise longue that <em>Esther</em> was on.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Haman</em> saw that it didn't bother <em>Achashverosh</em> that they had shared a previous wife, so decided to try the same with <em>Ester</em>. But</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the king said, \"Do you plan also to conquer the queen with me at home?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and had him killed.

He wasn't strong enough to be a czar in the first place, but for some reason, probably a political favor, Achashverush made him a czar.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Esther was pointing out to Achashevrush Haman's weakness by saying, essentially, \"Yes, he is an enemy and a czar, but he's very bad at his job.\"</p>\n\n\n",

We start the paragraphs as follows. <em>Chanuka</em>'s starts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the days of <em>Matisyahu</em>… and his sons, when the evil Greek monarchy rose against Your people Israel to cause them to forget your Torah and to draw them from the laws of Your will…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Purim</em>'s starts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the days of <em>Mord'chay</em> and <em>Ester</em> in the capital <em>Shushan</em>, when the evil <em>Haman</em> rose against them, he sought to destroy, kill, and get rid of all the Jews…</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I note two differences between these:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><em>Chanuka</em>'s says \"rose against Your people Israel\"; <em>Purim</em>'s says \"rose against them\", presumably the aforementioned <em>Mord'chay</em> and <em>Ester</em>.</li>\n<li><em>Chanuka</em>'s says \"rose against [whomever] to…\"; <em>Purim</em>'s says \"rose against [whomever], he sought to…\".</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Why these differences?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Regarding the first difference - perhaps because the nature of the threat by <em>Chanukah</em> was \"to cause them to forget your Torah and to draw them from the laws of Your will\", in other words to sever the bond between the Jewish People and God, we therefore emphasize \"Your People Israel\". By <em>Purim</em>, however, the intention of the enemy was not to disconnect the Jews from God, rather it was simple genocide.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the second difference - there is a theme particular to Purim of celebrating how the enemy's evil intention was turned on its head, aside from celebrating the salvation of the Jews from destruction. Later in that paragraph it says \"You...nullified his [Haman's] planning and ruined his intended result and caused his design to return upon his own head.\" Similarly, in the <em>piyut</em> recited the night of Purim - <em>Asher Heini</em> - we say \"He [Haman] planned to trap, but was himself trapped, he sought to destroy and was swiftly destroyed.\" Perhaps this is why the word בקש/\"he sought\" is added to the beginning - to contrast Haman's intentions with what actually transpired and thus emphasize the thwarting and inversion of his plan.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the underlying requirement of Techeilet?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been reading the various questions and answers about techeilet but I still don't understand the exact demand (and apologies if I missed this amongst the other questions). Is the goal to have a thread of a certain color or sourced from a particular origin. The source seems important because people discuss the talmudic description of the Chilazon (eg. \"According to the Tosefta (Men. 9:6), the Ḥillazon is the exclusive source of the dye.\" from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekhelet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a>) but there is also discussion of the particular <a href=\"http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/ancient-cultures/what-color-was-tekhelet/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">shade</a>. </p>\n\n<p>If the issue is the specific color, then do techeilet strings have to be checked against a standard on any schedule to ensure that there has been no fading (like how one checks a mezuzah)? If the issue is the source then does the color not matter ultimately (as per the comment on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8850/where-can-i-get-dark-blue-techelet-for-my-tzizit-and-talit\">this</a> question)? If the requirement is a combination of a particular species and shade then the same issues related to checking the color would still exist. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word \"tekheiles\" actually refers to a kind of blue wool; not the dye itself, but the dyed wool. Most hold that tekheiles must come from the chilazon.</p>\n<p>There is the opinion of the Tif'eres Yisrael (stated in his introduction to Seder Mo'eid, kelalei Bigdei Qodesh \"hinei\") that tekheiles is any colorfast blue wool of the right hue. According to him, the Tosefta's and gemara's insistence on using the chilazon is a historical artifact of that being the only dye of that hue which is colorfast when applied to wool that they knew of in their day. But according to him, with today's chemistry, other dyes would be kosher options.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, the Tif'eres Yisrael is unique in holding that opinion. Although some (including the TY) do read the Rambam as saying as much about tekheiles for kohein's clothing, they would still agree that for tzitzis the Rambam requires the dye come from a chilazon.</p>\n<p>The \"space\" of possible colors is three dimensional, so a color cannot be described with fewer than three numbers. Monitors mix primary colors, so you may have seen RGB (red-green-blue) numbers to describe the desired color. Dyes use a very different set of axes: hue, saturation and value (or light). Hue tells you where on the spectrum it is, and is usually described as a circle. (Closing the spectrum by connecting the bottom end and top end at purple / magenta.) Saturation is how much color, and value (or light) is how dark (or light) it is.</p>\n<p>Picking a given dye would mean that the hue should be constant. But not the other factors. The amount of dye used would change the saturation and value of the resulting color.</p>\n<p>BUT: being told the dye must be extracted from a certain kind of marine animal doesn't mean that all marine animals of that species produce exactly the same chemicals in the same proportions. Just as there is slight color variation among the greens of maple leaves. And perhaps there is a recipe by which the dye is extracted, or attached to the wool. So, it's not even clear that the dye is always exactly the same hue, either.</p>\n<p>Nor that there is one kosher hue rather than a range of hues. For example, the Rambam's \"color of the sky on a clear day\" is not that specific.</p>\n<p>As for fading.... The dye must be colorfast. The gemara even offers a test for colorfastness to distinguish between true tekheiles and indigo dyed wool (from the indigo plant, in the tea family of bushes).</p>\n<p>That said, fading can also be caused by the dye retaining its color, but being chemically teased off the wool. This is how Woolite works, for example.</p>\n<p>As an example of what we expect when we say \"colorfast\": R/Dr Moshe Tendler reports that when he took murex-dyed wool and left it in bleach, the wool eventually dissolved, leaving the dye as a sediment on the bottom.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Zaken Mamrei vs. Par He'elem Davar\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This past weekend I was reading through the Torah Temimah on Vayikra and a paradox occurred to me.</p>\n\n<p>The Zaken Mamre is specifically applied to one who is in a position of authority over a community. If he preaches to his followers to act against the ruling of Sanhedrin (i.e.: following Beis Shammai after the psak of Beis Hillel was establish as law), then he is first warned and later executed for contravening the courts.</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, the Par He'elem Davar Shel Tzibbur is a communal sacrifice brought because the Sanhedrin made a mistake in psak that lead to a large number of individuals (the specifics aren't important in this question) committing a sin that is chayiv kares. In this case, someone who knows the proper halacha is not \"exempted\" as the rest of the congregation, since he knows they ruled improperly, IIRC.</p>\n\n<p>BUT it would seem that we have a contradiction - if the Zaken KNEW the ruling was incorrect, he cannot follow it, but it would ALSO appear that preventing OTHERS from following that mistaken ruling (to prevent a case of lifnei eiver) would lead to him becoming a Zaken Mamre! </p>\n\n<p>In fact, this would seem to be the precise issue of Tanur shel Achnai (and later tanur ben Dinai), where one shittah held it was tamei and the other held it was tahor - the side holding it was tahor would potentially lead to someone bringing tumah into the Beis Hamikdash, an issur kares!</p>\n\n<p>Taken to a logical conclusion, Beis Shammai would be required to \"shut down\" it's yeshivah once it was paskened that the halacha was no longer like them, since continuing to teach their halachic mesora would lead to Zaken Mamre, yet we see that Beis Hillel and Shammai did taharos \"on top of one another\" - that Beis Shammai continued to practice according to their mesorah!</p>\n\n<p>Are there sources that deal with the tension between these two conflicting principles? And what are the boundaries of Zaken Mamre vs. the Moreh Halacha who (it would seem) must teach others to prevent the mass violation of halacha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Ramban in Sefer Ha-Mitzvos (shoresh 1, quoted by R. Elchanan Wasserman in Kuntres Divrei Sofrim), and many other sources, indicate that one who knows the rulings of the Sanhedrin to be incorrect may be stringent upon himself. This would not make him a zaken mamrei, as to be a zaken mamrei one must teach others to follow his view against that of the Sanhedrin. Thus, as long as one does not tell others to contravene the ruling of the Sanhedrin, there is no contradiction. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think the Tanur shel Achnai (BM 59a-b) is an answer, not a basis for your question.</p>\n\n<p>For those who don't know the story, R' Eliezer and the Chachamim got into a dispute about this oven, more specifically whether the items placed inside were pure or impure. The Chachamim held it was tamei, and R' Eliezer held it was tahor. R' Eliezer, who felt that he was in the right, demanded, separately, that a tree be uprooted, a river flow backwards, and the walls of the Beis Midrash fall if his opinion was correct. All three happened. (Well, the walls didn't collapse. They began leaning, and R' Yehoshua convinced them to stop. Thus, they're still crooked today.)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, R' Eliezer demanded that Shamayim prove that he is right, and, indeed, a Bas Kol rang out and said R' Eliezer was correct. R' Yehoshua exclaimed, \"Lo BaShamayim Hee\" - since the Torah was given to mankind, only men can decide the halacha. (Feel free to check out the various places in Shas where this statement of R' Yehoshua's is quoted, and the story of Rabbah's death in BM 85a, for more details.) Later, Eliyahu HaNavi related that Hashem was laughing at the time, saying that his children had triumphed over Him. (Whatever that means.)</p>\n\n<p>The story continues for quite a bit, but that last paragraph is the key part here: it's up to the Sanhedrin to decide the law. Whether that law is actually correct or not is irrelevant; we follow the Sanhedrin, and if they are wrong, that's what the Par He'elam Davar is for. According to this logic, the guy should allow the people to follow the Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside, why didn't the guy go up to the Sanhedrin Gedolah and tell them why they're wrong? If, indeed, they were wrong, the Sanhedrin would correct themselves, and they'd offer the Par He'elam Davar if applicable, and several thousand, if not million, Chata'os if not.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Mishna Orayot 1, 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הוֹרוּ בֵית דִּין, וְיָדַע אֶחָד מֵהֶן שֶׁטָּעוּ, וְאָמַר לָהֶן טוֹעִין אַתֶּם,‏\n   ...  הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ פְטוּרִין</p>\n  \n  <p>The Bet din did decide and one of them was aware of the error and said them,  \"you are wrong\",  there are exempted from par heekem davar shel tsibbur. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bartenura (from Gemara 3a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דְּאָמַר קְרָא (וַיִּקְרָא ד) וְאִם כָּל עֲדַת יִשְׂרָאֵל יִשְׁגּוּ, עַד שֶׁיִּהְיוּ כֻּלָּם מַסְכִּימִים בַּשְּׁגָגָה </p>\n  \n  <p>The verse says that the whole congregation did this error. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>YIkar TYT: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הָכִי אִיתָא בַּגְּמָרָא. וּבְמַסְּקָנָא לֹא קָאֵי. אֶלָּא אִי אִיכָּא כֻּלָּם [סַנְהֶדְרִין שֶׁל שִׁבְעִים וְאֶחָד] הַוְיָא הוֹרָאָה [אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁלֹּא הוֹרוּ כָּל אוֹתָן שֶׁיָּשְׁבוּ לְהוֹרוֹת. רַשִׁ\"י], אִי לֹא לֹא. וְהַיְנוּ דִתְנַן וְאָמַר לָהֶם טוֹעִין אַתֶּם, דְּאִי לֹא אֲמַר הָכִי, כֵּיוָן דְּכֻלָּם הָיוּ, הֲוֵי שִׁגְגַת בֵּית דִּין:‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Gemara's conclusion: If the whole Sanhedrin of 71 is present at the meeting, even if a part of them didn't vote the law, this is a public decision, if not, it isn't.

There is Jewish imagery which indicates that each man and woman were created as one entity metaphorically joined at the back, which was separated and brought into this world with the purpose of joining back together. This is purported to be based off making Genesis 1:27 mesh with the Adam and Eve narrative, though the idea is first documented in Plato's Symposium in a speech given by Aristophanes.</p>\n<p>There are talmudic and midrashic examples of the idea that G-d is the one who is responsible for matches. (e.g. Genesis Rabba 68:3-4, Sotah 2a, Sanhedrin 22a) However, this is not so strong as a soulmate. G-d could very well have reasons for setting up an unsuccessful marriage that is beyond our wisdom. Also, this does not mean we must go through with G-d's plans. This would be a violation of freewill. The Rambam rejects the idea of soulmates in Shemoneh Perakim 8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[There is no contradiction to this from the following] statement of our Sages: “Everything is in the hands of heaven except the fear of heaven.” This statement is true and conforms to the conceptual framework that we have explained. Nevertheless, many people err with regard to it and imagine that a person is fated with regard to many of the matters in which he is given free choice: e.g., whether he will marry a particular woman or acquire a sum of money through theft.</p>\n<p>This is absolutely not true. For if a person marries a woman, granting her a marriage contract and performing the rites of kiddushin, he is performing a mitzvah, and God does not decree that we will perform any mitzvot. Should the marriage be forbidden, [entering into it] is a sin, and God does not decree that we will perform any sins.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of a soulmate is also undermined by the laws concerning divorce. Divorce, while not considered ideal, is not considered to be wrong for forbidden such is the case in other religions. If G-d was in the business of forming unbreakable soul bonds, he would not have revealed ways to break said bonds.</p>\n\n\n",

Basically, it used to be everyone of the same gender went to the neighborhood bathhouse and knew if anyone's body had serious issues. It was normal to ask your sister or mother -- <em>hey I'm dating this girl, next time you're at the bathhouse please let me know if anything is seriously wrong with her body</em>. And they weren't wearing bikinis! (On the other hand, I suspect they had a much broader definition of what was considered \"normal\" bodies.)</p>\n\n<p>Rambam, Laws of Marriage 25:2--3, based on a Gemara in Kesubos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן הכונס אישה סתם, ונמצא בה מום ממומי נשים שכבר ביארנום, ולא ידע הבעל במום זה, ולא שמע בו ורצה--הרי זו תצא בלא כתובה, לא עיקר ולא תוספת.</p>\n  \n  <p>כה,ג  כיצד:  היה מרחץ בעיר, והיו לו קרובים--אינו יכול לומר לא ידעתי מומין אלו, ואפילו מומין שבסתר, מפני שהוא בודק בקרובותיו, וחזקה ששמע ורצה.  ואם אין שם מרחץ, או שלא היו לו קרובים--טוען במומין שבסתר; ונכפה בעיתים ידועים, הרי הוא ממומי סתר.  אבל במומין שבגלוי, אינו יכול לטעון, שהרי הכול רואין אותן ואומרין לו, וחזקתו ששמע ונתפייס.</p>\n  \n  <p>One who marries a woman with no particular stipulation, and then finds that she has a physical defect as previously listed [*in 7:8, which includes several concerning breasts]; if the husband never knew of this defect, and did not accept it upon learning of it -- she exits the marriage without dowry payment.</p>\n  \n  <p>If there was a town bathhouse and he had [female] relatives, he can't claim <em>I didn't know she had those issues!</em> -- even if they are in private places -- because he could ask his female relatives; we therefore assume that he already learned of them, and accepted them as-is. However if there is no town bathhouse or he has no female relatives, he can claim ignorance concerning deformities of private parts. But deformities in parts of her body that are seen by all -- he has no claim, as everyone saw them and told him; so we assume he already found out and made peace with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for viewing with prurient interest -- Rav Moshe Feinstein writes that there are two reasons to prohibit a man looking at indecent material -- the anatomical effect it has on him, and that it may lead to actual prohibited relations. The former doesn't apply to women; the latter -- well it depends on the situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Seeing another woman's private area is not technically prohibited - and bikini pictures even less.

It was the incense of choice for all the surrounding pagan cultures.

Shouldn't we be worried that the wholesaler will turn around and sell it to others, who will offer it [in pagan sacrifice]? Said Abayei -- we are concerned with <em>enabling</em>, not <em>enabling the enablers.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Medicinally, the Talmud in Sanhedrin 43a says they would drug someone before execution by giving them frankincense mixed with wine.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' חייא בר רב אשי אמר רב חסדא היוצא ליהרג משקין אותו קורט של לבונה בכוס של יין כדי שתטרף דעתו</p>\n<p>Said R' Chiya bar Ashi, Rav Chisda said that if one is about to be executed, we give him a drink of a dose of frankincense in a cup of wine, to mix up his consciousness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A sentence was added (the line beginning titkabel, \"let be accepted\") that replaces the passage for the rabbis and disciples and asks God to accept all prayers that were recited. This Kaddish is called Kaddish Shalem (Whole or Full Kaddish) and is still said by the chazzan at the end of the service. The full Kaddish includes two sentences, added to the Half Kaddish around the eighth century, that reflect the traditional yearning for peace (Yehei shlomo rabba and Oseh shalom).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later there is record of the Orphan's Kaddish:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first mention of mourners saying Kaddish at the end of the service is in a thirteenth century halakhic writing called the Or Zarua. The Kaddish at the end of the service became designated as Kaddish Yatom or Mourner's Kaddish (literally, \"Orphan's Kaddish\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the creation of this form, a line is removed -- the line beginning Titkabel.</p>\n\n<p>What is it about this line that makes it inappropriate for the Orphan's Kaddish? Was the removal simply to differentiate the two forms?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18231/why-are-different-kaddishes-said-by-different-people\">Related</a>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://beureihatefila.com/files/2008-08-01_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p>Citing from סדר טרוייש סימן ב:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After I explained that Tiskabel closes out Shemona Esrei, you now\nunderstand why the Kaddish recited by a child does not contain the\nline of Tiskabel and neither does the Kaddish that follows the recital\nof Megilos Shir Ha’AShirim, Rus, Koheles and why it is not included\nafter reciting Tzidduk Ha’Din at a funeral and not after a lecture and\nnot in any instance that is not the completion of Shemona Esrei.\nHowever, after reciting Selichos which are like Shemona Esrei we do\nrecite Kaddish with the line of Tiskabel. There are those who do not\nconsider Selichos to be the equivalent of Shemona Esrei so they do not\nrecite Tiskabel after completing selichos. Concerning reciting\nTiskabel before Selichos, everyone agrees that it is inappropriate to\nto do so. Not even regular Kaddish should be said unless you recited\nsome verses because Kaddish was composed to be recited after verses as\nI explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are other related items in this article, esp. some analysis from Ramba\"m regarding whether this type of Kaddish is even considered a tefillah and how Kaddish Yatom was formed.

    "content": "# Is upward/360-degree feedback halachically allowed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is common practice in many companies to request 360-degree or upward feedback, whereby employees are asked to share (positive and negative) feedback on some of their colleagues, subordinates or bosses. This feedback is used for developmental purposes (to help people improve their performance) and sometimes to set compensation (e.g., bonuses). Personnel evaluation is a fundamental core process in many companies, especially in professional services (e.g., consultants, lawyers, tax advisers) who couldn't function without.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Are Jews allowed to share positive or negative feedback (assuming it is real and fact-based) on other people with their evaluators?</strong> Would the laws of <em>lashon hara</em> apply differently if the feedback is entered in an IT application or discussed with a live person in a confidential conversation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>אין לך תועלת גדולה מזו!</p>\n\n<p>Chafetz Chaim writes that if Al is looking to go into business with Bob and I know that Bob will ruin everything, I am absolutely allowed -- and possibly required -- to tell Al my concerns; assuming my concerns are factual and as tone-neutral as possible; my intentions are to help rather than hurt; that speaking up will actually accomplish the outcome, and this is the least-damaging way to accomplish that outcome; and that Bob will not suffer disproportionately.

And that's where it gets tricky.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to R. Menahem HaMeiri the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements of a negative nature that are said for a specific reason (in this case providing useful feedback to one's employer), and not in order to hurt others, are permissible since by definition they are not <em>l'shon hara</em>. These are his words in is Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of this is also the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus even with a live person it would be permissible.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to to'elet, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n\n",

Why the dramatic change in Hashem's response to the complaining of the Jews? </p>\n\n<p>MY question seeks two answers. One, a distinction between the two episodes and two, perhaps a thematic answer comparing the nature of the Jews in Shemos vs Bamidbar.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Shmos 16:2 was the initial complaint when they left Egypt because they had not yet learned to fully trust in Hashem. He sent the manna and gave them the chance to learn how to follow his orders. Note that He gave them the chance to not leave any over and to refrain from gathering on Shabbat. 17:2 contains the complaint about water and the miracle of striking the rock. It is followed them by the punishment of Amalek attacking.</p>\n\n<p>Bamidbar is 40 years later and they should have learned the lesson of Hashem having given them the manna and the water for the entire trek in the dessert. Rav Hirsch points out the it begins with them acting as if they were in mourning for their own death. They in effect talked themselves into rebelling and complaining. Additionally, they did not actually have anything that they could justify complaining. Hashem caused the fire to break out at the end of the camp and they cried to Moshe (before anyone was killed) and Moshe prayed for them and the fire (caused by them) died down. Rav Hirsch says that they <code>were bad in the Ears of Hashem</code> since they deliberately set themselves against Hashem and deliberately complained.</p>\n\n<p>After this they talked themselves into complaining about the manna and pretending that it was too bland and boring.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch states that they let the Eirev Rav act as a poison in their midst and pull them down. Instead of being a minority in the world that would raise the other nations, they allowed the minority in them to pull them down.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Numbers 11:21:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וַיֹּאמֶר֮ מֹשֶׁה֒ שֵׁשׁ־מֵא֥וֹת אֶ֙לֶף֙ רַגְלִ֔י הָעָ֕ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר\n  אָנֹכִ֖י בְּקִרְבּ֑וֹ וְאַתָּ֣ה אָמַ֗רְתָּ בָּשָׂר֙ אֶתֵּ֣ן לָהֶ֔ם\n  וְאָכְל֖וּ חֹ֥דֶשׁ יָמִֽים׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And Moses said: ‘The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand\n  men on foot; and yet Thou hast said: I will give them flesh, that they\n  may eat a whole month!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You can understand the difference clearly via Sifrei Bamidbar 95:1. I am excerpting some parts from Sefaria.org's English translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Shimon b. Yochai said: R. Akiva expounded this in one way,\n  and I, in two ways, and my words seem more cogent. R. Akiva expounds\n  it plainly, viz. (Ibid. 22) \"If flocks and herds are slaughtered for\n  them will it be sufficient for them?\" Even if you give them all the\n  flocks and herds (in the world), will it be sufficient for them? And I\n  understand it as follows: \"If flocks and herds are slaughtered for\n  them will it be sufficient for them?\" Even if you give them all the\n  flocks and herds in the world, they would grumble. For is it because\n  they have no meat that they are grumbling? Is it not written of the\n  exodus from Egypt (Shemot 12:38) \"And also a great mixture (of\n  proselytes) went up with them, and flocks and herds, etc.\"? I might\n  think they ate them in the desert. It is, therefore, written (Bamidbar\n  32:1) \"And the sons of Reuven and the sons of Gad had much cattle,\n  etc.\" It is only that they were looking for a pretext to abandon the\n  L-rd. (Ibid. 11:22) \"If all the fish of the sea are gathered for\n  them\"? Even if you gave them all the fish in the sea they would\n  grumble. For is it because they have no fish that they are grumbling?\n  Did not the well of Miriam accompany them in the desert and supply\n  them with more than their fill of fish? It is only that they were\n  looking for a pretext to abandon the L-rd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, in the 1st occurrence, in Exodus, they didn't have food because the dough (matzah) ran out. So asking for bread was legit. Asking for meat wasn't as legit. because, technically, man does not need meat to survive. But G-d accommodated them, at that time.</p>\n\n<p>In the 2nd situation, it was clear that they had sufficient food and fish, among other items. There was no reason to complain.</p>\n\n\n",

No fuel may be ignited on the Sabbath (including, for example, pouring more oil into a burning lamp). (See at length <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31478&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ibn Ezra's Short Commentary ad loc.</a>, where he records a debate he had with a Karaite on the matter.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, Jews following that interpretation have traditions that enhance comfort on the Sabbath like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbat_candles\" rel=\"nofollow\">lighting candles</a> before the Sabbath to be able to see at night, and leaving ovens on from before Sabbath to be able to eat <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholent\" rel=\"nofollow\">hot food</a>. In the early middle ages this dispute became quite a shibboleth, with Jews who didn't eat hot food on the Sabbath being accused of heresy. Some more about the Rabbinical responses to that can be found in Hebrew <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/veyakhel/kla.html#_ftnref9\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Spoken Law recorded in the Talmud gives many more details of prohibited labor on the Sabbath than what you'd see in a strict literal reading of the verse. Moses <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=35\">commands the people</a> to keep the Sabbath, and then to build the Tabernacle. The Talmud concludes that any act of physical creation used to build the Tabernacle is prohibited \"work\" on the Sabbath. For instance you'll never find a verse that weaving is prohibited on Sabbath, but traditional Judaism follows the Talmud that as it was an act of labor building the Tabernacle, it's prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>(The commentaries address why Exodus chose to single out kindling over any other labor; one suggestion is that kindling tends to be an enabler rather than the final product for many labors -- I am kindling so I can dye this wool or cast this gold -- and yet it is still prohibited.)</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud's interpretation of the prohibition of kindling includes both starting and fueling a flame. Therefore adding fuel to an existing fire would be prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>As for how people managed: ideally, leave enough wood around from before the Sabbath to last the whole day. Otherwise, often a non-Jew was asked (or employed) to add fuel. While generally we try to avoid asking a non-Jew to do labor on the Sabbath that we can't do, there is a dispensation for those who are unwell, and we don't want people to get frostbite.</p>\n\n\n",

I think it belongs here too.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is known that the heathen in those days built temples to stars, and set up in those temples the image which they agreed upon to worship; because it was in some relation to a certain star or to a portion of one of the spheres. We were, therefore, commanded to build a temple to the name of God, and to place therein the ark with two tables of stone, on which there were written the commandments \"I am the Lord,\" etc., and \"Thou shalt have no other God before me,\" etc. Naturally the fundamental belief in prophecy precedes the belief in the Law, for without the belief in prophecy there can be no belief in the Law. But a prophet only receives divine inspiration through the agency of an angel. Comp. \"The angel of the Lord called\" (Gen. xxii. 15); \"The angel of the Lord said unto her\" (ibid. xvi. 11); and other innumerable instances. Even Moses our Teacher received his first prophecy through an angel. \"And an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the flame of fire\" (Exod. iii.). It is therefore clear that the belief in the existence of angels precedes the belief in prophecy, and the latter precedes the belief in the Law...From the preceding remarks it is clear that the belief in the existence of angels is connected with the belief in the Existence of God; and the belief in God and angels leads to the belief in Prophecy and in the truth of the Law. In order to firmly establish this creed, God commanded [the Israelites] to make over the ark the form of two angels. The belief in the existence of angels is thus inculcated into the minds of the people, and this belief is in importance next to the belief in God's Existence; it leads us to believe in Prophecy and in the Law, and opposes idolatry. If there had only been one figure of a cherub, the people would have been misled and would have mistaken it for God's image which was to be worshipped, in the fashion of the heathen; or they might have assumed that the angel [represented by the figure] was also a deity, and would thus have adopted a Dualism. By making two cherubim and distinctly declaring \"the Lord is our God, the Lord is One,\" Moses clearly proclaimed the theory of the existence of a number of angels; he left no room for the error of considering those figures as deities, since [he declared that) God is one, and that He is the Creator of the angels, who are more than one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rambam, Guide for the Perplexed 3:45</p>\n\n<p>The TL;DR for this is that the belief in one G-d, and a multiplicity of angels is fundamental to the law. Without angels, there would be no prophecy, and therefore, there would be no Torah. Therefore, the image of angels were placed in the temple to solidify belief in angels. If only one image was in there, it would have been assumed that either the angel was hashem himself being worshiped, or it would have been believed that there was only one angel, which would be a form a dualism. Therefore, two images were placed in the temple to teach the unity of hashem and the multiplicity of angels.</p>\n\n<p>Because this teaching is fundamental to Judaism, hashem established the images of the angels as a positive commandment. A positive commandment always overrides a negative commandment. The worship of graven images is a negative commandment that one should die before violating. However, as the purpose of these images is to establish the foundation of torah, the exact opposite of idolatry, it is not a concern that they will be worshiped.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Purpose of \"tana'im\" today\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many Orthodox Jewish weddings I have attended, there is a short ceremony at the groom's table called \"tana'im\". <a href=\"http://www.artchazin.com/html/shtar_tenaim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This site</a> explains: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>These are conditions agreed upon by the couple; both parties accept\n  several conditions related to the partnership of bride, groom and\n  their families. They consist of the agreed wedding date, as well as\n  the financial liabilities of the two parties. The contract is binding\n  on both parties, in case of a breach of conditions the offender must\n  pay compensation. This contract is signed by two witnesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It also states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the parents undertake to provide financial support until the wedding\n  and to make sure the children have the clothing articles they need. It\n  ends by stating a date for the wedding ceremony.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I have several questions regarding the document and the ceremony itself:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Why is this document necessary, esp. if it is first signed on the day of the wedding? Is it the equivalence of <em>nissuin</em> in any way?</li>\n<li>It says that the parent's agree to financial support. In most families, the parents are already supporting their child, or the child is self-supporting, anyway and may not need or isn't relying on parent's support. What does this support mean or involve?</li>\n<li>In terms of financial support, IIRC, the ketubah places that obligation on the husband. Practically, then, if the chuppah will occur shortly thereafter, why even mention this part of parental support in the tana'im?</li>\n<li>Among some Hassidim, the tana'im is done a few months earlier at a \"vort\" ceremony. (A vort is a gathering of friends and family to celebrate the couple's engagement announcement.) Is there any reason why they do it earlier vs. on the wedding day?</li>\n<li>Does this document need to be read in public? If not, why do they do it? And why is this done in the groom's room only? If the bride is involved in this, shouldn't they repeat the reading in the bride's room?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong> - A link at the bottom of the site allows you to download a copy of the tana'im text.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The tanaim is actually a legal contract between the parents of the bride and groom. It specifies the financial and other arrangements that both sets of parents have agreed to. Originally, this was done well before the actual wedding in order to formalize the contractual requirements. This could include details such as which seat in shul would be given to the groom, how much each family would provide the couple, who would pay for what part of the wedding, where the couple would live, what kind of support would be provided, how long the groom would be allowed to learn, what he would do to support his family, ...</p>\n\n<p>Most of your questions come up because we no longer have the full necessity of the financial agreements that were required originally. Some references date tena'im tback to the 13th century when marriages were much more like commercial contracts that were similar to the merger of two companies or the creation of a spin-off corporation.</p>\n\n<p>The reason that it is done in the groom's room and read aloud is so that the fathers (who are the principals) will have agreed before witnesses that this is the contract that they are agreeing to. It is <strong>not</strong> the same as the kesuvah nor is it the same as the nissuin.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/tenaim-the-conditions-of-marriage/\" rel=\"nofollow\">An Old Ceremony</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From the 12th to the early 19th century, tenaim announced that two\n  families had come to terms on a match between their children. The\n  document setting out their agreement, also called tenaim, would\n  include the dowry and other financial arrangements, the date and time\n  of the huppah [the actual wedding ceremony], and a knas, or penalty,\n  if either party backed out of the deal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nowadays it is much less required, but it is used before the wedding in order to certify that there are no remaining disagreements that could cause the wedding to fall through.

This prevents someone from getting up and claiming that some condition has not been fulfilled and that the kiddushin is therefore null and void.</p>\n\n<p>One explanation of this document can be found at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/476750/jewish/Tnaim-Engagement-Agreements.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tnai'm -- Engagement Agreements</a> which first explains the current chabad custom (at the engagement) and then the non-chasidic custom (just before the wedding)</p>\n\n\n",

What is the list of special decontamination or other upgrade procedures necessary to convert a gentile kitchen to kosher use?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a very fundamental question that deserves a serious answer. I am attempting to provide one based on my own experience, and my knowledge that not everyone is prepared to consult an Orthodox rabbi about this (although they really should, and it is standard for Jews to do so about such matters). </p>\n\n<p>Basically, anything directly in contact with food during service or preparation needs to be formally \"kashered,\" unless it is new. This includes appliances; dishes; utensils; surfaces (countertops, sinks, shelves or drawers) with which warm or liquid or <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/kashurs-kurrents-2011/summer-kashrus-kurrents-2011/597/sharp-awareness-in-the-kitchen/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">piquant</a> items may make contact; and all cleaning tools for the items above, such as sponges, dish brushes, and the dishwasher. Anything that cannot be kashered must be covered (preferably double-covered) with disposable material such as tinfoil or plastic for use. This is not always possible. </p>\n\n<p>If the item is not new, kashered, or covered, it may not be used in a kosher kitchen. (If it is used, it may render not only the food, but also other parts of the kitchen non-kosher.) If something becomes non-kosher, it then has to be re-kashered, covered for use, or replaced with a new item.</p>\n\n<p>Instructions for kashering various items can be found <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/Kashering_in_the_Kitchen.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. (If you learn that something \"cannot be kashered,\" that does not mean you can just use it in its current form; it means you must either buy a new one or cover it for use.)</p>\n\n<p>Once your kitchen is kosher, going forward, every dish, appliance, or surface--except those that will only be used for cold AND dry AND non-piquant items, without direct contact (such as refrigerator or pantry shelves)--must be designated for either meat or dairy. Usually, people buy dishes and utensils of two colors (often red and blue) and designate one for meat and one for dairy, or else they store everything separately, with labels. It is generally best to store meat and milk things separately (in different drawers/on different shelves) anyway. </p>\n\n<p>Foods that are parve--neither meat nor dairy--may be used on or with both categories. However, a single parve item may not be \"transitioned\" from one category to the next. (This is an oversimplification--actually the laws on this matter are quite subtle--but don't try it unless you know them.)   (Parve includes eggs and fish. Hechshers have <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10957/if-a-product-with-a-hechsher-doesnt-say-dairy-does-that-mean-its-pareve\">various ways</a> of indicating whether an item is truly parve; merely reading the ingredients list is not a reliable way to determine it.) (Some people have a third set of dishes for strictly parve food, because for complicated reasons this can be helpful at times--but it is not necessary.) </p>\n\n<p>Once your kitchen is kosher (=everything listed above has been covered, kashered, or replaced with new), in order to keep it kosher, you must observe laws of kosher food preparation at all times within your kitchen. If non-kosher food (OR kosher food of the wrong category--meat versus milk) has contact with your items, the items become non-kosher and will have to be, once again, covered, kashered, or replaced.  ((There are some occasions for leniency with this, especially if the contact was between two cold AND dry AND non-piquant food and surfaces, but a rabbi <em>must</em> be consulted.))</p>\n\n<p>Non-kosher food can enter your kitchen only if it is clearly identified, separated, and double-wrapped before being placed on any kosher surface. The same applies to food of the \"wrong\" type (meat or milk) being placed on a surface that is designated for the other type.</p>\n\n<p>The laws of kosher food preparation are extensive, but, for the purposes of keeping your kitchen kosher, they essentially boil(!) down to (1) only using ingredients with a <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/agency_list.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hechsher</a> (<a href=\"http://www.koshermarks.com/kosher-product-lists/no-hechsher/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some products</a>, such as fruits and vegetables, do not need to have one), and (2) keeping meat and dairy cooking completely separate. \"Meat\" cooking includes any cooking that has a meat ingredient, or was cooked, or includes anything cooked, on meat surfaces or dishes. This includes any kosher product labeled \"meat\"/\"fleishig,\" even if it does not appear to have meat in the ingredients. (It probably means it was cooked on meat dishes.) \"Dairy,\" similarly, includes any product labeled \"dairy\"/D/milk/\"milchig,\" or that has any dairy ingredients, or that was prepared on dairy equipment, or using dairy dishes. With regards to the last point--\"prepared on [meat/dairy] dishes\"--this is actually a complicated issue, but to be safe, consider something that was prepared on meat dishes to be a meat product, and vice versa. For a fuller overview of kosher cooking laws, see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/134459/jewish/Handbook.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>--</p>\n\n<p>There is one more point that is not technically related to kashrus, but that is very important if the kitchen is Jewish-owned. Anything made of metal or glass in your kitchen that it is possible to remove from the kitchen must, in that case, be \"toveled\" before use. <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/tevilas-keilim-a-primer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This</a> means <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1230791/jewish/Immersion-of-Vessels-Tevilat-Keilim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bringing it</a> to a mikvah (a ritual pool of water intended for this purpose)--or a natural body of water that <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ask-the-expert-using-the-ocean-as-a-mikveh/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has the status of a spring</a>--and dipping it in, often after saying a blessing. Metal and glass things that can't be removed from the kitchen have alternate procedures for tevila. (A discussion of some possibilities is <a href=\"http://matzav.com/how-to-use-a-keurig-without-destroying-it-in-the-mikva/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, but best to consult a rabbi.) Tevila is done after kashering (or after buying a new item) and must be completed before the item is used. Disposable items may be used, even multiple times, without tevila, if they are bought with the intention of being disposed.</p>\n\n<p>If something was given to you by a Jew, or purchased from a Jewish-owned company, you probably do not need to tovel it--see <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/1168/the-mitzvah-of-tevilas-keilim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> or ask a rabbi. </p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n",

However, is it strictly necessary to do this with eggs that have a hechsher on the box? Please provide an authoritative source.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all raw eggs do not need a hechsher according to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/crckosher/status/362688638007517185\" rel=\"nofollow\">CRC</a>, <a href=\"http://scrollk.org/guide-to-kashrus-does-it-need-a-hechsher/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Denver Vaad HaKashrut</a> and others. The presence of a hechsher on the box does <strong>not</strong> appear to be a factor in two major treatments of the topic.</p>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/kosher-professionals/eggs-and-blood-spots/\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion on blood in eggs</a>, the OU explains that, due to modern production methods, any blood spot found in eggs will never develop into an embryo and according to R Moshe Feinstein do not present a fundamental kashrut problem. As a result, the entire egg is never <em>assur</em> and <em>mei’ikar hadin</em> removal of the blood spot would suffice. <strong>However</strong> Rav Moshe writes that it is a proper practice to dispose of the entire egg even today, as eggs are not expensive and a person does not incur any significant loss. <strong>Therefore</strong>, the requirement to check each egg remains in effect, as does the requirement to dispose of eggs containing actual blood spots.</p>\n\n<p>On the practicalities, the OU writes that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>The accepted practice is to check each individual egg prior to use.</strong></li>\n  <li>If checking is overly difficult, such as at night on a camping trip, for example, where there is no available good light, one may eat\n  eggs without checking.</li>\n  <li>There is no problem with eating eggs cooked in the shell (boiled or roasted), even though these cannot be checked.</li>\n  <li>If one is in doubt whether the eggs have been checked, it is permitted to eat the food.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/broyde-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">detailed article on the topic</a>, R Michael Broyde expands on the Rema's statement (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.66.8?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">SA YD 66:8</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One does not have to check eggs to see if they have blood spot, as one\n  relies on the fact that most eggs do not; nonetheless, people have the\n  custom to be strict and check the eggs for blood spots when cooking\n  during the day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The crucial question is whether the halachic custom to check eggs must\n  still be observed or whether it is possible to be lenient on this\n  matter and simply not check any eggs generally. The answer to this\n  question is not simple. It might be that one does not have to check\n  eggs for blood spots, but when one is seen, it is still required to\n  remove it according to Jewish law, and <strong>thus, it is prudent to check\n  the eggs before placing them in a situation where it is difficult to\n  remove the blood spot.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>It is possible to conclude that Jewish law does not require that\n  one check eggs for blood spots prior to their use if one purchases\n  grade A or AA eggs from a supermarket in America, although there is a\n  minhag to check eggs, and one who checks for such eggs is in the\n  category of <em>Hamachmir tavo alav bracha</em>, (pious conduct for which one\n  is blessed for being strict). No less than six different reasons can\n  be provided to justify the practice of not checking eggs prior to\n  using them:</p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>The United States Department of Agriculture already requires that all eggs be checked for blood spots before they can be sold in a\n  supermarket as grade A or AA eggs. There was never a custom to check\n  twice for blood spots. </li>\n  <li>There are virtually never blood spots found in eggs sold in supermarkets in America that are a result of fertilization; thus no\n  biblical violation is ever present even if there is a blood spot in\n  the egg. The custom to check all eggs was limited to a society where\n  not checking might lead to a Torah violation. </li>\n  <li>There never was a custom to check for blood spots when all eggs derive from hens raised alone, in which case some authorities rule\n  that even the blood spot itself can be eaten. </li>\n  <li>The incidence of blood spots in Grade A or AA eggs sold in the supermarket is less than one in a thousand, and generally one does not\n  have to check for very infrequent rabbinic prohibitions. </li>\n  <li>Halacha never required that one check for blood spots; it was a custom, and the custom itself did not apply when it was difficult to\n  check, such as at night. Nowadays, given the way we cook, checking is\n  more difficult in a variety of settings. </li>\n  <li>If there is a blood spot in the egg, one will generally see it even after the egg has been opened, and one can remove the blood spot then.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Even though halacha does not require that one check every grade A or AA\n  egg purchased in a supermarket prior to using it, <strong>there might be\n  prudent reasons why a person might choose to do so, and this explains\n  the common practice of checking eggs found in many Ashkenazi homes.\n  Most significantly, if one sees a blood spot, one must remove it, and\n  it is easier to remove a blood spot prior to adding the egg to food\n  than afterwards.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>So, too, a person who purchases brown eggs, free\n  range eggs, organic eggs, or eggs sold at a farmers' market, has to\n  check those eggs, and thus it might simply be easier to check all eggs\n  than to monitor what type of egg one is using at any given time.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As always <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10103/how-do-you-cylor-after-posting-on-judaism-stackexchange-com\">CYLOR</a> for a practical ruling.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, the theme of rafa-ainu is healing a sick person and it would not be allowed to say a different type of bracha (such as for parnasa) at that point. However, the theme for shma koleinu is asking Hashem to answer our personal request. Thus, if one has a different problem, and is not sure wheich of the brachos is appropriate, or has thought of it after having passed the appropriate bracha, then one can add it in there. In fact, the reason that the yehi ratzon is written in the sidur is because we are not fluent in formulating such a personal prayer any more. One must write it out for onself beforehand in order not to stumble over the words if attempting to use ones own words.</p>\n\n<p>As an example, if one has been attacked by Lashon Hara, it might be possible to come up with an appropriate Yehi Ratzon for V'lamalshinim or for resolution of a court case in ...</p>\n\n<p>Since we are no longer expert in coming up with these prayers and determining which one it would belong in, we use shma koleinu and find appropriate prayers that those greater than us have written.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/jewish-law/daily-living/14-The-Daily-Prayer-Services.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">personal prayers</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One may add a personal prayer into any one of the 19 blessings,\n  providing that the supplication is relevant to the topic of the\n  blessing. For example, in the blessing of \"Rifa'einu\" (Health and\n  Healing), one may specifically ask that someone be healed from their\n  sickness.39 The exception to this rule is the blessing \"Shema Koleinu\"\n  (Acceptance of Prayer), where one may ask for any needs.</p>\n  \n  <p>The best place to say a personal supplication is \"Elokai Nitzor,\"\n  which is said after the 19th blessing.40 At this point, some also have\n  the custom to say a verse that contains their name, or that begins\n  with the first letter of their name and ends with the last letter of\n  their name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1242508/jewish/Can-I-Add-My-Own-Prayers-to-the-Amidah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Can I Add My Own Prayers to the Amidah?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For starters, you can insert a short personal prayer within each of\n  the middle 13 blessings of the Amidah. Such a prayer should fit the\n  theme of that specific blessing. For example, ask for the speedy\n  recovery of specific person within the blessing of Refa-enu (Heal us),\n  or pray for livelihood in the blessing of Barech Aleinu (G‑d grant\n  blessing).</p>\n  \n  <p>Requests that are unrelated to any of these 13 blessings can be added\n  to the blessing of Shema Koleinu (Hear our voice) since its theme is a\n  general request for our needs. Your personal prayer should be added\n  before the blessing's concluding words: ki attah shome'a tefilat kol\n  peh... (\"for You hear the words of every mouth...\").</p>\n  \n  <p>Another place for personal prayer is the end of the Amidah, before you\n  recite the second Yiheyu leratzon...

The period could end of Day 5 and she'd still be impure for all 7.</p>\n\n<p>For flows \"many days more than normal\", she waits for the flow to end and then needs 7 clean days.</p>\n\n<p>As you indicated, the practice that came into force in later Talmudic times is to avoid questions of \"normal\" vs. \"more than normal\", and thus to wait 7 clean days for everything.</p>\n\n<p>So the whole question is whether \"7 clean\" can be omitted if we're certain this is a \"normal\" period (that gets tricky), and instead to count seven impure days from the start of the period (assuming it ends before 7).</p>\n\n<p>From what I recall there was some theoretical discussion in the Conservative movement of going back to the biblical practice; practically most people either keep today's standard practice (wait 7 clean) or don't routinely keep mikvah laws.</p>\n\n<p>A \"kiruv\" rabbi in Orthodox outreach asked his mentors if he could tell a couple interested in increasing their observance to omit the 7-clean practice; they said no.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You are dealing with a very central issue. What is simple is always a bit wrong; but it may be good as an introduction, and you are going to understand why a secure common way has been setup by our teachers for all without exceptions and without possible recourse.</p>\n<p>\nA first notion that we want clarify is the notion of closure of the Talmud, see Rambam in the introduction to his Mishne Tora:\n<blockquote>.. הוֹאִיל וְכָל אוֹתָם הַדְּבָרִים שֶׁבַּגְּמָרָא הִסְכִּימוּ עֲלֵיהֶם כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל... <br>The entire people of Israel agreed every decision of the Talmud. </blockquote>\n</p>\n<p>An important point is a statement of the Talmud (Nidda, 66A)\n<blockquote>אמר ר' זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טפת דם כחרדל יושבות עליה שבעה נקיים\n<br>R`Zera stated: The daughters of Israel have imposed upon themselves the restriction that even if they observe a drop of blood of the size of a mustard seed they wait on account of it seven clean days.(Soncino's translation)</blockquote>\nand Brachot 31A<blockquote> ת''ר אין עומדין להתפלל לא מתוך דין ולא מתוך דבר הלכה אלא מתוך הלכה פסוקה והיכי דמי הלכה פסוקה אמר אביי כי הא דר' זירא דאמר ר' זירא בנות ישראל החמירו על עצמן שאפילו רואות טיפת דם כחרדל יושבת עליה שבעה נקיים<br>\nOur Rabbis taught: A man should not stand up to say Tefillah either immediately after trying a case or immediately after a [discussion on a point of] halachah; but he may do so after a halachic decision which admits of no discussion.\nOne example of decision that doesn't tolerate discussion? - Abaye said: Such a one as the following of Rabbi Zera; for Rabbi Zera said: The daughters of Israel have undertaken to be so strict with themselves that if they see a drop of blood no bigger than a mustard seed they wait seven [clean] days after it.\n</blockquote>\n</p>\n<p>After this introduction, \nwe can learn in Parashat Metsora two kind of \"Uterine Bleeding\": the first is called Nida and the second Zava. The first refers roughly to healthy menstruation, the second to an inter-menstrual bleeding (medical gynecologic terms exist for abnormal bleeding, for example dysmenorrhea). Normal (healthy) bleeding ends naturally within 7 days. A pathological one ends when the woman recovers. There is an alternation between Nidda and Ziva (intermenstrual bleeding) periods. We may lose count (roughly there are successions of 7 days of Nida and 11 days of Ziva. It's off topic to explain this in details). A range of interrelated stringencies will warrant that there wouln't be mistaking sexual intercourse in a banned period. For Nida bleeding the uncleanness is 7 days, immediately next to this, in the first evening after 7 days, immersion in Miqve allows marital relationship. In Zava Gedola, when the bleeding ceases, a count of 7 days without any bleeding is required, afterwards, even in the middle of day 7, before the evening, immersion may permit marital relation. We have accepted the following custom: to wait the evening because the original Tevilat Nidda requires to wait until the evening (op cit).</p>\n<p>If necessary we can get more technical delails, through the comment of Rashi in Megila 28b and Rabeynu Yona in Rif Brachot 21b.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This sort of thing is only done in a case by case private basis. I have heard of dispensations being given when the woman has an unusual period whereby she has been constantly in Rabbinic Niddah and needs to peel back these Rabbinic enactments to conceive.</p>\n<p>Another common dispensation is that she can go to the mikvah early, for convenience, but can't benefit from the purity until the end of that week.</p>\n\n\n",

However, if one does not have a Rabbi, how\nshould they go and find one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It depends on were you live and the type of person that you are. It also depends on the types of questions that you are asking. Many people choose a shul based on a rabbi that they are able to ask. Others will ask their rebbe to suggest who to get in touch with. I know someone whose chavrusa became a rav and who uses him. Some people will ask the rabbi of their shul who he relies on for difficult questions and will use the shul rav for the \"simple\" questions (such as kashrus). Some people approach the rabbi of their shul because they know that he will send the question on \"up the chain\" if it is out of his range of expertise.</p>\n\n<p>Some rabbonim are reluctant to get involved with certain types of questions and will reccomend someone to whom to have the questions referred. Some will not answer themselves but will expand the question and call it in themselves.</p>\n\n<p>You should speak to your local rabbi and ask him what he thinks. He will not be insulted, but will answer you seriously and to the best of his ability. If you are in an isolated area and there is no rabbi, then you can call the nearest community for help.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes calling a central location such as the OU or Yeshiva University or the RCA or Chabad can get you the names of people in your area. For example, a rabbi who has retired may be willing and able to answer questions while not having a congregation. Sometimes a person who has semicha from a Yeshiva who does not \"go into rabbanus\" will have his name available for consultation.</p>\n\n\n",

In reality, that\n  surface is always treif, because it gets splashings of milk and\n  splashings of meat. During the year, this is not a problem. Why?\n  Because first of all, you're careful that those splashings don't touch\n  what you're cooking. And if it does, then it all depends on whether\n  the splashings are \"edible food,\" and what the proportion is, etc.\n  Furthermore, if your stovetop is cleaned, then the only problem is\n  that it has absorbed milk and meat \"taste\" -- which we assume happened\n  more than 24 hours ago. So during the year, it's very unlikely that\n  these splashings can render your food \"non-kosher.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>On Passover, however, the 24-hour leniency doesn't apply. Something\n  that was used for chametz a year ago is still chametz. Consequently,\n  Passover food cannot touch your stovetop and it must be covered. The\n  easiest way is to take aluminum foil and cover the whole stove top.\n  Use the heavy-duty kind so it doesn't tear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They resolve the conflict by stating that in Avodah Zarah, it refers to advice where it is good to hear multiple opinions. (E.g., if you needed advice on career choice, where to live, etc.) But, regarding learning Gemarah (I assume this applies to any Torah learning), it is best to learn from one rav so that you don't blemish your learning.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/avot/8-2.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avot D'Rabi Natan 8:2</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היה רבי מאיר אומר: הלומד תורה מרב אחד למה הוא דומה? לאחד שהיה לו שדה\n  אחת, וזרע מקצתה חטים ומקצתה שעורים, מקצתה זיתים ומקצתה אילנות.  ונמצא\n  האדם ההוא מלא טובה וברכה.  ובזמן שלומד משניים שלושה, דומה למי שיש לו\n  שדות הרבה. אחת זרע חטין, ואחת זרע שעורים, ונטע אחת זיתים, ואחת אילנות.\n  ונמצא אדם ההוא מפוזר בין הארצות בלא טוב וברכה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Paraphrased translation: Rav Me'ir said that one who learns from a single rav is like someone who has one field and he plants a bit of wheat, barley, olives and trees. That person is filled with good and blessings.</p>\n\n<p>But if he learns from 2 or 3 people, it is like someone who owns many fields. In each field, he plants only one of each of the items mentioned above. In the end, he is a person scattered among all the lands with no goodness and no blessing.</p>\n\n<p>The analogy, here, is that a single rav helps one organize his thoughts and gives him purpose to what he is doing. You can think of the planting of the seeds to being analogous to a person's thoughts, desires, and questions. They're all different. But directed to a single rav, that rav directs him how to organize all this and he gets a blessing by being focused and directed vs. getting multiple opinions and senses of direction from different people - even if they are all ravs.</p>\n\n\n",

The techum Shabbos only starts slightly more than 70 amos beyond the last house of the yishuv. As long as there are houses/buildings within 70 amos (~140 feet/~43 metres), you are still within the yishuv and don't start measuring the 2000 amos of the techum (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 398:6).</p>\n\n<p>Since most people live within large populated areas, they would get tired of walking long before they would exit the techum.

The verses quoted in the OP address those laws. <br>\nA large number of verses matters laws of uncleanness-cleanness. There are <b>performative statements</b>. You can see also that the books counting the Mitzvot \"Sifrey Mitzvot\" include it in the 613. But it must be carefully examined. I will quote one excerpts from verses and from Sefer Hachinuch: A verse (numbers 19, 19) says:<blockquote> And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day; and on the seventh day he shall purify him; and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even</blockquote>\nChinuch 399 שנצטוינו בדיני מי נדה, כלומר, בדיני מי הזיה, דהינו מים חיים מערבים באפר פרה, שמזין בהם על הטמאים\n<b>We were ordained to follow laws</b>..., \nThere is a controversy between Rambam and Ramban if we should count laws of cleanness-uncleanness among the 613.

R`JUDAH SAYS: HE SAYS THE GRACE BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER (Soncino)\n</blockquote>\n<p>\nI will quote the Bartenura on the Mishna concerning Baal Qeri as an abstract of Gemara and Rambam, and then I will try to explain through  reading a few lines of Gemara.\nBartenura:<blockquote>עֶזְרָא תִּקֵּן שֶׁלֹּא יִקְרָא בַּעַל קֶרִי בַּתּוֹרָה בֵּין שֶׁרָאָה קְרִי לְאוֹנְסוֹ בֵּין ‏לִרְצוֹנוֹ עַד שֶׁיִּטְבֹּל. וְלֹא מִפְּנֵי טֻמְאָה וְטָהֳרָה שֶׁאֵין דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה מְקַבְּלִין טֻמְאָה אֶלָּא כְּדֵי שֶׁלֹּא יִהְיוּ תַּלְמִידֵי חֲכָמִים מְצוּיִין אֵצֶל נְשׁוֹתֵיהֶן כְּתַרְנְגוֹלִים ... וּכְבָר נִפְסְקָה הַהֲלָכָה דְּבִטְּלוּהָ לִטְבִילוּתָא, וּבַעֲלֵי קֶרְיִין קוֹרִין קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע כְּדַרְכָּן וְעוֹסְקִין בַּתּוֹרָה וּמִתְפַּלְּלִין וּמְבָרְכִין כָּל הַבְּרָכוֹת וְאֵין מְעַרְעֵר בַּדָּבָר ‏<br>\nEzra ordinate that a man after having seminal emission do not read Torah, no matter if this emission was adventitious or deliberate, until he immerse in Mikve. The reason for this is not uncleanness, since words of Torah are not susceptible of uncleanness, but the aim is to avoid that scholar might always be with their wives like cocks.\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Ezra's ordinance about men with a Status of baal keri</h2> \n<br>\n<b>Torah doesn't need cleanness</b>: See Gemara Brachot 22a\n<blockquote>On the basis of this they laid down that sufferers from (gonorrhoea) [urethral discharge, gleet], lepers, and those who had intercourse with niddoth are permitted to read the Torah, the Prophets and the Hagiographa, and to study the Mishnah, [Midrash] the Talmud, halachoth and haggadoth, but {despite uncleanness they may be in fear and trembling (according to Rashi)} a ba'al keri is forbidden {his uncleanness is a consequence of lightness and pretentiousness}.</blockquote>\n<h3>The ordinance of Ezra</h3> \nEzra ordinates a law concerning this specific uncleanness. A man after having a seminal emission is not allowed to read Torah until he clean himself in a Mikve.<br> The ordinance is not a \"pure novelty\", see Gemara 21B about matan tora.\n<blockquote>But has not R`Joshua B`Levi said: How do we know that a ba'al keri is forbidden to study the Torah?  Because it says, Make them known unto thy children and thy children's children, and immediately afterwards, The day that thou stoodest [before the Lord thy God in Horeb], implying that just as on that occasion those who had a seminal issue were forbidden, so here too those who have a seminal issue are forbidden?\n</blockquote> \nWe learn from matan Torah a link between Torah and cleanness (Tum'at keri, 'uncleanness from semen').<br>\n<b>Bet Din after the generation of Ezra extended the ordinance to prayer</b> too (Rambam tefila 4, 4; as shows the next mishna, \"he was praying and he recalled that he was baal keri...\")\n<h3>The intention of the ordinance</h3>\nRabbi Bartenura (following Rambam (sefer Ahava hilchot Tefila chapter 4, halacha 4)) says that the purpose was in order that scholars might not always be with their wives like cocks. <br>\n<i>We will see that this is an interpretation of the Gemara and <b>not a citation of the Gemara</b>. The sources are probably  3 passages of Gemara</i>: 1.- the gemara (22A) cited bellow that contain the expression \"with their wives like cocks (teacher who was teaching in a low voice, that avoided to spread widely, that it suffice to use 9 kabin), 2.- the Brayta that point discrepancy between Baal keri and the other uncleans (zav, boel niddah, etc), 3.- and the following Gemara in 22B: \n<blockquote>Ezra ordained that a <i>healthy man whose emission is voluntary</i> must immerse in forty se'ahs</blockquote>  \nThey built a new statement. The legislative intent was to prevent an excessive amount of marital relation among Scholars. \n<h3>But this ordinance don't spread in all Israel, and most people failled to follow it, consequently it would annulled <sub>(Rambam Kriat Shema 4, 8)</sub></h3> \nThey are now allowed to learn torah, pray and bless.</p><br>\nIn this, we follow the words of the Rambam.\nGemara 22A<blockquote>R' Nahman Bar Isaac said: It has become the custom to follow these three elders, … and R' Judah Ben Bathyra in the matter of words of Torah.  (see above in Gemara : R'Judah B`Bathyra used to say: Words of Torah are not susceptible of uncleanness) … etc.… When Ze'iri came [from Palestine], he said: They have abolished the ritual (ablution) [immersion].</blockquote>\nThen, the Gemara comment a Berayita that says <blockquote>A ba'al keri on whom nine kabs of water have been thrown is clean</blockquote>\nAnd they debate about the dissemination of this teaching:<blockquote>The one who taught 'he whispered it' thought that the reason was in order that scholars might not always be with their wives like cocks.</blockquote>\nThe Rif wrote:<blockquote>‏   איכא מאן דאמר האי דאמרי בטלוה לטבילוטא בין לדברי תורה בין לתפילה ואיכא דאמרי הני מילי לדברי תורה אבל לתפילה צריך בטיבלה ולאו טבילה דווקא אלא רחיצה בט' קבין. וכתב רבינו האי גאון זצ\"ל כיון דגמרא ליכא בהאי מילתא נקוט מנהג כל ישראל שכל בעלי קריין אף על פי שאין להם מים אין מתפללים עד שירחצו.  ‏</blockquote>\n<h3>Is the ordinance entirely or partially cancelled?</h3>\n<p>The Rif concluded following Rav Hayi Gaon that <b>for prayer</b> the ordinance has not been annulled (see also Tosfot) and Baal Keri need at least 9 Kabim.</p>\n<p>But Rabenu Yona and Rambam do not agree and the Shulchan Aruch follows the Rambam and wrote that <b>the \"Ezra's immersion\" was completely cancelled</b> <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x454\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S.A. O.C. 88</a></p> <p>Magen Avrohom, cited in Mishna Brura calls those the continue the minhag as Anshey maasse (people with a great behavior). <b>This minhag is laudable</b> (note that it is <i> different from the 'daily Tevila'. Daily tvila is not needed if a man is not Baal keri. On the contrary, in Gemara we see several evidences that prove that scholar were not going to Mikve if they were not baal keri</i>). {In Gemara, different types of Baal keri are distinguished, immersion in mikve and 9 kabim water thrown, in Rishonim, dinim of Chatsitsa, Kelim and Sheuvim. see in poskim}</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Responsa Tiferes Tzvi, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9175&st=&pgnum=119&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh De'ah Vol. 2 #27</a> writes that according to the Rambam, Tosefos, and the Rosh, a man who has an emission (ba'al keri) does not become completely <em>tahor</em> through immersion in a <em>mikvah</em> so long as he has a more serious <em>tumah</em>, the impurity of contact with a corpse, which all of us have today and are unable to remove. For this reason he writes that there is no <em>mitzvah</em> for him to become <em>tahor</em>, as the <em>mitzvah</em> is only to become completely <em>tahor</em>, which he cannot do. A sample quote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומיהו בשאר ישראל למצוה ודאי לא שייך זה דהמצוה רק שיהיה טהור וכיון דטמא בלאו הכי ועומד מה מצוה יש בסילוק הוספת הטומאה.</p>\n<p>However, for non-Kohanim there certainly is no <em>mitzvah</em>, as the <em>mitzvah</em> is to be <em>tahor</em>, and since he remains <em>tameh</em> regardless, what <em>mitzvah</em> is there in removing the \"extra\" <em>tumah</em>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the imperative referred to in the verse is to become completely <em>tahor</em>, and since that is not possible under current circumstances, there is no way to fulfill the imperative in the verse.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is mandatory for the second seder?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My mother-in-law heard this: Because the second seder outside Israel is a rabbinic ordinance, we can be more lenient. One can go through the mandatory sections of the seder (such as discussing pesach, matza and maror) within a half hour.</p>\n<p>This will be our first seder by ourselves. Nightfall isn't until 9:30 PM. And I'm the father of two small girls. I'd like to be able to have a meaningful second seder with them, without forcing them to stay up past midnight, and without zooming through the words.</p>\n<p>What parts of the second seder can be done before nightfall? Which must be done after nightfall?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In fact, many aspects of the first seder are also Rabbinical. However, there is no difference: everything done at the second seder is identical to the first seder (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.496.2?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 496:2</a>). Kiddush - the first stage of the seder - must be after nightfall (O.C. 472:1 - look up halachik nightfall for your location at myzmanim.com).</p>\n\n<p>That said, the Maggid (story) section of the seder is not actually that long. Even with everyone taking turns reading it around the table, it doesn't take more than about 45 minutes. Telling your children about the slavery and leaving Egypt is the main mitzva, and you should do that in your own words if they are too young to appreciate the words of the Hagada. You could then quickly read through Maggid in the Hagada to yourself, which wouldn't take more than a few minutes.</p>\n\n<p>When my kids were little, we made a big deal of the end of Maggid with the list of the 10 plagues (acting out the plagues, plastic frogs/farm animals/wild animals, hole-punch circles for dust/lice, etc). Then we got to eating matza and marror, fed them a little, and put them to bed.</p>\n\n<p>The four cups must be drunk in order after saying their accompanying parts of the seder (i.e. the first cup is kiddush, the second cup after maggid, the third cup after birkat hamazon, and the fourth cup after hallel - O.C. 472:8). Potentially some sections of Maggid could be skipped (heard from Rav Yitzchok Berkovits) but it's not going to make a difference in attention span for little kids - if the question was teenagers it would be worth consideration.</p>\n\n<p>If they are too young for to stay up (give them a nap in the afternoon!) then the suggestion of doing a model seder earlier is excellent. </p>\n\n\n",

The animal <strong>translated</strong> as \"rabbit\" (arneves) is <code>ma-alei geira</code> but has no split hooves. The rabbit does not have multiple stomachs and is not a ruminant, but it does \"rechew\" its food. Thus it is \"Maalei Geirah\" (which is a kosher sign) but does not have split hooves - which is why it is not kosher.

If the teacher let students keep the test, the teacher can't prevent students from sharing the test with future students.

Even checking a majority of the vegetable in question is insufficient, let alone \"sample\" checking (Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 84:8 - the Rema explains that when the Shulchan Aruch says \"Vegetables which are normally buggy must be checked\" it means \"even if it's only a significant minority of the time\").</p>\n\n<p>The question is, how often is \"a significant minority\"? R'Elyashiv apparently told authorities outside of Israel that they could be lenient until about 15% (heard from Rav Yitchok Berkovits). Rav Moshe Vaye (in Bedikat Mazon K'Halacha) wants closer to 6%. Rav Wosner says anything that would be unsurprising to find - even if it's a tiny statistical likelyhood, 1% or less - requires checking. A common compromise approach is the Shut Mishkenos Yaakov which says 10%.</p>\n\n<p>Kashrut agencies each decide which approach for \"significant minority\" they will use (which is technically a \"minhag\" of psak halacha/halachik decision), then must observe how buggy each given type of produce is in their area. There can be major variation even in the same fruit or vegetable based on source, shipment and storage methods, climate, etc., so what is frequently buggy in one place may not be problematic in another. Therefore it is best to follow recommendations of a reliable authority as geographically close to you as possible.</p>\n\n<p>Checking a few random samples as an approach is harder to place a source on (it appears to be related to YD 84:9, but that's not direct), and is suggested by Kashrut agencies in cases when the vegetable in question does not strictly require checking, or it is questionable whether the vegetable requires checking.</p>\n\n\n",

But you almost never hear people say, \"According to the Rishonim\"; instead you hear about individual Rishonim, as in \"According to Rashi...\" Why is this? <em>Why do we treat Chazal as a single entity when it obviously isn't so?</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps it is for the reason that the Kesef Mishna (hilchos Mamrim 2:1) gives for why later generations cannot argue on earlier generations (see inside for specific details in this regard). His reason is that on the day that the mishna was completed everyone accepted not to argue on that which was written in it, and the same goes for the day that the talmud was completed. If so, it makes sense that we would refer to chazal as one unit, because the mishna and gemara were accepted as totally authoritative texts without exception.</p>\n<p>It should be noted, however, that the Chazon Ish (on the Rambam there) argues on this Kesef Mishna and says that the only reason we don't argue on earlier generations is because we can't even begin to fathom their genius, so to argue on them is an excersize in futility, and he says that only Rav - the amorah - had the authority to argue on tana'im due to his unusual genius (which is really his way of asking a kashya on the Kesef Mishna, because according to the Kesef Mishna, there shouldn't be any exceptions, so why do we say רב תנא הוא ופליג, Rav is [like] a Tana and can argue).

For the epoch and\n  for the barley crop ripening and for the fruit of the trees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Currently, our fixed calendar is concerned only with the 1st reason as the other two applied only during Temple times. A Judaic leap year occurs every 2 or 3 years, according to our current \"fixed\" calendar system.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of this idea is that we want to make sure that 16 Nissan occurs in the Spring season, i.e. after the Spring Equinox, which is March 20 or 21.</p>\n\n<p>A Judaic non-leap year ranges between 353 and 355 days. Thus, each Judaic non-leap year, Pesach will be between approx. 10 to 12 days earlier on the solar calendar than the previous year.</p>\n\n<p>Last year, Pesach was on April 4, 2015. Had this year not been a Judaic leap year, Pesach would have occurred at its earliest (assuming a 354 day year) on March 24 (subtracting 12 days would have placed Pesach on a Monday which is not possible, so it would have occurred on Tues. March 24.) This still after the Spring Equinox.</p>\n\n<p>As a matter of fact, it seems that whenever there is a 2-year interval, had that leap year not been there, Pesach would still have been after the Spring equinox. (See 5784 / Greg. 2024 as another example.)</p>\n\n<p>Why, then are leap years sometimes placed at the 2-year interval, when, seemingly, it may not be necessary?</p>\n\n<p>I haven't looked at the full possibility that a leap year could possibly occur exactly every 3rd year. I have to experiment with that. However, my main question is why we don't make a leap year only when it's really needed, rather than a year before it's needed. I suspect that there some efficiency in doing it the way we have it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If the leap year occurred every third year, the drift would accumulate too much. For ease of calculation use 354 days per \"normal\" lunar year and 384 days per leap year. This means that there would be 1,092 days in three years while there are 1,095.75 solar days in three years. This would mean that the residual drift would be a full extra month every 30 years.</p>\n\n<p>Our current calendar (of seven leap years in a 19 year cycle give 6936 days per cycle which compares to 365.25 x 19 = 6,939.75 days in 19 solar cycles. Note that I used only the mean calculation. The extra days even this out even more. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason that we use a fixed calendar is because we do not have a court with the authority to change the calendar.

Part of this is the difference between the Julian and Gregorian calculation of not having a leap year in 3 out of 4 century years. This is also the reason that the time to start saying V'Sein Tal U'Matar has drifted forward to December fifth over the centuries between the setting up of the calendar and today.

However we cannot change the calendar until we actually have a Sanhedrin with the authority to make any needed changes.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted, that since Pesach must be the fifteenth of Nisan, we cannot define the occurrance of Pesach as the \"first full moon after the Solar equinox\". We had to define the calendar so that Rosh Chodesh Nisan (on the lunar calendar) occurs as close (before) that point as possible. Once the calendar was set up, we no longer had the authority to skip a leap year or change the spacing one time to account for the millenial drift.</p>\n\n<p>I deal with the matter on my blog at <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2013/12/what-will-happen-to-calendar-if.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">What will happen to the calendar if the Sanhedrin is re-instituted</a></p>\n\n\n",

He came upon a certain place and stopped there for the night, for the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of that place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place. He had a dream; a <strong>stairway</strong> was set on the ground and its top reached to the sky, and messengers of God were going up and down on it. And standing beside him was יהוה, who said, “I am יהוה, the God of your father Abraham’s [house] and the God of Isaac’s [house]: the ground on which you are lying I will assign to you and to your offspring. Your descendants shall be as the dust of the earth; you shall spread out to the west and to the east, to the north and to the south. All the families of the earth shall bless themselves by you and your descendants. Remember, I am with you: I will protect you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, “Surely יהוה is present in this place, and I did not know it!” Shaken, he said, “How awesome is this place! This is none other than the abode of God, and that is the gateway to heaven.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is this stairway? And how or why are angels ascending and descending?</p>\n<p>What is going on here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.org/details/derpentateuchber01hirs/page/375\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Hirsch on Pasuk 12</a> says that the ladder (the communication medium) was set up from the heaven to the Earth and was placed there deliberately (not by chance) by Hashem <strong>to</strong> the Earth. However, its primary purpose is not only from Heaven to Earth, but to allow the movement from Earth to heaven. That is the entire goal of (human) life on Earth is to work its way up to a heavenly high goal. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also says that he sees the messengers of Hashem going up to obtain the knowledge of the ideal and then come down to compare this ideal with what is actually found on Earth. Thus, it is determined how the angels must behave towards any particular human, based on how close to the ideal he actually comes.</p>\n\n<p>A third point that Rav Hirsch brings is that Hashem is not at the top of the ladder but next to Yaakov. Yaakov sees all the forces of nature (using the term Elokim) having to go up to learn what to do and what the ideal is. However Hashem (Yud Hai Vav Hai) is actually there with him. He actually is there to nourish and develop the seed of kedusha on the Earth. Yaakov does not need to seek hashem in heaven, he finds Hashem next to him. We see just as with Hashem putting the Shechinah in the midst of the camp, that Hashem makes the pure human beings like the Avos the true <code>bearers of the Glory of hashem</code> which wants to have its home primarily on Earth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Bar Kapra offers the following understanding in <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01633_part_7.html#HtmpReportNum0000_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midrash Rabbah 68:12</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תָּנֵי בַּר קַפָּרָא לֵית חֲלוֹם שֶׁאֵין לוֹ פִּתְרוֹן, וְהִנֵּה\n  סֻלָּם, זֶה הַכֶּבֶשׁ. מֻצָּב אַרְצָה, זֶה מִזְבֵּחַ (שמות כ, כד):\n  מִזְבַּח אֲדָמָה תַּעֲשֶׂה לִי, וְרֹאשׁוֹ מַגִּיעַ הַשָּׁמַיְמָה,\n  אֵלּוּ הַקָּרְבָּנוֹת שֶׁרֵיחָן עוֹלֶה לַשָּׁמַיִם. וְהִנֵּה מַלְאֲכֵי\n  אֱלֹהִים, אֵלּוּ כֹּהֲנִים גְּדוֹלִים. עֹלִים וְיֹרְדִים בּוֹ, שֶׁהֵם\n  עוֹלִים וְיוֹרְדִים בַּכֶּבֶשׁ.

Some people believe that circumcision is to remove a defect in man's formation; but every one can easily reply: How can products of nature be deficient so as to require external completion, especially as the use of the fore-skin to that organ is evident. This commandment <b>has not been enjoined as a complement to a deficient physical creation</b>, but as a means for perfecting man's moral shortcomings. The bodily injury caused to that organ is exactly that which is desired; it does not interrupt any vital function, nor does it destroy the power of generation. Circumcision simply counteracts excessive lust; for there is no doubt that circumcision weakens the power of sexual excitement, and sometimes lessens the natural enjoyment: the organ necessarily becomes weak when it loses blood and is deprived of its covering from the beginning. Our Sages (Beresh. Rabba, c. 80) say distinctly: It is hard for a woman, with whom an uncircumcised had sexual intercourse, to separate from him. <b>This is, as I believe, the best reason for the commandment concerning circumcision</b>. And who was the first to perform this commandment? Abraham, our father! of whom it is well known how he feared sin; it is described by our Sages in reference to the words, \"Behold, now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon\" (Gen. xii. 11).\n</blockquote>\n<b>To reach spiritual perfection, we must abandon physic perfection.

It is a way to express' parents <em>hakarat hatov</em> (gratitude) to God for the gift of a girl.

The baby and her mother\n  are usually in attendance, but since this is a primarily Orthodox\n  community, only the men are called up for aliyot, the honor of saying\n  the blessings before and after the public reading of a section of the\n  Torah.

Then the\n  words “avi habat,” or “father of the daughter,” are called out. That\n  is the congregation’s cue to start singing traditional songs for\n  welcoming girls. The songs, based on poems dating back to 14th and\n  15th century Spain, are known as pizmonim.

I've always been under the impression that the classification of \"Chok\" is used for commandments that are beyond human comprehension. The prohibition against doing the service intoxicated doesn't seem like it would fall under that category.</p>\n<p>The above assumption is based on what is the quintessential Chok: The Parah Adumah. In Bamidbar 19:2, the Torah describes the Parah Adumah with the same phrase: \"זֹאת חֻקַּת הַתּוֹרָה\", and Rashi there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב בה חקה, גזירה היא מלפני ואין לך רשות להרהר אחריה</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Torah uses the term “statute.” I have decreed it; You have no right to challenge it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi clearly says the term \"Chok\" (at least by Parah Adumah) is a classification of Mitzvos beyond human comprehension. However, I don't know offhand of any other examples (besides this question) where the term \"Chok\" is used, and whether it refers to a Mitzvah beyond human comprehension or not.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if any of the commentators comment on this?</p>\n<p>As an aside, I looked into the Sefer Hachinuch to see if maybe it gave a reason, and it said that the reason for this prohibition is \"Pashut\", which adds to the question of why the wording of חֻקַּת is used (unless I'm simply misunderstanding the word חֻקַּת).</p>\n\n\n",

The evidence is the wives in <em>Yirm'ya</em> [44:15].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, as to the golden calf, <em>Rashi</em> (<em>Sh'mos</em> 32:4) tells us:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"This is your god, Israel.\" \"This is our god\" was not said: [we see] from here that the <em>erev rav</em> who came up from Egypt [12:38] are the ones who gathered against <em>Aharon</em> [32:1] and they are the ones who made it, and then they caused Israel to stray after it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What was the calf made of? <em>Sh'mos</em> 32:2–3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Aharon</em> said to them: \"Remove the golden rings that are in your wives', sons', and daughters' ears, and bring them to me.\" So the entire people removed the golden rings that were in their [own] ears and brought [them] to <em>Aharon</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Pirke D'rabi Eliezer</em> (<a href=\"//he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%99_%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99_%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%9E%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">45</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The women heard and did not accept upon themselves to give their rings to their husbands, but told them \"you want to make a disgusting thing that has no power to save\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Likewise, <em>K'li Yakar</em> (ad loc. and, more clearly, to 35:22) explains that the men donated the jewelry and the women did not.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, these are disparate sources, and perhaps each doesn't agree with what the others say. But it seems likely to me that they do (perhaps because all of the above sources are widely known and widely accepted), in which case the question arises:</p>\n\n<p>If women are easy to seduce and particularly to idolatry, how is it that the <em>erev rav</em>'s seduction to idolatry failed specifically for the women? Or, if the women are specifically the ones who managed to withstand the <em>erev rav</em>'s seduction to idolatry, then why are they called easy to seduce and particularly to idolatry?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It would have been easy to answer according to Rashi in Ki Sisa 32 2 who says the reason Aharon told the men to take the jewelry from their wives and children was because he knew the women and children would not easily part with their beloved jewelry, and he was looking to stall the men. From this we could have said the action, or inaction of the women was not spiritually motivated, rather they were just protecting their jewelry.\nHowever, Rashi is apparently quoting the Tanchuma there 19(21) and the Tanchuma does go on to state the women's religious reasoning behind not involving themselves, much like the Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer you quote. </p>\n\n<p>And so in order to answer why the women did not in fact sin we can quote Radal on that Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer #19 who says 'it's quite possible the women had absolutely nothing to do with the egel as mentioned in Vayikra Rabba, and as we we see in various medrashim the women of that generation were more kosher than the men'. </p>\n\n<p>And so although in general, we assume women would be more easily swayed, that generation happened to have had especially righteous women who were not easily swayed. </p>\n\n\n",

By\ncontrast, the verb vesachnee’a (“subdue”) relates to kelipas nogah,3\nthe kelipah that encases a spark of holiness; though it must be\nhumbled, it can still be refined (HaYom Yom).תפא There are two aspects\nto kelipas nogah: a) its yeshus, or egocentricity; and b) the Divine\nspark that brings the material entity into being.

    "content": "# Difference Between Brit and Medical Circumcision\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have recently encountered a number of non-Jews who were protesting circumcision in front of the U.S. White House. While I found most of their notions somewhat absurd, I was given pause to question what the differences are between Medical Circumcision and a Kosher Brit.</p>\n\n<p>What is the minimum amount of tissue to be cut off? Is this the same in both Medical and Ritual Circumcision?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Besides the fact that a mohel is performing the bris in order to bring the baby into the covenant, and must handle it as a religious ritual, there are also differences in the medical procedure. The minimum amount required for a bris is more than that required for a surgical circumcision. There are also problems involved with the clamps that surgeons use. A \"bloodless\" circumcision is not allowed for a bris. Also there are discussions as to what <code>clamps</code> are allowed or forbidden for a bris, and specifically how to use them in appropriate ways.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.parenting.com/health-guide/circumcision/circumcision-procedure\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Ritual Circumcision</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A mohel’s technique is different from a surgeon’s: Clamps are\n  forbidden; instead a butterfly-shaped shield protects the glans while\n  the mohel removes the foreskin with a sharp scalpel. (In a bris, <strong>all\n  membrane below the corona of the penis must be removed, which is not\n  necessary in a medical circumcision</strong>.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/brit-milah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brit Milah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Milah in a forbidden fashion</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>We should begin by noting that milah comprises two elements: <strong>milah and\n  priah. Milah is the removal of the orlah (the foreskin), and priah is\n  the removal of the thin membrane which covers the flesh underneath.</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch rules, in accordance with the Gemara:</p>\n  \n  <p>“If milah was performed but not priah, it is as if milah was not\n  performed.”</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rishonim and Achronim, in turn, wonder if milah and priah may be\n  performed “as one”. In other words, may the mohel – either by hand or\n  with a special instrument – hold the two skins together and cut them\n  simultaneously? Many poskim are stringent in this regard, and most\n  contemporary authorities hold that, l’chatchilah, milah and priah\n  should be performed separately. However, Rav Moshe Feinstein zt”l\n  disagreed, and many mohalim rely on his opinion. (A related question\n  is whether or not the mohel may wear gloves during the milah.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Nonetheless, there are a number of instruments which definitely\n  invalidate the milah. For example, the so-called “clamp” essentially\n  kills the orlah before the cut, and hence, no blood is involved. But\n  the dambrit (the blood of the brit milah) is one of the main\n  components of the brit, and therefore, mohalim may not use this\n  instrument. Interestingly, several studies have shown that the baby\n  endures more pain with this type of instrument. In any event, when\n  such an instrument is used, the brachah is abrachah l’vatalah (“a\n  wasted brachah”).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that there are discussions as to what a <code>clamp</code> means, what kinds of <code>clamp</code> are forbidden and what is allowed. This is only the most general statement. See <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/Contemporary_Brit_Milah_Issues_2.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Contemporary Brit Milah Issues</a> for one such discussion.</p>\n\n<p>Note that even if the child has been circumcised and sufficient skin removed to make it a kosher bris (something that is not guaranteed) a drop of blood must be taken as part of the bris. Adult males or older children who convert or who had lived in circumstances where it could not be done (such as the former Soviet Union) but had been circumcised can be examples of this. If an adult must have a full bris (something that is being done more and more according to various articles) then a specially trained surgical mohel must be consulted.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jl/l/b/What_is_Circumcision.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Objective of the Ritual Circumcision</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For this reason a person who underwent a medical circumcision, without\n  intent to fulfill this commandment, should undergo a subsequent\n  procedure performed with specific intent to fulfill this mitzvah. This\n  subsequent procedure is relatively painless, involving only the\n  drawing of blood from the reproductive organ, but done in the name of\n  Brit Milah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For further details, check with a mohel. You should also note that many times a mohel will be used even for a circumcision because of his expertise and the number of procedures that he has done compared to a regular surgeon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://beautifulbris.com/methods-of-circumcision/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Methods of Circumcision</a> goes into gory detail on the medical procedures involved and the difference from a bris. It is too long to quote here but can be read at the link.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brityy.org/content.asp?dept=1017&article=466\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why a Kosher Mohel?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A Mohel performs a Brit using a Magen shield, and a Izmil (scalpel),\n  which severs the skin safely, quickly, and efficiently --- within\n  fifteen seconds, resulting in a minimum of pain. Doctors use a clamp,\n  which takes several minutes, causes unnecessary pain, and can have\n  serious health consequences. A letter from the Food and Drug\n  Administration (FDA) issued in August of 2000 states,</p>\n  \n  <p><em>“...although research suggests that circumcision is generally a safe\n  procedure, we are concerned that some device-related complications\n  have occurred. We have received 105 reports of injuries involving\n  circumcision clamps between July, 1996 and January, 2000. These have\n  included laceration, hemorrhage, penile amputation, and urethral\n  damage.”</em></p>\n  \n  <p>Note that it is precisely the clamps to which the FDA objects -- We at\n  Brit Yosef Yitzchak couldn't agree more. Not only does the clamp not\n  conform to the strictures of Jewish law, but it really isn't safe for\n  any type of circumcision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mohelnh.com/p/hatafat-dam-brit-for-conversion.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">HATAFAT DAM BRIT FOR CONVERSION</a> discusses what is done when a circumcision has been done but not a bris. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.itim.org.il/en/brit-milah-for-an-adult/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Brit Milah for an Adult</a> discusses how uncircumcised adults can get a bris in Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n",

This is often understood simply to mean \"using your name\" or \"with your name\" as in \"may you be like Abraham\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>— is the explanation of Genesis 12:3 according to its plain meaning as found in Rashi.</p>\n\n<p>But there is a point that should be emphasized. This covenant is being made to Avram, meaning Avraham before the covenant of circumcision. Like it states, all the families of the earth that bless Avram (in his efforts and mission) will be blessed by the Creator. And those that curse him will be loathed (אאר). It says that Avram together with his wife, Sarai and the 'souls which they had made there in Charan', meaning those people who had come to serve the Creator like Avram, according to the faith of Shem (meaning keeping the 7 commandments of Noach) departed for the land.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that at this point, Avram, who was a direct descendent of Shem, was being told by the Creator to leave the land of his birth (Ur and later Charan) and to go to the land that G-d would show him.</p>\n\n<p>It says that this land was occupied by the 'Canaanites' (which means traders or merchants) at this time. As Rashi explains, the land of Israel had originally been given by the Creator through Noach to his son, Shem. These foreign merchants had come to the land of Israel from their original home and subjugated its inhabitants, the descendants of Shem, and taken up residence. Avram was being told to go as a rightful heir to Shem and reclaim possession of this land for his future descendants as the Creator had originally intended.</p>\n\n<p>These occupying merchants were called 'Philistines' (from the word פלסטון which means 'fraudulent in business'. It also is associated with the idea of being 'extreme' from the root פלש as in פלשתי. Midrash describes how they initially established these trading outpost by using their women in forced prostitution. This is what initially lured the customers to come and do business.) This was connected to their worship of the 'snake goddess' called 'As-sa-sa-ra' which seems linguistically to be the source of the prohibition of worship of 'Ashera' mentioned in the Torah. They were originally called Kaftorim by the Egyptians.</p>\n\n<p>According to current archeological evidence they appear to be part of the Minoan civilization, an early Mediterranean seafaring nation that was in direct competition with the Egyptians. They practiced human sacrifice and were <a href=\"http://koryvantesstudies.org/studies-in-english-language/page215-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">reputed to be</a> <a href=\"http://koryvantesstudies.org/studies-in-english-language/page211-2/\" rel=\"nofollow\">powerful warriors</a> known for their expertise with a type of sling which was secured to their <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=UkYxAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA117&lpg=PA117&dq=Phoenician%20sling%20head&source=bl&ots=vGJVJRs-5r&sig=TzDnX4uAyE3mahCJA-tbwhGqC9c&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjOnJirw_rLAhXIkIMKHfyiBrsQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage&q=Phoenician%20sling%20head&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">heads</a>. Recent digs around the Aegean have shown evidence that they practiced cannibalism. They had trading outposts along the coastline all around the Mediterranean with their home based in the Aegean on the islands of Crete, Karpathos (as in 'Kaptorian') and Santorini. They were incredibly successful and despised by many of the other nations in the area. The Minoan civilization was destroyed by an act of G-d through the eruption of Thrace and the ensuing multiple tidal waves around 1613 BCE. The remnant of this civilization tried to make permanent settlements around the Mediterranean including the land of Israel.

Abbuha met Elijah standing in a non-Jewish cemetery. Said he\n  [Rabbah] to him [Elijah]: Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou\n  stand in a cemetery? — He replied: Has the Master not studied the laws\n  of purity? For it has been taught: R. Simeon b. Yohai said: The graves\n  of Gentiles do not defile, for it is written, And ye my flock, the\n  flock of my pastures, are men; only ye are designated 'men'. — He\n  replied: I cannot even adequately study the four [orders]; can I then\n  study six? And why? he inquired. — I am too hard-pressed, he answered.\n  He then led him into Paradise and said to him: Remove thy robe and\n  collect and take away some of these leaves. So he gathered them and\n  carried them off. As he was coming out, he heard a remark, 'Who would\n  so consume his [portion in] the world [to come] as Rabbah b. Abbuha\n  has done?' Thereupon he scattered and threw them away. Yet even so,\n  since he had carried them in his robe, it had absorbed their\n  fragrance, and so he sold it for twelve thousand denarii, which he\n  distributed among his sons-in-law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Are there other stories in Jewish literature that would support the claim that Elijah was viewed as someone who comes to help in times of need?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The origin is the last two verses of Malachi (3:23-24):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִנֵּה אָנֹכִי שֹׁלֵחַ לָכֶם אֵת אֵלִיָּה הַנָּבִיא לִפְנֵי בּוֹא יוֹם יְהוָה הַגָּדוֹל וְהַנּוֹרָא:\nוְהֵשִׁ֤יב לֵב־אָבוֹת֙ עַל־בָּנִ֔ים וְלֵ֥ב בָּנִ֖ים עַל־אֲבוֹתָ֑ם פֶּן־אָב֕וֹא וְהִכֵּיתִ֥י אֶת־הָאָ֖רֶץ חֵֽרֶם׃</p>\n<p>Behold I send you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the great and awesome day of Hashem. And he will return the hearts of fathers to their sons, and the hearts of sons to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with destruction</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <em>Netzach Yisrael</em> ch. 28, the Maharal quotes the gemara in <em>Perek Chelek</em> (<em>Sanhedrin</em> 98a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי יהושע בן לוי אשכחיה לאליהו, דהוי קאי אפתחא דמערתא דרבי שמעון בן יוחאי. אמר ליה אתינא לעלמא דאתי, אמר ליה אם ירצה האדון הזה. אמר ריב\"ל, שנים ראיתי וקול שלשה שמעתי. אמר ליה אימת אתא משיח, אמר ליה זיל שיילי לדידיה. היכי יתיב, אפתחא דמלכות רביעית. ומאי סימניה, יתיב בין עניים סובלים חלאים, וכולם אסרי ושרי בחד זימנא, איהו שרי חד ואסר חד. אמר, דלמא מבעינא ולא מעכב. אזל לגביה, אמר ליה שלום עליך רבי ומורי. אמר ליה שלום עליך בר לוואי. אמר ליה אימת אתי מר. אמר ליה היום. אתא לגבי אליהו, אמר ליה, מאי אמר לך. אמר ליה שלום עליך בר לוואי. אמר ליה אבטח לך ולאביך לעלמא דאתי. אמר ליה שקורי משקר בי, דאמר לי היום אתינא, ולא אתא. אמר ליה כי אמר לך \"היום אם בקולו תשמעו\"</p>\n<p>Rebbi Yehoshua ben Levi found Elijah standing at the entrance to Rebbi Shimon bar Yochai's cave. He said to him, \"I have come to the World to Come!\" He said to him, \"If this Master wills.\" Rebbi Yehoshua ben Levi said, \"Two have I seen, and the voice of three have I heard!\"</p>\n<p>He said to him, \"When will Moshiach come?\" He said to him, \"Go ask him himself.\" --\"Where is he?\" --\"At the entrance to the Fourth Kingdom.\" --\"What is his sign?\" --\"He is among the poor lepers; they all change all their bandages at once, but he changes one at a time.\" He said, \"Perhaps I should not wait!\"</p>\n<p>He went to him, he said to him, \"Peace unto you my teacher and master!\" He said to him, \"Peace unto you, son of Levi!\" He said to him, \"When will my master come?\" He said, \"Today!\"</p>\n<p>He went back to Elijah, he said to him, \"What did he say to you?\" He said to him, \"'Peace unto you, son of Levi!'\" He said to him, \"I guarantee you and your father the World to Come.\" He said to him, \"He lied to me! He said he would come today, and he didn't come!\" He said to him, \"'Today' - if you heed His voice...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Rashi explains: When Rebbi Yehoshua says he sees two and hears three, that the <em>Shechinah</em> was there also. When Elijah tells Rebbi Yehoshua that he and his father are guaranteed the World to Come, it is because Moshiach wished him Peace and called him by his father's name)</p>\n<p>The Maharal says that Elijah is found at Rashbi's cave due to specific properties of the location, and that Elijah is there now too.</p>\n\n\n",

Maybe the answer is that since the reason for taking it so early, four days before it was necessary, was for the Jews to show \"mesiras nefesh\" and not to be scared of the Egyptians, the torah is telling you a rule for mesiras nefesh. If one wants to be mesiras nefesh, then one has to \"pay\" for it. One has to give up something of one's own. To do mesirash nefesh with someone else's is article or for one that one has not paid for doesnt work. </p>\n\n\n",

The prohibition of owning hameitz is a separate mitzvat lo-ta'asei, as listed by the Rambam at the beginning of Hilkhot Hameitz u-Matzh, so I assume it might have different laws than <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/70115/759\">the prohibitions of eating hameitz or of deriving benefit from hameitz</a>, which is why I'm asking this as a separate question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For the first answer, I was involved in  this big Suggiah, Rambam, Ramban on Sefer Hamitsvot, and Rabanu Tam, others. It appears that explaining the halacha lead to high degree of complexity. To make a list of rules is more easy but is not a \"limudic\" approach. Rambam, Ramban in Sefer Hamitsvot and Megilat Ester on S.H. are an harmonious cascade. I am sparing the Megilat Ester here.</p>\n<h3>Rambam Lo Taase 198</h3>\n<blockquote>We are prohibited to eat products that contain mixed Chamets, despite their are not bread, Murias, Kutach, Beer, and all that ressembles them. This rule comes from the verse ( \"any 'Machmetset'\"). Let me quote here from Mechilta (Derashbi): \"Do not eat any Machmetset, this includes Kutach Habavli, Medean beer, Edomian vinegar. May be that one may be punishable by Karet , ... they are excluded from Karet because they are not fully fledged Chamets. The Gemara Pesachim 44a rules that despite the ban to eat mixture of Chamets, flagellation is only for eating a mixture with Kezait Bikde Achilat Pras, a mixture of Chamets with less that this proportion is prohibited to eat but do not lead to flagellation.\n</blockquote>\n<h3>The objection of Ramban</h3>\n<blockquote>\nHis opinion is that when the proportion of Chamets is Kezait Bikde Achilat Pras, it is banned from Torah and from this ban (198) we learn flagellation but not Karet. And when the proportion is less than Kezait Bikde Achilat Pras, no flagellation because the ban is not from Torah but a Rabbinic ban, excepting Makat Mardut (if someone is rebelling against Rabbinic rules). He wrote the same in his great book (Mishne Torah). <br><br>\nHowever, the truth on this issue is totally contrary to his words.\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Summary of the opinion of Ramban</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n A mixture with a proportion of Chamets of Kezayt Bikde Achilat Pras is equivalent to fully fledged Chamets, not mixed.</li>\n<li>\nEach ban, when the proportion is KAP, has all his properties, if flagellation, flagellation, if Karet, Karet. This Is Called Taamo Umamasho and Gemara AZ 67b states flagellation concerning bans punishables by flagellation.</li>\n<li>\nThe rule regarding mixed Chamets involves only lowest proportion. And this rule has not been selected on Halacha. It is the view of Rabbi Eliezer and we follow Rabanan</li>\n <li>\nThe verse of Machmetset for Rabanan prohibits Chamets whom chimuts was catalyzed by something not chamets. This is not an additional mitsva but a modallity and is not counted (according to shoresh 9).</li></ol>\n<h3>Regarding the prohibition of owning Chamets</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\nAccording to Rambam, mixture of KAP is prohibited as mixture, according the Halacha (we follow Rabbi Eliezer). A lowest proportion is cancelled and not considered as a mixture of chamets from a Torah point of view.</li>\n<li>\nAccording to Ramban, a mixture is not prohibited from a  Torah Point of view.\nBut when the proportion reaches KAP, this is fully fledged Chamets and is prohibited for owning and Karet for eating.\n</li>\n<li>\nConcerning the owning prohibition, the result is the same for Rambam and Ramban, but the explanation is different: a mixture with KAP is prohipited for ownning on pessach.</li></ol>\n<h3>But the practical Halacha involves different views concerning the texts of Rambam</h3>\nand my first answer tried to explain this very confusing issue.\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<h3>Halacha</h3>\n(The following is not a comprehensive halachic discussion) \n<h3>\nWe are dealing only with Chamets mixed before Pesach</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\nMin beMino (homogeneous mix), in a dry mixture (for example flour Chamets with flour Non Chamets): Cancelled by ratio of one against two; a liquid mixture too. <b>No problem of owning (Mishna Berura <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49627&st=&pgnum=27&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">442, sk 1</a>).</b>\n</li>\n<li>\nMin besheEino Mino (heterogeneous mix, the tastes are different) in a volumetric isur/heter ratio up to 1/59 (when the taste may be identified), if the Chamets mixed was initially an entire piece. According to the <i>Mishna Brura</i> there is a <b>prohibition of owning</b> (when we have a global amount of Kezait of Chamets into the mixture <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49627&st=&pgnum=27&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">op. cit.</a>).\n</li>\n<li>\nMin besheEino Mino (the tastes are differents) in a isur/heter ratio less than or equal to 1/60, even if the Chamets mixed was initially an entire piece, <b>no prohibition of owning Chamets</b>.</li>\n<li>\nIf the taste of the Chamets is <b>only exsudated from dishes</b>, according to Mishna Brura, the prohibition of owning doe's not apply.

We did not study other opinions which  addressed some mixtures as if Chamets is alone and non-mixed).<br><ol>\n<li>\nThe concept of mixture is obvious in common language. But  halachic relevance of mixture   is not easy to define.  The \"method for measuring the concentrations\" is particular. Let me give you an example. A quantity of 1 olive (the name of the unit of volume) of Chamets in  mixture, can be eaten within a unit of time called \"half loaf\". Some Rishonim would  prohibit to owning it as \"non mixed chamets\", some others prohibit too but because they think that the prohibition of owning exist also for mixed Chamets. We can see relative convergence of practices despite a divergence of theoretical view.</li>\n<li><ul>\n<li>\n We use the concept of the Eating Rate Concentration, ERC of Kazait Bikde Achilat Pras KAP,</li>\n<li>\n The fact that a prohibited component of a mixture may be detected and identified by the taste, is called Taam KeYkar TKY</li></ul></li>\n<li>\nThe link between the owning and the fact that some aliments need to be destroyed because containing Chamets should be left out.</li>\n<li>\nThe existence of rabbinical rules derived from the prohibition of owning is left out.\n</li>\n<li>\nThere is a considerable overlapping between the owning prohibition and the Mitsvat Byur, from a Torah and from a Rabbinical point of view. We do not talk about it. Poskim inquired  about the nature of taste of Chamets exudated from dishes. It seems that most poskim opinion ruled out this taste from problem of owning Chamets.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Mishna Pesachim Pessachim 3, 1</h3>‏\n‏<b>‏\nאֵלּוּ עוֹבְרִין בְּפֶסַח,‏</b>‏ כֻּתָּח הַבַּבְלִי, וְשֵׁכָר הַמָּדִי, וְחֹמֶץ הָאֲדוֹמִי, וְזֵתוֹם הַמִּצְרִי, וְזוֹמָן שֶׁל צַבָּעִים , וַעֲמִילָן שֶׁל טַבָּחִים, וְקוֹלָן שֶׁל סוֹפְרִים. רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר אוֹמֵר, אַף תַּכְשִׁיטֵי נָשִׁים. זֶה הַכְּלָל, כָּל שֶׁהוּא מִמִּין דָּגָן, הֲרֵי זֶה עוֹבֵר בְּפֶסַח. ‏<b>‏הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ בְאַזְהָרָה‏</b>, וְאֵין בָּהֶן מִשּׁוּם כָּרֵת:\n‏<br>\n(Soncino in note, translation from the perspective of Rashi): (On account of) the following [things] you <b>transgress the injunction (leaven) 'shall not be seen' and (leaven) 'shall not be found'</b> (in the house) on Passover: Babylonian Kutah, Median Beer, Idumean Vinegar, Egyptian Zithom, the Dyer's Broth, Cook's Dough, and the Scribes' Paste. <b>R' El</b>(ie)[<b>'a</b>]<b>z</b>(e)[<b>a</b>]<b>r</b> (according to Baal haMaor \"El'azar\") said: women's ornaments too.

However, for some reason, the ERC is less than KAP}\n<br>The Gemara observes that in the list we have mixtures and hardened Chamets (not intended for feeding)\n‏ מאן תנא דחמץ דגן גמור - על ידי תערובות {רש\"י: כותח הבבלי ושכר המדי}, ונוקשה {רש\"י: תכשיטי נשים} בעיניה בלאו?  ‏\nWhich Tanna [holds] that real leaven of corn in a mixture (Rashi Kutach Habavli, Shechar Hamadi), and spoiled leaven(Rashi: Cosmetic products for women) in its natural condition, is subject to a negative injunction? (I.E. Witch is the Tana of our Mishna?). In conclusion this Tanna is Rabbi Eliezer according to the Beraita ‏  על חמץ דגן גמור - ענוש כרת, על עירובו בלאו ‏ For real leaven of corn there is the penalty of kareth; for a mixture of it [one is subject to] a negative injunction.

Rambam do not follow R. Eliezer but Rabanan. So, mixed Chamets has no problem of owning. But KAP prohibited for owning.\n<h3>Magid Mishne and kesef Mishne Ramach</h3>\n(You can see a very lengthy pilpul of the Kesef Mishne chapter 1, halacha 6)\nRegarding Byur, Rambam follows Rabbi Eliezer (stam Mishna 3, 1) that mixture is on Bal Yerae only.\nBut regarding eating, he follows Rabanan (stam Mishna 3, 5 concerning Hardened  mixture), there is no negative injunction. So a mixture of 1/59 that contains an entire Kazait of small pieces of Hamets should be destroyed or annulled. Magen Avraham rules as the Magid Mishne and the Gra as the Ramach. And Mishna Brura seems to rule as the Gra.\n</blockquote>\n<hr>\nConceptually, Kazait bikde Achilat Pras design a substantial presence of the element whiich allows us to eating it with hight rate as if we eat it alone. See Gemara A.Z. 67b \"Taamo Umamasho\".[. 1- the total amount 1 kezayt, 2.- the ERC is KAP. See Rabenu Tam and Rav Chayim Cohen (in Rosh Chulin, perek 7, siman 31). See the mishna of mikpa here and Tos. Nazir and Pesachim, \n    \nOne might carefully read the mishna in tevul yom (2, 3). See also Ran in Chidushim (different from Ran al harif for this topic) A.Z. Suggia of Noten Taam lifgam about the volumetric importance of the Issur beeyn. KAP is also a way to mesure the possibility to eat the issur as if it is alone.It is as if you can keep several little particles alone without mixture. 2 steps to build the Issur. 1 .- detected presence and not bitul (TKY). 2.- proximity or concentration and accessibility between particles that makes an effect as if you eat them alone (KAP)].\n\n\n",

It says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא אמרו לו לרבי אליעזר וכי מאחר דתכשיטין הן לו מפני מה הן בטלין לימות המשיח אמר להן לפי שאינן צריכין שנאמר לא ישא גוי אל גוי חרב ותהוי לנוי בעלמא אמר אביי מידי דהוה אשרגא בטיהרא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The subject is whether arms are considered jewelry. Rabbi Eliezer says it is and the sages say it's not. The source for those who say that weapons are not jewelry is the verse which says that when Moshiach will come, the nations will beat their swords into plowshares. If swords are jewelry, why not keep them as ornamental swords? Rabbi Eliezar said that since it would be <em>like a candle in the day</em>, as in so completely useless that it looses even its ornamental status.</p>\n\n<p>There's another Gemara in Berachos (12b-13a) which says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תניא אמר להם בן זומא לחכמים וכי מזכירין יציאת מצרים לימות המשיח והלא כבר נאמר הנה ימים באים נאם ה' ולא יאמרו עוד חי ה' אשר העלה את בני ישראל מארץ מצרים כי אם חי ה' אשר העלה ואשר הביא את זרע בית ישראל מארץ צפונה ומכל הארצות אשר הדחתים שם אמרו לו לא שתעקר יציאת מצרים ממקומה אלא שתהא שעבוד מלכיות עיקר ויציאת מצרים טפל לו כיוצא בו אתה אומר לא יקרא שמך עוד יעקב כי אם ישראל יהיה שמך לא לא שיעקר יעקב ממקומו אלא ישראל עיקר ויעקב טפל לו וכן הוא אומר אל תזכרו ראשונות וקדמוניות אל תתבוננו אל תזכרו ראשונות זה שעבוד מלכיות וקדמוניות אל תתבוננו זו יציאת מצרים הנני עושה חדשה עתה תצמח תני רב יוסף זו מלחמת גוג ומגוג משל למה הדבר דומה לאדם שהיה מהלך בדרך ופגע בו זאב וניצל ממנו והיה מספר והולך מעשה זאב פגע בו ארי וניצל ממנו והיה מספר והולך מעשה ארי פגע בו נחש וניצל ממנו שכח מעשה שניהם והיה מספר והולך מעשה נחש אף כך ישראל צרות אחרונות משכחות את הראשונות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This discusses the famous Mishna (which is in the Haggadah) where Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria said that he is like a seventy year old man and couldn't find a source that one must mention the Exodus at night, but the sages (who say one doesn't) uses that verse to prove that one has to mention the Exodus when Moshiach will come.</p>\n\n<p>Ben Azzai, on the other hand, says that when Moshiach will come, the Jewish people will no longer mention the Exodus and will only mention our upcoming redemption. He says a parable that after a person escapes from wolf, he talks about this escapade, but once he is saved from a lion and a snake, he forgets all other redemptions and only focuses on the last one</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>These are apparently kabalistic ideas found in some Habad writings, e.g.,</p>\n\n<p>R Yosef Karasik writes <a href=\"http://www.beismoshiach.org/_pdf/732.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (p. 22, bottom right)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Yemos HaMoshiach, Purim will be celebrated and the other holidays\n  will be nullified because the G-dly revelation on those holidays will\n  be <strong>eclipsed by the powerful G-dly revelation of that time, just like\n  the light of a candle is negligible in broad dayligh</strong>t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.beismoshiach.org/_pdf/409.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (p. 7, bottom left) refererring to a sicha of the Lubavitcher Rebbe (Shabbos parshas Shmini, parshas Hachodesh, 5th day of Adar II, 5749)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In particular, the concept of “a candle” refers to a torch, while “a\n  light” refers to the daylight and, ultimately, to the light that will\n  be revealed in the Messianic Age when “<strong>the light of the sun will be\n  seven times the light of the seven days [of creation]</strong>.” On an even\n  higher level, it refers to the revelation of the Divine light in that\n  era when, “<strong>the sun will no longer serve you for [the purpose of]\n  daylight..., [but] G-d will be an eternal light for you.</strong>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The question of\n  what to do with chametzdik, non-kasherable dishes is discussed in the\n  gemara (Pesachim 30a). Rav rules that all chametzdik utensils must be\n  destroyed and may not be used after Pesach.[15] Shmuel disagrees and\n  maintains that they may be used after Passover. The halachah follows\n  Shmuel, and the Shulchan Aruch states (OC 451:1) that there is no need\n  to sell or otherwise dispose of one’s chametzdik utensils. They simply\n  need to be scrubbed clean of any visible chametz and locked away.\n  After Pesach they may be used. The common practice is thus not to sell\n  dishes. Such dishes, however, may not be used for food preparation on\n  Pesach—not even for cold food (Rema, OC 451:1). They may be used for\n  non-food purposes (Rema, OC 450:7) and sold to a non-Jew on Pesach\n  (Shoneh Halachot 450:12). The discussion above pertains to chametzdik\n  dishes; vessels that do not contain any absorbed chametz but are\n  merely being used to store chametz are often sold in the contract used\n  for mechirat chametz, similar to the way warehouses that store chametz\n  are sold.[16]</p>\n  \n  <p>Lest one desire to be overly stringent, selling dishes may result in\n  an additional obligation—one would have to immerse the dishes in a\n  mikvah upon repossessing them, as all metal and glass utensils\n  acquired from a non-Jew[17] require immersion.</p>\n  \n  <p>A significant dissenting opinion is the Shulchan Aruch HaRav (Rav\n  Shneur Zalman of Liadi, the first Lubavitcher Rebbe). In his\n  contract,[18] he explicitly included the sale of those utensils that\n  have actual chametz on them. The Lubavitch custom is thus to sell the\n  utensils, but because the chametzdik utensils are never actually\n  transferred to the non-Jewish buyer’s domain, they do not require\n  immersion once they are returned to the original owner.[19] The Ben\n  Ish Chai (Tzav: 9) also states that the utensils should be sold. This\n  is not the standard practice.</p>\n  \n  <p>The story is told[20] that on Motzaei Pesach 1933 the Chazon Ish had a\n  dream in which he was told to immerse all of his pots. The next\n  morning he found out that the rav through whom he had sold his chametz\n  had erroneously sold the pots.[21]</p>\n  \n  <p>[15]. This was the practice among the Beta Yisrael Jews of Ethiopia,\n  where most of the utensils were made of pottery.</p>\n  \n  <p>[16]. See Stern, 7:16, p. 54.</p>\n  \n  <p>[17]. For the many divergent opinions on this topic, see Darkei\n  Teshuvah, Yoreh Deah 120:90; the long footnote in Rabbi Zvi Cohen’s\n  Tevilat Keilim 3:3; Yabia Omer 6, YD:11 and Yechave Da’at 3:24 (where\n  Rav Ovadia Yosef asserts one should not sell utensils and rules that\n  they require immersion if sold). The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 114:2 also\n  says not to sell utensils. Utensils made of material that do not\n  require tevilah may be sold.</p>\n  \n  <p>[18]. “Hilchot Mechirat Chametz,” found at the end of Hilchot Pesach\n  (p. 234 in the 5773 ed.).</p>\n  \n  <p>[19]. See the sichah from 1976 printed in HaMaor 54:2 (380):\n  (March-April 2001): 3-5.</p>\n  \n  <p>[20]. See Rabbi Shimon Finkelman, The Chazon Ish: The Life and Ideals\n  of Rabbi Avraham Yeshayah Karelitz (New York, 1989), 57.</p>\n  \n  <p>[21]. On the Chazon Ish’s opinion that there is no need to sell\n  chametzdik utensils and that sold utensils require tevilah, see Emunah\n  U’Bitachon 3:8 and Chazon Ish, OC 117:15.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Eliyahu Kitov on Chabad.org says that if selling the dishes is required, then because of the nature of the sale (which seems that the non-Jew did not remove them from where they were stored) it is not required to tovel them. However, there are those who say that it is not required to sell them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1689/jewish/Selling-Your-Chametz.htm\">Selling Your Chametz</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Only chametz that is visible need be sold to a non Jew. As for chametz\n  like that which is absorbed in one's dishes, for example, it is\n  sufficient to wash the dishes thoroughly and put them away in a place\n  which one will not enter on Passover.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some authorities, however, maintain that this is not sufficient and\n  include dishes in the sale to the non Jew. When these dishes revert to\n  Jewish ownership after Passover, they do not require ritual immersion\n  (as is normally the case with dishes purchased from a non Jew) due to\n  the specific nature of the sale.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Zywica  says the same thing on the OU website but from the other angle and in fact, those who would require tevilah after repurchase, would forbid selling the dishes.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/articles/immersing-ourselves-in-tevilat-keilim/\">Immersing Ourselves in Tevilat Keilim</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finally, tevilah depends on the utensil’s provenance, as noted above:\n  if it was manufactured by, purchased from, given as a gift by, or\n  bought back from, a non-Jew, it requires tevilah. It is for this\n  reason that many poskim prohibit the selling of chametz utensils\n  before Passover, as they are of the opinion that the utensils would\n  require tevilah upon “re-purchase” after Passover.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The lubovitcher rebbe discussed this and made a chiddush that tevilah is only required where the non jew had access to the utensils. He also suggested that because of today's manufacturing processes this may not be fufilled and possibly today's utensils do not require tevillah hence some chabad do not make a brachah because of a safek brachah. </p>\n\n<p>Likutei sichos vol 18 parshas Mattos 2nd talk paragraph 4-5 pg 366 in the original yiddish </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Qiẓur Shulḥan 'Arukh - Yalqut Yosef (Yoreh De'ah 120:24) <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01355_part_43.html#%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%9FB%D7%A7%D7%9BB-B%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99B%D7%98%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%AAB%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%9B%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כלים של חמץ שנכללו בשטר המכירה של מכירת החמץ, ראוי להחמיר הטבילם בלי ברכה</p>\n<p>For Ḥameẓ utensils included in one's Sale of Ḥameẓ contract, it is proper to be stringent and to immerse them [once they return to one's possession] without a blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It also goes on to say that real estate is acquired only by proving abandonment and by <em>kinyan</em>.  It doesn't cite any sources.</p>\n\n<p>We don't go to the <em>mishna</em> for <em>halacha</em>, I know, and I'm missing a lot of context.  But I'm curious about the contradiction.  Per <em>halacha</em> can one acquire property through use, without <em>kinyan</em>, deed, or money?  If so, what are the general parameters (time limits, etc)?  If not, on what is the <em>halacha</em> based?</p>\n\n<p>(My gut feeling is that adverse possession isn't consistent with <em>torah</em>, but I'm seeking something more reliable than that. :-) )</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><em>Hazaka</em> only works with the original owner's consent.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam, Laws of Sales Chapter 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א,ז  [ח] כיצד בחזקה:  מכר לו בית או שדה, או נתן אותן מתנה--כיון שנעל או גדר או פרץ כל שהוא, והוא שיועיל במעשיו--הרי זה קנה.</p>\n  \n  <p>א,ח  במה דברים אמורים, בשהחזיק בפני המוכר.  אבל שלא בפני המוכר או הנותן, צריך \n  שיאמר לו לך חזק וקנה; ואחר כך אם החזיק--קנה, אף על פי שאינו בפני הבעלים.</p>\n  \n  <p>Acquisition via <em>hazaka</em> [manifesting active ownership] is done how?

(If it was actually declared ownerless (hefker), then of course it can be acquired.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I will tray to give a different response (see my 2 comments above). A first step is to talk about the topic with a minimum of technical terms.\nA deed of acquisition is generally a symbolic act, a speaking act. When mister A acquires an object Ob. from Mister B, there is a kind of scenography: from the hand of mister B to the hand of mister A, from his territory to the territory of the acquirier, maintain mastery<sup>[1]</sup>.<br>\nGenerally when mister A has some object in the hands or lives in a house, it seems that it is his object and his house.<br>\nWhen mister A says to Mister B \"I sold my house to you, take possession!\" Mister B get in and changes the locks, the gates of the courtyard, for example. This is a deed of acquisition (purchase) called Chazaka.\n<br>\nBut if mister B lives in a house 10 years up today, and one day, suddenly, mister A comes with a proof that 20 years before mister A sales contract which states that mister A acquired the house from mister C 20 years ago. <br>\nIf mister B says, \"yes it was your, but I bough it! The act of sale has been misplaced and I just cannot find it anywhere<sup>[10]</sup>\". witnesses are coming and say that mister B was here during all these years, and nobody ha objected. B is right. <br>\nBut if B says, \"I don't know, nobody said me to go out!\", the house returns to mister A. B's presence and activity are obviously not an act of acquisition (so, no adverse possession<sup>[20]</sup>). But in the first example context, as a result of a decision, it would be: If A says, \"make this and this and it will belongs to you!\".<br>\nAn additionnal case: If nobody has proof of anterior possession, nobody can contest the presence of mister B (he is more than any other the homeowner, despite he can not proof his possession).\nNor a case: If mister B discovered a new Island, he sets foot on the soil, he surrounded the Island with walls and he were the owner.<br>\nSo the word \"Chazaka' describes a kind maintain of control over an object (an effort to maintain). So the use of the word is multiple because the symbolic impact of the situation may change following according to the diverse contexts.<br></p>\n\n<p><hr>\n[1] Two example of Chazaka (kidushin 22b (Soncino)):</p>\n\n<blockquote>MISHNAH:\nA HEATHEN SLAVE IS ACQUIRED BY MONEY, DEED, OR BY HAZAKAH\n<br>GEMARA: ... Our Rabbis taught: How [is a heathen slave acquired] by hazakah?\n\nIf he unlooses his shoes for him [the purchaser], or carries his baggage after him to the baths; if he undresses, washes him, anoints, scrapes, dresses him, puts on his shoes, or lifts him, he acquires him.\n\nR`Simeon said: Let hazakah not be greater than lifting, for lifting acquires everywhere.\n\nWhat does he mean? - Said R`Ashi: [The first Tanna implies,] if he [the slave] lifts his master, he acquires him; if his master lifts him, he does not acquire him.\n\nThereupon R`Simeon observed: Hazakah should not be greater than lifting, seeing that lifting acquires everywhere. \n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Baba Batra 52b, 53a.</p>\n\n<blockquote>R`Hoshaia learned in the [Tractate] Kiddushin edited in the school of Levi:(11) If he [the buyer] does anything at all in the way of setting up a door or making a fence or an opening in his [the seller's] presence, this constitutes a title of ownership.\n\nAre we to suppose that this is only [the case if the act is done] in the seller's presence, and not otherwise? - Raba replied: The meaning is this.\n\n[If the act is done] in his presence, he has no need to say [to the buyer], Go, occupy and acquire ownership;(12)\nbut [if the act is] not [done] in his presence, he must say, Go, occupy and acquire ownership.</blockquote>\n\n<p><br>\n[10] BB 29a (Soncino) <blockquote> Raba therefore correcting himself said: For the first year a man is not particular about another man usurping his field,(6) nor is he particular for the second year, but the third year he is particular.</blockquote>\n[20] op cit. 41a<blockquote>MISHNAH:\nTHE FACT OF POSSESSION IF NOT REINFORCED BY SOME PLEA OF RIGHT DOES NOT OF ITSELF CONFER A TITLE OF OWNERSHIP.\n</blockquote></p>\n\n\n",

Can we apply it in our days and if not what was the real reason for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Looking at the source in the Torah <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.48.16?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Bereshit 48:15-16)</a> seems to indicate something else. It isn't that Yaacov Avinu is making the sons of Yosef his sons. It is that he is praying to the Creator that the 'Redeeming Angel' that looked out for Avraham, Yitzchok and himself, would also continue to look after these children of Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>Yaacov wanted the angel to include Yosef's children in that protection that had come to the rest of the family as a result of their relationship to Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov. Since Yaacov didn't make a similar prayer for the other grandchildren who already existed, it must be assumed that Yaacov didn't have a question about them receiving that angelic protection. And this seems to follow the Targum Yonatan on Genesis 48:16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יְהֵי רַעֲוָא קֳדָמָךְ דְמַלְאָכָא דְזַמִינְתָּא לִי לְמִפְרַק יָתִי\n  מִכָּל בִּישָׁא יְבָרֵךְ יַת טַלְיָיא וְיִתְקְרִי בְהוֹן שְׁמִי\n  וְשׁוּם אַבְהָתַי אַבְרָהָם וְיִצְחָק וְהֵיכְמָא דְכַוְורֵי יַמָא\n  סַגִי מִסְתְּגֵי בְמַיָא כְּדֵין בְּנוֹי דְיוֹסֵף יִתְקְפוּן לִסְגֵי\n  בְּגוֹ אַרְעָא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>An angel behaves strictly according to the orders that it was given and doesn't diverge from that mission at all.</p>\n\n<p>Taken in context, this would suggest that something about the specific status of Yosef's two sons was different from the rest of the family in Yaacov's view.</p>\n\n<p>To understand this properly would require close examination of the relationship of this particular angel to the Avot and the details of how it was commanded to interact with  Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out that when Reuven lost the bechorah, the three elements of that status were split among three other children. The kedusha aspect was given to Levi. The tribe of Levi <strong>even in Mitzraim</strong> were treated as the \"priests\" of Bnai Yisrael and did not have to serve as slaves. Yehuda was given the status of Malchus and from him would come the final dynasty of kings and the Mashiach. Yosef was given the \"double inheritance\". Thus, Efraim and Menashe were treated \"like Reuven and Shimon\" to be counted as two of the twelve tribes. Note that when Levi is treated as part of the tribes, Yosef is treated as one. When matters of inheritance, such as dividing the land, or the census in the desert are dealt with, Efraim and Menashe are treated as separate tribes and Levi is not included.</p>\n\n<p>Yosef was the bechor of Rachel and should have been the first born of Yaakov. That is also why he received \"shechem echad\" (often translated as an extra portion) over his brothers.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67204/what-is-birthright-really/67212#67212\">What is \"birthright\" really?</a> for more on this subject.</p>\n\n<p>Targum Yonatan says (about Reuven):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But because you sinned my son, the birthright is given to Yoseph, the\n  kingship to Yehudah, and the priesthood to Levi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are two complementary comments in Rashi that explain the mechanics. One in chapter 35 vs 11 and more at length in chapter 48 vs 4. </p>\n\n<p>Basically, Yaakov had a prophecy in parshas Vayishlach in which he was told he would produce another גוי and גוים. The גוי was understood to mean Binyamin once he was born. Once it was clear that he would not be having any more sons, the גוים was understood to mean one of the tribes would be split into two. </p>\n\n<p>This promise was viewed as a gift from Hashem. A gift which Yaakov subsequently re-gifted to Yosef on his deathbed. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi's words are based off the Bereishis Rabba 82 4.</p>\n\n\n",

So noodles are definitely out, as are cooked grains, which do not even necessarily require <em>bishul yisrael</em> (to be cooked by a Jew), but batter-based cakes etc. are in. Beyond that things get hard to pin down, and I have not seen any responsa on the subject. Rav Yitzchok Berkovits says they showed Rav Shlomo Zalman Cheerios, and he said, \"אה, קליינע בייגעלאך\" - literally, \"Small baigels!\" but in Israeli parlance, \"Small pretzels!\" He held that Cheerios have the appearance of bread and would therefore not be pas yisrael. Similarly, I believe I saw a chart from the Star-K which said that if one eats Cheerios to satiety one would be Biblically obligated to say birkat hamazon. However, the Lakewood minhag seems to be to treat Cheerios as a noodle and not require them to be pas yisrael, though I have seen no source for this. I asked Rav Gedaliah Anemer if bran flakes had <em>toar lechem</em> and would therefore be forbidden to eat during the 10 Days of Repentence (OC 603:1) and he replied he didn't think so.</p>\n\n<p>The concept of <em>toar lechem</em>, \"the appearance of bread,\" comes from OC 168:10, where the Shulchan Aruch approximately says that if you crumble your matzah, wet it and make it into a matzah ball, it loses its \"hamotzi\" and becomes a \"mezonot\". Rav Alexander Mandelbaum in <em>V'Zot haBracha</em> mentions the the gemara says grains which are <em>ma'aseh kedeira</em> (\"cooked in a pot\") are always mezonot, not hamotzi (Brachot 37a). He quotes several authorities who thought noodles did have <em>toar lechem</em>, but Rav Akiva Eiger rejects them and infers that the Rambam agrees with him: even though they are made from dough, since they are not baked, they are not bread-like, and so is the conclusion of the Mishna Brura.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Mandelbaum quotes Rav Mordechai Eliyahu that pancakes and melawach have <em>toar lechem</em>. He says breakfast cereals consisting of various baked shapes of some thickness - he mentions Grape Nuts and several Israeli brands - have <em>toar lechem</em> according to Rav Shlomo Zalman and Rav Elyashiv, however Rav Scheinberg disagreed. Rav Shlomo Zalman agreed that bran flakes do not have <em>toar lechem</em>, but Rav Elyashiv held they did.</p>\n\n<p>I do not know of any source that links YD 112 to OC 168; I think it's taken as self-evident, given that YD 113:1 states that any food which is not eaten raw and which is \"suitable for a king's table\" is forbidden if cooked by a non-Jew.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Guidelines for the definition of bread for the purposes of this halakha can be found at <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Pas_akum#What_Breads_and_Foods_are_Included\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia, here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Any <strong>baked</strong> food item made <strong>primarily</strong> from any one or more of the five grains.

He notes that Prof. Saul Lieberman, R. Menachem Mendel Kasher, and others considered the work to be authentic, however, he considers it to clearly be a forgery. His proofs are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>in this work, the \"Rambam\" identifies God with His name, a doctrine which does not match the Rambam's position but instead those of the early kabbalists.</li>\n<li>This work refers to the appearance of <em>ruach ha-kodesh</em> in <em>beit midrasho shel Ever</em>, which would be a foreign concept for the Rambam for whom <em>ruach ha-kodesh</em> appears only to individuals, not institutions. [This seems to be a weak proof, as this may be a mere figure of speech.]</li>\n<li>This work refers to the midrash which says that \"a maidservant saw at the splittings of the sea what Ezekiel did not see,\" a statement which the Rambam himself never quotes, as it seems to go against his philosophy. [Skipping a few proofs.]</li>\n<li>Until this work was published by Moses Gaster in 1923, no one ever heard of it--including R. Avraham ben ha-Rambam who never mentions it in his commentary on the Torah or anywhere else, even where he had opportunities to do so.</li>\n<li>The language does not match the Rambam's Hebrew writings.

(Indeed it's quite reasonable that two bites need to be somewhat near each other in order to combine.) How long is too long?

On the other hand, those people whose wickedness is concealed represent a much greater threat. One of the purposes of tzara'as is to separate the gossipmonger from society to protect them from his negative influence. However, if somebody's entire body is covered with tzara'as, it will be plain to all that he is to be avoided, and there is therefore no need to rule him impure and distance him from others. Alternatively, Rav Reuven Zelig Bengis explains that the purpose of tzara'as is to tell a person that he has sinned and to motivate him to approach the Kohen who will teach him how to examine and correct his ways. If he doesn't do so and the tzara'as continues to spread, this proves to him that he still has work to do. If, however, the tzara'as has already spread and covered his entire body before he even approaches the Kohen, he will become despondent if he is ruled impure, thereby defeating the purpose.

Since we know that Hashem punishes measure for measure, how is Tzara’as an appropriate punishment for Lashon Hara? He explains that when one speaks Lashon Hara, he takes one tiny aspect of a person, one incident which he witnessed, and he pulls it out of context, blows it out of proportion, and ultimately defines the entire person based on that one incident. Therefore he’s punished with Tzara’as, a tiny blotch on his skin which defines him as a Metzora. Accordingly, if his entire skin was covered with what appears to be Tzara’as, it defeats its own purpose and therefore cannot possibly be Tzara’as. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A question on the Mishna, Negaim 11:7\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Negaim.11.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Negaim 11:5</a>, the mishna lists one of the preconditions for burning a garment: if its green or red discolouration hasn't changed for two weeks. Two mishnayot later, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Negaim.11.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">11:7</a>, Rabbi Eliezer is asked why a garment that doesn't have room for the discolouration to spread would still need monitoring, and he doesn't know the answer. Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteyra tells him that it is because the discolouration might remain for two weeks, in which case the garment would need to be burnt, and Rabbi Eliezer praises him for being a great scholar (חכם גדול אתה).</p>\n<p>What is so impressive about Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteyra's answer? Did Rabbi Eliezer not know the law recorded in Negaim 11:5?? I find that rather unlikely, since it's also recorded in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Leviticus.13.55?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leviticus 13:55</a>. Seeing as it <em>is</em> recorded there (and therefore not a particularly profound observation), why did Rabbi Eliezer not say it himself, and why was he so impressed when Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteyra did?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Not sure but it seems that after Mishna 5 you can believe that the Hesger, the first hesger, is practicable only if there is a surface size enough for potential spreading. In the verse also.we can get a such understanding. The Chiddush ( novelty) is that we have a reason to make first Hesger, <strong>even if the only possibility which can lead the cloth to uncleanness is an eventual  second Hesger</strong> ( and not an enlargement of the leper) and after this second Hesger ... the remaining of the leper in the same state makes the uncleanness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְ֠הִנֵּ֠ה לֹֽא-הָפַ֨ךְ הַנֶּ֤גַע אֶת-עֵינוֹ֙ וְהַנֶּ֣גַע לֹֽא-פָשָׂ֔ה טָמֵ֣א ה֔וּא ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda Ben Betera provided this semantic novelty in the verse.</p>\n<h3>Summary:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>There is an Hava-Amina (a step in which we were possibly thinking) to reject  the possibility of Hesger Rishon\nbecause of the lack of potential spreading.</li>\n<li>The conclusion is the profound insight of Rabbi Yehuda in the lecture taught by the wises for the reason of making a first Hesger, even if the only way to reach Tum'a is the second Hesger.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I hope that this makes sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think the P'Shat here is that R' Yehuda ben Beseira is being praised for strengthening and substantiating the words of the Chachomim, not for the wisdom of the actual reason.  There is a similar exchange between these Tannaim in 9:3 and there, the Tosfos Yom Tov explains the praise Chachom Gadol. \"You are a Chachom Gadol because you supported the words of the Sages by giving a reason for them and that is better than contradicting them.\"  He also quotes the Korban Aharon that this praise was earned because he did not confuse the question and contradict their teachers.</p>\n\n\n",

The whole point of that tractate is to share wisdom that was given by God to Moses etc. The source is that the rabbi learned it from his rabbi etc.</p>\n\n<p>Except for the Archangels and the AOD who appear regularly in Jewish folklore and theology, a typical angel only has one purpose and ceases to exist. These Mitzva generated angels serve as a visualizable representation of an action that accumulate so when the person dies one can visualize a crowd of accusers one one side and a crowd of character witnesses on the other. A mitva generated angel's soul purpose is to testify that that mitzva was done.</p>\n\n<p>One may believe that God actually has a spiritual courtroom in the clouds that works in this manner or just view R' Eliezer's metaphor as a good way to visualize the weighing of actions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't believe that the aforementioned text refers to actual \"angels\", but metaphorical meaning behind this description.

You can read it here it is a very beautiful piece from igeres hakodesh letter 25\nוהוא בהקדים מאמר רז״ל: כל הכועס, כאילו עובד עבודת כוכבים ומזלות</p>\n\n<p>And this [will be understood] by first considering the teaching of our Sages, of blessed memory:7 “Whoever is in a rage resembles an idolater.\nוהטעם מובן ליודעי בינה</p>\n\n<p>The reason [for this] is clear to those who8 “know un-derstanding,”</p>\n\n<p>לפי שבעת כעסו, נסתלקה ממנו האמונה</p>\n\n<p>because at the time of his anger, faith in G‑d and in His individual Divine Providence has left him.</p>\n\n<p>כי אילו היה מאמין שמאת ה׳ היתה זאת לו, לא היה בכעס כלל</p>\n\n<p>For were he to believe that what happened to him was G‑d’s doing, he would not be angry at all.</p>\n\n<p>ואף שבן אדם, שהוא בעל בחירה, מקללו או מכהו או מזיק ממונו</p>\n\n<p>True, it is a person possessed of free choice that is cursing him, or striking him, or causing damage to his property,</p>\n\n<p>ומתחייב בדיני אדם ובדיני שמים על רוע בחירתו</p>\n\n<p>and [therefore] guilty according to the laws of man and the laws of heaven for his evil choice.</p>\n\n<p>The perpetrator for his part cannot plead innocence on the grounds that he is merely an instrument in the hands of Divine Providence.</p>\n\n<p>אף על פי כן, על הניזק כבר נגזר מן השמים</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, as regards the person harmed, this [incident] was already decreed in heaven,</p>\n\n<p>והרבה שלוחים למקום</p>\n\n<p>and9 “G‑d has many agents” through whom He can act.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, even if the offending party had chosen otherwise, the incident would have befallen the victim in any case.</p>\n\n<p>This discussion recalls the teaching of the Mechilta cited by Rashi on the verse,10 והאלקים אנה לידו — “and G‑d caused it to happen to him.” For to such a case the Mechilta applies the verse,11 “From evildoers there emerges evil.” This means that though it was decreed from above that someone should sustain an injury, G‑d brings it about that a particular person should inflict it.</p>\n\n<p>That context, however, speaks of an unwitting injury. In the case of a potentially willful offender, if instead of choosing freely to act in an evil manner he chose to do otherwise, the event would still have occurred, for “G‑d has many agents,” as quoted above.</p>\n\n<p>At any rate, it is thus clear that the victim has no cause to be angry with the offender, for the true cause of the offense was not him, but a heavenly decree.</p>\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe now takes this one step further: Not only does the heavenly decree give the offender an undefined potential to do harm, but moreover, the particular thought to do it and the power to do it, all come about from G‑d. (At the same time, since man has freedom of choice, he can of course choose to reject such a thought and refrain from doing such a deed.)</p>\n\n<p>Anger thus remains unjustifiable. For the offended party is not angry that the other party made an evil choice; what angers him is the damage done to him. His anger thus results from his lack of belief that the true cause for his mishap is not a particular individual’s evil choice, but a heavenly decree.</p>\n\n<p>ולא עוד</p>\n\n<p>And not only this, that a heavenly decree gave permission in principle and made it possible that he suffer injury,</p>\n\n<p>אלא אפילו בשעה זו ממש, שמכהו או מקללו</p>\n\n<p>but even at that very moment at which [the offender] strikes or curses him,</p>\n\n<p>מתלבש בו כח ה׳ ורוח פיו יתברך, המחייהו ומקיימו</p>\n\n<p>there is vested in him (in the offender) a force from G‑d and the breath of His mouth, which animates and sustains him;</p>\n\n<p>וכמו שכתוב: כי ה׳ אמר לו, קלל</p>\n\n<p>as it is written:12 “For G‑d told him, ‘Curse!’”</p>\n\n<p>והיכן אמר לשמעי</p>\n\n<p>Now where did He say so to Shimi? Where do we find it written that G‑d told him to curse David?</p>\n\n<p>אלא שמחשבה זו, שנפלה לשמעי בלבו ומוחו, ירדה מאת ה׳</p>\n\n<p>But this thought that occurred in Shimi’s heart and mind to curse David, descended from G‑d, Who was thus responsible for such a thought entering Shimi’s mind;</p>\n\n<p>ורוח פיו, המחיה כל צבאם</p>\n\n<p>and13 “the breath of His mouth, [which animates] all the hosts [of heaven],”</p>\n\n<p>החיה רוחו של שמעי, בשעה שדיבר דברים אלו לדוד</p>\n\n<p>animated the spirit of Shimi at the time he spoke those words to David.</p>\n\n<p>כי אילו נסתלק רוח פיו יתברך רגע אחד מרוחו של שמעי, לא יכול לדבר מאומה</p>\n\n<p>For if the breath of G‑d’s mouth had departed from the spirit of Shimi for a single moment, he could not have spoken at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The notion that hashgachah peratis (personalized Divine Providence) is so inclusive for this question to even exist dates back to the 18th century or so. The Lubavitcher Rebbe calls it a chidush (novellum) of the Baal Shem Tov (the founder of Chassidus) <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/faxes/protis.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.aishdas.org/avodah/faxes/protis.pdf</a> . According to R Chaim Friedlander (Sifsei Chaim, Pirqei Emunah veHashgachah vol I, ma'amar 4) the innovation was the Vilna Gaon's, although based on hints from  Rav\nYonasan Eybeshitz and the Radal. (Notice that both the Lubavitcher Rebbe and Rabbi Friedlander are ascribing the idea to the founder of their own camp.)</p>\n<p>I don't understand either claim, since we find the idea slightly earlier, in the Ramchal (Derekh Hashem 2:1:2. tr. R' Yaakov Feldman, emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואולם כבר הקדמנו בחלק א' פרק ה', שתחילת הנבראים כולם הם הכוחות הנבדלים, ומהם משתלשלים הגשמים. והדברים בגשמים בכל פרטיהם, הנה הם כפי מה שנעתק אליהם מן הכוחות ההם בפרטי בחינותם, ואין דבר קטון או גדול בגשמיים שלא יהיה לו סיבה ושורש בכוחות הנבדלים כפי בחינותיהם. והאדון, ברוך הוא, הנה הוא משגיח על כל אלה העניינים כפי מה שבראם, דהיינו על הכוחות הנבדלים בראשונה, ועל כל השתלשלותם כפי מה שהוא באמת. וכן הוא משגיח גם כן על הפקידים שהפקיד על הנמצאות, כמו שביארתי שם, לקיים אותם ואת פקודתם ולהתמיד להם הכוח שיפעלו פעולתם:</p>\n<p>Now, as we’d already said the creation of the material world began with the Transcendent Forces, out of which emitted all physical things and their specific qualities. For there is nothing in the material world — either major of minor — that isn’t somehow rooted in some element of those Forces.</p>\n<p>That being in place, <strong>G-d Himself then oversees each thing along the lines He created them</strong>, in that He first oversees the Transcendent Forces and everything that results from them, then He oversees the angels and sees to it that they carry out their duties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the brothers were planning to\nkill Yosef, but Reuven wanted\nto divert their plot, suggesting\nthey instead throw him into a\npit. “And Reuven heard and he saved\nhim from their hands (vayatzileihu\nmiyadam); and he said, let us not\nstrike a soul.” (Bereishis 37:21)</p>\n<p>The Or haChaim haQadosh (ad loc) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a person possesses\nfree will and desire and\ncan kill someone who\ndoesn't deserve death.\nUnlike evil beasts, which\ndon't touch a person if he isn't deserving\nof death according to\nHeaven. That is what it says “vayatzileihu\nmiyadam”, meaning, from\nthe yad of their bechirah (free will).\nThey said something in contradiction\nto this, “and we will see what will be\nwith his dreams etc.…” for the\nbechirah will nullify the thing, and\nthere would be no proof from his\ndeath that the thing was false.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the answer has two parts: before the introduction of the idea of universal personalized Divine Precedence, and after.</p>\n<p>Had the brothers killed Yosef\ndirectly, they might have caused a\nwrongful death. By placing him in a\npit and making the effects of their\nbechirah uncertain, they put his fate\nin G-d’s “hands” so that Yosef would\nonly die if he deserved it.</p>\n<p>The Or haChaim simply answers your question by saying that G-d will step aside and not necessarily overrule human free will to tailor the outcome in the victim's life.</p>\n<p>This notion is consistent with a\nverse we say every weekday in Tachanun.\n“David said to Gad, ‘It pains\nme greatly. Let us please fall to the\n‘hands’ of G-d, for His mercy is great,\nand let me not fall into man’s\nhands.” (Divrei Hayamim I 21:13 )</p>\n<p>David was forced to choose\nthe means of national punishment.\nMan can act in ways that defy\nHashem’s mercy so the punishment’s\noutcome could be more severe than\nthat of hashgachah.</p>\n<p>There are a number of issues that\ncan potentially conflict with hashgachah.\nRav Yehudah Halevi lists\nfour types of causes: Divine, natural,\nhappenstance, and our topic – human. (Kuzari 5:20) Everything has a Divine cause,\nfor if you look at the\ncause of an event, and\nits cause, and so on,\nyou eventually reach\nHashem. The Kuzari asserts that every\nevent is caused by G-d. But due to\nthese intermediate causes, not every\nevent occurs in order to further\nHashem’s plan for the affected\npeople’s lives. Even though Hashem\ncauses the event, we would not say its\noccurring or not occurring is something\nHe kept in His “hands”. The\nKuzari’s position is consistent with\nthe Or Hachaim’s.</p>\n<p>This isn’t the\ndefinition most of us\nassume when we hear the word hashgachah.</p>\n<p>Rashi, on the other hand, believes\nthat even in cases where one person is a victim of another (or himself -- eg suicide), the victim is\nfeeling the effects of hashgachah.\nDescribing the law of ma’akeh, the\nduty to put a railing on your roof, the\nTorah says, “When you build a new\nhome, make a ma’keh on your roof;\ndon’t place blood in your home when\nthe faller falls from it.” (Devarim 22:8)</p>\n<p>Rashi is bothered by the\nredundancy in calling the\nvictim a nofeil, a faller. He\nexplains that this is because\n“he deserved to fall.”</p>\n<p>This is more along the lines of what I called the 2nd part of my question -- Free Will vs. the modern notion of universal Providence.</p>\n<p>I think of it in terms of \"a perfect storm\". It isn't that any event is simply A causes B which causes C ... and so XYZ happened to a person. Causality isn't a line, it's a net. And a person choosing to be one factor in that \"perfect storm\" or not doesn't change the general convergence of causes that lead to someone else's tragedy -- or boon. Hashem makes the general flow of causality such that if it doesn't happen this way, because the person chose otherwise, it would happen in some other.</p>\n<p>Also, Rashi makes a point of divorcing\nthis philosophical question from that\nof morality. The idea that every\nvictim is supposed to be a victim by\nDivine plan does not pardon the one\nwho acts against the victim. He\ncontinues, “However, despite this, you\nshould not be the one to cause his\ndeath; for good things are brought\nabout by the agency of the innocent,\nand bad things are brought about by\nthe guilty.” (Ibid. See also Rashi on Shemos 12:13, discussing the guilt of someone who kills through negligence.)</p>\n<p>According to Rashi, even if the\nbrothers had tried to kill Yosef directly,\ntheir success would depend on\nwhether Yosef deserved death. Rashi\nwould see no difference in the outcome\nbetween the brothers’ original\nplan to kill Yosef directly and\nReuven’s plan that it be indirect.\nTherefore Rashi could not take the Or\nHachaim’s understanding that this\nalone was how he intended to save\nYosef, and that Reuven returned later\nto help the saved Yosef. Rather, Rashi\nhad to conclude that Reuven here was\nreferring to an unstated plan to return\nlater to save him.</p>\n<p>The Chinuch (#421) explains the prohibition against taking revenge in these terms. What one experiences\nfrom another’s actions only serve Hashem’s\nplans. The mitzvah stems\nfrom the bitachon (trust in G-d) that\nin a deeper sense the other person did\nyou no real disservice. Even the Kuzari (5:20, conclusion),\nwho does not assume that\neverything we experience is necessarily\ndirectly part of Hashem’s plan\nfor us, writes that since we cannot\nknow what has a Divine cause, bitachon\nis the appropriate and most\nproductive assumption to make in\nresponding to any event.</p>\n\n\n",

At least two reasons are quoted for this\n  prohibition. Some sources include it under what the Navi Yeshaya\n  (58:13) commanded when he declared, Vechibadto mei’asos derachecha,\n  mimetzo cheftzecha vedabeir davar, \"You shall honor the Shabbos by not\n  performing your own matters, seeking out your own needs and speaking\n  of them\" (Vayikra Rabbah 34:16; Rashba, Shabbos 113a). This\n  proscription is usually simply called dabeir davar.</p>\n  \n  <p>Others prohibit praying for personal requests on Shabbos because it\n  violates one’s oneg Shabbos. Praying for personal needs causes one to\n  focus on what troubles him, which leads a person to be sorrowful (see\n  Rambam, Hilchos Shabbos 30:12 and Ran, Shabbos, Rif page 5b). Shabbos\n  is to be a day of joy.</p>\n  \n  <p>[R Kaganoff then goes into a long discussion why the traditional\n  nusach contains personal requests, see <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?cat=425&id=24017&q=\" rel=\"nofollow\">original</a> for details]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Mishnah Berurah (288:22) permits praying on Shabbos for spiritual\n  help or for any other request that is not a result of difficult\n  circumstances.</strong> It seems that this should be permitted for two reasons:\n  (1) one should not pray on Shabbos about one’s own needs, but\n  spiritual needs are Hashem’s realm and (2) most people do not become\n  saddened regarding their spiritual failings and \"troubles.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Moishe Dovid Lebovits writes similarly <a href=\"http://www.thehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/Vol3Issue2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> (see there for sources)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Chazal forbade one to ask for his personal needs on Shabbos.</strong> Some say\n  this is learned from the din that on Shabbos one has to act\n  differently from the rest of the week. Others say the reason is\n  because it is not an oneg for Shabbos if one asks for his personal\n  needs. The Ran says the reason is because asking for personal needs on\n  Shabbos may cause a person to cry on Shabbos which is not allowed. The\n  Korbon Eida says the reason is because of tirdas halev.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many poskim say the whole issur is to ask regarding a tzara one\n  already has, and one is permitted to request from Hashem that a\n  certain tzara should not come. Some say  something which has a set\n  nusach can be said on Shabbos even if it contains personal requests.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Although some poskim prohibit asking for personal ruchniyus needs on\n  Shabbos,  many poskim say it is permitted to do so.

He writes that he originally used to tell people that when Rosh Hashana falls out on Shabbos that they should not verbally express their personal requests, but subsequently retracted. His retraction was because he concluded from the practice that women are allowed (and encouraged) to make requests after lighting the Shabbos candles, that there is an exception made for personal requests on Shabbos when it is a specific auspicious time which one would otherwise miss.</p>\n\n<p>The same would apply to personal requests by the opening of the Ark for the 3 <em>sifrei Torah</em> - since it is an auspicious time which one would otherwise miss, it is permitted in spite of the general prohibition of making personal requests on Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

But we consider (following R.Shim'on) that the degradation of the taste is minor after a short period (less than 24h)  ‏\nור' שמעון מה טעם?\nדתניא: לא תאכלו כל נבלה לגר אשר בשעריך - כל הראויה לגר - קרויה נבלה, ושאינה ראויה לגר - אינה קרויה נבלה.\n\nור' מאיר, ההוא למעוטי סרוחה מעיקרא.\nור' שמעון, סרוחה מעיקרא לא צריך קרא, עפרא בעלמא הוא.\n\n    הלוקח כלי תשמיש מן הנכרים, את שדרכו להטביל - יטביל, להגעיל - יגעיל, ללבן באוּר - ילבן.\n\nהשפוד והאסכלא מלבנן באור,\nהסכין שפה והיא טהורה. \n‏\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I shall leave the details of this Topic (Tosfot AZ 67b, Raah in Bedek Habayt, Ran in Chidushin and Rif).<br>\nMeat and milk also leave taste after cooking into the pan. When Milk enter into fleishig pan, he gives Taam Rishon, (See ramban Chulin 111b) and the tastes of meat and of milk are both prohibited (Bassar Bechalav)\n<br>The Ban of Bassar Bechalav occurs through cooking. One of the verses is Exodus 23, 19</p>\n\n<blockquote>\nלֹא-תְבַשֵּׁל גְּדִי, בַּחֲלֵב אִמּוֹ\n<br>\nThou shalt not seethe a kid in its mother's milk\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The encounter between this 2 tastes may prohibit them.</p>\n\n<p><br> Common questions: 1- we do not get any taste. 2- our dishes do not absorb. 3- detergents destroy the tastes. <br>\nAnswer: not absolutely. There are professional tasters. Anyway for each question consult a rabbi because of the great multi-factoriality of the topic</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mayim shelanu history?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The water used to bake Matzah must be mayim shelanu—water that had been drawn in the evening and left to cool overnight. What is the halachic background for this requirement?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This halacha is brought down in the Shulchan Aruch 455 where the Mishna Beura explains what it is according to Rashi. Where Rashi explains that in Nissan spring water is hot as the sun heats up the springs (as the location of the sun in that time is close to the earth's ground). There is also another opinion who understands differently to Rashi, how the sun heats the springs up. With regards to making Matzah one is not allowed to use hot water as it will be easy to make it chametzdik. Therefore the Rabbis said one must leave this hot water in a vessel overnight to cool it down.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The purpose of this post is to argue for the reason of the requirement of <em>maim shalanu</em>. Since most people here have never brought a bucket of water from a well or from a spring, and are unfamiliar with chemistry of water which is important, when understanding reaction of <em>chamitza</em>, I will sketch the issues and provide a more detailed comment with references afterwards.</p>\n<p>At issue here is purity of water, which is a very serious requirement in ability not to start the <em>chamitza</em> earlier and of general <em>taharah</em> on Pesach. Spring water is \"living water\" due to very thorough purification. However, spring water or well water usually contains some small particles, which need to be physically removed. These particles are invisible to the eye, however they get noticeable after 12 hours as they fall to the bottom of the bucket. Usual filtering process may do the particle removal (1), however, the chemical ability of water to \"preserve memory\" of the removed particles does not allow using it right away (2). The simplest solution to separate the particles is to let the bucket stay overnight covered. If there was any foreign mixture in the water of either dust, or sediment, or ions, or molecules, it usually sinks to the bottom overnight. The chemical structure of spring water (3) allows keeping the memory of them for some time and chemically act as if the foreign mixture is still in the water (4). Nevertheless, when water stands overnight, after the particles sink, water molecules reorganize to erase the memory of the mixture that was present. That's what it means that water \"cools down\", i.e. it no longer has any particles nor their memory to start the <em>chamitza</em> reaction early.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_water_filters\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">history of water purification</a> while going to ancient times, only in relatively recent times has allowed to solve the problem with high degree of purity.</p>\n<p>(2) This is also how most of homeopathic remedies work: by diluting the chemical to a very low ratio in spring water, one can preserve its potency and avoid its side effects.</p>\n<p>(3) Why does water hold memory of the mixture? The water molecule contains two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. The oxygen grabs electrons from the hydrogen atoms to complete its external electron level, which turns the molecule into a dipole, i.e. one side has a positive charge and another side has a negative charge:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3E19odlD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3E19odlD.png\" alt=\"water dipole structure\" /></a></p>\n<p>This way, molecules of pure water get organized into regular clusters or \"<a href=\"https://www.the-scientist.com/structured-water-is-changing-models-49389\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Structured Water</a>\" and it behaves like a crystallic liquid, as the clusters form and break to join other clusters. For example, in clouds water particles turn into \"living water\" as they get purified to such a degree that they forms regular hexagonal snowflakes. Liquid living water is similar, as it keeps crystalline hexagonal structures.</p>\n<p>(4) The crystalline properties of water have effect on the outcome of chemical reactions as shown  by chemists <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3773%2820010518%2940%3A10%3C1808%3A%3AAID-ANIE1808%3E3.0.CO%3B2-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralf Ludwig</a>, <a href=\"https://water.lsbu.ac.uk/water/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Martin Chaplin</a>, and others relatively recently. Their experiments also show how these properties change if water has presence of mixture or its memory.</p>\n\n\n",

Tefillin are apparently a very important Mitzvah, hence God's decision to repeat the command multiple times.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's an excellent question @Yamin. Fulfilling the mitzvah of tefillin is actually equated with fulfilling all the miztvot of the Torah like is found in <a href=\"http://dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=kiddushin&daf=35a\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kiddushin 35a</a> in the name of Rav Acha bar Yaacov. This is also taught in <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=SpQ9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PT326&lpg=PT326&dq=%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%AA&source=bl&ots=pO_1OJCGDe&sig=mg652pZs_cmh-pFGVQyNs96S1eE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH6fS3jInMAhUEQiYKHbzSBh8Q6AEIRjAG#v=onepage&q=%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%AA&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer Reishit Chochma</a> by Rabbi Eliyahu DeVidas and  <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01355_part_3.html#HtmpReportNum0000_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</a>, Siman 25:1.</p>\n\n<p>It is significant to emphasize that the citation from Kiddushin does not use the term 'shikool', which means of equal value but not actually the same thing. Rather it uses the uses the expression 'hookshah', which has a meaning of actually being one, like two hands being struck together as one.</p>\n\n<p>To explain this in more detail requires citing the explanations of numerous Siddurim, like the Siddur of the Ramchal, the Siddur Kol Yaacov, the Siddur of the Ari and others concerning the intentions, the 'kavannot', of the prayers.</p>\n\n<p>When one lays tefillin, it begins with the 'tefillin shel yad'. This is because we are reminded that the action, performing the mitzvot through action is the primary aspect as opposed to just contemplation. (המעשה הוא העיקר)</p>\n\n<p>When one puts on tefillin, part of that process is to gaze at the two 'Shins' on the 'tefillin shel rosh'. While gazing, it is noted that one of the 'Shins' has three heads and one has four heads. Three plus four equals seven. And the two 'Shins' together spell the word 'six' (שש). Seven plus six equals thirteen. But the letter 'Shin' also has a numerical value (\ngematria) of three hundred. And so the two 'Shins' also convey a meaning of six hundred. The total so far is six hundred and thirteen (613). This equates with the 613 mitzvot of the Jewish people. (תרי״ג מצות בני ישראל)</p>\n\n<p>But it doesn't stop there. 'All the mitzvot of the Torah' also includes the 7 mitzvot of the children of Noach (שבע מצות בני נח) which parallel the 7 Rabbinic mitzvot (שבע מצות דרבנן). These are brought to mind through the 'batim', the houses of the tefillin. The 'tefillin shel yad' has a single bayit (1). And the 'tefillin shel rosh' has four batim (4). Unlike the mitzvah of tzitzit (the blue and white fringes) which are considered a single mitzvah, the 'tefillin shel yad' and the 'tefillin shel rosh' are considered two separate mitzvot (2). This reminds us of the additional 7 mitzvot (1 plus 4 plus 2).</p>\n\n<p>And the inclusion of the two categories together (613 and 7) gives a total of 620 (כתר, crown 'of G-d's Kingship') which alludes to the revelation of G-d's kingship over the entire universe. (מלך העולם)</p>\n\n<p>This is also the idea that 'G-d is one and His name is one.' And this is recalled while reflecting on this unity because placed within the 'batim' of both the 'shel yad' and the 'shel rosh' are the same four parshiyot. In the 'shel yad' they appear on a single klaf and in the 'shel rosh' they are on separate klafim. And this is where the eight (8) is found in the tefillin, meaning in the total number of parshiyot. The one 'bayit' of the 'shel yad' (1, א), the eight parshiyot from both the 'shel yad' and the 'shel rosh' (8, ח) and the four 'batim' of the 'shel rosh' (4, ד). Together, this is 'One' (אחד). Hear Israel, the L-rd, your G-d, the L-rd is one.</p>\n\n\n",

Eating only shmura matzah is a chumra (stringency) to be absolutely sure the flour is not chometz. Not eating gebrokts is a minhag (custom), mainly adopted by - although not exclusively - chassidic Jews. I think hotel etc. marketing is primarily responsible for convincing everyone that it is a chumra - since many places proudly proclaim that they have no gebrokts as if it is the highest level of kashrus, when it is actually a minhag. Therefore, there are many very stringent Jews who happily eat gebrokts, although they may be extremely stringent about what matza is used to make those gebrokts.</p>\n\n<p>Although many who avoids gebrokts on the first seven days eat it on the last day, there are those who avoid it even on the eighth day. Mainly, they are concerned about having it on their Pesach keilim (utensils) even though nearly a year will pass before the next Pesach.

Once someone determines that they are following a particular level of shimur, then they can determine if they will or will not eat \"gebrochts\" because of the possibility that some flour was not cooked enough and can become chametz.</p>\n\n<p>These are two different problems and are treated completely independently.</p>\n\n<p>The three levels of shimur are</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ok.org/consumers/passover/this-matzah-that-we-eat/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>WHEN DOES SHIMUR START?</strong></a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are three opinions discussed in Halacha as to the level of\n  guarding that is required. The most lenient opinion states that this\n  requirement is satisfied as long as care is exercised from the time\n  the flour is mixed with water to ensure that the matzah is baked\n  before it can become chometz (Shmurah mi’Sh’as Lisha). This approach\n  is based on the assumption that flour is generally stored away from\n  water, and chometz concerns only begin at the point of kneading the\n  dough, where water is added to the flour. This opinion, however,\n  should only be followed in cases of extreme necessity, and none of the\n  matzah sold today follows this approach. [Indeed, most wheat today is\n  soaked (tempered) in water before milling, which raises the concern\n  that it may be true chometz].</p>\n  \n  <p>The second opinion holds that the grain must be guarded from the time\n  it is milled into flour. This approach is based on the assumption that\n  whole grains are not susceptible to becoming chometz even if they were\n  to become wet, since the hard, unbroken kernels are normally resistant\n  to water. Once milled, however, the grains lose this protected status,\n  especially where flour mills were powered by running water and the\n  flour was thus exposed to moisture. Such flour is called Shmurah\n  mi’Sh’as Techina. The grain is inspected before milling to ensure that\n  it has not begun to sprout or exhibit other signs of chimutz, and by\n  doing so we are assured that even if the whole grain had become wet it\n  had nevertheless not become chometz. Most machinemade matzah uses such\n  flour, and such matzah is commonly referred to as matzah\n  p’shutah—“regular matzah”.</p>\n  \n  <p>The third approach requires supervision of the grain from the time of\n  its harvesting until the actual baking of the matzah to ensure that it\n  did not come into any contact with water at any point whatsoever prior\n  to making it into a dough. This approach is concerned that the kernels\n  may have cracked after harvesting and become wet, creating a chometz\n  concern. Indeed, care is taken to harvest the grain before it is fully\n  ripe, since fullyripened grain—even if still on the stalk—could\n  potentially become chometz under the right conditions. There is even a\n  discussion in the Poskim about whether a Jew must actually harvest the\n  grain, and whether one must supervise the transport of the grain to\n  ensure that it does not come in contact with water! Flour that is\n  “guarded” to this extent is known as Shmurah mi’Sh’as K’tzirah, and\n  this is the flour that is used to bake all hand and some machine\n  matzah. Such matzah is referred to as “Shmurah Matzah,” although all\n  other matzah is also, technically, “shmurah” according to many\n  opinions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Here are two opposing views about women and wisdom. </p>\n\n<p>Rashi (referencing <em>Vayikra Rabba</em> 2:1) understands the passage to mean that if it's so hard to find a single man wise enough to teach Gemara, then one should be particularly cautious with women:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>אדם אחד מאלף מצאתי</strong> - בנוהג שבעולם אלף נכנסים למקרא אין יוצאים מהם להצליח שראויים למשנה אלא מאה ואותם מאה שנכנסו למשנה אין יוצאים מהם לגמרא אלא עשרה ואותן עשרה שנכנסין לגמרא אין מצליח מהם אלא אחד להוראה הרי אחד מאלף</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>ואשה בכל אלה</strong> - אפילו באלף לכך אתה צריך להזהר בה</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>One man in a thousand I found</strong>- The way of the world is that out of a thousand who enter to learn Torah, only one hundred successfully come out fit for studying Mishna. And out of those hundred who went to learn Mishna, only ten come out fit for studying Gemara. And out of those ten who went to learn Gemara, only one come is successful to teach. He is one in a thousand. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>But a woman among all those</strong>- even in a thousand, so you must be careful with her. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there are midrashim that don't follow rashi's implication of women's wisdom. Continuing from the midrash that Rashi references, the <em>Meam Loez</em> expounds upon the idea that the verse is discussing Abraham and Sarah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"One man in a thousand I have found\" - that is Abraham. \"But a woman among all those I have not found\"-that is Sarah. If all the excellent traits of a thousand men were pooled, it would be possible to attain to the stature of Abraham. But the combined good traits of a thousand women would not equal the character traits of Sarah, who was greater in prophesy than Abraham. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <em>Meam Loez</em> here suggests that women can't reach the wisdom of Sarah, not because they are less capable than men, but because of Sarah's unattainable level of prophesy - a level higher than what men might collectively seek. </p>\n\n\n",

As a result, it cannot be destroyed as that would be theft from the non-Jew.

If necessary it can be kicked into a corner with a shinui before being covered.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://businesshalacha.com/en/newsletter/chametz-found-pesach\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chametz Found on Pesach</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q</strong>:  Last year someone discovered chametz in his house on Pesach. He\n  asked whether he should put it away with the rest of the chametz that\n  he sold to the gentile so the gentile would acquire it, or must he\n  destroy it?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A</strong>: The method of acquisition that you describe is called kinyan\n  chatzer and involves one’s property acquiring possessions on his\n  behalf. There is a debate regarding the efficacy of a kinyan chatzer\n  for a gentile. The mechanism of this proprietary act is that one’s\n  property works as his agent and the halachic principle of agency does\n  not exist for a gentile (see Ketzos 194:3 and Nesivos, introduction to\n  200). In this circumstance, when one discovers chametz after it is\n  prohibited, it is not possible to sell it, and declaring it ownerless\n  or throwing it in the trash would not be effective. The chametz must\n  be destroyed (O.C. 446:1), and preferably it should be burned (M.B.\n  445:6).</p>\n  \n  <p>The truth is, however, that nowadays, even though the chametz was not\n  placed where the chametz that was sold to the gentile is stored, it\n  was, nevertheless, sold, and belongs to the gentile. The reason is\n  that the contract that one signs to sell his chametz to the gentile\n  includes even chametz that is not stored in the designated area.\n  Therefore, the chametz that is found should be placed where the rest\n  of the sold chametz is stored (since it is prohibited to leave the\n  chametz in an area not rented to the gentile out of concern that one\n  will inadvertently eat it — O.C. 440:2). On Yom Tov, when chametz is\n  muktzeh, it should be pushed into that area in an unusual manner.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover there are authorities (Mikra’ei Kodesh, Pesach 1:74) who\n  write that nowadays when people sell all of their chametz it is\n  prohibited to take the forgotten chametz to burn it. The reason is\n  that if one were to physically take the chametz to burn it he would\n  actively violate the prohibition against owning chametz, because he\n  thus becomes a thief and is responsible to return the chametz to the\n  gentile who purchased it (see Magen Avraham 586:5, which states that\n  one who steals chametz from a gentile is responsible for it and it is\n  considered his chametz by virtue of that responsibility). Although his\n  intent is not to steal in order to assume ownership, nevertheless,\n  even taking another’s possession with the intent to destroy it is\n  categorized as theft (B.K. 98a).</p>\n  \n  <p>Others contend that although it would seem that one may not destroy\n  the chametz, since it belongs to the gentile, he is permitted to burn\n  it. Although the sale of the chametz is certainly valid and binding\n  and one may not cancel that sale, nevertheless the gentile’s intent\n  when purchasing the chametz is to assist the Jews who plan to\n  repurchase it. Whatever money the gentile spent to purchase the\n  chametz will be refunded after Pesach when he resells it to the Jews;\n  if a piece of chametz is burned, it will not affect that sale. Since\n  the gentile is not particular whether a piece is burned or not, it is\n  not considered theft for a Jew who finds it to take it to burn.\n  Therefore, according to this opinion, someone who does not want to\n  rely on the sale of chametz for actual chametz may burn chametz that\n  he finds on Pesach (Shevet Halevi 9:116; Kisei Mishpat 187).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As I understand it, the shared bracha ties the karpas to the meal, and so it is covered by bentching.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Based on the comments there, there are also minhagim to specifically eat a kezayit.</p>\n\n<p>But isn't there a simple way of doing both?  You can just make sure to eat a haadama fruit as part of the \"dessert\" at the end of the meal in shulchan orech (of course before the afikoman), and have in mind that the haadama on the karpas covers that.  Then, either way, you wouldn't make a borei nefashot on the karpas, since the bracha continues to the meal and the karpas is again covered by bentching.</p>\n\n<p>Short version: you eat a (>kezayit) piece of cantaloupe during shulchan orech, as a dessert distinct from the main part of the meal, which fulfills exactly the same role as the maror does in (2), but according to (1) as well.</p>\n\n<p>This would seem to solve all the problems, but I've never heard this suggestion before.  Is there a source for it?  Is there a reason it wouldn't work?</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does fruit juice, when mixed with flour, not count as chametz, since it contains water?",
    "content": "# Why does fruit juice, when mixed with flour, not count as chametz, since it contains water?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How can mixing flour with fruit juice be <a href=\"/q/57110\">permitted on Passover</a>, since all fruit juice, even pure juice directly squeezed from fruit always contains water?. Water, H2O, is simply a chemical component of fruit juice, as it is also of wine, milk and honey. Only oil could possibly be water-free. In substances like milk and wine there is always a large amount of water. This water is not added in any way, but part of the very definition of these substances. So to my knowledge such a mixture would be chametz.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There has become a shift in how people view chametz. In the times of the Talmud people talked about the <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/pesachim/points/ps-ps-048.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">physical signs of chametz, the dough getting cracks, turning white, or making a sound if you slapped it</a> (it it didn't make a sound it was referred to as deaf dough). So it used to be that people would look at dough to tell if it was chametz, rather than rely on other things (like time) to determine whether or not something was chametz. The only scenarios where Chazal would use time to determine chametz would be in the instances where dough had been left unattended for a while. Which is why Rambam ruled that as long as you work the dough, it will never become chametz, no matter how long ago you added water to the dough.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam's Mishneh Torah - Chametz U'Matzah - Chapter Five, Halacha 13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>As long as a person is busy with the dough, even for the entire day,\n  it will not become chametz.</strong> If he lifts up his hand and allows the\n  dough to rest so that [it rises to the extent that] a noise will\n  resound when a person claps it with his hand, it has already become\n  chametz and must be burned immediately. If a noise does not resound\n  and the dough has lain at rest for the time it takes a man to walk a\n  mil, it has become chametz and must be burned immediately.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then perception of chametz started to shift in a different direction. Rather than look for signs of chimutz, we started to worry about chametz before any visible signs appeared. And so by the time the Shulchan Arukh gets written, one could have invalid matzah even if no visible signs were present. According to Karo, if one worked the dough (and thereby warmed it with his hands), <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Shulchan_Aruch/Orach_Chaim/459\" rel=\"nofollow\">and let it sit for a few moments rather than rolling it out and putting it in the oven</a>, it was chametz even if it had no visible signs.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Arukh Siman 459:2 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The dough should not be left idle for even a moment. <strong>As long as it is being used, even the whole day, it will not rise.</strong> If it is left idle for the time that it takes to walk a mil, it is hametz. A mil is a quarter of an hour plus a twentieth of an hour. <em>After dealing with the dough and warming it with your hands, if it is left idle, it will rise immediately.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And now we get to the modern time where people think that any contact with water automatically makes something chametz, causing people to erroneously think that water is what causes something to become chametz, but this is not true. In fact this idea is so foreign that Rambam wouldn't even understand what you are talking about, as this ruling of his will illustrate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam’s Mishneh Torah: Chametz U’Matzah Chapter 4 Halacha 10</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Grain upon which [water] leaking [from the roof] has fallen: As long\n  as [the leak] continues, drop after drop, it will not become chametz\n  even if [the leak continues] the entire day. However, if [the leak]\n  stops, if it remains [untouched] for the standard measure [of time] -\n  behold, it becomes chametz.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the reason that juice doesn't ferment probably has nothing to do with water content, as water doesn't automatically make something chametz. For even continuous dripping of water is enough to prevent grain from becoming chametz. </p>\n\n<p>So what is chametz? Chametz is the process in which the yeast that is floating in the air around us, lands in dough we are making, and if the dough is wet and is not worked (because yeast needs a calm environment in order to thrive), the yeast is able to reproduce and eat, producing gasses which make the dough rise. Therefore what makes something chametz is whether the mixture of liquid to grain/flour is hospitable for yeast to grow and propagate. i am not aware of any reasons the Rabbis give for why fruit juice (<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=aIAynWkX-ggC&pg=PA125&lpg=PA125&dq=why%20matzah%20fruit%20juice&source=bl&ots=ShKznuhnFU&sig=ZCZc2V8Es9oJXfvESW69TAIM5Ls&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiClqnf2ozMAhVW-mMKHUEGBg8Q6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&q=why%20matzah%20fruit%20juice&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">or milk for that matter</a>) stops bread from becoming chametz, i can only turn to science to find answers. So while there may be water in fruit juice, maybe there isn't enough water in the juice for the yeast to ferment, <a href=\"http://www.kingarthurflour.com/learn/bread-machine-ingredients.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">or maybe there is too much sugar from the juice and the yeast can't handle it</a>, thereby preventing any chametz. Water isn't the issue, it's the yeast that floats in the air all around us that lands in your dough while you are kneading that is the issue.</p>\n\n<p>So what likely happened was that the Rabbis of the Talmud, and thereby the Rambam, and even Karo had probably noticed that when you mix fruit juice with flour, the dough never takes any signs of chametz. And since it never shows any visible signs of become chametz, then clearly it's not chametz, despite the fact that water exists in fruit juices. If you have any doubts of this, mix fruit juice and dough and see if it ever rises, and you will have the answer to your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The laws of mixing fruit juices with flour derive from two seemingly irreconcilable Talmudic teachings:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבה בר בר חנה אמר ריש לקיש: עיסה שנילושה ביין ושמן ודבש - אין חייבין על חימוצה כרת</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabba bar bar Hanna said in the name of Reish Lakish: Dough kneaded with wine, oil or honey that rises is not forbidden as chametz (Pesachim 35a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>vs. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והתניא: אין לשין עיסה בפסח ביין ושמן ודבש. ואם לש, רבן גמליאל אומר: תשרף מיד, וחכמים אומרים: יאכל</p>\n  \n  <p>It was taught: It is forbidden to knead dough on Pesach with wine, oil\n  or honey. If someone did knead such a dough — Rabban Gamaliel says it must be destroyed immediatey. But the sages say it may be eaten. (Pesachim 36a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although the initial statement implies that only water causes the kind of leavening the Torah deems as chametz, various interpretations on this teaching have led to various traditions. The Ashkenazic custom to generally refrain from dough kneaded with fruit juice during Passover is derived from Rashi's understanding (Pesachim 36a) that such a mixture, while not full-fledged chametz, was nonetheless forbidden by the sages for being <em>chametz nukshe</em> - a lower category of almost-chametz. </p>\n\n<p>However, many authorities, starting with Tosafot, have contested this interpretation of the Talmud, insisting that pure fruit juices alone cannot make chametz; the second Talmudic passage here means that it is forbidden for someone to add such liquids into a dough already containing flour and water. </p>\n\n<p>Sephardim follow the ruling of the Shulchan Arukh (462:1), which allows fruit-based dough, based on Tosafot's understanding of chametz. </p>\n\n<p>Even though H2O exists in fruit juice, the lenient opinions understand pure water as what causes the Torah's definition of chametz. If you're looking for a finer distinction, see R. Ovadia Yosef's responsum (Yabia Omer 9:42), in which he asserts that rising agents added to Pesach cookies made with fruit juice help makes the dough puff up, but do not technically leaven the dough. In his understanding, even when other ingredients make a dough appear to be chametz, it is only when grain is moistened by pure water that a product can be considered chametz. </p>\n\n\n",

That is, the basic requirement (derived from Shabbos) is Lechem Mishna Shleimim - two whole \"breads\" (at least Lechatchila). As we see below, it appears that breaking the yachatz piece during the seder, would remove it from the status of lechem mishne.</p>\n\n<p>Those that hold \"three\" at the seder say that the lechem mishna must be <em>shleimim</em> (whole). Once Yachatz has broken one of the matzos, we no longer have two matzos, we have 1.5 (or no longer two full pieces). We do not consider the broken piece as a full \"lechem\" for the purpose of lechem mishne (as explained by the Netziv).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/711920/rabbi-josh-flug/the-mitzvah-of-lechem-mishneh/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Mitzvah of Lechem Mishneh</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tosafot, Berachot 39b, s.v. V'Hilchita, write that on Shabbat, one\n  should not cut the bread until after reciting the beracha of hamotzi\n  in order to fulfill the mitzvah of lechem mishneh. It is implicit from\n  the comments of Tosafot that the mitzvah of lechem mishneh requires\n  that one should use two whole loaves. R. Ya'akov Reischer, Teshuvot\n  Minchat Ya'akov, no. 12, suggests that even if there is a biblical\n  requirement of lechem mishneh, there is no biblical requirement to use\n  two whole loaves. It is sufficient to have only one whole loaf. The\n  requirement that the second loaf be whole is only rabbinic in nature.\n  R. Naftali Z.Y. Berlin, Meishiv Davar 1:21, suggests that there is no\n  inherent requirement to use whole loaves. If the person who is\n  partaking of the lechem mishneh breaks the bread immediately prior to\n  reciting hamotzi, that bread is invalid for his lechem mishneh.\n  However, if the bread is broken prior to the meal, that bread may be\n  used for lechem mishneh. Tosafot, who caution cutting the bread prior\n  to the recitation of hamotzi, are concerned about invalidating the\n  bread for lechem mishneh by breaking it immediately prior to eating\n  it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon (and others) say that the critical point is to have lechem mishna and that the broken matza is still in that category.

But  why  do  we  then \n  need  three matzos instead of two? Well, in the course of the seder,\n  at \"yachats\" the middle matza is broken in two, and half  removed \n  (the  \"afikomen\").

The \n  Gemora,  in  Pesachim  (115A),  only says  that  one  of  the  matzos \n  must  be  broken  (not  necessarily  the  \"middle  one\"),  and  the \n  Rambam (Maimonides) and the Gr\"a (Vilna Gaon) were of the opinion that\n  there should only be two matzos.

So each Bracha is on a separate matsa. But Tosfot rejects the topic of \"package of mitsvot\" when the mitsvot are only blessings. In Kidush many blessings are on one glass of wine.<br>\n[8] <b>Rabbi Menachem from Vienna</b> (this opinion is reported in tos. Psachim 116a, and in Tos. Rabbi Yehuda Hachassid here).

There is no need to honor the whole matsa with the Bircat Hamotsi in this particular case of Lechem Oni. The presence of the whole matsa is only to provide Lechem Mishne.</li> <li>An additional point: R.M.V. thinks that <b>despite the fact that one of the two is not entire, we have Lechem Mishne</b> (contrary to the practice cited in the end of the Tosfot psachim (116a, also cited in Tur 475 quoted bellow)  witch need 2 whole Matsot besides the slice)</li></ol><br>\n[9] R.I. holds both when he blesses Hamotsi and Al Achilat Matsa, and then takes from both. The count of two Matsot corresponds to the count of Mitsvot. and no problem of \"packets\"<br>\n[10] At times, R.I. blessed Hamotsi and cracked the whole matsa a little (to honor the blessing with the whole), then blessed A.A.M and cracked both.<br>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Tur O.C. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2055\" rel=\"nofollow\">475, 7</a></h3>\n\n<blockquote> ‏  כתב רב אלפס שאין צריך אלא שתי מצות, אחת פרוסה לשנים ומברך על חציה המוציא ועל אכילת מצה וחציה השני לאפיקומן והשלמה לכריכה‏[11]‏ וכן כתבו קצת הגאונים ובחילוף מנהגים כתוב אנשי בבל כשחל פסח בשבת מניח פרוסה בין שתי השלימות וכשחל בחול מביא פרוסה ושלימה ומברך עליה ב' ברכות‏[12]‏ ואנשי ארץ ישראל בין בחול בין בשבת מניחין פרוסה על השלימה ומברך ‏(‏ על השלמה )‏ [על הפרוסה] שתי ברכות‏[13]‏ וכן חילק בה\"ג שכתב והיכא דמקלע פסחא בליל שבתא  בוצע על תרתין ופרוסה והתוס' כתבו שצריך לעשות ג' כדפרישית וכ\"כ רב עמרם ולזה הסכים א\"א הרא\"ש ז\"ל.      ‏</blockquote>\n\n<p>[11] According to the Rif. 2 matsot: 1 matsa divided in 2: one half for Motsi and Matsa, the second half for Afikomen. The whole matsa for Korech.<br>\n[12] The citizens of Babylon think that the Mitsva of <b>Lechem Mishne is on Shabbat only and not on Hollidays that fall on other days</b> of the week. They think also that <b>Lechem Mishne requires 2 whole matsot</b>.<br>\n[13] The citizens of Erets Israel think that <b>one doesn't necessarily need  2 whole Matsot for Lechem Mishne</b>.

Although the\n  day begins when the eastern horizon lights up (amud hashachar), Chazal\n  ruled that Hallel should not be said until after sunrise.</p>\n  \n  <p>The exception to this rule is when we recite Hallel on Pesach night as\n  part of the Haggadah, since the miracle took place at night.

    "content": "# Difference in Torah readings Israel vs. Diaspora and Pesach vs. Succot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/56478/5275\">This question</a> has a link in one of the comments referring to an article explaining why each day of Pesach has a different Torah reading.</p>\n\n<p>During Succot, I notice that the 2nd day of Yom Tov in Diaspora repeats the reading of the 1st day, whereas in Israel, the reading is different, and is only from the Succot sacrificial offerings mentioned in parshat Pinchas. I assume that in Diaspora, the reason we repeat the 1st day's reading is respect to Yom Tov, as we treat the 2nd day as the first? Technically, what would be wrong with reading the sacrificial portions as they do in Israel. and just repeating the readings of some sections, if needed. (We do this, anyway, on all days of Hol Hamo'ed Succot.)</p>\n\n<p>Another way is to view this in \"reverse\". On the 2nd day of Pesach, we could repeat the reading of the 1st day in Diaspora. Yet, here, Israel and Diaspora have the same reading, except for the number of aliyot, where Diaspora has 5 and Israel has 4.</p>\n\n<p>Why the difference in the reading rules between Pesach and Succot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If the 2nd day of Pesach has a \"doubt\" as to whether it is the first or second day then we would probably read both that of the first day and that of the second which means we would have to remove 3 Sifrei Torah instead of 2, and would have to do the same every day except the 8th day.</p>\n\n<p>On Sukkot it is less of a problem as the 2nd day reading is Maftir only and is adjacent to the one we read on the 1st day so we just read both in the diaspora.</p>\n\n<p>On Chol Hamoed Sukkot outside Israel we read 3 different portions then for the 4th aliyah repeat 2 of the days, the ones we are \"not sure\" it might be.</p>\n\n<p>With regards to Pesach though, there is also an aspect that we do \"know what day it is\" (e.g. the Omer counting and Chadash observance) and we keep the 2nd day as Yom Tov as a \"long-kept minhag\" so we combine those aspects by reading the associated 2nd day Torah reading on the day we observe as the 2nd day, even though that day is Chol Hamoed in Israel. We split it into 5 aliyos instead of 4.</p>\n\n<p>Note when it comes to the extra day of Yom Tov, (acharon) we do NOT repeat the k'ryia from the previous day but read instead the portion in Devarim (R'eh) about festivals. Thus we do not repeat \"Shira\" on 8th day nor the 10 commandments on 2nd day Shavout. And for Shmini Atzeret we actually postpone it to the extra day to read that portion.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in general, although we keep an extra day as Yom Tov we do differentiate between the days with regards to what we read from the Torah, as has been our tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason I can think of is the custom of pointing during the recitation of the mishnah of Rabban Gamliel: 'matzoh zo...', 'maror zeh..'. But that would be just two items.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.emunah.org/magazine_detail.php?id=101\" rel=\"nofollow\">This fascinating article</a> explains the origin of the Seder plate. Excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Mishnah (Pesachim 10:3) directs that, following the first cup of\n  wine: “They bring [a small traylike table] before him [the Seder\n  leader], he dips ba’chazeret [“with lettuce” for the first dipping]\n  until [or, according to Rashi, “before”] he reaches the parperet\n  ha-pat (“accompaniment of the bread”). They bring [a second table]\n  before him [with] matza, chazeret [“lettuce” for maror], and charoset\n  and two cooked dishes [in remembrance of the Pesach and Chagigah\n  offerings -- today usually a roasted bone and a roasted egg].” </p>\n  \n  <p>The original Seder had a definite Greco-Roman and Middle Eastern\n  flavor, most notably a Greek style of dining with the participants\n  actually reclining on low couches, pillows, or carpets around a\n  central location (not leaning on an elbow). The various Seder items\n  were placed on several low tables, which were carried in and out of\n  the room at designated points in the ceremony and placed in front of\n  the Seder leader. This practice is maintained today by many Yemenites\n  and other Eastern Jews.</p>\n  \n  <p>Since the Mishnah prescribed two separate small tables for the Seder\n  items, there emerged a dispute as to which items would be placed on\n  the single Seder plate. There was also a question as to when the Seder\n  plate would be placed on the table. Most rabbis directed the Seder\n  plate be placed on the table after the Kiddush and before the first\n  dipping, while others (Vilna Gaon in Ma’aseh Rav) waited until after\n  the karpas has been eaten, the point when the second table was brought\n  before the Seder leader.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The article contains further customs and info on why the plate became common.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is no need to have a specific plate set aside as the \"seder plate\". Many do so because they go out of their way to have a decorative plate in honor of the holiday. The custom I follow does now have a specific plate for this purpose and is not set up prior to starting the seder but the first thing to do is set up a plate when sitting down with the necessary items.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why not cook a z'roa just for the seder plate, in light of mitoch?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It's customary to have a bone (with some meat on it) on the table for the Passover <em>seder</em>. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.118.5\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em> 118:5</a> (as cited in the answers to <a href=\"/q/37109\">another question</a> on this site) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once the Temple was destroyed, the rabbis established that, at the time the <em>hagada</em> is recited [at the Passover <em>seder</em>], two types of cooked food be on the table…. People have practiced that one of the cooked foods is meat, from the limb called <em>z'roa</em>….<p>One must roast or cook them [before the holiday starts]. If he forgot…, he should roast or cook them at night, but must eat them the first day of the holiday. [The \"day\" runs from nightfall to nightfall.]  Likewise, for the second night [<em>seder</em>], he should roast or cook them and eat them [all] on the second day of the holiday. This is because we do not cook on [a day of] <em>yom tov</em> for another, nor on <em>yom tov</em> for a weekday. (And, since we don't eat roasted meat these two nights, he has to eat the <em>z'roa</em> by day specifically.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words: One can cook on <em>yom tov</em>, but only for the use of that same day of <em>yom tov</em>. So don't cook the bone on the first night of Passover unless you'll eat it the first day.</p>\n\n<p>But I'd think that one could cook it the first night of Passover, and rely (for \"use it the same day\" purposes) on the placement on the table in fulfillment of the custom to do so. That itself would seem to be a use. Indeed, when <em>KSA</em> itself codifies the rule that cooking — and likewise lighting a fire — on a holiday can be for the same day only, it says (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.101.2\" rel=\"nofollow\">101:2</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Likewise, it is forbidden to place the lamps in the candelabrum… on the first day of the holiday for the [following] night, unless he needs to use them before nighttime also or for the honor of the synagogue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that lighting candles in a synagogue, even by day when the light is not needed, is a perfectly good use of lighting a fire on the holiday, since it's for the honor of the synagogue. (See also <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Aruch.13.1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>KSA</em> 13:1</a>.) And in general (though I cannot find this in <em>KSA</em>) we say cooking and lighting are permitted for any activity necessary for <em>yom tov</em>, not only for eating (a principle called \"<em>mitoch</em>\").</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, displaying a cooked bone at the <em>seder</em> is <em>not</em> a sufficient use to permit cooking on the holiday. Why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rema at very beginning of Hilchos Yom Tov (495, 1) rules that the permission to cook food on Yom Tov because of 'ochel nefesh' only applies if by cooking the food before Yom Tov the taste will deteriorate by the time you eat it. However, if your food will still taste fresh, one should cook it before Yom Tov. </p>\n\n<p>The Yaavetz in his Siddur vol. 2, p.20b, <a href=\"https://is.gd/KoWyVP\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ten lines from the bottom</a> says that because one is not going to eat the 'Zeroah' at the meal one has to roast it before Yom Tov, and the same applies to the egg even if one will eat it that night, since the taste will not worsen if one cooks/roasts it before Yom Tov. Clearly, if one isn't allowed to cook these items on Yom Tov even if one will eat them, all the more so one isn’t be allowed to cook them just in order to display them.</p>\n\n\n",

There are various reasons why there was no takana to say birchas me'ein sheva on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Tur/Shulchan Orach in O'Ch 487, we don't say me'ein sheva on Pesach because it is Leil Shimurim, a protected night, so we don't need to worry about the dangers in siman 268.\n(This does not answer why we wouldn't say it on a different Yom Tov and in fact both my Siddur and Machzor state we only skip it Pesach that lands on a Friday night. When Succos lands on a Friday night, we do say it.)</p>\n\n<p>The source of the blessing on Shabbos night is the Gemara in maseches Shabbos 24b which says we say it because of sakana, danger. Rashi explains that people came to shul Friday night (as opposed to weekdays) and we are afraid they didn't hurry to shul and will be left there alone after the tefila finishes, so we stretch out the tefila bitzibur.</p>\n\n<p>Shearim Mitzuyanim Bihalacha there asks why the blessing wasn't instituted on Yom Tov.

He also quotes the machzor vitri who writes another understanding of sakana was because on Shabbos one may not carry a torch. This implies, says ShM'B, that we are not worried about Sakana because one can take a torch.</p>\n\n<p>He also quotes the Sfas Emes who says they would only accept Shabbos early (leaving some people to come late) whereas they did not accept Yom Tov early. </p>\n\n<p>(He does mention that Sfas Emes points to Tosafos in Taanis 2b s.v. HaOver quoting a Yerushalmi that not everyone came to shul at night on Yom Tov, however if you look there you'll see this was not mentioned as opposed to Friday night where everyone came, but rather the point was that more people (\"everyone\") would be there in the morning. I don't have the Sfas Emes handy so I can't tell you for sure what his point was.)</p>\n\n<p>ShM'B also quotes the Chidushei HaRan who says that this was only instituted for Friday nights because Mazikim are more common on Friday nights and Tuesday nights. This leaves the question concerning Shavuos which may fall on Tuesday night, which he answers by saying it is not such a common occurrence, so they did not institute saying it.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Akiva Eiger in the Gilyon HaShas there, citing the Maharsha to Pesachim 102a, explains the logic of the Ri that <em>safek berachos lehakel</em> only applies to blessings on <em>mitzvos</em>, in which the blessing does not prevent fulfillment of the <em>mitzvah</em>.

The literal translation is perhaps more \"things witch <i>come because of the meal</i>\". We will deal with these nuances after.<br>\n</li><li>\n<h3>Rashi comments:</h3>\n<blockquote>דברים הבאים מחמת הסעודה. ללפת בהן את הפת:\nאין טעונין ברכה. ‏<b>‏ ‏[1]‏דהוו להו טפלה ‏</b>‏ הלכך כל מידי בין מזון בין פירות שהביאו ללפתן אין בו ברכה לא לפניו ולא לאחריו:‏<br>Things witch are eaten with bread are accessory to the bread witch is the basic component of the meal.  \n</blockquote></li><li>\n<h3>But if we learn Tosfot (thus is ruled in S.A. <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x991\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">177, 1</a>)</h3> we will discover additional parameters.\n<blockquote>\n‏ פי' ר''י דברים הבאים מחמת הסעודה בתוך הסעודה כלומר הרגילים לבא מחמת הסעודה בפת שרגילים לאכלן עם הפת כגון בשר ודגים וכל מיני קדרה והביאן בתוך הסעודה ‏[2]‏ אין טעונין ברכה לפניהם ולאחריהם אפי' אכלן בתוך הסעודה בפני עצמן בלא פת דכיון דמשום פת הם באין הפת פוטרתן   ‏\n</blockquote>\n[1] Rashi uses in its narrowed definition the concept of Iqar veTafel (basic vs. and accessory component). Tosfot agrees with the principle, but points that here the principle of accessory aliment is extended to an aliment consumed even alone, not with bread. The reasoning of Tosfot follows the fact that \"bread\" itself is an aliment-principle,<i> the word is basically <b>a METONYMY.</b></i><br>\n[2] R.I. says that foods witch are a part of the meal as meat, fish, [legumes (added in Rosh)] and pastes (free translation according to a widely propagated Italian minhag) do not need Bracha even when we eat them without bread. Because they enter typically in a meal with bread.\n</li><li>\n<h3>Potatoes</h3>\nthey are the paradigm of nutritious meal, so, anyway they are a part of the meal. Even at the end of the meal. (A big cake slice even at the end of the meal may be a substantial part of the meal and perhaps does not need bracha, and blessing Mezonot may be a problem of Bracha Levatala.)\n</li><li>\n<h3>Popcorn</h3><ol><li>\nObviously Popcorn are not a part of a meal. But there are usually consumed in large quantities. </li><li>\nIf they are the major component of the meal, although  this is unusual, no bracha is needed. See Yerushalmi Brachot 6, 5 <blockquote>‏רב חונה אכל תמרין עם פיסתיה ‏[3]‏ א\"ל רב חייא בר אשי פליג את על רבך שובקין בתר מזונך ואת מברך עליהן תחילה וסוף א\"ל אינין אינין עיקר נגיסתי ‏</blockquote>\n\n[3] Rav Huna was eating dates with bread and Rav Chia Bar Ashi looked this as a strange attitude, as a stratagem to avoid blessing on fruits after a meal. Rav Huna told him that actually the dates where the main part of his meal. <br>\n</li><li>\nIf the dates are not the main part of the meal, Bracha Rishona is needed, as for peanuts or almonds.<br>\n</li><li>\nIf you eat them with bread, anyway no problem of Bracha, they become contingent to bread.\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If you are eating it (kavono) </p>\n\n<p><strong>for the meal</strong>, <strong>to get full</strong> (or it <strong>is usual that a meal is based on it</strong> (fish, meat...) it is covered  . </p>\n\n<p>for <strong>pleasure</strong> or as a <strong>dessert</strong> (to clean the taste in your mouth/thought) then it is <strong>not covered</strong> (if not something that a meal is based on)</p>\n\n<p>So by chips it depends on your kavono</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh1/15/177/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan aruch harav 177</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What teshuvot address educating children on inappropriate touch?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A friend of a non-observant family shared a story which inspired this question. </p>\n\n<p>Two cousins were playing together. The boy was about 7 years old. The girl was about 3 years old. Early on, the mother (mother-A) of the 3 year old girl had educated her on what is and is not appropriate touch. After the two cousins were playing, the girl informed mother-A that the boy had 'touched' her inappropriately. Mother-A did not take this lightly (being a victim of family molestation) and informed her sister - mother-B - of what had transpired. </p>\n\n<p>Mother-B was certain that her son would not intentionally do this. It is too easy to touch a 'forbidden' area (which could be respectively appropriate generally, yet forbidden to some i.e. touching the thigh) by accident. She also understood that a three year old might get an 'idea' of what inappropriate touch is but still does not have discernment to know what is malicious or not. </p>\n\n<p>Mother-B talked her sister out of making this an issue that could destroy the family. Mother-A dropped it. Unfortunately, there was still recoil. Mother-B warned her son to never be alone with the little girl again. And though the cousins today have a great relationship, mother-A (aunt) and the boy (nephew) do not. </p>\n\n<p>If molestation runs in the family, does educating children start earlier than if not? Does the gender being educated affect how and when education proceeds? Like in our story if a parent is a victim of molestation, is it advised for the parent to first address it within him/herself for a better educational outcome and emotional development of the child? </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When and why did the custom to have young children end Musaph Shabbat davening begin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In most shuls that I have attended (mainly Nusach Ashkenaz), young children (below Bar Mitzvah age, usually) finish the Shabbat davening at the end of Musaph. I.e., they sing from <em>En K'elokeinu</em> through <em>Adon Olam</em>.</p>\n\n<p>How and why did this custom begin?</p>\n\n<p>I have a concern with their doing this. While this is not a scientific poll, I asked about 20 young kids (ages 6 - about 11) if they actually recite the entire <em>Pitum Haktoret</em>, the passage after <em>En K'elokeinu</em>. All said, no. The words were too hard from them to pronounce, and I guess, being that there is no song to them, I can understand, somewhat, why this is harder than \"Aleinu\". OK, if, technically, you're a <em>Shaliach Tzibbur</em>, aren't you supposed to say everything? Is it correct to assign a kid who can't do it and just says the ending \"for show\"? </p>\n\n<p>I can probably say the same thing about <em>An'im Zemirot</em>, though, it seems that since they have to sing it aloud, that may be an incentive for them to pronounce the words better. (When I was a younger boy (not a \"Yunger man\"), my chazzan would not let me sing Anim Zemirot, exactly because of this concern that the words were too hard to pronounce.)</p>\n\n<p>In short, a combo question - why did he custom become this way, and is it the correct thing to use kids that can't pronounce the words or don't even bother in the first place?  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I remember hearing once that the Vilna Gaon (I think) said that Anim Zemirot is one of the holiest pieces of tefillah and it should only be said on Yom Kippur.  I wonder whether since children are considered to be pure and their aveirot are not counted before Bar Mitzvah, if we are going to sing it every Shabbat, we have children do it as adults are not pure enough to do it.  I don't have a source for that idea - just something that occurred to me once.  Once children are singing Anim Zemirot, it makes sense that it could easily have become extended to the other final parts of davening.  </p>\n\n<p>Possibly there is also an idea of Chinuch since we want the children to learn how to lead the davening so that we have the next generation of baalei tefillah and this is a good starting point?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Connections between Biur Chametz and Tashlich?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any commentators that discuss the parallels between the rituals of <em>biur chametz</em> and <em>tashlich</em>?  At a surface level, both involve destroying or eliminating bread, one via fire and one via water (which are symbolically opposite to one another).  <em>Chametz</em> is broadly associated with the <em>yetzer hara</em>, and the bread that was cast into the water at <em>tashlich</em> symbolizes sins, so it seems clear that there are parallels.  Are there deeper connections?  Where are they discussed?</p>\n\n<p><strong>ETA:</strong>  To clarify, I understand that <em>halachically</em> there is no similarity between the two practices.  Symbolically, though, they seem similar (\"destroying the chametz which represents our <em>yetzer hara</em>\" vs. \"casting away the bread to symbolize casting off our sins\").

You are speaking of the normal Shabbat and Yom Tov candelabra. </p>\n\n<p>There is a custom cited by Mishnah Berurah 263:6 to light seven or ten candles. This could be a reason why silversmiths make seven branched candelabras beside the custom referred to below.</p>\n\n<p>A woman lights candles for her family before Shabbat and Yom Tov. The custom is to add a candle to the original two for each child. That is a woman would light two candles for Shabbat, one for shamor and on for zachor. She would than add an additional candle for each child that she has. Once she is already lighting a certain number of candles for Shabbat, she may not decrease that number (which accounts for the same number on Yom Tov).</p>\n\n<p>One reason can be that if a woman forgets, then she adds an additional candle the following weeks. Once she lights an additional candle, she continues doing so. However,many people separate the two customs since it is not a case of \"forgetting\" but of being forced not to light (and the husband will light for the household).</p>\n\n<p>That would mean a custom of lighting one (above the basic two) for each additional member of the household.</p>\n\n<p>When visiting someone, the custom is to light two so as not to cause difficulties for the host.</p>\n\n<p>I should note that my wife lights one additional for each child even though she did not miss a shabbos for every child, and one additional one for a Shabbos in which she was ill and fell asleep before Shabbos after I had left for shul.</p>\n\n<p>The five branched candlestick would be for a family with three children, the seven branched for five children, etc.. However, many people get this so as to not have to buy additional candle sticks as each child comes along or are given one as a gift. Others will get the bigger one after the children have arrived and they can afford the expense.</p>\n\n<p>שמירת שבת כהלכתה bring the reason for the common מנהג to add a licht per child in the family.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In times gone by, the new mother would stay in hospital for a number\n  of days following birth, and would generally not be in a position to\n  light שבת licht the first שבת following the birth of a child.\n  Therefore the mother has a din of one who forgot to light, for which\n  the הלכה is that they must light an extra candle every week for the\n  rest of her life!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gt.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5764/korach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos Candles</a> goes into detail about various minhagim and cites the sources. It says that the wide spread minhag of one extra per child is not addressed explicitly in the classical meforshim. That seems to be why it is connected to the addition of a forgotten candle.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>While the answerers who preceded me are correct that this seems no different from the regular candelabrum for any other holiday or <em>Shabas</em>, I'll note that <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (472:2) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He should set his table (for the <em>seder</em> on <em>Pesach</em>) with nice receptacles to the extent of his ability.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Magen Avraham</em> (paraphrased also in <em>Mishna B'rura</em>) explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>All year, it's good to minimize nice receptacles, as a memorial for the [Temple's] destruction. However, on the night of <em>Pesach</em>, he should increase nice receptacles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, you may have seen this candelabrum on the table on <em>Pesach</em> only.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that the answer is \"simpler\" than what sabbahillel mentioned.

The 9th cup is for the <em>shamash</em>, and some people don't specifically place this on the menorah at all.</p>\n\n<p>Some silversmiths have made \"combo\" candelabra / menorahs. For Shabbat and holidays, the branches swing around and for Chanukah, you can put them in a straight line to form a menorah. On many of them, the branches are also detachable, so someone who doesn't need all of them can remove them for Shabbat and attach them for Chanukah.</p>\n\n\n",

In Rav Hershel Schachter's <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/2004/parsha/rsch_dvorim2.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> explaining why women Rabbis isn't advisable (to say the least):  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One aspect of Elokus is the fact that Hashem is a \"Keil Mistater\", He\n  always prefers to hide b'tzinah. Therefore we assume that part of our\n  mitzvah of preserving our tzelem Elokim is for all of us to lead\n  private lives. The prophet Micha (6:8) uses the verb \"leches\" in\n  conjunction with tznius: \"vehatznea leches im Elokecha.\" The rabbis of\n  the Talmud (Sukkah 49b) understood the choice of that particular verb\n  to be an allusion to the expression in Koheles (7:2) \"tov laleches el\n  beis ovel mileches el beis mishteh.\" This particular form of the verb\n  appears in connection with a funeral and a wedding - occasions which\n  are intended for a public outpouring of emotion. The navi Micha is\n  telling us that even on these occasions one should tone down his\n  public display of his inner emotions. And kal vachomer - so much more\n  so all year long, one should try to lead as private (as tzanua) a life\n  as possible.</p>\n  \n  <p>Sometimes the halacha requires of us to act in a public fashion\n  (b'farhesia), for example to have tefilah b'tzibur, krias haTorah\n  b'tzibur, etc. On these occasions the halacha distinguishes between\n  men and women. We only require and demand of men that they compromise\n  on their tznius and observe certain mitzvos in a farhesia (public)\n  fashion. We do not require this of women. They may maintain their\n  middas hahistatrus, just as Hashem (most of the time) is a Kel\n  Mistater (Yeshaya 45:15). Of course, if there are no men in the shul\n  who are able to lein and get the aliyos, we will have no choice but to\n  call upon a woman, and require of her to compromise on her privacy and\n  lein, to enable the minyan to fulfill their obligation of krias\n  haTorah. If there is a shul where a woman gets an aliyah, this is an\n  indication that there was no man who was able to lein, and this is an\n  embarrassment to that minyan. This is what the rabbis meant when they\n  said that a woman should not lein - for this would constitute an\n  embarrassment to the minyan (Megillah 23a.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Can women be incredibly insightful role models in middos, hashkafas hachaim, bitachon...<strong>absolutely</strong>! Does that mean those women must compromise their tznius? <strong>Absolutely not</strong>! Countless women serve as mentors for so many future wives and mothers of the next generation. I have personally seen a few Roshei Yeshiva strongly consider their Rebbetzin's input when deciding certain difficult life questions for other people. This isn't even including the women throughout the various communities all over who have provide shiurim and discussion groups for other women - certainly \"matters of growth and hashkafas hachaim\" and more. These wise women are advising many people in these areas, just not necessarily open to the public eye.      </p>\n\n\n",

(As I don't believe in coincidence, I think the English word \"piece\" may have come from the Hebrew, in some way!)</p>\n<p>See Radak on Genesis 18:5:1 (Sefaria English translation) - Hebrew & English excerpted by me:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואקחה פת לחם, כי הנה אברהם אמר פת לחם <strong>שפירושו חתיכת לחם</strong> ולא אמר\nלחם כמו שאמר מעט מים כמו שפירשנו. ואקחה פת לחם</p>\n<p>Avraham spoke about a <strong>piece</strong> of bread, whereas in fact he served\na sumptuous meal.  He had even understated the amount of bread he\nwould serve by not saying ואקח לחם, but ואקחה פת לחם, a reference to\nless than a whole loaf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further support for the concept that the word means \"piece\" is Leviticus 2:6 (Sefaria English):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פָּת֤וֹת אֹתָהּ֙ פִּתִּ֔ים וְיָצַקְתָּ֥ עָלֶ֖יהָ שָׁ֑מֶן מִנְחָ֖ה\nהִֽוא׃ (ס)</p>\n<p>Thou shalt break it in pieces, and pour oil thereon; it is a\nmeal-offering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As your question appears to be general, it seems that Tanach's use of the term refers to the term \"piece\". See Ruth 2:14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּאמֶר֩ לָ֨ה בֹ֜עַז לְעֵ֣ת הָאֹ֗כֶל גֹּ֤שִֽׁי הֲלֹם֙ <strong>וְאָכַ֣לְתְּ\nמִן־הַלֶּ֔חֶם וְטָבַ֥לְתְּ פִּתֵּ֖ךְ</strong> בַּחֹ֑מֶץ וַתֵּ֙שֶׁב֙ מִצַּ֣ד\nהַקּֽוֹצְרִ֔ים וַיִּצְבָּט־לָ֣הּ קָלִ֔י וַתֹּ֥אכַל וַתִּשְׂבַּ֖ע\nוַתֹּתַֽר׃</p>\n<p>And Boaz said unto her at meal-time: ‘Come hither, and eat <strong>of the\nbread, and dip thy morsel</strong> in the vinegar.’ And she sat beside the\nreapers; and they reached her parched corn, and she did eat and was\nsatisfied, and left thereof</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<p>The above example, in separating the 2 terms \"pat\" and \"lechem\" makes it pretty clear that \"pat\" means \"piece\".</p>\n<p>I am assuming that when both Mishnah, and in your case your quoting Shulchan Aruch, they use the term \"pat\" when meaning eating a slice or piece of bread. I think \"lechem\" would be used when it refers to \"bread\" as a general food, for example, if they were talking about what grains would be considered \"bread\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do any Ashkenazim restrict making hamotzi on dry matzah to meals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>i was reading <a href=\"http://web.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/pesach/RJJ-soft%20matzah%202014.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> that posited something i had never heard before. The article claimed that according to Sephardic opinions, hard cracker like matzah wasn't considered bread and therefore one should shouldn't make hamotzi with it, but should make mezonot. This was surprising enough, but then the article claimed that even Ashkenazi Rabbis agree that dry matzah isn't technically bread. Is it true that even Ashkenazi Rabbis say you say hamotzi over it because of its place in the meal, rather than the matzah itself having the status as always-hamotzi? The relevant text is as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The assumption is that matzah is the normal bread for Pesach and\n  therefore, like all bread, should require the bracha of “hamotzi”. The\n  Gemara (Brachot 41-42) discusses the rules of Pat Haba’a Bekisnin – a\n  type of pseudo-bread (Shulchan Aruch OC 168:6) that if eaten in small\n  quantities gets a blessing of mezonot. There is a major three-way\n  machloket (conflict) of how to define Pat Haba’a Bekisnin , with one\n  opinion being that it means thin, hard crackers. This would seem to\n  exactly describe modern matzah. Based on this, many authorities ruled\n  that one says mezonot on hard matzah. The Shiurei Knesset Hagdola (OC\n  158, Hagahot Beit Yosef 1) says that matzah gets hamotzi because it is\n  not so hard, implying that his matzah was neither soft like bread nor\n  hard like crackers and therefore he ruled to say hamotzi. It seems\n  that he would rule to say mezonot on modern, very hard matzah. Rav\n  Ovadia Yosef (Yechave Da’at 3:12) cites a laundry list of\n  similar-minded authorities, and that is standard practice among most\n  Sephardim. Nonetheless, there are significant Ashkenazi authorities\n  (e.g. Minchat Yitzchak 1:71 and Tzitz Eliezar 11:19) who labor to\n  defend the Ashkenazi practice of saying hamotzi. The primary\n  explanation for why it receives hamotzi is that, when eaten, it forms\n  the basis of the meal (kviat seudah), implying that it is not\n  inherently “real bread”. An indication of this is that on real bread\n  there is no minimum shiur (amount); even the smallest piece gets\n  hamotzi (Shulchan Aruch OC 168:10; MB 168:47, 60). However small pieces of maztah, i.e.\n  matzah crackers, even if they are identical to matzah, get the\n  blessing mezonot because they are eaten as a snack. This is a\n  strong argument against modern matzah being considered\n  “lechem”, and raises a concern about using it for the seder.\n  In addition, the Mishnah Berurah (168:37) writes that for very,\n  very thin (dak min ha’dak) crackers that are baked (see Sha’ar\n  haTziyun 168:36) by putting the batter between two metal\n  plates and baking instantly, the bracha is mezonot even if one\n  makes a meal out of it. These crackers are halachically less\n  significant as bread than Pat Haba’a Bekisnin. Rav Moshe\n  Sternbuch (Tshuvot v’Hanhagot 3:73) raises the possibility that\n  hard machine matzah falls within that category and therefore\n  should not be hamotzi and not be acceptable for the mitzvah\n  (see Rambam, Hilchot Chametz u’Matzah 6:7). He justifies using\n  them because they are not baked instantly and are thus dak\n  (thin) and not dak min ha’dak (ultra-thin). He concludes that\n  they may be Pat Haba’a Bekisnin and one who wants to be\n  machmir (strict) should only eat them as part of a bread meal. It\n  seems to us that while machine matzah does not bake\n  instantly, there are hand matzah factories that take pride in the\n  paper-thinness of their matzah and the fact that the oven is so\n  hot that the matzah bakes in mere seconds. According to Rav\n  Sternbuch, those matzot may indeed be truly problematic. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is anachronistic as kabbalah did not appear until many centuries later, and the Rambam previously defined maaseh merkavah as metaphysics in his Introduction to the Guide for the Perplexed where he states</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some general principles bearing upon this point have been fully discussed in our works on the Talmud, and we have there called the attention of the reader to many themes of this kind. We also stated (Mishneh torah, I. ii. 12, and iv. 10) that the expression Ma'ase Bereshit (Account of the Creation) signified\" Natural Science,\" and Ma'aseh Mercabah (\" Description of the Chariot\" ) Metaphysics, and we explained the force of the Rabbinical dictum,\" The Ma'aseh Mercabak must not be fully expounded even in the presence of a single student, unless he be wise and able to reason for himself, and even then you should merely acquaint him with the heads of the different sections of the subject.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/69583/9629\">Here is a post explaining</a> the history of kabbalah, as I was asked to provide a source for its non-antique credentials.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishna (Chagigah 2:1 or 11b) indeed writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One may not expound the laws of forbidden sexual relations before\n  three people, nor the account of Creation before two, nor the Divine\n  Chariot before one, unless he is wise and understanding from his own\n  knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam writes that one should not study Kabbala before one has a very strong knowledge of Torah, Mishna and Gemara (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904979/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Four.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">MT Hilchot Yesodei HaTorah 4:13</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I maintain that it is not proper for a person to stroll in the Pardes\n  unless he has filled his belly with bread and meat. \"Bread and meat\"\n  refer to the knowledge of what is permitted and what is forbidden, and\n  similar matters concerning other mitzvot.

This practice is codified in the Shulchan\n  Aruch as an obligation at the time of prayer, and as something that\n  one \"should do\" at other times.

How do I balance learning <em>Tanach</em>, <em>Gemara</em>, developing a deep ideological/meta-halacha understanding, learning the practical halachot from <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Now with a deep desire to grow \nI'm wondering which areas to focus on? What is the general guiding philosophy we have for directing Torah learning. </p>\n\n<p>I'm not talking about which Yeshiva to go to – rather how to learn independently. </p>\n\n<p>I'm right now 16 and have been going to a modern orthodox Yeshiva my entire life – just to give you an idea of my background. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>The Way of Torah</em> from the Ramchal may be a good place to start for guidance in the Yam HaTalmud.  I believe the Maharal supported the method outlined by the Mishna in Avos (Perek 5, Mishna 25 in most editions) that one should spend 5 years just on Mishna and then move to Gemara.  </p>\n\n<p>Today, that method is probably not practical and we see the Cheder/Yeshiva world has boys learning Gemara pretty much right away. But a strong foundation in Mishna will go a long way to help understand Gemara as the Amoraim discuss the Mishna and clarify its meaning.  </p>\n\n<p>Learning Mishna with the Rav and the Tosfos Yom Tov will greatly enhance your ability to learn Gemara.  The Alcalay dictionary is excellent to build vocabulary, if you can afford it!</p>\n\n<p>The Artscroll Tanach series give a terrific selection of commentaries in English and provide pretty good depth - I like to use them as a starting point and then look up the original sources.  You will have <strong>plenty</strong> to look at!  There are Tanach Yomi schedules if you are interested in covering ground more rapidly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm uncertain that there is a specific path per-se that might be considered a \"standard\" that works for everyone. I'm going with the general foundation that the purpose of learning Torah is so that you can perform.</p>\n\n<p>Within all this, I think that it is important to perform mitzvot correctly. I went to a modern yeshiva through high school. Granted, the style and emphasis that I had in the 60's - 80's is significantly different from what I see now. My elementary shcool emphasized speaking and understandig Hebrew. Thus, long before Art Scroll existed, we all learned to understand Chumash and Gemarah in the original with understanding Rash\"i. I think that developing this level of understanding is a critical foundation to learning and developing knowledge. Art Scroll ENglish, sadly, has become a \"crutch\" for so many, that, sadly, it's like jumping directly into the \"Monarch Notes\" of Gemarah without appreciating the fine nuances of the original language and arguments.</p>\n\n<p>So, in short, I would suggest that if your Hebrew reading and understanding is weak, make this your top priority. I'm not talking about \"Modern / Israeli\" Hebrew, but understanding Biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew. If you can add a basic understanding of Aramaic as used in the Gemarah, that's also important, though, for many things, you can rely on Rash\"i or some other commentary to translate many things.</p>\n\n<p>The way all this relates to what I said about mitzvah performance, is that as you now, there are numerous opinions regarding so many mitzvot. Many people concoct chumrot that don't need to be there. Either that, or they develop a dislike towards others that don't follow their own strict rule. Often, this is because they have become \"robots\" thinking that mitzvot have only one path, because they never bothered to read and study the other options. If you have a good knowledge of Hebrew and spend effort to viewing or listening to other opinions, you can keep you mind open to these ideas and better decide for yourself which path you want to take. But it will emanate from your own knowledge and effort, not because of something rote that someone else dictated and you never understood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe ZT'L reccommended a daily study plan for all jews to cover all the basics of Torah Study called <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4158201/jewish/The-Chitas-Study-Cycles-Instituted-by-the-Rebbe-Rayatz-Chumash-Tehillim-Tanya.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chitas</a>.

    "content": "# Does Rabbinic Literature misunderstand the infinitive absolute?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The infinitive absolute is a conjugation classified generally by a qametz under the first consonant, and a holem or holem - vav by the second. According to the Cambridge Introduction to Biblical Hebrew: </p>\n\n<p>\"A slight majority of infinite absolutes occur with a finite verb of the same root. These are called paronomastic. This construction usually heightens the verb's mood, i.e., its degree of reality, expressing certainty of emphasizing non - real mood. It can often be translated with adverbs such as <em>surely, certainly, or clearly.</em> </p>\n\n<p>שתו תשתו </p>\n\n<p>\"You <em>surely ought</em> to drink - Jer 25:28\n\"</p>\n\n<p>By this, then, it seems that the infinitive absolute is not superflous in the way it is commonly used, because it is serving a specific function, and the meaning of any verse would be slightly different without it. </p>\n\n<p>However, many times in Rabbinic Literature, it is often seen as a redundancy, and expositions are made from that assumption: </p>\n\n<p>\"The double expression, <em>die, you shall die</em> (מות תמות) implies: death for Adam and deat for Eve, and by extension death for Adam and death for his offspring\" - Bereshit Rabbah 16:6 </p>\n\n<p>\"The verse concludes: <em>eat, you may eat</em> (אכל תאכל). R' Yaakov if Kfar Chanin said: With the double expression God was saying: When does an animal become fit for consumption? Once it is slaughtered. God was thereby hinting to Adam regarding the prohibition against eating a limb from a torn animal.\" - Bereshit Rabbah 16:6 </p>\n\n<p>\"<em>Rather, you shall surely bury him.</em> This indicates that the post must be buried alongside the convict, and the post must be something that lacks only burial.\" - Sanhedrin 46b </p>\n\n<p>So, does Rabbinic Literature misunderstand the infinitive absolute, by seeing it as a redundancy, when it is in fact significant to the meaning of the verse, or am I misunderstanding something about their method of exegesis? Is there any other way to convey the idea of  \"certainty\" in Hebrew that wouldn't be seen as redundant? Are they holding two explanations, one being the simple meaning of the verse, and then holding that the word also has a deeper meaning, etc.? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>does Rabbinic Literature misunderstand the infinitive absolute, by seeing it as a redundancy...? </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I don't think it's possible to speak for all of rabbinic literature, but) I believe there is ample evidence of non failure to recognize <em>a</em> function of the infinitive absolute, if not <em>the</em> one described in the quotation. Take for example the string of extrapolations from infinitive absolutes in <em>Baba M'tzi'a</em> 31a/b (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.31a?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow\">starting about half way down</a>), e.g.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>החזירה וברחה החזירה וברחה [וכו']: א\"ל ההוא מדרבנן לרבא, \"אימא 'השב' - חדא זמנא; 'תשיבם' - תרי זמני.\" א\"ל \"'השב' - אפי' ק' פעמים משמע; 'תשיבם' - אין לי '\"אלא לביתו. לגינתו ולחורבתו מנין? ת\"ל 'תשיבם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The infinitive is understood to not be bound by qualifications such as time and quantity - and thereby extend the obligation from a one-time occurrence to one that shall be repeated as necessary to get the job done. Rava's inference is internal to the infinitive itself and independent of the finite verb attending it. Indeed he is rebutting an anonymous person suspecting that appears to be treating the finite verb as a redundancy.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Is there any other way to convey the idea of \"certainty\" in Hebrew that wouldn't be seen as redundant?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sure there are! There are particles of affirmation like \"<em>hinei</em>\" and (rarely) \"<em>ken</em>\", as well as question-like structures that have the same effect.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Are they holding two explanations, one being the simple meaning of the verse, and then holding that the word also has a deeper meaning, etc.?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the next page of the <em>g'mara</em> above there may be a debate over this exact point when, for some of the <em>p'sukim</em> in question (and only those according to Maharsh\"a), the rationale of \"The Torah speaks like people do\" is proposed to explain this pattern. This argument, which I believe is only partially resolved by the end of the <em>g'mara</em>, is akin to not demanding an explanation beyond \"the simple meaning of the verse\". It entails a recognition that this phrasing is just the way to express the idea of the <em>pasuk</em>, <em>despite</em> the presence of the infinitive.</p>\n\n<p>This <em>g'mara</em> is but one snippet that contains several examples of infinitive absolutes being interpreted as they are. Is it possible that these or other <em>tana'im</em>, <em>amora'im</em>, etc. held of this pattern's ability to \"heighten the verb's. . .degree of reality\" like the quoted introductory text does? Perhaps. Were they broadly and fundamentally missing out on the meaning of infinitives? I do not believe so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The mood of a verse is not the concern of the book of G-D. The use of such a linguistic function in the Torah must mean something eternally important, or it would not have been added. Sometimes, the redundancy can teach something important through its common meaning, i.e. stressing a concept. Usually, however, stressing the concept is not of utmost importance, and therefore cannot be the primary reason for the repetition.</p>\n\n\n",

So, he ground the wheat for the Jew on the 7th day of Passover and made it into Chametz bread for him. Right after the holiday, he gave the Jew \"fresh baked\" bread. Since it was the Jew's wheat and it became Chametz on Passover, can the Jew benefit from the bread or eat it now after the holiday?</p>\n\n<p>One opinion (a posek named \"Beis Hillel) is that it may be sold but shouldn't be eaten. </p>\n\n<p>But, the Beis Meir holds that although accidental ownership of Chametz on Passover is forbidden, not all accidents are the same! Since the event of the Gentile deciding to make it into Chametz on Passover and deliver it to the Jew is so far fetched, no one could be required to think of this happening. Therefore, the Rabbis never penalized cases like this one. So the Jew may eat the bread without reservation. (This is true even though there was no bitul!)</p>\n\n<p>So too, the OP's case is so strange and unforeseeable, that no one should be penalized to \"be more careful\" to find out that every Gentile is really not a long lost Jew! Furthermore it is a case of extremely great loss as 200 households would suffer financial loss and inconvenience! (they all also presumably made a valid bitul before the holiday.) It is also a famous general rule throughout Gemara and poskim that \"Milsa d'lo shechichah, lo gazru bei Rabbanan\". The Rabbis did not enact decrees upon far-fetched, unlikely cases.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, although Chametz is usually forbidden for benefit even due to accident or onus; the case of the OP would seem to be permitted in that the 200 households may at least sell the Chametz or even eat it themselves due to all of the above exceptions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It would have the status of <em>chametz she'avar alav hapesach</em> and it would be forbidden to derive any benefit from it. Whether the sale was conditioned on his being an actual gentile or not, the <em>chametz</em> was definitely owned by a Jew and any further sale would accomplish nothing in terms of it's already forbidden status.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Deuteronomy 6:7 and 8:10 - Why are the words pronounced \"Milra\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm relaying this question from my shul's chazzan to me, who is a Torah reader. I'm stumped...</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 8:10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְאָכַלְתָּ֖</strong> וְשָׂבָ֑עְתָּ <strong>וּבֵֽרַכְתָּ֙</strong> אֶת־יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ\nעַל־הָאָ֥רֶץ הַטֹּבָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָֽתַן־לָֽךְ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As you can see from the position of the trope notes, the 2 bolded words are pronounced on the final syllable - <em>milra</em>. My chazzan asks why is this so, when these two words are really accented on the 2nd syllable when spoken in Ashkenazi conversational Hebrew.</p>\n<p>E.g. you say, \"a-CHAL-ta\" and \"Be-RACH-ta\".</p>\n<p>Another example is Deuteronomy 6:7:</p>\n<p>וְשִׁנַּנְתָּ֣ם לְבָנֶ֔יךָ <strong>וְדִבַּרְתָּ֖</strong> בָּ֑ם בְּשִׁבְתְּךָ֤ בְּבֵיתֶ֙ךָ֙ וּבְלֶכְתְּךָ֣ בַדֶּ֔רֶךְ וּֽבְשָׁכְבְּךָ֖ וּבְקוּמֶֽךָ</p>\n<p>Is the conversational pronunciation incorrect, or is there a different ruling to the accent when there a vav hahipuch (vav that converts the verb tense?)</p>\n<p>(The above is one of many examples, where we see this. So, your answer need not focus on just this example. BTW, in the 2nd example, the chazzan stated that since בָּ֑ם is a single syllable verb, the accent on the previous word should have a nasog achor, and move back 1 syllable, which it doesn't, here. )</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Indeed it has to do with the \"Vav HaHippukh\" (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waw-consecutive\" rel=\"nofollow\">waw-consecutive</a>). Were those words pronounced Mil'eil, they would be in past tense (eg. Lev 10:19 , Hos 12:11) instead of the future tense. Thus, changing the accent is actually a correctable reading mistake.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I can confirm what two people have already answered, that it's because the words ואכלת ,וברכת are not past tense (and you have eaten) but are in the imperative tense (you shall eat) and are made so by the vav hahippuch prefixing them. This was pointed out to us in relation to the first word וְאָ֣הַבְתָּ֔ of Deuteronomy 6:5 (familiar to us from the K'riat Sh'ma) by Rabbi Dr Meshulam (AKA Fred) Klarberg, my high school Hebrew-language teacher in the late 60s (who later became a professor of linguistics at Victoria University). He was one of the foremost world-experts in Hebrew grammar (and possibly still is, but he is in his dotage now.) He knew not only the traditionally accepted biblical grammar system taught nowadays, but also the competing ones by other traditional authorities. His weekly column \"Morsels of Hebrew grammar\" that he started after making aliya circa 2000, and which were later compiled into a published book, can still be found online. He taught us that if, when reciting the sh'ma, you read the word וְאָ֣הַבְתָּ֔ with its colloquial mileil accentuation, as many do, you are giving it the wrong meaning (and you have loved) instead of the correct meaning, \"you shall love.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is Mishnah berurah comprised of?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is Mishnah berurah comprised of in regards to table of contents? I understand it is typically a six volume book, but how many chapters and pages? Also, what are Simanim, seifim, and Helek?</p>\n\n<p>I am newly religious and my Hebrew is way behind.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Okay, let's rewind a bit!</p>\n\n<p>In the mid-1500s, Rabbi Yosef Karo compiled a work called <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, his version of a code of Jewish law. (Well he was working on an earlier framework, but that's even more complicated ...) One volume deals with civil law, another marital law; the volume under discussion now is called <em>Orach Chaim</em> (path of life). It addresses the daily routine, and things involving time. It starts with waking up in the morning, daily prayers, continues to the laws of blessings before/after eating, and so on, until the laws of going to bed at night; then gets into Shabbos and the holidays.</p>\n\n<p>It's divided into <em>simanim</em>, chapters, and <em>se'ifim</em> (literally, \"branches\"), sub-sections. </p>\n\n<p>For example, <em>Siman</em> 47 is about the blessings said before studying Torah. (It's a relatively low-numbered Siman as that happens daily, near the start of your day.) <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14170&st=&pgnum=150\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Siman</em> 47, <em>Se'if</em> 3</a> (often written 47.3 or 47:3) discusses whether it applies to <em>writing</em> Torah or just saying it.</p>\n\n<p>Okay that wasn't complicated enough ...</p>\n\n<p>Around a hundred years ago, a rabbi better known as <em>Chafetz Chaim</em> decided to write several extensive commentaries on the <em>Orach Chaim</em> portion of <em>Shulchan Aruch.</em>, summarizing a great deal of earlier glosses on the material. That's what we call <em>Mishna Brurah</em>. You will therefore hear someone referencing <em>Mishna Brurah</em> on, say, what if you forgot the extra prayers for Rosh Chodesh? Or how to shake a lulav? Or how to keep food warm on Shabbos? You will not find <em>Mishna Brurah</em> discussing who can serve as a witness at a Jewish wedding; what forms of rental agreements constitute prohibited usury; what happens if you stirred a meat pot with a dairy spoon; or when I'm allowed to keep cash I find in the street. All of those subjects aren't in <em>Orach Chaim.</em></p>\n\n<p>So if someone says \"I'm studying Mishna Brurah!\", what they mean is: I will first see what <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> says on the subject, then look down and read the commentaries/glosses on it. Which is complicated, and confusing.</p>\n\n<p>Also, there is so much commentary that it's not always practical to print one giant book containing all of <em>Orach Chaim</em>. As you said, it's often available as a six-volume set. The first volume (or <em>chelek</em>) covers the first bunch of <em>simanim</em> in <em>Orach Chaim</em>, waking up, morning prayers, and the like; the last volume gets to the holidays. </p>\n\n<p>As others have said, it's a lengthy and complex work, really not suited for novices. (Many feel it's complicated enough it doesn't even belong in a yeshiva high school curriculum.) There are other works with a single voice that can be better options.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mishna Brurah is actually a commentary on the Shulchan Aruch, the Jewish code of law written by Rabbi Yisrael Meir Kagan (Poland, 1838–1933), also known as the Chofetz Chaim </p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah is an explanation on the 1st volume known as \"Orach Chaim\" which discusses laws common to daily ways of life such as prayer, tallit, tefillin, Shabbat and holiday observances.</p>\n\n<p>A chelek is a volume - there are 6 in total\nA Siman is a chapter - 697 in total\nA se'if is a paragraph within a chapter. The beginning of each siman, will have a title telling you what it is about and it will tell you how manay se'ifim there are.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam rose to argue with him and refute his proofs on\n  the eternity of the world, and to demonstrate that Aristotle has no\n  proof on this, until just the opposite - one can prove the creation.\n  However, the author here, of blessed memory, sifted the truth from the\n  words of the philosophers, and added strength and pure hands to revive\n  the proofs for creation and to mend their breaches, and automatically\n  the existence of G-d will be demonstrated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>the commentaries there explain:</p>\n\n<p>Manoach Halevavos: \"bamuskal rishon\".</p>\n\n<p>Marpe Lenefesh \"davar ze hu barur u'muskal\"</p>\n\n<p>Pas Lechem: \"bemuskal rishon kemo shemevaer\"</p>\n\n<p>Hence, the consensus seems to be that it is \"muskal rishon\" - self-evident.

Does anyone know more to the story? What was the psak? Who disagreed? What was the result?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet-Rothkoff has a lecture on YUTorah about Artificial Insemination that discusses it.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein ruled that the Torah prohibition of adultery, and the resulting categorization of the resulting child as <em>mamzer</em>, are only incurred via conventional relations: artificial insemination and in-vitro fertilization are not included. Thus, if a married Jewish man has fertility issues, his wife may be artificially inseminated by some other male donor.</p>\n<p>(A similar <em>psak</em> had previously been published by R' Shlomo Zalman Auerbach in the Israeli journal <em>Noam</em>, but that was dismissed as a relatively left-wing publication.)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, Grand Rabbi of Satmar, vehemently disagreed. He insisted that any product of a Jewish married woman and another man's sperm constituted adultery, and the offspring would be a <em>mamzer.</em> In his viewpoint, then, Feinstein was allowing adultery and causing more <em>mamzerim</em> to come into the world. Critics of Teitelbaum will point to his hangups concerning sexual matters, which certainly didn't help the situation.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein's family, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14679&pgnum=32\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in the preface to <em>Igros Moshe</em> Volume 8</a>, point to political causes as well: While Rav Moshe was not exactly a card-carrying Zionist, he was involved with Agudas Israel in both the US and Israel, which granted some legitimacy to the State of Israel as it sought to engage it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבנו נתמנה אז נם לעטוד בראש אנודת ישראל בארצות הברית. הוא היה יושב ראש הנשיאות שלה,\nויושב ראש מועצת גדולי התורה. בשנת תשכ״ד, בא לארץ ישראל לכבוד הכנםיה הגדולה של אנודת ישראל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בגלל עמדת האנודה לנבי ארץ ישראל וההתננדות חחריפח של חסידות םאטמר לעמדה זו, הוהלט אצלם\nלתקוף את רבנו ופםקיו(כך ספרו לרבנו אנשי נטורי קרתא בירושלים כאשר היה שם בשנת תשכ״ח. כמטרה\nלהתקפה זו נבהרו תשובותיו בעניין הזרעה מלאכותית ושיעור מהיצה של עזרת נשים. מתלוקת זו שלא היתד,\nלאמיתה של תורה נרמה לרבנו ענמת נפש מרובה. התקפות אלה לא היו רק באמצעות מאמרים ותשובות,\nאלא נם בהתקפות אישיות תירופים ונידופים, מעשי אלימות, איומי פצצות, הטרדות טלפוניות ושריפת ספריו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our Teacher [Rabbi Feinstein] was appointed as the head of Agudas Yisrael of America. He held the position as its president, and head of its Council of Torah Sages. In 1964 he came to Israel as an honoree of the grand convention of Agudas Yisrael ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because of the Agudah's stance concerning Israel and the sharp opposition of Satmar to it, it was decided by Satmar to counter Our Teacher and his rulings. (This is what men of <em>Neturei Karta</em> told him when he visited Jerusalem in 1964.) As an excuse for this conflict, they chose his responsa on artificial insemination and what sort of <em>mechitza</em> was needed for the women's section in synagogue. This conflict, which was not for the sake of the truth of Torah, caused Our Teacher a great deal of anguish. These conflicts were not just in the form of statements or responsa, but vicious personal insults, acts of force, threats of injury, troubling phone calls, and burning of his books.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Rabbi Rakeffet also tells of a brick thrown through Rav Moshe's window.)</p>\n<p>Neither Rav Moshe nor the Satmar ever backed down from their respective halachic stances on the subject; I don't know off-hand exactly when or why the attacks subsided.</p>\n<p>(See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20022&pgnum=127\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bnei Banim #34</a> concerning honorific titles about a scholar who supports bricks thrown through his opponents' windows.)</p>\n\n\n",

Siman 167 has a nice explanation of this.</p>\n\n<p>He starts by pointing out that the word \"hamotzi\" is the preferred word for the blessing, even though the word \"motzi\" would suffice, because \"hamotzi\" implies both past and future tense (Berachos 38a). The intent, he says, is both on this bread which came out of the ground, and on the bread that Hashem will bring out of the ground.</p>\n\n<p>He points out that ha'adama means any ground, whereas ha'aretz is a double entendre - it can mean \"the land\" or it can be a reference to the Land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud says that in the future, the Land of Israel is going to produce fully processed, finished loaves of bread, straight from the ground (Shabbos 30b). Therefore, the blessing on bread was formulated to accommodate this future reality as well. It means that Hashem brings bread forth from the ground, but it also means that He will bring out bread from the Land of Israel, fully formed loaves.</p>\n\n<p>(I skipped one step for simplicity's sake, but you could see it <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x792\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>[Re-posted from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/43968/4794\">here</a>]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16325#v=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Psalms 104.14</a> it is written \"Lehotzi lechem min ha'aretz\" צְמִיחַ חָצִיר, לַבְּהֵמָה,    וְעֵשֶׂב, לַעֲבֹדַת הָאָדָם;\nלְהוֹצִיא לֶחֶם, מִן-הָאָרֶץ.

The Talmud, in discussing the blessing for olive oil, states the following (with the key line bolded):</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=35b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 35b</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חוץ מן היין וכו': מאי שנא יין אילימא משום דאשתני לעלויא אשתני לברכה\n  והרי שמן דאשתני לעלויא ולא אשתני לברכה דאמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל וכן א\"ר\n  יצחק א\"ר יוחנן שמן זית מברכין עליו בפה\"ע אמרי התם משום דלא אפשר היכי\n  נבריך <strong>נבריך בורא פרי הזית פירא גופיה זית אקרי</strong> ונבריך עליה בורא פרי\n  עץ זית</p>\n  \n  <p>EXCEPT OVER WINE. Why is a difference made for wine? Shall I say that\n  because [the raw material of] it is improved therefore the blessing is\n  different? But in the case of oil also [the raw material of] it is\n  improved, yet the blessing is not different, as Rab Judah has laid\n  down in the name of Samuel, and so R. Isaac stated in the name of R.\n  Johanan,that the blessing said over olive oil is ‘that createst the\n  fruit of the tree’? — The answer given is that in the case of oil it\n  is not possible to change the blessing. For what shall we say? <strong>Shall\n  we say, ‘That createst the fruit of the olive’? The fruit itself is\n  called olive!</strong> But we can say over it, ‘That createst the fruit of\n  the olive tree’? (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/pdf/zeraim/Berachoth.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Soncino translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains the bolded line as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זית אקרי. והוה ליה בורא פרי הפרי שהפרי קרוי זית ואין זו בריאת שמים כי\n  בידי אדם היא בריאה זו אבל גבי גפן הגפן היא העץ והענבים הם פרי הגפן</p>\n  \n  <p>Is called \"olive\". And it would be [saying] \"who created the fruit of\n  the fruit\", for the fruit is called \"olive\" and this [the fruit of the\n  fruit, namely, olive oil] is not a creation of heaven – this creation\n  is in the hands of man. Whereas by gefen, the gefen is the tree and\n  the grapes are the fruit of the gefen tree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi is thus explaining the Talmud as follows: we cannot say \"who created the fruit of the zayit\" on olive oil because \"zayit\" does not refer to the tree, but to the olive itself. \"The fruit of the zayit\" therefore would be referring to the olive oil, and we cannot say that God created this because in fact olive oil is created by man. This is in contrast to wine where \"gefen\" is the name of the tree (i.e. the grapevine) and therefore saying \"who created the fruit of the gefen\" is fine because the fruit of the gefen is the  grape which is created by God. It is only the wine itself which is created by man.</p>\n\n<p>This is spelled out even more clearly by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%99_%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yaakov Tzvi Yalish</a> in his comments to the above Rashi:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Melo Haroim Berachot 35b</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והפרי של הזית הוא השמן וזהו נעשה ע\"י אדם שסוחט הזיתים ועשען שמן</p>\n  \n  <p>The fruit of the olive is the oil, and this is made by man who\n  squeezes the olives and makes them [into] oil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question is now much stronger. According to the above sources the Talmud is clearly stating that one cannot describe God as the cause of something that man does himself. Therefore, just like we cannot say that God created wine or oil because those are actually the result of a human process, it should be impossible to say that God brings forth bread when in fact it is a human process that transforms wheat into bread.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_Loew_ben_Bezalel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Judah Loewe</a> asks this very question:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Netivot Olam Netiv Ha'avodah Chapter 17</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד קשה שאמר המוציא לחם מן הארץ והרי לא יצא הלחם מן הארץ כי לא היה\n  לחם כי אם על ידי האדם שאפאו</p>\n  \n  <p>A further question is that it says \"who brings forth bread from the\n  ground\", yet the bread does not come from the ground – bread only\n  comes via man who bakes it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He cites several verses to show that \"lechem\" does not refer simply to the finished product of bread, but to  anything that satiates the heart. Since wheat is brought forth from the ground by God, and wheat can be termed \"lechem\" due to its satiating qualities, it is correct to say that God brings forth lechem from the ground. We only make the blessing on actual bread because bread is the complete satiation, but the blessing is referencing the main part which is that God brought forth the wheat:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובמדרש אמר רבי יצחק בתורה בנביאים ובכתובים מצינו דהדא פתא מזוניתא דלבא\n  בתורה ואקחה פת לחם וסעדו לבכם בנביאים סעד לבך פת לחם בכתובים ולחם לבב\n  אנוש יסעד וביאור זה כי הלחם הוא חיותו של אדם ולכך שם לחם שייך על דבר\n  שהוא נותן היות לבריות ולכך אמר הכתוב גם כן נותן להם לכל בשר ולשון לכל\n  בשר משמע אף בהמה והרי אין הבהמה והעוף אוכלים לחם הנאפה אלא כי פירוש\n  לחם דבר הסועד את הלב וכל דבר שהוא פרנסה של בעלי חיים נקרא לחם רק מפני\n  כי הלחם הנאפה הוא סועד יותר כי לב האדם צריך סעד יותר ולכך אין מברכין\n  המוציא לחם רק על לחם הנאפה שהוא מיוחד אל האדם שהוא סועד לב האדם ומ\"מ\n  אף קודם שנאפה הוא סעדא דליבא רק שאינו כל כך סועד הלב כמו הלחם הנאפה\n  וכאשר נעשה לחם על ידי אפיה אז הוא סועד הלב לגמרי וכי בשביל שהאדם הוא\n  חורש וזורע ומשקה האדמה וממרח לא יברך על הפרי שהש\"י בירך אותו זה אינו\n  רק כי עיקר הדבר מתיחס אל הש\"י והאדם הוא עושה הכנה בלבד אבל מכל מקום\n  הש\"י הוציא מן הארץ דבר שהוא סועד הלב ולכך יש לו לברך המוציא לחם מן\n  הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He also offers another answer, which is that God really does bring forth bread from the ground. However, in our current state under the curse of Adam we have to do the work of making the wheat into bread. In the Messianic Era, though, the bread will come directly out of the ground. Since God does inherently bring forth bread out of the ground, and it is only due to our sins that we do not have it this way currently, it is still proper to bless God for bringing bread forth from the ground:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובגמרא בפרק במה מדליקין יתיב ר\"ג וקא דריש עתידה ארץ ישראל שתוציא\n  גלוסקאות וכלי מילת שנאמר יהי פסת בר בארץ לגלג עליו אותו תלמיד ואמר אין\n  כל חדש תחת השמש נפק אחוי ליה כמיהין ופטריות ורצה לומר לעתיד כאשר לא\n  יהיה עוד קללת האדמה שהיה בשביל חטא האדם אז תקבל האדמה השפע מן הש\"י\n  בשלימות הגמור והכל יהיה יוצא בשלימות עד שלא יהיה צריך שום תיקון ולפיכך\n  תוציא הארץ גלוסקאות וכלי מילת ועתה האדמה שנתקללה מן הש\"י בשביל חטא\n  האדם אינה מוכנת לקבל הברכה העליונה אבל לעתיד שתפסק הקללה מן העולם אז\n  תהיה הארץ מוציאה הכל בלי חסרון כלל ומפני כי מצד הש\"י אשר הוא משפיע\n  בודאי הש\"י מוציא להם מן הארץ רק שקללת הארץ גורם עד שצריך תיקון כדכתיב\n  בזעת אפיך תאכל לחם ואין מה שטורח ועושה רק מה שגרם חטא שלו ובודאי אם לא\n  הוציא דבר שהוא סועד הלב א\"כ היה הלחם בריאה אחרת אבל בודאי הש\"י הוציא\n  מן הארץ לחם כי גם דבר שיצא מן הארץ הוא סעד הלב רק שקללתו גרם שצריך\n  להיות לו טורח ויגיעה עד שהוא סועד הלב לגמרי ולכך יש לברך המוציא לחם מן\n  הארץ ובגמרא בפרק במה מדליקין יתיב ר\"ג וקא דריש עתידה ארץ ישראל שתוציא\n  גלוסקאות וכלי מילת שנאמר יהי פסת בר בארץ לגלג עליו אותו תלמיד ואמר אין\n  כל חדש תחת השמש נפק אחוי ליה כמיהין ופטריות ורצה לומר לעתיד כאשר לא\n  יהיה עוד קללת האדמה שהיה בשביל חטא האדם אז תקבל האדמה השפע מן הש\"י\n  בשלימות הגמור והכל יהיה יוצא בשלימות עד שלא יהיה צריך שום תיקון ולפיכך\n  תוציא הארץ גלוסקאות וכלי מילת ועתה האדמה שנתקללה מן הש\"י בשביל חטא\n  האדם אינה מוכנת לקבל הברכה העליונה אבל לעתיד שתפסק הקללה מן העולם אז\n  תהיה הארץ מוציאה הכל בלי חסרון כלל ומפני כי מצד הש\"י אשר הוא משפיע\n  בודאי הש\"י מוציא להם מן הארץ רק שקללת הארץ גורם עד שצריך תיקון כדכתיב\n  בזעת אפיך תאכל לחם ואין מה שטורח ועושה רק מה שגרם חטא שלו ובודאי אם לא\n  הוציא דבר שהוא סועד הלב א\"כ היה הלחם בריאה אחרת אבל בודאי הש\"י הוציא\n  מן הארץ לחם כי גם דבר שיצא מן הארץ הוא סעד הלב רק שקללתו גרם שצריך\n  להיות לו טורח ויגיעה עד שהוא סועד הלב לגמרי ולכך יש לברך המוציא לחם מן\n  הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This second answer is also alluded to by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sirkis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

    "content": "# What does a kefula look like?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen <a href=\"http://shulchanaruchharav.com/Home-Database/docs/Pesach%20Checklist.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">discussion</a> of the need to check matzah for kefulos--particular types of folds (Mishnah Berurah 461:35)--before Pesach. However, I'm having trouble finding a good guide to what a kefula in matzah actually looks like. </p>\n\n<p>Could someone please provide a picture, or else a clear discussion, of which types of folds are kefulos and which are not? What would a kefula look like--in machine-made matzah? In handmade matzah?</p>\n\n<p>Separately, is there any reason to suppose that certain hechshers nowadays might obviate the need for this checking?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/practical-aspects-of-matzoh-baking/\">Kefula means \"doubled over.\"</a> We have the same root word used in the morning bracha \"zokef kefufim\" (He straightens those who are bent over), or in upcoming Daf Yomi, \"<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/kidushin/halachah/kd-hl-060.htm\">tenai kaful</a>\" (a legal stipulation where both possibilities are spelled out, if x then y, but if not x then z). </p>\n\n<p>Then there's <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/practical-aspects-of-matzoh-baking/\">nefucha (swelled matzah)</a>, typically <a href=\"http://www.torahdownloads.com/shiur-19836.html\">a bubble</a>, similar in appearance to a bubble in a slice of pizza. (Another commenter here seems to have reversed the meaning of the terms.)</p>\n\n<p>A kefula, according to all opinions, will involve the bending of the matzah over itself, either at the edge or in the middle. I believe most hold that there must simply be ANY spot that has two layers of what was previously rolled out dough. </p>\n\n<p>The worries are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kefula: the dough ends up too thick to bake through properly, only a fully rolled-out dough is safe</li>\n<li>nefucha: the air space insulates one or both inside edge of the dough within the bubble, and may allow it to remain raw</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These were more problematic with the traditonal matza still used in some Sephardic communities. It looks like a laffa (or a pita), and can be quite thick and soft. The typical Ashkenazic matzah is so thin, and baked at such a high temperature, that there's really very little worry. However, since the kefula/nefucha rules are on the books, we still look for them. They don't make the matza chometz (unless you see that it really is improperly baked!), but we don't eat the kefula/nefucha area. Just break it off and toss it.</p>\n\n<p>A discussion can be found in Orach Chaim 461, see in particular Mishna Berura 34 there.</p>\n\n<p>Practical application of kefula, as seen in hand matza factories: At its most extreme, you would have a \"taco\" shape, with at least part of the two sides touching, but I've never actually seen that. More commonly, you have a small fold at the edge, either completely folded over, or a \"roll\" (a thin cylinder of airspace, with the edge of the matzah touching a spot perhaps 1/4 of an inch in from the new rolled edge). Sometimes you may also see a Z pattern in the middle, which is a double crease. All of these cases typically happen either in the final rolling of the dough as it is kneaded, or as the matzah dough is being placed in the over (it goes in hanging on both sides of a stave; the stave is then rolled to reflatten the matzah on the floor of the oven, and an error may result in a crease or in the edge not quite flattening out again). If the fold occurred during the kneading and rolling process, and the bend was subsequently \"rolled out flat,\" but its outline still remains, it is OFTEN OK, if it is determined that it is \"integrated\" and not thicker than standard. </p>\n\n<p>Practical applications of nefucha: Generally an air bubble. </p>\n\n<p>The kefula can also have a nefucha aspect, if the airspace remains, as in teh \"cylinder\" example I gave above.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial matza bakeries have a hechsher. The certifying agencies all do not permit fefula/nefucha to be sold. The bakeries are supposed to check every matza for these problems, break  them off, toss out the broken off piece, and sell the remainder as \"sh'varim\" (broken matza that is less valuable, because it cannot be used in certain rituals). In practice, I have seen a few kefula matzos in my order every year, maybe one in 3%-4%. I have seen only one or two bubbles in the last few years, but I found two interesting cases this year. In one, there were two adjacent spots, with a pair of sharp relief concave circles in the matza that were lighter in color. In the other, along the edge, there was a 2-inch spot that was \"stepped down,\" and also a lighter color. It seemed pretty obvious that a burnt surface had disintegrated after baking, or barely possible that they disintegrated in the oven after most of the baking had completed for these two matzos. I showed my rabbi, and he agreed that there were probably two \"lost\" nefuchos that disintegrated after baking, and the areas should be broken off and discarded..</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Kefula as is mentioned by the other answer, is a doubled over fold. You won't see these folds in store bought matzah as some of the comments have mentioned, because the ones that are baking look out for these folds and tend remove such matzot before sending the boxes out. Basically what happens is when one is placing the dough in the oven to be cooked, part of the dough ends up flopping over part of itself, like in the image below.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5pnm0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5pnm0.jpg\" alt=\"Wet dough, rolled out flat, partially folded over on itself\"></a></p>\n\n<p>i understand that this picture has a fold on purpose, and that it isn't matzah, but this should give you a good visual representation for what is being discussed.</p>\n\n<p>The real question is nefucha, which is commonly referred to as an air bubble, however i don't believe this is true. Nefucha is not prohibited by Yosef Caro in the Shulchan Arukh, but is prohibited by the Rema. But most people only quote the first part of what the Rema says, and conveniently leave out the words that immediately follow.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Shulchan Arukh 461:5</p>\n  \n  <p>אם אפו חמץ עם מצה, לא נאסרה אלא אם כן נגעה בחמץ, ונוטל ממקום שנגעה כדי\n  נטילת מקום והשאר מתר</p>\n  \n  <p>מצה נפוחה באמצעיתה אסורה, אבל אם עלה עליה קרום כדרך שעולה על הפת בשעת\n  אפיה, מתרת </p>\n  \n  <p>If hametz was cooked with matzo, [the matzo] is not forbidden unless\n  it touched the hametz, and one must remove from the place of contact\n  to remove that spot, but the rest is permitted. Rem\"a:...Matzo that is\n  swollen in the middle is forbidden. <strong>If the upper skin rose like it\n  does with bread during baking, it is permitted.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So clearly the Rema is speaking about a swelling in the middle that is forbidden, but he clearly states this swelling is NOT air bubbles, or any type of rising that is normal to the bread process. Unfortunately, despite the Rema's clear words, in the past 200 years most Ashkenazim rule that a nefucha is an air bubble. But if the Rema isn't prohibiting air bubbles, then what is he prohibiting? There was an incident regarding this issue that happened a few hundred years ago between a traveling rabbi from Jerusalem to a Yemenite community.</p>\n\n<p>Yemenite Rabbi Mansura’s comment on this issue was written into the margin of a Shulhan Arukh with the Pri Hadash commentary.  Here we cite some of what he said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would not have had to write this, were it not for a certain incident\n  that happened.   Namely, in the year 132 (for documents, i.e. 5579 or\n  1819) Rabbi David Nahmias, an emissary from the Holy City, appeared in\n  our holy community and was put up in the home of the notable dayyan\n  and holy man of G-d, my rabbi and teacher Rabbi Joseph Karah, z”l.  </p>\n  \n  <p>When they were setting the table, Rabbi David Nahmias made fun of us\n  and cast doubt on our kashruth, saying that (Heaven forfend) we were\n  eating hametz on Passover, since there were bubbles on the surface of\n  the loaf, and this he said was the puffed up matzah of which Maharil\n  wrote.  Hence he did not want to eat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, Rabbi David Nahmias of Jerusalem refused to eat the Yemenite Jews’ matzah because he thought the matzah which they made fell into the category of matzah which is puffed in the center, and such matzah is forbidden.  Rabbi Nahmias erred in not understanding that Rema’s reference to “ matzah which is puffed in the middle” pertained to thick matzah, since when it is thick it might not be baked through thoroughly.  With Yemenite matzah, however, the law of matzah which is puffed in the middle does not apply since the Yemenite Jews bake extremely thin matzahs, and the bubbly surface on the matzahs which they served were not an indication of it being “matzah which is puffed in the middle.”   Regarding this Rabbi Mansura wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In my humble opinion it seems to me that these words apply to their\n  matzahs, which are one tefah thick … but according to our custom,\n  there is no reason for apprehension, since if you take ten of the\n  matzahs that we bake and pile them one on the other, the stack will\n  still not be one tefah thick.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Mansura criticized the way matzah was baked in the Land of Israel, in contrast to the way it was made in Yemen:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should see our beautiful cool water, and such fast kneading, that\n  even in your land it is not equaled.  It is also baked speedily, in\n  one minute.  Not so in your land, for we have heard complaints that\n  you bake an extremely thick loaf, without hearing the flames of the\n  furnace, and that it remains stuck to the walls of the oven for a long\n  time; hence one suspects that it is way too far away from the fire for\n  it to be baked in the blink of an eye, as our bread is made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moreover, to refute the words of the aforementioned Rabbi David (meaning Rabbi David Nahmias), who boasted of the practice in his land and criticized the matzah-baking custom of Sanaa, it is written in the work of Rabbi Pri Hadash, par. 459, 2, that the practice in the holy city of Jerusalem is not proper, for their dough ferments, and there is no one who properly understands this (see the above reference to the Pri Hadash).</p>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/pesah/gim.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/pesah/gim.html</a></p>\n\n<p>So according to the Rabbis of Yemen, a nefucha is a swelling in the dough that is caused by attempting to cook too thick of a matzah in an oven that's not hot enough to cook the matzah all the way through. Which makes sense since the Rema speaks of a swelling <strong><em>in the middle</em></strong>, which is the last part of the matzah to be cooked as the heat radiates from outside to in, and if your oven isn't hot enough you could end up with a center that isn't cooking and therefore starts to rise.</p>\n\n<p>But despite clearly distinguishing these two ideas, most modern Poskim rule that one has to poke holes in their matzah to prevent air bubbles, which they call nefucha. But either way, in modern matzah that is made with perforations and is cooked incredibly thin and dry, one will never run across a true nefucha, and the perforations usually prevent any air bubbles, so one typically has nothing to worry about when buying packaged matzah that is a hard cracker.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IEwJa.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/IEwJa.jpg\" alt=\"Hand shmura matza, with a fold on the edge\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n4cOx.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/n4cOx.jpg\" alt=\"Hand shmura matza, with a fold on the edge\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pNQeQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/pNQeQ.jpg\" alt=\"Hand shmura matza, with a fold on the edge\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Here are some photos of on that I found on the first day</p>\n\n\n",

The Shulchan Arukh codifies it as well (OC 469). (The Arukh haShulchan (ibid. :4) notes that the Rambam did not codify this rule, and thinks that he omitted it because he thought it only was true according to one opinion in the Talmud (that we don't rule like) that to consecrate an animal as an offering it need not be done \"in the manner of those whose volunteer offerings\".)</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the language, the Magen Avraham there (sk 2) notes that saying בשר זה על פסח instead of לפסח is not a problem.

Litvish</em>) vs. many Central European Jews (<em>eg. Poilisher, Galitzianer, Hungarisher</em>) and is described at length in the article <a href=\"https://dovidkatz.net/dovid/PDFLinguistics/1980.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Wavering Yiddish Segolate</a> (<em>see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segolate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Segolate</a></em>) by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovid_Katz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Professor Dovid Katz</a>.</p>\n<p>A briefer summary of the issue is discussed in the discussion thread <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/g/jewish-languages/c/o7z-Ac4Y1J8?pli=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Segol/tsere in Yiddish and Jewish English</a>.</p>\n<p><em>I'm guessing that either pronunciation of פסח would be problematic when saying \"this meat is for פסח\" as long as the meanings of the two pronunciations are the same. If one happens to personally with intent, differentiate how to pronounce the korban vs. the yom tov then that would be a question for a competent rabbi/posek.</em></p>\n<p><em>Saying בשר זה לפסח is an issue of מראית עין. So a likely factor in the outcome of the this psak will be how observers in that locality will perceive the statement of the person who said it and whether the switch in pronunciation is significant enough to cause a difference in perception of the meaning.</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What kind of seder did a non-oleh l'regel have during the time of the Bais Hamikdash (and for that matter, the entire 40 years in the desert)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Our haggadah did not always exist - it appears to be primarily from the time of the Mishna. Before then, there was a Korban Pesach and specific procedures for organizing family and/or friends to eat it, with matza and maror. It would also seem there was some kind of mention of Yetzias Mizrayim, since that appears to be d'oraisa (v'higadta l'vincha).</p>\n\n<p>Today, we have no aliyas regel, and no korban pesach. We have the mitzva of eating matza and of sipur yetziyas mistrayim. The maror is d'rabanan, and the \"seder\" we have (Kadesh, Urchatz, ..., and especially the lengthy Magid), which is also d'rabanan. Before it existed, there was no mitzva of maror without korban, and the detailed seder we have did not exist.</p>\n\n<p>What happened on the seder night for someone who was not able to bring a korban pesach, in that earlier period? Such a person might have been tomei, an orel (uncircumcised), the father of an orel child, or unable to make it to Jersualem in time (no aliyas regel). Without a korban or a fixed seder, did they just:</p>\n\n<p>1) Make kiddush, 2) make hamotzi and eat matza for the mitzva, 3) mention that Hashem took us out of Egypt, 4) enjoy a festive meal, and 5) good night?</p>\n\n<p>Or was there anything else going on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Really interesting question. The simple answer is that they would do everything except the Korban Pesach. While the Haggadah as we have it did not exist, the framework of the Haggadah is in the Torah. Devarim 6:20-25 (the question of the \"wise son\") - \n\"When your son will ask you, What are these commandments...? Say to your son, We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and Hashem took us out... And he did miracles... to bring us to the land that he swore to our fathers... And he commanded us to do these commandments... to do good for us forever...\"\nAnd there is more in the section on Bikurim in Parshas Ki Savo. The Haggadah basically follows the structure laid out in the Torah. So too is the mitzvah of eating matzah, and some of the other mitzvos (e.g., maror) remain m'derabanon.<br>\nIn many ways, the question is the same as a similar question about our prayers. Until the siddur of Rav Amram Gaon was sent out to the Diaspora, we don't know a fixed language for most of our prayers. Until the Men of the Great Assembly established it, we don't know that there was any fixed language at all for any prayer. Nevertheless, people certainly prayed, and there were certainly guidelines they followed - bless after eating bread, before eating anything, say Hallel on joyous occasions... Past a certain point in history our sages felt that it was necessary to formalize a process that until then was based on individual inspiration.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To answer the question, the discussion really centers around Pesach Sheini.   What exactly does a Jew who is tamei b'zman Pesach to do?  Well, since he can't makriv, the only thing he would do is everything else - maror, matza and maggid (he would do everything as though it was Pesach without a korban Pesach and Chagiga).  On Pesach Sheini, he would offer the korban Pesach, eat it and do marror and maggid again.  He would not eat chometz for the duration of Pesach Sheini, and possibly seven days afterwards.</p>\n\n<p>Maggid is d'oraisa.  Just because the Mishnah outlines what Maggid is supposed to include doesn't mean it didn't exist before hand.  Also, we see that Pesach and Matza are not taloi - meaning on Pesach night you have a mitzvah d'oraissa to eat Matza regardless of your tamei status.</p>\n\n<p>There would be a requirement of 4 cups and haseiba.  The Haggadah as we have it is a conglomeration of various parts that were stiched together and became a standard text.  However, suffice to say, there would certainly be elements to keep children entertained.  If the exact choice of phrase of Mah Nishtana wasn't necessarily part of Maggid, certainly to ask questions would be, specifically by the child, and specifically the four questions in the Torah (the four sons).  There would certainly be narrative of our initial history - we were once idolators, or we were once slaves in Egypt, there would be discussion about the source of that slavery - Bris Bein HaBesarim. Afterwhich - why we were saved from almost total annihilation.  Perhaps a recital of the passages in Parshas Bo - the night of the leaving - so the korban Pesach etc. a mention of the 10 plagues and their culmination at the Yam Suf.</p>\n\n<p>There would certainly be Hallel, if not the Song at the Sea.</p>\n\n<p>If you were to ask me, I would say the Haggadah is more an outline than anything else.  It presents an overview of how we were miraculously taken out with a strong arm and mighty hand by Hashem, together with subtle hints at how we can escape our own exile. The Medrashim abound as to what happened.</p>\n\n<p>The premise of the questioner assumes that since it was de'rabbonon it must have been a decree mandated at some stage in history.  In that case, it follows that before that point it wasn't mandated and hence didn't exist.  This is not true.  We have a Mesorah on how to perform the Pesach seder. I don't imagine that the generation that entered into Eretz Yisrael didn't have 4 cups of wine.  It is certainly feasible to imagine that all the elements and aspects of the Seder they had, as much as we did, perhaps the Nusach would be slightly different, but I can't really imagine why it would be - perhaps the discussion in Bnei Brak would not be included, but rather the conclusion - that tonight is different in that we recount the Exodus that happened this night, and that the Torah says: kol yamei chayeha is a reference to Olam Hazeh and Olam Haba not just days and nights - i.e. why are we recounting the Exodus on this night.</p>\n\n<p>The Haggadah itself recounts how the sages stayed up the whole night recounting the Exodus as something praiseworthy.  Certainly the generation that witnessed the miracles or at least had a first-hand account of the miracles would spend the whole night up listening to the recounting of the Exodus. It would have been the central point in their lives.  Like Holocaust survivors and their children, it would have been on their lips exactly what happened and how Hashem saved them.  Yehoshua ben Nun would have recounted perhaps mostly what happened, just as the Haggadah describes. So while the Haggadah we have today is a stitched together book intended to provide an outline and structure to Maggid, it doesn't negate that what they did before Chazal was very different in terms of Maggid.</p>\n\n<p>I will say this though.  In the times of the Beis Hamikdash there would be no shulchan orech of eggs and soup and fish and chicken!</p>\n\n<p>There may have been a necessity to cut out the beginning of Haggadah -  the discussion in Bnei Brak (which is not so essential), so that there would be enough time to eat the Chagigah and Korban Pesach before Chatzos, after which the discussion would continue - hallel, bentching and the last cup of wine.  There would be no time for anything else, and of course no Afikomen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I'll focus on one element, namely that of the paschal lamb.</p>\n\n<p>There is some evidence to suggest that although the Rabbis of the \"Prushi\" sect who led the move to what we call Halachic Judaism did not condone this behavior, sacrificing a passover lamb outside the temple was commonplace, even at the end of the Second temple period.</p>\n\n<p>Here from the Tosefta in Ohalot:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מעשה בבית דגן ביהודה באחד שמת ערב פסח והלכו לקברו ונכנסו האנשים וקשרו\n  את החבל בגולל משכו האנשים מבחוץ ונכנסו הנשים לקברו והלכו האנשים ועשו\n  פסחיהן לערב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And from the Talmud:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ר' יוסי תודוס איש רומי הנהיג את בני רומי לאכול גדיים מקולסין בלילי\n  פסחים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are other hints in other places in the Talmud and Mishna, but as Chazal did not approve of the process, it is difficult to understand how widespread this custom was.</p>\n\n<p>Going back further to the early second temple period, we know other temples existed as well, such as the one in <a href=\"http://arthistory.wisc.edu/ah505/articles/Rosenberg,_The_Jewish_Temple_at_Elephantine.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elephantine in Egypt</a> and the one at Leontopolis, although we don't have evidence for the slaughtering of specific passover sacrifices. </p>\n\n<p>Going back even further, given that scholars agree that the book of exodus could not have been compiled much previous to the first exile, It's probably pointless to argue the details of the Seder back then.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Judah stated, they used to repeat [the last words] and say we are the lords and our eyes are turned to the lord.\n</blockquote>\n</li></ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h2>On what principle are these ceremonies built?</h2>\n<p>Gemara following the Mishna  in Succa above cited explains.<br></p>\n<blockquote>\nגמרא דף נ\"ג עמוד ב'‏\n<br><br>\nתנו רבנן: ממשמע שנאמר (יחזקאל ח) ופניהם קדמה איני יודע שאחוריהם אל היכל ה'? אלא מה תלמוד לומר אחוריהם אל היכל ה' - מלמד שהיו פורעין עצמן, ומתריזין כלפי מטה. אנו ליה וליה עינינו כו'. איני? והאמר רבי זירא: כל האומר שמע שמע כאילו אמר מודים מודים - אלא הכי אמרי: המה משתחוים קדמה, ואנו ליה (אנחנו מודים), ועינינו ליה מיחלות. \n‏<br><br>\nOur Rabbis taught, Since it is said, And their faces toward the east, is it not obvious that their backs were toward the Temple of the Lord? What then is the import of the statement, 'their backs were toward the Temple of the Lord'? It teaches that they uncovered themselves and committed there a nuisance. WE ARE THE LORD'S AND OUR EYES ARE TURNED TO THE LORD etc. But can it be so? Did not R`Zera in fact rule, He who repeats Shema', Shema'(10) is as though he said Modim, Modim [and he is silenced]? - The fact is that it was this that they used to say, <b>\"They worshipped the sun toward the east\" but as for us we give thanks unto the Lord, and to the Lord do our eyes hope'.</b>\n</blockquote>\nThe last statement of this length quotes shows the principle: <br>Devaluating beginning is an introduction to a praise. <b>The Pyut Dayenu</b> is a whole devlopment of this idea. The first step was to know Hashem. When we get the top (see <i>the beautiful picture on the mishna in Succa</i>), we <b>turn around and look behind</b> us (see again the <i>beautiful picture in the mishna in Succa</i>) \n<ol><li>The mitsva is not just to tell, but as all occurences of Zechira, has a constructive aim (here Shevach, Hodaya (see the wort of Abrabanel <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70457/how-the-statements-of-r-elazar-ben-azaria-fits-in-the-seder/70462#70462\">here</a>))</li><Li>The chronologic and genealogic presentation of the the numerous benefits we have enjoyed, from the first time up to Beith Hamikdash</li><li>The story is from the conception to the birth of Am Israel, Yetsiat Mitsraym is the birth.

The beginning is a critical factor.</li></ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<h2>A very basic Remark on the verse <i>ARAMI OVED AVI</i></h2>\nAn important Gemara-Rashi in massechet Sota (32b). The Gemara says:\n<blockquote>It has been taught: R`Simeon B`Yohai said: A man should recount  what is to his discredit in a loud voice.<br>Rashi<br>\n‏ וגנותו. כגון ‏<b> ‏ ארמי אובד אבי היינו גנותו שמתודין שאביהן לבן הארמי היה רשע ‏</b> ‏: ‏<br>\n<b>His discredits</b>, as \"My father was an Aramean in perdition\". Since <b>their father, Laban the Aramean, was miscreant</b>. (See Ibn Ezra on the word oved \"מלת אובד מהפעלים שאינם יוצאים\")<br>\n</li>\n<p>If the Hagada was commenting this verse following the Pshat Hapashut as did Ibn Ezra and Rashbam on the Chumash, this verse was adapted for \"Matchil Bignut\". But the Gemara finds only two opinions about what is the beginning by disgrace and neither of the two quote the verse Arami Oved Avi.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מתחיל בגנות ומסיים בשבח. מאי בגנות? רב אמר: ״מתחלה עובדי עבודה זרה היו אבותינו״. [ושמואל] אמר: ״עבדים היינו״.</p>\n\n<p>It was taught in the mishna that the father begins his answer with disgrace and concludes with glory. The Gemara asks: What is the meaning of the term: With disgrace? <strong>Rav</strong> said that one should begin by saying: At first our forefathers were idol worshippers, before concluding with words of glory. And <strong>Shmuel</strong> said: The disgrace with which one should begin his answer is: We were slaves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'll take a stab at #1. I think it's simple:  humility to praise is the same as redemption from a kind of \"Exodus\" .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A free person's perspective, looking back once we are able to produce our own crops.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the author of the Hagada made a point of keeping the focus on God, not man, for the night, hence no mention of Moses is made in the entire text (well the original edition, anyway); the <em>my father was a lost Aramean</em> narrative is one that never uses the term \"Moses\", and keeps the credit squarely on God.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, a poor man at the rich man's table would also feel bad.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://revach.net/avodah/ahavas-yisroel/Ha-Lachma-Anya-Rav-Moshe-Shternbuch-Now-You-Invite-Guests-After-Kiddush/3568\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Ha Lachma Anya\": Rav Moshe Shternbuch - Now You Invite Guests, After Kiddush?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Shternbuch answers that the guest are already sitting at our\n  table but they feel really badly about what is going on.  They were\n  invited for the Seder by a man who is also poor.  He sits Seder night\n  with \"poor man's bread\" on his table.  Chazal instituted Ha Lachma\n  Anya to allay the fears of our poor guest.  We tell him that we are\n  not poor.  The poor bread is simply a remembrance to the days when we\n  were in Mitzrayim.</p>\n  \n  <p>We then tell him that we have plenty of food to go around and enough\n  to feed him as well, without giving up our own rations.  Therefore,\n  \"Kol Dichfin Yeisei V'Yeichol\" all the hungry guests are welcome to\n  eat in comfort. </p>\n  \n  <p>To top it all off we tell him that he should not feel like a pauper at\n  the rich homeowner's table.  \"Hashata Avdei\", we are all really slaves\n  in this galus.  \"L'Shana Haba B'Arya D'Yisroel\", next year we should\n  all rejoice together in Eretz Yisroel</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point is that in order to show that we have been freed, we invite people because a slave owns nothing and can invite no one without stealing from his master. Thus, even though we might be poor and eating \"lechem oni\" we are still free and we are eating that which belongs to us and which we obtained honestly.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/understanding-ha-lachma-anya/2015/03/26/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Understanding ‘Ha Lachma Anya’</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Ritvah in his commentary to the Haggadah suggests that on the\n  night of the Seder every person must envision as if he or she left\n  Mitzrayim that night. One must feel as if he was just freed from\n  slavery. A slave owns nothing. Only a free man can own things. A slave\n  can never invite someone to his meal. Therefore, before we begin our\n  first meal as free men, we declare that we would like to invite\n  whomever would like to come. Even though we know that no one can hear\n  us, we make the declaration to demonstrate to ourselves that we were\n  just freed from slavery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another point is we are saying that we acknowledge that part of the mitzvah of matzah is to ensure that everyone is able to partake of the matza.

If somehow someone cannot, we have been ready to have them join our group.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Alternatively, the Vilna Gaon says that the mitzvah of matzah is\n  connected to the mitzvah of tzedakah. The Yerushalmi in Bava Basra\n  says that there is an inyan to give maos chitin before Pesach to\n  enable people to acquire matzah. Based on this we can suggest that the\n  reason why we make an open invitation at the onset of the Seder is\n  because the mitzvah of matzah requires us to ensure that others will\n  have matzah as well. The passage begins with the words Ha lachma anya,\n  which means this is the poor man’s bread [that our fathers ate in\n  Mitzrayim] referring to the matzah. As we mention the matzah, it is\n  imperative that we invite others to join, as the mitzvah of matzah\n  demands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While it would have been too late to ask anyone to join us for the korbon Pesach, the \"kol dichfin\" used to be said just before the shechitah of the korbon Pesach.

However, the Rambam writes in\n  Hilchos Korban Pesach (2:2) that ideally one should shecht the korban\n  Pesach only for a group of people, not for an individual.

To satisfy\n  the sweet tooth of Jews who strictly observe Passover, Coca-Cola\n  substituted cane sugar for corn syrup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Or see <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/112747/112747\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> which focuses on the fact that some non-Jews prefer Pesach Coke</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During Passover, Jews are forbidden to eat a category of grains known\n  as kitniot, which includes corn. The Ashkenazi rabbis who came up with\n  this stricture many centuries ago probably didn't foresee how their\n  edict would collide with the invention of high fructose corn syrup\n  [...] the end result today is that there are all sorts of\n  HFCS-sweetened products that are kosher for most of the year but are\n  not kosher during Passover.

    "content": "# Which rishon allows women to appear without hair covering in front of less than three men in her own home?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember reading of an opinion that allows married women not to cover their hair when they are in their own home in the presence of three men or less.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot remember the source though and would really appreciate some help.</p>\n\n<p>Thank you!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The short answer(s):</p>\n\n<p>(a) Rashi, Tosafot, the Ran, the Rosh, the Tur (according to the Rema in Darkei Moshe EH 115 #4) and the Shulchan Aruch (EH 21:2, 115:4) all understand the Mishna/Gemara on Ketubot 72a to mean that a woman has no obligation (a priori) to cover her hair in her courtyard, and certainly not at home, even though it may be praiseworthy to do so. So concludes Rav Moshe Feinstein (EH I.58, YD II.75, OC V.37) and says that this was the custom in previous generations. However, Rav Moshe specifically says this is only when no one other than her husband or children are present.</p>\n\n<p>The Rosh (Ketubot ch. 7 #9) quotes the Yerushalmi about a courtyard: \"A courtyard which the many pierce is like an alleyway [i.e. a public space]; a courtyard which the many do not pierce is like a courtyard [and therefore does not require hair covering]\". It is possible to infer from this that similarly a house which \"the many do not pierce\" (<em>sh'ain harabim bok'im bo</em>) is a private space and doesn't require hair covering, and since in other places three people is considered \"public\" (for example with respect to <em>Lashon Hara</em>/Gossip), a woman need not cover her hair at home in front of fewer than three people. However, I have not seen any source say this explicitly (and I would expect Rav Getzel Ellinson in Woman and the Mitzvot to quote such a source, since he tries to include every opinion - see (b) below)</p>\n\n<p>(b) The Gemara on Brachot 24a says that when a handbreadth of one's wife skin in a normally-covered place is revealed, one cannot say Shema (incidentally, the Gemara there notes that one may not gaze at even the little finger of a woman other than one's wife if one's intention is to derive pleasure). The Rosh there (#37) quotes the Gemara, and the Divrei Chamudot (#116, Rav Yom Tov Lipman Heller, the Tosafot Yom Tov) says that the prohibition is due to being normally covered, and any part of the body which is normally uncovered is not a problem. Rav Getzel Ellinson (Woman and the Mitzvot II p.210) quotes the Ben Ish Chai as holding the same view (with respect to a nursing woman). According to this opinion, if the custom in a given community is for even married woman not to cover their hair at home even when non-relatives are present, then there is no problem in saying Shema (or Kiddush, or any other prayer) in their presence, since men are used to it. Given that, there would apparently be no obligation based on <em>lifnei iver</em> for the women to cover their hair since (see below).</p>\n\n<p>Further discussion:</p>\n\n<p>Approach (a) is problematic, because many explicit Gemaras forbid a man to look at women - for example, Bava Batra 57b which describes a man who intentionally takes a path which will lead by women washing clothes by the river (barefoot and bare-calved -- Rashbam) as wicked, and Brachot 24a mentioned above (incidentally, the Mishna Brura OC 75 #7 explains that only staring/gazing is forbidden when a woman is properly dressed, while even an incidental glance is forbidden if she is not). Given the prohibition of <em>lifnei iver</em>, putting a stumbling block in front of the blind (in this week's parsha, <em>Kedoshim</em>, as I write this in 5776!), is understood in many places in the Gemara (see Toldot Aharon to Vayikra 19:14) to mean one is obligated not to cause another to sin, how could a woman be allowed to dress in a way which would cause a man who sees her to sin?</p>\n\n<p>Indeed we would should find an explicit prohibition in the Shulchan Aruch - just as we find we must refrain from selling certain things to non-Jews if they are likely to use them for idolatry (YD 151:1). Where would we expect to find that <em>halacha</em>? Not in EH 115, which discusses which behavior justifies divorcing a wife with prejudice, and not in OC 75, which discusses saying Shema when faced with immodest dress, but in EH 21, which says something (perhaps) surprising: \"Jewish women may not walk in the market with uncovered hair...\" - implying that at home they need not cover.</p>\n\n<p>Approach (a) does not answer how she can avoid <em>lifnei iver</em>, but perhaps we can suggest that no man is obligated to see her in her private home, since he can always leave! Therefore she is not transgressing <em>lifnei iver</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Approach (b) of course assumes that such behavior is commonplace in that community, and therefore men are accustomed to see womens' hair indoors, even though they are explicitly forbidden from showing hair in public; while such a private/public distinction seems difficult to justify, all opinions agree that we differentiate between the hair of married and unmarried women.</p>\n\n<p>A problem with approach (b): if all rules of modesty are dependent on common practice and societal context, how can the Gemara in Ketubot 72a define lack of modesty? A possible solution: Brachot 24a only deals with what is arousing, which depends on context (like the Tosafot Yom Tov), and would be under <em>lifnei iver</em>. Ketubot 72a deals with violations of modesty, which is a divorce-able offense - not only <em>lifnei iver</em>, but (appropriately perhaps) <em>kedoshim tihyu</em> (\"be holy!\" - Vayikra 19:2) either defined by Chazal (like the Har Zvi) or <em>mi d'Oraita</em> like the straightforward implication there, but either way obligates a woman to absolute minima of modesty. If that is the case, then (b) is not an answer to the question, because the Divrei Chamudot only deals with when it is permissible to say Shema, or potentially <em>lifnei iver</em>, but not standards of modesty. Interestingly, Rav Ellison notes that Rav Ovadia Yosef in Yabia Omer says the Divrei Chamudot only applies to parts of the body beyond the minimum standards of modesty, but Rav Ellison says no such distinction appears in the Divrei Chamudot. It would appear that Rav Ovadia is understanding that the Divrei Chamudot <em>must</em> fit with Ketubot 72a (which the Tosafot Yom Tov surely knows about) and therefore limits his scope; Rav Ellison seems to have missed this point.</p>\n\n<p>If this is the case, we need to understand why the Shulchan Aruch's obligation on women to cover their hair (EH 21:2) only mentions public spaces - perhaps because the idea that a woman would appear in front of unrelated men in her home did not occur to Chazal or the poskim.</p>\n\n\n",

YD 102:4) so regular rules like 1:60 and Ta'am Lifgam would apply. From that point until the end of Pesach it is never nullified in a mixture and forbids one from deriving any benefit from the mixture (OC 447:1). Once the Chametz is nullified in a mixture, it doesn't come back once Pesach starts, though some opinions limit this in cases of \"Yavesh beYavesh\" ie. mixtures of discrete objects  (ibid. :4).</p>\n\n<p>The nullification mentioned in the passage כל חמירא refers to ownership and is essentially unrelated to the above laws.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Two unrelated uses of the word <em>bitul</em>, which is causing some confusion here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>If the quantity of chametz in this food is negligible, it's not considered \"chametz.\"</p></li>\n<li><p>I declare any chametz I own to be \"good as dust.\"</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any question of mixtures addresses the first point, completely unrelated to the second.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/seasonal/347/guide-to-selling-real-chometz-before-pesach/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a nice piece from the Star-K on the subject.</a></p>\n\n<p>In short, a bottle containing 99.9% milk by volume and .1% chametz, during the year, is halachically \"just plain milk.\" The chametz content is less than 1:60, you can't see it, taste it, feel it, anything. Thus when Chametz becomes prohibited mid-morning on the 14th of Nissan, this is \"milk\" and does not become prohibited. Starting on mid-14th of Nissan, however, if you take a teaspoon of beer it is \"prohibited chametz\"; adding it to a giant vat of milk will prohibit the whole thing.</p>\n\n<p>The Star-K article discusses a mixture of Chametz before Pesach vis-a-vis whether you can own it, or sell it if your practice is not to sell \"real\" Chametz.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The bitul of chametz in a mixture is the 60:1 because both of them were mutar before Pesach. The bitul of the declaration would not allow it to be eaten as that is similar to finding a piece of bread on Pesach that had been \"nullified\" by the kol chamirah. You would still have to destroy it on chol hamoed as it is still forbidden chametz. The difference would be a container of milk. If you had it from before Pesach, then the \"chametz\" in it (such as the vitamin D) would have been batel (while it was still mutar) and the entire container is mutar. If the vitamin D had been added after Pesach started, then it is chametz and asur.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the mention of feeding the cows grain is due to the worry that pieces of grain that had stuck to the udders somehow got into the milk. This was mainly true during the days of hand milking, but it could occur when the vacuum tube is attached to the udder (although <strong>very very</strong> unlikely nowadays). However, due to the seriousness of the matter we are machmir even for such an unlikely event.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ok.org/v1/Content.asp?ID=73\" rel=\"nofollow\">MILK ON MOED?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Q.</strong> Friends tell me they do not buy dairy products on Chol HaMoed Pesach. Why do they purchase these dairy products before the holiday?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>A.</strong> We take a very strict approach to Passover, often going beyond the letter of the law to avoid chametz.</p>\n  \n  <p>Dairy is a good example. Technically speaking, there is no chametz\n  concern when it comes to milk. But cows eat grain, and grain becomes\n  chametz upon prolonged contact with liquid. The custom to purchase\n  dairy products before Pesach is rooted in the fear that a chametz\n  particle may be present in the milk.</p>\n  \n  <p>Why, then, does it make a difference if the milk is purchased before\n  Pesach? The answer lies in the concept of bittul - nullification. A\n  particle of grain would be indiscernible and also would constitute\n  less than one-sixtieth of the milk. Hence the grain is nullified in\n  the milk. However, nullification applies only before Pesach begins\n  (specifically, before midday on erev Pesach). On Pesach we do not\n  apply the rule of nullification. Therefore, if the milk was in the\n  possession of the Jew before noon on erev Pesach, any chametz in the\n  milk is batel; hence the custom to purchase milk before the holiday.</p>\n  \n  <p>A dairy product that was present in a Jewish-owned store before Pesach\n  would not be of concern, since any chametz in it was nullified. The\n  custom to avoid purchase of dairy on Chol HaMoed pertains to dairy\n  found in stores owned by non-Jews.</p>\n  \n  <p>Chalav Yisrael dairy products are made under the watchful eye of\n  observant Jews. When marked Kosher for Passover, these may be bought\n  on Chol HaMoed. One can be assured that the cows were not fed grain\n  during the period immediately before Pesach, so that there is no\n  suspicion that chametz is present in the milk.</p>\n  \n  <p>When buying dairy products for Pesach, please make sure that they have\n  Passover certification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They only certify CO2 that is definitely not derived from Chametz even though it may not be required to do so. Rav Moshe Heinemann of the Star-K has ruled that it is not required.</p>\n\n<p>According to a footnote, the OU would rely on a letter from the supplier as to the source of CO2. The quote from the OU by @GershonGold would seem to imply that they might no longer require a letter from the CO2 supplier, but that is not explicit.</p>\n\n<p>The footnotes give details as to how CO2 was derived, the psakim over the years, and the methods as they changed and became technologically advanced.</p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion at <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/carbon_dioxide_for_pesach.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carbon Dioxide for Pesach</a> which explains how CO2 generation was originally chametz, but nowadays is no longer a problem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With this understanding, we can now address the question of whether\n  carbon dioxide recovered from a chametz fermentation should be\n  forbidden on Pesach.  It turns out that the technology of recovering\n  carbon dioxide has steadily progressed over the past 100 years.  At\n  first scientists figured out how to liquefy the carbon dioxide\n  escaping from these reactions but had no effective method of purifying\n  these vapors.  As such, in those days, the liquid carbon dioxide\n  likely did have a carryover of taste from the beer or whisky it was\n  made from, and for that reason, the Poskim of that era concluded that\n  the carbon dioxide was forbidden on Pesach.  </p>\n  \n  <p>However, in the past 50 years, the industry has developed 5 different\n  methods of purifying the carbon dioxide – four while it is in the\n  gaseous state, and a fifth after it is liquefied – to the point that\n  nowadays carbon dioxide recovered from beer or whisky bears absolutely\n  no taste of the original liquid it was created from.  We can surmise\n  that that this change of facts is why when the question was presented\n  to Rav Auerbach, he ruled that it is surely permitted!  Rav Auerbach\n  appears to have held that a vapor/condensate only retains the status\n  of the original liquid if it also retains the taste of that liquid,\n  and since nowadays the carbon dioxide has absolutely no taste of the\n  original beverage, it is not forbidden as chametz.  [See the footnote\n  for an alternate explanation of these halachos.] </p>\n  \n  <p>Of the kashrus agencies we conferred with, we found that many chose to\n  take a strict approach and not allow carbon dioxide from chametz or\n  even kitnios (but they took varying approaches to verifying the source\n  of the carbon dioxide) but others came to the conclusion outlined\n  above that one may be lenient nowadays. (This is the ruling of Rav Moshe Heinemann of the Star-K).  <strong>Due to the (commendable)\n  strictness with which people traditionally treat questions of chametz,\n  the cRc only certifies seltzer or soda after verifying that the carbon\n  dioxide is not recovered from chametz (but does accept it from kitnios\n  sources).  While this may not be required on strict halachic grounds,\n  it is within the spirit of חומרא דפסח to be machmir on this matter</strong>.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Postscript  </p>\n  \n  <p>The following are some relevant facts about the current carbon dioxide\n  market:  </p>\n  \n  <p>Nowadays, beer companies typically do collect the carbon dioxide\n  vapors escaping from their fermenters for reuse in their products, and\n  it is very rare for them to sell the carbon dioxide to others.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Most whisky and ethanol produced in the United States is kitnios, not\n  chametz. Due to an overabundance of carbon dioxide byproduct, it is\n  uncommon for a producer (e.g. a whisky or ethanol plant) to recover\n  the carbon dioxide unless they have a specific buyer in mind.  In\n  fact, typically the carbon dioxide resellers are the ones who install\n  the collection equipment in the producer of their choice, and then\n  remain with that producer for many years.  As such, although many new\n  ethanol plants have opened up in the USA in recent years, it may take\n  many years before the carbon dioxide produced in those plants is ever\n  used in seltzer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/articles/ou-p-not-ou-p-products-require-passover-certification/\" rel=\"nofollow\">OUKOSHER.ORG</a> says that carbon dioxide used to be produced from grain fermentation.

See <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/carbon_dioxide_for_pesach.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> the discussion by the CRC-Chigago which concurs with my answer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seltzer exists in two forms.

If there is no (new clothing or) new fruit, nevertheless he says Shehechiyanu. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Be’er Heitiv records the reason:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חדש.  ויש טועים ליקח אף בשאר י''ט וטעות הוא דר''ה קדושה אחת היא. </p>\n  \n  <p>Some make the mistake to take even on other Yamim Tovim. It’s a mistake, for Rosh HaShanah is one Kedushah. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For background, to explain the concept of “one Kedushah”: An egg laid on Yom Tov is forbidden until after Yom Tov (Mishnah, Beitzah 2a). The Gemara (4b-5b) asks whether this extends to two days of Yom Tov and two days of Rosh HaShanah. The terminology used is Kedushah Achas, literally “one holiness,” versus Shtei Kedushos, literally “two holinesses.” The idea is that if it’s one long day, one “holiness,” the egg laid on the first day is forbidden on the second day, while if it’s two separate days, two “holinesses,” the egg laid on the first day is permitted on the second day. The Halacha follows Rav, that two days of Yom Tov are two “holinesses,” but two days of Rosh HaShanah are one “holiness.”</p>\n\n<p>There are other ramifications to this Halacha besides for eggs. We make a Shehechiyanu on the first day of Yom Tov, but not on subsequent days. Outside of Eretz Yisrael, we make the Beracha on both the first and second day of Yom Tov, as the second day is treated exactly the same as the first (SA OC 496:1), but Rosh HaShanah is considered one long day (explicitly paskened by the Shulchan Aruch in OC 496:2). As such, there is a concern that, rather than making Shehechiyanu on consecutive days, one is making Shehechiyanu <em>twice on the same day.</em> Therefore, the custom is to be stringent and make the Shehechiyanu on something else, though we’re not worried if there’s nothing to make a Shehechiyanu on. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# May women say prayers aloud in the presence of men?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a tznius (or any other) issue with women saying blessings and/or prayers aloud in the presence of unrelated men? I remember hearing that certain inyonim (perhaps kol isha?) do not apply if the woman is singing/chanting a holy text, since this this is not inherently arousing. </p>\n\n<p>However, it seems that there are still some issues, since after all we don't let women leyn or daven in front of a congregation. Would these issues also apply to saying a personal prayer, such as a blessing, out loud when men are nearby? In view of the assumed <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/19124/should-i-say-all-blessings-aloud\">preferability</a> of saying some prayers aloud, what should she do?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I found this: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משנה. מי שהיה עבד או אשה או קטן מקרין אותו – עונה אחריהן מה שהן\n  אומרין, ותבא לו מאירה.  אם היה גדול מקרא אותו – עונה אחריו הללויה, \n  מקום שנהגו לכפול – יכפול, לפשוט – יפשוט, לברך – יברך, הכל כמנהג\n  המדינה.</p>\n  \n  <p>One who has a slave, a woman, or a minor read [the Hallel] to him, he\n  must repeat after them what they say, and a curse be upon him.  If an\n  adult recited to him, he repeats after him [only] Halleluyah. In a\n  place where the custom is to repeat [verses], he should repeat; \n  [Where the custom is] to say them only once, he should say them once.\n  [Where the custom is] to recite a blessing afterwards, he should\n  recite the blessing afterwards.

Indeed,\n  Rav Meir Bransdorfer (Teshuvot Knei Bosem 1:25) writes that mouthwash\n  is permitted on Pesach if it has inedible Chametz <strong>only if it is not\n  intended for eating or to enjoy the taste of it</strong>.

    "content": "# Who are considered \"avot\" who worshipped idols?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the beginning of the Amidah, we identify \"avoteinu\" our forefathers and we list them as Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov. But in the Haggadah, we begin by saying \"Mitchilah, ovdei avodah zara hayu avoteinu\" and this is expanded on by citing a pasuk from Yehoshua 24:2-4 which reads (from the chabad site)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Joshua said to the whole nation, \"Thus said the Lord God of Israel, 'Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the river from earliest time, Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor; and they served other gods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fathers here (avoteichem) are Terach, Avraham and Nachor. Haran is not listed (dealt with in part <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37265/terach-father-of-avraham-and-of-nachor-what-about-haran\">here</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While I know that Terach is Avraham's father so, strictly speaking, he is an ancestor, I never thought of him as one of the avot. Nachor and Avraham took Haran's daughters as wives, so Haran is also an ancestor as is Nachor.</p>\n\n<p>If the verse is talking about the well known three avot (Avraham, Yitzchak, Yaakov) then they weren't idol worshippers. If it is talking about Terach and Nachor, while they worshipped idols, they weren't \"avot\" in the sense I understand. If Haran isn't included because he might not have been clearly an idol worshipper, why is Avraham listed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I heard from a relative of R' Yaakov Kaminetzky that R' Yaakov pointed out that we <em>don't</em> say \"מתחילה אבותיהו היו עובדי עבודה זרה / at first our forefathers were idolaters,\" but rather \"מתחילה עובדי עבודה זרה היו אבותינו / at first idolaters were our forefathers.\" Originally, idolaters were at the top of our family tree. But then, Hashem spiritually disconnected us from them, and they are no longer our forefathers. When Hashem brought us to Him at Har Sinai, He removed our connection to our idolatrous ancestors and defined our roots, our avos, as Avraham, Yitzchok, and Yaakov.</p>\n\n<p>So, yes, they <em>were</em> \"avoseinu\" but they are no longer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The use of the term \"avoseinu\" is not the same as <strong>the</strong> avot. It is used as a generic term for <em>ancestors</em> in general. An example can be found in the phrease <em>minhag avoseinu beyadeinu</em> which refers to our following the customs of our ancestors (for example two days Yom Tov). Thus, we see as @DoubleAA cited that everyone from Avraham and earlier made the mistake until (the Rambam says) Avraham figured out that there was only one \"god\" at age 40. We than refer to Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov as <strong>the avot</strong> to differentiate them from those who came before them as well as those who learned from them and followed in their footsteps.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1401.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Hilchos Avodas Zarah Perek 1 Halacha 10 & 11</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואביו ואימו וכל העם עובדים עבודה זרה, והוא היה עובד עימהן.  וליבו\n  משוטט ומבין, עד שהשיג דרך האמת, והבין קו הצדק, מדעתו הנכונה; וידע שיש\n  שם אלוה אחד, והוא מנהיג הגלגל, והוא ברא הכול, ואין בכל הנמצא אלוה חוץ\n  ממנו.</p>\n  \n  <p>יא  וידע שכל העם טועים, ודבר שגרם להם לטעות, זה שעובדים את הכוכבים ואת\n  הצורות, עד שאבד האמת מדעתם; ובן ארבעים שנה, הכיר אברהם את בוראו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><b>Terah</b> avi Abraham and avi Nachor but Abraham is not in the count according to the Ritba quoted bellow. Because Avraham leaves idolatry. Charan does not adhere completely to idolatry and follows Avraham, so he is skipped too. </p>\n\n<p><h3>The general idea</h3> Our beginning is not special, the point is not \"avot\" as Prototype of the nation. But an exhortation to humility entails to remember the low level of beginning. Humility first make possible Hakarat Hatov laShem. The presentation is that Hashem brought Abraham. This enhances the need of humility.<br>\nThe mention of Nachor is an allusion to the \"natural continuum of Terach\". Terach was not the inspirator of Abraham.\n<br>To illustrate this let's look the Perush of the Ritba on the Hagada. It is the source of my answer, perhaps I do not understand it enough, so, see here if this snippet can answer to your question.</p>\n\n<blockquote>‏<b>‏ויעבדו אלקים אחרים </b>‏ חוזר על אבותינו הנזכרים <i>‏תרח ונחור, לא לאברהם</i>‏ כי מקטנותו הכיר את בוראו ומאס בעבודה זרה לגמרי כמו שאמרו חז\"ל, ומעצמו עשה, לא מתרבות אביו (not from the paternal culture )‏. ומאב ואם אחד יצאו הוא ונחור, וזה הלך לעבודה זרה וזה הלך לעבוד את ה', ומאס בכל זרע אביו וקרא היחוד. וכשם שנבדל הוא מכל האומות לקרוא בשם ה', אחר כך הבדילו ה' ולקחו הוא וזרעו להיות לו לגוי אחד בארץ מידה כנגד מידה.     ‏</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara (Bava Kama 91b) derives its prohibition by exegesis on the verse: \"and surely your blood of your lives will I require\" (Genesis 9: 5), interpreted as: \"I will require your blood if you yourselves shed it.\"</p>\n\n<p>see also <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.34.13?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabba 34:13</a></p>\n\n<p>There are two famous cases of suicide in Tanach, Saul and Samson:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Saul’s suicide (I Samuel 31: 4-5) is not criticized by Chazal, and on\n  the contrary, the Midrash (34:13) states explicitly that he did not\n  sin, indicating that it was permitted for him to take his own life.\n  Why is this so? The Yam Shel Shlomo suggests two possible reasons.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li><p>One is that Shaul was concerned that his falling into the hands of the enemy would have provoked the Jewish fighters into an impossible\n  assault against the enemy camp, potentially costing thousands of\n  lives. The Yam Shel Shlomo thus writes that it is permitted to give up\n  one’s life for the purpose of saving other Jewish lives.</p></li>\n  <li><p>Another reason he suggests is that the falling of the anointed King of Israel into enemy hands constitutes a grave desecration of Hashem’s\n  Name, and for this purpose it was permitted for Shaul to take his own\n  life.</p></li>\n  <li><p>A third suggested explanation, which is from the Yefei To’ar (commentary to Midrash) and the Radak (Shmuel 31:4), is that the case\n  of Shaul was special because he had been told by Shmuel that the enemy\n  would not spare his life. Because of the certainty that he would die\n  shortly, and given the special circumstances, it was permitted for him\n  to take his own life.</p></li>\n  </ul>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, Shimshon’s suicide (Shoftim 16: 30), in which he brought\n  down a building on himself and his Philistine tormentors, is defended\n  on the grounds that it constituted an act of kiddush Hashem,\n  “sanctification of the Divine Name,” in the face of heathen mockery of\n  the G-d of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/suicide-in-jewish-tradition-and-literature/#\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2015/04/when-a-jew-requests-assisted-suicide/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2015/10/19/suicide-and-euthanasia-in-torah-law/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> for the sources of the above text and more references.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Navi, Chazal, and Rishonim, we can several cases of suicide, two points should be investigated, firstly the source of the prohibition. Secondly the retrospective vue about the suicided man. In some cases to choice the death is right, sometimes it is wrong.

Interestingly, while they do say <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70693/#comment204147_70693\">as you did</a> that שבעה ימי שבתא means \"seven days of the week,\" their various answers to שמונה ימי מילה all directly address שבעה ימי שבתא as well. </p>\n\n<p>All of the answers they quote regarding תשעה ירחי לידה answer a different question: if all of the things in the piyut are unique to the Jews, or a merit by which they left Mitzraim, then why is nine months of pregnancy listed as well? I've only referenced below the ones which can be used to answer your question as well.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <strong>Sifsei Yitzchak</strong> answers your question about eight days of Milah based on the comments of the Ohr Zarua (Shu\"t §11) and Tosfos Rid (Kiddushin 29a), who write that the Mitzvah of Milah is not only to circumcise the child, but also to prepare for it from the time the baby is born. Thus, all of his first eight days can be considered part of the Mitzvah. Similarly, שבעה ימי שבתא means that since one prepares for Shabbos all week, it's all considered part of the Mitzvah.)<br>\nThe <strong>Sha'ar Yisachar</strong> (Ma'amarei Chodesh Nissan, Ma'amar Agadeta d'Pischa, §133) explains the relevance of nine months of pregnancy that the Jews observed Hilchos Niddah, and so they, unlike the other nations, could clearly determine when the nine months began and ended. Perhaps based on this we can answer your question by combining it with the above: since the nine months were spent observing halachos in preparation of the births, they can be ascribed to the birth at the end.</li>\n<li><strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein</strong> explains that for many mitzvos, at the time at which one is not performing the mitzvah, the effects of the mitzvah aren't apparent. Not so Bris Milah and Shabbos; the former is always apparent, and it's for the latter that one works all week. Perhaps similarly we can say that all nine months of pregnancy are for the birth which follows.</li>\n<li><strong>Rav Yosef Shlomo Kahanneman</strong> of Yeshivas Ponevezh is quoted as having said that the night of the Seder is meant to strengthen our Emunah. He explains the line to mean that \"nine months [of pregnancy]\" are required for a \"birth,\" to reject the claims of the Christians who believe that \"that man\" wasn't born in the way normal people are. (Indeed, in the footnotes, they quote the Mahari\"l Minhagim, Likutim §103, that Jesus is called \"that man\" to indicate that he was a man just like any other, and he was not Divine.)<br>\nWhile the part about strengthening our Emunah doesn't extend to Bris Milah, the main answer does: Bris Milah is only possible if there are (at least) eight days leading into it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

The framework must necessarily include axioms from which we develop definitions, lemmas, theorems, and corollaries. Indeed, the Method of Gematria can be precisely defined as follows:</p>\n\n<p>Let V_1 and V_2 be two verses in the Bible. Let N_1 be the total gematria of a set of words in V_1. Let N_2 be the total gematria of a set of words in V_2. It is possible that V_1 and V_2 are contextually or thematically linked if and only if N_1=N_2.</p>\n\n<p>This definition refers to words or expressions in the verses that are contextual or thematic. By Collins English Dictionary, the <em>context</em> of a word, sentence, or text consists of the words, sentences, or text before and after it which help to make its meaning clear.  So once the Method of the Gematria establishes the association (N_1=N_2) between the two verses, V_1 and V_2, then several verses before and after them may need to be consulted for a  better understanding of the association.  Also, by the same dictionary, in linguistics, the adjective <em>thematic</em> denotes a word that is the theme of a sentence. In grammar, it is of or relating to the stem or root of a word. Very often, there is a need to consult Strong’s Concordance and the Hebrew and Greek lexicons to fully understand the association between words that are thematic in the Bible.</p>\n\n<p>I am happy to expound further.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You can start your research with some google searches, alternatively, you can explore the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah in Avos</a> which equates Gematria as the desserts of torah learning.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.18?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Yonah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Yonah</a> comments on that mishnah that Gematria sharpens the mind.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishnah in Avos ג':י\"ח says\nתְּקוּפוֹת וְגִימַטְרִיאוֹת, פַּרְפְּרָאוֹת לַחָכְמָה.</p>\n<p>The original meaning for גִימַטְרִיאוֹת was presumably geometry, and indeed that is how many render it.</p>\n<p>In the Talmud it seems to have been reinterpreted to mean gematria.</p>\n\n\n",

The creation of the universe was completed by the creation of the Shabbat. The day that Hashem \"stopped\" the creation. That is also why the eighth day (the day of bris milah) symbolizes going over and above the universe of space-time.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch among other meforshim says that this is the basic connection to the concept of the completion of the natural world. The reference to completion mean that hashem explicitly stopped creation, but that everything that happened <strong>including the stopping for Shabbat</strong> was part of creation.

As a result, every day from Pesach to the end of Kislev will always be the same day of the week as the previous year. Teves may cause a difference because of the malei/chaseir difference.

If you'f liuke to knwo, comment (ping) and I'll get you alink to my google drive where I discuss this.</p>\n\n<p>In brief, any maleh leap year causes a repetition of the days of the week for holidays in the previous year. There seems to be no pattern as to how often this scenario occurs, but from what I have checked in the past approx. 40 years, this pattern seems to occur on average every 4 to 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>As far as Pesach is concerned, only Tuesday, Thursday and Shabbat can be repeated in two consecutive years. Sunday is never repeated. Since Pesach is most likely to occur on Tuesday, the Tuesday repetition tends to be the most common.</p>\n\n\n",

However i am not aware of any poseks that will allow someone to make oatmeal during Pesach.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are several ways that products can be gluten free but not kosher for Passover.  </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gluten free oats which have not been baked into matzahs in the appropriate manner for Passover (as mentioned in another answer).  It is worth pointing out for those who are coeliac or highly sensitive to gluten that most oats are contaminated by glutenous grains such as wheat which are grown in nearby fields.  Also worth noting that a significant minority of gluten intolerant people (including myself) are also avenin-intolerant and avenin is a similar protein to gluten which is present in oats.</li>\n<li>Although wheat, barley, rye and spelt all contain gluten when they are harvested, it is possible for this to be removed.  One of the common methods for doing this is repeatedly washing the grain, since gluten is water soluble.  This is a problem for Passover as the grain is considered chometz after being exposed to water and is no longer suitable for Passover.  In the UK (where I live), washed wheat flour is fairly widely available, as are gluten free breads baked from it.  None of these would be suitable for Passover.  Similarly, whiskey is not suitable for Passover but the gluten is destroyed as a side effect of the way it is produced.</li>\n<li>There may be other extracts from the five grains which are present in a food (or often medicine) which have not been treated in a manner which makes them suitable for Passover (similar to point 1, but in this case it is a specific part of the grain which is being used, not everything apart from the gluten).  This can be a problem in surprising places.  London Beth Din have advised that many nasal sprays are problematic for example.</li>\n<li>Although they are not chometz, Ashkenazim are forbidden to eat kitniyot on Passover.  This includes a number of other vegetables such as corn, peas, beans etc.  There are also restrictions on rice.  nb. the restrictions on kitniyot and rice are far less than the 5 grains and these don't need to be locked away over Passover.  They should not be put in Passover utensils and Passover cutlery shouldn't be used on them though.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No because gluten free doesn't necesarily mean no chametz. One very common way of making something gluten free is by adding enzymes which specifically break down gluten. Many of these products still contain grains which have become chametz though.</p>\n\n\n",

Why is this done in those places that do say?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The source is Shulchan Oruch Orach Chayim 487 (4) </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בליל ראשון של פסח גומרים את ההלל בצבור בנעימה בברכה תחלה וסוף ובן בליל\n  שני של שני ימים טובים של גליות On the first night of Pesach, we\n  complete the Hallel with the community with a pleasant tune and a\n  blessing at the beginning and end. The same is on the second night\n  outside Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rema points out that this is not “our” custom.  </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://mevakeshlev.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/hallel-in-shul-on-seder-night.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">mevakeshlev</a> gives \nseveral approaches from the Rishonim to explain this practice.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A. In Chazal’s times, there were no siddurim and therefore the common\n  people davened together with the chazzan or by listening to the\n  chazzan’s prayer. (This is why the chazzan is called a shaliach\n  tzibur, the emissary of the community, since he indeed prayed on\n  behalf of many individuals.) On the days that we are required to\n  recite Hallel, these people listened to the chazzan’s Hallel and\n  responded appropriately and thereby fulfilled their mitzvah. However,\n  how could they recite Hallel Seder night? They did so by reciting\n  Hallel together with the chazzan in shul before coming home (see Gra,\n  Orach Chayim 487).</p>\n  \n  <p>B. A different approach contends that the community recited Hallel in\n  shul the first night of Pesach in order to fulfill the mitzvah with a\n  large group. Although one may recite Hallel by oneself, reciting it\n  communally is a greater observance of the mitzvah.</p>\n  \n  <p>Neither of these two approaches necessarily assumes that Hallel on\n  Seder night requires a bracha. Indeed, the Chazon Ish recited Hallel\n  in shul Seder night without reciting a bracha beforehand. There are\n  congregations in Bnei Braq that follow this approach.</p>\n  \n  <p>C. A third approach contends that the primary reason for reciting\n  Hallel in shul is to recite a bracha beforehand. These poskim contend\n  that Hallel at the Seder would require a bracha if it was not\n  interrupted by the meal; to resolve this, Hallel is recited twice,\n  once in shul with a bracha without interruption, and then a second\n  time during the Seder. According to this opinion, Hallel Seder night\n  fulfills two different purposes:</p>\n  \n  <p>(1) We sing Hallel to Hashem as we do on all Yomim Tovim because of\n  his miracles; on Seder night we sing Hallel at night because that is\n  when we were redeemed. </p>\n  \n  <p>(2) We praise Hashem while performing the mitzvos of Seder night –\n  haggadah, matzah etc. Although one could fulfill both of these mitzvos\n  by reciting Hallel one time during the Seder, one would miss making a\n  bracha. Therefore, Hallel is recited during davening so that it can be\n  introduced with a bracha, and is sung again during the Seder so that\n  it surrounds the mitzvos of the night. This is the prevalent practice\n  of Sefardim, Chassidim, and the most common approach followed in Eretz\n  Yisroel today (see Gra, Orach Chayim 487).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Also, certain foods, such as mustard seeds, are prohibited because they grow in pods similar to legumes; and cumin is prohibited because its seeds are similar to grain. So corn would be considered kitniyot because it grows in a similar fashion to the traditional grains and legumes and can be made into flour and bread.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein wrote (Iggrot Moshe, Orech Chaim 3:63) that the custom not to eat kitniyot on Passover was not created by a group of rabbis issuing a formal ban; rather different communities developed the custom of refraining from  certain foods on Passover because they could be mistaken for chametz or they were grown or processed in proximity to flour. These customs eventually became accepted among Ashkenazic Jews, and once a custom has become widely accepted, it has the force of Jewish law.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thefreedictionary.com/corn\" rel=\"nofollow\">thefreedictionary.com</a> has this to say about the word corn:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Originally, the English word corn meant any rounded grain or seed\n  whatsoever. In particular, it was used to refer to the kind of grain\n  most often grown in a certain region. Thus in England, a cornfield is\n  usually a field of wheat. The pretty blue cornflower is a Eurasian\n  weed that originally plagued fields of wheat, not maize. In Scotland,\n  on the other hand, corn can mean \"oats,\" the grain that thrives best\n  in Scotland's cool and damp climate. To modern North Americans,\n  however, corn means maize.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Yehuda Shurpin (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/871998\" rel=\"nofollow\">chabad.org</a>), it appears that the popularity of corn to the extent that it was named as <em>the</em> grain in North America – was sufficient cause for the custom of kitniyot to be extended to this previously unknown \"grain\".

So coin may be a mana in this sense. And further the Gemara found two different versions of the statements of Rav Papa. the first is that coin is not equivalent to utensils, and the second says that coin is equivalent to utensils in matter of Chalipin (Not in Matter of hilchot Shabbat or hilchot Tum'at Kelim).<br>\nSee bellow a snippet of Kesef Mishne <i>Sefer Kinyan, Hilchot Mechira, chapter 5, Halacha 6</i>, annotated: The whole text is <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=89275&rid=12515\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n\n<blockquote> ואמרו בגמרא במנא לאפוקי ממ\"ד קונין בפירות ביה למעוטי מטבע <b>‏   שכיון שאמרו במנא נתמעטו בין מטבע בין שאר דברים דלא הוו כלי וביה למה לי למעוטי מטבע</b>‏?‏‏ <br>‏ \n<b>‏ י\"ל דכל מילי מיקרו כלי לבד מפירות לפי שאין דומים כלל לנעל שאין משתמשים בהם בשום מלאכה ונרקבין ונפסדין במעט זמן ואין מתקיימין כנעל </b>‏ ‏‏ ומטבע כעין נעל הוא דראוי להשתמש בו לתלותו בצואר הבנות ולשקול בו משקלותיו ואינו נרקב [...] ‏</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it is said in the <em>gemara</em>, \"A utensil\" to exclude the opinion\n  that holds that one can effect a <em>chalipin</em> with fruit, and\n  \"therewith\" to exclude coins. <strong>[One might ask] since it is said \"with\n  a utensil,\" that should exclude both coins as well as anything else\n  that is not a vessel, and why do we need \"therewith\" to exclude coin?</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>One could answer that anything can be called a vessel besides for\n  fruit, because they are not at all similar to a shoe [see explanation\n  below], because they cannot be used for any labor.

That is, if a miracle occured, then it would prevent bechiras chofshis (free will). In order to allow for free will, hashem has the miracle appear to use \"natural law\" but occur at precisely the time needed and in precisely the way it is needed. Many meforshim (such as Rav Hirsch or Rabbi Avigdor Miller) explain that the nature of the miracles was not what impressed the Egyptians, but the <strong>precision</strong> of the miracles. They occurred precisely when Moshe Rabbeinu stated, ended precisely when he said they would and covered exactly the area  and the people that were to be affected. For example, the plague of frogs was the \"original green line\" and showed the precise borders of Egypt. There is a medrash that the frogs were used to settly some border disputes at that time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/article_cdo/aid/46079/jewish/Three-Natural-Miracles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three Natural Miracles</a> shows the various types of miracles that can occur.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A confrontational miracle, which overpowers and displaces the natural\n  norm, creating a reality that is completely contrary nature’s\n  laws.</p>\n  \n  <p>A natural miracle, which, though it may be no less “impossible” by the\n  standard norms, and no less obvious a display of the hand of G‑d,\n  nevertheless occurs by natural means, employing natural phenomena and\n  processes to achieve its end.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As an example, there actually is a \"scientific\" explanation for the splitting of the Yam Suf. The point is that a wind could have blown and uncovered a ridge of land across the sea. Hashem took this and changed it to be sufficient for the entire Bnei Yisrael as well as adding the miracles specified by the midrashim. It also kept the Egyptians away until they crossed as well as making the timing exact.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=99580&page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scientists Explain Red Sea Parting and Other Miracles</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the latest attempt to lend scientific credence to a supernatural\n  event, Naum Volzinger, a senior researcher at St. Petersburg's\n  Institute of Oceanography, and Alexei Androsov, a colleague based in\n  Hamburg, Germany, analyzed conditions that could have made the parting\n  of the Red Sea possible.</p>\n  \n  <p>As the biblical story goes: \"And Moses stretched out his hand over the\n  sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all\n  that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Volzinger and Androsov calculated that a wind blowing at the speed of\n  67 miles per hour sustained overnight could have exposed a reef that\n  existed close below the ocean surface. The Israelites could have then\n  fled over the passage before the wind died down and waters rose again,\n  blocking the way for pursuing Egyptian soldiers in their wheeled\n  chariots.</p>\n  \n  <p>Volzinger explains that some 3,500 years ago, the reef would have been\n  closer to the water's surface so it would have been exposed for just\n  the right amount of time.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"It would take the Jews … four hours to cross the 7-kilometer reef\n  that runs from one coast to another,\" Volzinger told The Moscow Times.\n  \"Then, in half an hour, the waters would come back.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>A miracle?

    "content": "# Does one have a halachic obligation to pay use tax\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I apologize that this question has quite a bit of background!</p>\n\n<p>Many states in the USA have something called a 'sales and use tax'. The basic idea is that whenever you buy something in the state, retailers add on n% to the sticker price of the item, and take that money and send it to the state government (that's the 'sales tax' part). However, sometimes it's possible to buy things without paying sales tax (for instance, some internet purchases are free of sales tax, you might buy things in another state which doesn't have sales tax). In such cases, you have an individual (secular) legal obligation to pay what the sales tax <em>would have been</em> to the state government (that's the 'use tax' part). (If you buy something in a different state that has a lower sales tax rate, you're only obliged to pay the difference between the sales tax you already paid and the sales tax you would have paid in your state.)</p>\n\n<p>A key fact is that the 'use tax' is basically (as far as I can see) only enforced on the honor system (at least if you are not talking about big ticket items like cars). It also seems that the vast majority of Americans do <em>not</em> pay the use tax that they owe.</p>\n\n<p>I, personally, feel obligated to pay this tax as an American, and our family pays it. My wife is willing to humor me on this, but she is a little unhappy about it: she says that she feels like a 'chump' because we're paying this tax that hardly anyone else pays.</p>\n\n<p>It occurred to me that if we have a halachic obligation to pay the tax then maybe my wife will feel better about doing it! Since, in general, taxes are almost the clearest case of dina d'malkuta dina out there, you'd think that that would settle the matter. But many poskim say that dina d'malkuta dina only applies when a law is enforced in practice by the government, which isn't really case for use taxes (at least in our state). So that argument wasn't completely convincing, and it would be nice to find a clear discussion which is exactly on point. Does anyone know of one?</p>\n\n<p>Obviously CYLOR if this actually is a live question for you. As I say, it's not a live question for us because even if we have no halachic obligation to pay this tax, I feel that we must pay for other reasons). </p>\n\n\n",

I'm used to Tanakh translations sticking a little closer to the words that are actually there -- not necessarily literal, of course, as there's no such thing as a completely literal translation, but this is the sort of thing where I'd expect a translation closer to <em>p'shat</em> accompanied by commentary (or a footnote if the edition isn't doing fuller commentary).

He starts and ends his book talking about piety, although \"piety\" is merely one of the traits listed in the ladder of ascent.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an excerpt of a commentary from Rabbi Yechezkel Sarna on the Mesilas Yesharim which explains what it is doing in the introduction of the book (I am answering this based on my understanding of your <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70793/what-is-chassidut-meantioned-by-the-misilat-yeshorim/70839#comment204675_70802\">comments</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabeinu called his book \"the Path of the Just\", not \"the Path of the\n  Pious\" despite that he opens his book with the \"foundation of piety\"\n  (in ch.1) and in the final section of the book says: \"I did not finish\n  in this book all the principles of piety\", and then goes on to\n  elaborate on \"piety\" until the end of the book. Likewise, in the\n  introduction, he speaks at length on piety, and so too in many\n  chapters of the book besides the chapters specifically designated to\n  the trait of piety.</p>\n  \n  <p>It seems because piety is not the final end asked of man. It is merely\n  a level among the levels counted in the Beraitha of Rabbi Pinchas ben\n  Yair which Rabeinu in his book expounds one by one. The final end\n  asked of man is that he be \"Yashar\" Just/Upright as G-d made him. As\n  written \"G-d has made man upright [but they have sought out many\n  schemes]...\" (Eccl. 7:29).</p>\n  \n  <p>Our sages asked (Avodah Zara 25a): \"why is [Genesis] called the 'Book\n  of the Just'? Because it is the book of the Just, namely the holy\n  forefathers (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob) which are called Just.\" Hence,\n  this is what is asked of man. As written in Tana d'Bei Eliyahu, \"a man\n  is obligated to say 'when will my deeds reach those of my forefathers,\n  Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob'\". And that which Rabeinu speaks about the\n  trait of piety, opening and sealing his book with it, this is because\n  <strong>he wages a massive war campaign against the \"Mitchasdim\" (false pious)</strong>\n  in this book which are \"most people\" who consider many customs and many ways as\n  \"piety\" but they are only fallacious piety... and there is no trait of\n  all the traits counted by Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair of whom there is more\n  misunderstanding than piety. But what G-d asks of us is to that we be\n  Yesharim (upright/just). For this includes all the traits. For a\n  person who lacks even one of them is already not considered Yashar. Rather\n  he is among those who \"sought out many schemes\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>from Mesilas Yesharim with english commentaries <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=2&e=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>original hebrew of Rabbi Sarna is at www.hebrewbooks.org/41769 in the hakdama</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why eat gebrochts on the 8th day?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apparently, among those who don't eat gebrochts during Pesach, the custom is to specifically eat it on the 8th day. From <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/265990/jewish/Gebrokts-Wetted-Matzah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/265990/jewish/Gebrokts-Wetted-Matzah.htm</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the eighth day of Passover, which exists only outside the Land of Israel, the gebrokts stringency doesn’t apply, and all feast on matzah balls and matzah brei, and dip their matzah into soups and salads. In fact, many have the custom to try to eat their matzah with as many liquids and wet foods as possible.3</p>\n<p>The simple reason for this is that the celebration of the eighth day is of rabbinic origin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So what? I've learned, and <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99_%D7%A9%D7%9C_%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia agrees</a>, that the second day of Yom Tov is just as strict as the first.</p>\n<p>If the reason for the custom is that we are concerned that the matza isn't fully kneaded and can become chametz upon contact with water, why are we not concerned on the eighth day?</p>\n<p>I am interested more in answers based in halacha than chassidic ideas.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Although generally what you learned is correct, there are some exceptions. Specifically Shulchan Aruch mentions chometz-related leniencies for the last day of Pesach as the day was instituted because of doubt. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chok_Yaakov_on_Shulchan_Arukh%252C_Orach_Chayim.491?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chok Yaakov 491:1</a></p>\n<p>For example in OC 447:5 regarding food usually cooked in a chometz pot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן כל דבר שמבשלים בכלי חמץ כגון יין מבושל או מרקחת וכדומה אסור בפסח <strong>אבל ביו\"ט האחרון יש להקל בו</strong> (פסקי מהרא\"י סימן קע\"ז)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>467:8 regarding sugar:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצוקר אסור לאוכלו אפי' להשהותו אסור (ת\"ה סי' קי\"א) <strong>וביו\"ט האחרון אוכלין פירות יבשים וצוק\"ר קאנדי\"ל</strong> שאין בו חשש חימוץ (מהרי\"ל)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The source to be lenient comes from the Alter Rebbe in his halachic <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=25077&st=&pgnum=187\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshvos</a>:</p>\n<p>Therefore, based on this custom of Jews for centuries to be more lenient on the last day of Pesach in the Diaspora, the Alter Rebbe rules that one can also be lenient with regards to Gebroks. See the commentaries of the Shulchan Aruch for more detail.</p>\n<p>In addition the Lubavitcher Rebbe brings halachic and mystical explanations quoted in this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27565/6781\">answer</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70289/does-chabad-eat-gebrochts/70292#70292\">Does chabad eat gebrochts?</a> I point out that because this is a rabbinic prohibition and a minhag of stringency, the last day of Pesach is used to show that it is not a full prohibition of Chametz. There is also a spiritual meaning to this.  It appears that the eating the gebruchts in Chutz La'aretz is the significant point because the last day of Pesach is Yom Tov Sheni shel galyus. On the other hand, since the last (seventh) day in Eretz Yisrael is aYom Tov from the torah, then the leniency does not apply. Since I am only quoting chabad and do not have this minhag, then I cannot go any further than I have quoted. </p>\n\n<p>I have sen that some people have eaten gebrochts on the last day in order to show that it is a minhag, however, since those cited were in chutz la'aretz at the time, I cannot say what they would have done inside Eretz Yisael.</p>\n\n<p>The Vilna Gaon held that gebrochts is a minhag shtus and would dip matza in water to show that. However, any connection with the last day of Pesach is cited in error.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The simple reason for this is that the celebration of the eighth day\n  is of rabbinic origin.</p>\n  \n  <p>But there is also a spiritual reason given for eating gebrokts on the\n  eighth day:</p>\n  \n  <p>The last day of Passover is connected with the future redemption (see\n  Remembering the Future), a time when no evil will befall us. We\n  reflect this reality by going out of our way to eat gebrokts on this\n  day, without fear that the matzah may become chametz.</p>\n  \n  <p>Talk by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, of righteous memory, Acharon Shel\n  Pesach 5744.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Bnei Yissocher writes in Sefer Derech Pikudecha, Lo Ta’ase 12 that gebrokts is a chumrah . That chumra is not kept on the eighth  day of Pesach when it is D'Rabanon to make it clear that it is only a chumra and that those who eat it are not eating Chometz.</p>\n<p>There was probably  some need for some to eat gebrokts at the time it became widespread.  Therefore there  was also a concern of the risks of no one eating it. Therefore they made it clear that it was only a chumra so that those with a pressing need to eat it would ask a shaalo and not just assume that you can't do so out of life and death circumstances . That concern was not so big as to allow it on a day that Pesach is D'oyraisa</p>\n\n\n",

The point is that a wind could have blown and uncovered a ridge of land across the sea. Hashem took this and changed it to be sufficient for the entire Bnei Yisrael as well as adding the miracles specified by the midrashim. It also kept the Egyptians away until they crossed as well as making the timing exact.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=99580&page=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scientists Explain Red Sea Parting and Other Miracles</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the latest attempt to lend scientific credence to a supernatural\n  event, Naum Volzinger, a senior researcher at St. Petersburg's\n  Institute of Oceanography, and Alexei Androsov, a colleague based in\n  Hamburg, Germany, analyzed conditions that could have made the parting\n  of the Red Sea possible.</p>\n  \n  <p>As the biblical story goes: \"And Moses stretched out his hand over the\n  sea; and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all\n  that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Volzinger and Androsov calculated that a wind blowing at the speed of\n  67 miles per hour sustained overnight could have exposed a reef that\n  existed close below the ocean surface. The Israelites could have then\n  fled over the passage before the wind died down and waters rose again,\n  blocking the way for pursuing Egyptian soldiers in their wheeled\n  chariots.</p>\n  \n  <p>Volzinger explains that some 3,500 years ago, the reef would have been\n  closer to the water's surface so it would have been exposed for just\n  the right amount of time.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"It would take the Jews … four hours to cross the 7-kilometer reef\n  that runs from one coast to another,\" Volzinger told The Moscow Times.\n  \"Then, in half an hour, the waters would come back.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>A miracle? Perhaps. Great timing? Certainly, argues Colin Humphreys, a\n  physicist at Cambridge University in England and author of the book,\n  The Miracles of Exodus.</p>\n  \n  <p>\"I still say they're miracles,\" Humphreys said. \"But I think the\n  miracle is in the timing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/12/08/no-really-there-is-a-scientific-explanation-for-the-parting-of-the-red-sea-in-exodus/\" rel=\"nofollow\">There is a scientific explanation for the parting of the Red Sea in Exodus</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://gradworks.umi.com/14/68/1468999.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Application of storm surge modeling to Moses' crossing of the Red Sea</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Two case studies are presented. A reconstruction of the crossing of\n  the Red Sea by Moses and the Israelites, as described in Exodus 14,\n  shows that the eastern Nile delta of Egypt matches the Biblical\n  narrative and provides a hydrodynamic mechanism for water to remain on\n  both sides of the dry passage. The vulnerability of Manila Bay and the\n  surrounding areas to a Category 3 typhoon is evaluated and shows that\n  the simulated surge heights depend heavily on the wind direction and\n  the coastal topography.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0012481\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dynamics of Wind Setdown at Suez and the Eastern Nile Delta</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Under a uniform 28 m/s easterly wind forcing in the reconstructed\n  model basin, the ocean model produces an area of exposed mud flats\n  where the river mouth opens into the lake.

Yes, they didn’t kill the children, even though Pharaoh most likely threatened them with death; but even so, one has to be moser nefesh not to kill others (Yehareg Veal Yaavor, Sanhedrin 74a: \"one must rather be slain than commit murder\"; see <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904980/jewish/Yesodei-haTorah-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a>).

The actions of midwives were pure <em>mesirus nefesh</em>. While the principle <em>Yehareg Veal Yaavor</em> is simple on paper, it is difficut for anybody to do.

This kind of fear of God is not a minor accomplishment. Rabbi Yochanan Ben Zakai blessed the scholars before his death in masekhet Berachot<sup>(4)</sup> that they should have fear of God as they have natural fear of other men.

It seems this man had not yet died, but “he (Moshe) looked here and there” and saw that no good would come out of him, and therefore killed him (Shemos 2:12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויפן כה וכה וירא כי אין איש ויך את המצרי ויטמנהו בחול</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I imagine his mother and sister could also apply this sort of thinking. Pharaoh most likely did not expect or want  that the midwives kill all the males, as it would have made people suspicious. The midwives could have killed at least some of the boys, who they would not (prophetically) see any good could come out of them. As we know, during the plaque of Darkness, 4/5th of the people perished, so that there were many such potentially evil people. Even with that option, the midwives did not kill any of them. That is why they deserved such a reward.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# My Orthodox Jewish co-worker invited me to his wedding. Anything I should know about?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My Orthodox Jewish co-worker invited me to his wedding, but I've never been to a Jewish wedding before. Is there anything I should be aware about if I plan to attend?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 27)\n\n<p>Yes, there is plenty that is worth knowing ahead of time about Orthodox weddings. First, I'll talk a little about what will or might be expected from <em>you</em> at the wedding and then I'll talk a little about what to expect at a Jewish wedding and how it's different from a non-Jewish or non-Orthodox wedding (I'm assuming since you say you've never been to a <em>Jewish</em> wedding that you have been to non-Jewish weddings). I am not going to go into details of the wedding ceremony itself. Rather, I will give some practical advice for <em>you</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>Expectations of you</h1>\n<p>You won't have to worry too much about unexpectedly being asked to do something that you don't know how to do such as reading in Hebrew. The host of the wedding knows that you likely don't know how to do anything like that (and those honors are usually assigned ahead of time anyway).</p>\n<p>One thing that you will want to take into consideration is your dress. Just like attendees of non-Jewish weddings, we dress up at Jewish weddings. The level of formality varies. If the wedding invitation doesn't mention \"black tie\" or anything like that, a nice suit or women's equivalent will suffice. This standard is the same as for a non-Jewish wedding. The one difference is that Jews do observe modesty laws. In order to show respect, you should do so as well. For men it's pretty simple. A regular suit will pretty much satisfy the requirements. Men should cover their heads with a <em>kippah</em> which will likely be available at the wedding venue. For women, dresses and skirts are to be preferred over pants and they should come down at least to the knee (possibly to the ankle, depending on the crowd) while shoulders should definitely be covered (no \"strap\" dresses) and in many communities arms should be covered down to the elbow. Tops or dresses that are cut low in the front or back should be avoided. How out-of-place you will feel if you <em>don't</em> follow these guidelines depends very much on the crowd. If the couple is newly religious, many of the guests (including family) may not be following them. On the other hand, if both spouses come from long religious lines and live in a religious neighborhood it is likely that everyone will follow them strictly. If you have any questions, your host undoubtedly be happy to give you more personally-tailored details.</p>\n<p>Another point to note is that certain parts of the wedding may be separated by gender. It is very likely that the wedding dancing will be separate by gender, and the wedding ceremony itself may be as well. There are probably not going to be signs telling you where to go; just follow what everybody else is doing. If men and women are separating, go to the appropriate area.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>What to expect</h1>\n<p>In some ways Jewish weddings are similar to non-Jewish weddings, but in other ways they are very different. Usually the wedding will start with some time where the bride and groom are sitting in separate rooms and there is food in both. Where the guests go during this time varies; just do what everyone else is doing. In some cases, all of the men will be in the room with the groom while all the women will be in the room with the bride. In other cases, the room with the groom will have all of his close male friends and relatives while everyone else will be in the room with the bride. Again, just follow the crowd. If there's a large group of people of both genders hanging out and eating somewhere, that is definitely an appropriate place for you to be. Otherwise, find the place with people of your gender and help yourself to food. During this time, both spouses' parents will likely meet in the room with the groom and sign some documents. Then some other people will sign some documents. One last thing to note about this time: it usually lasts for quite a while... often an hour or more. It is not expected that you arrive at the very beginning of this time.</p>\n<p>After some time has passed, the groom will go see the bride and then everybody will move on to the place where the wedding ceremony itself will take place. For this, just follow the crowd. If people are sitting separately by gender at the ceremony, do so as well.</p>\n<p>Jewish wedding ceremonies are actually quite short. Often no more than 20 minutes or so. Some prayers and blessings will be said, a couple of songs will be sung, and someone might say a few words of Torah. Then the groom will step on and break a glass and that will be it. You don't have to do anything in particular during this time. Just sit and watch.</p>\n<p>Finally, the meal and dancing part of the wedding will occur. The bride and groom will be in seclusion for a few minutes together during which time an appetizer course is often served to the guests. Once the bride and groom come back into the room, the dancing will begin! Dancing will likely be separated by genders with a curtain or free-standing wall separating them. Go to the appropriate side and have fun! Dancing at Orthodox Jewish weddings is quite different from dancing at non-Jewish weddings. It is fast and frenetic and there is no slow-dancing. You definitely want to be wearing comfortable shoes. Jackets and ties often come off for this part and you can expect to sweat significantly if you participate. During a part of the dancing, there will be a moment when the bride and groom are brought to sit next to each other and people take turns doing silly things to entertain them. You can participate in this if you want if you are a man, though in many communities women do not participate. This is another one of those cases where you just see what others are doing.</p>\n<p>At some point during the wedding, an announcement might be made that people are going to take a break to pray. This could be at any of the transition points or possibly during the meal. The announcement might mention the words \"<em>mincha</em>,\" \"<em>ma'ariv</em>,\" or \"<em>daven</em>.\" If you aren't Jewish, you can ignore this announcement. If you are Jewish, you might want to join in the prayer. You can ask if someone has an extra prayer book (with an English translation, if you need it). Occasionally the prayer service might take place in the main room with everyone, though in my experience this is rare. If you are not Jewish and this happens, it's best to stand when people stand and sit when they sit. The prayer probably won't take more than 10 minutes.</p>\n<p>Once everything is done and the meal and dancing are over, everyone will say the Grace After Meals. There are a few special blessings at the end of this that are special for weddings. Usually these are assigned ahead of time, but in some cases they aren't. If someone asks you if you want to say one of the blessings but you are not Jewish or simply cannot read Hebrew, you can simply politely decline. Nobody will be offended.</p>\n<p>Typically the entire wedding will last somewhere between 3 and 6 hours.</p>\n<p>All of the above is typical of an Ashkenazi wedding in the United States. Ashkenazi weddings in Israel are likely to be similar though the dress is likely to be less formal if the families are not American immigrants to Israel (and possibly even if they are). In Israel it is relatively common for people who weren't invited to the wedding to show up after the meal to participate in the dancing. Some people might also be specifically invited to this part. If someone verbally invites you to \"come dance at my wedding,\" but doesn't send you a wedding invitation, this is likely what they mean.</p>\n<p>Finally, Sefardi weddings are quite different from Ashkenazi weddings. They are more likely to start late and much more likely to last <em>much</em> longer. In general, though, if you follow the rule of \"do what everyone else is doing,\" you will be able to get through any Jewish wedding and hopefully have a great time!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>To supplement, not supplant, <a href=\"/a/70817\">Daniel's good answer</a>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Orthodox Jewish weddings start late. (Even later, often, if the bride and groom are Sephardic.) This varies geographically; for example, in my experience, ceremonies start almost on time in St. Louis, Missouri, but as much as an hour later than scheduled in New York City and environs. It may also vary by other factors. You may wish to ask someone close to the bride or groom what to expect in this regard.</li>\n<li>(This one applies only if you read Hebrew and the wedding is of Chabad-Lubavitch folks.) Chabad-Lubavitch invitations in the United States are often bilingual in Hebrew and English, with different times listed on the Hebrew side and the English side. Ignore the time listed on the Hebrew side; the time listed on the English side is correct (but is then subject to the preceding item in this list about starting late).</li>\n<li>You will see people pouring water over their hands at the start of the meal. This is to fulfill a rule of Judaism about pouring water over one's hands before eating bread. If you're not Jewish, there's no reason for you to do it. If you are Jewish, and wish to honor the couple by doing something they would likely appreciate if they knew about it, then by all means go ahead. Probably someone standing around will be glad to show you how if you say something like \"What do I do here?\", but basically you fill a cup with clean water, pour it over all parts of your right hand, refill it if necessary, pour it over all parts of your left hand, and wipe them dry.</li>\n<li>Most Orthodox weddings in my experience do not have an elaborate or large wedding cake. However, you may possibly see slices of bread handed around, either near the start of the meal or soon after the first dance after the bride and groom join the meal; feel free to take or decline a slice without showing any offense.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Other items to add that MAY occur:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some have a custom that if the bride and / or groom is / are the last child being married, they will do a \"mezinkeh\" ceremony. Customs on this vary, somewhat. Usually, the mother of the child wears a wreath on her head, and people dance with the parents and bride / groom to a special tune. Often, one of the dancers brings a broom to symbolize \"sweeping the house clean\".</p></li>\n<li><p>Some \"yeshivish\" weddings have extra dancing after the Grace after meals where certain friends are invited for a \"chassunah tanse\". These friends are not invited for the rest of the wedding, but they come at the end to dance with the couple.</p></li>\n<li><p>While not <strong>directly</strong> wedding related, if you are comfortable enough and on a good friendship with the groom or bride's parents, you could ask if you can take any untouched deserts. I mention this having had a lot of experience attending many weddings and my family knowing many caterers. Because of health rules, once a cake comes out of the box, even if untouched, it must be disposed afterwards. This is a shameful waste of food. So, if your host permits an you can use it, ask. If you can't personally use it, think of a friend, needy person or synagogue that can. (I've donated items to a neighborhood family who was extremely grateful. Turned out that they were planning an engagement party a day later.) </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The Torah unites them and also separates them. The two birds represent wholeness and the heavenly realm. Judah inherits Hebron that Abraham paid for, while Joseph inherits Shechem that Jacob paid for.

Look at Genesis 13:10.</p>\n<p>In the next chapter (Genesis 16) after the covenant of cut pieces (Genesis 15), Abraham has relations with Hagar, an Egyptian slave. Almost like Abraham is believing in the reality of Egypt and slavery in order to be fruitful.

The covenant between the pieces refers to division, and the covenant of circumcision refers to closer examination.</p>\n<p>There's emphasis on the number \"four\" with this covenant. There's two rows of four. 3 halves of the animals on each side, plus the whole bird on each side. Genesis 15:13, Genesis 15:16, and Exodus 20:5 all mention \"four\". Abraham through Joseph is four generations, hence it refers to the covenant of cut pieces.</p>\n<p>I think Abraham is actually asking \"when\" he shall possess the land in Genesis 15:8. And God responds with the symbolism of the covenant. Genesis 15:18 God says to Abraham, \"To your offspring, I assign this land.\"</p>\n\n\n",

And to what are they referring? </p>\n\n<p>And what does the Torah mean when it calls the Shabbat a \"Shabbat-Shabbaton\" <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9924#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vayikra 23:3</a> for example? </p>\n\n<p>What does the term Shabbaton add to the term Shabbat in its meaning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In connection with most verses in the Tenach Shabat seems to be a term, which is often linked with the seventh day (the day from sundown fridaynight till  sundown saturday night; it was evening it was morning; the seventh day), from the roos Shavat which literally means to 'cease', to 'end' (with work) and from these derived 'rest'. It is the day of rest or ceasing with the result in having to stop or rest from work. The Shabat is the day on which HaShem (the seventh) ceased working and “rested.”</p>\n\n<p>Shabatot is the plural form of Shabat.</p>\n\n<p>Shabaton by its ending -on seems to be some kind of Qal pa'al form, while Shabat is a piel form. So one is intensive action while the other denotes a normal action. A rest/ceasing v.s. a complete and total rest/ceasing. </p>\n\n<p>So Shabat Shabaton is a day of rest and ceasing with the meaning of an absolute rest and ceasing from work. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>\"Shabbatot\" is the plural form of Shabbat (\"-ot\" is the plural feminine postfix, whereas \"-im\" is the masculine).</p>\n\n<p>\"Shabbaton\" is the Hebrew word from which we get \"Sabbatical\". It is a period of time required to allow agricultural fields to be left fallow. It was adopted as the term for time allowing for humans to rest and rejuvenate.</p>\n\n<p>The word comes from the root \"SH.V.T\", which I believe generally means sit or rest, with rest being the context-appropriate translation (\"day of rest\"), as per the commandment forbidding work on Saturday in honor of the seventh day of creation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Shalom. According to Lv 23:2,3, though, it seems that there is no substantial difference between shabbat and miqra qodesh. Shabbat is miqra qodesh, and vice versa, both being shabbat shabbathon. Am I right?</p>\n\n\n",

People use it to describe a particular standard, or they might mean a general term for one or several hechsherim (kosher supervisions) e.g. Bedatz Eida Chareidis, Rav Landau, Rav Rubin, Sheeris Yisrael, Rav Machpud etc. The term can also be used by a local rabbinate hechsher to denote a higher level than their usual standard. In other words, it can mean anything or nothing. There is no universal standard. A person needs to ask the specific organization(s) what they mean by mehadrin - this can include not relying on heter mechira, a mashgiach temidi, more careful checking of bugs in vegetables and grains, using \"bug free\" leafy vegetables, chalav Yisroel, glatt meat, slower and more careful shechita and kashering, using milk only from Shomer Shabbos farms, checking if fruit is orla rather than relying on the majority of that species, etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>Badatz, as previous posters have mentioned, is the name of several organizations. The Badatz Eida Chareidis, Badatz Mehadrin (Rav Rubin), and others. Again, each has their own standards, and can be asked.

If people don't labor and work throughout the six days of the week, do they *deserve* Shabbat?\n<p>What about people who are unemployed and idle -- but \"idle\" in the sense that, even though have degrees and are very well qualified for work in several fields, they simply haven't found employment opportunities for many months, due to the jobs market's high competition and saturation? Do they have to find some kind of \"work\" in order to \"deserve\" Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Without commenting on the specific situation, shabbat's rest is an absolute obligation which doesn't depend on what one does during the week. Whether one worked or rested during the work, one needs to abstain from creative work (melacha) on shabbat. Shabbat is not observed because it is a reward but because God commanded so, as a memory for the creation of the world.</p>\n\n<p>The issue of idleness (that you bring in the comments) is interesting. Judaism puts quite some emphasis on avoiding <em>bitul zman</em> (wasting one's time). As we say in the prayer Uva Lzion every day (translation Artscroll)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>May He (God) open our heart to his Torah and imbue our heart with awe\n  and love of him and the desire to do his will and to serve him with a\n  wholesome heart <strong>so that we do not toil in vain nor produce for\n  futility</strong> (see also <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.65.23?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isaiah 65:23</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To bring both topics together, one interesting idea I heard about shabbat is that the laws of shabbat are modeled after the laws of the creation of the sanctuary (<em>mishkan</em>) in the desert. Technically because the verses commanding shabbat are juxtaposed with the creation of the <em>mishkan</em> (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.31?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemot 31</a>). But more fundamentally because, just as God stopped His work (creating a home for man in the world) after six days, man stops his work after six days. What is man's primary work? Creating a home for God in the world, through Torah and <em>mitzvot</em> (commandments). I now saw a similar idea much more beautifully described <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/meaning-in-mitzvot/39-forbidden-shabbat-melachot/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> by R Asher Meir.</p>\n\n<p>So idleness (<em>bitul zman</em>), in the sense of not learning Torah and performing mitzvot, is definitely something to improve on, even if shaming people in public is definitely not the way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The \"work\" forbidden on Shabbat does not mean hard, physical work or employment. It is \"melacha\" = creative work. There are 39 main categories of melacha <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Index_of_Laws_of_Shabbat_by_the_39_Melachot\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Index_of_Laws_of_Shabbat_by_the_39_Melachot</a></p>\n\n<p>So, even if Shabbat would be a \"reward\" for working the other 6 days (and there is no mention of this - every Jew is obligated to keep Shabbat), that would mean it is a reward for doing \"melacha\" e.g. writing, selection (throwing out the bad apples in the bag), cooking (heating water in a kettle for a cup of coffee) etc.</p>\n\n<p>Also, \"by the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread\" (Genesis 3:19) is a curse, not a commandment. And a person does not need to work physically to accomplish things.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I do not understand what you are saying synagogues and congratulations</p>\n\n<p>But for part 2 you are probably referring to the saying of our sages</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avoda Zara 3a</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The nations will then plead.

Nevertheless, one\n  must follow stringencies based on the opinions that counting is a\n  Torah mitzvah.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) Rishonim also dispute whether or not a distinct mitzvah of\n  counting the Omer applies each day, or whether the entire counting\n  period is included in one continuous mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://binyanhaolam.com/online-courses/festivals/sefiras-haomer/laws-and-customs-of-the-omer-period/#A_Separate_Mitzvah_Count_Each_Day_or_One_49_Day_Counting_Mitzvah\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Separate Mitzvah Count Each Day or One 49 Day Counting Mitzvah?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is quite an interesting discussion amongst the Gaonim and\n  Rishonim regarding the nature of the counting of the Omer in terms of\n  seeing each day as a separate mitzvah or seeing the entire 7 weeks as\n  one big mitzvah. There are three main approaches in the Rishonim to\n  this question.</p>\n  \n  <p>Tosafos [23], The Rosh [24], and Rav Hai Gaon [25] explain that there is no\n  clear indication in the verses to support the conclusion that this is\n  one 49 Day Mitzvah. Rather each day of counting is a mitzvah in its\n  own right. The concept of temimos indicates that the counting should\n  be done at night and perhaps has other ramifications but isn’t\n  relevant to this particular point.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Yehudai Gaon [26] explains that due to the tenet of temimos the\n  entire counting of all 49 days must also be complete. That is to say\n  that if a person misses counting one day out of the 49 he has thus\n  lost the entire mitzvah of counting the Omer.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Sadyah Gaon [27] takes a position somewhat in the middle. He agrees\n  with Rav Yehudai Gaon to a degree that all 49 days are bound together\n  as one and require temimos. However, the limit of this qualification\n  is only with regards to starting the count on the 16th of Nissan. If a\n  person counts the first night of the Omer correctly, then even if he\n  misses other nights during the rest of the 49 days we look at it as if\n  he is “still in the process of counting 49 days from the 16th of\n  Nissan. However, if a person missed counting the first night on the\n  16th of Nissan then he has lost the entire opportunity to fulfill this\n  mitzvah for this year. The reason is because once he missed the first\n  night we can no longer see him as being “in the process” of counting\n  the 49 days from the 16th of Nissan until Shavuos.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Shulchan Aruch [28] writes that the halacha lemaseh is that if a\n  person missed a day of counting (both night and subsequent day) he\n  must still keep counting for the rest of the 49 days but he may not\n  make a blessing out of deference to the opinions that this is One 49\n  Day Mitzvah.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Terumas Hadeshen [29] writes that if a person has a doubt as to\n  whether he counted on a particular day (i.e. he is truly uncertain one\n  way or another whether he counted) in such a case since there is a\n  double doubt he may continue to count on the remaining days with a\n  blessing. The rationale is that maybe the halacha follows the Tosafos\n  and the Rosh, and even if it follows the Gaonim it is possible that he\n  counted yesterday. This is in fact the halacha Lemaseh found in\n  Shulchan Aruch30).</p>\n  \n  <p>Another outgrowth of this disagreement relates to a person who\n  converted to Judaism or even a young boy he became 13 during the\n  middle of the Omer period. According to the view that it is a separate\n  mitzvah each day then he may surely count from the point at which he\n  becomes obligated in mitzvos. If it is one long 49 day mitzvah then\n  how can he achieve temimos in which case he should count the rest of\n  the time without a bracha.</p>\n  \n  <p>The prevailing custom regarding a Bar Mitzvah is that provided he\n  started the count when he was still before Bar Mitzvah he can continue\n  the rest of the count with a bracha. The rationale here is that\n  perhaps the halacha is like those who say each day is a separate\n  mitzvah and furthermore, there are poskim who add another facet that\n  since until now the boy wasn’t obligated, so from here on if he counts\n  without missing that is called temimos for him.</p>\n  \n  <p>[23].     ↑   Gemara Menachos 66a “Zecher” and Megillah 20b “Kol Halaylah”<br>\n  [24].     ↑   Pesachim Ch 10 Siman 41<br>\n  [25].     ↑   See Maharitz Geus Vol 2 pg 109 and Tshuvos Hagaonim Vol 2 pg 212<br>\n  [26].     ↑   Ba’al Halachos Gedolos “Atzeres”<br>\n  [27].     ↑   Sidddur Harasag pg 155<br>\n  [28].     ↑   Orach Chaim 489:8<br>\n  [29].     ↑   Vol 1 Siman 37  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/mitzvah306/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The obligation to count the Omer</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Biblically, it only applies in Temple times (when the Omer offering\n  is brought) but we continue to perform it today by rabbinic enactment.\n  This mitzvah is discussed in the Talmud in tractate Menachos on page\n  66a and is codified in the Shulchan Aruch in Orach Chaim 489. It is #161\n  of the 248 positive mitzvos in the Rambam’s Sefer HaMitzvos and #26 of the\n  77 positive mitzvos that can be fulfilled today as listed in the Chofetz\n  Chaim’s Sefer HaMitzvos HaKatzar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://torah.org/torah-portion/perceptions-5761-bamidbar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefiras Haomer</a> Connects thie mitzvah of Sefiras Haomer to the mitzvah of tefillin. Rabbi Winston explains that the mitzvah of tefillin is renewed each day that that there is no question about saying the bracha even if a day has been missed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At the root of this discussion is one’s understanding of the mitzvah\n  of Sefiras HaOmer: is it one long, continuous mitzvah with fifty\n  parts, or, does each day’s counting stand as a separate mitzvah? If\n  the former, then the blessing has been lost because the mitzvah is no\n  longer complete (though you still count each subsequent day without\n  its blessing); if the latter, then, what was, was, but, what is coming\n  up is what counts now and therefore, say the blessing.</p>\n  \n  <p>When it comes to Tefillin, a mitzvah that is also performed most days,\n  missing one day does not change tomorrow’s obligation in any way. What\n  was missed is lost, but, every new day is a new chance to do the same\n  mitzvah, and therefore all blessings must be said. How many single\n  mitzvos are there that are performed over such a long period of time?</p>\n  \n  <p>Halachically, we have decided to treat Sefiras HaOmer, which lasts\n  over FORTY-NINE days, like a single mitzvah, which means miss a day,\n  lose the blessing for the rest of the counting. It’s a phenomenal\n  concept which certainly puts pressure on males to make sure that, for\n  forty-nine days, they do not forget to count the omer — which some do,\n  for one reason or another!</p>\n  \n  <p>However, one can understand why when comparing the mitzvah of\n  Tefillin, for example, and, the mitzvah to count the omer. Tefillin is\n  the same mitzvah each and every day, though, one should be using that\n  ‘same mitzvah’ to grow spiritually so that, the next time Tefillin are\n  worn, it is a different, spiritually more elevated act than all other\n  times before. However, the actual performance of the mitzvah remains\n  the same.</p>\n  \n  <p>Not so with Sefiras HaOmer, for, though each day the counting-process\n  is the same, the wording is different for each count, revealing an\n  obvious build-up toward the holiday of Shavuos. The Omer-Count is a\n  spiritual construction process, whereby the end result justifies all\n  the ‘work’ and ‘expenditure’ until that end-result is realized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In his \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0899069088\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ha-Mo'adim Ba-Halakha</a>\", Rav Shlomo Yosef Zevin discusses this question (\"בגדר תמימות בספירת העומר\"):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if one knows that he will not be able to count one day during sefirah, does he start counting anyhow or not? </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This would only be a question according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_Kayyara\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Behag</a>, who holds that if you miss one day you cannot continue counting (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.66a.16?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Menachot.66a.16.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos in Menachos 66a</a>).<br>\nHowever according to all the rishonim who argue with the Behag, obviously one would count all the days that he can even if he will miss a day in the middle. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Zevin explains that <strong>even according to the Behag, this is not one mitzvah</strong> (if it was, why would we make a separate berakha each night?). <strong>Rather, each night is a separate mitzvah of counting, but there is a halakha that there must be continuity in the counting.</strong> This is what תמימות means--the count is not isolated but continuous.

According to this interpretation, one who e.g. knows he will have surgery in the middle of sefirat ha-omer and therefore miss an entire day should begin counting without a berakha. </p>\n\n\n",

They explain the word ki without mentioning the Gemara.<br>\nI asked myself if the Statement of Resh Lakish is only mnemonic, witch is not shown as \"Haatakat Shmua\"; if so, I am not surprised by the \"omission\". Perhaps Resh Lakish have a \"key\" to understand halachot in verses, as a Kabala from generations. So it is strange that Rishonim do not show that they comply with Resh Lakish.<br>\nWhen we look the examples, obviously nothing is contradictory with R.L. But we see that Rashi is being made to refer to Resh Lakish, e.g. when he say that \"כי\" is \"אשר\", Rashi says that \"אשר\" is included in \"אי\"‎<sup>[1]</sup>. It is important for him, but not for Radak and R.I.

The discussion focuses on the activities that you mentioned, namely, shaving, haircuts, and listening to music. Every opinion that I have seen including Shulchan Aruch prohibits weddings (except for an \"emergency such as if a shidduch were to be cancelled b/c of a long engagement.)</p>\n\n<p>I've seen no opinion nor have I heard of anyone that prohibits sports games, either individually or as a team.</p>\n\n<p>One common denominator to deciding what is prohibited was established by Rav Soloveichik who said:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>that the aveilut customs observed during the period of the Omer, as\n  well as those observed during Bein Ha-Metzarim, must conform to some\n  prior halakhic pattern.   He notes that in the laws of aveilut, we\n  generally speak of three periods of mourning: shiva (the seven day\n  period after the burial), sheloshim (the thirty days after burial),\n  and the yud-bet chodesh (the twelve month period after the death of a\n  parent).  R. Soloveitchik maintained that the mourning practices of\n  Sefirat Ha-Omer conform to the halakhic category of “yud-bet chodesh,”\n  the twelve month period of mourning for one’s parent. Indeed, the laws\n  that characterize the yud-bet chodesh include the prohibition of\n  attending a “beit ha-mishteh” (Mo’ed Katan 22b; Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh\n  De’ah 391) and taking a haircut (Mo’ed Katan 22b, Shulchan Arukh,\n  Yoreh Deah 390:4; Rama), similar to the original two laws mentioned by\n  the Geonim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Emanating from this principle, the article states, further:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If so, then the Geonim fundamentally only prohibited social\n  gatherings, known as simchat meri’ut.  Therefore, while a concert\n  might be prohibited, privately listening to music, or even attending a\n  movie, certainly is not.  Furthermore, social gatherings, even without\n  music, such as a baseball game, may also be prohibited, against the\n  view of the Magen Avraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the last part about ball games and concerts is disputed, as well.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, that attending public ball games, MAY cause a type of prohibited joy. I'm assuming this may be because the nature of being at such an event with a large public crowd cheering a team may cause this \"joy problem\". </p>\n\n\n",

He too went up after her in his desire to sit naked with\n  her, when all of a sudden the four fringes [of his garment] struck him across the face; whereupon he\n  slipped off and sat upon the ground. She also slipped off and sat upon the ground and said, ‘By the\n  Roman Capitol, I will not leave you alone until you tell me what blemish you saw in me. ‘By the\n  Temple’, he replied, ‘never have I seen a woman as beautiful as you are; but there is one precept\n  which the Lord our God has commanded us, it is called zizith, and with regard to it the expression ‘I\n  am the Lord your God’ is twice written, signifying, I am He who will exact punishment in the\n  future, and I am He who will give reward in the future.

She said, ‘I will not leave you until you tell me your name, the\n  name of your town, the name of your teacher, the name of your school in which you study the\n  Torah’. He wrote all this down and handed it to her. Thereupon she arose and divided her estate into\n  three parts; one third for the government, one third to be distributed among the poor, and one third\n  she took with her in her hand; the bed clothes, however, she retained. She then came to the Beth\n  Hamidrash of R. Hiyya, and said to him, ‘Master, give instructions about me that they make me a\n  proselyte’. ‘My daughter’, he replied; ‘perhaps you have set your eyes on one of the disciples?’ She\n  thereupon took out the script and handed it to him. ‘Go’, said he ‘and enjoy your acquisition’. Those\n  very bed-clothes which she had spread for him for an illicit purpose she now spread out for him\n  lawfully.

If he finds in them of the evil, he should then contemplate and\n  investigate, reasoning out a strategy to employ in order to turn away\n  from that evil and cleanse himself of it....</li></ol></li></ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>then later on says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our sages of blessed memory taught us explicitly the need for this\n  accounting as they said: \" 'therefore the rulers say, let us enter\n  into an accounting' (Numbers 21:27). Therefore the rulers - of their\n  [evil] inclinations said come and consider the accounting of the world\n  - the loss incurred by doing a mitzva against the gain earned through it, and the gain obtained by doing a sin against the loss incurred...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>how is this an \"explicit\" instruction of what he said previously?</p>\n\n<p>the former is about examining one's personal deeds whereas this is about weighing generally the reward/loss of a mitzva against a sin</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You seem to be reading the last paragraph quoted not in the proper context.</p>\n\n<p>The opening of the chapter (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Messilat_Yesharim.3.1-6?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:1-6</a>) is the detailed explanation of the <em>process</em> of watchfulness (<em>what you are being watchful about, that it relates to what you are actually doing, and that your actions should be deliberate</em>).</p>\n\n<p>Then, toward the end of the chapter, in the paragraph just before the last paragraph you quote (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Messilat_Yesharim.3.11-13?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:11-13</a>), Ramchal summarizes the chapter by saying the concept of watchfullness needs to be a regular accounting (<em>literally each day</em>) like a successful business person who regularly and accurately calculates their income, costs and expenses.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>יא</strong> כלל הדבר: יהיה האדם מעיין על מעשיו כולם, ומפקח על כל דרכיו שלא להניח לעצמו הרגל רע ומדה רעה, כל שכן עבירה ופשע.\n  <strong>יב</strong> <strong><em>והנני רואה צורך לאדם שיהיה מדקדק</em></strong> ושוקל דרכיו <strong><em>דבר יום ביומו</em></strong> <strong>כסוחרים הגדולים</strong> אשר יפלסו תמיד כל עסקיהם למען לא יתקלקלו, ויקבע עתים ושעות לזה שלא יהיה משקלו עראי, אלא בקביעות גדול, כי רב התולדה הוא.\n  <strong>יג</strong> <strong>וחכמים זכרונם לברכה הורונו בפירוש צורך החשבון הזה,</strong> והוא מה שאמרו ז\"ל (בבא בתרא עח):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And it is this <strong><em>regular, daily accounting</em></strong> that the Sages taught us explicitly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.78b.12-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Bathra 78b</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The last paragraph you quote is then saying that the Sages state the frequency of this trait of watchfulness in Ramchal's summary explicitly, meaning in clear and unambiguous language. They call the process literally \"accounting\" and put it in terms of a daily profit and loss assessment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The advice of making a cheshbono shel olam seems to be to treat religion as you would a business, which requires a profit and loss statement to know if the business is heading in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>Once you accept that premise you will keep the company ledger in mind when performing a mitzva or aveira, and do an end-of-day profit and loss statement which you can analyse to improve future profitability.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This passage is hard to decipher.</p>\n\n<p>The Chazal of \"המושלים ביצרם...‏\" comes after the advice given to make Cheshbon Hanefesh.<br>\nSo, apparently, the Moshlim talk about this issue: What is happened in past activities? </p>\n\n<p>But the author explains that the good  outcome  of Cheshbon Hanefesh is also to reach  an improvement for  future actions.</p>\n\n<p>When the Ramchal marvels reading this statements, he shows that only a \"Moshel\" can clearly distinguish between Good and Evil as every body can look at a concrete object. Average persons have not  yet a such acuity. We know what is Avera and what is mitsva. We know about Sachar and Onesh. But we do not feel nothing. </p>\n\n<p>This advice is as a compass.

This will redirect you to choose Mitsva and avoid Avera.\n<br></p>\n\n<p>So the advice of Moshlim apply to the whole topic above. </p>\n\n<p>The parable of the labyrinth explains that Moshlim point essentially what we have to do in immediate future, following  the compass. </p>\n\n<p>Further in chapter 4, the author, in the passage \"עומק הדין עד היכן מגיע\", comes back to this issue and we can understand that a retrospective Cheshbon Hanefesh is also enlightening for the future decisions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion: The advice is to look from the  reward/damage point of view. This  is a very efficient way witch lead  to victory against Yetser Hara.</strong></p>\n\n<p>This topic is explicitly explained in Mishna Avot 2, 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וֶהֱוֵי מְחַשֵּׁב הֶפְסֵד מִצְוָה כְּנֶגֶד שְׂכָרָהּ, וּשְׂכַר עֲבֵרָה כְּנֶגֶד הֶפְסֵדָהּ. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If we look at the whole statement in Talmud \n<a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_rashi.php?ms=Baba-Bathra&df=78b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\nhere</p>\n\n<p></a></p>\n\n<p>we understand perfectly: If you make this, you are  building yourself...</p>\n\n<p>But to see what is Mitsva and Avera we need priorly to study Torah (תורה מביאה לידי זהירות), nothing else can help.</p>\n\n\n",

They should have a stable source of income so it doesn't feel as if they need each other (kind of like a business/income/employability that is seen to be value for money).</p>\n\n<p>The quote about not being slaves of slaves means an Eved Ivri that has specific laws.</p>\n\n<p>The Chovas Halevovos teaches a person how to figure out which job would suit different natures, and encourages people to seek a Parnasa opportunity that matches what they do best. </p>\n\n<p>Learning Parshas Hamon daily, in which we find people worried about needing sustenance and then being fed by Hashem, is a well-known segula for getting money - maybe without needing \"employment\", or perhaps will help him find a way to contribute to the work force in a way he finds valuable.</p>\n\n<p>And, as many will remember, a Tzadik would get his Mon portion close to his tent, others had to go further. So if your only option is distant, challenging, or slave-like, take it if you can, because having money can cure so many other problems, but keep asking G-d to assist you in getting to the level at which you deserve to spend less time or emotional energy in the earning thereof.</p>\n\n<p>The more money one has earned and put away, the more likely one to be able to do business. The more one shows up to work reliably, the more likely others will invest through him. So even if self-employed is theoretically better (and I haven't seen convincing proof that that's so), a way to get there may be to get any employment in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The passuk says in Bereishis, vayishalech Chanoch es elokim ve'eneno ki le'kacho elokim.

    "content": "# Splitting up Kadosh Kadosh Kadosh\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The pasuk we quote in Kedusha from Yeshayahu 6:3 reads וְקָרָ֨א זֶ֤ה אֶל־זֶה֙ וְאָמַ֔ר קָד֧וֹשׁ ׀ קָד֛וֹשׁ קָד֖וֹשׁ יְהוָ֣ה צְבָא֑וֹת מְלֹ֥א כָל־הָאָ֖רֶץ כְּבוֹדֽוֹ׃</p>\n\n<p>In this pasuk, the image I understand is the Seraphim singing the praises of Hashem. They turn to each other and say \"Holy.\"</p>\n\n<p>The trope seems to connect the first 2 iterations of \"kadosh\" which would make sense if we imagine the Seraphim speaking one to the other and then the other to the first. The third \"kadosh\" would be a statement said in unison introducing the final concept. The darga-tvir combination seems distinct from the tipcha-munach-etnachta. The meaning would then be (as Chabad's translation has it) \"\"Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Hosts;\" </p>\n\n<p>When it is read, then, there should be a slight pause between the second and third statements, but I often hear people singing and reciting the three \"Kadosh\" statements together and then starting \"hashem tzeva-ot\" as a new phrase.</p>\n\n<p>The Koren siddur, in the bracha of Yotzer Ohr for weekdays has a comma after the first 2 \"Kadosh\" statements and then none after the third, allowing it to run into the \"hashem...\" statement. In Kedusha for shacharit, though, there is a comma after each of the three and this is also the case in the Kedusha Desidra. My Siddur Tefillah Hashalem has 3 commas in Kedushat Yotzer and 1 comma in the shmoneh esrei -- after the third Kadosh. The first Artscroll I found (and I don't know if there is consistency across Artscroll texts) was the Machzor for Sukkot and it has no commas.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a difference in meaning intended by different ways of splitting up the three words?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Actually, tipcha is a bigger break than tevir, and even bigger than revii (even though many people don't read it that way).  The side of the Tikkun Simanim points out places where it makes a difference to the meaning.  One major case is in Reeh 12:2.  A more recent place, where it's simpler to see the meaning although I don't think the Simanim says anything there, is in the maftir of Pesach (Pinchas 28:20):</p>\n\n<p>וּמִ֨נְחָתָ֔ם סֹ֖לֶת בְּלוּלָ֣ה בַשָּׁ֑מֶן שְׁלֹשָׁ֨ה עֶשְׂרֹנִ֜ים לַפָּ֗ר וּשְׁנֵ֧י עֶשְׂרֹנִ֛ים לָאַ֖יִל תַּֽעֲשֽׂוּ׃</p>\n\n<p>Because the tipcha is the biggest break after the etnachta, תעשו is going back on the menachot for both the bulls and the ram.</p>\n\n<p>That means that the 3 times קדוש should be together, with a small break for the tevir and an even smaller one for the psik.</p>\n\n<p>I think this is the same as what Chabad means.  English punctuation and trop are not fully compatible with each other.  In English we put commas in lists of more than two things (holy isn't a \"thing,\" but you get the idea), and we only put commas after a list in places where they would be required even if there was only one item.  In Tanach, because the list belongs together, we put a bigger separation after the list.</p>\n\n<p>For example, try days 2-7 of Sukkot, also in Pinchas:</p>\n\n<p>וּמִנְחָתָ֣ם וְנִסְכֵּיהֶ֡ם לַ֠פָּרִים לָֽאֵילִ֧ם וְלַכְּבָשִׂ֛ים בְּמִסְפָּרָ֖ם כַּמִּשְׁפָּֽט׃\n(with small changes for the different days)</p>\n\n<p>לאילם does not have a pausing trop.  לפרים does have a weak pause on Sukkot (not even that on Shemini Atzeret), but the stronger pauses are before (pazer) and after (tevir) the list.</p>\n\n<p>(במספרם has an even stronger stop (tipcha) because it's going on the animals, not on the menachot.  This is another good example where reading it wrong changes the meaning.)</p>\n\n\n",

They were of different kinds; some of them atoned\n  for defilement caused ignorantly, others for defilement caused\n  knowingly. For this purpose were brought the goats on the Festivals\n  and the New-moon days (Num. xxviii. 15, 27, etc.), and the goat sent\n  away on the Day of Atonement (Lev. xvi. 16), as is explained in its\n  place (Mishnah Shebnot, i. 4). These sacrifices serve to prevent those\n  who defiled the Sanctuary of the Lord knowingly from thinking that\n  they had not done a great wrong; they should know that they obtained\n  atonement by the sacrifice of the goat, as the Law says, \"That they\n  die not in their uncleanness\" (Lev. xv. 31); \"That Aaron may bear the\n  iniquity of the holy things\" (Exod. xxviii. 38).

That is why we stopped the yovel once the tribes of Reuven, Gad, and the part of Menashe that lived on the eastern side of the Jorden were sent into exile. </p>\n\n<p>There are those that say that the Shmitta is rabbinic only as a result of this.

The majority of rabbis hold that the jubilee year\n  was an intercalation, and followed the seventh Sabbatical year, making\n  two fallow years in succession.After both had passed, the next cycle\n  began. They adduce this theory from the plain words of the Law to\n  \"hallow the fiftieth year,\" and also from the assurance of God's\n  promise of a yield in the sixth year sufficient for maintenance during\n  the following three years, \"until the ninth year, until her fruits\n  come in\" (Lev. xxv. 22), which, they say, refers to the jubilee year.\n  Judah ha-Nasi, however, contends that the jubilee year was identical\n  with the seventh Sabbatical year (R. H. 9a; Giṭ. 36a; comp. Rashi ad\n  loc.). The opinion of the Geonim and of later authorities generally\n  prevails, that the jubilee, when in force during the period of the\n  First Temple, was intercalated, but that in the time of the Second\n  Temple, when the jubilee was observed only \"nominally,\" it coincided\n  with the seventh Sabbatical year. In post-exilic bṭimes the jubilee\n  was entirely ignored, though the strict observance of the shemiṭṭah\n  was steadily insisted upon. This, however, is only according to a\n  rabbinical enactment (Tos. to Giṭ. 36a, s.v. \"Bizeman\"), as by the\n  Mosaic law, according to R. Judah, shemiṭṭah is dependent on the\n  jubilee and ceases to exist when there is no jubilee (Giṭ. l.c. and\n  Rashi ad loc.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is part of why Hillel could make the takkana about pruzbul while the second temple was in existence. Rambam states (Halacha 7) that when the Yovel was in effect, the 49th year of a cycle was the shemittah, year 50 was the Yovel, and year 51 was the start of the next cycle. Halacha 3 says that they did this during the second temple era <strong>even though</strong> they did not observe the Yovel. Halacha 5 says that when the temple is not in existence, then only the seven year shmittah cycles are counted and the youvel year is not counted. That is why we divide the year number by 7 and get the number of the shmitta cycle year (5775%7=0 - this is a shmittah year).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1007174/jewish/Shemita-Chapter-10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Hilchos Shemita - Chapter 10:8</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Halacha 8</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>From the time the tribes of Reuven and Gad and half the tribe of\n  Menasheh were exiled,26 [the observance] of the Jubilee year ceased,\n  as [implied by Leviticus 25:10]: \"You shall proclaim freedom\n  throughout the land to all of its inhabitants.\" [One can infer that\n  this commandment applies only] when all of its inhabitants are\n  dwelling within it.

For whatever is not in the\n  category of [permitted which is] \"sufficient\", and is either\n  superfluous or deficient, must necessarily belong to the category of\n  what is commanded, if done for the sake of G-d; or it belongs to the\n  category of the forbidden, if it is not done for His sake.</p>\n  \n  <p>Enquiring more closely into what is \"sufficient\", for example, in\n  obtaining a livelihood, we find this too in a commandment, set forth\n  in the account of Creation, \"And G-d blessed them, and G-d said unto\n  them: 'Be fruitful and multiply, fill the land and conquer it.'\"\n  (Genesis 1:28). And it continues, \"Behold, I have given you every herb\n  bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth [.. to you it\n  shall be for food]\" (ibid. 1:29). Hence, to seek a sufficiency in food\n  belongs to the class of the commanded.</p>\n  \n  <p>This being the case, <strong>it has been demonstrated that all human\n  activities are either in the category of what is commanded or in the\n  category of what is prohibited</strong>. If what is done is in the category of\n  the commanded, it is a good deed. If one is able to do it but neglects\n  his obligation, he falls short in his duty. So, too, if one does one\n  of the things that are prohibited, he is a sinner. If he abstains from\n  doing it, he is a righteous man, provided that he abstains out of fear\n  of G-d, as Scripture says, \"They also do no iniquity. They walk in His\n  ways.\" (Tehilim 119:3).</p>\n  \n  <p>And so, if one does one of the things permitted, in the right and\n  proper way, he is righteous, as the Psalmist said, \"A good man is\n  gracious and lends; he conducts his affairs with measure\" (Tehilim\n  112:5). If he, however, exceeds and goes beyond what is sufficient, he\n  falls short in his duty, because this will mislead him to what G-d\n  warned against. So, too, if he denies himself what is sufficient when\n  he is in a position to obtain it, his aim being to train himself in\n  the service of G-d and to reign over his lusts, so as to come nearer\n  to G-d or separate himself from this world and direct his attentions\n  to the better world hereafter, he is righteous and his conduct is\n  good. But if he does this not for the sake of G-d, he falls short in\n  the fulfillment of his duty, and his conduct is reprehensible.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hence, human actions fall into the categories of good and bad. The\n  intelligent person is one who weighs his actions before he does them,\n  as is here set forth, examines them carefully with his mind and\n  recognition, chooses what is good among them and abandons what is not\n  good, as David, peace be unto him, said: \"I thought on my ways and\n  turned my feet unto Your testimonies. I made haste and did not delay\n  to keep Your commandments\" (Tehilim 119:59-60)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i.e. in context there, all human activities are either mitzva or sin. so yes, wasting time is a prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>nevertheless, as he says in Gate 5 regarding not looking down at other people:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And even if his appearance is bad, it is possible that the reason is\n  because he is ignorant of his obligations to the Creator. Therefore he\n  is more pardonable than me, because my knowledge is greater than his.\n  For the Creator claims from a man only according to the extent of his\n  knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Then he gets home at 7:30, and sleeps until 5:30 pm, where he starts his routine over again.</p>\n\n<p>My question is, how would this Chaim Yankel daven? Would he daven Minchah/Maariv when he first got up, since it would be around that time for normal people, or does he daven Shacharis when he wakes up, even though it's evening time? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It doesnt matter when you wake up there are certain times for each tefilla like shachris till chatzos etc so if you wake up at 530 and the proper prayer time is mincha you pray mincha.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for the amazing question</p>\n\n\n",

If these vessels were purchased new-in-box, it would seem they would not need kashering as they made no contact with food yet.  On that basis, may non-kasherable items that arrive in such condition be used in a kosher kitchen?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are two separate issues regarding kitchen utensils, dishes etc.</p>\n\n<p>One is if they absorbed non-kosher food in the past. Since these utensils are new, this is not a problem for ceramics and glass. However, it may sometimes be a problem for some new metal utensils, such as pans, that may have been coated with non-kosher fat as part of the manufacturing process, and therefore will require kashering. See here, for example: <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Txt4EidAVFEC&pg=PA351&lpg=PA351&dq=kashering%20new%20metal%20utensils&source=bl&ots=U6Du6gvj4i&sig=WD-e0QSLmcmuheTfmm59XDf2uRA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbqLGblsDMAhXHDCwKHQBBBTgQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&q=kashering%20new%20metal%20utensils&f=false\">Shaarei Halacha </a></p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, it would only apply to second-hand utensils, dishes, glasses etc. that were previously used for non-kosher food.</p>\n\n<p>The second issue is \"toivelling\" = immersion in a kosher mikva. Any metal or glass utensil that previously belonged to a non-Jew, must be immersed in a mikva (even if it was never used). Wooden utensils are exempt. Other materials need to be checked with a rabbi, since there is not always a halachic consensus (e.g. plastic, ceramics with a thin glass coating).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kof-k.org/articles/040108090413W-3%20Tevilas%20Keilim.pdf\">This</a> seems like a good starting point, although other rabbis may disagree on some points.</p>\n\n\n",

You burn the wooden spoon because it provides a source of fuel for the fire. If you used a feather to gather the chometz crumbs, you burn that because it may still have some chometz bits stuck to it. The Chabad.org website gives some of this information.</p>\n\n\n",

I’ll try to answer it the best I can.</p>\n\n<p>You question is based on the assumption that God's existence is compared to an infinite time line. He was here for an infinite amount of time and He will forever remain here, but at any instance He experiences only the ‘now’. Yet, if we describe God's existence as an infinite time line, we run into problems. If we point to a specific point on this infinite time line, we can evaluate two things: one, a list of historical events which have occurred up until this point. And two, that God has existed up until this point in time, albeit an infinite amount of time. We do not know, however, if He will continue to exist. That is one problem with your theory; as Jews, we DO know and believe He will forever exist.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem is the following: Free will aside, we know that God knows what we will do before we do it. If I decide to pick up a pen, God knew that (forgive the past tense), before I even picked it up. If your theory is correct, that God's existence is compared to an infinite time line, then at the point in time that I picked up the pen, God was with me in the room— at the same point in time that I was. Not only does this idea make God seem more vulnerable and human-like, but when He is at the point on this line that I picked up the pen, He is not at any other point on the line. How is He to know whether or not I will pick up the pen if He is only at the current point in time? We have already said that God DOES know that I will pick up the pen, but with your theory how is He to know?!</p>\n\n<p>Because of the problems listed, I appears to me, that God existence can not be compared to an infinite time line. I believe God is living above time all together. He is so infinite, His existence doesn't have the word time in it at all. Time is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to Him. Therefore He can not live on an infinite TIME line. He is living in an area or \"universe,\" if you will, that is not affected by time. He has no beginning or end, rather he just... is. Imagine the history time line in your head. You see the beginning of the Earth on the left, and Masiach at the end, on your right. Where is God on this time line? He isn't. Rather he is living above it, not bound by time at all but rather is just existing. He understands the rules of time— he has created it— but does not live by them. He knows what you will do because he is at every point in time, all at the same time. He was, He is and He will be, not at separate points in time, but at the same time! He doesn't exist like we do. When people die, they don't wait until they are resurrected, rather they are like God, I think, in the sense that they are living in an \"alternative universe\" where they just... are.</p>\n\n<p>To answer your question, it isn't that history is an infinite line, where we could be placed anywhere. It is merely a finite line, and God lives separately. Therefore the line of history isn't infinitely long, but rather only 5000 years long. The chances, therefore, that we were born when we were are infinitely less then what you suggested. </p>\n\n<p>(Considering your theory was correct...) God isn't bound by percentage. You can not say that because there is a 0% chance of being placed where we were we can not be placed there. God is infinite and can do infinite things. So even if there was a 0% chance, that doesn't affect God. Imagine God deciding to place me in year 2016 and then an idea called 0% saying, \"Um, no, You can't do that.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Time is an accident (or measurement) of motion and causality. Time is the passing of potentiality to actuality.

Olam haba is eternal and infinite in the same way Hashem is, via the negative. Hashem is eternal because he is not subject to change or time, and the same is said for olam haba. Your question assumes a cardinally infinite passage of time in which this world is the preamble for. This is a categorical error; that is, applying a property to something to which the property cannot apply.

Anyhow, Rabbi Miller understood that many women werent going to the mikva for various reasons.

    "title": "Giving away olam haba to save someone's life",
    "content": "# Giving away olam haba to save someone's life\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the book about Reb Aryeh Levin, \"A Tzaddik In Our Time,\" (by Simcha Raz), Reb Aryeh says that he learned a lesson about self-sacrifice (messirut nefesh) from 2 students of the Vilna Gaon who were brothers. One of the brothers was dying of an illness, and the other brother prayed to God to save his brother's life through giving his reward in olam haba for his special mitzvah of tzitzit to his brother. The brother recovered and lived another 15 years.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that one can actually give away their olam haba, where does the Torah teach that one can do that merely to save another Jew's life in this world? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First of all, there is something Chazzal called an עבירה לשמה a violation with good intention, see Horios 10b and Nazir 23b. That act is juxtaposed with the opposite act, a fulfillment of a commandment with bad intentions. Hashem actually rewarded people for doing something wrong when their intentions were correct. (Please, any sabateans, don't misuse this concept). So even if your question is correct and somebody should not give up Olam Habaah to 'merely' save someone's life, he definitely shouldn't be surprised if he gets rewarded for it. I really don't think Yael (if we assume she was Jewish and relevant to this discussion) was expecting a great reward for sleeping with Sisra. She was probably assuming she would be punished (I.e. loose Olam Habaah) for that act. Ok, seven acts. And yet she was in fact rewarded with greater praise than the four mothers. (See later the Esther caveat, it applies here too).</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein when making the deal you mention, the person would only be trading his Olam Habaah he had earned up until that point. Ok. Clean slate. But now, he has the mitzvah of saving a life on his plate, which is like saving an entire world! I'd call that an upgrade for sure. (Unless this person has saved other lives beforehand. Than his Olam Habaah would probably stay the same. But as a free bonus, he saved someone's life!)</p>\n\n<p>Next, since in your comments you have linked this to a type of physical suicide, i would point out that certain types of shortening of one's life for the sake of granting someone else life are not uncommon in Chazzal. Adam HaRishon gave away seventy years of his life to David HaMelech (Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer 19). I will suggest Esther's act as a source for this as well, at least as Targum understands her words in Esther 5 16 כאשראבדתי אבדתי, she was expecting to die saving the nation. (although one can argue a major difference was that there she was trying to save an entire community). </p>\n\n<p>Also, the fact that you wrote 'merely' about saving someone's life is a bit telling that you don't give life the same exalted status as Hashem and Chazzal did. Perhaps delve into the subject and this question will no longer bother you. One starting point would be in the Igros Moshe who went wild on Reb Shlomo Kluger for suggesting one may avoid saving someone's life if it would embarrass the one doing the saving. (Remember, embarrassing someone is like killing them.) Sorry about the Mussar. Please don't downvote just cause of this. (shameless. I know)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Baal Shem Tov once gave a man a berachah he would have a child.</p>\n\n<p>A bas kol came out and said, I have to be meshaneh sidrei bereishis to be mekayem your berachah (the man was an akar), so you loose your chelek in olam habah.</p>\n\n<p>The baal shem told the man, boruch hashem the berachah will be fulfilled and now I can serve Hashem lishmah.</p>\n\n<p>Another bas kol came out and said, because of your response you get your olam habah back.</p>\n\n\n",

Chabbad he said was different and refused to accept that any other path other than chabbad was possible.</p>\n\n<p>(In this [series of] letter[s] he didn't name any particular Rabbi of chabbad, rather he was focused on the chassidus in general. Please don't shoot the messenger, I'm only reporting what I read there.) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There were several things. One was the Rebbe's innovation of learning Rambam everyday to finish it in 1 years or 3 years.\nR. Shach mocked it saying that people already knew of the Rambam before the Rebbe came around, and he said that no one should follow the Rebbe's Rambam learning cycle. (He supported daf yomi, and never rejected it saying that people knew of the gemoro before R. Shapiro). He gave two reasons: that people will pasken from the Rambam and it will disrupt seder. Neither of these points seem to be valid, as people who learn Rambam know that we don't always pasken according to the Rambam; and the Rebbe was very adamant that chitas and Rambam should not be learned during seder.</p>\n\n<p>Another thing of contention was whether you can give land of Eretz Yisroel away. The Rebbe was very against giving away land, while R. Shach supported giving away land for \"peace\".</p>\n\n<p>The Rebbe got very upset when R. Shach spoke really sharply against non religious Jews and kibbutznikim, saying that they forfeited their right to be called Jews. The Rebbe said that \"every Jew is part of God” and that “anyone who berates any Jew is touching the apple of God’s eye. (The Rebbe was always careful to only speak of other Jews favourably, similar to the derech of the berditchiver.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1990/04/04/archive/lubavitcher-rebbe-speaks-out-against-rabbi-schachs-message\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.jta.org/1990/04/04/archive/lubavitcher-rebbe-speaks-out-against-rabbi-schachs-message</a></p>\n\n<p>R. Shach also said that anyone who doesn't believe that the Holocaust is because of our aveiros is a heretic. The Rebbe's opinion on that was </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In his writings and discussions on the subject, the Rebbe rejected all theological explanations for the Holocaust. What greater conceit -- the Rebbe would say -- and what greater heartlessness, can there be than to give a \"reason\" for the death and torture of millions of innocent men, women and children? Can we presume to assume that an explanation small enough to fit inside the finite bounds of human reason can explain a horror of such magnitude? We can only concede that there are things that lie beyond the finite ken of the human mind. Echoing his father-in-law, the Rebbe would say: It is not my task to justify G‑d on this. Only G‑d Himself can answer for what He allowed to happen. And the only answer we will accept, said the Rebbe, is the immediate and complete Redemption that will forever banish evil from the face of the earth and bring to light the intrinsic goodness and perfection of G‑d's creation. (Chabad.org)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The are many other disagreements between them, including about Moshiach, which others I'm sure will add.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Leshem, the cherem of the Gra against chassidim was primarily on Chabad.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shach never objected to the Rebbe's philosophy, as Judaism is an open playing field in this area, he objected to halachical abberations such as not sleeping in the succah.</p>\n\n<p>He also objected to Chabad not working on communal issues together with other groups, this goes back to a discussion between the Reshab and Pinchos Kohn et al concerning Chabad not joining the Agudah.</p>\n\n\n",

He probably had a tradition that he is from Efraim.The rabbis aren't deducing that the dry bones people are Efraim, the story is already known amongst the Jewish people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Eze37 must be read in context. \nThe context of the dry bones is indeed the return of the lost tribes of the northern kingdom, that is the defunct kingdom will be restored. This is necessary on order for this kingdom, or in modern language:state, yup be reunited with the state of the then southern kingdom, that is Judah.\nThe new covenant that eze37 concludes with and very clearly specifies being between both kingdom or houses does correspond clearly with Jeremiah ch. 30 and 31. </p>\n\n<p>Indeed, two kingdoms cannot be reunited if one does not exist. </p>\n\n<p>This principle escapes most commentators based on the practice of taking scriptures apart and out of context. </p>\n\n<p>The background:\n1ki11 at the death of Solomon God splits his kingdom,  taking away the northern tribes from his descendent because of his idolatry caused by his love for his wives.\nThe intent wads that they should remain United thru the priestly service add their legal and medical counsel in Jerusalem's temple. \nThe fear of dissident and rebellion drove the new king of the north, Jeroboam, an Ephraimite and ex-governor of the region,to secede from Jerusalem and establish two temples where the Jerusalem priestly business was to be conducted. He further changed the fall feasts dates and caused a fortified border to be built between both kingdom, thereby starting a long term family feud between both houses. \nThis separation from Jerusalem resulted in the northern kingdom to fall into idolatry against the efforts of many prophets such as Elijah and Elishah. soon enough God ,after sending more severe warnings than the prophecies, sends pit the Assyrian army which annihilated this kingdom and leaves only its rival,the southern state of Judah which later took on the name of Judea. \nThe issue it's that Israel is made of 12 tribes and that the promise of the almighty was that all 12 will represent him in the land of Canaan. This implies that the northern kingdom people that were taken by the Assyrian must return to the land, they or rather their descendents, reestablishing therefore their territorial jurisdiction lead by a state,basically restoring that house. \nThen once back in the land and such stated in vigor, God would cause their reunification just as he caused their split, and there would be only one commonwealth with one leader as it wad at Sinai and as it wad intended from the beginning. \nSo, the principle of this new reunion had for result intended the same as the covenant of Sinai which wad to create one nation under God of  united tribes.in essence it is the renewal of the Sinai covenant for all intent and purpose. And so, just as Sinai, some sort of exodus from all the nations that the descendents of the northern kingdom had been cast out and spread into was to take place.</p>\n\n<p>This return is in line with the Torah in which God promises to the patriarch that their descendents will spread out around the four corners of the earth and that HE will bring them back to the promised land.</p>\n\n<p>Now the terminology applied to this northern kingdom is what gets people confused ad much as the interpretation of this verse referring to the WHOLE house of Israel. </p>\n\n<p>In genesis, Jacobs confers the firstborn rights to Ephraim from Reuben. He also confirms his name upon him that he should therefore be the leading tribe as firstborn and therefore carry on the name of Israel. \nLater on, in the distribution of the land by Joshua, the territory of Judah is established first, perhaps because the tribe had been given the sacrificial leadership order since Judah had been given the guardianship of the priestly service by Jacob as a blessing. The territory being vast,the tribes of Benjamin and Shimeon were allocated their parcels in it. This can be related to Judah's having taken personal responsibility for his half brother in the matter of Joseph when this latter asked for him to be brought. we,as the rabbits have, will notice that Shimeon was the one picked by Joseph and put in jail. This guides us to deduct that he wad the one behind the plot to kill Joseph in Dothan, near shechem, just as he had been the leader of the mass murder of shechem which had caused them to run for their lives in front of a possible avenger of blood. This in the fear that Shimeon would do another one of his murderous acts  Joseph neutralized him and asked for his brother to be brought in exchange.Joseph's intent wad to protect Benjamin out of the rivalry between the children of Leah and those of Rachel which Jacob was very aware of and for which reason he had not let Ben out of his control.\nThis Judah's taking responsibility for Benjamin and convincing Jacob of his worthiness and righteousness of heart  (he is the one who caused Joseph to be sold so as to save his life as well- the only way to protect him from the murderous hands of Shimeon and Levi),caused him to hey Shimeon released from prison and as well Joseph, who remembered very well their evil  nature and the looting of shechem that accompanied the mass murder and which caused him to receive then with spyiing accusations, began to trust them anew. Therefore Benjamin and Shimeon were placed under the jurisdiction of Judah.This left the other tribes to spread out into their own territories. </p>\n\n<p>Still the leader of all the tribes is the firstborn, Ephraim, who took central territories between Benjamin his uncle from the same mother, ready to defend him, and Menasseh,his older brother. </p>\n\n<p>At the split between the kingdoms, the territory of Judah and all those in it was separated from all three other tribes. This caused Benjamin and Ephraim to be split. Then when the northern tribes, who took on the name of Israel from the title of their leading tribes Ephraim, got kicked out of the land by the Assyrian,the prophets who had announced their demise also announced their eventual return. The entire book of Hosea is dedicated to that subject. </p>\n\n<p>One of the cheat way to even grasp that is to understand in the language used by the compiler of the chronicles how the citizens of each kingdom is addressed.Judah the Yehudim,Jews are different from those from the northern kingdom whose name is Israel, the Israelites,  Yisraelim.</p>\n\n<p>It's only by the end of the 2d temple era that there's a huge confusion between the titles,especially because of the rivalry between both areas, Judea and the rest, that is Samaria and Galilee, both of whom also were disputing the title of Israel. Some early post Judea destruction rabbis did recognise the Samaritans as Israelites though not Jews.The Galileans eventually got reunited with the Judeans which over time got the confusion of title even greater and thereby the understanding of the prophetic writings. </p>\n\n<p>This phenomenon is further compounded by the various hypotheses that pervaded all of the 2d temple era in regard to these lost tribes' return. Some argued they had returned during Hezekiah's time, others sustained it wad after the Babylonian exodus sometimes and gradually, others maintained that were to come back in  the days of the messiah,which opens up an array of where when and how, others denied their return.\nThis return of that dead kingdom got further into theological arguments yuoon the validity of Israelites as mere human to represent the heavens on earth in such abominable and weak body and have rise to the idea that the new brand of Israelite would have bodies that would not be subject to the weaknesses of the flesh which is what caused them to fail as a commonwealth in the first place. The concept that the Torah was the heart of its designer, that is the Eternal, gave rise to its name as the word thru which the entire universe functions by and is, therefore, The founding principles of the supernatural realm which Israel wad supposed to manifest. For such endeavor, the weak human flesh would be replaced by an eternal body that could fully manifest on earth the eternal values of unity that the heavens live by. \nThis gave rise to the doctrine of resurrection which wad based upon those verses of Ezekiel and others at large. </p>\n\n<p>This the valley of the dead bones' whole house of Israel concept developed into this understanding that there will be such a time when Israel will exist on earth in a supernatural way. In this context, whether the whole house applies to Ephraim that had died (Hos13:1) only or whether it applies to both house finally reunited is virtually irrelevant since, although Judah cannot function without Ephraim, Judah as it is is, that is in this weak flesh, not better off as if it were dead like Ephraim. So the doctrines developed that there will be such a time, a world to come, when both Judah and Ephraim, that is the whole house of Israel, will be restored and will function as one man, in new bodies,that they should serve the almighty day and night, and in which Jerusalem will be the centre of Israel and the light of justice and righteousness to the world, as promised in the Torah and the prophets, see Isa2 for example. </p>\n\n<p>Some disputed the idea of supernatural resurrection into immortal bodies,others preached it as symbolical as Israel itself being an eternal nation that will never again disappear from the earth rather than the individual human being. </p>\n\n<p>At this point we are still during the 2d temple era. And the many sects were therefore  argueing the various meanings and methods that all of this should come to pass. Yet they all had in common this understanding that Israel was to be restored and replace Rome as the world leader. But for that they had to unite. And their doctrines were in the way. </p>\n\n<p>Each sect tried to impose its set of  values and scriptural interpretations, sometimes thru civil wars, coercion, etc until Rome leveled the field and dispossessed and dispersed the remnants of Judea. They reunited under the leadership of the Pharisaic sect, while others joined the other and newer sect called Christianity. </p>\n\n<p>Both claimed being that whole house of Israel that Ezekiel speaks about that comes alive from the dead bones' valley. \nboth maintain that they are constituted of Ephraim and Judah and are the true  heirs of the prophetic promises.</p>\n\n<p>Then came Islam who inherited that confusion and, in an attempt to solve it, took over that claim,  sowing  more into the fire. </p>\n\n<p>And this is how we got to have inherited of the dilemma that we experience when we read these verses.</p>\n\n<p>In essence then, the whole house of Israel can be either simply the northern kingdom that needs be restored as an entity in its own land (which right now is the west bank- a clue? ), or it can be both houses reunited, which indeed includes the northern house in the west bank and the southern house in Jerusalem. </p>\n\n<p>Yes indeed, it's a two state solution that must happen in order to reunite both into one. </p>\n\n<p>The northern kingdom was never until now restored as such, as an independent entity. Today's state of Israel is lead by the descendents of Judea, the southern house, in which citizen of the northern house did mingle historically. </p>\n\n<p>But the issue that had kept the doctrines confused was between the identity of that northern house being solely applied to the citizens or to a state with a government and a capital, just as it once was. </p>\n\n<p>The prophets point out to a government, not simply some groups of people. And this is what the theologians miss, since their research is theology and not politics.Thus the theological descriptions of this whole house of Ezekiel that had torn lives for over 2.5 millennia had been based upon the ignorance of the basic Principle that a house exists in function of its governing body's existence, not theological or theoretical imagery. </p>\n\n<p>The eventual separation of church and state has lead us further into this theological debate, ignoring this previous principle that Moses mandate wad to establish a commonwealth of tribes and not a religious institution. Therefore the split of such commonwealth would compromise the validity of its constitution, just as the American confederacy undermined the Union by splitting from it. This the disappearance of Israel as a confederation while its territories remained for the most part foreign to the Judean control,although it wasn't supposed to be at all until the restoration of all things,caused therefore the ineffectiveness of any lone Israelite entity to reach their potential as world leaders. </p>\n\n<p>Thus a certain government must be reestablished in the place where it wad first established, that is in Shechem, or Nablus,the same place where Abraham received that promise, then this government will then be able to reunite with Jerusalem into a homogenous works leading squad. </p>\n\n<p>Since shechem is at the entrance of a valley, between mount Gerizim,where the Samaritan maintain their temple until today, and mount Ebal,there's a chance that this is the valley that Ezekiel refers to where Israel died: the valley of the dead bones. </p>\n\n<p>There's more to say about this city and its scriptural importance, but for the purpose of this answer it would lead to another thousand lines,and the material herein is sufficient for this purpose. </p>\n\n<p>Hope you enjoyed. \nBlessings. </p>\n\n\n",

[the offspring of a union with] any consanguineous relative with whom cohabitation is forbidden; this is the ruling of <strong>Rabbi Akiba. Simeon the from Timnata</strong>   said: [the offspring of any union] the penalty for which is kareth at the hands of heaven; and the halachah is in agreement with his view, ... etc. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Gemara 44b:</h3>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbah Bar Bar Hana said in the name of Rabbi Johanan: All agree that where a slave or an idolater had intercourse with a daughter of an Israelite the child is a bastard. Who is meant by 'All agree'? - Simeon from Timnata. For although Simeon from Timnata stated that the offspring of a union forbidden under the penalty of flogging is not a bastard, his statement applies only to the offspring of a union forbidden under the penalty of flogging, since the betrothal in such a case is valid but here, in the case of an idolater and a slave,  <strong>since betrothal in their case is invalid, they are like those whose union is subject to the penalty of kareth.</strong>  (Diverse opinion are cited, ... \" the 'Elders of the South') - who stated that if an idolater or a slave had intercourse with a daughter of an Israelite, the child born is untainted!\" ... \"Rabbi Joshua Ben Levi said: The child is tainted.\" ...  <strong>for all Amoraim who declare the child fit admit that he is ineligible for the priesthood.</strong>  \"And Rab also ruled that the child is legitimate.\" ... \"Rab Mattena also ruled that the child is legitimate. Rab Judah also ruled that the child is legitimate.\" ... \"Rav Shesheth said: Rav Gaza told me that it was not Rabbi Jose Bar Abin but Rabbi Jose son of Rabbi Zebida, and that he declared the child to be legitimate, both in the case of the married, as well as in that of the unmarried woman. \" \"Go and conceal your identity or marry one of your own kind.\" ... \" Either go abroad or marry one of your own kind.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is an apparent contradiction between the fact that they say that the children are \"damaged\" (pegumim) and the fact that the advice is to marry \"go to a place where you are unknown and where you might in consequence pass as a legitimate Israelite and be allowed to marry a Jewess!\" In such case, if the daughter marry a Cohen, the offspring would be Chalal. Some Rishonim discern here a Machloket. <strong>Ramban and Rashba</strong>  <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47913&st=&pgnum=794&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> are  in doubt, and do not decide what opinion will be retained and Bedieved the son will be Safek Chalal (see also  <strong>Magid Mishne</strong>   issure Bia, 15, 3). (  <strong>Maharshal</strong>  is expressly opposed to Ramban and says that the stringency of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi is Miderabanan and Lechatechila only. So the son is not Safek Chalal. <em>{We can answer the kushia of Shaar Hamelech, how does Ramban allow safek deOrayta bedieved, perhaps the Ramban also think that the stringent opinion is a stringency miderababan.}</em> ). But <strong>Rif, Rambam (and Shulchan Aruh itself)</strong>  in Issure Bia 15, 3 retains the last opinion. He allows to the daughter to marry a Cohen. The offspring will be considered as Kasher.

    "content": "# Who recognizes Yom HaShoah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems that the more religious one is, the less likely one is to commemorate(?) the Holocaust on Yom HaShoah. </p>\n\n<p>To what extent is this true? \nWhich groups do and do not observe Yom HaShoah as their primary (or other) Holocaust remembrance day?\nHow, and to what extent, do various groups for whom Yom HaShoah is not the primary day of remembrance acknowledge (or disacknowledge) Yom HaShoah? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Presenting a strictly Chareidi point of view on this site is like walking into a minefield, but here goes.</p>\n\n<p>There were definitely religious leaders who were against instituting a special day to commemorate the Holocaust, but not all gave their reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>One reason that was given came from Rabbi Gedalia Schor as quoted in Meged Givos Olam. The author there said other gedolim shared this idea as well. </p>\n\n<p>When Hashem does something wonderful for us it is a kiddush Hashem, a sanctification of His name. Every time we mention it and commemorate it, there is another kiddush Hashem. \n The opposite is true as well. When Hashem does (or allows) something bad to happen to us it is a chillul Hashem, a desecration of His great name. Every mention of it and commemoration of it is another chillul Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>A time such as Tisha Bi'Av or another period of public mourning, which was already instituted by earlier authorities, was viewed as an opening to tack this tragedy on to. This was the same approach taken by the Rishonim and Achronim concerning the tragedies in their communities. For instance the destruction to them resulting from the crusades and the Khmelnytsky Uprising, (see the Taz in O'ch 493 #2 about this). \nFrom a statistical point of view, the crusaders wiped out the same percentage of Ashkenaz Jews as the Holocaust did and no new day of mourning was instituted, but rather liturgy was added in to the Tisha Bi'Av service.</p>\n\n<p>[Edit: This was the opinion of Rabbi J.B. Soleveitchik. He had a tradition from his uncle Reb Velvel pointing to wording in the liturgy of Tisha Bi'Av that that day was chosen as the singular day for commemorating national tragedies.]</p>\n\n<p>It's also worth noting that the religious communities commemorate the victims almost every single week! On Shabbos when we say Av HaRachamim, they were the holy communities who's lives were taken, along with so many others. And again on all three festivals and Yom Kippur anyone in shul saying Yizkor will have said a special prayer for all victims of such acts. Any group of Jews who did not go to shul and pray will obviously have felt a commemoration sorely lacking for such a fresh wound, and will have gone looking for their own path.</p>\n\n<p>So it is not the Chareidim who haven't commemorated the victims of the Holocaust, they have many such commemorations. But they have followed an apparent trend of commemorations for the last thousand years which have not singled out specific events. The one day a year where tradition does seem to single out singular events is Tisha Bi'Av, and commemorations were added. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_HaShoah#Orthodox_Judaism\">Wikipedia</a> deals with the question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Chief Rabbinate of Israel, in 1949, under the guidance of Ben-Zion\n  Meir Hai Uziel and Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog, decided that the Tenth of\n  Tevet should be the national remembrance days for victims of the\n  Holocaust. The Tenth of Tevet fast commemorates the siege of Jerusalem\n  by Nebuchadnezzar II. For this day, it recommended traditional Jewish\n  ways of remembering the dead, such as the study of the traditional\n  Mishnah section about ritual baths, saying Psalms, lighting a yahrzeit\n  candle and saying Kaddish for those Holocaust victims whose date of\n  death remains unknown. On other occasions, the Chief Rabbinate also\n  referred to Tisha b'Av as being a date of remembrance for Holocaust\n  victims.<a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Features/An-anchor-for-national-mourning\">ref:13</a></p>\n  \n  <p>The Knesset decision taken on April 21, 1951 to designate the 27th of\n  Nisan as Yom HaShoah ignored the Rabbinate's decision from two years\n  earlier, and the Chief Rabbinate, in turn, decided to ignore the\n  Knesset's chosen date, one reason being the fact that Jewish law\n  forbids fasting and certain laws of mourning during the month of\n  Nisan, which is considered to be a month of happiness. Another view,\n  held by influential Haredi Rabbi Avraham Yeshayeh Karelitz (known as\n  the 'Chazon Ish'), held that Rabbinical Authorities of the modern era\n  lacked the power to institute new days of mourning or commemoration\n  for future generations.</p>\n  \n  <p>While there are nevertheless Orthodox Jews who commemorate the\n  Holocaust on Yom HaShoah, others in the Orthodox community –\n  especially Haredim, including Hasidim – remember the victims of the\n  Holocaust on traditional days of mourning which were already in place\n  before the Holocaust, such as Tisha B'Av in the summer, and the Tenth\n  of Tevet, in the winter. Several well-known Haredi rabbis, including\n  Rabbi Michael Dov Ber Weissmandl, Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam of Bobov,\n  Rabbi Shimon Schwab, and several others, wrote kinnot about the Shoah,\n  to be said on Tisha b'Av.</p>\n  \n  <p>While most Modern Orthodox Religious Zionist Jews do stand still for\n  two minutes during the siren, in Haredi areas, no attention is given\n  to Yom HaShoah. Most stores do not close, schools continue and most\n  people do not stop walking when the siren sounds. The\n  non-participation of Haredim in Yom HaShoah is one of the points which\n  regularly causes friction between Haredim and non-Haredim in Israel,\n  as non-Haredim consider the Haredi position of ignoring the siren and\n  Yom HaShoah altogether to be disrespectful.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus, a situation has come into existence where religious forms of\n  commemoration take place primarily on the Tenth of Tevet and on Tisha\n  b'Av, while secular forms of commemoration take place primarily on Yom\n  HaShoah, and either part of the population ignores the other's day of\n  commemoration.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Shmiras Shabbos K'Hilchasa also brings this down (chapter 1, 35b. Pg. 70 in the new edition)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י\"לא תעשה כל מלאכה אתה... ובהמתך\" בא הכתוב לאסור עשיית מלאכה האסורה, במשותף, על-ידי אדם ובהמה, כגון המנהיג בהמה ברשות הרבים ומשא על גבה, הן אם הבהמה היא של היהודי המעביד, הן של יהודי אחר, הן של גוי, הן של הפקר, והוא הנקרא בפי חז\"ל איסור מחמר</p>\n<p>\"You shall do no melacha... And your animal\" the passuk is coming to prohibit the doing of any prohibited melacha, in partnership between a man and animal, for example leading an animal in a Reshus Harabbim with a pack on its back, whether the animal is his own, a different Jew's, <strong>a non-Jew's</strong>, or heifer, and this is what the chachamim call <em>Mechamer</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Accordingly, the Ben Ish Chai (Rabbi Yosef Chayim of Baghdad, 1833-1909) in Parashat Lech-Lecha, Halacha 8, wrote that one should make a point of washing clothes for Shabbat on Wednesday or Thursday.</p>\n\n<p>Does this prohibition apply today?  In ancient times, washing clothes entailed going to a river, washing all the clothes by hand, and hanging them out to dry.  This was a process that in some cases could take nearly half a day.  Today, we simply throw the clothes into a machine, add some detergent and press the button.  Given the relative ease and speed of laundry nowadays, would it be permissible to do laundry on Erev Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>Chacham Ovadia Yosef, in Halichot Olam, Helek 3, page 50, ruled that nowadays one may, indeed, do laundry on Erev Shabbat, since the process of washing clothes today is far less arduous and time consuming as it was in ancient times, and hence does not detract from one's other Shabbat preparations.</p>\n\n<p>Is it permissible to put clothing in a washer or dryer just before Shabbat and allow the machine to run on Shabbat?</p>\n\n<p>According to the practice of the Sepharadim, it is permissible to turn on a machine before Shabbat and have it run on Shabbat, whereas the Ashkenazim are stringent in this regard, based on a ruling of the Rama (Rabbi Moshe Isserles, Poland, 1525-1572), in his glosses to the Shulchan Aruch (252:5).  (See Yehaave Daat, Helek 3, siman 18.)</p>\n\n<p>Summary: It is permissible to wash and dry clothes in washing and drying machines on Erev Shabbat, and Sephardic custom allows putting clothes into a washer or dryer before Shabbat and having it run on Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

However, according to R' Ovadia from Bartenura, the \"ולמה\" in <em>Orla</em> means \"ובמה\", i.e. \"in which case\" (and <strong>not</strong> \"and why\"). Therefore, to explain how R' Ovadia's reading sits well with the text, the <em>Tosfot Yom Tov</em> explains that the \"ולמה\" isn't the \"regular\" \"למה\" (with a <em>kamatz</em> under the <em>lamed</em>), it's a \"<em>lamed shimushit</em>\", i.e. \"ל-מה\", meaning \"for what purpose\", or in our case, \"in which case\".</p>\n\n<p>To clarify - both your suggestions would fit the text in <em>Pitum HaKetoret</em> (just like asking \"why\" vs \"for what purpose\"), but as mentioned above, that's not the distinction made by the <em>Tosfot Yom Tov</em> in <em>Orla</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

The Ta is a symbol of speed and the transformation of bad fortune to good fortune. The three flaming jewels symbolize the Buddha, the Dharma (Buddhist teachings), and the Sangha (Buddhist community): the three cornerstones of Tibetan philosophical tradition. [...]</p>\n<p>Traditionally, prayer flags are used to promote peace, compassion, strength, and wisdom. The flags do not carry prayers to gods, which is a common misconception; rather, the Tibetans believe the prayers and mantras will be blown by the wind to spread the good will and compassion into all pervading space. Therefore, prayer flags are thought to bring benefit to all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The flags do have mantras written on them, but there is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra#The_literal_meaning_or_meaninglessness_of_mantras\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">significant dispute</a> as to whether these have intrinsic meaning or are simply vocal meditative devices.</p>\n\n\n",

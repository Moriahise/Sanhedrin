However, Pesach Sheni is a joyous holiday, in some sense. It was the day that people who were <em>tameh</em> (ritually impure) on Pesach and couldn't make the Pesach sacrifice, a 2nd chance to eat that sacrifice on 14 Iyar. Today, some have the custom to omit Tachanun on Pesach Sheni, a custom that is often done on holidays.</p>\n\n<p>So there seems to be a contradiction between the joy of Pesach Sheni and the fasting on Beha\"b.

The issue was regarding the meaning of the term \"ממחרת השבת\" - \"after the Shabbat\", which is the day when the Omer offering is offered and signals the beginning of Sefirat Ha'Omer. Hence, the exact date of Shavuot depends on the day that the Sefirah begins.</p>\n<p>According to the Pharisean and later Rabbinic interpretation, \"ממחרת השבת\" refers to the day after the first Yom Tov of Pesach (16th of Nissan), while according to the Sadducees and Boethusians, \"ממחרת השבת\" refers to the first Sunday after the first Yom Tov of Pesach - multiple possible dates.</p>\n<p>The former interpretation is based on an understanding that the Torah refers to a set date for the start of the Omer, hence a symbolic meaning for \"after Shabbat\": The Omer is always on the 16th of Nissan, right after Pesach (the symbolic Shabbat). The latter interpretation is based on an understanding that the Torah literally means \"after Shabbat\" - after the 7th day of the week that comes after the first Yom Tov of Pesach.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more information and sources.</p>\n\n\n",

Before the sin, humanity was not mislead by livelihood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apparently the Rambam refers to two Chazal statements: the first is a Mishna in Masechet Avot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַמְקַבֵּל עָלָיו עֹל תּוֹרָה , מַעֲבִירִין מִמֶּנּוּ עֹל מַלְכוּת וְעֹל דֶּרֶךְ אֶרֶץ.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who accepts upon himself the yoke of Torah is exempted from the yoke of government duties and the yoke of worldly carrier\nand the second is a Gemara that we can found in several places with little changes in version, here BK 38a:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התניא, ר\"מ אומר: מנין שאפילו נכרי ועוסק בתורה שהוא ככהן גדול?\nת\"ל: (ויקרא י\"ח) אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם, כהנים ולוים וישראלים לא נאמר אלא אדם, הא למדת, שאפילו נכרי ועוסק בתורה הרי הוא ככהן גדול\n‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Meir used to say, Whence can we learn that even where a gentile occupies himself with the study of the Torah he equals [in status] the High Priest?  We find it stated: Which if a man do he shal live in them;(17) it does not say \"priests, Levites and Israelites\", but \"a man\", which shows that even if a Gentile occupies himself with the study of the Torah he equals [in status] the High Priest.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Humanity is facing by a great complexity of issues. That is a consequence of loving complications. This complexity of life is the state of the world after the sin (אחרי החטא). Some exceptional individuals, driven by their deep desire, spend spontaneously their live to the cause of causes. In such a case, he is blessed: \"וחי בהם\", \"ה' מנת חלקי וכוסי אתה תומך גורלי\". Concerning the Tribe Levi, Mitsvot have resulted from this.</p>\n<p>We see a Blessing a Promise, a guaranty, not from social organization (not Tzedaqa or Collel, Isachar-Zvulun), not a Social Status. <b>The tribe of Levi is only an example of destiny</b>. But concerning the tribe of Levi, some Mitzvot are an \"institutionalization\" of their blessing (Maaser Rishon).</p>\n<p>From Hilchot Talmud Torah Rambam we understand that he need to work to avoid alms. And in Hilchot Sheviit, Rambam garantees blessing to a man who doesn't at all abandon all work, as Shevet Levi, But doesn't devote himself to the pursuit of money.</p>\n<p>This man, on Hilchot Sheviit earns little money but it's enough for himself, he is not afraid to live in poverty, not as a man which received a lot from community. As a Levi who is not afraid that he earns  less money than a landowner<br></p>\n<p>The special blessing is for Tzadikim. Every individual on its own merits will found a work that allow to learn Torah and perform Avodat Hashem. Rambam states explicitly that the Hashgacha is proportionally to the degree of proximity of the Tzadik.</p>\n<p>Note: The famous Machloket between Rambam (lengthly developed in Avot 4) and most comments about the legitimacy of make money with Torah learning, Torah crown is not our topic.</p>\n\n\n",

What's the best way to practice for someone at my level?</p>\n\n<p>Edit: a typical idea would probably be to practice over and over again. Not so much pronunciation but rather being able to read more quickly.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I had the same question years ago. I have used <a href=\"http://virtualcantor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://virtualcantor.com/</a></p>\n\n<p>I liked the versatility of the site. But also its clarify for newcomers. I did not know the structure of the tefilla and therefore the way portions were broken up in a list of clearly named sound files really helped. </p>\n\n<p>I even found it to be useful in teaching me the amidah for davening at home. I used to need ages to finish davening and I did not become faster by reading everyday. I dreaded the longer parts. Through the website i learned the melodies for the repetition and this gave me a melodic rhythm to help me understand the text. These were steps that helped me reach the level necessary to start as a shaliach tzibbur, but also to understand what skills in hebrew reading i lacked and how to overcome it step by step</p>\n\n<p>The melodies are also a nice combination of melodic yet not too 'professional' for someone who has not been trained to sing. I just started with learning to read by practicing the parts that were sung. Now i can read and understand tefillah and use the melodies that are more traditional in my shul, but for me: it all started with virtual cantor.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, my learning speed and quality have been greatly improved by studying small parts at a time not so much for singing, but so as to study the translation in my siddur. The siddur vocabulary is relatively limited so in the beginning many words were new, but after a short while it becomes easier to learn new parts, because you recognise words. This understanding is the \"trick\" of improving quickly. It also makes you more versatile: you can read 'surprise' sections easier, such as ad hoc added psalms for unforseen reasons, etc. Not only because you can read words. But understanding makes sure that you can improvise a melody that supports the meaning and syntax of what is written. The websites out there can be a useful crutch, but relying on them is a short road that is long. Complementing practice with understanding is the longer road that is short.</p>\n\n<p>A final note: it is important to understand the basic halachot of the mincha service and tefilla in general. Knowing when to skip or add sections, why and when to kaddish is said and which type, etc. are all things that attribute to fast learning and practice. In the beginning it can be sufficient to have functional knowledge of the texts and melodies said by the chazan, but make sure to incorporate all three elements: singing, textual understanding, and halacha into your learning routine. </p>\n\n<p>edit: given all the different styles and nusach out there, there are more (sometimes similar) weekday-nusach resources, such as wonderfully aggregated by <a href=\"http://offtonic.com/nusach/nusach.html?service=weekdays\" rel=\"nofollow\">offtonic.com</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ok, I will give some personal tips. Obviously there is no \"source\" for this. But I do often lead services myself (including this morning) and I am no \"expert\" really.</p>\n\n<p>This is based around the repetition of the Amidah. The rest of what is said is just a few lines (and of Ashrei, end of Tachanun and end of Aleinu) and a couple of recitations of Kaddish.</p>\n\n<p>Firstly, don't try to go faster than you can. Typically it takes me about 5 minutes to repeat a weekday Shacharit. Mincha is slightly shorter because you don't recite the Birkat Kohanim (and in my nusach, we also say the shorter Shalom Rav at Mincha). If it takes you 6 or 7 minutes that's probably not going to hold everyone up so much. If it takes you 10 minutes then that is indeed very slow.</p>\n\n<p>The only section (assuming nusach ashkenaz) you don't normally recite is the bit after kedusha \"l'dor vador nagid godlecha\" so practise that part...</p>\n\n<p>Stop and breathe: At the end of each b'racha, the congregation recites Amen and that is a chance for you to take a deep breath in preparing for the next B'racha. Some b'rachas are longer than others so you'll need other stops to breathe too.</p>\n\n<p>Recite all of Modim out loud. The congregation recites their part silently but the leader does not.</p>\n\n<p>And of course, you are leading prayers for the whole congregation before G-d. Ensure you keep a reasonable level of K'vana, i.e. you at least keep in mind that you are praying and ideally for each b'racha, understand the general message of it even if you don't understand every word. e.g. when you recite Barech Aleinu, you are asking for a blessing on the land, i.e. a good crop. There are Siddurim that have a small \"heading\" before each one and whilst you are breathing as they recite Amen, also read this to prepare yourself what you are about to pray for.</p>\n\n\n",

After death, they can no longer perform mitzvos and they have established the level at which they will exist for eternity. This is one of the concepts of \"reward and punishment\". Thus, after a person dies, they no longer have the ability to change (like angels), but they are not as \"robotic\" as angels which were created for a specific task and only exist as long as that task has not yet been completed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is God Praiseworthy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many Jewish prayers and throughout Tanakh, God is strongly praised for His goodness, that which He does for the Jews, His amazing miracles etc. However, those same sources, and most Jewish sources, also agree that God is perfect. That presents something of a contradiction, as a perfect being always needs to make a perfect choice and therefore does not have what most would traditionally define as free will. </p>\n\n<p>That being the case, does it make any sense to praise God if you believe God to be a perfect being incapable of doing anything other than that which is perfect? Is God praiseworthy if He doesn't have a choice in what He does?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Just because He always does what is perfect does not mean He doesn't have free will in this.</p>\n\n<p>Some sources:</p>\n\n<p>(shaar bechina ch.1):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Since the Creator has free will in whatever He does, is not forced,\n  needs nothing and is not forced by any nature, therefore He created\n  things diverse, according as His wisdom each time dictated; so that\n  the variety shall point to His unity and His free-will in whatever He\n  does, as it is said \"Whatsoever the L-ord pleased, has He done in\n  heaven and on earth\" (Tehilim 135:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pas Lechem comments there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"has free will, not forced, etc.\" - His intent in this is that\n  something which is bound to a nature such as inanimate objects, always\n  do the same thing. But something which acts by will and desire,\n  namely, a human being, which possesses free will - he will have\n  different actions, but not at the same time, rather according to his\n  needs of the time. And the Creator is not bound by any \"nature\", <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/10615\">ch'v</a>,\n  nor is he forced, nor needs anything. The latter two terms \"not\n  forced\" and \"needs nothing\" the author wrote to contrast with man.\n  <strong>Because a man is sometimes \"forced\" in his actions, to avoid harm, or he needs to bring some benefit. Therefore, though he acts with\n  free will and desire, one cannot truly call him as doing with \"free\n  will\", except in a borrowed sense since necessity may prevent him in\n  this. Hence, the term \"free will\" correctly applies only to G-d,</strong>\n  since His will is free of any form of need or necessity, and all the\n  more so of any \"nature\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence, in the above sense, God has even more free will than us. Also sometimes He completely overrides His attribute of justice (which is truth), as the Ramchal discusses in Kalach Pitchei Chachma, petach #2. Thus He does not always do what is perfect from an absolute truth perspective.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The desire of the Creator is only [to bestow] good. It is impossible\n  to say that the Divine will desired that there could be other forces\n  which can prevent Him [from bestowing good] in any manner whatsoever.\n  Because the Divine will wants solely and exclusively to bestow good,\n  [and if it were the case that other forces could prevent this] then it\n  would certainly not be good that His goodness not be capable of\n  spreading over His creations. And if you ask: \"[Perhaps] this is good,\n  namely, the bestowing of good to the righteous and the punishing of\n  the wicked [is good]?\" Behold, it is written: \"I will have mercy upon\n  whom I will have mercy\" (Shemos 33:19), [which was expounded to mean:]\n  <strong>\"even though he does not deserve it\"</strong> (Berachos 7a), and it is written: \"[In those days, and in that time, says the L-ord,] the\n  iniquity of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none; [and\n  the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them\n  whom I preserve]\" - behold G-d desires to bestow good also to the\n  wicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>G-d is too sublime for us to actually understand Him or describe Him in any way. However, He has revealed to us through the Torah and through the Nevi'im (and maybe through the chachmei ha'Shas as well) how He wants us to  view Him and His attributes. We have to accept that our traditions are the best way of understanding Him, even though we may know that from the standpoint of \"truth\" or philosophical study it may not,and probably isn't, a proper description of who He really is. And this understanding of Him is not a bi'dieved  because we just can't do better - it is how He wants us to view Him. It is the \"necessary truth\" instead of the \"actual truth\" as described by the Rambam in the Moreh. So as far as we are concerned G-D is worthy of praise because we were told so. We are taught by the Torah what our releationshship and attitudes should be towards Him.The ultimate truth as far as we are concerned in our dealings with G-D is that He is praiseworthy. Beyond that is already beyond our capacity to understand. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><em>I once heard from a great Rabbi that the definition of worship is when you consider someone absolutely perfect in every way, and this feeling is despite their flaws, and arises because you think <em>they</em> are perfect, and therefore the 'ways' about them are all perfect too. Whatever the theological issues one is experiencing, if one really loves Hashem with a true love, one will find everything about Him is praiseworthy...</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p>A common misconception about Hashem ית׳ is that a difference between Him and us is that we are limited in our strength and ability, while He has infinite power to do anything. Therefore, we conclude, if we were God, we would also be able to do all that, so what's the big deal.</p>\n<p>Firstly, this type of thinking is the opposite of humility. Moshe Rabbeinu was praised for being the most humble man alive, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe explains that this is because he always felt that if any other person on the planet was endowed with his abilities, they would do a better job than him. Nowadays, many people indulge in the opposite. They think if they were a billionaire, or the president/dictator, or the CEO of a big company, or the developer of the product they are using, or a Rabbi, that <em>they would do a much better job than this schmendrick</em>.</p>\n<p>Not only that, but it is incorrect. Hashem is <em>not</em> \"the same as us except that He is infinite\". This theological point is brought in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first Rambam in Mishnah Torah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְסוֹד הַיְסוֹדוֹת וְעַמּוּד הַחָכְמוֹת לֵידַע שֶׁיֵּשׁ שָׁם מָצוּי\nרִאשׁוֹן. וְהוּא מַמְצִיא כָּל נִמְצָא. וְכָל הַנִּמְצָאִים\nמִשָּׁמַיִם וָאָרֶץ וּמַה שֶּׁבֵּינֵיהֶם לֹא נִמְצְאוּ אֶלָּא\nמֵאֲמִתַּת הִמָּצְאוֹ:</p>\n<p>The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know\nthat there is a Primary Being who brought into being all existence.\nAll the beings of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them\ncame into existence only from the Truth of His being.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The truth of His being is what is called a True Being. This is how it is explained. You and I are not a true existence, and the proof is, we have zero say in our existence. We can't create ourselves, and we can't stop ourselves from dying. We came into existence at a certain point, which means we weren't \"always there\". We are not the masters of our existence and being <em>at all</em>, but He is <em>completely</em>. This is incomprehensible to us, and sounds like a paradox, but clearly this has to be the case, He is absolutely His own master and there is nothing about Him that is dependant, incidental, or in any way not His. As the Ramchal puts it in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Purpose_of_Creation.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי הנה הוא ית״ש שלם בעצמו ולא במקרה</p>\n<p>For surely He, may His name be blessed, is perfect from Himself, and\nnot contingently so.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kabbalists describe Hashem's existence as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2S90i-FV8p8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">utterly personal to Him</a>. We cannot comprehend any of this. The real question is how are <em>we</em> ever befitting of praise, especially the praise He gives us!</p>\n<p>Thus, any greatness we perceive in Hashem is something to praise <em>Him</em> for, absolutely. Even if one wishes to make the argument that we can only perceive Him from a human perspective, that doesn't do the infinite sublime justice He deserves, still this is the rule: whatever we perceive as praiseworthy, Hashem is infinitely <em>more</em> than that, and we should in fact be afraid that whatever praise we offer is not enough. It's a bit of an insult to praise Einstein for knowing that 2 + 2 = 4, and this is why we are told that if it weren't for the Torah, we wouldn't be able to praise Him.</p>\n<p>I hope this settles an unaddressed theological misconception, which I believe goes well with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71323/31534\">ray's answer</a>, as well as mevaqesh's comments on <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71258/31534\">user613's answer</a>, on Hashem's free will.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So what sort of things does the Torah and do Chazal praise Him for? I won't be able to go into a lot of detail and this is best left as a personal journey of discovery, but here are some of the headers.</p>\n<h4>His creation</h4>\n<p>His creation is mind-blowingly amazing for any mortal being. Firstly, its size - it is big in an absolute sense. There is no finite being that can comprehend both the depth of the plank scale, and at the same time the depth of cosmic scale, and if one were large enough in scale to see the universe as small, time would pass so fast that the universe wouldn't exist. No machine can calculate the number of particles, not to mention stars, and their states and interrelationships with every other particle, yet He suspends, sustains and controls this personally with His will every instant. His laws of physics, and the world of knowledge, and His general wisdom is certainly something any human being would find immensely amazing, and then boundaries of what there is to find out and discovery is endless.</p>\n<p>Just because He could supposedly do all this easier than it is for me to lift my elbow, it is still amazing in my eyes, and with the above discussion in mind is a personal fact about His Self, and therefore He is praiseworthy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְהַלְלוּ  אֶת־שֵׁם ה' כִּי־נִשְׂגָּב שְׁמוֹ לְבַדּוֹ הוֹדוֹ עַל־אֶרֶץ\nוְשָׁמָיִם׃</p>\n<p>Let them praise the Name of the Lord: for His Name alone is exalted;\nHis glory is on the earth and heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>His deeds</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.13b.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A gemara explains</a> that he gave Nevuchadnezzar might, and assisted him in his idolatrous battles and all the related travesties, because He wanted the person who did the necessary evil of destroying the temple to be great, so as not to degrade the Jewish people that they were conquered by a weak army.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7928/jewish/Chapter-49.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Tanya discusses</a> all of the things Hashem did that He hates doing, bishvil Yisrael. He made a tzimtzum and allowed someone else into His personal and private existence, He hid, He created a yeitzer hara and evil and suffering... the list is painful to read.</p>\n<p>He runs the world with <em>hashgacha pratis</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_Two%2C_On_Divine_Providence_in_General?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 2</a> for full details), ensuring that we have free will, yet our free will doesn't interrupt His plan. He helps us, saves us, rescues us, teaches us, rebukes us, gives each creature food, every person a soul mate (and arranges their meeting)... His deeds are awesome!</p>\n<p>Yaacov Avinu A'H praised His deeds and His character in the following statement, which will lead us on to the next point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קטנתי מכל החסדים ומכל־האמת אשר עשית את־עבדך</p>\n<p>I am unworthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all the truth,\nwhich Thou hast shown Thy servant (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 32:11</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>His character</h4>\n<p>First of all, the fact that He even has a character, so-to-speak, is a surprise and worthy of praise, as nobody tells Him He should have a any preferences. Theological musings make that impossible for us to understand, as surely everything should be completely homogenous to Him, yet when He reveals Himself in the Torah, we see that He likes good and hates bad. If we learn about His preferences we will learn to praise Him, as His so-to-speak personality is absolutely wonderful in every way and absolutely perfect.</p>\n<p>We praise His love, His righteousness, His kindness, His mercy, His loyalty and commitment and so much more, just open any random page of Tehillim, or any siddur! Also from our day-to-day experience: He is the perfect parent, infinitely patient with His children, guiding them without infringing on their free will, bringing out the best in them in a dignified way. He remains hidden and, even though He intimately knows the thoughts and feelings of man, stays silent when the wicked curse Him, and holds back when He sees us making mistakes, allowing us to figure it out for ourselves. If we understand that He is perfect, this means He is also perfectly sensitive and vulnerable (in the positive, character-sense, so to speak), yet His Self-control is mighty.</p>\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.69b.14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a gemara that explains that Hashem's might</a> is that He was able to stand by and watch wicked people do the necessary evil of destroy His temple and His people. A mortal wouldn't have been able to do that.</p>\n<h4>His being ours</h4>\n<p>In His great humility, He decided with perfect free will to create us so that He could have us (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.1?lang=bi&aliyot=1&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.1.1.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">second Rashi on Bereshit 1:1</a>), from His own desire (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.13.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 13:6</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Bechukotai.3.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma Bechukotai 3:1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.16.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nasso 16:1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7915/jewish/Chapter-36.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya 36</a>). Desiring to not be only Him, but have us, is perhaps His greatest praise. He wants and needs us, even though by every right He shouldn't, and becomes ours. For this, we praise Him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵלִי אַתָּה וְאוֹדֶךָּ אֱלֹהַי אֲרוֹמְמֶךָּ</p>\n<p>You are my God, my Lord I will praise You (Tehillim 118:28)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We were created to praise Him (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15974/jewish/Chapter-43.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 43:21</a>). Once we move past viewing Him as an \"other\", as some incomprehensible ultimate force of nature, but get personal and realise He is the Someone of all someones, and we are His and He is ours, then we can praise <em>Him</em>, Himself. Not anything about Him, but just Him. Praising the <em>things about Him</em>, so-to-speak, is something we shouldn't do in excess, because we risk making it sound that it's just the things about Him that impress us. This is akin to a husband telling his wife that he loves her because she is good looking, <em>chas veshalom</em>. This is a hard concept to get our heads around and takes life lessons and maturity, yet it stares at us all the time in the Torah, and in life.

A non-Jewish vendor owns the physical machine and is responsible for stocking the chametz cookies in the machine. The vendor comes once per week, and empties the money, and restocks the machine with products that he owns. Every month, he gives the Jewish owner a percentage of the sales. The vendor also pays the Jew a space rental fee for allowing him to keep the vending machine there.</p>\n\n<p>My question - Can a Jewish employee purchase chametz from this machine after Pesach? Is the Jewish business owner considered owning chametz during Pesach by the fact that he gets a percentage of sales, in general, or is the fact that the currently purchased product not having ben sold during Pesach exempt from this prohibition? Also, is the usage fee an implication of the Jew owning the machine and its contents?</p>\n\n\n",

Although Fernandez is in some ways an update to M.H. Segal's Grammar of Mishnaic Hebrew, Segal's work remains more thorough, accurate, and clear. In French, a good book is La Langue Des Sages by Sophie Kessler-Mesguich. Note that none of these grammars treat the Hebrew of the Amoraim and later Rabbinic Hebrew. </p>\n\n<p>Another resource you may find useful is Marcus Jastrow's dictionary. It contains both Rabbinic Hebrew and Aramaic entries. It covers the vocabulary of both early and later Rabbinic Hebrew. </p>\n\n<p>As for an Aramaic grammar to aid in reading Rabbinic literature, T.

Bar-Asher Siegal's Introduction to the Grammar of Jewish-Babylonian Aramaic is a far more informative work.

What's this got to do with what day Shavuos falls on?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The omer count is 49 days (seven complete weeks) after the bringing of the omer. Thus, Shavuos is one day of the week later than the \"shabbos\" which begins the omer period. That is day 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50 (Shavuos) of the omer are all on the same day of the week.</p>\n\n<p>Since the baisusim force the first day of the omer to be on the day that follows the Shabbat of the chag (rather than after the first day of chag),  the \"seven complete weeks\" will end on Shabbos and Shavuos is forced to be on Sunday. That is why we always have Shavuos on the same day of the week as the second day of Pesach (and the first day of the omer). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"that the omer should be brought after shabbos as opposed to after Sunday\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your question misunderstands the Gemara.

R. Soloveitchik expressed concern for apostasy and\n  wrote that the Jewish and Christian religious differences and world\n  outlooks are irreconcilable, such that discussion thereof would be\n  wholly unfruitful and would be wrong.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although, unlike R. Feinstein, R. Soloveitchik maintained that in theory, dialogue with the Church about “humanitarian and cultural\n  endeavors” - universal, practical issues that do not touch upon\n  personal religious beliefs and practices - would be acceptable and\n  even positive (ibid. p. 260), the context of such dialogue in the\n  situations addressed by R. Soloveitchik caused him to prohibit Jewish\n  participation therein. R. Soloveitchik was adamant and unapologetic in\n  his refusal to allow any form of personal religious discourse between\n  Judaism and Christianity, and the circumstances and impressions\n  conveyed by even otherwise permissible interchange compelled him to\n  comprehensively ban such interchange in his correspondence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://api.ning.com/files/nII-N*HRVI3AiXJ-Bss3PzikuWkYBT2yzztHoN5tBdZqoUHBdDq9F00b8Mbv1Y2a2*DrlXVSeM8d2Hhc-RP8fBaET5WRKrlo/Confrontation_2.pdf\">here</a> for a foundational article by R Soloveitchik.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, as cited <a href=\"http://jewishisrael.ning.com/page/rav-soloveitchiks-letter-to\">here</a> R Soloveitchik writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…We are, therefore, opposed to any public debate, dialogue or\n  symposium concerning the doctrinal, dogmatic or ritual aspects of our\n  faith vis a vis “similar” aspects of another faith community. We\n  believe in and are committed to our Maker in a specific manner and we\n  will not question, defend, offer apologies, analyze or rationalize our\n  faith in dialogues centered about these “private” topics which express\n  our personal relationship to the God of Israel.

It's obvious that nice and neutral words are to be spoken nicely. But what if you have something to say that the other will not ostensibly wish to hear. It can be a challenge to say such things (instead of just being silent about them) in a palatable manner. </p>\n\n<p>Being silent brings its own issues, as when dialogue dies, so does much of the relationship. </p>\n\n<p>If, rather, you can say all that you have that is meaningful in your heart, to everyone at any time, in a way that is <strong>safe, non-threatening, and hear-able,</strong> you will have good relationships. You will be saved from ANGER, violence, and revenge which stem from having stuff to say and not being able to say it. </p>\n\n<p>Gehinnom, possibly in this world, as well as the next world, comes from a life of being unable to speak up in a Nachas way. One tends to invent nonsense and see oneself as a victim. Rather, you must commit </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>to not creating and then harbouring resentment by just being silent - \"cast out evil in your heart\"</li>\n<li>but rather speaking up appropriately in a very acceptable way - \"Practise always to say all your words to each person with Nachas\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are many skills involved in speaking with Nachas - a pleasant tone, kind words, and a considerate attitude are important but not always enough. There are  many more skills needed too to deliver words with Nachas so that they are heard. </p>\n\n<p>The greatest measure of Nachas is in the result, do you get the valuable thing you want, or agree to forgo it, and still have a good relationship? As it says: \"<strong>Practise always to say all your words with Nachas, to each person, and at all times, and through this you will be saved from ANGER.</strong>\" So saying things with Nachas is supposed to save you from relationship blow-ups. </p>\n\n<p>The rest of the Letter describes more details on how to do this.</p>\n\n<p>The tone is irrelevant. However, usually if you're really creating a pleasant feeling, your tone will sound nice to the receiver. And by the way, a pleasant feeling is over the long term, not just saying sweet things in the moment to distract them or sweeten them. It involves listening to them too.</p>\n\n<p>The added proof for this is the words \"Kol Devorecha\", all your words, or, all your things, or, all your issues. The things that matter to you should be spoken about in a considerate, meaningful, helpful fashion. Obviously in such cases you will not be doing all the talking, but as needed there will be give-and-take with the other person. </p>\n\n<p>You are expected to communicate pleasantly and successfully, neither withholding your opinion to close down dialogue, nor dominating angrily. Nachas means confidence, humility, understanding, patience, unravelling, kindness, so you can solve things between you. It's not about the tone of voice (though that may likely be pleasant) but about the <strong>tone of the discussion</strong>. Which involves the other human being.</p>\n\n\n",

Specifically,  in verse 6 God refers to his prince, or annointed one, the mashiach. \nHowever, there are also other understandings (e.g. Rashi) that read the psalm as a description of one of David's wars, to remind the Jews about to fight another nation of God's protection for them.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically regarding verse 7, in the messianic understanding, as I hinted to earlier, daat mikra explains the references to son as follows (description/translation of the commentary mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...God said to me, you are to me as a son and from now on to the future I will be considered your father (rather than your actual father).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In other words, the Jewish king, or mashiach, is being described as a metaphorical son; this is a device used throughout Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the translation you have should not read \"Today I have given birth to you\" rather it's a (metaphorical) description of the future; \"I have given birth\" (past tense) combined with\"today\" means from now on.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The following thorough Hebrew exposition explains why the final verse should not be translated \"kiss the son\":  <a href=\"http://thejewishhome.org/counter/Psa2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thejewishhome.org/counter/Psa2.pdf</a>  He points out that nowhere else in the Psalms is Aramaic used, so why with this one word translate it as though Aramaic (son) instead of Hebrew purity.</p>\n\n<p>As is always the case, truth is much more beautiful than fiction.<br>\nThis means the focus is not on the son in the final verse, but on pure worship of YHWH.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Serve YHWH with fear, and  rejoice with trembling.

If he is punishable, one can assume that he broke the law. So what is the problem for a Jewish man who is involved in intimate relationship with a non-Jewish woman? Bartenura said:\n<blockquote> אֲבָל עָנְשׁוֹ מְפֹרָשׁ עַל פִּי נָבִיא, יַכְרֵת ה' לָאִישׁ אֲשֶׁר יַעֲשֶׂנָּה. וּמַלְקִין אוֹתוֹ אַרְבַּע מַלְקֻיּוֹת מִדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים, מִשּׁוּם נִדָּה, מִשּׁוּם שִׁפְחָה מִשּׁוּם נָכְרִית, מִשּׁוּם זוֹנָה‏\n<br><sup>His punishment was spelled out in the book of Malachi (Mal'achi 2, 12): \"May the LORD cut off to the man that doeth this\", and we punish him by four flagellations for rabbinic prohibitions: Nidda, Slave, Stranger, Prostitute (if he is Cohen), </sup>\n</blockquote>\nIt's seems not current to find a \"Kareth\" in Prophet book that is not found in Pentateuch. In Gemara, we see that Amorayim have great difficulties getting a verse for the prohibition. As summarized in the Bartenura, the standing hypothesis is the verse in Mal'achi. The Rabbinical Prohibition entered into force on a Rabbinical Court at time of Chashmonaym. There are four rabbinical prohibitions whose initials are 'נשג\"ז' (N.Sh.G.Z.).\n<h3>\nWe shall proceed to consider Halacha. Firstly Rambam\n</h3>\n<p>I will try to select only the parts of the Halacha treating a kind of relationship based on sexual drive only, without any cohabitation contract.\nThe begining of the 12<sup>th</sup> chapter of Hilchot Issure Biah.</p>\n<h3>Look only on bold characters</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p><i>Halacha 2</i>\n<br></p>\n<p><b>The Scriptural prohibition applies only to marital relations</b>. When, by contrast, one engages in <b>relations with a gentile woman with a licentious intent, he is given \"stripes for rebellious conduct\" according to Rabbinic Law</b>. [This is a] decree, <h2>lest this lead to marriage.</h2></p>\n<p>If [a Jew] designates [a gentile woman] for licentious relations, he is liable for relations with a niddah, a maid-servant, a gentile woman, and a licentious woman. <b>If he did not designate her for himself, but instead, [engage in relations with her] spontaneously, he is only liable for relations with a gentile woman. All of these liabilities are Rabbinic in origin</b>.\n<br></p>\n<br>\n<p><i>Halacha 6</i>\n<br></p>\n<p>...<b> a person who shares intimacy with a gentile woman is considered as if he married a false deity</b>, as the verse states: \"engaging in relations with <b>the daughter of a foreign god</b>.\" And he is called one who \"desecrated that which is sacred to God.\"\n<br></p>\n<p><i>Halacha 7</i>\n<br></p>\n<p>Although this transgression is not punishable by death penalty by the court, it should not be regarded lightly, for <b>it leads to a detriment that has no parallel among all the other forbidden sexual relationships</b>....<br></p>\n<p><i>Halacha 8</i>\n<br></p>\n<p>This matter causes one <b>to cling to the gentile nation</b> from whom the Holy One, blessed be He, has separated us, and to turn away from following God and to betray Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\nThere's a strong contrast between the lightness of the sin and the severity of consequences. Rambam explains clearly that the problem is the risk for this open relationship to result in a marriage. Each of us is aware of cases. Cases are frequent. This is described as leading to a detriment that has no parallel among forbidden sexual relations. The message is that this is a trap. All intimate relation of this kind lead potentially to assimilation. The Shulchan Aruch E.H., [1](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71266/which-to-choose-relations-with-a-non-jewish-woman-or-wasting-seed), [2](https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71266/which-to-choose-relations-with-a-non-Jewish-woman-or-wasting-seed) is similar.\n<h3>The problem of wasting seed.</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<h3>Gemara Nidda 13a</h3>\nדא\"ר יוחנן: כל המוציא שכבת זרע לבטלה \n<b>‏\nחייב מיתה,\n</b>‏\n שנאמר (בראשית ל\"ח) וירע בעיני ה' (את) אשר עשה וימת גם אותו.\n<p>רבי יצחק ורבי אמי אמרי: כאילו שופך דמים שנאמר (ישעיהו נ\"ז) הנחמים באלים תחת כל עץ רענן שוחטי הילדים בנחלים תחת סעיפי הסלעים, אל תקרי שוחטי אלא סוחטי.</p>\n<p>רב אסי אמר: כאילו עובד עבודת כוכבים, כתיב הכא תחת כל עץ רענן וכתיב התם (דברים יב) על ההרים הרמים ותחת כל עץ רענן.‏</p>\n<h3>\nA verse was put in evidence, Genesis 38, 10: \n</h3>\nוַיֵּ֛רַע בְּעֵינֵ֥י יְהֹוָ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה וַיָּ֖מֶת גַּם-אֹתֽוֹ:‏<br>\nAnd the thing which he did displeased the Lord; therefore he slew him also.<br>\n<i> After first reading, I would argue that the problem is <b>Contraception</b>. He opted for marital relations without \"reproduction\". Chazal explain that he used the method called nowadays \"Withdrawal method\". This method has two consequences: Avoid insemination, extra-corporeal ejaculation (\"on tree and rock\").</i> \n</blockquote>\n<h3>Contextualization after contextualization</h3>\n<p>At beginning, Gemara is commenting the sentence of Mishna \"Every hand that makes frequent examination in the case of men it ought to be cut off\". It is against this background that we must view the sentence of Rabbi Yochanan. Nothing to do with contraception.  Rambam  Issure Bia 21, 18, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=52511&rid=4517\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><b>HERE</b></a>\nreports this sentence on halachot. And in the next sentence he address an other issue, marrying a prepubescent wife:</p>\n<blockquote>\n It is forbidden to release sperm wastefully. Therefore a person should not enter his wife and ejaculate outside of her. A man should not marry a minor who is not fit to give birth.\n<p>Those who, however, release sperm with their hands, beyond the fact that they commit a great transgression...</p>\n</blockquote>\nSee <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=45026&rid=4517\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesharet Moshe</a>. He said that poskim made a difference between wasting seed and spousing a non-fertile wife: The second is only an annulment of Mitsvat Piria Verivia.\n<p>See Rambam. See in Sefer Nishmat Avraham EH 23 in name of R.S.Z. Aurbach that obviously Rambam and Rabenu Tam  do not consider this sin as Scriptural, and so there is no Macat Mardut. But Rabbi Moshe Feinstein does not agree and considers it as a Scriptural Sin.</p>\n<p>To see the problem as a choice between two averot is perhaps not a real problem. <i>To make a sin can not protect against another (the case in Sefer Chassidim is a rare exception for short term resolution). <b>We can say without missing that a man involved in relations with non Jewish women is more dangerous for future, less prohibited for present.</b></i></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't know if this is lechalach, especially since it expresses both as very bad in different ways, but the tanya certainly describes this at the end of chapter 7:</p>\n\n<p>He explains that zera levatala is in one regard worse, because quantitatively, a person who sins such brings many more klipot (\"bad forces\") into the word than by forbidden relations.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, qualitatively, forbidden relations are worse in that (as explained by the Rebbe in a note) when one sins as such, by being with a woman he contributes vitality to a klipa, the female aspect of yesod. By zera levatala there is nothing to absorb vitality in the same way. Therefore, the level of teshuva required for forbidden relations is much higher than for zera levatala (because he must re-raise up the vitality that was absorbed).</p>\n\n<p>Thus, on a basic level zera levatala is worse, but in another aspect forbidden relations are worse.</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, I don't quite understand the above, except that both are quite bad, zera levatala worse on its own, except that the fact you are with a woman in the other case adds an extra level of polluting effect to that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If a man is in a situation where he is tempted by one of the Arayos (e.g. a married woman or a niddah) and he knows that he can withstand the temptation if he were to be motzi zera, a number of sources say that it is preferable for the man to be motzi zera.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.23.1?lang=he&p2=Beit_Shmuel.23.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bais Shmuel to Shulchan Aruch, Even Ha'ezer 23:1</a>, cites the Sefer Chasidim for this ruling and appears to hold that this permitted because intercourse with arayos is a more severe prohibition.  The Chelkas Mechokek and the Be'er Heitev give the same reason.</p>\n<p>But the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.23.1?lang=he&p2=Chokhmat_Shlomo_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.23.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chochmas Shlomo</a> gives a different explanation for the heter.  He argues that if the reason a person is being motzi zera is to prevent himself from violating a prohibition, then the hotzoas zera is not levatala. The man isn't wasting seed, he is using for the positive purpose of refraining from sin.</p>\n<p>I think that the answer to your question depends on whether the halacha follows the Bais Shmuel or the Chochmas Shlomo. According to the Bais Shmuel it is likely that the man should not waste seed because hotzas zera l'vatala is a severe biblical prohibition and relations with a non-Jewish woman only involves Rabbinic prohibitions (most likely).</p>\n<p>According to the Chochmas Shlomo, however, if the man is being motzi zera in order to prevent himself from falling into temptation with a non-Jewish woman, that hotzas zera is not a waste and would be permissible.</p>\n\n\n",

(Cf. Sanhedrin 74a).</p>\n\n<p>That being said, the question still stands: is suicide permissible, or even encouraged after performing a cardinal sin?</p>\n\n<p>From everything we know from the rulings of the Talmud and Geonim, suicide is always forbidden (cf.

(It should be noted that this came up as part of his primary discussion of abortion, which is much more lenient than general murder. His emphasis on the various views on abortion indicates that he likely does not really permit suicide in normal cases. Furthermore, it is not clear to me, how much of what he is saying is a <em>limmud zechut</em>; post hoc justification, and how much of it is <em>l'chatchila</em>)</p>\n\n<p>However, whether he intended this or not, this wild view was rejected in the strongest possible terms by countless successors.</p>\n\n<p>For example, R. Moshe Feinstein writes in Igrot Moshe (CHM 2:69):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה בשאילת יעב\"ץ ח\"א סימן מ\"ג ראיתי דברים שלא נתנו להאמר...וממש דברים בטלים הם אף שכתב זה אדם גדול כהריעב\"ץ,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He describes the statement of Yaavetz, as one that is forbidden to even be mentioned, which constitutes utter \"devarim b'telim\" a derisive term for useless words.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, in no uncertain terms, regardless of the dispute regarding preemptive suicide, it is unquestionably a grievous sin to commit suicide after one has committed a cardinal sin (involving incest, or anything else), a sin liable to death, or any other sin.</p>\n\n<p>It would be an ironic double tragedy, for as noted by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%97%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%9C_%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yechiel Michel Tukatchinsky</a> (Gesher HaChayim ch. 25) death usually brings atonement for sins. How tragic would it be if the death itself was self-inflicted, thus failing to bring atonement and indeed incurring further punishment.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As an aside obviously many if not most suicides are the result of mental illness.

Am I Right?</h3></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The reason for the dagesh in נא is because of a phenomenon known as deḥiq (aka, apparently, ate meraḥiq). Deḥiq is the name for when a word receives an initial dagesh when:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The word before the word getting the deḥiq end in a vowel.</li>\n<li>The stress on the word preceding that with the deḥiq is penultimate (milʿel)</li>\n<li>The stress on the word preceding that with the deḥiq is marked by a conjunctive accent (or a maqef merges the words). </li>\n<li>The stress on the word receiving the deḥiq is on the initial syllable (or one after a shewa naʿ). More rarely, the stress on the word getting the deḥiq is not initial, but an initial secondary stress is present (marked my a gaʿya), e.g. וְעָשִׂ֤יתָ סִּֽירֹתָיו֙ (<a href=\"http://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Ex27:3-27:3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 27:3</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>It appears that siddurim that do not have a dagesh within the nuns of the two נאs are not quoting Tehillim accurately. The verse in Hallel is from <a href=\"http://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Ps118:25-118:25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 118:25</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The words נא in the verse have deḥiqs, because (1) they are preceded by words that end in vowels and (3) conjunctive accents (ṣinnorit): הַצְלִ֘יחָ֥ה , הוֹשִׁ֘יעָ֥ה. Finally, (4) the word נא has initial stress.</p>\n\n<p>Though הַצְלִ֘יחָ֥ה , הוֹשִׁ֘יעָ֥ה have ultimate stress, Yeivin considers thees to be an exceptional case of deḥiq lacking a maqqef (Introduction to the Tiberian Masorah p. 291). There are other exceptional examples of deḥiqs in general, e.g. <a href=\"http://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Jer48:4-48:4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jer 48:4</a>, <a href=\"http://tanach.us/Tanach.xml?Ps17:10-17:10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 17:10</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the function of the deḥiqs is unclear, as is how deḥiq is meant to affect the pronunciation of the text.</p>\n\n<p>See Yeivin's book:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FtuKC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FtuKC.jpg\" alt=\"Introduction to Tiberian Masorah p. 291\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Usage of \"Making Aaliyah\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I had heard that \"Making Aaliyah\" is informally used to mean anyone going to Israel (not necessarily moving there, and not necessarily Jewish) for religious reasons. I was more recently informed that \"While some may use it in that manner, it is not correct terminology. An observant Jew would never do so.\" Can anyone elaborate on this, and why this was apparently offensive? Also, why would the \"observant Jew\" part mean anything, wasn't it used historically just as the definition of the word \"ascent\" and not originally meaning immigration to Israel by one of Jewish descent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>\"Making Aliyah\" is the phrase used for someone moving to Eretz Yisrael permanently. \"Having an Aliyah\" is used for someone being called to the Torah. We say on the yahtzeit (anniversary of a person's death\" that the neshama (soul) should \"have an aliyah\" [rise in (spiritual) status]. In fact, someone leaving Eretz Yisrael is said to be making a yeridah (going down).</p>\n\n<p>We see the usages of the term in a number of places (both religious and secular) such as</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/jw/id/80895027.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Make Aliyah - aish.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nbn.org.il/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nefesh B'Nefesh</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.jewishagency.org/aliyah/program/8651\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Agency</a></p>\n\n<p>As an example of the usage we see</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1584066/jewish/What-Does-Aliyah-Mean.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">What Does Aliyah Mean? </a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The term aliyah, going up to Israel, is used in Genesis in reference\n  to our forefather Jacob’s bones being brought from Egypt to what would\n  be the Land of Israel: “And Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his\n  brothers, and all who had gone up with him to bury his father, after\n  he had buried his father.”1</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmudic sages state that the Land of Israel is higher than all\n  other lands.2 This is not meant in a topographical sense, for clearly\n  this is not the case. Rather, it means that the Holy Land is the most\n  suitable place to relate and connect to the Almighty, and the primary\n  location to lovingly engage in the observance of G‑d’s commandments.\n  In other words, to go there is to be elevated, to go up to a higher\n  level.</p>\n  \n  <p>It is for this reason that anyone “making aliyah,” or moving to Israel\n  for the right reasons, is moving “up” in the world. It is the land in\n  which the holy Patriarchs and Matriarchs lived. It is the land upon\n  which the Holy Temples were built. And, with the advent of the\n  Messianic era, it is the land where the Third Temple will soon be\n  rebuilt. It is truly a holy and elevated place.</p>\n  \n  <p>In life, one must always strive to climb to higher and greater\n  heights. Where appropriate, one must seek elevation, aliyah, whether\n  in location, or even more importantly, within the personal lives,\n  property and confines of every single individual.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Avraham leaving the donkey behind\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Medrash states that Avraham asked Yitzchak what he saw and he answer that he saw the divine presence. However,when he asked Eliezer and Yishmael they both answered that they saw nothing. The passuk says that Avraham left them behind with the donkey. My question is, it is understandable that he left both Eliezer and Yishmael behind, but why leave the donkey which would be helpful carrying the wood for the altar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here's an old chidush of mine which addresses your question. </p>\n\n<p>Many times, if not always, Neviim make a vague statement or perform an act which requires the person or people they are addressing to concentrate on the message. Leaving someone to figure it out themselves seems to be a practical way of having someone accept a message. So we find prophets placing their cloaks upon a new prophet, putting sticks together, telling stories about a poor man's sheep etc the list goes on. </p>\n\n<p>Here, Avraham was hinting to Yitzchok what was going to be happening. He did this by separating the three items, the wood, the knife, and the fire between Yitzchok and himself.\nYitzchok who stood to be consumed, received the wood, the item which also stood to be consumed. Avraham who was to act as the destructive force, took the knife and the fire. With this act he gave a type of hint to Yitzchok.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi on this passuk points out that the words they walked on together mean Avraham was going just as happily as Yitzchok who didn't sense anything. By the next passuk, Yitzchok asks Avraham where is the sacrifice, to which Avraham responds ambiguously, Hashem will show his sacrifice. Rashi points out this was a way of telling Yitzchok if there will be no sheep, than you, Yitzchok will be the offering. \nRashi again notes the second time the Torah mentions them walking together as meaning now they both went with the same degree of intent even though Yitzchok now knew he stood to be slaughtered.</p>\n\n<p>So although the implications are that Yitzchok's curiosity was aroused simply by the missing sheep, I am adding that the first step to that awareness was the dispensing of the sacrificial items. </p>\n\n<p>This symbolic act of Avraham was dependant on his placing the wood on Yitzchok, not upon the donkey.</p>\n\n<p>Hope you like:)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are meforshim who connect the חֲמוֹר with the word חֹמֶר (matter). This means that the entire location of the mizbeach was a holy place and only animals that were acceptable for korbanos could be brought there. This is similar to the halachos of the Bais hamikdash or the Mishkan.</p>\n\n<p>I should note that Yishmael and Eliezer seem to have felt that there was no oddity in doing this so that it may have been the normal procedure. That is that non-sacrificial animals were never brought into the \"sacred area\".</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the mefarshim that speak of Eliezer and Yishmael being treated similarly to the donkey, place the emphasis on that. They do not explicitly say why the donkey was left behind. However, since the two were left behind with the donkey, it can be inferred that the donkey being left behind was the normal and expected behavior that did not need further explanaation.</p>\n\n<p>As an example <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/tp/i/moha/The-First-Matriarch.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aish.com</a> discusses this concept (while explaining another matter)  and brings the medrash</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We recall the discussion between Abraham and Isaac as they headed\n  toward Mount Moriah for the impending sacrifice of Isaac. Abraham\n  looked up and saw a mountain with a peculiar cloud tied to the\n  mountain. Isaac shared this vision, but the others who accompanied\n  them saw only the mountain.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Midrash explains:</p>\n  \n  <p>[Abraham] saw a cloud tied to the mountain, and said: \"It appears that\n  that is the place where the Holy One, blessed be He, told me to\n  sacrifice my son.\" ... He then said to him: \"Isaac, my son, seest thou\n  what I see?\" \"Yes,\" he replied. Said he to his two servants: \"See ye\n  what I see? \" No,\" they answered. [Midrash Rabbah , Genesis 56:1-2)</p>\n  \n  <p>Since the servants saw only the mountain, the physical reality, and\n  not the cloud which represents the metaphysical, Abraham tells them to\n  stay behind with the donkey. (Interestingly, the Hebrew world for\n  \"donkey,\" chamor, is related to the word for \"physical,\" chomer.) Only\n  Abraham and Isaac see the cloud tied to the mountain, and only they\n  will continue the spiritual journey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In Samuel (ibid. 15) it is written: “from Saul.” The reason it is not written here: “so that when he goes astray, etc.” is because of David’s honor, for he does not wish to speak of this in this Book, because it is denigrating to the house of David.</p>\n\n<p>Job 1\nMetzudas tziyon\nThese are the angels that are close to the Shechina to be members of its household.

In that case, one should try bais din first. It would also judge by the religious rules of a different religion rather than secular law so dina d'malchusa would not apply. This <strong>could</strong> be considered chillul Hashem as saying torah law is not adequate.</p>\n<p>Since the question involves settling a dispute with a Muslim, the question is about whether one is settling the situation in a Muslim jurisdiction or not. In a Muslim country, then the halacha would be the same as taking any other nonJew to secular court which (as shown below) is allowed.</p>\n<p>If the jurisdiction is not in a Muslim country, the implications of the discussions (as shown below as well as elsewhere) would seem to be that <strong>unless this is part of the original contract</strong> this is an insult to bais din by implying that the Shariah (which is no different in secular law from bais din) has some sort of superiority to bais din. In that case, one should first attempt to use the bais din as the \"arbitration court\". One should either first suggest this or use the secular court.</p>\n<p>Since each case is different, one should first consult the local bais din as to the reccommended procedure.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=7079\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Practical Halachos of Civil Litigation Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the words of the Rambam (Hilchos Sanhedrin 26:7), \"Whoever has his\ncase judged by non-Jewish laws or courts, even if their laws are the\nsame (as the Torah), is a rosho. It is as if he blasphemed and raised\nhis hand against the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu\". (See also Rashi’s\ncomments on Shmos 21:1). Someone who brought litigation to a secular\ncourt without halachic permission (as described later) may not serve\nas chazan for Yomim Noraim (Mishneh Berurah 53:82). In addition, he\nwill invariably end up with property that is not his according to\nhalacha and transgress the violation of gezel, stealing!</p>\n<p><strong>What Should I Do if the Defendant is Not Jewish?</strong><br />\nA Jew is permitted to sue a non-Jew in secular court.

Dina\ndi’malchusa dina requires us to obey rules of the government such as\npaying taxes and obeying traffic and safety regulations, and prohibits\nus from smuggling and counterfeiting. Dina di’malchusa dina does not\nreplace the civil laws of the Torah (the laws of Choshen Mishpat) that\ngovern the relationships between Jews, nor does it supplant the\nresponsibility incumbent upon the Jew to bring his litigation to a\nproper beis din.</p>\n<p>Dina di’malchusa dina should not be confused with the following\napplication. In some areas of halacha, particularly the contract law\nrules for buying and hiring, there is a concept of minhag hamakom -\nthat normative business practice determines what is halachically\naccepted. For this reason, the halacha regarding sales and employee\nrights are often governed by what is accepted normal practice. Since\nnormal practice is heavily influenced by secular law, the halachic\npractice in these areas is influenced by the secular law. This is not\nbecause halacha recognizes the secular law but because accepted\nbusiness practice is influenced by secular law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The problem of going to a non Jewish court is only if you are going against a Jew but against a non-jew (Muslim) it is permitted (and usually it is the only option)</p>\n<p>See rashi on <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882#v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 21.1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>before them: But not before gentiles.

    "content": "# How many people are needed to eat a korban pesach in one night?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to figure out mathematically how many people were at a typical Pesach seder in the times of the Temple.  I think the number can be approximated from the size, in terms of kosher portions of a typical animal that is suitable for a korban pesach.  With that, we could divide by the size of a typical serving of meat.  In our times that might be 1/4 pound, but since the korban pesach was to be eaten when satiated, it might be 1/8 pound. So this question boils down to how large is a typical animal that is suitable for a korban pesach. (The weight of kosher portions can be estimated by the weight of dressed meat, which might be found on secular websites related to food.)</p>\n<p>Update: Since both a lamb and a kid are valid as a korban pesach, the answer, ideally, would provide information about both.  The age of the korban is relevant, since young animals gain weight with time. The korban pesach must be at most one year old (Zevachim pg 25). I do not know the minimum allowable age. So, the question now asks for answers based on species (lamb or kid) the weight at one year and at the minimum acceptable age.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Enlightened by the approaches taken in other answers and encouraged by the large number of views, I suggest this analysis as an answer to my own question.</p>\n\n<p>There is agreement on the web that dressed weight is about 50% (e,g, sites below). There is less agreement on the weight of a lamb of a year of age or under.</p>\n\n<p>This site gives the weight of lambs at 12 months as 20 kg or 44 lbs.\n<a href=\"http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ilri/x5522e/x5522e06.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/ilri/x5522e/x5522e06.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>This site says the avg weight is 160 lbs at 8 months.\n<a href=\"https://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/4hyouth/sheep/sheepfacts.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.cals.ncsu.edu/an_sci/extension/animal/4hyouth/sheep/sheepfacts.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>This site gives weights of 33 to 55 kg (73 to 120 lbs) for ages of lamb ranging from 4 to 11 months, with the 33 kg for unweaned 4 months of age.\n<a href=\"http://www.makingmorefromsheep.com/market-focussed-lamb-and-sheepmeat-production/procedure_3.1.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.makingmorefromsheep.com/market-focussed-lamb-and-sheepmeat-production/procedure_3.1.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>This site says goats gain 1/3 to 1/2 lbs per day and reach 30 to 40 lbs in 66 to 69 days.\nIt says lambs gain .4 to 1 lb per day.\n<a href=\"http://sheepgoatmarketing.info/education/targetbreeding.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://sheepgoatmarketing.info/education/targetbreeding.php</a></p>\n\n<p>So 3 of these sites that give lamb weight at a year report: 44, 160, and 120 lbs. The low average seems to be an outlier but I will not throw it out.  The average of these 3 estimates is a little over 100 pounds, or dressed weight of 50 lbs.  One site said fats and organs are 3% of weight, so I am ignoring them.</p>\n\n<p>Dressed weight includes bone. This site says some 70-75% of a lamb carcass is meat.\n<a href=\"http://animalscience.psu.edu/extension/meat/pdf/The%20Butcher%20Stole%20My%20Meat.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://animalscience.psu.edu/extension/meat/pdf/The%20Butcher%20Stole%20My%20Meat.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>But raw meat weight is not cooked meat weight. This site says that roasted lamb yields 74%. \n<a href=\"http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400525/Data/retn/USDA_CookingYields_MeatPoultry.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.ars.usda.gov/SP2UserFiles/Place/80400525/Data/retn/USDA_CookingYields_MeatPoultry.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>So, a 100 lb lamb yields 50 pounds of dressed meat, or about 36 lbs of meat to roast, or about 27 pounds after roasting.  Assuming a 1/8 pound serving of meat, that comes to 214 people per korban pesach, on average.</p>\n\n<p>A small lamb of 30 lbs would yield a 1/8 lb serving for 64 people.</p>\n\n<p>At lamb at birth weighs about 7 lbs (per one of the above sites). Assuming the above factors apply, that would be 15 people.</p>\n\n<p>What if the participants were really satiated before eating the koran pesach (perhaps due to eating the korban chagiga), and ate only a k'zayis of meat.  To find out the impact, we need to estimate the weight of a k'zayis of meat. I tried to do that as follows.</p>\n\n<p>If a k'zayis is a cube 1.2\" on edge, or 1.73 cubic inches, and if a cubic foot of water weights 62 lbs, and if meat is mostly water, then one kezayis of meat would weigh 1 oz (if I did the math correctly). If people only ate one k'zayis of meat, the above numbers would have to be multiplied by 2 (since there are 16 oz in a pound or 2 oz in 1/8 lb,)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps lambs are bigger now than they were in the past.  Even so, it seems the seders were large back then.  </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I am trying to figure out mathematically how many people were at a typical Pesach seder in the times of the Temple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Not mathematically, but Josephus (<a href=\"http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0148%3Abook%3D6%3Asection%3D420\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Wars</em> book 6 chapter 9 section 3</a>) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>that feast which is called the Passover, when they slay their sacrifices, from the ninth hour till the eleventh, but so that a company not less than ten belong to every sacrifice… and many of us are twenty in a company</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that Whiston (the translator) had a bias toward this translation.

There <strong>are</strong> discussions of which situations are considered failures of prophetic prediction which prove a prophet false, such as the Rambam's commentary on the Mishna, which I translated <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.com/2004/08/establishing-false-prophet-according.html\">here</a>. But this is a complicated, multifaceted topic and not one I think someone unfamiliar with Jewish literature can just jump into and then expect to hold forth about the topic to try to prove something else.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, Deuteronomy 13:2-6 teaches that even a verified prophet, if suddenly promoting idolatry, is to be disregarded as a false prophet. Similarly (perhaps based on the juxtaposition of Deuteronomy 13:1), if a prophet aims to change the law by adding or subtracting (e.g. abolishing the Law or the Prophets), or even asserting prophetically, in matter of Jewish law, that the law is in accordance with one side of a dispute, he is a false prophet. (See <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1109n.htm\">Rambam Yesodei Hatorah 9:7</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>So, if hypothetically one were to try to apply those trials to some <strong>other</strong> prophet which Jews historically do not accept (based on a work considered fiction by Jews), it would be to no avail if, for instance, that hypothetical prophet were to argue with the Pharisees and say, on the force of his prophecy, for instance, that divorce is only valid in the case of sexual immorality, in accordance with the ruling of Bet Shammai as opposed to Bet Hillel or Rabbi Akiva.</p>\n\n\n",

Electric megaphones or amplifying music would be very different (but are explicitly addressed by R Rozen below)</p>\n\n<p>I didn't find responsa formally addressing megaphones. However here are relevant <em>halachot</em> which relate to your question (taken in part from <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/737920/rabbi-josh-flug/prohibitions-relating-to-producing-sound-on-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow\">YUOnline</a> and <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=198&ArticleID=283#a4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Zomet</a>)</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Gemara, Eruvin 104a, notes that there is a prohibition against engaging in an activity for the purpose of producing sound on Shabbat. The Gemara records a dispute as to whether this prohibition includes all forms of sound or whether it is limited to music. <strong>Most Rishonim are of the opinion that the conclusion of the Gemara is that only music is prohibited.</strong> Rambam (1135-1204), Hilchot Shabbat 23:4, also follows the opinion that the prohibition is limited to music. <strong>He explains that the prohibition is a rabbinic prohibition based on a concern that it may lead one to fix a musical instrument</strong></li>\n<li>R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (in Kovetz Ma’amarim, p. 41) writes that it is true that it is forbidden to make a voice heard on Shabbat by means of an instrument specifically made for this purpose, such as a record player; but the reason for this prohibition is that turning on the instrument on Shabbat is forbidden. If, however, the device was turned on before Shabbat, <strong>we have not found that the Sages forbade one to speak or sing only because his voice passes through the device and is then heard from a distance</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Writing in a different but related context (the use of microphones on shabbat), R Yisrael Rozen from Zomet (the Institute for Science and Torah) writes about different factors enabling the use of some microphones in some situations which could be relevant here, e.g.,</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>One may not hold the microphone in his hand; it should be set up as a\nfree-standing unit</li>\n<li>The system should be clearly labeled as operating in accordance with Halacha</li>\n<li>Use of the microphone is restricted to mitzva cases, and only where there is a great need</li>\n<li>One may not play music instruments over a microphone, even by means of a radio set on a timer, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Rav Shaul Yisraeli agreed with the above criteria, so did R Chaim David Halevi (Chief Rabbi and Chief Rabbinic Judge of Tel Aviv) and R Pinchas Baruch Toledano (a dayan in London)</p>\n\n<p>So it might be that using a megaphone can be justified in certain circumstances, e.g., if held in a fixed position (and not by hand), if it cannot be repaired or adjusted, if all know that it is approved and if it is for the sake of a mitsva (e.g., to amplify a sermon in a synagogue). It is a bit puzzling why it is not more commonly used so there might be additional reasons to forbid it.</p>\n\n<p>As always you need to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/10103/how-do-you-cylor-after-posting-on-judaism-stackexchange-com\">CYLOR</a> for a specific ruling.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Shu't Shvus Yaakov chelek 3 siman 31 <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1519&st=&pgnum=214\" rel=\"nofollow\">seen here on the bottom of the first column</a> discusses a type of device which was able to carry someone's voice many מילים away.

The best answer I have received is that if God is recognized by another commonly used name, even if it is not in Hebrew, you should not write it fully. This was very confusing for me because God is known by many names in English such as Heaven, Providence, Lord, He/Him and others. Even in the translations that had G-d Lord was not hyphenated. God is also known very widely in Hebrew as Hashem, which is usually abbreviated in Hebrew, but not in English transliteration or speech. I do not know for sure, but I also doubt that Allah is hyphenated or abbreviated in when a Jew is referring to God in Arabic. Why do some people write G-d and why are the other common names of God ignored in this respect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When we wrote the <a href=\"http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-03-01.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">soc.culture.jewish FAQ</a> we dealt with this question as follows. Note that one of the students who had been in the class at the time that Rav Soloveitchik wrote the name \"God\" and erased it verified that the story is true.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Writing: Why do some people write \"G-d\" with a hyphen instead of an\n  `o'?</p>\n  \n  <p>Answer:</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on the words in Deut. 12:3-4, the Rabbis deduced that it is\n  forbidden to erase the name of G-d from a written document. Since any\n  paper upon which G-d's name was written might be discarded and thus\n  \"erased\", the Rabbis forbade explicitly writing the name of G-d,\n  except in Holy Books, with provisions for the proper disposal of such\n  books.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Jewish Folklore, G-d has 70 names. However, only one of\n  these names is the ineffable name, which cannot be erased or\n  pronounced. Further, of the 70 names, seven may not be erased but they\n  can be pronounced on certain occasions (such as when reading the\n  Torah). The other names may be erased and pronounced, but still must\n  be treated with respect. The Talmud (Shevuot 35a-b) makes it clear\n  that this prohibition applies only to seven Biblical names of G-d and\n  not to other names or attributes of G-d, which may be freely written.\n  The prohibition was later codified by Maimonides (Mishneh Torah,\n  Yesodei HaTorah 6:1-2). The practice of writing \"G-d\" is supported in\n  Shut Achiezer, 3:32, end, where it is endorsed and accepted as the\n  prevailing custom. Rambam cites Deut. 12-03:04, which states \"and you\n  shall destroy the names of pagan gods from their places. You shall not\n  do similarly to G-d your Lord.\" The intent of this is to create an\n  atmosphere of respect for G-d's name vs pagan gods names.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a result of this, people acquired the habit of not writing the full\n  name down in the first place. Strictly speaking, this only applies to\n  Hebrew on a permanent medium, but many people are careful beyond the\n  minimum, and have applied it to non-Hebrew languages. Hence, \"G-d\".\n  One explanation is that using G-d is a reminder that anything which we\n  may say about G-d is necessarily metaphorical. Spelling out the Name\n  (even in a language other than Hebrew) would imply that one could\n  speak meaningfully (not just metaphorically) about G-d.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the Shach (Yoreh De'a 179:11) ruled that \"God\" spelled in a\n  foreign language does NOT have the status of a \"shem\" and thus may be\n  erased, lehatkhila. There is a story about Rav Soloveitchik (z\"l)\n  intentionally writing GOD on the board while teaching a class and then\n  just as deliberately and intentionally erasing it, so as to\n  demonstrate by his own example that this was not a halakhically a\n  problem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Belief in demons, though not very pronounced in Jewish\n  life and thought, is still prevalent, in a semi-comical way, at the\n  level of folklore. Even some of the learned feel compelled to accept,\n  perhaps not too seriously, belief in demons because this belief is\n  implied in the Talmud in many places.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Some of the medieval thinkers accepted the belief in demons. Others\n  rejected the belief as contrary to the doctrine of divine providence.\n  Why should God have surrendered His control of the universe, on some\n  occasions, into the power of such creatures?</p>\n  \n  <p>Abraham Ibn Ezra rejects entirely the notion that demons really exist.\n  Maimonides either ignores the talmudic references to demons or gives\n  these a rationalistic explanation; as, for example, when he\n  understands the mishnaic reference to an ‘evil spirit’ against which a\n  light can be put out even on the Sabbath, to mean a spirit of\n  melancholy.</p>\n  \n  <p>Menahem Meiri generally follows a similar demythologizing tendency\n  when he understands the talmudic reference to warding off the demons\n  by reciting the Shema before retiring as meaning that evil thoughts\n  invade the mind at bedtime and these can successfully be dispelled\n  through the recitation of the Shema.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p>Belief in demons is thus generally present but very peripheral in the\n  Jewish scheme. No representative thinker, for instance, ever thought\n  of dubbing Ibn Ezra a heretic because he refused to believe in demons.\n  Needless to say, sophisticated Jewish thinkers who did believe in the\n  existence of demons did not think of these as little devils with\n  forked tails breathing fire but <strong>as spiritual forces which God has\n  unleashed in the world for purposes of His own, or as harmful\n  psychological processes which take place in the human mind.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This being said there is a statement in the Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.16a.18?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chagiga 16</a>a) stating that demons have three characteristics in common with people</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They eat and drink like humans, they are fruitful and multiply [ie.\n  they have children] like humans, and they die like humans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>but it is not further developed and there is no example of a demon eating people anywhere in the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>Finally see this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/729/sheidim-are-they-fact-or-fiction\">related question on MiYodeya</a> and complete <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/demons.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">overview</a> taken from Encyclopedia Judaica.</p>\n\n\n",

And if she curses him for no reason, she is divorced without her ketubah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's a real case from Haifa's Bais Din with a lot of sources: <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/psk/psk.asp?id=1471\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בית הדין האזורי חיפה</a>.</p>\n<p>But let me elaborate a bit about the procedure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Halakha outlines certain responsibilities   of a husband toward his wife and limitations to his behavior.    Violations of those responsibilities or misbehavior can be seen as    <em><strong>a ground for divorce</strong></em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It should be clear, however, that it is unanimously accepted, that a wife is\n(a kind of) her husband's property, as she's acquired through a\nKosher Kiddushin procedure. <strong>The only Kosher way of getting out of Jewish marriage is for the husband to willingly let his wife leave</strong> (i.e. the Get).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Practically, even though the standard phrasing of the Kiddushin ceremony says \"כדת משה וישראל\" (based on Moses and Israel tradition), a Beis Din can not rule the divorce or annul the marriage (it can only invalidate it if it finds if faulty, like non Kosher witnesses), but only <strong>try to force the husband to willingly divorce</strong>. This implies some psychological and social pressure, boycotting, possible financial sanctions, but no more. Even in cases when the Halokhah is strict about the necessity to divorce, it uses the wording \"יוציא ויתן כתובה\" (he will divorce and pay the Kesubah), but it still depends solely on the husband's will.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Back to your question, a <strong>wife can demand and claim whatever she pleases before any Beis Din</strong>. As the Kiddushin is not required to be approved by a Bais Din, the husband can refuse to show up or to refuse a Bais Din's right to judge him, and there's nothing his wife can do about it. Even if he appears and accepts its right to judge him, he can deny all accusations. We need witnesses and evidences etc, and that can go for years, and the husband cal run away altogether and leave her Agunah. But, let's say the husband accepts all the charges and the Bais Din rules he has to divorce and pay the Kesubah. Unfortunately it has no practical power.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you read the case to the end you can found the verdict:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מסקנות</strong></p>\n<p>א. בית הדין מחייב את הבעל בגט.</p>\n<p>ב. על הצדדים לפתוח תיק לסידור הכגט</p>\n<p>ג. אם הבעל יסרב ליתן גט בית הדין ידון בצווי הגבלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(translation: <strong>the verdict:</strong> We obligate the husband to set the Get (divorce), if he will refuse, <strong>the Bais Din <em>will discuss an option</em> to restrict husband's ability to leave Israel</strong>.</p>\n<p>To sum it up, although the Halokhah recognizes domestic violence as a ground for divorce, it has little of practical meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While I cannot speak to the sources (I am not the author, who oddly enough includes sources elsewhere), many of the cases in which a woman forfeits her right to the <em>kesubah</em> are delineated by Chazal.</p>\n\n<p>If the wife commits adultery, spitefully withholds relations, or makes her husband commit <em>aveiros</em> (such as feeding him non-kosher or having him <em>bo'el niddah</em> by not going to the <em>mikvah</em>) then this would result in forfeiture of her rights to the <em>kesubah.</em> Note that some might make exceptions in the last case, such as a husband who habitually eats non-kosher being fed non-kosher food by his wife. </p>\n\n<p>A woman demanding a <em>get</em> does not automatically forfeit her rights to the kesubah, especially where, as in the cases your article discusses, it is appropriate for the court to \"use it's muscle\" to coerce the husband into divorcing his wife.</p>\n\n<p>Note that none of this precludes the possibility of the <em>get</em> being given under the condition that the wife pay the husband the value of her <em>kesubah</em> (or otherwise forfeit her right to the payment), though a <em>Beis Din</em> might refuse to commission a <em>get</em> containing such a condition.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Group Kaddish for Ashkenazim – Sources\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I'm aware, the historical practice of Ashkenazim was to have only one person recite each Kaddish. This is derived from the Gemara in Megillah (~21b) where it is said that תרי קלי לא משתמעי, \"two voices are not heard [together].\" This also fits with a midrashic statement that saying יהא שמה is a comfort to the neshamah of the deceased (citation needed).</p>\n\n<p>While German-influenced kehillot still often oppose the group Kaddish, it has become fairly common in most circles. In some non-Orthodox communities, everyone will say each Kaddish together, so that there is no one to say אמן or יהא שמה!</p>\n\n<p>What sources are provided for the practice of group Kaddishin among Ashkenazim, especially with regards to תרי קלי and saying/responding יהא שמה? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2014/01/may-multiple-people-say-kaddish-simultaneously/\" rel=\"nofollow\">May Multiple People Say Kaddish Simultaneously?</a> goes through a long analysis of the subject but does not come to a conclusion as to when the minhag changed. He does point out that Rav Yaakov Emden suggested it and the Chasam Sofer rejected it. Rav Yaakov Ettinger rejected the suggestion fiercely as being akin to the reform. The article states that it is not clear when the minhag changed. The full article is too long for here but I have put in short excerpts to explain it. Note the dates of some of the Rabbanim referenced which seem to imply that the minhag did not change until <strong>at least</strong> the end of the nineteenth century.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Finally, the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (135:6) (<em>Shlomo Ganzfried 1804 - 1830</em>) rules that multiple men\n  should not recite Kiddush simultaneously if there are people listening\n  who need to hear the Kiddush in order to fulfill their mitzvah. \n  Whether or not it is necessary for a mourner to recite Kaddish alone\n  may well depend on the reason for reciting it. </p>\n  \n  <p>As noted earlier, Rav Yaakov Emden suggested that we follow the\n  Sephardic practice of having all of the mourners recite Kaddish\n  together, but was met with significant criticism from the Chasam\n  Sofer. The Chasam Sofer (Moses Schreiber (1762–1839)) argues that we cannot change ancient\n  Ashkenazic practice, and suggesting such a simple solution would imply\n  that the extensive discussions in earlier sources relating to who has\n  precedence in reciting Kaddish were all misguided – a charge not\n  easily leveled against the Torah giants of previous centuries.\n  Similarly, Rav Yaakov Etlinger  (17 March 1798 – 7 December 1871) (ibid) was asked about a community in\n  which many shuls with different customs had merged. The rabbi of the\n  combined shul decided that in order to preserve peace, all of the\n  mourners would be permitted to recite Kaddish together. Quite proud of\n  his idea, the rabbi presented it to Rabbi Ettlinger. Rabbi Ettlinger’s\n  reaction was fierce: “How can you consider changing a custom that has\n  been observed in all Ashkenazic countries for more than 300 years and\n  claim it is a ‘great and appropriate’ idea?! You are following closely\n  on the heels of the revolutionary thinkers of our time who have\n  changed various customs relating to tefillah!”</p>\n  \n  <p>As noted previously, in contemporary shuls it is very common for all\n  of the mourners to recite Kaddish simultaneously. <strong>This is clearly not\n  the traditional Ashkenazic practice and it is not entirely clear when\n  the practice changed.</strong> While contemporary poskim do not demand\n  reverting back to the ancient practice,4 they do remain sensitive to\n  the concern of not being able to hear two voices simultaneously. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It has a mechanical voice (not a recorded human voice) that you can use to hear any portion in any of a couple dozen <em>trop</em> systems.  (You can also change the voice's pitch and speed to match your own voice, for people who are using this software to actually learn <em>trop</em>.)  I've used the audio in the past, though these days I use this software mainly to print practice sheets.

Thus, if the parents hadn't finished the conversion process when the baby was born, the baby's not Jewish, either, and thus a bris wouldn't do anything. Thus, it would seem to me that the baby would also need to go through the conversion process and would get his bris as a part of that as any male would during the geirus. </p>\n\n<p>It's worthy to note that since, according to my possibly flawed logic above, the baby's not Jewish yet, before his Bar Mitzvah he would have the opportunity to completely reject Yiddishkeit if he so chooses.</p>\n\n\n",

In summary</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>an adopted child can convert, instead of his parents accepting responsibility for the child decision, it is the rabbinical tribunal (<em>beit din</em>) supervising the conversion which acts as the child’s surrogate parents and accepts his conversion</li>\n<li>if the child convert decides on reaching maturity (12 for a girl, 13 for a boy) that he does not want to be Jewish, he invalidates his conversion and reverts to being a gentile (Igrot Moshe YD 1:162) </li>\n<li>once the child achieves maturity and is living an observant lifestyle, this is considered an acceptance of the conversion that cannot be rejected afterwards</li>\n<li>if the child wasn't told before his bar/bat mitsva that he is a convert, and only discovers it as an adult, R Moshe Feinstein writes he would have the option at that time to accept or reject his Judaism, and the parents have limited influence on his decision</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>As such, if the person you describe has been properly converted (see below) and hasn't renounced Judaism at age 12 or when discovering she was a convert, she is fully Jewish. One does not need to reaffirm one's Jewishness and does not lose one's Jewish status.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Two further important notes</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The question whether it is possible <em>a priori</em> to covert a child in a non-religious family is very involved, see e.g., <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2022/No.%204/The%20Conversion%20Of.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a description of the issues, including the opinion of the Sridei Eish that the <em>beit din</em> has no authority to implement such a conversion</li>\n<li>It is not obvious such a child could be converted today. For instance, in the US, the RCA policies (<a href=\"http://judaismconversion.org/geirus-policies-and-standards/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, see 5b) require that the child be raised in an observant family and attend Jewish day school for 12 years.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For further reading, see also <a href=\"https://hirhurim.blogspot.com/2009/01/child-conversions.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I assume you are asking in theory.

We only find [God] nullifying a positive prophecy during the destruction of the first Temple. He had promised the righteous that they would not die together with the wicked; however, He nullified this prophecy, as explained in the tractate of Shabbat. (Translation from Chabad with minor edits).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This view has become mainstream; for example, here is an excerpt from Chabad.org's <em><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/84902/jewish/What-Is-Prophecy.htm#Howare\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">What is Prophecy?</a></em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[O]nce a Divine promise of good is communicated through a prophet it is never retracted; however, if the prophet warns, in the name of G‑d, that a calamity is destined to befall, and it does not occur, this does not disprove his prophecy, since a decree of evil can be removed through prayer and repentance.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.18.5-10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 18:5-10</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ה וַיְהִי דְבַר-יְהוָה, אֵלַי לֵאמוֹר.  ו הֲכַיּוֹצֵר הַזֶּה לֹא-אוּכַל לַעֲשׂוֹת לָכֶם, בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל--נְאֻם-יְהוָה; הִנֵּה כַחֹמֶר בְּיַד הַיּוֹצֵר, כֵּן-אַתֶּם בְּיָדִי בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל.  {ס}  ז רֶגַע אֲדַבֵּר, עַל-גּוֹי וְעַל-מַמְלָכָה, לִנְתוֹשׁ וְלִנְתוֹץ, וּלְהַאֲבִיד.  ח וְשָׁב, הַגּוֹי הַהוּא, מֵרָעָתוֹ, אֲשֶׁר דִּבַּרְתִּי עָלָיו--וְנִחַמְתִּי, עַל-הָרָעָה, אֲשֶׁר חָשַׁבְתִּי, לַעֲשׂוֹת לוֹ.  {ס}  <strong>ט וְרֶגַע אֲדַבֵּר, עַל-גּוֹי וְעַל-מַמְלָכָה, לִבְנוֹת, וְלִנְטוֹעַ.  י וְעָשָׂה הרעה (הָרַע) בְּעֵינַי, לְבִלְתִּי שְׁמֹעַ בְּקוֹלִי--וְנִחַמְתִּי, עַל-הַטּוֹבָה, אֲשֶׁר אָמַרְתִּי, לְהֵיטִיב אוֹתוֹ.</strong></p>\n<p>5 Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying: 6 'O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay in the potter's hand, so are ye in My hand, O house of Israel. {S} 7 At one instant I may speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up and to break down and to destroy it; 8 but if that nation turn from their evil, because of which I have spoken against it, I repent of the evil that I thought to do unto it. {S} <strong>9 And at one instant I may speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; 10 but if it do evil in My sight, that it hearken not to My voice, then I repent of the good, wherewith I said I would benefit it.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam surely knew Yirmiyahu, and therefore how could he hold his opinion that prophecies of good could not be revoked? Is this truly a contradiction, as it clearly seems to be? And, practically, should we stop teaching this Rambam in our Chinuch institutions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Rambam knew the pasuk in Yirmeyahu. Just because one has a question based on a plain-text interpretation of a verse, that doesn't mean that people should stop teaching the Rambam. There are many Biblical verses, and many Mishnayot that are interpreted in ways other than what the plain-text meaning seems to be.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam designed his framework based on other pesukim, including others in Yirmeyahu. The clash between Yirmeyahu and Chananya ben Azzur sets the stage that a public prophecy for good has no \"out\", and thus would be concrete evidence that Chananya is a false prophet.</p>\n\n<p>Here are three ways the Rambam might have interpreted that verse, namely \nוְרֶגַע אֲדַבֵּר, עַל-גּוֹי וְעַל-מַמְלָכָה, לִבְנוֹת, וְלִנְטוֹעַ. י וְעָשָׂה הרעה (הָרַע) בְּעֵינַי, לְבִלְתִּי שְׁמֹעַ בְּקוֹלִי--וְנִחַמְתִּי, עַל-הַטּוֹבָה, אֲשֶׁר אָמַרְתִּי, לְהֵיטִיב אוֹתוֹ</p>\n\n<p>1) Radak, that it is regret but not retraction:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך שמע נא - הענין הזה שאמר לו כי בהבטחת הטובה יבחן הנביא כי אם יבטיח טובה ולא תבא בידוע שהוא נביא שקר כי כל דבר טוב שיבטיח האל אפילו על תנאי הוא בא אבל באמת תסור ממנו הטובה ההיא אם יחטא כמו שאמר ורגע אדבר על גוי ועל ממלכה לבנות ולנטוע ועשה הרע בעיני ונחמתי על הטובה אמנם על כל פנים תחול הטובה ותבא אבל אם יתנבא לרעה ולא תבא כלל לא יודע בזה שהוא נביא שקר שהקב\"ה ארך אפים ורב חסד ונחם על הרעה כשעשו תשובה כמו שעשה באנשי נינוה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, when the pasuk says וְנִחַמְתִּי, it means that Hashem regrets it. But that regret doesn't mean that He retracts it.</p>\n\n<p>2) Abarbanel, in how the Rambam would have to interpret it as a private communication:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכמה ספקות נתחייבו לדעתו זה. אם ראשונה שלפי דרכו זה יצטרך לפרש אשר ידבר הנביא בשם ה' וגומר ביעוד הטוב לא ביעוד הרע ויפרש מאמר ירמיהו (סימן י\"ח) רגע אדבר על גוי ועל ממלכה לבנות ולנטוע כשיהיה הדבור לנביא לעצמו ולא שיהיה לנביא שלוח לזולתו. והתנאים והחלוקים האלה לא נזכרו בכתובים. והיה מבואר הקושי אחר שיעמיס הכתובים על כרחם לאמר מה שלא נמצא בהם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, that perforce the communication (dibur) was to the prophet as a private communication but not one to deliver to the people.</p>\n\n<p>3) Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi, that the dibur here is thought.</p>\n\n<p>(See Bereishit 8:2 for vayomer el libo:\nוַיֹּאמֶר ה אֶל-לִבּוֹ לֹא-אֹסִף לְקַלֵּל עוֹד אֶת-הָאֲדָמָה בַּעֲבוּר הָאָדָם)\nsomething internally)</p>\n\n<p>Mizrachi writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שכל דבר טובה שיאמר האל אפילו על תנאי אינו חוזר. וליכא לאקשויי מקרא ד\"רגע אדבר על גוי ועל ממלכה לבנות ולנטוע ועשה הרעה בעיני לבלתי שמוע בקולי ונחמתי על הטובה\" (ירמיהו יח, ט - י), דהתם בדבור של מחשבה קמיירי, כלומר רגע אחשוב על גוי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>4) Something else not spelled out above. Just as the above three interpretations wouldn't necessarily occur to someone who spots an apparent contradiction, so too other interpretations might not necessarily occur. I would not jump to the conclusion that the extremely learned Rambam forgot an explicit verse.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Judaica Press explains in Yirmiyahu 18:9 that there is a machlokes between Rambam on the one hand and Abarbene and Ibn Nachmiash on the other hand about this matter. Rambam holds that the prophesy (by a true prophet) will come about but if the people sin, it will not last. </p>\n\n<p>I have also seen referenced (about the decree at Rosh Hashana for the coming year) that if for example the decree is for rain, if the people sin, the rain may come but fall in a counterproductive manner.</p>\n\n<p>Radak also says that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>in the case of an unfavorable prophecy, repentance helps to avoid the\n  evil completely, whereas, in the case of the favorable prophesy, the\n  good <strong>must</strong> come about in any case, only that if the people become\n  wicked, it does not remain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, this is explained as not having been a prophesy, but as a decree based on what the people deserve. Hashem had wanted to decree good for Bnai Yisrael, but the constant evil behavior had caused them to merit punishment.</p>\n\n\n",

A certain man said to him, <strong>'it is written \"לעלם\"'</strong></p>\n<p>Rav Avina asked about a contradiction, '<strong>It is written \"This is My Name forever</strong> (Ex. 3:15)\" [and it is written] \"this is my Remembrance for generations (ibid)\"? The Holy One Blessed be He said, 'Not the way I am written, am I called.

And it is written 'this is My Remembrance' which implies [actual] calling and not hiding. Another explanation: Since it says 'this is My Name' obviously 'this is my Remembrance'. How else would He be called except by His Name?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To paraphrase:\nThe Talmud asks about the verse in Zech. 14:9 that says that <em>in the Messianic Age</em> G-d will be One and His Name would be One. The implication being that <em>now</em>, G-d's and His Name are not one. The explanation the Talmud gives is that today we are meant to call G-d's Name as Ad-nai (אדנ-י) when we are referring to the Tetragrammaton. However in the future, we will call G-d's Name by the way it is spelled.</p>\n<p>The Talmud then mentions a story where a person teaches a Rabbi, that when it says \"this is My Name forever\" the word forever is spelled missing a letter to allude to the alternate meaning of that root - to hide. And the intent of the verse is to teach that this Name is meant to be hidden, not pronounced.</p>\n<p>Lastly - following the theme of the passage, a Rabbi points out a contradiction within the verse of Ex. 3:15. Rashi provides two interpretations to the contradiction:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first part of the verse is meant to teach us to hide and not utter G-d's Name, but the second part of the verse uses the word \"Remembrance (זכר)\". This word also has a connotation of 'calling' and indicates that G-d's Name <em>is</em> meant to be called this way.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Once the verse said, \"this is My Name\", obviously we are meant to call G-d by this name and the words \"this is my Remembrance\" is superfluous.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Rabbi answers that its teaching us that the way we are meant to write G-d's Name is not the same as the way we are meant to say it.</p>\n<p>In practice we are taught in Shulchan Aruch O\"C 5:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יכוין בברכות פירוש המלות. כשיזכיר השם, יכוין פירוש קריאתו באדנות שהוא אדון הכל, ויכוין בכתיבתו ביו\"ד ה\"א שהיה והוה ויהיה.</p>\n<p>Have intent of the meaning of the words when making blessings. When mentioning the Tetragrammaton: intend its read form of 'Ad-nai' that He is the Master of all. And intend its written form of 'יו\"ד ה\"א' that He was He is and He will be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Judaism, there are 2 God concepts, there is the non-verbal transcedental awareness of God (atah - you) and there is a verbalised awareness of God known as the name of God.</p>\n\n<p>We are promised that even if we only have access to the verbalised awareness of God, He will still respond to our situation.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, even if God awareness has not penetrated to our inner core, He will still take care of us.</p>\n\n<p>This does not mean that God's name is a magic charm, it means that we are aware of our incapacity to always remain at a level of pure conciousness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In this particular question, the citations are referring to two different ideas.</p>\n\n<p>The first citation from Joel is referring to the time of the final redemption and the <em>days of Moshiach</em>.

A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the\n  water, sprinkle it on the tent, on all the vessels, on the persons who\n  were there, or on the one who touched a bone, the slain, the dead, or\n  a grave.

Like say in Israel when they have wars, if a Jew touches a dead body is there still a water of separation?  Do they have waters of separation here in the United States?  I know there are still Kohanim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No such thing exists today for a few reasons</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>There would need to be a red hefer that does not have two consecutive non red hairs and has not had any type of burden placed on it or preformed any sort of labor</li>\n<li>After the destruction of the second Beis HaMikdash (holy temple) the Jews were considered to be on a lower spiritual level (tumas hames) and therefore incapable of making the mixture needed to make others pure. The mixture must be prepared by a pure cohein and when all the Jews are impure after the destruction of the beis hamikdash it cannot be prepared right now.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is a tradition that says the last \"para aduma\" that was made into these waters was hidden away to be found when moshiach (the messiah) comes. Since it is already made there will be some cohanim who will be able to make themselves pure with it and also make more to then make the rest of the Jewish people pure so we may enter the Beis HaMikdash (holy temple)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Properly addressing this question involves dealing with a large amount of Jewish source material - about a quarter of the Mishna (by length) deals with the laws surrounding ritual impurity.</p>\n\n<p>The short answer is no - we do not posses the \"waters of separation\" anymore, as you called it. </p>\n\n<p>The rabbis decreed long ago that the land outside of Israel was considered to convey ritual impurity as a dead body since (among other reasons) it is possible that one may traverse an unmarked grave. It is debated in the Talmud whether this impurity is only through contact or even through proximity. Thus, anyone living outside of the land of Israel would be automatically considered impure as if they had touched a dead body.</p>\n\n<p>This isn't particularly problematic, as this level of impurity needs cleansing predominantly to avoid the sin of entering the Holy Temple in an impure state. No temple, ergo no clear prohibition and no requirement to purify yourself before entry. There are other issues regarding tithing priestly gifts, but there are solutions to those that avoid infringing on biblical commandments.</p>\n\n<p>The process of gathering the water requires a setup where the water carrier is guarded from birth from encountering death impurity (Parah 3:2), which is not something we do nowadays since 1) most people are assumed already impure and 2) as above, there's no specific need for the water since impurity itself is not a sin. </p>\n\n<p>Technically, kohanim are forbidden from making themselves impure from having contact with a dead body and from participating in burial with non-family members. The prohibition here is the act the Kohen takes (or his lack of avoiding impurity), not the state of impurity itself.</p>\n\n<p>The production of the ashes for the water appears to require the presence of the temple (3:8) which we no longer have. You promenade the heifer on ramp from the temple to Har Hamishcha (3:7) It also requires that the Kohen performing the ceremony be held in a special chamber in the Temple and sanctified with the waters of separation with ashes from a previous red heifer. (3:1)</p>\n\n<p>Despite this last point, the law dictates that some of the ashes are preserved separately in order to perform the purification ritual under circumstances where the production of new ashes isn't available, such as in the current day. Unfortunately, I do not think anyone has found a cache of ancient red heifer ashes suitable for the reinstatement of complete ritual purity, nor is anyone setting up a \"ritual clean room\" to ensure there are children raised in complete purity to allow them to gather the water.</p>\n\n<p>Even according to those opinions who state that we might be able to make the ashes without the Temple being built (that the portions of the Mishnah regarding the temple were historical and not legislative), no one has actually done so, and thus we do not have them in the modern day.</p>\n\n\n",

Maimonides explains that people,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"began to build temples to the stars and to offer them sacrifices, and\n  to sing their praises and to bow down to the stars, out of the false\n  belief that they were thereby fulfilling the desire of the Creator.\"\n  (MT, Hilkhot Avodat Kokhavim, 1:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In his commentary to Leviticus 17:7, Nachmanides notes Deuteronomy 32:17, “They [the Israelites] sacrificed to demons who are\nnot G-d.” Onkelos ( renders “demons” literally but deviates from the notion that\nthere are other gods, instead he substitutes “for whom there is no need.” The targumist derived this idea from the Midrash Sifrei: </p>\n\n<p>“Had they worshipped the sun and the moon . . . things the world needs and which produce delight, this would not have increased G-d’s anger; but they worshipped things that\ndo not benefit them, and which harm them.\"[2]</p>\n\n<p>Idols are statues, which grew out of worshiping stars. </p>\n\n<p>[1] For proof of Maimonides' statements, refer to the ancient Egyptians who worshiped the sun god, which they felt was one.</p>\n\n<p>[2] Onkelos often relyed on tannaitic Midrashim.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it permitted to wear tzitzit (tallit katan) without wearing a kipa?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Tsitsit is a Mitsva written in the Torah for men wearing some clothes fulfilling conditions of form and composition. Kippa is a custom linked to good character and humility. Both are excellent. As you can place Tefilin without Tsitsit and Brit milah without Tefilin, the lack of Kippa does not prevent the Mitsvat Tsitsit. It is obvious. Maybe I will add later some Chazal quotes.</p>\n\n<h3>Kippa:</h3>\n\n<p>Gemara Kiddushin 31b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Huna son of Rav Joshua would not walk four cubits bareheaded, saying: The Shechinah is above my head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Gemara this is presented as an great compliment about a great Chacham, as humility.</p>\n\n<p>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim 2, 6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אָסוּר לֵילֵךְ בְּקוֹמָה זְקוּפָה וְלֹא יֵלֵךְ ד' אַמּוֹת בְּגִלּוּי הָרֹאשׁ: : ‏<br>\n  This is prohibited to walking head up, They do not walk 4 cubits bare-headed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nowaday Kippa has a great signification as the famous \"ערקבא דמסאנא\" (shoe strap; According to Rashi Jews where tying shoelaces differently, not because Mitsva but because modesty, other commentaries says that the color of laces was different). So Bish'at Hashmad may be Yehareg veAl yaavor not least, if no more, than Tsitsit Katan.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to some, you have to wear a Kippah outside in Public, but according to others less strict you only wear a kippah during prayers. The reason why we wear a kippah is because it reminds us of the Shechina and its bacially showing respect to HaShem. Also it shows that (when out in public) you are Jewish. I am just like you buddy, I wear kippah most of the time at school, and always wear tzitzit.But Boruch HaShem that I am going to yeshiva next year. I pray that you do to.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does God hate sexual immorality?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After failing to curse the Jewish people, Bilaam advised Balak to lure the Jews into sexual immorality \"for their God hates zimah\" (Sanhedrin 106a). We also find that many cases of forbidden relations incur capital punishment (Lev.20). And before the Flood in Noah's time: \"the earth was corrupt before God.. for all flesh corrupted their way\" (Gen. 6:17), Rabbi Yishmael says - this refers to sexual immorality (Sanhedrin 57a).</p>\n\n<p>Why is this so hateful in God's eyes? Is it due to the consequences of the breakdown of family or some other reason?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbi <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayer_Twersky\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mayer Twersky</a> writes:</p>\n\n<p>Rashi, commenting on the verse \"you shall be holy\" (Vayikra 19:2) states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"abstain from sexual immorality ... because wherever you find\n  abstention from sexual immorality you find holiness\"... Seforno\n  establishes an equation between holiness and eternity. Thus, to be\n  holy means to be forever preoccupied with that which is true and\n  enduring, and to resist the allure of that which is illusory and\n  ephemeral, thereby becoming worthy of eternal life. Hence, the\n  phenomenology of holiness described by Rashi and Ramban. Involvement\n  with sexual immorality and even the indulgence of lust signify the\n  ultimate preoccupation with that which is transient and ephemeral, the\n  very antithesis of holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>source: <a href=\"http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2002/parsha/rtwe_kedoshim.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torahweb.org/torah/2002/parsha/rtwe_kedoshim.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This question is interesting because the Gemara begins with this issue \"אלהיהם של אלו שונא זימה הוא\". But if we read each word of the text we find that the main issue is Idolatry. I will quote a Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Gemara (Sanhedrin 106a) quote a verse in Hosea (9, 10):\n  הֵמָּה בָּאוּ בַעַל-פְּעוֹר, וַיִּנָּזְרוּ לַבֹּשֶׁת, וַיִּהְיוּ שִׁקּוּצִים, כְּאָהֳבָם.‏<br>\n  but so soon as they came to Baal-peor, they separated themselves unto the shameful thing, and became detestable like that which they loved. \n  {Be careful to the words, \"love\" is the word}<br>\n  <em>Rashi in Gemara</em>:\n  <br>\n  כאהבם. מתוך תאות אהבתם לזנות היו משוקצים שכופרין בהקב''ה:‏<br>\n  This was in consequence of their love of \"love\", they are becoming disgusting because they disavowed G_d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, the power of love is the cause of the hate of sexual immorality. Because love knows no laws, it is very harmful. Truth does not go hand in hand with an uncontrollable behavior.</p>\n\n<h3>Here is a Quotation of the Gemara cited in the OP. Sanhedrin 106a from Talmud Bavli</h3>\n\n<blockquote>   But he should have said, What thy people shall do to this people - R`Abba B`Kahana said: It is as one who, cursing himself, refers his malediction to others. \n\nHe [Balaam] said thus to him [Balak].'\n\n<b>The God of these hates lewdness</b>, and they are very partial to linen {allusion to beautiful clothes, link between coquetry and arayot}. \n\nCome, and I will advise thee.\n\nErect for them tents enclosed by hangings, in which place harlots, old women without, young women within, to sell them linen garments.'\n\nSo he erected curtained tents from the snowy mountain [Hermon] as far as Beth ha-Yeshimoth [i.e., right from north to south], and placed harlots in them - old women without, young women within.\n\nAnd when an Israelite ate, drank, and was merry, and issued forth for a stroll in the market place, the old woman would say to him, 'Dost thou not desire linen garments? ' The old woman offered it at its current value, but the young one for less.\n\nThis happened two or three times.\n\nAfter that she would say to him, 'Thou art now <b>like one of the family</b> {friendship, proximity, familiarity}; sit down and choose for thyself.'\n\nGourds of Ammonite wine lay near her, and at that time Ammonite and heathen wine had not yet been forbidden.\n\nSaid she to him, 'Wouldst thou like to drink a glass of wine? ' Having drunk, [his passion] was inflamed, and he exclaimed to her, 'Yield to me!' Thereupon she brought forth an idol from her bosom and said to him, 'Worship this'! 'But I am a Jew', he protested.'\n\nWhat does that concern thee? ' she rejoined, 'nothing is required but that thou should uncover thyself' - whilst he did not know that such was its worship.'\n\nNay', [said she,] 'I will not leave thee ere thou hast denied the Torah of Moses thy teacher,' as it is written, They went into Baal-peor, and separated themselves unto that shame, and their abominations were according as <b>they loved</b>. \n </blockquote>\n\n<p>The general prohibition to be in relation with non-Jewish women is linked on verses with Avoda Zara, the problem is the last consequence. See Rambam in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=5&rtype=%u05D8%u05E2%u05E7%u05E1%u05D8%20-%20%u05E4%u05E8%u05D9%u05D9%u05D3%u05D1%u05E8%u05D2&hilchos=27&perek=12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isure Bia</a>. You can see also that the problem with non-Jewish women Min hatora are linked to marriage, not to sexual relations.</p>\n\n<h3>G_d hate sexual immorality (<i>of the kind of this mentioned in OP</i>) because it leads to Idolatry</h3>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Ramban (Vayikra 18:6) comments that while the Rambam and Ibn Ezra tried to give a reason that in order to minimize sexual promiscuity the Torah forbade sexual relationships with those women one is regularly with (sibling, parent, child), he himself does not accept that reason. He suggests there may be \"secret\" reasons, though he doesn't have any tradition for one, and suggests that all the relationships which were forbidden are either of the type that can't produce children or won't establish successful marriages. But he concludes that it is a Decree of the King which we don't really know the reason for.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud then discusses others who have no peace. This section mentions someone who chooses to leave one source of learning and jump to another (and it seems, does so still expecting the same results from the learning even though the source material is different). </p>\n\n<p>So one who is steeped in learning law who jumps to the text, itself, will never have peace in terms of his understanding because one cannot simply figure the law out by reading the text. Similarly, if one is reading the gemara which explicates the mishna, then he jumps to the mishna, he will not achieve the same level of understanding because he now lacks the explanation of the gemara which he can't intuit on his own.</p>\n\n<p>This would not preclude someone's choice to learn the written text, but would caution one who is working towards deriving practical law against changing modes midstream and expecting to be able to reach the same end point. This is shown to be the case immediately later on the page where the Mishna says, regarding the laws of Sabbath, the Chagigah offering and of misuse of holy items, \"these are like mountains hanging from a hair, for they have very few verses and many detailed laws.\" With just the text, one cannot understand the many laws so one can never find peace in his practice.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/chagigah/points/cg-ps-010.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">dafyomi</a> page explains it as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Rav): \"To the one who leaves and the one who comes, there is no\n  peace\" (Zecharyah 8:10) -- this refers to one who leaves Halachic\n  discourse and goes to [learn] Scriptures, who has no more peace (for\n  no Halachic ruling can be derived from the Scriptures alone).\n  (b)   (Shmuel): This refers to one who leaves Talmud in order to learn\n  Mishnah (for no Halachic ruling can be derived from the Mishnah\n  alone). (c)   (R. Yochanan): This refers to one who even leaves the\n  Talmud Yerushalmi to learn Talmud Bavli (which is much more\n  difficult).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The original test was only supposed to be תוֹרֹתָֽי.</p>\n\n<p>I'm not asking for the general difference in meaning with these two words, but specifically, regarding the story of Manna:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>What were the מצות and what were the תורות that G-d is referring to?</li>\n<li>If the test was only for the תורות , why was G-d complaining that they didn't observe the מצות as well?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My brother in law suggested that the original test in verse 4 was only whether or not the Jews will follow the rules of the <em>Mann</em> (הילך בתורתי אם לא). However, after they failed the test, it was found that they had not only failed to keep the rules of the <em>Mann</em> (תורתי), but they had also disrespected Shabbos (מצותי).<br>\nThis answer feels right, especially after reading closely the context in which both verses are found.</p>\n\n<p>However, this answer is not compatible with <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9877#showrashi=true&v=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's explanation on the earlier verse</a>, which includes the prohibition to collect <em>Mann</em> on Shabbos as part of the \"תורה\" of the <em>Mann</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(What follows is my original answer to the question, which does not answer both questions.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I found an answer for your first question (\"What were the מצות and what were the תורות that G-d is referring to?\"), but not the second (\"If the test was only for the תורות , why was G-d complaining that they didn't observe the מצות as well?\").</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch writes (on verse 28) that the essence of the sin here was pursuing livelihood on Shabbos, against God's will, demonstrating the lack of belief and trust that God will provide. Shabbos is a special phenomenon, something that is both a מצוה (something that requires physical action/refraining from action) and a תורה (something that requires one to impress something in one's mind and feelings).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He who seeks his livelihood on Sabbath against God's Will denies that\n  his food is sent from God at all. [...] The Jew who seeks his\n  livelihood on Sabbath, completely turns his back to God, and to\n  following His Will, places himself on his own, and tears up the bond\n  with all His teachings. Hence the words עד אנה מאנתם לשמר מצותי ותורתי,\n  for with חלול שבת is expressed the denial to pay any attention at all\n  to the commands and teachings of God. Sabbath is especially both a\n  מצוה and a תורה as are all symbolic commands.

    "title": "What gives rabbis permission to alter the reading of a Biblical verse?",
    "content": "# What gives rabbis permission to alter the reading of a Biblical verse?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are several places in the Talmud, where rabbis alter the reading of a Biblical verse to teach something. an example of this is:</p>\n\n<p>Berakhot 64a (Sefaria):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי אלעזר אמר רבי חנינא תלמידי חכמים מרבים שלום בעולם שנאמר\n  (ישעיהו נד, יג) וכל בניך למודי ה' ורב שלום בניך אל תקרי בניך אלא בוניך</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Hannina:  The disciples of the wise\n  increase peace in the world; as it is said, \"And all thy children\n  shall be taught of the Lord ; and great shall be the peace of thy\n  children\" (Is. liv. 13). Read not banayik \"thy children\" but bonayik - thy \n  builders</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Granted that the verse, above, is from Isaiah and not the Torah. However, I believe that the changing of pronunciation is used in verses from the Torah, as well. (Can't locate the example at the moment.)</p>\n\n<p>Aren't the words and pronunciation Masoretic and the correct pronunciation should not be changed? I understand that in Hebrew, the vowels are not written, so the concept that the rabbis are using is within the freedom that since there are no vowels, it \"could\" be pronounced in some other way.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, how do the rabbis have the permission to alter the pronunciation since that was not what was originally meant? Also, what prevents any rabbi, currently, or even a wise student to alter the pronunciation of any word from anywhere in the Bible just to accommodate his idea or teaching? Is there some leniency in using this technique with other sections of Tanac\"h outside of the Torah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Let's first clarify that the literary device \"Read not...\" is an attempt to discover the layers of meaning in the word; it is not intended to invalidate in any way the accepted pronunciation. </p>\n\n<p>I quote Artscroll Siddur, Interlinear Shabbos Edition, page 427:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The intention is not to change the accepted reading of Scripture. Whenever such a statement appears in Rabbinical literature it means that the verse contains an allusion in addition to its literal meaning <em>as if</em> it were pronounced differently.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The explanation for this depends on the answer to a further question.\nIt is known that the Torah is written without vowels; vowels are actually a fairly recent innovation. So why was the Torah given without vowels? Doesn't that leave the words open to interpretation? </p>\n\n<p>In fact, that was exactly the point. The words of the Torah were written with layers and layers of meaning. The primary meaning indeed comes from the understanding of the words according to the Masoretic tradition. However, the Mesorah does not in and of itself invalidate all alternative approaches. Many layers of meaning can be discovered through D'rash, which probes the alternative meanings of texts through such devices as \"Read not\"s, Gezeirat Shavas (parallels between the same word in different locations), Kri UKtiv (words written one way and pronounced another), and similar devices. These devices are intended to help the learned unlock the layers of meaning within the Torah. (R' Moshe Eisemann, <em>Rashi's Thoughtful Students</em>)</p>\n\n<p>You asked another question. What protection is there in place to prevent the unscrupulous from misinterpreting a verse to suit their fancy?  Only the reliability of the expounder. We rely on the acceptance only of people with Yirat Shamayim, who won't falsify the Torah to suit their ends. The transmission of the oral Torah relies on the integrity and credibility of the Sages. That is really subject for a different question. But once someone is accepted as reliable, and he does nothing to infringe on that reliability (such as attempting a midrashic device beyond his abilities), he is followed.  If you would come up with your own \"Read not...\", you are unlikely to have your opinion accepted.</p>\n\n<p>In general, even the greatest modern scholars do not create their own \"Read not\"s, nor do they innovate using the other devices mentioned above. They generally believe that they are not on the level of scholarship neccesary to innovate new \"Read not\"s, and instead use alternate meanings of Parshanut, or build upon the Midrashic devices quoted in earlier sources. Again, if you or your local Orthodox Rabbi would innovate a new \"Read not\", many people would be suspicious of both you and your Drashah. </p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, I can sympathize with the various objections raised by my friends.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One question would be whether such an organ would be considered pig and thus forbidden to consume. (The title to your question perhaps suggests that this is the crux of the question, as it focuses on the transplant of the organ, not the creation of the organ. That being the case, I will focus on this question).</p>\n\n<p>Even if it were, the (near) universal rule in Judaism, is that every prohibition may be violated to save a life except for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-sacrifice_in_Jewish_law#Three_exceptional_sins\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">three cardinal sins</a>, which do not involve organ transplants from pigs. If the organ transplant was not vital for one's health, it would still not violate the prohibition of consuming pig because one is not eating it.</p>\n\n<p>The only question would be whether there is a prohibition against benefit from pig as distinct from a prohibition to eat it.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Sheviit (7:3) states that one is prohibited from engaging in commerce with certain prohibited foods. The Yerushalmi there clarifies that there is a prohibition to engage in commerce with any food that is Biblically forbidden.</p>\n\n<p>The question is therefore whether this represents a universal prohibition against benefit from forbidden foods, or an injunction against commerce in particular.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashba</a> (Responsa: 3:223) writes that there is no universal prohibition to benefit from pigs; only a rabbinic injunction against engaging in commerce with them.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם החזיר מותר בהנאה, במה שהתרת ליקח אותו בחובו? חדא: שהוא בעצמו אינו אסור בהנאה, דבר תורה, ואפילו לעשות בו סחורה, אלא מדבריהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>According to most authorities this limit on commerce is a rabbinic injunction. (Cf. Bartenura in Sheviit there, and Beit Yosef YD 117). They specify that this prohibition only applies when the commerce may lead to consumption of the food. (Cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbatai_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shach</a> YD 117:2). This would be another reason why the rabbinic injunction against commerce would not apply to a transplant; the transplant would not lead to consumption of pig.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, even in cases where there is no danger to life, there would be no prohibition on using pig organs.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The remaining problems you raise are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"scientists playing G-d\"</li>\n<li>The dangers in creating Frankenstein chimeras which may or may not break the Torah's prohibition on mixing seeds.</li>\n<li>Still others raised ethical issues around using human embryos for medical research of any kind.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The first two are not formal prohibitions and even if they were they would be overruled by considerations of saving a life.</p>\n\n<p>The last concern raised; use of embryo tissue for research is the only concern that could potentially override saving a life, as there is the possibility that certain cases of abortion constitute murder.</p>\n\n<p>See these questions related to abortion: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/15560/may-a-non-jew-have-an-abortion\">May a non-Jew have an abortion?</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/39015/is-a-jew-permitted-to-have-an-abortion\">Is a Jew permitted to have an abortion?</a>, and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9784/at-what-point-is-a-child-considered-living\">At what point is a child considered living</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>myJewishlearning <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ask-the-expert-kosher-pig/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">adresses the question</a> and states this is unequivocally permitted</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>There is no halakhic problem with pigskin and pig heart valves.</strong> Beyond that, there’s a very\n  important tenet of Judaism called pikuah nefesh, or, saving a life.\n  According to Jewish law, any of the mitzvot in the Torah (except\n  idolatry, murder, and forbidden sexual relationships) can and in fact\n  should be violated in order to save a person’s life; the pikuah nefesh\n  principle is that strong.

During those festivals the people were required to be in a heightened state of purity, so they had to avoid touching something like the flesh of a pig. Even on the way to Jerusalem, Jews were only prohibited from touching the flesh, that is, the meat of a pig.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi considers the context to discern that it is being unclean while eating the peace offering that would cause one to be cut off from their people.  This, however, does not change the fact that the result of touching an unclean animal is that one becomes unclean.  </p>\n\n<p>This makes me wonder how organ transplants from unclean animals will affect people going up to Jerusalem when the temple is rebuilt.  Will they die?</p>\n\n<p>One comment points out that touching a dead body also renders one unclean so the same questions might be asked in regard to transplants from human cadavers.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question is relevant to understand that<b> each of negative mitsvot has a spectrum and is not an idea only</b>.

We\nwill say: The prophets and the chasidim already\ninvestigated this matter. One of them said \"[Righteous are you, O\nL-rd, when I plead with You: yet let me talk with You of your\njudgments:] Why does the way of the wicked prosper? why are all they\nhappy that deal very treacherously?\" (Yirmiyahu 12:1), and another\n\"Why do You show me iniquity and look upon mischief; and plunder and\nviolence are before me; and the one who bears quarrel and strife\nendures.\" (Chavakuk 1:3), and \"for a wicked man surrounds the\nrighteous; therefore, justice emerges perverted.\" (Chavakuk 1:4), and\n\"Why should You be silent when a wicked man swallows up one more\nrighteous than he?\" (Chavakuk 1:13), and another one said \"Behold\nthese are wicked, yet they are tranquil in the world and have\nincreased wealth.\" (Tehilim 73:12), and \"But for naught I cleansed my\nheart and bathed my hands with cleanliness\" (Tehilim 73:13), and\nanother said \"And now we praise the bold transgressors, those who work\nwickedness are built up, they tempt G-d, and they have, nevertheless,\nescaped.\" (Malachi 3:15), and many more like this.</p>\n<p>But the prophet refrained from giving an answer because each specific\ncase has its own particular reason .

Job, who was silent and neither advised nor protested, was punished by suffering, as detailed in the eponymous book in the Bible. Yitro, who ran away as a sign of protest, merited that some of his children’s children sat in the Sanhedrin in the Chamber of Hewn Stone, as it is stated: “And the families of scribes who dwelt at Jabez, Tirathites, Shimeathites, and Sucathites, these were the Kenites who descended from Hammath, the father of the house of Rechab” (I Chronicles 2:55). And it is written: “The children of the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law” (Judges 1:16). This teaches that the Kenites, descendants of Yitro, the father-in-law of Moses, dwelt at Jabez [Yabetz], referring to the place where the Jewish people go for advice [eitza], i.e., the Chamber of Hewn Stone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>What these commentators seem to overlook or address is what we find in the opening of Job: This good man's misery is instigated entirely from a bet, if you will, between G-d and the Accuser (Satan). Were there verses that communicated HaShem's intention to use Job as an important lesson for others that we must all bear the miseries of life with continued faith despite those miseries, or some such lesson, I could be more satisfied. Instead the book tells us that HaShem entered into this wager simply to satisfy the Accuser's accusation. HaShem's treatment of Job reminds me of a passage in Shakespeare's KING LEAR: \"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods: They kill us for their sport.\"</p>\n\n\n",

If the teacher is like an angel of Hashem of Legions, they should ask instruction from his mouth; And if not, they should not ask instruction from his mouth.'</strong>\" Reish Lakish said, \"Rabbi Meir found a verse and expounded it: 'Incline your ear and hear the words of the wise ones; and put your heart to my knowledge (Proverbs 22:17).' 'To their knowledge' was not said, but rather 'to my knowledge'.\" Rav Chanina said from here: \"Listen, daughter, and see, and incline your ear and forget your nation and your father's house...

This one (ie. when there is no need for a teacher like an angel) is with an adult, <strong>and this one (ie. when there is a need for a teacher like an angel) is with a child.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From my personal experience, I know that, while the teachers at my school were very good, only one or two of them seemed to be without imperfections-- and they probably, somewhere along the line, where not perfectly Malach-like.</p>\n<p>What is the heter for our chinuch institutions to hire people who aren't of angelic perfection to teach Torah to minors?

None are saying unfounded chidushim for which they would need to be like angels. They are rather teaching the simple truths for which even a non angelic Rebbi would suffice.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>To a certain extent you are right as how can a Rebbi, a 'lowly' human being be on a level of a more heavenly-based מלאך? Surely it is impossible for a man that is essentially ‘earthly’ in form, to draw parallels with a celestially-rooted מלאך?</strong></p>\n\n<p>The answer is that just as a מלאך has no personal aspirations but rather is driven purely to satisfy the will of Hashem, so too a Rebbi must be focused entirely on fuelling the success of his תלמידים. (See HaRav Michel Yehuda Lefkowitz זצ\"ל in קונטרוס יסודות החינוך מרבותינו גדולי ישראל שליט\"א: דברים שנאמרו בכינוס מאות מחנכים ומנהלים רוחניים, כסלו תשע\"א, 'הרב הדומה למלאך שכל כוונתו תועלת התלמיד', עמוד 5)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, a Rebbi must be consistent with his appointed title. This means that he must not be deficient in the traits necessary for a מחנך. If a teacher is lacking in his level of observance, character or learning it will serve to hamper his personal example. Failure to be a true role model will abjectly impact on his students. (Refer to משנה תורה, הלכות תלמוד תורה ב:ג. The רמב\"ם writes there; \"לפיכך אין ראוי להושיב מלמד אלא 'בעל יראה' וכו'\" – “Therefore, it is not fitting to appoint a teacher unless he is a G-d fearing person”.)</p>\n\n<p>The fact that we liken our Rebbeim to angels is a testament to the high regard with which we view them. They serve to mould and fashion our children into 'עובדי ה, and for this alone, we must endeavour to ensure that our children receive the correct level of teaching. Indeed, Rabbi Moshe Shternbach שליט\"א notes that one must be quick to ascertain that their children have a רבי who is a ירא שמים and this means seeing him with your own eyes to verify if he will provide a good example. (See ספר אורחות הבית, חלק ראשון, פרק ששה עשר, אות ז', עמוד קכב. He writes, \"והיו עיניך רואות את מוריך היאך הוא מתנהג באורחות חייו וכשהוא מתפלל שיהא לדוגמא ומופת לתלמידיו\" – “And your eyes themselves should see your teacher, how he acts in his daily life and when he davens he should be an example and source of wonder to his students”. In a similar vein, the חפץ חיים adds: \"מאד מאד יתחזק האדם לראות שבנו ישיג חינוך טהור בידיעת התורה והמצות וכמו שנהגו אבותינו מלפנים בדרך החינוך ללמד את בניהם חומש ורש\"י שיהיו עי\"ז יהודי נאמן לד' ותורתו\" – “It is highly important for a person to see that his child receive a pure chinuch with Torah knowledge and Mitzvos, and like our fathers before them were accustomed in the ways of chinuch to teach their children Chumash and Rashi, and through this, a Jew will believe in Hashem and His Torah”. As written in בית ישראל, מאמר לכלל ישראל)</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, in order for a teacher to positively influence others, it is an obligation on them to first fill themselves with יראת ה' and only then can they influence others. (ומצדיקי רבים, פרק א', 'ירא שמים',עמוד ג)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yaakov Neiman זצ\"ל in his דרכי מוסר also explains how important it is for a teacher to be a ירא שמים. When an educator has this מדה his influence is all the more impactful on his תלמידים. For example, when a teacher relates the miraculous experiences of יציאת מצרים, and his absolute 'אמונת ה is evident, it enters into the heart of his students and leaves a lasting impression. (See 'דרכי מוסר, פרשת יתרו, 'והגדת לבנך. He begins by asking why it was that יתרו was so excited by משה’s report of the miracles that had occurred in the build up to and during יציאת מצרים, when he had already heard the same account prior? R’ Neiman answers,אינו דומה שומע מפי הרב לשומע מפי התלמיד תלוי מי המשמיע – “One cannot compare hearing something from the mouth of a Rov to hearing it from the mouth of the student, as it is dependent on the speaker.” This means that it was only when יתרו heard the miraculous happenings of מצרים from משה that it left a lasting impression.)</p>\n\n<p>Conversely, when a teacher says something that lacks conviction, his students will see this lackadaisical approach and will not absorb the message. For this reason, R’ Neiman writes elsewhere that it is crucial that a Rebbi teaches with a mindset that is completely לשמה (See 'דרכי מוסר, פרשת תרומה, 'אחריות של המורה והמחנך). It is only when an act is performed לשמה that Hashem can allow His שכינה to settle. This is because when a person is of pure heart and mind; his resulting actions truly reflect his intentions. This purity consequently provides a foothold for the Divine presence to cling to. This means that teachers have a tremendous responsibility as when they avoid acting in a לשמה manner their students may not learn properly. This in turn, can result in disinterested students which can ח\"ו leave them open to foreign and evil influence. </p>\n\n<p>In both cases R’ Neiman brings the story of אלישה בן אבויה, the point you raised in the first part of your question who became known as אחר, a once leading Torah sage, who became an apostate and is since referred to as \"אחר\" (literally; “the other one”). Quoting תוספות on מסכת חגיגה ט\"ו in the name of the ירושלמי, R’ Neiman relates how אחר believed himself to be doomed to failure from the outset. תוספות comments that אבויה was one of the great men of ירושלים, and on the day of his son’s ברית he invited all the distinguished men of the city to sit in one room and ר' אליעזר and ר' יהושע to sit separately in another room. After the dignitaries had eaten and drunk, they sang songs and did alphabetical acrostics. Seeing that the men were engaging in interests of theirs, ר' אליעזר and ר' יהושע felt that such action justified them occupying themselves with their own interest, namely, תורה study. They started with תורה, moving on to נביאים and then כתובים. Such was their enjoyment that fire descended from heaven and surrounded them. Upon seeing this phenomenon, אחר’s father remarked that due to the evident might of תורה, if his child would survive, he would dedicate his child to תורה. Thus אחר concludes, since his father’s intention was not לשמה the study of תורה did not endure for him. We learn from this story how important it is to have correct and heartfelt intentions. As seen by the case of אחר, failure to act in way that is לשמה can have catastrophic results.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thus in short, the imagery of teachers as angels is not alluding to be something that they cannot be, but rather symbolic of an aspiration to provide an example that serves to inspire those under their charge. They should be יראי שמים and בני עליה which in turn, will no doubt serve to inspire their תלמידים and make them positive role models.</strong> </p>\n\n\n",

As an example <a href=\"http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/trial.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Trial of Jesus</a> points out that the three versions given contradict each other so that at least two are false. <a href=\"http://www.rejectionofpascalswager.net/sanhedrin.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Trial Before the Sanhedrin</a> shows how none of the accounts given could have been true.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Error #1: The Sanhedrin convened at the high priest's house Mark\n  mentioned that the Sanhedrin met in the house of the high priest while\n  all our other sources on the Sanhedrin tells us that the council does\n  not convene anywhere else except in the Chamber of the Hewn Stone in\n  the Temple. [5]</p>\n  \n  <p>Error #2: The Sanhedrin met at night The Sanhedrin was said to have\n  conveyened immediately after Jesus was arrested and taken to the high\n  priest's house. This was after the Passover supper and the prayer at\n  Gethsemane which makes the council meet around 9 to 10pm at night.\n  This is again incompatible with what we know of the procedures of the\n  Sanhedrin which disallows nocturnal meetings. [6]</p>\n  \n  <p>Error #3:The Sanhedrin conveyed on the passover To add to the\n  absurdity, this night, if we are to believe the synoptic chronology,\n  was passover eve and by Jewish reckoning already the 15th of Nisan,\n  passover itself. As many eminent Jewish scholars have pointed out,\n  this is simply inconceivable, given the strict ruling of no council\n  meetings on the Sabbath, and on religious feast days, such as the\n  passover. [7] We quote the Jewish scholar, Joseph Klausner from his\n  book Jesus of Nazareth (New York 1925):</p>\n  \n  <p>the Sadducees themselves would not have conducted even a simple\n  judicial enquiry either on the night of the passover or the first day\n  of the passover...the mishnah lays it down that capital cases may not\n  be judged on the eve of a Sabbath or on the eve of a festival to avoid\n  delay should the case not be finished that day, since all trials were\n  forbidden on a Sabbath or a festival. [8]     </p>\n  \n  <p>Error #4: The Sanhedrin pronounced the death sentence immediately\n  Another procedural impossibility is given in Mark 14:64 which includes\n  the sentence: they all condemned him as worthy of death. This means\n  that the sentence was passed on the same day instead of the prescribed\n  interval of twenty four hours. [9] These procedural flaws in the\n  Markan account weighs heavily against any claims of historicity for\n  the episode described there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Additionally, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In short almost every point in the Markan account of the nocturnal\n  trial of Jesus is incompatible with what we know of the Jewish\n  council. In short Mark's account is fiction; and poor fiction at that!</p>\n  \n  <p>In Luke's account, the nocturnal trial in Mark was omitted but Luke's\n  story of the trial in the morning is still subject to the same\n  objection as against Mark's, for the trial was conducted on passover\n  day itself, something we have seen as impossible. Luke's story of the\n  trial before the Sanhedrin is as unhistorical as Mark's.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It could have just said something like  \"כָּל הַנֹּגֵעַ בְּמֵת\" - \"whoever touches a dead body\" or \"כָּל הַנֹּגֵעַ בְּאָדָם מֵת\" - whoever touches a dead human.\" R' Hirsch explains that the Torah's describing something much bigger here. \"הָאָדָם,\" rather than just plain \"אָדָם,\" is mankind. \"הָאָדָם אֲשֶׁר יָמוּת\" is \"mankind which is mortal.\" The נֶפֶש of that is \"the soul of mortal Man\" - the idea that every living human has death hanging over him, which he'll ultimately have no choice but to submit to. Finally, \"[all that]כָּל הַנֹּגֵעַ בְּמֵת בְּ\" says \"one who touches, <em>via a dead body</em> [that great big depressing concept]\" (my phrasing, this time).</p>\n<p>So, the נֶפֶשׁ, depending on the context, can be the life-force or individuality of a person, or it can be the soul of all humanity, perceived as inexorably doomed. Contact with a dead body can radically alter one's perspective. For more on how such a perspective shift (\"impurity\") can be a big problem, and how the red heifer process helps, according to R' Hirsch, see the rest of his commentary on the beginning of <em>Chukat</em>, which is very briefly summarized in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/57514/2\">this answer</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

The 49th day is used to perform a general overview of all 48 items in order to ensure that they were ready to receive the torah on Shavuos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>48 WAYS IN THE OMER</strong> One of the reasons given for the happiness\nassociated with Lag B'Omer is that on this day, the students of Rebbi\nAkiva, who had died en masse every day since Pesach, stopped dying. As\nthere are no coincidences in Judaism, why did they specifically stop\ndying at this time? The 7 weeks between Pesach and Shavuos represents\na period in which we prepare ourselves to celebrate the giving of the\nTorah at Mount Sinai on Shavuos. The leaders of the Mussar movement\npoint out that the Mishnah (Avos 6:6) teaches that there 48 traits by\nwhich the Torah is acquired. Since there are 49 days during which we\nprepare to reaccept the Torah, they maintained that it would be\nappropriate to use this time to develop within ourselves the qualities\nand attributes which are necessary to accept and acquire the Torah on\nShavuos. Therefore, on each day of this period, they worked on\nunderstanding and instilling within themselves one of these qualities.\nSince there were only 48 traits, they used the last day for a general\noverview of all of them. In his work Lekach Tov, Rabbi Yaakov Yisrael\nBaifus suggests that if the founders of the Mussar movement engaged in\nthis commendable practice, certainly the lofty Sages of the Talmud did\nso as well. The 32nd trait by which the Torah is acquired is ohev et\nhabriot - \"love of one's fellow man.\" The Talmud teaches (Yevamos 62b)\nthat the reason for the death of Rebbi Akiva's disciples was that they\ndidn't feel and display appropriate respect toward one another. Rabbi\nBaifus suggests that once they had worked on the trait of loving one\nanother on the 32nd day, they rectified the cause of this tragedy, and\nindeed on the following day the students stopped dying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

One statement is that they started setting it up on Rosh Chodesh Nisan and יום השמיני was on the eighth day of Nisan. This meant that they would not have become tahor until after sunset and it would have been too late to be part of the korbon Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>Others would say that the deaths were on the first of Nisan and one possibility is that the Parah Adumah was not yet ready and that caused the purification to be delayed.</p>\n\n<p>A possibility for Rabbi Yosi Haglili is that they had to continue attending the coffin of Yosef while the mikdash was being set up and taken down (similar to the first answer) or that they might not have finished arranging for the Parah Adumah (as with the second possibility).</p>\n\n<p>In either case, we see that there is an answer for both Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Yosi Haglili.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Although some commentators (most notably Malbim) suggest that Rabbi Akiva necessarily holds that  Nadav and Avihu died on 8 Nisan, there is no indication  that he disagrees with the generally accepted view in Chazal that their deaths occurred on 1 Nisan.  As to why Mishael and Elzaphan would still be Tamei Meis on 14 Nisan, a possible answer is that they buried Nadav and Avihu far away from the vicinity of Har Sinai and it took them several days (more than a week) to return to the camp.  This answer is given by one of the commentators on Masseches Sukkah found in Otzar Mefarshei HaTalmud page 831, but unfortunately I don't recall his name and don't have the sefer before me.  Unlike others (Miriam, Aharon and Moshe), the Torah does not tell us exactly where Nadav and Avihu were buried; it simply says that Mishael and Elzaphan took them \"Michutz LaMachane.\" That indefinite phrase could even mean Har HaZeisim outside of Yerushalayim, the place where Tzadikkim throughout the generations were buried--Yerushalyim corresponded to Machane Yisrael in the Midbar, and thus fits the term \"Michutz LaMachne.\" Moreover, Chazal call Har HaZeisim \"Har HaMishcha,\" and Nadav and Avihu are called HaKohanim HaMeshuchim in B'Midbar 3:3.  (The next verse refers to their deaths.)            </p>\n\n<p>There is no necessary contradiction between the views of R' Yossi HaGlili and R' Akiva--Mishael and Elzaphan could have been the men who dealt with the bones of Yosef--Mizvah Goreres Mitzvah. (In fact, they could also have been the men who found the Meis Mitzvah.)  R' Yossi focuses on the fact that the original tumah from which they were never purified involved the bones of Yosef, while R' Akiva focuses on the cause of their inability to be tahor on 14 Nisan--the burials of Nadav and Avihu.           </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Poor man donating 999 vs rich man donating 1000?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have the following dilemma with my father in law.\nI'm stating that assuming that both men have given their 10% if a rich man gives $1000 he makes a bigger mitzva than if a poor man gives $999. My take is that Judaism is about actions and general world improvement more than intentions. So that extra $1 makes another child eat then the rich man made the world better than the poor man even with the extra effort that he endured.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any direct reference in texts about bigger mitzvot being accounted on results instead of intentions?</p>\n\n<p>Do the texts specifically say what would be the bigger mitzva? To elaborate further, which action is better looked in the eyes of Hashem (Which action has the bigger reward)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On the contrary, intentions are what matter. A poor person doing everything he can is treated just the same by God as a rich person doing everything he can.</p>\n\n<p>We can learn this from the classic statement אחד המרבה ואחד הממעית - ובלבד שיכוון ליבו לשמים (Whether one gives a lot or a little, the important thing is his intent). The source is about size of the sacrifice (<a href=\"http://daf-yomi.com/Dafyomi_Page.aspx?id=4607\" rel=\"nofollow\">Menachot 110a</a>) but certainly applies to tzedaka as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>On the contrary, the <a href=\"http://chabad.org/1178792\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">penultimate Mishnah in Chapter 5 of Pirqe'i Avot</a> states (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בן הא הא אומר, לפום צערא אגרא</p>\n<p>Ben He He says, 'According to the pain is the reward'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since each marginal dollar from the poor man is a higher percentage of his income, he receives greater reward for nevertheless choosing to give to others beyond the letter of the law.</p>\n<p>It should simultaneously be made clear, however, that despite the nearly unparalleled importance of ẓedaqah (charity), this miẓwah should not come at the expense of one's other obligations (i.e. one should not make oneself poor by giving away all of one's money). See <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1574\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the proper balance one must practice in honoring the Shabbat</a> for a similar concept.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Neither would be a \"bigger mitzvah\" as you are calling it. One would be a mitzvah and that would be the rich man who gives $1000 and the poor man who gives away such a llarge amount of money would be taking away needed money from his family. There is a limit on how much of one's earnings one is permitted to give away especially if doing so will end up having a harmful impact on one's family which is more likely to happen to a poor person gave away such a sum of money. I don't recall the exact gemarrah that discusses this but did a quick google search and found this article which discusses this point...\n<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1126600/jewish/Is-There-Such-A-Thing-As-Too-Much-Charity.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1126600/jewish/Is-There-Such-A-Thing-As-Too-Much-Charity.htm</a> </p>\n\n\n",

They were simply uninvolved with the atrocity. Which would mean your other option that this is simply a lesson for life is correct.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinuch right afterwards also seems to say this quite clearly. </p>\n\n<p>והודיענו הכתוב מזה גודל מעלת גמילות חסדים והרחקת מדת הנבלה והכילות ועל כן צונו לקבוע שנאה עמהם שהשחיתו והתעיבו להראות תכלית רשעם ונבלותם שלא להקדים אפילו בלחם ובמים קהל גדול עייפי הדרך העוברים בגבולם ואשר שכרו עליהם מואב את בלעם לקללם. ואף על פי שמצריים שעבדו בנו וצערונו זמן רב לא נתרחקנו מהם כי אם עד דור שלישי וידענו בזה שיפה לו לאדם לעשות כמה חטאים ולא נבלה אחת גדולה כי בהסכמתו בעשיית הנבלה המכוערת ולא יחוש לגלות דעתו ובושתו נגד עמים רבים מראה בזה רוע מזגו ותכלית פחיתותו וכי אין בו עוד תקנה להכשיר עצמו ולהטיב מעשהו ונתחזק עוותו עד שלא יוכל לתקון ואיש כמוהו איננו ראוי להתערב בעם הקודש המבורך.</p>\n\n<p>This lesson from the Moabites is giving us an insight into individuals and judgement of personality for all eternity. If someone enslaved you or hires a hitman to take care of you, there is hope that he can be a decent person. If he brazenly ignored you in your desperate time of need, there is no hope for him. </p>\n\n\n",

While some people say that Chagai means to hint about the temple to be built by the mashiach, most say that this refers to the second temple which was about to be built (since Chagai, Zechariah, and Malachi were part of the Anshe Knesses Hagedolah) and that before it would be destroyed, this is what it would become. </p>\n\n<p>Note that Rashi comments on the phrase \"will be greater\". That is Rashi says that Rav holds that the actual temple itself (after Herod rebuilt it) was \"more magnificent\" than the first temple. Shmuel holds that the \"greater glory\" was that it lasted longer. Both speak of it even though it did not have the same spiritual glory as the first temple.</p>\n\n<p>The fame of the temple spread throughout the Roman Empire which could also mean that the glory \"was greater\" in that it was a major attraction over much of the known world. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16204/jewish/Chapter-2.htm#v=9&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chagai 2:9</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ט גָּדוֹל יִהְיֶה כְּבוֹד הַבַּיִת הַזֶּה הָאַחֲרוֹן מִן הָרִאשׁוֹן\n  אָמַר יְהֹוָה צְבָאוֹת וּבַמָּקוֹם הַזֶּה אֶתֵּן שָׁלוֹם נְאֻם יְהֹוָה\n  צְבָאוֹת:</p>\n  \n  <p>9 The glory of this last House shall be greater than the first one,\n  said the Lord of Hosts.

Thus, as the Roman generals sat surveying Jerusalem and\n  considering the Temple’s future they hesitated before ordering its\n  destruction. Jews, from that day to this, have yearned and prayed for\n  its rebuilding, and tourists and religious people alike have come to\n  behold the site on which it once stood. </p>\n  \n  <p>Normally a city of 100 to 200 thousand people, three times a year on\n  the pilgrim festivals of Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles,\n  Jerusalem’s population swelled to 1 million souls (the exact number\n  depending on the source of population estimates). On these occasions\n  this small ancient city had to cope not only with the throng of people\n  but also their sacrificial animals and offerings, necessitating\n  temporary increases in food supplies, accommodation, ritual bathing\n  facilities, and all aspects of commerce. It was Herod, installed by\n  the Romans as governor of Jerusalem, who faced these logistical\n  problems, and who consequently set about renovating the city and the\n  Temple to accommodate this massive periodic influx.</p>\n  \n  <p>Before work began on the Temple, Herod spent eight years stockpiling\n  materials for its construction. Then, a workforce of over 10,000 men\n  began its construction including a contingent of 1,500 specially\n  trained priests who were the only ones permitted to work on the\n  innermost and holiest parts of the Temple. Building continued for a\n  further twenty years, though the Temple was in a sufficiently ready\n  state within three and a half years of its commencement to be\n  dedicated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the first generation of pious Jews, who\n  before sitting down to pray the morning service would first meditate\n  for an hour in order to be able to bring full concentration and\n  intention to reciting the prayers words – and after the morning\n  service, would meditate for an hour in order to let the prayers fully\n  percolate into their hearts and souls. Two hours of contemplative\n  practice for every hour of liturgical prayer; wow.</p>\n  \n  <p>Much later in our history, the movement we now call Hasidism,\n  inherited those meditative practices along with the kabbalistic\n  aspiration of seeking devekut with G’d. A variety of contemplative\n  practices arose in Hasidic communities. One is hitbonenut\n  (contemplation), another hitbodedut (self-seclusion)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Hisbodedus means to seclude. One secludes himself psychologically. In the Breslov tradition this opens one up to an expieience of Hashem the purpose of davening is similar to a mantra to help ones focus and clearing of the mind. See R Aryeh Kaplan's book jewish meditation. </p>\n\n<p>Hisbonenus comes from binah, to understand. In the chabad teachings the order goes first one learns than one is hisboded (as per the Halacha that one must \"walk two doors into the shul before prayer) to remove all outside distractions. But this in of itself is just divesting oneself of the world, one must then be misbonen, to analytically think about Hashem am his relationship to the world. This allows one to daven with kavanah. \nKavanah is often translated as intent but it can also be used as awareness focus or passion depending on the context. So the basic requirement of kavanah in davening is to be aware that you are talking to Hashem (because he has thought about it he has come to a recognition of hashems presence) . By shema one intends to accept upon them self the yoke of heaven. And I one has thought about what one is saying to the point where it inspires him he can pray with passion. \n(So according to chabad all 3 are part of one system of prayer, not sure how others see it)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am condensing some ideas from a long <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_meditation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wikipedia</a> article on this topic.

The goal of hitbodedut is to establish a\nclose, personal relationship with God and a clearer understanding of\none's personal motives and goals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I didn't find anything in that article regarding \"kavanah\" that seems quite in depth. But the term \"kavanah\" means \"intent\". There is a general debate in Talmud brachot whether the performance of mitzvoth requires kavanah or not. The concept behind kavanah involves both the intent to pray and fulfill one's obligation, as well as the meaning of the words.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (I'll edit the place, later) mentions that while reciting Shema, one should have kavanat 'Ol Malchut Shamayim - the intent of accepting the yoke of the kingship of heaven.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Prayer does not necessarily mean standing in shul, if a person concentrates on a elevated concept (hisbonenus) the whole day they are in a state of prayer the whole day.</p>\n\n<p>Hisbodedus (seclusion) is also not necessarily associated with 'prayer', it means finding the inner stillness which is muffled by the madding crowd.</p>\n\n\n",

Did he consider the state a good thing or bad thing. </p>\n\n<p>I ask this because we have almost every Gadol's opinion on the topic, yet concerning Rav Moshe I am unaware of any document or work which quotes his opinion. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Interesting question and it is true that artscroll's <a href=\"http://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422610848.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">biography</a> of R Moshe Feinstein doesn't address the question explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few relevant statements showing R Moshe's position. From the statements below I perceive a \"positive-neutral attitude\", for sure  without any virulence against the State but also not proactively recommending alyah. One should remember however that R Feinstein passed away in 1986, more than 30 years ago, and hadn't seen the growth of religion (both religious Zionists and haredim) that occured since then in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>R Chaim Jachter <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/Must_Diaspora_Jews_Make_Aliyah_1.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">brings up</a> his position on alyah</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe Feinstein was asked whether one should move to Israel in\n  accordance with the view of the Ramban (to BeMidbar 33:53 and Mitzvah\n  4 of the positive Mitzvot omitted by the Rambam in his enumeration of\n  the 613 Mitzvot), who asserts that even in \"our days,\" every Jew is\n  required to live in Israel. On the other hand, perhaps one should one\n  follow the opinion of Rabbeinu Chaim Cohen (cited in Tosafot Ketubot\n  110b s.v. Hu Omeir and Mordechai Ketubot number 313) that the Mitzvah\n  to live in Israel does not apply today. The latter is of the opinion\n  that since the journey and subsequent life in Israel is fraught with\n  danger and since it is difficult to fulfill the Mitzvot HaTeluyot\n  BaAretz (commandments associated with the land of Israel), there\n  exists no Mitzvah to live in Israel “today” (in the thirteen century).</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Feinstein argues that even though most authorities agree with the\n  Ramban that one fulfills a Mitzvah by living in Israel today, there is\n  no obligation to move to Israel. Rav Feinstein feels that the Ramban\n  and those who agree with him believe that if one moves to Israel he\n  has fulfilled a Mitzvah (Mitzvah Kiyumit) but that there exists no\n  absolute obligation to do so (Mitzvah Chiyuvit). Rav Moshe concludes\n  that since no one rules that there is an absolute obligation of\n  Aliyah, Rabbeinu Chaim Cohen's opinion should certainly be considered\n  when contemplating moving to Israel.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Feinstein seeks to prove this\n  point from the fact that the Rambam (Hilchot Melachim 5:9) writes that\n  it is prohibited to leave Israel but does not state that one is\n  prohibited to reside outside Israel. If an obligation to move to\n  Israel exists, writes Rav Feinstein, then the Rambam would have\n  recorded a prohibition to live outside of Israel. Rav Feinstein\n  concludes that since there is no obligation to move to Israel even\n  according to the Ramban, one must certainly consider Rabbeinu Chaim\n  Cohen's concern that one will not fulfill the Mitzvot HaTeluyot\n  BaAretz properly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R Gil Student <a href=\"http://www.torahmusings.com/2005/05/religious-zionism-debate-v/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">brings up his position</a> on the prayer for the State of Israel</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Moshe Feinstein was asked about the prayer for the state of Israel.\n  He said that it should be modified to indicate a Hopeful Zionist view,\n  instead of a Messianic Zionist approach. The text, as he recommended,\n  is as follows: “Our Father in heaven, the rock of Israel and its\n  redeemer, bless the state of Israel that it become the beginning of\n  the sprouting of our Redemption (she-t’hei reishis tzemihas\n  ge’ulaseinu).”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=10970\" rel=\"noreferrer\">yeshiva.co</a> (and <a href=\"http://www.revach.net/halacha/tshuvos/Rav-Moshe-Feinstein-Israeli-Flag-In-A-Shul-Can-You-Daven-There/5070\" rel=\"noreferrer\">revach</a>) discuss his position on an Israeli flag inside a synagogue, found in Igrot Moshe OC 1:46</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For example, in one of the few halachic responsa which touch upon the\n  rabbinic evaluation of modern g'dolim regarding the State, Rav Moshe\n  Feinstein replies to a question regarding a shul where they wished to\n  place an Israeli flag (together with an American flag), next to the\n  Ark as follows: \"And even though those who made this flag and symbol\n  of the State of Israel were bad people (רשעים), in any case they did\n  not consider it (the flag, A.C.) to be a holy item, which if they had\n  done so, would have led to suspect that it is like idolatry... (but)\n  it is like every secular object... and if it was possible to dismiss\n  the entire matter of the flag without causing an argument, so there\n  will not be any memory of the actions of the bad people, this would be\n  the correct thing to do, but Heaven forbid causing an argument about\n  this\". Rav Moshe infers that the Israeli flag should not be flown,\n  even outside the shul!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also the interesting <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=10970#3b\" rel=\"noreferrer\">footnote 3</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This letter was written in the year 1957/5717, and it is possible that\n  with the changes in the State – a general improvement in Israeli\n  society regarding its view of Torah and mitzvot (compared with the\n  days of Ben-Gurion and his quest to forcibly create a \"new Jew\"), the\n  ba'al t'shuva movement, the entrance of even the charedi parties into\n  all of the recent governments - Rav Feinstein may have changed his\n  view on the State of Israel accordingly. So it seems from his response\n  to his grandson who enlisted in the Israeli army, which is published\n  in T'chumin 5, pp.11, and so it seems also from his response in Or.\n  Ch. 4, 70, 11, which was written in the year 1979/5739.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a topic that certainly merits further study.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Need to provide sources, but on one foot, I think the best way to describe his position was: \"a convenient distance.\" Zionism wasn't Rav Moshe's <em>raison d'etre</em>; neither was anti-Zionism. When you're thousands of miles away, that's a position you can afford to have.</p>\n\n<p>Just for perspective, consider the pragmatic view of his senior peer, R' Yosef Eliyahu Henkin. His grandson writes that prior to 1948, R' Henkin preferred that the holy land remain under British control, as the establishment of a Jewish state would lead to a war in which many Jews would die (as it did). Once the State of Israel was established, however, he vehemently opposed any efforts to delegitimize it (<strong>note: disagreeing with some of its actions is not the same as deligitimizing it</strong>), as that could lead to more wars and more spilling of blood. So it was common for rabbis of that period -- especially those who lived in America -- to be neither card-carrying \"Zionists\" nor \"anti-Zionists.\"</p>\n\n<p>Getting back to what we know about Rav Moshe:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>He was involved with Agudas Yisrael, which meant he treated the State as valid, even if not always agreeing with its decisions. (Versus something like Neturei Karta.)</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71615/11501\">As discussed by mbloch</a>, he felt that a synagogue sanctuary was not the place for <em>any</em> political flag, however he insisted that having a flag was not a reason to break away from a synagogue and start a minyan in your basement. He does use the word <em>ha-arura</em>, \"the blighted state\", in that responsum, to refer to the State of Israel. Rabbi Aaron Rakeffet claims that R' Feinstein came to regret that choice of word -- it could be that his views towards the State softened, or simply that he <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/70507/21\">saw an increasingly virulent anti-Zionism</a> and didn't want to be associated with it. </p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Rakeffet tells that in his time, the local <em>posek</em> for the <em>Bnai Akiva</em> movement was Rabbi Moshe Bick, who in turn would consult with Rabbi Feinstein. Asked about saying Hallel on Israeli independence day, Rav Moshe said: \"eh if you consider it a yomtov, fine say Hallel; personally I don't.\" </p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Feinstein's family writes (introduction to Igros Volume 8) that Rav Moshe didn't like the mixing of rabbinic authority and political power. This might be one reason why he kept a polite distance from the State of Israel (though again, not deligitimizing it).</p></li>\n<li><p>His family also writes that after returning to New York from his first and only (living) trip to Israel, he remarked that if he went back there he'd have to deal with all of the issues Jews had there; he felt that his job as <em>posek</em> was outside of Israel.</p></li>\n<li><p>He does address questions of educators in Israel's religious governmental education system feeding the children <em>heter mechira</em> produce. (I.e. a loophole for farming during the <em>shemita</em> year.) He doesn't go on a tirade against <em>heter mechira</em>, simply commenting <em>de-lo svira lan</em> -- \"which we find unconvincing.\" He does give practical advice to the educational institutions at which <em>heter mechira</em> is the only thing available. (No tirades or vilifications.

    "content": "# Why does Torah study rein in the Evil Inclination?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=30b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kidushin 30b</a> states that Torah study is essential activity for gaining control of the evil inclination.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"... so too the Holy One blessed be He said: 'I have created the evil\n  inclination and I have created the Torah as its tavlin (spice). If\n  you toil in the Torah, you will not be delivered in his hand. but if\n  you do not, you will be delivered in his hand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Mesilas Yesharim (ch.5) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the Creator, blessed be He, who created the evil inclination also\n  created the torah as its antidote as our sages of blessed memory have\n  stated: \"I have created the evil inclination, and I have created the\n  torah as its antidote\" (Kidushin 30b). Behold, it is obvious that if\n  the Creator created for this affliction only this remedy, then it is\n  impossible under any circumstances for a man to heal himself from this\n  affliction without employing this treatment. One who thinks to save\n  himself without Torah study is only mistaken, and will see his error\n  only in the end, when he dies in sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does this work? Is it due to aligning a person's mind with the torah way of thinking (i.e. the truth), or perhaps by reporting to him the reward and punishment incurred by others, or perhaps some other reason.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A very central question. I want to quote an other Gemara concerning dealing with evil inclination (Berachot 5a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א''ר לוי בר חמא אמר ר''ש בן לקיש לעולם ירגיז אדם יצר טוב על יצר הרע שנא' {תהילים ד-ה} רגזו ואל תחטאו. אם נצחו מוטב ואם לאו יעסוק בתורה שנאמר אמרו בלבבכם אם נצחו מוטב ואם לאו יקרא קריאת שמע שנאמר על משכבכם אם נצחו מוטב ואם לאו יזכור לו יום המיתה שנאמר ודומו סלה.‏</p>\n<p>Rabbi Levi Bar Hama says in the name of Rabbi Simeon Ben Lakish: A man should always incite the good impulse [in his soul] to fight against the evil impulse.\nFor it is written: Tremble and sin not. If he subdues it, well and good. If not, let him study the Torah. For it is written: 'Commune with your own heart'.\nIf he subdues it, well and good. If not, let him recite the Shema'. For it is written: 'Upon your bed'. If he subdues it, well and good. If not, let him remind himself of the day of death. For it is written: 'And be still, Selah'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see the last one of all this means is to remember a simple reallity. There is an opposition between imagination and awareness to real world. Torah with the Halachic corpus per example, help a man to be aware of his evil inclination and to enter into a dialogue with this inclination. The danger of evil inclination is that a man can identify it.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26824&st=&pgnum=7&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his famous letter</a> <strong>Rav Israel Salanter</strong> said that there is an other power that transcend the subject of the study itself.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He explains that to study about a specific Mitsva lead the student to be more compliant with the mitsva.</li>\n<li>But he adds that there is an additional property of the \"Torah spice\", which transcends the human intelligence, mentioned in Gemara Sotah 21a: \"As for [study of] Torah, whether while one is engaged upon it or not, it protects and rescues.\". Regardless of the topic, Torah occupation can saving the student from sin.E.g. If he will learning \"an ox has gored a cow\", it will be saved from lashon Hara (calumny). This is a consequence of the spirituality of Torah. I think that Rav Israel Salanter use a mystical language.</li>\n<li>In  the OP, reference is made to an habit to deal with truth. May be very near for the words of RIS, with an other language's constellation.</li>\n<li>So the direction to understand is that a man will be close to real world and to truth. Sin need preliminarily to take the man away from them.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Meiri there explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל ששוקד על דרכי התורה אפילו היו בידו עברות מצד תוקף יצרו ונתגדל על תכונות מדות רעות התורה מגינה עליו ר\"ל שאי אפשר שלא תדריכהו תורתו לשוב מהם שלא ישתקע בהם דרך הערה אמרו משל לאדם שהכה את בנו הכאה גדולה והניח לו רטייה על מכתו ואמר לו כל זמן שרטייה זו על גבי מכתך אכול מה שהנאתך ושתה מה שהנאתך ואי אתה מתירא ואם אתה מעבירה הרי מכתך מעלה נמי ר\"ל צמחים ובועות כך ברא הקדוש ברוך הוא יצר הרע ברא לו תורה תבלין כל שעוסק בתורה אינו נמסר בידו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"That is to say, is is impossible that one's Torah will not lead him to abandon his negative ways that he not become mired in them...\"</p>\n\n<p>This implies that it is not the act of study which is liberating, but rather the content of those teachings.

You have to understand the important distinction between the written torah and the oral torah. Think of it this way: judaism is like a speech, and when a speaker gives a speech, he does not write down every last word he is planning to say with every last detail. Rather, he writes major themes/topics in the form of bullet points. The written torah introduces all the themes and bullet points, but all of the details that are crucial and come along with it were given to Moshe on mount Saini who then passed the information down via an oral tradition generation to generation through the elders/sages of each respective generation. Eventually it started to be forgotten so Rabbi Yehudah Hanasi followed by Ravina Rav Asi and Rav ashi encoded the oral law into the the written Talmud. Roughly 95% of halachic law has a basis in the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>Also Rabbis were given the power by the Torah itself to make fences/boundaries for the people to keep them far away from sinning, so I guess technically you can say that those laws are \"man-made\" but really they are not because they were given permission to do this explicitly by Gd in the Torah itself.  </p>\n\n\n",

Or is the halachic requirement simply that one not eat bugs? </p>\n\n<p>MOTIVE:\nFor certain mitzvot, such as taharas hamishpacha and Pesach preparation, checks are halachically required, and--at least for taharas hamishpacha--one must perform them in a certain way. (Moreover, for taharas hamishpacha, the check is <em>sufficient</em> to establish the condition halachically; <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/67865/if-you-check-for-bugs-according-to-halachic-requirements-and-then-there-is-a-bu\">here</a>, I ask if the same is true with regards to checking for bugs.) I am wondering if the same is true for food. Is a check [of a certain kind] halachically <em>necessary</em>?</p>\n\n<p>IMPLICATIONS: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Could a self-designed method of checking be halachically acceptable? What level of reliability would it need to have in order to be so?</p></li>\n<li><p>From whom can one learn a method for checking for bugs? Could one adopt the method suggested by, say, someone with a lower kashrus standard, but who still keeps kosher?</p></li>\n<li><p>Could <em>no</em> method (that is, no checking) be acceptable if one knew the lettuce to be free of bugs? </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh's stipulation that only insects visible to the naked eye are prohibited (84:36) carries the suggestion that checking foods visually is halachically necessary. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kof-k.org/docs/checkvegetablesforbugs.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> document brings several sources that the checking process itself (\"bedikas hamazon\" or \"bedikas toalim\") is indeed halachically required:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What frequency level of infestation obligates a person to check a\n  particular fruit or vegetable? If it is a “miut ha’matzui”, a frequent\n  minority, the vegetable must be checked. What percentage is considered\n  a “miut ha’matzui”? This is the subject of dispute between many\n  authorities. Rav Moshe Vayeh in his sefer Bedikas HaMazon K’Halacha\n  (Part II 3:2 footnote 3) quotes the Responsa Rivash 191 that it must\n  occur with a frequency of close to 50%. The Mishkinos Yaakov (YD 17)\n  says that there is an obligation to check for insects even if they\n  occur ten percent of the time. The Shevet HaLevi (IV:81) and others\n  explain that the b’dika is not based on a specific percentage; rather\n  there is an obligation to check any item which is frequently infested\n  by insects. Even if the particular item has a low percentage of\n  infestation, if we see that it occurs regularly, there is an\n  obligation for bedika. Rav Shlomo Z. Auerbach rules like the opinion\n  of the Mishkinos Yaakov and that the number 10% is determined by the\n  item in question. For example, if one of ten (10) heads of lettuce\n  contains one or more insects, it requires bedika. NOTE: If an item\n  which does not require inspection was, nevertheless, found to contain\n  three or more insects, it must be fully inspected. If inspection is\n  not possible the food must be discarded (Shulchan Aruch YD 84:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[...]</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to HaGaon Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach ZT’L, produce which\n  cannot be checked [e.g. broccoli and cauliflower florets, frozen\n  spinach, canned asparagus] may be used without inspection in the\n  following manner: Break apart florets, agitate and soak in water for\n  ten minutes, pour off water, cook until soft. Puree finely in a\n  blender or food processor. Use as desired (e.g. in kugels or quiche).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This text seems to imply that checking is both a halachic requirement under certain circumstances and optional under others.</p>\n\n<p>Kof-K does not, however, supply any halachic sources for the instructions they give for checking, and I do not remember seeing such citations in any other guide. So there is still the question of who decides what checking procedures are acceptable, how, and whether this decision is based on halacha or mere practicality.</p>\n\n\n",

What exactly was counted? Did they count each of the 7 years that comprise each Shemitah year?(i.e., did they count each of the 49 years; saying, \"this is year 1; this is year 49\"?) Or did they count only each grouping of Shemittah years (saying, e.g. \"This is the 1st group of Shemitah years .. this is the 7th group)? Or did they count both?</p>\n\n<p>2) Who counted - was it all farmers; every person who lived in Israel; someone else?</p>\n\n<p>3) When was it counted - what date began the year?</p>\n\n<p>4) Was a bracha said (similar to what is done for counting the Omer)? If so, what was the bracha? If not, why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This Mitzva applies to Beit Din (Sifra to your verse; cf. Menachot 65b), and the year would begin on 1 Tishrei (RH 1:1). The Sifra clarifies that they would count both the total years of Yovel and the years of the current Shmita. So (as the Chinukh 330 explains it) it would be just like counting the Omer: \"This year is 33 years which is 4 Shmittot and 5 years in the Yovel\".</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Yovel 10:1) doesn't mention a blessing (which doesn't mean there isn't one), Tosefot (Menachot 65b) is unsure if a blessing would be recited, and Rosh (Pesachim 10:40) and Tosefot (Ketubbot 72a) take it as obvious that there was a blessing. The Ran (Pesachim R27b) implies no formal counting took place, just Beit Din had to keep track of where we were in the cylce.</p>\n\n\n",

The Maharsham writes [O.H. 306-4] that\n  perhaps since Hachnosas Orchim is a mitzvah, it would be permitted to\n  pay or accept payment, as found in similar cases of other mitzvos.

HaGaon Rav Moshe\n  Shternbuch shlita [Teshuvos V’Hanhagos Volume 2:197] strongly\n  disagrees and is of the opinion that if one accepts money, he would\n  not fulfill the mitzvah of Hachnosas Orchim. The Magen Avrohom [O.H.\n  38:8] rules that if one’s main intent was to fulfill the mitzvah, and\n  the payment was secondary, then he would have fulfilled the mitzvah.\n  The Biur Halachah extends this even further, saying that even if a\n  person’s intentions were equally weighted, that would be sufficient to\n  fulfill the mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Abaye in the Gemara 149a explains that this is a rabbinic restriction so as not to come to read a <em>Shtar Hedyot</em> on Shabbat. What is a <em>Shtar Hedyot</em> which one may not read on Shabbat? Rashi 116b s.v. Shtar explains it to be financial calculations or letters. Rambam (Peirush Mishnayot Shabbat 23:2) also explains <em>Shtar Hedyot</em> to mean letters and the reason for this is that on Shabbat one may only read Navi and it’s explanations and not even a book of wisdom and science. Bet Yosef 307:17 quotes the Baal HaMoer (43a s.v. VeHa) who agrees.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Rashba (149a s.v. VeLeInyan) explains Shtar Hedyot as a business document. This is also the definition of Ri quoted in Tosfot 116b s.v \"kol sheken\" and Rosh (see there where he writes that reading <em>shtarei hedyotot</em> is a problem of <em>mimtzo cheftzecha</em> from Yishayahu 58:13) Shabbat 23:1. Therefore, Sh”t Rashba 7:288 rules that it’s permitted to read books of wisdom and medicine and quotes Ramban who agreed.

Mishna Brurah 307:65 writes that the minhag is like the Rashba, however, a pious person should be strict. Rav Aviner holds like the Mishna Brurah.</p>\n\n<p>However, Yalkut Yosef (Shabbat vol 2, pg 214, 626) rules like Shulchan Aruch that one should only learn Torah on Shabbat and is only lenient to allow a medical student who has a test after Shabbat and is pressured for time to study medicine (except for the study of surgery) on Shabbat. </p>\n\n\n",

Such a decree would be because we fear that were we to get used to asking him to leave the light on, we would eventually ask him to turn it on for us.</p>\n<p>But, we do not make such a decree, because even if we fell into asking the gentile to turn it on, that would still only be a D'Rabbanan.</p>\n<p>However, we do make a gezeirah on a gezeirah by milk and meat. Cold chicken may not be eaten with a cold glass of milk, even though the real prohibition is a steak cooked in milk.

If you've ever read the Ba'al HaTurim or the Gra on the Parsha, they often use the trop as a way of getting another, hidden meaning out of the parshah. One of my favorites from the Gra, in the first passuk of Vayigash: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויגש אליו יהודה ויאמר בי אדני</p>\n  \n  <p>And Yehudah approached [Yosef] and said, please, my master</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The names of the trop on this phrase are, in order:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>קדמא ואזלא רביעי זרקא מנח סגול</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gra explains: Kadma v'Azla means \"got up and went.\" What got up and went? Revi'i, Yaakov's fourth son, Yehudah. What did he do? Zarka, he threw away. What did he throw? Munach, a resting place. And not just any resting place, but a Segol, related to Segulah - a treasured one, namely Olam HaBa. Yehuda was pleading to Yosef to let Binyamin go so that he wouldn't lose his Olam HaBa. (Of course, he did that anyway - Makkos 11a.)</p>\n\n<p>This is just one of many such examples of them being טעמי המקרא in the sense of טעם לשד השמן. In terms of טעם of טוב טעם ודעת, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71697/why-are-cantillation-notes-called-%d7%98%d7%a2%d7%9e%d7%99-%d7%94%d7%9e%d7%a7%d7%a8%d7%90#comment209971_71697\">DoubleAA pointed out</a> (I think this is what you meant), trop also serves to punctuate the passuk. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The cantillation marks were not only musical notations, but they also provided the logical understanding of the nuances of Scripture. That is, their hierarchy parsed the words of verses into logical segments, which were in turn subordinated one to the other. In this respect, the cantillation provide the nuance, or the “flavor,” of the meaning of Hebrew verse.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the following is the logical parsing of Isaiah 53:9 according to the hierarchical structure of the cantillation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GUstS.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GUstS.png\" alt=\"This image is a schematic depiction of the parsing of Isaiah 53:9 according to the system of Masoretic Cantillation in Biblical Hebrew.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Each segment is modified by the following segment. Each segment is further subdivided. Again, each segment is modified by the following segment. The major divisions, in turn, modify the previous major segments. In this regard, 99% of all verses in the Hebrew Scriptures possess these divisions, where segments and sub-segments modify the previous segments. In English, the segmentation of Isaiah 53:9 would be logically understood as follows. Please note how segments modify preceding segments.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hpy70.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hpy70.png\" alt=\"This image is a schematic depiction of the parsing of Isaiah 53:9 according to the system of Masoretic Cantillation, but now in English instead of Hebrew.\"></a></p>\n\n<p>The Hebrew word highlighted in red is חָמָס (<em>khä·mäse'</em>), which has been translated in various ways by various translators over the years. However, when viewed through the schemata of Hebrew cantillation, the full “flavor” of this word becomes very obvious. That is, this word would be best translated <em>injustice</em>. That is, the individual in this verse committed no injustice through any utterances ever made by his mouth. In this respect, he died in association with wicked men, but he was an innocent man.</p>\n\n\n",

Ginsburgh relates the story <a href=\"https://www.inner.org/spiritual-masters/choizeh-lublin-dont-rush-the-end-of-days\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"During Napoleon’s war against the Czar of Russia, the anticipation for the coming of Mashiach was at its height. When Napoleon’s army was defeated in 5574 (1814) many believed that the redemption was at hand. The Choizeh (Seer) of Lublin, who had always lived in burning anticipation of the coming of Mashiach, was convinced that the time had come. (Especially because four years earlier, when Rabbi Levi Yitzchak of Berditchev passed away, he promised that he would not rest or be silenced in heaven until he had brought the Mashiach).</p>\n<p>A number of tzaddikim joined the Choizeh in order to help him bring the Mashiach. Among them were his disciples: The Holy Jew, Rabbi Klonimus, author of the Ma’or Vashemesh, and Rabbi Naftali of Ropschitz. The Maggid of Kuzhnitz joined as well. The tzaddikim took upon themselves to invest great effort in prayers to bring the Mashiach. These tzaddikim saw the holiday of Simchat Torah of 5575 as a particularly auspicious date on which to execute their plan. Coming on the heels of Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, Simchat Torah would be the appropriate day to bring the Mashiach.</p>\n<p>On Simchat Torah eve, the Choizeh said to his chassidim, “If this Simchat Torah will be a good holiday, then Tisha B’Av (the day of mourning over the destruction of the two Holy Temples) will also be good. After the dancing with the Torah on Simchat Torah eve, the Choizeh directed his chassidim to remain together in the large room in his home, while he would enter his private room. He warned his disciples to keep a careful eye on him and guard him. The chassidim, however, became temporarily deaf and did not hear what he said to them. The Choizeh then turned to his wife, Beilah, and asked her to watch over him the entire night. But as King David said in Psalms, “If God will not safeguard a city, the guardsman will toil for naught.”</p>\n<p>A week prior to Simchat Torah, the day before the Sukkot holiday, the Maggid of Kuzhnitz passed away. On Simchat Torah eve, a rock was thrown at the home of the Holy Jew and shattered the window. Rabbi Klonimus immediately understood this as an omen and said, “Who knows what is happening now in Lublin, with the Choizeh…” and burst into tears. And during the Simchat Torah dancing in Rabbi Naftali of Ropshitz’s study hall, a fire broke out in his home. While Rabbi Naftali was standing in song and prayer, focusing on special intentions according to the inner dimension of the Torah, his family had to flee their burning home. One of the housemaids did not manage to flee in time and was killed.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, in Lublin, the Choizeh secluded himself in his private room on the second floor. Empty bottles of liquor from the joyous dancing still stood on the room’s windowsill. Suddenly, the Rebbetzin Bailah heard the voice of a child crying at the entrance of her home. She exited the room and went to open the door. But when she opened the door, she saw nobody. She immediately returned to her husband’s room, but to her horror, discovered that the Choizeh was not there and had apparently been abducted through the window. The Choizeh could not have climbed up to exit from the window, as it was very high up. In addition, the empty bottles were still in their place on the windowsill. Furthermore, this had been the Choizeh’s private room for fifteen years, and he had never even looked outside through the window.</p>\n<p>Rebbetzin Bailah called for help and for hours, the frantic chassidim searched the area for their Rebbe. Eventually, one of the chassidim heard a groan and found him, strewn on the ground tens of meters from his home, with many broken bones. When the chassid asked, “Who is this?” he heard the Choizeh’s voice saying, “Yaakov Yitzchak the son of Meitel.” The shocked chassid called for help and the Choizeh’s disciples carried their seriously injured rebbe to his home.</p>\n<p>The Choizeh related that Heaven had decreed to punish him for attempting to rush the redemption. Forces from Above had thrown him out the window in order to kill him. The recently deceased Maggid of Kozhnitz, however, had rushed from Heaven and stretched out his garment to soften the Choizeh’s fall. This is how the Choizeh found out that the Maggid of Kozhnitz had passed away. Afterwards he said that if he had known that the Maggid had died, he would not have pursued his plan.</p>\n<p>The Choizeh’s opponents heard that he had been seriously injured and hastened to drink a lechaim and to rejoice in his imminent demise. When the Choizeh heard this, he said, “When I leave this world, they will not even drink water.” And so it was, approximately ten months of suffering later, on Tisha B’Av, a fast day, the Choizeh passed away.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Judaism and 'Hospice Limited' Care",
    "content": "# Judaism and 'Hospice Limited' Care\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let me preface this by saying that I am sure there are many cases in which hospice is likely the best/only place for a person nearing the end of their life-- the only place where their intense medical needs can be met and at least some comfort given. That being said, the concept of 'residential' hospice is a bit different, in that they provide food, (some) medication, and other necessities of life but do not provide any mental or physical stimulation, socialization, or any effort to improve the patient's health. They often cease 'maintenance' medications (e.g, those for type 2 diabetes).</p>\n\n<p>The question then becomes, how is this type of 'hospice' viewed in the context of Judaism? Obviously, life is a gift from G-d and not to be dealt with anything other than the highest respect and consideration. (\"Whoever destroys one life is as if he destroyed a whole world, and whoever preserves a life is as if he preserved the whole world.\" -Sanhedrin 4:5) No one in this situation is actively doing anything to destroy a life. But they're not making a <em>positive</em>  effort to preserve it, either.</p>\n\n<p>I have encountered a lot of people saying \"its about comfort\" while, in the same breath stating that by not providing activities, stimulation, etc, the person will lapse into a more vegetative state and/or get depressed, stop eating, and die. I'm having a lot of trouble with this because it seems like seeing someone bleeding to death of a cut and just stepping over them (or holding their hand, if you want to buy the comfort spiel) rather than trying to stem the flow of blood. Moreover, I was fortunate enough to find a very nice pamphlet called \"A Jewish Response to Dementia\" by Rabbi Cary Kozberg, in which he emphasized that its important to allow that person to participate in whatever way they are able, for as long as they are able.  </p>\n\n<p>In situations like this, how can one honor the elderly patient, continue to respect them as a spiritual being, as well as abide by halacha and the ultimate directive G-d expresses by giving us life in the first place? </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Eating With Gentiles\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a Rabbinic law or a known pre-Rabbinic custom that supports a prohibition of Jews eating with Gentiles even if the meals are kosher?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Yes there is a special reason for Jews not to eat at an idolator's house even if the food is completely Kosher. This however is only binding when the idolator has invited the Jew to his house, or there was an assumed invitation. This is a law in the Talmud as seen <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/zarah/zarah_8.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> which expounds a passage in Exodus. </p>\n\n<p>Here is the relevant discussion starting from a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baraita\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baraita</a></p>\n\n<p>It has been taught: R. Ishmael says, Israelites who reside outside Palestine serve idols though in pure innocence. If, for example, an idolater gives a banquet for his son and invites all the Jews i n his town, then, even though they eat of their own and drink of their own and their own attendant waits on them, Scripture regards them as if they had eaten of the sacrifices to dead idols, as it is said, And he will call thee and thou wilt eat of his sacrifice ( Ex. XXXIV, 15).  But does not this apply to actual eating? — Said Raba: If that were so, the verse would have only said, And thou shalt eat of his sacrifice; why then say, And he will call thee? That extends the prohibition to the time of the participation. Hence during the entire thirty days [following a marriage celebration] whether it is or it is not mentioned that the banquet is connected with the wedding, [participation in it] is forbidden; from that time onward, however, if it is stated that it is connected with the wedding, it is forbidden, but if its connection with the wedding is not mentioned, it is permitted. And how long [is it forbidden] if it is connected with the wedding? — Said R. Papa: For a twelvemonth thereafter. And how long is it forbidden beforehand? — Said R. Papa in the name of Raba: From the time when the barley is placed in the tub.1  Is it, then, permitted [to partake of food in the house] after the twelvemonth? Yet R. Isaac the son of R. Mesharsheya, who happened to be in the house of a certain idolater more than a year after a marriage, when he heard that they were feasting [because of that event] abstained from eating there! It is different with R. Isaac the son of R. Mesharsheya who was a highly esteemed man.</p>\n\n<p>This law is codified in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> Yoreh Deah 152. </p>\n\n<p>It would seem from the sources you bring that there was a definite invitation, even though this does not seem so significant from the ensuing discussion there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Note that in the examples below, even if the food is kosher, one is still forbidden to accept food cooked by a non-Jew. Another example is the banquet produced by Achashveros where the food given to the Jews was completely kosher yet it was wrong of them to participate in the way that they did.</p>\n\n<p>There is a prohibition of food cooked by a gentile (bishul Akum) and bread of a gentile (Pas Akum) in order to prevent mingling that can lead to intermarriage. These laws are similar but have differences in the details. Similarly the issur of stam yaynam (wine touched or moved by a gentile) is similar to these halachos. The chachamim stated that all of these halachos are based on the idea that one must not socialize with gentiles in order to prevent the possibility of intermarriage or becoming close to them.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, cooking for a gentile <strong>on Yom Tov</strong> is forbidden because it is considered a melacha such as cooking on Shabbos. A Jew is allowed to cook food for himself or other Jews on Yom Tov as an explicit leniency given in the Torah. This leniency does not apply to non-Jews. Thus, it would be forbidden (except under certain specific circumstances and with caveats) to invite a nonJew for Yom Tov even if it would be allowed for Shabbos. This is because one is cooking food <strong>for the guest</strong> on Yom Tov which is asur.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/947606/jewish/Laws-of-Bishul-Yisrael.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laws of Bishul Yisrael</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>By forbidding Jews from eating food cooked by non-Jews, our sages\n  intended to create a social barrier between Jews and non-Jews in order\n  to prevent intermarriage. An example of social dining which led Jews\n  to intermarry is found in the Torah3: \"Israel settled in Shittim, and\n  the people began to commit harlotry with the daughters of the\n  Moabites. The [daughters of Moab] invited the people to the sacrifices\n  of their gods, and the people ate and prostrated themselves to their\n  gods.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>Some say that the reason for this prohibition is also to prevent a Jew\n  from becoming accustomed to eating food prepared by non-Jews, which\n  could eventually lead to eating non-kosher food.4</p>\n  \n  <p>The prohibition is called bishul akum, which literally means: \"cooking\n  of a pagan.\" Yet the prohibition applies to all non-Jews, even if they\n  are not pagans, as the prohibition against intermarriage applies to\n  all non-Jews.5 Food that was cooked by a Jewish person (see the\n  details of this below) is called bishul yisrael (\"cooking of a Jew\").</p>\n  \n  <p>The prohibition applies even if all of the ingredients used and the\n  manner of preparation are kosher.6</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Pat_Akum\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pat Akum</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Background: The Gezairah</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Chachomim enacted a gezairah forbidding bread that was baked by a\n  non-Jew[1] so as to avoid intermingling with them too much, which\n  could lead to intermarriage[2]. However, the bread of a non-Jew is\n  prohibited even if there's no possibility of intermarriage,[3] and\n  doesn't depend on whether or not the non-Jew is an idolater[4]</p>\n  \n  <p>It is permitted to derive benefit from bread baked by a non-Jew\n  without eating it.[5]</p>\n  \n  <p>While the Bavli's conclusion is somewhat ambiguous, most Rishonim\n  understand that the prohibition of eating pas akum was revoked to some\n  degree.[6] According to some[7], the prohibition was revoked by the\n  sages entirely. Another opinion, which is followed by Ashkenazim, is\n  that the rabbis allowed bread baked only by a non-Jewish baker (\"pas\n  paltar\", as opposed to \"pas baal habayis\"),[8] whether or not there is\n  bread baked by a Jew available.[9] The third, and most stringent\n  opinion, is that bread of a baker was permitted only in cases where\n  bread baked by a Jew is not available.[10] This appears to be the\n  opinion of the Shulchan Aruch.[11]</p>\n  \n  <p>Although Ashkenazi practice is to usually follow the Rama, several\n  poskim indicate that it is still proper to be stringent in this manner\n  and not eat pas paltar where pas yisroel is available.[12] Others are\n  not concerned with this for most of the year.[13] Someone whose\n  practice was to be careful not to eat pas paltar and wants to change\n  this practice must be mattir neder.[14]</p>\n  \n  <p>The Tur writes that even those who are not careful about pas paltar\n  during the year are careful to only eat pas yisrael during Aseres\n  Yemei Teshuvah.[15] Several reasons are given for this custom.[16]\n  Some say that this is true of Shabbos and Yom Tov as well, as part of\n  kavod shabbos.[17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A key to the question is \"even if the meals were kosher.\" In the episode in question the only issue is table fellowship. Prior to this, in the congregation at Antioch, Jews and Gentiles shared meals together. But when \"men from James\" [head of the Jerusalem congregation] came, these emissaries insisted on eating separately. Peter joined them in this attitude, for which Paul publicly blamed him.</p>\n<p>The OP question makes me think that this may have been a question of the \"men from James\" insisting on kosher food, which would have been difficult or too expensive for the general membership at Antioch. Alternatively, since the issue was not codified in rabbinic tradition until later, it may have been an question of halakhic debate at the time, as to whether strictly observant Jews could dine with non-Jews who were not actually idol worshipers.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, it's reminiscent of the original form of avodah, that of offering karbanos in the Beis HaMikdash.</strong></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The quote you are referring to is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לאהבה את ה' אלהיכם ולעבדו בכל לבבכם (דברים יא:יג). איזו היא עבודה שהיא בלב? הוי אומר זו תפלה</p>\n  \n  <p>\"To love Hashem and to serve him with all your heart\" (Devarim 11:13). What service is done with the heart? You must say this is Tefillah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the Tur (OC 98:1) had a different wording of our Gemara:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתיב ולעבדו בכל לבבכם. וכי יש עבודה בלב? אלא איזו היא עבודה שהיא בלב? הוי אומר זו תפלה</p>\n  \n  <p>And it is written, \"To serve Him with all your heart.\" Now, is there a service in the heart? Rather, what service is in the heart? It must be this is prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to the Tur, it seems, the Gemara is asking what service is in the <em>heart</em>, as service implies <em>doing</em> something, not just thinking about it. Thus, the passuk must be referring to prayer, which is the only thing you can actually <em>do</em> without performing an action. (Speech isn't called an action - Makkos 4b.)</p>\n\n<p>He thus explicitly disagrees with your statement in the question that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>when I think of service of the heart for example I think of all my whole being acting, according to what HaShem told according to His Torah; not only because He told so, but because my inner most being wants to serve Him out of the love, respect etc. I have for Him. For me it's the outward actions that show the inner part that I would like to call service of the heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's the opposite, in fact. It's what's inside that counts; your actions might be a \"service,\" but they're not \"of the heart.\"</p>\n\n<p>While we're on the topic, I'd like to point out the second Mishnah in Pirkei Avos:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמעון הצדיק היה משירי כנסת הגדולה. הוא היה אומר, על שלשה דברים העולם עומד: על התורה ועל <strong>העבודה</strong> ועל גמילות חסדים</p>\n  \n  <p>Shimon HaTzadik was among the remnants of the Men of the Great Assembly. He used to say, on three things does the world stand: on Torah, on <strong>service</strong>, and on kindness (emphasis mine).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What is the service mentioned in this Mishnah? The Bartenura says it's Karbanos, and the Tosfos Yom Tov agrees. But Rabbeinu Yonah expands on this concept, noting our Gemara in Taanis, and says that prayer is what is referred to here. Furthermore, now that we don't have the Beis HaMikdash, the tefillos are in place of the Karbanos. He brings several other proofs that the tefillos nowadays are equivalent to the karbanos in the times of the Beis HaMikdash.</p>\n\n<p>For one more parallel between the physical avodah of the Karbanos and the mental avodah of tefillah, here's a quote from the Midrash (Vayikra Rabbah 7:2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שהוא עושה תשובה כאילו עלה לירושלים ובנה את בית המקדש ובנה את המזבח ומקריב עליו כל הקרבנות שבתורה</p>\n  \n  <p>One who does Teshuvah is as if he went up to Yerushalayim, built the Beis HaMikdash, built the Mizbeiach, and brought on it all the Karbanos in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that one who davens with a full heart isn't just <em>equal</em> to bringing karbanos - after all, you can only get credit for whichever karbanos you bring under a specific circumstance, and it's impossible for every karban to be brought at once. But when you daven, you get credit for bringing every karban in the Torah!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Found a teaching that shows how Tefillah was defined as Avodah: \n<a href=\"http://jewishstudies.washington.edu/book/sifre-devarim/chapter/pisqa-41/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Piska 41</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Teaching states:</p>\n  \n  <p>“To love HASHEM your God” (Dt.11:13)— in all you do, act only out of\n  love. “And to serve Him (le`avdo; Dt.11:13)— this refers to\n  Torah-study.</p>\n  \n  <p>You claim this refers to Torah-study!

And since it is difficult for the mind to remember\n  all of this, it was necessary for our sages to arrange a written order\n  of the matters which most men need, which demonstrate to them their\n  great need for G-d and their need to submit to Him on account of of\n  them.

I have been searching for a source that prohibits this. Does anyone know of a source prohibiting eating in a restaurant when one is an Aveil?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I couldn't locate any source that specifically addresses eating in a restaurant. But I am excerpting some items from <a href=\"http://www.practicalhalacha.com/c/5467/death_and_mourning?view=halachot\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A mourner is defined in halacha as someone mourning during the\n  12-month mourning period for parents or the 30-day mourning period for\n  the other five relatives (spouse, brother, sister, son, daughter).\n  After 30 days, one is no longer a mourner for anyone but one's\n  parents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then, the site explains the problem of eating meals outside:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A mourner may not attend a public meal for any purpose. For example,\n  if the mourner attends a lecture or Torah class at which food is being\n  served, he or she may not eat the food. This only applies to sit-down\n  meals; snacking is permitted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>OK, so the question is if going to a restaurant is considered a \"public meal\". When I look at the examples listed further on that web page, he lists weddings, bar mitzvah, Torah lectures. The commonality is that this is a sit-down meal designated for a group of people who are considered a unit eating the same (mostly) food.</p>\n\n<p>A restaurant doesn't seem to fit that definition. They are a business and people order from a menu and eat at different times. However, an office party catered by the same restaurant sounds like it would fit the above definition of a \"public meal\". That's my own analysis.</p>\n\n<p>What does seem clearer from the above quote is that it seems restricted to a sit-down meal. If you go to Starbucks and drink a coffee at the table there, I don't think that's considered a \"meal\". </p>\n\n\n",

(He treats it as one definition of the two-letter root \"קר\".)</p>\n\n<p>Targum Onkeles (also brought by Rashi) translates קרי as קשוי, <b>hardness</b>.

And just as he is believed when he says: \"This son is my firstborn\", so is he believed when he says: \"This is the son of a divorced woman\", \"this is the son of a haluzah\".\nBut the Sages say: He is not believed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבא שאול היה קורא לשתוקי בדוקי. מאי בדוקי? אילימא שבודקין את אמו ואומרת לכשר נבעלתי - נאמנת, כמאן? כרבן גמליאל, תנינא חדא זימנא דתנן: היתה מעוברת, ואמרו לה מה טיבו של עובר זה? אמרה להם מאיש פלוני וכהן הוא, רבן גמליאל ור' אליעזר אומרים: נאמנת, ורבי יהושע אומר: לא מפיה אנו חיין ואמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל: הלכה כרבן גמליאל חדא להכשיר בה, וחדא להכשיר בבתה. הניחא למאן דאמר לדברי המכשיר בה פוסל בבתה, אלא למ\"ד לדברי המכשיר בה מכשיר בבתה, אבא שאול מאי אתא לאשמועינן? דאבא שאול עדיפא מדרבן גמליאל, דאי מהתם, ה\"א התם דרוב כשרין אצלה, אבל היכא דרוב פסולין אצלה - אימא לא, צריכא. אמר רבא: הלכה כאבא שאול. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Abba saul used to call the shethuki 'beduki'\".  What is [implied by] beduki?  shall we say that we examine his mother, and if she maintains, 'I cohabited with a fit person,' she is believed?  Then with whom [does this agree]?  with Rabban  Gamaliel! but we learnt it once.  For we learnt: if she [an unmarried woman] is pregnant and is asked: 'what is the nature of this child? ' and she replies, 'he is from so-and-so, who is a priest': <strong>Rabban  Gamaliel and Rabbi  Eliezer</strong> said: <strong>she is believed</strong>; Rabbi  Joshua said: we do not live by her words.  Now, Rav Judah said in Samuel's name: the <strong>halachah agrees with Rabban Gamaliel</strong>! - one is to declare her [the mother] fit; the other is to declare her daughter fit.  Now, that is well on the view that he who declares her [the mother] fit, declares the daughter unfit.  But on the view that he who declares her fit declares <strong>her daughter fit [too]</strong>, what does Abba Saul come to teach us? - Abba Saul's [ruling] is more remarkable than Rabban Gamaliel's.  for if from there, <strong>I might argue, [it is only] there, where most [men] are fit for her; but here, that most [men] are unfit for her, I might say, [she is] not [believed].  Hence it is necessary</strong>.  <strong>Said Raba: the halachah agrees with Abba Saul</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See Rambam, Kedusha, Isure Bia, 18, 13-14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Halacha 13</em> [The following rules apply if we] saw that an unmarried woman engaged in relations with a man who then departed. She is asked: \"Who is the man with whom you engaged in relations?\" If she says, \"He is an acceptable man,\"her word is accepted. Moreover, even if we see that she is pregnant and we ask her: \"From whom did you conceive?\" and she says, \"From an acceptable man,\" her word is accepted and she is permitted [to marry] a priest.\n<em>Halacha 14</em> When does the above apply? When the place where she engaged in relations was on a thoroughfare or in a carriage in the fields where everyone passes by, and most of the passersby are acceptable and most of the inhabitants of the city from which these passersby departed are acceptable. [The rationale for this stringency is that] our Sages elevated the standards required with regard to lineage54 and required two majorities. If, by contrast, most of the people passing by would disqualify her, e.g., they were gentiles, mamzerim, or the like, even if most of the inhabitants of the city from which they came were acceptable, we are suspect regarding her [status]. Perhaps she engaged in relations with a person who would disqualify her. Hence, the initial and preferred option is for her not to marry a priest.56 If she marries one, she need not divorce. [This ruling also applies] if most of the inhabitants of the locale were unacceptable even though most of the passersby were acceptable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, if they already were living in concubinage, the halacha addresses that obviously (following Chazaka) that the offspring is born from this couple. If they were already engaged and he agrees that it is his offspring, it is his offspring following the halacha.</p>\n<p>See SA EH 4, 27:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כז אֲרוּסָה שֶׁנִּתְעַבְּרָה וְהִיא בְּבֵית אָבִיהָ, אִם הִיא אוֹמֶרֶת שֶׁמֵּהָאָרוּס נִתְעַבְּרָה, אִם הוּא מוֹדֶה אוֹ שֶׁאֵינוֹ בְּפָנֵינוּ, הַוָּלָד כָּשֵׁר. וְהָוֵי בְּנוֹ לְיוֹרְשׁוֹ. וַאֲפִלּוּ אִם הָאָרוּס אוֹמֵר שֶׁאֵינוֹ זוֹכֵר רַק שֶׁאֵינוֹ מַכְחִישָׁהּ (שָׁם בְּהָרַ''ן).‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>##Conclusion: The child is not Mamzer and is considered as the son/daughter of the couple.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The non-Jewish world considers a child born from a pre-marital union to have the status of a foundling, not a bastard.</p>\n\n<p>There was a sugya in daf yomi 4 days ago that relates to this question, if an arusah becomes pregnant do you assume the arus is the father.</p>\n\n<p>It would probably be more decent for the child to be able to cover up their non-marital origin if the parents married before their birth, but as you pointed out this makes no difference to their yichus.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there an obligation to Count the Omer without a Bracha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If I forgot to count at night and during the day, I cannot continue to count with a bracha. This was formulated in my Dirshu Daf HaYomi B'Halacha email as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Mechaber writes that one who neglected to count at night may count in the morning without a beracha. The Mishnah Berurah adds that he may then continue counting the rest of the nights with a beracha. Someone who neglected to count one full day cannot continue to count with a beracha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there an <strong>obligation</strong> to continue counting without a bracha? Is the mitzvah of \"Usefartem Lachem,\" \"And you shall count for yourselves\" (Vayikra 23:18) still in effect even though one can no longer say the bracha, or is counting optional or even not at all efficacious in any sense?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>There's no such thing as \"counting with a bracha\" and \"counting without a bracha\". The Mitzva is to count.</p>\n\n<p>Blessings on (just about) all Mitzvot are separate rabbinic obligations. Whether or not a blessing is said on a Mitzva is a separate question from if there is a Mitzva (some Mitzvot never have blessings!). A Mitzva done without its requisite blessing (if there is one) is still completely effective. As such we generally only say the blessing when we know for sure we are fulfilling the Mitzva, because there is \"little\" to gain by saying it, and much to lose (Berakha Levatalla -- blessings in vain).</p>\n\n<p>So now just learn the laws of when one is obligated to count the Omer (or whatever other Mitzva you are interested in). If you are for sure obligated, include the blessing. If not, better to omit the blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Some highlights of such a study would include: Most Rishonim assume that one is obligated to count that day's Omer at some point over the 24 hours of each day between Pesach and Shavuot. There are a few Rishonim (eg. Tosfot Menachot 66a) who hold that the Mitzva only applies at night because that's when the barley for the Omer offering was reaped. There is a variant text of the Behag (quoted as a \"wonder\" in that Tosfot) which says if you miss a day then the obligation ends.</p>\n\n<p>Ok. So if in accordance with most opinions you are counting during the daytime or after you missed a day, better (at least according to the Shulchan Arukh OC 589) to just omit the blessing because it's possible according to certain minority opinions that you aren't fulfilling the Mitzva. Similarly, if you don't remember if you counted already that day, go ahead and count, but leave out the blessing. (Ideally, of course, you'd avoid situations of doubt and fulfill the Mitzva according to everyone by counting every day and always at night.)</p>\n\n<p>The Terumat HaDeshen (#37) writes that if you aren't sure if you missed a day, then you don't need to worry about the opinion of the Behag, since it's only a doubt about a minority opinion and we don't need to be <em>that</em> worried about Berakha Levatalla. This is the ruling of the Shulchan Arukh (OC 589:8). Counting one day during the daytime (or any other doubtful counting) is no worse than being unsure if one counted at all (Levush, etc., ibid.) and one should proceed to further days as if they are for sure obligated to count.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The short answer is <strong>yes</strong>. The reason is that there is a machlokes as to whether it is a mitzvah to count <strong>each day</strong> or if the mitzvah is one \"long\" mitzvah to count all seven weeks or both. Thus, we count without a bracha to take all the opinions into account. Rabbi Chaim Jachter discusses the latest time that one can count the omer and explains why we would not use a bracha during the day (to maintain the continuity of the count and resume with a bracha)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2317\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefirat Ha’omer – If a Person Missed a Day of Counting</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If, however, one misses an entire day of counting, then he no longer\n  counts the Omer with a Beracha. This means that if a person did not\n  count at all at night or the following day, he must omit the Beracha\n  when counting the Omer henceforth. <em>There is a common misconception\n  that once a person misses a day of counting, he no longer needs to\n  count at all. This is not correct;</em> a person in such a situation must\n  continue counting each night, only without reciting a Beracha. <em>There\n  are Halachic authorities who maintain that the obligation of Sefirat\n  Ha’omer remains fully intact even after one misses a day of counting</em>,\n  and one must count even with a Beracha. We omit the Beracha in this\n  situation in deference to the view that there is no longer an\n  obligation of counting once one missed a day, but one must\n  nevertheless continue counting as required according to many\n  authorities.</p>\n  \n  <p>Hacham Ben Sion Abba Shaul (Israel, 1923-1998), in his work Or Le’sion\n  (vol. 3, 16:7), writes that when one resumes counting after missing a\n  day, he must first make mention of the missed day. For example, if one\n  missed the twenty-second day of the Omer, he cannot simply count that\n  night “Hayom Shelosha Ve’esrim Yom La’omer She’hem Shelosha Shabuot\n  U’shneh Yamim.” Since he had missed the twenty-second day, he cannot\n  “jump” to the twenty-third day. Instead, he must first say, “Etmol\n  Haya Shenayim Ve’esrim Yom La’omer She’hem Shelosha Shabuot Ve’yom\n  Ehad,” noting the previous day’s counting, and then he can proceed to\n  count the twenty-third day. And if a person missed two days of\n  counting, then he must mention both days he had missed (“Shilshom\n  Haya… Etmol Haya…”). No matter how many successive days one missed, he\n  must mention all of them before proceeding to count that night of the\n  Omer.</p>\n  \n  <p>Summary: A person who missed a day of counting during the Omer must\n  continue counting the Omer each night thereafter, though without a\n  Beracha. When one resumes counting after missing a day, he must first\n  mention the previous day’s counting by saying “Etmol Haya…La’omer,”\n  and only then proceed to that night’s counting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/The%20Latest%20Time%20For%20Counting%20Sefirah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Latest Time For Counting Sefirah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Gemara (Menachot 66a) writes that we should count the Omer at\n  night because of  “Temimot”, that the full day should be counted (as\n  we explained last week).  Tosafot (ad. loc. s.v. Zecher), in turn,\n  cite a dispute between the Behag and Rabbeinu Tam whether counting the\n  Omer during the day is acceptable B’Diavad (post facto).  This dispute\n  hinges on the unresolved Tannaitic debate whether it is acceptable\n  B’Diaved to perform Ketzirat HaOmer (cutting of the barley for the\n  Korban Omer) during the day of sixteenth of Nissan (although all agree\n  that ideally it should be performed on the night of the sixteenth of\n  Nissan).  This issue continued to be debated throughout the time of\n  the Rishonim and no consensus opinion emerged during this period. \n  Hence, the Shulchan Aruch (Orach Chaim 489:7) adopts a compromise view\n  that if someone forgot to count the Omer at night, he should count the\n  Omer the next day without a Bracha.  Interestingly, Rav Yitzchak Yosef\n  (Yalkut Yosef 5:424) notes the practice in Jerusalem for everyone to\n  count the Omer in Shul in the morning without a Bracha, in case\n  someone forgot to count the Omer the previous evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

For example, according to the Talmud, \"During prayer, one should keep his feet together, as is written, 'Their feet were straight' [Yechezkel 1:7]\" [Berachot 10b]. In the laws of Shemona Essrei, Avudraham writes, \"This is symbolized by the fact that 'yeshara' (straight) has the same numerical value as 'tefila' (prayer).\" He also adds that the main factors in prayer are avoiding undesired thoughts and maintaining the proper attitude, and he notes that \"prayer (tefila) has the same value as 'bekavanat halev' (attitude of the heart) and it is also equal to 'avodat lev' (service of the heart).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's the quotation of Avrudraham that really got my interest (Anyone know its source?) But after calculating, i found that tefilah and b'kavanat halev indeed share the same gematria (515), but the gematria of avodat lev is 514; did i miscalculate? or did I not understand the part 'it is also equal to avodat lev' correctly? </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:3BQhnnPDhvIJ:www.seliyahu.org.il/parasha/par5762/epar62017.rtf%20&cd=1&hl=nl&ct=clnk&gl=nl&client=firefox-b\" rel=\"nofollow\">link</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In reckoning the correspondences of a word, it is traditional in gematria to consider also words having a total one less and one more than that of the number in question. This practice is stated as: \"it is permissible to add or subtract an Aleph\". An examination of the entries for consecutive numbers in this dictionary will show that some words duplicate within short ranges, owing to changes of gender, case, common speech variations, conjugation or declension. The practice of subtracting one stems mainly from the fact that any word with an Aleph after the first letter can have that Aleph replaced by a suitable vowel point. Addition of an Aleph to a word does not effect the pronunciation at all, unless a vowel point is assigned to the Aleph --- even then, such a vowel point can usually be borrowed from a consonant. This property of Aleph is also found to a lesser extent for Yod, Vau and Heh.\nSome multiple variants differ only in gender or case of possession.</p>\n\n\n",

While this may not have been explicitly mentioned in the verses, Jezebel's children, and indeed all of Ahab's decendants (it's not clear if he had children through other wives, see Yalkut Shimoni 232), were all hunted down and killed, so it's clear they weren't finding favor in God's eyes. It's likely they ruled by force, not based on any Halakhic decisors. (Note the question becomes even more complicated as Athalia, in the line of David, may be a descendant of Jezebel's (see Kings 2:8:27).)</p>\n\n<p>However, Tosfot to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=26b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">AZ 26b</a> says Joram was a Jew, and the Yerushalmi (Horyot 3:2) says that Jehu (who came later) was the first of the kings of the northern kingdom to not be Halakhically a king. They likely hold that Jezebel converted and then one has to analyze the laws of conversions to determine what would constitute sufficient acceptance of the Torah to qualify (perhaps she intended to keep the commandments for an initial period, or perhaps her intent to marry her husband binds her to his commitment to the commandments; see the articles above for details).</p>\n\n<p>See Tzitz Eliezer 10:41:2 and Yabia Omer YD 5:13:2 who discuss possible legal applications of the different positions.</p>\n\n\n",

About shmirah of shomeret yom keneged yom, One Tana, Rabbi yossi thinks that night may be shimur. But about Haarev shemesh <a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_daf.php?ms=Berachoth&df=2a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> Brachot 2a&b said explicitely that the happening of the night is the criterion.

So, it should be noted that <strong>Tvilat Ezra has no rule of Tevul yom</strong>. Immediately after immersion, \"Takanat Ezra's speaking\", this man is clean. Even more, this the rule is the same if his \"emission\" appened at morning, and the mikveh or pouring 9 kabim (see later) immediately after. Changing clothes is not a part of th Ezra's ordinance, but when sperm is not dried he is considered as a soiling liquid like urine.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>kula of 9 kabim is to pouring water divided at the most in three times</strong> on the Baal Keri.

I'm asking about a general case of doing this when it applies to any situation of Shalom Bayit.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In your particular situation, I happen to think lying in general is a bad idea. The truth is likely to come out at some point; at which point now the wife has to deal with two disturbing things (the injury, and the lie) rather than one.</p>\n\n<p>But for theory's sake: Keep in mind that in <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=18\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 18</a>, God lies to Abraham to protect Sarah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>SARAH: <em>I can't have kids, Abraham's too old!</em> </p>\n  \n  <p>GOD: <em>Hey Abraham, Sarah said she's too old to have kids</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As for a flesh-and-blood precedent, have a look at Yevamot 63a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רב הוה קא מצערא ליה דביתהו כי אמר לה עבידי לי טלופחי עבדא ליה חימצי חימצי עבדא ליה טלופחי כי גדל חייא בריה אפיך לה אמר ליה איעליא לך אמך אמר ליה אנא הוא דקא אפיכנא לה אמר ליה היינו דקא אמרי אינשי דנפיק מינך טעמא מלפך את לא תעביד הכי שנאמר (ירמיהו ט) למדו לשונם דבר שקר</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav's wife liked to torment him: whatever he'd request for dinner, she'd make something else. When his son Chiya grew up, he started reversing his father's dinner request. <em>Your mother has improved!</em>, said Rav to Chiya. <em>No, I've been switching it on her</em>, he replied. </p>\n  \n  <p><em>I guess that's they say, you learn from your kids sometimes! [I may reverse the order myself, but] you shouldn't do it, as Jeremiah bemoans that Jews have trained themselves to speak lies.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that Rav didn't say \"thou shalt not lie!\", he said it's a dirty habit that he doesn't want his son picking up.</p>\n\n<p>My reading of that would be that it is permissible, though distasteful, to be untruthful if it would genuinely help someone else's relationship; however it's not right for my pal to demand that I do it.</p>\n\n\n",

If you didn't think about this <em>trick</em> then it would go by <em>how most  people would interpret it</em>. Most people assume (as far as I know) that <em>40 days at the Kotel</em> mean you have to make the effort to go 40 consecutive days to the Kotel.</p>\n\n<p>This is called: בִּנְדָרִים הַלֵּךְ אַחַר לְשׁוֹן בְּנֵי אָדָם</p>\n\n<p>But even if you had in mind to simply pray 40 consecutive days at the Kotel, with on 20 trips, you probably can't do it right before & after sunset.</p>\n\n<p>I have been taught that the Yerushalmim consider the first 13 minutes after sunset as day (and in a pinch you can Daven Mincha then).</p>\n\n<p>18 minutes after sunset you can already daven Maariv without repeating Shma. I assume the 5 minutes between are <em>Bein Hashmashot - twilight</em>.</p>\n\n<p>So if you want to do <em>40 days at the Kotel</em> in 20 days, you probably need to pray for a few moments before sunset (or within the 13 minutes thereafter in emergency), and then again 18 minutes after sunset.</p>\n\n\n",

Does it mean <strong>a garment smaller than the prescribed measure</strong>? But it has been taught: A garment with <strong>which a child can cover his head and most of his body, and in which a grown-up person would walk out for a moment</strong>, is subject to zizith; <strong>but if a child cannot cover with it his head and most of his body, even though a grown-up person might walk out in it for a moment, it is exempt</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"A child\" is not an accurate measure! To determine with which a grown-up preson would walk out for a moment is not easy. How this Gemara leads to precise sizes ?</p>\n<p>The first step toward practical indications is to learn Rambam, Ahava, Tsitsit, 3, 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א  כְּסוּת שֶׁחַיָּב אָדָם לַעֲשׂוֹת בָּהּ צִיצִית מִן הַתּוֹרָה--הִיא כְּסוּת שֶׁיֵּשׁ לָהּ אַרְבַּע כְּנָפַיִם, אוֹ יָתֵר עַל אַרְבַּע; וְתִהְיֶה מִדָּתָהּ, כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּתְכַּסֶּה בָּהּ רֹאשׁוֹ וְרֻבּוֹ שֶׁלַּקָּטָן הַמְּהַלֵּךְ לְבַדּוֹ בַּשּׁוּק, וְאֵינוּ צָרִיךְ אַחֵר לְשָׁמְרוֹ וְלֵילֵךְ עִמּוֹ; ‏</p>\n<p>A garment to which the Torah obligates a person to attach tzitzit [must meet the following requirements]:\na) it must have four - or more than four - corners;\nb) it must be large enough to cover both the head and the majority of the body of <strong>a child who is able to walk on his own in the marketplace without having someone else accompany him and watch him</strong>;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question is how Rambam assumed that the age, the development step of this child is determined by his hability to walk on his own in the marketplace without having someone else accompany him and watch him? The Raavad answer that this is a deduction, such a garment must be possible to help a grown-up person to walk for a moment (a passage of the Gemara not pasted on Rambam), so this kid must be close to the size of an adult person (<strong>an adult is at least 13 years old according to Halacha</strong>). The Kessef Mishne infered from the fact that the passage concerning adult person is skipped by Rambam, that this is an other Halacha: An adult, if large sized, cannot simply keep a Talit which can cover head and most body of a child. It must suit him a minimum, per example he will not to be ashamed with this garment and be able to walk. So i Reuven is XXL and Shim'on Small size, the Talit of Shim'on is perhaps unable for Reuven's Mitsvat Tsitsit.</p>\n<p>The Tur define the child as 9 years old. Kesef Mishne explains that this age is linked to the ability to be careful not to loose the Talit, not only the ability to walking alone on the streets. Magen Avraham understand that 9 years is choose because this is the age of Chinuch.</p>\n<h2>Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x371\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chayim 16</a></h2>\n<p>He specifies that the size regards length and width (head and majority of the body in length and width), that the child must to fulfill the condition mentioned above for understanding the Tur. So we may deduct 9 years.</p>\n<p>So, it is very relevant to verify if it is not too small for walking a few moment with it on ths street.</p>\n\n\n",

That concept goes along with the beginning of the verse that says that Samuel is to appoint him as a \"prince\" over my people.</p>\n\n<p>In the beginning, as in I Samuel 13 (kudos to @Menachem), he did defeat the Philistines and saved Israel from their oppression. Note that the concept of saving them does not imply permanently vanquishing them.</p>\n\n<p>But view chapter 15, esp. verse 26 where Samuel sates very emphatically that G-d had rejected Saul from becoming king. See Malbim's commentary on this verse. Essentially, he states a few concepts:</p>\n\n<p>1 - It was G-d that appointed Saul king, not the people.\n2 - Because of this, he was certainly bound to listen to G-d's commandments rather than the people's demand (regarding taking the spoils from Amalek.) Thus, he should have refused the people's request instead of relenting to them.\n3 - Because he rejected G-d's word while he was king, he is not fit to be the king.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, the kingship was taken away from Saul and given to \"a friend who is better than you\" (See verse 28.)</p>\n\n<p>Granted, that Saul could have saved Israel from the Philistines as a \"citizen\" without being king. But, it's a given that the people were looking for a leader and a king to do the job. If he's no longer king, what would have been the likelihood that the people would have listened to him?</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it seems a logical deduction, that if G-d had rejected him from being the king and G-d had appointed him, how could the people go against G-d and make him a continuing leader after the fact?</p>\n\n<p>In short, kingship was a requirement to be able to save the people from the Philistines. After all, that is also what the people had initially requested from Samuel, that they wanted a king, specifically. See Chapter 8 verse 20 that implies that the people wanted one of the king's roles to be someone to fight the wars for them.</p>\n\n<p>Note that Saul did not kill himself. He requested his war-tool carrier to kill him. (A fact that David did not excuse, BTW. See beginning of II Samuel.) The reason is that he didn't want the Philistines to make a mockery of him and claim victory by saying that they killed the king. (Technically, he still was \"king\" even though David had been annointed.) I don't see this action as being incompatible with the idea of saving Israel. In a sense, he did just that by saving Israel's honor. Note, incidentally, that even in his weakened state without the official kingship, his maddened mental state, and the fact that G-d was not supporting him, Saul still attempted to fight the Philistines and save Israel from their oppression.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Who was the Ramchal fighting?",
    "content": "# Who was the Ramchal fighting?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Ramchal wrote the Mesillas Yesharim in 2 formats. The first version was written as a conversation (seder vikuach) between a chacham and a chasid [the second version is what everyone is now familiar with]. In the beginning of chapter #2 of the vikuach version, entitled ‘chovas haadam el boro’,  the Ramchal speaks about a mistaken view, that is that God created the world for some purpose that man is not essentially needed for. Man was created for a secondary purpose, after the fact, in order to benefit from the pleasures of the world and to contemplate the beauty and wisdom found within the world. According to this view the objective of the mitzvos is 2-fold, 1: so that man will know that he is a servant and not a master, a creation and not the/a creator and 2: to give order to the existence of man so that he will not be like the animals.</p>\n\n<p>Although the Ramchal, before presenting this view, writes that this view is generated from a lack of knowledge and limited studies [additionally, after presenting this view he writes that despite the fact that there are many sources that seem to confirm this view, it’s a mistake that comes about due to the heart being seduced after ta’avah] , I want to know if this view was actually held by anyone that we know of? I would be more satisfied with Jewish sources that profess such a view, but non-Jewish sources are welcome as well!</p>\n\n<p>[As an aside, I find it very interesting that in the second version of the Mesillas Yesharim, he does not (explicitly) express that his goal in writing is to deny this view.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This opinion is rejected as directed by material passions (as described at the end of this post.). The \"linear version\" of Mesilat Yesharim summarized it in one statement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שתכלית בריאת האדם הוא למצבו בעולם הזה. ‏</p>\n<p>that the purpose of creation of man is its situation in this world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>This is the main opposition between the Ramchal's opinion and this opinion.</strong></p>\n<p>This philosophy recognizes no other reality than being in \"this\" world. This is perhaps an allusion to Tsadok and Baytos, see Rambam on Pirke Avot (1, 3):\nThere were two pupils of Antignos, Tsadok and Baytos. They misunderstood the statement \"אַל תִּהְיוּ כַעֲבָדִים הַמְשַׁמְּשִׁין אֶת הָרַב עַל מְנָת לְקַבֵּל פְּרָס, אֶלָּא הֱווּ כַעֲבָדִים {הַמְשַׁמְּשִׁין אֶת הָרַב שֶׁלֹּא עַל מְנָת לְקַבֵּל פְּרָס,‏\" and concluded both that there is no Sachar and Onesh.</p>\n<p>The source is in Avot Derabbi Natan chapter 5 mishna 2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנטיגנוס איש סוכו היו לו שני תלמידים שהיו שונין בדבריו, והיו שונים לתלמידים, ותלמידים לתלמידיהם. עמדו ודקדקו אחריהן, ואמרו: מה ראו אבותינו לומר דבר זה, אפשר שיעשה פועל מלאכה כל היום ולא יטול שכרו ערבית, אלא, אילו היו יודעין אבותינו שיש עולם אחר, ויש תחיית המתים, לא היו אומרים כך. עמדו ופירשו מן התורה, ונפרצו מהם שתי פרצות: צדוקין וביתוסין. צדוקים על שום צדוק, ביתוסין על שום ביתוס. והיו משתמשין בכלי כסף וכלי זהב כל ימיהם, שלא היתה דעתן גסה עליהם. אלא צדוקים אומרים, מסורת הוא ביד פרושים שהן מצערין עצמן בעולם הזה, ובעולם הבא אין להם כלום: ‏</p>\n<p>Tsdukim say: The Pharisean tradition is to bruise themselves in this world and in the coming word they have no reward.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's true that the approach of Tsdukim is more extremist. But their whole philosophy was a consequence of one premise only.</p>\n<p>The first hypothesis in Sadducee's theory was the lack of future world. It's true that later this assumption took them deeper into heresy.\nThey found that their new philosophy may be congruent to Scriptures (they do not believe in Scriptures but know that politically, to say that they are agreed by scripture was better.)</p>\n<p>The Ramchal intends to demonstrate a cascade of consequences of this premise:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Mitsvot are for social and general well being in this world.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ramchal presents conclusive evidences that Chachamim are against this premise.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Perhaps one per thousand would achieve the better use from this world.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The great complexity and details of mitsvot are useless if the intent is only well being in this world.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The human soul is at a very high spiritual level, and it is useless in this world.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is possible to argue that this reasoning has an inevitable consequence for both, for the supporters of the premise and for opponents.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Supporters follow this reasoning up to its logical conclusion. There are no Judge and no Judgment, as Tsadock and Baytos concluded.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Opponents refuted the premise and concluded that the goal of man is his situation in the future world.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In his introduction to the discussion, Ramchal started with an analysis of the motivation of supporters of the premise, in the dialog version he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין זה אלא טעות ותרמית הלב הנפתה אחר התאווה. ועליהם אני קורא: אם ללצים הורא יליץ. ‏</p>\n<p>It's only mistake and a ploy of the heart, which is attracted by desire. The following verse suits them well: \"If it concerneth the scorners, He scorneth them\". {cunning people are fooled by their own desire}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>So the issue here is the starting point of the Sadducees reasoning.</h2>\n<p>Afterwards I want to add that the opinion of Ramchal is controversial.  The Taam Etso disagrees and thinks that the man was created to honor Hashem. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/98914/9215\">this</a> link.</p>\n<p>Afterwards again, i found in the Peri Haarets a passage saying that the goal of creation is for the situation in Olam Haze,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וידוע הוא שעיקר בריאת העולם היה עבור עולם הגשם הזה החומרי אע\"פ שהוא גוף קשה אעפ\"כ יהיה מלא כה\"כ ולכן כל הצמצומים והגבורות היו ג\"כ עבור התגלות אלהותו ית' בשפלים התחתונים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am almost sure that this is the point of the Taam Etso. So, we can say that the goal of the creation has a goal different from the goal of the man, from his subjective point of view. The man has as goal to discover the Creator the best possible. But the Kavod of Hashem is the effort made by men in this world. So, finally, I think that Ramchal is fighting Saduceans, not the point afforded by Taam Etso. I would be happy to discuss this with someone who knows Chasidut about this topic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>the Ramchal brings sources for this in chapter 1 of the common Mesilat Yesharim</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Behold, our sages, of blessed memory, have taught us that man was\n  created solely to rejoice in G-d and to delight in the splendor of the\n  Shechina (divine presence). For this is true joy, and the greatest\n  possible pleasure that can possibly exist. The place of this joy is,\n  in truth, in Olam Haba (the afterlife). For it was created expressly\n  for this purpose. ut the path to arrive at our \"desired haven\"\n  (Ps.107:30) is this world. This is what our sages of blessed memory\n  said: \"this world is similar to a corridor before the afterlife\" (Avot\n  4:16)..... When you look further into the matter, you will see that\n  true perfection is only clinging to G-d. This is what King David said\n  \"But as for me, closeness to G-d is my good\" (Ps.73:28) and, \"one\n  thing I asked from G-d; that I seek, that I may dwell in G-d's house\n  all the days of my life, to gaze on the pleasantness of G-d...\" (Ps.\n  27:4). For only this is the good. And anything besides this that\n  people consider good is really emptiness and mistaken worthlessness</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Chaim Shalenger comments in his book <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=3&e=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a>.</p>\n\n<p>\"Until now his words regarding this world and the next were based on the teachings of the sages. He will now bring two arguments from reason to show that it is not possible to think this world and its pleasures are the purpose of creation.\"</p>\n\n<p>the Ramchal continues</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In truth, no rational person can believe that the purpose of man's\n  creation is for his station in this world. For what is man's life in\n  this world? Who is truly happy and content in this world? \"The days of\n  our life are 70 years, and if by strength, 80 years, yet their span is\n  labor and trouble\" (Ps.90:10). How many sorts of sufferings and\n  sicknesses, pains and burdens, and after all this death! Not one in a\n  thousand can be found to whom this world has granted plenty of\n  pleasures and true contentment. And even such a person, if he would\n  reach a hundred years, already passes and disappears from the world.</p>\n  \n  <p>Furthermore, if the purpose of man's creation were for the sake of\n  this world, it would not be necessary to imbue him with such a lofty\n  and exalted soul, greater even than the angels themselves.</p>\n  \n  <p>Especially so, when the soul finds no satisfaction whatsoever from all\n  the pleasures of this world. This is what our sages teach us in\n  Midrash Koheles: \" 'the soul will not be filled' (Koheles 6:7) - What\n  is this analogous to? To the case of a common peasant who marries the\n  king's daughter. If he brought her all that the village possessed, it\n  would be as nothing to her. For she is the king's daughter. So too\n  with the the soul, if you would bring to her all the pleasures of this\n  world, they would be like nothing to her. For the soul is from higher\n  worlds\" (Koheles Raba 6:7)...</p>\n  \n  <p>To summarize what we have learned, the essence of man's existence in\n  this world is solely to fulfill the commandments, serve [G-d] and\n  stand up to trials.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

What is the reason for this? - Here it was explained, on account of a harlot {<em>Rashi</em>:this Gentile will enter in relationship with a non-religious Jewish woman and they will marry}. Rab Judah said, It is to be feared that [an Israelite] might join him on the road and he might kill him {<em>Rashi</em>: he may use the Tsitsit to gain confidence of a Jew and kill him}.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now consider SA OC 15, 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מותר להתיר ציצית מטלית זה וליתנם בטלית אחר אבל שלא ליתנם בבגד אחר לא.‏</p>\n<p>It is permissible to remove tsitsit from this talit and fasten them to another talit; but to not fasten them to another talit, no.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second part of the statement is an extract of <strong>Tosfot Shabbat 22a</strong> (Dibur Hamatchil Rav amar).</p>\n<p>The reason is that now a mitsva will be cancelled from the Talit without a new mitsva for another Talit. The source is <strong>Gemara</strong> (Menachot 41b; <strong>Shabbat 22a</strong>): In Gemara, Rav said it's prohibited to move Tsitsit from garment to garment, and Shmuel allowed it. The Gemara for <strong>Halacha follows Shmuel</strong>'s opinion . Tosfot Shabbat 22a explained that Shmuel thinks that Tsitsit is \"a duty of the garment, not of the man\". Therefore, one is not allowed to remove them from a 4 Kanfot garment without other purpose. The problem is \"mitsva's cancellation\". So Magen Avraham explained that if the garment will be sold to a Gentile, anyway the garment of a Gentile has no duty of Tsitsit, so the vendor is allowed to remove the Tsitsit before. when giving the Talit to a whasherwoman (21, 3), the Talit remains duty, but the purpose is to fast a new tsitsit after laundry, so Mishna Berura allows. Mishna Berura on Siman 15, cited in the OP adds a reason (add a reason after the reason of cancellation of mitsva): disgracing Mitsva. (I guess that an example who need this reason is if a man fastens and removes tsitsit from a garment as a game, without purpose.)</p>\n<p>Obviously, for your question, there is no cancellation of the mitsva and no disgracing if your intention is to fasten on this Talith a tsitsit (this tsitsit or new Tsitsit): maybe even according to Rav it is allowed. The SA OC in 21, 3 is perhaps not linked with your question. Magen Avraham 15, subparagraph 2 said in name of the Levush that one is allowed to remove tsitsit when his purpose is to fasten a more beautiful tsitsit.</p>\n<p>Thus, to your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if I want to put my tallit (either gadol or qatan) in a laundry machine, am I allowed to remove its ẓiẓit beforehand\n--> <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As a son of a coppersmith and a descendant of Oholiav Ben Achisamach, the co-constructor of the Mishkan, through his mother, the Gemara uses him as a model that one should follow in his parents' footsteps in respect to career (Erchin 16b).

So translated it might mean something like \"alive and great\". Another possibility is that it's short for Achiram - אחירם - which is composed of Achi - אחי - and Ram - רם, which mean my brother and great, respectively. So translated it might mean something like \"my brother is great\".</p>\n<p>However, since Chiram was Phoenician, I <a href=\"https://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/8052/the-phoenician-months-mtn-and-plt\">speculated</a> in the past<sup>1</sup> that his name may mean something pagan:</p>\n<p>In his paper \"The Phoenician-Punic Menology\", <em>Boundaries of the Ancient Near Eastern World</em>, pp. 211-221, Robert Stieglitz restored the names of the Phoenician months (see summary table, p. 219 <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/BoundariesOfTheAncientNearEasternWorld/page/n219/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). What's interesting is that almost all of the names of the months have idolatrous meanings. For example, the month of <em>Zevach Shemesh</em> (זבח שמש) means \"sacrifice to the sun\" and the month of <em>Pegarim</em> (פגרם) <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3261427?read-now=1&refreqid=excelsior%3Ab514e20d78c4cc3b232bbaf1fedda286&seq=4#page_scan_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">probably</a> refers to cultic stelae. What's also interesting is that one of the months is called <em>Khir</em> (חיר). Based on this, it would seem that \"Khir\" refers to some idolatrous Phoenician deity, and therefore the name Chiram - חירם - is a contraction of Khir - חיר and Ram - רם. So, we get the following development: חירם < חיררם, with that name meaning \"(the god) Khir is great\".</p>\n<p>With that said, other than what has already been written here on King Chiram, it should be noted that in the later midrash known as \"Aktan de'Mar Yaakov\",<sup>2</sup> Chiram is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Otzar_Midrashim%2C_The_Ten_Exiles%2C_The_Travails_of_R%27_Jacob.7?vhe=Otzar_Midrashim,_New_York,_1915&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentioned</a> as one of a group of ancient sovereigns who converted to Judaism.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> And in greater detail <a href=\"https://tanachthoughts.blogspot.com/2022/07/the-meaning-of-khirams-name.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Which might partially be a modern forgery, a topic I've been researching for the last couple of months now.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why were Nazarites forbidden to touch anything made of grapes, but we make a brocha over wine on Sabbath?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In numbers 6:1-21, there are a number of requirements for somebody who takes a Nazarite vow. Among them are that the Nazarite:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...shall abstain from wine and strong drink: he shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink, neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat fresh grapes or dried. All the days of his Naziriteship shall he eat nothing that is made of the grape-vine, from the pressed grapes even to the grapestone (JPS translation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, today we say a blessing over the wine on Friday evening, again at the synagogue at the end of the service, and Saturday morning after the service.  Furthermore, at the Passover seder, we drink 4 cups of wine.</p>\n<p>When in Jewish history did the grape go from something that was not holy to something that was highly venerated?  What was the process, what was the discussion, that caused the transition?</p>\n<p>And what happened to the Nazarites?  Maybe I've been sleeping under a rock, but I do not recall ever having seen a Nazarite or heard of a Nazarite.  Actually, that's not quite true: Samson was a Nazarite (Judges 13:1).  Wikipedia says that Samuel was a Nazarite, but it isn't clear to me that that was so, because he doesn't make the vow, his mother makes the vow for him.  I'm not sure that counts.  But then Hannah takes some wine for a sacrifice (Samuel 1:24) after Samuel is weaned.</p>\n<p>I think my question is similar to but slightly different from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/45612/why-wine-for-kiddush\">Why wine for kiddush?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The relationships between Nezirut and wine are broadly treated in Gemara and Rishonim.</p>\n\n<p>We will start with Samson, Samuel and touching problem of wine in sacrifices, and later wine of Kiddush and Havdala, for the end we will discuss about wine.</p>\n\n<h3>Samson was a special Nazir:</h3>\n\n<p>The mishna in Nazir (<a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01161.html#HtmpReportNum0001_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1, 2</a>) defines what is nezirut Shimshon, he can never cut hairs, but is allowed to being in touch with death uncleanness (see Bartenura)</p>\n\n<h3>For Shmuel, Machloket in Mishna:</h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>You wrote:</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>Samuel was a Nazarite, but it isn't clear to me that that was so, because he doesn't make the vow, his mother makes the vow for him.</code> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Mishna Nazir (<a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01161.html#HtmpReportNum0059_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">9, 5</a>). According to Rabbi Nehoray, Shmuel was \"Forever's Nazir\" and according to Rabbi Yosse, they discuss on a verse (Shmuel 1, 1, 11). In the mishna above cited, they taught that Forever's Nazir il allowed to cut hairs with a blade every 12 months and is not allowed to be unclean. If he become unclean, he is duty to Korban tum'a as a standard Nazir.</p>\n\n<p>In the discussed verse it seems (Samuel 1, 1, 11), and following the opinion of Rabbi Nehorai, there is an additional question: we see that Chana vowed that her son will be Nazir. It is apparently contradictory with the Mishna which taught in <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01161.html?dyn#HtmpReportNum0029_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4, 6</a> that a mother can not vow nezirut for her son. The Radak ask's this on the verse, Rabi Akiva Eiger on Gemara point this Radak. I have no answer. </p>\n\n<p><strong><em>You wrote:</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>But then Hannah takes some wine for a sacrifice (Samuel 1:24) after Samuel is weaned.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the verse 24, we see that Chana was driving to Bet Hamikdash with Shmuel and with Korbanot. Korbanot contained wine \"ונבל יין\", Rashi itself wrote it \"ונבל יין: לנסך\". See more details about her Korbanot in Ralbag (Shalme Simcha, Menachot, Nesachim).</p>\n\n<p>BTW Korbanot shlamim of the nazir itself need wine for libation.</p>\n\n<h2>Wine of Mitsva:</h2>\n\n<p><strong><em>You wrote:</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>However, today we say a blessing over the wine on Friday evening, again at the synagogue at the end of the service, and Saturday morning after the service. Furthermore, at the passover seder, we drink 4 cups of wine.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See Gemara Nazir 3b-4a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What does R`Simeon make of the statement, 'He shall abstain from wine and strong drink'? - He requires it to prohibit wine the drinking of which is a ritual obligation as well as wine the drinking of which is optional. What is this [wine the drinking of which is obligatory]? The wine of Kiddush and Habdalah, [is it not]? For them he is bound by the oath taken on Mount Sinai? - We must therefore suppose the following dictum of Raba to be indicated, [Viz.:] - [If a man says,] 'I swear to drink [wine]' and later says, 'I wish to a nazirite,' the nazirite vow operates despite the oath.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this Gemara, (and with this choice of lecture), we see that there is no eventuality to exempt nazir from Kiddush and Havdala. Rishonim discuss this Gemara. Rabenu Tam reads the Gemara as follow: \"Wine of Kiddush and Havdala? What is the problem, It is surely not bound for them by the oath taken on Mount Sinai {there are rabbinic commandments}\". So Nazir does not drink Kiddush and 4 glasses of Pesach.  Rambam (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=84174&rid=5835\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">nezirut 7, 11</a>) agrees with Rabenu Tam.</p>\n\n<p>But the commentator in place of Rashi,  (some Acharonim identified him as Rivan) learns the Gemara literally and rules that Nazir drinks Kiddush.This opinion is reported in Tosfoth Rabbi Yehuda Hachassid (Brachoth 20B) in the name of Rabbi Yosef Kara who reports himself rabbi Klonimus from Roma. </p>\n\n<p>for Havdalah and last 3 glasses of Pessach nobody really thinks that they are Deorayta (scriptural).</p>\n\n<h3>Torah and wine</h3>\n\n<p><strong><em>You wrote:</em></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>When in Jewish history did the grape go from something that was not holy to something that was highly venerated? What was the process, what was the\n   discussion, that caused the transition?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>First, abstience from wine \"per se\" is a wrong behavior. See Nazir 19a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For it has been taught: R`Eleazar ha-Kappar, Berabbi, said: Why does the Scripture say, And make atonement for him, for that he sinned by reason of the soul. Against what 'soul' did he then sin? It can only be because he denied himself wine. If then this man who denied himself wine only is termed a sinner, how much more so is this true of one who is ascetic in all things!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But wine is very important in human customs (around Mediterranean See).</p>\n\n<p>See Berachot 35b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why is a difference made for wine? Shall I say that because [the raw material of] it is improved therefore the blessing is different? ... But does wine sustain? Did not Raba use to drink wine on the eve of the Passover in order that he might get an appetite and eat much unleavened bread? - A large quantity gives an appetite, a small quantity sustains. But does it in fact give any sustenance? Is it not written, And wine that maketh glad the heart of man....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wine has a special status, see Berachot 41b-42a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Ben Zoma was asked: Why was it laid down that things which form an integral part of the meal when taken in the course of a meal require no blessing either before or after? - He replied: Because the [blessing over] bread suffices for them. If so, [they said] let the blessing over bread suffice for wine also? - Wine is different, he replied because it is itself a motive for benediction. {Rashi explains that in several ceremonial we bless on wine, despite that our intent was not to drink wine}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But Wine is dangerous:</p>\n\n<p>See the first words of The Gemara Nazir:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seeing that the Tanna is teaching the order Nashim, why does he speak of the nazirite? - The Tanna had in mind the scriptural verse, Then it cometh to pass if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, and he reasons thus. What was the cause of the woman's infidelity? Wine. Further, he proceeds, whosoever sees an unfaithful wife in her degradation will take a nazirite's vow and abjure wine. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>Nazir as a paradigm:</h3>\n\n<p>The relationship between sin and wine is a paradigm of behavior for a Jew as writes the Mesilat Yesharim (chapter 11):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And  our  Sages  of  blessed memory  have  said  (Shemoth  Rabbah  16:2),  \"The  Holy  One  Blessed  be  He  said,  'Do  not  say, \"Since I may not live with a woman, I will hold he r and be free of sin, I will embrace her and be \n  free of sin; or I will kiss her and be free of sin. \" ' The Holy One Blessed be He said, 'Just as when a  Nazarite  takes  a  vow  not  to  drink  wine,  he  is forbidden  to  eat  grapes  or  raisins  or  drink  grape juice, or partake of anything, for that matter, which comes from the grapevine, so is it forbidden to touch any woman but your own wife; and anyone who does touch a woman other than his wife brings  death  to  himself.'  \"  <strong>See  how wonderful these  words  are!  The  prohibition  in  the  case  of illicit relations is likened to that in the case of a Nazarite, where, even though the essence of the prohibition involves only the drinking of wine, the Torah forbids to him anything which has some connection  with  wine.  Through what  it  says  concerning  a  Nazarite,  the  Torah  is  teaching  the Sages  hjw  to  make  \"a  fence  around  the  Torah\"  by  way  of  implementing  the authority  vested  in them to reinforce the Torah's rulings</strong>. Using the case of the Nazarite as a prototype, the Torah is instructing the Sages to proscribe, because of a basic prohibition, anything that is similar to it. To \n  reveal  G-d's  will  in  the  matter,  the  Torah  did  in relation  to  the  mitzvah  of  the  Nazarite  what  it authorized the Sages to do in relation to all the other mitzvoth, namely, to forbid anything which approaches the nature of what is proscribed, by deducing what is not stated from what is stated. By applying this principle to the area of illicit relations, the Sages prohibited anything partaking of  the  nature  of  fornication  or  approaching  it, regardless  of  the  particular  avenue  of  approach, whether that of deed, or sight, or speech, or hearing, or even thought.<br>\n  ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is nothing inherently <em>evil</em> nor <em>holy</em> about wine.</p>\n\n<p>If used properly, it can be elevated to Kiddush Wine and even poured daily on the Altar (may we merit to see that ceremony again soon in our lifetime).</p>\n\n<p>Yet, when misused it can lead to the worst of sins being done out of drunkenness.</p>\n\n<p>A Nazir takes the vow in order to reinforce this fine line; as Chazal teach us: one who sees the Sotah being degraded should take upon himself the vow of a Nazir. One should be so horrified by the suspected adultery that one feels one has to abstain from wine and recalibrate.</p>\n\n<p>During this period he goes to the extreme; even touching anything connected to grapes is forbidden. This is (1) as a safeguard that he doesn't get near wine and (2) to reinforce the (potential) <em>evil nature</em> of the vine.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, a Nazir needs to abstain from haircuts; not because haircuts are evil, since the Cohanim were not allowed to do their Temple Service without a fresh haircut. The Kohen Gadol needed to have a weekly haircut. The king, a daily haircut.</p>\n\n<p>A Nazir sees what happens when you spend too much time preening yourself; it attracts unwanted (and sometimes unwonted) attention. So he goes to the other extreme for 30 days to reinforce the fine line between looking presentable and <em>overdressing</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>This is a recurring theme in Judaism. Many things are forbidden under certain circumstances and yet a Mitzvah under others. E.g.: Wearing a mixture of wool & linen. Marrying your sister-in-law. Killing. Hitting people. And the list goes on.</sup></p>\n\n<h2>Back to your questions:</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When in Jewish history did the grape go from something that was not holy to something that was highly venerated? What was the process, what was the discussion, that caused the transition?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Wine has been used for <em>holy purposes</em> since the Torah was given and sacrifices were instituted.<br/> And they were forbidden to the Nazir from the same time.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And what happened to the Nazarites?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The reason you have never heard of somebody being a Nazir is that nowadays, without the Temple, there is no way to perform the necessary ceremonies to mark the end of the Nazir's vow, so a Nazir would be stuck in a Nazir-state forever. <br/> Though there have been rare individuals who did become a Nazir. One of them is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cohen_(rabbi)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Cohen (1887–1972)</a>, (also known as “Rav Ha-Nazir,” the Nazirite Rabbi) who was a Rabbi, Talmudist, philosopher, kabbalist, and a disciple of Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook. A noted Jewish ascetic, he took a Nazirite vow at the outbreak of World War I.</p>\n\n\n",

Or, is Mamzer status conferred by actual birth only?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You ask: <code>Does lacking a Get affect children before conception, at conception, or at birth?</code></p>\n<h3>The answer is: At conception.</h3>\n<p>The problem of Mamzerut is when conception of a child results from a specific kind of prohibited intercourse between a woman A and a man B: If the punishment for this intercourse is \"Cut-of\" (Caret) or Death (Mishna Yevamot 49a) and when at time of because of the Isur Caret, if B gives Qiddushin to A,  the Qiddushin are invalid \"Ein Qiddushin Tofsin\". (A man with a celibate Nidda doesn't product a Mamzer because he can marry her, \"Qiddushin Tofsin\". Therefore a man with his Nidda wife, does not product Mamzerim (Abaye in Gemara Yevamot 49ab, SA EH 4.13).) This is the case here because A is already married to her husband and can not be \"the property\" of two husbands.</p>\n<p>A question is: Are we sure that the child results from a relationship between A and B and not from a relationship between A and her husband?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>First, if people see that she is still cohabiting with the husband,\nin the same house, it may be that the rule is \"רוב בעילות אחר הבעל\", most of intercourses were with the husband, (Gemara Sota 27a, SA EH 4.15). We rely on most relationships having been with the husband,and the child its the son or the daughter of the husband.</li>\n<li>After the Get; if there is new offspring from the divorced or from the paramour are not Mamzerim (Yevamot 49b, SA EH in Baer Hetev sq 21 in name of the Chelqat Mechoqeq.), because the Isur is only an Isur Ase.</li>\n<li>Secondly, if she does not cohabit with B, but each of them lives alone, it may be that the child is not from B and is perhaps from a non-Jews, and according to Gemara Yevamot 45b (and SA EH 4.19), the child is not Mamzer. I am not sure, but it may be that no Chazaka (halachic assumption) links A to B.</li>\n<li>If A cohabits with B \"as wife and her husband\", the problem of Mamzerut is very strong.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Anyway, the time after which we decide for rules of Mamzer is the time of conception.</p>\n<p>In Mishna, we see many cases of a widow or divorced woman that re-marries immediately after the death of her husband, and gives birth to a child. A doubt appears: Two possibilities.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The child is born 9 months after intercourse with the first husband,</li>\n<li>or 7 months after intercourse with the second.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are the Conservatives and all who practice it considered non-Jews in the eyes of Orthodoxy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>From what I understand, the Orthodox declared all within the German Reform movement as karet, cut off, non-Jews, and they don't recognize any Reform Jew as Jewish to this day.  However, some of these Reform swung to the center to become Conservatives, and so descend from the cut-off Reform.  Therefore, Conservatives aren't considered Jews either.  Is that correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is totally incorrect. Even if a Jew sins sufficiently to merit being punished with karet, he is still a Jew. An example would be those who succumbed to the Spanish in 1492 and converted to christianity but did teshuvah (repented) and managed to escape to Amsterdam.</p>\n\n<p>While it is true that Reform (as a movement) is not Judaism in the eyes of Orthodoxy, those whose mothers are Jewish (according to halacha) are still Jewish and subject to halacha. Of course, most of them nowadays are in the status of \"tinok shenishbah\" (captive infants - never having learned proper behavior) but they are Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Another example is found at <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1269075/jewish/Is-a-Jew-Who-Converts-Still-Jewish.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Is a Jew Who Converts Still Jewish?</a> which explains the matter. The best way to explain it is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even if a non-Jew would marry a Jew with a chupah and a rabbi\n  presiding with all the procedures “by the book,” the marriage does not\n  have the validity of a marriage sanctified in accordance with Jewish\n  law. Saying that “they are considered married” is the best Talmudic\n  language available for “Yes, he is still Jewish.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on the above statement of the Talmud, the Jewish Code of Law4\n  rules that a marriage between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman who\n  “convert out” is completely valid. Therefore, their children are\n  considered Jewish and could also marry other Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

An additional negative mitsva to not be in intercourse with a woman without Kiddushin and Ketuba, in Mishna and Gemara we can study details about know the kinyanim and the amount of the Ketuba, the Get. All this is Mideorayta.</p>\n<p>For source see Sefer Hamitsvot from Rambam and Sefer Hachinuch (But you can study it Mikraot and Chazal), the follow numbers and links are from Sefer Hachinuch:</p>\n<p>Reproduction, --> <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01644_part_1.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a></p>\n<p><strong>The act of getting married</strong>  --> <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01644_part_552.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">552</a></p>\n<p>Not to enter in sexual relationship with a woman without Ketuba and kiddushin, --> <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01644_part_570.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">570</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>But if we read the Chinuch, one statement should be thinking about:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועובר על זה ונשא אשה מבלי שיקדשנה תחילה ביטל עשה זה. ‏</p>\n<p>Whom married a woman without Kiddushin before cancels this positive commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I really wondering, why not speaking about a man do not marry at all? Perhaps because there is no Bitul \"beshav Veal Taasse\".</p>\n<h3>As Nafka Mina</h3>\n<p>We can note that this mitsva applies when old people marry. P.e. <em><strong>An old widower and an old widow</strong></em>, they want to live together, but the couple will not have children. They are duty to rules of kidushin and Ketuba as all young couple.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Similar question (and answer):</h3>\n<p>Perhaps, we can suppose, but I have no proof, that this mitsva is a modaliy. I.E., a way to make something. If a man wants to marry a woman, so the right way is to start with Kiddushin and Ketuba. But if he does not want, no problem.</p>\n<p>I have a partial proof that it is not the case. Rambam in Sefer Hamitsvot Mitsva 96 counted \"Uncleanness of eight Shratsim\", he explain a general rule for its count. A mitsva regarding uncleanness does not mean that we need to be unclean by this uncleanness or that we are prohibited from this uncleanness. The translation of the mitsva is. Whom touch this thing will be unclean as this and this; if this thing touched someone this uncleanness will happened, etc.</p>\n<p>Ramban does not agree and see rules of cleanness-uncleanness as details for mitsvot involved in cleanness-uncleanness. It is similar to the rule to not give Korban with default, the knowledge regarding defaults in not Mitsva but details of this prohibition. Ramban includes this knowledge to the VII principle (not to count details of mitsvot as separated mitsvot).</p>\n<p>Regarding Kiddushin, we can imagine that Tora prohibits many kinds of relationship, see mitsva 570, and the way to avoid this prohibition is kiddushin and ketuba. So, if it was the case, Ramban was not agreeing. But Ramban seems to agree. So definitely this is a mitsva.</p>\n\n\n",

So his advisers recommend that he get someone to play the harp for him to help. One of his advisers recommends that young David:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.18?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">18</a>: וַיַּעַן֩ אֶחָ֨ד מֵהַנְּעָרִ֜ים וַיֹּ֗אמֶר הִנֵּ֨ה רָאִ֜יתִי בֵּ֣ן לְיִשַׁי֮ בֵּ֣ית הַלַּחְמִי֒ יֹדֵ֣עַ נַ֠גֵּן וְגִבּ֨וֹר חַ֜יִל וְאִ֧ישׁ מִלְחָמָ֛ה וּנְב֥וֹן דָּבָ֖ר וְאִ֣ישׁ תֹּ֑אַר וַיהוָ֖ה עִמּֽוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>David is recommended by name and many really nice qualities are attributed to him: brave, man of war, wise, good looking.</p>\n<p>Right away when David comes to Shaul (before he even played any music), Shaul is enamored with David:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.21?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">21</a>: וַיָּבֹ֤א דָוִד֙ אֶל־שָׁא֔וּל וַֽיַּעֲמֹ֖ד לְפָנָ֑יו וַיֶּאֱהָבֵ֣הֽוּ מְאֹ֔ד וַֽיְהִי־ל֖וֹ נֹשֵׂ֥א כֵלִֽים׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It says that Shaul loved David very much and made him his attendant. And then he asks David's father Yishai for permission to keep David by his side, because Shaul favored David very much.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.22?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">22</a>:  וַיִּשְׁלַ֣ח שָׁא֔וּל אֶל־יִשַׁ֖י לֵאמֹ֑ר יַעֲמָד־נָ֤א דָוִד֙ לְפָנַ֔י כִּֽי־מָ֥צָא חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינָֽי׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And David was successful in returning peace to Shaul through his harpistry.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.23?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">23</a>: וְהָיָ֗ה בִּֽהְי֤וֹת רֽוּחַ־אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־שָׁא֔וּל וְלָקַ֥ח דָּוִ֛ד אֶת־הַכִּנּ֖וֹר וְנִגֵּ֣ן בְּיָד֑וֹ וְרָוַ֤ח לְשָׁאוּל֙ וְט֣וֹב ל֔וֹ וְסָ֥רָה מֵעָלָ֖יו ר֥וּחַ הָרָעָֽה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Very nice, right? Seems like Shaul is very close with David, knows who he is, knows who his father is, keeps him close.</p>\n<h3>Now go to the next chapter (Shmuel Alef 17), the story of Goliath</h3>\n<p>David is no longer by the side of Shaul, he is back by his father (how did that happen when he was Shaul's close attendant?). And Shaul goes to Emek haElah to fight the Pelishtim, led by Goliath, who challenges and embarasses the Israelite army. We already have been introduced to David twice in the previous chapter (once when Shmuel annointed him, and once when he is brought to Shaul). Yet, now we are introduced to him again, as if we have never met him:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.17.12?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">12</a>: וְדָוִד֩ בֶּן־אִ֨ישׁ אֶפְרָתִ֜י הַזֶּ֗ה מִבֵּ֥ית לֶ֙חֶם֙ יְהוּדָ֔ה וּשְׁמ֣וֹ יִשַׁ֔י וְל֖וֹ שְׁמֹנָ֣ה בָנִ֑ים וְהָאִישׁ֙ בִּימֵ֣י שָׁא֔וּל זָקֵ֖ן בָּ֥א בַאֲנָשִֽׁים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>David is sent by his father to see how his brothers are doing (the brothers are soldiers int he army, while David, described in the previous chapter as being a brave and strong warrior is not).</p>\n<p>Everyone is frightened of Goliath, refusing to answer his challenge. David calls him an ערל (uncircumcised) in verse <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.17.26?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">26</a>, and when word of this defiance reaches Shaul, David is brought to the king.</p>\n<p>There is an implication of some familiarity between David and Shaul in that they do have a conversation seemingly as equals (David never addresses Shaul as if he were a king), but there is also nothing explicit to this point to show that Shaul knew very well who David was.</p>\n<p>David kills the Philistine, scares their army into mass retreat, and returns with Goliath's head.</p>\n<p>And Shaul asks General Avner (after David speaks with him, when he is going forth to meet Goliath):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.17.55-58?lang=he-en&layout=heRight&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">55</a>: וְכִרְא֨וֹת שָׁא֜וּל אֶת־דָּוִ֗ד יֹצֵא֙ לִקְרַ֣את הַפְּלִשְׁתִּ֔י אָמַ֗ר אֶל־אַבְנֵר֙ שַׂ֣ר הַצָּבָ֔א בֶּן־מִי־זֶ֥ה הַנַּ֖עַר אַבְנֵ֑ר וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְנֵ֔ר חֵֽי־נַפְשְׁךָ֥ הַמֶּ֖לֶךְ אִם־יָדָֽעְתִּי</p>\n<p>56: וַיֹּ֖אמֶר הַמֶּ֑לֶךְ שְׁאַ֣ל אַתָּ֔ה בֶּן־מִי־זֶ֖ה הָעָֽלֶם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Whose son is the youth?</strong></p>\n<p>Really? Shaul doesn't know whose son is the youth? In the previous chapter he sent word to Yishai (David's father) that he was keeping David close, because Shaul loved David so much. And now he doesn't know who David is?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>57: וּכְשׁ֣וּב דָּוִ֗ד מֵֽהַכּוֹת֙ אֶת־הַפְּלִשְׁתִּ֔י וַיִּקַּ֤ח אֹתוֹ֙ אַבְנֵ֔ר וַיְבִאֵ֖הוּ לִפְנֵ֣י שָׁא֑וּל וְרֹ֥אשׁ הַפְּלִשְׁתִּ֖י בְּיָדֽוֹ׃</p>\n<p>58: וַיֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָיו֙ שָׁא֔וּל בֶּן־מִ֥י אַתָּ֖ה הַנָּ֑עַר וַיֹּ֣אמֶר דָּוִ֔ד בֶּֽן־עַבְדְּךָ֥ יִשַׁ֖י בֵּ֥ית הַלַּחְמִֽי׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And dripping head in hand, only David can supply the answer (none of the king's advisors know who David is, even though they recommended him for his superb qualities one chapter before).</p>\n<h2>The question</h2>\n<p>What is going on here?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Are the chapters out of order chronologically (and the events of at least the end of chapter 16 happened after those of chapter 17)? This would seem to make the most sense, since otherwise how do you explain how no one knew who David was in chapter 17. If Goliath happened first (establishing David's reputation among Shaul's advisors), then why are they presented in the order given in the text? And is there any source for saying this?</li>\n<li>If the chapters are chronologically in order, how do we explain the end of chapter 17, when no one knows who David is - not Shaul, not his advisors? Why wouldn't David already be in the army, if he was renowned at this point for being so brave and strong?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(Note: all credit to my brilliant wife for asking the question - I am just the one posting here)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>This is a question asked by many commentators, so your wife is in good company :)</p>\n\n<p>I'll bring four of the above-mentioned commentators here:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%A9%22%D7%99_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%96#.D7.A4.D7.A1.D7.95.D7.A7_.D7.A0.D7.94_.28.D7.9B.D7.9C_.D7.94.D7.A4.D7.A8.D7.A7.29.28.D7.9B.D7.9C_.D7.94.D7.A4.D7.A1.D7.95.D7.A7.29\">Rashi (Samuel 1, 17, 55) (partial)</a></strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכי לא היה מכירו והלא כתיב (לעיל טז כא) ויאהבהו מאד ויהי לו נושא כליו אלא ראהו מתנהג בטכסיסי מלכות אמר שאול אם בא ממשפחת פרץ...‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Saul indeed knew who David was, but since he saw David act \"kingly\" (i.e. the way he spoke going out to fight Goliath, etc.), his question to Avner is about David's ancestry, since now Saul is worried about him becoming king.

So Saul knows who David is, but now wants more information on David's lineage. Later, David answers humbly that they are not of great lineage, but simple servants of the king.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So as you can see, many commentators suggest that indeed Saul knew who David was, but was now asking who's son is he, meaning that he wanted information about David's father and ancestry (whether out of fear for his throne, or to see if he is fit to marry his daughter).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Unlike some of the other commentators mentioned, Ralbag accepts Saul’s question at face value and provides a practical explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבים יתמהו איך יתכן שלא ידע שאול בן מי הוא וכבר סיפר במה שקדם שכבר שלח שאול מלאכים אל ישי שישב בנו דוד עמו וידמה כי המלך לרוב עסקיו ולרוב הבאים לפניו לא יוכל להכיר כל אחד מהם בפרט ויתבאר מתשובת דוד לו ששאילת שאול לא היתה כי אם לדעת מי הוא כדי שיתבאר לו מאיזו משפחה הוא כי כבר הבטיחהו שיתן לו בתו לאשה</p>\n<p>Many have wondered how it is possible that Saul did not know whose son [David] was, when it was already told in what preceded that Saul already sent agents to Jesse that his son David should live with [Saul]. And it seems that the king, on account of his many duties and the many coming before him, was unable to recognize each one individually. And it is clear from David’s answer that Saul’s question was only to ascertain who he was, in order to clarify to [Saul] which family [David] was from, since [Saul] had already promised [David] that he would give him his daughter as a wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>David was younger than imagined when he killed Goliath; likely 15-years-old. Goliath disdained David because David was a \"youth\", a boy. You had to be 20-years-old to enter the army. David had 7 older brothers and 2 sisters. Only 3 of David's brothers were in the army. The 4 other, older brothers were younger than 20 (19, 18, 17, & 16) making David 15. David's sisters might have been older or younger. That said, maybe a family had to only contribute so many sons of age to the army, and the others, even of age, were exempted, so the family did not suffer a total loss. David might have been 10-years-old when he first played the harp for Saul. Goliath likely believed the Israelites were mocking him by sending a boy with no armor, no sword, no visible weapons, but a stick. Thus, Goliath did not put on his helmet or did not put his visor down.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does the torah on injured slaves call out eyes and teeth but not other damages?",
    "content": "# Why does the torah on injured slaves call out eyes and teeth but not other damages?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshat Mishpatim (Sh'mot 21:24-25) the torah tells us that if a man injuries another person he owes compensation: eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, and so on (listing several more).  It then goes on (21:26-27) to talk about when a man injuries his slave, saying that if he damages the slave's eye or knocks out a tooth he must set the slave free on account of the injury.  It singles out eye and tooth but makes no mention of hand, foot, wound, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9882#v=26\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a> why both eye and tooth are needed for the slave case but doesn't talk about other injuries.</p>\n\n<p>Does the injured slave go free on account of a hand or foot too?  These, like the eye and tooth, are permanent injuries.  What about a wound or burn (which might or might not heal to full function)?  If he goes free for any of these too, why does the torah not enumerate all cases like it does in the earlier verse?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps the eye and tooth are seen as lesser damages than the hand and foot, so if a slave would go free for an eye or tooth then surely he would go free for limbs and so the torah does not need to say so.  On the other hand, since the torah <em>could</em> have enumerated all the cases that it intended to cover, maybe it's really only about eyes and teeth.  That seems counter-intuitive to me, but I'd like to find something better than my gut feeling for why other damages should result in freedom too.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rambam (based on <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=25&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 25a</a>) writes (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/c505.htm#6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avadim 5:4</a> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1363811/jewish/Avadim-Chapter-Five.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English</a>)):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיצד בראשי אברים:  המכה את עבדו בכוונה, וחיסרו אחד מעשרים וארבעה אברים שאינן חוזרין--יצא לחירות, וצריך גט שיחרור.  אם כן למה לא נאמר בתורה אלא \"שן\" (שמות כא,כז) ו\"עין\" (שמות כא,כו), לדון מהן:  מה שן ועין, מומין שבגלוי ואינן חוזרין--אף כל מום שבגלוי שאינו חוזר, יצא העבד בו לחירות.‏<br>\n  How is a slave released because of the loss of the tips of his limbs or organs?

See Kiddushin 24b. 13 Midot are not a technical-formal method of lecture, but a way to understand the language of the Torah. Torah pfavors teaching general principles, to give a broad significate by enouncing rules. Chachamim are alway seeking for principles. In the Gemara, you can see how each of the both (tooth and eye) is analyzed in its own properties, in order to take a maximum advantage from each word. examples from Gemara:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>a part of the body that is not replaceable (not milk tooth),</li>\n<li>visible blemish.\n\n<hr></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Because someone objected that the conclusion of Gemara rejected the Ribuy and Myut, I quoted below some statements from the Pne Yehoshua.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>.. והוה ליה להקשות כיון דישלחנו ריבויה הוא, מינא ליה למיעוטי מומין שבסתר? אלא על כרחך דהוי ידע שפיר דממעטינן משן ועין מומין שבסתר אלא דקשיא לי מנא לן למיעוטי נמי סופה לחזור? דהא מריבויא דישלחנו איכא לריבויי הכל! וממיעוטא דשן ועין לא שייך למעט אלא מאי דלא דמי לגמרי והיינו מומין שבסתר. ועל זה משני שפיר אם כן שן ועין מאי אהני ליה?! פירוש, כיון דאיכא תרי מיעוטי, אם כן מחדא ממעטינן מומין שבסתר, ואידך למיעוטי סופה לחזור וממנה ממעט נמי שן דחלב. כן נראה לי נכון.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, the Gemara first was thinking that it's a binyan available from 2 ktuvim, next aklal ufrat uklal, and finally Ribuy and Myut. </p>\n\n<p>The chiddush here is that we have a double Myut before the Ribuy. When there is only one Myut, here, there are two Myutin. And each of them excludes one thing from the \"riba hakol\".</p>\n\n<p>See Yavin Shemua klal 133.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד כלל אחר שכתבו התוספות ז''ל פרק קמא דשבועות  דיבור המתחיל רבי עקיבא דמחייב וזה לשונם,<br>\n  ויש לומר שאפילו מאן דדריש ריבויי ומיעוטי כי איכא תרי מיעוטי\n  מוקמינן חד למיעוטי שטרות וחד למיעוטי קרקעות, כוונתן דאפילו דלמאן דדריש ריבה ומיעט וריבה ריבה הכל ולא מיעט אלא דבר אחד שאינו דומה\n  שאינו דומה היינו כי ליכא אלא מיעוט אחד אבל כי איכא תרי מיעוטי ממעטינן טפי....‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now we can understand the Gemara Kiddushin 24b</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ריבויא הוא ואי ריבויא הוא אפי' הכהו על ידו וצמתה וסופה לחזור נמי אלמה תניא גהכהו על ידו וצמתה וסופה לחזור אין עבד יוצא בה לחירות א\"כ שן ועין מאי אהני ליה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara says that the law (that extends tooth and eye to organs irreversibly dammaged and that are visible) is deducted by Ribuy. The Gemara objects that if the drasha is Ribuy a replaceable organ or a treatable dammage are included in this law. The Gemara answers by astonishment: So, why is there two Myutin, tooth and eye?! This is not a rejection of the pshat of Ribuy, but a clarification of the rule, as Pne Yehoshua explained.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Wall ball in the Talmud\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Sanhedrin (77b) the gemara discusses a case of \"Wall Ball\" throwing a ball at a wall, the ball bouces back and if the other player catches the ball, he tries to peg the original thrower (Rashi). \nThe case the gemara brings down is one where the original thrower threw the ball and it ended up killing the second player. (Note although it may be able to implied, the gemara doesn't out right say the ball bounced off the wall and killed the second player).  The gemara goes on to say, within 4 amot your פטור past 4 and your חייב (Rashi says 4 amot from the wall, note: the gemara doesn't specify what your חייב and פטור)</p>\n\n<p>I'm curious if anyone can elaborate on what exactly wall ball was (what kinda ball..etc) anything that could help clear up this case. \nAlthough the gemara mentions later on that the reason 4 amot is significant is because people try to get the ball past 4 amot, in a case where one is trying to kill his opponent, he will purposely aim for him off the wall and so why then is 4 amot significant? He should be חייב regardless </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This question is very interesting, this Gemara can be read in diverse ways.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>First the wall ball: See Wikipedia <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basque_pelota\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link</a> and for pictures of the ball see the topic in French language.</li>\n<li>The Gemara itself is not very easy to read, Rashi itself provide two pshatim.  Rashi choosen in its first explanation, to read the Gemara as following, there was discussed in term of Galut, i.e. the punishment for a Shogeg killer. Rashi explain, following Gemara Maccot 7b that for exile punishment, case where he tried to throwing the ball at 2 cubits and he throws at 4 cubits will not be affected by this rule. The act need to be succesfull but without intent to kill.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So, the Gemara said: If he kills at a distance of less than 4 cubits from the wall --> no Galut, more than 4 cubits --> Galut. Why? because a player want to throw the ball strongly in way to launch it as far as possible. So, obviously he wanted to launch it more than 4 cubits after the wall.</p>\n\n<p>A second pshat in Rashi talk about an intentional killer. and death penalty after witnesses cautioned it. The Girsa for this pshat is Lo Tsricha bestam, i.e. The umdena is this that he want to reach with the ball an distance of 4 cubits. So we look at the man killed near to the wall as an accidentally killed. Second explanation: the caution was not to launch 4 cubits after the wall because the killing risk. and he killed a man that was near the wall.</p>\n\n<p>According to the first explanation, the 4 cubits are significants, but not toward the intent of killing.</p>\n\n<p>Your question is relevant for the second explanation and is very similar (or identical) to the first Kashia of Tosfot. The explanation I provided above comes from Yad Rama (see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43550&st=&pgnum=560\" rel=\"nofollow\">right top</a>) and Rabbi David Bonfils (2nd paragraph on left column)</p>\n\n\n",

Sometimes we meet a non-jew and befriend him because he shares the same values that we do.</p>\n\n<p>Is one allowed to befriend a non-Jew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>@Aaron: Yes, there is a negative commandment to contradict it.</p>\n\n<p>The Passuk says (Devarim 7:2) \"lo sechaneim (לא תחנם).\" The Gemara (Avodah Zarah 20a) gives three translations: \"do not give them occupation in the land (לא תתן להם חנייה),\" \"do not grant them favor (לא תתן להם חן),\" and \"do not give them free gifts (לא תתן להם מתנת חנם).\" </p>\n\n<p>The translation I'd like to focus on is the second one, not to grant them favor. The Gemara in Erchin (14a), in the process of its discussion regarding the Tanna of the Mishnah, brings down the ruling of Rav Yehudah in the name of Rav, that one is not allowed to say how wonderful a non-Jew is. Rashi says that the above passuk from Devarim, according to the second translation of the Gemara in Avodah Zarah, is his source.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, it may very well be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, there's also an Issur against a Chillul Hashem. Turning down another's efforts to befriend you might be considered a Chillul Hashem. Perhaps one could reconcile the two sources by saying that although the first Issur says that you can't go out of your way to befriend him, the second Issur would obligate you to befriend him if and only if he approaches you first. (It's perhaps for this reason that there are <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/36297/is-praising-non-jews-actually-prohibited?rq=1\">leniencies regarding the Issur of Lo Sechaneim</a>. Please note that I'm not a Rav; I'm just giving what I feel is a logical reason that may very well be entirely wrong.)</p>\n\n<p>As for your passuk, the Mefarshim seem to equate that positive Mitzvah with the negative one written in Shemos 22:20 - \"a geir do not insult and do not oppress, for you were geirim in Mitzraim.\" Although I haven't gone in-depth on your passuk, the Mishnah in Bava Metzia (58b, and Gemara there) deals with the prohibition carried by the passuk in Shemos, and it clearly holds it's referring to converts: \"If a person is a child of converts, don't tell him, 'Remember the deeds of your forefathers,' as the passuk says, 'a convert do not insult and do not oppress.'\"</p>\n\n<p>As for your problem with the second half of the passuk, don't worry; you're not the first to have posed that issue. Rashi to that passuk in Shemos says, \"If you \ninsult him, he's able to insult you and say to you, also you came from converts; any blemishes you have, don't say about your friend. Any use of 'geir' [refers to] a person who was not born there, but rather came there from somewhere else to live there.\" So although you're right in interpreting the second half of the passuk as referring to a stranger, not a convert, the Gemara still interprets the first half, the actual prohibition, as referring to converts. Thus, the geir's response would be: \"You're insulting me because I'm spiritually a stranger? You guys were physically strangers back in Mitzraim!\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> In Kiddushin (68a), the Gemara, attempting to find a source that Kiddushin doesn't take effect between a Jew and a non-Jew, settles on the passuk of \"lo sischanein bam,\" do not marry them (Devarim 7:3). Rashi doesn't seem to have an issue with equating the Seven Nations, of whom the passuk is speaking, and other non-Jewish nations. Tosfos, however, take issue with this point, and thus they answer that since the passuk concludes \"do not give your sons to their daughters or take their daughters for your sons,\" we can learn two things, since the remainder of the passuk is extraneous. (Tosfos later point out that ultimately we learn it from a different passuk; this entire discussion is in the Gemara's Hava Aminah.)</p>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, our passuk, too, should be able to be applied to all non-Jews. According to Tosfos, though, how can we include the Seven Nations in the prohibition of lo sechaneim?</p>\n\n<p>Funny you should ask. I didn't see this the first time through, but Tosfos actually address this question in their comments to the Gemara in Avodah Zarah. He says that by any Mitzvah that you could theoretically come up with a reason that they should only apply to the Seven Nations (beyond the fact that the Seven Nations are written in the passuk) you need a special inclusion for other nations.

    "content": "# When does a kosher place need a mashgiach temidi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I notice that some kosher places have a mashgiach (kashrut inspector) that vsists the place occasionally. Others have someone there permanently.</p>\n\n<p>What criteria is used to decide if a place needs a mashgiach temidi?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Given that many operations require complete knowledge and supervision of the processing, then a mashgiach would need to be present whenever ingredients are brought in to the plant and would have to be able to inspect the invoices as well as the ingredients.  Since a restaurant has constant production, then it would need a mashgiach tmidi (though there may be circumstances in which the owner might be trusted as a mashgiach tmidi) in order to avoid problems.</p>\n\n<p>There is a story in which a hotel color coded its utensils blue (dairy) or red (meat) with spray paint on the handle. A mashgiach managed to stop one of the workers from (innocently) respraying some silverware when they needed some more. It was not a deliberate attempt to cheat, the worker just did not realize that it was not the color that was significant.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the Star-K explains what is involved with fish fish <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/1115/the-tell-tail-sign/\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Tell Tail Sign</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The great posek Hador, R’ Moshe Feinstein, tz”l, writes in his\n  responsa that the proper way to given kosher certification to fish\n  productions is for the mashgiach to see every fish. Therefore, Star-K\n  certified salmon, as well as all other fish varieties, have a\n  mashigiach t’midi who examines every fish during production.</p>\n  \n  <p>The mashgiach has to position himself strategically in order to be\n  able to see all the fish before the skin is removed. Having the\n  workers check each fish individually is not sufficient. The mashgiach\n  must set up a system which ensures that each fish is inspected by him.</p>\n  \n  <p>To meet the requirements of bishul Yisroel, the mashgiach puts on the\n  steam after the fish has been rolled into a cold oven.</p>\n  \n  <p>After cooking, the mashgiach must be present for the canning and\n  labeling. In addition to the can code, a specific kosher code is added\n  as a siman (sign) that the fish was produced and canned in the\n  presence of a Star-K mashgiach. The producer’s labels, complete with\n  the certification symbol, have to be in the possession of the\n  mashgiach so that they would not be inadvertently used for a\n  non-supervised run.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Every kashrut authority has their own criteria as to which places need a mashgiach temidi. For example, they may decide that if the owner him/herself is Shomer Shabbos they can be trusted and a yotzei v'nichnas (mashgiach who comes every so often) is enough. Or that the type of establishment determines e.g. a restaurant might need one, but a bakery might not (the mashgiach comes every few hours to sift the flour and take challa etc.). \nThis might be a reason to prefer or not rely on a particular kashrus organization - if they are more willing to give kashrus certification without a mashgiach temidi.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can one use a different date system at the beginning of the Ketubah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The following is an excerpt in English translation from the beginning of a traditional Orthodox and Conservative ketubah taken from <a href=\"http://www.modernketubah.com/ketubah_translation.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this site</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the ______day of the week, the _________day of the month ______ in\nthe year five thousand seven hundred and ______ <strong>since the creation of\nthe world</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The bolded phrase is what is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Anno Mundi</a> which assigns the number of years from the creation of the world. This phrasing seems to be the most common usage in ketubot.</p>\n<p>However, would it be legal (a valid ketubah) if someone decided to use a different system of counting? For example, instead of listing the Anno Mundi year, which is currently 5776, someone used the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Hebrew_year\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machzor kattan</a> counting. For this year it would be the 19th year of the 304th cycle (based on the 19 year Metonic cycle that is used for positioning Judaic leap years). Or what about if they used the secular date (2016)?</p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> If using the Gregorian date (or Julian, as well), the entire date would need to be changed to a transliterated form that would correspond to say, \"June 7, 2016\". (Transliteration is already commonly used in the ketubah when mentioning the town / city name.)\nYou would also eliminate the \"creation of the world\" phrase and substitute, perhaps, (AD or CE)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The answer is probably maybe.</p>\n\n<p>In reality there used to be varying methods of dating Kethuboth. When the Cairo Genizah was discovered, they found many Kethboth there of great value. They found kethuboth written in Hebrew, rather than Aramaic, and they found Kethuboth of various dating systems. The system I liked the most was \"year such and such of the common year.\" However, it isn't known how often that terminology was used, so I can't comment on whether or not it would still be considered valid.</p>\n\n<p>But there was another dating system that was commonly used and is still being used (though now starting to  die out) today in certain Mizrahi communities. The dating system called <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13401-seleucidae\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"מנין שטרות\"</a> which is a date from the Seleucid Empire. This dating method is still being used by Yemenites, and it was the dating system I used for my Kethubbah.</p>\n\n<p>So why did i begin my answer with \"probably maybe\"? Because there should be no issue using another dating system that has been used continuously for thousands of years and is still being practice by Jews. So yes, it's probable that you can use another dating system, as there is one available, and even more systems have been used in the past. However, your personal Rav may not have heard of this system, or he may object to using it as it \"isn't our minhag.\" And then even if he says yes, and you draft the Kethubbah, there is still another issue. The witnesses (who themselves may have a different Rav) might balk at your Kethubbah being different from their idea on what it should be. And so if you are unable to find witnesses willing to sign it, your Kethubbah may be worthless. So therefore, maybe you will be successful in using an alternative system, maybe you won't. Which is why the answer is, probably maybe.</p>\n\n\n",

The article does not provide an explanation of the violation of halacha other than it not being the accepted norm.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are a number of things wrong with this.</p>\n<p>First, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/65950/759\">the traditional practice</a> is to have the same person recite all the blessings. Even if there was some sort of pressing circumstance here, it's hard to see why the couple themselves would need to do this to avoid family fighting or whatever.</p>\n<p>Second, R Avraham ben HaRambam <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22726&st=&pgnum=7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> that a groom should not recite his own Sheva Berakhot, and reports that his father, the Rambam, got angry (\"כעס\") at a groom who recited them for himself. Indeed while many classical works don't explicitly forbid the practice, they all make it sound like someone else is saying the blessings. Even the Talmud's examples (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.8a.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubbot 8a</a>) are of someone else saying them. The Arukh haShulchan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Even_HaEzer.62.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 62:9</a>) rules this way, as does Minchat Yitzchak (3:114) and others. Moreover, the Rama (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%93_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">EH 34:1</a>) rules that even Birkat Eirusin is said by someone else (as explained by the Perisha) so as not to embarrass someone who doesn't know how to say the blessing. It seems obvious that he would feel that way here, had he ever thought someone might do something like this. (Some are lenient and allow the groom to recite the Sheva Berakhot for himself if no one is around who knows how.)</p>\n<p>Finally, it's obviously incorrect to have two people saying the blessing at once. One of them is by definition saying an unnecessary blessing, and, in accordance with the rule that multiple voices can't be heard (תרי קלי), the blessings aren't being heard by a Minyan, rendering them both Levatalla.</p>\n<p>This is all in addition to the fact that a woman might not be able to say the Sheva Berakhot (<a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/vbm/english/archive/halak67/15halak.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20024&st=&pgnum=96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

His response surprised me. He said the following:</p>\n\n<p>\"For better or worse, it was a non-Jew who first discovered the principles governing the ta'ame ha-miqra. His name was William Wickes. Here is a link to his book:</p>\n\n<p>\"<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=dQEomb49VWgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wickes+Two+Treatises+on+the+Accentuation+of+the+Old+Testament&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVzuCxxJbNAhWBkywKHUQVAqUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=wickes%20Two%20Treatises%20on%20the%20Accentuation%20of%20the%20Old%20Testament&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://books.google.com/books?id=dQEomb49VWgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=wickes+Two+Treatises+on+the+Accentuation+of+the+Old+Testament&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiVzuCxxJbNAhWBkywKHUQVAqUQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=wickes%20Two%20Treatises%20on%20the%20Accentuation%20of%20the%20Old%20Testament&f=false</a></p>\n\n<p>Since Wickes wrote his book in the 19th century, there has been some progress in the field. The best recent, comprehensive book on the subject is by Mordechai Breuer in Hebrew: טעמי המקרא. The second edition of this book is still in print.</p>\n\n<p>Since Wickes is in English, you might find it easier to deal with. The amount of additional material in Breuer is small.\"</p>\n\n<p>As someone who often has an academic approach to Judaism, the answer isn't problematic for me. But I was still surprised by it. Can anyone shed light on whether Jews were really ignorant of the principles governing the te'amim until Wickes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>No, he didn't discover it. <a href=\"http://menachemmendel.net/blog/who-was-william-wickes/\">Wickes lived 1817-1903 with his seminal works on cantillation being published in the 1880s.</a></p>\n\n<p>Plenty of Jewish works on cantillation exist before that, such as <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/7218\">Mishpetei Taamim</a>, 1808, R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Heidenheim\">Wolf Heidenheim</a>, back to works by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_ben_Moses_ben_Asher\">Ben Asher</a> and <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9D\">Yehuda Ibn Bilam</a> around 1000 years ago. Rabbeinu Tam wrote a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6507&st=&pgnum=75&hilite=\">long cryptic poem</a> about the rules of cantillation.</p>\n\n<p>I can't say there isn't some rule or pattern that Wickes documented explicitly for the first time, but much of what he wrote is built on previous works. It's not like he sat down with the text of Tanakh and cracked the code from scratch.</p>\n\n<p>Wickes's work is wonderfully thorough and systematic, and has set the <em>tone</em> for much if not all modern study of cantillation. (Reading medieval grammatical works with Wickes's system in your head is a bit like a modern mathematician reading medieval math proofs: it's there, but the terminology and set-up feels off.) It's an important work and a good resource. But a \"discovery\"? Not quite.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm surmising that saffron was one of the oldest spices known according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saffron\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia</a>. Historically, it was one of the most expensive seasonings known (still is). Perhaps, in accordance with a concept of \"hiddur\" of doing something special, unique and nice for Yom Tov, (similar to the idea of buying a nicer more expensive meat esp. for Yom Tov) they decided to use saffron vs. other fragrant spices.</p>\n\n<p>The Wikipedia article states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Saffron's aroma is often described by connoisseurs as reminiscent of\n  metallic honey with grassy or hay-like notes</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Earlier in the same Kol Bo column, he states that it is customary to eat milk and honey. I've never baked matzot, but I assume that if one did, it wouldn't come out like matzot as the honey has a lot of weight. I can say that baking honey in bread drastically changes its consistency. So, I assume that to get the honey-like taste into the matzot, they found saffron to be a good substitute.</p>\n\n\n",

Wheat is one of the grains from which Passover matzoh can be made. Normally matzoh is baked at high heat from flour and water only, then reground to create matzoh flour or matzoh meal as a source for products kosher for Passover use such as cake or deep-fry breading. Semolina is typically a hard flour not suited for bread at all, leavened or unleavened, and Italian pasta is made only from semolina flour and from water. Used semolina pasta can typically be reground after drying to make semolina pasta again, it is not as good but it is still usable as such.  Is is a legal usage to create a matzoh from water and flour, from a grain that is legal (wheat) but inedible (durum) for bread, but which can then be a kosher for Passover source of Italian pasta?  Or, does the fact that the motzah is inedible and never meant for direct consumption for Passover use invalidate the use (appearance of sin, as matzoh is 'bread of affliction' and any other usage too luxurious)?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If Hell is paused on Shabbos, what time-zone do they pick?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This might seem as a naive question: If Hell is paused on Shabbos, what time-zone do they pick? Since there is a gate in Jerusalem, would it be it Israel time? If so Hell is not paused while Shabbos is being kept in other time-zones. Vice-versa if Hell is paused for the entirety of shabbos everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>My assumption is that there is no regard for time-zones anywhere in the pre-Rishonim interpretation of the Torah (Zohar being anachronistic and belongs after the Rishonim). The reason is the \"gates in the firmament\" worldview from where the sun comes out simultaneously to all the earth. The earth being flat -resting on the Yam HaHadol (the lower waters)- and the firmament stretched from east to west, holding the higher waters.</p>\n\n<p>I'm observant myself, I don't want to come out as condescending.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The rabbis knew that the Earth was curved during the time of the gemara. They also knew about time zones and the effect that it had. The usages of the gates was a metaphorical reference. They could tell it was curved because they could (as an example) see how sailing ships dropped \"below the horizon. When dealing with times that would have a different halacha in any particular area (such as when Shabbas starts or what time to daven) they use local solar time. </p>\n\n<p>When dealing with a conceptual matter that can only occur once, they would use Yerushalaim time as that is the central location for <em>Hashem's presence</em> as I explain below. Since Gehinnom is a conceptual situation rather than a fixed location, the time in Yerushalaim is used, as explained below.</p>\n\n<p>Note that in the discussion of makas bechoros the question is asked \"Why did Moshe Rabbeinu say <em>about midnight</em> when Hashem said <em>at midnight</em>. While there are other answers, one of them is that Hashem has set the \"reference time\" to Yerushalaim.  As an example we see</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ohr.edu/qa/5759/shmos/bo.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Bo 11:14</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hashem's 'clock' is set to Jerusalem. The plague of the first-born\n  took place at exactly midnight, Jerusalem time. But because Egypt is\n  west of Jerusalem, midnight there occurs later. When Moshe said the\n  plague would be at 'approximately midnight,' he was referring to\n  local, Egyptian time.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Kehillas Yitzchak; thanks to Rabbi Sholem Fishbane)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even though this explanation may have been given later, it is an explanation of why Moshe Rabbeinu said \"about\". That is, it is stating that Moshe Rabbeinu knew about time zones and the effect that they had.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, when we announce the Molad for Birchas Hachodesh, we announce it according to Yerushalaim Solar Time and not the clock time of that time zone (which is 21 minutes later).</p>\n\n<p>Of course, the statement of relief from Gehinnom is a conceptual one, but this is the basis for  that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The soul of deceased is still linked to those of it's mourners, and the \"rest\" gehinom it gets on Shabbat parallels the time the mourners rest on the Shabbat (beause of this you have the custom of delaying Havdalah to give the deceased more \"time off\")</p>\n\n<p>Hell is not a physical place.

    "content": "# When Gut feeling and supposed Knowledge conflict\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a kid who started doing daf yomi and feels that through the daf he gains skills,  confidence, knowledge, consistency and most of all a sense of accomplishment. His rabbi tells him one day he should stop doing the daf since he is in yeshiva and should focus all of his time on what the Yeshiva is learning (daf takes him 2 hours).\nAs much has the kid respects his rabbi, he deeply feels that doing the daf is the right course of action for himself.</p>\n\n<p>Although this seems like a specific case, it really can be applied to many different aspects of life. (Rabbi - Talmid, Parent - Child, ...etc)</p>\n\n<p>There's <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.83a\" rel=\"nofollow\">a gemara</a> that deals with a case of a patient and a doctor. The patient believes he/she needs medicine where the doctor does not. The gemara says that we listen to the patient because the patient knows in his heart a feeling that the doctor would never be able to understand. The Gemara says the opposite is true as well (doctor says he needs medicine , he must take medicine) but that is not a chiddush.\nThe point being, although the rabbi in the first case thinks daf yomi is not right for the student, should the student listen or, because he feels that it's important, trust himself? </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, are there other sources that deal with this concept (knowledgeable vs. less knowledgeable) with conflicting thoughts, whom do we listen to?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Respectfully, how can a Rosh Yeshiva tell a talmid what to not learn?</p>\n\n<p>If the talmid's learning is not disturbing other bochurim what right does the Rosh Yeshiva have to stop him learning be'makom shelibo chafetz?</p>\n\n<p>Cookie cutter yeshivos do not turn out talmidei chachamim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I suppose that the Rabbi takes a such decision because of specific reasons. Perhaps  the Talmid does not learn successfully the Yeshiva Programm. The Rabbi did not write an Halacha \"Daf Hayomi is forbidden for Talmid Yeshiva!\". Probably,  this studentl does not understand the real motivations of his Rabbi.</p>\n<p>The Gemara you mentions regards Yom Kippur, Chilul Shabbat and I can not quote it today. In some cases the conflict is between the ill man and the non-specialist doctor and in other cases with the specialist. One of the concepts is Lev yodea Marat Nafsho (one person can feel the severity of his situation).</p>\n<p>The question seem's to say that this Rabbi does not understand the student. It is not impossible , may be that the student want or need to change Rabbi. But if the student is convinced that this rabbi is the right Rabbi, he may ask again and explain himself or ask for additional explanation. May be that for an other student, the Rabbi would agree to this  that  studying Daf Hayomi is a good idea for one period. The student is not married with the Yeshiva and can look for an other Yeshiva. But when he study in a Yeshiva he have a responsibility and can not feel free. The fact that he learns Daf Hayomi in the full light of the day, generates perhaps  a damage for the Yeshiva. The Rosh Yeshiva is the boss of the yeshiva. He can decide that in this Yeshiva one cannot study daf hayomi or yerushalmi,  he can promote an homogeneous learning for  chizuk. Yeshiva is generally  not a democratic institution.</p>\n<h3>Summary:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>The Rosh Yeshiva decides what the student need to learn, if the Rosh Yeshiva is right or not is an other question.</li>\n<li>The problem of a bachur who learns Daf Hayomi may be a problem for the bachur himself, because wasting time needed for Yeshiva program, or because this will lead other students to learn Daf Yomi and to leave the program.</li>\n<li>In Yeshivot they learn in way to develop the learning ability of the student and to learn Daf Hayomi is not the same kind of training. Perhaps is it not helpfull for the student.</li>\n<li>Each student must choose his Yeshiva and his Rav. Sometimes it is possible to change.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>I remember a Gemara in perek  Hashoel,  which does not provide an answer but may enlightening the relationship between Rabbi and students regarding the choice of the masechet,  Baba Metsia 97a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמרו ליה רבנן לרבא שאיל לן מר אקפיד אמר להו לאפקועי ממונאי קא בעיתו אדרבה אתון שאילתון לי דאילו אנא מצי אישתמוטי לכו ממסכתא למסכתא אתון לא מציתו לאישתמוטי ולא היא איהו שאיל להו ביומא דכלה אינהו שאילו ליה</p>\n<p>The scholars said to Raba: 'You, Master, are loaned to us.' This enraged him: 'You wish to deprive me of my possessions!' he exclaimed.'\nOn the contrary, you are loaned to me! For I can change you over from one tractate to another, whilst you cannot!' But neither was entirely correct.\nHe was lent to them during the Kallah days, whilst they were loaned to him for the rest of the year.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the right way is to follow the choices of the Rabbi for the choice of the masechet, excepted for the periods in which the rav needs to teach special  halachot, before regalim (Rashi).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The student should focus on learning what the Yeshiva is learning. Visalmud Torah Keneged Kulam - And the study of Torah is equivalent to them all (Peah 1:1).</p>\n\n<p>All of Torah study is equal. A person should only learn Torah because it is a Mitzvah, and he loves doing Mitzvos, because it shows how much he loves  Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>In Nefesh Shimshon, Attainment of Torah, Rabbi Shimshon Dovid Pincus relates that he once meant a Kollel man who said that he couldn't stay with the same subject, and halfway through morning Seder, he would switch from Maseches Gittin to Maseches Brachos. Rabbi Pincus told him he'd be better off if he worked for the second half of morning Seder, that way he'd be exempt from Torah study and would make a Parnassah, but if he kept switching from topic to topic he wouldn't get anywhere.\nI highly recommend buying Rabbi Pincus's book here: <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/nefesh-shimshon-attainment-of-torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.feldheim.com/nefesh-shimshon-attainment-of-torah.html</a></p>\n\n<p>It would seem strange to Daven Shemoneh Esrei, then the last paragraph of Shema, then a few lines of Ah'rei, then Aleinu, then Birchos HaShachar, wouldn't it? The same is with Torah study.</p>\n\n<p>They say that during Davening, you're talking to Hashem, but during Torah study, Hashem is talking to you.</p>\n\n<p>Could you imagine having a conversation where the other person just jumped from topic to topic at random? It would never work!</p>\n\n<p>It's also safe to assume that the Rabbi who told the Bachur this knows what he's talking about, as he has many more years of life experience and Torah knowledge. The Bachur should try to trust that the Rabbi knows what he's talking about.</p>\n\n<p>The Yeshiva Bachur should try to learn what the rest of the Yeshiva is learning. Although it might be hard, if he really puts his all into it, he will have b’syata d’shmaya, and the Torah will only become sweeter for him.</p>\n\n<p>They say the Chazon Ish once spent 15 hours a day, every day, for 3 months, learning a single Mishnah. He worked as hard as he could do that he could squeeze every drop out of that Mishnah. This couldn't have been done if the Chazon Ish learned a little bit of the Mishnah, then went to Mishnah Yomi, then back to the Mishnah, then a little Daf Yomi, then back to the Mishnah, etc. It could only be done with clear, constant study on that one Mishnah.</p>\n\n\n",

They are trained to consider all of the factors of a matter. What might seem to you like an applicable case in the <em>Shulkhan Arukh</em> may very well not actually apply to your situation for some reason that you had not considered. It might also be the case that the particular <em>sefer</em> you are reading does not represent today's commonly accepted opinion for this particular issue. Unless you are trained in giving <em>psak</em> yourself, you should go to your rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>While your rabbi should always be the person who has the final word, your other two suggestions (looking it up in the <em>halakhic</em> literature and finding out your family's custom) are very important steps to take.</p>\n\n<p>If you research the issue before approaching your rabbi, you can tell him what you have found. This will allow him to address your particular concerns. He can also explain why he might rule contrary to the source you've read. You asked about the case where the source you read makes more sense to you than your rabbi's ruling; if you bring that source to your rabbi, he can explain to you why he is ruling differently from your source. Just because it seems reasonable to you does not mean that it's correct or the normative <em>halakha</em> (especially if you haven't read the opposing arguments).</p>\n\n<p>Family customs are also important. Your rabbi will be able to tell you <em>how</em> important they are. If a cursory attempt to determine your family's custom fails, you can tell <em>that</em> to your rabbi. He will be able to tell you whether you need to dig more deeply into your family's history or whether such research is not necessary.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Audio Recording on Shabbat/Yom Tov\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Would there be a problem with leaving a recorder on from before Shabbat or Yom Tov, and thereby recording a lecture given on Shabbat itself? There is a wealth of literature on the subject of Melacha that extends into Shabbat, but I haven't found this particular issue addressed.\nI have also heard from reliable sources that R' Shlomo Zalman permitted this, but I have yet to find this source inside. \nCan anyone give me some direction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Recording on shabbat is linked to use of microphones on Shabbat (since you require microphones to record). It might be in this context that you heard R Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (RSZA) being quoted since he wrote on that topic.</p>\n\n<p>R Yisrael Rozen from <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zomet</a> (an Israeli institute that creates IT equipment and electronic appliances designed to meet Halakha) has a <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=198&ArticleID=283#b4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">long article</a> where he quotes RSZA</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The following is an excerpt from a an article by RSZA in 5706 (1945-6) on the\n  subject of radio broadcasts on Shabbat and Yom Tov. In it, he raises\n  all the relevant problems regarding electricity on Shabbat, and\n  rejects them one by one.</p>\n  \n  <p>[These prohibitions] apply only to creating or breaking a circuit in a\n  fan, refrigerator, etc. However, when one speaks into the microphone\n  of a radio, no sparks are created, since the manufacturers [of the\n  microphone] are very careful to avoid this. Therefore, even if there\n  is a malfunction and a spark is created, no transgression is committed\n  since it is merely a davar she-eino mitkaven (an unintended result).\n  Thus, when one speaks into a [broadcast] microphone on Shabbat, he\n  does not cause an act of lighting or extinguishing [a flame], or any\n  other forbidden melacha. Rather, the speaker merely causes a change in\n  current which affects the radio waves being broadcast, such that the\n  membrane of the radio receiver vibrates in accordance with the sound\n  waves of the speaker. It would therefore seem that there is no need\n  whatsoever to be concerned with the problems of makkeh b’patish,\n  tikkun mana, or molid, since his speech does not cause any Shabbat\n  prohibition to be violated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However further on (section 4) R Rozen writes <strong>Rav Auerbach leans towards prohibiting microphones</strong> (see there for details).</p>\n\n<p>On the Igrot Moshe cited in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/92083/11501\">another answer</a> on this page R Rozen writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have not merited to understand Rav Feinstein’s reasoning here, and\n  he himself wrote that the matter was not entirely clear to him. It is\n  true that speech affects the strength of the current in the\n  microphone, and particularly in the amplifier, but this is merely a\n  change in the current, not the creation of one. There is no closing of\n  a circuit involved, nor any hav’ara, nor completion of a task, nor any\n  lasting impression; I therefore see no room for his suspicions.\n  Furthermore, we will later quote from Rav Feinstein’s own ruling on\n  hearing aids, where he states that the suspicions of a prohibition are\n  unclear, and therefore in cases of great need may be permissible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Many <em>poskim</em> forbid the use of microphones on Shabbat, i.e., <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-17-03/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Eliezer Melamed</a> (partly because of <em>marit ayin</em>) even if Zomet and others believe it is permissible. For more sources see also <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Shabbat-microphones-catching-on-among-orthodox-despite-taboos-402173\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://text.rcarabbis.org/from-our-archives-may-one-use-a-microphone-on-shabbat/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recording is even more complex since part of the reason to permit microphones is the great need from some to hear - and that need might not exist when recording audio.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is forbidden to speak into a tape recorder even if the recorder was turned on before Shabbat </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Igrot Moshe OC 3:55 forbade recording a shiur on Shabbat or the like since speaking into it might cause the voltage to increase in the circuit and also it might be considered molid to have something new introduced into the memory of the recorder</strong>. See also Menuchat Ahava 24:13, Yechave Da'at 2:57 (<a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Electricity_on_Shabbat#Recorders\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Though I'm still not sure what R' Shlomo Zalman said about it.</p>\n\n\n",

Or if 'with all thy might' be written, why also write 'with all thy soul'? <strong>For the man to whom life is more precious than wealth</strong>, 'with all thy soul' is written; whilst he to <strong>whom wealth is more precious than life</strong> is bidden, 'with all thy might' [i.e., substance]. {Rashi explain that the love for G-d must be more than the dearest for you}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we understand why soul and substance; hearth is an other topic.

This also includes martyrdom as we see in Rav Hirsch on Va'esachanan - Devarim 6:5 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לבב is the heart of hearts, the innermost centre of the human\n  organic body. נפשׁ: the living and striving personality מאד: the\n  whole sum of means and forces, the \"fortune\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we have in the declaration of Independence; <em>Our lives our fortune and our sacred honor</em></p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch also says</p>\n\n<p>בכל לבבך ... both the יצר טוב and the יצר הרע are to be used to serve Hashem </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Yea, in truth, none of our inclinations are in themselves good or bad.\n  All of them, the most sensuous of the sensuous ones, the most\n  spiritual of the spiritual ones become good or bad according to\n  whether or not they are usedwithin the limits, and for the purpose\n  Hashem has allotted to each one of them, or misused, going beyond the\n  limits, neglecting the purposes, or changing them for other purposes\n  which Hashem has set for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Raav Hirsch continues regarding our existence</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בכל נפשך ... not to think that this remaining in His proximity would\n  be bought at too high a price by giving up the whole existence here\n  below for it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch brings the story of Rabbi Akiva from Berachos 61b as an example of this concept.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, we have the physical means of our survival.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובכל  מאודך: ... using all one's means in the service of Hashem as\n  well as in renouncing every gain or acquisition which can only be\n  obtained or kept through transgression of Hashem's laws.</p>\n  \n  <p>...

It is significant that the source and concept of ahavat\n  Hashem- “ve-ahavta eit Hashem Elokecha be-kol levavechah u-bekol\n  nafshecha u-bekol meodecha” - is the basis for the kidush Hashem of\n  martyrdom (idolatry, and possibly shaat ha-shemad…see Sanhedrin 74b;\n  Pesachim 25a; Rambam, Hilchot Yesodei ha-Torah 5:7), as well as the\n  daily kidush Hashem obligation to represent avodat Hashem and halachic\n  commitment constructively (Yoma 86a- “she-yehei shem shamayim mitahev\n  al yadecha”; Rambam, Yesodei ha-Torah 5:11, though with a different\n  source).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Kook (Olat Reiyah, 249) seems to suggest that me'odecha refers to Neshamah. </p>\n\n<p>In it's association with the body, ruach is tied to the lev or 'heart'.\nMaimonides connects ruach as movement to movement of the heart. 'The heart' He writes, 'is in constant motion,and the source of every motion noticed in the body.'

The answer is, if you are Ashkenazi, then a lot of poskim consider it forbidden as they view it as creating a new vessel, this is the opinion of Rav Shlomo Zalman. However, many Sephardic poskim disagree with this, such as Ovadia Yosef. Here is his opinion regarding opening bottle caps:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Ovadia Yosef disagrees with both points of Rav Shlomo Zalman. <strong>He\n  thinks that even while the cap is attached to the bottle it is\n  considered a kli since it is covering the bottle (Yechave Daat 2:42).</strong>\n  Also, if you would be able to take it off without breaking the ring,\n  even though it wouldn’t fit over a bottle of the same size, it would\n  technically still be usable to cover (albeit not via screwing) a\n  smaller bottle. (Response to Rav Shlomo Zalman quoted in Yalkut Yosef\n  Shabbos Krach Bet 314:18:20) Additionally, the Magid Mishnah (Hil’\n  Shabbos 12:2) holds that metakein kli is completely permitted if you\n  don’t have intent. Combining his above reasoning with the Magid\n  Mishnah’s leniency, Rav Ovadia paskins that it is permitted to open\n  bottle caps for the first time on Shabbos. Rav Shlomo Zalman disagrees\n  with Rav Ovadia's application of the Magid Mishnah. He explains that\n  even though your main intent is for the drinking, it’s also on your\n  mind to make a cap that would be usable in the future. Nonetheless,\n  Rav Ovadia paskins that it is permitted, and does not differentiate\n  between metal and plastic bottle caps.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Opening_bottles_and_cans#cite_note-25\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Opening_bottles_and_cans#cite_note-25</a></p>\n\n\n",

Forms of animals are allowed, see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5064\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">141, 6</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Here we will examine the problem of sculptures of animals. The Shulchan Aruch Yore Dea and the Baer Hetev commentary wrote (141, 6):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צוּרוֹת בְּהֵמוֹת, חַיּוֹת וְעוֹפוֹת וְדָגִים, וְצוּרוֹת אִילָנוֹת וּדְשָׁאִים וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָהֶם, מֻתָּר (כג) לָצוּר אוֹתָם, וַאֲפִלּוּ הָיְתָה הַצּוּרַת בּוֹלֶטֶת. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>באר היטב\n  (כג) לצור. וכ''ש להשהותם וכ' ב''י בשם רבינו אליקים דאין לצור בבהכ''נ צורות אלו שלא יהא נראה כמשתחוה להם והש''ך כתב דהב''ח בקו''א אוסר בצורת אריה ושור. וטענתו דהמזלות במדור התחתון הם וצורת אריה ושור עומד כ''א לבדו בחודש אב ואייר עכ''ד ולפ''ז כל הי''ב מזלות אסור לעשות אפילו כל א' בפ''ע וזה לא שמענו מעולם מי שנזהר בזה. הלכך נראה דהא דאמרינן דהמזלות אסורים היינו כל הי''ב ביחד דומיא דד' פנים להדדי והט''ז כתב דאותן שמצירים במחזורים בתפלת גשם צורת המזלות לא יפה הם עושים כיון שמכונים לעשות צורת המזלות (ובנה''כ השיג עליו וכתב דהדבר פשוט דהוי להבין ולהורות ועוד דאינו צורה גמורה): ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Forms of domestic, wild animals, birds and fishes, forms of trees and vegetables or something like are allowed to design (to make the form) in relief.</p>\n  \n  <p>Here is a partial and rough translation of the Baer Hetev: The Bet Yossef wrote in name of Rabenu Elyalkim that such form do not be placed in synagogue, for people not to get the impression that they prostrate themselves to the statues. The Shach reported that the Bach prohibited to make forms of Leo and Bull. The reason is that there are constellations with form of Leo and Bull (zodiac signs); Leo form is linked to the month of Av, and Bull to the month of Yiar. It appears that, following the Bach, each of the 12 constellations can not be reproduced. But we never heard anybody which is careful not to do this. There is however a prohibition when all 12 constellation are designed together. This is similar to representation of the 4 faces together <em>(Ezekiel 1, 5-6: And out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of a man. And every one had four faces, and every one of them had four wings.)</em>  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/72924/9215\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/72933/9215\">here</a> the psakim of Rambam and Shach. </p>\n\n\n",

Why it specifies Adam specifically? Who knows. Maybe there was a bigger concern for Adam to stay in Gan Eden than for Chavah. That I can't answer.

    "content": "# Targum Onkelos on זה קרבן פלוני בן פלוני\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the end of Naso, there is a difference in the Stone chumash's Targum Onkelos (edit: it's the same in the Dirshu chumash) between Nachshon and the other nesiim.  For Nachshon, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דין קֻרְבָּנָא דנחשון בר עמינדב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>while for Netanel and the rest, it says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דין קֻרבַּן נתנאל בר צוער</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bar Ilan Responsa and Mechon Mamre both have the same for all of them, which is a mix of those versions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דין קרבנא דפלוני בר פלוני</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where does the Artscroll version come from?  Why should there be a difference between Nachshon and the others?</p>\n\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n\n<p>This is what I originally had for Nachshon, I'm sure I saw this somewhere but can't find it now, the version in every Stone chumash I checked (large and small, editions ranging 1996-2006) is as above.  As @DoubleAA points out in the comments to my answer, this is inconsistent with Artscroll's source for the Targum.  Hidden to avoid confusion with the confirmed versions.</p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"spoiler\">\n  <p> דא קָרְבָּנָא דנחשון בר עמינדב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thank you for contacting us with your inquiry.</p>\n<p>The text of our Targum Onkelos is from Chumash Toras Elokim (Vilna, 1874) which includes R' Wolf Heidenheim’s text of the Targum; that text is based on manuscripts and is considered מדוייק.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the opportunity to clarify this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Cover page image from a later email from Artscroll.  It's not exactly the one @DoubleAA links to in the comments, pagination is also different, but the text of the Targum looks the same from a few pages they also included in the email.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5JkyD.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/5JkyD.png\" alt=\"cover page\" /></a></p>\n<p>I'm not marking this answer as correct because it doesn't explain the underlying reasons why Nachshon is different than the others.  In a followup email, they told me that they don't know any reason for the difference.</p>\n<p>Maybe I'll try asking Dirshu when I get a chance.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I just checked my mikros gedolos from mechon hamaor and the Torah temimah. Both have the odd דין קורבנא דנחשון followed by דין קורבן אליאב and similar for all the rest.</p>\n\n<p>So here's a couple of theories. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This first passuk was mistakenly 'fixed' based on the Targum Yerushalmi, which has the reading  דין קורבנא דיסדר וכו׳. There is a continued longer phrase used there which wouldn't have been so easy to jam in, so it wasn't.  As for why nobody stuck the variation found in that targum into the other nissiim, well, that because they're not printed out being that what we have printed as targum yerushalmi is sporadic.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The reason I would call this 'fix' a mistake is because targum pseudo Yonason in passuk 17 reads דין סדר קורבנא די יקרב etc. as does passuk 23. The other pesukim follow with וגו׳, so we can't be sure but let's assume the pattern would continue. These two targumim usually follow a more similar pattern when compared to Onkelus.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>This next theory is just a grasp at a straw without really understating why it would be true. We find one variation in Nachshon's pesukim where the Torah begins by saying וקרבנו, with an extra וי׳ו. This is addressed in the mefarshim (see Ibn Ezra Rashbam Rabeinu Bachaye and others). So perhaps, for some reason, the refocusing of the pesukim with that וי׳ו will end up with a קורבנא דפלוני. But I can't give a guess as to why.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Hashem react so violently against the people who demanded meat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The question is self explanatory so I'll just clarify why it seems to me that Hashem's reaction is disproportionate. Imagine a parent with a spoiled child who starts demanding more than he deserves. We can imagine several responses from the parent. Perhaps the parent will simply give in to the child. Perhaps he'll ignore the child so that the child will learn that unreasonable requests are ignored. Perhaps he'll reduce the amount the child currently receives so that he'll learn to appreciate what he has.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, <em>killing</em> the child seems like a totally inappropriate response. If a parent reacted excessively violently to such behaviour, we'd probably accuse him of being abusive and wouldn't allow him to continue looking after the child. So why does Hashem react so violently against the Jews in the desert when they demand meat? Sure, their behaviour was wrong but it's difficult to believe that death was literally the only viable response.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Talmud (Yevamot 121a) expounding on the verse \"it is very stormy round about Him\" (Tehilim 50:3) - \"this teaches that \"the Holy One blessed be He scrutinizes judgment on His pious ones to the degree of a hair's breadth\" </p>\n\n<p>Those who left Egypt with Moses are known as the Dor Deah (Vayikra Raba 9:1), the Generation of Knowledge. This generation, which witnessed the miracles of the Ten Plagues, the Exodus from slavery to freedom, and the Giving of the Torah at Mt. Sinai was on an extremely high spiritual plane.</p>\n\n<p>As to your comparison to child raising, they were not children but full grown men. they deserved what they got relative to their level of knowledge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Soloveitchik, the reason God responded so badly is because eating meat is actually something God abhors very much, and therefore tries to put as many restrictions on it as possible. According to Soloveitchik, one of the reasons that God flooded the world was because mankind started eating meat, which is why God allows eating meat after the flood, so that way He wouldn't have to destroy the world again. So in actuality, what happened in the desert makes a lot of sense when compared God's response to the generation of Noach.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Soloveitchik’s severe stance is based on the story of Kivrot ha-Ta’avah (the graves of those who craved [meat]), the tragic account of Benei Yisrael’s lust for animal flesh. In the story of Kivrot ha-Ta’avah, Benei Yisrael protest to God and Moshe, demanding meat instead of the manna that God had been supplying. Moshe prays to God and, although God is angry with the people, He gives them the meat. Once satiated, the people die as a result of a plague that God sends. In his explanation of this story, R. Soloveitchik says that God admonished Israel for their dissatisfaction with their vegetarian diet of manna and their need to have meat. Deuteronomy 12:20, in discussing God’s commandments for when Benei Yisrael will live in the land of Israel, supports this point: “And you shall say: ‘I will eat flesh’, because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh, after all the desire of your soul.” The Torah uses the word “desire” to characterize man’s hunger for meat; it is the dominating physical desire. Hence, according to R. Soloveitchik, vegetarianism should be practiced, yet man, too desirous for meat, refuses to stop eating animal flesh.</p>\n  \n  <p>In explaining his point, R. Soloveitchik cites Sanhedrin 59b, which\n  says that Adam did not eat meat, and it was only when Noah entered the\n  biblical narrative that meat was permitted. Commenting on this, R.\n  Soloveitchik states that the natural reality of Adam’s distaste for\n  meat became the ethical norm with the phrase, “and it was so.” R.\n  Soloveitchik explains, “Thus the verse concludes ‘and it was so’: the\n  ethical norm became a behavior pattern, an expression of the ontic\n  order.” The ethical imperative against eating meat becomes the\n  physical and biological reality of man’s world—no one would eat meat.\n  Yet, as the history of man continues through dor ha-mabbul (the\n  generation of the flood), man begins to overreach himself, to take\n  what is not his, including the life of another living being. Thus, God\n  eventually gives in and allows Noah to eat meat: “Every moving thing\n  that lives shall be food for you; even as the green herb have I given\n  you all things.” R. Soloveitchik explains, “At once the Torah began to\n  regulate the ‘murder’ of other lives, to restrict its practice by\n  complicating the procedure… ‘[the Torah succumbed to the Evil\n  Inclination by allowing for certain things, hence] the Torah provided\n  for human passions: [reasoning that] it is better for Israel to eat\n  the flesh of animals that are ritually slaughtered than the flesh of\n  animals which have perished [i.e. nevelot (the dead unslaughtered\n  carcass of an animal)]’ (Kiddushin 21b-22a).” R. Soloveitchik explains\n  that the Torah allows man to fulfill his desire for meat, but out of a\n  care for animal life, it complicated the process of acquiring meat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.kolhamevaser.com/2012/02/vegetarianism-and-judaism-the-ravs-radical-view/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kolhamevaser.com/2012/02/vegetarianism-and-judaism-the-ravs-radical-view/</a></p>\n\n<p>Based on this view, your example of a spoiled child wanting more than he deserves doesn't quite fit. It's much more closer to having your child suddenly demand that you murder your family dog to feed him even though you've already given him food to live off of. It's a much more disturbing reality. Since we've been consuming meat since the flood, it's hard for us to picture it being such a big deal, but as Rav Soloveitchik points out, God has been remarkably consistent regarding His dislike of people eating animals.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The 5th Commandment - Who should be financially supported first - children or parents?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During a recent <em>Pirkei Avot</em> shi'ur in my synagogue, our rabbi discussed two concepts.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Parents.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jewish Virtual Library</a> citing of Talmud, Tractate Kiddushin 31B </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: What is \"revere\" and what is \"honor?\" \"Revere\"\n  means that the son must neither stand in his father's place nor sit in\n  his place, nor contradict his words nor [even] support his words [when\n  he is arguing with another sage]. \"Honor\" means that he must give him\n  food and drink, clothe and cover him, lead him in and out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avot chapter 5 (I think Mishnah 18? need to edit, later) states a person's lifetime \"milestones\" by stating that at age 18 one gets married, and at 20 he seeks work.</p>\n\n<p>The rabbi made a conclusion from these 2 citings. He stated that according to the Talmud's teachings, a parent is obligated to support the children until age 20, after which the child is expected to be financially independent. Yes, he acknowledged that, among current Jewish religious society, there are numerous parents supporting their kids in yeshiva, Kolel, etc. but he pointed out that according to the Talmud, it seems that this is not the recommended method.</p>\n\n<p>However, the 1st citing from Kiddushin seems to make clear that children are continuously obligated to financially support the parents, at least to the point where they must make sure that their parents are fed and clothed. This obligation never ends as long as the parents live.</p>\n\n<p>My question:</p>\n\n<p>If the child has only enough money to feed or clothe his own children or his parent, but not both, who gets the priority - the parent or his own children? Does it matter if his children are below or above age 20, per the above assumption? Are there any other criteria that would favor one priority over another, that I haven't mentioned?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>His children.</p>\n\n<p>The Gemara shortly after the one you quoted makes note that one is not obligated to actively spend money in order to fulfill their chiyuv of kibbud av v'eim, and in the event that they do, they are entitled to reimbursement. While this would seem to indicate only that <em>he</em> takes precedence over his parents, and not <em>his</em> children, there's a Gemara in the third perek of Kiddushin (64b) that notes that personal chiyuvim take precedence over chiyuvim that others imposed upon him. Combining these two sugyos would seem to indicate, then, that a son should be able to feed his children, his personal chiyuv over which he must spend money, over his parents, who are not his personal chiyuv over which he must spend money.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This is not a Halachic answer, but some considerations: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>the [needy] parents are seemingly the first in Tzedakah - there's no other monetary obligation toward one's parents.</p></li>\n<li><p>THe monetary obligations toward the kids are not clear, whether they are Rabbinical rulings of indebtment or branches of Tzedakah and in which category of age and conditions (single/married, סמוכים על שלחנו, Torah scholars etc). In case of his wife, however, it is clear that he's \"indebted\" to her, but the kids are unclear - is he indebted to his kids or just a pure Tzedakah.</p></li>\n<li><p>Interestingly I couldn't find anybody linking the dispute to the beginning of the Torah, namely \"עַל כֵּן <strong>יַעֲזָב אִישׁ אֶת אָבִיו וְאֶת אִמּוֹ</strong>; וְדָבַק בְּאִשְׁתּוֹ\" - what does it mean practically, regarding כיבוד או\"א and one's responsibilities.</p></li>\n<li><p>If we agree that supporting kids stems from Tzedakah also, given the rule \"עניי עירך קודמים\" I'm curious who are considered to be closer to a person - his parents or his kids.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

I have not found the actual location in Radak so I do not know (other than the quoted article), where the Radak says this.</p>\n\n<p>I found a reference to Moshe Cassuto, professor of Bible at the Hebrew University, who suggests an alternative answer. He suggests (involving the Dodanim in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8174#v=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Noach 10:4</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16521#showrashi=true&v=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Divrei Hayamim I 1:7</a> that in both Dodanim and Deuel, the names are actually shortened forms of a longer name.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once again we have a “daled” and a “resh” interchanged. He suggests\n  that the original name of the people was “Derodanim”, however, they\n  were known better in its shorter form, as both the Dodanim and the\n  Rodanim. So too, Eliasaph's father. His full name was Deru’el. However,\n  he was called by both its shorter forms; sometimes called De’uel and\n  sometimes Re’uel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbibuchwald.njop.org/2016/06/05/bamidbar-5776-2016/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Buchwald</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The commentators raise an issue regarding the leader’s name. In the\n  very next chapter, in Numbers 2:14, when the camp’s setup and\n  structure are described, the prince of the tribe of Gad is identified\n  with a slight change as, אֶלְיָסָף בֶּן רְעוּאֵל, Eliasaph the son of\n  Reuel, not “Deuel.”</p>\n  \n  <p>Nachmanides suggests that Eliasaph’s father had two names, “Deuel,”\n  which indicates that he knew G-d, and “Reuel,” indicating that he\n  constantly imagined G-d in his heart. Scripture preserved both names\n  in order to convey that both these special qualities were found in\n  Eliasaph’s father.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Radak says that both names are actually identical. He attributes\n  the change to the fact that both the Hebrew letters, ד–“dalet” and\n  ר–“raysh,” are graphically similar, and are consequently often\n  interchanged. Therefore, some people pronounce the name\n  דְּעוּאֵל–“Deuel” while others pronounce it רְעוּאֵל–“Reuel.” The\n  Torah preserves both names in order to underscore that both names are\n  essentially the same.</p>\n  \n  <p>Some commentators identify “Reuel” as Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law. \n  After all, Reuel (Exodus 2:18) was one of Jethro’s seven names. The\n  Baalei Tosafot contend that after he converted, Jethro’s name was\n  formally changed to “Deuel,” indicating that Jethro knew G-d. The\n  problem with this interpretation is that it fails to explain why the\n  child of a convert is listed as the leader of the tribe of Gad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that the child of a (male) convert does not belong to any tribe. However, this may be a reference showing that someone named Reuel could also be called Deuel and not that he was actually the son of Yisro (Reuel - Deuel)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Imrei Noam , cited by Pninim ahl HaTorah, says that the change of\n  names comes to teach an important ethical lesson. The Midrash states\n  that the tribe of Dan, who was the firstborn child of Zilpah (Leah’s\n  handmaiden), was given a great honor and was designated to lead an\n  entire דֶּגֶל–degel (banner), that included the tribes of Asher and\n  Naphtali. Gad, who was the first born child of Bilhah (Rachel’s\n  handmaiden), after all, could have easily protested why Dan was given\n  the honor of leading a banner of three tribes and not Gad. Therefore,\n  because Eliasaph was prepared to concede and forego the deserved\n  honor, and did not complain, his father’s name was changed to “Reuel,”\n  which means, רֵעַ אֵ־ל–“Ray’ah Kayl,” a friend of G-d, just like\n  Moses. One who avoids disputes, and is willing to forego a truly\n  deserved honor, is considered to be a true friend of G-d.\n  Additionally, although the exact place of Moses’ burial is not known,\n  he is buried in the territory of Gad, on the east bank of the Jordan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, I keep hearing that the Lubavitcher Rebbe zt\"l had an interesting, perhaps liberal position regarding women's study of gemara.</p>\n\n<p>But I don't know exactly what it was, and pages like <a href=\"http://www.transformative-judaism.com/the-rebbes-clever-position-on-teaching-gemara-to-women/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> do little to clear up the confusion. What was it?\nDid the Rebbe have--and/or does Chabad today have--an \"official\" position regarding the permissibility of gemara study for women? </p>\n\n<p>(I am interested both in the most recent Lubavitcher Rebbe's position on this issue, and--insofar as it might be subtly different--in the holistic Chabad view, i.e., including positions of the previous Rebbes. I would also like to know what Chabad does in practice with this information; as far as I understand, it is a bit of a mixed bag, insofar as mainstream Chabad women learn Ayn Yaakov but not general gemara, but certain Chabad institutions have and do teach women gemara itself, if I am not mistaken. Can anyone confirm or refute?) </p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7071/is-it-forbidden-for-a-woman-to-learn-gemara\">Is it forbidden for a woman to learn Gemara?</a> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'd say \"discouraged\", not \"prohibited.\" Generally, women should have the Torah background that they need to function. It's the pure, theoretical pursuit of knowledge that gave Chazal pause. </p>\n\n<p>I'm told the Seventh Rebbe zt\"l felt that some basic exposure to Gemara today is considered material that's needed to function, and therefore allowed and even encouraged. That may mean a few pages of practical material about Shabbos, Pesach, or Brachos to understand the halachic process behind them; not necessarily spending six months on <em>Takfo Kohen</em> or <em>Shev Shmaytsa</em> (if you don't know what those are, don't worry about it).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Rakeffet has an mp3 about a meeting between the Lubavitcher Rebbe and a younger Belzer Rebbe where they're agreeing about the need for more textual exposure for the daughters of their communities, including some Gemara. If I recall correctly, a recording of that discussion is available.</p>\n\n<p>It's not really that radical of a position.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I learned from Rabbi Levke Kaplan of Chabad that the Lubavitcher Rebbe said women should study Talmud \"without limitation.\" </p>\n\n<p>I have since heard another shiur where this was confirmed; apparently, the Lubavitcher Rebbe privately discussed his position (strongly supporting women's access to and study of all parts of the Talmud, if I understand correctly) with the Belzer(?) Rebbe, who disagreed. Their conversation has been documented but I don't remember where.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Why women don’t learn gemara\nIn the days preceding Rosh Hashanah 5713  (1952),  the  Rebbe  received  a  group  of  university  students  for  a  joint yechidus  in  his  room.  After  a  few  words  on  the  significance  of the   time,   the   Rebbe   allowed   for   questions.\nOne     student     asked,     “Is     Torah     learning  equal  for  girls  as  it  is  for  boys?  Does  Lubavitch  offer  higher  education in Torah for girls, such as Talmud studies?\nThe Rebbe responded, “No. Men are obligated  to  study  Gemara,  but  not  women.\n“The  reason  for  this  is  not  because  they  are  less  capable,  but  because  Hashem   has   entrusted   them   with   a  more  important,  loftier  duty,  and  they   are   therefore   absolved   from   learning Torah.\n“That     holy     duty,”     the     Rebbe     explained,  “is  to  imbue  a  spirit  of  Yiddishkeit in the next generation. In order to allow them to do this, they are exempt from limud haTorah.”\n(Teshurah Sandhaus, Shevat 5768)</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.merkazanash.com/sites/default/files/584%20-%20Rosh%20Hashana.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.merkazanash.com/sites/default/files/584%20-%20Rosh%20Hashana.pdf</a></p>\n<p>look at the 2nd page 'a moment with the rebbe'</p>\n\n\n",

They say that Rav Yisrael Salanter disagreed, and so deeply that he refused to write an approbation to the whole book unless this ruling was corrected. According to what is attributed to Rav Yisrael, it is prohibited to do teshuvah at the expense of another.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Chafeitz Chaim also rules (Mishnah Berurah 606:3) that \"when he asks forgiveness, he must spell out how he wronged his friend. But if he knows his friend would be embarrassed by the sin being spelled out, then he should not spell them out.\"</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, Rav Shelomo Zalman Auerbach (Halikhos Shelomo 1:3:6) understands the Chafetz Chaim as making a distinction between causing grief, as in finding out a rumor was told about him, and the Mishnah Berurah's case of causing embarrassment.</p>\n\n<p>Since the question referred to causing shame, Rav Shelomo Zalman would rule according to either sage is no.

    "content": "# Asking a shaila with Loshon Hara\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can you say loshon hara for the purposes of asking a shaila (i.e., of a rav)? Must you meet the Chofetz Chaim's <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Lashon_Hara#Permitted_forms_of_saying_Lashon_Harah\" rel=\"nofollow\">seven prerequisites for saying constructive loshon hara</a> in order to do so in this case?</p>\n\n<p>Assume, for the sake of argument, that it is not possible to anonymize the situation, nor go to a rav who doesn't know the person.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to R. Menahem HaMeiri the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements of a negative nature that are said for a positive reason (in this case asking a rabbi a question), and not to hurt others, <em>are permissible since by definition they are not l'shon hara.</em> These are his words in is Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So while you should always use your judgement as to the most effective way to achieve a desired end, while minimising any damaging effects of one's behaviours, it does not appear that asking a question of a rabbi, which includes negative information about someone, would qualify as <em>l'shon hara</em> according to the Meiri.</p>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to to'elet, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the eminent modern day halakhic authority, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Asher Weiss</a> Shlit\"a writes in Minhat Asher to Leviticus (p. 268) that <em>to'elet renders speech permissible and not l'shon hara, by definition</em>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באיסורי תורה צריך לדון בדיני דחיה האם תועלת זו ראויה לדחות איסור ...אבל בהלכות לשה\"ר לאו מדין דחיה אתינן עלה, אלא יסוד האיסור תלוי במדה רעה וכל שכונתו לטובה...ולא לרעתו אין בזה עבירה כלל, ודו\"ק בכ\"ז כי לענ\"ד ברור הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>With Torah prohibitions one must evaluate with the laws of <em>dehiya</em> [prioritisation], whether this <em>to'elet</em> [purpose] is sufficient to supersede a prohibition. But with the laws of <em>l'shon hara</em>, we are not utilising the law of supercession. Rather, the very definition of the prohibition depends on negative character traits, and anything in which his intent is for good...and not for someone else's harm, has no prohibition whatsoever, and consider all of this, for in my humble opinion, it is clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows that this is the opinion of Rashi (Moed Katan 16a s.v. amar lei la'avuha) and sharply disputes (p. 267) the Hafets Hayyim's attempt at escaping the implication of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בחפץ חיים...כתב...ודבריו קשים לכאו' דמלבד שאין הדברים מתיישבים בלשון רש\"י</p>\n  \n  <p>However in Haffets Hayyim...he wrote...and his words appear difficult, for besides for the fact that his words don't fit with Rashi's wording...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Like R. Elhanan, he connects this to the idea that interpersonal mitsvot in general are by definition only prohibited when they are malicious. (In particular he connects this to the prohibition of overcharging, see p. 267)].</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, he clarifies (p. 267) that there are limits to the limitation of <em>l'shon hara</em> to cases of malicious intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דשאני המספר לשה\"ר דרך קלות ראש דהרי פושע גמור ובזה ודאי עובר בחטא כיון שהדברים מצד עצמם הם לשה\"ר גמור ובדרך שחוק וקלות ראש מנבל הוא את פיו בכה\"ג פושע הוא אף שלא התכוין להרע לחבירו</p>\n  \n  <p>For it is different if a person speaks <em>l'shon hara</em> with frivolity, since the matters are intrinsically <em>l'shon hara</em> and in the context of frivolity and levity, he pollutes his mouth. In such a case, he is a willful sinner even though he didn't intent to harm his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: \"I was just having a good time\", isn't a legitimate excuse to speak disparagingly about someone. However, by all indications, speaking when there is some specific purpose, such as asking a question of a rabbi, would be fine.</p>\n\n<p>This apparently nearly unanimous view expressed by the Meiri, R. Wasserman, R. Weiss, and the numerous authorities they cite as support, is expressed by R. David Cohen Shlit\"a, as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This to my mind [is similar to\n  when] the poskim speak about lashon harah l’toeles [for a helpful purpose], which is not limited to loshan\n  harah. Any [transgression of] bein adam l’chaveiro [when it is] l’toeles is mutar (cited <a href=\"http://drsorotzkin.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/eng-honoring-abusive-parents.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, page 7)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yes, because the issur of lashon hara is to evaluate someone negatively via your description of their actions. </p>\n\n<p>Because halacha is impassive there is no character assessment through asking a shailah.</p>\n\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim only says an ed echad may be lashon hara where that level of testimony is insuffucient for the court to act.</p>\n\n\n",

Several sources that describe how there's good in every bad situation - the proverbial silver lining to every cloud. </p>\n\n<p>The Gemara in Brachos (60b) says \"all that Hashem does is for the good.\" This came off of the Mishnah's statement that \"for measurement that Hashem metes out to you, you should thank Him greatly.\" Similarly, the famous Nachum Ish Gamzu used to say to everything that would happen, \"This, too, is for the good\" (Taanis 21a).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the snake's curse to crawl on its belly (Bereishis 3), Bereishis Rabbah comments that it was to its good: after all, snakes can escape more easily through holes in walls from predators. </p>\n\n<p>There are certainly dozens of sources like these. The point is, in everything bad that happens, there's something good. To address your specific examples:</p>\n\n<p>-Yaakov told Reuven off over the incident with the beds. Or did he? According to one version (Shabbos 55b), the line means that his sin was cleared. According to the others, he's just mentioning Reuven's sin. Either way, Yaakov isn't saying that Reuven henceforth will no longer be the firstborn; that decision seemingly was made back in Vayishlach when the incident actually happened (see Rashi to Bereishis 35:23).</p>\n\n<p>-Shimon and Levi get cursed and lose their portion of Eretz Yisrael. Except that they don't get cursed, and it was to their benefit that they were scattered. Read the passuk carefully: \"Cursed be their <em>anger</em>.\" Not them - their anger. As far as being scattered, Rashi points out that since teachers are from Shimon and Levi collects Terumos and Maaseros, they need to be scattered throughout Yisrael to do their job properly. </p>\n\n<p>-Yissachar was given a blessing as well. Rashi, still quoting the Midrash, says this line is metaphorical and refers to the fact that many Talmidei Chachamim were descended from Yissachar. </p>\n\n\n",

At last, he wrote that there's a connection/dependence between Kiddush and the 'Naming' process, such that some people are not giving a name to the baby until it's possible to make a Kiddush (and of course that can happened only on Shabbos or Yom Tov etc). </p>\n\n\n",

See for instance the RMA OC 219 sayif 4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם בירך אחר ואמר ברוך אתה ה' אלהינו מלך העולם אשר גמלך כל טוב וענה אמן יצא וכן אם אמר בריך רחמנא מלכא דעלמא דיהבך לן וענה אמן יצא.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Someone who blessed as a praise statement when his friend came back from a travel.

Gemara about havdala deals with the issue  of saying havdala a second time,  not as a praise,  it is obvious because nobody says  twice  the same shevach in a little interval of time.  For the lupin eating failing  also,  he blessed to eat,  not to say a spontaneous shevach.  To call אשר קדשנו a false statement is not necessarily true because of the plural which can point the mechuyavut of the Klal. </p>\n\n\n",

A different use of the word today may lead an uninformed reader to misconception. Nature is a word used to describe an independent world mechanism. See bellow the last Ramban commentary on Parashat Bo.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומן הנסים הגדולים המפורסמים אדם מודה בנסים הנסתרים שהם יסוד התורה כלה, שאין לאדם חלק בתורת משה רבינו עד שנאמין בכל דברינו ומקרינו שכלם נסים אין בהם טבע ומנהגו של עולם, בין ברבים בין ביחיד, אלא אם יעשה המצות יצליחנו שכרו</p>\n<p>On the basis of great and wel known miracles, man have to take account of hidden miracles.

Rather, he asserts that the world functions in a way that rewards the good and punishes the bad. This is sometimes (rarely) accomplished through God's tampering with the natural order, but is generally accomplished through the laws of nature themselves.</p>\n<p>The central contention of this Ramban is that  every event is righteousnes of G-d, with a great accuracy for punishments and rewards.

The concept of Hashgacha as protection.</h2>\n<p>Ramban's comment Bereshit 19:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנכון בעיני שהיא ידיעה בו ממש ירמוז כי ידיעת השם שהיא השגחתו בעולם השפל היא לשמור הכללים. ‏</p>\n<p>The explanation that makes more sense for me is that \"knowledge\" concerning G-d is defined as \"protection\" toward lowly world, to ensure the integrity of groups (sets, species).</p>\n<p>וגם בני האדם מונחים בו למקרים עד בא עת פקודתם ‏</p>\n<p>Humans too, are subjects to the hazards (natural accidents, not random), until their last day.</p>\n<p>אבל בחסידיו ישום אליו לבו לדעת אותו בפרט להיות שמירתו דבקה בו תמיד לא תפרד הידיעה והזכירה ממנו כלל. ‏</p>\n<p>In the opposite, with regard to its devoted, he is being particularly benevolent\". This means that He or she ensures an uninterrupted custody.</p>\n<p>כטעם לא יגרע מצדיק עיניו (איוב לו ז) ובאו מזה פסוקים רבים כדכתיב (תהלים לג יח) הנה עין ה' אל יראיו וזולת זה ‏</p>\n<p>as the verse (Job 36, 7) \"He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous\". Many verses concern this issue (Psalms 33, 17) \"Behold, the eye of the Lord is upon those who fear him\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the Hashgacha of Hashem in the intent of the More Nevuchim (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14118&st=&pgnum=588\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">III, 51</a>) and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40232&st=&pgnum=158\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban Vayera</a> is a Divine protection, as stories in Gemara that Mal'ach Hamavet (Angel of the Death) needs to make a noise, distracting the tsadik from attachment to G-d and interrupting the Divine protection it to kill it.</p>\n<p>The Shem Tov commentary <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14118&st=&pgnum=587&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">III, 51</a> summarizes <strong>different  measures aimed at protecting human beings</strong> (listed by increasing order following the degree of perfection of a man):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The active intellect gives a good idea to protect himself against danger;</li>\n<li>The active intellect gives him advice in a dream;</li>\n<li>The man would not be separated from G-d, except for basic needs activities. Just at the time when it will leave G-d for a material thing, bad events may happen.</li>\n<li>Prophets, which remain attached to G-d even when they are occupied with them body. nothing bad will happen to them. .</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>An equivocal reference to the word Hashgacha:</h2>\n<p>For me the <strong>Sefer Hachinuch in Mitsva 169, Tum'at Metsora</strong>, summarized very clearly many other views and included the common view of Ramban and Rambam above treated.  You can observe that he used the word Hashgacha alternatively for two different meanings in the text bellow (show my note between brackets in the paragraph about humankind):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל ענין הסגרין אלו יורה השגחתו ברוך הוא על כל דרכי האדם אחת לאחת. ולפי שהדעות רבות בהשגחת האל על כל ברואיו, יבואו בה הרבה פסוקים במקרא והרבה מצות להורות על הענין מהיותו פנה גדולה בתורתנו. ‏</p>\n<p>The problem of Hesger Metsora shows the monitoring of the Holy blessed be He to each behavior of man. There are several opinions about this monitoring, broadly detailed in verses and linked with several Mitsvot. This is a big issue of our Law.</p>\n<p>שיש כתות בני אדם יחשבו כי השגחת השם יתברך על כל המינין בפרט בין אנשים או כל שאר בעלי חיים,  ‏</p>\n<p>Some groups think that the monitoring is the same for every species, human and non human being.</p>\n<p>ויש מהן כתות יחשבו כי השגחת השם ברוך הוא על כל עניני העולם בין בעלי חיים או כל שאר דברים, כלומר שלא יתנועע דבר אחד קטן בעולם הזה רק בחפצו ברוך הוא ובגזרתו עד שיחשבו כי בנפל עלה אחד מן האילן הוא גזר עליו שיפל, ואי אפשר שיתאחר או יקדם זמן נפילתה אפילו רגע, וזה דעת רחוק הרבה מן השכל  ‏</p>\n<p>Other groups think that every being, animal, or not, are monitored. Nothing does move, little as big, in the world, without His will, blessed be He, without His decision. If a leaf falls from the tree, this results from His decision that it falls. It was impossible that it fallen after or before this. This view is far from the Reason.</p>\n<p>. ויש כתות רעות יחשבו שלא ישים השגחתו ברוך הוא כלל בכל עניני העולם השפל, בין באנשים או בשאר בעלי חיים, והוא דעת הכופרים, רע ומר. ‏</p>\n<p>There are groups which think that He does not monitor anything in this lowly world, no humans and no animals. This is the opinion of heretics, bad and bitter.</p>\n<p>ואנחנו בעלי הדעת האמיתים לפי מה ששמעתי נשים השגחתו ברוך הוא על כל מיני בעלי חיים בכלל, שכל מין מן המינים הנבראים בעולם, יתקיים לעולם, לא יכלה ויאבד כלו, כי בהשגחתו ימצא קיום לכל דבר.</p>\n<p>But us, we believe, following what I have learned, we see the monitoring for each species {not individual} of animals, that this species will remain for ever {Hashgacha = protection, as I explained above}, do not be exterminated. Because his protection is for the maintain of everything.</p>\n<p>ובמין האדם נאמין כי השגחתו ברוך הוא על כל אחד ואחד בפרט, והוא המבין אל כל מעשיהם (תהלים לג טו). וכן קבלנו מגדולינו, וגם נמצא על זה הרבה כתובים יורו כי הענין כן. ‏</p>\n<p>Regarding humankind, we believe that the (protection)/[monitoring] {<code>here we see a \"shift in meaning\". The author is not wrong, he explain that regarding humankind Hashgacha is spitted in two parts, protection, which is not for all, and reward-punishment, for each. Differently, about other beings that have no free will, this double definition is not relevant</code>} is to each individual separately, He knows (and understand) each of their behavior. We received this teaching from our great teachers. We can found many verses which go in this direction.</p>\n<p>ולכן הזהירתנו התורה כי בהגיע אל האדם החלי הרע, והוא הצרעת, שלא יקחנו דרך מקרה, רק יחשב מיד כי עונותיו גרמו וירחיק מחברת בני אדם כאדם המרחק מרע מעשיו, ויתחבר אל המכפר המרפא שבר החטא ויראה אליו נגעו, ובעצתו ובדבריו ובפשפוש מעשיו יוסר מעליו הנגע, כי האל ברוך הוא שמשגיח עליו תמיד יראה מעשה תשובתו וירפאהו, וזהו ענין ההסגרין כמו שאמרנו.</p>\n<p>So, Torah is reminding us that the occurrence of some illness, the leper, does not be considered as an accident. He should think immediately that his sins caused this. He need to leave the human society as a man which runs away from its own bad conducts....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Conclusion:</h3>\n<p>The word \"Hashgacha\" has a double meaning which don't be confused: 1.- protection,  2.- All event in the live of the individual or the group happened following equity as reward or punishment. The current common language employ the second. More Nevuchim (III, 51), Ramban Vayera spoke about the first. Ramban parashat Bo and Mesilat Yesharim above cited talk about the second.</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n",

They examined their beds with cotton {according to Rashi}.' This provides support for a ruling of Samuel. For Samuel ruled: The bed(31) may be examined only with cotton tufts or with clean and soft wool. Rab observed: This explains what they said in Palestine on Sabbath eves, when I was there, 'Who requires cotton {according to Rashi} tufts for his bread', and I did not understand at the time what they meant. Raba stated: <strong>Old {whiter than the news, Rashi} flax</strong> garments are admirably suited for examination purposes. But can this be correct, seeing that the school of Manasseh taught: The bed <strong>may not be examined either with a red rag or with a black one or with flax</strong>, but only with cotton tufts or with clean and soft wool? This is no difficulty, since the latter refers to flax while the former refers to garments of flax. And if you prefer I might reply: Both ref to garments of flax but the latter deals with new ones while the former deals with old ones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><code>Can these be laundered for reuse?</code></h3>\n<h2>Yes.</h2>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why Use Of Torah Crown Only By Shabbos/Yom Tov Shachris?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many Shules place the Torah's crown on the Sefer Torah only by Shabbos/Yom Tov Shachris, why is that so?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I added Yom Tov as I agree with msh210's observation that it is also true on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As Double AA said, it might just be the time when the donor's there. My guess, however, would be for Kavod Shabbos. If you had the crown on all the time, it wouldn't be special when you saw it on Shabbos. </p>\n\n<p>But that leads to the question of why not put it on during Shabbos Minchah? I'd guess that this is because at Shabbos Minchah time, the Kedushah of Shabbos starts to fade away. This is why we often say the Tzikasichah prayer towards the end of Minchah, to try and retain the Kedushah of Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In many shuls, this is nothing more than a space constraint, esp. if the Shabbat davening is in a chapel during weekdays and a bigger shul on Shabbat. Usually, the chapel has a small ark, so there just isn't room to store it with the crown, esp. if the small ark has just enough space for 1 or 2 Sifrei Torah. </p>\n\n<p>My shul is exactly like this. We pray in the smaller chapel all the time except Shabbat and Yom Tov. The big shul's ark is so large that they can store the Sifrei Torah with the crowns on them.</p>\n\n<p>Another possible factor - the crown can add a lot of weight to an already heavy Torah. If elderly people are the regular \"miyannaires\" (I see this phenomena in a number of small-town shuls, esp. Conservative ones), many of them can't carry the Torah with that added weight. On Shabbat, these shuls attract more people and families, and often, younger stronger men can carry the Torah with its crown.</p>\n\n\n",

However, due to the cooking method, rei'ach is likely exchanged to some degree. </p>\n\n<p>Do the poskim discuss whether the same smoker may be used (at different times, with cleaning) for both milchigs and fleischigs, based on the above factor?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Note: the above-linked question appears to assume simultaneous cooking, while this question does not.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><code>However, due to the cooking method, rei'ach is likely exchanged to some degree.</code></p>\n\n<p>Let's start with the problem of Reach (odour, smell) in Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>See Pesachim 76ab:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב בשר שחוטה שמן שצלאו עם בשר נבילה כחוש אסור מאי טעמא מפטמי מהדדי ולוי אמר אפילו בשר שחוטה כחוש שצלאו עם בשר נבילה שמן מותר מאי טעמא ריחא בעלמא הוא וריחא לאו מילתא היא ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rab said: Fat meat of a [ritually] slaughtered [animal] which was roasted together with lean meat of nebelah is forbidden. What is the reason? They fatten each other. But Levi maintained: Even lean meat of a [ritually] slaughtered [animal] which was roasted together with fat meat of nebelah is permitted. What is the reason? It is a mere smell, and smell is nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>So we know yet</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>that there is some problem with smell from a non-kasher meat that\nmay alter the kasher meat when both are rosted together, a problem of \"givin the taste\" based on the prohibition of Taam Keyikar</li>\n<li>and we know also that two opinions exist, Rav prohibited this and\nLevi allowed (for Levi, the smell does not rise the degree of \"Taam\").</li>\n<li>We see too that even if the \"prohibited/prohibitant\" meat is less\nfatty, Rav prohibits.</li>\n<li>We see also that smell which goes from one food to another when they are roasted at the same time is discussed only, so the intensity of contact is relatively strong.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עביד לוי עובדא בי ריש גלותא בגדי ודבר אחר </p>\n  \n  <p>Levi gave a practical decision at the house of the Resh Galutha in the case of a goat and 'something else.'</p>\n  \n  <p>מיתיבי אין צולין שני פסחים כאחד מפני התערובת מאי לאו תערובת טעמים וקשיא ללוי ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>An objection is raised: One may not roast two Passover offerings together, on account of the mixture. Surely that means, the mixture of [the] flavours, which is a difficulty on Levi's view?</p>\n  \n  <p>.... לימא תיהוי תיובתיה דרב אמר רבי ירמיה הכא במאי עסקינן כגון שצלאו בשתי קדירות בשתי קדירות סלקא דעתך אלא אימא כעין שתי קדירות  דליכא תערובת טעמים ‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>we say [then] that this is a refutatio of Rab? - Said R`Jeremiah: The case we discuss here is e.g. , where he roasted them in two pots... when there is no mixture of flavours.\n  [You say] '\n  In two pots - can you think so! - Rather say, as though [they were roasted in] two pots,</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>New informations:</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Th smell prohibited by Rav is for Rav a strict equivalent of prohibited taste, </li>\n<li>But this kind of taste, passing through air does not contaminate from a food in one container to an other food in an other container.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>... תני רב כהנא בריה דרב חיננא סבא פת שאפאה עם צלי בתנור אסור לאכלה בכותחא ההיא ביניתא דאיטווא בהדי בישרא אסרה רבא מפרזיקיא למיכליה בכותחא מר בר רב אשי אמר אפי' במילחא נמי אסורה משום דקשיא לריחא ולדבר אחר: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Kahana the son of Rav Hinena the Elder recited: A loaf which was baked together with roast [meat] in an oven may not be eaten with kutah. A fish was roasted [i.e., baked] together with meat, [whereupon] Raba of Parzikia forbade it to be eaten with kutah {Milkshik}. Mar B<code>R</code>Ashi said: Even with salt too it is forbidden, because it is harmful to [one's] smell and in respect of 'something else.' {harm of mixture of meat and fish}.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3>In conclusion.</h3>\n\n<p>It seems that the Talmud concludes according to the view of Rav. Two foods coocked in a same oven gives taste one to another, but not if they are in separated containers.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Tosfot said in Name of Rabenu Tam rules explicitly as Rav, but specifie that in a great oven, the taste of the odour is not sufficient from the halachic point of view. The rule is only for small oven and non-covered food (similarly to 2 containers) </li>\n<li>But Rashi ruled as Levi because of the view of Rava in Masechet Avoda Zara (<a href=\"http://dtorah.com/otzar/shas_daf.php?ms=Avodah-Zarah&df=66b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">66b</a>), which is congruent to Levi opinion.</li>\n<li>Shulchan Aruch and Rama <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x4322\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 108, 1</a> rules as Levi Bedieved, and enumerate several conditions in which we allow Lechatechilla.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>The OP is about</h3>\n\n<p><code>the same smoker may be used (at different times, with cleaning) for both milchigs and fleischigs</code></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Rema <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x4322\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 108, 1</a> said that, for a non simultaneous utilisation of the oven, when there is no \"perspiration/exsudation\", it is allowed for a standart oven.

Additionnally, if there is zea, may be that the coldness of the process may not extract taste from foods themselves, but only product a kind of smoke.</p>\n\n\n",

I am writing a novel based in part on her experiences.  Based on my research so far, it seems to me that her uncle would have had to \"sell\" the inn to a gentile before the sabbath and \"buy\" it back from the gentile afterward, every week, in order to profit from weekend traffic.  It seems this was commonly done; whether everyone agreed that it was permissible I don't know, but apparently they did it. I am wondering if it would have been permissible for a gentile servant to perform this function. And also would a servant have been a shabbas goy too.

Others (including some early authorities and Aruch Hashulchan, Chachmas Adam, Chasam Sofer, sourced in the article) would say that in this case, Chalav Yisrael is still required by Halacha.</p>\n<p>To repeat, according to many Poskim, in certain cases such as non-Kosher milk being not readily available, these opinions hold that one may go and buy non-Jewish milk, and they consider it Chalav Akum, in no way witnessed by a Jew, but still permissible to drink.  I have quoted one of the major Matirim, the Peri Chadash YD 115:6.

    "content": "# Is it possible to have Yiras Shomayim but not subscribe to Orthodox Halachic practices?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question came up in a discussion and I guess is a topic up for debate. The questions are.</p>\n\n<p>(1) What is the definition of Yiras Shomayim?</p>\n\n<p>(2) Based on that definition, is it possible to not subscribe to normative Orthodox Halachic practices and still posses it?</p>\n\n<p>I'm looking for sources for the definition of (1) and then see if anything can be implied from that definition to answer (2)</p>\n\n<p>Thanks</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to the Mesilas Yesharim (beginning of ch. 24), there are 2 major divisions of yir'ah, of which one is subdivided.</p>\n\n<p>1- Yir’as ha’onesh: fear of punishment. This is the lowest of the three. However, since even fear of punishment is a motivator, even yir’as ha’onesh is viewed positively.</p>\n\n<p>R’ Shlomo Wolbe zt”l writes that today, we’ve lost that motivating quality. Punishment invokes more thoughts of rebellion than of compliance. He therefore bans corporal punishment of children, and also plays down the role of yir’as ha’onesh a generation raised on democracy, rights, and personal freedoms.</p>\n\n<p>2- Yir’as Shamayim: fear of [the One in] heaven</p>\n\n<p>This is the lofty goal. It, in turn, comes in two flavors:</p>\n\n<p>2a- Yir’as hacheit: fear of sin. This is distinct from the fear of punishment; it’s fear of the sin itself, of the possibility of erring. Mesilas Yesharim continues that when a traditional source speaks of “yir’ah” without specification, it means yir’as hacheit (fear of the sin [itself]).</p>\n\n<p>2b- Yir’as haRomemus: fear of the Grandeur [of G-d]</p>\n\n<p>Note that as the Ramchal progresses, the translation for yir’ah as “fear” becomes steadily less compelling, and that of awe, or acting with awareness of the magnitude of what one is engaging in, seem more appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramchal writes that the default meaning of yir'as Shamayim is yir'as hacheit. The name of the middah in the beraisa he bases Mesilas Yesharim on is \"yir'as hachait\" and that is reflected in the names of the relevant chapters.</p>\n\n<p>To explain how fear of sin and awe of Divine grandeur are aspects of the same thing, the Ramchal writes (adapted from R' S Simmons zt\"l's translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It consists in a person's constantly\n  fearing and worrying that some trace of sin might have intruded itself into his actions or that they\n  contain something, small or great, which is inconsonant with the grandeur of HQBH's\n  honor and with the majesty of His Name. Here we see the strong relationship between yir'as hacheit\n  and fear of yir'as haromemus - their common concern being that one do nothing in opposition to the\n  great Majesty of HQBH.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it would seem that by definition, someone cannot both reject halakhah and have yir'as Shamayim. But that's rejection, a rebellious turn away from what they would accept as G-d's Will if they were being intellectually honest with themselves.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, why couldn't someone who was raised or honestly erred and was misled into having a different value system still fear that some action is out of consonance with Hashem's Will, while not sharing Orthodox beliefs about what that will for us contains? They may have the application of the middah misplaced, but that's a matter of knowledge, not middos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>the Rambam writes in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940230/jewish/Positive-Commandment-4.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">sefer hamitzvot</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The 4th mitzvah is that we are commanded to establish in our minds\n  fear and dread of G‑d (exalted be He); that we not be calm and\n  nonchalant, but be constantly concerned of imminent punishment. The\n  biblical source of this is, \"You shall fear G‑d your Lord.\" (Devarim\n  6:13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hence one who does not care to follow orthodox halacha (shulchan aruch,etc) which is just the practical rulings of the commandments cannot be called God fearing. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Yir'at Shamayim is fear from the \"not true\", which is not physically perceptible and without consequences (at least if nobody from our physical word can). Only \"Who is in heaven\" sees.</p>\n<p>A man which makes something because it is true has Yir'at Shamayim.</p>\n<p><em>An example:</em>  At the second world war, there was some people, not Jews who saved Jewish people, against law, against common opinion, in spite of the clear and present danger, with no expectation of a future reward, because it was right.</p>\n<p>People like this give a good example of Yir'at Shamayim. If you think that something is true, you feel duty to make it. This is Yir'at Shamayim.</p>\n<p>Some people does not understand the righteousness of orthopractice, but may be that concerning certain issues they understand, they have Yir'at Shamayim. Fairness concerning money needs a greater Yir'at Shamayim then certain ortho. practices.</p>\n<p>I heard in name of <strong>Rav Shlomo Wolbe Zatsal</strong>, that non-religious, but upright and honest people have Yir'at Shamayim in some extent.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/70863/9215\">here</a></p>\n<p>Mesilat Yesharim, introduction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה הכתוב אומר (איוב כח כח): \"הן יראת ה' היא חכמה\", ואמרו רבותינו ז\"ל (שבת לא, ב): \"\"הן\" אחת, שכן בלשון יוני קורין ל\"אחת\" הן\". הרי שהיראה היא חכמה, והיא לבדה חכמה, וודאי שאין נקרא חכמה מה שאין בו עיון.‏</p>\n<p>The verse says: Ene fear of G-d is wisdom. And Chachamim said Ene : \"1\", because in Greek language Ene is \"One\". So fear of G-d is wisdom, it is the only wisdom...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we spent a few minutes to understand this statement, we see that wisdom, (or knowledge) is the fact that something not apparent will being a part of the reality for the Chacham. So Yir'at Hashem is to see righteousness as consideration to an invisible reality. To explain in a more detailed way is very hard for me.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the justification for not requiring \"chalav Yisrael\" cooking equipment for those who don't hold by R' Moshe's leniency?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As Shalom explained in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31843/1713\">his answer</a> to a question about <em>chalav Yisrael</em> milk, R' Moshe Feinstein ruled that in countries where the local government regulations are sufficient to ensure that cow's milk is not tainted with the milk of non-kosher animals, any milk can be considered <em>chalav Yisrael</em> even if there was no Jew supervising the milking of the animals.</p>\n\n<p>Not everybody accepts this leniency and those who do not are careful to only consume dairy products whose production was directly supervised by a Jew. Logically, those who do not accept the leniency would consider the dairy to be completely non-kosher (as Shalom said, \"Today we speak of 'chalav ha-companies', or 'chalav stam', which means: 'milk whose status is viewed as chalav yisrael by some, and chalav akum by others'\").</p>\n\n<p>Yet I know that there are people who do not accept R' Moshe's leniency about <em>chalav stam</em> being kosher, though they are not careful to avoid dairy products served, prepared, or cooked on equipment that has been used for <em>chalav stam</em>. What is the justification for eating <em>chalav stam</em>-equipment foods if <em>chalav stam</em> is considered not kosher?</p>\n\n<p>(I asked this question to someone I know who does this and he said he doesn't know how it's justified. He does it because he otherwise wouldn't be able to eat at his in-laws' house so his <em>rav</em> gave him permission).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Most people who are careful not to rely on <em>Rav Moshe</em>'s leniency do so not because they don't hold of it but only because he advised that people of superior spiritual stature avoid relying on it. I conjecture as follows. Other, standard leniencies (e.g., <em>lifgam</em>) very often apply to cases of using equipment, so even such people combine those leniencies with <em>Rav Moshe</em>'s in the vast majority of cases (even if they wouldn't rely on the other leniencies alone). And this led them to simply not worry about the minority of cases where <em>Rav Moshe</em>'s is the only leniency applicable.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to those who simply do not hold of <em>Rav Moshe</em>'s leniency at all, obviously the preceding doesn't apply. However, in my experience with such people, they don't, in fact, rely on <em>Rav Moshe</em>'s leniency for equipment, either. I have had guests for whom I've kashered equipment for this reason.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Kamentesky actually addresses this question in his Emes L'Yaakov on Shulchan Aruch, 115 (p. 308).\nHe writes that the keilim are fine since it is comparable to the case that the Rama brings in YD 64:9, about a certain fat which contained questionable kashrus. The Rama allowed those who were stringent regarding the fat to eat from the utensils of those who were lenient about the fat in question. </p>\n\n<p>If you look on the bottom in the footnotes, you will see that Rav Yaakov also held that one who is stringent can give shaloch manos of non chalav yisrael to someone who is lenient. It should also be noted that Rav Yaakov himself was only lenient is very special need cases.</p>\n\n<p>Text :</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1vHgL.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n\n",

His reasoning:</p>\n\n<p>It began when Eldad and Meidad prophesied in the camp. Yehoshua suggests to Moshe that these men be imprisoned, to which Moshe, in a display of humility says, \"If only ALL of the nation were prophets.\"</p>\n\n<p>His brother and sister speak <em>lashon hara</em> about Moshe, and Moshe does not respond. Perhaps, knowing that Moshe would not respond, because he was so humble, was an incentive for them to do this. Seeing a lack of response, perhaps, led to:</p>\n\n<p>Korach and his men causing the uprising. Had Moses not been so humble and demonstrated a command of his leadership with Eldad and Meidad, instead, there's a chance that Korach's rising may not have occurred.</p>\n\n<p>Did Ramba\"m take note of any of the above situations regarding Moshe and either based on this analysis, or for any other reason state, somewhere else, that a leader of a nation or important group should on occasion NOT demonstrate humility?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> A possible answer could include any other source that analyzed the above situations with Moshe and disagreed with Rambam's principle.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> Answers should relate specifically to analyzing Moshe's behavior and not regarding a general rule of how others should behave in similar situations.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>end of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911561/jewish/Talmud-Torah-Chapter-Seven.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">hilchot talmud torah</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When does the above apply?

Instead, he should seek vengeance and carry enmity\n  over the matter like a snake until the offender requests to be\n  pardoned. Then, he should forgive him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>btw, Moses' absolute humility was due to being so close to God. this is something that comes naturally to one who is in contact with God so closely.see <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/audio/cord1.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>. when man is in such close contact with God he realizes just how small he really is.</p>\n\n\n",

Would you run the nun at the end of בן together with the one at the beginning of נון, as an exception to the general rule that we don't run words together (Brachot 15b)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The masoretic treatise Kitāb al-Khilaf (ספר החילופים) by Misha'el ben `Uzziel records the differences (and similarities) between the famous masoretes Ben Asher and Ben Naftali. The book records that the dagesh in בן-נּון is the opinion of Ben Naftali, against that of Ben Asher, whose opinions formed the Biblical <em>textus receptus</em> following Rambam. Thus the dagesh in בן-נּון is a well-founded, but non-standard, bona fide masoretic phenomenon. See p. 20 of Lipschütz's <a href=\"http://www.hum.huji.ac.il/upload/_FILE_1371985082.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kitāb al-Khilaf, The Book of the Ḥillufim</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On the word-initial dagesh following a consonant, see my comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/91369/1499\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Masorete בן נפתלי, who we don’t follow, added the dagesh, likely as an easier way to separate the נ from the preceding ן.</p>\n<p>בן אשר, who we do follow, was usually more conservative than בן נפתלי, and he didn’t add this dagesh to his codices.</p>\n<p>So our מנהג—which, in this case, is almost certainly the older one—is not to have a Dagesh in this נ. Instead, we make a small but clear separation between the two words, as you mentioned in the last sentence of your question.</p>\n<p>However, if a בעל קורא were to find this difficult for some reason, and were better able to pronounce the phrase according to the dagesh of בן נפתלי, it seems that he shouldn’t be corrected for it, as long as he makes the dagesh very clear on the second נ, and the LACK of dagesh very clear on the first ן.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the flow of Divine goodness from a Bracha flow upwards or horizontally?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In short: I once read an explanation of Ramchal that HaShem didn't create the world for His own benefit, because He doesn't need anything, so all that He had created must have been created for 'another'. A lot of commentaries speak about HaShem being Kulo Tov, (He is completely, absolutely, perfectly etc. Good). And Ramak teaches that one who is inherently good, does good. So the conclusion of all this was that HaShem created to world to bestow His Goodness.</p>\n<p>Anyway, now I came across an explanation regarding the term 'Bracha', which stated that this term is related to the term Breicha, meaning a flowing stream, or source of water; and by such it is interpreted as a stream of Divine goodness flowing downward into the world.</p>\n<p>HaShem is the source of all blessings. When we say <em>Birkat HaMazon</em>, the grace after the meal, we acknowledge that all our blessings emanate from Him, and we thank Him for all the goodness we receive on a constant basis. When we express a bracha, it facilitates a Divine flow of blessings upon us from Above. We acknowledge that all our blessings in life come from the Ultimate source of all blessings.</p>\n<p>All our brachot (often recited starting with the words Baruch Atah) seem to affirm this view. But looking at the Tenach we see HaShem bless man, man bless HaShem, and man bless man. How should I understand this stream of divine goodness? How is it able to flow from man to G'd and man to man?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My grandfather, Rav Eliezer Ben David explains that it goes from us up and then back down (you can find this concept in various places in the Zohar such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Tzav.14.104-15.105\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzav 31b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Vayeilech.7.38\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayelech 285b</a>).</p>\n<p>He explains this from the verse \"what does Hashem ask from you\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.10.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">D'varim 10:12</a>).

The word used here is \"שואל\" which can translate as borrow (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.22.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'mot 22:13</a>) as opposed to other words meaning ask (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Micah.6.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Michah 6:8</a>).

Neither has a direct connection to blessings that we make. The blessings serve to express gratitude to Hashem or to people around us, not necessarily for received goodness but also for ability to provide own goodness, do mitzvos, etc. Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.35a.19-35b.1?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 35a-b</a> confirms this fact. Where the tannaim argue, is whether the lack of such הכרת הטוב can be viewed as an <em>aveira</em> which damages the divine שפע and the will of other people. Alternatively, one can look at blessings as a mitzvah which opens new channels of divine שפע and strengthens people around us to inspire to do good deeds.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>It is not clear that shepha beracha comes from Hashem since Hashem handed the koach ha'beracha to the avos.</p>\n\n<p>Es asher tevorech etc.</p>\n\n<p>I.e. shepha is like a tide of water that comes down through the generations which has caused our continuation till today.</p>\n\n<p>The question is how do you tap into it?</p>\n\n<p>Probably by identifying with the cause of the continuation of klal yisrael in some way.</p>\n\n\n",

These had been married by their respective half-brothers, sons of different mothers. According to the opinion of Rabbi Nechemyah, all the sons married wives of Canaanite origin. If he were correct, why does the Torah in our verse not speak of “all his daughter-in-law?“ Rabbi Nechemyah, aware of this, would reply, that in the whole world daughters-in-law are referred to as daughters. (B‘reshit Rabbah 84,21) [Naomi, in the Book of Ruth, certainly is not described as calling her daughters-in-law, “daughters.” Ed.] It is difficult to understand Rabbi Nechemyah, as we all know to what length Avraham had gone to prevent Yitzchok from marrying a wife of Canaanite descent. Yitzchok too had commanded Yaakov not to marry a woman of Canaanite descent and had sent him all the way to Charan to avoid such a union. (Genesis 28,1) Nonetheless, Yehudah married a woman of Canaanite descent. (Genesis 38,2 ברת גבר תגרא, (daughter of a business man, according to Onkelos איש כנעני means business man, traveling salesman) Onkelos therefore accepts the view of Rabbi Yehudah, who said that twin daughters were born with all of Yaakov’s sons.) This is also how we have to understand Genesis 46,10: ושאול בן הכנענית, “and Sha-ul, son of a female merchant.” According to Rabbi Nechemyah’s approach to the subject, there is no need for what sound like far fetched solutions to our problem. The word כנעני or כנענית in either of the verses that bothered us, are simply understood as elsewhere in the Bible, as people of Canaanite descent. We do have a problem if we accept Rabbi Yehudah’s interpretation, an interpretation lacking specific sources in the written text. The Talmud, tractate Yumah folio 28, states that Avaraham had voluntarily observed all the commandments in the written and oral Torah, even including the rabbinic commandment known as eyruv tavshilin, a method of how to prepare food when the day after a festival is a Sabbath, and preparation of food on the festival for the Sabbath is not admissible. He is also supposed to have observed the law of yibbum, marrying the widow of a brother who died without having ever had any children. (Compare Genesis 38,8) where Yehudah, Er’s father, gave Er’s widow Tamar to Onan, his brother, as a wife, in order for him to become posthumously and vicariously a father. If these laws were operative prior to the Torah having been revealed at Mount Sinai to the Jewish people, how could Yaakov have married two sisters while the first sister had still been alive? Also, how could any of the sons of Yaakov have married their sisters? We could answer that although these laws were already known by tradition since Avraham’s time, they had not become obligatory until after revealed at Mount Sinai. Our forefathers were free to choose the parts of the commandments they wished to observe voluntarily even they had been privy to them through the Holy Spirit. When the Talmud in Pessachim, folio 119, tells us that in the future (afterlife) at the meal prepared by G–d for the righteous, that when Yaakov was being honoured presiding over the grace after the meal, he declined the honour, saying that seeing he had wed two sisters while both were alive, he was not worthy of that honour. Clearly he considered what he had done as having been improper. It is possible to argue that having been aware that what he had done would qualify for a penalty if he would do so after the revelation at Mount Sinai, he felt that he deserved at least a minor penalty. If he decided in favour of committing an act deserving of a minor penalty, he did so because he wished to marry only wives who were personally righteous, and these were hard to find, especially considering the age at which he had a chance to get married. As it turned out, even one of these two sisters who was a righteous woman did not by herself bore for him all the twelve tribes.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Cup-K reliable?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've recently seen a hashgacha around NYC called Cup-K or CupK. However, I have been able to find precious little about it and what I have found seems mostly to consist of unsubstiatable rumours. Does anyone have any knowledge of the reliability of this hashgacha? FWIW, it's the one formerly used by the famous Second Avenue Deli and  currently certifying famous vegan restaurant Buddha Bodai.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8kgbX.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/8kgbX.jpg\" alt=\"Cup-K image\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Your question seems to beg two things - Is it reliable, as well as some info about the hashgacha.\nAs for info, I located <a href=\"http://www.thanksaglatt.com/news/rabbi-israel-mayer-steinberg-of-vaad-harabonim-lemeshmeret-hakashrut/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> about the supervising rabbi, Rabbi Israel Mayer Steinberg of Vaad Harabonim Lemeshmeret Hakashrut, as well as <a href=\"http://forward.com/news/israel/12725/2nd-ave-deli-cooks-up-controversy-01325/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> that focuses a bit more specifically on the 2nd Ave. Deli.</p>\n\n<p>The controversy, as I understand it, relates to whether a place that is open on Shabbat can be considered kosher?</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Steinberg states that the 2nd Ave. Deli has been sold to a non-Jew on Shabbat, thus, he claims that this would avoid the concern for those that won't eat in a place run by a non Shabbat observant Jew. I can't state how well this rule works both in general as well as regarding the 2nd Ave. Deli. They may have other specific kashrut problems, in general, that are unrelated to the Shabbat issue.</p>\n\n<p>As for another place called \"Littlelads\", which no longer exists, that place was vegan. I had eaten there several times, unaware that there was a Shomer-Shabbat and mashgiach temidi issue. So, obviously, my actions and opinion, on this place are based on ignorance.</p>\n\n<p>In general, I am uncertain if a place being Shomer Shabbat is an absolute requirement for a place to be kosher. I know that most certifying agencies won't certify such a place. We know that a large piece of kosher certification in the U.S. is political. Essentially, Rabbi Steinberg is using a less-favored opinion that states that a place can remain open on Shabbat and still remain kosher because it's not Jewishly owned on Shabbat. </p>\n\n<p>What I will try to research further is if Rabbi Steinberg certifies places that are owned by non-Shomer-Shabbat Jews that DON'T sell their store. That adds another piece to the \"puzzle\". However, even in this case, I'm not sure if being non-shomer-Shabbat would invalidate the actual kashrut of a restaurant assuming that the food is kosher, and, if they had a mashgiach temidi, which even many certified establishments don't have.</p>\n\n<p>In short, we have a interesting vagueness...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20200725223557/http://www.thanksaglatt.com/hechsher-directory/hechsher-directory/#Cup-K\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cup-K</a> shows the citation below. Note the Stringency line (<strong>Conservative</strong>) on the hechsher listing. This would raise a question in my mind.</p>\n<p>One  question would be what is done on Shabat and could the non-Jew bring in food then to cook. Is it like a franchise that can only use franchise provided food (that is always under supervision) like Carvel or certain Yogurt places or like a regular restaurant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cup-K</p>\n<p>Under the supervision of Rabbi Israel Mayer Steinberg of Vaad\nHarabonim Lameshmeret Hakashrut.</p>\n<p>Stringency: Conservative (Restaurants open on Shabbat)</p>\n<p>Restaurants:</p>\n<pre><code>Bhojan – New York City\nLoving Hut – New York City (Penn Station)\n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I happened to just now pass by this place called Eden kosher in Yonkers. Prominently displayed in their window is a kosher certificate from cup k. Intrigued I walked into the place and walked right out after seeing the Hebrew National cold cuts. I have no vendetta against anyone and I'm not telling anyone what to do I'm just a simple frum guy and nobody's rabbi, but this certification fails the standards of anybody who actually bothers to verify a hechsher.</p>\n\n\n",

If the tour is not for the sake of worshipping, but simply goes because people think it's beautiful, and further if that is only part of the travel package, which includes flights, visits to other places in Asia and more, would that be allowed? I mention the point about it only being part of the offer because I believe we allow people to get paid for work on Shabbat (e.g. chazanut, security guard services etc) if that's included in a general payment rather than being specifically for Shabbat services. </p>\n\n\n",

Yosef Qafih</a> speaks at length about the value of manuscripts. Here is one excerpted paragraph, where he explains that very often manuscripts have textual variants that can simply resolve various problems:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עם הבדיקה והגהת הנוסח נוכחתי פעם נוספת עד כמה מוצדקת הפעולה ועד כמה\n  הכרחי הדבר להחזיר עטרה לישנה להוציא דבר מתוקן ולא ללכת בדרך הכבושה אשר\n  לסטים קודמים כבשוה כלשון חז\"ל (ערובין נג ב) המדפיסים עם חזרות על אותם\n  השבושים אשר נתקעו בדפוסים הראשונים רבות עתים דנו המפרשים פלפלו ארוכות\n  בדברי רבנו ועם קביעת הנוסה הנכון אזדו להו כל אותם הפלפולים התירוצים\n  והישובים והיו כלא היו  ולא אימנע מלהזכיר כאן אמרת אמת אשר שמעתי מאחד\n  מזקני תימן הוא היה אומר את דברי הרמב\"ם אין צורך לתרץ אלא להבין פעמים\n  רבות שינוי קל לא של משפט לא של מלה אלא של אות אחת בלבד ובה מתישבים\n  הרבה קושיות ונעלמים הרבה פלפולים לדוגמא בהלכות עבודה זרה פ\"ד הל' יג\n  קדשי בדק הבית יפדו ואחר כך שורפים אותם שנ' שללה ולא שלל שמים על הלכה\n  זו סערו סער כל משליכי בים התלמוד חכה הללו מקשים והללו מתרצים החל\n  מהראב\"ד ועד ימינו אנו אמאי שורפיו אותם הרי שלל שמים הם ועוד מאי קראה\n  שללה ולא שלל שמים הרי לדבריו אפלו שלל שמים ואלו אספתי כל מה שנאמר סביב\n  דין זה יש בו כדי ספרובאמת הכאח הנכון בכתבי יד תימן שורפין אותה ומוסב\n  על עיר הנדחת ולא על קדשי בדק הבית שני חורים קטנים במם הסופית אחד למטה\n  ואחד מן הצד ופתרו כל הבעיא הקולות יחדלון וגם כל העם על מקומו יבא שלום</p>\n  \n  <p>As I studied and emended the text, I was again convinced of the\n  rightness of the activity, and how imperative it is to return the\n  crown to its ancient glory, to publish something that has been\n  corrected, and not, as our sages said (Eruvin 53b), to \"walk on a path\n  which has been trodden by thieves\" who reprint the same mistakes that\n  they copy from earlier editions. Often commentators engaged in lengthy\n  pilpul regarding Maimonides’ words, but with the correct text these\n  arguments and explanations are obviated and nullified. I cannot\n  refrain from repeating a true statement that I heard from one of the\n  elders of Yemen. He used to say, \"the words of Maimonides need no\n  explanation, simply comprehension.\" Many times a simple change (not of\n  a sentence or a word, but just a single letter) will settle many\n  questions and eliminate much pilpul. For example, Avoda Zara, Chapter\n  Four, Halacha 13: \"The offerings for the repair of the Temple may be\n  redeemed, and afterwards they are burned [<em>sorfim otam</em>], as the Torah\n  [tr. Deut. 13:17] says ‘booty’ and not ‘the booty of heaven’.\" A storm\n  raged about this halacha among all those who cast a hook into the sea\n  of the Talmud, some challenging and some explaining, starting with the\n  Rabad and continuing to our day. \"How could they be burned if they\n  were ‘booty of heaven’? Why did he call it ‘booty’ rather than ‘booty\n  of heaven’ if according to him, it applies even to ‘booty of heaven’?\"\n  If I assembled everything written on this question it would fill a\n  book. In fact, the correct text in the Yemenite manuscripts is <em>sorfim\n  otah</em>, \"<em>it</em> is burned,\" and \"it\" refers to the subverted city and not to\n  the offerings for the repair of the Temple. Two small holes in the\n  final mem, one at the bottom and one at the side, and the whole\n  problem is solved, the arguments can stop and the entire people may\n  rest peacefully.

A good example of this would be the Aleppo codex, which is now housed in Jerusalem. This text represents the best extant text of Tanakh. Other early masoretic texts describe early textual traditions of Tanakh.</p>\n\n<p>Many Talmud versions today show various differences caused for various reasons: copyist mistakes, censorship, etc. Examination of old manuscripts show us what books of Talmud looked like before some of these changes occurred. </p>\n\n<p>While Christian sources may have historically obtained manuscripts as a means of censorship, it is certainly not the case today. Many manuscripts from the Vatican and elsewhere have been published and can be accessed by scholars. Since we have this access (physically, or through facsimile or digitized versions), I imagine any research could be performed using them.</p>\n\n\n",

In או''ח סימן נה סעיף ו he says that it is ok to say קדיש whilst someone there is sleeping or saying שמונה עשרה and there are only 10 people in the room including that person. However, in סימן קכד סעיף ד he says that if there aren't 9 people responding to חזרת הש''ץ, it is almost a ברכה לבטלה. I am aware of three approaches to this issue.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The דרישה in קכד,א says that the שולחן ערוך says <strong>almost</strong> for a reason.  Less than 9 answering should be avoided but is OK. He also brings a proof from the הלכה in סימן נה סעיף ב that you can continue דברים שבקדושה when people walk out in the middle and you are left without a מנין. Based on that proof, he would be ok with any more than 6 people including חזן.</li>\n<li>מגן אברהם in סימן נה סעיף קטן ח says that we are not נוהג like the שולחן ערוך says in סימן קכד. He doesn't exactly answer for the contradiction we had but gives a פסק. Notably, he adds that מהר''ל אבן חביב was ok with any more than 6 including the חזן for חזרת הש''ץ but the מגן אברהם himself doesn't like it  and says you need 9 including חזן.</li>\n<li>The שולחן ערוך הרב in סימן נה סעיף ז says that there is no contradiction because for חזרת הש''ץ you need 10 but only for קדיש and other דברים שבקדושה is less ok.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So there are a range of views.

Couldn't God himself just do it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A better way to formulate your question is that one passuk (verse) says Hashem will do it (Shemos 12:12 - \"And I [Hashem] will pass over Egypt...\") and another has an internal contradiction whether the Mashchis/Destroyer will do it or whether Hashem will (12:23 - \"And Hashem will pass over to strike Egypt...and He will not give the destroyer permission to enter your houses to strike.\").</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>Ramban</strong> (to 12:23) explains that the latter passuk merely means that while Hashem is attacking the Egyptians, He will not let the Mashchis, who will be out doing his business elsewhere in the world, to come anywhere close to Mitzraim, where Hashem Himself will be doing the smiting.</li>\n<li>The <strong>Chizkuni</strong> (to 12:23) explains that the passuk means that Hashem will personally escort the destroyers to Mitzraim, and they will attack the firstborn. \"I and not a Malach\" (angel) of 12:12 thus means \"I and not <em>only</em> a Malach.\" </li>\n<li>The <strong>Da'as Zekeinim</strong> (to 12:23) gives this same explanation, though IMO a little more clearly. He, however, seems to take it as a given that Hashem wouldn't go to attack Mitzraim without the Malachim. Not sure why that's so clear.sut</li>\n<li>The <strong>Ha'amek Davar</strong> (to 12:12) says exactly the opposite explanation: not that the malachim attack and Hashem is there for the show of glory, but that Hashem is attacking and the Malachim are secondary to Hashem to help. He seems to be learning \"I and not an angel\" as \"I <em>primarily</em> and not an angel <em>primarily</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Shemos Rabbah</strong> (17:5) has exactly this doubt: \"Some say [the attacking was done] through a Malach, and some say [it was] through Hashem Himself. [According to the latter view,] what does it mean that [the passuk] says \"[He will not give permission to the Destroyer to enter your houses] to strike\"? ... The Destroyer went and attacked whatever he could find.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>That God didn't do something doesn't mean that He <em>couldn't</em>.  God is all-powerful; clearly He can do anything He chooses to do.  But we see a lesser form of this with powerful-but-not-omnipotent people, too: parents, managers, and leaders all sometimes tell others to do things they could well do themselves.  Why?  Because they see some benefit in having the other do the task.  Along similar lines, then, why could God not see value in having the angel of death, other angels, or people do things that He clearly could do himself?</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a strong case of this is with the <em>mitzvot</em>.  Does God need us to do them?  We can't do anything that God could not do Himself, and yet He commands us anyway.  If it makes sense for God to direct <em>our</em> actions, then surely it makes sense for Him to direct the actions of beings with no independent thought or will.</p>\n\n<p>(This is my own reasoning.)</p>\n\n\n",

It explains that B'nai Israel tested G-d 10 times in total in the desert, but G-d did not punish them until they spoke <em>lashon hara</em> about the land of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Then, Avot Derabbi Natan uses a <em>kal vachomer</em> stating that if they were punished for speaking about land, that has no mouth, how much more so should the punishment be for speaking lashon hara about a human?</p>\n\n<p>I understand the <em>kal vachomer</em>, itself. But, I have some follow-up questions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If the Mishnah uses a <em>kal vachomer</em>, people are not killed for speaking lashon hara about other humans. How is this a kal vachomer?</li>\n<li>The last paragraph in the Mishnah (as shown on the web page) seems to be incongruent. Earlier, the Mishnah lists all 10 tests. These were tests that all of Bnei Yisra'el did as a group. Then, he quotes a verse saying \"They tested me 10 times\". I assume the word \"they\" refers to all B'nei Yisra'el, not just the 10 spies. But when discussing the punishment for lashon hara, it mentions the verse relating that only the spies died, not all of B'nei Yisra'el. If the Mishnah wanted to compare things, why doesn't it list a verse related to the punishment of the people dying in the desert over the course of 40 years?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The kal v'chomer would seem to be: speaking lashon hara about Eretz Yisrael may not even be a formal prohibition (not listed in <em>Sefer Chofetz Chaim</em>), but it still carried a severe punishment.

When somewhat is demonstrated, you need not to demonstrate again and again. When Rishonim builded \"scholastic Hebrew\", they called demonstration \"Mofet\" for logic demonstration.

The world in its \"natural\" form is good, and is a will of G-d. And is good for non-miscreant persons.

    "content": "# Does a mezuzah require a case?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Several websites that I have researched say that a mezuzah parchment must be protected from dampness and at least should be have a plastic film on the outside, i.e. it can not be completely inserted into a plastic bag. (See <a href=\"http://www.stam.net/how-to-hang-a-mezuzah.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Most places recommend placing the mezuzah into a case (made of ceramic, wood, etc.). I assume that the case makes it easier to secure and also provides extra protection.</p>\n\n<p>The only place I can recall having seen a mezuzah on the wall without a case was in my friend's work place. My friend is Orthodox, and I assume that he knew this was OK. But then, again, I have also read opinions that since one's office is not a permanent residence, one is not required to have any mezuzah in is office. So, it's possible that he may have just had it there to be \"decorative\", and it wouldn't really matter halachically in his case (no pun of the word, here) if he used a case.</p>\n\n<p>Halachically, is the case absolutely required? Can one roll the parchment, and just secure the parchment to the wall using tape or any other method that would make it secure?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>No. The Gemara in Bava Metzi'a 101b-102a says that one could take a mezuzah scroll, tie it in a string, and attach the string to the top of the door frame and leave the scroll dangling at the appropriate height without a case.</p>\n\n<p>That's how a plain reading of the sugya indicates. @user6591 pointed out, though, that Tosfos learns that it means hanging it on a little shelf in a reed tube to keep it steady.</p>\n\n<p>@Chaim added that the Pischei Teshuvah (OC 285:4), based on Sha'alos U'teshuvos R' Akiva Eiger, holds one may not kiss the Mezuzah in the event that it's uncovered.

Legend has it that he made a gift of the potato plant to Queen Elizabeth I (1533-1603). The local gentry were invited to a royal banquet featuring the potato in every course. Unfortunately, the cooks were uneducated in the matter of potatoes, tossed out the lumpy-looking tubers and brought to the royal table a dish of boiled stems and leaves (which are poisonous), which promptly made everyone deathly ill.

Thus, via the lashon hara Bnei Yisrael did not just get punished\n  for this sin, but in essence for parts of the previous sins too;\n  HaShem says (14;22) ‘they tested Me ten times,’ (referring to the ten\n  sins Bnei Yisrael did in the desert) since they now get punished for\n  the complete unit of ten past sins due to this lashon hara. This might\n  also be the explanation of a complicated Rashi (14;33) which says that\n  when Bnei Yisrael sinned at the golden calf, HaShem decided the decree\n  of wandering around for 40 years in the desert, but waited until the\n  sin of the spies to utilise it.

Doing one  mitsva in the hope that a wish came true. The text is hard to read. I will provide a summary which describes clearly the question to which the Peri Haarets responds:</p>\n\n<p>Three of the Chazal sentences used in the Peri Haarets are listed bellow.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>R'Johanan met the young son of Resh Lakish and said to him, 'Recite\n  to me the Bible verse [you have learnt to-day].</p>\n  \n  <p>The latter replied, 'Thou shalt surely tithe', at the same time\n  asking, 'What may be the meaning of these words? ' R'Johanan answered,\n  'Give tithes that you may be enriched'.</p>\n  \n  <p>The boy then asked, 'Whence do you adduce this? ' R'Johanan replied:\n  'Go test it [for yourself]'.</p>\n  \n  <p>The boy thereupon asked: Is it permissible to try the Holy One,\n  blessed be He, seeing that it is written, Ye shall not try the\n  Lord? -R'Johanan replied: Thus said R'Oshaia: The case of\n  tithe-giving is excepted [from the prohibition], as it is said, Bring\n  ye the whole tithe unto the storehouse, th there may be food in My\n  house, and try Me now herewith, saith the Lord of Hosts, if I will not\n  open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that\n  there shall be more than sufficiency.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>It has been taught: 'If a man says, offer this sela' for charity in\n  order that my children may live and in order that through it I may\n  merit the future world, he may still be a wholly righteous man? '</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>[if a man says to a woman, be thou betrothed unto me]  on condition\n  that I am righteous,' even if he is absolutely wicked, she is\n  betrothed, for he may have meditated repentance in his thoughts.'</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The first case deals with the strenght of a Mitsva; the second say that this practice is quite correct; the third that the link between a simple man and Tsidkut and Tshuva is far from unlikely:</p>\n\n<p>When a man did a Mitsva in the hope to be answered in his prayer, this is a sign that this man has a great faith. His faith is that the Mistva is a part of something which was previous to the world by a causal relation, something in which the word itself is included. He is clausely linked to this thing. He \"knows\" that somewhat in a Mitsva is very strong. He follows through Mitsva accomplishment an inner conviction which attract him toward the \"first intent of Hashem\" concerning creation. So we see a paradox, he has not been unselfish, but somewhat in his behavior demonstrate that he adheres (not artificiality) to the true nature of mitsva. </p>\n\n<p>I am not sure that I can understand more that this fragmentary explanation up today. But it is clear for me that an accurate lecture of the Peri Haarets may help to a better answer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is no issue with doing a mitzvah with the hope that the mitzvah will give you some benefit or be a merit for some other supplication.

Two explanations are given. The first is concerning the similarity between the table and Mizbeach (the altar of the Mishkan and Mikdash), which could not touch iron while being constructed, because the Mizbeach lengthens life while iron (swords) shorten it. The second explanation is that once, when blessing Boneh Yerushalayim, a man remembered the Temple destruction, and stabbed himself with a knife. Despite that the second explanation does not make a difference between Shabbat and Yom Tov and the week days, the custom is to cover the knife on week days only. He summarized this rule for week days in Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Magen Avraham <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x998\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sk 4</a> explained that the first explanation concerns the construction of Mizbeach, and at Shabbat and Yom Tov we are prohibited to build anything, so there is not allusion to mizbeach.

I don't know if some people nowadays have the custom reported in Levush (that seems linked to Shibole Haleket) to cover the knife before birkat hamazon even on Shabbat and Yom Tov. Covering during Hamotsi is not mentioned in the texts cited above (following the second explanation it is obvious, second the first it is obvious for Shabbat and Hollidays only but anyway nobody of the above cited poskim wrote about Hamotsi)</p>\n<p><em>I just saw that @user6591 also believes that this minhag is the source of the question.</em></p>\n\n\n",

So, she is \"Poletet Shichvat Zera\", leaking male semen (this semen is still not putrefied, so theoretically able to fecund). The time needed to evacuate this semen do not exceed 72h, but the Minhag in many communities (as the OP mentionned) is to wait 5 days. After this time, the woman is allowed to count 7 days. _The explanation is that a semen leakage broke the count of 7 days and the woman need to count again from 1. The source of this Halacha is in Gemara, see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5384\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> the Bet Yosef 196 paragraph 11 (יא) for a summary of Gemara.</li>\n<li><h3>How to skip the \"five days\"</h3>\n\nIf a woman was already unclean (and so prohibited for marital relationship), e.g. if she do not go to Mikve after her precious menses. Now occurred a short menstruation of one day, It seems clear from poskim that, directly after the end of the bleeding, she is allowed to make hefsek Tahara and initiate the count. So the \"five days\" are skipped.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Sources in Halacha books.</h2>\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5542\" rel=\"nofollow\">196, 11</a>, and see in the next page the Pitche Teshuva <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5543\" rel=\"nofollow\">sk 16</a>. Some Poskim allow even she was clean before the bleeding, when her husband is not in the town (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5384\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bach</a>, reported in Shach sk 20), but the Shach (op.cit.) rejected this opinion.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>If the woman was not clean (allowed for marital relationship) before the occurrence of menses, and the menstruation was shorter than 5 days, when the bleeding stopped, she is immediately allowed to start to count the 7 days </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why wasn't there a Levite among the 12 meraglim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There was a representative, a leader, from each tribe. Why wasn't there a Levite presence among the 12 meraglim? Does it have something to do with the fact that the Levites have no dedicated territories? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I heard a position before that since the people wanted the land to be explored, and Levites had no inheritance in the land, the representatives from Menashe and Efraim were chosen separately, without the representative from Levi, as is commonly done when dealing with questions involving land. For example, when the land was divided by Yehoshua, this was the representation of the tribes as well, and so too in the census in <em>Bamidbar</em> - since it counted people participating in the army to conquer the land.</p>\n\n<p>This position fits well for the opinions that hold that <em>parsha</em> of <em>Korach</em> came before the spies (Ibn Ezra I think), since the explicit wording that <em>kohanim</em> have no share in the land is mentioned there (perhaps there is an earlier mention somewhere in <em>Vayikra</em>, but I don't recall it). For others, one would have to assume that it was known that Levi would not get the land for this answer to work.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Mystically, the Alshich alludes to (and the Arizal writes it more openly) that the 12 spies were incarnations of the 12 brothers. Rav Moshe Wolfson writes in his talks (see the English one on <em>seudah shlishis</em> for <em>parshas Shlach</em>) that since Moshe prayed for Yehoshua and changed his name, he made Yehoshua his personal representative, and the soul of Levi was connected to Yehoshua (who was originally from Efraim). On the other hand, when listing the spies, the prefix \"for tribe of Yosef, for tribe of Menashe\" is used for Menashe, but \"for tribe of Efraim\" only is used for Efraim (no mention of Yosef), to hint that Yosef's representative was from Menashe, not from Efraim. So in a mystical sense, there was a representative from Levi, - Yehoshua.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does teshuva remove punishment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9943#v=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar 15</a>, the text speaks of someone who commits an intentional sin (mentioning idolatry and blasphemy) and says that kareit is the punishment (if there was no warning) etc. Then the story of the man who was found gathering stick on Shabbat is related and his punishment is a death penalty.</p>\n\n<p>The Stone chumash notes that in the first cases, one cannot atone through an offering (and no other method of atonement is discussed) but in pasuk 31, the phrase \"עֲו‍ֹנָה בָהּ\" is understood by Rashi to mean that excision from the community lasts until the person does teshuva - so there must be an atonement process (also cited in <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/sanhedrin/points/sn-ps-090.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sanhedrin 90b</a>). So it seems that doing teshuva can stop kareit which has already started.</p>\n\n<p>But <strong><em>is repentance an effect of having received a punishment or is it separate from that?</em></strong> Can I repent sincerely and avoid punishment in the first place? If the man gathering wood on Shabbat, after having been warned and in the presence of witnesses, hears his death sentence and then truly repents (not out of fear but maybe out of a realization that he did wrong on a grand scale and a wish to be a better person), <strong><em>must the death penalty be carried out</em></strong> because it is a required consequence or is the penalty eliminated because of teshuva? Can the intentional idolater change the divine decree of kareit before it takes place (if, for example,one understands Kareit to be \"dying young\")?</p>\n\n<p>[One cannot repent after having been killed but if one does repent before his execution then he can still have his share in olam haba (as per the Sifre on pasuk 31, cited in the Stone).]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is a disagreement between the Rambam and the Raavad regarding the Ir Hanidachas - wayward city, whether it is possible to remove the punishment if the town did indeed repent.</p>\n<p>The Rambam (עבודת כוכבים פרק ד׳ - הלכה ו׳)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ו והיאך דין עיר הנדחת. בזמן שתהיה ראויה להעשות עיר הנדחת. בית דין\nהגדול שולחין ודורשין וחוקרין עד שידעו בראיה ברורה שהודחה כל העיר או\nרובה וחזרו לעבודת כוכבים <strong>אחר כך שולחים להם שני תלמידי חכמים להזהירם\nולהחזירם אם חזרו ועשו תשובה מוטב</strong></p>\n<p>We send two Torah scholars to chastise them and warn them, and if they\nreverse their wicked ways and repent it is fitting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Raavad in his gloss on the Rambam questions this seemingly strange halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טוב הדבר שתועיל להם התשובה אבל לא מצאתי תשובה מועלת אחר התראה ומעשה\nעכ\"ל</p>\n<p>It is fine that their repentance is effective, but where do we find\nthat repentance helps for a sin that was forewarned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ralbag explains the disagreement between the Rambam and Raavad revolves around the concept of repentance. The Ralbag explains that according to the Rambam repentance is an act that qualitatively changes the essence of the person. To the extent that one becomes a different person.</p>\n<p>According to this, the town which has fully repented undergoes a complete change, thus, the Gzar Din - decree of punishment that was issued was not said on this \"new town\" it is as if it decreed upon a different city altogether.</p>\n<p>According to this Ralbag (although it appears to be explicitly against the Gemara in Makkos 13b that states that repentance does not absolve sins that have decreed to death - דאין תשובה מועלת למיתת בי\"ד) it would appear to suggest that repentance does absolve punishment (at least regarding an Ir Hanidachas).</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe repeats this idea of the Ralbag mentioned above <a href=\"http://abc770.org/article/node/5447#_ftn20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפי כל האמור לעיל יובן פסקו של הרמב״ם ״אם חזרו ועשו תשובה, מוטב״,\nלמרות שתשובה אינה מועילה לביטול עונשי בית דין של מטה - כי כאשר חוזרים\nאנשי עיר הנדחת בתשובה הם הופכים להיות שוב ״יחידים״, ומתבטלת המציאות של\n״ציבור״ של ״יושבי העיר.   ולכן מובן, שההלכה ״אם חזרו ועשו תשובה, מוטב״\nאינה סותרת לכלל ״חייבי מיתות בית דין, אם עשו תשובה, אין בית דין של מטה\nמוחלין להן״ - <strong>כי תשובתם של אנשי עיר הנדחת אינה מבטלת את עונשם, אלא היא\nמבטלת את עצם מציאותם כ״ציבור יושבי העיר״, ואז מתבטל העונש מאליו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Futher, there is an interesting disagreement between the Noda B'Yehuda and the Chid'a regarding this very question.</p>\n<p>The Noda B'Yeduda (Shu't Kama Orach Chaim 35) asks why doesn't full Teshuva help to absolve one from their punishment? He answers that is a Gezeiras Hakasuv, a biblical decree, that repentance does not remove the punishment.</p>\n<p>However the Chida (in his Sefer Ein Zocher - Erech Malkus, Letter כ) disagrees, writing that in truth Teshuva can remove the punishment, but being that repentance is something that is \"masur Le'lev\" dependent and only visible with the hearts realm, the court cannot know if the person has undergone true Teshuva, only G-d can know, therefore Beis Din does not have the authority or ability to remove a punishment from the person.</p>\n<p>See also the Aruch Hashulchan Ha\"asid (Hilchos Sanhedrin 58:2)</p>\n<p>The Ralbag can be seen here:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WGFh8.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WGFh8.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>The function of warning</strong> is to verify that the man would continue despite a good knowledge, there is one opinion in Tanayim in masechet Macot (Rabbi Yosi) which said that Talmid Chacham doesn't need warning.</p>\n<p>But it seems that if the warned man will answer to the warners one \"OK, right I stop it.\" there is no punishment and Teshuva is good. We are talking about a case that there is <strong>no new sin activity after the warning.</strong></p>\n<p>Even after this step, after the irreversible decision to punish, Teshuva is valuable but Bet Din Shel Mata (\"earth\" tribunal) cannot keep in count the intra psychic condition of a man. The condemned will be eliminated. From Achan we learn Viduy the condemned need to say viduy. It is a part of Teshuva. <strong>Mishna (6, 2) in Sanhedrin</strong> explained that after the Viduy Achan was not cut off from Olam Haba :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָיָה רָחוֹק מִבֵּית הַסְּקִילָה כְּעֶשֶׂר אַמּוֹת, אוֹמְרִים לוֹ הִתְוַדֵּה, שֶׁכֵּן דֶּרֶךְ הַמּוּמָתִין מִתְוַדִּין, שֶׁכָּל הַמִּתְוַדֶּה יֶשׁ לוֹ חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. שֶׁכֵּן מָצִינוּ בְעָכָן שֶׁאָמַר לוֹ יְהוֹשֻׁעַ, בְּנִי שִׂים נָא כָבוֹד לַה' אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וְתֶן לוֹ תוֹדָה וְגוֹ' וַיַּעַן עָכָן אֶת יְהוֹשֻׁעַ וַיֹּאמַר אָמְנָה אָנֹכִי חָטָאתִי לַה' אֱלֹהֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וְכָזֹאת וְגוֹ' (יהושע ז). וּמִנַּיִן שֶׁכִּפֶּר לוֹ וִדּוּיוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שם) וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוֹשֻׁעַ מֶה עֲכַרְתָּנוּ יַעְכָּרְךָ ה' בַּיּוֹם הַזֶּה. הַיּוֹם הַזֶּה אַתָּה עָכוּר, וְאִי אַתָּה עָכוּר לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. ‏</p>\n<p>When he is about ten cubits away from the place of stoning, they say to him, \"confess!\", for such is the practice of all who are executed, that they [first] confess, for he who confesses has a portion in the world to come.  Even so we find in the case of Achan, that Joshua said unto him, my son, give, I pray thee, glory to the Lord, the god of Israel, and make confession unto him.  And Achan answered Joshua and said, of a truth, I have sinned against the Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done.  And whence do we know that <strong>his confessions made atonement for him</strong>? - From the words, and Joshua said: why hast thou troubled us?  The lord shall trouble thee this day, i.  e. , this day art thou to be troubled, but thou shalt not be troubled in the next world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, Teshuva cannot cancel a decided punishment of <strong>Rabbinic tribunal</strong> because it is a Ben Adam Lamakom issue, and\nTeshuva apparently does be sufficient without punishment.</p>\n<p>But there is a notion of \"Four subgroups of atonement\" (Gemara Yoma 86a), and for sin with Kareth, Teshuva does not be sufficient. <strong>He needs to endure suffering.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאל ר' מתיא בן חרש את ר' אלעזר בן עזריה ברומי שמעת ד' חלוקי כפרה שהיה רבי ישמעאל דורש אמר שלשה הן ותשובה עם כל אחד ואחד עבר על עשה ושב אינו זז משם עד שמוחלין לו שנאמר (ירמיהו ג) שובו בנים שובבים עבר על לא תעשה ועשה תשובה תשובה תולה ויוה\"כ מכפר שנאמר (ויקרא טז) כי ביום הזה יכפר עליכם מכל חטאתיכם <strong>עבר על כריתות ומיתות בית דין ועשה תשובה תשובה ויוה\"כ תולין ויסורין ממרקין שנאמר (תהילים פט) ופקדתי בשבט פשעם ובנגעים עונם</strong> אבל מי שיש חילול השם בידו אין לו כח בתשובה לתלות ולא ביוה\"כ לכפר ולא ביסורין למרק אלא כולן תולין ומיתה ממרקת שנאמר (ישעיהו כב) ונגלה באזני ה' צבאות אם יכופר העון הזה לכם עד תמותון ‏</p>\n<p>Rabbi Matthia Ben Heresh asked Rabbi Eleazar Ben Azariah in Rome: have you heard about the four kinds of sins, concerning which Rabbi Ishmael has lectured? He answered: They are three, and with each is repentance connected - If one transgressed a positive commandment , and repented , then he is forgiven, before he has moved from his place; as it is said: Return, O backsliding chiidren. If he has transgressed a prohibition and repented,then repentance suspends [the punishment] and the Day of Atonement procures atonement, as it is said : For on this day shall atonement be made for you.\nfrom all your sins. <strong>If he has committed [a sin to be punished with] extirpation or death through the Beth din, and repented, then repentance and the Day of Atonement suspend [the punishment thereon], and suffering finishes the atonement, as it is said: Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with strokes.</strong> But if he has been guilty of the profanation of the Name, then penitence has no power to suspend punishment, nor the Day of Atonement to procure atonement, nor suffering to finish it, but all of them together suspend the punishment and only death finishes it , as it is said : And the Lord of hosts revealed Himself in my ears; surely this iniquity shal not be expiated by you till ye die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After this review of two Chazal,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>is repentance an effect of having received a punishment or is it separate from that?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--> Separated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>hears his death sentence and then truly repents (not out of fear but maybe out of a realization that he did wrong on a grand scale and a wish to be a better person), must the death penalty be carried out because it is a required consequence or is the penalty eliminated because of teshuva?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--> You see in the paradigmatic case of Achan and Yehoshua, that teshuva and punishment are independent issues. It seems that Yehoshua \"objectivized\" teshuva of Achan, therefore the issue was not different.</p>\n<p>So, tribunal acts only following an objective world (does not use prophecy, Ruach hakodesh {Remember Tanuro shel Achan [not the same achan] in Baba Metsia}) and Teshuva is not counted as an objective event.</p>\n<p>I hope that through this, we can answer the Pshat of Gemara <em>Makot 13b</em> quoted by @Fred</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"חייבי מיתות ב\"ד אינו בכלל מלקות ארבעים שאם עשו תשובה אין ב\"ד של מטה מוחלין \"</p>\n<p>(\" whereas those who have become liable to death by sentence of the [human] Court are not subject to the punishment of 'forty lashes' because, [even] <em><strong>if they should do penance, the Earthly Tribunal would not grant them remission</strong></em>\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Earthly Tribunal has nothing to do with the world of Teshuva, so teshuva does not exist in its world, not that Teshuva is not valuable, it is indistinguible.</p>\n<p>But about Psuley Edut, if we know that someone stopped bad activities, he will being again a Kosher witness. Therefore Psule edut is not a condemnation.</p>\n\n\n",

The rabbi was expected to deliver eulogies for distinguished men and women, especially famous rabbis.</p>\n<p>Outside of these occasions the communal rabbi was not expected to deliver public addresses. However, the rabbi was not restricted to these occasions. He could speak whenever he deemed appropriate, especially on special calendar dates, such as the annual religious festivals, the special penitential periods of the months of Elul and Tishrei, and the anniversary of the death of Moses (the 7th of Adar). There were also inaugural sermons, farewell sermons, and celebrations of publication of a book, the concluding of the study of the Talmud or one of its tractates, or the founding of a school or a society.</p>\n<p>This preaching flexibility allowed those rabbis with an inclination and/or talent for preaching to exercise their abilities, while relieving those who were not so inclined.

If it's something you wear all the time for your own religious reasons, try to tuck it under your shirt or something.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, you probably want to avoid talking about Jesus, and if you do talk about him you shouldn't refer to him as a rabbi (let alone as divine).</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, saying that you're a student visiting from such-and-such church is fine.  I live in a city with several universities; we get visitors doing research for classes sometimes.  You don't have to hide your identity.  In some synagogues, introducing yourself that way will get you an offer of somebody to sit with you and help you navigate the prayer book.</p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/20281/472\">this general overview</a> of what happens at Jewish services and how to behave.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> One exception: on the high holy days (Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur), seating is often very limited and thus restricted to members of the synagogue.  Don't go then.  Besides, if you do you're signing up for a 4+-hour service, which probably isn't what you wanted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I have been frequently invited to Shabbat observance, synagogue by people I both know and don't. It's a matter of how you act and follow observed laws and customs. Ask ahead of time, and write it down. Make sure to dress conservatively if you are not told how- long dress/skirt, long sleeves. It is best if someone comes with you from a shul that you want to attend. Best ask before hand. If I have a question, I normally apologize for asking, say that I would like to ask something and, sorry, I may not know how to ask or act, so please clarify it for me. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ask the Rabbi beforehand please so he can advise you on ground rules so as not make anyone uncomfortable. Also, likely conform to dress code including wearing a Kippah and nice clothing, not jeans and sneakers. Again, rabbi will advise. Letting him know beforehand will also sensitize him not to refer to anything derogatory in his sermon about Xtians and/or their behavior such as pogroms in the name of the Church, auto de fes, and the like. He will want to be sensitive to your feelings.\nI would also guess that Chassidic shuls will NOT welcome you. Many of their congregants are the children/grand children of Holocaust survivors, they are  insular, (other than Chabad), and will not welcome you regardless of your intentions. May even be quite hostile and toss you if they discover you. Really. I grew up in those types of communities and cannot ever imagine a Chassidic Rabbi/Congregation knowingly welcoming you to a service. If you were Jewish and not religious, no problem. But not a practicing Christian. They fear and abhor missionaries even though you can protest you are not one. Historic memory runs deep and forever of the many times Jews suffered at the hands of otherwise supposedly loving Xtians. Read up on the prayer Unsana Tokef in the High Holy Day prayers. Says it all but 1000 times more in real life.</p>\n\n\n",

However, everywhere I've been, it is assumed that one needs to check (pre-washed, even triple-washed) bagged lettuce if it doesn't have a hechsher on the bag. I proceed on the assumption that it is the minhag, if not the halacha, to do so.</p>\n\n<p>My question is instead about pre-checked lettuce with a hechsher on the bag, which one can sometimes find, even from mainstream brands and in regular stores. Strictly speaking, does one need wash and/or check this before use? A few points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>My kosher grocery store carried a sign saying something like \"Bagged lettuce without a hechsher on the bag must be checked\" (perhaps implying, perhaps correctly that bagged lettuce <em>with</em> a hechsher doesn't need to be checked).</p></li>\n<li><p>However, a friend of mine who knows her way around a kosher kitchen suggested to me that even bagged lettuce with a hechsher should be checked (although she didn't seem particularly sure or emphatic about it).</p></li>\n<li><p>There is also the consideration of whether lettuce needs to be checked <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71646/1516\">in principle</a>, even if only by cursory inspection. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Can anyone bring sources to answer this question definitively? Does commercially available bagged lettuce with a reliable hechsher need to be personally checked before it can be used?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The OU and cRc have the policy that bagged, washed <strong>iceberg lettuce</strong> is almost never a bug issue. Therefore, a bagged <strong>iceberg</strong> (or iceberg/cabbage/carrot) mix with a hechsher needs no further checking.</p>\n\n<p>(Iceberg forms a very tight head, which is harder for bugs to penetrate. As the OU's Rabbi Genack said, \"why do people prefer romaine lettuce? Brighter color, more vitamins, stronger flavor -- well, the bugs like it more for the same reasons!\")</p>\n\n<p>For <strong>romaine</strong> ... it depends what degree of non-bug certainty you require, and whose hechsher it is. A Star-K or OU on the bag means that statistically, this washing process has been found to reduce the odds of a bug to under 10%, which most poskim consider good enough. (Now is that odds of one bug per serving or per bag ... depends who you ask once again!) In their opinion, a bag with such a hechsher is ready to eat. (Though if you happen to see a bug, don't eat it!)</p>\n\n<p>More right-wing hashgachos would want a probability far less than 9.9%, and assurances stronger than statistics on the process (e.g. human checkers).</p>\n\n<p>I contacted a different lettuce machshir that basically said \"it's triple washed so it should be fine\"; the Star-K or OU would probably want additional checking in that situation.  </p>\n\n\n",

I have long suspected this song was originally conceived as a pastiche of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echad_Mi_Yodea\" rel=\"nofollow\">Echad Mi Yodeya</a>--the thematic, musical, and phonetic similarities seem to me too many to overlook--with the Aramaic lyrics pieced together around a central theme over time and across Seder tables.

Are the phonetic similarities between \"Chad Gadya,\" \"Echad Mi Yodeya\" and \"Haggadah\" a matter of pure coincidence, or can anyone provide historical evidence of their intertextuality? Put another way, was the original refrain of \"Chad Gadya\" \"Haggadah\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0765760401\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Scholar's Haggadah</a> by R.

These songs first appear in the <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/PragueHaggadah1590\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prague Haggadah</a>, printed from woodcuts in 1526 and have been repeated in all Ashkenazi and most Italian haggados ever since. The links in the comments discuss a possible relation of these songs to German folk songs and a possible earlier existence of the songs. The old Ashkenazi haggados included Judeo-German (Western Yiddish) versions of the songs, which may still survive in some families.  It is possible that all 3 songs were originally written in Judeo-German and only later translated into Hebrew and Aramaic. It is quite likely the case with the Chad Gadya song, since it is written in non-standard Aramaic with the admixture of many Hebrew words. A \"corrected Aramaic version\" has been made available later, it can be found in the R.

Firstly, that (in the diaspora at least) a mother goes to Shul to hear her husband receive an Aliya, to discharge her duty to bench Gomel (as nowadays women do not bench Gomel in public). And secondly, that (per Gemora Berachos 54b) a Yoledes requires Shemira for the first few days after birth. I conjecture that these two points were combined to create an erroneous belief that one may not leave the house except to go to Shul. Has anyone heard anything about this?</p></li>\n<li><p>The Gemora I mentioned above regarding Shemira for a Yoledes does not appear to be codified by the mainstream Poskim.

Is it due to our weakness, and it is really allowed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Aside from all the other answers, it's worth mentioning that <em>no one</em> studies Greek philosophy today. The thinkers that were so respected by (some of) the Rishonim are mostly irrelevant even to secularists.<br>\nTheir views on science were, well, wrong. For instance, Aristotle seems to have believed that a heavy object falls faster under gravity than a lighter object (see <a href=\"https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/7664/how-did-people-believe-aristotles-law-of-gravity-for-so-long\">https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/7664/how-did-people-believe-aristotles-law-of-gravity-for-so-long</a>), it took Galileo to do careful experiments to begin getting the rules right. They struggled along with epicycles.<br>\n<em>Rejecting</em> many of the things the ancients believed about the infinite was the basis of Cantor's Set Theory. [See, for instance, <a href=\"https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NonstandardAnalysis.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mathworld.wolfram.com/NonstandardAnalysis.html</a> for how this has altered mathematics.]<br>\nComing to a better understanding of how axioms work allowed the development of non-Euclidean geometry, closing an issue (the \"Parallel Postulate\") that had been a problem since the time of Euclid.<br>\nIn short, those Rishonim who studied Greek philosophy did so because they wanted to be up-to-date on the science of the day. That isn't true in our time; if you want to be up-to-date there're a whole lot of other things that are more urgent. We are more likely to study it so that we can read the beginning of Chovos Halevovos.<br>\nPersonal note: Some of us once went to Rav Yaakov Weinberg z\"l, Rosh Yeshiva of Ner Yisroel, and asked if he would give a regular chaburah on Moreh Nevuchim. He answered that a lot of the sefer deals with issues (Aristotle's philosophy, the Kalam, ...) that were great concerns in the Rambam's time, but not today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This question asks about shifting attitudes over many centuries, and is somewhat open ended, so I will begin with general historical overview:</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of philosophy and non-Talmudic study was by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geonim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Geonim</a> and their intellectual successors, North African and Southern Spanish rishonim (such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chananel_ben_Chushiel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbenu Chanael b. Chushiel</a> of Tunisia, and Rambam of Cordoba.) Mention must also be made of the scholars of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provence\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Provence</a> in Southern France who absorbed this positive attitude towards philosophy. This breed of rishonim pretty much died out, after Babylonian academies diminished tremendously by the 12th century. That same century saw the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almohad_Caliphate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">al-Mohades</a> invade the South of Spain, effectively ending Jewish cultural life there.</p>\n\n<p>After that (13th-14th century) \"Sefardi\" Jews continued in Northern (Christian) Spain and were very different from the Sefardim of the past, and were very influenced by the Northern French Tosafists. The leaders of this period were Ramban and R. Yonah of Gerona. Their students; Ra'ah, Rashba, and Ritva were all heavily influenced by the French. The French, like Ashkenazim in general, were generally anti-intellectual and opposed to philosophy in particular, and anything non-Talmudic in general. A case in point is Rashba's (admittedly non-universal) ban on the study of philosophy. This attitude expressed itself not just in the absence of study of philosophy in the strict sense of the word, but also of the study of astronomy, mathematics, and other sciences. It even resulted in decreased study of Scripture among Ashkenzim!</p>\n\n<p>To quote Prof. A.S. Halkin:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The essentially negative attitude toward philosophy, characteristic\n  of the rabbis of the Franco-German tradition, penetrated\n  Provence and Spain during the thirteenth century, together with\n  their method of Talmudic study, which was being adopted, and\n  their views on that study. The role of Rabbi Asher ben Yehiel,\n  a German Tosaphist, who was making his way to Spain at this time\n  to become the Rabbi of Toledo, was significant in galvanizing the\n  energy of the leaders to act, as it was in creating an atmosphere of\n  piety in Spain. His feelings about philosophy were decidedly\n  hostile, and he disliked secular studies, of which he admitted he\n  knew nothing, as intensely as philosophy. (Yedaiah Bedershi's Apology p.183)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>At the same time Jewish mysticism developed into what became known as \"Kabbalah\". From its infancy in 12th century Provence it continued with the publication of the Zohar in Spain at the end of the 13th century. Kabbalah became increasingly popular in the ensuing centuries, especially Lurianic Kabbalah which continued to increase in popularity, peaking in 17th century Poland. (Whereupon interest waned somewhat following the tragedy of Shabbettai Tsevi, a kabbalistic false Messiah, who sparked cults and movements devoted to him that were very influential throughout the 18th century).</p>\n\n<p>However, it would be a mistake to see Kabbalah as the cause for anti-rationalism. This fails to appreciate that the Ashkenazi culture was averse to all non-Talmudic study and was in general superstitious, even before the rise of Kabbalah. More accurately, the rise of Kabbalah was itself a reaction of these Ashkenazi tendencies, although the popularity of Kabbalah certainly succeeded in spreading Ashkenazi anti-rationalism.</p>\n\n<p>In the 14th and 15th centuries, the Arba'ah Turim written by an Ashkenazi immigrant gains great popularity in the increasingly Ashkenazi Spain, until the Spanish expulsion of 1492. In the next couple of centuries Ashkenazi culture continues to dominate, while its population grows. Eventually more than 90% of world Jewry lives in Poland. That culture originally in Babylonia, then in N. Africa, and S. Spain, then watered down in N. Spain, was largely eradicated and replaced with a culture hostile  to it.</p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, from the 16th-19th century, (following the Renaissance), Italy maintained a positive attitude to philosophy and the like, while late 18th century Germany saw a similar shift in attitude. 19th century Italians include Shemuel David Luzzatto, 19th century Germans included R. S. R. Hirsch, R. E. Hildesheimer, and at the end of the century R. D. Z. Hoffman. These trends continued in the 20th century with what became Modern Orthodoxy in America, and are present to a much higher degree in the Religious Zionist world in Israel.</p>\n\n<p>Rather than being based on a chance halakhic dispute over the legitimacy of studying philosophy, as outlined these differing views were the product of radically different worldviews. It seems safe to note that the Ashkenazi anti-intellectualism was more similar to that of their Catholic neighbors, while the Babylonian, North African, Spanish attitude was more similar to that of their neighbors; the Muslim Caliphate, which was for several centuries the world leader of culture and intellectual development.</p>\n\n<p>However, it certainly affected their interpretation of various relevant Talmudic passages. Ashkenazim tended to read them broadly (overly so, as demonstrated by R. Shaul Lieberman z\"l in <em>Hellenism in Jewish Palestine</em>). Sephardim, on the other hand emphasized that these statements generally focus on the limiting the teaching of philosophy to children, rather than presenting a wholesale ban. See <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2011/12/how-much-greek-in-greek-wisdom-on.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> for a discussion of these respective views.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If it just knowledge it is permitted to be learned (to add to your Torah learning and fear of heaven) even though most of your learning should be in Torah (if you are not learning Torah you should not learn it)</p>\n<p>But it is regarding G-d and his connection with the world then<br />\nIt is and was forbidden, but there are exceptions for example if the philosophy is being used against Jews/Judaism then it needs to be learnt to be able to save Jews/Judaism, but in our generation Jews/Judaism are left alone and respected, there is no need to learn it</p>\n<p>Source <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh5/6/3/7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan aruch harav hilchos Talmud Torah 3.7 (his sources you can see in the link)</a></p>\n<p>Partial translated</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mitzvah of learning Torah (day and night) means you should not be learning other things, but sometimes and a little bit it is permitted for a talmid chachom to learn other knowledge, since he can learn from them Torah and fear of G-d but not other people (only a talmid chochom)</p>\n<p>This is only if they are not books of minim which are books of philosophers of the nations of the world which were minim and kofrim of \"G-d's care of the world\" and of prophecy, since it is forbidden to read and (or) look in them always even to learn from them some musar and fear of G-D, so even when their words are brought in Jewish books, you need to be careful (to stay away) from them, and about them our sages said \"the one that reads outside books does not have a portion in the world to come, the only reason some sages delt with them was to answer them and to strengthen our religion, and in those times the time needed it, to answer the minim of the nations of the world, that where in those generations argument with the Jews, but not in out generations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PS it is possible that some Jewish sages know it but it does not mean it was permitted for them to learn, even if you ask them they might confess that it was wrong</p>\n\n\n",

Instinct and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27066510\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">research</a> tell me that these risks should be particularly concerning to a population--namely, Ashkenazi Jewish women--with a very high incidence of <a href=\"http://www.breastcancer.org/symptoms/testing/genetic/pos_results\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BRCA</a> gene mutations.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, as someone who is a woman and who talks to women (not all of whom are hysterical malingerers), I have heard a lot, a <em>lot</em> of reports from women who say the Pill wreaks havoc on their emotions, some of whom have suffered significant depressions as a result. There is of course a selection bias involved in what one hears. Still, when one hears enough, the idea that the Pill is a perfectly benign measure--practically a medical free lunch--becomes disrupted. </p>\n\n<p>My question has two parts: one philosophical and one halachic. They concern the potential legitimacy of cutting corners in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niddah#Rabbi_Zeira.27s_stringency.2C_counting_an_extra_five_days\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rabbinic elements</a> of taharas hamichpacha law in situations where the alternative would be to take a hormone-altering medication.</p>\n\n<p>Halachically, I would wonder if there are not issues of v'nishmartem me'od l'nafshoseichem, if not sakanas nefashos, in the readiness to use the Pill to circumvent problems created by the observance of taharas hamishpacha. I understand from the comments <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/57408/a-wife-wants-to-stop-going-to-the-mikva-what-does-that-mean-for-the-husband\">here</a> that sex with a niddah is either a death or karet-level offense; still, if it is \"only\" kareit, there may be a great deal of halachic leniency to prioritize health--especially when we are dealing with a drug that is only about fifty years old, and which is by definition disruptive to the female body's most basic engines. </p>\n\n<p>Philosophically, is it not insanity to alter the healthy workings of a body Hashem has made--moreover, at some non-negligible risk to that body and that life--in order to uphold laws--holy ones, to be sure, but also laws that have passed through centuries of human alteration and arguably random historical influence--we convince ourselves are valued by G-d? The Law, we think and hope, is G-d's--but isn't the body, and, indeed, life itself, even more undeniably so? If we return to first principles, which in theory we should never have absconded from, there seems to be something highly unnatural and essentially destructive about messing with G-d's priceless gifts in the name of received tradition. </p>\n\n<p>Our own mesorah and Law usually do a brave and brilliant job of acknowledging this truth, for example, through Halacha's religiously-unusual emphasis on pikuach nefesh. But I feel there is some lacuna here; something has been forgotten where it concerns this matter. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It cannot be and is not G-d's will that human intelligence do\n  violence to itself, that man slay this endowment and bring it as his\n  Isaac to G-d.

How did the Pharisees eventually win in this matter (by win I mean attain the strongest following and continue to live on as a Jewish sect) while the Sadducees died out?</p>\n<p>Also, how did the Halachot and discussions of Chazal in the Gemara become the governing laws of most Jews, whereas the Karaite traditions and interpretations of the Torah became almost extinct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Simply - this is the sign that the Pharisees were the ones with the correct tradition of the Torah. HaShem promised in our precious Torah that he would maintain the covenant he made with the forefathers with those that would listen to his laws, observing them and performing them. The Pharisees and their adherents did so, so they were preserved. The others deserted or abrogated the law of HaShem, so they no longer exist identifying themselves as Jews.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, that's the covenant - those that would devote themselves to HaShem's true teachings are guaranteed preservation by HaShem. The very act of adherence to the true message of HaShem is the effort of preservation. That is the system HaShem designed. We do ours, an He promises He will do His.</p>\n\n<p>Where does the Torah make this statement? For one, at the beginning of Parashas Eikev (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9971/jewish/Chapter-7.htm#v=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 7:12</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And it shall be, <em>on account</em> that you will listen to/accept these laws and you will observe them and perform them, HaShem your G-d will preserve for you the covenant and the kindliness which He swore to your forefathers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It's difficult to know, since there are few historical sources on the topic.

This would mean that after the Roman destruction of the temple, those involved with the temple as well as the formerly rich would lose much of their influence.</p>\n\n<p>Josephus writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While the Sadducees are  able to persuade none but the rich, and have\n  not the populace  obsequious to them, but the Pharisees have the\n  multitude on their  side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But this doctrine is received but by a few, yet by those still of the\n  greatest dignity.

However, I would think that their greatest argument would be to say that Moshe Rabbeinu went in himself and maybe he performed a trick and made the middle staff blossomed before he showed the nation of Israel. My question is why didn't Moshe preempt that suspicion and why didn't anyone who was looking for trouble make such a claim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I would challenge the premise of this question with two points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>we do not know that it was not challenged (other commenters)</li>\n<li>It is a possibility that Moshe was being watched the entire time</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we accept the premise of this question, I can provide 2 answers.</p>\n\n<p>Rashbam (<a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/17.23#e1n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 17:23</a>, he bases this claim off the wording of the Passuk) claims that when Moshe brought out the sticks, Aaron's had only just blossomed with flowers, and in front of the entire nation it grew the rest of the way, presumably by miracle.  According to this view, the main miracle would have taken place in front of the nation, and left no room for skepticism.</p>\n\n<p>Personal answer: It seems that the Benei Yisrael believed that this was to be the test as to who Hashem chose to lead them.  As a result, they were concerned maybe the stick closest to the Shechina would be chosen to blossom (as per Rashi).  However, they were each given back their own sticks to check after the fact, which confirmed that no one else's stick had blossomed, and thus, it must have been Aharon's stick that blossomed without trickery.  This will be true according to the other Mefarshim who say that Moshe found the stick fully blossomed/grown.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I finally found someone who addresses this exact question.

Now the Temple was desecrated on 15 Chislev in the year 145 of the Seleucid Era (1 Maccabees 1:54), or 6 December 167 BC, and the Jewish rebels rededicated it to Jewish worship on 25 Chislev in the year 148 of the Seleucid Era (1 Maccabees 4:52), or 14 December 164 BC [or 1087 days later]. In chapter 8, our author predicted that the Temple would miss 2,300 evening and morning continual burnt offerings between its desecration and its rededication (Daniel 8:11-14). This amounts to 1,150 days, or three years plus 55 days. In the Julian calendar, the rededication should have taken place on 30 January 163 BC, almost two months too late to fit actual history.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>(1) <em>Daniel</em> 8:14 was not written by Micah.</p>\n\n<p>(2) The writer of the question highlights a great problem, the computation of the time mentioned in this verse. Jewish commentators offer varying dates.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yaaqov Medan recently in 'Daniel and the Greek Kingdom' (<a href=\"http://etzion.org.il/en/daniel-and-greek-kingdom\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">etzion.org.il/en/daniel-and-greek-kingdom</a>) offers the following solution: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Most commentators understand that the number of 2,300 relates to the arrival of the future redemption. R. Sa'adya Gaon explains that this refers to 788 CE, 2,300 years after the Exodus from Egypt. Rashi suggests that this is the year 1397 CE, and R. Yitzchak Abravanel proposes a calculation that brings it to 1504 CE. All of these dates, as well as others suggested by other calculators of the ultimate redemption, have passed – yet the redemption has not arrived.</p>\n  \n  <p>I wish to propose once again that Daniel did not look far off thousands of years into the future, but only as far as the days of the Hasmoneans. Perhaps the number of 2,300 is not the number of years, nor even the number of days, but rather the number of daily offerings that were not brought. The book of Maccabees teaches us that the Greeks controlled the Temple and shut down the sacrificial service for slightly more than three years – in other words, for at most 1,140 days (if two of the three years were intercalated). On each of these days, one daily offering should have been brought in the morning and another in the afternoon – altogether 2,280 daily offerings. Scripture often rounds up to the next hundred or thousand, and so we reach the number mentioned in Daniel's vision – 2,300. The sacrifice of these daily offerings had been stopped, and they resumed with the redemption and the renewal of the independent kingdom of Israel in the days of the Hasmoneans.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(3) If one takes the view that the time expressed refers to 1150 days, then, taking the lunar year of approximately 354 days into account, the time equals three years and nearly three months, not three years and fifty-five days.</p>\n\n\n",

He said it is allowed mi'ikkar hadin (by the strict letter of the law), but I should treat it as a davar meguneh (something very distasteful). </p>\n\n<p>Edit: clarification about the clock question: He said that using sound this way isn't really hana'ah. I would think this is similar, that it's not really hana'ah, so I doubt it's assur.

Yes and no!\nSee Gemara Brachot 25a: \n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא יקרא אדם ק''ש לא כנגד צואת אדם ולא כנגד צואת כלבים ולא כנגד צואת חזירים ולא כנגד צואת תרנגולים. ‏</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A man should not recite the Shema' either in front of human excrement or of the excrement of dogs or the excrement of pigs or the <strong>excrement of fowls</strong> or the filth of a dungheap which is giving off an evil smell.</p>\n  \n  <p>אמר רבא לית הלכתא כי הא מתניתא (בכל הני שמעתתא) אלא כי הא דתניא לא יקרא אדם ק''ש לא כנגד צואת אדם ולא כנגד צואת חזירים ולא כנגד צואת כלבים בזמן שנתן עורות לתוכן. ‏{‏  רש\"י:  אצואת כלבים וחזירים קאי שדרכן לתתן. בעבוד העורות אבל צואת אדם אפי' בלא עורות שהרי אין דרכן לתתן שם הלכך ע''כ בלא עורות קאמר ‏} ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Raba said: The law is not as stated in this Baraitha, but it has been taught in the following: <strong>A man should not recite the Shema' in front either of human excrement or excrement of pigs or excrement of dogs when he puts skins in them</strong>. {Rashi explained that this condition is said for dog and swine, but for man's feces it is prohibited without conditions}</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that Rashi does not explain the status of chicken's feces. Tosfot discusses this and one of the opinions in Tosfot is that the feces of chicken are considered as feces only when they are in the hen house. See bellow the psak of Shulchan Aruch. Tosfote discussed also the different kinds of poultry.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Is it prohibited to say brachot when there is a bad smell coming directly from feces? Yes, see bellow the previous statement in the same Gemara:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אתמר ריח רע שיש לו עיקר ‏{‏ רש\"י: שהצואה מונחת שם ומסרחת   ‏}‏ רב הונא אמר מרחיק ד' אמות וקורא ק''ש ורב חסדא אמר מרחיק ד' אמות ממקום שפסק הריח וקורא ק''ש. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>It has been stated: [If there is] an evil <strong>smell [proceeding] from some tangible source</strong> {Rashi: The excreta alight there and smell bad}, R' Huna says that on removes [from the source of the smell] four cubits and recites the Shema'; R' Hisda says: He removes four cubits from the place where the smell ceases, and then recites the Shema'. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>If the shoes are washed, the excretas are removed, is the smell still considered as from tangible source? See Gemara 25b:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ת''ר גרף של רעי ועביט של מי רגלים אסור לקרות ק''ש כנגדן ואף ע''פ שאין בהן כלום ‏ { ‏  תוספות:  פי' רש''י של חרס בלוע משמע לפירושו אבל כלי דלא בלע כגון זכוכית אפשר דשרי ‏ }. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Our Rabbis taught: It is forbidden to recite the Shema' in face of a chamber pot for excrement or urine even if there is nothing in it {Tosfot: Rashi said in terra cotta, and is <strong>soaked</strong>, so, a chamber pot in glass which does not absorb may be permitted}.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We see that from Rashi's point of view, <em>one of the</em> problems of the chamber pot is absorbed feces. So may be that the fact that the shoes smell is a sign of absorbed feces.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Feces on the shoes without smell. See Gemara 25b:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעא מר בריה דרבינא צואה דבוקה בסנדלו מאי תיקו. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Mar the son of Rabina inquired: What is the rule if there is some dung sticking to his shoe (i.e. under the sole)? - This was left unanswered.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x449\" rel=\"nofollow\">79, 7</a></em>, <strong>Chicken's feces</strong>, as mentionned in Gemara (according to Tosfot) is not equivalent to human feces, i.e. the out of the hen house there is no prohibition to read Shema in front of them.</p>\n\n<p><em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x453\" rel=\"nofollow\">87, 1</a></em> : The halacha is ruled according to Rashi for <strong>absorbed excretas</strong>, but some Rishonim may allow for the case of hen house with chicken's feces, if it is washed. Additionally when the smell become clearly different from the smell of feces, there is a reason to allow, (see the second link bellow, regarding Kohanim and sweat).</p>\n\n<p><em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x446\" rel=\"nofollow\">76, 2</a></em> : When feces touch the sole of shoes, despite that we can not see the feces when the foot is on the ground and that they are not smelling, we cannot read Shema.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x448\" rel=\"nofollow\">79, 1</a></em> : For smelling feces we need to remove four cubits from the place where the smell ceases in way to read Shema.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I want to say you that I am not sure that it is prohibited but probably not prohibited. The fact that you are out of the hen house and that the shoes are washed makes a difference between shoes and hen house, the fact that chicken's feces are different from human's feces may make a big difference for \"absorbed feces\" in a chamber pot; the fact that shoes are not in terra cotta may make the washing more effective as with tissue clothes. The fact that some residual smell remains is perhaps a smaller problem, because there is no feces, no tangible source, and because that is not the same smell after whashing a Apparently no problem.\nSee here a <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%91%D7%9C_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%96_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">good link</a>, and <a href=\"http://halachayomit.co.il/he/ReadHalacha.aspx?HalachaID=1737\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

Assuming that's not an option...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Version One: The other minyan has a trend of having 9 men even after the rabbi makes a request. He would be the 9th man.</p>\n<p>Version Two: The rabbi says he most likely will get a 10th person, but is not completely certain.</p>\n<p>Version Three: Same as above, but the rabbi did not say anything either way. However, he states that after 15 minutes of waiting, at least 1 person who is present will leave. So, even if he and another person appears late, it won't matter, as there would be just 9, anyway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Version One:</strong> Since the other minyan most likely will not have 10 men even if he joins, what are they gaining by having him come? He might as well stay in his own minyan, where he's near assured of having 10, than to switch minyanim, where he's near assured of not having 10. We know how important a minyan is from sources such as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12319/importance-of-minyan?rq=1\">this question</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28935/must-one-pray-with-a-minyan?rq=1\">or this one</a> regarding how far out of your way must you go to attend a minyan.</p>\n<p><strong>Version Two:</strong> Even with the Rav's assurance that he most likely will get a 10th person, I still think it's better to stay put. After all, the rabbi is only <em>most likely</em> sure, but not completely certain. The current minyan still has a higher chance of attracting a minyan.</p>\n<p><strong>Version Three:</strong> First of all, there may very well be a lifnei iveir issue, as the rabbi is trying to get the guy to daven in a minyan that may or may not get a full 10, as opposed to his current minyan which <em>still</em> has a higher chance of getting 10.</p>\n<p>But we're here to focus on what the guy should do right, not what the rabbi did wrong. In this version, the guy has no idea whether the other minyan usually gets a full 10, though were he to go there for a few days he would quickly realize his current minyan gets more people. But even at this point in time, the rabbi's telling him something crucial: often enough to make it noteworthy, the minyan dissolves after 15 minutes of not having a minyan. The fact that the rabbi has to mention it should trigger warning bells in the guy's mind.</p>\n<p>If you want to ignore that fact, explaining it away by saying that the rabbi's just telling him that on the few occasions when there's no minyan for 15 minutes it dissolves, then he has no way of knowing which minyan is present more often without actually going to that minyan. Thus, that crosses this option off the list for being inapplicable.</p>\n<p>I don't think it matters if he was able to return to the first minyan after those 15 minutes. Assuming the minyan begins davening and just stops after 15 minutes, he very well might break his kavanah (see next section) due to traveling. He might as well stay in the now-empty room and daven b'yichidus with kavanah - or, better yet, stay and daven b'tzibbur in the old minyan. Of course, as before, he had no way of knowing this would happen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He finds the minyan he regularly attends more accommodating to his davening pace. The other minyan davens too fast for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In terms of answering to Kaddish and Kedushah, this doesn't make a difference. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13540/need-minyan-to-answer-kaddish?rq=1\">Not everyone has to answer.</a> In terms of Kavanah, though, it may well be worth it to stay in the minyan that fits his davening pace, since he'll be better able to focus when he's not saying one thing and the minyan's saying something else. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10442/9682\">(Source for importance of kavanah.)</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The minyan he regularly davens in is his Nusach (say Sefard); the other is not his Nusach. / The other minyan is a different \"version\" of his own Nusach. For example, he davens Persian Edot Hamizrach in his regular minyan, while the other minyan davens Morrocan Edot Hamizrach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, I don't think this makes a difference. As long as he's not Chazzan, he can daven whatever nusach he wants. (See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1755/nusach-for-silent-amida-when-chazzan-in-an-other-nusach-congregation\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33418/which-tachanun-should-i-say-when-davening-in-a-minyan-with-a-different-nusach\">here</a>.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is makom kavu'a (regular davening place) a factor in making any choice? If he attends the other minyan, he will not be davening in his makom kavu'a.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This one I can't pasken on. I know of the importance of makom kavu'a, but I don't know if it's absolutely critical to daven in your makom kavu'a, or if in a sha'as dechak you're allowed to daven somewhere else.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now, let's go through the points one by one and see if things would be different if any individual point were false.</p>\n<p>Let's say that the other minyan had the same rate of success as his own of getting a minyan, were he to switch. On that alone, I'm still not sure that he can switch. After all, although he's enabling the new minyan to daven b'tzibbur, he's also preventing his old minyan from davening b'tzibbur.</p>\n<p>Let's say that the other minyan fit his davening pace. (Note that my answer to this, even disregarding the various versions added in by the OP, is different than what I said before.) According to Versions One and Two, his old minyan still has a higher rate of davening with a minyan, and, as we mentioned above, he doesn't actually need to answer anything as long as someone else is. Thus, I think it would be better to daven in the back and allow for the Shechinah to rest on the minyan than it would be to daven alone and prevent both minyanim from davening with a minyan. I think it's worth it to lose his kavanah to enable nine others to daven.</p>\n<p>On the other hand (to quote <em>What If?</em>, \"however...\"), we also know (Gemara, Kiddushin 64b) that personal chiyuvim take precedence over chiyuvim of others that are fulfilled through you.

The way <em>Haamek Davar</em> explains it — if I understand <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.23.20\" rel=\"nofollow\">his commentary to verse 20</a> correctly — the transaction that was made (verses 17–18) did not include any mention of what the site would be used for. Yes, that use had been mentioned in the preliminary discussion (verses 4–15), but it was not a condition of the actual transfer of ownership. Only by burying <em>Sara</em> (verse 19) did the land become established as <em>Avraham</em>'s burial site (verse 20) and did the neighbors lose their right to protest such use of the land. (A burial site increases foot traffic. [Apparently, according to <em>Haamek Davar</em>, this was not known to be a burial site hitherto.])</p>\n\n<p>Why didn't <em>Avraham</em> make the land use a stipulation of the transaction itself? That would immediately prevent anyone from protesting such use! And it's not like it was a secret: the whole town knew he was out to buy a burial site.</p>\n\n\n",

There are many mitzvot (more than half) that are not directly applicable today e.g. laws pertaining to the temples. Despite there being some remnants of these mitzvot in Rabbinic law, why, if the Torah is timeless, is so much not applicable?</p>\n\n<p>Aside from learning about the non-applicable mitzvot or in order to be in preparation for their future application, why were these mitzvot included if they would not be used for thousands of years?</p>\n\n<p>I am assuming, of course, that the Torah was written with all generations in mind. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You could as easily ask why the torah has mitzvot that can be observed only in Israel, when God knew that we would be in exile for thousands of years.  But for God to <em>not</em> give us mitzvot specific to Israel, or the Temple, would \"normalize\" <em>galut</em> and the absence of the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>It <em>shouldn't</em> feel normal and routine that we are not in Israel, and it <em>shouldn't</em> feel normal and routine that we do not have the Temple today.  As Menachem wrote <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/26919/472\">in an answer about yearning for the moshiach</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The truth is that Exile is darkness, and the reason you're so comfortable in the darkness is that you've never seen the light (don't worry, none of us have). The seventh Lubavitcher Rebbe would call this \"a doubled and re-doubled darkness\", a darkness that is itself concealed, until you don't even realize it is dark. The more you learn about what the world should be, and how you can bring it to that state, the more you'll start feeling it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We should not get so comfortable that the Temple becomes irrelevant.

After the reading of Yalkut Shim'oni we can understand easily the Tanchuma.</p>\n\n<p>In Yalkut Shim'oni, <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?mefaresh=shimoni&book=4&perek=20\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 764</a> we found the same question followed by an answer (which is perhaps alluded in the Tanchuma)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>‏  יען לא האמנתם - ‏\n  היה לו לומר: ואמר: לא האמנתם בי, <strong>אהרן מה חטא</strong>? ‏\n  מכאן שהמטפל לעובר עבירה כעובר עבירה. ‏\n  והיה אהרן יכול לומר אני לא חטאתי, אלא שתק וכבש כחו ולא למד על עצמו סניגוריא.\n  ומשה מקלסו, שנאמר: האומר לאביו ולאמו לא ראיתיו - לא עמד לומר עשה בשביל אבא בשביל אמא שלא תכנס שכולה בג' בניה.  ‏   </p>\n  \n  <p>\"Because you don't trust in me...\": We learn here that the subordinate to (who follows) one who transgress would itself be viewed as transgressing. But despite that, Aharon could have told \"I did not transgress\" But he (Aharon) refrain itself and had not defend himself. And Moshe congratulates him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>After the reading of the Yalkut, we can understand the Tanchuma. The Midrash start wih an allegory, Aharon is the neighbor of the indebted (Moshe) and sustained damage because because of its proximity . And Moshe is the one who protested against the punishment of Aharon (the same protestation described in Yalkut as a possibly answer for Aharon) and Moshe is complimented because He stood and fought for his brother. </p>\n\n<p>The combination of both is marvelous. Aharon was not defending himself, but Moshe was defending Aharon. Both are commended for their conduct. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the punishment is for its association in this situation.

According to the peshat, as recognized by the Rashbam, Chizkuni and Kli Yakar, the Mateh at Kadesh was the Mateh Aharon discussed in Parashas Korach, not the Mateh Elokim with which Moshe brought forth water by hitting the Tzur at Maseh U'Merivah in Parashas Beshalach. (The presence of the Mateh Aharon here explains why Hashem commanded that Aharon be present at Kadesh, but did not issue a similar command at Masah.)  As set forth in Parashas Korach, the purpose of the Mateh Aharon was to tamp down disputes between people before they became complaints against Hashem, resulting in the deaths of the complainers.  Had Moshe followed Hashem's instructions at Kadesh, including speaking to the sela and personally providing water to the Edah and their animals (\"V'Hishkisa Es HaEdah V'Es Bieeram\"), the dispute (which did not involve Hashem at all) would have ended happily.  By hitting the sela, he brought forth a flood in which people and animals took for themselves (\"VaTeisht HaEdah U'Vieeram\").  The result was lingering hard feelings that burgeoned into a much serious dispute a few months later (the dispute with the Nechash Nechoshes) in which the nation complained against Elokim and slandered the Mahn.  That dispute resulted in the deaths of \"Am Rav MiYisrael\" who should have entered Eretz Yisrael.

In\n  another passage, commenting on Lev. xxiv. 15 seq.: \"If any one, I do\n  not say should blaspheme against the Lord of men and gods, but should\n  even dare to utter his name unseasonably, let him expect the penalty\n  of death.\"[36]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In which historical periods was it allowed to pronounce the tetragrammaton? From the sources above it seems that there was a time when it was permitted to be spoken and later even to be used in a greeting. Later still it was forbidden. </p>\n\n<p>(Was Abba Shaul the one who forbade it? For as we know, the Mishnah in Sanhedrin 10 (1) lists those who have no share in the World to Come.

    "content": "# Unconsciousness in Jewish Thought\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Yes, that pun was intended. </p>\n\n<p>We know that sleep is 1/60 of death, and dreaming is 1/60 of prophecy (Brachos 57b). This is because it's a partial death, in which a piece of the Neshamah leaves the body - just enough to be noticeable, but not too much. Likewise, the Neshamah gets a glimpse of the future during its out of body experience, which we see as dreams (Maharsha).</p>\n\n<p>What happens when one goes into a coma? The mind is totally unconscious; there are no dreams in a coma. Furthermore, it's not at all what Hollywood would have you believe: one does not wake up from a coma feeling refreshed. Does this mean that the Neshamah is trapped inside the body like it is when a person is awake? Does a larger portion, or all of, the Neshamah leave the body, and it's too much to be refreshed or dream? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>After doing a bit of looking into the topic, I think I may have found some sources to answer this question. I'll wait until others comment, to hear what they think, before I select this as the correct answer.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As discussed in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380651/jewish/Levels-of-Soul-Consciousness.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Chabad article</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8921\">this question</a>, there are five levels of the soul: nefesh, ruach, neshamah, chaya, and yechidah. As mentioned in both of those sources, the neshamah refers to the thinking part of a person, the ruach is the emotional part of a person, and the nefesh is the life force and desires of a person.</p>\n\n<p>When we drift off into the subconscious, we still are able to think on some level. It's for this reason that we're able to interpret the 1/60 of prophecy contained in dreams. This is because not all of the neshamah has left the body - 59/60 of it remains. But in the unconscious state, the brain focuses its energies on the basic needs in order to keep the body alive. There is no thinking done whatsoever. It's like the entire neshamah has left and no thinking is occurring, in order to leave the nefesh to keep the body alive.</p>\n\n<p>Another proof can be brought from Bava Basra 10a:</p>\n\n<p>Yosef the son of R' Yehoshua had been ill and fell into a trance. His father asked him: \"What did you see?\" He replied, \"I saw a world upside down, the upper below and the lower above.\" He said to him, \"You saw a well regulated world.\"</p>\n\n<p>From the fact that he saw a higher level of Olam HaEmes than one sees in dreams, which reflect but 1/60 of what the neshamah normally sees, it's quite possible that more of his neshamah went up to Shamayim, and thus he was able to bring back a clearer picture.</p>\n\n<p>TL;DR: If I am correct, the entire neshamah leaves the body, and one is all but dead in the unconscious state.</p>\n\n\n",

Obviously the names reflect the \"true nature\" of the animal, so it must be a special language, probably the same one which Hashem uses to name the light \"day\" and the darkness \"night\".</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Biblical Hebrew. The verse says that Adam named Eve a \"woman\" (ishah) because she was created from man (ish). Noting the fact that the two words, in Hebrew, actually are related, Rashi (to that verse) comes to the conclusion that the world must have been created using Hebrew. He's actually quoting the Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 18:4), which continues with the fact that in no other ancient language are the words for man and woman linguistically related. </p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the Midrash records (Ibid. 17:4) that man was tasked with giving a name to the animals that truly described their essence. In that Midrash, also, it's recorded that the names related to other Hebrew words, such as man's name (Adam) being appropriate since he was created from the ground (adama), or Hashem's name (pronounced Ado-nai), reflective of His being Master (adon) over all. This discernment, says the Midrash, of a being's essence, is something only Man has; even the angels were unable to pick a name that related to the creature's true essence.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal (Sotah 34b) adds that this is true of anyone's name - it particularly relates to his or her task in life, and his or her strengths and weaknesses. Although parents name their child(ren), the choice is Divinely influenced. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Midrash Rabba (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bamidbar_Rabbah.19.3?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 19:3</a>) tells us the story of Adam naming the animals:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויחכם מכל האדם, מאדם הראשון, מה היתה חכמתו את מוצא כשבקש הקב\"ה לבראות את האדם נמלך במלאכי השרת, אמר להם נעשה אדם בצלמנו, אמרו לפניו (תהלים ח') מה אנוש כי תזכרנו, אמר להם, אדם שאני רוצה לבראות חכמתו מרובה משלכם, מה עשה כינס כל בהמה חיה ועוף והעבירן לפניהן, אמר להם מה שמותן של אלו, לא ידעו, כיון שברא אדם העבירן לפניו, אמר לו מה שמותן של אלו, אמר לו לזה נאה לקראות שור, ולזה ארי, ולזה סוס, ולזה חמור, ולזה גמל, ולזה נשר, שנאמר (בראשית ב') ויקרא שמות, אמר לו ואתה מה שמך, אמר לו אדם, למה שנבראתי מן האדמה. אמר לו הקב\"ה אני מה שמי, אמר לו ה', למה שאתה אדון על כל הבריות, היינו דכתיב (ישעיה מ\"ב) אני ה' הוא שמי, הוא שמי שקרא לי אדם הראשון... (במדבר טז ג)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Roughly translated:\nWhat was Adam's wisdom? ... God brought all the animals to the angels and asked them \"what are the names of these creatures?\" And they did not know. Once he created Adam he asked him too, and Adam said \"This one is fitting to be called a Shor (Ox), this one an Aryeh (Lion), this one a Sus (horse), this one a Chamor (Donkey)...</p>\n\n<p>The Rabbeinu Bachya, one of the early commentators on the Chumash, explains in his comments to Bamidbar 19:2, that these were intelligent names based on the wisdom of the Hebrew Alphabet, and that Adam identified each animal's natural qualities and essence:</p>\n\n<p>והנה הם שמות מושכלות שהשכיל בחכמת האותיות לקרוא השמות כפי טבעי הבריות בגבורה וקלות ואכזריות ותמות...</p>\n\n<p>Likewise in his commentary to Bereishit 2:19, he writes that this ability is an expression of Adam's God-like wisdom, utilizing the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet to bring out the essence of the animal:</p>\n\n<p>והנה בזה נתפרסמה חכמתו הגדולה כמו שהיה בצלם אלקים ומעשה ידי הש\"י... כי האדם הבין בחכמתו ושכלו טבע כל בהמה וחיה וקרא לכל אחת ואחת שם מעין הטבע ומדה שהכיר בה, והאותיות שצרף בשמותיהן הכל לפי טבעיהן ומדותיהן...</p>\n\n<p>He then goes on to explain in detail a few names of animals and their construct within the Hebrew Language. </p>\n\n\n",

But all this is for minhagim of a whole community, or region, and switching from one to another, or for family minhagim.\nBut the OP asks also for <strong>personal Chumrot</strong>, i.e. things which are known as allowed, and someone wants to be stringent, in way to protect itself from prohibited similar things.

So in your case if he weared RTT not by mistake but as a personal duty, even one time, he need to continue; by mistake, even 20 years, he can stop it.</p>\n\n\n",

But does this apply to all cases of forbidden relationships, or just some? (If some, to which doesn't it apply, and why not?)

This is always allowed, irrespective of anything else (married or single, nidda or not). (And the same for a woman touching her (grand)son, (grand)father, and brother).</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise a man is not allowed to touch anyone forbidden to him. That means any married woman (aside from his wife) and any unmarried woman who is nidda (and that is presumed about any single woman from age 11 today), since they are forbidden to him. He is also not allowed to touch his wife when she is nidda, since she is currently forbidden to him. (And the same applies to a woman touching a man she is forbidden to, such as any man if she is a nidda and any man but her husband if she is married.)</p>\n\n\n",

What does Bilam mean by \"watching to speak?\" Why not just phrase it similarly to the 1st phrasing? Once G-d has placed words in his mouth, doesn't that imply that he is already speaking and under G-d's control and no longer under his own control, anyway? How can he \"watch\" what he says at that point?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>אשמור means to save or keep, not to watch.</p>\n\n<p>I think the idea is as so:</p>\n\n<p>The first Pasuk is when Balak & Bilam first meet, and Balak complains to Bilam why he didn't come sooner, and Bilam's answer is: So here I am, is that going to help? Whatever G-d puts in my mouth I will say.</p>\n\n<p>The second Pasuk is after Bilam blesses Bney Israel instead of cursing, now Balak's complaint is, that he is paying for one thing, but getting the opposite.

Balak asks him why he didn't come earlier; \"do you think I can't honor you enough?\" To this Bil'am responds \"even now that I came, how can I speak anything? That which God puts in my mouth, that I speak!\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, Bil'am is justifying his past and potential future silence in light of Balak's demand that he come and say something.</p>\n\n<p>The second complaint comes when Bil'am not only fails to curse the people of Israel, but actually blesses them. Says Balak, \"to curse my enemies I took you, and behold you blessed them!\"</p>\n\n<p>Here Bil'am needs to justify not silence, but speech. He has to explain the blessing.</p>\n\n<p>Thus he responds \"that which Hashem places in my mouth, that I watch to speak.\" In other words, not only does he not say anything not from Hashem, he is very careful not to suppress anything Hashem puts in his mouth.</p>\n\n<p>This additional point he needs to make here, which he did not need to make earlier when simply asked about his silence.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, then reciting another <em>ha'eitz</em> on some other type of fruit (such as the kiwi) would involve an unnecessary, forbidden blessing (see <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%95#.D7.9B.D7.91_.D7.9E.D7.91\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Mishna B'rura</em> 206:22</a>, <em>Sha'ar HaTziyun</em> ad loc. 23-25).

This is true only if the other drinks were either on the table at which you recited havdalah or if you had intended to drink them, even if you didn't intend consciously to include them in the blessing of borei peri hagafen. In either case, you can then drink them without reciting a prior or subsequent blessing. However, if the drinks were not present on the table or in your mind, they require their own prior blessing (shehakol), but they do not require a subsequent blessing (borei nefashos), because they will be included in the subsequent blessing of al hagefen.\"</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Hagafen's covering other drinks is arguably a special case, so I'm not sure if these rules (i.e., in view OR intention is enough -- at least b'dieved) apply only in this case or to other foods too.</p>\n\n\n",

Isaiah uses the singular for the Jews as a whole many times: see 43:10, 52:1-2 (Christian bibles tampered with these verses and switched it to plural! See also 53:8 \"to them\" mistranslated \"to him\"), 54:1-8. See also Hoshea 11:1, Exodus 4:22.</p>\n<p>E.g.

    "content": "# How do we explain genaelogy differences between Genesis 4 and 5?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read in <em>The Collegeville Bible Commentary: Old Testament \"Genesis\"</em> by Diane Bergant that the similar names in both Cainite and Sethite genealogies found in Genesis 4 and 5 such as <strong>Lamech, Enoch, Methushael/Methuselah, and Mehuyael/Mahalael</strong> are a result of a single account being edited by both \"Yahwist\" and \"Priestly\" sources of the Documentary Hypothesis.  (The DH postulates multiple editors of the text that became the torah.)  The names Irad and Jared are also very similar.</p>\n\n<p>Bergant writes (page 46):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are points of conflict between this genealogy (Genesis 4) and the Priestly genealogy in Genesis 5. Some of the Names are repeated (Enoch,Lamech), and some the names are simply variations of names  in the Yahwist genealogy (Mehujael/Mahalalel) and (Methusael/Methuselah). It appears that both genealogies come from a common source that has undergone a long period of transmission.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>How does the Jewish tradition understand the strong parallels between these genealogies?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch goes over the names and discusses the meaning of the names and the significance for the basic traits of the generation that name is used for. He points out (4:18-22 and 5:11-27). For example, Lemech ends the progress of the generations with a statement that sums up the state of the descent, though from different sides. The Cainite line is constant downward \"progress\" ending in the children of Lemech whose grandfather <em>מחוי אל - in which G0dliness was extinguished</em> while <em>מחי אל - who extinguished G0dliness</em>. Lemech summarizes the descent by his statement that his children end with the invention of warfare and killing. (<em>ends in utter despair</em>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the generation that freed itself from culture was young, it was\n  מחויאל passive, g0dliness was extinguished in it, but when it was\n  older it was מחייאל active, tried to do away with g0dliness in\n  general. It was followed by a generation of מתושאל seeking masses of\n  people from the root of םתים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch does a similar analysis of the line of Seth and ends with Lemech summarizing the meaning of the line ending with Noach who leads to hope and the possible redemption of makind. The names show both upward and downward trends.</p>\n\n<p>The father of Lemech in the Seth line is מתושלח which means <em>give up the masses</em> whose father is חנך</p>\n\n<p>חנך to educate itself to nurturing and cultivating the seeds of something nobler. But in times of general debasement such efforts remain the work of only individual nobler natures and these feel themselves in such contrast to the masses that they</p>\n\n<p>מתושלח give up the masses.

It was surely no accident that, beginning with him, the names of the Cainites were used among the descendants of Seth. By this time, the former had fought their way into Babylonia and with the help of their metal weapons brought it under their control. We thus find then on the names: Chanokh, Methuselah, and Lemech, corresponding to the names of the Cainites: Chanokh, Methusael, and Lemech The name Methuselah means 'hero' or 'man of the weapon' and is especially characteristic of the whole trend.

It is actually קריבה לעריות. I think that would eliminate your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The sources of the following are Bet Yosef YD 195, Shach (YD 195 sk 20, 157 sk 10) and Minchat Yaakov, Sidre Tahara at the same siman,  Rambam,  Ramban,  Megilat Esther Lavim 353. Chinuch 188,  Bet Smuel EH 20 sk 1,</p>\n\n<p>The laws of  harchakot from the wife nidda presents similarities with arayot and differences.  In some point of view those differences can lead to leniency but from an other point of view they may lead to stringency.  To know very good his wife can facilitate the the process leading to a intimate relationship and also can diminish the drive.  The fact that this woman is his wife or the fact that the Isur nidda is not a \"marriage prohibition\" may make it lighter than other isure bia. </p>\n\n<p>My plan is:<br>\n1. How the Bet Yosef explained the Machloket between Rishonim regarding the permission to allow a husband who is  physician to examine and treat his nidda wife the Rishonim who allows is Ramban in Shut 127.  Bet Yosef identified the stringent opinion to Rambam in a known Machloket Rambam -  Ramban about Arayot. He interpreted the leniency of the lenient opinion as a permission when there is no other physicians and the matsav is pikuach nefesh. \n2. The RMA ruled as the lenient opinion.<br>\n3. The Shach opposed to Bet Yosef an other understanding of the Machloket Rishonim regarding the nidda's  husband physician. He said that both opinions can be congruent to Rambam or Ramban indifferently concerning their argument about Arayot.<br>\n4. He proved his opinion by the fact than RMA stated as Rambam in Arayot (YD 157, 1) and as the lenient opinion regarding nidda medical care.  Medical care has no link with arayot. The question of Arayot for Rambam itself begins only when  touching act born of sexual drive. The harchakot of nidda concerning non  sexually characterized contact are derabanan. \n5. The Minchat Yaakov explained that Bet Yosef see the care of the wife by her husband as a problem of sexual character because of the great proximity between the both. Even if a physical examination of an other woman has no sexual features. The  Bet Shmuel EH 20 sk 1 k (which is indicated by the Dagul Merevava on the Shach YD 195, sk 20,  the  BS is very explicit in his language and seems to read as th BetYosef assumption in the Shut  Haramban.) also rejected the argument of the Shach against Bet Yosef. Sidre Tahara also sustained the Bet Yosef 's opinion. </p>\n\n<p>The answer of @Moshe that hugging is kreva learayot follows the Rambam.  Therefore the Shach stated that taking pulse to his wife is no more than  harchakot,  he probably agrees about hugging.  Additionally, to give hug his wife is not harmless as a physical  is also not not a case of sakana,  and RMA specified \"sakana becholiah\", Shach also fixed sakana as a necessary condition for allowing any \"medical touching\". </p>\n\n<h3>There is no opinion to allow this in Shulchan Aruch and Nos'e Kelav.</h3>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The text of Bet Yosef. </p>\n\n<p>Bet Yosef YD 195.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב עוד בתה\"ד בשם גדול אחד דאשה חולה ובעלה רופא אסור למשש לה הדפק </p>\n  \n  <p>ונראה מדבריו שאפי' בשאין רופא זולתו אסור </p>\n  \n  <p>וגם בתשובות דלהרמב\"ן סימן קכ\"ז אסור לבעל למשש דפק אשתו נדה ואע\"פ שלשון השאלה היה בשיש שם רופאים אחרים אלא דבעלה ניחא לה משום דמזומן תדיר נראה דלמאי דאסר ל\"ש לן בין יש שם רופאים אחרים לאינם </p>\n  \n  <p>ומיהו אם החולי מסוכן ואין שם רופאים משמע קצת מדבריו דשרי משום פיקוח נפש </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>. Machloket Rambam Ramban if touching a nidda is prohibited from Tora or from Rabanan. Bet Yosef identify negiat erva and negiat nidda. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלא דאיכא למימר דלטעמיה אזיל דסבר דנגיעת נדה אינה אסורה אלא מדרבנן </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>. Ramban followed his own opinion about kreva to Arayot which is</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל להרמב\"ם דנגיעת ערוה אסורה מן התורה הכא אע\"פ שיש בו פיקוח נפש איפשר דאסור משום דהוי אביזרא דג\"ע וצ\"ע :‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>. Bet Yosef said that possibly Rambam prohibited to take care of the wife even in Pikuach nefesh but leaves the question open. </p>\n\n\n",

Many disqualifications for Kohanim follow an aesthetic principle. People need to look at the Kohanim as only good. If a Kohen is known for past problems, its value diminished in front of people. Despite that this negative sentiment is not rational, it is important for Kohanim. As a physical defect, which is not a sign of a low value for a man, is problematic for a Kohen at Beit Hamikdash service.</p>\n<p>But in conclusion both can make Birkat Kohanim.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm curious -- would that prohibition still hold if the meat & milk mixture were inedible? I have no idea how one would derive financial benefit from, say, a rotting cheeseburger, but if one could figure out a way to do so, would it be permitted? Would it make a difference whether the meat and dairy being rendered inedible was intentional or not? (E.g., a cheeseburger that's gone rancid vs a cheeseburger that was made with soap mixed in.) Would it matter whether or not the meat & milk were inedible before being mixed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Firstly, mixture is not the criterion for the scriptural prohibition.

In this siman multiple cases are treated, for instance about allowed things, which someone considered by minhag as prohibited, or optional action which he considered as mandatory. The sources for Halacha are Mishnayot in the 4st chapter of Massechet Pessachim and a Brayta in the second chapter of Nedarim. But all this is for minhagim of a whole community, or region, and switching from one to another, or for family minhagim.\nBut for <strong>personal Chumrot</strong>, i.e. things which are known as allowed, and someone wants to be stringent, in way to protect itself from prohibited similar things. For this matter, Beit Yosef YD 214, at the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6074\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">end of the siman</a> report in name of the Rashba and Ran that it is more strong than minhag and a simple hatarat nedarim does not be sufficient to cancel the prohibition.\nWe have not yet found the notion of 3 times, one time seems sufficient if he take it as a duty. Poskim said to specify to himself if he make something stringent, <strong>to say that it is not a neder and that it is not for ever but for one time</strong>. Buy I have found a Mishna which said a similar rule for <strong>a positive mitsva</strong> that <code>he has to do it forever</code> after the first time.\nThe Mishna in Shekalim says (1, 3) See <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37941&st=&pgnum=504&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37941&st=&pgnum=505\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל קָטָן שֶׁהִתְחִיל אָבִיו לִשְׁקוֹל עַל יָדוֹ, שׁוּב אֵינוֹ פּוֹסֵק .‏</p>\n<p>That one who had paid \"the Half Shekel\" for his minor son, cannot stop {and need to pay every year until the son comes of age to pay for himself.}</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>For the tefilin of Rabenu Tam</strong>, if he hasn't the minhag from family or community, the SA OC <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x399\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34, 2</a> and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x400\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34, 3</a> said that it is a Hiddur, not a Mitsva, so if he was thinking that it is a mitsva by mistake, it is not a neder, if he was aware that it is a Hiddur and taked this as a duty for himself, hatarat nedarim doesn't be sufficient, he need Sheelat Chacham to allow the neder.</p>\n\n\n",

We will examine one of them, the relevant one for this question.</p>\n<p>When someone - 1 - already said the name of G-d, <strong>and</strong> when - 2 - only one Beracha is needed, (not a couple of consecutive Berachot as in Havdala), <strong>and</strong> - 3 - the said Bracha and the needed Bracha are linked (in their function), e.g. two Berachot which are said before food eating, the Gemara Brachot 12a {1} can give some answers. You wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>I accidentally say asher yatzar when I'm commencing a berakha over food</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfot {2} reports diverse opinions on this Sugia, Rif principle of Kula, RI principle of Chumra and RaCh. Following the principle of the Rif, there is a Safek Derabanan, leKula. The psak, is issued from the non-conclusion of the Gemara.  It is allowed to correct the blessing statement Toch Kede Dibur. And the Shem Hashem and Malchut was said in a approximately right intention, even if destined to an other kind of Bracha.</p>\n<p>The Chidush of Rach (Note that this pshat on Rabenu Chanan'el is based on the reading of the Tosfot, not on Rabenu Chanan'el on the daf. It is also different from the pshat of Raavad in sefer Catuv Sham and on Rambam hilchot Brachot chapter 8).</p>\n<p>Tosfot described following RaCh a special situation, similar to this described by the OP. Here are the two examples described in Tosfot. <strong>First case</strong>: A man knows that he holds a glass of wine and inadvertently, he blessed something else; <strong>second case</strong>: he knows that today is Yom Tov and the prayer is the prayer of Yom Tov, but has inadvertently said \"Mekadesh Hashabbat\".  According to RaCh, these two examples are equivalent to the cases of the Gemara, because here, there is no mistake concerning what is blessed (wine, Yom Tov) and how to bless (Knows the right Bracha), only there was a discrepancy between the intended and the spoked thinking. So, the Shem Hashem (and Malchut) was well oriented (right object, right intentional thinking).\nAccording to this chidush of RaCh, if you wanted to say Asher Yatsar and kown why, but your mouth said Hamotsi Leshem. You can rectify toch Kede Dibbur.</p>\n<p>Without the Chidush of RaCh, it is less obvious, may be not good and you need to repeat the whole Bracha (to answer this side see Raavad).  RI also explained that the problem of the Gemara is that a Kavana for somewhat else is different from lack of Kavana, it is an opponed Kavana for an object excluded from the Bracha is an opponed Kavana to the Bracha, not only a lack of Kavana. (this is an important svara for understanding several problems in this suggia). See SA <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1036\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 209 1-2</a> after the reading of Tosfot. The Shulchan Aruch follows the Rambam on his first words, and in \"Yesh Omrim\" follows the Pshat described above (Rashi and Baal Hamaor). Magen Avraham stated as the last. Mishna Berura too (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=236&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">209 sk 2</a>)</p>\n<p>So:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>If somebody does start saying asher yatzar in a berakha that does not require it, should s/he stop and start again from the beginning?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--> No, toch Kede Dibbur he need to correct and properly blessing after Haolam.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Is there a fall-back berakha? </code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--> after Hashem, \"lammedeni Chukkecha\" (Tehilim 119), ruled in SA OC (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1032\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">206, 6</a>).

My guess is that in most places it's a <em>safek sfeika</em> (<em>safek</em> that the site is a mass grave, plus the additional <em>safek</em> that the people murdered there were Jewish), but in some places those <em>sfeikot</em> collapse into reasonable certainty.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example, while a kohen might not be able to visit Babi Yar, Ponary, Serniki and other such places, does that mean that they also cannot wander through the woods and fields in their environs?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could Zimri be Shelumiel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After mulling over <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/73733/how-do-we-know-that-zimri-was-the-same-person-as-shlumiel-ben-tzurishaddai\">this question</a> for a bit, I realized that there's a big problem with that Gemara quoted there. Shelumiel is listed back in Bamidbar 1, before the sin of the Meraglim. By the time the stories recounted in Balak happened, everyone from the previous generation had died. How, then, did Shelumiel Ben Tzurishadai survive that he could commit the sin with Kozbi?</p>\n\n<p>The decree of the generation dying ended on Tu b'Av (Taanis 30b). Aharon had died fifteen days earlier, on Rosh Chodesh Av (Bamidbar 33:38). It was some time after that that Sichon and Og attacked at the end of Chukas (RH 2b makes clear that this happened after Aharon died) and it was as a result of Klal Yisrael's astonishing victory that Balak sent for Bilam (Bamidbar 22:2-4). When that plan failed, Bilam advised him with Plan B at Shittim (Rashi to Bamidbar 25:1) which resulted in the sin of Zimri and Kozbi (Bamidbar 25:6, 25:14-15). Thus, there is no room to say that the parshios are out of order, or that not everyone had died yet at this point. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Rashi, peshuto shel Mikra (the actual meaning), there's nothing that points to him actually being Shlumiel ben Tzurishaddai in the literal sense (in fact, the opposite is implied when Rashi mentions that he was the head of only one family) and seemingly the Gemara in Sanhedrin (82b) is seen as Agadeta. Aggadeta is not necessarily the posheter peshat, the exact meaning, and it could well be that he learned from Shlumiel (similar to Yehoshua being an extension of Moshe), who in turned learned from (or was) Shaul bas Dinah.  </p>\n\n<p>The Yalkut Reuvaini explains that Zimri was a gilgul of Shechem and a spark of Zimri later became Rabi Akiva, so there's another source that would lend credence to Zimri not actually being Shlumiel Ben Tzurishadai, a Tzadik.</p>\n\n<p>However, from Bamidbar 14:29 and Rashi there, the gezaira (decree) on the Dor HaDeah to pass on in the wilderness, it seems that the decree only applies to those counted, those who were between 20-60.  If Zimri was as old as some commentators say, this would answer the question.</p>\n\n<p>Edit:  Here's a source that backs this up.</p>\n\n<p>From the Shem MiShmuel who clearly says that Zimri had parts of their (Shlumiel Ben Tzurishadai and Shaul Ben Shimon/Dinah)'s souls in him.  </p>\n\n<p>וכנראה מה שנלכד זמרי בפח, אף שהיה אדם גדול נשיא בישראל, והיו בו עוד נשמות גבוהות מהקודמין מהשבעים נפש שירדו למצרים, שאול בן הכנענית ושלומיאל בן צורישדי, שקאי על הנשמות, שרחוק לומר כפשוטו, שהרי עברו כבר יותר מר\"נ שנה, ועוד שכבר כלו מתי מדבר, ואף למאן דאמר דלא מתו יותר מבני ששים, תצטרך לומר ששלומיאל כשנתמנה זקן היה, מה שאין כן במשמע, ובודאי הפירוש שקאי על הנשמות, ואולי היה מעותד לתיקונים גדולים, ובאו נשמות אלו לסייעו, אבל נתקלקל לו הענין, ונלכד בפח... ונראה שנמשך זה מחמת פגם ההמון, שידוע שההמון פוגמים את הצדיקים וצריכין שמירה יתרה,</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam (Tosfos Bava Basra 121a 'yom shekalu') suggests that 15,000 people  who were originally supposed to die during the last year were spared (including Yehoshua and Kalev). Shlumiel could very possibly have been among them.</p>\n\n\n",

Finding sources that would support this definitively would take quite a bit of work but it makes sense in terms of the reasoning.</p>\n\n<p>In general, a large part of the story of the redemption from Egypt involves a particular name of G-d that was revealed to Moshe Rabbeinu. That name is referred to as the '72 letter name' or the 'name of 72 triplets, also called the 'Great Name'.</p>\n\n<p>As explained in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30801&st=&pgnum=157\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer Tzaror HaMor, parshat Beshalach, page 12</a> starting with the words (ויבאו בני ישראל כו׳) it says that this name is related to the aspect of the redemption that makes G-ds 'Great Name' known to the nations (Mitzrayim). It also explains on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30801&st=&pgnum=159\" rel=\"nofollow\">page 13 beginning with the words</a> (ובזוהר כתבו כו׳) that this idea is what we say in the the 'P'sukei d'zimra' when reciting the 'Shirat HaYam...' with the words, \"וברב גאונך תהרס קמיך כו׳\" and that it is also what is mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.26?lang=bi&with=Metzudat%20David&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yechezkel chapter 38</a> in relation to the war of Gog and Magog. In regard to Gog and Magog, it says that the 'Komeicha' are like 'buildings' that will be destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, according to the explanation from the Zohar there, which is said in the name of the early Rishon, Rabbi Yosef Kimchi and the Tanna, Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, it seems to be a direct reference to the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The destruction of these two special buildings are the sign mentioned in Yechezkel which indicates the beginning of the third and final installment of the War of Gog and Magog.</p>\n\n<p>The words of Yechezkel 38:4, \"ונתתי חחים בלחייך כו׳\" means 'I will place '<em>chochim</em>' in '<em>lechayecha</em>'. '<em>Chochim</em>' (חחים) which means '<em>chains</em>', like the reins connected to the bridle of a horse (The bridle and reins are how you control and direct a horse.), and also חוח '<em>thorns</em>', which if one is pricked by them causes one to move away and to take action.) '<em>Lechayecha</em>', means (לחיא) '<em>the cheek piece of the bridle</em>' and also has a meaning of '<em>your fortresses</em>' (לחייתא means '<em>fortress</em>'), But when taken literally this can also refer to a pair of '<em>lechi's</em>'.</p>\n\n<p>A 'Lechi' (לחי) is a pillar attached to the ground and of unlimited height used to create a halachic wall or doorway. When two pillars are attached across the top by a string, they take on this special status of '<em>lechi</em>'. On August 7, 1974, shortly after the completion of the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, they were attached by a cable strung across the top of them by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippe_Petit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Philippe Petit</a> in order to perform his tight-wire walk between the two towers. The twin towers acquired the status of being a pair of '<em>lechi's</em>'.) This destruction of the two towers serves the same type of purpose as the plagues in Egypt and the splitting of the Yam Suf and heralds the process of 'turning (or converting 'אתהפכה')  <em>kol rishei aretz</em> (all the inhabitants of the world) to serve You' like is mentioned in the second paragraph of the Aleinu prayer.</p>\n\n<p>This 'Great Name' is actually comprised of 72 three letter combinations (for a total of 216 letters) which are formed through the weaving together of the three posukim, Shemot 14:19-21. The first posuk is arranged in correct reading order and is associated with Avraham Avinu and the 'Sefirah' of 'Chesed' ('Chesed' or 'Kindness' (חסד) has a 'gematria' of 72). The second posuk is arranged in reverse reading order and is associated with Yitzchok Avinu and the 'Sefirah' of 'Gevurah' ('Gevurah' or 'Strength' or 'Might' (גבורה) is the idea of 'Ish Gever', a person who overpowers their own nature. 'Gevurah' has a gematria of 216). The final posuk is arranged in correct reading order and is associated with Yaacov Avinu and the 'Sefirah' of 'Tiferet' or 'Rachamim'. 'Rachamim' meaning 'Mercy' mediates and balances between 'Chesed' and 'Gevurah' but is inclined to the side of 'Chesed'. This is the process of converting (Called אתהפכה). The 216 letters if 'pronounced' as they are in a single string express as 'Gevurah'. But if 'pronounced' as the 72 triplets, they are converted from 'Gevurah' and expressed as 'Chesed'. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of the Avodah in the first Temple, this process is associated with the moment of the burning of the 'korbonot'. This is described in Midrash as when a 'lion of Heavenly fire' would descend upon the alter and consume the offering, converting it to a 'pleasing odor' (ריח ניחח). 'Lion' (אריה) also has a 'gematria' of 216, an allusion to the aspect of Gevurah being converted by the 'Great Name'.</p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting that in 'Mispar Katan' (ריח ניחח), the phrase associated with the korbonot has a gematria of 33. This is the same Mispar Katan gematria of (חחים בלחייך) from Yechezkel 38:4 if the words and kollel are included.</p>\n\n<p>This type of '<em>72 letter</em>' name  is associated with the discipline of Prophecy and there are examples in some of the more obscure kabbalistic literature of other 72 group triplets formed from different posukim.</p>\n\n<p>The concept with this name as used by Moshe Rabbeinu is that meditation upon this name (or, if one is in the state and physical condition where it is permissible to, pronouncing this name) is connected to converting things to their opposite.</p>\n\n<p>It was via use of this name that Moshe smote the Egyptian, converting the Egyptian from being alive to being dead. This name was also connected to the sign given by G-d to Moshe at the burning bush of converting the staff of Moshe into the 'Nachash' and back again. This sign was repeated when first appearing before Pharaoh. It was also associated with the miracle of turning the sea to dry land  at the Yam Suf.</p>\n\n<p>This name is also part of the 'kavanot' that are made when saying 'Shema' each day, both on the first posuk and also with the paragraph beginning \"V'Hayah...\" and again at the paragraph of \"Vayomer...\".</p>\n\n<p>It is also associated with the 'Avodah of Yom Kippur' when the Kohen Gadol pronounces the 'Great Name' of G-d aloud and the people prostrate themselves before G-d. This was the moment when the crimson string which was tied around the Alter would convert from red to white indicating their 'Teshuvah' had been accepted.</p>\n\n<p>In regard to Bilaam, the Torah states that Bilaam told Balak he could only do what he was permitted to do by G-d  (Meaning he could only say whatever curse he was permitted to pronounce.) <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">BaMidbar 22:8-13</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Bilaam essentially knew the precise moment of each day when G-d sits in judgement. (This is why Bilaam's level of prophecy was compared to Moshe's. Just like is emphasized in the Hagaddah in regard to Moshe Rabbeinu when he told Pharaoh the plague of the firstborn would be 'around midnight'. But the commentaries emphasize that Moshe Rabbeinu knew precisely when the plague would begin.) In fact, Bilaam is described in places as the 'Prophet of the Nations', like Moshe Rabbeinu was our Prophet.</p>\n\n<p>But for his curses to be effective, the charge or accusation had to actually exist. Bilaam's curses were only that he drew attention to some deficiency in the accused, meaning the one being cursed, at the moment of judgement which precipitated immediate judgement.</p>\n\n<p>So the fixing of the precise text of his curse had to be revealed to him from Above. This follows the explanation of <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=275\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kli Yakar on BaMidbar 23:6</a>. That revelation begins with the 'letters of thought' which descend from a level that is called '<em>Mochah Stimah</em>' and eventually evolves downward to be expressed through the 'letters of speech' which are pronounced with ones mouth. And the conversion from curse to blessing would appear to be at the moment of pronouncing them, when they expressed physically and materially, like is said in Targum Yonatan ben Uziel to this same posuk.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be the reference being made in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">B'Midbar 24:1</a>. That the aspect of 'Lo' (ולא---הלך), the 'Gevurah' aspect which expresses through the five parts of the mouth, meaning the five 'Gevurot', <em>went</em>, meaning behaved, like the time with the 'Nachashim', the serpents. The first time was when G-d showed this sign to Moshe Rabbeinu at the burning bush and the second time was in front of Pharaoh. The three 'Brichot' connecting 'Lo' and 'Halach' allude to the three posukim which make up the 'Great Name' of 72 triplets.</p>\n\n<p>This same idea, of 'Gevurah' being converted to 'Chesed', is reflected in what we recall in connection to Tefillin when reciting the paragraph of 'Kadesh...'. That for the Jewish people 'Yad Chazakah' was redemption but for the Egyptians it was the plagues. The hand Tefillin is placed on the left arm, the weak arm and yet for B'nai Yisrael it is 'called' the strong arm, meaning the right arm. The left side is associated with the quality of 'Gevurah' while the right side is associated with 'Chesed'.</p>\n\n<p>The same sentiment is repeated in connection with Purim at the conclusion of Megillat Esther (8:16) which we recall at the conclusion of Shabbat each week. 'For the Jews there was light and gladness and joy and honor.\" So may it be for us.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is the title: \"New\" Testament offensive to Jews? Alternative neutral name?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Having lived in Israel during several periods of my life, I know that the words \"Old\" in the \"Old Testament\" and \"New\" in the \"New Testament\" are offensive to many Jews. From what I understand, it's because \"old\" tends to have negative connotations (ex: outdated, irrelevant, decrepit, obsolete) and \"new\" has positive connotations (ex: new and improved, better, more relevant, contemporary, updated). I understand their logic and sentiment about all of that! In fact, I agree with them wholeheartedly. Let's be honest, if you were to say: \"do you want this 'old' toy [any item, really] or this 'new' toy [any item, really]?\" the majority of people will prefer the \"new\" item because we tend to associate \"new\" with \"better quality,\" especially in comparison to anything \"old\" (unless you're an antique collector, historian, etc).</p>\n<p>Thus, like Jews, I prefer to call the \"Old Testament,\" the \"Hebrew Bible\" -- so it's free of all those negative connotations. This is not just because I want to be PC or demonstrate my respect/sensitives towards their perspectives (though both are true), but also, I think... even as a Christian, though we value both bodies of scriptures, the \"old\" in \"Old Testament\" carries that same negative baggage with it... \"It's too old and obscure to understand... and irrelevant since Christ fulfilled the Law of Moses....\" And I think this is a dangerous approach to this sacred literary corpus insomuch we develop preconceived notions that it will be too challenging to comprehend/apply and worse, insignificant (I don't think we do it consciously, it's just embedded in the word \"old\"). Consequently, we have an innate proclivity to value it less... And this is sad since there is much to be gleaned from the Hebrew Bible! From the Hebrew Bible, the divine covenants concerning salvation were taught as well as the Abrahamic covenant, etc. etc. Many of these principles and prophecies are timeless, and should not be burdened down by the word \"old,\" which denigrates its worth and authority a bit.</p>\n<p>Now, I am not naive, and I know the Christian communities will never adopt such a name change because it's just not practical nor a priority, mostly because most people don't care and a change in the name will just cause confusion, and cause more problems. To be clear, I'm not advocating/promoting that the Churches do so.... But, I must say, that I am pleased to see that \"Hebrew Bible\" is being used more and more in biblical scholarship and the academic spheres. Personally, I'm going to use it in lieu of \"Old Testament,\" (even within a Christian context) and I will be happy to explain/elucidate my reasoning to whoever I'm speaking to.</p>\n<p>However, after this long-winded spiel, I realize (and I'm sure you have by now, too) that I don't know what neutrally-charged, more appropriate, title to use when referencing the \"New\" Testament. I know within the walls of synagogues, the \"New Testament\" is not a likely topic that arises, but how do I reference it in an inter-faith academic dialogue if I don't want to pin on the \"New\" connotations?  In acadamia/biblical scholarships, what name/title do they ascribe to the \"New Testament.\" I'm assuming, they probably call it \"New Testament\" just so that everyone is on the same page and knows what they are talking about... but if we were to have a \"Hebrew Bible\" equivalent for the \"New Testament,\" what would it likely be? \"Greek Bible\" doesn't work because the Septuagint (LXX) is the Hebrew Bible translated in Greek by Jews (hundreds of years before the existence of the \"New Testament\")... \"Christian Bible\" doesn't work because that seems to confine Christians to only the \"New Testament,\" which only perpetuates the dilemma. Or is there already one, and I am just uninformed?</p>\n<p>Basically, how do Jews refer to the \"New\" Testament? What is PC?</p>\n<p>Todah!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Thank you for your sensitivity.</p>\n\n<p>The issue with \"old\" and \"new\" isn't <em>just</em> what you said about \"old and outdated, new and shiny\".  It's also that, to us, the latter isn't a \"testament\" at all.  God made a covenant with Israel at Sinai and God does not break His word, so to say that He set aside that covenant to make a new, contradictory one is problematic.</p>\n\n<p>When I have participated in discussions with Christians and needed a general term, I've generally used the phrase \"Christian books\", a habit I learned from one of my rabbis.  This, unlike \"Christian Bible\", doesn't imply that it's the <em>whole</em> Christian corpus.  The phrase \"Christian books\" seems, in my experience, to be clear and non-controversial, assuming you've already established that you're talking about bibles and not, say, papal edicts.</p>\n\n<p>After reading <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/73819/472\">this answer</a> I thought of another possibility: \"Christian canon\".  I'm not sure whether Christians would understand that to mean the Hebrew Bible too, but you could explore that if you don't like \"Christian books\".</p>\n\n<p>This might seem like a nit, but I try to avoid calling those books \"scriptures\", as \"scripture\" can have the connotation, in a religious context, of being from God.  We don't believe that about your books.  You could probably get away with \"Christian scriptures\", but try \"Christian books\" instead -- I think it will serve you well and not lead to the occasional raised eyebrows that \"scriptures\" might.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I can see how <em>Christian books</em> could be useful; however, there are so many <a href=\"http://www.christianbook.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Christian books</a> out there; <em>Christian books</em> may just be too broad.

If you find a battered suitcase along the side of a highway, it is a found object, it has fallen from a car. To take a coat on coat rack is not a found object, it is a robbery. The fly company puts the suitcases and they are not left. A whole system is implemented, including insurance and delivery. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See Gemara <strong>BM 21a</strong> \"אי דרך הינוח... <em>רש\"י</em> עתיד לחזור וליטלן\": \"And if it appears to have been [deliberately] put down, then even if there is a smaller quantity it should not [belong to the finder]\"\n  <strong>BM 25b</strong> \" ואמר רבי אבא בר זבדא אמר רב: כל ספק הינוח - לכתחילה לא יטול\": \"and R'Abba B'Zabda said in Rab's name: Whenever it is doubtful if an article was left [in a certain spot], one must not take it in the first instance;\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See SA CM 260, 9, about an object that you know that is was laid.

    "content": "# Name change after 30 days?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So I recall somewhere (probably in the Gemara) that if a person who is called by a certain name for +30 days, that name gets to be his new name, is that true? I know the sages always said stuff that has really important meaning behind it, so is this a deep meaning thing, something that we used to do, or literal thing that we still do?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think you're thinking of Bava Basra 167b. In context, the Gemara is questioning whether the scribe needs to know the man's and/or woman's names on bills of divorce or receipt ahead of time. The concern is that there might be two men with the same name in the city, or two women with the same name in the city, and the man may give it to a woman who's not actually his wife, she will think she's divorced when she isn't, and she'll remarry while still being married already. In that discussion, the Gemara asks:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וליחוש דלמא אזיל למתא אחריתא ומחזיק ליה לשמיה ביוסף בן שמעון וכתיב גיטא וממטי ליה לאיתתיה דהיאך</p>\n  \n  <p>But we should be concerned that maybe he'll go to another city, establish a false name for himself as Yosef ben Shimon, write the bill of divorce and give it to the wife of another man [whose name actually is Yosef ben Shimon]!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara answers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר להו רב הונא בר חיננא הכי אמר רב כל שהוחזק שמו בעיר שלשים יום אין חוששין לו</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Huna bar Chinana said to them, thus did Rav say: <strong>Anyone whose name has been established in a city for thirty days, there's no concern about him [that the name is false].</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If this is indeed what you're thinking of, then it doesn't sound like this is something that was regularly done, so much as a theoretical case that they were addressing. When you ask it there's a \"deep meaning\" or if it's \"something that we used to do, or literal thing we still do,\" the answer seems to be no to each of those questions.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hashem's apparent inconsistency with Bilam\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does anyone know of a convincing explanation of Hashem's behaviour with Bilam? It looks like He couldn't be more inconprehensible if He tried.</p>\n\n<p>First, He starts off by refusing to allow Bilam to go at all. Then after merely being asked again, He allows him to go so long as he recognises that he will have to say what Hashem forces him to say. Then, having allowed him to go, He sends an angel to kill Bilam. For some reason, the angel doesn't actually do this and after Bilam asks whether he should go back, the angel again allows him to go.</p>\n\n<p>What is going on with Hashem? If He didn't want Bilam to go originally, why did He change His mind simply by being asked again? If He didn't care whether Bilam went because He would put the right words in Bilam's mouth, why did He refuse originally? After having allowed Bilam to go, why send an angel to kill him? After having specially sent an angel, why didn't the angel actually do its job and kill him? And after going to all this trouble to intercept him after having giving him permission, why just allow Bilam to carry on as before? The angel doesn't seem to have achieved anything?!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Saadia Gaon</a> (Emunot V'Deiot 3:9) explains that there was no contradiction between God's two statements to Bilam:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sixth [uncertainty arises from] God's injunction to Balaam in regard to the emissaries of Balak: <em>Thou shalt not go with them</em> (Num. 22:12) and his [counter-]order to him later on: <em>Go with them</em> (Num. 22:20). But this, too, did not constitute an abrogation, because the people he went with were not the same as those with whom God had forbidden him to go. For Scripture states: <em>And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they</em> (Num. 22:15). God had, then, kept him from going with the base and given him leave to go with the distinguished emissaries, in order thereby to enhance Balaam's esteem, so that it might be said that God had delivered the children from the yoke of so-and-so of exalted station.</p>\n<p>(Rosenblatt translation p. 169-170)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> also explains that God did not change his mind about whether Bilam could go or not. He explains that Bilam misunderstood the words <em><a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0422.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people; for they are blessed.'</a></em> to mean that he couldn't go at all, when in reality God only meant that he couldn't go to curse them. Thus, the second time Balak sent emissaries God <em>clarified</em> that Bilam could go but he would only be able to do what God would say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר\"ל אם הם רוצים לקרוא לך שתבוא אצל בלק קום לך אתם אך לא תלך שם לקוב את העם כמו ששואל בלק אך את הדבר אשר אדבר אליך אותו תעשה ואמנם אמר לו כך כי תחילה\nאמר לו ה' ית'  לא תלך עמהם לא תאר את העם כי ברוך הוא וחשב בלעם מזה\nהמאמר שה' ית' מנע ממנו ההליכה עמהם אע\"פ שלא יאור את העם ולזה אמר אל שרי מואב כי מאן ה לתתי להלֹך עמכם ולזה אמר לו עתה שאינו מונע ממנו ההליכה אל בלק אך מונע ממנו מה ששאל ממנו לקוב את העם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ralbag further explains that the encounter with the angel did not happen in real life. Rather, that night after God told him to go Bilam had a vision/dream in which he saw himself going, but since he was going with the intent to harm Israel – contrary to God's command – an angel came to threateningly remind him that he was not allowed to go to harm Israel, but only to do as God would say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנראה בעינינו לפי השרשים האמיתיים הנראים מדברי הנביאים ומן העיון  שזה הספור היה ענין שקרה לבלעם במראה הנבואה  כמו הענין בספור לקיחת הושע גמר בת דבלים ושאר מה שנמשך בספור ההוא  אשר הוא בהכרח דבר נראה לו במראה הנבואה  לא דבר שקרה\nוהנה נדמה לבלעם בחלומו של נבואה שכבר היה לילה  כשבאהו דבר ה' ית' במה שאמר לו אם לקרא לך באו האנשים קום לך אתם ואחר זה נדמה לו בחלומו שהיה בקר  ושהוא קם וחבש את אתונו והלך עם שרי מואב  כי כן היתה הסכמתו אם היה מקיץ לפי שאין מראין לו לאדם אלא מהרהורי לבו  ולזה תמצא כי תכונות האדם בחלומו הם מתיחסות לתכונותיו בהקיץ  והנה סבב ה' יתעלה שיקרה לו בהליכתו מה שהורה לו שלא הסכימו מן השמים שילך שם לתכלית אשר הוא פונה אליו  כי היה דעתו על כל פנים להשתדל להזיק לישראל לפי היכולת  ולזה ספר שקרה לו זה המקרה  כי האתון נטתה מן הדרך והלכה בשדה  וכאשר הכה  בלעם אותה להטותה הדרך נלחצה אל הקיר ולחצה רגל בלעם אל הקיר  ושב להכותה  ואחר זה רבצה תחתיו  ושב להכותה  ונדמה לו בחלומו כאילו פתח ה' ית' את פי האתון ודברה עמו שתי פעמים  והוא השיב לה כדבר איש לאיש אחר  ואחר נראה לו המלאך  ונתבאר לו מדברי המלאך בחלומו שנטית האתון מן הדרך היתה מפני ראותה מלאך ה'  והנה אמר אם רע בעיניך אשובה לי  לפי שהיה דומה לו שכבר החזיק בדרך  ובא לו הצווי שנית שילך עם האנשים  אך לא ידבר רק מה שידבר אליו ה' ית' וזה כולו היה מהשגחת ה' ית' על ישראל  כמו שזכרנו  כי זה היה הראוי שיוסיף אימה לבלעם מעבור את פי ה' ית' בהשתדלותו לגרום נזק לישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, according to Ralbag, God's position remained consistent throughout the entire episode.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caspi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Kaspi</a> explains that God's permission to go wasn't entirely permission, as God said it \"in an angry tone\". There is no contradiction to God's anger later flaring up when Bilam went, since God had really been angry about it the entire time:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נפשנו קצה באריכות קדמוני המפרשים ואומר כי התבאר בספרי הפלוסופים ויותר בספר ההטעאה כי הדבור האחד יש לו הוראות מתנגדות מצד הערת המדבר אם ברצוי אם בהפכו ורבים כן בכל המקרא כמ״ש על דרך משל מי האומר שאול ימלך עלינו ולכן נאמר מפי סופרים ולא מפי ספרים לכן אף על פי שאמר השם לבלעם קודם לך אתם היתה צורת הדבור בצאתו מפיו דרך כעס והעדר הרצוי והעד ויחד אף אלהים כי הולך הוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for the altercation with the angel, Ibn Kaspi explains that it was to show Bilam that if God wanted to He could easily stop Bilam from going altogether, but he could also allow him to go and then still prevent him from doing anything negative to Israel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היה זה בתנומה כי התנמנם בלעם עת מה ברכבו כמנהג רבים מבני אדם כל שכן בעבור שהשכים בבוקר והכה לבו אותו על מהלכו לאותות כבר ראה במניעה הראשונה וגם במראה השנית כי הסתפק בדבור השם לו קום לך אתם באי זה צורה נאמר עד כי נשקע ישן או מתנמנם בזה הענין והגיע לו כל הדמיון הנזכר והנה אלו רצה השם למנעו על כל פנים ככר עשה זה אך רצה השם להראות לו ולעמים כי יש לאל ידו למנעו לגמרי וגם להתיר [הליכתו] ולמנעו מהדבור הרע לכן סיים המלאך ואמר לו (לה) לך עם האנשים לשון פיוס ורצוי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This again resolves the apparent contradiction in the angel's actions in addition to God's.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Reisman points out that Ramban states that Balaam was not really a navi, but was attempting to use his magic to set himself up as one. Hashem's reaction to this was to give him the opportunity to raise himself to the highest level that he could. Balaam refused to take advantage of the opportunities that he was given and at each choice, was given a chance at the lower level that he reached.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch among others explains that if someone insists on trying to disobey Ahashem's will, Hashem will allow him to destroy himself. For example, in the explanation of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=12&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">Balak 22:12-13</a> Rav Hisrch points out</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>12</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Now had Balaam been a prophet of the Truth he would faithfully have\n  transmitted this declaration of Hashem to the envoys of Balak and the\n  purpose of Hashem's intervention would have been achieved without the\n  whole following episode. Balak, andMoav, instead of fearing the\n  attacking and conquering might of this People, would have been induced\n  to know the moral factor which was innate in it to which Hashem had\n  promised His blessing and to befriend them to their own advantage.\n  <strong>But</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>13</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Balaam suppressed the second part, the really essential part of\n  Hashem's warning. He just speaks in general terms מאן השם, which\n  forthwith allows it to be understood tat he himself would be pleased\n  to curse the people, only מאן השם לתתי להלוך עמכם, the Hashem Whose\n  prophet I am does not finnd it befitting for me to go with <em>you</em>.\n  After all, they were only, as remarked above, זקני מואב not שרי מואב,\n  only plebeans, not really princes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result of this,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Balak knew his man and did not let himself be put off from his by the\n  first refusal</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result of Balaam attempting to work around Hashem, Hashem says, that if it for your personal honor that they came for you, go ahead and try to go with them. However, do not forget that you were categorically forbidden to curse the Bnai Yisrael, even though you hid that from Moav.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>20</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>We have already remarked on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9950#v=17&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">verses 16 &\n  17</a>\n  that Balak's request had two points (a) that Balaam come at his\n  invitation and (b) that he curses Israel. For the first part he was\n  given permission, regarding the second part, whic constituded the real\n  intended purpose of Balak, it had in verse 12, already at the first\n  mission had been peremptorily denied to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we see, Hashem is telling Balaam that <strong>if he insists</strong> on going, he will only be able to convey the blessing, the exact opposit of what Balak inteds.</p>\n\n<p>The question now arises, why was Hashem angry? The reason given by Rav Hisrsch is that while Balaam was given permission to go with the messengers (אתם) he actually went with the intention to somehow bring about their purpose.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>22</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>not כי הלך that he went with Balak's messengers, ... But he did not\n  just go with them, הולך הוא, he was \"goer\" with them, one striving to\n  reach his own end. In spite of the definite warning he had received\n  from Hashem, his mind was still obscured by the obsession that he\n  would be able to achieve the purpose so desired by Balak and himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result, the מלאך is sent to point out the result of what he is attempting to do. It is actually a final attempt to show mercy to Balaam and get him do do teshuvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Malbim says something really fascinating.

The combination, by the answerer, of Rabbi Ammi with that other statement, such that those four thus have \"sin\", is thus explicitly against that gemara, which considers it a <strong>refutation</strong>.)</p>\n<p>The \"kick\" (not hit) of the snake is that reality was set that mankind was mortal due to the incident in the Garden of Eden. This is an interpretation of <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0102.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 2:17</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי, בְּיוֹם אֲכָלְךָ מִמֶּנּוּ--מוֹת תָּמוּת</p>\n<p>for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>as well as in the depriving of the opportunity to eat from the Tree of Life in <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0103.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 3:23</a>, that having knowledge of good and evil is inconsistent with eternal life.</p>\n<p>This is a decree upon the world, and the way the natural laws of the world have been set. It is not a condemnation of the moral status of the righteous.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, based on the link you provided, this is <a href=\"http://www.theopedia.com/original-sin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Original Sin</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Original sin is the doctrine which holds that human nature has been morally and ethically corrupted due to the disobedience of mankind's first parents to the revealed will of God. In the Bible, the first human transgression of God's command is described as the sin of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden resulting in what theology calls the Fall of mankind. The doctrine of original sin holds that every person born into the world is tainted by the Fall such that all of humanity is ethically debilitated, and people are powerless to rehabilitate themselves, unless rescued by God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nothing in the Talmud indicates ethical debilitation, or that they require rescuing by God or Jesus, or else they will burn in Hell forever. A person starts out with a blank slate, and based on good deeds, he will be rewarded, and based on bad deeds, he will be punished.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the very website you linked made this distinction explicit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eastern Orthodoxy, Judaism, and Islam acknowledge that the introduction of sin into the human race affected the subsequent environment for mankind, but deny any inherited guilt or necessary corruption of man's nature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would note that Orthodox Judaism is not monolithic, and I cannot speak for every possible opinion out there. And when you get to the territory of kabbalah, besides being something which often not everyone agrees to (see e.g. how the Vilna Gaon, a kabbalist, did not take Arizal's kabbalah as axiomatic), it is beyond the layman's ability to truly understand.</p>\n<p>Also, in general, your questions on this site which suggest Jewish parallels to Christian beliefs have the, perhaps unintended, undertone that, therefore, though Jews have not realized it until now, \"Judaism\" endorses Christianity. I am uncomfortable and not pleased with that (quasi-missionary) direction. Yes, there are enough opinions out there, and there is enough nuance in those opinions on a variety of subjects, that one can easily draw parallels between one and the other. That doesn't mean that the overall thrust is the same.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's an excellent question Sarah and one that requires careful consideration and thoughtful reflection.</p>\n\n<p>First, please bear in mind that the subjects mentioned in the 'answer' you found are borrowing heavily from the Prophets, midrashic and kabbalistic sources. So many of the ideas presented are to be understood allegorically, meaning interpretively, according to traditions passed down from generation to generation.</p>\n\n<p>It is also appropriate to point out that your question is both timely and relevant from the perspective that we are living in great anticipation of the complete and final redemption spoken of throughout the Torah. And as we are reminded in the Aleinu prayer, during that time, all the inhabitants of the earth will come to serve the Creator together, like is discussed in the censored section of the Mishnah Torah, Laws of Kings and Their Wars, chapter 11 at the end.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, the plans of the creator of the world--no person can understand them for our ways are not the same as His ways and our plans are not His plans. And all of these things about Jesus of Nazareth, and about that Ishmaelite who rose after him--they are only to make the path for the King Messiah straight, and to fix the whole world for worshipping G-d together, as it is said, \"For I will give the peoples clear speech, for them all to call out the name of G-d, and to worship Him with one purpose (Zephaniah 3:9)\n   How? The whole world is already filled with the words of the Messiah, and the words of the Torah, and the words of the Mitzvot, and these words have been spread on distant islands, and to many peoples of uncircumcised hearts, and they deal with these words, and with the mitzvot of the Torah--they say 'These mitzvot were true but they are already nullified in this time, they aren't applicable forever.' And they say, 'There are things hidden in them, and they're not just a simple meaning, and the Messiah already came and revealed their secrets.'\n   And when the King Messiah rises for real, and he succeeds, and he is lifted up and exalted, they will immediately return and will know that their ancestors passed down lies to them and that their prophets and their ancestors made them do wrong.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The essential difference between the Jewish and Christian view of 'original sin' is about the source of sin.</p>\n\n<p>The Christian concept is that 'sin' originates through a second 'power', which they refer to as the devil or Satan. The Christian view is that this 'power' is in a state of rebellion against G-d. It implies that there are two 'G-ds'. G-d created things in a state of perfection and without blemish. There is no sin and no death. And this was, according to Christian teaching, what G-d desired. Satan rebelled and challenged G-d and claimed dominion for himself. And this evolved into Satan influencing the serpent, who in turn influenced the first woman, who in turn caused sin to come into the world and then caused all other created things to sin and this caused death. And like you find in the fifth chapter of Romans which you cite, all of creation can only be saved from this terrible consequence by accepting Jesus as your personal intermediary between you and G-d.</p>\n\n<p>But such an idea is contrary to Jewish teaching and is a denial of G-d's unity like is taught in Mishnah Torah, Sefer Maddah, Chapter 1:1 and 1:5-6.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The foundation of foundations and pillar of wisdoms is to know that there is a Primary Cause and He causes to exist all that exists. And everything that exists from Heaven to Earth and everything in between would not exist except from the truth of His existence.</p>\n  \n  <p>G-d is one. He is not two and not more than two. Rather, He is one and His unity is unlike the unity of anything else that exists in the world. He is not like one genus that includes many individuals. And He is not like one body that can be divided into parts and extremities. Rather, His unity is such that there is no unity like His in the world. If there were many gods, they would possess bodies and forms, because things which are counted as equal in their existences are not separate one from the other, except in regard to the events that happen to bodies and forms. And if the Creator had a body and a form, He would have a time period and an end, because it is impossible to be a body that does not have a time period. And everything which possesses a time period and an end, also possesses an time period and limit to its power. And our G-d, blessed be His name, since His strength has no end and nothing to disrupt it - since the sphere revolves continuously (forever) - His strength is not the strength of a body. And since He does not have a body, events do not occur to Him as they occur to bodies, which can be split and divided by something else. Therefore it is impossible that He be anything but one. And the knowledge of this matter is a positive commandment, as it says, \"The L-rd is our G-d, the L-rd is One\" (Deut. 6:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And so the question still remains, 'What is the source of sin according to Jewish tradition and the Torah?'</p>\n\n<p>This is discussed, among other places in Bereshit Rabbah which explains that the final events of the six days of creation, meaning the creation of Adam HaRishon, his division into two (Adam and Chava) and the subsequent 'dressing in skins', meaning becoming dressed in physicality, were actually the ultimate expression of the paradigm which G-d had intended from the very beginning of creation and even before creation. It follows the same model as the single light of the first day and that light being divided into two great lights, followed by one of those lights being reduced in stature.</p>\n\n<p>And this paradigm follows what is discussed in kabbalistic literature about the light or expression of G-d creating the 'Makom Panoy' (empty place) and then bringing about the reintroduction of that first light via the 'Kav' and its interaction with the 'Reshimah' or 'residue' inside the Makom Panoy. And this paradigm also is the model of conception, gestation and birth.</p>\n\n<p>And this infinitely repeating system is what is transmitted through the Torah. The same Torah which is described as 'G-d's will' and which G-d 'looked into' two thousand years before the creation. The same Torah which said 'Adam sinned' two thousand years before the creation, meaning before the creation of Adam HaRishon.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the source of sin is also from the Creator of everything and ultimately serves and expresses His will.</p>\n\n<p>The reference from the Ari z\"l, which is from the opening chapters of Sha'ar HaGilgulim, is only expressing the unity and common purpose of all mankind which is to serve the 'Owner of all' (Koneh HaKol) like is said in the opening blessings of the Amidah prayer.</p>\n\n<p>And so this brings us to try to better understand the words of Rav Ami quoted above that, \"אין מיתה בלא חטא\". This is commonly translated as, 'there is no death without sin.' But the word 'חטא' has several different meanings aside from 'sin' or 'error' or 'mistake' which help to give understanding to this teaching. 'חטא' also has a meaning of cleansing like is found in Mishnah Yoma 5:5 and also the Talmud on the same subject, Yoma 58b and similarly Chullin 27a. 'חטא' also has a meaning of 'to cause someone to be generous or lenient' like is found in Kohelet Rabba on 9:18.</p>\n\n<p>So this suggests that the process of introducing 'death' to the world is in order to have a process of cleansing and to cause G-d to reveal His quality of generosity and leniency. This is the concept of 'teshuvah' and G-d's 13 aspects of mercy.</p>\n\n<p>And this leads to the final discussion in the answer that you cited. Namely, the Aggadic expression from the Sages, \"תנו רבנן ארבעה מתו בעטיו של נחש\".</p>\n\n<p>This translates as 'The Rabbis learned that four died as a result of the fangs of the serpent' (The 'serpent' mentioned here is the 'Nachash'.)</p>\n\n<p>To which the person writing that answer then brought Rahsi's comment on this statement:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בעטיו של נחש - בעצתו של נחש כלומר לא היו ראוין למות אלא שנגזרה גזירת מיתה על כל תולדותיו של אדם הראשון בעצתו של נחש בעטיו תרגום של עצתו כדכתיב (דניאל ו) אתייעטו כל וגו' וכן התיב עטא וטעם (שם ב):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>'Through the fangs of the serpent' - Through the advice of the serpent. That is to say that they were not deserving of death except through the decree of death on all the descendants of Adam HaRishon. 'Through the advice of the serpent', the word  for advice 'בעצתו' in Aramaic is 'בעטיו' (which translates in Hebrew as 'its fangs'), like is written in Daniel 6:8 and 2:14.</p>\n\n<p>So Rashi is explaining this Aggadic teaching according to the plain grammatical meaning. But that raises the additional question of what exactly is this 'serpent' (נחש). Serpents have fangs, but they do not give advice.</p>\n\n<p>And so, if we accept what Rashi points out, that the Rabbis were pointing to an unusual 'inner teaching' through this expression that is associated with the book of Daniel, we need to ask what is the nature of this teaching. How does the letter 'ט' in the word 'בעטיו' become the letter 'צ' of the word 'בעצתו'?</p>\n\n<p>This happens through the kabbalistic permutation taught to the Prophets called 'Ick-Bachar' (אי״ק-בכ״ר). The letters of the alphabet are divided into ones, tens and hundreds. They are interchangeable and imply specific concepts and spiritual transformations when they are exchanged.</p>\n\n<p>So for example, the 'Aleph' can be exchanged for the 'Yud' or the 'Kof' and the 'Beit' can be exchanged for the 'Kaf' or the 'Reish', and so on. In the case of the letter 'Tet', it is interchangeable with the letters 'Tzadik' and final 'Tzadik'.</p>\n\n<p>And if this is the nature of the teaching being discussed, then it would be relevant to apply similar kabbalistic transformations to the idea of the 'serpent' (נחש) in order to understand exactly who this is giving 'advice'.</p>\n\n<p>The letter 'Nun' in Nachash (נחש) is equal to the sum of the letters 'Mem' and 'Yud' (מ״י).</p>\n\n<p>And this suggests that the 'Nachash' giving this advice here can also be understood to mean 'Moshiach' (מישח). That the one who ultimately is destined to be responsible for completing this whole process, the entire purpose of creation, the concealing of G-d's light, the introduction of death and bringing the entire world to return to G-d through teshuvah and eternal life, is the one who gives the advice, namely our righteous Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>So the Jewish view is that what you are calling 'original sin', something absolutely negative according to the Christian view, is actually part of G-d's plan and is according to His will. It is positive and will result in the bestowing of His blessings of true good upon all of creation.</p>\n\n\n",

What's the novelty in that?! Because Joshua Ch.1 says <em>this text of the Torah shall never leave your mouth</em>, I might think that was intended literally; therefore the verse taught <em>you shall gather your grain</em> -- treat the words of Torah with worldliness [Rashi: as if you are starving, how will you study?]. These are the teachings of Rabbi Yishmael.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai, however, said: Is that possible?! If a man is plowing when it's plowing time, planting when it's planting time, harvesting when it's harvesting time, threshing when it's threshing time, winnowing when it's windy -- what will happen to the Torah that way?! Rather: when the Jewish people follow the will of God, their work shall be done by others, as Isaiah says: <em>foreigners shall stand up and tend your flocks</em>; when the people are not doing the will of God, <em>then</em> they'll have to do their own work, as Deuteronomy says -- <em>you shall gather your grain.</em>  Not only that, they'll have to wind up doing others' work too! As Deuteronomy says <em>[if you disobey God, ] you will serve your enemies.</em></p>\n<p>Said Abayei [several generations later]: many followed the teachings of Rabbi Yishmael, and they succeeded. Many followed the teachings of Rabbi Shimon son of Yochai, and they did not succeed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The plain reading of Abayei's conclusion is that for the \"many\", at least, Rabbi Yishmael's reading is right: go work.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Why do you think that \"everyone\" is studying in kolel? Last time I looked, unfortunately the majority of world Jewry doesn't even keep Shabbos. A minority of those who keep Shabbos make sure to learn Torah every day, and a tiny minority of those are learning in kolel. We have far less of the required 1 in 10 or 1 in 12 who should be learning full time. When we get to the point that 1 in 12 male Jews are learning in kolel, it will be a different discussion.</p>\n\n<p>A certain percentage of people studying full time was always considered a necessity to the Jewish people, starting from when we were in Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>(Rambam, Hilchot Avoda Zara, 1:3):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[Jacob] taught others and turned [the hearts] of all those who\n  gathered around him [to God]. He also taught all of his children. He\n  selected Levi and appointed him as the leader. He established him [as\n  the head of] the academy to teach them the way of God and observe the\n  mitzvot of Abraham.</p>\n  \n  <p>[Jacob] commanded his sons that the leadership should not depart from\n  the descendants of Levi, so that the teachings would not be forgotten.\n  This concept proceeded and gathered strength among the descendants of\n  Jacob and those who collected around them, until there became a nation\n  within the world which knew God.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the Jews extended their stay in Egypt, however, they learned from\n  the [Egyptians'] deeds and began worshiping the stars as they did,\n  with the exception of the tribe of Levi, who clung to the mitzvot of\n  the patriarchs - the tribe of Levi never served false gods.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They refused to work in Egypt and were saved from being enslaved: (Ramban Genesis 5:4, Shemot Rabba 5).</p>\n\n<p>Later they learned and taught Torah to the Jewish people and therefore did not receive a portion in Eretz Yisrael to farm.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam, Hilchos Shemittah V’Yovel 13:12:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why did the Tribe of Levi not receive a portion in Eretz Yisrael or a\n  share in the spoils of war along with their brethren?  They were\n  chosen to serve Hashem and teach His righteous ways and laws to the\n  masses, as it is written, “They shall teach Your statutes to Yaakov\n  and Your Torah to Yisrael.”  For this reason they were distanced\n  from the mundane ways of this world.  They do not go out to battle, as\n  do the rest of Bnei Yisrael.  They do not claim an inheritance of\n  land, nor merit success by their physical labors.  Instead, they are\n  the legion of Hashem, of whom it is written, “May Hashem bless his\n  strength (and accept the work of his hands).”  In return, Hashem\n  grants their material needs, as it is written, “I am your portion and\n  your inheritance.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But, as the Rambam writes next, anyone can choose to put himself in the position of someone from Levi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Not the Tribe of Levi alone, but each and every person, from wherever\n  he may come, whose spirit inspires him and intellect guides him to\n  stand out before Hashem; to serve Him and know Him, and to walk on the\n  straight path as G‑d has made us to do; and throw off his shoulders\n  the yoke of numerous worldly concerns which mankind seeks out, is thus\n  sanctified to become Holy of Holies.  Hashem will be his portion and\n  his inheritance for all eternity, granting him in this world his basic\n  needs, just as He granted the Kohanim and Leviim, as David HaMelech\n  said, “Hashem is my portion and my cup.  He supports my fortune.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, I cannot locate a source or any short blurb on its date, origin, and content? Do any of you know? Thanks! </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>After a bit more research, I found reference to the \"Testament of Hezekiah.\" It appears, that it's a component of the larger pseudegraphical text, \"Ascension of Isaiah.\" Perhaps why I couldn't find info at first, is that it is regarded as a \"Christian text\" -- though it is believed to have had Jewish origins, but was redacted by later Christians.</p>\n<p>Theories for its dates from 1st to 3rd centuries CE. It may actually be a compilation of multiple texts that were composed at different times and later compiled together.</p>\n<p>The overarching content of the \"Ascension of Isaiah\" concerns the martyrdom of Isaiah, wherein Isaiah warns King Hezekiah that Manessah (the next in line) will not continue to reign in righteousness. Once Isaiah's prophecy proves to be true, Isaiah and other prophets flee to the deserts for safety. Unfortunately, they are encountered by a false prophet, Belkira (inspired by the infamous demon, Beliar), and charges Isaiah of treason, and Manessah condemns Isaiah to death, which Belkira carries out. (Later, Isaiah ascends into the 7 heavens, etc). This is the \"Ascension of Isaiah.\" These are the sections believed to have Jewish origins (with the parallels of the demon Beliar also being present in the Book of Jubilees, fragments found in Qumran of the Testaments of the 12 Patriarchs, and the Sibylline Books. The other proposed Jewish parallel is the method of Isaiah's death -- being sawed in half -- as accounted for in both the Jerusalem and Babylonian Talmuds).</p>\n<p>As for \"The Testament of Hezekiah\" (and back to the question at hand) -- it is projected into the middle of the \"Ascension of Isaiah.\" This is the blatantly Christian portion of the text as it concerns a vision of Christ's \"future\" coming, the downfall of the Christian church due to corruption, the dreadful reign of Beliar (the demon), and ultimately the \"Second\" Coming. Some scholars think there are clear codes pointing to the persecution of the Church by the Roman emperor, Nero (which early Christians thought was the antichrist).</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm sorry for not finding this info before I posted the question, and thinking it was largely a Jewish text when it is actually a hybrid of Jewish and Christian texts. For those interested (if any), the information was located in James H. Charlesworth's \"Old Testament Pseudepigrapha\" (Hendrickson Publishers, 2010).</p>\n\n\n",

What are we afraid might be in them, whether through the equipment or directly?  Let's take the case of a dairy chocolate bar that wouldn't be served in the White House, to avoid bishul akum.

We would have to avoid benefiting from the chocolate bar, not just eating it.

Or is the reason we need a hechsher for chocolate bars something other than meat?  Or do we require a higher standard of knowledge for eating than for benefit?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are many <em>Biblical</em> issues with food additives, both pig and cow based, which would prohibit consumption.</p>\n\n<p>The food might contain a non-kosher species, such as pig or insect. The food might also contain a cow which was not slaughtered properly in accordance with the laws of shechita, which is a neveilah. Or it might contain forbidden fats, namely cheilev. These would be Biblical prohibitions for eating. (There are other possible eating concerns not mentioned.)</p>\n\n<p>What about basar bechalav? According to the <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.com/edu/wp-content/uploads/2012/samples/Basar%20B'chalav%2002.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dagul Merevava</a>, based on the Rambam (Maachalos Asuros 9:6), one prohibition cannot apply on top of another prohibition. So if the cow is a neveilah (most likely), then there would be no prohibition of basar bechalav, and thus no prohibition of benefit.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems fairly farfetched to assume an unlisted ingredient of prohibited material, plus that that material is specifically a <em>kosher</em> cow, in quantities that would render it a problem of basar bechalav.</p>\n\n\n",

For example (and not relating to the OP's question directly), the term \"strong hand and outstretched arm\" found in the Torah is a phrase used only regarding the Exodus from Egypt. Rabbi Berman also shows that it is a common term used throughout Egyptian writing when referring to some action carried out by the Pharaoh. Although this cannot be known, the phrase could have been appropriated into the Torah as a direct challenge to the Egyptian leadership who were the most powerful civilization of the time in the region. There is good reason to do this as will be explained.</p>\n<p>Specifically referring to the Mishkan, Rabbi Berman says that scholars debate its origin. However, some find stark similarity to the battle encampment of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramesses_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramsesses II</a> at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kadesh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battle of Kadesh</a>. Here is an Egyptian inscription of the encampment at the battle of Kadesh (at Abu Simbel):\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V8GBw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/V8GBw.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And here is a close-up of the military tent of Ramesses II, see <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/the-tabernacle-in-its-ancient-near-eastern-context\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this website</a>:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Wi0T9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Wi0T9.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Rabbi Berman notes that the ratio of the dimensions of the Mishkan are the same as the dimensions of the military tent of Ramesses II. They are both 1:2 for the \"holy\" outer chamber and 1:1 for the \"holy of holies\" inner chamber.</p>\n<p>There appears to be resemblance between the two. The website above suggests that the two winged figures in Ramesses's inner chamber are that of the god Horus (often depicted as a falcon with wings) and was a symbol of kingship. The two winged figures face towards the cartouche of Ramesses II, as his protector. This resembles the cherubim of the ark facing each other.</p>\n<p>This motif of the pharaoh being protected from both sides is not unique to this hieroglyphic relief, but was relatively common. For example see this rendering of Ramesses III flanked by the gods Horus and Seth:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iNJxJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/iNJxJ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>With regards to why the Torah would appropriate this motif (if this is what happened), there are plenty of examples of similarities in practice between Jewish and ancient cultures, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37401/2670\">here</a> for example.</p>\n<p>I would like to note that this particular connection between the mishkan and the encampment of Ramesses II is a very recent one, I think Rabbi Berman says it was from research in the 1930's, as the discovery and scholarship of Egyptian literature advanced. However, a similar line of thought regarding appropriation of extent religious practices can be found in the Rambam. For example see the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.32.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim Part 3, 32</a> where the Rambam writes about why sacrifices were incorporated into the Torah despite it merely being a ritual practice of various religions of the time. Here the Rambam is telling us why it would seem, at face value, strange to incorporate a ritual practice of another civilization, but shows that there is good reason in doing so.</p>\n<p>I would really recommend reading the whole passage from this Rambam to get the idea of what he is saying and suggesting. Basically, in order to bring a people towards Godly service of Hashem we cannot, with a single miracle, get them to change; it is a process that must be mediated and has a historical context. The incorporation of sacrifices was a necessary incorporation into the Torah to redirect the people away from idolatry.</p>\n<p>The Rambam continues to explain how sacrifices are not the primary objective and yet they are incorporated into the Torah (ibid.):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As the sacrificial service is not the primary object [of the commandments about sacrifice], whilst supplications, prayers, and similar kinds of worship are nearer to the primary object, and indispensable for obtaining it, a great difference was made in the Law between these two kinds of service.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I mentioned, this last part about sacrifices does not answer the question of why the Mishkan bears resemblance to the military encampment of Ramesses II or whether it was appropriated. This just goes to show that, according to the Rambam, at least sacrifices were appropriated into the Torah for a higher purpose of leading the people away from idolatry. By extension, it could be that other aspects of the Torah were incorporate from other religions and/or civilisations of the time as part of the broader purpose of turning the people away from idolatry using familiar practices of the time. Since the Rambam didn't know about the Egyptain inscriptions we cannot know how he would react to it. However, this gives us a glimpse into his approach regarding appropriation of extent practices.</p>\n\n\n",

It was his discoveries that motivated all the Torah Code stuff, but he made no claims about finding meaning from these patterns; at least not beyond finding them an indication of Divine Authorship.</p>\n<p>Anyway, start with the \"ת\" at the end of the word \"בראשית\", so the first letter of the pattern is the 6th letter of the Torah.

Similarly in Shemos, start with the first \"ת\", ie one in the title word, count ahead 49, etc... (That's intervals of 49, ie the 50th letter.)

I am thinking of--possibly--running to maariv, or, for a woman, running to any positive mitzvah that is not required of her and for which she does not have a chazaka, such as davening in shul per se, or the second kiddush. </p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43568/can-you-run-on-shabbos\">Can You Run On Shabbos?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ykr.org.il/modules/Ask/answer/4632\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Aharon Mazuz from Yeshivat Kisei Rachamim</a> was asked the following question:\nIs the permission to run on Shabbos for a mitzvah relevant if there is a reason for it like trying to be one of the first ten in synagogue or is it alright to run for a mitzvah on Shabbos in all cases. </p>\n\n<p>The Rav answers:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הרב המשיב: הרב אהרן מאזוז שליט\"א.\n  1. עצם מה שאדם רץ לדבר מצוה יש בו מצוה ולכך רשאי לרוץ לדבר מצוה אף בשבת בכל אופן. וכמו שאמרו בגמרא ברכות (דף ו' עמוד ב') לעולם ירוץ אדם\n  לדבר מצוה (כן גרסת הרי\"ף) ואפילו בשבת שנאמר אחרי ה' ילכו כארי ישאג וגו</p>\n  \n  <p>The very fact that a person runs for a mitzvah is in itself a mitzvah\n  and therefore it is allowed to run for a mitzvah on Shabbos in every\n  case as it says in the Gemara Berakhot 6b, “One should always run for\n  a mitzvah (that's the text of the Rif) and even on Shabbos as the\n  verse Hoshea 11 (10) says “They shall go (run?) after the Lord: He\n  shall roar like a lion.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems that it is a mitzvah to run on Shabbos after any mitzvah. </p>\n\n\n",

However, R' Belsky, as quoted in <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Medications#Taking_Pills_on_a_Fast_Day\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a>, forbids such a practice. However, all opinions, as also brought down in the latter article, agree that one should avoid it on Tisha B'Av, if possible, and that its 100% forbidden on Yom Kippur. (This is assuming you don't have doctor's orders. Even R' Belsky agrees you should take the pills with water on Yom Kippur if a doctor tells you to do so - same article.) </p>\n\n<p>What about one who needs to take a pill, but such a pill requires him or her to take it on a full stomach? Is one allowed to have something to eat in order to take the pill? Does it make a difference if he's a choleh sheyeish bo sakanah or not? In any of the above scenarios, including where you're just drinking water, is one considered to have \"broken his/her fast\" after having more than a reviis of liquid or a kekoseves of food, such that there is no longer a prohibition to eat? (I don't have a source for that last claim, but I'm pretty sure I learned somewhere that on any fast day besides Yom Kippur one can only be oveir eating/drinking once. Please correct me if I'm wrong.)</p>\n\n\n",

I come from a Jewish family (my mother's side) but I was raised in a secular household after my mother married out of the religion. She was raised in a Jewish household and we are still connected to her whole side of the family. We just never were brought up within the religion nor did I receive a traditional Yeshiva education.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Please excuse me if anything I say or write sounds confusing or strange or even unintentionally disrespectful to tradition.</strong> <strong>I don't mean to be and I apologize in advance.

Because of this I have been struggling to find a functional solution to my Kippah problem. If I don't move or bend or walk too quickly, I can easily place a Kippah on my head without a problem. </p>\n\n<p>The issue I have arises from daily use. Wearing a Kippah in Shul isn't a problem. Wearing a Kippah in life has become a challenge I am actively seeking a solution for. The wind, running to quickly, bending down, etc. etc. etc.</p>\n\n<p>I can't find a Kippah which I can keep to my head. The obvious solution to this problem would be \"Just clip it\" but the issue I have with that is my hair is too short. I buzz my head so I can't actually clip a Kippah to my head with a bobby pin. </p>\n\n<p>I have a hat which I have been using as a Kippah while I attempt to find something that fits my head. <a href=\"http://g.nordstromimage.com/ImageGallery/store/product/Large/10/_12251670.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">It's a driver's cap which I wear everywhere.</a> It obviously doesn't follow the \"big black hat\" style which many Jews are accustomed to but it works for me for now and it doesn't stand out as rude or overly immodest during certain events.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cut to last week:</strong></p>\n\n<p>I have a Muslim friend who knows I've been having this issue. He suggested that I wear something called a Kufi which is a traditional Islamic cap but that covers the head and holds to you like a cotton winter cap. <a href=\"http://store.muslimamerican.com/v/vspfiles/photos/KH140-2.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">It looks like this.</a></p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind this isn't a Muslim friend's attempt to try and lure me into the religion. Me and him have known each other for many years and he knows and respects my move into Judaism. I'm hyper-aware of people attempting to convert me after a previous issue with some former Christian friends. He's just trying to help me find a solution to my issue.</p>\n\n<p>So my question basically comes down to this.</p>\n\n<p>Could an Islamic Kufi hat function as a Kippah?

While it might be considered improper to wear a baseball hat in synagogue (though I have seen it) the religious obligation to cover the head would be fulfilled.

These texts all refer to one theme and warn against imitating them. The  Israelite shall, on the contrary, be distinguished from them and be recognizable by the way he dresses and in his other activities, just as he is distinguished  from them by his knowledge and his principles. And this it is said, “and I have set you apart from the peoples” (Lev. 20:26). <strong>He shall not put on a garment like that specially worn by them</strong> nor let the lock of his hair grow in the way they do.\n(Rambam, Avoda Zara 11:1).</p>\n\n<p>There is a prohibition against wearing a garment that is considered specific religious dress of another religion.

    "content": "# Restaurant serving meat during the 9 Days\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Can a kosher restaurant serve meat during the 9 days?</p>\n\n<p>Asked another way, can I go to a \"kosher\" restaurant that does serve meat during the 9 days, and simply not eat meat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Kosher meat restaurants work out the Nine Days in various ways. First and foremost, ask the restaurant, the <em>mashgiach</em>, and the kosher-certifying agency how they're handling this. (If their attitude is entirely lackadaisical, I'd think twice about their general kashrut.)</p>\n\n<p>There are restaurants that have a large Sephardic clientèle, for whom the \"Nine Days\" restrictions are limited to \"the week preceding Tisha B'Av\"; furthermore, according to many Sephardic opinions, when Tisha B'Av is observed on a Sunday there is no \"week preceding Tisha B'Av.\"</p>\n\n<p>There are restaurants that offer big discounts if you will come in and have a <em>siyum</em> party there, celebrating the completion of significant Jewish learning, in which case the celebrants can have meat. </p>\n\n<p>I've heard that some restaurants would basically hire someone to come in on a regular basis and make a <em>siyum</em>, and suddenly everyone in the restaurant is a \"celebrant\"; that's maybe a drop iffier.</p>\n\n<p>Anyhow -- it's a custom to not eat meat during the Nine Days. It doesn't render your pots non-kosher! So assuming your kosher restaurant is paying proper attention to halachic detail, you should be able to eat non-meat items there. (Now please ask carefully when ordering, e.g. are the egg rolls or French fries fried in \"meaty\" oil.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a kosher restaurant near me that serves meat during part of the 9 days. They advertise that a few rabbanim from the neighborhood come in and make a siyum for customers. I believe that they take reservations for specific time slots so that they don't overcrowd the place.</p>\n\n<p>AFAIK, this would work. However, some rabbanim have told me that they do not recommend the concept of making a siyum during the 9 days solely for the purpose of eating meat. I.e., it's fine if someone was learning and planning a siyum anyway and it occurs during the 9 days, but not to say, \"I want to eat meat. Therefore, I'll learn a masechta so that I can make a siyum.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources that teach that animal sacrifices will not be required in the times of Moshiach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember being told that there are opinions that in the times of Moshiach, animal sacrifices will no longer be required. Where are the sources for this opinion? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It's based on a reading of the Rambam. In Moreh Nevuchim the Rambam devotes a large section of his sefer to make all mitzvos intelligible. He ascribes to the mitzvos associated with korbanos the need to give Jews a form of service that is akin to what they were used to in the world. Sort of like weaning them off from Avoda Zara. That being the case, korbanos would be unnecessary in the days of Moshiach (במהרה בימינו).</p>\n\n<p>However, as many have pointed out, this cannot be said in the Rambam. The Rambam himself writes in Mishneh Torah that all Korbanos are chukim, and are beyond our understanding. He has great sections devoted to halachos of korbanos which will be relevant in the third and final Beis HaMikdash. Indeed, the Rambam davened (basically) the same tefillos we daven, and always expressed as we do the desire for the Beis HaMikdash and the opportunity to bring korbanos again.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there are many p'sukim in Nach that explicitly tell us that there will be korbanos in the times of Moshiach. Examples: Yeshaya 56:7, Yirmiya 33:17-18, Zecharya 14:21, Yechezkel 43:22-25.</p>\n\n\n",

When you look\n  further into the matter, you will see that true perfection lies only\n  in clinging to G-d. This is what King David said \"But as for me,\n  closeness to G-d is my good\" (Ps.73:28).. For only this is the good,\n  while anything besides this that people consider good is really\n  emptiness and mistaken worthlessness</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yosef Spinner in his commentary there says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"true perfection (shelemus) is only clinging (deveikus) to G-d..\" - it\n  should be noted that the author started with perfection (shelemus) and\n  continued with \"clinging\" (devekus). According to his words in various\n  places, the explanation is that perfection (shelemus), clinging\n  (deveikus), and the \"true good\" - all are basically the same matter.\n  Namely, G-d is the \"true good\", which is the matter of His perfection.\n  He wants to bestow this good and perfection to His creations (human\n  beings). However to receive this good and perfection is only possible\n  in a situation of \"clinging\".

But even if the structure is apparent and the content is hard to understand.</p>\n\n<p>Lets try to discover the reasoning the MY.\nThe first assertion is that Man is created to have pleasure with Hashem.\nThe second assertion is that this will append in Olam Haba.</p>\n\n<p>The proof is found by the author in a mishna in Avot (4, 16).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>רַבִּי יַעֲקֹב אוֹמֵר, הָעוֹלָם הַזֶּה דּוֹמֶה לִפְרוֹזְדוֹר בִּפְנֵי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא. הַתְקֵן עַצְמְךָ בַפְּרוֹזְדוֹר, כְּדֵי שֶׁתִּכָּנֵס לַטְּרַקְלִין: ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We need a large explanation: We have a gangway and a palace.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the text:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה מה שהורונו חכמינו זכרונם לברכה הוא, שהאדם לא נברא אלא להתענג על ה' ולהנות מזיו שכינתו שזהו התענוג האמיתי והעידון הגדול מכל העידונים שיכולים להמצא. ומקום העידון הזה באמת הוא העולם הבא, כי הוא הנברא בהכנה המצטרכת לדבר הזה. אך הדרך כדי להגיע אל מחוז חפצנו זה, הוא זה העולם. והוא מה שאמרו זכרונם לברכה (אבות ד): <strong>העולם הזה דומה לפרוזדור בפני העולם הבא</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The palace is the destination. Palace raise the idea of comfort and feeling of well being.</p>\n\n<p>The gangway is a means, without gratifying aspect.</p>\n\n<p>This is the proof of mesilat yesharim. The image of a gangway and a palace are image of means and destination. The destination is the purpose for which man is in live (is going in the gangway), the purpose is described as a placo of pleasure. So the purpose is pleasure. Where is it in Olam Haba. So what is the pleasure, the MY continues \"שבתי בבית ה\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>1) In Derech HaShem, Ramchal founds this basic idea on the pasuk in Tehillim - \"Tov HaShem laKol\" - \"G-d is good to all\". He writes that the consequent of being good - is to do good. And thus HaShem created the world, to this end. That is a source in Tanach.</p>\n\n<p>2) Chazal instituted Birkas HaIlanos with the expression that HaShem created beautiful creations \"to give pleasure to people\". So the concept is echoed in Chazal, albeit slightly qualified.</p>\n\n<p>3) As a general rule to the principles of the Ramchal, R' Chaim Friedlander writes in his introduction to Daas T'vunos (I believe it was that sefer) that the principles of the Ramchal were learned bimsora - tradition passed through generations. This would include all applications and qualifications of Tanach and Chazal.</p>\n\n<p>4) I may point out that this is easily derived from Chazal, in chain logic: {Step 1} Chazal teach us that the world was created for the purpose of Torah (Rashi B'reishis 1,1 s.v. from Midrash Rabba 1,1; also Rashi B'reishis 1, 31 from Tanchuma 1) and in fact it's Torah adherence that affords the world its sustainability (P'sachim 68b based on Yirmiya 33,25). {Step 2} The purpose of the Torah's mitzvos is to afford us merit (Final Mishna in Makkos). {Step 3} If the world was created for the Torah, and the Torah is there to benfit us, it logically is deduced that the purpose of creation was to benefit us. {Step 4} The greatest benefit, which Torah affords, is d'veikus to HaShem. (This, the Ramchal brings sources for himself.)</p>\n\n\n",

(Death was the punishment given for the sin - B'reishis 3:19, Shabbos 55, Ramban 2:17). What about other death? Examples would include murder (let's assume unintentional) by metal, fire, ice, or falling from great heights, or drowning. I would surmise that a person would have been able to die in such forms. But does anyone have any source for this? (Either to support or reject.) All sources I'm aware of speak of \"misa\" - \"death\" in general. I don't know if they'd include a broader definition of these forms of death.  </p>\n\n<p>(Let me just preempt - if you're thinking of B'rachos 33a with R' Chanina ben Dosa, I don't think it's really a raya - see Rashi, really based on Yerushalmi.)</p>\n\n\n",

But when they came to Harran, they settled there.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>There is a Midrash (Megillah 14a) that Sarah was really the same as Yiskah (from Gen 11:28), which would make her Avraham's niece, which is pretty close to a sister.</p>\n\n<p>However, Ibn Ezra (Gen 20:12) writes that Avraham was just saying something to appease Avimelekh, and we shouldn't assume it is true. Indeed he addresses your question earlier (Gen 11:28) when he writes that were Sarah the same as Yiskah, your verse should have specified \"his granddaughter\" as it did with Yiskah's sibling Lot (and <em>mutatis mutandis</em> were Sarah actually Avaraham's half-sister).</p>\n\n<p>This actually has a Halakhic application, as the Talmud (Sanhedrin 58b) in discussing whether or not the Noahide rules of incest apply to a maternal half-sibling cites Gen 20:12 to show that Avraham was being careful to avoid concerns of incest. This would only make sense if Sarah was not the same as Yiskah (as there is no prohibition of incest with a niece, even for Jews). While the Talmud rejects the proof due to the aforementioned Midrash, the Rambam (Melakhim 9:5) rules in accordance with the proof, citing the verse explicitly in his code. Rav Yosef Karo in his commentary there says this is due to its being פשטיה דקרא the simple reading of the verse, while the Midrashic answer is שינויא דחיקא a forced change.</p>\n\n<p>In short: there is a Midrash that they were indeed related somehow, but we are left with your question among others, and the simple reading is that Avraham was just trying to placate Avimelekh and wasn't related to Sarah at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.20.12?with=Rashi&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 20:12</a> points out that she was actually Haran's daughter and thereby the granddaughter of Terach. To explain the fact that she is called Abraham's half-sister, he employs the Talmudic principle of בני בנים הרי הם כבנים, that grandchildren are considered as children.\nTherefore, Sarah was truly Avraham's sister in the sense that she was his half-sister (although in reality his niece), yet she is also referred to later as Terach's daughter-in-law since that is indeed what she was to him in relation to Avraham.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Sara was the daughter of Haran (Avraham's brother), the sister of Lot and was also called Yiskah. In order to keep the women in the family, Avram and Nachor married the two daughters of their brother Haran.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175#showrashi=true&v=29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis 11:29</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>29 And Abram and Nahor took themselves wives; the name of Abram's wife\n  was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah, the daughter of\n  Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Iscah: This is Sarah [called Iscah] because she would see (סוֹכָה)\n  through Divine inspiration, and because all gazed (סוֹכִין) at her\n  beauty. Alternatively, יִסְכָּה is an expression denoting princedom,\n  (נְסִיכוּת), just as Sarah is an expression of dominion (שְׂרָרָה) . -\n  [from Meg. 14a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is why Rashi in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8215#v=12&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">20:12</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>my sister, the daughter of my father</strong>: And the daughter of one’s father\n  is permitted to a Noahide [for marriage], for a gentile has no father\n  (i.e., his lineage is not traced from his father). And in order to\n  justify his words, he answered him in this way. Now if you ask: Was\n  she not the daughter of his brother? [The answer is that]\n  grandchildren are considered like children (Tosefta, Yev. 8:8; Talmud\n  Bavli, Yev. 62b); therefore, she was (considered as) Terah’s daughter.\n  And so did he say to Lot, “For we are kinsmen” (אֲנָשִׁים אַחִים)\n  [lit. men, brothers] (although, in fact, Lot was his brother Haran’s\n  son). - [from Pirkei d’Rabbi Eliezer, ch. 36]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>but not the daughter of my mother</strong>: Haran was [born] of a different\n  mother [than Abraham]. —</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The concern about donning (any) tephillin while reciting Shema' Yisra'el is that in doing so one appears to be a false witness. But, that's only true when one is required to recite Shema'. In the case of Rabbe'inu Tam tephillin being donned <em>after</em> one already recited Shema' Yisra'el (and the 'Amidah) while donning RaSh\"I tephillin, why one must one recite <em>anything</em>?</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, my understanding of the Mishnah Berurah in Siman 25 is \"<em>if Shema' then tephillin</em>\" whereas in Siman 34 <strong>it appears that the logic is reversed</strong> (i.e. \"<em>if tephillin then Shema'</em>\"). Can someone please help me explain what appears IMHO to be reverse logic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The logic is that if one said Shema with Rashi's, but Rabbeinu Tam's is the correct Tefillin, then one didn't say Shema with Tefillin earlier, so say it now, properly. So the logic is that the proper way to say Shema is with Tefillin on, so if you failed to do it before, do it now. That is what the Mishna Brura is saying that he \"fixed\" his failure to say Shema with Tefillin by saying the first two paragraphs.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01355_part_3.html#HtmpReportNum0010_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Yalkut Yosef</a> (25:40) says in part:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואין בזה משום כל הקורא קריאת שמע בלי תפילין כאילו מעיד עדות שקר בעצמו, אחר שבדעתו להניח תפילין אחר כך. ובלבד שיהיה בדעתו לקרוא שוב לאחר זמן קריאת שמע עם התפילין</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>וגם מניח תפילין אחר כך בו ביום, אין בזה משום מעיד עדות שקר בעצמו. מאחר שבדעתו לומר קריאת שמע אחר כך עם תפילין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context there is someone who is late and doesn't have time to put on Tefillin before the end of the time to say Shema. He says by saying Shema before the end of the time without Tefillin and having in mind to <strong>re-say Shema</strong> afterwards with Tefillin avoids the \"false testimony\" issue.</p>\n<p>It is quite possible that this the mechanics that the Mishna Brura (et. al.) have in mind here.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "\"Anyone who saves a life is as if he saved an entire world\": Jewish life or any life?",
    "content": "# \"Anyone who saves a life is as if he saved an entire world\": Jewish life or any life?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am puzzled by the Mishnah's original text of the famous Jewish idea that \"whoever saves one life [...] saves an entire world\" (Sanhedrin 4:5). The English from sefaria.org reads thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"It was for this reason that man was first created as one person\n  [Adam], to teach you that <strong>anyone who destroys a life is considered by\n  Scripture to have destroyed an entire world; and anyone who saves a\n  life is as if he saved an entire world.\"</strong> And also, to promote peace\n  among the creations, that no man would say to his friend, \"My\n  ancestors are greater than yours.\" And also, so that heretics will not\n  say, \"there are many rulers up in Heaven.\" And also, to express the\n  grandeur of The Holy One [blessed be He]: For a man strikes many coins\n  from the same die, and all the coins are alike. But the King, the King\n  of Kings, The Holy One [blessed be He] strikes every man from the die\n  of the First Man, and yet no man is quite like his friend. Therefore,\n  every person must say, “For my sake ‎the world was created.”‎</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...But the Hebrew reads thus: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפיכך נברא אדם יחידי ללמדך. <strong>שכל המאבד נפש אחת מישראל. מעלה עליו הכתוב\n  כאילו איבד עולם מלא. וכל המקיים נפש אחת מישראל מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו\n  קיים עולם מלא.</strong> ומפני שלום הבריות. שלא יאמר אדם לחבירו אבא גדול מאביך.\n  ושלא יהו מינין אומרים הרבה רשויות בשמים. ולהגיד גדולתו של הקדוש ברוך\n  הוא. שאדם טובע כמה מטבעות בחותם אחד וכולן דומין זה לזה. ומלך מלכי\n  המלכים הקדוש ברוך הוא טבע כל אדם בחותמו של אדם הראשון ואין אחד מהן\n  דומה לחבירו. לפיכך כל אחד ואחד חייב לומר בשבילי נברא העולם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Please excuse me if there is some flaw in my understanding of the Hebrew, but it seems to me that the English omits a stipulation within the famous sentences that the life saved be <em>Jewish</em> (\"מישראל\"). Moreover, whenever I have seen this idea quoted or referenced in a non-textual source--including in shiurim given by rabbis--the \"Jewish\" stipulation is omitted in translation. (I even specifically asked a fifth-year yeshiva student whether this discussion referred to Jewish life or to all humanity, and he said all humanity.) </p>\n\n<p>I looked a bit further and found that some Hebrew-edition Mishnaios(?) put the word \"מישראל\" in brackets, but all seem to contain it. So: </p>\n\n<p>1) Why do the English translations leave this word out? Is it just for darchei sholom/political correctness? That seems strange (unto dishonest...)</p>\n\n<p>2) Why is the word bracketed in some texts? Is there any doubt about its accuracy?</p>\n\n<p>3)  Why would the original text stipulate \"מישראל\" in the first place, considering the context? (Adam is, after all, an ancestor of \"every man,\" as clearly acknowledged by the mishnah. How would the argument make any sense if it were limited to Jews?) [I am no longer sure about this, since having learned that a mention of \"adam\" in Torah usually indicates Jewry. But then someone told me that this only applies to Tanakh, or maybe Chumash.]</p>\n\n<p>My best guess is that all three of these are cleared up in the commentary, but unfortunately it's way beyond me to read that...Could someone please help?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 24)\n\n<p>In the manuscript <a href=\"http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/talmud/mishna/showmi.asp?mnusriptnum=0240_191&library=12_4&mishnanum=5&pereknum=004&masecet=34&p=2&libindex=5&manuscriptindex=2&masecetindex=34&perekindex=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parma 3173</a> there is no \"מישראל\";</p>\n<p>In the manuscript <a href=\"http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/talmud/mishna/showmi1.asp?mishnanum=5&pereknum=004&masecet=34&mnusriptnum=1723&p=1&masecetindex=34&perekindex=4&numamud=5&manuscriptindex=1&k=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Budapest Kaufman A50</a> no more.</p>\n<p>The Mishna of Mechon Mamre, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h44.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Sanhedrin 4:5</a>  based on Rambam manuscript idem;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפיכך נברא אדם יחידי בעולם, ללמד שכל המאבד נפש אחת, מעלים עליו כאילו איבד עולם מלא; וכל המקיים נפש אחת, מעלים עליו כאילו קיים עולם מלא. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37945&st=&pgnum=411\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shinuye Nussachaot Shas Mishnayot Vilna</a>, the divergence between versions is signaled.</p>\n<p>So the translation in English is <strong>not so strange</strong>, and may be based on one of the above-cited manuscripts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Bavli [Sanhedrin 37a] does say \"a Jewish life\":\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MydU0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MydU0.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a>\nBut the Yerushalmi [Sanhedrin 4:1 (22a)] does not:\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uh9Ke.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uh9Ke.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>When the two Talmuds disagree, the Bavli wins.

I hadn't looked too far into the sugya until I saw this question (thanks for that), and I noticed the Tosfos Yom Tov on the later quote of the Mishnah, bishvili nivra ha'olam - everyone must keep in mind that it was for his sake the world was created. Why? Says the Tosfos Yom Tov that if it was created for his sake, he won't remove himself from the world because of one petty little sin - again referencing the fact that non-Jews aren't bound by Torah law. </p>\n\n\n",

I will try to explain the question and to give an partial answer based on Rambam, for clarity and brevity.</p>\n<p><strong>The wine of a non-Jew who is not idolater:</strong> See Rambam Kedusha, Maachalot Asurot, 11, 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן כָּל גּוֹי שְׁאֵינוּ עוֹבֵד עֲבוֹדָה זָרָה, כְּגוֹן אֵלּוּ הַיִּשְׁמְעֵאלִיִּים--יֵינָן אָסוּר בִּשְׁתִיָּה, וּמֻתָּר בַּהֲנָיָה; ‏\nThe <strong>consummation</strong>, but not the <strong>benefice</strong> from this  wine is prohibited, not as Stam Yeynam from idolaters who is prohibited even from benefice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kessef Mishne cited a <strong>Responsa of Rashba</strong> explaining the Psak of Rambam concerning wine of non idolators non-Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב הרשב\"א דטעמא משום <strong>דגזירה ראשונה לאסור שתיה בלבד היתה ומשום בנותיהן</strong> אבל <strong>איסור הנאה שגזרו ב\"ד שלאחריהם ומשום חשש ניסוך</strong> לא גזרו אלא בעכו\"ם עובד ע\"ז אבל בשאינו עובד לע\"ז לא היתה גזירה ..... וכדגרסינן התם עלה דההיא רב יהודה שדר קרבנא לאבידרנא ביום אידם אמר <strong>ידענא ביה דלא פלח לע\"ז</strong> ... אלמא כל שידענוהו שאינו עובד עכו\"ם אינו בכלל גזירות הללו ... <strong>ומ\"מ כל שאסרו משום חתנות אף הוא אסור בו שהרי הוא בכלל איסור חתנות</strong> ולפיכך יינו אסור בשתייה כשמנו עכ\"ל: ‏</p>\n<p>He says basically that there are <strong>two commitments</strong>. <strong>The first</strong> concerning wine and some other foods, in way to avoid intermarriage, it is a eating prohibition only, <strong>the second</strong> when it can be a doubt if the wine has something to do with idolatry, it is a benefit prohibition.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to continue to reasoning with your question, we are now going to cast aside the second commitment.\nYou ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>they don't have any direct relation to the customers, so there is no reason a jew will get married with them.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sharp question is relating with the fact that it seems that Chachamim apply <strong>different rules concerning the non-Jew bread prohibition</strong>; you assume also that the commitment should be equivalent for bread and wine, concerning the intermarriage-linked commitment. See Rambam, Kedusha, Maachalot Asurot, 17, 12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאָסְרוּ פַּת גּוֹיִים, יֵשׁ מְקוֹמוֹת <strong>שֶׁמְּקִילִין בַּדָּבָר וְלוֹקְחִין פַּת מִן הַנַּחְתּוֹם הַגּוֹי,</strong> בִּמְקוֹם שְׁאֵין שָׁם נַחְתּוֹם יִשְׂרָאֵל; וּבַשָּׂדֶה, מִפְּנֵי שְׁהִיא שָׁעַת הַדֹּחַק.  אֲבָל פַּת בַּעֲלֵי בָּתִּים, אֵין שָׁם מִי שֶׁמּוֹרֶה בָּהּ לְהָקֶל:  שֶׁעִיקַר הַגְּזֵרָה מִשּׁוֹם חַתְנוּת; וְאִם יֹאכַל פַּת בַּעֲלֵי בָּתִּים, יָבוֹא לִסְעֹד אֶצְלָן. ‏</p>\n<p>He explain that despite the prohibition to eat non-Jew bread, in some countries, they permit to eat <strong>bread from the baker</strong> if there is no Jew-bakery. The reason is that it is very difficult to deal without bakery. But despite this leniency, the home-mad bread remains prohibited because of the basis of the commitment, which is to avoid intermarriage. If we eat their <strong>home-made bread</strong>, we would eating at the non-Jewish home, a thing that lead to intermarriage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This leniency is reported for bread and not for wine. Even for bread, it is not an absolute leniency.</p>\n<p>Concerning the commitment, it begin with wine. See Gemara Shabbat 17b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather [say] they decreed against their bread and oil on account of their wine, and against their wine on account of their daughters, and against their daughters on account of 'the unmentionable,' and [they decreed] something else on account of some other thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For wine, Rashi says in AZ 36b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משום יינן. שהיין בוער בו ומביאו לידי בנותיהן: ‏\nbecause the <strong>wine is boiling in him</strong> and leads him to their daughter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For this reason, some Rishonim (e.g. Tosfot Shabbat 17b think against Rambam, that the wine prohibition is already a benefit prohibition, no matter with idolatry).</p>\n<p>So, wine is different from bread from <strong>his need which is lower</strong> and his__ danger which is bigger__. Despite that the risk is not directly to marry with the daughter of the worker of the winery, a general risk of intermarriage persists.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Caged hens, and other seemingly cruel farming methods\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My local kosher store sells eggs from caged hens which probably means that there no halachic prohibition of eating these eggs.</p>\n\n<p>As it seems cruel to keep hens in such a manner:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is it forbidden to actually farm eggs this way? (Is keeping chickens in cramped conditions \"cruel\" therefore forbidden. Or are the only prohibitions the ones mentioned in Torah / Shas) -</li>\n<li>If so, is it forbidden to non-Jews too. (Again, does their prohibition of Eiver Min Ha-Chai extend to cover all cruelty to animals, and thus this).</li>\n<li>Should it be at least discouraged, if not forbidden, to make use of these products? (If it is forbidden to farm them, then buying them would potentially be Lifnei Iver, putting a stumbling block, as you are creating business for the person doing it).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The basic answer is that Rav Moshe Feinstein (among others) forbade treating animals in this way. However, if someone violates the isur of <em>tzaar baalei chaim</em>, the animal itself does not \"become nonkosher\" or asur in any way. As a practical matter, certain animals (such as veal) do tend to be <em>treifah</em> because of the physical results of their mistreatment. However, that would not apply to eggs.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the anwer to your two (different) questions would seem to be</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>It would be asur to treat the hens in a way that is defined as <em>tzaar baailei chaim</em> if eggs can be produced without such a method.</p></li>\n<li><p>It would be a practical matter to discourage using such eggs in order to encourage proper behavior. However, (as with veal) the Rabbis did not issue an explicit takana against using such eggs.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=278\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Jonathan Blass</a> was asked this question in general and answered</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>22 Tevet 5763 Kosher Meat and Tzaar Baalei Chayim</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Jonathan Blass</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>If in the process of Shechita there is a violation of tzaar baalei\n  chayim, is it correct that the meat is treif?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Causing animals needless suffering is a serious offence (there is a\n  difference of opinion as to whether it is forbidden by the Torah or by\n  rabbinical edict). An animal that has suffered needlessly is not,\n  however, rendered non-kosher unless one of its organs was damaged in a\n  manner that would make it a treifa. Any suffering that is a necessary\n  part of the shechita is not “needless” and would not be included in\n  the prohibition against tzaar baalei chayim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are a number of sites that deal with the general halachos of this, but the above answer is the basic one that applies to your question. An example is given of veal in which the animal is raised under cruel conditions that lead to anemia. However, on a practical level, the cruelty will often lead to the animal used for veal (because it is so penned up and raised anemic) actually being a treifah because of lung lesions and other physical problems. Note that this applies to veal rather than chickens.</p>\n\n<p>[Ask the Rabbi] (<a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Eating_Veal.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aish.com/atr/Eating_Veal.html</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The Aish Rabbi Replies</strong>:</p>\n  \n  <p>There are different mitzvahs in the Torah which address different\n  issues. \"Kosher\" has to do with the species of animal, the way it is\n  slaughtered, and removal of the blood from the meat.</p>\n  \n  <p>“Kosher\" does not address the issue of conditions in which the animal\n  is raised.</p>\n  \n  <p>There is another mitzvah, however, which addresses your concern. \"Tzar\n  Baalei Chaim\" is the Torah prohibition against causing pain to\n  animals. And based on this, the great Rabbi Moshe Feinstein indeed\n  forbade raising animals in cramped and painful conditions.</p>\n  \n  <p>One final note: Interestingly, animals which are raised in cramped\n  conditions and fed chemicals are frequently found to be NOT Kosher,\n  due to various problems and disease found in the organs of these\n  animals.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems that if <strong>the only profitable way of raising the animals/chickens is by making smaller enclosures for them</strong>, while we should encourage the animal owners to try and treat the animals the best they can, they are not transgressing Tzaar Baalei Chaim as <strong>the animals were meant to serve humans</strong> (i.e we don't want humans in poorer countries to lack poultry due to high costs) See Chevel Nachaloso 7,25 quoting Terumas Hadeshen (15th century Halachic compendium 2, 105:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תרומת הדשן (ח\"ב סי' קה): \"אם למרוט נוצות לאווזות חיים, אי דומה לגיזת כבשים או אי הוו צער בעלי חיים, גם <strong>לחתוך לשון העוף כדי שידבר, ואזנים וזנב מכלב כדי ליפותו. נראין הדברים דאין אסור משום צער בעלי חיים אם הוא עושה לצורכיו ולתשמישיו, דלא נבראו כל הבריות רק לשמש את האדם</strong>, כדאיתא פרק בתרא דקידושין (פב ע\"א). ותדע דבפ' ב' דב\"מ (לו ע\"א) חשיב פריקה צער בעלי חיים, וא\"כ היאך מותר משא כבד על בהמתו להוליכו ממקום למקום הא איכא צער בעלי חיים? וכ\"ת אין הכי נמי, הא אמרינן התם דרבנן דר\"י הגלילי סברו דאפילו תחת משאו שאין יכול לעמוד בו חייב לפרוק וכי ברשיעי עסקינן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was Moshe's status after Aharon became Kohein Gadol?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the commentary in my Stone Chumash (p. 474) on Sh'mot, 29, from the 23rd of Adar, when the Yemei Miluim began, Moshe performed the sacrificial service and \"had the status of a Kohen Gadol.\" On the first of Nissan, Aharon and his sons took over.</p>\n<p>What was Moshe's status after that? Was he reduced to being a regular Kohen, or a Levi, or something else like a <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/horayos/insites/ho-dt-009.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">She'ava</a>r?</p>\n<p>According to the talmudic discussion summarized <a href=\"http://www.torahinmotion.org/discussions-and-blogs/yoma-12-messianic-laws\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> (yes, when discussing a Kohein Gadol who was temporarily disqualified, different from the case in Sh'mot),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even though one may have only served as the kohen gadol for a day or two, he retains his exalted status as akohen gadol. While in terms of the Temple duties the original kohen gadol gets his job back, the backup kohen gadol would continue to wear the special garments worn by a high priest and be subject to the special laws pertaining to the kohen gadol, such as the prohibition to attend the funeral of a close relative or to marry a widow--once a kohen gadol, always a kohen gadol.</p>\n<p>Rav Yossi disagrees and rules that the backup kohen gadol is \"unfit both for the role of the kohen gadol and for that of a kohen hedeyot, a regular kohen\". The Gemara explains that to have two high priests share the responsibility would be a source of constant friction, and to have one who served as a high priest relegated to serving as a regular kohen would be demeaning--violating the principle of  \"we go up in holiness, and we do not go down\". It would be somewhat akin to the President of the United States becoming a congressman.</p>\n<p>The Gemara follows with the ruling of Rabba bar bar Channa in the name of Rav Yochanan that the halacha follows the view of Rav Yossi, i.e., that the second kohen gadol is forced to retire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Moshe had the status then what happened to him? Were there any practical implications to the resultant status?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can my bad (but not sinful) behavior create a chilul Hashem?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.5.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisodei Hatorah 5:10-11</a>) writes that there are two ways to commit a chilul Hashem: either to sin, or to behave in a (otherwise non-sinful) manner that people view negatively. However he limits the latter to \"a man who is a great Torah scholar and renowned for his piety\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְיֵשׁ דְּבָרִים אֲחֵרִים שֶׁהֵן בִּכְלַל חִלּוּל הַשֵּׁם. <strong>וְהוּא שֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה אוֹתָם אָדָם גָּדוֹל בַּתּוֹרָה וּמְפֻרְסָם בַּחֲסִידוּת</strong> דְּבָרִים שֶׁהַבְּרִיּוֹת מְרַנְּנִים אַחֲרָיו בִּשְׁבִילָם. וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁאֵינָן עֲבֵרוֹת הֲרֵי זֶה חִלֵּל אֶת הַשֵּׁם כְּגוֹן... אוֹ שֶׁדִּבּוּרוֹ עִם הַבְּרִיּוֹת אֵינוֹ בְּנַחַת וְאֵינוֹ מְקַבְּלָן בְּסֵבֶר פָּנִים יָפוֹת אֶלָּא בַּעַל קְטָטָה וְכַעַס. וְכַיּוֹצֵא בַּדְּבָרִים הָאֵלּוּ הַכּל לְפִי גָּדְלוֹ שֶׁל חָכָם צָרִיךְ שֶׁיְּדַקְדֵּק עַל עַצְמוֹ וְיַעֲשֶׂה לִפְנִים מִשּׁוּרַת הַדִּין</p>\n  \n  <p>There are other things included in desecrating God's name: when <strong>a man who is a great Torah scholar and renowned for his piety</strong> will do things that will cause the public to complain about him, even though they are not transgressions, nevertheless he has desecrated God's name, for example...if his speech with his fellow men isn't polite, or if he does not receive them pleasantly, but is instead a man of anger and strife. In such matters, commensurate to the greatness of the scholar, he must take particular care and act better than the law requires. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since most of us are not great scholars renowned for our piety (at least I speak for myself), it would seem that our bad (non-sinful) behavior cannot constitute a chilul Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone know of a <strong>halachic work</strong> that disagrees with the Rambam and justifies the widespread perception that a regular person's bad non-sinful behavior can indeed be a chilul Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Here is a Gemara.</p>\n<h3>Masechet Yoma 86a:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כדתניא (דברים ו, ה) ואהבת את ה' אלהיך שיהא שם שמים מתאהב על ידך שיהא קורא ושונה ומשמש ת\"ח ויהא משאו ומתנו בנחת עם הבריות מה הבריות אומרות עליו אשרי אביו שלמדו תורה אשרי רבו שלמדו תורה אוי להם לבריות שלא למדו תורה פלוני שלמדו תורה ראו כמה נאים דרכיו כמה מתוקנים מעשיו עליו הכתוב אומר (ישעיהו מט, ג) ויאמר לי עבדי אתה ישראל אשר בך אתפאר אבל מי שקורא ושונה ומשמש ת\"ח ואין משאו ומתנו באמונה ואין דבורו בנחת עם הבריות מה הבריות אומרות עליו אוי לו לפלוני שלמד תורה אוי לו לאביו שלמדו תורה אוי לו לרבו שלמדו תורה פלוני שלמד תורה ראו כמה מקולקלין מעשיו וכמה מכוערין דרכיו ועליו הכתוב אומר (יחזקאל לו, כ) באמור להם עם ה' אלה ומארצו יצאו ‏</p>\n<p>if someone <strong>studies Scripture and Mishnah, and attends on the disciples of the wise,</strong> is honest in business, and speaks pleasantly to persons, what do people then say concerning him? 'Happy the father who taught him Torah, happy the teacher who taught him Torah; woe unto people who have not studied the Torah; for this man has studied the Torah look how fine his ways are, how righteous his deeds!. Of him does Scripture say: And He said unto me: Thou art My servant, Israel, in, whom I will be glorified. But if someone studies Scripture and Mishnah, attends on the disciples of the wise, <strong>but is dishonest in business, and discourteous in his relations with people, what do people say about him?

This man studied the Torah: Look, how corrupt are his deeds, how ugly his ways; of him Scripture says: In that men said of them,: These are the people of the Lord, and are gone forth out of His land.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems very similar to Chilul Hashem. Some of the  bad behaviors cited  are not really pointing to sin, but to bad customs. The man pointed is a man that people see as a scholar. We can understand from the style of this text that nowadays, a Yeshiva Bochur or almost a man considered as a rabbi, or as an active member of a Beth Hamidrash falls in this category, for him people will say \"This man studied Torah, look how corrupt...\" This is exactly the words of Rambam. There is no \"objective\" threshold.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems that according to Rabbi Dessler, yes, every person causes 'chilul' based on his own level.</p>\n\n<p>Here's my translation from Michtov Me'Eliyahu 4 pg 88:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rishonim wrote that sin is a disease of the soul. 'Once someone sins and repeats, it becomes to him as if it is allowed', (Kidushin 40a).\n  That is, it is a permanent sickness, and that is certainly 'chilul'. As for desire, 'Once one is attached to it very much so, it is akin to heresy' and it is impossible to honestly detach from it unless one dies doing Teshuva, (Avoda Zara 17a).\n  That is, the sickness is so attached to him that he cannot detach from it, and the cure is so harsh that it kills him.\n  <strong>Every person must recognize the 'chilul' according to his level, as they said 'what is chilul Hashem...Rabi Yochanan...like myself if I walk four cubits without Torah and without Tephilin.</strong> \n  See there in the Gemara that this is a chilul Hashem that is only forgiven with death.\n  <strong>We must know that all sicknesses such as the light treatment of prayers, mussar, bittul torah and the like, that is chlilul.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The word shalom is translated with a broken Vav in Hertz.  Stone uses a full vav?  Can we know which is correct and if so, how?  I have wondered which Hebrew text is used (Leningrad, Vulgate, Aleppo)?   I am an amateur when it comes to understanding all the nuances/syntax of the language. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara (Kiddushin 66b) says that the vav is cut, and that is the way it is written in Ashkenazic Sifrei Torah (as opposed to Yemenite Sifrei Torah). That is probably why many Chumashim indicate it. Those Chumashim that omit it probably do so because it does not affect the literal meaning of the verse (and/or perhaps to be in accordance with the aforementioned mesorah that omits it). </p>\n\n<p>(By the way, it is not a language/syntax issue; this is a unique occurrence in the Torah - there is generally no phenomenon in Hebrew as a cut vav) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the footnotes of the <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblia_Hebraica_Stuttgartensia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia</a></em>, the shortened <em>vav</em> appears in various medieval manuscripts to include the second edition of the Bomberg Rabbinic Bible (1524), which was edited by Jacob b. Ḥayyim of Tunis. However, earlier witnesses do not attest to the shortened <em>vav</em>. For example, the Masoretic Text according to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leningrad_Codex\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Codex Leningrad</a> (c. 916) reflects no shortened <em>vav</em> as per the image below boxed in red.

The Chofetz Chaim also stresses the importance to rebuke those who stumble on this prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>However, see Bnei Banim chelek 1 siman 37(<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20021&st=&pgnum=119\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20021&st=&pgnum=119</a>) which discusses mixed dancing in a circle fashion which may be a different story. In fact Rav Henkin notes the Kol Bo(see number 9 of the tshuvah) who made a decree to forbid mixed dancing and Rav Henkin holds this decree still applies today. So even if you come out from the sugya that in some cases its technically permitted,still the ban of the Kol Bo is in effect.</p>\n\n<p>note: please look up the Geder Olam for (the exact sources,it would be too much to write all the sources now while I am typing on the phone.)</p>\n\n\n",

So by thinking of sin, even though measure of the sin is less (hence the lesser effects in your question) the place that it affects is much more sensitive to and impacted by the sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaiah_di_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yeshaya di Trani</a> explains in Tosafot Rid (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.29a.1?lang=bi&with=Tosafot%20Rid&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>) that קשו doesn't mean worse. Rather it means that thinking about sin causes more lust for the sin than committing the sin itself. As noted by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%95%D7%9D_%D7%90%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Nahum Ash</a> in his notes to Hilkhot Ishut (15:3), Rashi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.29a.1?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Yoma.29a.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a>) too doesn't understand that it means that thoughts of sin are worse. Rather he seems to say that the effect of thinking about sin on the body, is greater than the effect of committing the act.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rambam explains in Moreh HaNevokhim (III:8) that thoughts of sin are actually worse. That doesn't mean that it is halalkhically more severe, but that a sin committed with the intellect sullies the most lofty part of a person, while physical sins only sully the lesser baser part of a person.</p>\n\n<p>This explanation is adapted, albeit using more kabbalistic language, by Rabbenu Bahya in his commentary to Deut.

Betsalel Safran</a> (Shu\"t Rabaz Vol. II EH 26), however, suggests that it means that it is halakhically worse inasmuch as having sex with an unmarried woman may be only rabbinicaly forbidden, but fantasising about the act may be biblically forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

That is, it is not similar to someone who gets (lo aleinu) something like TB as a punishment for a sin who must be treated for the physical disease <strong>as well as</strong> doing teshuvah for the sin.</p>\n\n<p>Leprosy became interchangeable with the biblical leprosy due to two inaccurate translations: The Hebrew tzaraat was first translated into Greek as leprosy in the sixth century, and later, the word leprosy was translated into Arabic as lepra in the ninth century.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<p>The kohen was not called during the week after a wedding or during chol hamoed. The person who appears to have tzaraas is not isolated until after the kohen sees him. Even if the kohen must be told by an expert what to say  he is not tamei until <strong>after</strong> the kohen makes the declaration. This shows that we are not concerned with the physical symptoms and it is not a medical quarantine.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna in <a href=\"http://mishnahyomit.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/issues/Vol8Iss47.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moed Katan 1:5</a> discusses this.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R’  Meir holds  that inspections  were  carried  out  on Chol Hamoed\n  but  that  the Kohanim were limited  to rendering a positive judgement\n  or remaining silent. The Rabbanan hold that the Kohanim were not\n  permitted to examine the nega at all  until  after  the  festival was\n  over.  The Halacha follows the Rabbanan,   but   both   opinions seek \n  to   prevent   an individual from being banished from the community\n  during the festival.</p>\n  \n  <p>This  anomaly  can  be  explained  by  examining  the  true meaning<br>\n  of Tzaraat. Tzaraat is often   mistranslated   as leprosy  (a \n  contagious  bacterial  infection).  However  this translation  cannot \n  be  correct. Rather, Tzaraat is  a  spiritual disease.  A  person only\n  becomes Tameh with Tzaraat once the Kohen declares   them   to   be<br>\n  impure. They   are   not considered  ‘contagious’  unless  and  until \n  this  declaration  is made.   This   contrasts   with   the<br>\n  quarantine   placed   on someone with a physically contagious disease.</p>\n  \n  <p>Even  the greatest Talmid  Chacham is   not   qualified   to<br>\n  diagnose Tzaraat if   they   are   not   a Kohen. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1524516/jewish/Tumat-Tsaraat-Chapter-9.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Hilchos Tumat Tzoraas 9:2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The gemara in Masechet Moed Koton daf 7a - 7b discusses the matter and points out that besides not being declared tamei during Chol hamoed, there are those who allow him to be with his wife once he has been confirmed to be a metzora (though not while confined for seven days.</p>\n\n<p>Even if it were considered that Hashem is sending a physical disease as a punishment, we would have to treat the physical symptoms <strong>as well as</strong> the spiritual cause. this is not done, since if it were an infectious disease, the metzorah would have to be quarantined until the kohen declares that it is not <em>tzara'as</em> and it would be <strong>more dangerous</strong> to allow him to stay within the community during chol hamoed.</p>\n\n<p>In 5760, there was an <a href=\"http://ccs.infospace.com/ClickHandler.ashx?encp=ld%3d20160804%26app%3d1%26c%3dpchmeta4%26s%3dpchmeta4%26rc%3dpchmeta4%26dc%3d%26euip%3d71.179.216.48%26pvaid%3d2baa55baad654afdaadba296086b0024%26dt%3dDesktop%26fct.uid%3djp05i5bmm0%25253DA05E8B55-53E1-46FE-%26en%3dy2HsFdiwRo4XG8lJBjnZfEIb5hJQYreFhtNwVgkmv86Fivq2R5BG3f70oZbEEgfdEZn8H%252fCflYk%253d%26ru%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fwww.parsha.net%252fVayikra%252fMetzora60.doc%26ap%3d4%26coi%3d1494%26npp%3d4%26p%3d0%26pp%3d0%26mid%3d9%26ep%3d4%26du%3dwww.parsha.net%252fVayikra%252fMetzora60.doc%26pct%3dhttp%253a%252f%252fsct.pch.com%252fimages%252f__kl.gif%253fun%253dB02F3AC1-A606-4926-9349-6CAB7C6338A3%2526uid%253d6093b4b98935c828f40aa9612e3ef3ca%2526mobility%253ddesktop%2526searchID%253d6093b4b98935c828f40aa9612e3ef3ca1470323878471%26hash%3d13C3F9383A5044D83B4403B4AFF4EA25&cop=main-title\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> that discussed this> The <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962282700106\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> is too long to give the details but the summary shows why the author decided that it does not match a disease known today. The article was published in the Jounal of the <a href=\"http://www.jaad.org/article/S0190-9622(82)70010-6/abstract\" rel=\"nofollow\">American Academy of Dematology</a> in January 1982.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From: Torah and Science[SMTP:torahandscience@avoda.jct.ac.il]<br>\n  WHAT IS TZARAAT?<br>\n  ABRAHAM R. FREILICH, MD<br>\n  From the Division of Dermatology, Monteflore Hospital and Medical Center, Albert Einstein College of Medicine  </p>\n  \n  <p>Leprosy has long been thought to be the disease referred to in the\n  Torah as  tzaraat.*(1) Upon close examination of the text of the\n  Torah, however, it  becomes apparent that the description of tzaraat\n  differs from our present  understanding of Hansen's disease and may\n  not be similar to any well‑known  dermatological disease.(2)  Here we\n  discuss the clinical features and  differential diagnosis of tzaraat,\n  based on the text and multiple commentaries  of the Torah. It is\n  important to note that tzaraat is discussed in a chapter of \n  Leviticus dealing with ritual purity and impurity, a metaphysical\n  concept with  legal and practical ramifications.(3)  The strict\n  definitions of this state of  impurity, however, give insight into the\n  disease process.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed, it is only when Bnai Yisrael were at a sufficiently high level that tzara'as occurred. Note also that the plague on clothing and houses are considered part of the same \"disease\". The meforshim point out that one could be warned by his house and clothing to be able to repent before it affects him. This shows it is not a medical condition.</p>\n\n<p>Also note that a person is able to remove items from the house before the kohen makes the pronouncement and is not put in \"quarantine\" before the kohen announces that he is a metzorah. If it were being treated as a medical condition, then the objects in the house would be treated as if they were \"infected\".</p>\n\n<p>It is considered that tzaraas does not occur nowadays. If it were one of the medical conditions suggested by the term leprosy, then a person with that medical condition would be treated in the same way as the Torah prescribes for <em>tzoraas</em>. That is, the disease would not have diappeared when Bnai Yisrael went down in the spiritual level. </p>\n\n<p>As Rabbi Berel Wein says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He implies that only where holiness exists – through the study and\n  knowledge of Torah – can the physical symptoms of impurity and\n  spiritual degradation be felt. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587512153/leprosy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Encyclopedia Judaica</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In fact, biblical descriptions of ẓaraʿat do not include the necrosis\n  associated with Hansen's disease. Thus far no skeletons of the\n  biblical period show any signs of Hansen's disease.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that we do not treat it as a (physical) disease sent by Hashem as a punishment, but as a totally spiritual one.</p>\n\n<p>As Rashi says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9914#showrashi=true&v=46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tazria 13:46</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>He shall dwell isolated</strong>: [meaning] that other unclean people [not stricken with tzara’ath] shall not abide with him. Our Sages said:\n  “Why is he different from other unclean people, that he must remain\n  isolated? Since, with his slander, he caused a separation [i.e., a\n  rift] between man and wife or between man and his fellow, he too,\n  shall be separated [from society].”- [Arachin 16b] [This rationale is\n  based on the premise that a person is stricken with tzara’ath as a\n  result of his talking לְשׁוֹן הָרַע, i.e., speaking derogatorily of\n  others, although he may be telling the truth.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We see from here, though, that as long as one knows that Hashem is in charge there shouldn't be an issue, until that focus is lost, at which point one violates the prohibition recorded in Devarim 17:2-5: \"If you will find in your midst in one of your cities...a man or a woman...who goes and serves foreign gods and bows to them, <strong>and to the sun and the moon and to any legion of the heavens</strong>...and you should take the man or the woman out...and stone them with stones and they will die.\" (By the way, \"they\" in this context is used correctly in the plural.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>First, concerning forms, it seems that form of man and celest creatures are at the first rank of prohibition regarding fabrication, owning, even if it is not for worship, owning is prohibited from fear or worship.</p>\n<p>Gemara AZ 43b</p>\n<p>‏ [ע\"ז דף מג' עמוד ב'] דתניא טבעת שחותמה בולט אסור להניחה ומותר לחתום בה חותמה שוקע מותר להניחה ואסור לחתום בה ‏</p>\n<p>for it has been taught: It is forbidden to put on a signet-ring which is cut in relief but it is allowed to seal with it; and if the signet is in, one may put the ring on but not seal with it.</p>\n<p>Rambam</p>\n<p>‏ יח וכן אסור לצור דמות חמה ולבנה כוכבים ומזלות ומלאכים, שנאמר \"לא תעשון, איתי\" (שמות כ,יט) לא תעשון כדמות שמשין המשמשין לפניי במרום, ואפילו על הלוח. ‏</p>\n<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to make an image of the sun, the moon, the stars, the constellations, or the angels, as [implied by Exodus, ibid.]: \"Do not make with Me [gods of silver...]\" - i.e., do not make images of My servants, those who serve before Me on high.

Realize that this is before Talmud Bavli became \"<strong>The</strong> Gemara\", at least in the eyes of the community whose ancestors were taught by the amoraim of Israel, as recorded in the Talmud Yerushalmi.

This trend then continues into Ashkenaz, where much Eretz Yisrael practice co-existed with Babylonian rulings. (At least according to the dominant theory in the history of halakhah.) And now that the the gemara and geonim gained universal acceptance they had to find an understanding of halakhah that includes both the babylonian texts and practices that come from a wider variety of sources.

It will not only force you to learn more effectively and accurately in preparation, but will also result in a tangible accomplishment. \nI know someone personally who gave a weekly shiur primarily in order to bolster his own learning, and ended up writing a book based on the material from the shiur!</p>\n\n<p>3) If you feel accomplished when doing excercise because you know you are ensuring your health and fit body,\nyou should feel similarly regarding learning and your soul - there are many sources that indicate that Torah is very, very good for your soul.\nPerhaps learning sforim/sources that talk about the benefits Torah learning has on oneself would help you attain that 'tangible outcome' feeling when you learn.</p>\n\n<p>4) The following is translated from a letter of the Steipler Gaon (Krina Di'igrsa vol. 2 letter 3):</p>\n\n<p>\"The main advice for achieving a sweet feeling from learning is understanding it deeply. And you must specifically learn with a good chaver and not in solitude. When you do find yourself learning alone, speak out with your mouth in a way you yourself understand all the details of what you learned: 'This Tanna's opinion is this, that Tanna's opinion is that, and their reasoning is such-and-such, and Rashi explains it like this, and Tosfos explain it like that, and this is the reason Tosfos disagrees with Rashi', etc. etc......over the course of time you will acquire the sweetness of Torah in large measure, but do not expect it to come immediately or in a short time, for all beginnings are difficult....and you should know that more beloved is one time with pain than a hundred times without pain as it says in Avos DR\"N chapter 3 - and all the siyata dishmaya you merit to achieve is by virtue of [initially] learning with pain.....and you should know that you will be compensated over the course of time - no pain or effort on your part will be for naught....you need to pray with your whole heart to beseech God...that you should attain the sweetness of Torah, and that you should have a good and appropriate study partner, and that you should have siyata dshmaya - all this you should pray for after Shmoneh Esrei after the verse of 'yihyu lratzon...' every day.

The Schottenstein notes (29a4, 35) says that \"this month ushers in the tie during which great miracles...occurred\" which sees to remove any specific historical relevance just invoking a quirk of the calendar.

But the Gemara further report a Berayita which show machloket Tanayim, for the <strong>beginning</strong> of the mourning custom and for the <strong>end</strong>. In this Gemara we can find somewhat about Rosh Chodesh Av. For the end of the mourning period, some Tanayim said up to the end of the month and some others up to the fast. For the beginning, some Tanayim said from the first day of the month and some Tanayim said from the first day of the week of the fast. See the text Taanit 29b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דתניא ... מר''ח ועד התענית דברי רבי מאיר רבי יהודה אומר כל החדש כולו אסור  ‏</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir and Rabbi Yehuda thinks that mourning customs begin the first day of the month.

For Rabbi Yehuda the mourning period is the whole month of Av.</p>\n<p>רשב''ג אומר אינו אסור אלא אותה שבת בלבד ‏</p>\n<p>For Rabban Gamliel the whole week of the fast needs mourning customs, e.g. if the fast is Wednesday, the mourning is from Sunday up to Shabbat.</p>\n<p>... ושלשתן מקרא אחד דרשו, דכתיב (הושע ב', יג') והשבתי כל משושה חגה חדשה ושבתה. מאן דאמר מראש חדש ועד התענית <strong>מחגה</strong> ומאן דאמר כולו אסור - מחדשה, ומאן דאמר כל השבת כולה אסור - משבתה. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The days of mourning are learned from a verse in Hosea (2, 15) in which G-d announce that He will cancel the happiness of Jewish people, in \"festival\", \"month\" and \"week\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִשְׁבַּתִּי֙ כָּל-מְשׂוֹשָׂ֔הּ חַגָּ֖הּ חָדְשָׁ֣הּ וְשַׁבַּתָּ֑הּ וְכֹ֖ל מוֹעֲדָֽהּ:‏</p>\n<p>I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her <strong>feast days</strong>, her new <strong>moons</strong>, and her <strong>sabbaths</strong>, and all her solemn feasts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>--> RM (1-9 Av) learns from feast days, because Rosh Chodesh is also called feast.</p>\n<p>--> RY learns from moons, the whole month of Av.</p>\n<p>--> RSBG learns from sabbaths (weeks).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code>Was there anything that happened specifically on the 1st of Av that made it a time to make increased mourning?</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously not.

Unfortunately, most of these ovens do not translate into English or other languages very well. Also, most of these oven types were lost to Ashkenazim for many centuries as the type of dirt, and the weather required to have such an oven made it nearly impossible to make them.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1yihaEHoSELRXZkUkNsa1ZhZ00\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is a list of all the types of earthenware ovens in the Talmud</a>, please specify which kind you are trying to make so we can help you better.</p>\n\n<p>You are correct, one cannot kasher an earthenware k'li. The only exception is that if you heat it to a temperature of a kiln, which is the point that it typically melts and becomes new, and in that case, you will destroy your oven. But in general, only the surfaces that actually touch the food become a k'li, and therefore only those spots absorb taste. Therefore, depending on how you construct your oven, you can swap out sections of it to cook different things. </p>\n\n<p>Here is a picture of my earthenware oven, which is most closely related to the תנור oven mentioned in the Talmud. It was built out of flowerpots from my local hardware store, and the top most earthenware piece/pot/top can be removed and replaced. So i have one \"top\" that is parve and chametz free, and one \"top\" that is dairy and contains chametz. i use this oven to bake normal flatbread and grilled vegetables during the year, and switch out to a different \"top\" to bake matzah during Pesach.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JPbqB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JPbqB.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3LQhV.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3LQhV.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>As for sources, any sources you have regarding earthenware apply here. The surface (where food touches) of the oven becomes a k'li. So as long as the food doesn't touch a specific surface of the oven, that section of the oven does not become a k'li.</p>\n\n<p>The only concern might be with vapor/steam. If the food is very liquidy, then there is concern that the steam of the food might absorb into the earthenware. If the food is more solid, then there is less concern regarding vapor/steam. In the end it's up to you to decide how strict you want to be regarding this issue, as there are very many opinions regarding this issue. Here is a document that has many relevant opinions regarding this matter.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1yihaEHoSELRlA4SVozamFwdDQ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1yihaEHoSELRlA4SVozamFwdDQ</a> </p>\n\n\n",

Only at Kir-hareseth did the stone walls remain, until the slingers surrounded and attacked it” (2 Kings 3:25-26).</p>\n\n<p><strong>The question is whether the wall was destroyed or not. The conjunction ‘ad (“until”) in v.26 seems to indicate that it was destroyed, but the next verse says that Mesha sacrificed his son on the wall. If the wall was indeed destroyed, then we should read v. 27 as indicating that Mesha sacrificed his son on the rubble of the wall. If not destroyed, then the prophecy was not technically totally fulfilled.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, the fact remains that the Moabites subsequently routed their enemies after the sacrifice of the son, and since this was not expected according to the prophecy, it might be classed as a failure. </p>\n\n<p>2 Kings 3:27 says that the Israelites withdrew from Moab after Mesha sacrificed his eldest son.</p>\n\n\n",

I observe that most people gather  all 4 tzitzis and not the two as stated by the Shulchan Oruch. Why is this?</p>\n\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8817/kissing-tzitzis-during-shema\">Kissing Tzitzis during Shema</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>As already source by Noach miFrankfurt in his answer, the German Minhag and likely original minhag Ashkenaz, was only to hold the front corners. This is also the practice of the Vilna Gaon (as recorded in the siddur Eizor Eliyahu), because he strongly felt that it was important for tzitzis to be worn with two of them in front and two in back.</p>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh says only take 2 tzitziyos. (Orakh Chaim 25:5. In the Beis Yoseif the author of the Shulchan Arukh cites the Hagahos Maimon end of ch. 3. The Beis Yoseif also mentions that the Avudraham considers the whole practice of holding tzitzis during Shema to be yuharah, an egotistical holier-than-thou, but only because the masses don't do it. And therefore the Avudraham's ruling would not invalidate following a general minhag to do so.)</p>\n\n<p>As for meaning... The SA explains that brings 16 string and 10 knots visible, corresponding to the gematria of the tetragrammaton (10 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 26 = 16 + 10). The Magen Avraham ad loc says the 10 knots correspond to the 10 Sefiros. </p>\n\n<p>The Kaf haChaim (ad loc #8) explains this custom is to hold the font tzitzios in the left hand, as it's closer to the heart. He also mentions the position of the Ari, that one takes all four corners in both hands.</p>\n\n<p>The Levush (#2) speaks of holding \"the tzitzis\" in one's left hand, next to the heart. This rather authoritative decisor who tends to give weight to accepted Ashkenazi rulings of his era is a bit ambiguous. \"The tzitzis\" would seem to mean all four; but as we saw in the Kaf haChaim, the left hand is more the two string practice.</p>\n\n<p>The Arukh haShulchan (who started before the Mishnah Berurah, but wrote Orach Chaim later) also says \"the tzitzis\", and says one takes them in the left hand, but holds them in both when getting ready to kiss them for Shema. (#3) In the Be'eir Heiteiv, the Mishnah Berurah appears to rule similarly. So, both of the major codes written at the end of pre-War East European Jewry rule like the Ari -- 4 tzitzis, both hands, at least while kissing if not the whole time.</p>\n\n<p>Getting to contemporary rulings: R Herschel Shachter rules one should follow the Shulchan Arukh and only use two. (But then, his Brisker background makes it more likely he would rule like the Vilna Gaon than the more common East European custom.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/qoj5lwevr8y9n0d/Tefiloh-Sefas-Yisroel-v.1.16.pdf?dl=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Tefilloh Sefas Yisroel</em></a> (p. 33), while the halacha (or more accurately, minhag) as brought in Shulchan Aruch and numerous other sources is to hold the two front tzitzit, it is brought in the name of the Yosef Ometz (R' Juspa Hahn of Frankfurt a/M) that holding all four corners is a chiddush of R' Yitzchak Luria Ashkenazi (see also יוסף אומץ רפ”ט, where he brings both opinions).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Vilna Gaon, as brought in Sefer Maase Rav, #39, only the front 2 tzitzios are gathered.

He describes a situation in which the pupils don't have pleasure with the study but the teacher has, and prohibit because the pleasure of the teacher. the teacher is adult and the pupils are children, the teacher is accustomed with the Gemara and Children not. Here is a Group in which a minority will enjoy and the majority will not. The learning is prohibited for the minority. But this minority is the generator of the learning and cannot be skipped, if it was possible, the learning should be organized without this minority. So if a person enjoy to learn the sad topics, he cannot learn. This proof is not really a proof because the group cannot be uniform when for the teacher and the pupils the topic represent something else. <strong>Anyway Svara Peshuta that to enjoy at hight degree is the problem, not the learning.

You can ask: We already know that The Halacha is ruled against Rabbi Meir (Who stated that a study which is hard because new is permitted) because all study will lead the student to happiness when he finally understand!? The answer is that when there is a stronger reason to not be happy, The hardness to teach children and the teacher will be allowed to learn Chumash and Gemara whith children.

(Assume we're dealing with a Yachid.)</p>\n\n<p>Granted that Hallel is also a separate mitzvah (as indicated by its bracha of \"likro es hahallel,\" as opposed to a sub-mitzvah of davening), if one misses Shacharis, must he say Hallel before Mussaf, or may he recite it after? If before, does he say it in the usual place, before Ashrei?</p>\n\n<p>(Side note: I don't believe that these are two separate questions as both deal with the order of davening when Shacharis is missed, and answering one may help answer the other.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mussaf and Shaharit are not me'akev each other.  The proper order is to say it after shaharit based on Rambam (Tefillah 9:13-4) and  Shulchan Aruch 286:1.  This is primarily based on the principle of Tadir VeSheino Tadir-the more common takes precedence as said by Rabbenu Yonah 19a says that even though Mussaf could be said all day it should be said after Shacharit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If time for Shaharit is missed and its after 6.5 hours into the day:</strong></p>\n\n<p>(Yalkut Yosef shabbat 286.14) If an individual did not recite the musaf prayer until the time when one may recite minha prayer, he must recite the minha prayer before the musaf prayer. The earliest time one can pray minha is 6.5 hours into the day called Minha Gedola (the Tur 233:1 sets this as the primary time.) According to Rambam (Tefillah 3:2-3) the preferred time is 9.5 hours into the day and be'diavad 6.5 hours. The Shulchan Aruch 233:1, rules like the Rambam and Mishna Brurah (ibid), concurs with the Rambam and S'A, adding that if there is a need one can pray the earlier time.<br>\nAs a result, this translates in to the normal order of minha (depending on your particular custom and whether it is Shabbat, Yom tov, Rosh Hodesh, etc..) at minimal ashre then uva-letzion (if it wasn't said in morning order) then the amida of minha then amida of mussaf.  This is not considered a make-up for having missed mussaf, only that mussaf can be prayed anytime within this time frame, which again follows the above principle of the more common takes precedence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If missed Amida of Shaharit and its before 4 hours into the day:</strong></p>\n\n<p>YY 286.12 says that if one prayed amida of mussaf before amida of shacharit he has fulfilled his obligation but be'diavad, in other words you can't intend to pray amida of mussaf prior to amida of shacharit. The proper order would be to pray shaharit first before mussaf.</p>\n\n<p>S'A 52.1 and Yalkut Yosef 1.65: List the minimum one must pray in order to pray amida of shaharit together is the full Shema Yisrael with the blessings and then proceed with the full amida of shaharit. If one calculates more time then he adds additional passage (ad loc.) from the pesuke dezimra and if one calculates more time he adds more passages (ad loc.) and so on.  As a result, if the tzibur already finished the amida of shaharit and one came late and you can still catch up with the tzibur to say the mussaf amida together then you can follow S'A 52.1 order of one that came late and can still catch up to pray together with the tzibbur. Otherwise you have to pray the normal order of Shaharit before you can pray mussaf.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If missed Amida of Shaharit and after 4 hours into the day but before 6 hours into the day:</strong></p>\n\n<p>RAMBAM (tefillah 3.1)  time for shaharit extends till 4th hour if it is missed one errors and prays after, he fulfills his obligation be'deavad. RAMBAM (tefillah 3.5) Proper time for Mussaf is after shaharit and before the 7th hour. The proper order here would be the same as above for praying shaharit first before mussaf and the items that you can skip to catch up. </p>\n\n<p>RAMBAM (tefillah 3.9) If one hasn't prayed shaharit until 6th hour of the day, it is proper to read minha twice.  And in the case of mussaf, one will follows the order of praying minha then mussaf and then shaharit (YY 286.14)  </p>\n\n<p>If one wants to pray mussaf before minha, See the following link (<a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Mussaf#cite_note-15\" rel=\"nofollow\">halachipedia</a>) Tosfot (Brachot 28a s.v. Halacha) quotes the Ri who says that one only has to pray Mincha before Mussaf if one plans on praying both at this time however if one plans to say Mincha later one may pray Mussaf now. However, the anonymous first opinion of Tosfot argues. The Rashba sides with the Ri (and infers it from the language of the Gemara) and quotes the Teshuvat Goanim which also agrees. The Rabbenu Yonah (Brachot 19a s.v. VeYesh) comes up with this same idea on his own. The Tur 286:3 quotes it as a dispute but then writes that the Rosh would pray by himself and leave the minyan in order to pray mussaf before the time for Mincha comes. The Bet Yosef 286:4 quotes all the above rishonim who hold like the Ri. The S”A 286:4 writes the simple halacha that Mincha precedes mussaf and then quotes the opinion of the Ri (implying that the halacha doesn’t follow the Ri).</p>\n\n<p><strong>If praying alone</strong></p>\n\n<p>There is no general leniency that I am aware of that allows you to skip parts of the order of Shaharit before proceeding to the order of Mussaf. The order of prayer is setup the way it is for many reasons and one can't break them unless he really knows what he is doing. This would have to be answered by your Rav or at least a competent Rav (if you don't have a personal Rav to go to) and depending on your personal situation he will recommend the path to follow.</p>\n\n\n",

However he adds we should limit this allowance as much as possible as it is no better than all other business which we limit in this period.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Berurah addresses why we allow the non Jew to be misaken the clothing even though we don't allow them to wash our clothing during this time period as seen in siff 3. He explains that at this stage in the clothings construction, it does not as of yet belong to the Jew and is not referred to as the Jews clothing. Apparently, according to the M.B. the Ramma was only referring to the old system where a professional builder owns the product they are creating.

But this would have no bearing on a suit bought in a department store which is then brought to a tailor. </p>\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan #20 has a different approach to this problem. His solution is that since washing clothing was explicitly mentioned in the gemara as being not allowed we are more stringent and don't even allow a non Jew to perform this for us. This seems like a promising leniency, however, he goes on with the idea that the Ramma mentions to limit this as much as possible and adds his own stringency saying that the only time to allow the non Jew to be misaken it is for a mitzvah like chassan and kalla for which we would allow the non Jew to be misaken on Tisha Bi'av itself.

As he was coming he shot an arrow towards the east, and it fell in Jerusalem. He then  shot one towards the west, and it again fell in Jerusalem. He shot towards all four points of the compass, and each time it fell in Jerusalem. He said to a certain boy: Repeat to me [the last] verse of Scripture you have learnt. He said: And I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel. He said: The Holy One, blessed be He, desires to lay waste his House and to lay the blame on me. So he ran away and became a proselyte, and R. Meir was descended from him.\"</p>\n<p>Does this indicate that Nero converted to Judaism since he ran away from destroying Jerusalem \"and became a proselyte\"? Furthermore, R. Meir is considered to be one of his star descendants.</p>\n<p>Is this simply a fictional piece of folklore? If so, why would the Rabbinical scribes even insert this portion in the text? What purpose is it meant to serve?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I came across a possible explanation as to why the rabbis would insert this brief tid bit about Nero converting to Judaism into the narrative (if it wasn't factual -- if there are sources supporting that his conversion was factual, please do list -- that would be interesting)! </p>\n\n<p>In Jeffrey Rubenstein's \"Talmudic Stories: Narrative Art, Composition, and Culture,\" he dedicates an entire chapter to Gittin 55b-56b. He theorizes that not only does this passage deal with the obvious destruction of Jerusalem, but with the Rabbinic Authority. Throughout the passage, we see how the sages' inability to decide due to being too cautious leads to destruction. </p>\n\n<p>Rubenstein posits that Nero's presence is to serve as a stark contrast to the sages. Like the sages, Nero displays caution by soliciting an oracle that his imperial commission to attack Jerusalem meets divine approval (the four arrows falling towards Jerusalem). He sought additional confirmation – by consulting the child and having him rehearse a scripture, which details the destruction of Jerusalem. </p>\n\n<p>Nero, like the sages, faces a difficult decision (the rabbis had previously faced a difficult decision on how to react to a host treating an unwanted guest at a banquet as well as how to handle the emperor's blemished calf he personally offered). Nero acts by not destroying Jerusalem by fleeing and converting to Judaism, thereby avoiding the clutches of the emperor, demonstrating his faith in the God of Israel and siding with the ultimate victor. </p>\n\n<p>It is here that Rubenstein explains this antedote: \"The strange/nonhistorical account functions as an ironic foil with which to compare the behavior of the sages. When pressed to act by the emperor, they do not seek omens, or inquire of children, or turn to the text themselves. Nero – the Roman – the pagan, the goy – does... Nero’s courage produces a rabbinic authority and the proliferation of Torah; rabbinic cowardice leads to the destruction of Jerusalem.\"</p>\n\n<p>Essentially, according to Rubenstein, the Nero scene is an ironic \"slap-in-the-face\" to the sages, who failed to act, because even the wicked pagan Nero knew to seek counsel from a higher being, etc. </p>\n\n<p>Now this is Rubenstein's interpretation. I would be interested to know what other interpretations are out there (and if there are supporting evidences for Nero's conversion). </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Flavius Josephus reports in the Wars of the Jews that Nero reigned \"thirteen years and eight days\" (contrary to Jerome's report).  \"Thirteen years\" and \"eight days\" only occurs together in Bereishit/Genesis 17.  Flavius Josephus is informing his Jewish readers (in code) that Nero's \"suicide\" (death of his gentile self) was by circumcision.  The passages surrounding this are dealing with historical events surrounding the destruction of the Temple.  They're not just telling vain faerie tales.  Nero's received history is due to the sheer number of gentile voices repeating it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are differing opinions in historical scholarship what was Nero's end. Some say that he committed suicide, whereas others claim that he ran away and was executed. Clearly there was not specific testimony as to what really happened. So, it is not a contradiction to accept the Talmud's tradition that Nero converted. Certainly the Roman historians would not record that a Roman Emperor converted to become a Jew.</p>\n\n\n",

So Rav Achai Bar Yaakov said that <strong>men over 60 were not included in the death of that generation</strong> as derived from a <em>gezeira Shava</em> (common word used for deriving common laws between 2 passages) of the word \"<em>Vamaala</em>\" written here and in the Parsha of Arachin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I understand Breslov generally uses the Arizal/Chabad method for their tzitzis, but where did this method come from? Did Rabbi Nachman or some other Breslover rabbi invent it? It appears to be some sort of combination between Rambam and Arizal tzitzis. (Notice the chulyos with the inclusion of the 5 knots, as well as the half-string techeiles.) Could someone offer an explanation or source on where this method came from? I have included some pictures for easy access. The first 2 are Breslov (one with techeiles the other not) and the 3rd one is one of the Yemenite methods, which is very similar, minus the 5 knots.

Similar to sfardi, but the sfardi method is a loop on every winding of the shammes string whereas the Breslovers method is every third. </p>\n\n<p>This method was not made up by R' Nachman, it was made up by the Arizal. (At least that's how the Ba'al haTanya understood it). The Breslovers are actually not the only ones who tie their tzitzis like this. Chabad and many other Chassidim do too. Breslov is unique in the fact that they have tcheiles strings also, as opposed to the other factions.<br>\nHere is a picture of Chabad Tzitzis:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0vee9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0vee9.jpg\" alt=\"chabad tzitzis\"></a></p>\n\n<p>And here is sfardi tzitzis:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/W5q3b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/W5q3b.jpg\" alt=\"sfardi\"></a></p>\n\n<p>You have to look closely, but you can see the difference between the two versions.</p>\n\n<p>Belz also has a loop every third winding, but its a bit different. The way they understand the Arizal, is that the Shamess string (the long one that is used to circle the others) should go THROUGH the other 7 strings on every third winding. They are also careful to keep the two sets of strings separate through every loop. (Meaning, at the beginning, there are 4 strings that are folded over to make 8. They are careful that the split that the shammes makes should have the same 4 strings on each side every time).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it ok for a Jew to wear tzitzit with a blue string (techeiles)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was told by someone today that some mo religious zionists will wear tzitzit with a blue string? That it is becoming more popular. I have never heard this before. </p>\n\n<p>Edit- I know what techeiles are I just have not ever seen anyone wear  them or heard of an observant Jew wearing them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The blue string you are referring to is called a techeiles string, after Numbers 15:38 where it states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר יי אל משה לאמר: דבר אל בני ישראל ואמרת אלהם ועשו להם ציצת על-כנפי  בגדיהם לדרתם ונתנו על-ציצת הכנף פתיל תכלת:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation: And Hashem said to Moses, \"Speak to the Children of Israel and instruct them to make for themselves tzitzis on the four corners of their garments throughout their generations and place upon each corner a cord of blue in each tzitzis.\"</p>\n\n<p>The cord of blue is talked about in the Talmud (source?) in which it explains this blue cord's dye comes from a certain sea-creature from the Mediterranean Sea called the chilazon (חלזון) which surfaces once a lifetime (every seventy years in the language of the Talmud). By the time the Talmud was compiled, however, this mysterious recipe and sea-creature of the blue dye became lost, and tzitzis started being made with all-white strings. The blue dye is called \"techeiles\" in Hebrew. (תכלת)</p>\n\n<p>For years this dye was lost, but in recent times, some authorities have claimed they have rediscovered the chilazon and have extracted blue dye from it. There are three opinions: the chilazon is lost, and it will not be rediscovered until Eliyahu Hanavi shows it to us in the Days of Moshiach, the cuttlefish is the chilazon, and the crustacean Murex Trunculus is the chilazon. Let's talk about these opinions.</p>\n\n<p>The first opinion is that the chilazon and the recipe for techeiles is lost, and will not be rediscovered until the Days of Moshiach when Eliyahu Hanavi points it out to us (source?), which goes with the writings of the Holy Ari. This is the commonly accepted opinion, so most tzitzis you see people wearing are all-white.</p>\n\n<p>The second opinion is that the cuttlefish is the long lost chilazon. The last rabbi of Radzyn, after studying much in the Talmud and visiting an aquarium in the late 1800s, formed the opinion that the cuttlefish was the chilazon, and successfully extracted blue dye from it. His chassidim began wearing it in their tzitzis, and most Breslover Chassidim also wear it in their tzitzis as well. This opinion, however, is not highly respected, and is generally turned down because of many reasons, including the discovery of an ancient piece of Judean cloth which contained a blue dye coming from a sea creature discovered in 1995 called the Murex Trunculus.</p>\n\n<p>The Murex Trunculus is a type of crustacean that lives in the Mediterranean and has been widely accepted by many as the true identity of the chilazon, after much research and debate by the Ptil Tekhelet Organization, discoverer of the dye recipe. Because the dye on the ancient cloth matches the techeiles produced by Ptil Tekhelet, and other archaeological finds match as well, this dye holds most ground for being the real techeiles, which is why people don't really believe the Radzyn techeiles is the real deal. </p>\n\n<p>Others say that the Murex Trunculus could be the real chilazon, and the dye produced by Ptil Tekhelet is real, but choose to continue the tradition of wearing all-white tzitzis on the basis that if a tradition is discontinued for 100 years, it becomes discontinued forever. But in short almost no one believes that Radzyner techeiles is real techeiles anymore. Even some Radzyners and Breslovers are now turning to Ptil Tekhelet.</p>\n\n<p>The argument for the wearing of techeiles is a large topic, and cannot be discussed in great detail on Mi Yodeya. I will provide some further reading so you can learn some about it on your own. Forgive me also for my lack of sources.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tekhelet.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ptil Tekhelet Organization Website</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tekhelet\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tekhelet, Wikipedia</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tzitzit.tallit-shop.com/ptil-tekhelet-and-radzin-techelet-strings/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ben's Tallit Shop: Ptil Tekhelet and Radzin Techelet</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://tekhelet.com/tekhelet/introduction-to-tekhelet/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ptil Tekhelet: Introduction to Tekhelet</a></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://melamedblog.wordpress.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melamed: Techeiles</a></p>\n\n<p>Also, slightly off-topic: I know for fact that Rabbi Chaim Richman of the Temple Institute wears Ptil Tekhelet, because of the last time I saw him. Some people believe that Moshiach is working around us now, and that the discovery of the chilazon ushers the Days of Moshiach.

Is this explicitly identified as a Third Temple anywhere there? Otherwise, what's the earliest source that explicitly says there will be a Third Temple?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is no 3rd Temple in a religious sense. It's a rebuilding of the second. The holiness of the second Temple is \"sanctified for its time, and sanctified through to the future to come\" -- ie all eternity. Just as we don't consider Herod's rebuilding and enhancement of the Second Temple to be a 3rd Temple, technically the messianic one will be a rebuilding of a Temple whose holiness is already there. Not a new Temple. It's only the nearly 2 millennial gap between them that make the language of \"Third Temple\" (בית שלישי) useful. But despite common usage, even in very notable primary rabbinic sources, it's not really meaningful on halachic or aggadic levels.</p>\n\n<p>As to actually answer the question you were obviously trying to ask...</p>\n\n<p>When neither the Great Assembly when they first built the second Temple, the Maccabbees and Herod when they rebuilt it conformed to Ezekiel's description, the notion that it must be rebuilt again became compelling.</p>\n\n<p>So, aside from people deducing as much during the 2nd Temple, it was enshrined shortly after in the siddur. The prayer on Divine Service, said in the Temple (Tamid 5:1, quoted in Berakhos 11a), was adapted for the Amidah as the blessing that begins \"Retzeih\". In it, and many equally ancient quotes from the siddur, we ask G-d to restore the Temple and its worship. The request to return the service to the Sanctuary of Your House might date back to the Second Temple era, a request to restore those elements of First Temple worship that were impossible in the second. But more likely the words were inserted at the time it was adapted for post-temple use.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, and codified in text only a couple of centuries even later, the laws of kings require that restoring the kingship would obligate him to make sure a Temple exists. Since there is none now, unless one comes down from heaven (Midrash Tanchuma, Pekudei 11), the messianic king would be obligated to build one (Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 1:11, Pesachim 9:1).</p>\n\n\n",

Halachah and archaeology don't technically agree on things.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Radzyner Rebbe wrote three books about it, so <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/41312\" rel=\"noreferrer\">that would be a good place</a> to check.</p>\n\n<p>Dr. Mendel Singer wrote an <a href=\"http://www.tekhelet.com/pdf/mendel.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">article</a> about techelet, and in the course of the article, he mentions how the Radzyner Rebbe understood various sources in Chazal to refer to the cuttlefish. For example:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the requirement of once in 70 years, the\n  Radzyner Rebbe says this means that there are times when the chilazon is\n  abundant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And presumably there are times when the cuttlefish is abundant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hidden in the sand: The Gemara in Megilah states that the verse in Devarim\n  33:19, \"sefunei temunei chol\" (\"hidden treasures of the sand\"), refers\n  to the chilazon shel techeilet... On the other hand, it might\n  mean that it is hidden because it is buried in the sand. This is the\n  understanding of the Radzyner Rebbe, citing the Sefer HaKaneh (Hilchot\n  Tzitzit) as stating that the chilazon buries itself in sand with its\n  head sticking out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And the cuttlefish buries itself in the sand.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Color of the blood: Rambam states that the \"blood\" of the chilazon shel\n  techeilet is black like ink\".[46] Rashi states that the appearance\n  of the \"blood\" of the chilazon shel techeilet is like the color of\n  techeilet.[47] The Radzyner Rebbe reconciles the apparent contradiction\n  between Rashi and Rambam by explaining that when Rashi says maris damo,\n  \"appearance of its blood\", he is referring to the \"blood\" after it is\n  prepared for dyeing, while Rambam refers to the original color of the\n  \"blood\".[48]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And this is presumably true of the cuttlefish.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Treatment for hemorrhoids: The Gemara also tells us that the\n  chilazon was used to treat hemorrhoids.... Additionally, the Radzyner Rebbe had already written that\n  cuttlefish ink has been used as a treatment for hemorrhoids since ancient\n  times.[52] Indeed, it is still sold today for this purpose.[53]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So the cuttlefish is a good match.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Tentacles bent like hooks: The Mishnah describes a chain hanging on\n  the wall, with something called a chilazon attached to the head of the\n  chain.[55] The mefarshim say it was called this because it was shaped\n  like the chilazon shel techeilet[56], and Tiferes Yisroel explicitly\n  states that this was an iron hook attached at the end which was used to\n  hang the chain on a wall. The Radzyner Rebbe understands this to mean\n  the chilazon has long tentacles that are bent like hooks.[57]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which apparently would match the cuttlefish.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest problem, which disproves cuttlefish, is not <strong>archaeological</strong>. It is that its dye is not blue. And the Radzyner Rebbe was misled by an unscrupulous chemist. Basically, he asked this chemist to take cuttlefish ink and make it into a non-fading blue dye. And the chemist accomplished this by a process which basically broke down the molecules of the original organic material (via high temperatures) to the constituent atoms and added iron filings which combined with it, leading to ferric ferrocyanide, or Prussian blue. Start with <strong>ANY</strong> organic material (with carbon and nitrogen; for instance, human cells) and subject it to the process and you will end up with the same Prussian blue. So it is not coming from the cuttlefish specifically. So if this is the source and the process, why specifically the chilazon?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.baruchsterman.com/tekhelet.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Thus</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In 1913, Rabbi Isaac Herzog, then Chief Rabbi of Dublin and later the first Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel, as part of research towards his doctoral thesis, sent samples of the Radzyn tekhelet to leading chemists and dye experts in Germany, France and England for analysis. The results that he received were surprising. The experts determined that the blue dye of Radzyn was not organic in nature, but rather was the inorganic dye known as Prussian Blue, or ferric ferrocyanide. Herzog refused to believe that the Radzyner Rebbe would have purposely misled his followers and wrote to the dye masters of Radzyn asking for their process. Upon investigation, the solution to the riddle became apparent. The Radzyn recipe called for heating the squid ink to very high temperatures and then for the addition of iron filings. What in fact happens under these conditions is that the organic molecules break down and the constituent atoms of carbon and nitrogen recombine with the iron, yielding Prussian Blue dye. The squid ink is not an essential component for this reaction; any organic substance could be substituted, since the structure of the molecule is irrelevant and only the elemental components are utilized. Herzog could not accept the notion that the Talmudic requirement for a specific marine source, the hillazon, could be based on such an indirect and vague relationship. He therefore concluded that the Radzyn tekhelet could not be considered authentic.[52]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a great series online at Torahanytime.com by Rabbi Daniel Glatstein specifically on this topic and I believe you might find what you are looking for there.

He says this is a kal vichomer from being allowed to heal them in order to have children. Also we find that nochrim are commanded in sheves like a slave (Gitten 41) and see Tosafos Chagiga 2b that pru urvu was said to all bnei noach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Golstein takes extreme issue with this last statement. All the Achronim, Maharsha first and foremost say this is not true as we know from Sanhedrin 59b pru urvu does not apply to nochrim. \nMishneh Lamelech Chapter 10 of hilchos milachim halacha 7 says Tosafos were obviously only referring to a Jewish owned slave. </p>\n\n<p>He also brings a list of other achronim, Shvus Yaakov Sfas Emes Emek Shaila who try to reconcile the words of Tosafos, but all obviously hold that nochrim certainly do not have pru urvu. </p>\n\n<p>Considering all this he rules stringently saying we must take the tradition of the Chavos Yair into consideration, and we may not arrange their marriage.</p>\n\n<p>He also adds that he saw in Beis Shearim Yo'D #227 to be stringent. It was a responsum to his own son at the end of which he added that even in a situation of extreme necessity for a livelihood he should be stringent and Hashem will send him sustenance from an allowed source.</p>\n\n<p>Earlier Rabbi Goldstein also mentions the issue of speaking good of a nochri which will obviously come up when mentioning each parties virtues to other.

The parachute, in this context is a large (many feet in diameter), strong, circular cloth, usually with handles around the edges. Typically, it is completely unfurled on or parallel to the floor, and players stand around its circumference and hold it up by its edges. Then, they collectively manipulate it, to raise and lower it, to make waves in it, to make the center descend and pop up, etc. Some <a href=\"http://www.atschool.co.uk/keystage2-ks2/pshe.asp?section=9136\" rel=\"noreferrer\">games</a> include some or all players going underneath the unfurled parachute; in many of these games, the parachute is referred to as a \"tent.\"</p>\n<p>I am wondering whether parachute games, as described above, particularly the ones that involve going under it as a \"tent,\" are permitted on Shabbat. It certainly sounds a lot like \"building a tent,\" which is one of the activities prototypically banned under the category of <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/the-39-melachos/melacha34/\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Boneh</em> (Building)</a>. <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Boneh#Building_a_tent\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Halachipedia says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It’s forbidden to set up the roof of a tent, permanent or temporary, on Shabbat, even if one there are no walls. ...

Two people will be able to be careful. Still, the M.B. adds that due to this concern, we generally abstain from hanging a curtain at all on shabbos.</p>\n\n<p>The Aruch Hashulchan (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Aruch_HaShulchan.1.315.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">O.C. 315:16</a>) also discusses the issue. He first points out that this idea of the Rambam seemingly contradicts a gemara (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.138b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shabbos 138b</a>) which posed this type of situation as being obviously allowed. The wording in the gemara states it is obviously allowed to place ones talis over one's head even though this will make a roof of a <em>tephach</em>. The A.H. differentiates between the two cases by saying the gemara was not discussing someone involved in making a structure at all. The Rambam's case of the curtain was someone who was involved with some type of <em>ohel</em>, so he was stringent.</p>\n\n<p>I think from all of the above we can assume a parachute where one is involved in making a temporary ohel would not be allowed.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted the Chazzon Ish (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14336&st=&pgnum=157&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">52:5</a>) wrote that the words of the Shulchan Aruch are not understandable (\"<em>stumim</em>\") and the explanation of the M.B. did nothing to help understand them, as we find that one is allowed to hang a curtain for shade. He did not however go on record as arguing and saying it was allowed.</p>\n\n\n",

A part of the bellow is true for R.A.B.A. too.\n\n<ul>\n<li>According to Rav Huna, when someone, A round the corner of someone else, B both are guilty. So there are two prohibited 'activities', to round and to leave someone rounding you.</li>\n<li>the hekesh teach us that this separation is also true for maring beard.</li>\n<li>The hekesh teach us that the two prohibition of rounding head and mar beard are exclusively turned toward men and do not concern women. </li>\n<li>So Rav Huna said that an adult man who round the corners of the head of a child is guilty because of the rounding prohibition which is independent, despit that the rounded is not guilty (a child is never guilty).</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><h2>Here is a snippet of the Tosfot. containing your question (but concerning rounding head which is equivalent to maring beard):</h2>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא''ת ולרב הונא דלא מקיש מקיף לניקף ואע''ג דניקף לאו בר חיובא הוא מיחייב מקיף אם כן <strong>המקיף את העובד כוכבים לחייב</strong> כמו המקיף לקטן ודוחק לחלק משום דקטן אתי לכלל חיוב דהשתא מיהא לאו בר חיובא הוא וטעמא דרב הונא לא תלי בהכי אלא משום דלא מקיש מקיף לניקף ונראה להר''ף דיש לומר הואיל וכתיב פאת ראשכם אישראל קאי קרא ולא אעובד כוכבים וצ''ע במקיף את האשה אי מחייב כמו בקטן לרב הונא:</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rav Huna {Tosfot and Poskim follow the opinion of Rav Huna}, who doesn't make equivalence between rounder and rounded, and despite that the rounded is not concerned by the prohibition, the rounder is guilty, so, the one which rounds a non-Jew need to be guilty. </p>\n  \n  <p>A non convincing answer is to say that a child is not concerned but will be concerned by the prohibition when he will grow up. This answer is not valuable because Rav Huna is reasoning about the present situation (child = non-Jew). </p>\n  \n  <p>Rabenu Perets answered that the verse \"The side of your heads\" is refering to Jewish people only and does not concern non-Jews. But reflection is needed concerning the case of a man who rounds a woman according to Rav Huna.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>To explain this we should know a couple of sentences from Rav Huna, we will show them following the view of the above cited Tosfot.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רב הונא, המקיף את הקטן הרי הוא חייב. ‏\n  R'Huna said: One who rounds [the head of] a minor is guilty.</p>\n  \n  <p>רב הונא סבר: (ויקרא יט) לא תקיפו פאת ראשכם ולא תשחית [את] פאת זקנך - כל שיש לו השחתה יש לו הקפה, והני נשי הואיל וליתנהו בהשחתה ליתנהו נמי בהקפה\n  R'Huna holds that [the verse,] Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt thou mar the corners of thy beard, [signifies] that to whomsoever marring is applicable, rounding is applicable, and since marring does not apply to women, rounding, too, does not apply to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But a woman who rounds a child is not guilty because women are excluded from the prohibition of shaving beard, and who is excluded from shaving beard prohibition is excluded from the two rounding head prohibitions.</p>\n\n<p>So a Jewish man who is not excluded from the beard shaving prohibition remain always guilty for rounding prohibition, no matter with who. He is prohibited to shave a woman or a non Jew. But in conclusion Tosfot explains that the verse of rounding describe only situation inside Jewish population and a situation between a Jewish barber and a gentile client is not included. </p>\n\n<p>All this is for rounding, but for beard also it seems equivalent, because of the comparison between the two.</p>\n\n<p>3 .From this Tosfot, it can be answered that <strong>a Jewish Barber is permitted to use a razor to shave a gentile customer's face.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

The Rov was strongly opposed to mixing Israel with Vietnam. At the beginning of <em>shiur</em> one say, he had that boy summoned into  his classroom on the fourth floor of Furst Hall. The boy came in wearing jeans and sandals, sporting long hair and a scraggly beard. The Rov told him that he had until the end of <em>shiur</em> to change the flyers by deleting Israel from them. The boy dutifully complied. Toward the end of the day’s <em>shiur</em> he returned to show the Rov the new flyer. Satisfied, the Rov complimented the young man and told him that he had acted like a real <em>ben Torah</em> [literally, “child of the Torah”; a learned person]. The class erupted in laughter.</p>\n<p>Later the Rov mentioned to me that he was quite upset with the students in the <em>shiur</em> for laughing. “I know why they laughed,” he said. “But who says that short hair and a clean-shaven face are what the Torah wanted?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As other people have mentioned in the comments:</p>\n\n<p>Nazirites had to have long hair as part of their vow.

More broadly, do they have unique a mesorah for Pesach kashrus?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>According to Dr. Yosi Ziv, <em>Festival and Holiday in the Ethiopian Jewish Tradition of Beta Israel</em> [Hebrew], pp. 60-62, Beta Yisrael in Ethiopia did not have any prohibition of kitniyot on Pesach. In fact, they sometimes mixed legume flour (typically from ground chickpeas, peas, lentils or corn) to keep matzah dough from rising.</p>\n<p>Given that most Ethiopian Jews nowadays follow Sephardic customs, presumably they still do not observe such a prohibition. Possibly - though I have not verified this - the few Ethiopian Jews that follow Ashkenazi customs do observe such a prohibition.</p>\n<p>What was prohibited, other than leavened bread, were local Ethiopian beer (<em>tela</em>) and wine, both considered Chametz. Instead, the Jews often drank <em>buna</em>, a kind of local coffee made from safflower or black sesame seeds, as well as a beverage made from flaxseeds, water and honey (Ziv, ibid., p. 60).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In addition to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/147332/2394\">Harel13's excellent answer</a>, it ought be noted that while the Beta Israel never accepted a prohibition against consuming qitniyoth during Pesah, their idea of what types of foods are subject to himus (leavening/fermenting) was far more expansive than that of Rabbinic Judaism, which restricts it to the five species of grains. Their practice in this regard more closely resembled that of the Karaites or Samaritans. Anything perceived to have been leavened/fermented (including yogurts/leben, alcohols, etc.) would have been understood as forbidden.</p>\n<p>This approach also has implications for the fulfilment (or lack thereof) of the miswah of eating massah. Though the Beta Israel typically utilized wheat to make massoth (which they called <em>qitta</em> ቂጣ) there were times where they just as well would have used flour of a different species such as teff, corn, chickpeas, etc. which Rabbinic Judaism does not recognize as fit to fulfill the miswah of eating massah.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, as a part of the process of bringing them (back) into the fold of Rabbinic Judaism the Beta Israel are today encouraged to only utilize massoth made from the flour of one of the five species. And though they now accept that they are permitted to consume items outside of the five species even if it has undergone some type of leavening/fermenting, some as a matter of custom and deference to their ancestral traditions continue to refrain from such items on Pesah (this is akin to the Ashkenazi custom of refraining from qitniyoth).</p>\n<p>All of the above summarizes what I have gleaned from R. Menahem Waldman's Ethiopian Jews and their Heritage (Hamess wu-Massah, pp. 216-221). Below are images from Haggadath Itiyopia, p. 15 and 28 portraying massah and its production among the Beta Israel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/53cMnArH.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/53cMnArH.jpg\" alt=\"Haggadath Itiyopia, p. 15\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JpTIPs62.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JpTIPs62.jpg\" alt=\"Haggadath Itiyopia, p. 28\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

The positions generally discussed are: (1) to perform havdalah immediately after Shabbat but to give the wine to a minor; (2) to omit havdalah; (3) to perform havdalah the following night. \nThe actual halachah has been determined by the Sages according to opinion (3). </p>\n\n<p>I expected a fourth opinion to be part of this discussion, which is reciting the havdalah formula immediately after Shabbat but without a cup of wine (or another drink). According to this option only the blessing over the flame would be recited, followed by the havdalah formula (the blessings over wine and flagrances being omitted). In my opinion the reason for this fourth possibility lies in the fact that the havdalah formula doesn’t itself mention a cup of wine or in any way refer to it. Thus there seems to be no inherent necessity to recite this formula exclusively over a filled cup. So why can it not be recited “dry”? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mitzvah of Havdalah, as brought down in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17408/9682\">Brachoss 33a</a>, is to make it on a cup. So if we're going to do anything to get around the Nine Days issue, it's not going to be something that completely nullifies the mitzvah of Havdalah. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>After a survey of the topic in Poskim, I think that the best way to approach the question  is to focus on Baal Halachot Gedolot and Ramban (in the book <em>Torat Haadam</em> of Ramban) opinions .</p>\n\n<p>1.<strong>The BHG examined a first possibility: to make Havdala on a wine cup before the sundown</strong>. This possibility was based on two halachot: </p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>Gemara clearly allows (Brachot 27b) <em>to make Havdala on a cup before the end of Shabbat</em>, (See SA <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1497\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 293,3</a>)</p></li>\n<li><p>Shabbat afternoon  before the sundown: <em>The fast has not yet started</em>.</p></li>\n<li><p>BHG excluded this possibility because that <em>by the Birkat Havdala itself, the fast already started</em> and he would not be able to  drink the cup.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>BHG concluded that the right way is to make Havdala in Tefila and to wait until the end of the fast to  make Havdala with a cup as someone who had no wine until Sunday</strong>. (based on Gemara Pesachim 107a <em>\"He who did not recite habdalah at the termination of the Sabbath proceeds to recite habdalah and time during the week (Rashi: until Wednesday).</em>\")</p></li>\n<li><p>Ramban handles this issue differently  because that on this specific motsa'e Shabbat,  Havdala on a cup is not only \"technically impossible\"  but also \"totally canceled\"  by Chachamim. So the Havdala is totally canceled. It is not only a lack of opportunity as it is e. g. the case for someone who has no wine. (See Rishonim Nazir 3a, Psachim 106a). How is it canceled? </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>We have  a Mitsva of Havdala, some Rishonim see it as a Scriptural mitsva , others as a  rabbinical mitsva. The format  of this mitsva was stated in two ritual additions placed one in Tefila and one on  a cup. nothing else. </p>\n\n<p>This is illustrated by their different lectures of the Gemara <strong>Brachot 33a-b</strong>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R'Shaman B'Abba said to R'Johanan: Let us see: It was <strong>the Men of the Great Synagogue who instituted</strong> for Israel blessings and prayers, <strong>sanctifications (Kiddsh) and habdalahs (Havdala)</strong>. Let us see where they inserted them! - </p>\n  \n  <ol>\n  <li>He replied: __At first they inserted it [the habdalah] in the Tefillah: </li>\n  <li>when they [Israel] became richer, they instituted that it should be said over the cup [of wine] </li>\n  <li>when they became poor again they again inserted it in the Tefillah__; </li>\n  <li>and they said that one who has said habdalah in the Tefillah must say it [again] over the cup [of wine].... </li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <p>Rabina said to Raba: What is the law? He replied to him: The same as in the case of sanctification (Kiddush) . Just as the sanctification, although it has been said in the Tefillah, is also said over the cup [of wine], so habdalah, although it has been said in the Tefillah, is also to be said over the cup [of wine]. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Some Rishonim read it literally, havdala is a mitsva deorayta as kiddush,  some else do not. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, following the BHG, the particular situation of  motsa'e Shabbat at  Tish'a Beav is as if Jews became poor, and according to Ramban it is not.</p>\n\n<p>Anshey Kneset Hagedola established  only 2 manners to make Havdala: in  Tefila and on cup. To make Beracha of havdala without cup is possible and outside of the Tefila is not an option.  But without pronouncing the  name of G-d it is possible. </p>\n\n<p>An important detail of the suggia in Brachot is that you can and need to  make tefila and then make a second havdala on a cup and there is problem of unnecessary bracha.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>SUMMARY</h2>\n\n<p>In this answer we learned <strong><em>6 rules</em></strong>: <strong><em>1.-</em></strong> for Havdala the first takana was to mention the end of Shabbat in tefila, and further to mention it also on a cup; <strong><em>2.-</em></strong> It is possible in special situation (Oness), to make havdala in tefila or on a cup before the end of Shabbat; <strong><em>3.-</em></strong> one who did not recite Havdala Motsa'e shabbat can recite further (on a cup); <strong><em>4.-</em></strong> If motsa'e Shabbat falls on 9 av or 10 av, the view of Ramban is that there is no Takana from Anshe Knesset Hagedola to recite havdala on a cup of wine, so he recite in tefila only and if he did not, he needs to pray a second time in way to recite havdala; <strong><em>5.-</em></strong> According to BHG, the takana to recite on a cup remains, the situation is as if he has no wine and knows that wine will come tomorrow. He will recite on wine after the fast. If he did not recite on tefila, he can wait the havdala with cup of tomorrow. <strong><em>6.-</em></strong> We must be aware of 2 rules, the first: to make havdala, according to some Rishonim, as Rambam, is a scriptural mitsva, according to other a rabbinical mitsva; the second how to make this,  in tefila or on a cup ceremonial with special blessing with name of god and kindom mention. To say simply hamavdil is a mitsva but does  not fulfill the takana.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>For purposes of Brevity, I will refrain explanations on Gemara and Tosfot. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Your question presuppose that, out of the havdala in Tefilat Haamida, there is a possibility to make Havdala without wine,</strong>  as for instance, following some Geonim and Rishonim opinion, the blessings of  Brit Mila on Yom Kippur or 9 beav are said without wine cup, or the Shehecheyanu of Yom Kippur is without wine. </p>\n\n<p>See accurately the words of the Rambam Zmanim, Shabbat, Chapter 29. </p>\n\n<p>The mitsva of Havdala  itself is a mitsva MideOrayta following the Rambam opinion:\nHalacha 1:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א  <strong>מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה מִן הַתּוֹרָה</strong>  לְקַדֵּשׁ [א] אֶת יוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת בִּדְבָרִים שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות כ-ח) 'זָכוֹר אֶת יוֹם הַשַּׁבָּת לְקַדְּשׁוֹ'. כְּלוֹמַר זָכְרֵהוּ זְכִירַת שֶׁבַח וְקִדּוּשׁ. וְצָרִיךְ לְזָכְרֵהוּ <strong>בִּכְנִיסָתוֹ וּבִיצִיאָתוֹ</strong>. בִּכְנִיסָתוֹ בְּקִדּוּשׁ הַיּוֹם וּבִיצִיאָתוֹ בְּהַבְדָּלָה: ‏ </p>\n  \n  <p>short and loose  translation: To remember the Shabbat, by words, at its starting time  (Kiddush) and its ending time (Havdala). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Halacha 6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ו __ מִדִּבְרֵי  __סוֹפְרִים [ז] לְקַדֵּשׁ עַל הַיַּיִן</strong> וּלְהַבְדִּיל עַל הַיַּיִן. וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהִבְדִּיל בַּתְּפִלָּה צָרִיךְ לְהַבְדִּיל עַל הַכּוֹס. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Rabbinically</strong> we need to make <strong>Kiddush on wine and Havdala on wine</strong>. And even though he already made Havdala in prayer (Ata Chonantanu in Amida), he needs to make Havdala on a cup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, there is a Scriptural Mitsva of Kiddush and Havdala, which can be accomplished without wine. And Rabbinically, we need to make it with a cup  of wine. And even if the mitsva was already made without wine, e.g. Havdala in Tefila, the rabbinical requirement   to make it on wine is not fulfilled , to do this we need  a second Havdala.</p>\n\n<p>From the words of the Rambam, we can infer that the unique reason to make Havdala after the Havdala of the Tefila is the cup  of wine. Thus,  if someone already made Havdala in Tefila, he needs to make a second Havdala only with a cup of wine, so Poskim discussed if Tinok or Motsae 9 beAv, and for reasons of right education of children (\"lemisrach\"), the choice is to make Havdala after 9 beAv.</p>\n\n<p>But the a question remains not solved:  If someone  forgot to say  Havdala in Tefila. See Tur Siman 294 said something in name of Rabenu Yona, and further we will learn something about  this last  question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב הרבינו יונה אף אם אין לו כוס בלילה וסבר שיהיה לו למחר (כוס יין) אין צריך לחזור ולהתפלל אלא אם כן סבור שאף למחר לא יהיה לו ולפי זה אף בתשעה באב שחל באחד בשבת אם טעה ולא הבדיל בתפילה אין צריך לחזור ולהתפלל כיון שמבדיל על הכוס במוצאי תשעה באב. ‏\n  Rabbenu Yona wrote that if someone failed to say Havdala in Tefila and  has no wine at home, if he believes to get wine tomorrow, no need to  pray a second time for the Havdala part of the Tefila. ___And accordingly to this,  if,  when 9 Beav starts motsae Shabbat, one  did forget  Havdala in tefila of Maariv, there is no need to pray Maariv again, because of the intent to  do  Havdala after 9 beav.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You see that the importance of the wine in the Havdala is enough for wait the time of havdala. In other words, <strong>The Takana is DAVKA to make havdala on wine, not as brachot of Brit mila.</strong> without wine there is havdala in Tefila only.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Optional. </p>\n\n<p>next step. A Nazir with Havdala. </p>\n\n<p>Following some Rishonim, even Nazir itself need to drink wine Kiddush and Havdala, but we rule as Rabenu Tam and the Rambam above that wine for K&H is derabanan. May be that Nazir need to find a Chamar Medina. </p>\n\n<p>It seems that everyone who knows that he will not find wine and does not hearing from another need to pray Amida a second time with Havdala.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why would Pharaoh's heart be made כבד by G-D?",
    "content": "# Why would Pharaoh's heart be made כבד by G-D?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've always loved the account of the 10 plagues (who doesn't?), but I always felt a little odd about the several times (7, in fact) Pharoah's heart was made \"hard/heavy\" by G-d because I'm a strong believer in free-will, and that didn't seem fair/just to me. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that Pharaoh was a good guy -- he was given plenty of chances, and time and time again, he was stubborn and did not obey G-d, but this makes it all the more peculiar to me. Why would G-d need to make Pharaoh's heart heavy if it already was? </p>\n\n<p>For years, I just accepted Maimonides comments in the Laws of Teshuva: \"yes, there is free will... but if your sins become colossal, grievous, frequent, etc. enough, then the courtesy of free-will will be revoked\" (I'm, of course, paraphrasing here). It wasn't the perfect answer, but I accepted it because \"hey, Pharaoh, was indeed a bad guy. It probably would have happened anyway, and Maimonides knows what's up.\" </p>\n\n<p>But lately, I've been working with an Egyptologist, help teaching an Egyptology course to undergraduates, and new ideas have occurred to me. Now, I work at a public  university so for the most part, we were looking at it from an Egyptian point of view, and a light bulb went off in my head. <strong>Was the 10 plagues a symbolic \"show-down\" (in addition to physical miracles leading to the redemption of the Hebrews) between the Egyptian pantheon and G-d?</strong> In antiquity, Egypt was well known as a polytheistic nation, with more than 80 deities being worshipped throughout the land. Even pharaoh was considered to be a god, along with a host of insects, reptiles, mammals, fish, the sun, and so forth. Could each plague  actually be a personal attack against one of the Egyptian gods? </p>\n\n<p>For example (choosing just a few):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Plague 1--water turned to blood: The Nile was the lifeblood for the\nEgyptians and a prominent god was Hapi -- this would be a direct\nattack against Hapi.</li>\n<li>Plague 5--disease of livestock: Hathor, Cow\ngoddess and fertility, was not able to keep her livestock alive. Her\npowers proved fruitless. </li>\n<li>Plague 9--darkness: Attack against the sun\ngod of Ra. His powers were clearly overshadowed by G-d's.</li>\n<li>Plague 10--death of first-born: Pharaoh (who was considered divine) is\nunable to save his own child from death's grasps, demonstrating that\nthere is only one true divine Being.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Now G-d and the Israelite would know that these so called \"gods\" were not real, but could it be a symbolic attack on (as well as demonstrating G-d's gradneur and commitment to His people) the Egyptian Pantheon, accentuating His power over their hierarchy of gods? </p>\n\n<p>Now with that said, going with this premise, <em>could one make the argument that <strong>G-d made Pharoah's heart harden/heavy because it would be the apex of a symbolic battle between G-d and Pharoah since the Egyptians believed that in the Afterworld, the heart would be weighed against a feather, and if the heart was heavier than the feather, it would be gobbled up by creatures literally known as the \"gobblers\", sealing Pharoah's fate in the Underworld, and ultimately emphasizing that there is but one G-d.</em></strong> </p>\n\n<p>I'm not saying that this whole account be taken symbolically because I think it can <strong>operate on two levels: physical and symbolic.</strong> So maybe Pharoah's heart became hardened on his own (as we read he does), but the parts where it mentions G-d making it hard, indicates the symbolic aspects? Does that make sense? Is there room for interpretation here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadiah Seforno (on Shemos 9:35) suggests that Hashem \"made his heart heavy\" (heavy objects are hard to move) and \"made his heart strong\" (more literal translations of \"הכבדתי\" and \"חזקתי\" then \"hardened) in order to <strong>preserve</strong> Par'oh's free will!</p>\n\n<p>Had Hashem allowed Par’oh\nto be influenced by the miracles then\nPar’oh’s decisions would have been\naltered through supernatural means.\nTherefore, Hashem removed Par’oh’s\nability to be moved by the miraculous\nevents he witnessed. The means for\ndoing so, this “<em>hichbadti</em>”, the immobilization,\nwas to blind him to the\nawe, the <em>yir’as Hashem</em>, that the\nplagues would normally cause.</p>\n\n<p>In comparison (my comparison, not the Seforno's), there is a famous\nstory of Rav Chanina ben Dosa (Taanis 25a), a\nmiracle working Tanna who was so\npoor that he lived off a single carob\nfrom Shabbos to Shabbos. One week his daughter filled the Shabbos lights\nwith vinegar rather than oil. She was\ndistressed by this mistake, perhaps\nbecause of their inability to afford\nwasted oil or vinegar. Rav Chanina\nanswered her, “He Who made oil\nburn can make vinegar burn.” And the vinegar burned. Rav Chanina witnessed\nmiracles because they would\nnot violate his free will. He saw in the\nsupernatural burning of vinegar no\nmore proof of G-d’s existence than he\nsaw everyday within nature.</p>\n\n<p>Miracles are normally only witnessed by those who already believe so strongly, that the miracle doesn't convince them of anything they don't already believe. Chanina ben Dosa's oil burned <strong>because</strong> to him it was no more startling than oil burning. Until the plague of <em>shechin</em> (boils), the his court magicians could duplicate the miracles well enough that the miracles didn't prove anything to Par'oh. And notice that it's Par'oh's own stubbornness exclusively until the plague of <em>shechin</em> took down his magicians. The Exodus required exposing Par'oh to miracles despite his own belief and awe not being anywhere near that level. There are no longer a balance of good and evil in his experience, and the subsequent plagues served as proof of G-d. Miracles, so supernatural proof of G-d. A tampering with free will.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore G-d made his hear unresponsive to this evidence, having him act exactly as he would if his experience was in accord with nature.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In contrast, Maimonides (Laws of Teshuvah 6:3) says that indeed there are sins whose punishment includes the loss of free will.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I understand the culpability question in this case akin to that of someone who does something while drunk that they never would have planned to do back when they were sober; they didn't make the decision while of sound mind, but it was their decision to get to an unsound one.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for the Egyptology; I don't know enough to comment. But R' Hirsch understands the blood and frogs just as you suggest -- symbols of death and of Hapti (and thus birth) in the Nile would be clear to the Egyptians as a message about drowning the Jewish babies in the same Nile</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Related question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12200/did-hardening-paros-heart-mean-he-wasnt-really-responsible?rq=1\">Did hardening Paro's heart mean he wasn't really responsible?</a></p>\n\n<p>There are a number of answers based on the different usages. For example, the Rambam brings up the point that Par'o sinned to such an extent that his punishment was to be unable to do teshuvah.

In each case, it was Par'o who hardened his heart, Hashem just gave him the strength to make a decision of his own free will.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869#v=11&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 8:11</a> Rav Hirsch translates</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יא וַיַּרְא פַּרְעֹה כִּי הָיְתָה הָרְוָחָה וְהַכְבֵּד אֶת לִבּוֹ\n  וְלֹא שָׁמַע אֲלֵהֶם כַּאֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר יְהֹוָה:</p>\n  \n  <p>But when Pharoah saw that there was respite, his heart became stubborn\n  again and he hearkened not unto them; as Hashem had foretold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>he hardened hisheart</strong>: Heb. וְהַכְבֵּד. It is the infinitive form,\n  like “continually traveling” (הָלוֹ וְנָסוֹעַ) (Gen. 12:9); “and\n  similarly, and slew (וְהַכּוֹת) the Moabites” (II Kings 3:24); “and by\n  inquiring (וְשָׁאוֹל) of God on his behalf” (I Sam. 22:13); “striking\n  and wounding (הכֵּה וּפָצֹעַ)” (I Kings 20:37).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That it, it was the natural tendency of his will reacting to the apparent relief.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869#v=15&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 8:15</a> translates</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>טו וַיֹּאמְרוּ הַחַרְטֻמִּם אֶל פַּרְעֹה אֶצְבַּע אֱלֹהִים הִוא\n  וַיֶּחֱזַק לֵב פַּרְעֹה וְלֹא שָׁמַע אֲלֵהֶם כַּאֲשֶׁר דִּבֶּר\n  יְהֹוָה:</p>\n  \n  <p>15 So the necromancers said to Pharaoh, \"It is the finger of God,\" but\n  Pharaoh's heart remained steadfast, and he did not hearken to them, as\n  the Lord had spoken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As we see, he continued strong and did not have his will shaken.</p>\n\n<p>However, by <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869#v=28&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 8:28</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כח וַיַּכְבֵּד פַּרְעֹה אֶת לִבּוֹ גַּם בַּפַּעַם הַזֹּאת וְלֹא\n  שִׁלַּח אֶת הָעָם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But this time too, Pharoah <strong>made his heart stubborn</strong> and he did not\n  let the people go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here we see that Par'o exerts his free will to overcome the pressure that he feels in order to refuse to bow to the force of the plagues. This was the exertion of his strength of will to overcome the <em>weakness</em> caused by the suffering of the plague.</p>\n\n<p>We see the increasing pressure with the term used in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9870/jewish/Chapter-9.htm#v=12&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 9:11</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יב וַיְחַזֵּק יְהֹוָה אֶת לֵב פַּרְעֹה וְלֹא שָׁמַע אֲלֵהֶם כַּאֲשֶׁר\n  דִּבֶּר יְהֹוָה אֶל משֶׁה:</p>\n  \n  <p>12 But the Lord strengthened Pharaoh's heart, and he did not hearken\n  to them, as the Lord spoke to Moses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, Rav Hirsch translates this as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But Hashem <strong>allowed</strong> the heart of Par'o to <strong>remain strong</strong> and he\n  hearkened not unto them, as Hashem had told Moshe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, Hashem allowed Par'o to maintain the strength of will to continue to follow the path that he had previously determined <strong>for himself</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9870/jewish/Chapter-9.htm#v=34&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 9:34</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לד וַיַּרְא פַּרְעֹה כִּי חָדַל הַמָּטָר וְהַבָּרָד וְהַקֹּלֹת\n  וַיֹּסֶף לַחֲטֹא וַיַּכְבֵּד לִבּוֹ הוּא וַעֲבָדָיו:</p>\n  \n  <p>34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain, the hail, and the thunder had\n  ceased; so he continued to sin, and he strengthened his heart, he and\n  his servants</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again it is a strengthening <strong>by Par'o</strong> of his previously determined will.</p>\n\n<p>As Rav Hirsch translates <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9871/jewish/Chapter-10.htm#showrashi=true&v=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 10:1</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי אֲנִי הִכְבַּדְתִּי אֶת לִבּוֹ</p>\n  \n  <p>for I have <strong>allowed</strong> his heart and the heart of his servants to\n  remain stubborn</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, everything that happened until now, was only because Hashem was allowing Par'o to maintain his strength and pursue the previously determined path <strong>of his own free will</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is only after the plague of locusts <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9871/jewish/Chapter-10.htm#showrashi=true&v=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 10:20</a> that Rav Hirsch translates </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כ וַיְחַזֵּק יְהֹוָה אֶת לֵב פַּרְעֹה וְלֹא שִׁלַּח אֶת בְּנֵי\n  יִשְׂרָאֵל:</p>\n  \n  <p>20 Thereby Hashem <strong>made</strong> Pharoah's heart stubborn again and he did\n  not let the Children of Israel go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, because Par'o was faced with the possibility that Egypt would be destroyed in the future (if the locusts had been able to breed and lay eggs), he would have succumbed, not to the recognition that they should go free, but to the power of the plagues, Hashem had to act to strengthen his heart to be able to make a free will decision.</p>\n\n<p>After the Choshech, Rav Hirsch again translates <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9871/jewish/Chapter-10.htm#showrashi=true&v=27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmos 10:27</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כז וַיְחַזֵּק יְהֹוָה אֶת לֵב פַּרְעֹה וְלֹא אָבָה לְשַׁלְּחָם:</p>\n  \n  <p>But Hashem <strong>let</strong> Pharoah's heart be stubborn and he was not willing\n  to let them go.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Again we see that Hashem allows Par'o the strength to maintain his (free-will) decision which he had previously made. Thus we see that it was Par'o who hardened his heart and Hashem gave him the strength to make a free will decision. Had he freely used that strength to let them go, he would have been able to avoid the plagues.</p>\n\n\n",

Boaz is an expression of strength, and in this context how G-d provides the person with the right level of strength and fortitude such as - \"ה' עז לעמו יתן\" - \"May Hashem give strength to His people.\"</p>\n<p>In addition, the Chida in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.7.21?lang=bi&p2=Chomat_Anakh_on_I_Kings.7.21.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chomas Anach</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויקם את עמוד ויקרא שמו יכין. אפשר שכיוין נגד אבא למלכא דוד הע\"ה אשר הכין הרבה כסף וזהב לבנין בה\"מ וזהו הנראה לעין אך עיקר הכונה שטרח מאד בשירותיו ליחד הדודים ולתקן הנצח כמ\"ש במ\"א והוא המכין הכל ובא שלמה ומצא הכל מתוקן ולכן עמוד הימני הרומז לנצח קרא יכין נגד דוד הע\"ה שהוא הכין ותקן הנצח. ועמוד השמאלי נגד ראש הממשלה בעז שטרח להוציא ניצוצי הקדושה ממואב ובו עז וגבורה. ושלט בו מדה\"ד ומת באותו לילה. א\"נ רמז יכין שהאדם יכין צידה לדרכו תמיד בעז שהכל ע\"י התורה הנקראת עז וינצח יצה\"ר צד שמאל ע\"י התורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary, the pillar called Yachin was possibly intended to correspond to his father, Dovid Hamelech, who <strong>prepared</strong> much silver and gold for the Temple and took great pains to ensure the longevity of the Temple. Thus it was called 'Yachin' - 'He prepared' as a reference to efforts that Dovid went to, to ensure the Temple would be enduring.

Can someone quote me a single verse in the Torah where it is clearly stated that one's mother has to be a Jew if one claims to be a Jew otherwise that person cannot convert to Judaism.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>By Torah, I assume you mean to include Tanach more generally (as it is contrasted with the Mishna and Talmud).</p>\n<p>In that case, Ezra 10:2-3 is pretty explicit. Josh Waxman elaborates on that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/6705/440\">here</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ב</strong> וַיַּעַן שְׁכַנְיָה בֶן-יְחִיאֵל מִבְּנֵי עולם (עֵילָם), וַיֹּאמֶר לְעֶזְרָא--אֲנַחְנוּ מָעַלְנוּ בֵאלֹהֵינוּ, וַנֹּשֶׁב נָשִׁים נָכְרִיּוֹת מֵעַמֵּי הָאָרֶץ; וְעַתָּה יֵשׁ-מִקְוֶה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל, עַל-זֹאת</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> And Shecaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answered and said unto Ezra: 'We have broken faith with our God, and have married foreign women of the peoples of the land; yet now there is hope for Israel concerning this thing.</p>\n<p><strong>ג</strong> וְעַתָּה נִכְרָת-בְּרִית לֵאלֹהֵינוּ לְהוֹצִיא כָל-נָשִׁים וְהַנּוֹלָד מֵהֶם, בַּעֲצַת אֲדֹנָי, וְהַחֲרֵדִים, בְּמִצְוַת אֱלֹהֵינוּ; וְכַתּוֹרָה, יֵעָשֶׂה</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away <strong>all the wives, and such as are born of them</strong>, according to the counsel of the LORD, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would also point out that the technically correct statement about the Torah (the 5 books) is that it doesn't make an explicit statement either way, thus we are left to derivations from verses, so any claim about the status of someone with only one parent who is Jewish would be subject to the same challenge.</p>\n<p>However, straying from the Halachic interpretation of the verses, I would also point you to Leviticus 24:10-23, where we have someone who has a non-Jewish father and is treated as a Jew. Now the Rabbis have a problem with such a reading because in Halacha matrilineal decent only started with the giving of the Torah and thus read the passage as this person was more of a convert, like other Egyptians who joined the Jews when they left Egypt, and that does fit in the passage as a whole. But absent that problem, a straight forward reading is that his mother's Jewish status was sufficient to regard him as a Jew.</p>\n<p>In regards to the final comment \"otherwise that person cannot convert to Judaism\" Judaism does not believe that. Conversion is a basic part of Judaism, and if one is not Jewish by birth (by having a Jewish mother) then one can convert. The passage I quoted from Leviticus is just one among many that speaks about the convert.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First see Talmud Bavli Yebamot 17a (which examined the source in Torah):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"your son\"(13) implies that he who is descended from an Israelitish woman may be called thy son, but thy son <strong>who is descended from a heathen woman is not called your son but her son</strong>.(14) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(13) Deuteronomy VII, \"For they will turn away <strong>your son</strong> from following me, that they may serve other gods; so will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and destroy you speedily.\"\n  (14) I.e., is regarded as a perfect heathen and his betrothal has no validity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

You are bringing a couple factors of seeming blatant contradiction. I believe that may not be the case. On the most stringent level, דאורייתא, a person has to 'honor' the parent, and a man must provide for his wife.</p>\n\n<p>Aruch HaShulchan סימן רמ סעיף א:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיבוד אב ואם ומוראם המה מצות עשה, שנאמר: \"כבד את אביך ואת אמך\", ונאמר: \"איש אמו ואביו תיראו\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Honoring one's parents and fearing them is a positive commandment\"</p>\n\n<p>Rambam Hilchus Ishus 12:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כְּשֶׁנּוֹשֵׂא אָדָם אִשָּׁה בֵּין בְּתוּלָה בֵּין בְּעוּלָה בֵּין גְּדוֹלָה בֵּין קְטַנָּה אַחַת בַּת יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאַחַת הַגִּיֹּרֶת אוֹ הַמְשֻׁחְרֶרֶת <strong>יִתְחַיֵּב לָהּ בַּעֲשָׂרָה דְּבָרִים</strong> וְיִזְכֶּה בְּאַרְבָּעָה דְּבָרִים:\n  וְהָעֲשָׂרָה <strong>שְׁלֹשָׁה מֵהֶן מִן הַתּוֹרָה</strong> וְאֵלּוּ הֵן. (שמות כא י) </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>\"שְׁאֵרָהּ. כְּסוּתָהּ. וְעוֹנָתָהּ\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"A man is obligated to give his wife three things from the Torah, as it says 'her sustenance, her clothing, her marital duty'.\"</p>\n\n<p>The precept of fearing and honoring ones parents is very strict indeed it says\n(Aruch Hashulchan סימן רמ סעיף טז)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד היכן מוראם? היה הבן לבוש חמודות ויושב בראש הקהל, ובאו אביו ואמו וקרעו בגדיו, והכוהו על ראשו וירקו בפניו – לא יכלים אותם, אלא ישתוק, ויירא ממלך מלכי המלכים שצוהו בכך. שאילו מלך בשר ודם היה גוזר עליו – לא היה לו לפרכס בדבר. קל וחומר ממלך מלכי המלכים הקדוש ברוך הוא. מיהו מותר לתובעו בדין על מה שקרע בגדיו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>--If one is in a high-up public position, and his parent came up to him and ripped his clothes [in public], or spit on him, he should not humiliate them, rather remain silent. Because the King Of All Kings has commanded him thusly, and if a human king were to decree such a decree, he would not be able to get out of it.  קל וחומר ממלך מלכי המלכים הקדוש ברוך הוא</p>\n\n<p>As a side note, it also says: \n(Aruch HaShulchan סימן רמ סעיף מד)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייב אדם לכבד חמיו וחמותו, שהרי דוד קרא לשאול \"אבי\" דכתיב (שמואל א כד יא): \"אבי ראה גם ראה\". כן כתבו הטור והשולחן ערוך סעיף כ\"ד.  ---</p>\n  \n  <p>וכתבו שאין הכוונה שחייב בכיבוד כבן, אלא לכבדו כשאר זקנים חשובים (ב\"ח וש\"ך סעיף קטן כ\"ב), ועיין מה שכתבתי בסעיף ל\"ה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>--A person is is obligated to honor his father and mother in-law. But they wrote this is an honor like that which a person displays towards any elderly person, not child-like honor.</p>\n\n<p>In similar fashion to your question's situation, the Aruch HaShulchan (סימן רמ סעיף לב) says if his parents has gone mad (נטרפה דעת) he should try to reason with them as per their current state, as to calm them down so they won't act so sporadical. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מי שנטרפה דעת אביו או אמו – משתדל לנהוג עמהם כפי דעתם עד שירוחם עליהם, כלומר שתתיישב דעתם. ואם אי אפשר לו לעמוד מפני שנשתנו ביותר, כתב הרמב\"ם שילך לו ויניחם, ויצוה לאחרים לנהגם כראוי. והשיג הראב\"ד דאם הוא ילך ויניחם, למי יצוה לשמרם? עד כאן לשונו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This may be related to what you describe as 'emotionally abusive'. Certainly, all the sources discuss this concept, and that it must be dealt with in the prescribed matter. And that one is not off the hook if it [נטרפה דעת] occurs, in one way or another. </p>\n\n<p>Getting back now to this concept of 'Shalom Bayis', it is indeed a nice concept. However, as regards a Biblical commandment, I would inject that only the three mentioned above (food, clothes, marital relations) are Biblically Shalom Bayis. As far as what <em>is</em> Rabbinical Shalom Bayis, that could be another discussion , especially because it seems the term is thrown around so very loosely. Should a Jewish couple not strive to follow the Torah? Meaning to say, certain things may precede others. Concerning precedence, which you seek, based on the information presented, I would personally conclude honoring and fearing the parents of authority here. </p>\n\n<p>Something else to consider, that a parent cannot command a child to transgress any law, even Rabbinical, because one cannot divert from the words of Torah Sages (Aruch HaShulchan סימן רמ סעיף לד).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דבר פשוט הוא שכיבוד אב ואם אינו דוחה שום מצוה. ולא מיבעיא אם אביו יצוה לו לעבור על דברי תורה ב\"קום ועשה\" או ב\"שב ואל תעשה\", דאסור לשמוע לו. כדתניא (בבא מציעא לב א): הרי שאמר לו אביו \"הטמא למת\" והוא כהן, או אל תחזיר אבידה – יכול ישמע לו? תלמוד לומר: \"איש אמו ואביו תראו... אני ה' אלקיכם\" – כולכם חייבים בכבודי. ואפילו יצוה לו לעבור על מצוה דרבנן אפילו ב\"שב ואל תעשה\", כגון שלא להדליק נר חנוכה וכיוצא בזה, דאסור לשמוע לו.</p>\n  \n  <p>ולא נחתינן בזה ל\"עשה דוחה לא תעשה\", או על כל פנים לדחות איסור דרבנן מפני מצות עשה דכיבוד, דכיון דהתורה גילתה דכל שהוא נגד התורה – אין לאביו רשות לצוות לבנו על זה. וממילא דגם באיסור דרבנן הוה נגד התורה, דהקדוש ברוך הוא צוה לבלי לסור מכל אשר חכמים יגידו. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Therefore, concerning the concern raised for this couple's children and negative effects being had on them should be a nonstarter. For, anything going against proper etiquette i.e. teachings of the Torah, the parent and thus certainly the child would not have to listen. And this is noted, that if the parent follows the Torah, the children will follow after. Meaning, this is not a guarantee, and one must work at it, but if the parent does not abide by the standard he yearns for his child, he is at fault, not his parent. Indeed it says: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">וְשִׁנַּנְתָּם לְבָנֶיךָ וְדִבַּרְתָּ בָּם בְּשִׁבְתְּךָ בְּבֵיתֶךָ וּבְלֶכְתְּךָ בַדֶּרֶךְ וּבְשָׁכְבְּךָ וּבְקוּמֶךָ׃</a></p>\n\n<p>To summarize, in the above scenario, the man is not transgressing any serious prohibitions in regards to his marriage. If he were to give in to his wife, however, he may very well be. And, as mentioned above, the husband and wife should strive to follow the Torah כהלכתה. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Well the way I see it if your mother is causing your wife and yourself tzar that's a issur. And you dont have to listen to your parents if they tell you to do a issur. And so they're telling you to do a aveirah (not stopping them from doing a aveirah). So you shouldn't have to invite your parents over since that would be a aveirah which kibbud av does not extend to. I'm good at loopholes😁. Also would kibbud av really go so far that you must suffer? According to this <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kibud_Av_V%27Em\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Kibud_Av_V%27Em</a> you don't have to suffer financially. EDIT What I mean is that just as you don't have to suffer financially you might not have to suffer emotionally. You'd have to look at the yalkut yosef for that. This is all just my own reasoning. CYLOR for a actual psak. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why six steps for Shmoneh Esreh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Orach Chaim Siman 123 Saif 2, SK 8, the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49623&st=&pgnum=286\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Berura</a> brings two opinions regarding the amount of steps needed before one has to say Kedusha. The Kesef Mishna holds that after one's three steps back at the end of Shmoneh Esreh, he can stand there and recite Kedusha there. The Mishna Berura then brings a Magen Avraham who says that there is an opinion that you need 6 steps and therefore one would have to walk forward to say Kedusha.</p>\n\n<p>My question is two part: 1) Where does this opinion of six steps come from? What's the reason for 6 steps before Kedusha? 2) Regarding that answer, would it follow that this whole discussion only follows an Amida that has Kedusha but a Maariv Amida would not have this six steps idea?</p>\n\n<p>Please cite sources.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>See Bet Yosef 123, 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כתב רבינ מנוח דהני שלש פסיעות ילפינן מדכתיב ורגליהם רגל ישרה, רגליהם תרי, רגל חד; ויש אומרים שש דהא כתיב בתריה וכף רגליהם ככף רגל עגל ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>we learn this from their legs (=2) leg (=1) their feets (=2) as a foot (=1) </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>this verse is in Merkava of Yechezkel (1, 7)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְרַגְלֵיהֶ֖ם רֶ֣גֶל יְשָׁרָ֑ה וְכַ֣ף רַגְלֵיהֶ֗ם כְּכַף֙ רֶ֣גֶל עֵ֔גֶל וְנֹ֣צְצִ֔ים כְּעֵ֖ין נְחֹ֥שֶׁת קָלָֽל׃ ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>concerning Chayot Hakodesh</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>The Kedusha is from Yesha'ia 6, 3:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ב שְׂרָפִ֨ים עֹמְדִ֤ים ׀ מִמַּ֙עַל֙ ל֔וֹ שֵׁ֧שׁ כְּנָפַ֛יִם שֵׁ֥שׁ כְּנָפַ֖יִם לְאֶחָ֑ד בִּשְׁתַּ֣יִם ׀ יְכַסֶּ֣ה פָנָ֗יו וּבִשְׁתַּ֛יִם יְכַסֶּ֥ה רַגְלָ֖יו וּבִשְׁתַּ֥יִם יְעוֹפֵֽף׃ ג ג וְקָרָ֨א זֶ֤ה אֶל־זֶה֙ וְאָמַ֔ר קָד֧וֹשׁ ׀ קָד֛וֹשׁ קָד֖וֹשׁ יְהֹוָ֣ה צְבָא֑וֹת מְלֹ֥א כׇל־הָאָ֖רֶץ כְּבוֹדֽוֹ׃  ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>concerning Serafim.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>I seems effectively that the next 3 are not linked to a Tefila without Kedusha (Maariv, Yechidut). For yachid Bet Yosef at the end of siman 123 does not mention the 6 steps. The first 3 step are the only mentionned in Gemara by Rav Alexandri in name of Rabbi Yehoshua Ben Levi (Yoma 53b) and is linked to \"Ose Shalom...\"</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R'Alexandri said in the name of R'Joshua B'Levi: One who prays the 'Amidah should go three steps backwards, and then recite 'peace'. </p>\n</blockquote></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Aruch HaShulchan writes in 123:3 </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ובמקום שכלו השלוש פסיעות – יעמוד שם ולא יחזור תיכף למקומו. ואם עשה כן\n  – נוח לו שלא התפלל כלל. ובגמרא אמרו על זה שהוא ככלב שב על קיאו (יומא\n  נג ב), שהרי נפטר מרבו, ועתה נראה שחוזר בו ממה שהתפלל ובקש סליחה\n  ומחילה, ורוצה לחטוא עוד (ב\"ח). <strong>ולכן לא יחזור למקומו עד שיגיע שליח\n  ציבור לקדושה, דבזה הכל רואים שחוזר למקומו מפני הקדושה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, one should not go back to his place until the Shaliach Tzibbur gets to Kedusha for then everyone sees he is going back to his place for Kedusha</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems from here that walking steps forward is linked to Kedusha. </p>\n\n<p>In Aruch HaShulchan 123:4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש נוהגים להקפיד שבפסעו הפסיעות – לא יעבור אדם בינו לבין מקום שהתפלל. וטעם הדבר: מפני שיש אומרים דצריך ששה פסיעות, משום ד\"פסיעה\" לא מקרי רק כשעוקר שני רגליו. וכן נהגו חכמי צרפת. ויש להם סמך, מדכתיב בתחילת יחזקאל בחיות שבמרכבה: \"ורגליהם רגל ישרה\", \"רגליהם\" – תרי, \"רגל\" – חד, הוי שלוש. ואחר כך כתיב: \"וכף רגליהם ככף רגל...\" – הוי גם כן תלת. <strong>ולכן חושבים השלוש פסיעות שחוזר למקומו בעת הקדושה לצירוף השלוש ראשונו</strong>ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here too, it seems to follow that three steps forward is linked only to Kedusha. Therefore, when there is no Kedusha, like Maariv, one would not have to walk three steps forward after Shmoneh Esreh</p>\n\n\n",

I understand that correct pronunciation of the Torah is key, but deaf people are not necessarily mute. Why were they singled out (in regards to the Scroll during Purim)?</p>\n\n<p>It seems sad to deny someone the blessings of reciting Scroll/Torah because of a physical disability that they didn't choose, and when they have alternative ways of reciting Scroll/Torah.

To shed light on Rabbi Karo's specific meaning in this case, see his commentary on Maimonides' (12th century) legal codes (<em>Kesef Mishne</em>, <em>Hil. Ishus</em> 10:16, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=82923&rid=3056\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew link</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Maimonides:] If someone gives his minor daughter to be betrothed, and her groom demands to finalize the marriage, she and her father are each able to prevent the marriage until she grows up and becomes a <em>na'ara</em> maiden.<sup>1</sup> If he<sup>2</sup> wants her to be married, he can marry her off, but it is not appropriate to do this.</p>\n<p>[Rabbi Karo:] It appears that our rabbi [i.e., Maimonides] inferred from that which it says in the Talmud (<em>Kiddushin</em> 41) that \"it is forbidden for a person to marry off his daughter when she is a minor,\" that \"forbidden\" was meant non-literally. Rather, the Talmud means that it is inappropriate to do so. This interpretation is consistent with the <em>baraisa</em> (<em>K'subos</em> 57b): \"She and her father can each prevent the wedding.\" This implies that if both she and her father are willing, it is [technically] permitted. Maimonides<sup>3</sup> also wrote this in Chapter 3: \"Even though a father is permitted to marry off his daughter when she is a minor or a <em>na'ara</em> maiden, it is inappropriate to do so. Rather, it is a <strong>commandment of the Sages</strong> that a man not marry off his minor daughter,\" etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>II.</strong> Rabbi Ya'akov Emden, 18th century (<em>Sh'eilas Ya'beitz</em> I, §14, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1408&st=&pgnum=39\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew link</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For us, whether regarding the <em>kiddushin</em> [the first stage of marriage] and certainly regarding the <em>nisu'in</em> [the second stage of marriage], it is unacceptable to conduct this with an actual minor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the concluding line in the responsum, quoted in the other answer.</p>\n<p><strong>III.</strong> <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em>, 19th century (EH 37:33, <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14243&st=&pgnum=252\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew link</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our rabbi, author of the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, wrote in EH 37:8: \"It is a commandment for a person not to marry off his daughter when she is a minor, until she grows up and says, 'I want [to marry] So-and-So.'\" [The Rama, Rabbi Moshe Isserles, adds in his gloss:] \"And there are those who say that nowadays [i.e. in the 16th century and the prior few centuries] it is practiced to marry off our minor daughters because we are in the Exile, and we don't always have the means to fully provide the dowry. Also, [the Jewish people] are few in number and we can't always [readily] find a suitable marriage partner. And it is customary [to accept this lenient opinion].\"</p>\n<p>But in our days, we do not marry off minor daughters, and we have never heard of someone marrying off a minor daughter. And this is correct, for in the Talmud (<em>Kiddushin</em> 41a) it is brought that it is forbidden to marry her when she is a minor. And while it could be that it is permitted if she is amenable (<em>Chelkas M'chokeik</em> EH 37:10), this is nevertheless not correct. And this is the practice that has spread in our time in our countries [i.e., not to marry off minor daughters].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>See fn. 3 in the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/65741\">original answer</a></sub></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub>I.e., the father; an alternative version reads this as \"they\", i.e., both the father and the daughter, which better conforms to the context of the passage - see <em>Chelkas M'chokeik</em> EH 56:6 (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7682\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew link</a>)</sub></p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub><em>Ishus</em> 3:19, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=2906\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew link</a>. </sub></p>\n\n\n",

If there is such a basis, is it permitted to throw stones even at cars driven by gentiles (who are presumably the primary target audience of the above-mentioned travel guides)?  Or must one first ascertain that the car is being driven by a Jew, and that the driving is not being done due to a life-threatening emergency?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is obviously forbidden to throw stones at anyone/ a car on Shabbat or any other day of the week. Even if someone was sure without a shadow of doubt that the driver was not either 1. a gentile or 2. a Jew who is allowed to drive to save a life, it is still not allowed for him to take the matter into his own hands, and endanger others. That is only for a Sanhedrin (which doesn't exist today). </p>\n\n<p>Even if the stones were set aside for this purpose for Shabbat, they would only change their status if throwing stones was allowed on Shabbat (since they have to be set aside for a permitted purpose like playing hopscotch or five stones or as a doorstop).</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.shemayisrael.com/parsha/ostroff/archives/shabbos24.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I have lived in various areas of Jerusalem and other chareidi areas in EY and have never seen anyone throwing stones.

Sefaradim tend to be lenient, Ashkenazim are strict from the outset (<em>lchathila</em>) and often lenient after the fact (<em>b'dieved</em>). A good summary of those laws can be found <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/788459/rabbi-avraham-gordimer/-d-e-dairy-equipment-certification-mysteries-and-facts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, a simpler one <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/tag/milky-and-meaty-pots/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and the sefaradi view <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=503\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Note it is always allowed to eat them one after the other - the question under debate is whether to eat them together.</p>\n\n<p>But here you have parve food on dairy equipment with parve food on meat equipment on the same plate - which is a different case. I can see no reason why this should not be allowed under condition that the pots are clean, not used for 24 hours and that no hot/spicy foods are involved (e.g., onions, garlic, lemons, and pickles). I have now seen that R Yaakov Goldstein answers the same <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/the-status-of-pareve-foods-cooked-in-a-meat-pot-or-vice-versa/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and checked with R Binyamin Tabadi who concurs with the above.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is permitted to eat a Nat Bar Nat dairy food with a Nat Bar Nat\n  meat foods although one may not pour the content of either pot\n  directly into each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And of course, we are speaking only in theory here. Any application in real life would require consultation with your rabbi as small details can make a big difference.</p>\n\n\n",

The bracha on the wine and the bracha of \"Hamavdil Bein Kodesh Lechol etc.\" is pushed off to Sunday night (SA OC 556:1).</p>\n\n<p>I understand why we don't drink the wine Motzaei Shabbos; it's already Tishah B'Av and we can't drink anything. I also understand why we don't have the spices; they're said only on the conclusion of Shabbos, to gladden the Neshamah on the departure of the Neshamah Yeseirah (MB 556:5, from SA OC 299:5) and we want to be sad on Tishah B'Av (I'm assuming). But why don't we make the final bracha of Hamavdil Bein Kodesh Lachol? We are, indeed, separating between the holy and the less holy, as indicated by our recital of Baruch Hamavdil and Atah Chonantanu during Maariv, so why do we omit the bracha in the process of makin Havdalah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The final bracha of havdala <strong>must</strong> be recited with the cup of wine. The original institution of havdalah was with a cup of wine and therefore the bracha after the wine was invalid without it. However, should it be <strong>impossible</strong> to get a cup of wine, then one can bediavad rely on the bracha from shmone esrai that was said motzaei Shabbat (ata chonantanu). If one can obtain a kos, then he is required to make havdalah <em>al hakos</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As a result, saying havdallah on motzai shabbos without wine is not allowed. That is why one who is sick and must eat on tisha b'av must first make havdallah (with a kos) before eating.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/935251/jewish/Shabbat-Chapter-Twenty-Nine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Hilchos Shabbas Chapter 29</a> Halacha 6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>6 It is a mitzvah [instituted by] our Sages to recite kiddush over [a\n  cup of] wine22 and to recite havdalah over [a cup of] wine.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although one recites havdalah in one's [evening] prayers, one is\n  required to recite [this blessing] over a cup [of wine].<sup>(23)</sup>\n  [Nevertheless,] once a person has said \"[Blessed is He] who\n  distinguishes between the holy and the mundane,\" he is permitted to\n  perform labor even though he has not recited havdalah over a cup [of\n  wine].</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>23</sup> In Hilchot Tefillah 2:12, the Rambam mentions the inclusion of havdalah in our evening prayers by the addition of the passage Attah\n  Chonantanu to the fourth blessing of the Shemoneh Esreh.</p>\n  \n  <p>When the Men of the Great Assembly ordained the prayers and blessings\n  for the Jewish people, the Jewish people were needy and could not\n  afford wine. Therefore, these Sages ordained the recitation of\n  havdalah in prayer. Afterwards, when the fortunes of the people\n  improved, the Sages ordained that they should recite this blessing\n  over a cup of wine, like kiddush.</p>\n  \n  <p>Subsequently, our people's prosperity suffered and the Sages\n  reinstituted the blessing into the prayer service. Nevertheless, in\n  order to prevent the matter from being totally dependent on\n  socio-economic factors, they established the following guidelines: A\n  person should recite the havdalah prayers in the Shemoneh Esreh of the\n  evening service. Afterwards, he should try to obtain wine in order to\n  fulfill the mitzvah as the Sages prescribed. If, however, this is not\n  possible, his recitation of the prayer in the evening service is\n  sufficient to fulfill his obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There I was, standing in front of those ashes, thinking about the meaning of life, after seeing all those gas chambers and crematoriums. I was feeling very sad. Then a small group of young haredim arrived at the other side of the heap. After a while, they started singing a very beautiful song. I didn't knew the song, nor could i understand one word of what they were singing. You see, i'm not a very emotional person, but when those guys started singing that song in front of those ashes I started crying like a baby.</p>\n\n<p>Until today when i remember that moment it gives me chills. It's one of my top 5 memories for sure. It would mean a lot to me to know what song they were singing, and if possible, the translated lyrics.</p>\n\n<p>Here's all I was able to record while crying [audio only]: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/QDH-wQ02OR0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://youtu.be/QDH-wQ02OR0</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>It is 'Yizkrem'. Here is a link to one performance of this song, but there are probably many others online: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9Y89PGlabBE\">https://youtu.be/9Y89PGlabBE</a>  The part of the song that you recorded can be first heard at around 49 seconds in.</p>\n\n<p>The lyrics [loosely translated by me]: Merciful Father, Who dwells on high, remember with mercy the holy individuals and communities that gave their lives in sanctification of Your Name. (this next part is what you recorded:) Remember them, remember them for good. Remember them, remember them together with the rest of the righteous throughout history.  </p>\n\n<p>It can be found in every siddur/prayer book, for it is said almost every shabbos near the end of the morning prayer.</p>\n\n\n",

The latter is plausible in that it is reminiscent of the type of contingent vow Ya'akov <em>avinu</em> took upon himself before travelling away from the land (<em>B'reshis</em> 28:20-22):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וידר יעקב נדר לאמר אם יהיה א-להים עמדי ושמרני בדרך הזה אשר אנכי הולך ונתן לי לחם לאכל ובגד ללבש ושבתי בשלום אל־בית אבי והיה ה' לי לא-להים <em>והאבן הזאת אשר שמתי מצבה יהיה בית א-להים וכל אשר תתן לי עשר אעשרנו לך</em></p>\n<p>:רש\"י שם</p>\n<p>האבן הזאת כַּךְ תְּפָרֵשׁ וָי\"ו זוּ שֶׁל וְהָאֶבֶן אִם תַּעֲשֶׂה לִי אֶת אֵלֶּה, אַנִי אֶעֱשֶׂה זׂאת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Some example translations:</p>\n<p>The Koren Siddur, <em>nusach Ashkenaz</em> is consistent with this syntax, \"...and plant us within our borders. <em>There we will prepare for You</em>...\". The Artscroll English translation in the regular <em>nusach Ashkenaz</em> and <em>S'farad</em>, as well as the Expanded Edition <em>nusach Ashkenaz</em> all follow this pattern. The <em>Hirsch Siddur</em> follows the other pattern (\"plant us so that we can bring...\").</p>\n<p>Although it has no period separating the phrases in the Hebrew, punctuation does not seem sufficient to indicate either way in most <em>sidurim</em> in situations such as these. As seen here, even the punctilious Koren version is not internally consistent when it comes to punctuation. I do not believe the conjugation of <em>na'ase</em> helps here either, as the jussive and plain future would be likely to sound identical.</p>\n\n\n",

The Tosfot gives some arguments <strong>to defend the minhag</strong> (Kiddush is not hefsek according to the Halacha, which stated that Kiddush is recited only at  the meal place, to recite and prepare kiddush is a short and easy occupation which has no problem of serious interruptions between washing and motsi (no Hesech Hadaat) ...).</li>\n<li>One discussion treated a <strong>Bedieved case:</strong> is it allowed to continue after the kiddush without washing hands a second time? If the answer is yes, the interruption came from the man <strong>who recited Kiddush</strong> only or even from others who are quite by hearing only (<strong>Shomea Keone</strong>)? </li>\n<li>For <strong>the reason from which appeared the institution of the Minhag</strong>, some Acharonim said \"Lo plug\" to unify the custom of Kidush on wine and Kiddush on bread.</li>\n<li>For the <strong>conservation of the minhag</strong> (despite its problems), some Acharonim conserve it partially (for the man who recite no, but for persons who are hearing him yes), see the answer of @Adam (Rashbam in Pesachim 106b accreditated such a way according to all amorayim opinions), some other conserve it totally or cancel it totally.</li>\n<li>In Yeke communities there are 2 minhagim, Hamburg (conserving the minhag of the Rosh) and Frankfurt (following the Shulchan Aruch and most Acharonim {including Gra and Taz})</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Genesis 29:35 with Genesis 30:25), his age at the time of Joseph's sale could not have been more than twenty-one.</strong> But placing Judah's marriage at the earliest possible date, viz., in his fifteenth year, <strong>only substitutes an interval of twenty-eight years instead of one of twenty-two, in which Judah's son Er must be born, grow up to manhood, (say at fifteen) marry, die, and leave his widow Tamar, who, after marrying with Onan and waiting for Shelah (which would consume at least another year), must become the mother of twin sons by her father-in-law (for which another year would be required), and must see the elder of the two married at ten years of age, if his sons are to be born upon the soft of Canaan.</strong> On either hypothesis, therefore, <strong>it seems indispensable to hold that Judah's grandsons were born in Egypt</strong>; and in this case there is little gained by putting Judah's marriage earlier than Joseph s sale.</p>\n\n<p>As a result to this assessment, how can anyone agree that Hezron and Hamul were part of the sojourn to Egypt when there is insufficient time for such events?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Gemara asks this question and answers that in the earlier generations people used to give birth at a younger age.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Torah's perspective on waiting or patience\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>1) What are the virtues of learning to wait or having patience, סבלנות?</p>\n\n<p>2) Is there anywhere in the Torah that shows because of lacking patience or the ability to wait, caused tragedies throughout Jewish history?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Patience, in the sense of trusting in God and letting things take their course, is one of the core teachings of the Torah. Impatience is caused by a false feeling of control over our destiny, and as we learn to relinquish that control to God our patience grows, together with our Emunah. Also, growth takes time, and without patience we do not give ourselves the time we need to grow and mature.</p>\n\n<p>While the Torah does not explicitly instruct us \"be patient\", patience is a common theme in many of the stories of the Torah. Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>God is very patient with people for the first ten generations, and then again between the Flood and the birth of Avraham. (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1178792/jewish/Hebrew-Text.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avos 5:2</a>)</li>\n<li>Avraham is patient with going to Canaan, and with waiting for it to be given to him. Lot is impatient and \"claims\" the land early.</li>\n<li>Avraham waits patiently for children. Sara gets impatient (after a long wait, admittedly) and gives him Hagar, which seems to have not been good.</li>\n<li>Yaakov is quite patient while working for Lavan before he marries Rachel.</li>\n<li>Yosef's brother's are imaptient, and try to pre-emptively prevent his dreams from coming true. Yaakov patiently waits to see what will happen.</li>\n<li>Yosef tries to give  a little \"push\" to how things are developing and asks the royal butler to mention him to Pharaoh. When this does not work out well he is very patient, and does not reveal himself to his brothers when they come.</li>\n<li>Moshe is impatient when conditions worsen for the Jews after he comes to Pharaoh, (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9866/jewish/Chapter-5.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shemos 5:23</a>) and he is punished for this.</li>\n<li>The Jews are impatient when Moshe does not come down from Har Sinai when they expected him, and they made the golden calf.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>the first teaching in Pirkei Avot is \"to be patient in judgment\", meaning to weigh things and not make hasty decisions. Likewise, in the Mesilat Yesharim the first step on the ladder of ascent after torah study is watchfulness which is to \"not do any act without first weighing it on the scales of understanding\". This is the first and most important foundation of everything after torah, i.e. getting the right understanding.</p>\n\n<p>The first tragedy, namely, Adam's eating from the forbidden fruit also involved lack of patience. According to the opinion that it was a grape, had he waited until the Sabbath, he would have used it to make Kidush and drank from it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>1) Hebrew language have many words for \"patience\" corresponding to the varied meanings of this concept. According to the sages (Akeidas Yitzchok 27:13) this is the most important personal trait to be pursued. There are lots of examples showing the virtue of that; I think is worth mentioning two in particular: restraining anger and avoid idolatry.</p>\n\n<p>2) One midrash says that if Israel had waited for Moses and did not had built the Golden calf, there would have been no exile. </p>\n\n<p>The Nach frequently teaches us to pratice patience with adages such as Koheles (7:8) which says \"the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit\". Mishlei says: “better the long patience than a hero, and someone who is in control of his spirit, than the conqueror of a city” and 14:29: “Patience results in much understanding; Impatience gets folly as its portion.” The prophet Micah show us that he suffers many challenging conditions and yet endures. At some point he says \"I will wait for Hashem who saves me\" (7:7). </p>\n\n<p>The patience of Israel is expressed in the 12th article of Maimonides' Principles: \"I believe with perfect faith in the coming of the Mashiach, and though he may tarry, none the less will I patiently hope every day until he does come.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Rather than something deep about momentary vs. long term inculcated happiness, I would suggest that the true deeper answer lies with the understanding that this is an anti-early-Christian polemic.

    "content": "# Not accepting gifts and not offending Jews\n\n## Frage\n\n<ol>\n<li>There is a halacha (see <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8:%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%99_%D7%98%D7%95_%D7%9B%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishle 15, 27</a> and <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=cm_x11135\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan aruch chosen mishpat 249.5</a>) that it is a pious practice not to take gifts (the one who hates gifts will live).  </li>\n<li>There is also a halacha not to offend people</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I see that people get offended when I do not take their gifts,.  </p>\n\n<p>How to fulfill both halochos practically? </p>\n\n<p>(Possible idea connected to the subject, I know that the Lubavicher Rebbe would give 1 Dollar for the gifts he would receive (so it is a purchase for a low price and not a gift)<br>\nIf this is the solution it will not work if the gift itself is money (what to do then?))</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch itself calls rejecting gifts a Midas Chassidus (i.e. not an obligation). If you have a choice between fulfilling something \"extra\" and fulfilling an obligation, you should definitely do the obligation.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the prohibition of offending someone, much ink has been spilled regarding the obligations of Chesed and Veahavta Lereiacha Kamocha (although some are of the opinion that it may not be a Biblical transgression of Veahavta Lereiacha Kamocha by passively not acting, per your comment). One such data point would be Sefer Ahavas Chesed by the Chafetz Chaim, Part 3 Chapter 8. That chapter deals with doing Chesed solely through words, and the fourth example given is lifting the spirits of someone who is sad through kind words. I think it would be correct to say that if it's a Mitzvah to raise someone's spirits, it would definitely be forbidden to hurt someone's feelings.</p>\n\n<p>As an aside, looking at the words of the Shulchan Aruch (and commentaries), one could easily argue that the \"gifts\" it is referring to are gifts that one bases their sustenance and livelihood on (not just a \"birthday present\" someone gives you). While I would assume that it applies to any freely given gift, I wouldn't be shocked if someone pointed out a Posek saying that it only applies to certain types of gifts. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>When performing Kiddushin, it has to be the man giving the money/something of value woman, not the other way around (Kiddushin 5b). Nevertheless, if the man is an important person, the woman could give the item to him, as he is giving to her the benefit of an important man taking her things (Kiddushin 7a).</p>\n\n<p>This Gemara is often brought up as a proof that one can give by taking. Perhaps you could apply the same principle to your question: it's not called taking unless it's for selfish purposes. If you're taking in order to give, that would be praiseworthy.  </p>\n\n<p>This p'shat is brought down as well by the Chidah (quoted in Talelei Oros) to Parshas Bikkurim (Devarim 26:2) regarding the difference between \"v'lakachta\" and \"v'heiveisa\" used in the pesukim. It's likewise brought down by <a href=\"http://torah.org/torah-portion/drasha-5756-terumah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Mordechai Kaminetzky</a> in respect to the wording in Parshas Terumah - \"<em>take</em> for me a portion\" - and by <a href=\"http://torah.org/torah-portion/ravfrand-5757-terumah/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Yissocher Frand</a> in respect to the repetitious wording of Avraham Avinu in Vayeira - \"I will <em>take</em> for you bread...<em>take</em> water...<em>took</em> butter, milk, and cattle...\". None of them bring down the aforementioned Gemara in Kiddushin, but it's the same concept.</p>\n\n\n",

Put it down outside their chambers, as if you need to rest, and at that point I'll enter. They won't know what hit them.\" And so it was. The butcher thus led R' Yehoshua to the Elders.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there were guards by the doors on the outside, and there were also guards on the inside of the entrance hall. The ones on the outside were to prevent people from going inside the main building, while the ones on the inside were to prevent the Elders from leaving. If footprints were seen going in, the Elders would kill the outer guards; if they were seen going out, the Elders would kill the inner guards. Thus, R' Yehoshua put just one of his shoes on backwards and walked in. Seeing contradictory footprints, the Elders killed all of the guards.</p>\n\n<p>Now, if nobody was allowed to reveal the Elders' location, presumably the reason is that nobody unauthorized was allowed to enter. So why did the guards let R' Yehoshua in?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua </p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll Bechoros 8b(3) note 19</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua told the butcher that unless he \"reached the place\" of the elders (used his intellectual powers) he would be no better than the animals that he killed. The butcher was afraid that if he emulated their \"intellectualism\" he would \"die\". That is he would lose any connection with the real world and his body would lose any meaningful function. Rav Yehoshua proved that even the elders were bound by the physical universe and even they must lay down their intellectual burden and rest.</p>\n\n<p>Daf 9a note 2 cites the <em>Maharal</em> that the narrative elements in the story are no more than a literary device.</p>\n\n<p>If someone tried to penetrate beyond the further side of the threshold, then the guards on the side from which he entered the threshold area would kill him or be killed themselves. Rav Yehoshua just stepped up to the threshold and stepped back leaving footprints in the bran (<em>Rashi</em>). This left footprints pointing out so the inner guards were killed. He then stepped back to the threshhold leaving prints leading in so the outer guards were killed.</p>\n\n<p>There is a <em>Rashi</em> that seems to imply that he reversed only one shoe so that the elders thought that two different people had passed the guards, one going in and one going out.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua entered during the confusion when the guards were being killed.</p>\n\n\n",

The Torah was turned down by all the nations but was accepted by Bnai Yisrael. The mashal of the Torah and Bnai Yisrael is that of a marriage. Even though the nations (of lesser yichus because they worshipped idols) turned down the Torah, the Bnai Yisrael (of greater yichus - from Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov) accepted the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>When a person is turned down for marriage, that reduces his prestige and makes it less likely that a family of greater prestige would lower themselves by accepting what the others turned down.</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll 8b(4) cites the <em>Maharsha</em> and the <em>Gr'a</em> that the \"man\" is Hashem and the second woman is Israel. When the first \"woman\" (the nations) rejected the Torah, Hashem was forced to offer it to the lowliest of the nations, a bunch of ragged slaves.</p>\n\n<p>Art Scroll Bechoros 8b(4) note 32 says that this was a parable that attempted to ridicule the Jewish belief in the afterlife. The man is the Jewish people, the first woman is olam hazeh and the second woman is olamhaba. The Jewish people, lowly and despised in this world, have been rejected by the lower status \"woman\". Surely we would not be accepted into the world to come <em>Maharal</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'd give a simple explanation, that's also good for Sabba's Drush answer. </p>\n\n<p>The dispute you mentioned (and many other disputes with the Greeks) is about the השגחה כללית vs השגחה פרטית:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Elders stick to השגחה כללית, saying that's Kal Vachomer, that's the Natural and [therefore] logical way of seeing things. </p></li>\n<li><p>The Sages replied that we, Jews, stick with השגחה פרטית, meaning Hashem destines people regardlessly of the Nature Laws and against common sense.

This is like the woodcutter who keeps cutting knowing that eventually people will see the profit in helping him carry his load.

The concept of the Messiah is that history is not a chain of events going nowhere but that there is a goal and it is going in that direction, namely, towards G-d's ultimate plan.

For instance:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yaakov's explicitly labels his final address to his children as eschatological - \"I will tell you what will happen to you at the end of days.\" (Gen. 49:10) He later refers to a continuity of power within the Tribe of Judah and a gathering of all the nations. Chazal understand this to refer to the Davidic line as having eternal kingship, fully realized at the end of days.</li>\n<li>Bilaam's final prophecy when he also tells Balak what will happen to HIS nation at the end of days (Num. 24:14) refers to a \"star descending from Yaakov and a scepter from Israel\" - a metonymy connected to the scepter of Judah prophesied by Yaakov and understood to refer to the same messianic king.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These two may be the most direct references to a messianic figure in the Torah, but many other verses are interpreted to refer to messianic times (such as the end of both sets of klalos).</p>\n\n\n",

The following notes give both interpretations.</p>\n\n<p>The first statement is dealt with in note 45.</p>\n\n<p><em>Maharal</em> says</p>\n\n<p>The elders asked for an empty statement which would include a false predicate. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Yehoshua did them one better by presenting a tale false in <strong>all</strong>\n  its particulars: one with an impossible subject (the foal of a mule)\n  as well as a preposterous predicate (the foal was born bearing a\n  promissory note).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>By saying the foal of the mare is impossible, they made themselves look ridiculous by implicitly accepting that had he said the foal of a horse, it could have been true.</p>\n\n<p><em>Gra</em> connects this to the gemara in Avodas Zara 11b that Rome would put an able bodied man (Esav) on the back of a limping man (Yaakov) to show that Rome was in charge.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua said that the mule (Zion) would give birth and \"collect\" all that was owed the Jewish people for the persecution. This is like the declaration of the navi <em>Rani Akarah</em> </p>\n\n<p>When the elders objected and implied that the Jews would never be redeemed (a mule cannot give birth), Rav Yehoshua replied, this is the falsehood. See note 15 on Page 70 of <em>Gra's Commentary on Various Aggados</em></p>\n\n<p><em>Kedushas Levi</em> says that the mashal is that the mule represents an evil person.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Yehoshua told of the wicked man who finally performs some mitzvah.\n  But his act is \"born with a demand for a hundred thousand zuz\"; the\n  evildoer immediately feels that he is owed an enormous reward by his\n  Father in Heaven! Asked the Athenians: Does it ever happen that an\n  evildoer, submerged as he is in sin, performs a mitzvah? Conceded Rav\n  Yehoshua: That is part of the fiction! Even the occasional mitzvah\n  observed by an evildoer is ingenuine, because it is performed not for\n  its own sake but in expectation of recompense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note 46 says about the next set of questions</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Because the Athenians were unable to understand Rav Yehoshua's\n  \"absurd\" parable, they countered with their own (apparent) absurdities\n  in the hope that he would not understand their intent. <em>Maharsha</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><em>Maharal</em> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The embryonic sac, which shelters and preserves the developing fetus.\n  That which preserves what does not exist (the embryo of the mule) is\n  fit as well to preserve what cannot rot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this question, the Torah is called Bris Melach (a covenant of salt) and they attacked saying that the covenant had been broken (the salt was rotted). This is like the \"replacement theology\" of the gentiles. He responded by saying that the \"replacement\" does not exist as the gentile avodas zara is false. See Art Scroll Bechoros 8b(6) note 48.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Gra</em> adds that the covenant is upheld by the blameless children who are too young to be obligated by the Torah, but nevertheless study\n  Torah and perform Mitzvos.

Rav Yehoshua responded that the bris with Hashem is like salt that cannot rot and Yisrael will thus be able to \"have children\" unlike the nations which are indeed like mules.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>See also <em>Michtav MeEliyahu</em> II p. 49 who cites a homily by <em>R' Chaim Volozhiner</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The next question, the house in the air, shows Rav Yehoshua's connection to the supernatural. Artscroll Bechoros 8b6 note 51 says</p>\n\n<p>One would have expected such a feat to dispel, by itself, any doubts the Athenians may still have harbored regarding R' Yehoshua's capabilities. However, the issue at hand was whether the Jewish Sages were privy to Divine insight, while R' Yehoshua's ascent was a display of supernatural <em>power</em> rather than of supernatural <em>wisdom</em>.</p>\n\n<p>His answer was to show them that they could not \"build\" such a building without being able to provide the necessary preparations. If the preparations are not possible, the the builder is not at fault for not completing the building (note 52 <em>Maharal</em>)</p>\n\n<p><em>Maharsha</em> describes this as an attempt by the elders to say that the Jews would never be able to return to a relationship with Hashem (build the temple) because Eretz Yisrael is under the control of the Romans and there is no place on Earth that hte Jews can call their own.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua showed that Hashem is accessible to all who cleave to him even \"between the sky and the Earth\". It is only the worshipers of idols who insist on concrete physical representations that cannot approach Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Maharal says that the Sages explain that the soul is separate from the body and continues after death. The Athenians held that both body and soul are destroyed by death.They argued that since the sage believe that a person is both a soul and a body then a person should be able to \"dwell\" in both realms. Since man is restricted to Earth, that proves it is not so.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua answered that since man has a bodily component, then that component prevents him from rising to his complete status. Man cannot raise the physical to existance \"above the Earth\".</p>\n\n<p>According to <em>Nezer Nitzachon</em>, the Athenians denied <em>creation ex nihilo</em>. Rav Yehoshua answered, that Hashem created the universe, it is only man who must build from what already exists.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua demonstrated the internal contradiction inherent in the Athenian belief structure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For although Aristotelian philosophy asserts the eternity of matter,\n  it also holds that matter draws its existence from an immaterial First\n  Cause. How, asked R' Yehoshua, if you cannot conceive of a \"building\n  in air\", do you intend to elevate bricks to that selfsame air? How can\n  matter, the fundamental \"bricks\" of which the world is built, emanate\n  from a Cause completely immaterial?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The question of the field of knives according to note Artscroll Bechoros 8b8 note 56 is like the salt rotting.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This echoes the earlier question regarding the presevation of salt.\n  Here too a method is sought to produce an effect on a thing that\n  usually produces that effect on other things.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This involves providence, Hashem affecting the world and things happening by \"chance\" (see note 58).</p>\n\n<p>The \"field of swords\" denotes the troubles of the world. The Athenians say that <strong>at most</strong>, the concept of Hashem is that of the \"watchmaker\" who has abandoned the world to run as it happens. Note 58 points out that this is the problem of צדיק ורע לו (A righteous person who suffers). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Have the Jewish Sages, they challenged Rav Yehoshua, any incisive\n  theoretical \"tool\" with which to \"undercut\" our conclusion?\n  Rav Yehoshua's answer was designed to force their objection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>קרנא דחמרא would use the word חמר not as donkey but as matter. קרן means excellence. They objected that matter is inferior, so how can the \"excellence\" of matter prevent (or cut off) the ills of the world. Rav yehoshua points out that once you have granted that matter is inferior, you have done away with the problem of evil. As it says in *Shabbos 55a, \"there is no suffering without sin\". Suffering of perfectly innocent people is not the result of a special Providence, nor of a completely amoral cosmos (nor of \"chance\") but the inevitable cost of life as corporeal beings.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They result from the innate deficiency of matter: our material bodies,\n  like all other matter, are inherently unstable ans susceptible to\n  injury and to dissolution. Man's immortal soul, on the other hand, is\n  excellent indeed, and offers man his ultimate escapefrom the\n  vulnerabilities of the flesh.

Below is a summary of the relevant parts of the Gemara. After being challenged by Caesar, R' Yehoshua went to Athens to defeat the Athenian Elders in a battle of wits. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In the process of their debate, the following cases are brought up.</p>\n\n<p>The Elders challenged R' Yehoshua to build a house in midair. R' Yehoshua said the Shem of Hashem and began levitating. \"Bring me some bricks and mortar,\" he said, \"and I'll do it.\" (The story doesn't make clear when, exactly, he dropped back down to Earth, but presumably he does eventually.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Further down, the Elders ask him to bring a well from the desert into the city. \"Bring me a rope of bran,\" he said, \"and I'll do it.\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The Elders finally ask R' Yehoshua to sew together a broken millstone. \"Bring me threads of stone,\" he said, \"and I'll do it.\"</p>\n\n<p>In respect to the second case, with the well, Rashi says that \"if you can fulfill my request (which you can't), I will fulfill yours.\"</p>\n\n<p>Since R' Yehoshua uses a similar language in all three cases, I would assume that he meant the same by all of them. So how did he answer their challenge by saying that he won't? He's not fulfilling their challenge or saying that it's possible; all he's saying is that he'll do it when the impossible happens, which is essentially saying no in a dignified manner.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The house in the air shows Rav Yehoshua's connection to the supernatural. Artscroll Bechoros 8b6 note 51 says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One would have expected such a feat to dispel, by itself, any doubts\n  the Athenians may still have harbored regarding R' Yehoshua's\n  capabilities. However, the issue at hand was whether the Jewish Sages\n  were privy to Divine insight, while R' Yehoshua's ascent was a display\n  of supernatural <em>power</em> rather than of supernatural <em>wisdom</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His answer was to show them that they could not \"build\" such a building without being able to provide the necessary preparations. If the preparations are not possible, the the builder is not at fault for not completing the building (note 52 <em>Maharal</em>)</p>\n\n<p><em>Maharsha</em> describes this as an attempt by the elders to say that the Jews would never be able to return to a relationship with Hashem (build the temple) because Eretz Yisrael is under the control of the Romans and there is no place on Earth that hte Jews can call their own.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua showed that Hashem is accessible to all who cleave to him even \"between the sky and the Earth\". It is only the worshipers of idols who insist on concrete physical representations that cannot approach Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Maharal says that the Sages explain that the soul is separate from the body and continues after death. The Athenians held that both body and soul are destroyed by death.They argued that since the sage believe that a person is both a soul and a body then a person should be able to \"dwell\" in both realms. Since man is restricted to Earth, that proves it is not so.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua answered that since man has a bodily component, then that component prevents him from rising to his complete status. Man cannot raise the physical to existance \"above the Earth\".</p>\n\n<p>According to <em>Nezer Nitzachon</em>, the Athenians denied <em>creation ex nihilo</em>. Rav Yehoshua answered, that Hashem created the universe, it is only man who must build from what already exists.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yehoshua demonstrated the internal contradiction inherent in the Athenian belief structure.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For although Aristotelian philosophy asserts the eternity of matter,\n  it also holds that matter draws its existence from an immaterial First\n  Cause. How, asked R' Yehoshua, if you cannot conceive of a \"building\n  in air\", do you intend to elevate bricks to that selfsame air? How can\n  matter, the fundamental \"bricks\" of which the world is built, emanate\n  from a Cause completely immaterial?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The other answers are similar in that he is showing them that their assumptions about the universe are inherently flawed. Each of the \"objects\" that he requests has a deeper meaning involving the difference between the materiolistic philosophy of the Athenians and the spiritual philosophy of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Yehoshua stuck a finger out (we can only hope it wasn't his middle one) and said, \"It's right here.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Prove it,\" the Elders demanded.</p>\n\n<p>\"Bring a rope, and we can measure it,\" R' Yehoshua replied.</p>\n\n<p>Now, <a href=\"http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Scolumb.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Greeks knew that that the world was round</a>; they thus didn't believe that the center of the Earth was anywhere on the surface. It's <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_shape.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">unclear what Chazal in general held</a> - each Tanna seemed to hold something different. Nevertheless, whatever you think R' Yehoshua held, there's an issue. If R' Yehoshua held the world was round, the center couldn't be on the surface. If he held the world was flat, how could he tell with such precision that he just so happened to be in the middle of the world, and that it's not a few inches to the side?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As you say, the debate was a battle of wits. It is important to keep this in mind when analyzing it. We should not expect the account to necessarily yield many substantive insights -- that is not its point. We should instead expect to find <em>structural</em> brilliance: good argumentation, solid comebacks and sharp turnarounds. That is exactly is what we find here.</p>\n\n<p>The Athenians asked him a question seemingly impossible to answer: where is the center of the earth? Whether they thought the earth was round or flat, they certainly did not think there was any chance he could identify the exact location of its center. They thought they had him beat.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Chananiah countered brilliantly. He pointed to a random spot and said \"here.\" This was brilliant because no matter what they believed (assuming even that they had a belief) he knew they would not be able to refute him. When they asked \"who says?\" he countered \"bring rope and measure!\" They obviously did not have enough rope, so he won the round.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Athenians were asking the Jew... \"Where is the \"center\" of your spirituality, now that the Temple is destroyed?\"</p>\n\n<p>A Greek understood that a certain holy site was a focal point of the religion in question. If one Greek city held possession of the \"Temple of the Oracle\" for instance, then the oracle was the place where all holiness for that city supplied the city (blessing, protection, etc.). Also, all land outside the holy place was nothing of spiritual value. If an enemy state attacked and conquered the holy site, it would demoralize the Greeks since they \"lost\" their center of spirituality and could not replace it. (The gods have abandoned us etc.).</p>\n\n<p>The Greeks wanted to know how the Jews could still claim connection to Torah life if the \"Temple Center\" was destroyed.</p>\n\n<p>R' Yehoshuah answered that the center of the Torah world and manifestation of G-d's true presence is anywhere. You don't need a Temple Center to connect. They asked for proof. He responded that one must do the spiritual work (prayer, chesed, Torah midos etc.) and then you will know you are connected. That seems to be the mashal.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hashem's Curse to the Nachash\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash (Bereishis Rabbah 20:2) notes that Hashem asked Adam why he ate the fruit, and he answered it was because Chavah told him it was good, and he succumbed. He then asked Chavah why <em>she</em> ate, and she said it's because she listened to the snake. Without letting the snake defend itself, Hashem cursed the snake. Why? Because the snake could have gotten off the hook by claiming \"divrei haRav v'divrei hatalmid, divrei mi shom'in\" - you, Chavah, should have listened to Hashem, not me. I had no role in your sin; you succumbed to your own Yetzer Hara. It's all your fault.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the snake's not wrong. Divrei HaRav is a valid claim. So why didn't Hashem let the snake defend itself?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עם אדם נשא ונתן, עם חוה נשא ונתן, ועם נחש לא נשא ונתן?! אלא, אמר הקב\"ה: נחש זה רשע בעל תשובות, ואם אומר אני לו, עכשיו הוא אומר לי: אתה צוית אותם ואני צויתי אותם, מפני מה הניחו צוייך והלכו להם אחר צוויי?! אלא, קפץ עליו ופסקו ויאמר ה׳ אל הנחש וגו</p>\n  \n  <p>With Adam He discussed, and with Chavah He discussed, but with the snake He did not discuss?! Rather, Hashem said, \"This snake is wicked and is a master of responses. If I talk to him, he'll answer, \"You commanded them and I commanded them. Why should they put aside your commandment and go after mine?!\" Rather, Hashem cut Him off and said...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Fred pointed out, the Gemara in Sanhedrin 29a, when discussing this point, says that the reason Hashem didnt talk with the snake isn't because he didn't let the snake talk, but because the snake didn't feel like it. The Midrash, however, clearly says that the reason Hashem didn't let the snake talk is because of the above reason. So, problem #2: Why didn't the Midrash and Gemara give the same explanation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Matnos Kehunah, commenting on that Midrash, says that Hashem did so because since Adam and Chava were going to be punished, it wouldn't be right that the one who caused them to sin should be exonerated while they suffer.</p>\n\n\n",

An <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/29460/472\">answer</a> there quotes the Rambam (Laws of Tefilin, Mezuzah, and Sefer Torah 1:13) thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יג  ספר תורה תפילין ומזוזות שכתבן מין, יישרפו.  כתבן גוי, או ישראל משומד, או מוסר, או עבד, או אישה, או קטן--הרי אלו פסולין וייגנזו:  שנאמר \"וקשרתם . . . וכתבתם\" (דברים ו,ח-ט; דברים יא,יח-כ)--כל שמוזהר על הקשירה ומאמין בה, הוא שכותב.  נמצאו ביד מין ואין ידוע מי כתבן, ייגנזו; נמצאו ביד גוי, כשרים.  ואין לוקחין ספרים תפילין ומזוזות מן הגויים ביתר על דמיהן, שלא להרגיל אותם לגונבם ולגוזלם.‏</p>\n<p>A Torah scroll, Tefillin, or Mezuzah written by a heretic -- burn it!... If you find one in the possession of a heretic and don't know who wrote it, bury it; if in the possession of a non-Jew, assume it's kosher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we destroy a heretic-written <em>sefer torah</em>, then it seems that that particular <em>sefer torah</em> didn't have <em>kedusha</em> even though <em>sifrei torah</em> usually do.  Similarly, even though a Tanakh has <em>kedusha</em> in general, I would argue (from the <em>sefer torah</em>) that it doesn't when written by a heretic (<em>min</em>, in the Rambam passage).  So we must ask: is a Christian bible the product of a heretic?</p>\n<p>There is some ambiguity about the definition of heresy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In talmudic literature a number of terms are used to refer to heretics, <em>min</em>, <em>apikoros</em>, <em>kofer</em>, and <em>mumar</em>, each of which also has other meanings. Min is the most common term and the one that appeared originally in the 12th petition of the daily *Amidah. Some identify the talmudic minim with the Judeo-Christians, others with unspecified groups who denied rabbinic authority and/or the belief in the coming of the Messiah. There is an early tradition that there were 24 groups of minim as early as the destruction of the Second Temple (TJ, Sanh. 10:29c). Among the errors of the minim, the Talmud lists denial of God's unity; belief in an independent divinity of evil; the portrayal of God as a cruel jester (Sanh. 38b–39a); and the denial of Israel's chosenness (Sanh. 99a), physical resurrection, and the coming of the Messiah (Sanh. 91a). *Maimonides identified minut with atheism, with the denial of God's unity and incorporeality, with the denial of creation ex nihilo, and with the belief in a power intermediary between God and man (Yad, Teshuvah 3:7).

If it is slanted, then the structure is what a civil engineer would call a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truss\" rel=\"nofollow\">truss</a>.  Trusses are very strong for their weight.

This sounds more similar to your translation, and it seems to imply that there were beams inside the planks to help keep them sturdy. Thus, they were neither horizontal nor slanted but rather vertical.</p>\n\n<p>If you take the JPS translation at face value to indicate one of the beams, without specifying which one, the question shouldn't be <em>horizontal</em> and diagonal, but rather <em>vertical</em> or diagonal. To this the various commentators to chapters 26 and 27 seem to indicate that they were vertical. (Logically, this makes sense as well. These beams were <em>huge</em>; if they were slanted even the tiniest bit, they would fall over with a big, loud, <strong><em>thud</em></strong>.) Though, this translation doesn't seem to explain what \"pass[ing] end to end\" means. Thus, I'm going to assume that JPS had in mind what Artscroll said.</p>\n\n\n",

The order of the genes are also closer to humans in this lineup and as far as we know the order is not important for gene production. they just need to be there. There is also signs of chromosome fusion of chromosome 2 in humans which would explain why we have 23 pairs of chromosomes while apes have 24 from a common ancestry perspective. there are other converging evidence of this sort such as retrovirus genes from ancient viruses which, scientists say, allow us to trace the DNA lineage somewhat.</p>\n\n<p>some say the Genesis account is not literal. But according to the view that it is (which is supported by the Midrash in the creation of Adam) why would God give such contradictory evidence to the Genesis account?

    "content": "# Is Offending Jews forbidden?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that it is forbidden to offend Jews</p>\n\n<p>Is this true?<br>\n      And until what level, (how much should we need to know what offends people (it is in their head))?    </p>\n\n<p>If yes, Is it forbidden to offend a Jew by not doing something? (Example <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/75502/5120\">not taking his gift</a>).   </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes people get offended just for the show, and sometimes they hide that they are offended,<br>\nWhat is the halachik responsibility not to offend? (It is hard to imagine that the halocho is not specific and practical, but general, and the more psychology you know the better you can do it)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I believe the main prohibition is that of Ona'as Devarim (as derived by the Gemara, BM 58b). For instance, one is not allowed to remind a convert about the things he did as a non-Jew, because it might hurt him. Likewise, one may not inquire of a storekeeper how much something is with no intention of buying it, because he'll hurt the storeowner's feelings when the latter's hopes are dashed when he sees the customer isn't actually buying it. </p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, the Gemara (ibid.) says that one who embarrasses another publicly and one who calls another by a name they dislike, even if they show no response to it, are among those who don't leave Gehinnom (c\"v, lo aleinu).</p>\n\n<p>To illustrate the severity of Ona'as Devarim, the Gemara (ibid. 59a-b) recounts a lengthy story regarding the Achnai oven. To make things short, R' Gamliel excommunicated R' Elazar for disagreeing with the Rabbanan and refusing to stand down. Worse, the two Tannaim were brothers-in-law; R' Elazar's wife was R' Gamliel's sister. So every day when R' Elazar davened, his wife would bang pots in the kitchen between his Shemoneh Esrei and Tachanun to prevent him from davening effectively. For one reason or another, she wasn't able to stop him one day, and since he was able to daven effectively, although he didn't intend to do so, his broken heart seeped into his tefillos, and immediately, R' Gamliel died. (If you thought that was long, you should see how the Gemara tells it.)</p>\n\n<p>Another thing to take into account, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/75581/is-offending-jews-forbidden#comment220590_75581\">mevaqesh</a>, I think, was alluding to, is that since you, I'm assuming, don't want to be hurt, you shouldn't hurt others. </p>\n\n<p>There are also the prohibitions against things such as, but not limited to, lashon hara, hatred, bearing a grudge, and taking revenge. Although one isn't necessarily violating any of these by offending someone else, he may very well be in violation of lifnei iveir if the offended party retaliates. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, depending on who is being offended, a Chilul Hashem might be at stake - \"<em>this</em> is how frum Jews treat each other? I want no part of this.\"</p>\n\n<p>Now comes the more difficult part of the question: where do you draw the line? Obviously Halacha doesn't want you locked up in your house all day to avoid offending others (I'm really in the mood to add a political comment here but I wouldn't want to offend anybody), but I think we've listed enough sources to prove you can't just go around saying whatever you want. My advice is to know your audience. Stay away from certain subjects - ones everyone knows are taboo, like politics (see above) and ones that, if you know the person well enough, you know they would find hurtful, like the examples given in the Ona'as Devarim sugya. And of course, CYLOR when applicable. You're right; a psychologist who can read people well is able to back off when he or she senses that they're stepping on sore topics. But that shouldn't stop the rest of us from trying. </p>\n\n<p>In terms of <em>refraining</em> from action that's offending, I think the same advice should apply. If it's something you know will offend them, try to lessen the pain. As I mentioned in the question you linked about presents: ask yourself if you're refraining for selfish reasons, and honestly decide if you would be acting more selflessly by acting. </p>\n\n<p>As far as people pretending they're hurt, or people pretending they're <em>not</em> hurt, there's nothing you can do about that. If you put in the best but reasonable effort you can to prevent anyone from getting hurt, you can't possibly be expected to do more than that.</p>\n\n\n",

This topic has been <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17169/3388\">dealt with already</a> on this site.</p>\nOne <em>heter</em> that the Rambam does <em>not</em> list is leaving Eretz Yisrael to go on vacation or to visit family abroad. Yet this is clearly popular practice; many people travel back and forth frequently without a whim.</p>\nSo how far does this Halacha go? Does Rambam mean that one can never step foot outside Eretz Yisrael for even a moment unless one of the listed <em>heterim</em> are in effect? Or does the entire Halacha only refer to leaving Eretz Yisrael for a longer period of time?</p>\nNote that the Rambam there also states that one may not <em>dwell</em> outside of Eretz Yisrael unless there is a significant famine going on in the Land. So his first Halacha wasn't referring to people leaving Eretz Yisrael permanently (for dwelling purposes): it was speaking of <em>heterim</em> for a temporary exit from the Land, and still Rambam only said it was permissible under those specific circumstances.</p>Please provide sources for your answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R Shlomo Aviner (at the very bottom of <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2010/12/shut-sms-96.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) uses this Rambam to forbid vacation outside of Israel for those who live there.</p>\n\n<p>However R <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Wosner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel Halevi Wosner</a> (Shut Shevet Halevi 5:173, cited bottom of <a href=\"http://dinonline.org/2015/07/17/here-to-stay-the-halachah-of-leaving-the-land-of-israel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The primary prohibition of leaving the Land\n  applies only when one intends to establish his residence outside of\n  Eretz Yisrael, but leaving temporarily is more lenient.

Upon further inspection, it would\n  appear that the Talmud limits this prohibition to Kohanim. The Talmud\n  (Shabbat 14b), teaches that Yosi ben Yo'ezer and Yosi ben Yochanan\n  decreed impurity, on the 'Lands of the Nations', i.e. all the land\n  outside of the Land of Israel. In his commentary to Ohalot (2:3),\n  Rambam explains that the reason for this decree was that the gentiles\n  were not careful to mark their graves. All of Chutz La'aretz therefore\n  has a status of Tum'a d'Rabanan, rabbinic impurity, just like a Beit\n  HaPras, a field of graves that was plowed under, which is suspected to\n  contain human remains. A Kohen is rabbinically prohibited from leaving\n  the Land of Israel and entering the Diaspora, as it is impure.</p>\n  \n  <p>But the Talmud (Avoda Zara 13a) states that a Kohen can go to Chutz\n  LaAretz for a court case, and pass through a Beit HaPras in order to\n  fulfill a mitzva like marrying a woman or studying Torah. These\n  conditions override the rabbinic prohibition.</p>\n  \n  <p>[...]</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>But the Maharit (Kiddushin 31b) rules that the prohibition in leaving the Land of Israel is only if the intent is to settle\n  permanently in the Diaspora. Based on this, many authorities are\n  lenient regarding visits abroad</strong> (See Shevet Halevi 5:173 [quoted above]; Yechaveh\n  Da'at 5:57; Tzitz Eliezer 11:94, 14:72; Magen Avraham 531:7; Tashbetz\n  3:288;).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>אבל לשכון בחוצה לארץ אסור\nThe very Rambam you quote is clear the issue is not short visits, he states living outside of Israel is the forbidden.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How long was the period of Oppression\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>How can Genesis 15:13 says that the Israelites were enslaved for 400 years?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Genesis 41:46 states that Joseph was 30 when he came to power: “Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt.” Genesis 50:26 says that he died at age 110: “And Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old…” Joseph, then, ruled for 80 years (110-30=80). After Joseph rose to power, there were seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine (Genesis 41:29 ff), and <strong>the Israelites entered Egypt two years into the years of famine (Genesis 45:6-12), which would be the ninth year after Joseph rose to power.</strong> <strong>80 years of Joseph’s rule, minus nine years before the Israelites arrived, means that for at least 71 years the Israelites lived in Egypt without being enslaved</strong> (see Exodus 1:6 ff). 430 years for the sojourn minus 71 years means that at most, the <strong>Israelites were enslaved for 359 years</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Here is another point that has been made.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Kohath lived 133 years (Exodus 6:18), while Amram lived 137 years (Exodus 6:20). <strong>If we generously allow that Kohath was a newborn baby, when the family moved to Egypt, and that he begat Amram in the very last year of his life, and that Amram in turn begat Moses in his very last year, we only get 133 + 137 + 80 (Moses’ age when leaving Egypt, Exodus 7:7). That’s a maximum of 350 years for the entire sojourn.</strong> Good times as well as bad times.\n350 years is the most we can stretch those 3 generations to, but it gets even worse, when we remember again that Amram married his own aunt, Jochebed . There’s no need to do the exact math here — suffice it to say that since there’s one less generation on the distaff side than on the sword side, it means in rough numbers, that <strong>Jochebed would have had to be as old as Kohath and Amram combined.</strong> Admittedly the Bible doesn’t state in so many words that Jochebed wasn’t 270 years, when she gave birth to Moses, but this would mean the she was thrice as old as Sarah was, when she conceived.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<h2>Brief Summary:</h2>\n\n<p>The commentators almost all agree that the four hundred years was not the time spent in Egypt. Rather, the four hundred years is from an earlier time (with some disagreements as to what that time is). Most of the commentators agree that the actual time spent in Egypt was two hundred and ten years. Other possibilities suggested are two hundred and twenty five years, two hundred and twenty seven years, two hundred and forty years, and two hundred and seventy years, with the outlier view that the entire time mentioned was indeed spent in Egypt itself.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>Important Scriptural Facts:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Abraham was 75 when he left Haran (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0112.htm#4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 12:4</a>).</li>\n<li>Abraham was 100 at Isaac's birth (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0121.htm#5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 21:5</a>).</li>\n<li>Isaac was 60 at Jacob's birth (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0125.htm#26\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 25:26</a>).</li>\n<li>Jacob was 130 when he went down to Egypt (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0147.htm#9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 47:9</a>).</li>\n<li>Jacob spent 17 years in Egypt and died at 147 (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0147.htm#28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 47:28</a>).</li>\n<li>Moses was 80 at the Exodus (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0207.htm#7\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 7:7</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>The Actual Answer:</h2>\n\n<p>The question of the length of the exile was taken up by virtually every commentator. Most of them, e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a> (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9873#showrashi=true\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashbam\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40236&st=&pgnum=135\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bechor Shor</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40225&st=&pgnum=86\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a> one approach), <em>et al</em>, assume that the four hundred years prophesied to Abraham were from Isaac's birth while the four hundred and thirty years mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0212.htm#40\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 12:40</a> were from the time of the prophecy. Thus, the prophecy occurred thirty years before Isaac's birth, when Abraham was seventy. The actual amount of time spent in Egypt was only two hundred and ten years, according to the Sages; this can be calculated by starting with four hundred and subtracting the sixty years for Isaac's age at Jacob's birth and subtracting one hundred and thirty years for Jacob's age when he entered Egypt. 400 - 60 - 130 = 210. And of course, as noted in the question, it is impossible to reach four hundred years with just the generations of Kehat, Amram, and Moses.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N1AYu.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/N1AYu.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Rashi's commentary from chabad.org\"></a></p>\n\n<p>This approach is also justified by the claim in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=23&daf=119b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Batra 119b</a> (<a href=\"https://halakhah.com/bababathra/bababathra_119.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">translation</a>) that Jocheved was born when they entered Egypt, was one hundred and thirty years old when she gave birth to Moses, and Moses was eighty years old when they left Egypt (130 + 80 = 210).</p>\n\n<p>The most glaring issue with this theory is that it requires the prophecy at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covenant_of_the_pieces\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Covenant Between the Parts</a> to have occurred when Abraham was seventy years old. Yet the text in Genesis 12:4 explicitly states that Abraham was seventy five years old when he left Haran. In order to avoid this issue, many of the commentaries adopt the idea in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seder_Olam_Rabbah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Seder Olam</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34250&st=&pgnum=21\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chapter One</a>), that Abraham was seventy at the time of the prophecy but then returned to Haran for five years (until he was seventy five) and then came back to Canaan, and the verse is saying that he was seventy five when he left Haran for the last time.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radak</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40230&st=&pgnum=73\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Genesis 15:13</a>) instead modifies the four hundred and thirty years to have started five years before the prophecy, when Abraham was first told to go to Canaan. This is also Bechor Shor's \"<em>peshat</em>\" approach (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40225&st=&pgnum=86\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilna_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Elijah of Vilna</a> adopts a similar approach in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34250&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Seder Olam</a> .</p>\n\n<p>Another issue that most of these commentaries do not address, is <em>why</em> the Torah uses  two different calculations.</p>\n\n<p>A different variation of this is offered by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chananel_ben_Chushiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Chananel</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38866&st=&pgnum=35\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>) and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ben_Asher\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Bachye Ben Asher</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14069&st=&pgnum=201\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>). They argue that the four hundred and thirty years starts from Isaac's birth, and the four hundred years starts from the beginning of the hardships of Abraham's progeny and that the three different figures were based on merit. However, this would mean that the four hundred years began when Isaac was thirty years old, but they don't identify anything significant that happened then. Using this calculation, the actual time in Egypt would have been two hundred and forty years (430 - 60 - 130 = 240).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ramban</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40234&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>) suggests that both calculations are referring to the same time period, which was four hundred and thirty years. However, God did not bother to specify the additional thirty years to Abraham, and simply told him the imprecise number of four hundred years.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודעתי בדרך הפשט כי י\"י אמר לאברהם ידוע תדע כי טרם תתי לך הארץ הזאת גר יהיה זרעך בארץ לא להם ימים רבים ארבע מאות שנה ולא חשש להודיע השלשים כי אמר לו עוד ודור רביעי ישובו הנה להודיעו שלא ישובו מיד בסוף ארבע מאות עד הדור הרביעי שיהיה שלם עון האמורי ירמוז לשלשים שנה הללו כי עמדם במדבר ארבעים שנה לא מפני עון האמורי שלא נשלם</p>\n  \n  <p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is my opinion that G-d said to Abraham, \"<em>Know of a surety that</em> before I give you this land, <em>thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs</em> for a long time — <em>four hundred years</em>.\" He did not care to mention the additional thirty years to him [i.e., Abraham], because He told him further on, <em>and in the fourth generation they shall come back hither</em>, thereby informing him that they will not come back immediately at the end of four hundred years until the fourth generation when the sin of the Amorite will be full. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ber_Chavel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chavel</a> translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Then (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40234&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:42</a>) Ramban calculates the actual time in Egypt as being somewhat more than two hundred and ten years:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנכון שיאמר כי גר יהיה זרעך בארץ לא להם ארבע מאות שנה מן היום הזה והענין לאמר לו לא ינחלו בניך הארץ הזאת אשר אני נותן להם מיד אבל יהיו גרים כמוך בארץ לא להם ארבע מאות שנה ועוד לא ישובו הנה עד הדור הרביעי למלאת ארבע מאות ושלשים ואם כן תהיה עמידתם במצרים כמו מאתים ועשרים שנה או קרוב לזה ואם יהיה חשבון של אותיות רד\"ו שמה מסורת בישראל יתכן שירמוז ליורדים עצמם שאחרי מות יעקב יעמדו הם שם מאתים ועשר שנים ועם י\"ז יהיו רכ\"ז</p>\n  \n  <p>The correct interpretation is that He was saying to Abraham \"<em>that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs... four hundred years</em> from this day on.\" The purport thereof was to tell him: \"your children will not immediately inherit this land which I give them, but instead they will be strangers like you were, in a land not theirs [for a period of] four hundred years and more. They will not return here till the fourth generation when four hundred and thirty years will be completed.\" But if so, then their stay in Egypt lasted about two hundred and twenty years or thereabouts. Now if the numerical value of the word '<em>r'du</em>' (<em>get you down</em>) <em>thither</em>, [which is two hundred and ten], be an established tradition in Israel, it is possible that [Jacob, by using the word <em>r'du</em>], alluded to those who arrived in Egypt that after Jacob's death they would stay there two hundred and ten years. With the seventeen years that Jacob lived in the land of Egypt, their stay altogether totalled two hundred and twenty-seven years. (Chavel translation) </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Later (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40234&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:42</a>) Ramban offers what he considers the best interpretation, namely, that the amount of years was extended from what was prophesied, due to the sins of the Israelites:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועוד אני אומר כי הפשט המחוור מן הכל הוא שנאמר כי הגזרה היתה ארבע מאות שנה מן היום ההוא כאשר הזכרנו והשלשים שנה האלו הם תוספת עליהם בעון הדור ההוא כי אם נגזר על האדם בחטאו גלות וענוי שנה או שנתים והוא יוסיף על חטאתו פשע בהם יוסיפו עליו שבע על חטאתיו וגלות ויסורין כהנה וכהנה שאין ענשו הראשון הבטחה לו שלא יענש בעון שיעשה והנה היה על אברהם אבינו גזרה שיהיה זרעו גר בארץ לא להם ארבע מאות שנה ושלא ישובו הנה עד דור רביעי כי לא שלם עון האמרי ולא היתה לו הבטחה רק באחרי כן יצאו ברכוש גדול והוא מיד או מופלג כמה וגם הוא על תנאי כמו שאמר וגם את הגוי אשר יעבודו דן אנכי ואחרי כן יצאו ברכוש גדול שיעמיד בדין את הגוי אם עשו כראוי לישראל לפי מעשיהם ולפי הנגזר עליהם ועוד שאין שום הבטחה שלא יגרום החטא לבטלה אלא במקום שבועה\n  ומן הידוע שהיו ישראל במצרים רעים וחטאים מאד ובטלו גם המילה דכתיב וימרו בי ולא אבו לשמוע אלי איש את שקוצי עיניהם לא השליכו ואת גלולי מצרים לא עזבו ואומר לשפוך חמתי עליהם בתוך ארץ מצרים וגו' וכתיב והסירו את אלהים אשר עבדו אבותיכם בעבר הנהר ובמצרים ועבדו את ה' ועל כן ארך גלותם שלשים שנה</p>\n  \n  <p>I maintain further that the most lucid explanation of all is that we say that the decree of the four-hundred year period, [as mentioned in Genesis 15:13], is to be reckoned from that day [of the \"covenant between the parts],\" as we have mentioned, and these additional thirty additional years — [in Verses 40-41 here] — were due to the sin of that generation. If exile and affliction are decreed upon a person for a year or two because of his sin and he will fully continue to add to his transgressions, exile and visitation of seven times the original magnitude will be his lot; his first punishment is no guarantee against his being punished for the additional sin he committed. Now it had been decreed upon Abraham that his children would be strangers in a land not their own  [for a period of] four hundred years, and that they will not return until the fourth generation, <em>for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full</em>. Abraham was given no assurance [concerning the precise ending of the exile], except in the promise, <em>And afterward they will come out with great substance</em>, and that [\"afterward\"] could be immediately [after the four-hundred year period] or some subsequent time. Even that promise was given conditionally, as He said, <em>And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge; and afterward shall they come out with great substance,</em> meaning that He will bring them to judgement to determine whether they did to Israel in accordance with their deeds and as was decreed upon them. Besides, no assurance is immune to to annulment because of subsequent sin unless it is accompanied by an oath. And it is a known fact that the Israelites in Egypt were wicked and exceeding sinners, having also done away with circumcision, as it is written, <em>And they rebelled against Me, and would not hearken unto Me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt; then I said I would pour out My fury upon them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</em> Again it says, <em>And put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye the Eternal.</em> it was for this reason that He prolonged their exile for thirty years. (Chavel translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like Ramban, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abarbanel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14386&st=&pgnum=105\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus Chapter 12</a>) also first mentions the possibility that the four hundred years told to Abraham was imprecise, and then suggests that it was supposed to be four hundred years but thirty years were added on due to the sins of the Israelites.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Caspi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Joseph Ibn Kaspi</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9459&st=&pgnum=192&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a>) states that the four hundred and thirty years must be a reference to the beginning of Abraham's sojourning, i.e. when he first left his birthplace. He appears to also suggest that four hundred and thirty might not actually be a precise number, and he seems to allude to the fact that the four hundred years mentioned in the prophecy are to be counted from Isaac's birth. Elsewhere (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9459&st=&pgnum=59\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Genesis 15:13</a>) he simply writes that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ibn_Ezra\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Abraham Ibn Ezra</a> has already explained this. In his supercommentary to Ibn Ezra's commentary to Genesis 15:13 he explains that the Israelites were only in Egypt for two hundred and ten years, and the four hundred years is from Isaac's birth.</p>\n\n<p>However, Ibn Ezra's <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58145&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Genesis 15:13</a> is a bit cryptic. He writes simply \"עד סוף זה הקץ מהיום\" which could mean that the four hundred years start from the day of the prophecy. In his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58145&st=&pgnum=73\" rel=\"noreferrer\">commentary to Exodus 12:40</a> Ibn Ezra deals with the timeline at greater length. He makes the exact argument mentioned in the question here — that by adding up the ages of Kehat, Amram, and Moses at the time of the Exodus you can't get to more than three hundred and fifty years — and concludes that the four hundred years are from Isaac's birth, while the four hundred and thirty years are from when Abraham first left his homeland at the age of seventy, five years prior to the prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>It is perhaps noteworthy that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Septuagint</a> have a slightly different version of Exodus 12:40, in which the four hundred and thirty years are explicitly stated to include the time in Egypt <em>and</em> the time in Canaan. This could either be indicative of an alternate text, or it could be a \"correction\" in order to reconcile the timeline. Indeed, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Talmud</a> (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=9&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Megillah 9a</a>) claims that the Sages who translated the Torah into Greek added in the words \"and other lands\" to this verse. This fact is noted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_David_Luzzatto\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Samuel David Luzzato</a> (commentary to Exodus 12:40) who notes that most of the later scholars agree that  this was a \"correction\" (to reconcile the timeline) rather than a true alternate text.</p>\n\n<p>Elsewhere (commentary to Exodus 6:20) Luzzato argues that the Israelites <em>were</em> actually in Egypt for four hundred and thirty years. He bases this on the fact that the verse in <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0403.htm#28\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 3:28</a> states that there were eight thousand six hundred members of the Kehat family in the wilderness, which would be impossible if the generational sequence of Kehat > Amram > Moses is taken at face value. Rather, there must have been unnamed generations, and those generations account for the four hundred and thirty years in Egypt. He then quotes another suggestion, that the lifespans mentioned for Levi, Kehat, and Amram are actually the number of years until the families split off into separate groups. The number given for Amram is one hundred and thirty seven (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm#20\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 6:20</a>), the number for Kehat is one hundred and thirty three (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm#18\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 6:18</a>), and the number for Levi is one hundred and thirty seven (<a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm#17\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 6:17</a>). If you add the seventeen years that Jacob was still alive in Egypt, you get four hundred and twenty four years (137 + 133 + 137 + 17 = 424), which is approximately the four hundred and thirty years mentioned.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a quick summary of Luzzatos's view from the introduction to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=h30JjwEACAAJ&dq=shadal%20on%20exodus&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjR6-HpqeTfAhWmmeAKHdU5DbUQ6AEIKjAA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Daniel Klein's translation</a> of Luzzato's commentary:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fUv0W.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/fUv0W.jpg\" alt=\"Image of Klein's summary\"></a> </p>\n\n<p>Of all the commentators to address this issue, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gersonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> probably dealt with it at greatest length. He introduced several novel points. First, he criticized those who dated the four hundred years from Isaac's birth, because they had to then accept the account in Seder Olam that explained how the Covenant Between the Parts took place when Abraham was seventy. Ralbag rejects this as untenable because it is inconceivable that Abraham would have gone back to Haran after God had commanded him to go to relocate to Canaan. Furthermore, Ralbag assumes that the covenant would have had to occur much closer to Isaac's birth because Abraham hadn't yet despaired of having children thirty years prior to Isaac's birth. And he assumes that this is connected to Sarah giving Hagar to Abraham which was around fifteen years before Isaac's birth.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps uniquely among the commentators, Ralbag argued that the four hundred years began with Jacob's birth. This was because Jacob was the first of Abraham's progeny to sojourn in an ongoing manner. Moreover, Ralbag also uniquely argues that the four hundred years were <em>not</em> actually fulfilled, even counting from well before the actual stay in Egypt. Instead he argues that God shortened the time period in the merit of the Patriarchs as is implied in the account in Exodus (presumably <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0202.htm#24\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2:24</a>). In fact, Ralbag uses this as a further critique of the other views, as according to them the full four hundred years were fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Ralbag also explains <em>why</em> the number four hundred and thirty differs from the number four hundred. He argues (as did Rashbam) that the verse should be read as if there was an additional word \"until\" (as we find in other instances) in which case the verse is simply saying that it occurred four hundred and thirty years after a certain point, rather than that there were four hundred and thirty years of the prophesied hardships. </p>\n\n<p>Ralbag presents two options as to what that certain point was: either Isaac's birth, or the prophecy itself. Thus, the amount of time actually spent in Egypt was either two hundred and forty years or two hundred and twenty five years (430 - 130 - 60 = 240 or 430 - 130 - 60 - 15 = 225).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Commentary to Genesis 15:13</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ארבע מאות שנה.</strong> ר\"ל עד סוף ארבע מאות שנה מעת הולד יעקב שהיה הראשון מהגרים מזרעו בארץ לא להם גרות מתמיד והנה מהר הש\"י את הקץ כמו ששים שנה אם היה שלא ישבו ישראל במצרים כי אם מאתים ועשר שנה כמו שאמרו רז\"ל ואפשר שיאמר אומר שהיה מושב בני ישראל שם מאתים ושבעים שנה וזה כי קהת אפשר שהיה כמו בן שתי שנים בבואו למצרים ואפשר שאחר זה הזמן ק\"צ שנה הוליד עמרם שהוא בן קהת את משה והנה אי אפשר שנאמר שהיה זה הקץ מעת הולד יצחק לפי שלא ישלם לנו הקץ שזכר בפרשת בא והוא ארבע מאות ושלשים שנה וזה כי אי אפשר לנו שנאמר שזאת הנבואה היתה קודם הולד יצחק שלשים שנה לפי שאברם יצא מחרן כ\"ה שנה קודם הולד יצחק וזאת הנבואה היתה בהכרח אחר בא אברם לארץ כנען בעת שהתחיל אברם להתיאש מלהיות לו זרע ולזה אמר ואנכי הולך ערירי וידמה שזאת הנבואה היתה סמוך לנתינת הגר לאברם לאשה ומה שאמר בעל סדר עולם שאחר זאת הנבואה שב אברם לחרן ועמד שם ה' שנים כדי לכוון החשבון הנזכר בפרשת בא הוא בלתי נראה לנו כי לא נתיאש אברם מלהיות לו זרע עד היותו בן שמנים וחמש שנה שישבו עשר שנים בארץ כנען ולזה השתדלה אז שרה לקחת בזה עצה וזה ממה שיראה ממנו שיהיה אמרו ואנכי הולך ערירי סביב הזמן ההוא ועם זה הנה לא תמצא שיצא אברם מארץ כנען אשר צוהו השם יתע' לשבת בה אם לא לסבה חזקה כמו הרעב הכבד כי היה בזולת זה עובר מצות הש\"י ולזה לא יתכן שנאמר ששב לחרן ועמד שם חמש שנים וג\"כ הנה הכתוב ספרי שכשהיו באים לארץ כנען באו לחרן וישבו שם וזה לאות כי לא באו מארץ כנען לחרן ועוד שאם היה הענין כן לא מהר השם יתע' את הקץ כשהוציא ישראל ממצרים והנראה ממה שנאמר שם שכבר מהר להם את הקץ למען בריתו עם האבות והנראה בעיני שהקץ היה מעת שנולד יעקב עד מלאת ת' שנה ומהר הש\"י את הקץ שלשים שנה מפני חוזק העבודה הקשה אשר היו המצרים מעבידים את ישראל כאמרו ויאנחו בני ישראל מן העבודה ויזעקו ומנין ת\"ל שנה היו מעת היות לאברהם זרע ר\"ל מעת שנולד יצחק כי ביצחק נקרא לו זרע וממנו יהיה גם כן הזרע הגולה בארץ לא לו ויהיה מושב בני ישראל במצרים מאתים וארבעים שנה וזה נאות מאד בזה הענין ואפשר ג\"כ שיהיה מנין ת\"ל מעת הגעת הנבואה הזאת לאברם שהוא לפי הנראה בלתי פחות מט\"ו שנה קודם הולד יצחק וזה שאחר זה נתנה שרה שפחתה לאברם והיה אז לאברהם שמונים וחמש שנים והנה מהר הש\"י את הקץ לפי זאת ההנחה כמו מ\"ה שנים ובעבור חטא המרגלים נתאחרו במדבר מ' שנה ונשארו ה' שנים שנכנסו לארץ קדם הקץ וזה נאות מאד כמו שנבאר בג\"ה במה שיבא ר\"ל שלא הגיע עדיין קץ כניסתם לארץ אחרי מות משה ולזה היו צריכים שיהיו באופן מהשלמות שתדבק בהם ההשגחה האלהית בדרך שינצחו מאומות ההם </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Four hundred years.</strong> Meaning to say, until the end of four hundred years from the time of Jacob's birth, as he was the first of the sojourners from [Abraham's] seed to sojourn ongoingly in a land not belonging to them. And behold God expedited the end by about sixty years, if [we assume that] the Israelites only dwelled in Egypt for two hundred and ten years, as the Sages say.                                                         </p>\n  \n  <p>And it is possible for someone to say that the Israelites dwelled there for two hundred and seventy years. And this is because Kehat was possibly around two years old when they came to Egypt, and it is possible that one hundred and ninety years after this Amram, who was the son of Kehat, begot Moses.  </p>\n  \n  <p>It is impossible to say that the end [of the four hundred years] was from Isaac's birth, because then the end time mentioned in <em>Parshat Bo</em>, which was four hundred and thirty years, cannot be completed. This is because Abraham left Haran twenty five years before Isaac was born and this prophecy had to have occurred after Abraham had come to the land of Canaan, at the time when Abraham began to give up on having children which is why he said \"I go childless\". And it would seem that this prophecy was near [the time of] the giving of Hagar to Abraham as a wife.</p>\n  \n  <p>And that which the author of <em>Seder Olam</em> said, that after this prophecy Abraham returned to Haran and stayed there for five years, in order to reconcile the calculation mentioned in <em>Parshat Bo</em>, does not seem correct to us. This is because Abraham did not give up on having children until he was eighty five years old, when he had lived in the land of Canaan for ten years, which is why Sarah then crafted the plan [for Abraham to marry Hagar]. This is because it would appear that his statement \"I go childless\" should have been around this time.</p>\n  \n  <p>Additionally, you don't find that Abraham left the land Canaan, which God had commanded him to dwell in, if not for a strong reason such as the harsh famine. For without this [strong reason] he would be violating the command of God. therefore it is not possible to say that he returned to Haran and stayed there for five years. And furthermore, the verse tells us that when they came to the land of Canaan they came to Haran and they dwelled there; this is to show that they did not come from the land of Canaan to Haran.</p>\n  \n  <p>Moreover, if this was the case [that the four hundred years started from the birth of Isaac] then God did not expedite the end when he took Israel out of Egypt, yet it appears from what is written there that he <em>did</em> expedite the end on account of His covenant with the Patriarchs.</p>\n  \n  <p>What appears to me is that the end is [calculated] from the time of Jacob's birth until the completion of four hundred years. And God expedited the end by thirty years because of the harshness of the difficult labor that the Egyptians forced upon the Israelites, as it says \"the Israelites sighed from the servitude and they cried out\". And the calculation of four hundred and thirty years was from the time that Abraham had a child, meaning from the time that Isaac was born, as with Isaac he was considered a child and from him as well were the descendants that were exiled in a land that was not his. And the dwelling of the Israelites in Egypt was two hundred and forty years, and this fits very nicely with this topic.</p>\n  \n  <p>And it is also possible that the calculation of four hundred and thirty years was from the time this prophecy came to Abraham, which appears to have been no less than fifteen years before Isaac was born. This is because after this [prophecy] Sarah gave her maidservant to Abraham, and Abraham was then eighty five years old. And God expedited the end, according to this assumption, by about forty five years. And due to the sin of the scouts they were delayed in the wilderness for forty years, which left them entering the land five years before the end [of the four hundred years]. And this fits very well, as we will God-willing explain in what comes, namely, that the end for them to enter the land had not yet come after Moses died, and because of this they needed to be in a state of perfection so that the Divine Providence would cling to them in a manner that would be victorious over those nations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Commentary to Exodus 12:40</strong> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>ומושב בני ישראל אשר ישבו במצרים שלשים שנה וארבע מאות שנה.</strong> תחסר מלת עד וככה ארבעים יכנו ר\"ל שהרצון בו עד ארבעים כמו שנבאר שם בג\"ה והנה הרצון בזה הוא שישראל ישבו במצרים עד ארבע מאות ושלשים שנה ולא פירש מאי זה עת התחיל זה החשבון והנראה בעיני שזה החשבון מתחיל אם מעת שנולד יצחק אם מעת נבואת בין הבתרים כמו שבארנו בפרשת לך לך והנאות בעיני בזה שהחשבון הזה מתחיל מעת נבואת בין הבתרים והיתה נבואת בין הבתרים כמו ט\"ו שנים קודם שנולד יצחק ויהיה זה החשבון מתחיל מעת הנבואה ההיא והנה ארבע מאות שנה שאמר השם יתע' לאברהם התחילו מעת שנולד יעקב כי הוא היה הראשון שגר בארץ לא לו גרות מתמיד והנה יצאו ישראל ממצרים קודם הקץ שנאמר לאברהם כמו ארבעים וחמש שנה והוא מבואר שאם היו ישראל שלמים היו נוחלים הארץ תכף צאתם קודם הקץ ולזה שלח משה מרגלים לתור את ארץ כנען זמן מועט אחר צאתם ממצרים אבל הטו עונותיהם ונתאחרו שם במדבר ארבעים שנה ואח\"כ ירשו את הארץ על ידי יהושע והנה עכ\"פ נתקיימה להם ירושת הארץ אם בבא הקץ שיעד השם יתע' לאברהם אם קדם לו זמן מועט כמו שיתבאר מדברינו במה שיבא ר\"ל שכבר נחלו את הארץ קודם הקץ</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>And the dwelling of the Israelites that they dwelled in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.</strong> The word \"until\" is missing. And so too \"forty he shall strike him\", meaning that the intent of it is <em>until</em> [but not including] forty, as we will God-willing explain there. And the intent of this is that Israel dwelled in Egypt until four hundred and thirty years, but it doesn't explain from what time this calculation began.</p>\n  \n  <p>What appears to me is that this calculation began either from the time of the birth of Isaac or from the time of the prophecy between the parts, as we explained in <em>Parshat Lech Lecha</em>. And what is fitting in my eyes regarding this is that it began from the time of the prophecy between the parts. And the prophecy between the parts was about fifteen years before Isaac was born. And this calculation began from that prophecy.</p>\n  \n  <p>And the four hundred years that God said to Abraham began from the time of Jacob's birth, for he was the first one who ongoingly sojourned in a land not his. And Israel left Egypt before the end [of the four hundred years] that was said to Abraham by about forty five years. And it is clear that had Israel been perfect they would have inherited the land [of Canaan] immediately after leaving [Egypt], before the end [of the four hundred years]. And that is why Moses sent scouts to tour the land of Canaan a short time after they left Egypt. But their sins diverted them and they were delayed there in the wilderness for forty years. And after that they inherited the land through Joshua. But despite this their inheritance of the land was still fulfilled, whether with the coming of the end that God had promised Abraham or slightly earlier, as will be explained with our words in what is to come. I.e. they already inherited the land before the end [of the four hundred years].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A final noteworthy point is that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistle_to_Yemen\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Epistle to Yemen</a> — <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41576&st=&pgnum=101\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Iggeret Teiman</a>) explains that although the correct calculation of the four hundred years <em>ended up</em> being from Isaac's birth, the prophecy itself was vague and the calculation <em>could have</em> been from some other point, and various people <em>did</em> mistakenly calculate it until the correct calculation became known through Moses taking them out of Egypt four hundred years after Isaac's birth.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Before I actually answer your question, I'd just like to make one note. Jochebed, our Sages tell us, was 130 years old when Moses was born (Numbers Rabbah 13:21). She was born as the Israelites crossed into Egypt. Her son, Moses, as you mentioned, was 80 when they left. Thus, the Israelites were in Egypt for 210 years. This still is less than 400.</p>\n\n<p>Now, there's also a third number for how long the Israelites were in Egypt: 430 years (Exodus 12:31). So how could the Israelites be in Egypt for 210 years, 400 years, and 430 years at the same time?</p>\n\n<p>The answer is that they are counting from different time periods. 430 is counting from the Covenant Between the Parts (the event in which the verse in Genesis 15 appears), 400 is counting from Isaac's birth, and 210 is counting from when Jacob's family actually entered Egypt. The calculations are shown <a href=\"http://www.betemunah.org/exodus.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, God still took the Israelites out of Egypt exactly when he told Abraham he would. Note that a few verses after the one we've been discussing God tells Abraham that the fourth generation will leave Egypt. Levi was the first generation, his son Kohath the second, his son Amram the third, and his son Moses the fourth.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the question still remains: <em>why</em> did God not leave them in for the full 400 (430) years? There are two approaches, both recorded in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/757/9682\">this answer</a> to a highly related question, that presupposes what I'm about to tell you. </p>\n\n<p>The first is that the verse is misleading. The antecedent of the promise of 400 years is not the immediately preceding clause of being enslaved, but rather the first clause, that they would be strangers in a land not theirs. Indeed, as the Land of Israel was still called the Land of Canaan at that point and was not yet given to the Israelites, Isaac was born in a land not his.</p>\n\n<p>The second approach is that the Israelites indeed were in Egypt for 400 years' worth of slavery. But the verse is referring to 400 years' worth of <em>normal</em> slavery. The Egyptians worked them so hard, the 400 years were \"compressed\" into only 210.</p>\n\n<p>There's a third approach I've heard, referenced in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/5642/400-years-in-egypt\">this question</a>: the Israelites actually <em>were</em> in Egypt for 400 years. As you mentioned, the numbers don't seem to work out. For a different reason, Samuel David Luzzato, who posed this theory, has an issue with the Levites' timeline, and so he poses the otherwise difficult theory that there were generations not mentioned between Levi and Moses (cited in Hebrew <a href=\"http://tora.us.fm/tnk1/jdl/MefarsheyTanach002-06.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, on his comments to verse 20).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Both the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritan_Pentateuch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Greek Septuagint</a> explicitly state that the time span of 430 years covers the entire period of wandering, in both Egypt and Canaan :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong><em>Exodus</em> 12</strong> according to the <a href=\"http://www.stepbible.org/?q=version=SPE|reference=Exodus.12:40-41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Samaritan Pentateuch</a> :\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> Now the sojourning of the children of Israel and fathers of them, who dwelt in Canaan and in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the selfsame day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD went out from the land of Egypt.</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>Exodus</em> 12</strong> according to the <a href=\"http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Exodus/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Greek Septuagint</a> :\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <sup><strong>40</strong></sup> And the sojourning of the children of Israel, while they sojourned in the land of Egypt and the land of Chanaan, was four hundred and thirty years. <sup><strong>41</strong></sup> And it came to pass after the four hundred and thirty years, all the forces of the Lord came forth out of the land of Egypt by night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since from Abraham's receiving the prophecy to the entrance into Egypt 215 years have elapsed (see Alex's impressive answer), which represent precisely half of the total figure, the conclusion immediately follows.</p>\n\n<p>This is then further supported by adding the ages of all those that have lived in Egypt (again, see Alex's beautiful answer), which add up to exactly 424 years. Since people beget children neither when they're in diapers, nor when they're on their deathbed, the most intuitively tempting solution would be to cut the value roughly in half, yielding almost the same result as before.</p>\n\n<p>This particular reading provides us with the following quasi-symmetrical time frame:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li><strong>75</strong> years from Abraham's birth until his entrance into Canaan;</li>\n  <li><strong>430</strong> years of wandering in the lands of Canaan and Egypt, split evenly between the two;</li>\n  <li><strong>480</strong> years from the Exodus out of Egypt until the construction of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon's_Temple\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Solomon's Temple</a>;</li>\n  <li><strong>430</strong> years during which the Temple stood;</li>\n  <li><strong>70</strong> years of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Babylonian Captivity</a>.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would also like to point out that these two numbers, 215 and 430, are decimal approximations of duodecimal quantities; basically, if people were to count in base twelve rather than base ten, then 216 and 432 would represent an eighth and a quarter, respectively, of a thousand, or 12<sup>3</sup> = 1728.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the same amount of time, 430 years, also coincides with the total duration of Solomon's Temple, since the reigns of all kings starting with that of its builder add up to 433 years, and its construction commenced near the beginning his fourth year as ruler of Jerusalem, see <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.6.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Kings 6:1</a>. There is also a numerical niceness about these 430 years being followed by a span of exactly seven decades, so as to ultimately yield a very round period of precisely half a millennium.</p>\n\n<p>A similar period of time, of 7 x 62 = 434 years, also appears in the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.9.25-26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book of Daniel</a>, where, once again, the connection to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Second Temple</a> is made evident.</p>\n\n<p>As for the time span between the Exodus and the First Temple, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretic_Text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Masoretic</a> reads 480 years, whereas the <a href=\"http://www.ecmarsh.com/lxx/Kings%20III/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Septuagint</a> of <strong>1 Kings 6</strong> has only 440. Usually, this discrepancy is explained in terms of the 40 years between the Exodus and the entrance into the Holy Land, but, in light of the above, I interpret it once again as a decimalization of formerly duodecimal quantities, since the 480 is an easily recognizable multiple of twelve for those commonly using base ten, whereas the 440 is an <em>upper</em> rounding of the 432 mentioned earlier, sandwiched between two <em>lower</em> roundings of the same initially dozenal amount.</p>\n\n<p>As for the 424 years mentioned above, it is possible to argue, based on a certain careful reading of the <a href=\"http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis_11:32-12:4&version=KJV&interface=print\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Book of Genesis</a>, that there were 425 years from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genesis_flood_narrative\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noah's Flood</a> to Abraham's receiving the prophecy.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I consider Biblical chronology, in all its three well-established historical forms (Masoretic, Samaritan, and Septuagintal), as nothing less than an utterly sublime numerical symphony.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this answer will help provide the reader with some deeper meaning, understanding, insight, and perspective into the topic at hand, since things seldom seem to make any sense when divorced or viewed in isolation from their much larger context, but when all pieces of the puzzle are finally fitted together, the end result is deeply rewarding, and well worth all the effort.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was it customary for there to be an annual lamentation for someone's death, e.g. the daughter of Jephthah? Details as to her mourning process?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Judges 11, the overzealous (or prideful) short-reigned judge of Israel, Jephthah, makes the rash vow to G-d that if he is victorious against the Ammorites and safely returns home, then he will sacrifice the first thing he sees in the doorway in Judges 11:30-31:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said: 'If Thou wilt indeed\n  deliver the children of Ammon into my hand, 31 then it shall be, that\n  whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of my house to meet me, when I\n  return in peace from the children of Ammon, it shall be the LORD'S,\n  and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, that \"whatsoever\" is \"whomever\" because his daughter is the first that comes forth to meet him. (You can almost imagine an excited, eager girl anxiously waiting her father's return, running to embrace him). Sad, indeed. </p>\n\n<p>Now there is somewhat a debate of whether he carried out this vow, but I think the general consensus is that he did in order to stay true to his vow (and his daughter did so knowingly and willingly). Rashi, quoting from the Medrash Rabbah, denotes a graphic scene wherein Jephthah was inflicted with a deadly diseases that deteriorated all his limbs until they became detached (as punishment for not consulting with the high priest to annul this thoughtless vow). But this isn't the thrust of my question.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, as we continue reading, his daughter is unbelievably obedient. Judges 11:37-40 describes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>37 And she said unto her father: 'Let this thing be done for me: let\n  me alone <strong>two months</strong>, that I may depart and go down upon the <strong>mountains</strong>,\n  and <strong>bewail my virginity, I and my companions</strong>.' 38 And he said: 'Go.'\n  And he sent her away for two months; and she departed, she and her\n  companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains. 39 And it\n  came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned unto her\n  father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed; and\n  she had not known man. <strong>And it was a custom in Israel, that the\n  daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the daughter of Jephthah the\n  Gileadite four days in a year.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now in regards to my questions: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Anyone can understand why she would need a moment to \"compose\"\n(definitely an understatement) herself, and needing a few days to\nliving out her last few days. But <strong>why two months?</strong> Is that arbitrary\nor was that a <strong>customary mourning period?</strong></li>\n<li>I can certainly understand why she would want to say her final\ngoodbyes to her friends, but was it <strong>customary for women to mourn\ntheir virginity before they lost their virginity?</strong> Like before they\ngot married? Also, she wasn't losing her virginity... <em>but</em> <em>she was going\nto be sacrificed</em> <strong>Clarification?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Why the mountains?</strong> I'm assuming: a) practicality -- it's nearby; b)\nremoteness -- it gives an atmosphere to contemplate/reflect/mourn;\nc) sacred ground -- mountains often were a place to communicate with\nG-d. Do you think any of these were the reasons?</li>\n<li><strong>Why did this become an annual event for the local Gilead young\nwomen?</strong> What did they <strong>do exactly</strong>? Do we know h<strong>ow long this continued</strong>? Do we have <strong>any evidence</strong> of this event?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I recognize that most of these answers are lost to history, but just in case, I thought I'd throw it out there, and if there are any rabbinical/scholarly commentary that address any of these questions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I believe answers your questions are all found in the <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Judges.11.39?lang=bi&with=Metzudat%20David&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos David</a>.</p>\n<p>The first thing to note is that based on the explanation of the the commentary.

    "content": "# If a woman's period lasts longer than 7 days naturally, do the days after day 7 count as the monthly Niddah, or a separate uncleanness?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm sorry that question title is so long winded! To explain, the Torah says the woman is in the state of niddah for 7 days once she starts her period. The custom today is to add another 7 days before the woman can become clean in the Mikveh. The Torah also says if the period lasts beyond the normal length of her period, then throughout the time she is having an unclean discharge she will be as if she's in niddah.  However, what if the woman's period is naturally longer than 7 days? </p>\n\n<p>If one's period has lasted for 8 days since her body got on a regular cycle. It is not an extra day, it isn't abnormal bleeding. She just typically still notices blood- just a little bit, but it's still blood- 8 days after her cycle starts. </p>\n\n<p>If a woman's normal period is longer than 7 days, do the days after day 7 count as the monthly niddah, or extra uncleanness? And just to be clear, how does the woman count the 7 days after her period if the period normally goes longer than 7 days?</p>\n\n<p>Thank you! :) I'm new at this, so I apologize if this is a dumb question. Just trying to learn!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Torah says that a woman becomes a Niddah for seven days from whenever she starts her period. The rabbis later added that in order to purify herself, she must wait seven \"clean\" days after she stops bleeding (starting at least 4 or 5 days after the beginning of her period). In your case (which is not all that uncommon), you would simply start counting the clean days immediately after the eight days of bleeding. So while in theory other women might be able to become pure after a minimum of 12 days, it would take you 15 (which might cause fertility issues, which is another question).</p>\n\n\n",

I've done a bit of research and I've found some Tunisian haggadot with a similar (but not identical) text.  Arabic spelling in Hebrew is not very consistent, so the search function at hebrewbooks is not quite so useful as I had hoped.  My question is, what is the exact text that Jo Amar is using?  Are there any digitized online haggadot that include it?  My manual search of hebrewbooks haggadot turned up empty.

Even Abraham was\n  not commanded to KILL Isaac, and indeed according to the commentators,\n  Yiftach did not actually KILL his daughter. Rather, she was condemned\n  to remain unmarried in a state of permanent HISBODEDUS (isolation) and\n  divine service except for the few days of the year when her maiden\n  friends would come to comfort her (see Metzudos David on v 37 and\n  RaDaK on v 40).</p>\n  \n  <p>The Midrash brings out the absurdity and criminality of Yiftach's\n  condemning his only child to a life of celibacy, thereby destroying\n  the continuity of his own line. Not only was Yiftach criticized but so\n  too were all the rabbis and scholars of his time and even Pinchas the\n  High Priest (who according to tradition was still alive despite the\n  passage of over 300 years since he entered the Land with Joshua).</p>\n  \n  <p>Through a mixture of high principles and pride, Yiftach would not go\n  to Pinchas to nullify his vow, although the HALACHAH specifically\n  permits this. Likewise Pinchas would not go to Yiftach to nullify the\n  vow, reasoning that his own status as Priest required that Yiftach\n  should come to him.

Moreover, Chana, who\n  said, \"She made a vow and said, Hashem ... if you take note of the\n  suffering of your maidservant ... then I shall give him to Hashem all\n  the days of his life\" (Shmuel I 1:11) -- did she sacrifice her son\n  before G-d? She [Yiftach's daughter] said all of these things to him,\n  but he did not listen to her.

About him it says, \"A pauper who robs the destitute\n  is like a torrential rain, which leaves no food.\" (Mishlei 28:3) \"A\n  pauper who robs the destitute\" -- this refers to Yiftach who was a\n  pauper in Torah, like the stump of a sycamore tree, who would rob the\n  destitute, as is says, \"[The men of Gilad] would say to him: Now say\n  'shibolet,' but he said, 'sibolet' -- for he could not enunciate\n  properly, and he would slaughter them.\" Therefore, \"like a torrential\n  rain, which leaves no food\" -- he had one who could release his vow,\n  but \"leaves no food\" -- G-d hid the halacha from them, so that they\n  would not find an opening to release him of his vow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And each Mitsva you make adds a credit, and help him to be called Tsadik in such a manner.</p>\n\n<p>A salved B, and B made Maassim Tovim, the MT are as a wish of A, so A has a Tsadik part in his personality. This tsadik part was potential and became effective through B.</p>\n\n<p>I am afraid that this answer seems strange, but for me it's true. The more you make mitsvot and Kiddush Hashem, the more you give them Kappara.</p>\n\n\n",

Where did these different opinions start? I understand that all of them are different calculations for when three stars come out, but why do different communities calculate that differently?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>On a Torah level (mideoraysa), the appearance of three medium stars defines the onset of night: Shema may be recited from then onward and motzei shabbos occurs then. The most widely accepted views for when this occurs range from when the sun in 6.2 to 6.55 degrees below the horizon (though a view common in the US and UK requires waiting until this sun is 7.08 degrees below the horizon). This is not a set number of minutes, but varies according to latitude and season, among other factors.</p>\n\n<p>However, for Krias Shema, the Shulchan Aruch, following Rabbeinu Yonah, requires waiting until three small stars have emerged. As R. Eliezer Melamed writes in his <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-25-05/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halacha</a>:</p>\n\n<p>“The time to recite the evening Keriat Shema is “when you lie down” – when people lie on their beds to sleep, which starts when it gets dark. The Chachamim established a sign for the beginning of this time, when three medium-sized stars can be seen in the sky. This is because large stars are also visible during the day or at bein hashemashot (twilight). However, when three medium-size stars (according to the naked eye) emerge after them, it is a sign that night has begun (HaZemanim BaHalachah chapters 49-50). This time is called tzeit hakochavim. To avoid error, and to prevent mistaking big stars for medium ones, the Rishonim write that one must wait until he sees three small stars appear in the sky (Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah; Shulchan Aruch 235:1).”</p>\n\n<p>This is slightly earlier than the requirement of “three small stars in one place” for motzei Shabbos. Myzmanim does not give a time for “three small stars” (it uses 8.5 degrees as the default time for motzei shabbos/“three small stars in one place”), but R. Moshe Sokoloff <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/893735/rabbi-moshe-sokoloff/how-to-calculate-when-shabossim-taanaisim-end/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reports</a> that the person behind Myzmanim agreed that this should be around 8 degrees and that mirrors the ruling in contemporary works such as R. Dovid Borztyn’s Zmanim Kehilchasam. Others are comfortable with earlier times (either because they use an earlier time for three medium stars or because they believe there is less reason to wait for three small stars nowadays, when the potential for confusion has diminished due to our reliance on accurate clocks and calendars). As R. Eliezer Melamed writes, “However, so that people will not come to err, the Shulchan Aruch rules that they must wait until three small stars emerge, meaning, another few minutes. Some say that nowadays, since we use clocks, there is no need to wait. See HaZemanim BaHalachah 51, note 3.” </p>\n\n<p>Some who hold this view sanction reciting shema from as early as 6.2 degrees onwards, though 6.45 degrees is more common (i.e. the time given as “end of ordained fasts according to R' Tukaccinsky” on Myzmanim). </p>\n\n<p>As far as motzei shabbos times are concerned (where we wait for \"three small stars in one place\"), Dr. William Gewirtz <a href=\"http://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/798332/dr-wiiliam-gewirtz/zemannim-on-the-introduction-of-new-constructs-in-halakhah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>, \" 8.5 degrees is the most common current measurement for hashekhah, the requisite level of darkness15 that equates to the conclusion of Shabbat according to the ge’onim\" and \" With a few exceptions, the opinions of a vast majority of posekim equate to a point less than or equal to 8.5 degrees, with almost all falling in a range from approximately 7.5 to 9.3 degrees. Note that using 7.5 to 9.3 degrees for the conclusion of Shabbat, as opposed to approximately 6 degrees, parallels the extension from three medium stars to three small (and adjacent) stars.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara (Nazir 59a) learns from this that the issur is only for a man to dress up like a woman in order to mingle with women, or for a woman to dress like a man to mingle with men.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Gemara in Makkos (20b) and Shabbos (94a) regarding plucking white hairs from amidst black ones seems to imply that one can violate lo silbash without having intent to mingle with the other gender - only that it's something that the other gender would do in terms of appearance. This also seems to be how the Gemara earlier in Nazir (39a) seems to hold, with regard to men shaving hair from underarms and beis ha'ervah.</p>\n\n<p>My question is twofold.

    "content": "# Re-use of items used in service of another deity upon conversion\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am in the process of converting to Judaism from being a hellenic pagan (yes, there is a small revivalist movement, and yes, I am deeply grateful I was led away from that path) and I had a specific question about transferable practices and items. </p>\n\n<p>As part of my former path, I had covered my hair for years, and adopted a much more modest dress code. Although this practice is actually part of what led me away from paganism, I am concerned about how to fulfill the modesty requirements if I initially adopted the practice in service to another god. Since committing to the conversion process, I have stopped covering my hair out of respect because I did not want there to be any confusion about why I was doing it (either for myself or for others). I would, however, like to resume modest dress including hair covering if possible. Can I resume the practice, and if so, when? Also, what is the status of the scarves I used to cover with? </p>\n\n<p>So far, I have found information on items used as sacrifices to idols, but that is the closest I've come to finding an answer. My difficulty here is that the scarves themselves were never used as sacrifices, but rather as part of a duty. They are still perfectly usable and in good condition, and they were never \"given,\" so to speak. I also never had a physical rendering of an idol at any point (I am not sure that matters, but mention it in case that distinction does matter.) </p>\n\n<p>Would it be permissible to use them, and if so, what would I need to do to them, if anything? If not, what would be the most appropriate thing to do with them? </p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Background information--</p>\n\n<p>Here is a link that explains some of the background of it: <a href=\"http://lady-magique-et-lady-chance.tumblr.com/post/145507542051/veiling-and-binding\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://lady-magique-et-lady-chance.tumblr.com/post/145507542051/veiling-and-binding</a>. I avoided too much description here because I wasn't sure if giving that kind of detail would be problematic. As you'll see from the link, it was related to hair binding, and so if I should get rid of my scarves, I should honestly get rid of my hair ties as well. The scarves themselves weren't specially designed for the purpose, contained no unique imagery or symbols, and were not offerings. I chose scarves over simple braids because I liked the added privacy and because it was specifically a devotion to Hestia (modesty is one of her attributes): <a href=\"http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Hestia.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/Hestia.html</a>. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The OP asks if it is proper to continue to adhere to a lifestyle of modest custom (women's dress code; specifically: covering the hair) even though she once did so as a duty to a false god. (revivalist Hellenic Paganism)</p></li>\n<li><p>The OP then asks about being allowed to keep/use scarves which were once used to cover her hair, in these practices of modesty, in service to a false god. (as above)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>2b. The OP (Rachael) is currently converting to Judaism. Welcome, much success!:) </p>\n\n<p>Answer to # 1 :</p>\n\n<p>Although the Torah says: \"...\"Do not follow any of their (Gentile) traditions\" (Leviticus 18:3), that is only where the custom is irrational, specifically rooted in Gentile religion, or is forbidden or deemed immoral by the Torah. However, if the Gentile practice is rational (eat healthy etc.) it is permitted to copy them. (see Rav Sampson Raphael Hirsch; Horeb 505.)</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam generally explains this Mitzvah as an obligation for the Jew to be distinct and separate from the nations in our dress, and actions. Everyone should distinctly be able to tell we are Jews. (Hilchos A\"Z 11:1)</p>\n\n<p>Therefore: We must act as Jews and may (should) do rational things. The fact that some Gentiles also act rationally and correctly in their behavior as human beings does not force us to change. Just the opposite is true. We hope that all the nations of the world should be righteous and live rationally and correctly according to Torah values! Jews are after all, a light unto the nations.</p>\n\n<p>If so, a Jewish woman (and practicing convert to Judaism) should dress modestly in the way of \"tznius\". </p>\n\n<p>Besides, what is the alternative?? Would someone specifically suggest that Jewish women wear bikinis and mini-skirts, because some Gentiles suddenly decided to dress modestly??!! That would obviously be ridiculous!</p>\n\n<p>Revivalist Hellenic Paganism actually has no book of law or text of tradition. The general concept they have is to adhere to \"piety\". This is generally described as repaying kindness, having guests, and living in moderation etc. These are simply rational ideas sometimes taken from the Torah; or just described as \"being a good person\". The only mistake is that these Pagans believe these life rules to be the will of many gods who live on Mt. Olympus etc.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of being \"good\" or \"modest\" is not disqualified simply because these misguided people think \"the gods\" said so. :)</p>\n\n<p>As far as covering one's hair: Jewish women usually do not cover their hair if they are single. Married women do so.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, the general rule is: If it is general modesty, or Jewish tznius code, then it is obviously OK even if idolaters also do this. If it is a very specific way in modest dress, that is noticeably peculiar to a sect of idolaters, then a Jew should not imitate it. </p>\n\n<p>Answer to #2 :</p>\n\n<p>Moses told Pharoah that Pharoah would also send sacrifices with the Jews on his behalf when they left Egypt. (Ex. 10:25) This is one source where we see that a Gentile who recants his idolatrous belief, causes the idol to become permissible for use. Otherwise, how could Moses accept animals from Pharoah to sacrifice to G-d? The Egyptians worshiped animals. It must be that Pharoah, realizing that the Jewish G-d was real and his animals were not really gods, nullified the animals' idolatrous status by disbelieving in them. Then he gave them to Moses. At that point they were kosher.</p>\n\n<p>See also Talmud A\"Z 64a-b. The Gemara discusses that people who were in the conversion process were advised to sell any idolatrous items before becoming Jews so they could benefit from selling them. This is because converts obviously no longer believed in the false gods, so their idolatrous material was nullified and therefore permitted.(The thing is once they were Jews, they could no longer do this because it would look bad.) </p>\n\n<p>Also, please note: An idol worshipped by a Jew can never be nullified; only an idol worshipped by a Gentile can be nullified.</p>\n\n<p>But, a scarf worn to be modest, is not an idol or an item of idolatry, even if the person practiced modesty for the sake of a false god. So keeping it or selling it is certainly OK.</p>\n\n<p>However, if it is obvious that a piece of clothing is a uniform for that idolatrous group (nun's habit) it shouldn't be worn even if it is \"modest\" . :)</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helped. As always, consult your conversion Rav. Much Success!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>No way can items used for avodah zarah be used in any way, shape, or form.

After the interment and recitation of  <em>Kaddish</em>, the Rabbi and members of the community drifted away, leaving the school children and their supervising teachers to organize themselves into a choir whereupon, after an interval of about 10 minutes, they began to sing <em>sotto voce</em> a most beautiful lament. Although I can't be sure, I believe the choir sang in Hebrew. How and by whom they were taught this is not yet known to me. However, I just wonder if such an unusual turn of events, especially the choral singing, would be considered \"non-Kosher\" in a traditional Jewish funeral service. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sephardim following Ashkenazim in Halacha on modern issues\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that if there is no argument between the Remah and the Mechaber, then a Sephardi can follow Rav Moshe Feinstein for instance. </p>\n\n<p>How does it work?\nI try my best to strictly follow HaRav Ovadia Yosef, but there was a case when my shaver may not have conformed to what HaRav Ovadia writes, but it was okay according to Rav Willig and Rav Moshe Feinstein, I asked my Rav what to follow, he said that you can follow the Ashkenazim, is that because where there isn't a Machloket mentioned in the Shulchan Aruch, and only modern day, we can go along with who we like?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The simple halachic principle is that a Sepharadi should generally be following the opinion of Maran Hashulchan Aruch as the bnei edot hamizrach have accepted his teachings as the 'majority' halachic authority as Rav Ovadia puts it. In a case of a mitzvah deoraita, it would be correct for you to follow our 'chief halachic authority' as the Torah says we should do. </p>\n\n<p>For mitzvot derabannan, you are 100% allowed to be mekeil and follow other opinions, notably the Ashkenazi poskim. Obviously, following Maran is preferred but it's not necessary at all. </p>\n\n<p>And I say this is the general rule because there are quite a few exceptions with very good reasons. For example, Safek berachot lehakel does work against Maran according to Rav Ovadia who notes most exceptions where we don't follow Maran and follow/take into account other poskim e.g. Arizal, Ashkenazim and the reason why. (I.e.  Minhag avotenu, biyadenu?)</p>\n\n<p>Referring specifically to your shaver case, Maran obviously doesn't mention this modern day case. It's much preferable to follow Rav Ovadia as in many cases he applies modern day cases to Maran Hashulchan Aruch so it's best to read his teshuvot to see his source and reasonings. After all, shaving is mideoraita and we should follow our own rabbis (gedolim) as the Torah has commanded us even if he doesn't apply Maran to our modern times. </p>\n\n<p>However meikar Hadin there does seem to be room to be mekeil to follow the opinion of contemporary Ashkenazic poskim provided that they have strong foundations for how they rule which I'm sure they do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The general trend seems to be that Ashkenazi and Sepharadi Rabbis are okay with Sepharadim following Ashkenazi poskim in a question of doubt, or if there is wiggle room on the matter. An example of this would be while Ovadia Yosef might rule stringently on a matter, there are lots of Sepharadi Poskim who are lenient, they just aren't as publicized. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately the opposite is rarely true. I have only met one Rav who has actually told people to follow Sephardic Hachamim in questions of doubt.</p>\n\n\n",

He says at the end that there are some who are careful to wait 6 hours (like the Shulchan Arukh, Rambam and some other Rishonim) and that that is a good practice. But it seems according to the basic letter of the law (Ikkar haDin) that he accepts Tosfot's position. Any waiting could then be called a \"custom\" or a \"Chumra\" in a certain sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Yair Hoffman quotes the gemara Chullin 105a which gives the original halacha.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/373638/waiting-5-and-12-hours-versus-6-hours-a-halachic-analysis.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Waiting 5 and 1/2 Hours Versus 6 Hours – a Halachic Analysis</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Rav Chisda said: One who eats meat may not eat cheese, [one who eats]\n  cheese, may eat meat… </p>\n  \n  <p>Mar Ukvah said: Regarding this, I am like\n  vinegar, the son of wine. My father, if he would consume meat today,\n  would wait until tomorrow to eat cheese. I, however, will not consume\n  them during the same meal, but at another meal I will eat cheese.”</p>\n  \n  <p>The Rif writes that by virtue of the fact that Mar Ukvah referred to\n  himself as “vinegar the son of wine” – no authority permits a waiting\n  period of less than six – from the morning meal to the evening meal.\n  The Baalei HaTosfos disagree and understand the notion of another meal\n  to refer even to a case where a second meal was started right away.\n  [This is also the position of the Mordechai, the HaGaos Ashri, the\n  Hagaos Maimonius and the Raavya.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hoffman then analyzes the meaning of this. It would appear that the Baalei Tosfos would say that the wait of six hours is definitely a minhag, since the Ashkenazic community took on the longer wait. The fact that the Dutch and German communities wait different amounts, seems to imply that the interval of \"next meal\" was established by community minhag.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is not to suggest that other customs are, heaven forbid,\n  incorrect. Customs among observant Jews range the gamut from one hour\n  (Dutch Jews) to three hours (German and British Jews) to five hours to\n  five and half hours. But a number of questions do arise: What should\n  these students who wait six hours be doing? Should the students undo\n  their family tradition and adopt that of their Yeshiva? Also from\n  where did the customs of 6 hours and 5 and ½ arise?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Hoffman discusses the difference between 5.5 (miktzah kekulo) and 6 hours which again seems to imply that the gezeirah of waiting until the \"next meal\" as a set interval appears to be a community minhag as far as what that interval might be. Note that he specifically does this because a problem has arisen in some yeshivos which use the 5.5 hour minhag while the family minhag of many students is to wait the full six hours. </p>\n\n<p>This means that Rabbi Hoffman regards the specific time used for the gezeira of a set interval as a minhag. Thus, מנהג אבותינו תורה היא would be the reason for the psak that he cites.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Poskim replied that, notwithstanding all of the combined factors\n  above to be lenient, it was indeed a problem and that these students\n  should not be forced by the Yeshivos to negate their own family\n  practices. This was the ruling of a number of American Poskim as well\n  as Rav Vosner zt”l in Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Chof-K points out <a href=\"https://www.kof-k.org/articles/040108090401W-2%20Waiting%20Six%20Hours%20Between%20Meat%20and%20Dairy.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Waiting Six Hours between Meat and Dairy</a> that this is a gzeirah miderabbonon (Shulchan Aruch 89:1)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The chachumim made  a gezeira that  even  if  the  meat  and  milk \n  are  not  cooked  together,  you  may  not  eat  milk  after eating\n  any type of meat or chicken before waiting six hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I believe it's that they are equal, and it's only in Seif 2 and 3 that better/worse wine is discussed.</p>\n\n<p>This is משמע from the משנה ברורה</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>משנה ברורה סימן קע\"ה סק\"ג</strong>: ...דאם יש להם מן הראשון והביאו השני כדי שיטעמו יין אחר משונה מן הראשון, מברכין עליו הטוב והמטיב, אבל אם אין להם כלל מראשון, אם כן לא מחמת שינוי הביאו</p>\n  \n  <p>If they have from the first one and they bring you the second one in order for you to taste a different wine than the first, then you make the blessing of HaTov VeHaMeitiv. However, if they don't have any more of the first, then they're not bringing it to make a  change of wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The law applies when you don't have both wines on the table, otherwise it's not called a שינוי. What is the law if one of the wines isn't on the table, but you have in mind to bring it later? It is in this case that there is a machlokes if it's considered on the table or not, and the <strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> says ספק ברכות להקל.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas <strong>Seif 3</strong> is discussing two wines, one is good and one is bad (relatively). Due to one being better than the other, the halacha is dictating precedence to the good one. What if you don't know which one is better? This is where the <strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong> advises to remove one from the table.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>משנה ברורה סימן קע\"ה סקי\"ד</strong>: ואם מסופק לו איזהו טוב ואיזהו רע</p>\n  \n  <p>If you aren't sure which one is good and which one is bad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It would seem that the machlokes between the <strong>Levush</strong> and <strong>Lechem Chamudos</strong> doesn't apply when one is for sure better than the other, although I'm not sure why.</p>\n\n\n",

He was asked to stay a few minutes as within 5 minutes, 2 more people would certainly come and there would be a minyan. The person was impatient and said that if they began later, he would miss his train to work, so he left. As a result, when the 2 people came, there were only 9 people in total, and this ruined things for the others that were already there. (An elderly person who got up early to say Kaddish was livid, as it was a huge effort for him to come to shul, and he did so specifically to say Kaddish.)</p>\n\n<p>My question - halachically, is someone allowed to leave forming the minyan because he must get to work, and by doing so, cause others not to have a minyan at all?</p>\n\n<p>In your answer, you may address not only the issue of forming miyan / <em>tefillah betzibbur</em> but, if relevant, the inconvenience caused to others (e.g. the elderly person as well as others who were there on time / early) to form the minyan. (E.g. perhaps a problem of harming someone's feelings; causing \"loss\" - that elderly person might have gone to another shul that had a minyan so that he could say Kaddish.) If it matters, I should mention that the person who left was a \"regular\" minyan attender, i.e., those that came on time expected him to appear and stay for the minyan.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There's a famous story of the Chazon Ish (will edit in the source), where he had nine men and the zman for Davening was about to end. A tenth man came by and said that he'd join the Minyan, but it would mean being late to work. The Chazon Ish told him to go to work, because you can't Daven on stolen time. There was no Minyan.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, in the case you discussed, if the man showed up late for work, he would have been stealing his employer's money, and thus would have been doing an Aveira. You can't ask someone to do an Aveira so that someone else can do a Mitzvah. </p>\n\n<p>I hope that answers the question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20022&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bnei Bonim 2:4</a> says that he left after Chazoras Hashatz since he had to get his children off to school. He says the Tzibur is at fault as they started 30 minutes late. </p>\n\n<p>It seems to me there is an issue of leaving - when there is exactly 10 already - and that breaks the Minyan - and even then for a serious loss it would be permitted. Leaving prior to ten people being there may get someone upset, but is Halachically sound.</p>\n\n\n",

In our above example of 10^(-6), that would be 6*137=822 ben gilo's. </p>\n\n<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> In Vayikra Rabbah (34:1), as the Matnos Kehunah understands it, R' Huna's talmidim originally understood this to mean sixty people should go around curing everybody. R' Huna replied that they remove one-sixtieth of the <em>original</em> if they love the sick person like themselves, but they will remove one-sixtieth of what <em>remains</em> otherwise. According to Maharzu, they remove one-sixtieth of what remains only if they love the person like themselves and they merely provide emotional support but don't remove any of the sickness otherwise. This version makes no mention of a Ben Gilo. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If Hashem is All-Powerful, why can't he take on a physical form?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Hashem can do whatever He feels like doing. Nothing gets in his way. </p>\n\n<p>This has led to the various questions on here regarding the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16307/how-does-judaism-deal-with-god-and-paradoxes\">omnipotence paradox</a> - can Hashem put Himself in a situation in which He's unable to do something (i.e. create a rock He can't lift, create a prison He can't escape, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27126/can-god-destroy-himself\">destroy Himself</a>, etc.)?</p>\n\n<p>There are essentially two lines of thought, it seems, to answer these questions, as described in the above links: either Hashem cannot violate logic or is above it. </p>\n\n<p>Where is this all leading? <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9187/can-g-d-ever-take-on-a-physical-form\">This discussion</a>. The one in which everyone vehemently replied no to the question of \"Can G-d ever take on a physical form.\" Sure, the question was based on a faulty interpretation of certain pesukim, but it's a valid question, nonetheless. And the answer is that He cannot take on a physical form. </p>\n\n<p>Why? Didn't we just get through saying He can do whatever He wants? As @DoubleAA pointed out, it wouldn't necessarily be a problem according to those who say He can't override logic, but the question still stands for everyone else. Before you say that it's just that He chooses not to, that discussion makes clear it's not that He <em>won't</em> but that He <em>can't</em>. Why not?</p>\n\n<p>(Yes, I'm aware that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70853/do-the-rishonim-that-hold-g-d-can-have-physical-form-e-g-rav-moshe-taku-etc\">there are those who hold He can become physical</a>; I'm asking specifically based on the opinions cited in the above discussion.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is important to recognize that logic doesn't dictate Gd's behavior/actions, in fact nothing dictates Gd's behavior/actions let alone a paradox.  </p>\n\n<p>Secondly, any paradox that we do encounter is by nature only a logical paradox and not a description of reality.  Ex:  zeno's paradox.  In theory you can easily override the paradox by changing the rules of \"man-made logical\" or try to find a solution without changing the \"rules\" of logic.  This is done many times in science for ex: newtonian physics >> einstein physics >> quantum mechanics, etc...</p>\n\n<p>However, even without changing any rules, to follow aristotelian logic or any likes thereof, there is an important rule that precedes it that is commonly ignored.  By definition each proposition can be answered with either true or false.  If it isn't then it is not a proposition and therefore an inductive/reductive conclusion doesn't exist.</p>\n\n<p>Proposition #1: HSM is all powerful >> True\nProposition #2: Why can't he take on physical form >> This is not a proposition\nConclusion:  None</p>\n\n<p>You can say the following:</p>\n\n<p>Proposition #1: HSM is all powerful >> True\nProposition #2: HSm is not physical >> True\nConclusion:  To be All powerful you need to be not physical</p>\n\n<p>In fact what is the definition of All Powerful as it relates to HSM, is it simply can do anything HSM wants? This sounds more like a rebellious teenager.  Where do we find this in the 13 principles?  </p>\n\n<p>This is the stretch of what logic can give an answer to, outside of that you are just speculating conclusions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Well according to Kabbalah essentially Hashem can do anything and that means everything. But hashem himself writes in Torah \"I do not change\". According to Rambam and others no, Hashem can't but that is not a deficiency, see Rav Saadya Gaon on this. But according to Arizal we don't know anything about essence of Hashem, the Gra even writes it's forbidden to think about Essence because that's like saying God forbid that there is something besides. See Rav Eliyashiv, Sefer Leshem on Eitz Chaim on this topic. The question comes down to are you speaking according to Kabbalah that Hashem has created logic and he has no connection to it. Or like Rambam and Rav Saadya Gaon that yes there is logic somehow. The Marahal agrees with Arizal and argues strong against Rambam in his introduction to his Sefer Gevurot Ari.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Sadyaa Gaon can be found in chapter 2 of his Emunot Vedayot.the Arizal that I mentioned is clear from all his seforim and including all seforim written on the Arizal Eitz Chaim.the Leshem I mentioned is in the volume called chelek habirurim the first few pages. This question has been asked forever and it really comes down to a disagreement with philosophy and Kabbalah. I will say though that some kabbalists do agree to Rambam.. But after the Arizal introduced his way 99 pct of Kabbalists agree with him. Meaning that essence of Hashem has no thought no idea zero, like I said the Maharal argues very strongly on the way of Rambam etc.. In his intro to Gevurot Hashem. It comes down to the fact we believe in what Torah and prophets have told us period!  Hatzlacha biezrat hashem!</p>\n\n\n",

Historically this was the common source (initially coming from candle production, and then from soap production), but as bio-diesel and other processes that involve vegetable oil have increased, it is of lesser importance as a source.</p>\n\n<p>Kosher Glycerin is generally derived from vegetable oil instead. It can also be chemically synthesized from petroleum.</p>\n\n<p>According to a glycerin product manager in Cargill quoted <a href=\"http://www.vrg.org/blog/2012/09/24/glycerol-and-mono-and-diglyceride-updates-mostly-vegetable-derived/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> in 2012, 30% of Glycerin in the United States comes from non-Kosher animal sources, and 70% from vegetable based sources. That wouldn't address any equipment sharing concerns. (Synthetic glycerin from petroleum is not generally used in food).</p>\n\n<p>The process from animal fat is <a href=\"http://www.wikihow.com/Make-Glycerin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a straight forward</a> hydrolysis (separating chemical bonds with water), which requires lye (which can be gotten by boiling ash from hard wood) and salt.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Finstein writes (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=917&st=&pgnum=103&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Y.D. 1:62</a> - the subject is the Kashrus of blended whiskies) with regards to Glycerin that it has no taste and is added to whisky for non-taste reasons (to make it smoother to swallow).</p>\n\n<p>The website kashrut.org puts a big emphasis on Rav Moshe in arguing to allow Glycerin (I don't know if this is the only teshuva where Rav Moshe discusses it).</p>\n\n<p>However, both assertions of fact made in that Teshuva are incorrect. Glycerin has a sweet taste and is used to enhance the natural Glycerin that is a byproduct of production as it naturally occurs during firmentation. Yes, it makes it smoother to swallow - in part because it removes bitterness, being a sweetening agent. (You can see <a href=\"http://www.aciscience.org/docs/uses_of_glycerine.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> about its natural presence in fermentation (and a mention of its sweetness) and find <a href=\"http://www.feastie.com/recipes-ingredients/vegetable-glycerin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">many recipes</a> online which use Glycerin as a sweetener. It is also <a href=\"http://slimdoggy.com/dog-food-ingredients-a-to-z-glycerin/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">used in dog food</a>, sometimes as a sweetener).</p>\n\n<p>(On the subject of the Teshuva, the Glycerin still may not pose a Kashrus problem for blended whisky, but just not for the reasons stated, rather because <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/1139/kashrus-in-high-spirits/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">they don't add it</a> by government law, or if they do it is in very small amounts.

I can find no explanation in Rashi. What is the difference between those words?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>לא תתאוה</strong> refers simply to having a desire. </p>\n\n<p><strong>לא תחמד</strong> refers to not only desiring someone's stuff but acting on that desire to actually get it.</p>\n\n<p>If one takes it from him forcefully, he's violated the third aveirah of <strong>לא תגזול</strong>. </p>\n\n<p>And if he's not careful and lets his desire for the property get away from him, he might c\"v end up violating <strong>לא תרצח</strong> as well.  </p>\n\n<p>Thus says the Shulchan Aruch (CM 360:12). He, in turn, got it from the Rambam (Hilchos Gezeilah 1:12). This is how the Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 416) interprets the difference as well. </p>\n\n<p>It's noteworthy that Rashi (Devarim 5:18) holds that there is absolutely no difference between לא תתאוה and לא תחמד, with a prooftext from Onklos in Parshas Bereishis. I'm not sure why he doesn't agree with the Poskim, who seem to have the Gemara on their side (BM 6a, which talks about the issur of לא תחמד, doesn't mention לא תתאוה even once).</p>\n\n<p>@DanF pointed out that the two terms seem to be used differently in different contexts. Specifically the following pesukim:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לא <strong>תחמד</strong> בית רעך לא <strong>תחמד</strong> אשת רעך ועבדו ואמתו ושורו וחמרו וכל אשר לרעך - שמות כ:יד</p>\n  \n  <p>לא <strong>תחמד</strong> אשת רעך ולא <strong>תתאוה</strong> בית רעך שדהו ועבדו ואמתו שורו וחמרו וכל אשר לרעך  - דברים ה:יח</p>\n  \n  <p>פסילי אלהיהם תשרפון באש <strong>לא תחמד</strong> כסף וזהב עליהם ולקחת לך פן תוקש בו כי תועבת ה׳ אלקיך הוא - דברים ז:כה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see that לא תתאוה is used in respect to immovable property, slaves, and animals, while לא תחמד is more broadly applied to not only immovable and movable property, but also one's wife. Why?</p>\n\n<p>Also notice the third aveirah in this triplet: לא תגזל. Ignoring the instances in which it refers to kidnaping, the word is always used in respect to movable property:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כי <strong>יגנב</strong> איש שור או שה וטבחו או מכרו וגו׳ - שמות כא:לז</p>\n  \n  <p>ואם <strong>גנב יגנב</strong> מעמו ישלם לבעליו -שמות כב:יא</p>\n  \n  <p>נפש כי תחטא ומעלה מעל בה׳ וכחש בעמיתו בפקדון או בתשומת יד או <strong>בגזל</strong> או עשק את עמיתו. או מצא אבדה וכחש בה וגו׳ והיה כי יחטא ואשם <strong>והשיב את הגזלה אשר גזל</strong> וגו׳ - ויקרא ה:יח-כד</p>\n  \n  <p>לא תעשק את רעך <strong>ולא תגזל</strong> לא תלין פעלת שכיר אתך עד בקר - ויקרא יט:יג</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I'm assuming that לא תתאוה isn't used in respect to one's wife because that's already covered under לא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם אשר אתם זנים אחריהם. Getting that out of the way, notice that stealing is always used in respect to movable property while לא תתאוה and לא תחמד are both used in respect to immovable property as well. This is because it's impossible to steal land (Sukkah 31a).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are at least two opinions that differentiate halachically between the two terms:</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in M.T. (Gzeilah 1:9-10) and Shulchan Aruch (C.M. 359) hold that לא תתאוה refers to plotting to acquire the coveted item, while לא תחמד refers to actually pressuring the owner into giving it to him.</p>\n\n<p>The Sefer Hachinuch (417) (and perhaps the Rambam in Sefer Hamitzvos L.S. 266) hold that לא תתאוה refers even to mere desire.</p>\n\n<p>It is important to note that (in light of the above ruling of the Shulchan Aruch), contrary to popular belief, <strong>it is not forbidden to feel envious</strong> of someone else's possessions, as long as you don't begin to think about how you can get them from him.</p>\n\n\n",

The two holes are for the Talith Katan only to avoid conceited behaviour. Because the holes in Talit Katan are generally not apparent (Magen Avraham in name of the Bach).</p>\n\n<p>This Minhag was strongly observed in Poland (Mishna Berura).

He does not mention the Baal Haitur, and indeed, this minhag is a derivation from the minhag to make one hole, not from the minhag to make two holes. It is surprising because one can argue that this not regular no for the one hole followers and not for the two holes followers. The text of the Siddur is very short and I don't understand the reasoning. Perhaps, he think that there is no psul do make several holes. we can understand this from the words of Beth Yossef, who mention people who are stringent to make two holes, despite that he criticize them. </p>\n\n<p><em>The second hole is out of the regular area to make a hole following Gemara reported by Itur.  So,  I am not sure that he is counted.  From the words of the Siddur I understand that all 4 threads are in the first hole.  The longer thread only is inserted in the second hole which is \"not regular\"  for a practical reason only,  not linked to the rules concerning holes. This is very congruent with the Mishna Berura who said that the two holes minhag is Polish.  Chabad are not polish but Litvish and follow the Litvish minhag to make one hole only.</em> </p>\n\n<p>Note that he says this for both Tzitzit Katan and Gadol.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><code>I believe Chabad puts seven through one hole and the shamash through the second, but there holes and customs are different.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>--> Yes two differences</strong>, they make this also for Talith Gadol, and the Chabbad Minhag is not derived from the Baal Haitur, which is not mentioned at all in the SA Harav, and the purpose of the second hole is only a technical pattent to ensure tzitzit han off the side.</p>\n\n\n",

According to the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.33a.18-19?\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 33a</a>), a mezuzah that is hung like a bolt is pasul (improper). In other words, the mezuzah should <em>not</em> be hung like a bolt.</p>\n\n<p>There is then, as you mention, a disagreement between Rashi and Rabeinu Tam about what a bolt looks like. Rashi says that a bolt is horizontal and the mezuzah should be vertical. Rabeinu Tam says the reverse is true - a bolt is vertical and the mezuzah should be horizontal.</p>\n\n<p>Medieval Ashkenazi codifiers like the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur,_Yoreh_Deah.289\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.289.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rema</a> tried to satisfy both opinions by requiring a mezuzah be affixed in a way that is neither vertical nor horizontal, so that it would not be like a bolt according to either position. Since the disagreement boils down to which position to avoid, Ashkenazim err on the side of avoiding both. Because the disagreement was on what to avoid, by taking a middle position these Ashkenazi poskim are trying to be 100% correct according to both positions, rather than a 50/50 proposition. </p>\n\n<p>It is worth noting is that the Shulchan Aruch rules differently. Yosef Karo takes Rashi's position to the exclusion of Rabeinu Tam's and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Yoreh_De'ah.289.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rules that a mezuzah should be vertical</a>.

He first discusses a fast that occurred on Friday and whether one must fast to the end even though it is already Shabbos. He discusses this in terms of Asarah B'Teves and private fasts as those are the only ones that can occur under our fixed calendar.</p>\n\n<p>He then discusses the gemaras about someone deliberately fasting for part of a day. It appears from the citations that I marked in bold text, that many poskim seem to say that a partial fast is not valid. Note especially the quote</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Shulhan Arukh OH 562:1 affirms that a partial day fast is\n  not ritually/liturgically meaningful.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, Based on the <em>Terumat Hadeshen</em> and the <em>Rama</em>, he comes to the conclusion</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>The partial day fast has enough integrity to be referred to as ביום צום\n  תעניתנו.  This practice is affirmed by Magen Avraham, Mishnah Berurah\n  and many other later authorities.</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As always one must <strong>CYLOR</strong> for a specific psak in particular cases.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Indeed, we have a few examples of fasts that were truncated earlier in\n  the day.  Mishnah Ta'anit 2:6 speaks about the behavior of the priests\n  on duty in the Temple when fasts were being declared for lack of rain.\n  We are told that during the initial two sets of three fasts, at least\n  some of the priests on duty only fasted a partial day.  Tosefta\n  Ta'anit 3:6 features R. Elazar bR. Tzadok reporting that his family\n  was descended from those who performed an important Temple service on\n  the 10th of Av, making this a joyous day for them.  When 9 Av fell on\n  Shabbat, such that the fast was pushed to Sunday, his family would\n  only fast a partial day.  These both seem to be cases of fasts that\n  were begun in the morning (or the night before) and then ended early\n  midway through the day.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmudim then take up an even more\n  targeted category of תענית שעות-a fast that only lasts a set number of\n  hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here is the summary of what he found regarding private fasts that are supposed to </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On Bavli Ta'anit 12a, Shmuel makes a general point about the need for\n  any optional fast to be explicitly accepted at Minhah the day prior. \n  It is not clear if he believes this to apply to a תענית שעות as well.</p>\n  \n  <p>On Bavli Ta'anit 12a, R. Hisda says that any fast that does not run\n  through the end of the day (sunset) is not a valid fast.  <strong>The Talmud\n  then cites the cases of the priests and R. Elazar bR. Tzadok's family;\n  in both cases, people did end their fast before the end of the day. \n  The Talmud deflects these practices as being devoid of the status of a\n  real fast; essentially, these people electively decided to adopt an\n  ascetic practice, but it has no liturgical/ritual meaning to it.</strong>  The\n  Talmud also cites a version of the tradition about R. Yohanan in the\n  Yerushalmi, where he commits to a fast until he arrives home from the\n  Patriarch's house, which he was visiting or was summoned to.  That\n  case is dismissed as R. Yohanan making that public pronouncement so he\n  could extricate himself from the Patriarch's presence.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Finally, there is a statement by R. Hisda that appears in two different\n  versions and is read differently by different commentators.  Rambam\n  understands his ruling to invalidate a fast that is ended early\n  (before the end of the day), but consistent with beginning a fast\n  midway through the day (like R. Yonah's practice in the Yerushalmi). \n  <strong>In other words, a private fast must always end at sunset/nightfall,\n  but it can begin whenever one wants, as long as it is planned out that\n  way in advance.</strong>  This reads R. Hisda's two statements as making the\n  same legal point, in different words and in different textual\n  contexts.  <strong>Rashi and Ra'avad read R. Hisda as forbidding beginning a\n  fast late, just as his prior statement forbade ending it early.  In\n  other words, for Rashi and Ra'avad, the collective effect of R. Hisda\n  is to eliminate the ritual/liturgical possibility of a half-day fast.</strong> \n  The only meaning of תענית שעות is that a person who fasted an entire\n  day but only did so with intention starting part way through can get\n  credit for a full-day of fasting and have it be ritually/liturgically\n  meaningful.  **Both Rambam and Ra'avad follow the Bavli's seeming\n  conclusion that ending a fast early does not have ritual/liturgical\n  meaning.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Shulhan Arukh OH 562:1 affirms that a partial day fast is\n  not ritually/liturgically meaningful.**  </p>\n  \n  <p>Terumat Hadeshen #157,\n  however, reports that the practice in his community is for grooms to\n  fast a partial day when a wedding is held on Friday afternoon, and\n  argues that this practice is consistent with the permission for תענית\n  שעות, without fully making his case.  Rema settles on a kind of\n  compromise position: 1) A part-day fast by a community cannot trigger\n  changes in communal liturgy, such as the added berakhah in the public\n  Amidah.  2) One may commit to fasting part of the day and add Aneinu\n  into the private Amidah, since this is added into שמע קולנו, the\n  blessing that is a fitting receptacle for all private requests. <strong>The\n  partial day fast has enough integrity to be referred to as ביום צום\n  תעניתנו.  This practice is affirmed by Magen Avraham, Mishnah Berurah\n  and many other later authorities.</strong> </p>\n  \n  <p>In sum, one taking on an optional\n  fast day (which includes the case of one who chooses to fast on public\n  fast days that s/he believes are optional today), can choose to fast\n  until Minhah, insert Aneinu into Minhah and then break the fast.  But\n  no changes should be made to the public Amidah in Minhah in that\n  situation, even if the entire community is fasting a partial day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Note that Taanis 12 says about a <a href=\"http://www.dafdigest.org/Taanis/Taanis%20012.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">ta'anis because of a dream</a> that one fasts the day after the dream even though it was not originally planned. However, that is a full day fast.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תענית יב”</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Fasting for a bad dream</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>רבה בר מחסטא אמר רב חמא בר גוריא אמר רב יפה תענית  ואמרלחלו כא\n  לנעורת ואמר רב חסדא ובו ביו וא”ר יוס ואפילו בשבת</p>\n  \n  <p>And Rabbah bar Mechasya said in the name of R’ Chama bar Gurya who\n  said in the name of Rav a fast is helpful [to nullify the harmful\n  message]  of  a  dream  as  fire  is  [effective  to  burning]  flax. \n  And  R’ Chisda  said  [that  it  must  be  observed]  that  day  and\n  R’  Yosef  said [that it may be observed] even on Shabbos. </p>\n  \n  <p>The  Tur 1  cites  opinions  who  assert  that  nowadays  people \n  should  not  fast  on  Shabbos  if  they  experience  a  bad dream\n  because  we  no  longer  know  how  to  properly  interpret  dreams to\n  know  whether  the  dream  portends  good  or  bad  things  to come. \n  Rav  Schneur  Zalman  of  Liadi 2,  the  Shulchan  Aruch HaRav, \n  explains  that  this  applies  even  to  those  dreams  that were \n  explained  by  Chazal.  Just  like  medical  treatments  men-tioned by\n  Chazal are no longer practiced, so too their interpretation of dreams\n  is no longer practiced. Therefore, one should not fast on Shabbos\n  since we are uncertain whether the dream is truly bad. Rav Yaakov\n  Chaim Sofer 3, the Kaf HaChaim, cites opinions  who  advise  that \n  rather  than  fasting  on  Shabbos  following  a  bad  dream  one \n  should  refrain  from  talking with  oth-ers  and  recite  the  entire\n  book  of  Tehillim.  On  Sunday  if  they wish to fast they may fast\n  and the appropriate tzedakah should be given at that time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ba'al HaTanya writes in Igeret HaTeshuvah chapter 3 concerning breaking up personal fasts into half days. He cites the Yerushalmi that fasting until chatzot is still considered a fast. This can be found in Nedarim 8:1, Gemara beginning with \"Rabbi Acha\" and it continues with a few examples of rabbis taking on partial fasts.</p>\n\n\n",

Here's what I have:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>We know that cutting nails is traditionally a mandatory part of <em>chafifah</em> (pre-<em>mikvah</em> preparation). See Shulchan Aruch 198:19 and Rama there.</p></li>\n<li><p>We know the entire chafifah is done on the day of the <em>tevilah</em> (ideally, with special rules for <em>Shabbos</em> and <em>Yom Tov</em>).

In contrast, regarding <em>Shabbos</em> the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> does discuss what should be done before or after <em>Shabbos</em> (YD 199:4-7) (or <em>Yom Tov</em>). One should therefore conclude that no such restrictions apply.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Here's another argument one can make:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Even of those who do not wash during the Nine Days, some permit cutting nails, and some prohibit it.

    "content": "# Bracha Shehechiyanu on a diamond ring?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was always under the impression that a Kallah that receives a diamond ring  makes the Bracha Shehechiyanu on it. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14678&st=&pgnum=149\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igros Moshe, Evan HaEzer 4:84</a> seems to say that the Kallah should make the Bracha \"Hatov V'Hamaitiv\". I recently came across <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?id=12847\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article from Rabbi Kaganoff</a> where he quotes Halichos Shlomo that a Kallah should not recite Shehechiyanu on gifts presented for the engagement or wedding plans. Since this Sefer is not available online I was wondering what the reasons are not to recite the Bracha?</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Above, I quoted the shaylah asked by a kallah: Do I recite\n  shehechiyanu when my choson gives me the engagement ring and when my\n  future mother-in-law presents me with my candlesticks?</p>\n  \n  <p>I mentioned above that some have the custom that one does not recite\n  shehechiyanu on new items other than clothes. Although most poskim\n  disagree with this conclusion, others cite other reasons why one\n  should not recite shehechiyanu on gifts presented as part of the\n  engagements and wedding plans (see Halichos Shelomoh 23:15). Since the\n  matter is disputed, whether a kallah should recite shehechiyanu on her\n  diamond ring or her candlesticks is something that she should ask her\n  Rav.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The suggestion given (footnote 70 there) is דהוי כחוב בין המחותנים that it's like an obligation between the parents. In other words, the bride and groom aren't receiving these gifts as \"gifts\" but as payments due to them as part of the (implicit) wedding agreement that the parents are bound to. (He doesn't find this argument fully convincing, but mentions it.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kiddush - סברי מרנן ורבנן ורבותי\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have noticed various customs surrounding the words before Hagefen for all kiddushim. My sefard siddur says  סברי מרנן ורבנן ורבותי but I have also seen סברי מרנן and many other variants across other sefard/ashkenaz/chabad siddurim. Does anyone have an idea on where the different customs came from and which variant is preferred. Also the translation of מרנן in several siddurim is Gentelman but i have also seen a translation of רבותי as Gentelman or men so why the double up?</p>\n\n<p>Also on a similar note my father in law says סברי מרנן before Hamotzi, which I have not heard before. He's unsure where he picked it up.  </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source of saying this סברי formula is the שבלי הלקט in סימן קמ, quoted in בית יוסף אורח חיים קסז ד''ה כתוב. His original formulation is 'סברו מורי'. He explains that when one person wanted to be מוציא others in the ברכה of wine in the middle of the סעודה, he had to get the other people's attention first so they could swallow what they were eating and prepare to listen to the ברכה. \nThis same idea is found in many places such as תוספות ברכות מג עמוד א ד''ה הואיל, מרדכי ברכות רמז קמה and הגהות מימוניות ברכות ז,ט or ז,י in the Frankel edition, all of which have the גירסא of סברי מורי.</p>\n\n<p>The interesting thing that the שבלי הלקט does is to expand it to קידוש. There is no problem of people having full mouths as you start קידוש (or there shouldn't be) so we could technically say ברשות. The reason we would want to say ברשות is to warn them to pay attention to the ברכה and ask permission to say it on their behalf. However, he says that we avoid differentiating between different ברכות on wine and thus always say סברי. He also says that for bread, we say ברשות and not סברי, contrary to your father in law. My father also says סברי for bread but I think it is a mistaken מנהג, due to thinking that both ברכות with which we begin the שבת meal are the same.</p>\n\n<p>It so happens that when this is quoted by רמ''א in אורח חיים קעד,ח, he says that we say סברי רבותי. </p>\n\n<p>The phrase 'סברי מרנן' is actually in a מדרש תנחומא 's description of how a decision of בית דין is made to kill someone (found in the beginning of פרשת פקודי). It is quoted in the context of ברכות by דעת זקנים ויקרא י,ט as well as טור אורח חיים סימן קעד in the name of his father, רא''ש.</p>\n\n<p>I haven't managed to find the full סברי מרנן ורבנן ורבותי but it is a reasonable assumption to make that people felt they shouldn't just include the Rabbis and other important members of the congregation in with the 'rif-raf' so gave a special term for them all.</p>\n\n<p>The sum total of the discussion is whatever words you use, the intention is to make sure people are paying attention to the ברכה said. How you refer to those people is probably not the end of the world and there seem to be a few different customs in early sources.</p>\n\n\n",

If my memory serves me, this doesn't happen in the first four books of the Torah.\nThe גמרא in פסחים נ עמוד א explicitly says that the four letter name is pronounced with א, ד.\nWhy not just use אלקים explicitly in these places?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are cases in the navi where the four letter name follows the aleph dalid name.

Thus, we cannot write a different word in its place. All the kri ksiv follows the mesorah. Thus, the way it is written is what the navi specified to be written, while the kri follows the mesorah as to how the navi wanted it spoken.</p>\n\n<p>The reason would be so that the first word of the two word phrase is not repeated, but shows that it is a different word.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Isaac Levy, the grandson of Rav Hirsch, who translated the Hirsch Chumash, translated the Haftarot commentary of R' Mendel (הר׳ רבי מנחם ב\"ר שַמשון) Hirsch (Die Haftarot, übersetzt und erläutert, 1896 (2. Auflage 1913)), into English. He added the Haftarot as a final volume to his Hirsch Chumash. He translated the two word phrase in Yeshaya 50 as </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My Lord, \"the G0d Who Revealeth His Love in administering judgment\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus the specific meaning cannot just explicitly use other than the four letter word for Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>Thanks to @NoachMiFrankfurt for the <a href=\"https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendel_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">update</a></p>\n\n\n",

My question is, does the fixed calendar slightly drift from the astronomical lunar month or is the average length of a fixed Hebrew-calendar month exactly the same as the average length of an astronomical lunar month? Assuming there is some amount of drift, how much is there?</p>\n\n<p>From my amateur perspective, it seems that if there is a lunar drift, it is much smaller than the solar drift as <em>Rosh Hodesh</em> continues to correspond with the new moon and if there was a significant lunar drift, the new month would begin to occur farther away from the new moon. I understand that the <em>molad</em> often does not fall exactly on the day before <em>Rosh Hodesh</em>, but I don't have much in-depth knowledge of how the <em>molad</em> works and how it relates to <em>Rosh Hodesh</em>.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_calendar#Synodic_month_.E2.80.93_the_molad_interval\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This [the molad] value is as close to the correct value of 29.530589 days as it is possible for a value to come that is rounded off to whole parts (1/18 minute). The discrepancy makes the molad interval about 0.6 seconds too long. Put another way, if the molad is taken as the time of mean conjunction at some reference meridian, then this reference meridian is drifting slowly eastward. If this drift of the reference meridian is traced back to the mid-4th century, the traditional date of the introduction of the fixed calendar, then it is found to correspond to a longitude midway between the Nile and the end of the Euphrates. The modern molad moments match the mean solar times of the lunar conjunction moments near the meridian of Kandahar, Afghanistan, more than 30° east of Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the discrepancy between the molad interval and the mean synodic month is accumulating at an accelerating rate, since the mean synodic month is progressively shortening due to gravitational tidal effects.

Even when halakhic decisors such as Maran Qaro make such statements, it is not for the intended purpose as being a binding halakha. You see this very clearly if you just read a few sentences before your quote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Orach Chayim 8:2 -\"The manner to wrap oneself goes according to the\n  way people wrap themselves in clothing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>These are suggestions, not halachically binding. You find other codifications making similar mentions or suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>Such as Nehar Misrayim, written in the 1900s on the laws of Egyptian Jewry. i actually have pictures to verify this was how it was done. So you have instances of an entire community, post Shulchan Arukh, not following what was written. Why? Probably because they already had a custom and did not feel the need to follow a new suggestion.</p>\n\n<p>Nehar Misrayim Halachoth Sithsith 4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ד) במצרים רובא דרובא דהמוני עם משלשלין כל הארבעה ציציות לצד פניהם\n  והטלית מקופל על צוארם וראוי להודיעם שלפחות בשערת העטיפה. יברך ויתעטף\n  בו ראשו ורובו ויעמוד כן כדי הילוך ארבע אמות ואח״כ ישלשלנו על כתפו.</p>\n  \n  <p>4) In Egypt the most common way is that one drapes all four ṣiṣioth to\n  their front and the tallit is folded on their neck. And it's\n  appropriate to inform them in their time of wrapping. He blesses and\n  wraps his head and most of his body in it and will stand up in the\n  space of four cubits and afterward will drape it over his shoulder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also, before Maran ruled the way he did, there were many other methods brought down for how to wear a tallith.

And it appears to me he means as a pious practice but not the actual law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then shows a bunch of cases in the gemarra to be understood that meikkar hadin there's no chiyuv to judge favorably. Then a few paragraphs later writes</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל זה שכתבנו הוא מצד הדין אבל מצד מדה טובה אפילו הכף חוב הוא הרבה יותר מכף זכות צריך <strong>לדון לכף זכות</strong>, וראיה משבת (קכ''ז ע''ב) בכל המעשיות שהביא שם הגמרא היה הכף חוב הרבה והרבה יותר מהכף זכות ואפילו הכי צריך לדונו לכף זכות כמו שאמר שם העבודה כך היה וכשם וכו.</p>\n  \n  <p>Everything we've written [so far] is regarding the actual law. However, regarding the pious practice, even if the guilty side is much more compelling than the innocent side, you must <strong>judge favourably</strong>. A proof of this is in the Gemarrah in Shabbas with all of the cases the Gemarrah brings there where the guilty side was more compelling than the innocent side and even so one needs to judge favourably as it says over there \"The job was such and just as...\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which is it? Leave as suffik or judge favourably?</p>\n\n\n",

But look how much he's grown!\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Chofetz Chaim (hilchos L.H. klal 9:1) says it's forbidden because it's considered 'avak L.H.'.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From what I recall from Chofetz Chaim (don't have time to look for exact sources now) what is considered L.H.  depends on the listener - if he views the person negatively as a result, it's forbidden. If he views him favorably it's not. So the same words can be L.H. when said to one person, but permitted when said to someone else. Saying that someone has come a long way will be received differently by different people, with some respecting him more as a result and some respecting him less. Since it's not always certain what the listener's internal reaction is going to be, it's probably best to avoid saying something like this. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>According to R. Menahem HaMeiri the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements that have a negative component, but are said for a positive reason (in this case to praise the subject), and not to hurt him, are permissible since by definition they are not <em>l'shon hara</em>. These are his words in is Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of this is also the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to <em>to'elet</em>, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the eminent modern day halakhic authority, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Asher Weiss</a> Shlit\"a writes in Minhat Asher to Leviticus (p. 268) that to'elet renders speech permissible and not l'shon hara, by definition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באיסורי תורה צריך לדון בדיני דחיה האם תועלת זו ראויה לדחות איסור ...אבל בהלכות לשה\"ר לאו מדין דחיה אתינן עלה, אלא יסוד האיסור תלוי במדה רעה וכל שכונתו לטובה...ולא לרעתו אין בזה עבירה כלל, ודו\"ק בכ\"ז כי לענ\"ד ברור הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>With Torah prohibitions one must evaluate with the laws of <em>dehiya</em> [prioritisation], whether this <em>to'elet</em> [purpose] is sufficient to supersede a prohibition. But with the laws of <em>l'shon hara</em>, we are not utilising the law of supercession. Rather, the very definition of the prohibition depends on negative character traits, and anything in which his intent is for good...and not for someone else's harm, has no prohibition whatsoever, and consider all of this, for in my humble opinion, it is clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows that this is the opinion of Rashi (Moed Katan 16a s.v. amar lei la'avuha) and sharply disputes (p. 267) the Hafets Hayyim's attempt at escaping the implication of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בחפץ חיים...כתב...ודבריו קשים לכאו' דמלבד שאין הדברים מתיישבים בלשון רש\"י</p>\n  \n  <p>However in Haffets Hayyim...he wrote...and his words appear difficult, for besides for the fact that his words don't fit with Rashi's wording...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Like R. Elhanan, he connects this to the idea that interpersonal mitsvot in general are by definition only prohibited when they are malicious. (In particular he connects this to the prohibition of overcharging, see p. 267)].</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, he clarifies (p. 267) that there are limits to the limitation of <em>l'shon hara</em> to cases of malicious intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דשאני המספר לשה\"ר דרך קלות ראש דהרי פושע גמור ובזה ודאי עובר בחטא כיון שהדברים מצד עצמם הם לשה\"ר גמור ובדרך שחוק וקלות ראש מנבל הוא את פיו בכה\"ג פושע הוא אף שלא התכוין להרע לחבירו</p>\n  \n  <p>For it is different if a person speaks <em>l'shon hara</em> with frivolity, since the matters are intrinsically <em>l'shon hara</em> and in the context of frivolity and levity, he pollutes his mouth. In such a case, he is a willful sinner even though he didn't intent to harm his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: \"I was just having a good time\", isn't a legitimate excuse to speak disparagingly about someone. However, by all indications, speaking when there is some specific purpose, such as complimenting someone, would be fine.</p>\n\n<p>However, it should be noted that \"You shall love your fellow as yourself\" (Leviticus 19:18) still applies and one should be considerate of another person's sentiments, and not say something about him that he would prefer remains unsaid.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the Torah Address the Issue of Circumcision on the Sabbath?\n\n## Frage\n\n<h1>Question - a Reference Request from Scripture:</h1>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Does the written Torah, (or Scripture), ever address the issue of Circumcision on the Sabbath?</li>\n<li>Does Scripture indicate whether Sabbath Restrictions override the requirement to Circumcise on the 8th day, or if the 8th day requirement overrides the Sabbath Restrictions?</li>\n<li>Consequently, Did the Sadducees or Karaites handle this issue differently from Pharasaic Judaism which relied on Oral Law?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The written Torah does not address the issue of circumcision on the Sabbath. Gen. 17 and Levit. 12:3 merely mention the 8th day requirement as far as the plain text is concerned.</p>\n\n<p>In the Talmud, tractate Shabbos, 131b (at the bottom of the page) and onward, there is an argument about Scripture's indication. Some say that the circumcision overrides the Sabbath because we have an Oral Tradition from Moses at Sinai from G-d Himself that it in fact overrides. Another opinion holds that the word \"and on the 8th day\" has extra emphasis due to the added letters making the phrase \"and on the\". (Levit 12:3). This emphasis hints to us that it must be the 8th, even if it is the Sabbath.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, if a doubt arises as to the baby's true birthday (if the baby was born Friday evening; and we do not know if it was the Sabbath or just before the Sabbath) then the circumcision is postponed to the following Sunday, because a doubtful 8th day does not override a certain Sabbath. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud also learns out that since the verse (Levit 12:2) says that a mother \"conceives and gives birth\" it follows that verse 3 (8th day) only applies to a birth that was delivered through the same canal it was conceived. So, a c-section baby would not have its circumcision override the Sabbath.</p>\n\n<p>Orthodox Jews do not accept the Sadducee or Karaite form of Judaism to have any validity.</p>\n\n<p>The Sadducees are now extinct. They lost their power base when the 2nd Temple was destroyed. If you do find anyone claiming to be a Sadducee, they are either a revivalist or a modern day Karaite at best. Therefore, little is historically known about how they would handle a specific legal question.</p>\n\n<p>Karaites however, do have small and scattered modern day communities with traditions and history dating back, in some cases, for centuries. Rabbi David Nieto authored a book called \"The Rod of Judgment\" (written in the early 1700's in London, England) which describes a work written by a Karaite scholar named Eliyahu ben Moshe. This Karaite scholar sets down a three way argument among Karaites about circumcision on the Sabbath. 1) It absolutely overrides the Sabbath 2) It does not override the Sabbath 3) You should do it on the Sabbath late in the afternoon after twilight because it is still the 8th day, but no longer a time of Sabbath breaking culpability.</p>\n\n<p>In History of the Karaite Jews by William Harris Rule, (London 1870) it is brought down that Karaites agree that a baby should be circumcised on the Sabbath because the Law of Circumcision is mentioned earlier in history (Abraham) than the Law of the Sabbath.</p>\n\n<p>Yefet ben Eli, a Karaite scholar from the mid- tenth century  CE, credits (quotes) Anan ben David (the founder of Karaism) as inventing the answer to the Sabbath - circumcision question by performing it late Saturday afternoon after twilight because that time is still legally the Sabbath (8th day), but without the Sabbath restrictions in force.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Saadiah Gaon (Orthodox) who lived at that time ( about 882CE - 942CE) addresses and rejects that idea.</p>\n\n<p>It is common for different Karaite communities to argue about such situations and respect each others right to argue and interpret. A common phrase used by Karaites is \"...so is the opinion of the majority of (our Karaite) sages...\"</p>\n\n<p>In general, Karaites also view a baby born late in the evening after sunset, to be of doubtful birthdate. They elect to count his birthday as if it were the next morning since that will certainly cause the circumcision to be performed on the 8th - 9th day (and not the 7th - 8th). </p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps you.</p>\n\n\n",

The China v'Chisda on Kesubos (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6884&st=&pgnum=228\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">vol. 1, p. 113b</a>) agrees, though he quotes the <strong>Ritva</strong> as holding that both the bride and groom must be present. He also quotes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/6886\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later, vol. 3</a> p. 272b) from others that even if the groom was not present for some reason, but the meal was still prepared in honor of the couple, some say that Sheva Brachos can be made, and apparently that was the custom in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaloniki\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Salonica</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef in Yabia Omer 6:9:1-2 brings many sources (כדרכו) as to what to do in such a case, and concludes that the Shulchan Aruch appears to hold like the aforementioned Ritva. Therefore, both the bride and groom must at least participate in the meal, and although strictly speaking the bride can be in a different room, it is best for her to be brought in for the brachos (see also Yalkut Yosef Sova Semachos 1, 16:3, 16:8) </p>\n\n<p>Apparently such a case occurred in 19th Century <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikulov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nikolsburg</a>, where the groom left for a business trip into his Sheva Brachos week. This case is discussed in both Teshuvas Mahari Asad (no. 12) and Maharam Shik (no. 90), who both believe that Sheva Brachos should not be made in such a case.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to many contemporary Poskim - Rav Ovadia (Yabia Omer vol. 6 Even HaEzer 9), Rav Mordechai Eliyahu (“Hilchot Shidduchim and Chatunah” by R’ Shmuel Eliyahu), Rav Moshe HaLevi (Birkat Hashem (vol. 4 page 246)), and the Tzitz Eliezer (vol. 13 Siman 99) - if the Chattan and Kallah were both present and ate bread at the beginning of the meal, the guests may recite Sheva Berachot, even if one or the other left in the middle. If, however, one of them was not present at the beginning or didn’t eat, Sheva Berachot may not be recited. See also Shalmei Simcha page 323, 355.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Vozner holds that although it’s ideal for the Kallah to hear the Berachot, if she is not present during the Seudah, Sheva Berachot may still be recited if she feasts with her entourage separately and then comes with them to Birkat HaMazon. It’s questionable if they may do so if she doesn’t enter the room, even if hears the singing from outside. (Shevet HaLevi vol. 8 Siman 281)</p>\n\n\n",

You're praying for your <em>life</em> \"like a slave pleads to his master.\" Would you <em>really</em> be talking to your friend in the middle of an impassioned plea to live another year, when your very life hangs in the balance?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part two:</strong> As for Selichos of fast days: note that, unlike those of Elul, these are said between Shemoneh Esrei and Tachanun. The Gemara (Bava Metzia 59b) records a story that shows the power of not interrupting between these tefillos. In combining that with the pain he felt deep down from being excommunicated by Rabban Gamliel (long story), R' Elazar ultimately ended up killing the Nasi with his tefillos, albeit unintentionally. Recognizing these two powers, R' Elazar's wife (R' Gamliel's sister) kept distracting him between the two tefillos in order to prevent this from happening, but one time she slipped up, and R' Gamliel died as a result. </p>\n\n<p>From here we see the power of not interrupting between Shemoneh Esrei and Tachanun. Selichos are of the same theme as Tachanun and thus aren't really an interruption (similar to saying Kaddish before Shemoneh Esrei of Maariv), but talking during that time certainly would be. </p>\n\n\n",

And this\n  spirit does not rest and quiet until the person repeats more things\n  like this. The person then finds pleasure in doing these things,\n  whether they are good (mitzvas) or evil (sins). And this is what is\n  meant by 'sin brings sin and mitzva brings mitzva (pirkei avos 4:2)'\"\n  And the greater the sin, the greater the spirit, and the greater the\n  lust to do more evil. And likewise for a great mitzva, a spirit from a\n  very holy place comes down and the person lusts immensely for another\n  mitzva. And because of this, he finds enormous pleasure in doing\n  mitzvos. As is known, the greatest of all mitzvos is learning Torah,\n  and the opposite is idle chatter and frivolity (letzanus) which is the\n  opposite of Torah. Therefore, there is greater pleasure in idle\n  chatter and frivolity than in all other sins, even though there is no\n  physical benefit, because the ruach hatuma (evil spirit) is\n  exceedingly great....but really, the pleasure in the holy spirit is\n  greater than the evil spirit (sin) because it is a true pleasure\" -\n  commentary on Mishlei/Proverbs 1:23</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>looking at women <em>in order to derive pleasure</em> is a powerful sin as the talmud teaches (berachot 61a):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\" 'from hand to hand he shall not escape from evil' (Mishlei 11:21),\n  [this teaches] whoever counts out money from his hand to the hand of a\n  woman so as to have an excuse for gazing at her, even if he possesses\n  Torah and good deeds like Moses our teacher, shall not escape the\n  punishment of Gehinom\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

They are not allowed to do <em>melacha</em> on any day (except for acts required for survival), but observe every seventh day from the time they realized they don't know as Shabbat, with the special liturgy.</p>\n\n<p>Now, let's mix these two cases together.</p>\n\n<p>A mohel and his wife are lost in the <s>desert</s> rainforest. He conveniently has all his supplies with him. However, they don't know what day it is. Let's say one day (around noon) (not the day they're observing as Shabbat) his wife gives birth to a baby boy. It's obvious that in this case they should do the <em>mila</em> on the 8th day.</p>\n\n<p>But the birth wasn't at noon. It was in the evening, during <em>bein hashmashot</em>. Now what? We're not sure when the 8th day is, and we're also not sure when Shabbat is. Is <em>safek</em>-8th-day <em>doche safek-Shabbat</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Let's say the above case was on their \"Tuesday\". What if it happened on their \"Friday\", so the baby was born just as their \"Shabbat\" came in?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Every day is Safek Shabbos, making Kiddush on the 7th day has absolutely no repercussions whatsoever whether that day is Shabbos or not, rather the Kiddush is in order not to forget Shabbos as the Mishna Berura states SA OC 344,1 3.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בקידוש והבדלה - דהיינו שעושה קידוש על הפת והיין כדין ותקנו חכמים זה לזכרון שלא תשתכח תורת שבת ממנו </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A safek (doubt) if it's Shabbos for one person stuck in a rain-forest when everyone else knows very well what day it is is not considered a safek. This is clear from Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 261,1 Biur Halacha:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בין השמשות:    ועיין מ\"ב סק\"א ולא הוי ס\"ס דספק חסרון ידיעה אינו נכנס כלל בגדר ספק </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Also this is clear in Shulchan Aruch Yore Dea 98,3 in the Shach:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ספק התלוי בחסרון ידיעה לא מקרי ספק דדעת שוטים הוא זה </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So if the 8th day bein hashmoshos is daytime it might be Shabbos, and if bein hashmoshos is night time it also might be Shabbos so there is no sfek sfeka rather one safek Deoraita which we judge Lechumra i.e don't do Mila. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore one must not do Brit Mila (until they are rescued back to civilization), as every day might be Shabbos and Safek Deoraita Lechumra, so one cannot do Mila* for a baby born in Bein Hashmoshos as stated in the Rambam Hilchot Mila 1,9 quoted by the questioner.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*Note: Even though Mila is also Chayav kareis, this is only if the person goes his whole life withholding doing Mila on purpose. Here he is waiting for an opportunity when he goes out of the forest and knows it is not Shabbos to finally do Mila just like when klal yisroel left the Midbar finally did circumcision in Gilgal see Yehoshua chapter 5.</p>\n\n\n",

This interpretation of the Mishna is congruent to Ramban, but some other Rishonim see the so called taste as a strong enough taste as we will examine further.</p>\n<p>Now I will copy the comment Magen Avraham on <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1034\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 208, sk 15</a> (in way to examine diverse components of the question):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כך כתב הרב דוד אבודרהם בשם תלמידי רבינו יונה. שנינו במסכת חלה ‏(ג,ז)‏ העושה עיסה מן החיטין ומן האורז אם יש בה טעם דגן חייבת מן החלה ואדם יוצא בה ידי חובתו בפסח. וכתב הרב בית יוסף סימן תנ\"ג, כתב <strong>הראב\"ד והרשב\"א</strong> והוא שיש בה כזית בכדי אכילת פרס. <strong>והמגיד משנה והרמב\"ן</strong> סוברים אפילו אין בה כזית בכדי אכילת פרס. לפי שהחיטין גוררין את האורז. ודוקא באורז, אבל לא במינים אחרים, וכן דברי הרמב\"ם והרא\"ש. עד כאן לשונו. וידוע שדין חלה והמוציא שוין בזה לכולי עלמא, עיין סימן קס\"ח סעיף י\"ג דגבי חלה לחם כתיב וגבי מצה מדמה בגמרא להמוציא כדאיתא בברכות דף ל\"ז עמוד ב' וגם הרמב\"ם כתב בהלכות מצה: זה הכלל כל שמברכים עליו ברכת המזון אדם יוצא בו ידי חובתו ועין סוף סימן קפ\"ח ואם כן מוכח דבאורז אף על גב דליכא כזית בכדי אכילת פרס, מברכים המוציא ושלש ברכות לדעת המגיד משנה וסיעתו. ובשאר מינים לא מקרי לחם לענין המוציא והוא הדין לענין ברכת המזון דכתב הרמב\"ם בפרק שלישי דיש אומרים כל שמברכים עליו ברכת המוציא מברכים בסוף ברכת המזון וכל שמברכים עליו בורא מיני מזונות מברך בסוף מעין שלש חוץ מן האורז וכן הוא בירושלמי. ומיהו התם מסיים דקאי אמין שמברכים עליו ואם כן צריך עיון למה כתב כאן בתחילה המוציא ולבסוף על המחיה ולא מצינו כיוצא בזה בכולי תלמודא. וצריך לומר כיון דקיימא לן <strong>בכל איסורין שבתורה שאם אכל מעט ושהה בכדי אכילת פרס אינו חייב, אם כן הוא הדין לענין ברכת המזון</strong> עד שיאכל כזית בלא שהיה בכדי אכילת פרס והכא, כיון שמעורב, כזית יותר בכדי אכילת פרס, על כרחך שוהה ביניהם ולכן אינו מברך ברכת המזון והוא הדין לענין מצה, ועין מה שכתבתי בריש סימן ר\"י. אבל המוציא מברך דעל כל שהוא מברך המוציא, וכן משמע קצת בלבוש. ומכל מקום קשה, כיון דאינו מצרף, אם כן גם על המחיה לא יברך, דעל שאר המינין אינו מברך רק בורא נפשות. ועוד דהא, גבי חלה, אף על פי שיש בקמח של דגן לבד שיעור חלה, אפילו הכי, אם ערבו בקמח אחר פטור מחלה אם אין בו כזית בכדי אכילת פרס, אלמא בטיל לגמרי. ויש לומר דלענין ברכה קיימא לן כל שיש בו מחמשת המינים מברך בורא מיני מזונות, אף על פי שאין בו כזית בכדי אכילת פרס, כמו שכבות בסעיף ב'. אך קשה, למה כתב אם בשלו מברך אחריו בורא נפשות. וצריך עיון. ומיהו <strong>אם לא ערבו עם קמח, רק עם שאר מינים</strong>, מברך בורא מיני מזונות ועל המחיה ואפילו אין בו כזית בכדי אכילת פרס כמו שכתוב בסעיף ב'. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead of translating the text, I will try to show its structure.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Following some Rishonim (Rashba, Raavad), The \"concentration of Wheal in a dough of Orez need to be KAP (concentration-rate) thereby to transform it in a Challa taxable.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Following others (Magid Mishne, Ramban), a simple taste of wheat is sufficient. This is a particularity of Orez which is \"dragged\" by the wheat.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A bread made from <strong>rice and a bit of wheat</strong> needs to bless Hamotsi and Birkat Hamazon according to MM & RaMBaN.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For mixtures of wheat with <strong>non-Orez kitniot</strong>,  All Rishonim agree that the mixture needs a KAP of wheat in way to make a bread requiring Hamotsi and BHM.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>But if the amount of wheat is lower, RMBM seems to decide that the  blessing will be BMMezonot (BMM) and Me'en 3 (Al Hamichia (Ahava, Berachot, 3, 11)).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A difference of Criterion between First Blessing and Last Blessing is understandable. The first is not quantity related and the second is quantity related. So may be that the first is not Concentration Related and the second is Concentration Related because the concentration influences the rate of eating, which is also important as we will learn further. So, something can be Hamotsi and not Birkat Hamazon.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Shulchan Aruch 208, 9 mechadesh: A bread with wheat less than KAP and other Kitniot, need to bless Hamotsi and Al Hamichia.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The discrepancy between the Criterion for Birkat Hamazon and for Al Hamichia is strange:</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Both are quantity-proportion related. And as for prohibited foods quantity of eating is Rated to rate. eating a \"Kezayt quantity\" of Isur in a \"time quantity of Achilat pras\": Quantity--eating Rate related.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>So for BHM and AHM we expect the same criterion of KAP of wheat.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Magen Avraham wrote that a Kazait of weat must be eaten, not only of the mixture, and it must to be eaten in a time called Achilat Pras in way to blessing Hamotsi. For prohibited mixture too a Kazayit of mixture is not sufficient for Shiur Isur, they need to eat a Kazayit of Isur from the mixture (this detail needs a large development, e.g. For the Gra, without a Kezayit of weath, Bore nefashot, even if he eat many Kezeitim of the mixture.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Magen Avraham doesn't Metarets, but he accepted the Psak of Shulchan Aruch for mixture of FLOUR.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Magen Avraham sk 9 reported the doubt about what is Orez and stated it as safek.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>But, even if Rice is not Orez, you need to bless AHM.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>But the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1034\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GRA</a> thinks that there is a printing error in Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Mishna Berura <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=232&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sk 47</a> does has mentioned the Gra and advise a Yere Shamayim to eat such a bread inside a bread meal only, but he added that who want to maka as the SA said is allowed.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>But in your case, Safek Orez, may be that everybody agrees to the SA.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h3>list of abbreviations:</h3>\n<p>AHM: Al Hamichia;</p>\n<p>BHM: Birkat Hamazon;</p>\n<p>BMM: Bore Mine Mezonot;</p>\n<p>KAP: Kezayt bikde Achilat Peras;</p>\n<p>MM: Maggid Mishne;</p>\n<p>OC: Orach Chayim;</p>\n<p>SA: Shulchan Aruch;</p>\n<p>sk: Sayif Katan;</p>\n\n\n",

Everyone takes some of these, but not all. It's all a bit of a mess. Another great question is how do you distinguish between a silent ה and a mappik ה when transliterating into English</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There are no complete standard transliteration schemes, but a few conventions have emerged for specific phonemes.</p>\n<p>For example, many transliterate long vowels with a macron (āēīōū), and transliterate emphatics with a dot underneath (ṭṣ), both taken from standard transliteration schemes for Semitic languages.</p>\n<p>Those of the soft בג״ד כפ״ת that don’t have a conventional single-character transliteration (e.g. “v” for בֿ), are usually transliterated with an “h” after the letter used for the hard version; thus, ג̄ is “gh”. Sometimes, for aesthetics, ד̄ will be transliterated as ḏ rather than “dh”.</p>\n<p>Differentiating כֿ from ח can be done by transliterating כֿ as “kh” and ח as a modified “h”, like ħ, ḥ, or ẖ.</p>\n<p>ק is usually transliterated as q, but can also be transliterated as ḳ.</p>\n<p>ע can be transliterated as a backtick (`), a superscript C (ᶜ), or quite rarely, the official phonetic symbol for the <em>voiced epiglottal fricative</em> (ʕ).</p>\n\n\n",

And as it explains there, even then, when Moshiach knows this about himself, many people in the world will still not know it about him.</p>\n\n<p>According to what is taught by Rabbi Chaim Vital there, Moshiach will become aware that he is Moshiach at the time that he merits to prophecy.

Sinai. The verses are (the full verses are in the margin of the linked Talmud page, mentioned above):</p>\n\n<p>Devarim 9:9 (My loose translation) \"When I arose on the mountain to get the stone tablets of the covenant that G-d made with you.

G-d listened to me this time too and did not want to destroy you.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rav resolves the conflict (one verse says \"standing\" and the other verse says \"sitting\") by stating that when one learnes something new, he should stand. When one reviews what he learns, he should sit.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>My question - Rav's reasoning seems reversed if we understand the events of the two verses cited. In the first verse, where Moses mentions that he sat on the mountain, he was actually learning something new, as this was talking about receiving the first set of tablets. He was learning the laws the first time.</p>\n\n<p>The 2nd verse, Moses was receiving the 2nd set of tablets, so, in a sense, he was reviewing what he already learned. There it says that he was standing.</p>\n\n<p>How do we resolved how Rav learned (and said) his statements when the logic seems reversed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Maharsha points this out.

Microwave ovens </p>\n\n<p>A microwave oven is essentially different than other ovens. Gas and electric ovens produce heat which is transmitted to the food. A microwave oven works in the reverse: the food is heated and in turn heats the area surrounding it. Despite this distinction, a microwave oven shares the problems of other ovens. Foods may come in contact with residue of other foods if the oven surface is not clean. Two foods cooked simultaneously can absorb aroma (reicha) from one another. In addition, the most prevalent issue, a microwave may cause foods to ab- sorb taste through steam zeiah. Foods steam quite quickly in a micro- wave oven (indeed, the moisture in the foods is the first thing to heat) The steam rises and visibly condenses into droplets on the top of the oven. The concern that these droplets will subsequently fall onto the food is genuine. The question of whether a microwave oven effects act- is moot for this purpose. Our concern is with zeiah, regardless of its source. One distinction, however, between a microwave and other ovens is the fact that the wall of the oven generates no heat; rather, all heat is derived from the food itself. Thus, the steam reaching the top of the oven is often no longer hot. Nevertheless, if food is heated for an extended period of time, even the oven top becomes hot from the vapor In many aspects a microwave is worse than other ovens: a) The area is small and confined, thus, the steam is not vented and has no means of escape and is therefore prone to condense on the oven top.se b) The moisture in all foods steams very quickly, thus even solid foods emit zeiah (e.g., a potato baked in a microwave produces droplets of steam) c) Foods splatter on the oven top and sides quite frequently.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Taking these facts into account, it is suggested that the following procedure be followed in using a microwave oven for both meat and dairy foods.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>1) Cleanliness: The oven must be kept clean from any food residue. As noted, foods cooked in a microwave oven splatter, boil over and drip <strong>One must inspect the floor, walls and top of the oven before use to ascertain that  no residue remains from previous use.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>2) The foods should be covered: \nAll foods cooked in a microwave emit steam. <strong>Thus, meat or dairy foods placed in a microwave that is used for both should be covered</strong>. Perhaps parve solid foods (e.g., a potato) can be cooked without a covering </p>\n\n<p>3) The bottom surface: \n<strong>One should not place meat and dairy dishes on the same surface</strong>. The microwave oven differs in this aspect from other ovens with regard to the following: F cooked in a microwave boil more quickly and tend to seep and spill Thus, the bottom surface has absorbed taste from both meat and dairy. Other ovens generate heat which quickly dries any food residue on the hot oven grate In addition, the pot is usually placed on a grate which does not permit liquid to collect. We noted earlier that taste cannot be transferred from vessel to vessel without the medium of liquid. In contrast, a microwave oven does not generate its own heat and the dish may rest on the flat oven bottom. As a result the oven bottom may become damp in the process of cooking. Placing a meat dish on this treifsurface may cause treif taste to be absorbed into the dish. <strong>The proper method of avoiding this problem is to use one plate under meat dishes and another plate under milk dishes. If possible, glass plates are desirable</strong> 38 </p>\n\n<p>4) Kashering a microwave oven:\n A microwave cannot be kashered in the manner of other ovens. Running the oven without food generates no heat to effect libun kal. Some permit kashering a microwave oven by means of first thoroughly wiping and cleaning all inside surfaces, waiting twenty-four hours and then boiling a bowl of water in the oven until the oven fills with steam. The steam can kasher a surface that absorbed taste likewise through steam 39 </p>\n\n\n",

I hope this isn't a problem and that my question will be appropriate here.)</em></p>\n\n<p>From the Seleucid period to the Middle Ages of Europe and, probably most famously, Nazi Germany, there are many instances of Jews being persecuted simply for being of Jewish ethnicity and/or for their religion. Is there any passage or indication anywhere in the Torah, the Talmud, or in any other authoritative collection of manuscripts, that predicts that this might happen, or explains why?</p>\n\n<p>Coming from a Christian background, I'm familiar with passages (in the Christian New Testament) that predict persecution for followers of Jesus.

Or are there alternatives?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Halachically, when we need to define \"who is a heretic\" for laws like minyan, conversion, handling wine, etc... we follow Rabbi Yosef Albo (Iqarim, 1:2) Rav Shimon ben Tzemach Duran (Ohiev Mishpat 15a) the Radvaz (Responsum 1248), and apparently the Raavad (note on Laws of Teshuvah 3:1), among others, who say that it is not belief in heresy that makes one categorizable as a heretic, but rebelling against G-d to the point of embracing heresy that does.</p>\n\n<p>And so, the dominant belief with regard to the afterlife is correspondingly that someone seeking Truth but through no fault of his own reaches the wrong conclusion is not a heretic and not deprived of a place in the World to Come. We tend to see human perfection in terms of morality, ethics, and culpability in general. Not \"does he believe heresy\" but \"is it his fault?\"</p>\n\n<p>This is true of a Jew who is misled by reading the scriptures overly literally (the Radvaz and Raavad's case), one who was raised by people with a different belief system, or, I presume, the non-Jews in question.</p>\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, personal redemption is a product of knowledge. He thus opens the Guide to the Perplexed with a discussion of how pre-sin Adam had to distinguish between truth and falsehood, and the need to distinguish between good and evil is a consequence of that first sin. In 3:18 we learn that humanness is proprotional to such knowledge, and therefore Divine Providence is as well. 3:27 describes prophecy as a step beyond philosophy. (See also 3:31, his explanation for mitzvos, and elswhere for more of the same.) And in the closing paragraphs, he ranks perfection of knowledge above moral perfection.</p>\n\n<p>And so it's consistent for him that he writes that proper knowledge is what causes reward in the afterlife (Laws of Teshuvah ch. 8). It's knowing about the Eternal One that grants one eternity (Commentary on Mishnah, introduction to Sanhedrin ch. 10). It's a causal thing, and therefore guilt and cupability don't really enter into it. (Beyond saying that someone who doesn't act G-dly wouldn't possibly know Him.)</p>\n\n<p>But this is a minority view, and not what any stream of contemporary Judaism that I know of still preaches.</p>\n\n<p>And even the Rambam, who would say that the wrong belief itself causes a lack of reward in the World to Come, would not say necessarily that it must cause its absence altogether. After all, he credits Islam and to a far lesser extent Christianity as steps along the way to the world reaching the truth. (Laws of Kings 11:10-11) With more truth, one gets more reward. Proportion, rather than all-or-nothing.</p>\n\n<p>(This depends on a long-standing debate about how Maimonides defines \"gehennom\". There is indication (Commentary on Mishnah, ibid) that he may believe that the ultimate punishment isn't \"hell\", but a cessation of existence. If that is indeed his position, then a proportional resolution isn't likely.)</p>\n\n\n",

But Harav Natan Adler did not suggest others emulate him.  </p>\n\n<p>Harav Mazuz added the following:   Ashkezanic Jews should be concerned with their mispronouncing the letters \"het\" and \"ayin\" improperly.  One can be saying \"you shall destroy Gd\" instead of \"you shall serve Gd\" or \"Gd was taken captive\" instead of \"Gd swore\" and see many such examples in sefer Sefat Emet pg162 by Harav ben Tziyon Cohen. </p>\n\n<p><strong>From this you can learn the following:</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Would there be problem with changing the pronunciations I use during davening?</strong> \nIt would seem from the above, that no its not a problem since if Rav Natan Adler did it, you can surely do the same as long as your intention is correct. The Magen Avraham objected to make these changes because of Minhag Avotenu.  In this case, however it might not apply.   </p>\n\n<p><strong>Does it matter if I switch back and forth - at least until I get used to it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Yes it could be a problem.  Of course this does not mean that while you are learning and making mistakes. Since that is part of the process of learning.  The Torah was not given to angels nor does Hashem expect perfection only to put all your effort into it.  </p>\n\n<p>Switching back and forth is however a problem, if your intent is one time to say the prayer in ashkenaz and then another in sefardi.  Because whichever pronunciation you are using, as long as your custom follows this you are at protected, since you are following the tradition of your fathers.  But when switching back like that what are you relying on? You are deliberately putting yourself in a position of mispronouncing as above by Rav Mazuz.  If now you accepted that the sefardi is the correct pronunciation, why are you switching back?  If you reject the above Rabbeim saying that the sefardi pronunciation is not the correct one, then why are you forsaking the tradition of you fathers?</p>\n\n<p>See the following series by Rabbi Daniel Glatstein for further information on this subject \"Ashkenazic Vs.

But in several other places it's the opposite, for example Devarim 31:28:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הַקְהִ֧ילוּ אֵלַ֛י אֶת־כָּל־זִקְנֵ֥י שִׁבְטֵיכֶ֖ם וְשֹֽׁטְרֵיכֶ֑ם וַֽאֲדַבְּרָ֣ה בְאָזְנֵיהֶ֗ם אֵ֚ת הַדְּבָרִ֣ים הָאֵ֔לֶּה וְאָעִ֣ידָה בָּ֔ם אֶת־הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְאֶת־הָאָֽרֶץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This time את has a yetiv, meaning הדברים are more connected to האלה.  My sense is that the yetiv version is more common than the mahpach pashta one for phrases of the form את ה____ האלה, but maybe I'm wrong.</p>\n\n<p>Why the difference?  I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around what it even means to have a greater or lesser connection to את vs. האלה.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The cantillation marks are not word-dependent, but are instead driven by the logical placement of the words in their context.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the phrase “את הדברים האלה” <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/tU9an.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appears 30 times in Scripture</a>. The phrase “את ה____ האלה” <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/QQYRG.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">appears 50 times</a>.  In both instances the cantillation marks vary. So cantillation is not tied to words, although word length and vowels play a role.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the cantillation is more tied to the logical arrangement of words within verses based on a system of logical dichotomy. For example, the schematic depiction of the cantillation structure of Deut 7:12 appears below, and below that, Deut 31:38. Please click on the respective images to enlarge for better viewing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/woEjV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/woEjV.png\" alt=\"This image provides the schematic depiction of the cantillation structure of Deut 7:12\"></a>\nPlease notice that in the example above, the word הָאֵ֔לֶּה carries the <em>Zaqef Qaton</em>, and therefore “captures” the weaker <em>Pashta</em> disjunctive accent in the word הַמִּשְׁפָּטִים֙ which is inseparably connected to אֵ֤ת in logic, because of the <em>Mahpach</em> (not the <em>Yethib</em>!<code>*</code>) on that word is the “slave” to the <em>Zaqef Qaton</em>. Therefore the word הָאֵ֔לֶּה  modifies the phrase אֵ֤ת הַמִּשְׁפָּטִים֙.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3Mpm8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3Mpm8.png\" alt=\"This image provides the schematic depiction of the cantillation structure of Deut 31:28\"></a>\nIn like manner, please notice that in the verse immediately above, the word הָאֵ֔לֶּה carries the <em>Zaqef Qaton</em> but now this word is inseparably connected to הַדְּבָרִ֣ים in logic because of the <em>Munnach</em>, which is the “slave” to the <em>Zaqef Qaton</em>. However, this two-word phrase is “capturing” the weaker <em>Yethiv</em> disjunctive accent on the Hebrew object marker אֵ֤ת. This particular emphasis on the object marker (which is not translated) would convey exclamation - <em>viz</em>., “...THESE WORDS!”</p>\n\n<p>In summary, the pronunciation of cantillation is debatable, however the logical structure of cantillation is more objective because of the dichotomies. And so it is not the words that drive the cantillation, but the logical placement of those words that drives the cantillation. That is, the disjunctive accents “cut up” the verses into dichotomies (and sub-dichotomies) which provide the logical arrangement and understanding of Hebrew verse.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><code>*</code> The <em>Yethib</em> disjunctive accent and the <em>Mahpak</em> conjunctive accent appear the same - they are “identical twins” and therefore may confuse the reader. The difference between them is that the <em>Yethib</em> falls before the vowel (on the right side) whereas the <em>Mahpak</em> will be written after the vowel (on the left side) of one-syllable words.</p>\n\n\n",

What is so important about loving other people?</p>\n\n<p>Why isn't it sufficient to command us to avoid damaging others and being respectful towards them. Why the need to go to the extent of \"loving\" them as oneself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rabbi Aqiva and Ben Azzai have a dispute as to what is the overriding principle behind the Torah. According to R' Aqiva, it is \"love your peer as yourself\", and according to Ben Azzai, it is \"these are the generations from Adam\" -- ie the common brotherhood of all people. (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%99_%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%98_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yerushalmi, Nedarim 9:4</a>)</p>\n\n<p>So your question may be very much like \"But aside from that, Mrs Lincoln, how did you like the play?\"</p>\n\n<p>Why love other people? Because the definition of a human being fulfilling their purpose is that they love other people. The answers to \"why avoid damaging others?\", \"why be respectful?\", or \"why pursue self refinement / sanctity?\" have to be framed in terms of how they help us love other people.</p>\n\n<p>More recently, in the early 19th cent, R' Chaim Volozhiner wrote the notebooks for his son R' Yitzchaq to compile into what became \"Nefesh haChaim\". A Qabbalistic work about how people can impact the metaphysics of the universe(s) and thus change the events of history (among other things), and how action, prayer and Torah study can repair the world. Usually read as most centrally focusing on the importance of Torah study. But, R' Yitzchaq Volozhiner writes in his introduction to the work:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>He would routinely rebuke me because he was that I do not share in the pain of others. This is what he would constantly tell me: that the entire person was not created for himself, but to be of assistance to others, whatever he finds to be in his ability to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Skipping ahead another century, we get to the <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/ShaareiYosher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">introduction to Shaarei Yosher</a>, written by R' Shimon Shkop. (The translations in this answer come from a more recent manuscript than the translations in the PDF.) The introduction opens:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יתברך הבורא ויתעלה היוצר\n  שבראנו בצלמו ובדמות תבניתו,\n  וחיי עולם נטע בתוכנו\n  שיהיה אדיר חפצנו,\n  להיטיב עם זולתנו,\n  ליחיד ולרבים\n  בהוה ובעתיד\n  בדמות הבורא כביכול</p>\n  \n  <p>Blessed shall be the Creator,\n  and exalted shall be the Maker,\n  Who created us in His “Image” and in the likeness of His “Structure”,\n  and planted eternal life within us,\n  so that our greatest desire should be\n  to benefit others,\n  to individuals and to the masses,\n  now and in the future\n  in imitation of the Creator (as it were).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He explains how the very definition of qedushah (holiness) is one's commitment to that goal: \"That is, that we, the select of what He made – \nshould constantly hold as our purpose to sanctify our physical and spiritual abilities,\nfor the good of the many,\naccording to our abilities.\nIn my opinion, this whole concept is included in Hashem’s mitzvah 'Be holy, [for I am Holy].'\" Be holy, ie be committed, in imitation of G-d's commitment.</p>\n\n<p>But people were created with a healthy self-interest, without which we wouldn't be motivated to value our own actions and what we make. Without self-interest, we would lack the motive to contribute to the good of others.</p>\n\n<p>So how does Rav Shimon suggest this dialectic can be resolved? By realizing that giving is not based on abnegating the self, but by extending it to include others:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The entire “I” of a coarse and lowly person is restricted only to his substance and body. Above him is someone who feels that his “I” is a synthesis of body and soul. And above him is someone who can include in his “I” all of his household and family. Someone who walks according to the way of the Torah, his “I” includes the whole Jewish people, since in truth every Jewish person is only like a limb of the body of the nation of Israel. In this [progression] there are more levels for a person who is whole, who can connect his soul to feel that all of the worlds are his “I”, and he himself is only one small limb in all of creation. Then, his self-love helps him love all of the Jewish people and [even] all of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, we are good to others by removing that otherness. We are all parts of a single whole. A unity that is the \"shadow\" of G-d's, a love and lovingkidness that emulates His.</p>\n\n<p>If the Ramchal tells us we are here in this world to perfect ourselves, Hillel, R' Aqiva, Ben Azzai et al tell us that what function a person has that we are to be perfect at -- being good to others.</p>\n\n<p>Being connected to others is imitating the Divine, it is holiness, it is doing what we're made for. It's the ultimate \"because\" behind every why.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I will add a couple of elements of answer, despite the excellent answer of @Micha Berger.</p>\n\n<p>Introduction:</p>\n\n<p>The questioner asked if not damaging other is not sufficient. On the other hand, if I love someone, naturally i will be accurate to avoid it. To feel effort to limit damages is a sign of egoism (narcisism).

We use a similar dialectical reasoning concerning the simultaneous existence of the creator and the world. The Deity imply a total extension, a space for the world.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the creation of the world, we conceptualize a totally extended One, and further a process of restrain (withdrawal) to make space for creation.</p>\n\n<p>From the human being subjective point of view. The existence of oneself is the first perception. Perception of other come further and need a restrain in a first step, to lead to a creation of a space, (in the inner conceptual world) for other. After this, the other can appear, and automatically he is loved when his existence (his good side) is perceived. From this we can also learn that many efforts are needed to reach true Emuna.</p>\n\n<p>The above is an introduction to understand the words of the Peri Haarets in Parashat Toldot. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A parallel between ANOCHI versus LO YHIE LECHA -- and Veahavta Lereacha and May de Sane lach Lechavrach Al Taaved.

    "content": "# Why are some cheeses not kosher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why are certain cheeses not kosher and some are kosher?</p>\n\n<p>From the ingredients on the label it contains no non-kosher products or ingredients in it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There are several Kosher concerns special to cheese that go beyond its ingredient list.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest is the question of \"<a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/shiur.asp?cat=270&id=28062&q=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gevinas Akum</a>\" (lit. cheese of a non-Jew). The Mishna says that cheese made by a non-Jew is forbidden, conceptually similar to wine. The exact parameters of this prohibition are debated, with opinions ranging from it is basically not operative (e.g. Rabbeinu Tam, mentioned in the Ramo in Shulchan Aruch to justify those who are lenient) to it applies to any and all forms of cheese (e.g. <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/kosher-cheese/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aruch HaShulchan</a>).</p>\n\n<p>There are two general categories of cheese that are of Halachic significance. One is hard cheese, which requires rennet or something taking the place of rennet to make it. Then you have soft cheese which is called \"acid set\" because it is made by lactic acid fermenting in the milk.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/kosher-cheese/\" rel=\"nofollow\">generally accepted practice</a> of Kashrus agencies in America, at least, is to say that cheese that <em>requires</em> rennet - that means it could not be made with the acid set method, whatever the source and kosher status of the rennet used, requires the specific stringencies to avoid Gevinas Akum. The primary one (in terms of cost and therefore availability of Kosher product) is the presence of a supervising Mashgiach who inserts the Rennet or is at least present when it is inserted.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that soft cheeses that are exempt from this often include rennet to rush the process, but since it would happen without the rennet, they are lenient.</p>\n\n<p>Besides this, looking at the ingredient panel doesn't tell you about the Kosher status of the rennet or enzymes used (nor do they even list rennet with the name rennet, it can often be called enzyme, as that is what is interesting about rennet), so you could get the impression that it is fine without realizing it. Although animal based rennet is more expensive, it is still sometimes preferred by the manufacturer.</p>\n\n<p>So the ingredients look Kosher, but are not.</p>\n\n<p>Besides this you have intermingling issues. I know of a community where the Rabbi mistakenly certified cheese without realizing that it was immersed in the same salt bath (this is called brined cheese, at it can apply to cheeses that some are claiming are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brined_cheese\" rel=\"nofollow\">soft</a> as well as hard cheese, but more commonly hard) as the non-Kosher cheese. The psak was that anyone who cooked with the cheese had to Kasher their dishes. (I subsequently spoke to a Rabbi with deep knowledge and experience in the area and he said it is an understandable mistake to make, given how cheese production is set up and presented).</p>\n\n<p>So there is a lot more to the Kashrus of cheese than its ingredients, and the ingredients themselves can be deceptive.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Hard cheeses are under similar strictures as wine.  Wine made in normal fashion is inherently kasher, however the Rabbis imposed an extra stringency that wine that was touched by a gentile becomes forbidden. The Rabbis noted that all soft rennet-less cheeses can only be made by milk from animal species that are kasher.  However, hard cheeses, cheeses that require rennet (historically part of an animals stomach) were problematic. The extra stringency against hard cheeses is under the category of givenat/gevinas akum.</p>\n<p>So the ruling brought down by the Rabbis is that all soft rennet-less cheeses are automatically kasher.  This encompasses cream cheese, mozzarella, ricotta, Greek yogurts, labneh, feta etc etc.  This is why you will notice that most cream cheeses or other soft similar cheeses all have a hecsher, because kashrut agencies can certify the cheese without having to be present. This is also why you'll see Greek or middle eastern yogurts, even of the cheapest varities, also have hecshers. Heck, even the supermarket by my house has cheap imported Mexican Melting cheeses with hecshers, because the soft cheeses don't require supervision, so it's easy for companies to get hashgacha for all soft cheeses. So in reality there is usually no difference between hecshered or unhecshered soft cheeses, as they are (typically) both equally unsupervised. Even the OU admits this is common practice for hashgacha companies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Common practice (adopted by many kashrus agencies, based on the rationale in Igros Moshe YD 2 s. 45 and approved by Rav Yosef Eliyohu Henkin) is to follow the opinion that that the gezerah of gevinas akum was only declared on hard cheese, as only hard cheese uses rennet to form into curd and was therefore subject to the prohibition. Soft cheese, such as cream cheese and cottage cheese – also called “acid-set cheese” – does not need rennet to coagulate, as it can acidify and form on its own, and such cheese is therefore not subject to the rule of gevinas akum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/kosher-cheese/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/kosher-cheese/</a></p>\n<p>Another person posted here that you can't always \"be sure\" that the ingredients are kasher. This is sometimes true. However, MANY cheese companies go out of their way to put \"non animal kosher rennet\" in the ingredients list so that way you know for sure the product is kasher, even without a hecsher. You can rely on such ingredient lists. Here is an example of non hecshered feta that is completely kasher to eat according to Rabbi Yitzchak Abadi, and lists non animal kosher rennet as part of its ingredients:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uFJ9V.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/uFJ9V.jpg\" alt=\"DOUBLE CREAM MYKONOS FETA. Ingredients: Cultured pasteurized Grade A whole milk, cream, calcium, salt, non-animal Kosher rennet. Contains: Milk.\" /></a></p>\n<p>However, hard cheeses require direct supervision by a Jew, as their was concern of rennet coming from non kasher sources being used to make the hard cheese.  These types of cheeses are cheddar, permesian, or any cheese that typically appears as a solid block.</p>\n<p>You can find more information about this through the very helpful website <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.kashrut.org</a>.\nThe website was brought into being by the renowned posek Rabbi Yitzchak Abadi to help simplify kashrut matters/questions.</p>\n<p>For sources regarding the lack of supervision, people have reached out to the OK and OU and the responses they received were that neither the OU nor the OK supervises cream cheese, and i see no reason why this wouldn't apply to other soft cheeses.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kraft Philadelphia Cream Cheese is \"supervised\" by the OK and not the OU.\nThe OK has a section on their website which indicates whether or not a Mashgiah is present for the \"cheesing\". These products as well as several types of Ricotta and Cottages cheeses that are \"supervised\" by the OK do NOT indicate that a Mashgiah is present for the production.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20041128102442/https://kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp/?mid=6773\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.kashrut.org/forum/viewpost.asp?mid=6773</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I asked Rabbi Cohen if he would eat TempTee cream cheese he gave me what at first I considered an acceptable answer. He claimed that he only eats Chalav Yisrael and therefore, no he would not eat the brand even though it is OU. When I then asked him if I took Chalav Yisrael to the TempTee factory and told them to use this milk in a batch of cream cheese, making it the\nsame way and watching it the same way as is presently done, would he eat it? he asked for some time to think about it.

If\nthe majority  would not eat it then where is the Union in Orthodox\nUnion?? I have heard many times in my life that the kashrus business\nis just that... a business, but never fully believed it before. The OU\nhas a chance to prove that it has not become merely a business.

    "content": "# Eved: why does it refer to both a slave and a servant?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What's the different between a slave and a servant, and why are both being referred to in the Tanakh as 'eved' (both are being used to translate 'eved').</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In modern English <em>servant</em> and <em>slave</em> are two terms often used to describe individuals who perform labor or service for others. However, there are distinct differences between the two, according to the source <a href=\"https://thisvsthat.io/servant-vs-slave\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thisvsthat.io</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While both servants and slaves may perform similar tasks, the fundamental distinction lies in the level of control and ownership exerted over them.</p>\n<p>A <strong>servant</strong> typically works for wages or a salary and has the freedom to choose their occupation and employer. They have certain rights and can negotiate the terms of their employment.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, a <strong>slave</strong> is someone who is owned by another person and is considered their property. Slavery involves the complete loss of personal freedom and autonomy, with slaves being forced to work without pay and subjected to harsh treatment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the precise translation of the word servant into Hebrew is either מְשָׁרֵת or שַׁמָשׁ, but not עֶבֶד. For example, <a href=\"https://thisvsthat.io/servant-vs-slave\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 33:11</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְדִבֶּ֨ר יְהוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙ פָּנִ֣ים אֶל־פָּנִ֔ים כַּאֲשֶׁ֛ר יְדַבֵּ֥ר אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֑הוּ וְשָׁב֙ אֶל־הַֽמַּחֲנֶ֔ה <strong>וּמְשָׁ֨רְת֜וֹ</strong> יְהוֹשֻׁ֤עַ בִּן־נוּן֙ נַ֔עַר לֹ֥א יָמִ֖ישׁ מִתּ֥וֹךְ הָאֹֽהֶל׃ (ס)</p>\n<p>Hashem would speak to Moses face to face, as one person speaks to another. And he would then return to the camp; but his attendant, Joshua son of Nun, [serving as] deputy, would not stir out of the Tent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, the modern definition of a servant is equivalent to the Torah definition of a שָׂכִיר / <em>sakhir</em> - a hired laborer. Additionally, as @Loani comments, the Hebrew slave or maidservant, may use the money that they get sold for, and in this sense, such a slave is closer to a servant (see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.21.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Shemos 21:8</a> and also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kiddushin.1.2?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Kiddushin 1:2</a> and Bartenura there).</p>\n<p>According to the American Heritage Dictionary, <a href=\"https://ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=slave\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the word <em>slave</em></a> goes back to about 1290 A.D., and it is derived from the word <em>sclave</em> meaning Slav, due to enslavement of slavic people by germanic people in middle ages. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">etymology</a> of the word <em>servant</em> is derived from the Latin word <em>servus</em>, which had the meaning of <em>slave</em> in ancient Rome.</p>\n<p>Therefore, usage of the word servant rather than slave for עֶבֶד, is done out of either small similarity of the modern definition with Hebrew slave, or due to its historical usage, not the modern one.</p>\n\n\n",

This could be the deeper meaning of Rashi's interpretation of the pasuk \"ve-higgadeta le-bincha ... ba'avur zeh\" - that we must explain to our children that G-d took us of Egypt in order that we keep His mitzvot.  [See Rashi & Ibn Ezra 13:8.]  Rashi understands that the primary purpose of \"magid\" is not simply to explain why we are eating matza, but rather to explain to our children why G-d took us out of Egypt - or in essence, why He has chosen us to become His nation and hence keep His mitzvot. To complement this thought, we will show how this same theme may relate as well to the very purpose of G-ds first covenant with Avraham Avinu - \"brit bein ha'btarim\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why were our slavery to Pharoah in Egypt and subsequent Exodus necessary in order to become a nation that would serve G-d? Could this goal not have been achieved by Avraham and his descendants without slavery and Exodus?</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, why did Avraham need to be told about the forthcoming slavery and Exodus?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps a different question that I answered might help here.  The Gemara in Pesachim 116a says that the Hagadah begins with גנות and concludes with שבח. Why does the גנות aspect of the Haggadah begin with the story of תרח?  Why is this significant?</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps so that the Jews do not have any cultural pride.  Our religion is not based on a cultural heritage or a Yichus (lineage) per se.  It is not Avraham, because he came from a certain family, but rather it is Avraham because of the choices he made.  Avraham rejected Avoda Zarah and embraced his mind in search of the truth.  </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps a similar idea as to why the Jewish nation had to be formed out of slavery.  Every other nation owes its formation to a particular triumph or positive defining moment.  America prides itself on the Boston Tea party etc.  However, as Jews we came from slavery.  Our only salvation was brought about exclusively by Hashem, not because of anything that we did per se to bring it about.  Even later when we faced the Egyptians, Hashem said that he would take care of it.  It says in אז ישיר that \"כִּי־גָאֹה גָּאָה.\" Unkelos in the Targum explains \"וְגֵאוּתָא דִילֵהּ הִיא\".  The true might belongs to Hashem, not man.  Our existence is totally due to Hashem’s will. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Another possible answer: The Jews became part of the Egyptian Society. They were very comfortable in Egypt.  They had become influential people.  They had positions of power and wealth.  They would not have so readily given up their comfy situation.  Chazal say that they had an arena and games and the people looked up at the Jews in their influential positions and were upset at them.  They became prominent in the society and tremendous Hatred was directed toward them. Perhaps had the Bnei Yisroel not lost their material comforts, they may have not been so willing to leave Egypt to receive the Torah and a new way of life.  We do see that even after they endured slavery and were in the Midbar they wanted to go back to Egypt despite what they had gone through. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Just to respond to the one part of your question regarding why Avraham was told:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּרוּךְ שׁוֹמֵר הַבְטָחָתוֹ לְיִשְׂרָאֵל, בָּרוּךְ הוּא. שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא חִשַּׁב אֶת הַקֵּץ לַעֲשׂוֹת כְּמָה שֶׁאָמַר לְאַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ בִּבְרִית בֵּין הַבְּתָרִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: \"וַיֹּאמֶר לְאַבְרָם יָדֹעַ תֵּדַע כִּי גֵר יִהְיֶה זַרְעֲךָ בְּאֶרֶץ לֹא לָהֶם וַעֲבָדוּם וְעִנּוּ אֹתָם אַרְבַּע מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה, וְגַם אֶת הַגּוֹי אֲשֶׁר יַעֲבֹדוּ דָּן אָנֹכִי וְאַחֲרֵי כֵן יֵצְאוּ בִּרְכֻשׁ גָּדוֹל\" (בראשית יג-יד).</p>\n<p>Blessed is He Who keeps His promise to Israel, blessed is He. For the Holy One, Blessed is He, calculated the end [of the exile], to do as He said to Avraham our father at the Covenant Between the Parts, as it is stated: And He said to Avram, “Know that your offspring will be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they will serve them and they will torment them for four hundred years. But also the nation whom they will serve I will judge, and afterward they will go out with great wealth” (Bereishis 15:13-14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Boruch Shomer Havtachaso, Hashem tells Avraham what he will do.  Why is that important?  Why does Hashem even tell him?</p>\n<p>If one is told what the plan is and then you see it unfold, you are able to learn from it and understand the strategy.  Likewise, Hashem told Avraham and the Jewish people what the plan was to show them the patterns of Hashem’s Hashgacha, his providence.  These patterns can affect the way we live.</p>\n<p>It also gave the Bnei Yisroel hope and was merciful allowing them to know they will be ultimately saved.</p>\n<p>It also provided an answer  for those that questioned God’s justice. They knew ultimately justice would be served.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Downloading a book when you've already bought a physical copy\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm starting college this semester, and my friends and I are discovering that some of the required books for our courses are seriously expensive. We've had some discussion about the ethics of downloading books from websites like <a href=\"http://libgen.io\" rel=\"nofollow\">Library Genesis</a> and other websites that host copies of the textbooks that we need. I understand that there is some discussion about downloading books generally, but we were wondering if within that discussion there is reason to be more lenient when someone holds a physical copy of the book in question. I mean, let's say I already bought the textbook for my biology course -- if we're talking about stealing the idea (because, of course, downloading a book does <em>not</em> include the taking of a physical object), then I already have legal access to the ideas contained in the book, don't I?<br>\nDoes it make a difference if the book is offered as an e-text by the publisher? Does it make a difference (as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/75965/downloading-a-book-when-youve-already-bought-a-physical-copy?noredirect=1#comment222604_75965\">one commenter implied</a>) if I would pay for a digital copy, were it not free?</p>\n\n<p>I understand that this place isn't a place to get a legitimate <em>psak</em>, but I'm just looking for ideas to bounce around until I get a chance to ask my rabbi.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n\n<p>Samuel</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I've heard from many Rabbis, Rabbi Yisroel Belsky and Rabbi Tuvya Goldstein amongst them, the same idea about  copyright laws. They said this about musical media and computer programs, but would seemingly apply to books as well. Ultimately that is up to you to decide.</p>\n\n<p>The main idea is that copyright laws do not effect your personal usage of a device. Therefore in a situation where you want to listen to the same CD in your house as you do in your car, you are not obligated to constantly transfer the CD from one place to the other. Nor are you required to buy a second copy. You may make a copy and keep one in each place. This same idea was said concerning a computer program, have one copy at home and one at work.</p>\n\n<p>It must be mentioned that this only applies to single person usage. If you are listening to the CD in your car, a family member at home is not allowed to be listening to the other copy. </p>\n\n<p>It seems simple to me that this applies to a book as well. It also seems simple that it should not matter where the source of the second copy is coming from being that the buyer has these user rights. This last point may be debatable,  but this is what seems more likely to me.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: @DoubleAA's comment jogged my memory a bit.\nI once posed the following question to Reb Dovid Feinstein. A new Hebrew edition of the Hirsch chumash had come out which had a good index in the back. It went by psukim, not pages, so I could use that index for my English version. I asked Rabbi Feinstein if I could make photo copies of the index to use with my set which I had no intention of replacing and he said yes. </p>\n\n<p>The reason I told him I had no intention of replacing my set was because other people I had spoken to over the years had thought that was a critical point in this subject. In hindsight I shouldn't have started off saying it because now I can't know if his answer depended on that point. </p>\n\n<p>But again, this is all lihagdil torah, CYLR.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How can there be a reward for doing the מצות?",
    "content": "# How can there be a reward for doing the מצות?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In פרשת ראה the Torah identifies rewards and punishments for a person keeping the מצות. It states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כו: רְאֵ֗ה אָנֹכִ֛י נֹתֵ֥ן לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם בְּרָכָ֖ה וּקְלָלָֽה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>See, this day I set before you blessing and curse: </p>\n  \n  <p>:כז\n  אֶֽת־הַבְּרָכָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּשְׁמְע֗וּ אֶל־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהוָ֣ה \n  אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה אֶתְכֶ֖ם הַיּֽוֹם׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>The blessing, if you obey the commandments of the LORD your God that I enjoin  upon you this day;</p>\n  \n  <p>כח: וְהַקְּלָלָ֗ה אִם־לֹ֤א תִשְׁמְעוּ֙ אֶל־מִצְוֺת֙ יְהוָ֣ה\n  אֱלֹֽהֵיכֶ֔ם וְסַרְתֶּ֣ם מִן־הַדֶּ֔רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֧ר אָנֹכִ֛י מְצַוֶּ֥ה\n  אֶתְכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם לָלֶ֗כֶת אַחֲרֵ֛י אֱלֹהִ֥ים אֲחֵרִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר\n  לֹֽא־יְדַעְתֶּֽם׃ </p>\n  \n  <p>And the curse, if you do not obey the commandments of\n  the LORD your God, but turn away from the path that I enjoin upon you\n  this day and follow other gods, whom you have not experienced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a person keeps the commandments they will be blessed and if they do not follow them they will be punished with a curse.  This presents a conundrum.  The Torah in many places describes the מצות as beneficial for man to keep.  As it says in Devarim, Chapter 6, verse 24 “And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that He might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.”  There are many such verses that describe the as beneficial for us to do.  </p>\n\n<p>If that is the case, then why should the Torah offer a reward of a Blessing if we are to keep the Torah?  The reward should be the keeping of the commandment itself.  If an adult was sick and there was a medicine to cure them, it would be silly to offer them a reward for them to take the medicine.  The medicine itself is beneficial.  One does not need a reward for taking the medicine.  Similarly, the commandments are for our benefit.  Why should there be a reward for keeping them?  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, if there is a material reward for the Mitzvah, then it would seem that the Mitzvah is merely a means to get the reward.  In other words, the Mitzvah is merely a way to get rewards.  Implying that the Mitzvah itself is not what is good but rather the material rewards.  The Torah itself seems to emphasize the value of the material and physical, and put a premium on the development of the soul.  By providing a material reward it seems to communicate that the material is the true value. How can we understand this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To continue along Ray's lines (see his answer)...</p>\n\n<p>Does Hashem punish us to correct evil behavior,\nor did He build the world so that sin causes punishment as a natural consequence?</p>\n\n<p>One answer\n is quite clearly stated in parashas Nitzavim. “Hatzur tamim\npa’alo… The Archetype, His work is perfect, for all of His ways are just; a reliable G-d\nwith no flaw, He is trustworthy and without iniquity. Is corruption His? No – His\nchildren’s is the blemish, a crooked and perverse generation.” (Devarim 32:5) This quote is similar. Any tribulations in our lives are not His corruption, but ours.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Yirmiyahu Hanavi writes, “From the ‘Mouth’ of the One Above, come\nneither the evil nor the good.” (Eikhah 3:38)\n Yirmiyahu is not implying that what happens to us is by\nchance. “Chai gever al chata’av – a man lives on his sins.” (Ibid v. 39)\n The suffering of the sinner is\nnot attributed to Hashem, because it is a natural consequence of the sin. Rashi6\n explains \nthe prophet by invoking R. Yochanan’s comments on a pasuq we read the prior week, in\nKi Savo, “I have placed before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; choose life\nso that you shall live!” (Devarim 30:19) In the same way, Bildad says to Iyov, “Since your children sinned to\nHim, He relegated them to the control of their iniquity.” (Iyov 8:4)\n And Rashi there explains that\n“sin inquity was made a messenger to destroy them.” (However, it is possible to say that\nBildad, a character in a dialog with whom we are not all that sympathetic, is necessarily\ncorrect.) Choosing between good and evil is not choosing between whether Hashem will\nreciprocate with life or death. By choosing between good and evil, you are choosing to\nbring upon yourself one or the other.</p>\n\n<p>Along these lines, the Ikkarim describes gehennom a natural consequence of one’s\nactions. He writes that the “fires” of gehennom” are those of shame. (Seifer haIqarim 4:33)\n Rabbeinu Yonah (Shaarei Teshuvah 4:1)\ncompares a sinful soul to a sick person. Just as a sick person suffers from his illness, the\nsinner suffers from his sins.\n From his perspective, mitzvah is a commandment more in\nthe sense of “Doctor’s orders” than of “military orders”.</p>\n\n<p>R. Chaim Vilozhiner (Derekh haChaim 1:21) derives a similar idea of gehenom as consequence of sin\nfrom a gemara in Eiruvin. “The wicked deepen gehennom for themselves.” (Eiruvin 19a)\n What you\nget in the World to Come is the consequence of the mitzvos you do. R. Chaim takes this\none step further to also make the full sequence sin to changes in the soul to reward and\npunishment in general. Each sin, he writes, causes a flaw in your soul. In true Divine\nMercy, the punishment is both the natural consequence of this flaw and a key tool for\nhealing it.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramchal too (Derekh Hashem 1:4:5) writes, “Sin detracts from one’s perfection.”\n Rav Eliyahu E.\nDessler (Michtav meiEliyahu, vol I, pp 114-114) explains the expression “aveirah goreres aveirah – one sin is followed by\n[another] sin” by saying that after repeatedly doing a given sin, it becomes part of one’s\nnature; so that no conscious decision is required next time the situation arises.</p>\n\n<p>It is equally valid to argue that Hashem rewards or punishes in <strong>response</strong> to the person's action. Rather than setting up a causal system. It's just a matter of perspective. Since Hashem is outside of the flow of time, the difference between saying He set something up during creation or performs acts during the course of the timeline is a matter of which angle of looking at things is more useful for a given question. The reality, as with most theological question, is beyond human comprehension. We just have approximating models. At times, those models will contradict.</p>\n\n<p>(All of the above is taken from my <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/10YemeiTeshuvah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">High Holiday Reader</a> for people who would otherwise be bored in synagogue.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Rambam, commentary on Mishnayot, Introduction to the chapter called \"Chelek\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם הַיִּעוּדִים הטובים והנקמות הרעות הכתובות בתורה עניינם הוא מה שאספר לך, והוא זה: כי הוא אומר לך אם תעשה הַמִּצְוֹת האלה אֲסַיֵּעַ לך\n  על עֲשִׂיָּתָן והשלמוּת בהן, ואסיר מעליך המעיקים כולם. לפי שהאדם אי\n  אפשר לו לעשות הַמִּצְוֹת לא כשהוא חולה ורעב או צמא, ולא בשעת מלחמה\n  ומצור. ולכן יָעַד שיסורו כל אלה העניָנים, ושיהיו בריאים ושקטים עד\n  שֶׁתִּשְׁלַם להם הידיעה ויזכו לחיי העולם הבא.‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Good outcomes and bad vengeances which are written in Tora - I will explain you what they are. He (G-d) say you: \"If you do these commandments, I will help you realize and perfect them\". . .for a person is unable to perform commandments when he is sick or hungry or thirsty, or in war time or Under Siege. Therefore He set it up such that these would all be avoided, and people would be healthy and calm until they'd perfectly their divine knowledge and merited the world to come.</p>\n  \n  <p>הנה כי אין תכלית שכר עֲשִׂיַּת התורה שתהיה הארץ שְׁמֵנָה, ושיחיו שנים\n  רבות, ובריאוּת הגופות, אלא שיהיו נעזרים על עֲשִׂיַּת התורה באלה הדברים\n  כולם. וכמו כן אם עברו על התורה, יהיה עונשם שֶׁיֶּאֶרְעוּ להם אותן\n  הרעות כולן, עד שלא יוכלו לעשות מִצְוָה, וכמו שנאמר #דברים כח מז-מח#:\n  \"תַּחַת אֲשֶׁר לֹא עָבַדְתָּ אֶת יְיָ אֱלֹהֶיךָ בְּשִׂמְחָה וּבְטוּב\n  לֵבָב מֵרֹב כֹּל, וְעָבַדְתָּ אֶת אֹיְבֶיךָ...\". ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>The purpose of doing the Tora is not fertile land or long life, or health; but these things should enable us to do the Tora. Likewise, if they transgressed Tora, their punishment is not all these disasters, which result to impossibility to make mitsvot, as the verse said, \"In exchange for you don't serve G-d with happiness and wholeheartedly, living in wealth, you will serve your ennemy.</p>\n  \n  <p>וכשתתבונן בזה התבוננות שְׁלֵמָה, תמצא כְּאִלּוּ הוא אומר לך: אם עשית\n  קצת מִצְוֹת מאהבה והשתדלות – אֶעֱזָרְךָ לעשותן כולן, ואסיר מעליך\n  המעיקים והמונעים. ואם תעזוב דבר מהם דרך ביזוי, אביא לך מונעים ימנעוך\n  מֵעשותן כולן, עד שלא יהיה לך שלמוּת ולא קיום בעולם הבא. ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And when you think about this completely, you will see that He is saying to you: if you did some commandments out of love and [sincere] effort - I will help you do them all, and I will remove the tormentors and impediments from you. But if you will leave a part of them by disregard, I will send to you impediments which will prevent you from making all the mitsvot, so that you will not acquire perfection and you will no longer exist in comming world's live. This is the explanation.</p>\n  \n  <p>וזהו עניָן אמרם זכרונם לברכה #אבות פ\"ד מ\"ב#: \"שכר מצוָה – מצוָה, ושכר עבירה – עבירה\".‏</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is the meaning of wises's statement \"Reward for mitsva is mitsva, and reward for transgression is transgression.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, you see that the reward is intrinsecly linked to the making-mitsva topic. But the reward for a mitsva is itself mitsva according to Rambam. It is one of the answers to your question. the reward is to continue with mitsvot. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the book Darash Moshe parsha Reeh (artscroll) he says exactly this. the verse does not say \"A blessing, <em>if</em> you obey the commandments\" as you translated (and as it says by the curse) but rather \"A blessing, <em>that (asher)</em> you obey the commandments\". He deduces that the mitzva is itself the blessing.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where did the first parah adumah come from?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first mishna in Parah talks about the age that a cow can be and still be valid as a parah adumah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי אליעזר אומר עגלה בת שנתה ופרה בת שתים וחכ\"א עגלה בת שתים ופרה בת שלש או בת ארבע ר\"מ אומר אף בת חמש כשרה הזקנה אלא שאין ממתינין לה שמא תשחיר שלא תפסל</p>\n<p>R' Eliezer says a calf is in its first year, a cow is in its second year.  The Chachamim say a calf is in its second year, a cow is in its third year.  R' Meir says even an old cow in its 5th year is ok, but we don't wait because it might grow black hairs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first parah adumah was done on the second of Nissan (Rashi in several places but I can't find them now).  This means that the cow was born in Egypt.  According to R' Eliezer, it could have been born as late as Rosh Chodesh Nissan of החדש הזה לכם (which is a nice connection to reading Parah the week before Hachodesh).  According to the Chachamim and R' Meir, it was born before the plagues even started!  Either way, how did its owner know to treat it specially and not accidentally disqualify it by putting something on it?</p>\n<p>Several suggestions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>A younger cow can be used bedieved?  The Rash and Tosfot Yom Tov on that mishna suggest that an older cow is ok bedieved even according to R' Eliezer, so maybe a younger one is too.  But I haven't found anyone who says so explicitly, and the Rambam at the beginning of Hilchot Parah strongly implies that it's not.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The owner had no idea, but Hashem made a miracle that nobody ever ended up putting any burdens on it?  It's possible, but then how did the owner remember that he hadn't done it without thinking, since he would have had no reason to think about it?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It was a wild cow that Hashem caused to wander into the camp?  Again this raises the same question - how did anyone know that it had never had a burden on it?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Hashem told the owner of the cow to be careful with it through a private, unrecorded nevuah?  (According to the Chachamim/R' Meir it would have to be through Miriam or Aharon or someone else, since Moshe was still in Midyan.)  This would need a very strong source.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I remember an aggada in which a gentile sold a Para Aduma to the Sanhedrin and put a yoke on it just before he delivered it. The chachamim were able to tell that he had done so because it broke certain hairs on the back of its neck and those hairs would never grow back in the same way. I do not recall the source of this aggada, but it could point to the reason that they could tell (at Mara) that a cow had not been used.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason could be that since the halacha of Para Adumah was given at Mara, they could have separated out calves of the appropriate ages (which would have been too young to use for work) so that they could be used when they became old enough (the following Rosh Chodesh Nisan). </p>\n\n<p>The youngest calf according to Rav Eliezer would have been born just before the first Rosh Chodesh Nisan before they left Mitzraim so that it entered its second year the Adar after Marah. It would have definitely been too young to have any burden put on it before Marah, and the halacha was known after that so it would have been watched. According to the Chachamim (in its third year), it would have been born the year before the Exodus. Here too, by the time it was old enough to \"bear a burden\" the plagues would have started and Bnei Yisrael would not have been using the young animals for work.</p>\n\n<p>The owner would certainly remember what he had done with the animals under his control because of the \"work stoppage\" entailed by the plagues and the Exodus.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Perhaps the law only kicks in when it's given (i.e. at Marah and/or at Sinai) and is not retroactive, such that all red cows at the time of <em>matan torah</em> are eligible even if they worked the day before.  Alternatively, perhaps because the Egyptians revered their livestock, there was at least a population of cows that were known to have never been used.</p>\n\n\n",

I know that a lot of people believe that it's impossible to be born as a homosexual, but I had it in my nature even before I entered school.

All the men that I ever encountered in my life only thought about sex and women's assets and their own pleasure, even if they tried to hide it it would still be obvious. Have they ever thought about pure love or is selfish pleasure all what's in their mind?</p>\n\n<p>Is it so wrong that no matter how much I tried to consider men I still can't help but to be attracted to women?</p>\n\n<p>I had recently come to terms where I realized that I don't really want to love men and I can't help but feel that I'm born to be thrown in hell for the way I was born and it honestly depresses me, even more when I hear what Hashem did to previous homosexuals. Sometimes I ask myself if Hashem hates me for loving women, and it's something I dread.</p>\n\n\n",

The first two correspond to 1) inner layer of \"sovev kol almin\" which is totally removed from the worlds, and 2) the outer layer of \"sovev kol almin\" which is a general energy that sustains the worlds every instant. So far it's been going pregressively down. However, I don't understand the placement of the 3rd level, which the Alter Rebbe, quoting the Arizal, lists as\"mochin steemin,\" here:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמנם מ\"ש הג' למו\"ס אף דמו\"ס הוא בחי' חכמה שבכתר בחי' סוכ\"ע היינו לפי שהוא דיבר בשרש בחי' ממכ\"ע שבעולם האצי'. והנה כמו שבי\"ע ממש התהוותם יש מאין מבחי' מל' דאצילות שהוא מקור בחי' ממכ\"ע דבי\"ע כמ\"כ באצי' יש ג\"כ בי\"ע היינו או\"א הם בריאה דאצילות וכמ\"ש והחכמה מאין תמצא שהיא נק' בריאה יש מאין וזהו ענין בורא קדושים ישתבח שמך כמ\"ש במ\"א וגם קנה חכמה קנה בינה ב\"פ קנה בגימט' יש והאין שממנו תמצא החכמה הוא בחי' כתר והוא ג\"כ ע\"י ב' המשכות ממלא וסובב א\"פ וא\"מ וח\"ס הוא מקור לבחי' הא\"פ וכמ\"ש בע\"ח שער א\"א פ\"ד\n  translation: however, what [the arizal] wrote that the third is mochin steemin, even though that mochin steemin is the level of chochmah of keser in the level of sovev kol almin, that is according to that it is in the source in the level of memale kol almin that's in the world of atzilus. And behold like that Bria Yetzira Asiya literally is created something from nothing from the level of malchul of atiluz that is the source of the level of memale kol almin of bria yetira asiya, like so in atzilus there's also bi'a, that is abba and imma (chochmah and binah), theybria of atzilus, and like it says, \"and chochah comes from nothing\", that it's called \"a creation\" something from nothing, and this is the idea of \"he creates holy ones who praise his name\", like it says in another place. ANd also \"acquire bina acquire chochmah\", the gematria of \"acquire\" 2 times in \"yesh [something],\" and \"nothing\" that's from it is found the chochmah, which is the level of keser and it is also through the two flows of \"memale\" and \"sovev\", \"or pnimi\" and \"or makif\", and chocha stima is the source to the level of the or pnimi and like it's written in aytz chaim shar a\"a p\"d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(so now you can see why it wasn't translated earlier)</p>\n\n<p>If someone can help explain this quote for me on if mochin steemin is above or below the two levels mentioned before, and where exactly is it (it seems to say chochmah of keser but I'm not totally sure).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The confusion is that you are getting lost between the language of Chassidut and the language from Ari z\"l, meaning Chassidic nomenclature and kabbalistic nomenclature. The Alter Rebbe also flips perspective, meaning whether one is observing from above to below or from below to above.</p>\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe starts by quoting Pri Etz Chaim (language of the Ari z\"l) and says that the three kedushot of the melachim correspond to the three levels from lowest to highest of RDL\"A, Keter Ila'ah and Chochmah Stimah.</p>\n\n<p>He takes a break in that statement to explain that even though Chochmah Stimah is the aspect of Chochmah of Keter, Chochmah Stimah is the 'head' or 'beginning' of the heads for all the other Chochmot'. He says that this corresponds to the third and highest aspect of 'Kadosh' (if looking from below to above) because it corresponds to the aspect of the hairs above the head (and not the brains within the head). [<em>The first two levels, meaning the first two times 'Kadosh' is said by the Melachim, are associated with the brains within the head and the skull itself.</em>] </p>\n\n<p>It should be noted in this allegory that 'hairs' are compared to 'tzinorot', meaning 'tubes' or 'conduits'. 'Tzinor' (צנור) is associated with 'Ratzon' (רצון), which transcends intellect. The hairs of the beard flow from above to below, the idea of 'brachah' and 'kedushah'. The hairs on the top of the head remain above. </p>\n\n<p>This distinction relates to what the Alter Rebbe discusses earlier in the chapter concerning the distinction between 'Kedusha' and the 'Sitra Achra'. The one receives vitality voluntarily and with will and the other involuntarily, 'tossed over the shoulder'. Additionally, the hairs of the beard are 'tahor', while those on top of the head are 'tameh' in the lower, physical world. This relates to the idea that on the level of 'Ratzon' there is no 'expressed' aspect of the left. All is from the aspect of the right. Expression of the aspect of 'left', meaning where you have something separate and in opposition to HaKadosh, Baruch Hu, only happens on the level of worlds. </p>\n\n<p>He then recaps in order, from above to below, saying Chochmah Stimah is called 'Kadosh v'Muvdal'. Then Keter Ila'ah is called Makif v'Sovev. This is because the aspect of 'Keter' also has within itself the qualities of 'Sovev' and 'Memaleh' from the expression 'koteret'. [<em>There is an inner side to a ring and and outer side to a ring.</em>] And finally the third and lowest level is 'Atik' which is called 'Makif to Makif'. And this corresponds to the concept of the three times of saying 'Kadosh.</p>\n\n\n",

The famous posek, Rav Pesach Eliyahu Falk zt\"l wrote an English sefer called <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=MY4xtbRlxWIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=rabbi%20falk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwidlquV6NTsAhVQilwKHVOlDawQ6AEwBnoECAgQAg#v=onepage&q=sheitel&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'Oz Ve-hadar Levusha: Modesty an Adornment for Life'</a> published by Feldheim.</p>\n<p>He features a whole chapter that deals with sheitels and the potential issues to watch out for (with source citations to back up his points). In the above link on Google books if you read from page 245 he lists a series of incorrect types of sheitels. Some excerpts are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>Sheitels that are unusual, long or eye-catching</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some sheitels have an unkempt wild look to them. Such sheitels do not comply with the basic requirement of <em>midas hatznius</em>, since a woman wearing such a sheitel will be noticed wherever she goes because of her unusual and disarranged appearance. Also, such sheitels demonstrate a carefree approach to life. This is totally out of character for a <em>tznua</em> who is blessed with <em>Yiras Shomayaim</em> and is constantly careful...Other sheitels have been manufactured or set in elaborate immodest styles are are not fit to be warn in by <em>N'shei Yisroel</em> who are inherently refined and self-effacing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Long styles</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some sheitels are long and loose, and lie flowingly over the young woman's shoulders or even hang down her back. There could hardly be a more undignified way of fulfilling this mitzvah than to copy hair styles sported by the common females of the <em>umas ha'olam</em>...Many <em>Gedolei Eretz Yisroel</em> (and of other communities) have ruled that women should not wear long sheitels even when the hair is bound together behind the head...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conspicuous, lop-sided sheitels</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sheitels that a have a deliberate and excessive difference in style on the two sides, e.g. on the right side the hair hangs forward over the eye and covers almost half the face, whilst on the left side it is brushed back behind the ear, are unrefined. This type of style is made to be highly conspicuous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>A Sheitel so well made that it is barely detectable</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...it is totally incorrect and against the will of the Torah for a woman to wear a sheitel that has been manufactured to such perfection that to an onlooker (who does not know that she is married) she appears to be an unmarried girl.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The</strong> <em><strong>issur</strong></em> <strong>to wear a 'window-sheitel'</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...This is the \"window-sheitel\", which is a sheitel with a hole in it. Through it the woman pulls out a section of her own hair This she mingles with the hair of the sheitel that is in the majority, claiming that although her hair improves the appearance of the sheitel, her hair is annulled in the majority of the synthetic hair (בטול ברוב).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So with all of this in mind, a correct sheitel according to Rav Falk would be:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Of a shorter, modest length</li>\n<li>Clearly a sheitel (i.e. as opposed to one that looks too real)</li>\n<li>Covers the whole head without a hole or any real hair being worked into it</li>\n<li>and of a normal (possibly symmetrical?) cut to avoid any conspicuous looks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Even if we say that the Kriat Shema of bedtime made you quite for the mitsvat KS and Yetsiat Mitsrayim (If you said also Vayomer). If you read in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1063\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S.A. O.C. 239</a> and mefarshim, you will see that to say some psalms for shmira after blessing hamapil because of the importance of Shmira. A fortiori, a mitsva as Arvit. 2 brachot before Shema, 2 after it. Even to go at Shtiblech to pray be minyan is allowed. In the Tur & Bet Yosef at the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x947\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">same siman</a> there is no mention of \"prohibition to speak\", but Bet Yosef mentioned in name of Kol Bo, Rabenu Yerucham and Rokeach, not to eat, drink or speak after KS al Hamita. No mention of Hamapil. No mention of praying or make a mitsva or to go to bathroom. </p>\n\n<p>You need to make a separation between 2 problems, 1.- is the bracha of Hamapil canceled if after it you make something, is it Bracha Levatala and you need to say Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuto... , need you to blessing it next time at the new bedtime. 2.- Is there a cancellation of all obligation through this Bracha.</p>\n\n<p>The second point is obviously not right, because for such a Chiddush we need a proof and nobody in SA treat this. The Magen Avraham told about a man who want to be in marital relationship and advise to say Hamapil after but he doesn't say that marital relationship is prohibited after Hamapil.</p>\n\n<p>The only considerations concerning things after Hamapil are Lechatechilla (is it right to make this a priori). But nothing is written Bedieved (a posteriori).</p>\n\n<p>Arvit is a duty (despite that originally arvit is reshut) and we need to consider it as a duty already at the time you said Hamapil. You cannot cancel a duty.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This is quite an interesting question! One would surely say maariv, even if he said birkat hamapil. Ideally, one would fall asleep for a small amount of time, wake up, and say maariv, but if this isn’t possible then just say maariv.</p>\n\n\n",

The Asufi of the Mishna has several possible statuses: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mamzer\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mamzer</a> (bastard), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goy\" rel=\"nofollow\">Goy</a> (gentile), etc. </p>\n\n<p>The Mishna in the 4th perek (chapter) of Kiddushin, Mishnayot 1-3, Daf (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folio#Page_numbering\" rel=\"nofollow\">folio</a>) 74a, follows <strong>Rabbi Eliezer</strong>, and Rambam rules accordingly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כיצד שתוקים ואסופים וספק ממזרים אסורים לבוא זה עם זה ואם נשאו לא יקיימו אלא יוציאו בגט והולד ספק כאבותיו. ואין לספיקות אלו תקנה אלא שישאו מן הגרים והולד הולך אחר הפגום: ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>They would marry a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_to_Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow\">gior</a>et (convert), who is also prohibited for a Kohen. You see that there is <strong>no Chashash Kohen and Challalut</strong> (no fear of being Kohen or unfit offspring of Kohen). The prohibition added by Rabbi Eliezer is because he thinks that the \"Maala Asu Beyochasin\" (the sages' stringencies on pedigree), while efforts to avoid marriage with a Safek Mamzerim (possible bastards), exist even for other Sfekot (people of uncertain pedigree). There are many Mishnayot in Masechet Yebamot concerning Safek Kohanim (possible Kohens), e.g. when babies of Jewish women are mixed, where all Chumrot (stringencies) of Kohen are applied to the Sfekot. See Yebamot <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01301.html#HtmpReportNum0080_L2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna 11, 5</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On Daf 73a, according to the <strong>Chachamim</strong>, the Gemara asks about Asufi and Asufit (male and female foundlings), e.g. what about possible siblings. It concludes that this is not a frequent occurrence. You can ask; If he is a Kohen and she is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaritans#Jewish_sources\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kuti</a>t (Cutheans – today considered gentiles) or other Psuls (pedigree disqualifications). However, the prohibition against marrying Mamzerim is not a prohibition according to the Rabanan (the sages – who differed from Rabbi Eliezer), so <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudical_hermeneutics#Kal_va-chomer_.28.D7.A7.D7.9C_.D7.95.D7.97.D7.95.D7.9E.D7.A8.29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kal Vachomer</a> (a fortiori) regarding Kehuna and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_disqualifications_for_the_Jewish_priesthood#Marital_defilement\" rel=\"nofollow\">Isure Kehuna</a> (those that Kohanim are prohibited from marrying). According to the Rabanan, the Kehuna (priesthood) is not a problem, and Rabbi Eliezer agrees.</p>\n\n<p>See Bet Shmuel <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7506\" rel=\"nofollow\">E.H 4, sk 54</a> for an extensive explanation which combines all Sfekot. I will Bli Neder (though without promising anything) summarize it further soon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes.  Foundlings are quite limited in marriage.</p>\n\n<p>The mishna on Kiddushin 69a lists ten categories of Jews and which are allowed to marry which others.  This discussion doesn't include additional restrictions like that kohanim can't marry divorcees; this is just about lineage.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Kohanim, Levites, and Israelites may all intermarry.</p></li>\n<li><p>Levites, Israelites, <em>halalim</em>, proselytes, and freedmen (but not kohanim) may all intermarry. </p></li>\n<li><p>Prosselytes, freedmen, <em>mamzerim</em>, <em>netinim</em>, <em>shetuki</em>, and <strong>foundlings</strong> may all intermarry.  (On these last two, the mishna says that the <em>shetuki</em> knows who his mother is but not his father (so he knows he's Jewish but doesn't know his tribe), while a foundling was gathered in from the street and knows neither his father nor his mother.  But if he's circumcised the g'mara assumes he's Jewish.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

I know that most people say that she is the daughter of Laivi, and thus the aunt of Amram, I most definitely think this cannot be the case. Because the Torah She-baal peh states that Amram was one of the four people who never sinned in their life, and the Yisroelim were in only obligated in the Noachide Laws (and I'm guessing they also held on to other traditions, you know, from their forefathers) and one of the Noachide laws (#4 to be exact) is that incest is not permitted.</p>\n<p>So, if Yocheved is the aunt of Amram, then Amram would have been doing a Aveirah for quite some time, and thus makes the account that he never sinned questionable, which is not true.</p>\n<p>Also when it says that she is a daughter of Levi, it could mean granddaughter, because a granddaughter can be considered a daughter in the Hebrew language.

Also, since the gemara in kiddushin (1a) entertains the idea of 'kesef, shtar and(/or) biah', could this suggest that the system in place now (e.g. Rabbis, formal ceremony, eidim, etc.) is more of a formality (to cover all bases) and in reality a lot less is needed to be considered technically married, albeit not lechatchila)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Halachically, a person must give the <em>shava peruta</em> in front of two kosher witnesses and write a kesuvah signed by two kosher witnesses.

I also know of a case in which this was not discovered until after the wedding and enabled the bride to remarry after she ended the marriage without a get. Rav Moshe Feinstein and Rav Henken discuss the matter and bring up the halachos of getting \"married\" with only a civil ceremony.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the secular laws of inheritance and <em>marriage benefits</em> are involved which also require other than \"pure halachic\" marriage.</p>\n\n<p><em>Just under the rabbinate</em> just means that a valid rav has certified that the aidim (witnesses) are kosher, that the man has properly given the <em>shaveh perutah</em> to perform kiddushin, the kesuvah is written and witnessed properly, and that there are no problems that would invalidate the kiddushin (and nesuin). As long as this has been done, there would be no halachic problems. The <em>just under the rabbinate</em> is a legal matter done by the state to ensure that this is true. </p>\n\n<p>The state has rules that affect the legal status, which is a different matter as discussed in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/25870/need-for-civil-marriage-license-in-the-frum-world\">need for civil marriage license in the frum world</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>However, a state marriage is necessary for other non-Judaism-related\n  purposes, which may (I don't know) include some tax breaks,\n  inheritance issues, custody issues in case of divorce, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14146/if-a-jewish-couple-is-married-through-a-civil-ceremony-alone-do-jewish-marriage\">If a Jewish couple is married through a civil ceremony alone, do Jewish marriage laws apply to them thereafter?</a></p>\n\n<p>The <em>under the rabbinate</em> specification can also be used to ensure that the mesader kedushin can be trusted.

There are (<em>practically</em>) no obligations one to another.</li>\n<li><strong>Nissuin</strong> (cohabiting) is the last, when the couple is considered married <strong>to start all obligations of the husband to his wife and the opposite</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>So for judging illicit relations the first step is sufficient, and for judging responsibilities, the second is required.</p>\n\n<p>Second, there are no minimum or maximum requirements. Valid and willing way of Kiddushin in front of two valid witnesses is the only requirements for Kiddushin. And secluding afterword in a room or a house only <strong>when the woman is not Nidah</strong> is the only requirement for Nissuin. No other behaviors are really \"requirements\" for a valid marriage.</p>\n\n<p><em>NB: it should be noted, however, that all marriages are conditioned \"על דעת חכמים\" (in the eyes of the Sages) with an option to be invalidated retroactively by a Jewish court.</em></p>\n\n\n",

For the sake of this question would it be possible not to include those martyred during World War II. I am more interested in individual martyrdoms or a small group of individuals, say 2 or 3 people (may be increased for a family, etc.). </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Generally martyrs are not honored in jewish prayer services and places of worships as is done in some other parts of the world. Generally no statues or paintings of them are depicted. \nThat being said: there are times in the jewish calendar when the service brings to mind the suffering of the jewish people and our hope for redemption and the rebuilding of Jeruzalem. This means that on the 9th of Av special dirges (kinnot) are recited in which some of them feature the horrific death of 'the ten martyrs', and as done in some communities on Jom Kippur (e.g., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Martyrs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ten Martyrs</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The focus is not specifically on honoring the martyrs, but as a focus for self-reflection among others. As far as I know, there is no clear custom of honoring specific martyrs. </p>\n\n<p>In addition there is a communal kaddish that is said in most communities at certain times of the year in which martyrs (i.e., those that died 'al kiddush hashem': in sanctification of G'ds name) are commemorated. </p>\n\n<p>There are probably many reasons for why in Judaism there is no specific tradition to honor martyrs, although I would not think it strange if this costum to focus on deifying martyrs is a custom that evolved from the ancestor-worship practices by the romans. Another interesting take on it is written on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/788008/jewish/What-is-the-Jewish-View-on-Martyrdom.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a>; and approaches it from the perspective that martyrdom is not a virtue to persue; the emphasis in Judaism is to practice it in life:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Judaism, martyrdom is called Kiddush Hashem—\"the sanctification of\n  G‑d's name,\" and a martyr is called kadosh—\"holy.\" And yet, a Jew is\n  not permitted to seek martyrdom, but rather to seek life and sustain\n  life. True, the Talmud says of those who died al Kiddush Hashem that\n  their place in the world to come is beyond the reach of any created\n  being. But then, the same Talmud also teaches that, \"One hour of\n  return and good deeds in this world is more beautiful than all the\n  life of the world to come.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On Yom Kippur (literally the day of atonement), Ashkenazi Jews read the poem, Eleh Ezkerah (these I shall remember), commemorating the 10 most famous martyrs in Jewish history. Sephardic Jews read it on Tisha B'av, the saddest day in the Jewish calendar: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midrash_Eleh_Ezkerah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Eleh Ezkerah (Wikipedia)</a>.</p>\n\n<p>On Tisha B'av, we also read Kinnos, or sad poems, which discuss the destruction of the first and second Temple, the Crusades, the Holocaust, etc. Many of these Kinnos have stories about martyrs.</p>\n\n\n",

The tradition teaches that the Ultimate Good must logically include the ability to be like Him, and therefore must include the possibility of being creative beings who can commit ourselves to bestowing Good upon others as well. We therefore live in an imperfect world and we are imperfect people so that we can complete ourselves, giving ourselves self-definition as He has, and so that there are wrongs for us to right. In what might seem a paradox, being people in an imperfect world is closer to the Ultimate Good than being passive recipients in a perfect one. And it is from that dialectic that all of the complexity of the human condition emerges.</p>\n\n<p>G-d therefore gave humanity a system of seven laws by which to perfect that Image of the Divine, the being within us who can give to others. He also gave humanity a living text, the Jewish People, as a priest caste to help us achieve that goal. Something Judaism has done, often without conscious trying, in the rise of ethical monotheism around most of the world, including being the cause of Christianity and Islam.</p>\n\n<p>And to help the Jews achieve our additional mission, we were given a much more complex rite, and a complex Torah with which to determine that rite. Because the \"text\" is supposed to be living in the Jewish People, most of the Torah was left oral, for us to evolve as we do, so that the \"parchment\" is primarily not that of the Torah scroll, but of the Jewish soul.</p>\n\n<p>All these mitzvot and their myriad details are a discipline to help Jews partner with G-d in bestowing good upon others. This requires building a relationship with Him, it requires honing one's character to be more like His, to be both giving (chessed) and have self-discipline (gevurah). In other words, to produce the golden eggs of bestowing on others, and the much more time occupying take of caring for the goose, the soul which can do so.</p>\n\n<p>To insure that the evolution of Torah and its displine for life do not lose their target meaning, that human involvement in the process does not fall prey to ethical and moral fashions that the Maker knows will bestow things that are not the Ultimate Good in the long run, He anchored that process in a legalistic framework. And so, halakhah -- Jewish Law, evolves, but according to laws of how it should evolve.</p>\n\n<p>We could not ignore the effects of electronica on the experience of Shabbos because that would mute its effect as part of caring for the goose that lays the golden eggs, the production of giving souls. Self-discipline is a major part of the point, having well defined exercises in partnering with G-d, in resisting the momentary satisfaction of creature comforts when it gets in the way of long-term good, and in giving to others.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>(The above is based on Rav Shimon Shkop's introduction to Shaarei Yosher, available with translation <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/ShaareiYosher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>; Rav Dessler's Discourse on Lovingkindness, available in Strive for Truth, vol. 1, pp 118-159; and Rav Shlomo Wolbe's Olam haYedidus (world of affection), a variant of which is available in translation <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/asp/RWolbesWorld.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

At worst, the goal of these lies would be to ensure--through cohesion, through personal and communal discipline, through mutual responsibility, and through insularity--the survival of a people. </p>\n\n<p>Why we make and refine (and refine, and refine) our myths, then, is because we seek good through them.

    "content": "# The changeability though prayer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the questions I found really interesting was the following one: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/29109/if-hashem-doesnt-change-how-does-prayer-work\">If HaShem doesn't change, then how does prayer work</a>. Of course there are some verses within the Tenach (1 Shmuel 15:29, Malachi 3:6 etc) that seem to declare that HaShem is unchangeable, but on the other hand we find Moshe and Avraham have a conversation in which they are trying to change the outcome of certain events.</p>\n<p>Tefillah is from the root palel and so we say that prayer is meant to change ourselves. Then I became wondering if Tefillah does change something just like the choices we make change certain outcomes. So could it be that by changing ourselves, we could change certain outcomes (even minor ones).</p>\n<p>It’s not going to take one major choice. But when you put together a series of choices, they create momentum and results, that will determine the results you get.</p>\n<p>Every time you make a choice, you’re either getting closer to your goal or further away. The immediate effect might be so tiny; you won’t notice a difference.</p>\n<p>For example, if you have that piece of cake, it’s steering you closer to gaining weight. It’s not much, but you’ve taken a tiny step in that direction. On the other hand, if you pass on the piece of cake, you’re taking a step in the other direction.</p>\n<p>The choice to eat cake won’t have a big immediate impact in the short run, but now multiply each choice by 365 days and after a year you will have gained weight or lost weight.</p>\n<p>If we change ourselves and become more connected to HaShem with Tefillah, could it be that because we're changed, our view, deeds, emotions etc change, by that the outcome of certain things could change?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is exactly the point made by R. Yosef Albo, z\"l, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaIkkarim%2C_Maamar_4.18.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer ha'Ikarim 4:18.</a>. He suggests that in fact it is not G-d who changes His mind but it is a man who changes. Prayer is so powerful that it is quite possible that the person who concludes his sincere and heartfelt petition to G-d through prayer is not the same person who began the prayer. The evil decree still stands; after all it was divinely ordered. But the offender no longer exists. Prayer transformed him into a different person. (R. Shimon Taub \"The Laws of Tzedakah and Maaser\", Foreword, p. XXXII.)</p>\n<p>Here's the translation of the words of R. Albo, z\"l:</p>\n<p>The reason which leads men to doubt the efficacy of prayer is the same as that which leads them to deny God’s knowledge. Their argument is as follows: Either God has determined that a given person shall receive a given benefit, or He has not so determined. If He has determined, there is no need of prayer; and if He has not determined, how can prayer avail to change God’s will that He should now determine to benefit the person, when He had not so determined before? For God does not change from a state of willing to a state of not willing, or vice versa. For this reason they say that right conduct is of no avail for receiving a good from God. And similarly they say that prayer does not avail to enable one to receive a benefit, or to be saved from an evil which has been decreed against him.</p>\n<p>Job argues in this manner in the name of the wicked and inclines to it. Sceptically he asks, If God takes notice of human conduct, why does He not punish the wicked for believing in this manner? (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.21.7-8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 21:7-8</a>) “Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power? Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes … (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.21.14-15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 21:14-15</a>) Yet they say unto God: ‘Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’” This shows their opinion that right conduct is of no benefit: “What is the Almighty that we should serve Him?” and that prayer is of no avail: “And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?” The reason for this belief is their opinion that when a certain evil has been determined for any one, it can not be annulled in any way.</p>\n<p>That Job was inclined to sympathize with this idea appears from the remark which follows: (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.21.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 21:16</a>)“Lo, their prosperity is not in their hand; the counsel of the wicked is far from me.” The meaning is, I see that their prosperity is not in their hands, i.e. they can not increase their goods by right conduct, nor do their evil deeds injure them by taking away from them the benefits which they get. Hence I say:  “The counsel of the wicked is far from me.” That is, the divine plan which decides that these wicked men should spend their lives in prosperity is far from my understanding. Therefore I say that everything is pre-ordained, for if everything were not pre-ordained, and right conduct were of any benefit, the wicked should have misfortune for their deeds. But it is not so, for: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.21.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Iyov 21:17)</a> “How oft is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity cometh upon them? That He distributeth pains in His anger?” That is, how often does it happen that they are punished for their evil deeds, and that God sends misfortunes upon them in His anger on account of their wrong doing? From this it seems that Job inclined to the opinion of the wicked men who said that everything is pre-ordained, and that neither right conduct nor prayer can avail to annul the pre-determined event.</p>\n<p>But this opinion is not true, for the influences from above come down upon the recipient when he is in a certain degree and state of preparation to receive them. And if a person does not prepare himself, he withholds the good from himself. For example, if it has been determined from on high that a given person’s crops shall prosper in a given year, and he neglects to plow or sow his land that year, then God may bring the most abundant rain upon the land, but his crops will not prosper, seeing that he has not plowed or sowed. He withheld the good from himself because he did not prepare himself to receive it.</p>\n<p>Job argues in this manner in the name of the wicked and inclines to it. Sceptically he asks, If God takes notice of human conduct, why does He not punish the wicked for believing in this manner? “Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, wax mighty in power? Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their offspring before their eyes … Yet they say unto God: ‘Depart from us; for we desire not the knowledge of Thy ways. What is the Almighty, that we should serve Him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?’ ” This shows their opinion that right conduct is of no benefit: “What is the Almighty that we should serve Him?” and that prayer is of no avail: “And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?” The reason for this belief is their opinion that when a certain evil has been determined for any one, it can not be annulled in any way.</p>\n<p>Our idea therefore is that when a benefit is determined in favor of any one, it is conditional upon a certain degree of right conduct. This must be taken to be a general principle as regards the promises in the Bible. In the same way when a certain evil is determined upon some one, it is also conditional upon his being wicked in a certain degree or of being predisposed to it. And <em>if the degree of wickedness or predisposition thereto changes, the pre-determined event or fate changes also necessarily for the better or the worse</em>.</p>\n<p>The matter is similar to the hypothetical case of a king who made a decree that all the uncircumcised persons in a given country should be killed, or should receive a talent of gold. Now if one of the people has himself circumcised, there is no doubt that the decree is of no effect so far as he is concerned, whether for good or for evil, by reason of the <em>new state into which the person has been brought</em>. The effort, therefore, to do good is essential everywhere, for it serves as a preparation for the reception of the divine influence or for the annulment of a divine decree.</p>\n<p>This is in agreement with the statement of our Rabbis (Bereshis Rabba 59:1): “Rabba came to Mamla (Meimla), and saw that all the people had black hair (i.e. were young). He inquired for the reason and was told that they were descendants of Eli, concerning whom it is said (Sh'muel A 2:33); ‘And all the increase of thy house shall die young men.’ Then he said to them: Go and study the Torah, concerning which it is written (Devarim 30:20): ‘For she is thy life and the length of thy days.’ ” From this it is clear that divine decrees are conditional upon the recipient being in a certain state and degree of preparation. And if that changes, the decree changes also. <em>This is the reason why the Rabbis say (Rosh Hashanah 16b) that a change of name may avail to nullify a decree, as also change of conduct may have the same effect.</em></p>\n<p>In this way repentance benefits a wicked man, for <em>through repentance he becomes another person</em>, as it were, concerning whom no such decree was made. Take the case of Ahab. The Bible says concerning him (Melakhim A 21:25): “But there was none like unto Ahab, who did give himself over to do that which was evil in the sight of the Lord,” and a divine decree was made against him. And then, because he fasted, and covered himself with sackcloth, and humbled himself before God, it was said to Elijah (Melakhim A 21:29): “Because he humbleth himself before Me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son’s days will I bring the evil upon his house.” This shows that <em>when a decree is made upon a wicked person, it is conditional upon his maintaining his state of wickedness. But if he changes that state through repentance, he, as it were, changes into another person upon whom that decree was not made.</em></p>\n<p>In this way it is clear that <em>prayer and right conduct help to prepare the person to receive the good influence or to nullify the evil that has been decreed concerning him, because he changes from the evil state in which he was</em>. Zophar alludes to this argument when he blames Job for not praying to God to deliver him from his misfortune, and for not preparing himself to nullify the decree (Iyov 11:13-15): “If thou set thy heart aright, and stretch out thy hands toward Him—If iniquity be in thy hand, put it far away … Surely then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot …” That is, if you set your heart to pray and to improve your conduct, there is no doubt that through prayer and right conduct you will escape from these troubles. From this it is clear that prayer and right conduct are always helpful in nullifying a divine decree. Our Rabbis also say (Rosh Hashanah 16a): “The cry [of prayer] is good for a man both before the divine decision and after.”</p>\n<p>As for the objection that the divine will can not be changed by prayer, the answer is that <strong>the divine will in the first place is that the decree should be realized if the person in question continues in the same state, and that the decree should be changed if the person’s state changes.</strong></p>\n<p>The other problem, namely that God’s knowledge would change as the man’s state changes through prayer, is related to the problem of the relation of God’s knowledge to the category of the contingent. Now just as we do not find it necessary that God’s knowledge should change because the contingent is a real category, so we do not find it necessary that it should change because of prayer, <em>but we believe that as God’s knowledge does not change because of the existence of the contingent, so it does not change because of the efficacy of prayer.</em> We believe that the contingent is real because experience testifies to it, and similarly we believe that prayer has the effect of nullifying a divine decree because experience testifies to it, as we shall see, and though we do not know how to reconcile God’s changeless knowledge with the efficacy of prayer, as we do not know how to reconcile it with the contingent, we do not on this account deny what experience proves, namely that God listens to prayer and grants the person’s request, whatever it be.</p>\n<p>This is the answer which Eliphaz gave to Job when he saw that Job was inclined to accept the view of the wicked, who say (Iyov 21:15): “What is the Almighty that we should serve him? And what profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?” In answer to this Eliphaz says (Iyov 22:13-14): “And thou sayest: ‘What doth God know? Can He judge through the dark cloud? Thick clouds are a covering to Him, that He seeth not …’ ” That is, since you incline to the opinion of the wicked, who say: “What profit should we have, if we pray unto Him?” thus denying the efficacy of prayer in order to save God’s changeless knowledge, you must also in the same way deny God’s knowledge of the contingent in order to save His changeless knowledge: “And thou sayest: ‘What doth God know?’ ” Your opinion seems to be that the world is ruled by unchanging law, which Eliphaz calls “The way of the world,” when he says to Job (Iyov 22:15-16): “Wilt thou keep the way of the world which wicked men have trodden? … who said unto God: ‘Depart from us;’ and what could the Almighty do unto them?” He calls those men wicked who say that the world is ruled by unchanging law, because they deny the efficacy of right conduct and prayer. Hence he concludes (Iyov 22:23): “If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up\" … (Iyov 22:27) \"thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee …” alluding, as it were, to the fact that his misfortunes came upon him because he believed that his prosperity had been due not to God, but to nature; and he entertained the same belief about the origin of his misfortune, and hence he did not pray to God concerning them. Eliphaz, therefore, says to him that if he returns to God and prays to Him and acknowledges that everything came to him from God, He will hear his prayer, will save him from his sufferings and will prosper his affairs. Hence he says (Iyov 22:27): “Thou shalt make thy prayer unto Him, and He will hear thee\", (Iyov 22:25) \"… and the Almighty be thy treasure, and precious silver unto thee,” i. e. through prayer your affairs will prosper. The Bible also testifies to the truth of this when it says (Iyov 42:10): “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends.” When he came to believe that prayer has efficacy, he prayed to God, and immediately God changed his fortune.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Hashem doesn't change but the manifestations and influxes change, including oneself.

We might also remind ourselves that we do not poskin from gemaras.</p>\n\n<p>The case concerning where <strong>a woman becomes pregnant outside of marriage</strong>, is addressed in the Shulchan Aruch, explicitly, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.6.17-18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even HaEzer 6:17-18</a></p>\n\n<p>There we see (a) whether a pregnant women is believed regarding the father, (b) what circumstances can establish the presumption that the father is kosher and (c) whether the women would then be allowed to marry a Cohen \"lechatchela\".   This derives in part from a well known gemara, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.13a.12?lang=bi&with=Halakhah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ketubot 13a-b</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The problem is that if we cannot assume the father of the child is kosher, she herself is regarded as possul.  Surprisingly, up to here, the gezara can apply to her but not the child.   But, those same circumstances might also make her possul from before they had relations.  In that case, the baby is regarded as a Challal.  So where there is a problem, there can be a problem for both the mother and the child.</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, it would be irresponsible to give a blanket answer, or any answer without looking into the specifics of the case or speaking with the people involved.</p>\n\n<p>It seems more appropriate to ask a Rav, who will consider the case in its particulars, and whose determination will be accepted in the larger Orthodox community.</p>\n\n\n",

Why He killed them through quail, specifically, is an excellent question that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/83046/9682\">may be addressed separately</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains on Beshalach 16:4 that He is not providing the food as a result of the dissatisfaction, but to teach them the lesson that He has already prepared the food in order to teach them the lessons that they must learn. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I led the people into the desert I had decided to provide them\n  with food in this way.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hashem is now teaching them that they must be ready to accept that Hashem will provide each day the necessities of that day. 16:5 shows that everyone will be granted the precise amount decreed for him no matter how hard he works and that the sixth day will be double so that they will not need to work on the Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in 16:6 that the quail is due to the complaints, but here too it is a lesson that Hashem hears and understands everything that is going on and pays attention to every word.</p>\n\n<p>The Bnai Yisrael were at this time like little children who do not understand that they can trust that they will be provided for. Thus they cried as soon as they started to feel hungry and did not yet understand how they were to be supported.</p>\n\n<p>The complainers starting in 11:1, the people did not pick up on the lesson that they should have learned. They started to complain and Hashem caused a fire to break out at the edge of the camp. They now cried in fear and Moshe prayed and the fire died down. However, far from learning their lesson, they actually pushed themselves to be worse. As Rav hirsch translates 11:4</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But the rabble that they had taken in among them goaded themselves on\n  to desires and then the Children of Israel also again began to weep\n  and they said: Who shall give us meat to eat?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That had been getting the man which was miraculous sustenance and provided everything they needed. Hashem said the He would provide the quail for a month until they were sick of it. This would show that they are going to far in their complaints. As it says in 11:20</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But even for a full month until it comes out your nose and nauseates\n  you. Because you have despised the Lord Who is among you, and you\n  cried before Him, saying, \"Why did we ever leave Egypt?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, even this was not enough for them. As Rav Hirsch said on 11:32</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Both greed and mistrust in the assurance that Moses had brought them\n  are shown in this rush to gather the quails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As a result, the lesson that would have taken a full month, fell upon them at once.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi had said on 11:20</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But even for a full month: This [concerned] the [comparatively]\n  virtuous ones, who languish on their beds and later their soul\n  departs. But concerning the wicked ones it says, “the meat was still\n  between their teeth [… when the anger of the Lord flared…]” (verse\n  33). This is how it is taught in the Sifrei (Beha’alothecha 1:42:20),\n  but in the Mechilta (Beshallach, Vayassa 3:13) the opposite is taught:\n  the wicked ate and suffered [as a result] for thirty days, whereas\n  [concerning] the virtuous-“the meat was still between their teeth”\n  [thus, they did not suffer prolonged agony].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why was it allowed for the Jews during the Babylonian exile to name the Hebrew calendar months after the Babylonian deities, when it clearly states in the Torah not to worship other G-ds besides Hashem.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/987524/jewish/Why-Babylonian-Names-for-Jewish-Months.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Why Babylonian Names for Jewish Months?</a> asks this question. The basic answer given is that while the names were originally derived (in part) from Babylonian deities, they have become disconnected from those discarded idols and serve as a reminder of the Babylonian exile. When we lived in the exile, people began referring to the calendar dates by the names that were used by the people among whom they lived. After the end of the first exile, this continued because the major community continued to be in Bavel and those who settled back in Israel were still using it.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, it is suggested that it is a method of overturning the idol worship and converting it to \"normal use\" (see below abot Tamuz).</p>\n\n<p>Consider the way we tend to use the current secular names in the world wide calendar nowadays even though they are based on the discarded myths of the Greco-Roman world.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Jerusalem Talmud5 tells us that the modern names of the months\n  “came up [to Israel] with [the returnees] from Babylon,” at the onset\n  of the second Jewish commonwealth, approximately 350 BCE.<sup>6</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>So, why did we begin to use these names? Why didn’t we stick with the\n  biblical practice of referring to months by their number?</p>\n  \n  <p>Nachmanides<sup>7</sup> suggests that this is consistent with Jeremiah’s\n  prophecy: “Therefore, behold days are coming, says G‑d, and it shall\n  no longer be said [by one who wishes to pronounce an oath], ‘As G‑d\n  lives, who brought up the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,’\n  but rather, ‘As G‑d lives, who brought up the children of Israel from\n  the north land [Babylon] . . .’”<sup>8</sup></p>\n  \n  <p>The original system was to count months in numeric order, starting\n  from Nissan. Thus, any time a person mentioned a month, he was in\n  effect recalling the exodus from Egypt: we are in, say, the sixth\n  month—six months since the month of the Exodus.<sup>9</sup> Thus, the numeric\n  naming served as a constant reminder of our deliverance from Egypt.</p>\n  \n  <p>After we were delivered from Babylonian captivity, however, we started\n  using the names that we became used to using in Babylon. And now,\n  these names served to remind us that G‑d has redeemed us from this\n  second exile.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>6</sup>. While many maintain that the names are actually taken from the\n  Babylonian tongue, the Rebbe maintains (Likkutei Sichot, vol. 23, pp.\n  214ff) that it is likely that many (if not all of) these names are\n  actually Hebrew, but that the practice of calling months by names\n  instead of their numeric position on the calendar originated in\n  Babylon. See also <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/703099/jewish/TammuzTime-for-Transformation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tammuz—Time for Transformation</a>.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>7</sup> Commentary to Exodus 12:2.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>8</sup> Jeremiah 16:14.</p>\n  \n  <p><sup>9</sup> For similar reason, Nachmanides argues, we have no names for the days of the week. Sunday is called “the First Day,” Monday is “the\n  Second Day,” and so on—because we are constantly counting down to the\n  Shabbat. Every time we mention the day of the week—any day of the\n  week—we are fulfilling the divine precept (Exodus 20:8) to always\n  “remember the Shabbat day to keep it holy.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/703099/jewish/TammuzTime-for-Transformation.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tammuz—Time for Transformation</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Why would our sages allow the adoption of the name of idolatry into\n  the holiness of Judaism?</p>\n  \n  <p>The short answer is that our role is not only to combat idolatry by\n  defacing it, because the psychological motivation that draws people to\n  idolatry is not cured that way. Instead, in the long run, we have to\n  transform the negative psychological proclivities that lead to\n  idolatry and transform them into positive ones.

    "content": "# Do the various sects of Judaism reflect differing national or cultural backgrounds?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a question about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/37470/what-is-the-religious-significance-of-the-existence-of-many-denominations-and-se?rq=1\">the religious significance</a> of the existence of various sects, but I was wondering whether the sects tend to reflect differing national or cultural backgrounds. Within Christianity, for instance, it is commonly observed that the Protestant Reformation spread largely among people who spoke Germanic languages, whereas the Catholic Church retained influence among speakers of Romance languages—so presumably something about the language or culture favored one sect or another. </p>\n\n<p>Are there any such tendencies among present-day Jewish sects? For example, would you expect Jews (or descendants of Jews) who had historically spent time in a particular country to belong to a particular sect today? (I am an American, so I am sort of familiar with Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism; I'm really not sure whether those differences are significant worldwide.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Jews who came from Muslim lands tend to keep kosher, even if they're not super-affiliated. (There wasn't much more to eat in their Muslim surroundings.) This is why Paris has more kosher restaurants than New York City: the average somewhat-affiliated Jew in New York City is of European ancestry, and doesn't demand a kosher restaurant. The average somewhat-affiliated Jew in Paris is of North African ancestry, and expects a restaurant that's kosher.</p>\n\n<p>More broadly, in parts of the world that didn't experience the Enlightment/Reformation the way that Europe did, the predominant brand of Judaism is Orthodox. Many don't affiliate, and don't attend, but if they did attend synagogue, it would be an Orthodox one! (Not unlike, say, the Catholic Church in much of Latin America. There are yes-Catholic-church-goers and non-churchgoers-to-Catholic-churches, but not a ton of Unitarians.) Sephardic Jews come from non-Enlightenment countries, and thus it is very rare to find a Sephardic synagogue whose official rite is anything other than Orthodox -- e.g. there will be separate seating for women.</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, yes the look, feel, sound, and practice varied depending on where you were. Lo and behold, the Hebrew used by Hungarian Jews sounds more like Hungarian, while the Hebrew used by Yemeni Jews sounds more like Arabic. (Given that it's a Semitic language, the Yemenites are probably right.) Jews in Christian lands banned polygamy long ago; Jews in Muslim lands, much, much later if at all. There are plenty more variations, ranging from legal perspective to culture. But this is more about Ashkenazic vs. Sephardic than Orthodox vs. Reform. </p>\n\n<p>Even within Orthodox Jews from Eastern Europe, you tend to see a split between Hasidic Jews' attitudes to the mystical spiritual qualities of their \"grand rabbis\", vs. non-Hasidic Jews' stress on their rabbis' expertise --  not unlike Catholic (where my priest performs ritual for me) vs. Protestant (where my minister is someone whose expertise and judgment I appreciate). Hasidic Jews focused more on \"joy\", non-Hasidic on study. Interestingly, in Hasidic lands (e.g. Romania), the recipe for traditional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gefilte_fish\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gefilte fish</a> called for sugar, they liked it sweet. In non-Hasidic lands, <em>bah, this isn't dessert!</em> -- it's made with salt and pepper instead.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does the torah say about racism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What does the Torah say about racism?</p>\n\n<p>People today do not agree anymore what racism is.But I think we can use the word Racism .I  can't remember anywhere in the Torah where they talk about skincolor.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe there is something in the Talmud about racism?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Torah forbids racism. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov Kamenetzky in his book on Chumash - Emes L'Yaakov (Parshas Noach 9:25) states emphatically that the Torah is not racist. Basing himself off the Gemara in Sanhedrin (37a) which states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפיכך נברא אדם יחידי ללמדך ... מפני שלום הבריות שלא יאמר אדם לחבירו\n  אבא גדול מאביך </p>\n  \n  <hr>\n  \n  <p>Thus, Man was created alone initially in order to teach respect for\n  humanity, for man cannot say \"my father is greater than your father\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Torah does not accept the belief that one race is greater due to their lineage and DNA is more superior to another group. However, the Torah does recognize the differences between races, in that those differences have been encouraged and cultivated throughout the generations to the extent that those traits are programmed into the makeup of the person. The Torah differentiates groups based on the character and morals of the people, and that if those traits are negative, then the people are to be viewe negativly. However, these attributes are not \"inherent\" in the person, and through character development ie. working on oneself to be more G-dly and holy, the person can break out from the bad traits they were raised. </p>\n\n<p>That is not called racism, because race in the eyes of G-d and His Torah is inconsequential, we don't hate them because of their lineage or make-up, rather it is the innate traits and mores of that particular group. We Jews believe that one can rise above their externally influenced traits. Whether through the acceptance of the Sheva Mitzvos Bnei Noach - The Seven Noahide Laws, or through full-fledged conversion to Judaism. The Torah believes in problems with certain cultures, which cause problems for people raised in those cultures, but have nothing to do with racial heredity.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Yaakov makes it very clear in his piece: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ודאי זה אין משום שדת ישראל גזענית היא חס ושלום, אלא שאנו אומרים\n  שמכיון שאנו ירשנו מדות מהוגנות וישרות מאבירי דעה כאלו כמו אברהם ויצחק\n  ויעקב...ממילא אנו בני מעלה     יותר משאר העמים, כי הרי אנו שיפרנו את\n  עצמינו במדות טובות ובהתקרבות להשי\"ת </p>\n  \n  <hr>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein also echoed such a sentiment regarding the Falasha tribe who claimed Jewish lineage:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As you mentioned, they should not be brought to the Land of Israel*\n  unless they have underdone a conversion**, in order to not increase\n  the concern for assimilation [i.e., intermarriage with Jews who do not\n  have a doubt regarding their Jewish status and also a weakening of the\n  faith of Ethiopian Jews themselves]. But if they have legally\n  converted, and as I have heard they are doing, we shall consider them\n  like all Jews, and one must assist them and support them for all needs\n  of livelihood, both physically and spiritually. <strong>And I suffered great\n  anguish because I have heard there are those in Israel who are not\n  drawing them close in spiritual matters and are causing, G-d forbid,\n  that they might be lost from Judaism. And it seems to me these people\n  are behaving so only because the color of the Falashas' skin is black.\n  It is obvious that one must draw them close, not only because they are\n  no worse than the rest of the Jews – and because there is no\n  distinction in practical application of the law because they are black\n  – but also because one can say perhaps they are gerim [converts], and\n  are therefore included in the mitzva \"and you shall love the convert.\"</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YpgNg.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/YpgNg.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>Possibly clearer version <a href=\"http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/files/rav_moshe_feinstein_ethiopia_jewry_letter_1984.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

Why don't modern Jews live as strictly to the scriptures and the ancient Israelites did?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>I don't want my answer to come off as insulting, or personal, but my answer has to address the reasons behind your question, as many Christians ask us many versions of this same question, all of these questions stemming from the same thought process.. It's been my observation that Christians tend to feel like they understand the Bible better than the Jews do, or at least know more about it than the Jews, and feel they are in a position to point out when Jews aren't doing something that \"we are supposed to be doing.\"</p>\n<p>In your comments you said one of the things we \"should\" be doing is animal sacrifices. To you it seems clear that we as Jews are obviously in violation of the laws of animal sacrifices. The reality is that you are in ignorance, because the Bible clearly states that it was God Himself through His teacher Moses who specifically forbade us from doing animal sacrifices.\nDeuteronomy 12:5-14</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 But you are to seek the place the Lord your God will choose from among all your tribes to put his Name there for his dwelling. <strong>To that place you must go</strong>; 6 there bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, what you have vowed to give and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and flocks. 7 There, in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your families shall eat and shall rejoice in everything you have put your hand to, because the Lord your God has blessed you.</p>\n<p>8 <strong>You are not to do as we do here today, everyone doing as they see fit,</strong> 9 since you have not yet reached the resting place and the inheritance the Lord your God is giving you. 10 But you will cross the Jordan and settle in the land the Lord your God is giving you as an inheritance, and he will give you rest from all your enemies around you so that you will live in safety. 11 Then to the place the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling for his Name—there you are to bring everything I command you: your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes and special gifts, and all the choice possessions you have vowed to the Lord. 12 And there rejoice before the Lord your God—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites from your towns who have no allotment or inheritance of their own. 13 Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings anywhere you please. 14 <strong>Offer them only at the place the Lord will choose in one of your tribes, and there observe everything I command you.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your presumption that we don't do things has little to do with Jews not following the law of Moses. It has to do with your ignorance of the law of Moses, and your presumption that you truly know what the law of Moses says (because otherwise you wouldn't feel you were in a position to ask the question the way that you did).</p>\n<p>Another of your other claims is that Jews don't follow clothing laws. Most observant Jews do live by the clothing laws mentioned in the Bible, therefore many refrain from mixed fabrics. But i can assure you that many other things that you think Jews are shirking are really just either your personal ignorance, or ignorance caused by translations.</p>\n<p>One example is that many Christians ask why Jews don't wear blue threads in their tassels anymore. The reality is the normative Hebrew word for blue isn't used in the Bible regarding tassels, but rather a SPECIFIC word for a SPECIFIC type of blue. When the tradition of how to make that specific shade of blue got lost, Jews stopped wearing blue. Imagine if your English Bible said \"and the children of Israel shall put a string of Prussian Blue on their tassels.\" More than likely, you would assume that this string needs to be that exact color of blue. But because your English Bible just translates the word as blue, it appears to you that any blue will do. Thankfully, now that some claim to have rediscovered the specific shade blue, it is starting to appear again and be worn by Jews.</p>\n<p>By no means am I insinuating that you aren't intelligent. But the Bible is a vast book, and the history of its people is larger still. There are many chapters dedicated to animal sacrifices, but only one or two verses that show you can't sacrifice without a temple. So it's a mistake to do a cursory read of the Bible and assume that one has grasped it. Rather, one has to study these specific laws in very large detail before one can make assumptions about how these laws are being practiced or interpreted.</p>\n<p>You probably still have many other \"but what about X\" questions in your mind regarding the practice of Jews, or possibly some assumption that we care about following Rabbis more than God. You should not approach the questions from that viewpoint, but should rather think, \"I wonder why Jews don't do x the way I assume it should be done.\" Because that thought puts everyone on the same plane and allows for open dialogue. The majority of the time Jewish practice has to do with a nuance in the text that Rabbis picked up on, or even a direct verse from the Bible you hadn't read. I'm not saying we are perfect, nor am I saying that we always follow God above following Rabbis. But the majority of the time, you will find that we are following the laws of Moses, and we are doing so because we love God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>For a partial answer.

It is important to distinguish the two, since the work moves between addressing the constructs of cause/effect, existence/nonexistence, and prime mover/creation rather freely.</p>\n\n<p>Fundamentally, three (or possibly four) options exist:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>An eternal existence to the universe. (Aristotle)</li>\n<li>Creation of a universe ex nihilo without a creator. </li>\n<li>Creation of a universe with a(n unintelligible) creator.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Creation of a universe with an <strong><em>intelligent/aware</em></strong> creator.

Frequently, this is due an assumed familiarity of the basics of the school to which the philosopher belong(s/ed). Prominent among older philosophical works is the understanding that <strong>a creation is a subset of the creator</strong>, or that the capacity of the creation is limited by the creator.</p>\n\n<p>The discussion of kadmon in Shaar HaYichud starts with a refutation of Aristotelian philsophy by invoking the principle that self-creation is impossible (something created by nothing), and therefore an infinite regress (which essentially invokes self creation) is similarly impossible. Additionally, the temporal cannot give rise to the eternal. By those two axioms, there must exist some eternal thing prior to the creation of temporal things which gave rise to creation, which knocks out possibility two.</p>\n\n<p>This axiom would also imply that non-intelligence cannot give rise to intelligence, and randomness/chaos cannot give rise to long term order (option 3). Thus the large scale order we perceive can only be produce by a prior intelligence and there must be a Prime Mover that is both eternal and intelligent. </p>\n\n<p>While one <em>could</em> challenge some of the assumptions used in the argument (just as ignoring the parallel postulate led to new mathematics), the axiom used by R' Bachye as giving rise to a philosophical Prime Mover <em>also</em> necessitates its intelligence.</p>\n\n<h2>Disclaimer:</h2>\n\n<p>This answer to the question is based upon a translation of the Shaar Hayichud as provided <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/398\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.

If you do have critiques, please address them in the comments and I will endeavor to update the answer to address them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam in his Guide to the Perplexed, section I is ambiguous about whether or not G-d is actually has Knowledge. (Not sure how to translate \"intelligence\" into his terms, but the ability to gather knowledge, and to reach conclusions -- new knowledge from old -- must be part of it.)</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_1.58?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch. 58</a>, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Know that the negative attributes of God are the true attributes: they do not include any incorrect notions or any deficiency whatever in reference to God, while positive attributes imply polytheism, and are inadequate, as we have already shown.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a theme throughout much of section I, where the Rambam goes on to explain the terms in Tanakh that appear to ascribe attributes to Hashem. The Rambam believes all we can know about G-d is what He isn't -- \"Eternal\" means He is unaffacted by Time, \"Omnipotent\" means that He does not require power and therefore can caused anything, without limit. Etc..</p>\n\n<p>And so, one can't speak of G-d's Knowledge or Intelligence, except in the sense of describing how His Actions (or whatever we wish to call the consequences of His Will) appear to us. Also from ch. 58:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It has thus been shown that every attribute predicated of God either denotes the quality of an action, or--when the attribute is intended to convey some idea of the Divine Being itself, and not of His actions--the negation of the opposite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, the Rambam also writes in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_1.68?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">ch. 68</a> about the unity of the Knower, the Knowledge and the Known:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You are acquainted with the well-known principle of the philosophers that God is the intellectus, the ens intelligens, and the ens intelligibile. These three things are in God one and the same, and do not in any way constitute a plurality. We have also mentioned it in our larger work, \"Mishneh Torah,\" and we have explained there...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, looking there, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Foundations_of_the_Torah.2.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laws of Foundations of the Torah (Yesodei haTorah) 2:10</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Holy One, blessed be He, recognizes His truth and knows it as it is. He does not know with a knowledge which is external to Him in the way that we know, for ourselves and our knowledge are not one. Rather, the Creator, may He be blessed, He, His knowledge, and His life are one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Were He to live as life is [usually conceived], or know with a knowledge that is external from Him, there would be many gods, Him, His life, and His knowledge. The matter is not so. Rather, He is one from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Thus, you could say, \"He is the Knower, He is the Subject of Knowledge, and He is the Knowledge itself.\" All is one. This matter is beyond the ability of our mouths to relate, [or our] ears to hear, nor is there [the capacity] within the heart of man to grasp it in its entirety.....</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In this chapter he appears to be promoting a Neoplatonic panentheism -- a notion that the universe is of G-d, but that the Creator is not limited to the universe. Thus, Hashem's Knowledge is the same as that which He Knows -- both of which are the same as Him.</p>\n\n<p>So, looking at the Rambam, we are left with a mystery as to what we mean when refer to G-d as Intelligent. Chapter 58 would imply that:</p>\n\n<p>1- We are saying that G-d doesn't need Intelligence, and therefore is unlimited by ignorance (a negative attribute).\nAnd/or\n2- G-d's Actions appear to use to reflect Intelligence. </p>\n\n<p>Ch. 69 would imply that\n3- G-d's Intelligence is what we call us \"existing\". As one friend once put it, \"we are all pixels in Hashem's Imagination.\"</p>\n\n<p>And each has a different answer to your question:</p>\n\n<p>1- The Creator is not Intelligent in any literal sense, all we are saying is that the universe and all that G-d does within it are not limited by a finite intellect.</p>\n\n<p>2- G-d Acts like He has Intelligence because He wants to serve as a meaningful Role Model for humans and our intelligences. Intelligence is a description of How He Acts so that we can have a relationship with Him. </p>\n\n<p>3- Creation and Intelligence are the same thing. G-d \"Thought\" us into being. And so, a \"non-intelligent Creator\" would be a self-contraditory phrase.</p>\n\n<p>Of the three, I can only really get some handle on the first two.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The question only makes sense from a materialist or dualist perspective.

Today we no longer know what those birds are. This is the reason that both Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch and Artscroll chose to transliterate rather than attempt to translate the names of the birds in their Torah translations. Because of this, for close to one thousand years, the overriding principle is “Tradition!” The only birds that are treated as kosher are those for which a reliable tradition exists that in the previous generation it was treated as kosher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What's with the plain-\"K\" hechsher?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I had taken for granted that packaged foods marked with just \"K\" are not necessarily kosher--that is, that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/64663/why-doesnt-kelloggs-print-the-symbol-of-their-certifying-agency-on-their-boxes\">\"K\" is not a real hechsher</a>--because the company prints that symbol itself, and it does not necessarily indicate rabbinical supervision or sanction. (Certain items marked \"K\" are on kosher lists; these, like other items on relaible lists, are <a href=\"http://www.ok.org/consumers/kosher-food-guide/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OK</a>.) Or so I thought.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have been seeing <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/64629/kashrut-of-kellogs-cereal\">some discussion</a> to the effect that there may in fact be some meaning to some uses of the \"K\" hechsher. Moreover, I have found products with just \"K\" in a grocery store in a frum area in which they do not even sell non-cholov-yisroel milk. (When I asked whether the product was kosher, the frum man working at the store pointed at the \"K.\") So what's the deal? Is [some] food under the \"K\" hechsher actually kosher? What is the provenance of the hechsher, and how do I know what I can eat from it? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Kosher organizations use trademark law to prevent unauthorized companies from putting their symbol on the box. So if you see an OU on a box of food, you can be relatively certain that the product is indeed certified by the OU because they could sue any company that uses their trademark without permission<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The letter K is just a letter; it cannot be trademarked. So seeing the letter K on a box of food does not itself imply that the food is certified. A company such as Kellogg's may choose not to print the symbol of their certifying agency on the box. I don't know exactly what the reason for not doing so would be (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/64663/1713\">Why doesn't Kellogg's print the symbol of their certifying agency on their boxes</a>), but Kellogg's does this and the <em>kashrut</em> agency is happy to certify the product regardless of whether their symbol is included on the box as long as they're being paid (and the food is kosher, of course).</p>\n\n<p>The only way to determine that food with a plain-K is actually <em>kosher</em> is if the certifying agency can somehow be determined to be a reliable agency. Normally this is done simply by looking up the symbol but in this case, other means are necessary. In the case of Kellogg's they are certified by the Rabbinical Council of New England. If you hold by that supervisory organization, you can eat Kellogg's.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> Technically a certification mark rather than a trademark. I am not a lawyer. Legal details may be more simplified than reality but the gist is correct.</p>\n\n\n",

So this all applies to the immersion and the circumcision but it does not apply to receiving the mitzvot, which prevents [conversion] unless it was during the day and in front of three [witnesses]. However, the Rif and the Rambam [say that] even after the fact [one who] immersed or was circumcised before two [witnesses] or at night prevents [conversion], and [marrying] an Israelite woman is forbidden.

How can it be said, 'at the present time'? -Say 'as at the present time'! -Surely concerning this it was stated that R<code>Isaac B</code>Samuel B`Martha said in the name of Rab: The halachah is in accordance with the opinion of him who maintained that they were all proper proselytes. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See the whole text in Gemara.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rambam, Issurei Biah - Chapter Thirteen, 16-17:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>16</p>\n  \n  <p>וּלְפִי שֶׁגִּיֵּר שְׁלֹמֹה נָשִׁים וּנְשָׂאָן. וְכֵן שִׁמְשׁוֹן גִּיֵּר וְנָשָׂא. וְהַדָּבָר יָדוּעַ שֶׁלֹּא חָזְרוּ אֵלּוּ אֶלָּא בִּשְׁבִיל דָּבָר וְלֹא עַל פִּי בֵּית דִּין גִּיְּרוּם חֲשָׁבָן הַכָּתוּב כְּאִלּוּ הֵן עַכּוּ''ם וּבְאִסּוּרָן עוֹמְדִין. וְעוֹד שֶׁהוֹכִיחַ סוֹפָן עַל תְּחִלָּתָן שֶׁהֵן עוֹבְדוֹת כּוֹכָבִים וּמַזָּלוֹת שֶׁלָּהֶן וּבָנוּ לָהֶן בָּמוֹת וְהֶעֱלָה עָלָיו הַכָּתוּב כְּאִלּוּ הוּא בְּנָאָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (מלכים א יא ז) \"אָז יִבְנֶה שְׁלֹמֹה בָּמָה\": ‏</p>\n  \n  <p>Solomon converted women and married them and similarly, Samson converted [women] and married [them].

Man is like the master of the house who uses all that is in it.\n  The various types of plants are prepared for his benefit; the various\n  kinds of animals serve his use, as David said: \"You have made man to\n  have dominion over the works of Your hands; You have put all things\n  under his feet; All sheep and oxen, and the beasts of the field; The\n  birds of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passes\n  through the paths of the seas\" (Ps. 8:7)...and the purpose of\n  everything is for the benefit of mankind, as Solomon said: \"To every\n  thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven\"\n  (Eccles. 3:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and in the shaar bechina</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You should know that what I have called your attention to in this\n  treatise, is but a small portion of the vast knowledge concerning the\n  mysteries of wisdom you can acquire by your own\n  understanding-mysteries which will be revealed to you if you purify\n  your heart and refine your soul. When you have attained in these\n  matters the utmost knowledge of which you are capable, you should\n  realize that all this knowledge which you have acquired of the\n  Creator's wisdom and power, as manifested in this universe, is as\n  nothing compared to His real power and wisdom. For what is manifested\n  is only that which is needed for a human being, not according to the\n  true extent of His power, for it is infinite.

Initially they thought the laws of physics and their constants could take a wide range of values and some sort of life would be possible in the universe.

Drawing on a staggering knowledge of physics, biochemistry, geology,\n  and evolution, Denton builds a step-by-step argument for human\n  inevitability. Life requires water, DNA, and protein; it can only\n  flourish in an Earth-like environment. Building on these claims\n  -which, until recently, were impossible to defend - Denton dares to address the boldest question of all - Is a homo sapien-like creature\n  the only possible highly intelligent being in the universe?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I put a little piece together summarizing some of this <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=427&d=19\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> which you may find interesting.</p>\n\n<p>to summarize the world is the way it is because this is the best way for its purpose of being an arena of human free will and teaching man what he is capable of grasping about God.</p>\n\n<p>There are also higher meanings to why things are the way they are.</p>\n\n<p>Just like the torah has multiple layers of meanings so does the world</p>\n\n<p>for example in the Zohar <a href=\"http://www.kab.co.il/heb/content/view/frame/101968?/heb/content/view/full/101968&main\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלמה המלך, כשירד לעומק האגוז, כמ\"ש, אל גינת אגוז ירדתי, לקח קליפת אגוז\n  והסתכל בכל אלו הקליפות שבו, וידע, שכל עיקר התענוגים של אלו הרוחות\n  שבקליפות האגוז, הוא להתדבק בבני אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>before Shlomo went to take on the forces of evil (Klipot) he looked at a walnut and contemplated its structure of shells which is a sort of map for that underworld.</p>\n\n\n",

Or do I have to get as close to 7π√2 as humanly possible?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There seems to be three mainstream opinions in the Rishonim and Acharonim.</p>\n<h1>Only if you're not planning on cheating someone</h1>\n<p>The Sefer HaChinuch (Mitzvah 258) says explicitly that one may not rely on such estimations by Choshen Mishpat. In his words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותזכר...שלא אמרו זכרונם לברכה על הכיוון כי אם בקירוב, ולכן אל תסמוך בזה בחלוקת הדברים בין בני אדם. ואל תתמה איך יכתבו דבר בלתי מכוון...ובזה מה שלא כיוונו בו מביא אותו לידי חומרא ואינו מזיק לכל אדם בממנו.</p>\n<p>And remember...that [the Chachamim], may their memory be for blessing, did not say [these previously stated mathematical principles] precisely, but were only estimating, and therefore, do not rely on this for separating things between people. And do not wonder, \"How could they write something imprecise?\" ... And on this that which they were imprecise would lead someone to act stringently and would not harm a person with his money.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (CM 231:16) and Rambam (Geneivah 8:1) say the same thing, that people are very careful with their money, and they don't want to part with it that quickly. They are quoting a Gemara in BM 91a; if anyone wants to argue with this opinion, they have to be more stringent. And indeed, they are.</p>\n<h1>Only if you're dealing with π</h1>\n<p>The Maggid Mishnah in Hilchos Shabbos (17:26) says that one may rely on π=3, but he says in Hilchos Eiruvin (3:2) that one may not rely on √2=1.4. What's the difference? Perhaps it's because the former has a passuk (Melachim Aleph 7:23; see Eiruvin 14a) while the latter doesn't.</p>\n<p>The Sha'alos U'Teshuvos Tashbeitz (1:165) gives two explanations of these estimations: either they're Halachos L'Moshe MiSinai, or they're there to help explain the sugya better and one may not rely on them. The first side clearly holds like the Sefer HaChinuch, Shulchan Aruch, and Rambam, but perhaps the second side agrees with the Maggid Mishnah that one may not rely on √2=1.4 but can rely on π=3. Or maybe that side agrees with the even more stringent opinion below.</p>\n<h1>Absolutely never</h1>\n<p>In the aforementioned sugya in Eiruvin 14a, the Gemara opens up with the cryptic line: \"How do we know [that the circumference of a 1-tefach circle is 3 tefachim]?\"</p>\n<p>Um, how do we know? Take a tape measure! (Or at least take a string, wrap it around a circle, and compare it to a ruler, or three fists lined up next to each other.)</p>\n<p>The Tosfos HaRosh explains: Since π≠3, how do we know we can rely on this halacha l'ma'aseh? The Aruch HaShulchan (OC 363:22, YD 30:13) explains: Since π=3, the diameter is less than 1. How do we know we can make the mavoi permissible to carry in anyway?</p>\n<p>These seemingly similar explanations could be arguing about this very point. The Aruch HaShulchan, who emphasizes the permissibility of the mavoi, would seem to hold that one may not rely on these estimations whatsoever. The Tosfos HaRosh, who asks how we know we can rely on π=3 but is silent about √2=1.4, could hold like either of the above opinions.</p>\n<p>R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe, YD 3:120:5) asks whether one is obligated to use a microscope and other scientific tools to make his tefillin as square as possible.

This is how Rashi understands the verse. </p>\n\n<p>In a homiletical vein, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik comments as follows (\"<a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/originals/Volume%2017/No.%202/Majesty%20and%20Humility.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Majesty and Humility</a>,\" pp. 31-32): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The dust of which man was fashioned was not taken from all parts of\n  the universe, according to the Midrash, but from a single spot on a\n  mountain where an altar was many, many years later constructed... each\n  man is created from and attached to a single spot, the origin, from\n  which he cannot escape. The home for which man yearns attracts him\n  like a powerful magnet; -it brings him back, no matter how far he has\n  traveled. \"Home is the sailor, home from the sea, and the hunter home\n  from the hill\": these beautiful lines by Robert Louis Stevenson\n  contain more than a nostalgic note.</p>\n  \n  <p>Occasionally, when I am at the airport, I happen to observe the\n  loading of a double coffin, containing the body of a Jew who has\n  lived, worked, raised children, prospered or failed, in the United\n  States. It is being shipped for burial in the land of Abraham, Isaac\n  and Jacob. The mystery of the origin apparently casts a spell even\n  upon people who have few religious commitments. The modern secular Jew\n  wants to rest in eternal peace, in proximity to the site where the\n  patriarchs found their rest.</p>\n  \n  <p>כי האדם עץ השדה - The man is indeed like the tree in the field. In\n  this context, the verse should be interpreted as an affirmative\n  statement, not a rhetorical question. Man is indeed a rooted being,\n  attached and committed to a homestead - no matter how far he may have\n  traveled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>R.

[the underlying idea, if I understand the author and the text correctly, is that the purpose of laying siege to a city instead of assaulting it and destroying it, is to preserve it intact after its inhabitants have been forced to surrender.

XXIV, 6) where the\n  millstone is called נפש (th life I.L.) because it is indispensable for\n  the existence of the נפש. So the sense of our sentence would be ...\n  for fruit tree form the existence of human beings and are included in\n  the siege ...

He is discussing there the subject of the requirements of blessings and specifically over what things we study is it required to make the blessings for Torah study.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>צריך לברך בין למקרא, בין למשנה, בין לגמרא, בין למדרש, והיינו מדרש המקראות במכילתא וספרא וספרי (רש\"י ברכות יא ב). ודע שיש להסתפק בלומד דברי אגדה, כמדרש רבה או חכמת הקבלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"It is necessary to bless whether for the written Torah, or for the Mishnah, or for the Gamarrah, or for the Midrash, meaning the Midrash on the written Torah in the Mechilta, and Sifra and Sifri (Rashi on Brachot 11a). And know that there is a doubt in regard to study of the words of Agaddah, like Midrash Rabbah and the wisdom of the kabbalah...\"</p>\n\n<p>What the Aruch HaShulchan calls 'Midrash' he limits only to the three halachic midrashim found to the last three of the five books of Moshe like Rashi explains in tractate Brachot 11a. All other midrashim he calls '<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggadah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aggadot</a>' which is from the same root as 'Haggadah' and 'Naggid' which mean 'to tell'. It means the oral tradition that originally was not permitted to be written down, but only shared face to face from teacher to student like is found in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.60b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gittin 60b</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Temurah.14a?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">Temurah 14a</a>.That portion of the oral Torah comprising Mishnah and Gamarrah also fell under this same restriction originally.</p>\n\n<p>It was only as external troubles (like poverty and servitude to foreign conquerers) increased for B'nai Yisrael, and the level and quality of learning decreased, that compromises started to made in some areas. This was done so that the oral teachings, particularly those relating to proper practice of the commandments materially and physically, would not be lost like is recorded in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48140&st=&pgnum=20&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igeret of Sherirah Gaon 1:1.</a> Some parts of the oral teachings began to be written down. This is based upon the principle from <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishah Avot 1:17</a> taught by Rabbi Shimon be Gamliel that \"<a href=\"http://www.dvar-tora.co.il/mamr.aspx?id=1382\" rel=\"nofollow\">the deed is the primary thing</a>\".</p>\n\n<p>The more esoteric parts of the Torah remained oral and in some cases had a restricted circulation to only select, gifted and talented individuals. Over time and as the suffering increased, this writing down of the oral parts grew and expanded to include other areas of the oral teachings. Again, the more esoteric portions, even after being written down, were often restricted to small circles of select individual. And this continues even to this day.</p>\n\n<p>But many of the esoteric materials, particularly following the time of the Ari z\"l, Rabbi Yitzchok Luria, have been allowed to be circulated in increasingly broader circles until today, many books from ancient tradition and teaching are readily available.</p>\n\n<p>What the Aruch HaShulchan is referring to as the 'wisdom of the kabbalah' is talking about these highly esoteric, but authentic teachings, which have been passed down from generation to generation since Moshe Rabbeinu and even before.</p>\n\n<p>They comprise the same teachings in 'kabbalah' that we have always had. Examples can be found in Sefer Yetzirah, <a href=\"http://seforimcenter.com/showScannedImages.aspx?pfile=10984.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer Pirkei Heichalot attributed to Rabbi Yishmael Kohen Gadol, Sefer HaTagin attributed to Yehoshuah be Nun</a>, <a href=\"http://seforimcenter.com/showScannedImages.aspx?pfile=9744.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer Ma'ayan HaChochmah</a> attributed to Moshe Rabbeinu, Masechet Atzilut from the time of David HaMelech, <a href=\"http://seforimcenter.com/showScannedImages.aspx?pfile=6780.gif\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefer HaBahir, Sefer HaTemunah and Sefer HaKaneh</a> attributed to Rabbi Nehuniah ben HaKaneh, and even Sefer Raziel HaMalach attributed to Adam HaRishon, Sefer Chanoch attributed to Chanoch ben Yered from Sefer Bereshit, and Sefer Noach attributed to Noach ben Lemech of the story of the flood and Ark. There are many other examples.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted with all this that even today, there are some manuscripts which still are not published and have extremely limited circulation amongst the Jewish people.</p>\n\n<p>For someone who actually looks at these sources, it can be seen that kabbalah, what the Aruch HaShulchan refers to as \"the wisdom of the kabbalah\", is the same kabbalah that has been passed down through all the generations going back all the way to Moshe Rabbeinu and even before.</p>\n\n\n",

One of the points he asserts is that which is asserted in the Torah above; that there is no instance of a revelation of God to a nation that the nation survives. Kelemen claims to have examined all other known religions and found none that have made the same claims, though he says that a sect of Hare Krishna believes in such a revelation, but all of the witnesses to the revelation died shortly afterward, which make the claim fall short of the Sinai Claim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/16973\">This answer</a> to a related question on Skeptics Stack Exchange provides some examples of Native American traditions that seem to make the same claim as the Sinai Claim.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=sOjxMSXbY8QC&pg=PT29&lpg=PT29&dq=white%20eagle%20aztecs%20Huitzilopochtli&source=bl&ots=q2H_xob3Gn&sig=3ueq5daI9XRnokb-TgaZDYnw-v0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=6AfmUeeZBuTbigLb24DACA#v=onepage&q=white%20eagle%20aztecs%20Huitzilopochtli&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Aztec Huitzilopochtli Myth and revelation of Huitzilopochtli</a> tells that the Aztecs, who settled in Lake Texcoco, believed themselves to be descended from tribes of immortal people from Aztlan until they had to leave as instructed by their god Huitzilopochtli who took the form of a white eagle.

All of the Pomo villages were planted by Marumda and he revealed himself to their ancestors, sometimes accompanied with miracles, and taught them how to survive and behave and taught them dances that are still performed today. (It is not completely clear, however, how massive the initial size of the population that Marumda created and was revealed to was, and it's not clear if Marumda spoke to the entire nation at once.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.classicreader.com/book/147/2/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Revelation of Gitche Manitou at Pipestone, Minnesota</a> tells that the Sioux Indians had a divine revelation of their god and creator Gitche Manitou at the Pipestone National Monument to all the Native American tribes. He breathed into a peace pipe he formed and made a large smoke signal that beckoned all the tribes to gather. They had spite between them, but Gitche Manitou chided them to do away with their weapons, behave properly, and make peace. After this, before all the nations, Gitche Manitou ascended to heaven amidst the smoke. (The source in the answer is a poem based upon legends, however, so it is more difficult to ascertain for certain that the Sioux people actually believe this as history.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.kstrom.net/isk/arvol/lamedeer.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Lakota legend of White Buffalo Calf Woman</a> tells that the Lakota People witnessed their god Wakan Tanka (same as Gitchie Manitou) reveal itself to all seven tribes of the Lakota as White Buffalo Calf Woman.  Two hunters went to look for food. They saw a beautiful woman floating towards them. One of the hunters desired the woman and was turned into a pile of bones amidst a cloud. The other hunter became afraid and prepared to shoot the woman, but she couldn't be harmed. She informed the hunter to return and have the Lakota prepare for her arrival. When she arrived, she taught the Lakota how to behave and perform all the sacred rituals and gave them a sacred living pipe that is still guarded to this day. As she left, the people saw her turn into a black buffalo, then brown, then red, and then white, which is sacred. As she disappeared, large herds of buffalo appeared where she was and allowed themselves to be killed for the Lakota to live. (The size of the Lakota nation at the time of the revelation and miracle is not so clear.)</p>\n\n<p>(The answer provides two other instances that do not come close to the criterea in Deuteronomy of a God speaking to an entire nation who survived the event, so I did not address them.)</p>\n\n<p>Does Rabbi Kelemen (or anybody else) address these directly?

They say there was a mass revelation, the entire Aztec nation heard the divine voice. However, there are no living Aztecs alive today. They were all killed by the Spanish and smallpox. No masses today in Mexico claim the purported events as their history. Thus, no proof. As for the others, such as many Native American tribes, ancient Greeks, and African peoples, what they saw were natural events. They mistook something natural for a divine sign. For example, one billion Hindus saw their gods drinking milk, but this can be easily explained naturally. Similarly, Constantine did not see a cross. This was an eclipse. As for Jesus feeding a few loaves of bread, books do not verify anything. Just because a book claims mass witnesses is not proof. To prove the book from a book is a circular argument! all other religions make this mistake, but not Judaism. While all other religions have unanimous bind faith in those purported events, Judaism has a unanimous verbal transmission. Plus there is no alternative Jewish history. In other words, all other religions only have masses who “accept” what a book says, not masses who transmit a story by generations, back to the original attendees at Sinai. For example, the Gospels have four different versions, with no one source. This is what sets Judaism apart from other religions who make the same claim about mass witnesses.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for ability to speak before Neshama\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've always understand conventional Jewish belief is that there are different aspects to the soul, and each one provides different abilities. The נפש is common to all living creatures and it is the source of life. The נשמה is unique to humans, and it's what provides שכל/intelligence as well as the ability to speak (some refer to this as the רוח specifically). What that means then is before Man received the נשמה, there was no ability to speak. Sources which show this are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The beginning of Bereishis describes the creation of Adam</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בראשית ב:ז</p>\n  \n  <p>וייצר יקוק אלקים את האדם מן האדמה ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים, ויהי האדם לנפש חיה</p>\n  \n  <p>And G-d formed man from the earth, and blew into his nostrils a נשמה of life, and man became a living being</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Targum Onkelos translates the last half of the verse as</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ונפח באנפוהי נשמתא דחיי והות באדם <strong>לרוח ממללא</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>And He blew into his nostrils a נשמה of life, and there was in man <strong>a talking spirit</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meaning, Man after receiving the נשמה became able to speak.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban on this verse comments similarly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>י...'וייצר יקוק אלקים את האדם' יצירת תנועה...ואחרי שיצרו בהרגשה, 'נפח\n  באפיו נשמת חיים' מפי עליון, להוסיף הנפש הזאת על היצירה הנזכרת, ויהי\n  האדם כולו לנפש חיה, <strong>כי בנשמה הזאת ישכיל וידבר</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>'And G-d formed man', the formation of the ability to move. And after he formed him with this ability, 'He blew into his nostrils a נשמה of life' from the mouth of the Upper One. This נפש was to increase on the formation previously mentioned. And man became entirely a living being, because with this <strong>נשמה he became intelligent and could speak</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, I believe contrary to this is what Rav Dessler writes in מכתב מאליהו חלק א pp. 72</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>י...כבר היה אדם טרם שנופחה בו נשמתו...<strong>ונפשו</strong> גדולה מנפשות שאר הברואים, משכלת\n  היא בחכמה, פירוש <strong>שיש לו גם שכל וגם כח הדיבור</strong> וההסבר מה שאין כן בשאר\n  בעלי חיים. ואחר כך שם בו הקדוש ברוך הוא אל הנשמה הקדושה, היינו כח\n  קדושה עליונה.</p>\n  \n  <p>...Man existed before the נשמה was blown into him...<strong>[Man's] נפש</strong> is greater than the נפשות of other creatures, for it is intelligent with wisdom. Meaning, it <strong>has both intellect and the ability to speak</strong> and to explain. This is not true for other creatures. Afterwards, The Holy One, Blessed is He, placed in [Man] the Holy נשמה, meaning the upper holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there a source for what Rav Dessler is saying? It's not what he's focusing on and says it as if it's something that doesn't need explanation. But it is contrary to the sources I'm familiar with.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# the difference between the wise and the clever\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone, years ago, told me the difference between the chacham (wise) and the pikeach (clever) men; the chacham does not enter, where a pikeach knows how to escape from. (החכם לא נכנס, משם פיקח יודע איך לצאת) (or something like that).</p>\n\n<p>I love the wisdom in this quote, but I have been unsuccessful in finding the source for this aphorism. I've asked my rabbi, who did not recognize the quote (but did point out that in many instances chazal point out that the chacham shows foresight, or thinks ahead). In sefaria.org I have tried to search on the combination of keywords חכם and פיקח, but I could not identify results that resembled the aphorism.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a source for this aphorism? And if yes: what is that source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I couldn't find the aphorism, but as per clarification in the comments sources contrasting the two terms for a smart person hakham (חכם) andpikeah (פקח) are acceptable, so here goes:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaakov_Tzvi_Mecklenburg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Mecklenburg</a> writes the following in his Haktav V'hakabbala (Deut. 16:19)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה כמו שיש אדם פקח ואיננו חכם, כן יש אחר שהוא חכם ואיננו פקח, שהרי תאר חכם נופל על מי שאסף חוקי חכמת התורה ונוהג כן, אעפ\"י שאין בו כח שכל ובינה גדולה שבעבורן יתואר פקח </p>\n  \n  <p>That is, one can be a hakham, but not a pikeah, and vice versa. He writes that the former refers to someone who has amassed Torah knowledge and lives by it, while the latter refers to someone who possesses natural intellectual gifts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> writes as follows (Deut. 23:8):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שסתם חכמה הונח על דברים שאי אפשר לאדם להוציא מכח בינתו רק לקבלם מפי אחרים ...ועקר שם חכם הונח על החכם בחכמת התורה...מצאנו ג\"כ על צד ההרחבה שיבוא שם חכמה וחכמים על חכמים במלאכת מעשה ודברים מדיניים, ויש הבדל בין חכם ובין פקח, ששם פקח הונח בעצם שישקיף בעין שכלו על דברים נעלמים מיתר בני אדם, שעקר שם פקח הונח על הסרת המכסה מעל עינים הפנימיים</p>\n  \n  <p>That is, hokhma refers to that which cannot be intuited or independently derived, and can only be learned through tradition. Primarily this refers to the Torah traditions, but more broadly it can refer to crafts and politics. Pikeah, however, refers to the intellectual ability to grasp what others do not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: R. Mecklenburg, and R. Hirsch agree that hakham refers to one with acquired knowledge, while pikeah refers to one with natural intellectual talent, and that hakham refers especially to someone with Torah knowledge.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Often, especially among earlier writers, it seems that the terms were used interchangeably. See for example Rashi to Bava Kamma 35a:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בשור פקח - שהשור חכם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding different attitudes to apparent synonyms, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67569/8775\">here</a>. Regarding the view of R. Meckelenberg (and Malbim in particular), see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67569/8775\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Science/Scientism a form of Idolatry?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the scientific community (and much of the secular world) there are many who adopt an outlook whereby one need not believe anything which cannot be demonstrated using the scientific method. i.e. it must be repeatable through experiments and explained through cause/effect scientific principles.</p>\n\n<p>so if something cannot be demonstrated like this, then one need not believe it and can dismiss it as \"unscientific\".</p>\n\n<p>This automatically rules out things like intelligent design, since God does not make Himself available to microscopes. Regardless of the tremendous level of wisdom displayed in living things and in the cosmos, one can simply brush it all off since we cannot demonstrate the existence of an intelligence through repeatable experiments.</p>\n\n<p>how does Judaism view this outlook?\nWould someone who adopts this be considered some sort of idolater (who worships his own mind, i.e. he elevates the human mind as some kind of idol since only that which he can demonstrate and prove with his mind exists.)</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps it is just a form of atheism since the person adopts the view that there is no intelligence behind the world and it is all just one big physical machine which always does the same thing. Thus it can all be best explained with the scientific method.</p>\n\n<p>Looking for sources from our tradition or from contemporary Halachic authorities who address this. Reliable works of Hashkafa (jewish outlook) such as Michtav M'Eliyahu would also be good. Looking especially for sources saying it is a form of idolatry if such exist.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Forgive me for a short preamble, but it is necessary to establish what scientists (i.e. practitioners of science) mean with ‘unscientific’ before exploring how it differs from what believers of scientism (i.e. science as a worldview, excluding all other worldviews) believe, and whether that could be avoda zarah. </p>\n\n<p>Firstly, this question conflates the scientific method, as a tool, with the worldview that elevates the conclusions drawn with that tool beyond its reach. Science as a concept is just a tool: a social contract between those that decided to find and explain patterns in the world. The social contract governs the criteria that constitute what the scientific community would regard as adequate proof for any given claim.</p>\n\n<p>When scientists claim that something is unscientific it does not necessarily follow that the claim therefore must not be true. An unscientific question or claim is just something that cannot be proven or disproven using the currently agreed upon scientific tools. It is beyond the realm of what science can believably claim, and so does not further our understanding within this social contract. Any claim that cannot be tested within this framework is deemed unscientific, but note that this says nothing about the validity of the claim.</p>\n\n<p>For instance: to state that no purple polar bears exist is an unscientific question, because it is impossible to measure  'none-existence'; one simply never knows whether all the polar bears in existence have been found and their color established. There may very well be a purple polar bear, hiding from scientists in a cave somewhere: absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. In that regard, science itself cannot be idolatry: the metaphysical simply falls outside of what scientists can form hypotheses and scientific proofs on. To ask whether a deity exists, is an unscientific question, but the tool to establish that ultimately does not impact the reality. When people say that the Egyptians were wrong, because we can see the Sun and no beetle rolls that Sun in front of the Earth daily, the only scientific reply would be: have you looked in all possible dimensions? Our ability to perceive it (or measure it with current scientific tools) does not change the reality; just our ability to provide the agreed upon proof. </p>\n\n<p>To conclude: science itself is a set of rules which changes every once in a while; those rules are an agreed upon set of criteria to judge the evidence to a particular claim.</p>\n\n<p>Now that the preamble is over, it becomes possible to distinguish between the users of the scientific tool in scientific discourse and the believers of scientism who hold the view that  “ the characteristic inductive methods of the natural sciences are the only source of genuine factual knowledge and, in particular, that they alone can yield true knowledge about man and society\". When is this a proper application of the scientific method, and when does it start to veer into the realm of “if I see it, I will believe it”. Or in other words still: the difference between “we can finally agree upon the proof about a claim” and “something is not true, unless it has been proven”.</p>\n\n<p>In this divide I believe important to point out that none of the big name philosophers that have been connected with scientism (e.g. Popper, Weber) would argue that something is only true if proven). However, inside and outside of the scientific community there are those that go beyond the scientific method and who do make such claims. So let me establish that in and of itself scientism does not have to be either avadah zarah, or even problematic from a jewish perspective. The question is rather; can those who elevate science to the realm of religion (i.e. the only fundamental universal truth) veer into the realm of avodah zara? </p>\n\n<p>I don’t consider myself able to conclude whether someone’s belief constitutes avodah zara (chas vechalila), there are learned people who are infinitely better able to establish this than I. I can just share my thoughts.</p>\n\n<p>The RAMBAM in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912359/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">mishneh torah</a> makes an interesting point about how a thought process can start with God and the instruments He uses, and end with worshipping the tool</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בימי אנוש טעו בני האדם טעות גדול ונבערה עצת חכמי אותו הדור ואנוש עצמו\n  מן הטועים היה וזו היתה טעותם אמרו הואיל והאלהים ברא כוכבים אלו וגלגלים\n  להנהיג את העולם ונתנם במרום וחלק להם כבוד והם שמשים המשמשים לפניו\n  ראויין הם לשבחם ולפארם ולחלוק להם כבוד וזהו רצון האל ברוך הוא לגדל\n  ולכבד מי שגדלו וכבדו כמו שהמלך רוצה לכבד העומדים לפניו וזהו כבודו של\n  מלך כיון שעלה דבר זה על לבם התחילו לבנות לכוכבים היכלות ולהקריב להן\n  קרבנות ולשבחם ולפארם בדברים ולהשתחוות למולם כדי להשיג רצון הבורא בדעתם\n  הרעה וזה היה עיקר עבודת כוכבים וכך היו אומרים עובדיה היודעים עיקרה לא\n  שהן אומרים שאין שם אלוה אלא כוכב זה הוא שירמיהו אומר מי לא ייראך מלך\n  הגוים כי לך יאתה כי בכל חכמי הגוים ובכל מלכותם מאין כמוך ובאחת יבערו\n  ויכסלו מוסר הבלים עץ הוא כלומר הכל יודעים שאתה הוא לבדך אבל טעותם\n  וכסילותם שמדמים שזה ההבל רצונך הוא:</p>\n  \n  <p>During the times of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise\n  men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one\n  of those who erred. Their mistake was as follows: They said God\n  created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed\n  them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who\n  minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify\n  them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the\n  will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He\n  magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who\n  stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of\n  honor to the king. After conceiving of this notion, they began to\n  construct temples to the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They\n  would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves\n  before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their\n  false conception - be fulfilling the will of God. This was the essence\n  of the worship of false gods, and this was the rationale of those who\n  worshiped them. They would not say that there is no other god except\n  for this star. This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared\n  (10:7-8): \"Who will not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it\n  is fitting. Among all the wise men of the nations and in all their\n  kingdoms, there is none like You. They have one foolish and senseless\n  [notion. They conceive of their] empty teachings as wood;\" i.e., all\n  know that You alone are God. Their foolish error consists of\n  conceiving of this emptiness as Your will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And we have also learned <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881#v=3&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow\">shemot 20:3</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לֹא יִהְיֶה לְךָ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים עַל פָּנַי: You shall not have the gods\n  of others before me</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Which rashi explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>the gods of others</strong>: which are not gods, but that others have made them\n  for gods over themselves. It is impossible to interpret this passage\n  to mean: gods other than I, since it is a disgrace for Heaven to call\n  them gods along with Him. Alternatively: strange gods, for they are\n  strange to their worshippers. They cry out to them, but they do not\n  answer them, and it appears as if it [the god] were a stranger, who\n  never knew him [the worshipper].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When an individual starts elevating G’ds tools (the universal laws of nature) to the only true gods. Avadah Zarah does not need an actual deity; it seems sufficiently troubling to take anything and make it a god for yourself. So what can be elevated to the level that it comes before G’d in [extremist] scientism? When man’s own intellect and what it is currently able to comprehend and prove is stated to be the only factual truth in the universe, that person is not only unscientific, but has started to elevate its own intellect above everything else. In this worldview, the individual intellect comes before G’d: because only as long as the intellect decides to accept it, G’d will exist. A subjective and conditional existence of G’d places oneself before G’d in such a worldview. (\"G’d only exists if I decide He exists\"). I would argue that such an extreme position could be regarded as a form of idol worship, with the above texts in mind.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact, given that the groom is attempting to \"marry\" a nonJewish woman, one would probably not be allowed to answer Amen if <em>he</em> (or another Jew) said the blessing.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/927667/jewish/Berachot-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchos Brachos chapter 1</a> law 13</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>13 Whenever a person hears a Jew recite a blessing, he is obligated to\n  respond Amen, although a) he did not hear the blessing in its\n  entirety, b) he was not obligated to recite that blessing himself.</p>\n  \n  <p>One should not respond Amen if the person reciting the blessing is a\n  gentile, an apostate, a Samaritan, a child in the midst of study, or\n  an adult who altered the text of the blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The use of the Amen serves to state that the blessing being made is appropriate and valid. The Rambam states in the laws of oaths that a person can be considered to have sworn to the truth of the oath being stated (by another) by answering Amen. Similarly we see in the Torah that a sotah becomes subject to the curse by answering Amen to the oath that a priest reads.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, when a person answers Amen to a blessing he is stating that this is a valid blessing and he is including himself in that blessing (such as now being able to drink the wine or eat the food). If a person is not allowed to answer Amen to a blessing, then the implication would be that it was not a proper bracha.</p>\n\n<p>However, this may not be as simple a question as it seems <a href=\"http://www.mesora.org/AnsweringAmen2011.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Don’t Be So Quick to Respond</a> by <a href=\"http://www.migdalhatorah.org/rdg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Dr. Darrell Ginsberg</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The concept of a bracha actually has two components to it as it\n  relates to the halachic system. On the one hand, a bracha is a\n  halachic action, a religious performance like any other. The reason a\n  person recites a bracha prior to eating food, for example, is that\n  benefiting from this world requires a matir, so to speak; thus, the\n  bracha is functioning as a halachic performance. As such, a person\n  must be able to relate to this very system in order to recite the\n  bracha. He must be a gavra hamechavein, possessing the inherent\n  ability to have intent prior to engaging in a halachic performance.\n  Based on this reasoning, <strong>one would never answer “Amen” to the bracha\n  of a non-Jew, as he is essentially unable to engage in any Jewish\n  religious performance</strong>. </p>\n  \n  <p>There is another aspect to bracha that makes it unique, which will aid\n  us in understanding how one could answer “Amen”. The text of a bracha\n  is a statement of objective reality. Within the bracha, a person\n  expresses the fact that God is Blessed, King of the Universe, and\n  relates this idea to the performance at hand, such as referencing God\n  as the “boreh pri ha’adama”. And as we know, the response of “Amen” is\n  in fact an acceptance of this very truth. The Rambam notes that we\n  answer “Amen” even if we are not ourselves obligated in said bracha,\n  indicating that it reflects our acknowledgment of the truth contained\n  in this expression. If this is the case, then the intent of the\n  individual becomes of secondary import. It is true the non-Jew does by\n  definition not have the right intent when making the bracha. However,\n  the cheftzah of bracha is able to emerge regardless, as it stands on\n  its own as a declaration of truth. Therefore, according to this\n  opinion, one should respond “Amen” when (on the off chance) he hears a\n  non-Jew recite the bracha. </p>\n  \n  <p>In terms of practical pesak, both positions can be found throughout\n  the works of Rishonim and Acharonim. The Tur (OC 215) cites both\n  opinions (his father, the Rosh, following the second line of\n  reasoning). The Shulchan Aruch (ibid 2) only cites the issue as it\n  relates to a kusi; however, he writes in another place (ibid, Beis\n  Yosef) that the kusi is equated to the non-Jew, and therefore we would\n  not answer “Amen” to his bracha. The Rema, however, writes explicitly\n  that one should answer “Amen” to the bracha of the non-Jew.</p>\n  \n  <p>A more contentious issue emerges in the case of answering “Amen” to\n  the bracha of a kofer/apikoris, an individual who denies a fundamental\n  yesod of Judaism, such as Torah from Sinai, or possesses a distorted\n  idea of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He cites Rav Moshe Feinstein as stating that the words of a kofer are actually worse than the blessing recited by a non-Jew and may not be answered at all. This would apply if the (Jewish) groom were asked to recite the blessing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 2:50, as well as in other teshuvos)\n  expands on this issue, reinforcing that one should not answer “Amen”\n  to a bracha recited by a kofer. He writes, in referring to\n  Conservative/Reform rabbis, that since they are denying God and his\n  Torah, the enunciation of the name of God by them is simply words\n  (devarim be’alma) without any intent towards God. Therefore, it does\n  not even rise to the level of an actual bracha, lacking in shem and\n  malchus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You should also note that if the groom says the normal statement made at a Jewish wedding (or someone says it for him)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Behold you are sanctified to me by the laws of Moses and Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>he is actually stating explicitly that this is not a valid wedding.</p>\n\n<p>Another problem would be if the food (or the wine in this case) is <a href=\"https://www.nishmat.net/torah/view.asp?id=312\" rel=\"nofollow\">not kosher</a>. There is a dispute between the Rambam (Brachot 1,19) and the Rosh. The Shulchan Aruch (Orach Haim 196,1) rules in line with the Rambam, that one does not say a bracha before or after eating non-kosher food. One should note that the dispute involves whether a Jew (for whom it is a sin) may or may not make a blessing on it.</p>\n\n<p>Note that with wine, this applies even though it was not \"<em>used as a libation for idol worship</em>\" because the laws of libation also apply (by rabbinical decree) to any non-kosher wine.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/927667/jewish/Berachot-Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchos Brachos chapter 1</a> law 19</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>19 When a person eats a forbidden food - whether consciously or\n  inadvertently - he should not recite a blessing beforehand or\n  afterward.</p>\n  \n  <p>What is implied? If one eats tevel - even food that is classified as\n  tevel by Rabbinical decree, the first tithe from which terumah was not\n  separated, or the second tithe or sanctified foods that were not\n  redeemed in the proper manner, one should not recite a blessing.\n  Needless to say, this applies if one ate meat from an animal that was\n  not ritually slaughtered or was trefah or if one drank wine used as a\n  libation for idol worship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a discussion as to the reason behind this dispute which centers on whether the essential meaning of the blessing is centered on whether this is a blessing on a sin (and may even be blasphemous) or that it is valid (after the fact) because there was enjoyment of Hashem's bounty. It is possible that a non-Jew (for whom the food is permitted) would be able to make the blessing, although Jews should not answer Amen.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nishmat.net/torah/view.asp?id=312\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bracha On Non-Kosher Food.</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam writes \"When a person eats a forbidden food - whether\n  bemaizid (intentionally) or beshogeg (inadvertently) - he should not\n  recite a blessing beforehand or afterward\" (Brachot 1,19). This is\n  also found in the Talmud Yerushalmi, where it explains that such a\n  blessing would be \"na'atz Hashem\", as in Tehillim 10,3 which can be\n  read as \"the one who blesses and blasphemes Hashem\". What a chutzpah\n  to say a bracha on sinful eating!</p>\n  \n  <p>However, both the Ra'avad and the Rosh rule that a blessing must be\n  said before and after eating non-kosher food. The Mishna merely rules\n  that a non-kosher meal is not considered as important enough to\n  require a zimun on it – but in the words of the Ra'avad, \"why\n  shouldn't he say a bracha before and after eating, since he enjoyed\n  the food?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

These civilians can not be considered guilty co-conspirators (as some of the answers to the related question characterize civilians in war time).</p>\n\n<p>Would her actions have been considered a sanctioned act of rising up to kill a rodef (does it make a difference that she was not in danger, but others were?) or did she not have the right to take other lives (possibly as related to Sanhedrin 74a: \"It happened with Rava: A man came to Rava and told him that the governor of the city had ordered that he (the man) slay a certain man or himself suffer death, and Rava said to him: 'Rather than slay another person, you must permit yourself to be slain, for how do you know that your blood is redder than his, perhaps his blood is redder than yours?'\")</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>This question is highly interesting and leads to halachical study about several dinim in Mishna and Gemara. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Rodef: Torah allows and commands to kill someone who is about to murder someone else.</li>\n<li>The rule of rodef applies even if the killer is not responsible for this action (e. g. a child). </li>\n<li>In certain situation, there is a choice to deliver it  to the murder one specific person only  or several persons.</li>\n<li>In certain situations, a man needs to be killed to avoid delivering someone to death.</li>\n</ol></li>\n<li><p>Let's examine some sources.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Mishna Sanhedrin 8, 7</strong>: we need to save somebody life by killing his\nchaser.</li>\n<li><strong>Gemara Sanhedrin 72b</strong>: R' Huna said: A minor in pursuit may be slain to save the pursued. </li>\n<li>If each side presents a danger for the other, <strong>Mishna Ohalot, 7, 6</strong>, concerning a dangerous childbirth: Once his head has come forth,\nhe may not be harmed, because one life may not be taken to save\nanother.</li>\n<li><strong>Mishna Terumot 8, 12</strong>: Women, who are told by gentiles \"Give us one of you to defile. If not, we will defile all of you,\" they should\nallow themselves all to be defiled rather than give over a single\nsoul of Israel to.</li>\n<li><strong>Tosefta Terumot 7, 23</strong>: A group of Jews who was told by gentiles  \"Give us one of you to kill. If not, we will kill all of you,\" they\nshould allow themselves all to be killed rather than give over a\nsingle soul to. Rabbi Yehuda described the case: He is protected in a\nclose room and they are outside. But if he an them are in the same\nroom, they must to surrender him because he will be killed in both\ncases. So says the book of Samuel \"Then the woman went to all the\npeople in her wisdom. And they cut off the head of Sheba the son of\nBichri, and threw it out to Joab.\" The wisdom was to say \"In one case\nhe is killed and you are killed, you can surrender him to kill and\nyou will not be killed. But Rabbi Shim'on's does'nt agree and think that they surrend him because he was already sentenced to death (This is treated in Talmud Yerushalmi)</li>\n<li><strong>Yerushalmi Trumot 8, 4</strong> (47a), a discussion the same case is discuted between Tana Kama and Rabbi Shim'on, about the wisdom explained by the Tana Kama of the Mishna. At the first glance, the reasoning of Tana Kama and Rabbi Shim'on are combined by Resh Lakish, may be that for R. L. the argument of Rabbi Shim'on is also taken into consideration by Tana Kama.</li>\n<li><strong>Rambam Mada Yesode Hatorah, 5, 5</strong> stated as Resh Lakish, and <strong>Rashi</strong> (Sanhedrin 72b), seems to think that it is a discussion in Bavli between Rav Huna and Rav Chisda concerning Rodef. Rav Chisda follows the Resh Lakish svara and Rav Huna the Rabbi Yochanan Svara. So the \"hostage\" in the case of the Tosefta in Trumot is considered as an innocent Rodef. But following <strong>Rambam, Nezikin, Rotseach 1, 7</strong>, the cases are not similar.</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Let's examine a case in which the pilot can shoot down the plane without killing herself. The Tosefta of Teruma is not relevant according to the Rambam because it is a case of Rodef. To fight seems to be a duty, despite the stringency of Rambam in the case of the Brayta in Trumos.</p>\n\n<p>In the case in which she needs to kill herself, the Mishna in Ohalot seems to prohibit this. We need to add that the count of persons seems to be irrelevant, according to the Mishna and Tosefta in Terumot.</p>\n\n<p>This answer is only the seeds of a reflection, the first steps after the question, to clarify the problem and initiate the study of Rishonim.</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud compares the messianic age to the Sabbath and note that a day to God is like a thousand years. So Sunday (0-1000), Monday (1000-2000), Tuesday (2000-3000), Wednesday (3000-4000), Thursday (4000-5000), Friday (5000-6000), and Shabbat (6000-7000).</p>\n\n<p>It has been taught in accordance with R. Kattina: \"Just as the seventh year is one year of release in seven, so is the world: one thousand years out of seven shall be fallow, as it is written, 'And the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day,' and it is further said, 'A Psalm and song for the Sabbath day,' (Ps. 92:1) meaning the day that is altogether Sabbath — and it is also said, 'For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past' (Ps. 90:4).\"\n2</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It would mean absolutely nothing. All it would mean is that we (living in what we think is year 6000) either miscounted or (those who wrote the medrash) misinterpreted what was going on. Many people have guessed when the mashiach would arrive and been wrong. Consider the division of the ages of the worls into two thousand year epochs in which the birth of Avraham (1948), Yitzchak (2048) or Yaakov (2108) are considered the end of the first epoch. The dates in such calculations are only approximate.</p>\n\n<p>All we can say is that when someone appears to have met the criteria for mashiach, then we would be willing to accept him. If he fails or dies, then admit that he wasn't and go on. Look at the trouble Shabtai Tzvi and his predecessors for the past several thousand years have caused.</p>\n\n<p>Rambam does not set the time at 6000 years. He says Hashem will send Mashiach when He has determined to. We are guessing about 6000 years. Indeed consider the problem if it actually means 6001 (1 - 1000, 1001 - 2000, ... 5001 - 6000) and people get upset about mashiach not coming in 6000 Or indeed, consider the upset if people are off in when during the year. Chet Haeigel occurred because of a one day miscalculation.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188357/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Hilchos melachim 12:2</a> says</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Regardless of the debate concerning these questions, neither the order\n  of the occurrence of these events or their precise detail are among\n  the fundamental principles of the faith. A person should not occupy\n  himself with the Aggadot and homiletics concerning these and similar\n  matters, nor should he consider them as essentials, for study of them\n  will neither bring fear or love of God.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly, one should not try to determine the appointed time for\n  Mashiach's coming. Our Sages declared: 'May the spirits of those who\n  attempt to determine the time of Mashiach's coming expire!' Rather,\n  one should await and believe in the general conception of the matter\n  as explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a quip that the prohibition did not stop the Rambam from speculating.</p>\n\n<p>As it says <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/jewfaq/mashiach.htm#When\" rel=\"nofollow\">When Will the Mashiach Come?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There is a wide variety of opinions on the subject of when the\n  mashiach will come.  Some of the Jews' greatest minds have cursed\n  those who try to predict the time of the mashiach's coming, because\n  errors in such predictions could cause people to lose faith in the\n  messianic idea or in the Torah itself.  This actually happened in the\n  17th century, when Shabbtai Tzvi claimed to be the mashiach; when Tzvi\n  converted to Islam under threat of death, many Jews converted with\n  him.

For example, each of\n  the following has been suggested as the time when the mashiach will\n  come:</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>when all Israel repent a single day   </li>\n  <li>when all Israel observe a single sabbath properly   </li>\n  <li>when all Israel observe two sabbaths in a row properly   </li>\n  <li>in a generation that is totally innocent, or totally guilty   </li>\n  <li>in a generation that loses hope   </li>\n  <li>in a generation where children are totally disrespectful towards their parents and elders (commonly thought to be \"our generation\", in\n  every generation!)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It would mean nothing for Judaism.

If Hashem has\n  decreed that a person will be lacking parnasah, how should Tefillah be\n  able to change the bodings [see Ramban (Parshas Vayetzeh 30 2)].</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sefer Haikrim (4 18) explains that through the\n  Tefillah THE PERSON rises to a new level of connection to Hashem, and\n  relative to the person who came IN to the shul, the one leaving it is\n  a new person. Hence Tefillah doesn’t change Hashems mind, it changes\n  the person who is davening, and consequently we are judged\n  differently. The initial decree was only given against the person\n  while he stays on his initial level, however, if the person manages to\n  change his status, his judgment changes too.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many Seforim use this concept to explain how tefillah can change a\n  heavenly decree [See Baal Shem Tov (Amud Hatefilah 159)].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Suppose for example two brothers are deathly ill, both pray, change themselve in the same manner, doing the same stuff etc. but one dies and the other one get cured and stays alive.

G-d's decrees are\n  not black and white, either one gets a million rand or one gets\n  nothing, regardless of what one does. Rather, the decree is calibrated\n  according to one's actions. In other words, to use the example of the\n  farmer, if one puts in the effort and ploughs his field and does\n  whatever is necessary - reaping, employing workers, finding buyers -\n  then one will have a successful harvest and earn a decent living; and\n  if not, he won?t. (Of course, it could be that for some people, their\n  particular decree is that their crops will fail even if they put in\n  the effort; and for others there may be a special decree that they\n  become wealthy without lifting a finger - for example, by winning the\n  lottery. That is certainly possible. However, the decrees in heaven\n  take our efforts and actions into account and can be calibrated\n  accordingly.)</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus we see that although there are decrees which are issued on Rosh\n  Hashanah and sealed on Yom Kippur, they are linked to our actions.\n  Coming back to the discussion regarding prayer, Rav Albo says that\n  prayer is the same: decrees are linked to our prayers. Meaning, a\n  certain decree may have been issued, but G-d built into the original\n  decree that it is dependent on our praying. G-d does not change his\n  mind because we nag him. Rather, He issues the decree in such a way\n  that our prayers can change its outcome For example, suppose G-d\n  forbid there was a decree of ill health for a particular person. It\n  could be, based on what Rav Albo says, that although the decree has\n  been given, the person will be healed by praying. Or, it could be\n  that, unfortunately, even with prayer, the person won't be healed.\n  That, too, could have been part of the original decree. But we are\n  required to pray, because it can affect the outcome of the decree -\n  not because it''s causes G-d to change His mind, so to speak, but\n  because prayer was part of the original decree.</p>\n  \n  <p>Furthermore, Rav Albo says, through the process of prayer we actually\n  change who we are, and that in itself has the ability to change the\n  decree. When we pray to G-d, we are transformed and uplifted. In fact,\n  Rav Albo compares prayer to the process of repentance. Prayer, like\n  repentance, changes who we are. It could be that a certain decree was\n  issued, but if a person repents the decree might be changed in the\n  merit of his or her repentance. The purpose of prayer is not to change\n  G-d?s mind but to change  us . G-d issued the decree based on who the\n  person was at that particular time. If, through the process of prayer,\n  one has changed, if one has become uplifted and closer to G-d, then it\n  is as though he or she is a new person and consequently the decree may\n  change - not because G-d changed His mind, rather because the person\n  has undergone a process of spiritual transformation. Prayer is a\n  golden opportunity which Hashem has given us to become new people, to\n  change ourselves and become closer to Him and thereby affect heavenly\n  decree.</p>\n  \n  <p>Prayer is about changing who we are. When we change ourselves, we have\n  the ability to change the world. There is always hope and the\n  possibility of changing G-ds decrees, not in the sense of making G-d\n  change His mind, but because the very nature of a decree is that it\n  can be changed. In other words, G-d may have put the challenge of the\n  decree before us so that we change it through our prayers. G-d, in His\n  kindness, has given us a framework which is responsive to our actions;\n  and it is up to us to pray, transform ourselves, and thereby influence\n  our fate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Could it be that although one dies and another one lives, in both cases the decree changed, although from a human perspective it seems that in one case it didn't?</p>\n\n\n",

In his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shabbat.7.2?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Shabbat.7.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to mishnayot Shabbos 7:2</a> he writes:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Since 39 lashes are referred to as \"forty minus one\" (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.22a.15-22b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 22a</a>), 39 Melachot are as well.</p></li>\n<li><p>The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.49b.6-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 49b</a>) says that the number of Melachot is derived from the number of times it says Melacha in the Torah. The Talmud points out that it actually says Melacha 40 times, and says that one doesn't count. Therefore we say there are \"forty minus one\" Melachot.</p></li>\n<li><p>One only performs the Melacha of sewing if one ties a knot at the end. Tying a knot is also a Melacha.

One before the sowing, and one after. Therefore, if someone transgresses all 39 Melachot he did two acts of plowing, so 40 transgressions to do all 39 Melachot.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>R’ Aryeh Kaplan zt”l noted in a class once that Chazal number the melakhos as “40 missing 1”. It could be a shorthand for 39, much the way the “i” is placed before the last “x” in the Roman numeral version “xxix”. People using Roman numerals would think of a number that ends in \"9\" as a \"missing one\" from the round number.</p>\n\n<p>And even that may be a prosaic piece of the puzzle; it's how the non-Jews around us wrote numbers.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is also significance to forty as forty. The acts of creation is described in mishnah Avos (5:1) as being 10 utterances -- \"בַּעֲשָׂרָה מַאֲמָרוֹת נִבְרָא הָעוֹלָם\". Based on a verse in Yeshaiah (43:7), “כֹּ֚ל הַנִּקְרָ֣א בִשְׁמִ֔י וְלִכְבוֹדִ֖י בְּרָאתִ֑יו יְצַרְתִּ֖יו אַף־עֲשִׂיתִֽיו׃ -- everything (1) called in My name and for My Honor, (2) I created it, (3) I formed it, (4) I even did it” The Zohar derives from this verse that each act had 4 aspects. Thus yielding 10 * 4 = 40.</p>\n\n<p>The same 40 shows up as a symbol of birth and rebirth in the number of days of rain in the flood, the number of years it took us to mature into a nation in the desert, the number of se’ah of water in a miqvah, the number of days after gestation before the soul enters the fetus as well as the gender is determined, etc…</p>\n\n<p>But of the 40 acts of creation, one is creation ex nihilo (making something where there was nothing), yeish mei’ayin. Since people can’t rest from creating something from nothing — we can not do it altogether during the week either — the rest of Shabbos is very much a break from “forty missing one” activities.</p>\n\n<p>And “forty missing one” is also the maximum number of makos (lashes) meted out as punishment, given the person could survive that many. They are given in sets of three: on the right, the left, and the middle, and separated by a pause for a medical inspection — can the person handle another three?</p>\n\n<p>The 39 melkhos can be broken down into four categories: The first 11 melakhos listed in the mishnah (Shabbos 7:2) begin with planting, and describes the steps necessary to grow the wheat, turn it into flour, and make the lechem hapanim, the showbread. The next 13 are about preparing the cloth of the curtains of the Mishkan, from the wool to the dying to the weaving and sowing. Seven melakhos relate to preparing hides into leather, and the last 8 are simply “none of the above.</p>\n\n<p>Ashkenazim make 39 windings on our tzitzis — also in groupings of 7, 8, 11, and 13. Yemenites wind their tzitzis in groups of 3. The Shulchan Arukh haRav rules both -- double knots separating the windings the same way other Ashkenazim would, but also a daisy chain of smaller knots down the side grouping the windings into 3. Notice again the same convergence of symbolic numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Just as tzitzis are worn “so that you will remember all of My mitzvos“, so too Shabbos commemorates the creation of the whole, and the punishment of makkos is to bring someone back after having violated the purpose of the whole. \"Forty missing one\" is used in all these cases as a number indicating the entirety of human action.</p>\n\n<p>(Any errors are likely because R' Kaplan passed away 33 years ago, meaning that we're relying on the accuracy of my memory of a talk given over something like 34-35 years ago.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For a more mystical answer see the Maharal at the very end of the first Be'er of Be'er Hagolah. There he discusses exactly the same language of 40-1 regarding giving someone 39 lashes instead of 40. He says it's because the number 40 corresponds to the formation of a fetus, and an offender deserves lashes corresponding to his development. However, the 40th number represents his completion, and that cannot be counted (kind of like the whole is greater than the sum of its parts). As many scholars have compared the building of the Mishkan to the building of the world, as well as the building of a human, the melachot would represent the act of creation and as such reaching 40 would be impossible for a human being. Therefore the Gemara would be suggesting that there should be 40 melachos, but as humans we can only perform 39 of them.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps that doesn't apply since one\nonly exposes it to oxygen which causes it to heat up and Makeh Bpatish\ncan't be violated indirectly. 3) Molid. Changing the form of an item\nis molid. However, it is a dispute in many cases such as making ice,\ncrushing ice, making seltzer, and using whipped cream. <strong>Rabbi Shimon\nconcludes that it is permitted only in cases of great need. Rav Zalman\nNechemya Goldberg said that it is preferable to use the hand warmers\nin an abnormal way. Rabbi Aryeh Lebowitz quoted Rabbi Rice who quoted\nRav Schachter that ruled it was forbidden because of Molid. He also\ncited Rabbi Mordechai Eliyahu who said it was molid.

    "content": "# Arukh HaShulḥan on the number of times we say ashrei\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aruch_HaShulchan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arukh HaShulḥan</a> gives several reasons for us repeating ashrei (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.145?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ps 145</a> plus attendant verses) multiple times during our daily prayers. In his first reason, he connects it with the kedusha of the amida and the kedusha in the uva l'tziyon paragraph, as he writes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.132.1?vhe=Arukh_HaShulchan,_Orach_Chayim_--_Wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (square-bracket additions are mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮דכשם שבשחרית יש שני קדושות, לבד קדושה ד\"יוצר\" שאינו אלא סיפור איך המלאכים אומרים קדושה, ולכן יש שני פעמים \"אשרי\" בשחרית. ובמנחה יש קדושה אחת – תיקנו פעם אחת \"אשרי\". ובערבית ליכא קדושה – לא תיקנו כלל.</p>\n<p>Just as in shaḥarit there are two kedushot (besides the kedusha in \"yotzer\" <em>[the first of the two brachot before sh'ma]</em>, which is simply a description of how the angels say kedusha), therefore there we say \"ashrei\" twice in shaḥarit. And at minḥa, there is one kedusha, so they established \"ashrei\" once. And at arvit, there is no kedusha, so they didn't establish it <em>[ashrei]</em> at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain how verses in ashrei correspond to the kedusha. Anyhow, this one-to-one correspondence works out fine during the week, but on days with musaf (or ne'ila), it doesn't hold. On shabbat, for example, we have ashrei before the shaḥarit amida and ashrei before the musaf amida, but minḥa has two kedushot (one in the uva l'tziyon paragraph and one in the amida) but only one ashrei, and in the evening, there is another uva l'tziyon paragraph without an ashrei. The Arukh HaShulḥan does write (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.292.1?vhe=Arukh_HaShulchan,_Orach_Chayim_--_Wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) that the ashrei + uva l'tziyon at minḥa on shabbat is pushed off from shaḥarit, but doesn't address there (that I see) why this ashrei double-counts (if it does) for the kedusha of the minḥa amida. The count is similarly off for any day with musaf.</p>\n<p>Does the Arukh HaShulḥan (or others who play off his reasoning) address this anywhere?</p>\n<p><em>Note: I'm not looking for other reasons for repeating ashrei, just in understanding this one.</em></p>\n\n\n",

I found in several Gemarot that there is Qorban Chatat only for sins that are punishable by Caret when intentionally made.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״וְכִי תִשְׁגּוּ וְלֹא תַעֲשׂוּ אֵת כׇּל הַמִּצְוֹת הָאֵלֶּה״, וּכְתִיב: ״וְהַנֶּפֶשׁ אֲשֶׁר תַּעֲשֶׂה בְּיָד רָמָה״. הוּקְשׁוּ כּוּלָּם לַעֲבוֹדָה זָרָה: מָה לְהַלָּן דָּבָר שֶׁחַיָּיבִים עַל זְדוֹנוֹ כָּרֵת וְשִׁגְגָתוֹ חַטָּאת, אַף כׇּל דָּבָר שֶׁחַיָּיבִין עַל זְדוֹנוֹ כָּרֵת וְעַל שִׁגְגָתוֹ חַטָּאת.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I don't find the rule that a sin punishable by death penalty is punishable by Caret when there is no witnesses.</p>\n<p>I know that the Gemara in the third chapter of Ketubot says that Chyuve Mita, the sentence is executed by events when there is no Bet Din. But this is an other issue.</p>\n<p>I know that in Bamidbar 15, Megadef is Caret. But for Rabanan (Keretot 7b and Pesachim 93b) it's to sing for Avoda Zara, not punished by death penalty, and for Rabbi I assume that is to curse Hashem without the name of Hashem, following Sanhedrin 56a.</p>\n<p>(1): See Sefer Hamitzvot from the Rambam Lo Taase 352.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן התבאר לך שכל מי שנתחייב מיתה בבית דין איזו מיתה שתהיה הנה האיש ההוא בכרת גם כן כשלא המיתוהו בית דין או לא נודע לו, מלבד עשרה אנשים שהם מחוייבי מיתת בית דין ואין עליהן כרת והם מסית ומדיח ונביא שקר ומתנבא בשם ע''ז וזקן ממרא ובן סורר ומורה וגונב נפש מישראל ורוצח ומכה אביו ואמו ומקלל אביו ואמו, וכל אחד מאלו כשנחקרה עליו העדות יהרג, ואם לא יהרג שלא יוכלו בית דין להרגו או לא נודע לו הנה הוא מתיר עצמו למיתה אבל אינו עומד בכרת. ושמור אלו השרשים וזכור אותם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation (From Sefaria).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And likewise has it been made clear to you that anyone who is liable for a death penalty of the court - whatever death penalty it may be - behold, that man is also [punished] with excision, when the court did not kill him or it it did not know about it - except for ten cases... etc... And hold on to these principles and remember them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Megadef is not included in the list of exceptions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As I mentioned in the comments to the question, I don't believe such a rule exists. That is, the following types of sin all exist:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>A sin which incurs the death penalty when done intentionally in the presence of witnesses, and <em>karet</em> when done intentionally without witnesses.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A sin which incurs the death penalty when done intentionally in the presence of witnesses, but never <em>karet</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A sin which never incurs the death penalty, but does incur <em>karet</em> when done intentionally.

As I was reading in a passage by the Riva in shul (I believe it was in a biography about Abir Yaacov), Hashem's Name is revealed, but His Essence is concealed i.e. He Himself is concealed, but we know His Name. We know <em>Him</em> by <em>His Name</em>. Does that make sense? (He went on to say, interestingly, that we are the same: we have a soul and a body, and the body is revealed but the soul is concealed, yet through the body we can know the soul 🤯)</p>\n<p>Saying we love His Name isn't any different to saying we love Him.

The idea of a Name in Torah isn't just a pointer to a person. It also represents a person's mission, purpose, and what they are all about. This topic comes up a lot but I have rarely heard it so well explained than this shiur by Rabbi Tovia Singer, discussing one of Hashem's Names: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chCzWp1wxak\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Muslim Asks Rabbi Tovia Singer: Why Did Moses Ask God for His Name? Didn’t the Jews Know God’s Name?</a>.

Was looking for information on this method of tying\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RPZBD.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RPZBD.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>It’s known as the 7-8-11-13 method. I heard rumblings of it being mentioned by the Tanchuma. Do any modern halachic authorities consider this a valid attempt at fulfilling techeiles.\nAlso should there be a white string before every chulyo(set of loops) on this set. Or one at the beginning and one at the end? Saw something regarding that as well. All knowledge appreciated.\nCheers!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The tying method of 7,8,11,13 was used after the techeiles went out if disuse(forgotten). From the gemara in Menachos 39a the numbers of windings per chulya(braid) is 3 or 7(Rabbeinu tam),and a minimum of 7 braids and maximum of 13. It would seem that method for techeiles doesn't align with gemara so well. It should be noted almost every way of tying will basically fulfill the mitzvah bdeieved.  Having 2 knots and one braid of at least 3 wrappings is the minimum.</p>\n<p>With regards to the white wimdings ,techiles windings should start with white and end with white as per the gemara in Menachos 39a</p>\n<p>Menachos 39a:</p>\n<p>תנא כשהוא מתחיל מתחיל בלבן הכנף מין כנף וכשהוא מסיים מסיים בלבן מעלין בקודש ולא מורידין</p>\n<p>Sefaria translation:</p>\n<p>It was taught: When one begins to form the windings, he begins winding with a white string. This is because the verse indicates that one first inserts “the fringe of the corner” (Numbers 15:38), i.e., the white strings, which are of the same type as the corner of the garment. And when he concludes the windings, he concludes with a white string, in accordance with the principle: One elevates to a higher level in matters of sanctity and does not downgrade.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I would recommend checking out <a href=\"https://www.tekhelet.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">tekhelet.com</a> and <a href=\"https://bluefringes.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bluefringes.com</a>. They are both fantastic resources for information about Techeiles and tying methods.</p>\n<p>I don't have the exact sources in front of me, but some points on tying:<br>\n-Tie the corners in the order front right, front left, back right, back left as there is greater importance given to the right vs left and to the front vs back. (Based on this order, it would seem that the front vs back is a bigger consideration than right vs left.)<br>\n-Say לשם מצות ציצית while holding the four strings, right before inserting them into the hole.<br>\n-Insert all four strings at the same time into the hole. (This is from the Kaf HaChaim, but some say it is only a hiddur to do so.)<br>\n-When tying Techeiles, the first wrap closest to the beged and the final wrap furthest from the beged should be white. The rest can be either white or blue, but you should follow an established method of tying. The websites linked to above both have information on the different methods of tying.</p>\n<p>I have been tying tzitzis now for over 10 years for numerous individuals, giving me experience with all the various methods of tying for both Techeiles and plain white. I'm always happy to share the tips and tricks I've learned over the years.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Enigmatic interpretation of Mishlei 4:23 - \"More than all that you guard, guard your heart, For it is the source of life.\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.4.23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 4:23</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִֽכׇּל־מִ֭שְׁמָר נְצֹ֣ר לִבֶּ֑ךָ כִּֽי־מִ֝מֶּ֗נּוּ תּוֹצְא֥וֹת\nחַיִּֽים׃</p>\n<p>More than all that you guard, guard your heart<sup>*</sup>, For it is the source\nof life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The basic understanding of this is one should protect one's heart. Physically, look after it because a healthy heart is vital for a long life. Spiritually, one's heart is the seat of one's emotions and thoughts, which is the centre of a person, and therefore in this sense too, the heart is one's life.</p>\n<p>On the latter, I wondered if it could be interpreted two opposite ways. Either it means \"protect your heart\" i.e. don't open your heart to people unless you really trust them (which is something I believe personally to be a very <em>bedi'eved</em> (non-ideal) solution to preventing damage to one's emotional core, with a lot of negative consequences outside the scope of this question), or it could mean the opposite: <strong>don't</strong> develop trust issues, as these create barriers around the heart and thus a person will lose their connection to their heart, and therefore they haven't protected it at all. <em>This latter point is my general understanding of how we should treat our heart from my learning.</em></p>\n<p>Either way, best to turn to the commentaries and not only did they go in a different direction, but they also confused me.</p>\n<p>The commentaries effectively equate the heart to one's Mitzvot. The message is, treat the easy Mitzvot the same as you would the hard ones, because we see that both the easiest Mitzva (sending away the mother bird), and the hardest Mitzva (honouring one's parents) are both rewarded with \"life\", which implies every Mitzva is life (Midrash Tanchuma Ki Teitze).</p>\n<p>The gemara Yerushalmi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.1.7.14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רִבִּי אָחָא בְשֵׁם רִבִּי יִצְחָק. כְּתִיב מִכָּל־מִשְׁמָר נְצוֹר\nלִבֶּךָ כִּי מִמֶּנּוּ תוֹצְאוֹת חַיִּים. מִכָּל־מַה שֶׁאָמַרְתִּי\nלָךְ בַּתּוֹרָה תִּשְׁמוֹר. <strong>שֶׁאֵין אַתְּ יוֹדֵעַ מֵאֵי זֶה מֵהֶן\nיוֹצֵא לְךָ חַיִּים</strong></p>\n<p>Rebbi Acha in the name of Rebbi Isaac: It is written:\n\"More than all that you guard, guard your heart, For it is the source\nof life.\" observe carefully all the things you were told in the Torah,\nfor <strong>you do not know from which of them life will come to you</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi on the pasuk:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכל מה שאמרה תורה <strong>השמר נצור לבך (מעבור עליו)</strong> בין עבירה קלה בין עבירה\nחמורה:</p>\n<p>From whatever the Torah commanded to beware of, <strong>guard your heart (from\ntransgressing)</strong>, regardless whether it is a minor sin or a grave sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Guard your heart from transgressing.</p>\n<p>See also this fascinating <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash%20Tanchuma,%20Ki%20Teitzei%202:1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Can someone help me sort out all of the above? What is the connection between guarding one's heart and transgressing, and/or doing Mitzvot**? Why do we say that \"we don't know which Mitzva one's life will come from\"? Why did King Shlomo use this lashon to teach these messages? Are there any connections between any of this (or any other commentaries) with my initial thoughts in the first and second paragraphs?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* translated sometimes as \"thoughts\" as according to Kabbalah/Chassidut, thoughts take place in the heart. However, the heart is also a reference to the emotional centre of a person, so both interpretations are correct (and connected - outside the scope of this question)<br />\n** I don't generally have any issue with this connection itself, as it goes with my learning that sin causes us emotional damage (and converse), but this connection doesn't seem to be explained here, just assumed. I would like it to be spelled out to me.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your confusion here comes from the fact that the way we speak of the heart in contemporary society and the way it was spoken of the Bible are very different.</p>\n<p>In modern society the heart usually refers to love, especially between people. More broadly, it is the seat of emotion; as opposed to the mind, which is the seat of reason.</p>\n<p>In Judaism, the heart can refer to both desire and the seat of reason. Broadly, it can refer to one's neshama, as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.1.1.3?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> teaches on the first passuk in the Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We know from the study of logic that speech is called <em>safah</em> because it is seen to come from the lips. Similarly man’s highest soul is called heart (lev) even though the soul itself is incorporeal while the heart is corporeal. It is referred to in this manner because the heart is its first resting place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To give one example of <em>Lev</em> meaning intellect, when Hashem promises wisdom to Shlomo Hamelech He <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.13?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִנֵּה עָשִׂיתִי כִּדְבָרֶיךָ הִנֵּה  נָתַתִּי לְךָ לֵב חָכָם וְנָבוֹן אֲשֶׁר כָּמוֹךָ לֹא־הָיָה לְפָנֶיךָ וְאַחֲרֶיךָ לֹא־יָקוּם כָּמוֹךָ׃<br />\nBehold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there has been none like thee before thee, nor after thee shall any arise like thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(You will also see many examples in the upcoming parshiyos that deal with building the Mishkan.)</p>\n<p>There are also numerous examples of the heart referring to desire. From the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">description</a> of humanity before the flood:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּרְא יְהוָה כִּי רַבָּה רָעַת הָאָדָם בָּאָרֶץ וְכָל־יֵצֶר מַחְשְׁבֹת לִבּוֹ רַק רַע כָּל־הַיּוֹם׃<br />\nAnd the Lord saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that all the impulse of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another from the book of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.6.18?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֵב חֹרֵשׁ מַחְשְׁבוֹת אָוֶן רַגְלַיִם מְמַהֲרוֹת לָרוּץ לָרָעָה׃<br />\na heart that devises wicked thoughts, feet that are swift in running to mischief,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is why we are specifically warned, and must repeat twice a day in reciting the Shema, to guard our hearts. As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.15.39.2?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann_--_corrected_vocalization&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there explains</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND YE SHALL NOT SEARCH AFTER YOUR OWN HEART. The heart and the eyes are the “spies” of the body — they act as its agents for sinning: the eye sees, the heart covets and the body commits the sin (Midrash Tanchuma, Sh'lach 15; cf. Talmud Yerushalmi Berakhot 1:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.12b.22?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">also</a> describes this verse as referring to one's intellect</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As it was taught: “After your hearts” refers to following opinions of heresy that may arise in one’s heart. The Gemara offers a proof, as it is stated: “The fool said in his heart: ‘There is no God’ (Psalms 14:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.11.2?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings I 11:2</a>.)</p>\n<p>So in the original verse you quoted, when it warns about the importance of guarding your heart, it means guarding your desires and your thoughts, because these will be the determining factors in a person's life. The classic Mussar sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pele_Yoetz.403.30?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pele Yoetz</a> applies this verse to avoiding all bad character traits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לב טוב זה כולל כל המדות הטובות כמו שאמרו זכרונם לברכה, וכתיב (משלי ד כג) מכל משמר נצר לבך, רצונו לומר מכל דבר רע, מגאוה וקנאה ושנאה וחמדה רעה ומתאות הבלי העולם הזה ומאהבות וראיות רעות וכעס ועצבות והתפארות ואכזריות וכילות, ומכל דבר שהוא בכללא דרע, ישמר את לבבו כאישון בת עין, שלא ידבק בו אבק רע מהמדות רעות הנ''ל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the Maamar ViKibeil HaYehudim explains, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe in the maamar Ve'Atah Tetzaveh, explain that Moshe is, as kabbalah and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eikhah_Rabbah%2C_Petichta.24?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">other sources</a> calls him, \"the faithful shepherd\" - רעיא מהימנא.

However, even if we take the direction that the Avodas Yisrael takes, e.g. that oil is a reference to wisdom and that Moshe was teaching every single individual, that still does not explain why the children of Yisrael needed to bring the oil to Moshe. Wouldn't it be more logical that the oil was Moshe's wisdom in Torah, and that he spread that?</p>\n<p><strong>Why did the people needed to bring the pure oil to Moshe and why not to Aharon?

I understand the concept both Rebbeim are teaching us in their maamarim, but I am looking for a more \"ready-to-understand\" answer, The Rebbeim use kabbalistic concepts, that I find difficult to understand when reading it. In Likkutei Sichos, the Rebbe says that many meforshim make the same observation: why was the oil needed to be brought to Moshe?, so far, I was able to locate a few, but none of them answeres the question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is the way I understand the נצי\"ב in parshas Emor where it again discuss bringing the olive oil- he explains the point of this command is for Moshe to be like a king. If he orders there to be oil to light the Menorah, so that he can see when he goes to the mishkan. It is a decree.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משה מלך עשיתיך מה מלך הוא גוזר ואחרים מקיימין כך הוי גוזר וישראל מקיימין ... דמבואר מזה שהיה משה שייך ביחוד ללקיחה זו לולי שחלק הקב״ה\nכבוד למשה והזהיר את ישראל שהם יקחו בשביל משה. וגם לשון צו את ב״י דמשמע\nבכ״מ זרוז מאיזה טעם לפי הענין כמש״כ ר״פ צו. מש״ה הבינו חז״ל שמצוה זו\nלא היה נוגע תכליתה לתועלתם אלא בשביל משה. וזהו לשון המדרש צו את ב״י\nגזור והם מקיימים.<br />\nHashem says to Moshe, I am made you a king, just\nlike a king decrees and others obey so to you will command and the\nJewish nation will obey… It is clear from here that the reason why\nonly Moshe was commanded to this collection (the olive oil), is\nbecause Hashem wanted to give honour to Moshe and also to command the\nJewish nation to take the oil for Moshe.

Burning requires energy in order break the chemical bonds, but produces more energy then it consumes (hence exothermic), in what is called a \"runaway reaction\"</p>\n<h2>How does water put out fires?</h2>\n<p>it can do this one of 2 ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The water goes thru a phase change taking a lot of energy from the fire which can lower the woods temperature bellow the point that wood burns. This stops the reaction</li>\n<li>Burning wood requires both wood and oxygen (Which limits the speed that wood burns). Water can prevent oxygen from coming into contact with wood, this prevents the reaction from occurring (this is how pouring sand, salt, and fire extinguishers smother a fire to \"put it out\").</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>What does this mean?</h2>\n<p>If the amount of water that you pour on a fire is small enough it will not put out the fire. The fire will be strong enough to evaporate the water without losing enough heat to stop burning.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, rain isn't a bucket of water poured at once from the heavens onto the ground... It is a bucket of water that is slowly dripped onto the ground over a long period of time.</p>\n<h2>So why is rain bad for fire then?</h2>\n<p>There is a 3rd way to kill a fire. Which is to starve it of fuel (wood, or other flammable material. When it rains, wood gets wet which makes it harder to burn. If it has been raining long enough, its possible that the wood will require more energy to dry out then it will release... (Or it will require more energy then your fire is capable of providing... Either way, wet wood makes it hard to start a fire/maintain a fire.</p>\n<h2>Special preparations needed for rain?</h2>\n<p>Have a supply of dry firewood. This doesn't come from historical sources, but from years camping out in the woods... Including rainy days/nights. If you have a large enough supply of dry wood, you ca keep a fire going in almost any rainstorm (Obviously not thru a hurricane, monsoon, or other major weather event).</p>\n<h2>The scientific method (Testing this for yourself)</h2>\n<p>Go camping (or somewhere you can build a fire outside). Build a small fire. Try slowly pouring water onto the fire... You will notices that the fire doesn't go out, you will get a lot of steam, but the fire will continue to burn. This is because the fire is evaporating the water as it lands onto the fire... Now take a bucket and dump the entire contents on the fire at once. You will notice that the fire went out. This is because the amount of water  that you poured onto the fire out paced the fires capability to evaporate it and so it cooled the fire below the critical point of the exothermic reaction, halting the reaction.</p>\n<h2>Bonus facts.</h2>\n<p>Not only are fires strong enough to evaporate water from a light rain (and thus not burn out).

    "title": "LOR Questions family planning",
    "content": "# LOR Questions family planning\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>One of the most common questions Rabbis tend to get is about contraception. Specifically a discussion about family planning, and how long one can use contraception for.  Before the man has fulfilled his mitzvah of Peru Urvu to avoid doing a Mitzvah Dioressah could be problematic.  However, once they have a boy and a girl there is now a mitzvah drbanan of lsheves.<br />\nMy question is why do Rabbis say this is a question that must be asked, I don’t ask a Rabbi if I should have guests over for Shabbos. What is the difference they are both avoding doing a biblical commandment (one is Hachnosas Orchaim the other peru urvu). I don’t ask my Rabbi if there is a ‘heter’ to avoid visiting my parents for a year to avoid Kivud Av?\nWhy by family planning is there such an emphasis on asking the Rabbi when other mitzvos (which are not time bound) there is no emphasis to ask?<br />\nThe answer I am looking for should be based on sources why lsheves/pru urvu is more stringent than other Yoreh Deah cases.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>Based on the comments this has been added: Since birth control until more recently was highly problematic, from a Halachic standpoint, there was never any questions about using it, unless Pikuach Nefesh it was Assur. In the past few years where the actual BC is not an issue itself, there has been little public talk in terms of Halcahic writings on it.  We are left to infer from the writings which we will call the source. This source can be the Rambam as answered by Dov. We don’t paskan by the Rambam if the SA does not concur with the ruling.  We have a Gemora as RabbiKaii and Dov wrote. (Besides the Ramchal in his letters disagreeing with this concept) The Shulchan Aruch does not bring this as his opinion.<br />\nWe are left with the Shulchan Aruch which says if someone remarries he should remarry to a woman who can have children even if has been Yotze peru urevu. We see from this that he is pro having more children if he can. The minhag has always been to ask questions like this to our Rabbis, I shall continue to do so.<br />\nI am still hoping someone will be able to help find a source that can help me understand the Halchic (NOT HASHKAFIK) reason why to ask whether one can take a break after being Yotze Pru urvu (+1) when timed mitzvos generally we don’t ask (for example I don’t know anyone who asked a rov how much money they should put away a month for writing or buying a sefer Torah)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Possibly because of the following:</p>\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Marriage.15.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Ishus 15:16</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁקִּיֵּם אָדָם מִצְוַת פְּרִיָּה וּרְבִיָּה הֲרֵי הוּא מְצֻוֶּה מִדִּבְרֵי סוֹפְרִים שֶׁלֹּא יִבָּטֵל מִלִּפְרוֹת וְלִרְבּוֹת כָּל זְמַן שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ כֹּחַ. שֶׁכָּל הַמּוֹסִיף נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל כְּאִלּוּ בָּנָה עוֹלָם</p>\n<p>Even once a person has fulfilled the Mitzvah of having children, it is a commandment from our Rabbis not to stop having children all the time one has the strength to do so, since for every additional soul in Israel it is like he has built a whole world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also note the Minchas Chinuch on the first mitzvah who says that the mitzvah of Peru Urevu differs from other commandments in that it is an ongoing mitzvah and does not have a time limit.</p>\n<p>Finally, also refer to the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.63b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 63b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי אַסִּי: אֵין בֶּן דָּוִד בָּא עַד שֶׁיִּכְלוּ כׇּל הַנְּשָׁמוֹת שֶׁבַּגּוּף, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״כִּי רוּחַ מִלְּפָנַי יַעֲטוֹף וּנְשָׁמוֹת אֲנִי עָשִׂיתִי״. תַּנְיָא, רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר אוֹמֵר: כׇּל מִי שֶׁאֵין עוֹסֵק בִּפְרִיָּה וּרְבִיָּה — כְּאִילּוּ שׁוֹפֵךְ דָּמִים, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״שׁוֹפֵךְ דַּם הָאָדָם בָּאָדָם דָּמוֹ יִשָּׁפֵךְ״, וּכְתִיב בָּתְרֵיהּ: ״וְאַתֶּם פְּרוּ וּרְבוּ״.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Asi said: The Messiah, son of David, will not come until all the souls of the body have been finished, i.e., until all souls that are destined to inhabit physical bodies will do so. As it is stated: “For the spirit that enwraps itself is from Me, and the souls that I have made” (Isaiah 57:16). It is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Eliezer says: Anyone who does not engage in the mitzva to be fruitful and multiply is considered as though he sheds blood, as it is stated: “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed” (Genesis 9:6), and it is written immediately afterward: “And you, be fruitful and multiply” (Genesis 9:7). (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are a lot of meta-halachic issues at play. (See the question in general about \"why ask a rabbi?\".) But from a strict theory-of-halacha angle, one note I've heard is that \"not inviting guests\" is passive. Any form of birth control (other than total abstinence, I guess) involves taking some action. This could be considered <em>bitul asei</em> -- actively avoiding a \"yes-do\" mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that there are multiple reasons for this phenomenon.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Most people have not learned the sugya of what types of birth control are permissible and in what circumstances. These topics are rarely talked about in public and aren't published in English seforim for the layperson.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The mitzvah of sheves and l'erev al tanech yodecha, makes it that there can be no blanket heter. There is a constant chiyuv.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Moreover, sheves/l'ereve is a mitzvah that is given great importance in halacha. The Gemara in Chagigah 2b uses sheves as a basis for forcing a master to sell a slave. And Tosafos on the spot says that sheves is an even more powerful mitzvah than pru ur'vu. One is allowed to sell a Sefer Torah just to be mekayem sheves/l'erev (see Shulchan Aruch Even HaEzer 1:2, 8 and the Bais Shmuel on the spot). Which does not apply to any other mitzvah other than learning Torah. On the other hand, the mitzvah is only d'rabanan so people are more likely to be mezalzel in it.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The combination of these 3 factors means that there is a great danger that if a shaila is not asked, people will make major mistakes and be oiver on hashchosas zera or bitul sheves. Moreover--as discussed by Rav Moshe in Even HaEzer 4:67--there is a danger of people learning heterim from their friends and applying it to themselves where they shouldn't.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you have learned the sugyos yourself and are confident in your ability to pasken for yourself, that is great. You don't need to ask a shaila because you know the answer already.</p>\n\n\n",

Sefardim don’t, but they also at least have to be able to read the Mishnah according to Chananya. According to him, the Mishnah says (actual Mishnah words in bold), “…<strong>If heated with peat or wood</strong>, [you may do shehiyah (with food that is ma’achal ben drusai), even if the kirah is not garuf or katum. But,] <strong>you may not do chazarah unless the kirah is garuf or katum.</strong>”<br />\nThe simple reading surely is that, if the kirah <em>is</em> garuf or katum, chazarah is permitted <em>with food that is ma’achal ben drusai</em>. (Otherwise, the Mishnah would be changing the case in the middle.)</li>\n<li>All rishonim (except for Rashi) seem to hold that garuf v’katum doesn’t stop the kirah from cooking, but serves as some kind of a heker or barrier, preventing the person from stirring the coals. Or, that without garuf v’katum, it “appears to be cooking” (מחזי כמבשל). But all these rishonim hold that a kirah that is garuf v’katum is still fully capable of cooking.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how is possible to read the Mishnah according to Chananyah?</p>\n<p>By the way, the same question seems to apply on the beginning of the mishnah: With קש וגבבה (straw and stubble), you may \"place\" food on the kirah. According to Chananya, that means doing chazarah [להחזיר תנן, unless he's changing in the middle of the mishnah], and with food that is מאכל בן דרוסאי, only partially cooked. How is that possible, if the straw and stubble add enough heat to cook?</p>\n<p>The simple part of the answer is that all the Rishonim we usually see <em>explaining</em> the gemara (Tosefos, the Ramban, the Rashba, the Ran) - every one holds that אין בישול אחר בישול, so none of them has this issue. On the contrary, this is pretty much their <em>source</em> that אין בישול אחר בישול, these kind of reading issues. Then they have the opposite issue: Why then is there any problem with chazarah, if the food is cooked? They need to come up with various kinds of reasons d'rabanan.<br />\nSo my question is based on, if you hold יש בישול אחר בישול.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14401&st=&pgnum=240\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eglei Tal in Melechet Ofeh 10:10</a> is bothered by this question. He writes that it is clear from the <em>mishnah</em> at the beginning of <em>perek kirah</em> that once a food reaches the level of <em>ma'achal ben derusa'i</em> there cannot be <em>bishul mide'oraita</em>, as otherwise how could <em>chazara</em> be permitted?</p>\n<p>His solution is to posit that according to the majority of <em>rishonim</em> (he lists Tosafot, Rosh, Tur, R. Yerucham and Rambam) there is no prohibition to cook food which is <em>ma'achal ben derusa'i</em> on a <em>de'oraita</em> level, but that there is still a prohibition <em>miderabbanan</em>. Since we are only dealing with an <em>issur derabbanan</em>, <em>chazara</em> is permitted <em>lechatchilah</em>, providing one fulfils the relevant conditions.

The Beis Yosef is hard-pressed to find a reason for the din, as the chazarah happens later on Shabbos.<br />\nI'm wondering if this Rishon is coming to answer my question: He holds that you aren't allowed to cook food that's partially cooked on Shabbos, so Chananya must be talking about fully cooked food. How then does he read the mishnah allowing chazarah on מאכל בן דרוסאי (if the kirah is garuf v'katum)? The state of the food <em>before</em> Shabbos - the same as the food needs to be to allow shehiyah without garuf v'katum.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, I was surprised to see the same topic in two places in Maseches Mikvaos, and in both I think you need calculus to solve it.\nAnd there is actually a third place that a discrete version of the same problem appears.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Mikvaot.3.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mikvaos 3:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בּוֹר שֶׁהוּא מָלֵא מַיִם שְׁאוּבִין וְהָאַמָּה נִכְנֶסֶת לוֹ\nוְיוֹצְאָה מִמֶּנּוּ, לְעוֹלָם הוּא בִפְסוּלוֹ, עַד שֶׁיִּתְחַשֵּׁב\nשֶׁלֹּא נִשְׁתַּיֵּר מִן הָרִאשׁוֹנִים שְׁלשָׁה לֻגִּין.</p>\n<p>If a cistern is full of drawn water and a channel leads into it and\nout of it, it continues to be invalid <em>until it can be reckoned</em> that\nthere does not remain in it three logs of the former [water].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tosefos Yom Tov points out that the language \"reckoned\" sounds like you need a calculation, אלא לפי חשבון המים שהיו בבור, והמים היורדים בתוכו הם יוצאים.\nIt's hard, because: As kosher water flows in, initially almost all the water leaving is she'uvim. But as more kosher water flows in, assuming it's all mixed up, the percentage gradually changes; when it's half and half, half the water leaving is kosher water and only half is she'uvim - etc.<br />\nIt's not a hard problem, first-year calculus, and the answer is going to be that there is an exponential decay, getting slower and slower with time but eventually getting down to 3 לוגין. Does anyone before Isaac Newton להבדיל do this calculation?</p>\n<p>Then here it is again, in the fifth perek (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Mikvaot.5.1?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Mikvaot.5.1.7&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">5:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֶעֱבִירוֹ עַל גַּבֵּי בְרֵכָה וְהִפְסִיקוֹ, הֲרֵי הוּא כְמִקְוֶה.\nחָזַר וְהִמְשִׁיכוֹ, פָּסוּל לַזָּבִים וְלַמְצֹרָעִים וּלְקַדֵּשׁ\nמֵהֶן מֵי חַטָּאת, עַד שֶׁיֵּדַע שֶׁיָּצְאוּ הָרִאשׁוֹנִים</p>\n<p>If [a spring] is made to pass over into a pool and then is stopped, ...\nIf it is made to flow again, it is invalid for zavim... until it is\nknown that the former [water] is gone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tosefos Yom Tov there points us to what he said on the earlier mishnah, that it has to be done through a calculation. That would mean another exponential decrease, as the non-maayan water is gradually diminished by the new water flowing in.<br />\n<em>However</em>, I don't know how to do it here; over there it gave an endpoint, 3 לוגין of שאובים remaining. Here it just says, Until the former water is gone. But it will never be completely gone.</p>\n<p>The third case starts in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Mikvaot.7.2?lang=bi&with=Tosafot%20Yom%20Tov&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah 7:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲבָל שְׁאָר הַמַּשְׁקִין, וּמֵי פֵרוֹת, כו' פְּעָמִים מַעֲלִין\nוּפְעָמִים שֶׁאֵינָן מַעֲלִין. כֵּיצַד. כו' הָיוּ בוֹ אַרְבָּעִים\nסְאָה, נָתַן סְאָה וְנָטַל סְאָה, הֲרֵי זֶה כָשֵׁר</p>\n<p>But other liquids, and the juice of fruits, ... sometimes raise it up\nto [the required quantity] and sometimes do not raise it up. ... But\nif the mikveh contained forty seah and a se'ah of any of these was\nput in and one seah was removed, the mikveh is still valid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.82b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamos 82b</a> goes further: You can keep repeating this, until you no longer have a majority of the original water.</p>\n<p>This is also an exponential decay, but it is discrete instead of continuous. Each time you add a seah (bringing the total up to 41 seah) and remove one, the percentage of the original water is multiplied by 40/41 - until it gets down to 50%. Someone could do that without calculus. But did they?</p>\n<p>The kadmonim say you need a calculation; do any of them discuss how to do it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a Mirkeves HaMishneh on Rambam Hilchot T'rumot 13:5 that discusses your latter case and goes through the calculation, which is a discrete calculation of repeated mixings. It's a difficult one with seeming mistakes. It seems clear that generally speaking we do not have much information on how to do these calculations from the kadmonim. For the discrete cases, twenty 40ths of mixing would be assumed to switch the majority, based on a simple calculation based on even mixing. Rabbi Akiva Eiger on SH YD 201:24 states that the Shulchan Aruch wasn't so much concerned with mathematics as it was certain halachic considerations.</p>\n<p>All of the above can be borrowed to the continuous cases as well, by estimating how long it takes a se'ah to flow in, and waiting the number of those units of time until the number of se'ahs matches half the se'ahs in the mikva, plus one.</p>\n<p>My friend has recommended \"Approaching Infinity\" by Rabbeinu Shlomo of Chelme who goes through the interesting mathematics of Chazal, and from which I got information for this answer.</p>\n\n\n",

This will make him zealous to fulfill Hash-m's word and guard himself from sin. If he sinned, he will repent fully. Through this, he merits the world to come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ArtScroll gemara Brachos cites the MB and brings the Rabbeinu Bahya on Vayikra 7:37:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What the sages mean is that once one has familiarized himself with the deeper meaning of each type of offering, it enables the student of these laws to gain new insights which in turn will strengthen his resolve to meticulously observe all the precepts of the Torah. Seeing that offering the sacrifices is also meant to bring us closer to G’d, it is no more than reasonable that studying these laws will have a similar effect. Such study and new resolve to observe the Torah will result in the sins of such people being forgiven, similar to their having performed the actual procedure of offering the relevant sacrifices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bonus: See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meshekh_Chokhmah%2C_Bekhukotai.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meshech Chochmah, beginning of parashas Bechukosai</a>.</p>\n<p>In a footnote, ArtScroll explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara does not mean that one merits a place in the World to Come merely due to the recital of this psalm. Rather, it means that it could be a decisive factor (Ohel Moed, cited by Beis Yosef to OC 51). In other words, the recital of this psalm is not a matter of minor importance. It ranks in importance among all other mitzvos, and is thus weighty enough to tip the scale in someone's favor and merit him with his place in the World to Come (Avudraham, in his discussion of the Ashrei recited after the Shemoneh Esrei)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to all of the above, it has to do with the fact that due to this prayer(s), we can see how we are meant to behave ourselves during the day, following the morning-prayers. The Kollel Iyun Hadaf article <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/berachos/insites/br-dt-004.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>, in the name of the Rabbeinu Yonah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two explanations are given by TALMIDEI RABEINU YONAH. Both explanations assume that it is not simply following the order of the prayers that earns one a share in Olam ha'Ba. One will achieve this lofty level only if he follows the mention of the redemption with the Shemoneh Esreh prayer for the proper reasons. If one continues and conducts himself throughout the day in accordance with the principles inherent in the reasons for the connection between the account of the Exodus and the Shemoneh Esreh, he will be worthy of the World to Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why does the word \"tzaddik\" and the \"righteousness hierarchy\" mean different things or have different terms depending on author and context?",
    "content": "# Why does the word \"tzaddik\" and the \"righteousness hierarchy\" mean different things or have different terms depending on author and context?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The word \"tzaddik\", typically translated as \"righteous\", comes up quite a lot in different Jewish texts. Someone who is righteous would be called a \"tzaddik\", as a noun. There are often different levels of righteousness, which I am here referring to as the \"righteousness hierarchy\", for lack of a better term. Generally, this refers to multiple gradations of being a tzaddik, or some level beyond that of a tzaddik. More \"normal\" people would be either a rasha (wicked) or beinoni (in between).</p>\n<p>There is a lot of variation in what exactly the term means, however, depending on the source. For instance, the Talmud (I have no specific page number, but this is what I understand the Talmud to say by other sources) states that a tzaddik is anyone whose good deeds outweigh their bad, and so is written in Sefer Tzaddikim on Rosh Hashanah. The Tanya's first chapter, meanwhile, states that a tzaddik is far above such a level, and in fact not only has no sins, but has no desire to sin at all (and, if I understand the text correctly, may not even have any evil inclination!). The beinoni, meanwhile, has no sins but may still have a desire to do so, that must be overcome. The Tanya explains that the Talmud uses the concept of a \"relative tzaddik\" when discussing the idea, and does not, as far as I know, discuss any level or gradation above that of the tzaddik. It also says that people are either born with this capability (or at least potential for it), or they are not and so the beinoni is the highest achievable ranking for most.</p>\n<p>Mesilas Yesharim, by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzatto, gives a gradation of yeshar < tzaddik < chasid < kodesh, where the first three are attainable by anyone through their own merit but the kodesh requires intervention from Hashem. I am not certain whether all four levels are in fact \"tzaddikim\" (that is, the whole concept has the name of its second level) or if only the second level is. Meanwhile, one footnote to the Koren NCSY Siddur for weekday and shabbos (page 423) quotes another rabbi, Rabbi Chayyim of Volozhin, who places the yeshar's status <em>above</em> that of the tzaddik, and says the tzaddik retains a desire to sin and the yeshar does not. In this formulation, the tzaddik is like that of the Tanya's beinoni, and the yeshar is like the Tanya's tzaddik. (Information is not given as to if or how a normal person can attain these levels).</p>\n<p>There are enough commonalities between these different ideas that it seems as though they <em>might</em> be talking about the same phenomenon and simply disagree on the nomenclature, but there are also some notable differences. What exactly are the relationships between the concepts of tzaddik, beinoni, chasid, etc, within these different fromeworks? Do they refer to the same thing but with different words? Are they related but distinct ideas? Or do the sources disagree on what it means to be a tzaddik in a more fundamental way than simply what word refers to what status?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The tl;dr answer is that the terms are variable, but the concepts are the same (perhaps with some minor debatable differences).</p>\n<p>You've done a good job in the question demonstrating this. A comparison between Mesilat Yisharim and Tanya would be a good way to approach this.</p>\n<p>In Mesilat Yisharim, the first 3 chapters are about becoming a \"Tzaddik\". The highest rank of that is a \"Naki\" and Ramchal confirms in Chapter 13 that he describes a \"Naki\" as a \"Tzaddik\". It refers to someone who has completely stopped all sinning, because he has become aware of Hashem to the point where he would be simply too ashamed to sin anymore, even though he could feel temptation.</p>\n<p>This matches up with Tanya's \"Benoni\" practically to a T. In chapter 1, the Rebbe explains with reasoning why he chose that word, after Rabba, instead of Tzaddik. Ramchal didn't go into detail in the terminology in that way, so just uses the more standard \"Tzaddik\" to explain the idea.</p>\n<p>It's the <em>idea</em>, that is the important thing. I.e. that there is a grade which anyone can achieve where one graduates beyond good and evil. Evil no longer exists in a person's range of free-will options. Both sefarim then take the reader to a new place, the first rung in the ladder of being a real mentch, which is to be a Chassid.</p>\n<p>After sorting out one's actions and middot, a person now has a new task - to work on their intentions. Once a person is no longer battling their yeitzer hara daily, they have a new job to do, which is overcome self-centeredness altogether. I.e., reach a point where one doesn't spend their time and energy in the pursuit of their own survival and wants (which doing good deeds and avoiding evil can certainly just be an extension of), but spend it serving others, pursuing <em>their</em> survival and wants.</p>\n<p>Mesilat Yisharim takes us through three steps in that. The first is <em>perishut</em>, which is the first step in weaning oneself off one's desires and self-service. Then one begins working on one's intentions in \"Tahara\", so that they are doing good because it's right, not because it's good for <em>me</em>. Then they will move on to working on their heart and mind as a \"Chassid\", who does good because it pleases Hashem and one's fellow man, and this is their great passion, borne out of a true altruistic love for ones fellow Neshamot, and one's Creator. All of this can be found in Tanya or other Chassidic works. There's no fundamental disagreement on anything.</p>\n<p>I have not personally done a good comparative study between \"Kadosh\" and \"Tanya Tzaddik\", I wouldn't be surprised to find many parallels, although if they are different, that would also make sense, as there is a lot to discuss in these topics.</p>\n<p>The point is, all of these works, which were all produced in a similar time in history, all stand on the shoulders of the giants of old. They build from the same sources: Talmud, Aggadah, Rambam, Chovot Levavot... One can see how they draw from these and produce, remarkably, very similar ideas (using different words) to teach us what Hashem wants. Even though they didn't live in the same countries or lifetimes, they all end up following the Torah to the same place and that's what is our charge to learn and follow, each to their preference and minhag.</p>\n<p>I hope that answers your question. Don't worry too much about terminology.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yonah Reiss of the Beth Din of America has lectures on this matter. He noted that a hundred+ years ago in Eastern Europe, the couple would settle everything, square it all away, and then the very final step would be the Gett.</p>\n<p>Today in America, common practice is for the Gett to be the very first step after the couple have moved out and decided it is over. Then they can kill each other fighting over the money, kids, or the like. (The concern is if it's left till the end, it may never happen, or be used as leverage.)</p>\n<p>If I'm reading this correctly, the issue raised by the Rabbis Feinstein is specifically if the order is: a.) they agree to some settlement. b.) The Gett is given. c.) She reneges on said agreement.</p>\n<p>Again, if I'm reading it correctly, the issue here is that it now <em>looks like</em> the whole Gett was under false premises. Suppose first the couple settles (between themselves) that he'd get 50%; then they do a Gett; then she refuses to hand over the keys unless she gets 60%. He could then claim \"I only agreed to the Gett with the assumption that I'd get 50%\" ... leaving the Gett <em>possibly</em> invalid.</p>\n<p>That's kind of a niche case. There are several ways to avoid it, fortunately, as I'd see it:</p>\n<p>A.) Don't do the Gett until everything is totally done and squared away.</p>\n<p>B.) Do the Gett after a legally-binding arbitration agreement is signed, so no one in their right mind will try to renege on it.</p>\n<p>C.) Just don't renege on the settlement! This letter isn't saying \"you can't do the Gett at this point\"; it's telling the unhappy ex to deal with the terms of the agreement. Once Rav Moshe told such a person to back down from their complaint, the Gett remained valid and everyone went their own way.</p>\n\n\n",

He would say that if that were\nso, that the verse intends to teach only that halakha, let the\nMerciful One write either: If he’akhol he’akhol, or: If ye’akhel\nye’akhel, repeating the same form of the word twice. What is the\nreason that the verse states “he’akhol ye’akhel,” employing both\nrepetition and variation? Learn from this formulation two halakhot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מאי האכל יאכל - מדשני קרא בדיבורא. שמעת מינה תרתי - למחשבת הקטרה\nבכזית ומחשבין מאכילה לאכילה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've seen this setup in a number of gemaras (see also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/2329/verb-its-infinitive\">verb + its infinitive</a>). Here Rashi says that the drasha, like any drasha, is based on a \"שינוי\": It could have just doubled the verb directly, so from the fact that the two verbs have different forms we can learn a drasha.<br />\nI don't know much grammar, but isn't this difficult? Am I wrong in thinking that there are hundreds of these doubled verbs in Tanach, and every single one has the same structure: first an infinitive form, then the regular verb. I think. If so, this is not the שינוי; doing it the other way with just a straight repetition would be a שינוי and a unique one.<br />\nDoes someone explain this, or is my understanding incorrect?</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Samuel Strashun is best known as a commentator on the Talmud. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Sharabi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shalom Sharabi</a> was an 18th Century post-Lurianic Kabbalist. Depending on whether you are in a Talmudic context or a Kabbalistic one usually one of those is usually called \"the Rashash.\"</p>\n<p>In some circles, Rashash can also refer to the eighteenth century Yemenite poet <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Shabazi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shalom Shabazi</a>. Finally, I have on occasion seen <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_Shkop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon Shkop</a> (19th-20th century talmudist) abbreviated in writing as Rashash, though I have never heard him called that in conversation.</p>\n<p>As for <em>\"I was told that there was one that lived a thousand years ago,\"</em> it would not shock me if there was some Rishon abbreviated Rashash (e.g., Rabbi Shimon of [some place starting with sin or shin]), but I am not aware of one and couldn't find one one Google.</p>\n<p>As for someone who invented kavanot used by the Arizal, it ssound like a confused description of Rav Sharabi, as BID points out in their answer. Rashash Sharabi was post-Arizal and built on his kabbalistic system. It's also possible the person you were speaking to mixed up the Rashash and Rashbi. Rashbi refers to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_bar_Yochai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai</a>, a rabbi in the Talmud later treated as a mystical figure and author of the Zohar.

He reads \"when you count them\" as implying that the counting itself was done via the coins, so as to avoid the issue of counting people altogether, which requires him to loosely define \"atonement\"as a sort of preventative measure.

The world was originally created in a state of perfection, but it was ruined by the sin of the Tree of Knowledge, which impacted not only Adam and Chava, but the entire world and all future generations. The Jews were <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.146a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">cleansed</a> of this contamination when they received the Torah at Sinai, but with the sin of the golden calf, they <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.88.292\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reverted</a> to a state of contamination at the community level, affecting even those who had no part in it, like the tribe of Levi and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.32.7.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshe</a> himself. That's why the half-shekel went specifically toward communal sacrifices (and why it was a fixed rate for everyone), because it was a communal atonement.</p>\n<p>But this is only skimming the surface of a classic topic in Chassidus.

So it isn't quite accurate to deem it a \"misinterpretation\" when Hazal deem it the furnace of the Kasdim (or fiery furnace of the Kasdim,אתון נורא דכשדאי, as found in Targum Yonathan Gen. 15:7 as pointed out by @Shmuel in the comments).</p>\n<p>Throughout the ages, various interpretations have arisen. For example, the (non-canonical) Book of Jubilees 11:3 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And 'Ûr, the son of Kesed, built the city of 'Ara of the Kasdim, and\ncalled its name after his own name and the name of his father. And\nthey made for themselves molten images, and they worshipped each the\nidol, the molten image which they had made for themselves, and they\nbegan to make graven images and unclean simulacra, and malignant\nspirits assisted and seduced (them) into committing transgression and\nuncleanness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, אוּר כַּשְׂדִּים is a compound name referring to its eponymous founder (אור) and his father (כשד).</p>\n<p>Don Isaac Abarbanel (Gen. 11:27) suggests the basis for the common translation (i.e. Land of the Chaldees) but also introduces additional possibilities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היותה מתישב בעניני אור כשדים שאינו ארץ כשדים אלא שם מקום בעבר הנהר ... והנה נקרא כן אור כשדים אם מפני ... שכבשוהו כשדיים כמו שכתב הר\"ן וכבר כתב הראב\"ע שפי' אור בקעה ...ויהיה ענין השם בקעת הכשדים שנתפשטו עדיו לשלול שלל ולבוז בז. ואם לסבת האש שנוסה בו אברהם במצות מלך כשדים. והיותר נכון הוא מה שכתבו חכמי האומות שהיו הכשדים במקום ההוא עובדים את האש ואת השמש המולך עליו ולכן קראוהו אור כשדים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Concerning reconciling the fact that Ur Kasdim is not actually in the land of the Kasdim [Chaldeans], rather it is the name of a place in Transeuphratia [‘ever ha-nahar]… it is called “Ur Kasdim” since the Chaldeans conquered it, as the Ran and Ibn Ezra explain, “ur” as region… and so the crux of naming it the region of the Chaldeans is that it was intended to disgrace and shame [the original inhabitants]. An additional reason may be because of the fire by which Abraham was tested by the king of the Chaldees. And what is more correct, is that which is written by the nations [i.e. gentile scholars], that the Chaldees in that place worshiped the Fire and the Sun which ruled over them, and they accordingly called it Ur Kasdim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A later interpretation that seems to synthesize the previous suggestions came from Isaac b. Menasseh (Conciliator, p. 57):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sons of those from whom Abram was descended inherited other territories; but what is more probable this Ur of the Chaldees (or Kasdim) was a city of Aram Naharaim, and derived its name from כשד Kesed, one of Nahor's sons, a descendant of Shem ; and although he was not then born, yet the Scripture, anticipating the future, gave it that name from the beginning, as speaking of the Hiddekel it states, \" that is it which goeth to the east of Assyria,\", at a time when the appellations of Assyrians and Assyria were unknown. אור \" Ur\" meaning in Hebrew fire ; it may likewise be said that Nimrod, the king of the Chaldeans, being the chief priest of fire worship, decreed that whoever would not serve it should be consumed by it ; and as Abram was thrown into it by virtue of this edict, it was called the Fire of the Chaldees,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To this day, scholars debate where אוּר כַּשְׂדִּים is and whether it corresponds to a known place. And there has been no settled conclusion as to the interpretation/translation of the name.

So we will not delve into them. The Torah did not need to write the birth place and ur kasdim, it could have written one or neither. In source 2 we need not to know where they were coming from as it is obvious from the previous verses where they were coming from. The words ur kasdim seems extra.\nThe Rabbinic explanation to these extra words is by understanding the extra story about Abrahm being thrown into a fire. Piriki Dr`Eliezer is a Mirdashic work and will understand the verses in a metaphysical way. Hence it will not even suggest that it is primarily referring to the physical place of Ur Cassdim.</p>\n\n\n",

He was popular with \"most\" of his brethren, not \"all\", indicating disapproval by the more observant Jews [Esther 10:3]. All this clearly reveals his left-wing sympathies.</p>\n<p>And his name...

For example, do Jews believe that \"sin\" is more accurately described as \"badness\" or \"brokenness\" - and moreover, do Jews believe that God's creation can \"become bad\" or is this not considered possible?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The sentence itself is indeed in past tense but Hebrew almost always omits the copula, so it would have no tense, so literally, He saw the light, that it good, or that it [\"be\"] good.</p>\n<p>However, consider the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>In the verse \"וירא מנוחה כי טוב\" (\"and he saw that rest was/is good\") the adjective doesn't agree with the noun's gender so it has more idiomatic rather than literal meaning.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When you scroll through other places in the Tanakh, sentences which are constructed in a similar manner (someone sees something that it is ...), the second part of the sentece can be either present or past tense (where there are verbs that conjugate), depending on context.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some languages are less strict about tenses i.e the verbs aren't conjugated to agree with tenses (or not as much). Therefore when translating to a language that gramatically requires tense, you can deduce the tense by context, but when absent, just understand it a \"vague\" tense.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The commentators both on the Mishneh Torah and on the Tur/Sh\"A cite the mishna <a href=\"https://mishna.alhatorah.org/Full/Shevuot/4.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shevuot 4:13</a> as the source:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַל יַכְּךָ, וִיבָרֶכְךָ, וְיֵיטִיב לְךָ, רַבִּי מֵאִיר מְחַיֵּב וַחֲכָמִים פּוֹטְרִין.</p>\n<p>If one says to the witnesses: God <strong>shall not strike you, or:</strong> God <strong>shall bless you, or:</strong> God <strong>shall benefit you</strong> if you come and testify, <strong>Rabbi Meir deems him liable,</strong> as one may infer from that statement that if he fails to testify God will strike him, or will not bless or benefit him. <strong>And the Rabbis deem him exempt</strong> because the curse is not explicitly stated. [translation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Shevuot.4.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria</a> with the usual caveats about interpolated explanations]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I don't see the two cases of indirect curses as equivalent. The mishna discusses positive statements, where the negative is inferred from them. However, the part left unspoken there isn't necessarily \"and may God strike/not bless/not benefit you if you don't come and testify\", but maybe \"I don't know what will happen if you don't come\". However, in the language given by Rambam, the indirect curse is explicitly negative.</p>\n<p>Is there anyone who distinguishes the two formulations, or explains why the two are the same? Even if they are equivalent, why does Rambam leave aside the formulation of the mishna in favour of the formulation he gives?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I guess according to these commentators on the Rambam's source, you have to say that the Rambam equated the <strong>lack of a negative event (אַל יַכְּךָ) to not compel a witness to testify</strong>, with <strong>the lack of a positive event (אל יברכהו י״י) to not be considered a curse</strong> - even though they are not the same thing.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> the Gr\"a on the Rambam (loc sit) raises your distinction (I didn't fully understand what he writes).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There is a concept known as מִכְּלָל לָאו אַתָּה שׁוֹמֵעַ הֵן, which is an obverse statement (מאמר המתהפך): \"from a negative statement we can infer a positive (וחילופו)\". This concept is brought in your Mishna Shevuot 4:13 by Bartenura to explain why Rabbi Meir holds him liable:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בכל אלו ר״מ מחייב, דמכלל לאו אתה שומע הן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's phrased very simply, and if we go to Nedarim 11a where this is discussed, we find that Rabbi Meir is the Tanna who <em>davka</em> <strong>doesn't</strong> hold that you can infer a negative from a positive. Obverse statements need to be made in full, by default, as it is a logical fallacy to <em>assume</em> the obverse or converse (חילוף) of a statement<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>However, if one follows through the <em>shak v'tariya</em> of the <em>sugya</em>, we find a couple of resolutions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לקרבן יהא, <strong>לפיכך</strong> לא אוכל לך (Rabbi Abbah)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והא דאמר ״<strong>לא לחולין</strong>״, דמשמע: לא ליהוי חולין אלא כקרבן (Rav Ashi)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>(which seems to relate to the mishna's  <strong>אַל יַכְּךָ</strong> - it's not clear if Bartenura is saying that Rebbi Meir <em>holds</em> by the principle or if this is one of the exceptions that he would agree with - the latter is more likely as that's what the gemara seems to be saying, but I welcome any suggestions on how exactly to understand this Bertenura)</sup></p>\n<p>Rambam, Tur, Maran and commentaries, may they be remembered for blessing, took all this into account.</p>\n<p><strong>Apparently, when it comes to very serious legal statements like vows and curses, we might be strict and worry about the obverse, and assume it.</strong></p>\n<p>So even though we only have the positive statement, the Rishonim and Acharonim knew all of the above, Rebbi Meir's position, the Rabbanan's position, the תבונות and הגיון and were confident to carry this over to other cases to rule if it applies.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - eg \"<em>All who may eat terumah may confer the right on others to eat terumah</em>\" doesn't necessarily imply that <em>all who may not eat terumah may not confer on others the right to eat terumah</em></sup></p>\n<hr />\n\n\n",

The best thing to do is to chose G-d and His Torah, since Torah is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">called good</a>. So \"good people\", according to this principle, are people that follow G-d ways, cling to Him and His Torah, and observe mitzvos.</p>\n<p>A Jewish perspective can be found in the commentary of the Ramchal. In Derech Hashem, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As we have discussed, humanity is the creature created for the purpose of drawing close to G-d. They are placed between perfection and deficiency, and it is in their hands to earn perfection. Humanity must earn this perfection, however, through their own desire and choice because if they were forced to choose perfection then they would not actually be its master, and G-d's purpose would not be fulfilled. It as therefore necessary to create humanity with free will. <strong>One's inclinations are therefore balanced between good and evil and they are not compelled toward either. They have the power of choice, able to choose either side knowingly and willingly, as well as to possess whichever one they wish. Humanity was therefore created with both a good urge and an evil urge. They have the power to incline in whichever direction they choose.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this view by the Ramchal, G-d provided us with both inclinations; we are the one to chose what to go after, our good or evil instincs (G-d forbid). If man was natural bad or good, that would do-away our free will, right?</p>\n<p>Since this is a Judaism-stackexchange, I would not add it into this answer, but I would recommend delving into the philosophical, theoratical debate between Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, it is a (secular) theory that describe man as either: natural good (according to Rousseau) and not natural good (according to Hobbs).</p>\n<p>Similary, the Hasagot HaRaavad <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hasagot_HaRaavad_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.5.5.1?ven=Mishnah_Torah,_Yod_ha-hazakah,_trans._by_Simon_Glazer,_1927&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and this very same is the power endowed to man to be either good or bad</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.5.1-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> similair:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Free will is granted to all men. If one desires to turn himself to the path of good and be righteous, the choice is his. Should he desire to turn to the path of evil and be wicked, the choice is his.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 1:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nittai the Arbelite used to say: keep a distance from an evil neighbor, do not become attached to the wicked, and do not abandon faith in [divine] retribution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam, in Hilchos De'os <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each and every human being has many dispositions, and each one is both very different and very distant from any other: One person may have a violent temper, always angry; but another's mind is at ease and he is never angry, or if he does feel anger it is a soft anger once in several years.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, as you wrote in one of the comments, a person might lean towards a specific character trait. That does not mean that he is unable to grow out of that trait, in order to be a better person. See also the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.1.7?lang=bi&with=Divrei%20Yirmiyahu&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Yirmiyahu</a> on the Rambam.</p>\n<p>We are meant to take on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.1.2?lang=bi&lookup=middle%20disposition&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">middle disposition</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.1.4?lang=bi&lookup=middle%20disposition&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as Rambam puts it</a>.  We are to walk in G-ds ways, as the Torah teaches in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 28:9</a>.</p>\n<p>So yes, a person has both good and bad inclinations, that is the way Hashem made us. We have good-will, we are meant to take care of ourselves and to attach ourselves to G-d, but we are free to do that, or not (G-d forbid). G-d does not force us into doing that.</p>\n<p>How does one train oneself to obtain a good character for instance? The Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">teaches</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By constant, repetitive practice of the actions [characteristic of] moderate dispositions and drilling over and over, constantly, until these actions are easy and are no longer a burden upon him. And [these] dispositions will [then] become fixed in his personality.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would recommend reading Tanya by the Alter Rebbe, regarding the subject of a  \"beinoni\". The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.61b.2?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> defines that as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to one’s inclinations, it was taught in a baraita that Rabbi Yosei HaGelili says: The good inclination rules the righteous, as it is stated: “And my heart is dead within me” (Psalms 109:22); the evil inclination has been completely banished from his heart. The evil inclination rules the wicked, as it is stated: “Transgression speaks to the wicked, there is no fear of God before his eyes” (Psalms 36:2). Middling people are ruled by both the good and evil inclinations, as it is stated: “Because He stands at the right hand of the needy, to save him from them that rule his soul” (Psalms 109:31).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm familiar with three different approaches,</p>\n<p>Raschar Hirsch (Bereshith 2) says that the human nature is neither good nor bad in itself, but rather blind - a structure of various forces and drives, that, by doing \"their thing\", <em>might</em> lead to positive results, but may as well lead also to sin.\nSo whilst passion, emotion, intellect, aren't to be \"fought\" against, since they are not intristically evil, they are rather not trustworthy, and only HaShem's commandment can <em>direct</em> them to the virtue; also being \"nice\" by default, that is, without the active intention to obey HaShem's will, isn't considered particularly virtuous, because by sticking to a predisposed nature a man serves merely himself.</p>\n<p>Rav Avraham Kook (Orot Hatora 11) talks about how a Jew should \"believe in his life\", believe in his feelings and senses that they lead him in a righteous path by nature, only that the Torah is there to help him to avoid some mistakes or delusions.</p>\n<p>The Tanya (based on מהרח\"ו so in that it's pretty much concensus amongst the Kabbalic schools) makes a distinction between the animalistic part and the divine part of the personality - the animalistic part is basically the entire personality, passions, emotions, intellect, drives, except the will to do HaShem's will which is the only thing that's divine,</p>\n<p>And also talks about the idea that everything that is not <em>divine</em> is naturally bad by definition by not being actively and conciously inline with HaShem's will.</p>\n<p>So that a person is both good and bad, bad by \"default\", good by divine consicence.</p>\n<p>Thus we have three completely different styles:</p>\n<p>Acc. to Tanya by actively fighting the animalistic nature a person could gain virtue (Tanya 27, 29), with the \"default\" personality (of the Benoni that is) as something that our sole purpose is to overcome, being insignificant, since not divine.</p>\n<p>Acc. to Rav Kook, on the contrary, we should strive to develop our intristically good intentions, whilst being aware of possible mistakes.</p>\n<p>Acc. to Rav Hirsch, we should approach our personality \"skeptically\", we should carefully try to \"fit\" it in the Torah, not destroy, not \"consecrate\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As pointed out, this is hard to answer without definitions.</p>\n<p>I wanted to highlight two points that had not been made yet:</p>\n<p>After Hashem created everything, culminating in the creation of Adam, the Torah says that the creation was \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.1.31?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">very good</a>\" (טוב מאד). The Ramban writes that some say that the \"very good\" actually refers to the evil inclination of man. He also cites Onkelos who translates very good as \"very orderly\" meaning that the order was very properly arranged since the evil is needed for the preservation of the good. He also cites Bereishit Rabba saying that on account of the superiority of man the Torah adds the phrase \"very good\".</p>\n<p>From this we may conclude that we inherently have both good and evil within us, at least an inclination to both.</p>\n<p>Another relevant source that wasn't mentioned in other responses is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.8.21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 8:21</a> following when Cain killed Hevel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּ֣רַח יְהֹוָה֮ אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־לִבּ֗וֹ לֹֽא־אֹ֠סִ֠ף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּעֲב֣וּר הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו וְלֹֽא־אֹסִ֥ף ע֛וֹד לְהַכּ֥וֹת אֶת־כׇּל־חַ֖י כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי׃</p>\n<p>יהוה smelled the pleasing odor, and יהוה resolved: “Never again will I doom the earth because of humankind, <strong>since the devisings of the human mind are evil from youth</strong>; nor will I ever again destroy every living being, as I have done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This implies that a person may be evil from the outset. However, Rashi merely says that from birth a person is given an evil inclination, possibly implying that the good inclination is already within him/her.</p>\n\n\n",

Malbim proceeds and explains that Amalek attacked for two reasons: Hatred of Hashem and hatred of the descendants of Yaakov.</p>\n<p>Why doesn't Malbim list looting and plundering as a reason for war? After all, Yisrael left Egypt rich and were even more so after Yam Suf, and a group short on supplies and wealth could benefit greatly from attacking them. Perhaps that is why Amalek attacked Yisrael, or at least one of the reasons.</p>\n\n\n",

Those discussions put a lot of focus on our Serving Gods of Wood and Stone. We know however, that the inclination for Idol-worship was more or less destroyed before the destruction of the Second B\"H, and obviously Idol Worship does not play a central role in our sins of today. What the was the Torah so busy with in predicting? Was it referring to Galus Bavel? Or was it simply a non-essential example of ways in which Jews may rebel against God in the future?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/61430/31534\">this answer</a> by ray, the Yeitzer Hara of idolatory wasn't exactly destroyed, but transformed. How this modifies the halachic considerations of idol worship is another discussion, but the principles carry forward.</p>\n<p>Let's get to the root of what idolatry is and see if it can still apply post the \"pagan\" days of worshiping personified deities.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Devarim 5:7,9) \"Thou shalt have no other gods before me….Do not bow\ndown to them and do not worship them, for I, the Lord thy God, am a\njealous God\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having another \"god\" before Him means we give some or all of our service that should be for Hashem to something else, which includes faith, trust, devotion and loyalty, to a god who cannot save, אל־אל לא יושיע (Yishaya 45:20). This is most keenly felt in the term \"I am a jealous God\". This type of jealousy, <em>kinna</em>, is akin to a husband who suspects his wife of cheating on him (see Bamidbar 5:12,14). The sense of repugnance at betrayal is a theme.</p>\n<p>Putting our faith and trust in a \"false god\" is particularly egregious, and Hashem's criticism of \"you worship the work of your hands\" rings loud - why are you worshipping something that is inferior to you? Hashem has placed us in a world with angels above us, and animals below us, and gives us the ability to rise or fall towards either with our unique free will. The only way to rise is to worship that which is greater than us, and that is only Hashem. When we are devoted and loyal to Hashem, we adore Him (literally worship - we say He's absolutely perfect in every way!), and do our best to strive to emulate Him, then we are doing what we were created to do, and going in the direction He needs us to go.</p>\n<p>As Rambam lays out in the first perek of Hilchot Avodah Zara, by creating a god that cannot speak or have a will, and dedicating oneself to it, one has to build lie upon lie in order to maintain that. Whether it be a literal idol made by ones hands, or anything man made that we put our faith into, it's all the same. We end up really just worshiping our own opinion, and more and more urgently defending it with rationalization and lie after lie.</p>\n<p>Another point I've heard: It's not even worship. The <em>worship</em> is also false. It's more <em>recklessness</em>. Putting one's faith into something that cannot save is not real worship.</p>\n<p>So can this apply today? In the way it's been explained here, yes of course - see the sources in ray's answer, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y10_zwyGd0o\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this set of shiurim</a> for example. Study the links in Shmuel's comments in the OP. It is just as poignant and dangerous as ever - perhaps more so because we find it much harder to spot! One can put one's trust and faith in one's money, in one's deservedness and entitlement, in a foreign ideology, in a government or even a celebrity. We can feel like that's what we want to dedicate our strength to, put our trust that this is how the world will be saved, and identify ourselves as one of its adherents and followers.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that it is often discussed that all our idols have let us down. We are getting desperate and it seems that many people are now saying <em>nothing</em> can be trusted, so they only trust themselves. \"Whatever my opinion is, is right and the only thing I can trust\". Worshipping the self is the quintessential form of idolatry. Even that idol either needs to be relinquished, or it needs to be smashed.</p>\n<p>It's scary, if I can't trust myself, then who can I trust? If I am not to dedicate my heart, my mind, my deeds, my words, my thoughts, my body, my soul to myself, then who should I dedicate these to? The answer is the same answer as it's always been: trust Hashem, dedicate oneself b'mesirat nefesh to Hashem. He gave us a Torah and it tells us what to do: focus on the 613 mitzvot and all halacha with complete abandon; one will then be guaranteed to be going only upwards, doing the only right thing to do, fulfilling one's true purpose, and fixing the whole world. One will be blessed and protected and be given a portion of Hashem Himself, and indeed be connecting to one's true self, free of all falsehood and lie, all desperation and trap.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Rediscovered Torah Scroll in the times of King Yoshiyahu\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The following question was asked here a bunch of years ago, however it wasn't treated with any great sources or analysis, so here I am attempting to give the topic another shot. In Melachim 2, 22: and Divrei Hayamim 2, 34: We learn about how Chilkiyahu discovered a Scroll. It was quickly discovered that his scroll was the written by the hand of Moses. Rashi says it was Sefer Devarim. Many other commentaries say it was the entire Torah. There is another opinion that it was just a small part of the Torah (which includes the Curses) in a scroll designated for the King of Israel. Either way, the story seems difficult to understand exactly. The Radak is of the opinion that the Torah was forgotten from Klal Yisroel. From a historical perspective, it seems quite difficult to even propose that this means that this means all aspects of the Torah. It seems that according to the Radak's understanding, all of the Torah was warped on a fundamental level, in a way that removes all connection to a Monotheistic message. The Rashba in his tshuvos also deals with this question, albeit asked differently. In his case he's responding to a challenge from a Muslim trying to prove from the story that the Oral Tradition of Chazal is fabricated. After much personal analysis of the topic, it's clear to me that no matter how one understands it, the only framework in which the entire episode makes any sense, in one in which there was always some sort of body of people that clung (possibly in secret) to the true tradition of the Torah. These Sages never lost anything, however they were shunned and possibly persecuted by the rest of the society. King Yoshiyahu saw through the lies of the society and although he wasn't so knowledgeable, he wished to live in accordance with the Torah of the few great people left in the group of righteous Torah Followers. That's why he began to try clearing out some of the foreign altars. Obviously though, fighting against a rebellious society is a daunting task, and until he was presented with the Scroll opened to the verse \"Vehashem yolech eschem...\" He became invigorated and inspired with courage and began a full-fledged national return to God. This is truly the most rational way to understand the story. With all this being said, I feel that there still remains a big question. The fact of the matter is, that the acknowledgement of such an event seems to leave open some room to claim that although this is the Navi's representation of the story, the truth is that our version of Judaism was indeed only first introduced at that point. There are many sources that discuss the following, but one thorough and early source, namely the Sefer Hachinuch, literally spends his entire Introduction speaking about how the fact that we have a national testimony claiming to be an unbroken chain back to Matan Torah, is an incredibly important and strong fact of evidence for our religions claims to authenticity. So yes, even though his point still holds quite strong according to the simple understanding of the event (meaning, there was still a decent following to the original tradition of Torah who continued the chain.) Still, what's a little disturbing is that the story seems to allow room for one to say that in truth there was no tradition whatsoever, and it was simply the later reforming generations that created that narrative. In line with this, one can defend such a possible creation of a new religion by pointing out how the King forced everyone to agree to his new rules as described in the later verses in the above-mentioned books of Nach. Also, the one claiming this argument can maybe explain away all of the irrationalities between such an approach and the narrative of Nach, as mere consequences of a made-up story, and thus according to them the Nach wouldn't even necessarily be implying the existence of a group of Torah steadfast Torah followers. So anyway, my question to you all is, what would you answer to such a challenge to the veracity of our tradition?</p>\n<p>For the sake of extra clarity, the reason I say one must understand the story in the framework of the existence of a group of persevering Torah Scholars and followers, is not due to this very question regarding how the Torah was legitimately accepted and it's intricacies subsequently known to all, but rather in terms of the small details of the story making sense in itself, I believe that' the only way to make rational sense of it. However, like I said at the end of the previous paragraph, one might argue that all of the small irrationalities and inconsistencies of the story in tself don't point to any ultimate unifying interpretation, but rather represent the fact that the story in fact doesn't make sense in reality and instead was a non-sensical twisting of the truth of what happened.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Yosef Albo in his famous sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaIkkarim%2C_Maamar_3.22.1?ven=Sefer_Ha-ikkarim,_Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America,_1929&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkkarim (Maamar 3:22:1)</a> explains this at great length. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah which we have to-day and which has been handed down to us by unbroken tradition from father to son is the same that was given to Moses on Sinai, without any change. It could not have received change in the time of the first temple when the priests and teachers were in the temple and the Torah was well known to everybody. And though there were among them kings who worshipped idols, they also had prophets during the entire period until the time of the destruction, who admonished the people to observe the Torah. <strong>And as for the great alarm which Josiah felt when the priest Hilkiah found a book of the Torah in the house of the Lord, this does not signify that they had no copy of the Torah, for Jeremiah was alive then.</strong> But the reason was this. Amon and Menasseh were worshippers of idols and offended God, so much so that our Rabbis say, Menasseh cut the names of God out of the Torah and substituted names of idols in their place. Accordingly one of the priests who feared that the king might do the same with the original copy of the Torah which Moses wrote, if it got into his hands, hid it in the walls of the building. Later, in the days of Josiah, who returned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul and with all his might in accordance with the law of Moses, they looked for this book and could not find it. And when they repaired the temple, Hilkiah found it in the wall and was very much elated over it, as if he had found a great treasure. He then sent a message to the king, saying, I have found the book of the Law, the well known book which Moses wrote; he did not say I found a book of the law. Now the reason that king Josiah was so alarmed at the find and rent his garments when he heard the words of the book, is as our Rabbis explain in the Jerusalem Talmud. The Torah which Moses wrote was rolled up so that it opened on the beginning of Genesis, whereas the manuscript which they found opened on the verse in Deuteronomy: “The Lord will bring thee, and thy king whom thou shalt set over thee, unto a nation that thou hast not known. .” This is the reason why the king was alarmed, and not because the people had forgotten the Torah, God forbid!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Albo explains that Amon and Menasseh were worshippers of idols, they replaced the name of G-d for names of idols they worshipped, in the scrolls of Torah. He explains that one of the priests wanted to prevent that, and hid the orginal scroll that was written by Moshe Rabbeinu in a wall, that scroll was founded later on, in the story you mentioned. This does however, not mean that there was no tradition before that finding. The mesorah was intact, as Rav Yosef Albo explains.</p>\n\n\n",

In that very gemara a story is told. A story by our blessed sages is not the same as a regular story. It's like a mirror, in it you will see yourself. You can find the full story there, please read it before reading my summary, which focusses on your point.</p>\n<p>The gemara is discussing if the Gibeonites are genuine converts or not, for some halachic issue pertaining to Yibbum. Rabbi Chana Bar Adda brings a proof that they are not, from the following story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Once, there was a famine in the land of Israel under King David. David inquired if it was due to idol worship but they could not find\nany. The next year again a famine, so David checked if it was to do\nwith sexual misconduct, but couldn't find any. In the third year of\nfamine, he checked if it was due to people pretending to give charity\nin public but not actually in private, but again, couldn't find any,\nso he took the blame himself.</em></p>\n<p><em>He inquired of the urim v'tumim, and was told that the Gibeonites had a greivance with him. “And the Lord said: It is for Saul, and for his\nbloody house, because he put to death the Gibeonites”. Saul wasn't\neulogized properly and that's why the Jews are suffering, and the\nGibeonites had a claim against something Saul did, which needed to be\nresolved.</em></p>\n<p><em>What did he do? Once when David was fleeing from him, David passed through the Jewish city of Nov, who took care of him. This was a\ntreasonous act and when King Saul found out, he ordered the sacking of\nNov. Nov happened to be a city that was providing food and water for\nthe Gibeonites, so therefore they had a grievance against Saul.</em></p>\n<p><em>So King David summoned the Gibeonites to see if he could appease them. He apologised and asked what he could do, and their answer\nshocked him and everyone else: they demanded 7 descendants of Saul be\nhanded over to them to be hanged! After trying to talk them out of it,\nKing David finally declared that they can't be true converts, as they\nclearly are lacking the three traits of kindness, rachmanus and\nshame.</em></p>\n<p><em>So they arranged for the descendants of Saul to be brought before the Ark, and the Ark held back those to be handed over, who were then\nhanged. They remained hanged for 1 year before burial, and the gemara\ndiscusses that this, clearly being against halacha, was necessary for\n\"the greater good\", because it was a kiddush Hashem - all who saw\nthose bodies knew that the Jewish nation and Hashem's Torah were\ndifferent to the other nations and their conduct, because for the sake\nof \"calculating converts\" they hold even their nobility accountable,\nand as a result 150,000 people converted.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the reader has the three traits, this story will prove it to them. The feeling of shock at the cruelty of the Gibeonites and their demands evokes one's mercy. The feeling of desperation and shame that is evoked picturing the scene of passing the descendants of Saul before the Ark to choose who lives and who dies. The triggering of one's trait of kindness, hearing that their bodies were not buried for 1 year...</p>\n<p>The gemara itself brings the sources for all 3 traits:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>David said: There are three distinguishing marks of this nation, the\nJewish people. They are merciful, they are shamefaced, and they\nperform acts of kindness. <strong>They are merciful, as it is written:</strong> “And He\nwill give you mercy, and have mercy upon you and multiply you”\n(Deuteronomy 13:18); not only will God have mercy upon you, but He\nwill bestow the attribute of mercy upon you. <strong>They are shamefaced, as\nit is written:</strong> “And that His fear shall be upon your faces” (Exodus\n20:17), and the fear that is on one’s face is his shame. <strong>They perform\nacts of kindness, as it is written:</strong> “For I have known him, to the end\nthat he may command his children and his household after him, that\nthey may keep the way of the Lord, to practice righteousness and\njustice” (Genesis 18:19), i.e., to perform acts of kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It doesn't matter if they are Jewish or not Jewish<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>If they are under the age of 11 then we find a difference in halacha. By girls under the age of 11 who are Jewish, one would be permitted to enjoy her beauty (but obviously not have lustful thoughts), whereas by a non-Jewish girl, this would still be forbidden as she is still considered an \"erva\" i.e. someone he is not permitted to marry.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p>In general, one has other mitzvot and obligations towards a Jewess that one wouldn't have towards a non-Jew, including the mitzva of Ahavat Yisrael, Lifnei  Iver etc. By gazing at a woman, one is being disrespectful, as well as causing a challenge in heaven against her. One is increasing promiscuity in our nation.</p>\n<p>It's therefore not clear if it is worse or better, one shouldn't worry too much about that. One should make every effort to guard one's eyes. By doing so, one will bring bracha to himself and the world, instead of curses, and the reward is very great.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/125930/is-it-a-sin-to-watch-a-naked-woman/133563#133563\">this answer</a> for sources and details.<br />\n2 - There is a concept of \"erva\" by non-Jews, see SH EH 21:1<br />\n3 - See footnote 13 of pp.22 in Lift Up Your Eyes by R' S Wagshal for full discussion and explanation</sup></p>\n\n\n",

We have the ability to do mitzvot, and by doing mitzvot Hashem turns his attention to us as individuals. This is what is meant when we say Hashem turns his face to us. Not that Hashem has a physical face, but he is giving us individual attention to make sure the chaotic laws of nature bring no harm to us. On the other hand, when we sin Hashem turns his face away from us and we are susceptible to random harm.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.37.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Guide of the perplexed 1:37</a> ו׳פנים׳ גם כן שם ההזהר וההשגחה ״לא\nתשא פני דל״, ״ונשוא פנים״, ״אשר לא ישא פנים״ – וזה הרבה. ולפי זה הענין\nגם כן נאמר: ״ישא יי פניו אליך וישם לך שלום״ – רצונו לומר: הלוות ההשגחה\nבנו.

And while I can think of very many halakhot that I would agree are sins if broken, there are also lots of caveats and nuance that make me think it's not so straight forward. As someone pointed out in the comments below, breaking Shabbat is a sin unless you are doing it to save a life.</p>\n<p>The Torah has many categories of sin, and depending on what law you break or how you break it determines what kind of sin it is. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pesha (deliberate sin; in modern Hebrew: crime) or Mered (lit.:\nrebellion) - An intentional sin; an action committed in deliberate\ndefiance of God; (Strong's Concordance :H6588 (פשע pesha', peh'shah).\nAccording to Strong it comes from the root (:H6586); rebellion,\ntransgression, trespass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Awon (lit.: iniquity) - This is a sin of lust\nor uncontrollable emotion. It is a sin done knowingly, but not done to\ndefy God; (Strong's Concordance :H5771 (avon, aw-vone). According to\nStrong it comes from the root (:H5753); meaning perversity, moral\nevil:--fault, iniquity, mischief.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cheit - This is an unintentional\nsin, crime or fault. (Strong's Concordance :H2399 (חַטָּא chate).\nAccording to Strong it comes from the root khaw-taw (:H2398, H2403)\nmeaning \"to miss, to err from the mark (speaking of an archer), to\nsin, to stumble.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do these same sin categories exist with violating different kinds of halakhot? Or is it a matter of how you break the halakha that determines it's sin category?</p>\n<p>And what about halakhot that don't seem to be moral in nature. If one puts on his shoe on the wrong foot first, has he sinned to the point that God will judge against them for it? If they put on shoes wrong every day for their life does that mean they will have thousands of sins racked against them on judgment day?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Without diving into complex semantics, let's simplify the questions:</p>\n<p>A. does the severity of an act depend on its substantivity (actus reus), or intention (mens rea).</p>\n<p>B. why some acts that have no apparent moral implications may be considered penal sins.</p>\n<p>To put it even more simply: how do we quanity the vice and virtue of an act, and why.</p>\n<p>///</p>\n<p>First of all we need to clarify - <em>whom</em> are we asking?</p>\n<p>Are we asking the opinion of secular legal systems, our personal opinion, the opinion of other religions - or, the opinion of Judaism?</p>\n<p>Then, before asking \"how is that even possible to say so\", let's first understand what exactly is being said, and address the personal dissonance later on.</p>\n<p>Assuming that we are curious to know the opinion of Judaism, we may not base the answer on any other apriori pressumptions other the ones that Judaism itself provides us.</p>\n<p>So: <em>how</em> do we quantify vice and virtue?</p>\n<p>Looking at the Jewish penal code we can observe that every act consists of a combination of substantivity (actus reus) and intention (mens rea).</p>\n<p>Some laws hold more \"substantive\" value, e.g, doing Melacha on Shabbath is worse than murder, which is worse than eating pork, which is worse than not wearing Tefillin, which is worse than breaching דרבנן laws, which is worse than putting your shoes on in the wrong order, assuming the same level of intention.</p>\n<p>Likewise the intentive value can either nulify the vice (\"מתעסק\") or increase it (מזיד לתיאבון, מזיד להכעיס).</p>\n<p>However, we have to keep in mind that this is only from a legal point of view, that can only be based on objective measurements.</p>\n<p>The actual \"amount\" of vice and virtue depends on additional variables, such as environment, knowledge (or lack thereof), spiritual level, mental state, etc.</p>\n<p>///</p>\n<p>And now the second part: why are some acts virtuous or vicious acc. to Judaism?</p>\n<p>There are two main approaches to that question - instrumental and intrinsic.</p>\n<p>Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim explains man's purpose as understanding the truth, and the commandments serve as essential instruments to achieving that goal.</p>\n<p>Some Hassidic writers (e.g Yesod Ha'Avoda) view man's purpose as developing love or reverence to HaShem, and commandments as instrumental.</p>\n<p>So morality, good and evil, are all based on the question - does it bring us closer to our purpose, or move us further?</p>\n<p>Nefesh HaChaim on the other hand point out the \"opus operatum\" nature of the commandments. Just by performing a prescribed act, with the right intention, you automatically gain virtue and have spiritual influence on the world / other realms, and the physical, emotional, mental effect of the act is of second importance. Thus, it doesn't matter at all how you feel toward tying your shoes, but rather the mystic effect thereof.</p>\n<p>As Raschar Hirsch in 19 letters points out, both schools of thought have their weaknesses:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>how does a certain purpose (even if not arbitrary), like love or attaining knowledge, imply 613 commandments? What does it have to do with tying shoes? But any attempt to \"cut off\" any commandment, even if rationally appealing, could be called Christianity, Reform, but not Judaism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>where in the Torah does it say that commandments are mystic amulets, that have nothing to do with actual life?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He himself offers another approach, a more \"holistic\" idea of virtue, that is explaining how the commandments are not merely mystic, but actually humane and moral, and not only opus operatum, but have the purpose of bringing humanity to a virtuous path.</p>\n<p>So as for the question why, you won't have a straightforward answer. Arguably all of the above are true in a way, but you might get a fuller understanding by studying Tanakh / Talmud / Midrash / Zohar.</p>\n<p>///</p>\n<p>Lastly we shall address the personal dissonnance.</p>\n<p>The dissonnace is a contradiction between our view and the view we are looking into. The question \"how is that possible\" is merely an emotional expression, but we already know the dissonnance exists.</p>\n<p>So, knowing the opinion of Judaism, instead of asking \"how is that possible\", let's ask ourselves, what are is our own opinion?</p>\n<p>Do we have conservative or liberal predispositions? Do we value equality, freedom, feminism, rationalism, or nationalism, romanticism, traditions?</p>\n<p>What is our own idea of vice and virtue? Do acts have intrinsic value, or instrumental value? And if we don't have a clear sense of good and bad, how can we judge those who do?</p>\n<p>Next, how did we acquire such views? Is our opinion trustworthy?</p>\n<p>Contemporary western socities value freedom.</p>\n<p>Now, if freedom is thought to have intrinsic value, we might inquire, where from did it acquire such value? Arbitration?</p>\n<p>If it has instrumental value, then what its purpose? Achieving happiness? Then, where did happiness acquire its value? Arbitration?</p>\n<p>Marcus Aurelius in Meditations 2 10 quotes Theophraktus, who says that crimes committed out of passion are more shameful than crimes committed out of anger, and provides his reasoning for it. But how is he so sure?</p>\n<p>Tying shoes correctly surely doesn't have any intrinsic value in the eyes of western morality, and doesn't serve as an instrument to achieve any of its goals (well-being, pleasure, whatever that is), and thus meaningless.</p>\n<p>But in the eyes of Judaism - isn't it a reminder to remember HaShem whenever you go outside for your business? Isn't it an ancient tradition of the nation of Israel? Doesn't it have some mystic value? And by favouring the own opinion - isn't it equal to saying that one trusts and serves only his intuition, and is not willing to bow down before HaShem's Will?</p>\n\n\n",

If he hears a shofar sound coming back, that means that whatever's inside can come out. The reason being that only Jewish demons would answer a shofar call with another shofar call, and it's okay to allow Jewish demons to roam free, as they are meant to fulfill Hashem's commands. So if one were to come upon Pandora's pithos, one should do the shofar-check. If one hears the shofar, it would be okay to open the pithos, or even destroy it - anything to free the Jewish demons inside.</p>\n<p>But what if you don't hear a shofar answering you, i.e., that the evil entities inside aren't Jewish?</p>\n<p>There are two options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first option is to only slightly damage the pithos on one of its ear-like handles, which according to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Avodah_Zarah.4.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishna in Avodah Zara 4:5</a> is enough of an iconoclastic act to deface the idolatrous object.</li>\n<li>If for some reason there is need to destroy the whole Pandorian pithos, or else the evil entities have already begun escaping, you still have your trusty shofar with you, which is an excellent, tried-and-tested tool for banishing unwanted sorts (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.107b.13?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 107b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Moed_Katan.16a.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Katan 16a</a>).

This behaviour surprised God; and he asked what was the cause of this his procedure; and why he, that before delighted in that conversation, did now fly from it, and avoid it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and are looking for a rabbinic \"source.\" But our rabbinic sources--especially aggadic midrashim--were redacted well after Josephus wrote his works at the end of the 1st century CE. At best, you might find rabbinic sources reflecting the same tradition or idea. But Josephus also often records stories and detail we do not have other sources for, perhaps because they reflect lost traditions or because they are non-canonical \"street Torah.\"</p>\n<p>However, many of these elements are found in at least some rabbinic sources. In Bereshit Rabbah 19:9, Hashem laments the fall of man. The text links the word \"ayeka\" (where are you) to \"eikh heveit\" (roughly, what has happened to you!) and to \"eicha\" (the first word of Lamentations, which has the same implication of sad shock: <em>how [has it happened]</em>). In elaborating, the midrash says God was commenting on both the fact that man has become disgraced and that man has become distant from Hashem. The key phrase I'm thinking of is: אֶתְמוֹל לְדַעְתִּי, וְעַכְשָׁיו לְדַעְתּוֹ שֶׁל נָחָשׁ - roughly, yesterday Adam was was in accord with me, today he is in accord with the Serpent.</p>\n<p>The Etz Yosef explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אתמול לדעתי התבונן איך נפלת ממדרגתך. כי בתחלה לא היה בך כח הרע מאומה ונמשכת לדעתי ורצוני. והיום לדעתו וחפצו של נחש לכח הרע ואתמול הכוונה כמו קודם ותחלה: Translation: <em>God is reflecting on how much you have fallen. At first, there was no evil in you and you sought to know me and do my will. Today, you do what the Serpent wants for evil...</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bereshit Rabbah 21:4 has a similar statement and the Etz Yosef makes a similar comment.</p>\n<p>In Sanhedrin 38b we find: ואמר רב יהודה אמר רב אדם הראשון מין היה שנאמר  ויקרא ה' אלהים אל האדם ויאמר לו איכה אן נטה לבך. <em>Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav, Adam was a heretic. Because the verse says God called out to man and said \"where are you\" (ayeka), meaning where has your heart turned to</em>.</p>\n<p>As for the element of surprise that man has turned away and hidden, Sforno to 3:9 comments that \"ayeka\" is not a question of where man is but is asking (or observing) \"that you do not appear in the garden as you used to, because now you are hiding and you did not do that before.\"</p>\n<p>So, putting these sources together, we have most of the elements of your OP and the Josephus passage: God is surprised that man is hiding from him which is not what he used to do (Sforno); God is disappointed about the fall of man (Bereshit Rabbah); and God laments that that man used to want be be close to Him and/or listen to Him but has now gone in a different direction (Bereishit Rabbah & Sanhedrin). The only elements I'm not seeing are (a) anthropomorphizing that God misses Adam (which I don't see in the Josephus quote either) and (b) the specific idea that Adam used to \"delight\" in talking to God.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>FOUND IT.

    "content": "# What Came First, the Torah or the Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is apparently an age old debate, and <em>really is a question about what is primary</em>; more important. The midrash (Tanna D'Bei Eliyahu Rabbah, ch. 14. See also Bereshit Rabbah 1:4) asks this question:</p>\n<p>\"Torah and the Jewish people both preceded creation. But which of the two came first?\"</p>\n<p>It then concludes that the Jewish people came first as the Torah is addressed to them. This is an argument from logic, and we have no \"shema mina\", so apparently the Midrash isn't definitive, which is another way of saying \"we will debate this until the end\".</p>\n<p>Clearly this is true. Maybe the first recorded debate on this issue is between Esther and Mordechai. Esther asks Mordechai to call a fast to nullify the decree of destruction that was taking place through Haman. Mordechai was arguing that this can't be done because it would be on the first night of Pesach and therefore we wouldn't be able to hold a Seder. Esther won the argument by saying \"if there are no Jewish people, then who will keep future sedarim?\" (Esther Rabbah 8:7). Hashem didn't say \"if I can't have sedarim, I don't want Jews\", but rather \"if I can't have Jews, then I don't want sedarim\". But it's not water tight, as this might imply that the argument to save the Jews is contingent on the fact that there might be future sedarim! Also, it's not clear how we should take this down to the individual level (as it is a story of the <em>entire Jewish people</em>, and there are plenty of ways to argue that if a Jew doesn't keep Mitzvot, the Torah has some not nice things to say about him...)</p>\n<p>I would like to ask, <strong>have we reached any consensus on this yet</strong>? It seems on the surface that this might, for example, be at the heart of the old <em>chassidic</em>/<em>misnagdic</em> battles, with one side placing the Jew as primary, and halacha as secondary, and visa versa. It might be at the heart of different kiruv movements, with one side trying to \"bring Jews to mitzvot\" and one side trying to \"bring mitzvot to Jews\". It seems important in deciding how we should treat Jews who do not keep halacha and mitzvot, either with love or scorn or something in between.</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe would take a side on this. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKjhp8_A7TY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He would teach</a> that the Talmud explains that in the first of the Ten Commandments, \"I am Hashem your God...,\" the word \"I -- Anochi\" forms an acronym: \"I inscribed My soul and gave it over.\" This means that Hashem Himself invested His very essence into the words of  His Torah. Nevertheless, the Jewish people are higher in His mind (His inner will), even than Torah. Are there any other gedolim who make arguments in this vein either way?</p>\n<p><strong>So who holds what, and more importantly, what are the nafka minas (the practical differences) of this point?</strong></p>\n<p>Note: clearly both are vitally important (which is why we are debating it until this day) so I don't want to see this used as an opportunity to argue against the importance of either.</p>\n\n\n",

The\nRamban (Shemot 22:27) and Sefer Hachinuch (Mitzvah 71), in explaining\nthe prohibition of cursing a leader, write that the Torah forbids\ncursing any national leader, be he from the political authority or\nfrom the Torah authority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we look at Sefer HaChinuch 71, it seems this is just limited to Torah leaders, not secular political leaders.</p>\n<p>Either way, it seems rebelling against even political authorities is a very grave matter! Criticising is not the same as rebelling though, neither is it the same as cursing.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If someone deliberately changes the words of a blessing, do they get credit?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am aware that in the Talmud somewhere (but not where), there is a discussion of saying a blessing with the words changed. The conclusion is that as long as the \"core\" of the blessing or the central meaning is unchanged, the person praying still gets at least partial credit for having said the blessing.</p>\n<p>My chabrusa and I disagreed on the precise meaning and implications of this. I said that this provided for groups such as the reform and reconstructionist movement to change the words of blessings without losing all credit for doing so. He argued that the rabbis' statement only accounts for <em>unintentional</em> word changes, such as if you say the wrong word by accident.</p>\n<p>As an example, let us consider the gevurah prayer of the Shemoneh Esrei, where it is typical in the reform movement to replace המתים (the dead) with הכול (all). I would say that it is preferable to say המתים, but saying הכול still gets you \"partial credit\", as it were, because the core of the blessing, of Hashem being our support and rock who refreshes us and the world, remains. My chabrusa, on the other hand, would say that since they changed the word on purpose and it wasn't misremembering or misreading the blessing, no credit is given to someone saying the gevurah prayer with this change. [Note: Just before I submitted I realized that this may not be a good example, because someone could say \"the core of the prayer is the resurrection of the dead, which is not intact with this word change, so even if the rabbis did refer to intentional changes, this particular change wouldn't be accepted. I don't have any other examples off the top of my head, though, so please answer with the assumption that any word change under discussion preserves the central meaning of the blessing in question.]</p>\n<p>Which of us is correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Talmud says that \"we may not alter the coin that the Sages have minted -- En lecha reshut l'hosif 'al matbea' shetav'u chachamim bivrachot\" [Berachot Y 86a]. This means that the prayers and blessings in the siddur may not be changed.</p>\n\n\n",

Things that can usually be eaten with bread e.g eggs vegetables are considered no doubt \"באים מחמת הסעודה\". Apples grapes etc. are practically never eaten with bread so they need their own bracha.</p>\n<p>As for certain foods that used to be eaten with bread but nowadays not as much (bananas for example), it's a good question.</p>\n<p>As for the role of bircath hamotzi, the Torah gave importance to certain foods e.g bread wine shiv'at haminim, for spiritual and/or symbolic reasons. We could investigate the meaning thereof but must accept it as apriori knowledge - not to come to new conclusions based on our assupmtions.</p>\n<p>Consider this theory:</p>\n<p>The Torah is well aware that people in different times and cultures eat different food, and despite of that chose certain foods to be important.</p>\n<p>Bread is plant-based, processed food - on one hand the core matter is given by HaShem, on the other hand it requires immense human intervention to sow, reap, process, etc.; it requires immense effort to acquire (\"לחם\" similar to \"מלחמה\"); whilst animals may eat meat, fruit, the Midrash says that Adam asked HaShem to make his food different from that of other animals, and was thus given bread; it symbolises agriculture, civilisation, as opposed to hunter-gatherer lifestyle;</p>\n<p>Throughout the Torah \"eating bread\" idiomatically means \"having a meal\". \"לחם\" means bread, but also the general notion of food (you can check the corcondance);</p>\n<p>Therefore, unlike other foods, bread can represent other types of food, which are of lesser importance, that is if they have some connection to it - can be eaten together, as part of a meal - but not if they are completely unrelated, like sweet fruit or candy, or not part of the meal.</p>\n<p>This is merely a hypothesis, although it could be further developed, the main point is that understanding this halacha as merely based on bread's popularity in the middle east 2000 years ago, is most likely not the sole explanation, and thus halacha shouldn't be changed acc. to this theory, as much as it shouldn't be changed acc. to any more elaborate theory.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I think there is a misunderstanding either by me or you.</p>\n<p>Well there are debates about ice cream is it eaten with a meal or not, is it dessert or not, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Halachos of Brachos (chap 5 , pg 87) quoting Rav Shlomo Zalman, Vezot\nHaBracha (chap 8, pg 74 note 8) quoting Rav Elyashiv and Rav Pinchas\nSheinburg, and Shevet HaLevi 1:205:174 all hold that ice cream in a\nmeal requires a bracha since it is clearly a snack. However, Vezot\nHabracha (chap 8, pg 74 note 8) quotes Rav Moshe Feinstein as holding\nthat no bracha is made on ice cream as dessert in a meal. Similarly,\nVayishma Moshe v. 2 p. 79 quoting Rav Elyashiv writes that dessert\ndoesn't require a bracha since it is commonly brought at the end of\nthe meal. However, it is better to eat them with a little bread to\nexempt them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But many people eat fish, meat, etc.. with bread. Just because one person does not does not invalidate the mechanics of the Beracha. We say \"Battul Dato Esel Kol Adam\" that his opinion is invalidated by others. So Tuna sandwhiches, BLTs etc.... Even porridge people dip their bread into these things, like Humus etc....</p>\n<p>But it is possible to have things that can change the Beracha. Why do we even make Berachas and the ramifications in Halacha is a nuanced debate. It usually only affects the rare cases. Although I think the Rambam and Rosh see eye to eye there are nuances, like what takes precedence: fruit that has honour in the Torah or what you want to eat most. (ie: you have two fruit you will eat, one you want to eat more, but one the Torah honours more which should you eat first).</p>\n<p>My only point is that Halacha balances many opinions and so to \"change\" the ramifications of a Beracha is usually not so simple as addressing only one opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

The <strong>corresponding</strong>\nsituation <strong>in the Tabernacle</strong> was with regard to <strong>those who cooked herbs</strong>\nused <strong>to dye curtains</strong>, <strong>whose</strong> dyeing <strong>process was lacking</strong> a small amount\nfor completion.

That is to say, this hypothetical person lives and behaves and interacts just like everyone else, but perhaps like a machine, there is no sentient first-person perspective experiencing each moment.</p>\n<p>This concept is used to explore the implications of different philosophies about the nature of consciousness. Philosophers are split not so much about whether p-zombies exist, but whether the concept is theoretically possible in our universe. (I am not an expert on philosophy so forgive me if I have not understood or explained the topic accurately.)</p>\n<p><strong>I wonder if either side of this debate is compatible with Orthodox Jewish principles of faith.</strong> The way I see it there are three possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Jewish thought broadly affirms the concept of a p-zombie as a possible reality</li>\n<li>The possibility of a p-zombie cannot be accepted, as it contradicts a basic premise of Jewish faith</li>\n<li>There is room for diversity of opinion on this issue</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ancillary to this issue, I wonder how the conscious experience within a human relates to Jewish perspectives on the neshamah and free will.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah makes much about our Free Will, and our uniquely G-d-like nature <strong>and potential behavior</strong> is framed by many of our sources in terms of that Free Will.</p>\n<p>Can a Philosophical Zombie have free will? I think by most definitions, it can't. After all, free will means being able to take in one's thoughts as inputs, contemplate them, and decide an outcome. But a zombie has no \"I\" inside.</p>\n<p>That \"I\" inside is the ruach memalela, the speaking spirit, that appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?ven=Torah_Yesharah,_translated_and_edited_by_Chas._Kahane._New_York,_1963&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Onkelos_Genesis.2.7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Unqelus's translation of the creation of Adam in Bereishis 2:7</a>. Not \"only\" a spirit that speaks to others, but one with an internal monolog. This is how the nishmas chayim (living soul) that Unqelus is translating is the same thing the gemara, the Zohar, and rabbis since associate with free will. (E.g. Seforno and  Meshekh Chokhmah ad loc.) It being able to take its own thoughts back as input and make decisions about our decisions that we can even speak of having a \"will\".</p>\n<p>Both via that internal monolog and through being aware of experiencing qualia.</p>\n<p>(Experiencing qualia: A quale is the difference between a <a href=\"http://www.consciousentities.com/stories.htm#mary\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mary the colorblind scientist</a> knowing that a rose is red, and seeing a red rose and experiencing its redness. It is also the topic of the late-night chat in many dorm rooms, \"How do I know that what I see when I see red isn't what you would call 'blue'?\" In other words, since you cannot speak qualia, how do you know that both of us have the same quale for red? Anyway, back to to the show...)</p>\n<p>Our ability to experience qualia is what Aristotle called \"imagination\". Not just limited to our current use of the word \"imaginary\", when we put together remembered qualia into something we didn't experience. And this idea enters the conversion of rishonim as \"koach hadimyon\" (the power or potential of being able to make likenesses). Rav Yisrael Salanter aligns seikhel (thought), the monolog, with the yeitzer hatov, and the koach hadimyon with the yeitzer hara, in the opening of his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohr_Yisrael%2C_Iggeret_HaMusar.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igeres haMussar</a>.</p>\n<p>So, a zombie doesn't have a soul, it doesn't have an internal \"I\", neither the monolog nor the koach hadimyon necessary to be a ruach memalela, a being with free will.</p>\n<p>Mal'akhim and sheidim could be zombie-esque. As we don't expect either to have free will. Intellects without free will might be zombies, or at least might have a theoretical zombie counterpart.</p>\n<p>The other question would be whether it is possible to come up with the same behavior <strong>as a human being</strong> without free will. And without just saying Hashem makes sure to duplicate what the person's decision would have been had they have free will, since that isn't libertarian anyway.</p>\n<p>And this is where I question the whole thought experiment. It presumes that just because we can imagine a brain can produce the same \"outputs\" / behaviors without consciousness, that such a thing is actually possible. I would argue it isn't.</p>\n<p>For example, there are two ways to think through the question “Does an elephant have hair?”</p>\n<p>The seikhel way of thinking: Elephants are mammals, all mammals have hair, and so unless elephants are the exception to the rule, they must have hair. Elephants are well known and discussed animals. Could they be an exception to the rule and I don’t know it? Nah, they must have hair</p>\n<p>The koach hadimyon: I  can remember elephants I saw, or that I saw pictures of. The detail may be blurry, so you may have to manipulate the picture a bit. Finally, a version of the picture which has a tuft of hair at the tail, maybe (if my memory is good) some downy hair around the eyes and ears, strikes me as the most familiar, the most real. And again I could reach the conclusion that elephants have hair.</p>\n<p>To say that zombies are thing is to say that it is possible to make something that always reaches the same conclusions while working in tokens that represent ideas. That could work for simulating seikhel, but is it true that there are NO decisions rely koach hadimyon? In practice, we make many decisions only basedo on dimyon. R Yisrael Salanter says they tend to be bad ones; you need bicameral thinking to be healthy. (\"Bekhol levavekha - bishnei yitzrakha / 'With your endire heart' -- with both yetzarim [good and evil]\"?)</p>\n<p>Every time we follow a desire, even a good one, we are following our mental image of what satisfying that desire would be like.</p>\n<p>I simply don't think we can assume zombies could emulate that. So I don't think p-zombies could exist. But I don't think the Torah rules them out as much as straight logic does.</p>\n\n\n",

Each thing in the world needs an opposite in order to keep the world balanced.<br />\nOne of the reasons this could be is as humans to understand we are “just a man” we will never be able to achieve or understand the ways of Hashem, as we are finite. We need dialectics to keep us alive. Sleep is a human need in order to keep us functional as a finite human. Otherwise the awake would not be awake.<br />\nHashem created night as a way for us to show our powerlessness and show how the dialectic of us sleeping and letting Hashem be in control, helps us.\n<em>I have spoken to many people who have told me their issues with sleeping at night is because (anxiety)  they don’t feel they can relinquish control.

    "content": "# Is it possible to have non-Jews who are converting (or non-Jewish relatives) over for Yom Tov?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a very clear halacha that one is not allowed to invite non-Jews on Yom Tov specifically. See SA OH 514, Yalkut Yosef 512. The only solution presented in the halacha is if they turn up uninvited, one is not obligated to refuse them, although one is still explicitly not allowed to entreat them to eat. One is even discouraged (although bedi'eved permitted, see YY 512:3) from making them coffee, and one is not allowed to add food to the pot once they turn up uninvited (see Rama 512, MB 512:11, although compare to Chazon Ovadya footnote on p.41 which permits it, yet contrast with what he wrote in Halichot Olam Vol II p.18 forbidding it).</p>\n<p>So, except in the rare case they show up uninvited and barge their way in, in which case one might not even be able to feed them if one hasn't prepared enough, for all practical purposes it's almost impossible to host a non-Jew for Yom Tov.</p>\n<p><sup>For clarity, this is not to do with any form of discrimination, it doesn't even have to do with old paganism and idol worship. It's purely based on a hard reading of a verse in the Torah (Shemot 12:16 and the word \"לכם\") that implies that, in the special provision to cook on Yom Tov (as opposed to Shabbat), one is only allowed to do so for a fellow Jew. Therefore, it becomes almost impossible to invite and host a non-Jew within halacha, and this is the reason, not discrimination. Inviting a non-Jew for Shabbat is not ruled out because of this, and Shabbat is a holier day than a Yom Tov, and one is not required or even encouraged (as far as I can tell) to actively refuse hospitality to a non-Jew even on Yom Tov.</sup></p>\n<p>Does anyone have any solution on how to deal with this on a practical level? How are converting families supposed to learn and integrate on Yom Tov? What about if one has non-Jewish relatives, or non Jews in one's household?</p>\n<p>How does it all work?</p>\n<p>Surely there are some kinds of solutions but I couldn't find any in the halacha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbi Melamed brings an opinion <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/12-03-05/#_te01ftn3_4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in Peneni Halacha</a> that, since the fear is that one will cook for a non-Jew on Yom Tov,  one is permitted to A) serve non-Jewish guests who show up unexpectedly on Yom Tov (SA 512:1; Taz; MB ad loc. 10); B) invite a non-Jewish servant or attendant (Rema 512:1; MB ad loc. 11); and C) invite non-Jews interested in converting to Judaism (without an explicit source; he explains his reasoning with the following footnote:</p>\n<p>\"The question of whether it is permissible le-khatḥila to invite a respected non-Jew to the Seder or another Yom Tov meal for the sake of communal welfare requires further study. See Shulḥan Shlomo, 512, n. 8, which records that it was customary to invite consuls and ambassadors, and that this was permitted because it constitutes a great need.</p>\n<p>In my opinion, this can be permitted under pressing circumstances only if the hosts resolve to finish cooking all the dishes before Yom Tov, just as is done before Shabbat. In this way, the concern that they will cook for the non-Jew is lessened. This can also be combined with the view of most Rishonim that no Torah prohibition is violated when one cooks kosher food for a non-Jew, since other guests may arrive.</p>\n<p>Here, since the non-Jew’s entire objective is to join a traditional, customary Jewish meal, there is no concern that one would cook non-kosher food for him, so perhaps there was no decree in such cases. If we accept this reasoning, then we may rule leniently even when circumstances are not pressing when the goal of the invitation is for the guest to experience a properly observed Jewish holiday.</p>\n<p>According to the same logic, one may be lenient with respect to non-Jews who want to convert or who have already joined non-halakhic streams of Judaism, so as to forge a close relationship that will result in a proper halakhic conversion.\") [END FOOTNOTE]</p>\n<p>I do not, however, see a leniency for inviting non-Jewish family members. Perhaps a LOR could provide a heter for someone cooking entirely before Yom Tov to invite his non-Jewish relatives al pi darkei Shalom, but that's entirely speculation on my part.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Those wanting to convert through the London Beth Din have several stages before being accepted as candidates for conversion, as you can see <a href=\"https://www.woodsideparksynagogue.org.uk/conversion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. I don't think the first stages can be included in the following discussion, they can, however, be invited for a Shabbat meal. Once the candidate is further along the process for example they have been given a tutor to learn Torah with, the halachos are somewhat relaxed.</p>\n<p>As far as I am aware it is better to avoid an actual invitation, but you can ask if they are in your area they should pop in, rather than invite them for a meal (this is my thoughts as it could be better to avoid it if one can).</p>\n<p>The purpose of them eating by a family is in order to have some training in how to run a Shabbos or Yom Tov meal. I have been with potential Gereim at a Yom Tov meal, while the host shared the above with me and further explained the need for them to eat out.</p>\n<p>I will also add a Halachic perspective. Reb Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Shulchan Shlomo) says if one is having one Ger this is allowed since one won’t go out of his way to make more food for one person AND since the Ger is there to learn the Halachos, part of that is showing one is not allowed to cook for a non-jew on Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://shulchanarukh.alhatorah.org/Full/Orach_Chayyim/512.1#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Biur Halacha</a> says for Simchas Yom Tov one is allowed to invite a non-Jew to eat what he has already cooked for himself. Since Gerim do not have family and probably do not have a place to eat, we can add that this is also part of simchas yom tov.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אסור להזמינו וכו׳ – ממה שהביא בשמ״ק בשם הרשב״א משמע דס״ל דאפילו יהיה\nלו עי״ז איבה אסור וכ״כ הפמ״ג במשב״ז אם לא שהענין נוגע לבטול שמחת יו״ט\nיש להקל להזמינו לאכול ממה שהכין לעצמו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why only seven rabbinic commandments?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Traditionally, there are seven rabbinic commandments to be added to the 613 in the Torah: Hallel, Purim, Hanukkah, Eruv, washing hands, lighting Shabbat candles, and saying blessings.</p>\n<p>But there are many other requirements decreed by the rabbis over the centuries and found in Mishnah, Talmud, Mishneh Torah, Shulkhan Arukh, etc.  Why are they not also considered commandments?  Perhaps because they derive logically from the 613?  Or because they are not deemed as important (and if so, why?)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I\"ll answer by prefacing a Gemara in Eiruvin 21b, which states that when Shlomo Hamelech instituted <em>Eiruv</em> and <em>Netilas Yadayim</em>, a heavenly voice rang out and praised Shlomo’s wisdom regarding these new <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Tosfos</em> ask why this heavenly voice didn’t ring out when Shlomo instituted the prohibition of שניות (not marrying ones grandmother etc). The <em>Chasam Sofer</em> in his responsa answers beautifully, that creating מצות דרבנן of things <em>not</em> to do does not deserve praise, because people can fall through which would make G-d more upset; however, the institution of מצות דרבנן of things that one <em>should</em> do is praiseworthy.</p>\n<p>Therefore, Shlomo didn’t just prohibit carrying in a מבוי lest someone come to carry in a public domain, but rather he told you how you <em>do</em> carry, i.e. by making a קורה or לחי. Same for נטילת ידים: He didn’t prohibit anything; rather, he said to <em>actively</em> wash your hands prior to certain activities. That is praiseworthy because now people won’t transgress those new מצות.</p>\n<p>To answer your question of why we count just those seven <em>mitzvos</em>, perhaps it is because none of them are prohibitions, and therefore they warrant the praise to stand alone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Most Rabbinic commandments are added details to Biblical commandments.

But they were as significant as 3000 insofar as they had led the people astray.  This is similar to the Midrashic approach to Yehoshua 7:5, where the number of casualties at Ai is listed as \"like 36\" and the Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.7.5?lang=he&with=Sanhedrin&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 44a</a>) says that it was actually only one, Yair ben Menashe, who was as important as 36 (specifically, the 36 that comprised the majority of the Sanhedrin).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Vayakhel.1.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a> in the beginning of VaYakhel says that all 3000 were from the Eirev Rav, so maybe the \"like\" is modifying the \"ish\" and not the number.</p>\n<p>It could also be that the number is significant, i.e. the 3000 that died was a  predetermined quota that had to be met.  Thsi is implied in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesikta_D%27Rav_Kahanna.2.8?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta D'Rav Kahana (2:8)</a> who says that the total census of the people is equal to the gematria of the the names of the Shevatim minus 3000.  So these 3000 had to be removed.  This approach also explains why the Torah used \"vayipol\" instead \"vayaku\" to describe the deaths of the people (implying that this was more automatic).  It also has the advantage of explaining why the number is so much smaller than we would have expected.</p>\n<p>A bolder version of that is to claim that these 3000 were actually selected arbitrarily as representatives of the people that sinned, even if they themselves were not the most culpable.  But I don't have a good source for this one.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Source for saying Emes at end of Shema?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was just learning the Mishna Berura and Aruch Hashulchan on this topic, and one thing that seemed to be strangely taken for granted by the Mishna Berura, without any source for it that I can find, was the individual's (even in a minyan with a Shliach Tzibbur) recitation of the word \"Emes\" at the end of Shema. The Aruch Hashulchan seems to consider an opinion which agrees that the individual shouldn't say it because it would lead to 249 words instead of 248 since the Chazzan repeats the words HE\"E. However, when the M\"B mentions this issue, he seems to only consider the rectification of leaving out the first Emes for the Shliach Tzibbur alone, while the rest of the Tzibbur would seemingly be left with 249. I must be misunderstanding the M\"B. Either way, like the title of this question, I'd also like to know, what is the source for the halacha of adding on Emes anyway? The midrash that is brought in the Mishna Berura seems to only address the repetition of the three words HE\"E.?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>To address a point of terminology that may clear things up somewhat: the word \"<em>emet</em>\" is not really being \"added\" to <em>shema</em> at all. Rather, it is the first word of the blessing recited after <em>shema</em> i.e. <em>emet veyatziv</em> (or, at night, <em>emet ve-emuna</em>.)</p>\n<p>So, why are we particular not to pause between the end of <em>shema</em> and the first word of the blessing <em>emet veyatziv</em>?</p>\n<p>The source for this is the <em>mishnah</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Berakhot.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 2:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר, בֵּין וַיֹּאמֶר לֶאֱמֶת וְיַצִּיב לֹא יַפְסִיק.‏</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda says: Between <em>VaYomer</em> and <em>emet veyatziv</em>, one may not interrupt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(See the <em>gemara</em> starting at the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.14a.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14a</a> for an explanation as to why.)</p>\n<p>So the individual has to recite <em>emet</em> immediately following <em>shema</em>. (By the way, I don't think Aruch HaShulchan entertains a possibility of the individual not saying <em>emet</em>; like the Mishnah Berurah he seems to me to only be referring to the <em>shaliach tzibbur</em>.)</p>\n<p>Now, how does such an individual get to the desired number of 248 words? I agree that this gets confusing, but it seems to me that both Aruch HaShulchan and Mishnah Berurah understand that the \"<em>emet</em>\" recited by the individual does not count towards the total, as it is part of the next blessing. On the other hand, the <em>emet</em> recited by the <em>shaliach tzibbur</em> (or one of them if he recites it twice) does count, presumably because he does so for the purposes of the getting to the correct number of words.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>אמת is the first word of the bracha after Shema.

    "content": "# Rest and Holiday for Gentiles\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I often read that Gentiles are not to keep the Sabbath or institute any holidays for themselves. How far does it go? Rest from our work activity without refraining from doing extra activities? If I decide that on Sunday I will do nothing since it is a day where virtually nothing can be done in the western world would I be instituting a holiday for myself for not having done anything creative or that requires activity like cleaning the house? Would having meals already break this possibility? If that's the case then it's impossible for Gentiles to establish a holiday for themselves since it's practically impossible to do nothing all day unless they copy the Jews am I right? Can the existence of Sunday as it is today be classified as an established holiday when it is basically a social convention that came into being on its own without the countries instituting it as a holiday? Are all gentile holidays disobedience? Or just those who demand a similar way that Jews practice on the Sabbath that does not exist? In this case, would Adventists be the ones who go head-on against this norm?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Sanhedrin 58B where it discusses the fact that Non-Jews can't keep a sabbath (any day of the week).</p>\n<p>Rashi d\"h עובד כוכבי׳ ששבת there Rashi says one must not do מלאכה for one full day. Likely evening and morning which non-Jews don't do anyway. However Ravina points out according to Rashi any day made for resting (including non-creative work) is prohibited.</p>\n<p>I would be curious if this point of Rashi to not allow any rest from Melacha, is similarly for a night and day (a Jewish day), which does not apply to a non-Jewish day which is from sunrise to sunset. If true there wouldn't be a violation of this specific prohibition for non-Jewish holidays. This would require much more research.</p>\n<p>According to the Rambam Hilchos Melachim (10:9) it appears to be prohibited because it is like making a new religion.</p>\n<p>According to the Meiri שם the Jewish holidays were given to the Jewish people and so someone who keeps them is liable to be punished, since he will look like a Jew and confuse others. I don't have a Meiri to check inside but this might imply clearly non-Jewish holidays are not at odds here.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe (YD 2 Siman 7) does point out that making a new religion is in itself an issue.</p>\n<p>The Malbim states the issue seems to be that since Noach work must be done on the earth for it to provide food and only the Jews were given a break for the Sabbath, this would not be allowed for Non-Jews who are still under the conditions of work that Noah had to do. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6686&pgnum=400\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6686&pgnum=400</a></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe there are 3 relevant, interconnected principles involved here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do not create a new religion<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Do not add to the commandments<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Non-Jews may not rest on Shabbat<sup>2</sup></li>\n</ol>\n<p>If a Noachide wishes to rest from occupational work/weekday activities, or keep a secular holiday or a holiday that is designated to honour the One True God (such as thanksgiving or a national prayer day; secular examples are mothers day/fathers day or independence day), it must be done in a way that does not violate any of the above. In The Divine Code by Rabbi Moshe Weiner (approved by Rabbi Shlomo Moshe Amar), he explains that one can set up a day of rest from work, as well as acknowledge and join in with <em>some</em> of the rituals of a Jewish holiday - especially the ones that are relevant to non-Jews like Rosh Hashana or Sukkot.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Jewish rituals, each must be taken in its own analysis. Based on <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/essay/noahide-holidays\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, he may sit in a Sukkah on Sukkot if it is hot that day, and eat matza on Pesach if he enjoys matza... <strong>all so long as he is not intending to fulfil the Yom Tov <em>as part of the Jewish Mitzva</em>, or set up a <em>new \"mitzva\"/yom tov</em> i.e. purely for his own satisfaction.</strong> He can wear nicer clothes on Shabbat, prepare a special meal and even light candles (to beautify the meal), even he does so in honour of Shabbat because he wishes to glorify and publicise Hashem.</p>\n<p><strong>As this matter is serious, complicated and subtle, I implore any Noahide reading this to follow the rules of the site and CLYOR for how to personally conduct themselves regarding this topic.

Such training probably included various meditative practices. There is also some indication that Israelites would regularly visit prophets to learn Torah (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.4.23?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:4:23</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>\n<p>In addition, Rav Oury Cherki in <a href=\"https://meirtv.com/shiurim/shiur-68649/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this class</a>, min. 21:51-25:55 stated that the point of <em>Torat Ha'Sod</em> is to explain the words of the prophets as they were understood by all people in the time of Tanach (the example he cites is the mystical difference between Shem Havayah as the name of Hashem and Elokim as the name of Hashem - <em>Chesed</em> [mercy/grace] and <em>Din</em> [justice]. According to him, any native-born Hebrew-speaking Israelite in the time of Tanach new the hidden key difference between different names of Hashem. But today we need Kabbalistic texts to explain this to us, because we usually think that Shem Havayah = Elokim = \"God\").

It was easy for the love\nof God to be fixed in the heart of every person, to be inflamed in\nservice of God and His Torah, even without being aroused thereby to\n<em>ahavah rabbah</em>. But generation after generation, as hearts diminished from their wholeness in the service of God with strong love, fiery\nlike burning coals, we became scorched with a foreign fire - in\nphysical loves and lusts - until they overpowered us so greatly that\nwe could not serve God with love unless we were aroused to <em>ahavah\nrabbah</em> through the meticulous fences and stringencies of the Sages,\nin all their details: both in the aspect of \"turn from evil,\" through\nthe stringencies set forth in the Gemara and the <em>halachic</em>\nauthorities, and in the aspect of \"do good,\" through the words of\nmoral instruction in <em>aggadot</em> and the teachings of Avot: a good eye,\nto see one's fellow with generosity of spirit; not to harbor in one's\nheart thoughts of his fellow's harm; and likewise to have a good heart\nand good companionship, and so forth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>ma'amar</em> explains that when the Beit HaMikdash stood, Jewish life looked very different: the Torah itself was enough to keep people spiritually alive and connected. Their relationship with Hashem was natural and wholehearted; love of God came easily, without the need for extra layers of safeguards or motivational tools.</p>\n<p>But over generations, as spiritual vitality weakened, people’s hearts turned more toward physical desires. Serving Hashem with love no longer came naturally. To compensate, we needed the fences and stringencies of the Sages, both in avoiding sin (sur mera) and in cultivating goodness (aseh tov). These included halachic precision as well as moral teachings—learning Aggadah, Pirkei Avot, and developing traits like generosity, goodwill, and healthy companionship.</p>\n<p>This gives a clear picture of what was lost since the First Temple period. Back then, the \"average Jew\" could sustain a direct, passionate love of Hashem through Torah alone. Our current religious structure -with its many stringencies, safeguards, and layers of mussar - is precisely what was added to make up for the decline in that natural closeness.

There, he says that the Jews worshipped idols, albeit outwardly, as the <em>gemarra</em> explains. However, people didn't know what the intent of others were, so everyone was an idol worshipper in each person's eyes. After the Purim story, they sent gift baskets to show they were friends again. He didn't say anything about <em>kashrus</em>, but it's implicit in his idea.</p>\n<p>A third source, this time summarizing an idea in his name, is from the <em>chassidishe</em> compilation sefer <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/83699/p/219/t/9889899291234/fs/yrBwmQJr31IoS9ePfBMrICqRC0UHBVdVTXjJdTwrwoec/start/4/end/10/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siach Sarfei Kodesh</a> <em>Purim</em> § 12 (you need Otzar HaChochmah to see it). It's basically a combination of the above two ideas. Since Jews saw others bowing to idols, their meat now became forbidden, and other <em>kashrus</em> issues would have arisen. People then stopped eating in each other's homes. After the Purim story, people realized that they were only saved because the whole bowing to idols was outward, and therefore everyone could eat in each other's homes.

    "content": "# How does the olam haba of a Noahide differ from that of a Jew?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In other words, what precise reasons would motivate a gentile to convert rather than be a Noahide? I have heard that a Jew's olam haba is “better” but in what sense? What exactly is the difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think that the question is likely one that couldn't be understood properly because even if you would ask what is it like to have a Jewish Olam Haba everything would be in parables and not capture the essence.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, Rav Dessler (See חלק א׳ שכר מצוה) points out that there is more joy from the \"smell\" of Olam Haba then there exists in the world from beginning to end (ie: if it was all \"added\" together). So nothing can capture or comprehend this.</p>\n<p>My basic understanding is that there is a nuanced difference in that of proximity to Hashem. So for example a Jewish person may be closer in connection/proximity to Hashem. My guess is that this all depends on how great you are in your role, demands, and abilities.</p>\n<p>For example I find it hard to accept that I have earned a closer place then Noach, Eve or Adam etc... There are likely many non-Jews who earned to be closer than me who are alive today.</p>\n<p>I do think that obviously someone who wants to be closer will do more, but at the same time there is a balance between taking on too much and not willing to do those commandments he already has or break new requirements that he took upon himself.</p>\n<p>So the motivation is being able to serve Hashem in more Mitzvos, to perfect oneself more, and be closer to Hashem. For example a non-Jew cannot keep the Sabbath. Torah is prohibited to be taught to a non-Jew (seek a Rabbi to know what can be taught to a non-Jew).</p>\n<p>I think deciding to join the religion because you will \"gain\" more, although a normal human thought, should not be the approach. I don't blame the question though because it is a natural factor and thought. In fact in this world, Jewish people are routinely hounded and hated so in this world you might lose quite a bit which begs your question of the next world.

Rabbi Aḥa bar Ḥanina said: It is revealed and known before the One Who spoke and the world came into being that in the generation of Rabbi Meir there was no one of the Sages who is his equal. Why then didn’t the Sages establish the halakha in accordance with his opinion? It is because his colleagues were unable to ascertain the profundity of his opinion. He was so brilliant that he could present a cogent argument for any position, even if it was not consistent with the prevalent halakha. As he would state with regard to a ritually impure item that it is pure, and display justification for that ruling, and likewise he would state with regard to a ritually pure item that it is impure, and display justification for that ruling. The Sages were unable to distinguish between the statements that were halakha and those that were not.\"</p>\n<p>The Ben Yehoyada says over there: ונראה לי בס\"ד כי הוא היה עושה חריפות זו לטהר הטמא ויראה לו פנים כדי לחדד התלמידים ולראות אם ירגישו לדחות את דברים אלו בטענה של חריפות וכו</p>\n<p>\"That he would do this חריפות (sharpness), meaning that he would be sharp like that to pure the impure and it seemed to him to do this to sharpen the talmidim, to see if they can reject his words with other objections, etc.\"</p>\n<p>לפע\"ד I believe that this was the reason Rebbi Meir got so a bad reputation for his Yeshiva. He taught his students in a way that is not meant to pasken halacha but to sharpen their minds. This seemed like a different approach for everyone at that time, and Rav Yehudah didn't want that way of learning in his Yeshiva.</p>\n<p>Maybe we can also add the Gemera in Chagigah 15a that Rebbi Meir still followed Elisha ben Avuyah (Acher), his Rebbi, even though he went off the derech. So maybe that mindset also influenced Rebbi Meirs students thus causing a bad reputation for his Yeshiva.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Hashem too holy to abide by us, yet closer to us than we can imagine - how to resolve?",
    "content": "# Hashem too holy to abide by us, yet closer to us than we can imagine - how to resolve?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: Hashem creates us and communicates with us through prophecy. Creating seems as \"close and personal\" an activity as communicating, if not more. I note that He creates everyone (continually), regardless of how holy they are, and yet He doesn't speak to everyone through prophecy - only those who are holy enough. I am wondering if this is a question: if He can get \"close enough\" to create us regardless of how holy we are, why \"can't\" He get \"close enough\" to speak to all of us?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It seems like, when it comes to Hashem's closeness to us, we have 2 different sides, and they go in opposite directions and I would like to know how to resolve them.</p>\n<p>A) On the one hand, the reason why Hashem doesn't speak to us openly (i.e. we aren't all prophets casually conversing with the Living God) is because we have sinned and the Shechina is in exile. I.e. Hashem is holy to the superlative, and we are sinners who He can't abide by to speak with.</p>\n<p>B) Yet on the other hand, Judaism 101 is that Hashem is intimately involved in creation, again, to the superlative. He is personally creating us and the world, and all events and powers that exist are created by Him. He is closer to us than we can possibly imagine.</p>\n<p><strong>So Hashem is very close to us in one way (creating us), but in another way (speaking to us), there is a huge barrier. I would like to try to get to the bottom of the key differences between the two that produce this difference.</strong> Do note that it seems, from our vantage point, that creating someone is far more close and intimate than speaking, which in our world takes place <em>at a distance</em>. What's going on here?</p>\n<p>There are endless sources to choose from to bring out both A and B, so I'll just pick one each:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Nasso.16.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source for A</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי שמואל בר נחמן, בשעה שברא הקדוש ברוך הוא את העולם, נתאוה שיהא\nלו דירה בתחתונים כמו שיש בעליונים. ברא את האדם וצוה אותו ואמר לו: מכל\nעץ הגן אכל תאכל, ומעץ הדעת טוב ורע לא תאכל ממנו (בראשית ב, טז-יז).\nועבר על צוויו. אמר ליה הקדוש ברוך הוא, כך הייתי מתאוה שיהא לי דירה\nבתחתונים כמו שיש לי בעליונים, ודבר אחד צויתי אותך ולא שמרת אותו. מיד\nסלק הקדוש ברוך הוא שכינתו לרקיע הראשון.</p>\n<p>Ribbi Shmuel Bar Nachman said that the moment Hashem created the\nworld, He desired that there should be a dwelling place for Him in the\nlowest worlds just like in the highest worlds. He created man and\ncommanded him saying \"from all the trees in the garden you should eat,\nbut from the tree of knowledge which is good and evil, don't eat from\nit\". When he violated this commandment, Hashem said \"So how I would\ndesire to have a dwelling place in the lower world like the higher,\nand one thing I commanded you and you didn't listen!\"... immediately\nHashem withdrew His Shechina to the first heaven...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I picked this source because of how it connects His withdrawal with His desire to be close to us, and how sin blocks that. I could also have picked examples of how prophecy requires high levels of holiness and humility (bittul).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kuzari.3.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source for B</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהַבּוֹרֵא יִתְבָּרֵךְ בּוֹרֵא הָאֵבָרִים וְנוֹתֵן לָהֶם כֹּחוֹת\nוּמַמְשִׁיךְ לָהֶם עִם הָרְגָעִים, וְאִלּוּ הָיוּ מַעֲלִים עַל לֵב\nהִסְתַּלְּקוּת הַשְׁגָּחָתוֹ וְהַנְהָגָתוֹ רֶגַע אֶחָד הָיָה נִפְסָד\nהָעוֹלָם כֻּלּו</p>\n<p>The Blessed Creator creates limbs and gives them their power\ncontinually each moment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We cannot fathom how closely we are connected to Hashem.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, how do the sources deal with this conundrum? How can Hashem not abide to talk to us, vulnerable to our deeds, actions and personal holiness, yet on the other hand, is so close to us that He is listening to our thoughts, He is animating us down to the atom, and to the core of our soul? I would like to understand this properly, as I am sure the answer is very deep and profound, so if someone would be able to explain it without jargon (He creates us from the \"sweat of the Ophanim\", \"over the shoulder\" or \"under the Throne of Glory\" etc), using grounded, but down to earth mashalim and logical explanations, with sources, I would really appreciate it thank you.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think there are different contradictions that are at play...</p>\n<p>But the main one you are asking about can be solved based off of the רמח׳׳ל if I understood you correctly.</p>\n<p>Hashem and whether we are close or far is in reality not a description of proximity (as you know) but it is also not a description of connection either.</p>\n<p>It is a description of his obviousness (radiance) and how hidden he is. And so although he can be the cause of every minute detail and where the world is heading, it is difficult for us to see this clearly.</p>\n<p>See Derech Hashem Chapter 4:10</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והאמנם האדון ב׳׳ה מאיר תמיד למי שיתקרב אליו...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It appears that proximity and הארת פנים are somewhat synonymous to the Ramchal and the Ramchal mentions הארת פנים as how openly revealed Hashem is. This coincides with someones שלמות (perfection). See there.</p>\n<p>Purim I think highlights this well. Esther (meaning hidden) and of course Hashem's name not mentioned openly. And yet Hashem runs and orchestrates everything.

Therefore, it does not say \"from all His work (מכל מלאכתו),\" because there were things that were not entirely completed at that time, such as the ten things that were created on erev Shabbat bein hashmashot (twilight) such as the mouth of the earth, the mouth of the well, the mouth of the donkey, and all of them were created at that time, but their completion was done by Hashem at its appropriate time.

    "content": "# firstborn status after the arrival of the moshiach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Ohr Hachaim (Bamidbar 3,45) says a chiddush that seems to not have any obvious source, that לעתיד לבא (after the arrival of mashiach) the Avoda in the Beis Hamikdash will return to the firstborn! (we know that they did have this role till the חטא העגל).</p>\n<p>I have seen many good questions on this chiddush, but the following one stood out. The Gemara Tannis 17a states (according to the חכמים) that a Kohen בזמן הזה (nowadays) may not drink wine because perhaps the Beis Hamikdash will be rebuilt then and he will be called to return to service in the Beis Hamikdash, and one cannot perform the Avodah in an inebriated state.</p>\n<p>The question is if the Avoda will be done by the firstborn (בכורים) also, then why don't they have the same prohibition like the Kohanim not dring intoxicated beverages?</p>\n<p>Perhaps one can say that only the firstborn of that generation (of moshiach) will merit to do the Avoda, but the Bechorim of today lost their Kedusha by their \"Pidyon\" Haben... What are your thoughts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Great question! It is worthy to note that the source for the Or Hachaim is the Yalkut 364, but when one looks for this Yalkut its not there!?</p>\n<p>@user2709 here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/28295/source-for-bechorot-losing-reclaiming-priesthood\">Source for bechorot losing/reclaiming priesthood</a> brought words from the Rebbe which I think might answer your question.</p>\n<p>This is what he says:</p>\n<p>דלפי״ז לכאורה מובן שכבר בימות המשיח לפני תחיית המתים יתבטל לגמרי חטא העגל ותוחזר אז העבודה לבכורות כיון שיהי׳ כבר אז כמו שהי׳ לפני חטא הדעת. ובס׳ ׳מועדים וזמנים׳ (ה״ז סי׳ קסט) הביא דברי האור החיים הנ״ל והקשה ע״ז דדבריו צ״ב האיך ישתנו דיני התורה בביאת המשיח שבכורות מזרע ישראל שהם זרים יוכשרו לעבודה, וכן הקשה ממ״ש הרמב״ם בסוף הל׳ מלכים שמלך המשיה מייהם שבט לוי לכהונה משמע ששבט לוי יעבדו העבודה עיי״ש,</p>\n<p>\"That even in moshiach's times the avoda will go back to the bechoros (before tchiyas hamaisim) when the punishment of the golden calf will be finished. He brings that R Sternbuch asks that the rambam says the leviim will be working in the bais hamikdosh. He goes on to answer it saying they both will be doing the avoda. I would suggest a simple answer. He doesnt say the avaira of the egel will be forgiven straight away only it will happen in moshiach's times before tchiyas hameisim. <strong>That may take some time and until then we will need the leviim.</strong> His other question how can someone from the other tribes classified as a 'zor' be kosher. The b'chorim then will not be classified as such.\"</p>\n<p>I think since he mentions that it will take some time until the bechors assume position as Kohanim, therefore the rule of not drinking intoxicating drinks wont apply anymore, it will only apply when the bechors get reinstated as Kohanim when Mashiach comes.</p>\n\n\n",

When he left this world, he was alone in his home\nand nobody knew that he had died. At that moment, a figure of a woman\nappeared, she stood over him, and she raised her voice wailing and\nlamenting. In fact, she sighed and wailed so profusely that a large\ncrowd gathered to whom she instructed: “Eulogize this pious man and\nbury him! Give honour to his coffin and you will merit the world to\ncome, for this man honoured me his entire life! Thanks to him, I was\nnot abandoned or forgotten.” Immediately, all the women gathered round\nand sat with her, and an enormous funeral was held. The men tended to\nthe shrouds and all the other burial requirements, and they buried him\nwith great honour. Meanwhile, the mysterious woman continued to weep\nand wail. They asked her, “What is your name?”, to which she replied,\n“My name is Chagigah.” As soon as the pious man was buried, the woman\ndisappeared and the people then realized that it was, indeed, Masechet\nChagigah that had appeared in the form of a woman and who had come at\nthe time of his passing to lament and weep over him and to see that he\nwas buried with honour – because he had reviewed this Massechet\ncontinually and dedicated himself to its study.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This may very likely be where Rav Moshe Greenwald got the idea from!

    "content": "# Man's Duty in this World\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Judaism, what is man's duty in this world, and what should man's goal in life be?</p>\n<p>Is our goal to fulfill G0d's commandments, which will earn us a place in Olam Haba, or is our goal merely to serve Hashem, altruistically, without any thought about possible reward?</p>\n<p>Or perhaps, is our duty and goal something totally different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Man's duty and goal can be looked at from two vantage points: 1). From Hashem's view 2). From our own.</p>\n<p>According to the Ramchal (Derech Hashem, Daat Tvunos, etc...) Hashem wanted to give and so he decided to create something to receive ultimate goodness. However, for a number of reasons (see there) he wanted man to have free choice and be able to do positive things with his free choice.</p>\n<p>By being the \"cause\" of good we accomplish what Hashem wanted us to do. This I believe is our \"duty\" as I see, this is want Hashem wants from us. Our goal is to connect to Hashem. As the Ramchal mentions (Daas Tvunos Chelek 4) by perfecting ourselves Hashem can connect more directly with us and have \"הארת פנים\" which I understand is connected if not synonymous with the \"ultimate good\" - ie: being connected to Hashem.</p>\n<p>In reality these are one in the same, our perfection (ie: the good we cause) enables the connection and our destructive acts block or turn Hashem away from us. See Ramchal there.</p>\n<p>1). Hashem wants us to \"earn\"/\"deserve\" Olam Haba (you can't truly earn it even if you did every Mitzvah and no aveira, what does Hashem owe us? I recall a Ramban to this effect on Chumash, but I think logical).</p>\n<p>2). We want to connect to Hashem... the \"reward\" is incidental imo. (See Michtav Meliyahu (חלק ב׳) on Elul where there is practical advice imo on how to accomplish this (הצנע לכת) - his goal there is to remove haughtiness, but I think it can apply here too).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<h4>Man's duty in the world:</h4>\n<p>Torah and Mitzvot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The world exists only for the sake of Torah (Pesachim 68b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Torah and Mitzva are practically synonymous:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I will give you the tablets of stone, the Torah, and the Mitzvah\n(Shemot 24:12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah and Mitzvot are Hashem's Wisdom and Will absolutely (Tanya Ch. 34). By performing them, we are fulling our reason for being created; our mission and purpose. This is to serve Hashem, and this is considered a service because we are performing His Will, i.e. giving Him what He wants.</p>\n<h4>Should one keep the Torah and Mitzvot altruistically or should one do so for the reward?</h4>\n<p>Ideally yes, they should be done altruistically, without thought of reward.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Antigonus a man of Socho... used to say: do not be like servants who\nserve the master in the expectation of receiving a reward, but be like\nservants who serve the master without the expectation of receiving a\nreward</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This takes explanation and as Micha Berger rightly <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/133750/mans-duty-in-this-world/133768#comment444693_133750\">pointed out</a>, it takes a book (at least). However, as a summary and introduction to encourage the reader to take on further study:</p>\n<p>It says in Derech Hashem that Hashem created the world in order to give goodness from His goodness to another (1:2:1). He then proceeds to explain that our duty is to emulate Him, and this is how we receive that good.</p>\n<p>So what we know so far is that the best good is Hashem, and what's good about Him is that His desire is to give to another. Therefore conclude that the best good of all is giving to others (serving others).</p>\n<p>He gave us a good mashal in Shir Hashirim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am for my beloved, my beloved is for me (6:3)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are quite a few ways a relationship can work. Both parties can be selfish but complement each other and therefore exist in a functional relationship with some goodness. This is not Godly though, and therefore not the best good.</p>\n<p>The best good is when both parties are into each other more than they are into themselves. The only way to make sense of this, is following the line of the Rambam on the Mishna in Avot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this pious one said that you should not serve God, may He be\nblessed, in order that He will do good to you and benefit you with\nkindness and that you should hope for the benefit and serve Him for\nits sake. Indeed, serve Him like servants that are not hoping for\nendowment or the giving of kindness. He meant with this that they\nshould serve Him from love, as we said in Chapter Ten of Sanhedrin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and what Ramchal states clearly in Mesilat Yisharim Chapter 18:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Fortunate is the man whose toil is in the Torah and gives\ngratification to his Maker\"... he who truly loves the Creator, blessed\nbe He, will not strive and intend to discharge himself with the known\nobligations binding on every Jew. Rather, what will happen to him is\nthe same as that of a son who loves his father. Even if his father\nreveals a slight indication of something he desires, already the son\nwill strive greatly, to the best of his ability, to fulfill this thing\nor service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Conclude from all this that the greatest good is serving others, one's beloveds.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Taste, and see that Hashem is good (Tehillim 34:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By default, our entire orientation in life is to gain pleasure by fulfilling our own desires and wants. During that time, the idea of serving others being pleasurable sounds far fetched, and at best a nice little idea that is probably true to some extent. The truth is, it takes wisdom (via Torah learning) and experience (i.e. <em>taste it</em>, via performing Mitzvot, especially the Mitzva to get married) for one to see the truth of it.</p>\n<p>A truly holy and devoted husband will tell you, hands down, no pleasure or wonder of the universe could possibly compare to the delight he takes in bringing his wife a coffee in the morning. <strong>Not</strong> because he will get a reward out of it, but actually serving her, fulfilling her needs great and small, <em>is its own reward</em>. He is for his beloved, not himself, his own needs and desires pale in comparison to hers - he feels the tug of <strong>her need</strong> as a true delightful privilege for him to be able to serve - and he has been blessed to experience a taste of true goodness and Godly delight.</p>\n<p>So now we can understand our Mishna. Is there reward in serving Hashem and each other? Yes, the best reward imaginable. Should we be doing it for that reward? No, this ruins it. It is no longer a true service, it is simply a self service, and adds a bitter taste to what should be only sweet - fulfilling the needs and desires of someone else, because one is completely and utterly devoted, <em>one</em>, with them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹקֵינוּ ה' <strong>אֶחָֽד</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we stated above, the Torah and Mitzvot are Hashem's absolute Will. Therefore by performing them, we are truly serving Him. In-so-doing, we are emulating Him and becoming One with Him, and we will receive Him in Olam Haba (as our \"reward\", see Derech Hashem 1:2 onwards). Another way to see it, don't read Hashem gave <em>us</em> the purpose of receiving the best good. <em>Hashem's</em> purpose is to give the best good. It's His purpose, not ours. Ours, as stated above, is Torah and Mitzvot and in-so-doing emulate Hashem by giving from our goodness to others.</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWdkCVrMEbc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">clarifies for us</a> a couple of points:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>This aspect of relationship with Hashem comes from being His servants, and this <em>is</em> the husband-wife relationship mentioned throughout Chazal (i.e. a husband and wife view each-other as their master, and they are the servant of the master).</li>\n<li>At Har Sinai when Hashem became ours and we accepted, we accepted <em>b'mesiras nefesh</em>, which means we gave up our entire life to Him, which included our pleasure. Therefore the reward in Olam Haba cannot be us having <em>our own pleasure</em>. He clarifies that in Olam Haba, Hashem will reveal to us <em>how much our performance of the Mitzvot meant to Him</em>, and that knowledge is going to be \"delighting in Hashem\" as mentioned in the introduction to Mesilat Yisharim - a reward and delight far greater and more holy than personal gratification.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The astute reader will read between the lines and see what the greatest goodness of all is - having each other, not the things about each other. \"I don't want Your Olam Haba, all I want is You\" - Alter Rebbe. It's enough to, so to speak, satisfy God, and if we follow His guidance (Torah), we will taste it for ourselves, and by keeping the Mitzvot, we will bring about this great Oneness He is after, for His sake, and for the sake of everyone. We might also enjoy it too, but let's not focus on that :)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיה ה' למלך על־כל־הארץ ביום ההוא יהיה ה' אחד ושמו אחד (Zacharia 14:9)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>May this great day arrive without delay.</p>\n<hr />\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato (known as the Ramchal), in his work \"Mesilas Yesharim\" (beginning of Chapter 1) expresses it as such:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יסוד החסידות ושרש העבודה התמימה הוא שיתברר ויתאמת אצל האדם מה חובתו\nבעולמו ולמה צריך שישים מבטו ומגמתו בכל אשר הוא עמל כל ימי חייו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The foundation of piety and the root of perfect service [of G-d] is for a man to clarify and come to realize as truth what is his obligation in his world and to what he needs to direct his gaze and his aspiration in all that he toils all the days of his life.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה מה שהורונו חכמינו זכרונם לברכה הוא, שהאדם לא נברא אלא להתענג על\nה' ולהנות מזיו שכינתו שזהו התענוג האמיתי והעידון הגדול מכל העידונים\nשיכולים להמצא. ומקום העידון הזה באמת הוא העולם הבא, כי הוא הנברא בהכנה\nהמצטרכת לדבר הזה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Behold, what our sages, of blessed memory, have taught us is that man was created solely to delight in G-d and to derive pleasure in the radiance of the Shechina (divine presence). For this is the true delight and the greatest pleasure that can possibly exist. The place of this pleasure is, in truth, in Olam Haba (the World to Come). For it was created expressly for this purpose.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך הדרך כדי להגיע אל מחוז חפצנו זה, הוא זה העולם. והוא מה שאמרו זכרונם\nלברכה (אבות ד): העולם הזה דומה לפרוזדור בפני העולם הבא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the path to arrive at the desired haven of ours, is this world. This is what our sages of blessed memory said: \"this world is like a corridor before the World to Come\" (Avot 4:16).</p>\n<p>והאמצעים המגיעים את האדם לתכלית הזה, הם המצוות אשר צונו עליהן האל יתברך שמו. ומקום עשיית המצוות הוא רק העולם הזה. על כן הושם האדם בזה העולם בתחלה כדי שעל ידי האמצעים האלה המזדמנים לו כאן יוכל להגיע אל המקום אשר הוכן לו, שהוא העולם הבא, לרוות שם בטוב אשר קנה לו על ידי אמצעים אלה. והוא מה שאמרו, זכרונם לברכה (עירובין כב א): היום לעשותם ומחר לקבל שכרם.</p>\n<p>The means that lead a person to this goal, are the commandments which the blessed G-d commanded to us. The place of the performance of these commandments is only in this world. Therefore, man was first placed in this world so that through these means prepared for him here, he will be able to reach the place prepared for him, namely, the World to Come, there to be sated with the good which he acquired through these means. This is what our sages of blessed memory said \"today to do them, and tomorrow to receive their reward\" (Eruvin 22:1).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there salvation from ignorance?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How is the relationship between people who had open experiences with God or with his manifestations in relation to those who had nothing? Will God treat them differently when it comes to their behavior here on Earth? Will those who have had no direct or close contact with the divine presence have any compensation for moral failings compared to those they have? The Rambam says that only those who kept the seven laws of Noah will have the right to the world to come out of the conviction that it was a divine ordinance through Moses who wrote these commandments, how does he expect this to happen? The faith? Isn't this a foreign concept to Judaism being closer to Christianity? Does Judaism not stand on solid foundations of events? I consider Christian-type faith something very abstract and even dangerous if it involves concepts like salvation, wouldn't that be playing with people's destiny? Are those isolated people without any contact or concepts of Judaism, Noahide laws but somehow culturally observed all the noetic laws, are they lost by only considering them basic moral laws? Does Judaism somehow support that Pauline concept that those ignorant of the truths of Scripture will not be condemned?</p>\n<p>In short. What is necessary for humanity to reach the state of consciousness that these universal moral commandments are the result of a will of a certain God since there are several \"gods\" out there. And what will happen to the people who observed these commandments in their own cultural consciences spiritually speaking?</p>\n<p>You can if you want to answer one or all of the questions with a question mark if you so wish, you are free to answer what you think is best to clarify.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First the Rambam is in Hilchos Melachim 8:14 (or 8:11 according to a different edition?).</p>\n<p>Kesef Mishna there says that the need to do so because Moses commanded it, is the Rambam's own logic.</p>\n<p>To explain the logic (see בני ולחם יהודה for the necessity due to other Gemaras). I would simply say that someone who does something because it is logical is not accomplishing anything other then what he needs to do because it's better for humanity or himself etc...</p>\n<p>Someone who does something because he was commanded by Hashem understands that these commandments form a connection and relationship which is what Olam Haba is. Sadly someone who does not form that connection simply doesn't have it.</p>\n<p>It would be fascinating to know whether one who logically realizes Hashem exists, and realizes that he wants us to do these things, or because he has a tradition from Noah (and not Moses) would he have Olam Haba. I can imagine the answer is yes, and the Rambam writes about Moses for other reasons.</p>\n<p>See Michtav Meliyahu (חלק א׳) about why rewards are given and why it is ultimately fair. For example, someone who does something for physical reasons, why should he receive a spiritual reward? He in fact might find the spiritual reward painful, whereas a physical reward in this world much more gratifying. This is because Olam Haba requires refinement of soul. He also writes there that someone who grew up with a warped sense of good/evil is judged on their level not an absolute standard (נקודת הבחירה).</p>\n<p>Faith should be a separate question; however, in regard to this specifically, one should not serve Hashem out of reward, but rather for his sake.

I found two main approaches to this question.</p>\n<p>One approach is from Rabbi Shlomo Kluger in חכמת התורה page 462. He suggests that this is similar to what happened with the stones that Yaccov put under his head when he slept. They were originally twelve stones but they became one stone. The Luchos were two stones that became one stone. After the sin of the Egel they became two again.</p>\n<p>The other approach is from Zohar, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Yitro.21.367?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi&with=Sulam&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yitro 21:366 with Sulam (sefaria.org)</a>. This approach has a disagreement between Rebbe Yehuda and Rebbe Yitzchok about how many stones there were. According to Rebbe Yehuda it was one stone that looked like two. According to Rebbe Yitzchok it was one and Hashem split it into 2 (this is how I understand the Zohar).</p>\n\n\n",

Though this is different (the Kohanim though wash both hands and feet) you can see that there are many references depending how specific or vague you are interested in being.</p>\n\n\n",

Yes, his 13th principle of faith is \"The dead will be resurrected.\"  But he made it clear he believed in a spiritual, not a bodily, resurrection, saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All men must die equally, their bodies becoming dissolved into their constituent matter.

There is no way for us in this world to know or comprehend the great goodness which the soul experiences in the world to come, for in this world we know only of material pleasures, and it is these we desire.

Although as Binyamin mentioned miracles don't prove anything and aren't a full proof, as Jews we still must believe in these miracles that were done by Hashem and Moshe which surely did take place.</p>\n<p>Mabye the second answer is in Zevachim 116a:</p>\n<p>ומה קול ההמון הזה ששמענו אמר להם חמדה טובה יש לו בבית גנזיו שהיתה גנוזה אצלו תתקע\"ד דורות קודם שנברא העולם וביקש ליתנה לבניו שנאמר (תהלים כט, יא) ה' עוז לעמו יתן [מיד] פתחו כולם ואמרו (תהלים כט, יא) ה' יברך את עמו בשלום</p>\n<p>They asked: And if so, what is this tumultuous sound that we have heard? Balaam said to them: He has a good and precious item in His treasury, that was hidden away with Him for 974 generations before the world was created, and He seeks to give it to his children, as it is stated: “The Lord will give strength to His people” (Psalms 29:11). “Strength” is a reference to the Torah, which is the strength of the Jewish people. Immediately, they all began to say: “The Lord will bless His people with peace” (Psalms 29:11).</p>\n<p>The fact that Bilam who was the greatest non Jewish prophet had all kings come to him and asked what the noise was, and he said that Hashem is giving the Torah, proves that even the Non Jews knew it was Hashem speaking!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question is a common one that is actually addressed in the Bible itself.</p>\n<p>Part of the experience of full prophecy is the clear recognition that one is hearing communication from G-d. It is far, far more than hearing a voice. Rather, it is a transcendent experience that comes with a clarity not achievable by mere human senses, rather from contact with the divine. (This is explained at length by the Ramchal in his classic book, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_Three%2C_On_the_Prophetic_Experience.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Way of G-d:</a>)</p>\n<p>At Mt. Sinai, the Jews did more than hear a voice; they experienced the highest possible human level of contact with the Creator, referred to as G-d speaking to them \"face to face.\" To quote the introduction to the Ten Commandments in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.4-5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Lord talked with you face to face in the mountain out of the midst\nof the fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And after receiving the Ten Commandments, the Jews <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.5.19-21?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These words the Lord spoke to all your assembly in the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, with a great voice which was not heard again. And he wrote them on two tablets of stone, and delivered them to me.\nAnd it came to pass, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that you came near to me, all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;\nand you said, Behold, the Lord our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of this is part of the tradition of Har Sinai that the Jewish nation passed down from generation to generation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do some versions of the Amidah not have the ו on וקונה הכל?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the first blessing of the Amidah, there's part that often says <code>וְקוֹנֵה הַכּל</code> (\"and creates everything\"). It looks like this in many siddurim, e.g. ArtScroll, Lev Shalem, and Mishkan T'fila. You can see a version like this <a href=\"https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/full-text-of-the-first-blessing-of-the-amidah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on MyJewishLearning</a>.</p>\n<p>Chabad sources however drop the vav (\"and\") and just say <code>קונה הכל</code>. E.g. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/980654/jewish/1-First-3-Brachot.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> they have a text and a matching recording. (the other version I can find on Chabad, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/867673/jewish/Transliteration.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">their transliteration</a>, is the same) Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Edot_HaMizrach%2C_Weekday_Shacharit%2C_Amida.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Edot HaMizrach</a> does not have the vav (thanks to Rabbi Kaii pointing this out in a comment).</p>\n<p>Why do these diverge? I was under the impression that the Amidah was standardized in the Mishnaic period. The only other variations in the Amidah I'm aware of are more recent theological divergences (adding the Matriarchs, or <code>מתים</code> to <code>הכל</code> to dispute resurrection of the dead). Does this difference represent some sort of theological point, or is it just an accident of textual divergence through history?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16002&st=&pgnum=43&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar Hakolel</a> brings from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Etz_Chaim%2C_Gate_of_the_Silent_Prayer.14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Etz Chaim</a> that קונה is supposed to be an anagram of ונקה, the 13th Attribute of Mercy, which is why it's spelled with an extra ו. He says that other versions avoid altering the word by adding a ו to the beginning instead, and goes on to defend Chabad's version. Based on his reasoning, וקונה would seem to be the worst of both worlds, possibly a distortion of וְקֹנֵה.</p>\n\n\n",

This custom remains with us till today.</p>\n<p>Seems to me that the whole point of it was to create a more serious atmosphere at the wedding, and that can only be accomplished by breaking an expensive glass/goblet etc, just like the white glass brought in the Gemara which was hard to find in the market (see Tosfos Shabbos 20b).</p>\n<p>Why then do people use old and/or cheap glasses to break at the Chuppah, it seems to be negating the whole idea behind this custom?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In Yalkut Yosef שובע שמחות חלק א דף רמא he brings down the idea from the ראבי\"ה who uses the Gemera in Moed Katan 27a that nowadays we have a cheap cup in order to not embarrass others who don't have a fancy/expensive cup.\n(I'm not sure if the ראבי\"ה adds this following point): Nowadays people cover up this cup so the pieces don't go flying and damage, so because the cup isn't seen anyways, we don't need to be makpid to have an expensive cup, and just by breaking it people remember the churban.</p>\n\n\n",

This approach emphasizes the miracles and wonders that Hashem performed for us, and how He chose us as His nation at Sinai.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Story of the Jewish People\nThis approach broadens the scope of the seder night to include other historical events that have shaped our identity and destiny as a people. This approach relates the exodus to other times of oppression and redemption, such as the Holocaust, pogroms, Zionism and Israel. This approach also connects the seder night to current issues and challenges that we face as Jews in different parts of the world.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Lomdus of Seder\nThis approach delves into the deeper meanings and implications of the seder night, by analyzing its laws and customs from various sources and perspectives. This approach explores questions such as why we break the middle matzah, and is it a din Gavra or Cheftaza (do I need to break it or it must be broken). This approach also compares different opinions and practices among different authorities and communities.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each of these approaches has its merits.

This is because when you add chessed to gevurah, it will give you berachos, blessings.</p>\n<p>See also the Tosfos ד\"ה טעמו פגמו, where the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.7.5.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi is quoted</a>. The Tosfos says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And he puts some water into the cup, <strong>so that it will appear to be unblemished.</strong> As it is stated in Yerushalmee: R” Yonoh tasted the cup and he corrected it by adding water or wine and the explanation is that after he drank from it he added a drop of water or wine to correct it and then he would recite havdoloh or kidush upon it.

    "content": "# The Maharsha accusing Rav Pappa!\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara Shabbos 140b states the following..</p>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַב פָּפָּא: הַאי מַאן דְּאֶפְשָׁר לְמִישְׁתֵּי שִׁיכְרָא וְשָׁתֵי חַמְרָא — עוֹבֵר מִשּׁוּם ״בַּל תַּשְׁחִית״. וְלָאו מִילְּתָא הִיא — ״בַּל תַּשְׁחִית״ דְּגוּפָא עֲדִיף</p>\n<p>And Rav Pappa said: One who is able to drink beer and nevertheless drinks wine violates the prohibition against wanton destruction. The Gemara comments: And this is not a correct matter, as the prohibition against destruction of one’s body takes precedence. It is preferable for one to care for his body by eating higher quality food than to conserve his money.</p>\n<p>Says the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Agadot_on_Shabbat.140b.3?lang=bi&with=Shabbat&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha</a> that Rav Pappa only said this for his own benefit, because he was a beer merchant (see Pesachim 113a) and he wanted people to buy beer, but really he seems to be wrong because wine is better for the body like the Gemara explained.. (see Reshash that comments on the Maharsha that his accusation is groundless and unfounded).</p>\n<p>Why would the Maharsha accuse such a holy Torah luminary that predated him by centuries?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have a different answer:</p>\n<p>It is possible that the whole statement is Rav Pappa, and that he himself said it isn't true, and that the Maharsha is pointing out that Rav Pappa felt uneasy because he was saying this only for his own benefit. The Rashash is arguing that perhaps Rav Pappa only retracted due to a fear of being associated with someone who says Torah for their own benefit.</p>\n<p>The יד מלאכי in Siman שצח seems to imply that Lav Milta He, is when the person himself retracts (that is his topic of discussion and only lists these cases), but maybe its the person himself only when its explicitly stated.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I think here it may be read as one long statement by Rav Pappa. And in fact the יד מלאכי explains that we don't actually rely on לאו מלתא היא and the retraction, instead whatever is more logical. Which might mean that you should indeed buy more beer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't think the Maharsha is accusing R' Pappa of making an untrue statement to boost sales. As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashash_on_Shabbat.140b.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashash</a> himself points out (and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Chatam_Sofer_on_Shabbat.140b.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasam Sofer</a> hints), the Gemara's rebuttal would apply equally to R' Chisda's statement about wheat and barley bread, yet there's no suggestion that he was influenced by ulterior motives. R' Pappa is essentially repeating the teaching of R' Chisda; perhaps the Maharsha is only saying that he <em>reframed</em> it in terms of wine and beer for marketing reasons.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Great question, I would read the Maharsha differently and I think if you read the \"header\" of the Maharsha it is important (according to me). Why does the Maharsha include \"לאו מלתא היא וכו׳\". Why not JUST Rav Pappa. One reason is yours, another reason is that it bothered the Maharsha.</p>\n<p>You see the Gemara doesn't say Rav Pappa is outright wrong, it says there is a more important principle, to not destroy one's own body (See Meiri to 132b that Lav Milta He - does not entirely push off the Svra). Thus the Maharsha is explaining why Rav Pappa from his vantage point as a seller saw this act as a waste, since for him it is, but for others it is not because for them their body takes precedence. The \"waste\" depends on who you are in the conversation, this is what the Maharsha is pointing out.</p>\n<p>\"ורב פפא לטובת עצמו אמרה\" meaning for his own good he mentioned this, ie: from his perspective it was right to buy beer, the wine would not sour in casks. But from the buyers perspective the Gemara points out this is not their concern since they must not waste their bodies.</p>\n<p>Rav Pappa's logic is not wrong, imagine the wine was vinegary (and worse for him) or something about what he ate made the beer better for him, Rav Pappa would indeed be right.</p>\n<p>In fact maybe Rav Pappa saw that these people didn't take care of their health anyway. This would mean they might be blamed for letting beer go to waste since they cannot claim they were drinking wine for their health since they do worse then beer to their bodies anyway.</p>\n<p>A fascinating Gemara and Maharsha. Thank you</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ashkenazim eating kitniyot that is batel b'rov on Pesach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to various opinions, Ashkenazim may eat food that comprises kitniyot on Pesach (e.g., mixtures), if it is batel b'rov (see Peninei Halacha <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/category/pesah/09-kitniyot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). For example: foods comprising kitniyot additives are almost always batel b'rov, since additives are normally only added in small amounts. From what I understand from Rav Melamed, the flavour of the kitniyot-containing food is irrelevant, as is 1/60th, which is important in other areas of kashrut. The only factor is whether the kitniyot forms a majority or not. So included in this permission to eat kitniyot-containing food would be (for example) a cake comprising 49% corn flour (kitniyot) and 51% non-kitniyot ingredients, which Ashkenazim would be allowed to eat on Pesach.</p>\n<p>Primarily, this is allowed when the kitniyot-containing food is prepared <strong>before</strong> Pesach. There is a discussion about whether Ashkenazim observing the prohibition of kitniyot would be allowed to eat these products on Pesach if they were prepared on Pesach.</p>\n<p>Question: What are the various opinions regarding kitniyot products where the kitniyot is batel b'rov, if it was <strong>prepared on Pesach itself</strong>? Do any opinions permit a person who observes the kitniyot prohibition to eat, or even prepare, a kitniyot containing food dish <strong>on Pesach</strong> where the kitniyot is batel b'rov? Do those opinions consider this bediavad or lechatchila?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There's a well-known Rashba that we don't rely on <em>bitul b'rov</em> when the product is intentionally formulated that way.</p>\n<p>There's plenty of discussion on whether the halacha follows the Rashba year-round, but it's fairly safe to say that among Ashkenazim who don't eat kitniyot, the minhag has become to follow that Rashba vis-a-vis kitniyot on Pesach. The notion of \"bitul berov\" is generally discussed vis-a-vis kitniyot as \"what if something went wrong?\" ... \"what if something fell in by mistake.\" <em>Not</em> -- \"hooray let's go eat this cool cookie where the package says the ingredients are 49% rice and 51% tapioca.\"</p>\n<p>But the theory of <em>bitul berov</em> vis-a-vis kitniyot would apply on Pesach as well -- if somehow corn syrup leaked into your chicken soup or whatnot.</p>\n<p>I realize there are those in Israel who are trying to chip away at kitniyot from all angles, including using the rov argument ... but I'm speaking of normative Ashkenazi practice here.</p>\n<p>Also: this approach of telling people to go eat stuff that is 49% kitniyot only works if it has a \"kosher for Pesach for Sefardim\" hashgacha. If you're just reading the ingredients, there could totally be chametz in there.</p>\n<p>But to answer the question as phrased: suppose someone ignores the Rashba and thinks they have a license to eat something that is routinely made of 49% kitniyot. What about on Pesach itself? Well you'd have to ask Rabbi Melamed (or Rabbi Leshem, who has a similar opinion). But let's reason it out:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>To prepare such an item yourself -- pour corn flour into your recipe --  could get into the <em>ein mevatlin issur lechat'chila</em> territory -- do not intentionally cause a <em>bitul</em> situation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If you're buying an item in the shop, let's assume we follow the lenient opinion that it was not intentionally <em>mevutal</em> for any one Jew.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Why is chametz not batel on Pesach? Either because it has the serious punishment of <em>karet</em> (which kitniyot certainly don't), or because of a <em>davar sheyesh lo matirin</em> (it will be edible in a few days anyhow). If we follow the latter reason, one could potentially argue it would also be prohibited. (Then again it's hard to argue that kitniyot are actully <em>issur</em>, as someone non-life-threateningly ill could eat them right now. The enactment/custom only included able-bodied individuals.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Everyone gets sick, does that mean that a person is lacking in the gates of understanding?</p>\n<p><strong>Are there other explanations given for this Baal Shem Tov?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As per my comment above where I placed the link (see my comment above) I would like to translate, summarize and explain some ideas in order to make sense of this deep teaching of the Bal Shem Tov (sorry if its too long, I tried my best to shorten it as much as possible):</p>\n<p>The word וַיִּקְרָ֖א has a small aleph, why? The Bal Haturim explains, “the א of ויקרא is written as a small letter because Moshe wanted to write ויקר (and it happened), the way it is written regarding Bilaam, which implies God appeared to him only as a chance occurrence. God, however, told him to write the א which indicates His love, but Moshe made it small.” However why in Shemot 19:20 does the Torah use a regular aleph? In Shaar Hakavanot Inyan Mizmor Shir Shel Yom Hashabba page 66 it says that on Matan Torah Moshe merited to get 1000 lights (crowns) that's why in Shemot 19:20 there is a regular aleph (to show this idea), but when Bnei Yisrael sinned Hashem told Bnei Yisrael in Parshat Vayikra 1:1 to write Vayikra with an aleph and the interpretation will be that Moshe still has one light/crown with him, but Moshe in his humbleness wanted to diminish the letter in a sense to say that it was his fault because he accepted the Erev Rav which in effect caused the Cheit Haegel.</p>\n<p>In Rosh Hashana 21b it says, “The aforementioned verse states: “The words of the Lord are pure words…purified seven times [shivatayim].” Rav and Shmuel disagreed about a matter relating to this verse: One of them said: Fifty gates of understanding were created in the world, and all of them were given to Moses, except for one gate, for it is stated: “The words of the Lord are purified shivatayim,” which he understands to mean seven times seven, i.e., forty-nine, and it is stated: “And You have made him a little less than God” (Psalms 8:6). God created fifty gates of understanding, but He made man a little lower than God, giving him only forty-nine of them.”</p>\n<p>Why does the Gemera say 50 minus one and not just 49? In Lekutei Torah in Vaetchanan the Arizal explains that at Matan Torah Moshe Rabbeinu received the 50 gates of understanding and when the Cheit Haegel happened he told him לך רד, go down, and he lost only the 50th level (and Gematria of לך רד equals 50, meaning go down from the 50th level). We are told in the Gemera in Avodah Zara 5a it says, “Rabbi Yosei says: The Jewish people accepted the Torah only in order that the Angel of Death would not rule over them, as it is stated: “I said: You are godlike beings, and all of you sons of the Most High” (Psalms 82:6), i.e., they had become immortal like angels. Then, God states: After you ruined your deeds, “yet you shall die like a man, and fall like one of the princes” (Psalms 82:7).”  So when Moshe Rabbeinu received the 50 gates of understanding at Matan Torah, that 50th level was able to defeat the Malach Hamavet and cause no sickness or death to come to the world, however after Cheit Haegel when Moshe lost the 50th gate, sickness and death returned to the world.</p>\n<p>From within the 1000 lights within the 50th gate Moshe was left with one light where he was able to bring down healing to Bnei Yisrael. Now that Moshe is not with us how do we get healing? We know based on various sources mentioned in the link that whoever learns Torah which Moshe Rabbeinu gave over to us gets the one light of healing within the 50th gate that was with Moshe, and that brings all the healings that Bal Shem Tov spoke about.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's difficult to answer this mystical question, but I once saw in a sefer that the source of this Bal Shem Tov is a Gemara in Sanhedrin 101a (from sefaria),</p>\n<p>והלוחש על המכה וכו': אמר ר' יוחנן וברוקק בה לפי שאין מזכירין שם שמים על הרקיקה איתמר רב אמר אפילו נגע צרעת ר' חנינא אמר אפילו ויקרא אל משה</p>\n<p>The mishna teaches: And among those who have no share in the World-to-Come is one who whispers invocations over a wound. Rabbi Yoḥanan says: And that is the case only where he spits into the wound while he whispers, as one does not mention the name of Heaven over spittle, and doing so is an act of contempt for God. It was stated that Rav says: Even the verse: “When a leprous mark is in a man, then he shall be brought to the priest” (Leviticus 13:9), in which there is no mention of the name of God, may not be whispered as an invocation. Rabbi Chanina says: Even a verse that is unrelated to the specific illness in question, for example: “And He called to Moses” (Leviticus 1:1), may not be whispered as an invocationץ</p>\n<p>The Gemara seems to say clearly not like the Bal Shem Tov, and that this Passuk has no connection to רפואה. However the holy Bal Shem saw in his great wisdom that the Gemara was hinting that there is major source of healing power here, and who better to say that other then Rav Chanina himself which on whom the Gemara in Yoma 49a writes that he was a very big doctor (from sefaria)...</p>\n<p>וּמַאי שְׁנָא רַבִּי חֲנִינָא? מִשּׁוּם דְּבָקִי בִּרְפוּאוֹת הוּא. דְּאָמַר רַבִּי חֲנִינָא: מֵעוֹלָם לֹא שְׁאָלַנִי אָדָם עַל מַכַּת פִּרְדָּה לְבָנָה וְחָיָה.</p>\n<p>The Gemara asks: And if this was not a halakhic question but a medical one, what is different about this question that led him to ask it specifically of Rabbi Chanina? The Gemara explains: Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi asked Rabbi Chanina because he is an expert in medicines, as Rabbi Chanina said: No man ever consulted me about a wound inflicted by a white mule and recovered. This shows that people came to Rabbi Chanina for medical advice.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Daniel or Danel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>These days I saw an exegete argue that the Daniel in Ezekiel 14:14 and 28:3 does not refer to the Daniel of the homonymous book but to Danel of the Epic of Aqhat, who according to the Book of Jubilees would be the father-in-law of Enoch. He supports this thesis on the basis that in Ezekiel 14:14 Danel appears among non-Israelite characters, Noah and Job. He also maintains that the Hebrew text has two constructions, a defective writing דנאל and a full דניאל because of the \"Yud\" and that the text in question is a qere, that is, written is Danel but the Masoretes want us to read Daniel being a proposal to camouflage mythological aspects present in the text by inserting a more historical figure, this is his thesis, this he decoded from the BHS that refers to Masorah Parva that appears in the qere. This being, what would this impact on the text since there is this character appearing in Jewish tradition as Enoch's father-in-law?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As this question is still open, I will attempt to explain the issue. In the comments, you expressed relief when I mentioned that I knew of religious (Orthodox) Jews who saw no problem with Daniel of Ezekiel being identified with the Ugaritic Danel. However, I will emphasize again that this does not solve the problem. Unfortunately, I can refer to several religious Jews who hold several theologically-problematic views, particularly with regards to Tanach. I do not know what their answers will be once confronted with the theological question. In some cases, they might perhaps state that the 13 basics of faith are simply the Rambam's view and that not all rabbis agreed with him (cf. Rabbi Yosef Albo who thought that Mashiach is not a basic of faith).</p>\n<p>So, what exactly is the problem with Danel?</p>\n<p>As I stated in the comments and as stated also by Rabbi Klein in the essay referred to by @Shmuel and stated by others as well, such as Rabbi David Shapira in his book \"The Torah of Moshe and the Prophets\" (תורת משה והנביאים), p. 268, Danel is nothing more and nothing less than the average Canaanite idolater. He worships Canaanite deities. And this is supposedly the person Ezekiel wants the king of Tyre and later readers to look up to? Very strange conclusion.</p>\n<p>There are other flaws in this view as well. For example, the story of Danel has only been found on a single stone tablet so far. How does that prove that the story was popular enough that the king of Tyre, some 800-850 years later, knew it? Another flaw is that Danel is not described as a wise person. Only a single line may perhaps link him to wisdom, in that he was a fair and law-abiding judge who cared for the widows and the orphans. But law-abiding needn't necessarily equal wisdom.</p>\n<p>As for the apocryphal Daniel, Rabbi Shapira wrote that the problem with the names that appear in the apocrypha is that many times they were invented by the writers. I don't know how he knows that, though. In any case, this Daniel seems equally irrelevant: He was Enoch's father-in-law, and that's it. We know nothing about his wisdom or any other character traits. Was he even a righteous person? How do we know the king of Tyre knew who he was?</p>\n<p>And with regards to the specific person you're referring to, I have no idea what this person actually said/wrote about the Masoretes, but the Masoretes did not invent tradition. They assisted in setting a unified standard out of variant traditions. We may therefore assume that דנאל was the most common spelling in the Book of Ezekiel and דניאל was the most common pronunciation. So this is not some dark Masoretic conspiracy. It's something older. Perhaps it is difficult to argue that the דנאל referred to here is Daniel of the Book of Daniel, but it is also difficult and even problematic to argue that it is the Danel of Ugarit. Some have proposed that it's Daniel/Kilav, one of David's sons, but this is a very midrashic-based understanding and is also flawed. There are a couple of other Daniels mentioned in Tanach, though neither with the spelling דנאל. Either of these could also work just as well as the apocrphyal Daniel, given that they are only mentioned in one verse each and we only know a crumb of biographical info about them.<br />\nWho knows, it may very well be none of these and simply a person we are not familiar with from anywhere else in Tanach.</p>\n<p>In short, both of these suggestions are flawed, as is the apparent claim that the Masoretes changed the way the text was to be read (strange that they didn't change the way the text was to be spelled!).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Let me give you an detailed look into some things you mention in the original question.

As a result, explains R.

    "content": "# 955 Gates of Heaven - תתקנ\"ה רקיעים\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have come across the concept of \"955 Gates of Heaven\". I know it is currently doing the rounds with regards to a controversy, and thus I heard it in a news article, but have had trouble finding any information about it.</p>\n<p>So far <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maaseh_Rokeach_on_Mishnah%2C_Seder_Kodashim%2C_Kinnim.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> is the only (legitimate) reference I can find. Has anyone got a more detailed source for me to look up (from traditional/orthodox/authentic sources only please)? Even better, an introduction, systematization, context and derivation. Best of all, some sort of explanation, jargon-reduced/free?</p>\n<p>EDIT: <a href=\"https://shvilei.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/translation-devarim-57732.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Another lead</a> (thanks @Shmuel):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Avraham Galanti in Kol Bochim (Eichah 2, 21), that there are\n955 firmaments. This number corresponds to the numerical value  of the\nword ם“השמי ,meaning the heavens.

After all this toil, You tell me behold, your days have drawn near? … One thing I ask of You before my death: that I may enter, and that all the gates of the heavens and the depths be split open, so that it will be seen that there is none besides You.”</p>\n<p>We find an indication that the Holy One indeed granted this request.\n<a href=\"https://chareidi.org/archives5775/devorim/fsrgintidvr75.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Galanti</a>, in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/183403/p/45/t/0.70479245304660151234/fs/m_uvWV1SbAXd9PeMYrXWrVXT0Z7QNQeAKZzzGy1XdhKS/start/792/end/806/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kol Bochim</a>, writes that there are 955 firmaments, corresponding to the numerical value of hashamayim (“the heavens”) [counting the final mem as 600]. The angel Metatron elevates the prayers of Israel through these 955 firmaments. However, he only has permission to ascend with the prayers through 900 of them — but not within the upper 55 firmaments. From there, the prayers ascend on their own, without any angel, until they reach before the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>\n<p>The Ma’aseh Rokeach adds:\nIt is written in the Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.15a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 15a</a>) that when Elisha ben Avuya entered the Pardes, he “cut the plantings” — saying that there are two authorities — because he saw the angel Metatron, to whom was given permission to record the merits of Israel. He said: Perhaps there are two authorities!\nIt follows that within the 900 firmaments, where Metatron has permission to go, there is a possibility that a person might mistakenly think (Heaven forbid) of two authorities. But within the upper 55 firmaments, to which he has no permission to ascend, the unity of G-d is revealed.</p>\n<p>For this reason, Moshe Rabbeinu composed the book of Devarim with exactly 955 verses, and in each verse he intended to pierce through one firmament, so that by the end of the book all 955 firmaments would be split open — so that Israel would see that God is one and there is none besides Him.</p>\n<p>Up until the verse \"See now that I, I am He\" there are exactly 900 verses, corresponding to the 900 firmaments. And from that verse until the end of the Torah, there are 55 verses, corresponding to the upper 55 firmaments. Thus the verse may be understood: “See now that I” — from this verse onward, which corresponds to the first of the 55 upper firmaments — “I am He” alone in these firmaments, “and there is no god with Me” — even the angel Metatron, who is sometimes called by the title “god” (elohim), has no permission to be there.</p>\n<p>From this we can explain the custom to read the book of Devarim on the night of Hoshanah Rabbah: Hoshanah Rabbah is the completion of the judgment-seal (gmar hachasimah), the fitting time to pierce all 955 firmaments so that our prayers ascend to the Throne of Glory. This is accomplished through the reading of the 955 verses of the book of Devarim.</p>\n<p>The number 55 firmaments to which no angel has permission to go is alluded to in the Midrash: “Behold, it is a people that shall dwell alone” — what is behold (hen)? All the letters of the alphabet are paired except for these two letters. How so? Aleph–tet = 10, bet–chet = 10, gimel–zayin = 10, dalet–vav = 10 — the letter hei remains by itself. Likewise, the letter nun has no partner: yud–tzadi = 100, kaf–pei = 100, lamed–ayin = 100, mem–samech = 100 — the nun remains by itself. The Holy One said: Just as these two letters (hei and nun) cannot pair with any others but stand alone, so too Israel cannot attach themselves to the nations of the world, but remain alone and distinct. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.15.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 15:7</a>)</p>\n<p>It is thus explained that the letters hei and nun (hen) are the letters of singularity, and therefore in the 55 (nun–hei) firmaments, the Holy One alone is above — just as Israel, the hen people, dwell alone below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I also found mention of similar themes in the Bnei Yissaschar <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/602259/p/34/t/0.70479245304660151234/fs/m_lQa4MgCQ8PKAOahoJib3gNPYeWZ3LSXM7jvhkittU0/start/974/end/1004/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting the <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/63086/p/86/t/0.70479245304660151234/fs/m_aevfdCRkVx8ZQOQHdGQ7OsNADaKisjIDTMs3iTxRFZ/start/224/end/236/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Sho'eg Aryeh (#371)</a> by <a href=\"https://www.geni.com/people/Grand-Rabbi-Arye-Leibish-Halberstam-of-Zhmigrod/6000000001877415916\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Aryeh Leibush Halberstam zt\"l</a> (the second <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanz#Zhmigrod\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zhmigroder</a> Rebbe) which articulates a similar idea but quotes other sources.</p>\n<p>It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this is what is written (Deuteronomy 32:39): “See now that I, I am He, and there is no god with Me; I put to death and I bring to life; I have struck down and I will heal.”</p>\n<p>For it is written in the Rikanati that there are 955 firmaments (heavens). And the holy Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria) gave a mnemonic for this: Bereishis bara Elokim et hashamayim — “the heavens” (hashamayim) [when written] with the final mem closed is numerically 955. This is because a closed mem (ם) is counted as six hundred. Thus it adds up to 955, for the letter tav is 400, and then come the “final” letters (mantzepach) which are the doubled forms of certain letters. Therefore the final kaf (ך) is 500, the final mem (ם) is 600, the final nun (ן) is 700, the final pe (ף) is 800, and the final tzadi (ץ) is 900. After that, the letters cycle back to aleph, which is one, bet two, and so on — understand this well.</p>\n<p>And it is written in the aforementioned Rikanati that in the [first] 900 firmaments there are also angels. However, in the final 55 firmaments no angel or seraph is permitted to enter — only the Holy One, blessed be He, is there alone, for there is the realm of Atzilut (Divine Emanation). And this is what is meant by (Deut. 10:14): “Behold, to the Lord your God belong the heavens” — the word “behold” (hen) has the numerical value of 55, meaning that in these 55 firmaments (hen) they are for the Lord alone, as stated above.</p>\n<p>And behold, Moshe our teacher, peace be upon him, requested from the Holy One, blessed be He, permission to recite 955 verses — which correspond to the 955 firmaments that the Holy One created. And indeed, from the beginning of the book of Deuteronomy until this verse, See now that I, I am He, there are 900 verses; and from this verse See now… until the end of the book, there are 55 verses, corresponding to those 55 firmaments mentioned above.</p>\n<p>And this is what the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him: When you have reached those [final] firmaments, See now that I, I am He, and there is no god with Me — that is, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.35?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Deuteronomy.4.35.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains on the verse (Deut. 4:35) “You have been shown to know” in the portion of Va’eschanan: that He opened up for them the seven heavens and they saw that He alone rules — meaning, He showed him that in these 55 firmaments there is no angel called “god” (elohim). See also the Ramak in Yisro on the verse “You shall have no other gods”, where he writes that only “I [alone]” am there, for there is no judgement there, and everything is directed toward goodness: I put to death for the ultimate purpose, and I bring to life, etc.</p>\n<p>And as the Torah says: “And you shall know that the Lord, He is God” — for in truth the attribute of judgment is pure mercy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>“And He said to him, ‘So shall your offspring be!’”</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beinenu.com/system/files/alonim/65_03_78.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HKB”H Elevated Avraham above the 55 Firmaments\nWhere even the Malach Matat Is not Allowed to Go</a></p>\n<p>“He explains, based on the writings of the divine kabbalist Rabbi Avraham Galanti in Kol Bochim (Eichah 2:21), that there are 955 firmaments.

He is not permitted to enter the uppermost firmaments—the upper 55 firmaments; the tefilos must ascend to Hashem from there on their own, without the accompaniment of a malach. This is implied by the passuk (Devarim 10:14)… In other words, of all the 955 firmaments, 55—‘ה״ן’—are reserved for Hashem, your G-d, exclusively.”</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Book of Devarim – Piercing All the Heavens</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bahazit.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/4_5828017617033497705.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">From the teachings of the Rebbe Rabbi Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto, shlit”a</a></p>\n<p>It is brought in the Midrash (Devarim Rabbah 11:8) that when the time came for Moshe Rabbeinu to depart from this world, the Holy One, blessed be He, said to him (Devarim 31:14): “Behold, your days are approaching.” Moshe said before Him: “Master of the universe! After all this effort, You say to me, ‘Behold, your days are approaching’? [But I said:] ‘I shall not die but live, and declare the deeds of the Lord’ (Psalms 118:17).” He replied to Moshe: “You cannot [avoid death], for this is the fate of all mankind.”</p>\n<p>Moshe said, “Master of the universe, I request one thing before my death: that I may enter [heaven] and all the gates of heaven and the depths be opened, so it may be seen that there is none besides You.”</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>The angel Metatron raises all the prayers of Israel through these 955 firmaments (Tataqneh), yet even he is not permitted to enter the final 55 upper heavens. There, the prayers rise on their own before the Holy One, blessed be He, without the aid of any angel.</p>\n<p>This is what is meant in the verse (Devarim 10:14): “Behold, to the Lord your God belong the heavens, the highest heavens, the earth and all that is in it.” The term “behold” (hen) corresponds to these 955 heavens (as the word “heavens” in Hebrew, with a final mem, is numerically equal to 955).</p>\n<p>[…]</p>\n<p>Thus, Moshe Rabbeinu, may peace be upon him, before his passing, sought to pierce through the 955 heavens with his words in Sefer Devarim (the Book of Deuteronomy). It is explained that up until the verse “See now that I, I am He” (Devarim 32:39), there are exactly 500 verses—corresponding to the 500 accessible heavens. From that verse to the end of the Torah, there are 55 verses, matching the 55 uppermost heavens to which even angels have no access, and only God Himself is present.</p>\n<p>Therefore, each verse Moshe spoke in Sefer Devarim had the power to open one gate in the heavens. This is the spiritual force of the book, and this is why great tzaddikim recommend reading it—especially during times of distress or before Rosh Hashanah—to break barriers and draw divine mercy.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Could הָעַלְמָ֗ה in Isaiah 7:14, be a reference to Zion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>According to John R. W. Stott (NT),\"The Message of Isaiah\", הָעַלְמָ֗ה in Isaiah 7:14, is a symbol for Zion:</strong></p>\n<p><em>In chapter 7 we see him doing this to Ahaz. Ahaz has rejected the clear word of\nthe prophet (7-9) and the offer of a clear sign to confirm it (10-12). Therefore he\nis given a sign which is veiled and enigmatic, a sign which he cannot understand\n(13-16).\nBut the sign is not meaningless. It can be understood, but only from the\nperspective of faith, and again chapter 6 provides the key. The final verse of that\nchapter spoke of a righteous remnant, a ‘holy seed’, that would survive the\ncoming judgment. At the beginning of chapter 7 Isaiah is pointedly told to take\nhis son Shear-Jashub with him as he goes to meet Ahaz (3). ‘Shear-Jashub’\nmeans ‘a remnant shall return’ or ‘a remnant shall repent’. Both are possible,\n99\nbut since the immediate context here is one of faith versus unbelief rather than\nexile and return, the latter meaning is almost certainly the primary one.\n100 Isaiah\ncomes to challenge Ahaz to repent and join the remnant who believe, but he\nrefuses. The Immanuel saying of verse 14 is therefore given to Ahaz as a veiled\nmessage of judgment.\nZion has already been pictured as a woman (literally, ‘daughter Zion’) in\n1:8. Now, in the crisis of invasion and imminent siege, she is depicted as a\nsexually mature woman (literally, ‘young woman’, ‘almâ) who has already\nconceived and is even now in the pains of childbirth. The central statement of\nverse 14 is literally: ‘The young woman has conceived and is giving birth to a\nson…’ If the ‘young woman’ is Zion, then her son is the faithful remnant who\nwill emerge from her sufferings.\n101 That is why he is given the name Immanuel,\n‘God with us’. God will be with the faithful remnant who gather round Isaiah (cf\n8:16), not with the unbelieving Ahaz and the rebellious nation as a whole. This is\nthe implication of the ominous shift from ‘your God’ in verse 11 to my God in\nverse 13.The rest of the chapter unfolds in explicit terms the threat implied in the\nImmanuel saying. The image of the ‘son’ or child, however, continues only to\nthe end of verse 16.\n102 By the time this child has reached an age of accountability\n(within a few years at the most), the land will have been so devastated and\ndepopulated by Assyria that cultivation will be impossible; the survivors will\nhave to exist on the products of the few animals they have and any wild food\nthey can gather (15a, 17-25). But even before this (16a), the land of the two\nkings presently invading Judah will be deserted. In fact, Syria fell to the\nAssyrians in 732 BC ,\n103 followed by Israel in 722\nBC .\n104 Finally, Judah herself\nwas all but devastated in 701 BC .\n105\nBut the Immanuel sign contained a promise as well as a threat. For Isaiah\nand his followers it meant the promise of God’s protecting presence and the\neventual fulfilment of God’s good purposes for his people. The preservation of\nthe remnant in Isaiah’s day was part of a process which led finally to the coming\nof Jesus, the perfectly faithful and righteous one,\n106 in whom all God’s promises\ncome to fulfilment.\n107 So Matthew was right to see the ultimate fulfilment of the\nImmanuel saying in Jesus Christ.\n108 What was death to Ahaz is life to us who\nbelieve.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Does his interpretation make any sense?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>John R. W. Stott completely disregards Isaiah 7:16, literally two verses later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>16 חֶמְאָ֥ה וּדְבַ֖שׁ יֹאכֵ֑ל לְדַעְתּ֛וֹ מָא֥וֹס בָּרָ֖ע וּבָח֥וֹר בַּטּֽוֹב <br/>For, when the lad does not yet know to reject bad and choose good, the land whose two kings you dread, shall be abandoned.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where the <em>actual</em> proof is that the before the child has even gotten old enough to know good from bad the two kings will have already been defeated (rather than the woman being pregnant), which is a clear discussion grounded in something that Ahaz can see. Instead, John R. W. Stott invents his own story and bases his entire proof of Jesus on that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...the land will have been so devastated and depopulated by Assyria that cultivation will be impossible...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would say that this is nonsensical Christian apologetics trying to make sense of a mangled interpretation in order to justify their own mistaken beliefs rather than anything resembling a scholarly analysis of the verse.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, if a \"holy book\" completely contradicts itself by butchering its own proof-texts and lying to you about their translation and context, you need to ask yourself: is this really a \"holy\" book at all?</p>\n\n\n",

Probably one of the most common cases of this is <em>vayomer</em>. E.g., right off the bat in Gen 1:3:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EcXJU.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/EcXJU.png\" alt=\"vayomer in pointed Hebrew\" /></a></p>\n<p>I cover this behavior more deeply in <a href=\"https://bdenckla.github.io/Taamey_D/#h2_floating_xolam_xaser\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">my documentation for my Taamey D font</a>, but I think you get the idea.</p>\n<p>My question is, does anyone know of a source (or authority) for doing this? (I.e., what's a source other than BHS and the fonts that mimic it.) Do other printed editions do this? None in my small collection do. Perhaps more importantly, are the great medieval manuscripts (L, A, etc.) thought to do this? When I look at L, for example, it seems it does this, but maybe I'm just seeing what I want to see. It is a little hard to tell which letter the dot belongs to, because, fundamentally I think, it belongs to neither: it belongs somewhere in between. I guess the question is: is its position, on average, \"later,\" when it appears between some consonant and a non-consonant <em>alef</em>? And if it is, on average, \"later,\" is it fair to assume this was scribal intention and not chance?</p>\n<p>Also, what are the pros and cons of interpreting this not as a \"late\" <em>ḥolam ḥaser</em> dot but as a <em>ḥolam male</em> dot on <em>alef</em>? I.e., are there at least some circumstances in which instead of interpreting this dot as implying a \"missing\" <em>vav</em>, it is better to interpret this dot as qualifying what kind of <em>alef</em> we're looking at, just as a <em>ḥolam male</em> dot qualifies what kind of a <em>vav</em> we're looking at?</p>\n\n\n",

The heart is in the upper part of the body and towards the middle, the liver is below it and to the right while the spleen is below and to the left. The liver symbolizes Eisav’s spiritual source, which is called “Edom” because the liver is entirely saturated with blood [dam]. For this reason Eisav himself is also referred to as Edom. Moreover, his food was red [adom], his guardian angel is Adom and his character is permeated with the attribute of judgment. <strong>The spleen symbolizes the wicked Lilis</strong> and the heart symbolizes the holy people Israel who are holy to their God. For this reason the heart receives only the most refined and pure portion of the blood, distinguishing between one type of blood and another, that is, between menstrual blood and blood that is pure. The liver, by contrast, draws towards it all the impure blood and makes no difference between one type and another. The liver is always in a state of anger. Therefore the Sages have said (Zohar, 1:27b; Part 3:179a) that whoever becomes angry is deemed as if he worshipped idols. For I have already noted (Chapter 68) that anger derives from the liver and that it represents the influence of the Samech Mem (SME”L) who is referred to as, “other gods.” <strong>The spleen represents the influence of the Lilis, whose strategy is to appear to a man at night in a dream and in the daytime in the form of a woman until she succeeds in causing him to spill his seed. For this reason the spleen is also the source of laughter (Berachos 61b).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Intriguing question!\nAfter doing some research I found that this topic is really connected to Purim (but for that you can look at the links posted below :)</p>\n<p>Although there is a lot to discuss, I will summarize the basic idea I see people bring up (in the links posted below) and as well as add some of my own explanations within:</p>\n<p>The spleens (טחול) function is to clean and remove old or damaged blood red and white cells from our body. It does this by using something called macrophages which are white blood cells which destroy the unhealthy red blood cells into nothingness.\nBased on this, the idea that I saw a lot of people say is that שחוק is a lashon of שחיקת סממנים, like in the pasuk וְשָֽׁחַקְתָּ֣ מִמֶּ֘נָּה֮ הָדֵק֒, \"Beat some of it into powder.” And what is this lashon exactly? It means, any sort of פירור (crumbs), to take something that is one, and break it into tiny and thin pieces, that is basically שחיקת סממנים. This is the idea in Pesachim 21a of מפרר וזורה לרוח, meaning “crumble the chametz and throw it into the wind or cast it into the sea,” or like we say in Bitul chametz וליהוי הפקר כעפרא דארעא, that “it should be hefker and dust of the land.” So this means that when I שחוק something, I crumble or break it up until I nullify it. Thus when we put both words and ideas together it means, the spleen destroys/beats/breaks.</p>\n<p>Now the Gemera in Brachot 31a says that אסור לאדם שימלא פיו שחוק בעולם הזה, one is not allowed to fill up his mouth with laughter in this world. This refers to שחוק הכסיל, which the Pardes Rimonim 23:9:11 (written by the Ramak) says that שחוק הכסיל refers to טְחוֹל שׂוֹחֵק as well. How so? There are two types of שׂוֹחֵק: One is שחוק הכסיל which is laughter of the foolish, and the second one is שחוק הצדיקים (which we won't focus on now). שחוק הכסיל is a power referred to as ליצנות, in all ליצנות (craziness or funniness) the one laughing is laughing (most of the time) because there is no reality of it being מקיום (existing in reality). A great line I saw in the article (which could be argued about) said, ליצנות מהדבר, זה השחוק ופירור של הדבר, היא אי-נתינת קיום של הדבר, meaning, “the funny thing of the matter, is the destroying and crumbling of the matter, it is making the matter not exist or in reality.” This means that when one laughs and finds something funny, most of the time one laughs because the person saying something “funny” is describing a reality which does not exist, so in other words when one says something funny he is destroying the reality.</p>\n<p>How does this connect to Lilit? In the Pardes Rimonim (ibid) he says,  כן ביאר הרשב\"י ע\"ה בר\"מ (פנחס דף רמ\"ד.) וז\"ל מארת חסר ו' ודא לילית דאיהי ממנא דההוא עושק ואיהי איקרי טחול ואיהי אזלת וחייכת בינוקא ולבתר עבדת בהו רוגזא ודמעא למבכי עלייהו. Which means: “Rebbi Shimon Bar Yochai in Zohar Pinchas 244a that the word מארת is missing a vav (the pasuk he refers to I think is in Beresheit 1:14 when HaShem is creating the luminaries, their is a missing vav and it should have said מאורת). This is lilit which from her came the oppression (pain) and she is called טחול (spleen). She goes and harms children and then children cry because of it (as Rashi says on Wednesdays this happens). Maybe based on this we can say she is called spleen because although the spleen destroys which is good for our body (as explained above), Lilit does a type of destruction which is not beneficial for anyone, and actually harms children. (I hope this all makes sense).\nHere are the links I was referring to throughout, enjoy :)\n<a href=\"https://www.dirshu.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%91%D7%99.%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F_207_%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%90%D7%96%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95_%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%91.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.dirshu.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/בלבבי.עלון_207_פרשת_האזינו_תשפב.pdf</a>\n<a href=\"https://bilvavi.net/shiur/%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%9A-001-%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://bilvavi.net/shiur/דעאתשמחתך-001-חודשאדרשחוק</a></p>\n\n\n",

My question is, how can Chachmim put a price tag on stealing mitzvot? How can we limit that number to 10 zehuvim, each mitzvah has a different value, yet we also know the Mishnah in Pirkei Avot 2:1 that אֵין אַתָּה יוֹדֵעַ מַתַּן שְׂכָרָן שֶׁל מִצְוֹת, \"you don't know the reward for mitzvot?</p>\n<p>(10 zehuvim according to Rav Chaim Noeh (Shiurei Torah p. 379 ch. 3 n. 45) is 250 silver dinar which are 1200 grams of silver which when using Torah calc: <a href=\"https://torahcalc.com/unitcharts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://torahcalc.com/unitcharts/</a> is roughly 871 USD)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Giving the 10 zehuvim is described as a \"קנס\", a fine as a punishment for the person who took the mitzvah.

The fine depends on the character and behaviour of the person who stole, not on the mitzvah itself stolen or the damage done to the person who lost the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>This is also implicit in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=31&daf=87&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos on Chullin 87a DH V'chaivo</a>. Tosfos raises the possibility of direct restitution for the mitzvah which would ensure that the same reward for the mitzvah is got by the person. However, this possibility is rejected by Tosfos because it would be a different (performance of the same) mitzvah: what's implicitly at issue is that someone has committed the sin of stealing a mitzvah which must then be punished. Tosfos explains that it is not possible to make up for the value of the stolen mitzvah itself by giving back the mitzvah. What's not at issue is the loss of value from not performing the mitzvah, but the offence of stealing. The Rosh also holds like this in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37967&st=&pgnum=385\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 6:8:1</a>, \"אלא זו מצוה אחרת היא ומצוה ראשונה אזדא לה ומעוות <strong>לא יוכל לתקו</strong>ן\": we are not able to correct this, which excludes any possibility of determining the value of the mitzvah in order to correct it and make precise restitution for it. The damage is done and it is in the past.</p>\n<p>The Ramban (and Rashba) on this Gemara also say that, for these purposes there are no mitzvos greater or lesser than another, but they are all equal; \"וכולן שכרן זהובים שאין שמין את המצות להקל ולהחמיר <strong>אלא כולן כך שכ</strong>\". This is seen in the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.91b.13-16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 91b</a>, where the same baraita is also cited and applied to a variety of different mitzvos all of which receive the same 10 zehuvim.</p>\n<p>In short, the payment of 10 zehuvim is a fine and a kind of compensation but it is not a reimbursement for the loss of the mitzvah which cannot be rectified. It depends on the character of the thief, not on the value of the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>Sorry if any of my language there was a bit imprecise, but I think it gets the idea across.</p>\n\n\n",

However, they are given the name \"Ben Avraham Avinu/bat Sarah Immenu\" which makes them stand out and is a constant reminder as well as revelation to everyone who hears it that they are a convert.</p>\n<p>What am I missing here? Would it be possible to leave out the Avinu/Immenu either officially or unofficially, such as when called to Torah or when they tell people casually? Could they lie about their name altogether as even \"Ben Avraham/Bat Sarah\" might raise suspicions, especially if they look a little/lot different?</p>\n<p>Would they be allowed to leave it out of documents like a ketuba?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Bava Metzia is talking about <em>ona'at devarim</em> -- verbal abuse. <em>Ona'a</em> from the same root as <em>koneh</em> (I think that's R' Hirsch) -- I want to <em>dominate</em> that person and make them feel \"less than.\" So I'll say -- <em>how dare you speak up? You used to worship idols!</em> or <em>you should be thanking us to be allowed in here; your grandparents were Nazis</em> or <em>why should we allow someone into our yeshiva who used to do every possible noxious thing?</em></p>\n<p>There's also the crucial, crucial distinction between \"what's necessary to be made known to everyone, all the time\" and mental convolutions of trying to hide a basic truth. A convert doesn't have to walk around in shul with a giant neon sign saying \"HI I'M JOE I'M A CONVERT\" ... but if someone astute picks up that they're a Jew-by-choice, that's fine.

See, for example Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 150:13, Mishneh Torah Issurei Biya 21:12.</p>\n<p>I saw a comment a long time ago in a halacha sefer that I can no longer find, which was verbatim: <em>\"It is absolutely forbidden to engage in intimacy under the influence of narcotics\"</em>.</p>\n<p>Can anyone find the source of this?

Issurei Biya 21:12.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam does not use the word אסור (forbidden) as he does by the case of thinking of another woman, rather he uses לֹא - i.e. \"should not\", which indicates that we are not dealing with an outright prohibition.</p>\n<p>In the continuation of the halakhah there, the Rambam describes the anticipated outcome for the children of such a union:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם עשה כן--הבנים אינן הגונים, אלא מהן עזי פנים, ומהן מורדים ופושעים</p>\n<p>If he does so, the children will not be of proper character. There\nwill be those who are brazen and others who are rebellious and sinful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This parallels the sugya of בני תשע מידות (children born of nine attributes) in Nedarim 20b. This indicates that we are dealing with character development more than outright issur (prohibition) per se. I say this not to undermine the gravity with which the exhortation should be taken, rather to put it in its proper context.</p>\n<p>For confirmation of this, the Yam Shel Shelomo (Yebhamoth 22) wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרמב\"ם השמיט בן הנדה מט' מידות שהרי הוא בא מאיסורי כרת ואינו דומה לכל\nאינך שאין בהן איסור ממש אלא שפוגמי' הולד</p>\n<p>The Rambam omitted the one concieved from a niddah from the nine\ntraits for it is generated from the prohibition incurring kareth and\nis not similar to all the rest which do not involve an actual\nprohibition (issur mamash) but rather are the cause of defect to offspring</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that we are talking about Hazalic prescriptions in aid of the cultivation of ethical perfection, it is proper to explore wherein lies the failing in engaging in relations whilst intoxicated.</p>\n<p>The Lebhush OH 240:3 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שכרות אין בהם כוונת אהבה</p>\n<p>Those that are intoxicated do not have the intent of love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which is to say, that while one's mind is in a state of stupefaction it is not a genuine union of partners but rather errs more to the simple satisfaction of base desire.</p>\n<p>The Raban ha-Yarhi on Kallah wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בני ישינה אין לה כוונת המצוה והיא כשכרות</p>\n<p>The reason against those conceived by slumbered relations is due to\nthe lack of intent to perform the commandment, just as by\nintoxication.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though he frames it slightly different about what the positive intent should be, it seems clear that it is agreed that a lack of intent is what is problematic about engaging in relations while intoxicated. Leaving just the satisfaction of lust at play rather than anything that transcends it.</p>\n<p>R. Teherani, 'Amude Mishpat, vol. 1, no. 8 makes this more explicit and states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בני שכרות ביאתו לאו ביאה גמורה אלא כביאת זנות היא שאין זה מתכוין ...\nלשם מה בועל אותה אלא רק כדי למלאות תאות יצרו והוי כזנות</p>\n<p>Relations of intoxication are not complete relations, rather they are\nthe relations of licentiousness because the person does not have\nintent... for what does he engage in relations with her? for none\nother than to satisfy his desire, and so it is like licentiousness</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As regards tipsy vs outright drunk and this intoxicant vs another intoxicant, I think that there is a great degree of subjectivity in all this and one must take great stock of themselves in order to be sure they are capable and ready to engage in relations with the proper intentions in mind. I don't think a measurement for שכרות in this matter is a quantifiable measurement of liquid volume or pharmaceutical dosage, rather it would be a function of taking personal stock. A person must look within and make the determination about the propriety of engaging in relations at that moment. Under the influence of the intoxicant, is the person just seeking to objectify the other partner in order to satisfy their base desire? Or do they want to join together with their partner with the intent of love, marital duty, commandment? Its obviously not a strict binary and operates along a spectrum, which is why it is notable that the Rambam includes this halakhah in H. De'oth 5:4-5 as regards the proper conduct of a talmid hakham (wise student). Its place there demonstrating that this is an area within which one can work and attain lesser or greater degrees of perfection. Again, I think the key to it is taking a genuine look within before proceeding.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Let us divide the question into two parts, what is the point at which one has drunk too much alcohol where it is recommended to avoid intimacy? Is there a difference between Alcohol and other substances in this area?</p>\n<p>The Gemora in Nedarim 20B discusses instances in which it is better to avoid intimacy with one's spouse. For example, when there is fear, when the husband has decided to already divorce his wife, or when he or she is drunk. This is also cited by Rambam and Shulchan Aruch. Rashi and others explain that in these cases there is a disconnection between the spouses. Their heart might not be all in to what’s going on and in tune with their spouse.</p>\n<p>There are different levels of drunkenness in Halacha. The lowest level is after a cup of wine, after which a Kohen may not serve in the Beis Hamikdash. The highest level of drunk is like Lot, who had no sense of what was going on, and any damaging actions are considered an Oness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna Berura o.c. Siman 240 S.k. 18 says:</p>\n<p>שכרות - הוא או היא שכורה. ומסתברא דדוקא נתבלבל דעתו מחמת שכרות ולא\nבששתה רביעית Drunkenness- If He or She is drunk- it is logical when\ntheir mind is no longer able to think clearly because of the\nDrunkenness and not just when they drank a cup of wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In simple English: when the frontal cortex (the logic part of the brain) is no longer in control and is ‘offline’. Decisions are then made by the limbic system, which is in control of the emotional responses. Quick test: when someone who irritates you, irritates you usually you walk away and ignore them, after X amount of alcohol you really respond to them angrily- That X is the amount which I would say is when the frontal cortex is no longer in control and intimacy would be discouraged.</p>\n<p>Is there a difference with the way we view drugs and alcohol in Halacha?</p>\n<p>According to Reb Shlomo Zalman Aurbach in ערכי רפואה page 223, there is no difference between the alcohol and drugs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצד הסברא חושבני שגם מי שכבר נמכר לסמים הרי הוא רק כשיכור הצריך תמיד\nליין, ואף גם בסמים בין עישון לעישון שפיר חשיב לדינא כפקח אף שהוא מכור\nהרבה וחשוד גם לגנוב ולגזול למלא תאותו לקנות בהם סמים אבל מ\"מ שוטה מיהא\nלא הוה ', ומ\"מ דבר זה איכא לברורי Someone who is addicted to drugs is\nthe same as if he is addicted to alcohol. When he is sober he is\nconsidered like a normal person, unless his addiction causes him to\nsteal in order to obtain more drugs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>משפטי דעת ר' משה פרבשטיין page 98</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא מצאנו במקורות התייחסות מפורשת לשיבוש הדעת הנובע מהשפעת סמים\nותרופות, אבל ברור שיש להקיש וללמוד את דין המסומם מדין השיכור, ולא מדין\nהשוטה. שהרי אין כל הבדל מחמת איזה סם נשתבשה דעתו, האם מחמת היין או כל\nסם אחר. לפיכך דיניו של המסומם לענין תוקף מעשיו, מעמדו וחיוביו, יהיו\nשוים לדיני השיכור We did not find explicit references in the sources\nto the impairment of judgment resulting from the influence of drugs\nand medications, but it is clear that one should equate and apply the\nlaw applicable to an intoxicated person, not the law applicable to a\nmentally ill person. There is no distinction based on which substance\naffected their judgment, whether it was alcohol or any other drug.\nTherefore, the legal status of an intoxicated person regarding the\nvalidity of their actions, their standing, and liabilities shall be\nequivalent to those of a drunk person.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also sefer רפואה אתיקה והלכה in volume 1 page 220 there is a similar language used. From these sources, it is clear that Halacha does not make a distinction between drugs and alcohol in regard to mental clarity.</p>\n<p>Therefore dosages of drugs in order to help someone deal with pain or other medical needs we would view it like alcohol. If the logical part of the brain is still in charge of their actions there would be no problem of intimacy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I read this question basically as what is the halachic definition of intoxication\nThe degree of impairment required to be considered \"intoxicated\" is a matter of debate among halachic authorities, and there is no clear consensus on the issue. However, many authorities agree that even a small amount of alcohol or other intoxicating substance can impair a person's judgment and ability to reason, and can therefore render them \"intoxicated\" for the purposes of halacha.</p>\n<p>Some halachic authorities also take into account the person's intent and level of control over their drinking. For example, a person who drinks to the point of intoxication deliberately may be held more accountable for their actions than someone who became intoxicated unintentionally.</p>\n<p>See specifically Iggrot Moshe, Even HaEzer 1:69 who states that even a small amount of alcohol can impair a person's judgment and ability to reason, and can therefore render them \"intoxicated\" for the purposes of halacha.</p>\n<p>see Minchat Shlomo, Volume 2, Siman 60:2 who discusses the level of intent required for intoxication</p>\n<p>more broadly the prohibition against using drugs for non-medical purposes is found in Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh De'ah 155:3.</p>\n\n\n",

That is what Hashem wants to see, that we sacrifice that part of our inner self. Our most inner thoughts. That is why this refers to hidden, because that part is mostly hidden (to outsiders).

Rabbi Shammi Gross rules in a similar fashion.<br />\nI find it understandable why it would be assur on Pesach to have Hanaah. Can anyone explain please the understanding of the Hidabrot and why it would be allowed? There is still a problem of Hanaah from Chometz on Pesach!<br />\nAlthough this is related but not the same question: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/56897/what-can-i-feed-my-fish-over-pesach\">What can I feed my fish over Pesach?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would have assumed it refers to something that is so disgusting that a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/56292/regarding-chametz-what-is-considered-not-fit-to-be-eaten-by-a-dog\">dog wouldn't eat it</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The שו\"ע in או\"ח תמב and other places in הלכות פסח brings down a מחלוקת about whether or not there is ביטול ברוב of mixtures from before פסח. I don't know if that's applicable in your case. Also, I'm not sure if they mean that it doesn't need to be kosher for passover, it may just not need to a הכשר, but you need to make sure it's not made from the five grains. In תמב סעיף א the מחבר paskens that as long as a תערובת is not ראוי למאכל אדם then it is fine. The question is if your fish food is חמץ נוקשה or not...?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Absurdism Compatible with Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been getting into the works of the French philosopher Albert Camus, who is the face of the philosophical idea of \"The Absurd\" or \"Absurdism\". I was wondering if this philosophy is compatible with Judaism, or if some components of it at least.\nThrough his works, Camus conveys that the universe is a chaotic and indifferent place in which we humans will forever struggle to find meaning in/ will not ever fully comprehend. I think this can somewhat align with Judaism as there is an acknowledgment that humans don't fully understand the universe.\nI am just a mere beginner delving into this philosophy and I appreciate any response!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Generally, the core tenant of absurdism is not just that humans struggle to find the meaning of the world, but that there is no meaning, that the world is absurd and undirected, Camus has said <em>\"The absurd is born of this confrontation between the human need and the unreasonable silence of the world. This must not be forgotten.\nThis must be clung to because the whole consequence of a life can depend on it. The irrational, the human nostalgia, and the absurd that is born of their encounter, these are the three characters in the drama that must necessarily end with all the logic of which an existence is capable.\"</em> Essentially the position being that, mankind has formed a (pseudo) system of logic out of a completely irrational world, as opposed to Jewish teachings that the world is imbued with a rationality and a systematic completeness by God. <strong>While every philosopher has different views, generally absurdism, which teaches that the world is absurd, ie. that the world lacks meaning or a higher purpose and is not fully intelligible by reason,  is not compatible with Judaism, which is juxtaposed by a strong belief in rationality throughout the universe, and a clear purpose for mankind.</strong></p>\n<p>Its also worth noting that absurdism is not compatible with almost any philosophical positions, or really any deep philosophy (ie. Logical deduction) as a practice, which relies upon reason as a system. Camus famously said that he did not consider himself a philosopher because he did \"not believe sufficiently in reason to believe in a system.\"</p>\n<p>If you would like to read some philosophers that are more compatible with Judaism, or even those which are not but at least give you more to contemplate, please let me know.</p>\n\n\n",

Some say that it is oats, and that seems to have been the accepted tradition among Ashkenazim at least.<br />\nMore recently, Prof. Felix raised a number of objections to the tradition, and brought evidence that a different grain (\"two-row-barley\") is שבולת שועל.<br />\nWhat do contemporary poskim say?<br />\n(See also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/91004/why-are-oats-chametz-if-oats-cannot-rise\">Why are Oats Chametz if oats cannot rise</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101517/are-there-communities-which-permit-oats-on-pesach\">Are there communities which permit oats on Pesach?</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22457/why-is-oatmeal-considered-chometz\">Why is oatmeal considered chometz?</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The only contemporary posek I have heard who holds oats cannot become chametz is Rav Yitzchak Abadi. Rav Abadi is a serious posek in the chareidi world (he was a shaliach of the Chazon Ish and a talmid of Rav Aharon Kotler), but he's an original (and often lenient) thinker so his views are often controversial or not mainstream. His sons run a website based on his rulings and they claim he hold oats are not one of the five grains whether l'kula or l'chumra. <a href=\"https://kashrut.org/?p=6913\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://kashrut.org/?p=6913</a>. The website says they are kosher \"for Sephardim,\" so I assume they consider oats kitniyot.</p>\n<p>I have heard a few rebbeim say that oats should not be used for matzat mitzvah l'chumrah because there is at least a safek whether they are among the five grains. Rabbi Michael Broyde is one such authority. He thinks the evidence that oats are not shibolet shual is convincing. <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2011/08/oat-matzah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.torahmusings.com/2011/08/oat-matzah/</a>. He cites Shevet Halevi 9:117 and Minchat Yitzchak 9:49 as holding that \"there always was a very strong tradition not to use oat matzah at the Seder,\" but I can't see those sources inside so I'm not sure if their reasoning is the same as his or based on something else. According to this Star-K article cited by Avrahom Yizchok in a comment, Rav Sternbuch originally was choshesh to the botanical evidence l'chumrah in Teshuvot v’Hanhagot I:302, but \"17 years later, in V:130, he discounts the notion entirely.\" <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/sugya-of-oat-matzos.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.star-k.org/articles/wp-content/uploads/sugya-of-oat-matzos.pdf</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course, it ought to go without saying that many rebbeim have said the mesorah identifying shibolet shual as oats trumps botanical/historical evidence and there is no safek. Secondary sources cite Rabbi J.B. Soloveichik, Rav Moshe, and Rabbi Merzbach in this camp. See here page 8-9 <a href=\"https://www.kof-k.org/articles/FFT.Pesach.5773.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.kof-k.org/articles/FFT.Pesach.5773.pdf</a> I believe I've also heard the same in the name of Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach. I am away from my library and haven't seen any of the primary sources inside; many of the sources in the Star-K article are themselves secondary sources.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, I have never heard anyone say l'chumrah that Ahskenazim should not eat oat matzah other than leil haseder due to a chashash they are kitniyot.</p>\n\n\n",

We say a Yehi Ratzon right before Korbanot after the initial b'rachot (shetatzileini hayom, a singular and personal request). We say one at the very end of Shmoneh Esrei. We even have a Yehi Ratzon in the musaf Shmoneh Esrei (sheta'aleinu b'simcha).</p>\n<p>The one before the Korban Tamid asks Hashem to treat our saying the text as if we had performed the Korban, but that shouldn't be a problem because the Tamid was offered on Shabbat also. The distinction can't be about \"communal\" vs. \"personal\" because, as <a href=\"https://yaakovbieler.wordpress.com/2016/07/29/the-economics-of-the-korban-tamid/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> site indicates, the Tamid was communal as was the mussaf. It can't be about \"not asking forgiveness\" because the korban for Rosh Chodesh included an aspect of kapparah, even on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>So why would there be any tradition of skipping the Yehi Ratzons in these cases on Shabbat and Yom Tov? (no answer in Rite and Reason, or ספר טעמי המנהגים ומקורי הדינים)</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not explicitly written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this, as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wrapped Himself in a prayer shawl like a prayer leader and showed Moses the structure of the order of the prayer.

But when the Holy One, Blessed be He, looked upon the generation of the Flood and the generation of the Dispersion and saw that their ways were corrupt and that they might misuse this light for evil, He arose and concealed it from them, as it is stated: “And from the wicked their light is withheld” (Job 38:15).”</p>\n<p>This would show that this light is therefore the Talit which represents the Or Haganuz (or some type of light that goes from one end to another).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Read on:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R.

    "content": "# What checks were done on Korbanos for internal disqualifications?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>An animal that is schechted has to be checked for certain potential internal damages which would render it unfit for eating. I have been told that an animal which is \"treif\" for the sake of eating would be similarly disqualified as a korban.</p>\n<p>I assume (and please correct me if I'm wrong) that the process of checking to make sure an animal is acceptable takes some time. But the process of a korban doesn't seem to have any time built in for the checking -- the text speaks of sprinkling blood etc, not of \"first we have to inspect the animal.\"</p>\n<p>My local expert also said that the time is reduced today because even though there are over 20 other potential organ-based disqualifiers, we only check the lungs. But I assume that even that takes time. And that reduction is a result of modern farming and animal care.</p>\n<p>So in ancient days, what kind of checks were done on the internal organs of an animal and how did that play into the chronological process of performing all the aspects of a sacrifice ritual [side question would be, if an animal is found to be unacceptable because of a hidden, internal issue, who pays for a replacement]? Is there any discussion of how that process of checking will be reapplied in the future when we resume korbanot?</p>\n\n\n",

Not only the study, also the application of what we study. The Divrei Emes (from Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchak Horowitz, the Hoozeh of Lublin), also echoes this idea, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Divrei_Emet%2C_Divrei_Emet_on_Torah%2C_Tzav.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">to serve him with enthusiasm</a>.</p>\n<p>The Rama in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.264.9?lang=bi&with=Commentary%20ConnectionsList&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chayim, siman 264:9</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And in all cases our custom is to light the wick and to then extinguish it so that it may be charred (before [re]kindling them for the sake of the mitzvah) [so that] the flame should catch on well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the explanation of the Rama, the flame gets stronger when it's extinguished once before, and then re-kindled. This got me thinking. The posuk, and the deeper meaning behind it, tells us to not extinguish our \"inner flame\" and to serve G-d with continuous excitement and enthusiasm (Likkutei Sichos and the Divrei Emes). But, are there sources that discuss the idea that our \"inner flame\" and our Torah gets stronger, if we, G-d forbid , lose excitement for a moment (this is compared to what the Rama writes; extinguish the flame, then re-kindling it). Is that a concept?</p>\n<p>As always, please cite any sources. Answers explaining the concept @shmosel talks about are also welcome.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that I am not asking if the \"inner light\" needs to be completely distinguished (G-d Forbid), but rather if diminishing of this light, e.g. we experience less excitement for a while, is to make sure that it returns to us in stronger form.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a quote from Tanya (Chinuch Katan)</p>\n<p>אַךְ הִנֵּה יָדוּעַ לַיּוֹדְעִים, טַעֲמָא דִקְרָא\nמַאי דִּכְתִיב: ״כִּי שֶׁבַע יִפּוֹל צַדִּיק וָקָם״, וּבִפְרָט שֶׁהָאָדָם נִקְרָא ״מְהַלֵּךְ״ וְלֹא ״עוֹמֵד״, וְצָרִיךְ לֵילֵךְ מִמַּדְרֵגָה לְמַדְרֵגָה, וְלֹא לַעֲמוֹד בְּמַדְרֵגָה אַחַת לְעוֹלָם, וּבֵין מַדְרֵגָה לְמַדְרֵגָה, טֶרֶם שֶׁיַּגִּיעַ לְמַדְרֵגָה עֶלְיוֹנָה מִמֶּנָּה, הוּא בִּבְחִינַת ״נְפִילָה״ מִמַּדְרֵגָה הָרִאשׁוֹנָה. אַךְ, ״כִּי יִפּוֹל – לֹא יוּטָל״ כְּתִיב, וְאֵינָהּ נִקְרֵאת נְפִילָה, אֶלָּא לְגַבֵּי מַדְרֵיגָתוֹ הָרִאשׁוֹנָה, וְלֹא לְגַבֵּי שְׁאָר כָּל אָדָם חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, שֶׁאַף־עַל־פִּי־כֵן, הוּא לְמַעְלָה מִכָּל הָאָדָם בַּעֲבוֹדָתוֹ, כִּי נִשְׁאַר בָּהּ בְּחִינַת רְשִׁימוּ מִמַּדְרֵיגָתוֹ הָרִאשׁוֹנָה.</p>\n<p>Now, those who are familiar with the esoteric meaning of Scripture know [the explanation of] the verse, “For a tzaddik falls seven times and rises up again.” Especially since man is called “mobile” and not “static,” he must ascend from level to level and not remain forever at one plateau. Between one level and the next, before he can reach the higher one, he is in a state of decline from the previous level. Yet, it is written, “Though he falls, he shall not be utterly cast down.” It is considered a decline only in comparison with his former state, and not, G–d forbid, in comparison with all other men, for he is still above them in his service [of G–d], inasmuch as there remains in it an impression of his former state.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe explained this concept to someone by using a parable, that if someone wishes to jump over an obstacle, he first must step back in order to get over it</p>\n\n\n",

The unique musical content of these renditions of the <em>Kaddish</em>, therefore, is not found anywhere else in the liturgy. Among these are <em>Ma’ariv</em> for the Three Festivals, every <em>Kaddish</em> recited during a Torah service [...], the <em>Hatzi kaddish</em> for High Holiday <em>Musaf</em>, the <em>Minhah</em> service for Yom Kippur, and a few others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in the footnote there (no. 19) he elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some of these (e.g., <em>Kaddish</em> for High Holiday Torah services and Yom Kippur <em>Minhah</em>, not to mention [...] <em>Yom Kippur Katan</em>) are almost all but forgotten, because within the current practice in the American service they would take on a musical setting not traditionally prescribed for them, in all likelihood using the music for Shabbat <em>Ma’ariv Kaddish</em>, as described below.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm one of those American ignorami, but would like to step up my game by learning and preserving-by-using this rich heritage of ours.

I suspect this confusion is due to Mincha often being given to a less trained cantor.) Baer (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=66051&st=&pgnum=111\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">#240</a>) also has it for introducing weekday Selichot in the days around Rosh Hashana. There is another tune for this kaddish whose provenance is unknown to me (hear it <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/video/yom-kippur-mincha/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=yom-kippur-mincha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://www.kolhalashon.com/new/Media/PlayShiur.aspx?FileName=31077559\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> or <a href=\"https://www.virtualcantor.com/L012%20RH1%20-%20Chatzie%20Kaddish.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where it is also labeled for Torah reading). I've heard some suggest that Baer's tune is Western Ashkenazi and this tune is Eastern Ashkenazi but Baer definitely doesn't label it that way. While not strictly traditional, I'd suggest using this tune for weekday Selichot while saving Baer's more melodic tune for Yom Kippur Mincha would fit both occasions nicely.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we're discussing commonly ignored cantorial kaddish practices, it's worth pointing out that many are familiar with the famous \"Chassidic Kaddish\" commonly sang for the full kaddish on High Holidays. What people are generally unaware of is that is derived from a tune for full kaddish on Festivals (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=66051&st=&pgnum=230\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baer #821</a> and audio <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2ldJZtnEh4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The practice of singing the full kaddish in celebration on festivals is actually mentioned in Shulchan Aruch, though most people miss it.

    "content": "# What Is the \"Standard\" Shulchan Aruch Page Based On? How Many Dapim Are There?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many editions of the Shulchan Aruch and they do not all follow the same pagination. However, many editions I have seen call themselves \"tzurat hadaf\" and appear to have a similar layout and page density as each other. I have several questions about this purportedly standard layout:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How standardized is this layout? Do different tzurat hadaf editions begin and end each page with the same word in the same way printed Gemaras have since Bomburg? Do they have the same layout of the main mefarshim (e.g, Magen Avraham, Shakhm and Taz) in the way all Vilna Talmud's do?</li>\n<li>What is the standard layout based on? Is is modeled off a specific print edition in the same way almost gemaras on the market are based on the Vilna Shas?</li>\n<li>Have smaller details about the page changed over time? For example, in the Vilna Shas my understanding is that Rashi and Tosaafot have not moved but some editions change marginal notes, \"extras\" like musaf Rashi, move around cross-citations like the Torah Ohr, etc.). Has that happend with the Shulchan Aruch? Some of the \"standard\" commentaries like Levushei Srad, Yad Avraham, and Rabbi Akiva Eger are \"only\" 200 years old, so I'm wondering if those got added later.</li>\n<li>How many total pages are in these editions of the Shulchan Aruch (just the main text, not the extras in the back like the Pri Megadim, Eshel Avraham, etc.), which I assume change much more from edition to edition.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I cannot find answers to these questions on Google and I only have access to an incomplete set of older shulchan aruch and a complete set of a newer mehudar one, which doesn't adhere to tzurat hadaf and has a lot of extras.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, when witnesses come on Day 30, but <em>beit din</em> can't sanctify the month until Day 31, while Day 31 is celebrated as <em>rosh chodesh</em>, it is actually the <strong>second</strong> day of the month for calendrical purposes, because we do indeed say that retroactively Day 30 was the first day of the new month.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the Jewish view on using psychedelic drugs to gain mystical insights?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is Judaism's view on using psychedelics (like peyote, ayahuasca, magic mushrooms or cannabis) to receive mystical visions or gain insights?</p>\n<p>I am well aware of a growing trend nowadays among many people and some cultures (like various Native American tribes) of using what are known as psychedelics to experience mystical visions and gain insights. Many even report seeing and communicating with spirits and \"entities\" while under the influence of such drugs. Many people say they have received clarity and even relief from certain mental conditions like depression after using psychedelics.</p>\n<p>Is it permissible according to the Torah and the various Rabbinic sources to use psychedelics or mind-altering drugs to experience mystical visions and gain insights? Also, what is the kabbalistic view on this subject (such as according to the Arizal and other kabbalists)?</p>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is not the Jewish way - no shortcuts! Spirituality is not about personal experiences. It is about the hard work of refining one's character, improving the world, engaging in acts of kindness, prayer and learning Torah. It is about forging a close, intimate relationship with one's fellow Jew, man and of course first and foremost - God.</p>\n<p>If one picks up any work on Jewish Law, nowhere in it does it say one should be engaged in having \"spiritual mystical experiences\", certainly not with the assistance of psychedelic drugs - all you will find is a guide to living a normal, drug-free life in a way that is in sync with truth and spirituality.</p>\n<p>In fact, such drugs are likely highly damaging to one's soul, and are likely to invite all sorts of unwanted impure forces into one's world. They will be profound experiences that might convince someone of something that they are convinced is a deep truth but is actually purely a hallucination. There would be no way to prove it or disprove it but this person might attach themselves to this false idea for the rest of their life and the damage that does is immeasurable! See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26517/are-psilocybin-mushrooms-permitted-prohibited-advocated-in-jewish-law-or-traditi/30157#30157\">this answer</a> for more detail about this...</p>\n<p>Even the shamans and native american tribes will not permit one to use them without guidance and assistance. They are dangerous, alter one's personality, cause mental illness and other negative effects. The guidance will invariably be from a priest of a pagan religion as well, and this is something the Torah and the children of Avraham have stood against for thousands of years.</p>\n<p>On top of that, if, in (highly dubious) theory, such drugs actually worked and enabled someone to access spiritual truths, then what would be the point of coming down into this world? Before our soul was born, it had unlimited access to all spiritual truths, and clearly that wasn't good enough. Hashem created this world and sent us down here, and asks us to elevate this world and make it receptive to Him through the sweat of our brow, sincere effort and by following His guidelines. Cheating that system is not appropriate. See Midrash Tanhuma Pekudei 7; Shemot Rabbah 52:3 for one example of many many examples where the Sages had an opportunity to \"cheat\" and demonstrated that this is not permitted or wise.</p>\n<p>They had opportunities to do so through saying special names of Hashem, with no need for drugs.  For example, it is possible to recall one's previous lives through such practices. <em>Faith and Folly</em> by Chacham Hillel Shlita goes to length to explain how forbidden this is. Maybe a mashal can be drawn. A husband, if he had access to some super power that he could perform acts of romance and fulfil his wife's needs by simply sitting in his chair and pressing a button, his wife would wonder why she even married him and if she even has a real relationship with him. He's supposed to serve her himself and demonstrate his love through effort and struggle; get out of his chair and talk to her and get to know her over time; then his love is real and the relationship is proven and earned. Hashem doesn't want us \"cheating\" in relating to Him and serving Him. If He did, as I have said, then He wouldn't have created this world of effort and toil (see Mesilat Yisharim introduction and ch.1), He could have just kept us up in heaven and we could have adored Him for eternity...</p>\n<p>Any spiritual mystical experiences in Jewish life are either very down to earth (such as visiting the holy land, the western wall etc) or they are accessible by the holiest sages who have dedicated their very being to the service of God and man for many decades, through effort we cannot comprehend. After all of that, they are granted, without drugs, communion with higher worlds. Even in such cases, such endeavours are dangerous and not all of them come out unscathed.</p>\n<p>As such, every single time I've heard reference to psychedelic drugs anywhere in the Torah world, it has always been classed as strictly forbidden and damaging. Tinkering with one's soul like that is grossly negligent and irresponsible, causing unspeakable damage that one might never be able to recover from.</p>\n<p>No shortcuts. If you want a spiritual experience, or access to higher truth, do it properly: through a lifetime of study, kindness and prayer.</p>\n<p>EDIT: I had a non-Jewish friend who took magic mushrooms and told me how he had a profound mystical experience where he experienced \"god\" as some cosmic entity that loves us profoundly and also had a huge sexual nature. I wanted to assist this guy and I spoke to my own Rav about it to see if there was anything else going on (I thought maybe he came into contact with something to do with klipa etc). My Rav said:</p>\n<p><em>\"He was hallucinating!! That's what hallucinogens are, they make you hallucinate. Who is he kidding? Mushrooms, LSD. Takes you to a different reality. Far away from the true reality. All the euphoria is just effect of the drug. They just make you feel like you had a spiritual experience, but it was drug induced. After a trip you feel like you want to get spiritual or religious. That's because you want to experience the euphoria for real. If you keep going back to the drug for that, you will get wrecked. Just get this message across: Ok you had a spiritual experience, but where is it going? Just for the fun? Where is the Avodah? The service discipline? What is there to gain from it? How can you sustain this spiritual feeling without crashing?\"</em></p>\n<p>This is a tremendously dangerous force to get involved with. It makes you feel like you have a way to connect to God, and it feels great, and it will put you off ever wanting to do this for real, through the real work that it takes to achieve genuine spiritual euphoria that you own yourself (see Derech Hashem 1:2:2), the ultimate goal of creation.</p>\n<p>Note, my friend left his wife for the person who supplied him those drugs. The supplier also killed herself a few weeks later. He's now moved to the far east, I don't hear from him much anymore. Oy vey, just stay away from this sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n",

I did my own research and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/131277/31534\">answered</a> that question. I will base what I write here with those source and that conclusion so therefore I won't be re-quoting the sources.</p>\n<p>It's a good question - how can <em>anything</em> go against Hashem's will? How can sin be even <em>possible</em>? This is a deep question that is asked in Jewish Hashkafa, and the answer I find the clearest comes from Chassidus.</p>\n<p>Will has an inner and an outer aspect. It is my outer will that my children behave at all times and never fight, steal, break things, talk back etc. However, that's not my inner will. My inner will is that <em>they become actually good on the inside and own that goodness themselves</em>. So when raising them, I have two choices. Either I could always get my way, and nip any infraction in the bud immediately, create an atmosphere of intense, terrible discipline in my home and force them to engage in acts of goodness all day. In that scenario, I'd never have anything that I want violated at all (how pleasant that would be for me!). Yet, in that case I wouldn't get what I really want: good kids.</p>\n<p>L'havdil this is similar to Hashem's relationship with us. Hashem has taken it to an amazing extreme: He has given us completely free reign to violate His will. His goal is to produce good people who own their good (see Derech Hashem 1:2:2) to the greatest degree possible.</p>\n<p>Chassidus (as well as many other strands of thought) add that <em>in the end</em>, Hashem always gets what He wants - there is only One Will, and none other! We have the ability to mess up plenty, but Hashem tidies up after us along the way. Therefore while it is possible for us to produce a mamzer, Hashem will still make sure that in the end everything works out through hashgacha. Hashem's outer will may be violated, but His inner will is never violated, so everything that happens, even sins and evil, are always exactly what He wants in exactly the way He wants.</p>\n<p>He didn't want one to have this mamzer (see the Rambam quoted in the linked answer), and didn't \"predestine\" it. But He did want us to have that choice, and when we made it He wanted us to experience the consequences, learn from it, partner with Him in creation and find the good in it. He did foresee it before creation and therefore arranged for the right soul to be in the right place at the right time, as well as a billion other details to ensure that everything still goes according to His inner will all along the way, and by the end of the project, He gets what He wants, what is best, what is good.</p>\n<p>As I explained in that answer, does that mean we don't have to worry? On the contrary, expecting the supreme King of Kings of Kings to tidy up after us like a janitor; ruining the way things <em>could have been</em> had we stuck to His outer will; fill His and our story with unnecessary tragedy and terror due to our arrogance and selfishness - all of that is on us. This world is serious and real and forever and there's no going back. It's important, worth caring for <em>infinitely</em>, and Someone does indeed care for it infinitely. Facing the reality of that is going to be a very dreaded day indeed and we can only pray that Hashem will wipe away ours and His tears speedily.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Free will of people with mental disorders\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is said that God cannot affect people's free will and that is why he does not manifest himself directly. However, what about psychiatric problems in this category? They somehow alter people's ability to assert themselves, obsessive disorders of some nature that harm them like always washing their hands causing skin problems or even wasting money. In Exodus 4:11 it is said that God is the one who makes the blind or gives sight, who makes the dumb and the deaf. So would he also be responsible for penalizing, so to speak, mental problems of a nature that affect people's power of choice? This would not be resolved as just an organic temptation as a sexual need that has to be mastered as in the case of Amnon, worse than even this type of thing can be framed in health problems and not be merely a moral weakness. So how is it to judge people with this type of problem and the issue of free will spiritually speaking since no earthly court would impute guilt to these qualified people with these disorders.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Great question!</p>\n<p>The Machneh Yisrael 2:1 says something stunning about those who are handicapped (or have mental disorders). He says that those who are handicapped (or have mental disorders) are people from previous gilgulim (reincarnations) who did many sins. They eventually died, and instead of getting punished in shamayim, they were sent into another gilgul to get their punishments here (which is a lesser degree of punishment). They were afraid that they would cause more sins (as they did in the previous gilgul) so they begged to be in a reincarnation in a body that is handicapped (or that contains mental disorders), so they would barely do any sins, and also pay their punishments in this world.</p>\n<p>Based on this, we can say that it's actually in the benefit of those who are handicapped (or have mental disorders), it's what they want for their own neshama. The Gemera in Makkot 10b says, בדרך שאדם רוצה לילך בה מוליכין ,אותו “along the path a person wishes to proceed, one leads and assists him.” Even though this is only speaking about the body, I would apply it to the neshama as well, which desires to suffer the punishment in this world (and thus not have free choice) then suffer a greater punishment in shamayim. Thus, Hashem is not responsible, but on the contrary, since He is helping the person for his better good, one should thank Hashem for this.</p>\n<p>Now it is very hard for that handicapped/mentally disordered individual and his loved ones to understand this, but after time/hard work one can come to appreciate what Hashem has done for them. This is the famous teaching of Rabbi Akiva in Brachot 60b, כל דעביד רחמנא לטב עביד, “Everything that God does, He does for the best.” (the Gemera shows how this line takes place in a story with Rebbi Akiva himself). Along the same lines, Nachum Ish Gamzu in Taanit 21a says, גם זו לטובה, this too is for the good (thus his name Ish Gamzu, and the Gemera as well brings many stories involving Nachum Ish Gam Zu showing the same idea).</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>An earthly court would have <em>difficulty</em> imputing guilt to people with mental disorders. However, it's not impossible to do so. The court might be convinced that despite having some form of mental disorder, the crime was too egregious for the person not to have been aware of the difference between bad and good; and will find the person guilty of the crime.</p>\n<p>But in all cases God knows the truth about the person, and He is the true judge. Claims that the person is mentally insane, and is therefore not guilty, will be determined by God Himself.</p>\n<p>Did the person commit the sin solely due to his mental illness, or did he really intrinsically have the capacity/capability to refrain from doing the sin, but was unwilling to engage his Yetzer Hara in battle?</p>\n<p>If he has the status of \"shoteh\" (שוטה), God will exempt the person from punishment, since he is considered \"Anuss\" (אנוס), and the sin was committed under duress of his illness.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, Hashem might find him culpable for his actions.</p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it's up to Hashem to judge the person, and not our job to do so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Chachamim say that everything is in the hands of heaven except fear of heaven (Berachot 33b and Megillah 25a). One thing we have to know is that ultimately, we are guaranteed our choices between good and evil. However, it is true, as brought by Rav Dessler in <em>Michtav me-Eliyahu</em>, we all have a different \"level\" of free will, meaning there are some things we are expected to be able to choose between, and some things that are currently beyond our level. Many people wouldn't be able to murder, but they also wouldn't be able to concentrate on every single word of prayer. This deals with your point about people having very strong temptations that others don't have and how we should judge them, and resolving it with Chazal's original statement will be made at the end of this answer, although a simple answer is, <em>we can all</em> climb that ladder to the point of never being able to sin.</p>\n<p>Hashem chooses everyone's station in life, and what his service is meant to be, what area of humanity he has to master and conquer in the service of Hashem. Each is calculated according to vast calculations only Hashem is capable of (see Daat Tevunot by Ramchal). This might mean that the best thing for this person might be to have almost no free will, and there is a purpose for that (and in some cases, perhaps none at all - this the Arizal says is because we have multiple incarnations in this world and a person might sometimes come down here to atone for something, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133990/31534\">Avishai's amazing answer</a> deals with, or make up something and complete free will would not be required - see Shaar HaGilgulim). This deals with people who have severe mental impairment.</p>\n<p>To understand this more deeply though, we have to realise why exactly Hashem gave us free will.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, given all this, how do we salvage the statement of Chazal? This is a very good point, and is dealt with in Chassidus. See <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldThqpY-Pu4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a> for example, or Likuutei Sichot vol 19 pp. 279-281 on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.30.19?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Rashi</a> (the second one). To summarise (badly, I highly recommend the shiur), we can think of free will on 3 levels:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The realm of decisions, between good choices and bad choices.</li>\n<li>The realm of choosing how we identify ourselves.</li>\n<li>Truly choosing God.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When it comes to 1, it's arguable if that is really a \"free\" choice. Many arguments are made against it in philosophy and it is currently an unsolved problem (see the original Stoics et al). According to Chabad Chassidus, they are basically correct; this is not truly free will and it can't be. There will always be the decision that makes the most sense and one would always choose that. All those types of decisions are based on some sort of reasoning.</p>\n<p>Choosing an apple, one will choose which looks tastier, or bigger. Failing that, one will choose whichever is closer. Failing that, one will choose which one is nearer to his good hand. Failing that, he will just flip a coin (which is not a choice!). When it comes to moral decisions, one has to climb the ladder to 2 to get his reasoning.</p>\n<p>2 takes us closer. A person is ultimately free to choose how he identifies. A person in a prison can still choose to identify as a free man, a free man stuck in some walls. A person can decide if he wants to be a good person pursuing good, or decide if he wants to be a wicked person out for destruction. Again though, it is a little dubious - a person will make this decision based on some sort of reasoning. The choice will be completely influenced by that reasoning, and therefore it is not truly a \"free\" choice.</p>\n<p>Therefore, we have to go to 3. We can't explain it at all, nor can we truly understand it but that doesn't mean we haven't got anything to say about it. We know that God is completely uninfluenced. Nothing can tell Him what to do; this is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">God of Avraham</a>. Therefore everything He does is a truly free will. He does it based purely on Himself. This is something we can put into words but can't really grasp. At the same time, we sort of can grasp it because this is how we feel about ourselves. We feel that our will is our own, and get that idea. He used that choice to <em>choose us</em>.</p>\n<p>Hashem has instilled into our Divine soul this power to be able to <em>choose Him</em>, not in a classical choice <em>between options</em> (what other options is there?)... Another way to put it - we are completely free to <em>express who we are</em>. I am me, and me chooses Hashem. When I choose Hashem, I do it because that is who I am, not because it makes sense, or there's a good reason, or I am coerced in any way.</p>\n<p>This I believe is what Chazal mean. Hashem decides every last detail of our lives, what gender we are, what time we are born in, what religion we are born to, what colours we like... The only thing He will not choose for us is choosing Him. My wife also makes most of the decisions in my life, but she can't choose that I be her husband! Even if she could, she wouldn't; that's not a husband. We are all given a unique battle against this truth: we all would choose Hashem in a heartbeat, but to bring out the reality of that, we are given 1000 reasons to <em>not</em> choose Him, and by overcoming that, we get to truly own that choice.</p>\n\n\n",

Should we love Hashem (ואהבת את ה' אלקיך) more than anyone else?

I believe God did not give us the Torah through Abraham because Abraham loved God too much. And instead, Moses was found worthy of giving the Torah because he was willing to advocate for the people of Israel, even if it meant defying God Himself.</p>\n<p>God made the following promise to Abraham:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Genesis Chapter 12</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֶל-אַבְרָם, לֶךְ-לְךָ\nמֵאַרְצְךָ וּמִמּוֹלַדְתְּךָ וּמִבֵּית אָבִיךָ, אֶל-הָאָרֶץ, אֲשֶׁר אַרְאֶךָּ.    1\nNow the LORD said unto Abram: 'Get thee out of thy country, and from\nthy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto the land that I will\nshow thee. ב  וְאֶעֶשְׂךָ, לְגוֹי גָּדוֹל, וַאֲבָרֶכְךָ, וַאֲגַדְּלָה\nשְׁמֶךָ; וֶהְיֵה, בְּרָכָה.     2 And I will make of thee a great nation,\nand I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and be thou a\nblessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God gives Abraham a promise that if Abraham leaves the people around him, that God will establish a new people through Abraham and his descendants. Every Jew learns of this promise, and its fulfillment. But what few Jews discuss is how the Torah compares Abraham's greatness vs Moses's greatness so we can see the shortcomings of Abraham. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>In order to fulfill God's prophecy of descendants, Sarai and Abraham try to have a child through Hagar. God eventually has to tell Abraham that this was not the path.</li>\n<li>When God appears to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham advocates for those innocent in those cities. But he does not attempt to stop God, and Abraham does not attempt to save the innocent people himself, he just asks God to be righteous.</li>\n<li>Abraham allows his family to be torn apart twice for the sake of God's promise. Abraham sends away Hagar and Ishmael, which eventually become the separate people we now call Arabs, but whom might have been one of our tribes if they had not been sent away. And Abraham offers up Isaac, and after the near sacrifice we are never shown Abraham and Isaac as talking or living together ever again. Abraham only has one descendant, Isaac has few, whereas Ishmael has many kids and becomes his own people much faster than Abraham and Isaac, which we would not expect to be the case.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We know that God rewards Abraham for his faithfulness, and truly there were probably none so devoted to God in our tradition as Abraham. And while the Torah does not offer commentary on whether Abraham makes the actual right decision, the Torah does give us another story to compare to.</p>\n<p>God makes nearly the same promise to Moses, but instead of Moses doing everything to try and fulfill God's promise like Abraham, Moses does something else entirely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Exodus 32</p>\n<p>י  וְעַתָּה הַנִּיחָה לִּי, וְיִחַר-אַפִּי בָהֶם וַאֲכַלֵּם; וְאֶעֱשֶׂה\nאוֹתְךָ, לְגוֹי גָּדוֹל.  10 Now therefore let Me alone, that My wrath may\nwax hot against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make of\nthee a great nation.' יא  וַיְחַל מֹשֶׁה, אֶת-פְּנֵי יְהוָה אֱלֹהָיו;\nוַיֹּאמֶר, לָמָה יְהוָה יֶחֱרֶה אַפְּךָ בְּעַמֶּךָ, אֲשֶׁר הוֹצֵאתָ מֵאֶרֶץ\nמִצְרַיִם, בְּכֹחַ גָּדוֹל וּבְיָד חֲזָקָה.    11 And Moses besought the LORD\nhis God, and said: 'LORD, why doth Thy wrath wax hot against Thy\npeople, that Thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with\ngreat power and with a mighty hand? יב  לָמָּה יֹאמְרוּ מִצְרַיִם לֵאמֹר,\nבְּרָעָה הוֹצִיאָם לַהֲרֹג אֹתָם בֶּהָרִים, וּלְכַלֹּתָם, מֵעַל פְּנֵי\nהָאֲדָמָה; שׁוּב מֵחֲרוֹן אַפֶּךָ, וְהִנָּחֵם עַל-הָרָעָה לְעַמֶּךָ.     12\nWherefore should the Egyptians speak, saying: For evil did He bring\nthem forth, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from\nthe face of the earth? Turn from Thy fierce wrath, and repent of this\nevil against Thy people. יג  זְכֹר לְאַבְרָהָם לְיִצְחָק וּלְיִשְׂרָאֵל\nעֲבָדֶיךָ, אֲשֶׁר נִשְׁבַּעְתָּ לָהֶם בָּךְ, וַתְּדַבֵּר אֲלֵהֶם, אַרְבֶּה\nאֶת-זַרְעֲכֶם כְּכוֹכְבֵי הַשָּׁמָיִם; וְכָל-הָאָרֶץ הַזֹּאת אֲשֶׁר אָמַרְתִּי,\nאֶתֵּן לְזַרְעֲכֶם, וְנָחֲלוּ, לְעֹלָם.     13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and\nIsrael, Thy servants, to whom Thou didst swear by Thine own self, and\nsaidst unto them: I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven,\nand all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed,\nand they shall inherit it for ever.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>When God told Abraham he would make a people through him, Abraham changed his entire life to fulfill this promise. Moses is not at all tempted by this promise. Abraham advocates only for the innocent, but in the end would not stand between God and those God are judging. Moses advocates for the entire people, guilty and innocent alike.</li>\n<li>When push came to shove Abraham was willing to give up both of his children for God's promise. When push came to shove Moses would rather be taken out of God's Torah than let the people of Israel be destroyed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>And so it is my opinion that the Torah comes to teach us the following: If Abraham would have been there at the Golden Calf, he would have let God destroy the entire people since all of them were at least a little guilty in the idolatry after witnessing the miracles of their salvation. Abraham would have watched God destroy them all, and then he would have tried to have another child to fulfill God's promise. The greatness of Moses and the greatness of Abraham are very different. And by comparing their greatnesses we can see where each fell short of the other. And I argue that we learn from Abraham that there's a cost to loving God too much</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The greatest love one can show a Father is to do a kindness to His children.\"\n<br/><em>-me</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would like to suggest that the question is based on a false dichotomy.</p>\n<p>Hashem doesn't need anything.

The central expression of <em>Ahavas Hashem</em> is how we love the people we relate to. Family, friends, neighbors, the Jewish People, humanity, other living things, and even all of creation.

    "content": "# Purim - Ha-ba le-horgekha, hashkem le-horgo\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Babylonian Talmud, Tractate Sanhedrin, Portion 72, Verse 1, it says that if someone comes to kill you, rise up and kill him first.</p>\n<p>During the entire episode of Purim, why didn't the Yidden, rise up and kill the bad guys first?</p>\n<p>It also says, \" <em>And in every province, wherever the king's orders and his edict reached, there was great mourning for the Jews, and fasting and weeping and lamenting; sackcloth and ashes were put on the most prominent.</em>\"\nThe above doesn't indicate any sort of defensive action.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A few thoughts, if not a complete answer. First, who exactly were the Jews supposed to kill? The first edict said the Jews should be killed, but not who should kill them. Esther 3:13. And based on what eventually happened, it sounds like the decree just permitted anyone who didn't like the Jews to do so with impunity on the appointed day. See Esther 8:11, 9:1-2. Did the Jews know exactly who those people were? Even if they did, I don't think they can kill someone just for being an antisemite today because of what they might do in a year.</p>\n<p>The principle OP cites appears to be based on the din of rodef--that one can use lethal force in self defense. Although Rava himself does not give a source for his principle that אם בא להורגך השכם להורגו, the surrounding discussion in the gemara is about rodef and the baraita on 72b specifically connects the case at issue--the burglar at night--to the din of rodef. That's also how the Rema understands it in Choshen Mishpat 425. The din of rodef usually only applies to a threat posed by a specific person. See the gemara there, see Choshen Mishpat 425. To be sure the threat can be indirect, such as the burglar who isn't out to kill but is willing to kill if you resist or a person who is likely to provoke government persecution (see Choshen Mishpat 388:12). But we don't generally see halakhic license to kill someone based on present attitudes that may make them inclined to violence a year from now.</p>\n<p>(However, the rules may be different when dealing with a nationwide threat. Bamidbar Rabbah 21:4 says the commandment to harass the Midianites is based on a din preemptive action. And in general halakhah doesn't preclude preemptive military strikes on the basis that maybe the specific soldiers you kill wouldn't be involved in the attack. On the other hand, the rest of that section in Bamidbar Rabah and the next section imply that the treatment of the Midianites was atypical. There was a very light-on-sources debate in the pages of the Guardian in 2009 about whether military action would be justified against Hamas voters in Gaza. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/12/judaism-gaza-israel-halachah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/12/judaism-gaza-israel-halachah</a>. Also note that many authors say that the rules of military engagement don't fit neatly into the individual rules of self defense. That's definitely the shitah of Rav Chaim David HaLevi in Aseh Lkha Rav and other places. So <em>tzarikh iyun</em> whether there might be a more capacious concept of אם בא להורגך when you're talking about a national threat and how the Purim story would fit into such a framework.)</p>\n<p>Second, even if someone is a rodef, lethal force is the last resort. Rambam in Hilchot Rotzeach 1:6 & 13 says you need to try to warn the rodef to stop and you need to use non-lethal force if possible. Based on this, if a person says \"I'm going to kill you in a year\" you cannot shoot him on the spot. You can try to call the police, try to talk him out of it, try to disable him or escape, etc. In light of that, beginning with tefilah and fasting and trying to change the King's mind first all seemed halakhically proper. While I agree with OP that the Jews didn't take immediate defensive action in the first few day (such as stockpiling weapons), that doesn't mean they wouldn't have fought in the end.</p>\n<p>Third, as other commenters have said, the Jews needed to be pragmatic. Presumably if the Jews had started assassinating known anti-Semites, or Haman, or all the local officials there would have been harsh reprisals. The Jews would have been insanely outnumbered and there might have been even more public and government support for swiftly killing the Jews. Clearly the better course was to first try to change the decree. Peaceful protest sometimes works.

    "content": "# Do the Arabs count to the moon, too?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud famously <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sukkah.29a.11?lang=he&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> (in a Baraita on Sukkah 29a) that the Jewish people calculate our calendar by the moon (lunar calendar), and the Nations of the World use the sun (solar calendar). How is this understood as far as the Arab/Muslim calendar which is lunar, and likewise the Chinese calendar, which uses the moon?\nIf, however, these peoples are an exception to the rule, why so?\n(I heard there is a Maharal about this, but I don't know where.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have also been bothered by this exact question and I have not found an answer inside. The Maharal does deal with this midrash in Beer HaGolah 6:2, but his focus is more on explaining how eclipses indicate sin, especially given that they are predictable astronomical phenomena. As @Harel13 says above, I'm not particularly troubled by the Islamic calendar per se because it post-dates the Talmud. It may also be partly based on the Jewish calendar. See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_calendar</a>. (Though probably at least some Arabs were using a lunar or lunisolar calendar beforehand, which presents the same issue. See below.)</p>\n<p>But more generally, Chazal were certainly familiar with non-Jewish lunar calendars. Most importantly, the Babylonians used a calendar very similar to the Jews, including the same lunar months and a 19-year Metonic cycle of intercalated months. Hazal were also familiar with Arabs, who are mentioned in many places in the Talmud, though who knows how familiar they were with the Arabic calendar. (There were also other pre-Talmudic cultures the Rabbis were not in contact with that used the lunar calendar,\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_calendar</a>).</p>\n<p>My best explanation so far is that Chazal are speaking in generalities and don't mean all goyim. Or \"goyim\" may be shorthand for Greece and Rome in particular, given that the statement in Sukkah 29a is a Tannaitic Baraita.\nYou could probably come up with a nice drash about the sun and the moon and Jacob and Esau. (Obviously the Tannaim would have been familiar with Arabs and Babylonians, both of whom are mentioned in Tanakh and Tannaitic sources; my point is they wouldn't have been at the front of a Tanna's mind. In the same way, when American rabbis today say \"the non-Jews do such\" and such they usually don't mean China).</p>\n<p>Another puzzle, not mentioned by OP, is that the Jewish calendar is based on the moon <em>and the sun</em>. So why don't solar simanim also affect the Jews? This svara would support the first Baraita that a solar eclipse is bad for the whole world and pose a problem for the second Baraita that says the Sun is a siman for non-Jews specifically.</p>\n\n\n",

When he heard David's words \"I\nlove the house where you live\" (Psalm 26:8), he realized that the\nsynagogue was his true dwelling place.

Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Elazar do not disagree\nabout this concept, but rather about which specific institution is\nreferred to as \"miniature sanctuary.\" According to Rabbi Yitzchak, the\nterm refers to synagogues and study halls in Babylon, while Rabbi\nElazar believes it refers to the \"house of our master\" - the study\nhall where a rabbi teaches Torah to his disciples. This term also\napplies to a synagogue where both study and prayer take place,\nreflecting the idea that they are one and the same in terms of their\nspiritual function.</p>\n<p>ומעלה יתירה ב(בית הכנסת ובית המדרש שב)\"בית רבינו\" לגבי שאר בתי כנסיות\nובתי מדרשות - כדרשת חז\"ל* \"מאי דכתיב? אוהב ה' שערי ציון מכל משכנות\nיעקב, אוהב ‏ ה' שערים המצויינים בהלכה יותר מבתי כנסיות ובתי מדרשות ..\nמיום שחרב בית המקדש אין לו להקב\"ה בעולמו אלא ארבע אמות של הלכה\",\n\"דבזמן שביהמ\"ק קיים הי\" שם לשכת הגזית שמשם יוצאת הלכה פסוקה ע\"פ\nסנהדרין ועמהם ודאי השכינה שרוי\", ועכשיו שחרב ביהמ\"ק אותן ד' אמות של\nהלכה .. מקום קבוע שממנו יוצאת הוראה לאנשי העיר'\"יו (ולכן גם התפלה היא\nבמקום זה דוקא*') - שזהו ענינו של \"בית רבינו'יגו.</p>\n<p>ומצד העילוי המיוחד ד(בית הכנסת ובית המדרש שב)\"בית רבעו\" לגבי שאר בתי\nכנסיות ובתי מדרשות שבבבל, ה\"ה \"מקדש מעט\" העיקרי שנותן הקב\"ה לישראל\nבזמן הגלות תמורת המקדש הגדול שבירושלים.</p>\n<p>The \"house of our master\" has a higher status than other synagogues\nand study halls, as it is considered a place where Torah is taught at\nthe highest level. This is based on the idea expressed by the sages\nthat God loves the gates of Zion more than any other dwelling place,\nincluding synagogues and study halls. Since the destruction of the\nTemple, the only place where God's presence is directly felt is within\nthe four cubits of halacha. During the time of the Temple, the\nSanhedrin chamber was located in the Temple complex, which was the\nsource of authoritative halachic rulings. Today, the four cubits of\nhalacha serve as a permanent place from which Torah instruction is\ndisseminated, and as such, it is the primary function of the \"house of\nour master.\" The special elevation and status of the \"house of our\nmaster\" is due to its being the primary source of authoritative\nhalachic rulings during the exile. This is in exchange for the absence\nof the great Temple in Jerusalem. In Babylon, the synagogues and study\nhalls are considered \"miniature sanctuaries,\" as they serve as a\nsubstitute for the Temple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>so that's the beginning of what it says but I'm still having some questions understanding it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>what exactly the chidush of sif aleph is, since the simple meaning is that ry and re are in fact arguing.

That would imply that if not for that, there would be reason to think they are arguing.</p>\n<p>I guess that means that in the initial understanding, since the name of the place is simply \"the house of the Rebbe\", that would imply that it's just the place where the Rebbe lives, and (possibly?) also the place he gives psak din / lessons to the people of the city / country etc. (in this case it's Rav who was essentially the Reish Galusa),</p>\n<p>so I guess maybe at first we thought that  the Gemara thought that Beis Rabeinu is not a synagogue, but rather, just the personal house (because of the name it uses), but (part?) of the novelty might be that Beis Rabeinu is just called that in order to stress some deeper meaning</p>\n<p>(that the Rebbe includes the sparks of the yechida of all other places, and the house of the rebbe is the house where the general yechida / manifestation of the Shechina is found), and that's maybe (part of?) the reason they're not arguing</p>\n<p>But I've been trying to think this through and I'm not sure it's consistent, since Abaye said that he would go a full parsa out of his way to daven at the Beis Haknesses of Rav (Hutzul), and it even calls it explicitly \"The Beis Haknesses of Hutzul\" in the beginning of that sugya, so the question returns:</p>\n<p>What is the reasoning of both Rabbi Yitzchak and Rabbi Elazar when we think they are not arguing [and the understanding of the sugya in general according to that], and what is the chiddush (and hechrech) in this Sicha that they are in fact not arguing?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Putting one's own life first - exceptions?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a famous Bava Metzia 62a paskens that in a case where there are two people and there is only enough water for one to survive, the owner of the water drinks it and lets the other die:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורבי יוחנן האי וחי אחיך עמך מאי עביד ליה מבעי ליה לכדתניא שנים שהיו\nמהלכין בדרך וביד אחד מהן קיתון של מים אם שותין שניהם מתים ואם שותה אחד\nמהן מגיע לישוב דרש בן פטורא מוטב שישתו שניהם וימותו ואל יראה אחד מהם\nבמיתתו של חבירו עד שבא ר' עקיבא ולימד וחי אחיך עמך <strong>חייך קודמים לחיי\nחבירך</strong></p>\n<p>And Rabbi Yoḥanan, what does he do with this: “And your brother shall\nlive with you”? He requires for that which is taught “two were walking\non path and [there was] a jug of water in the possession of one of\nthem. If both drink [both] die, but if one of them drinks, he will\nreach a settled area. Ben Petora taught: the preference is that both\nof them drink and die, and let neither one of them see the death of\nthe other, until Rabbi Akiva came and taught “And your brother shall\nlive with you,” (Vayikra 25:36) <strong>your life takes precedence over the\nlife of the other.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The dispute in Nedarim 80b is even more surprising, which seems to bring the opinion of R' Yosei that if there is only enough water in a spring to wash your town's clothes or provide drinking water for another town, you are allowed to divert it to wash your clothes! However the following discussion seems to conclude that this is still an issue of life vs. life because dirty clothes are a <em>pikuach nefesh</em> in the long run.</p>\n<p>I am currently trying to establish if there are exceptions to this. Based on the principle of Yoma 82b, \"perhaps his blood is redder\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לי מרי דוראי: קטליה לפלניא, ואי לא — קטילנא לך. אמר ליה: נקטלך ולא\nתקטול. מאי חזית דדמא דידך סומק טפי? <strong>דילמא דמא דההוא גברא סומק טפי</strong></p>\n<p>The master of the village said to me: Kill so-and-so, and if not I\nwill kill you. [Rava] said to him: Let yourself be killed, and you\nshould not kill. What did you see that your blood is redder? <strong>Perhaps\nthe blood of that man is redder</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It does seem more complicated than the original gemara. I believe there might be a Chazon Ish and/or an Iggerot Moshe on these halacot, does anyone know where they are?</p>\n<p>I would like to know if there are any exceptions? Should one put the life of his wife and children first? Would it really be the case that if a husband and wife are in a desert and the husband has some water, he should drink it and... [can't type it, sorry]</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I don't want to limit this question unnecessarily but it goes with my <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/134016/love-hashem-more-than-fellow-jew\">other question</a>. I am trying to get to the bottom of whether we should love our fellow Jew more, less, or as much as Hashem, and what it practically means.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One major exception is if you are ordered to kill or be killed you need to give up your own life rather than kill the other person. In contrast to the Gemara OP cites from Bava Metzia, Pesachim 25b says how can you kill the other person, maybe his blood is redder than yours?\nושפיכות דמים גופיה מנלן? סברא הוא כי ההוא דאתא לקמיה דרבא. אמר ליה: מרי דוראי אמר לי \"זיל קטליה לפלניא, ואי לא, קטלינא לך\". אמר ליה: ליקטלוך, ולא תיקטול. מאי חזית? דדמא דידך סומק טפי?! דילמא דמא דההוא גברא סומק טפי</p>\n<p>Many poskim also discuss if you are allowed, or possibly even required, to endanger your own life to save others. This article has a good overview. <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/27309/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://outorah.org/p/27309/</a>. There is also some discussion whether you are permitted to give up your life for sure to save others. A gemara in Taanit 18b that concludes self-sacrifice is permissible, but see Tzitz Eliezer 15:70 who limits the principle to a case where the sacrificer would die anyway. I think there are some shutim about it in Rav Oshry's Mimaamakim. There is a book on the subject which I found on Google but have never seen. Nahum Rakover, Mesiruth Nefesh: Giving Up One to Save the Many (Jerusalem: Library of Jewish Law, 2000).</p>\n<p>I have never heard anyone say that you need to sacrifice your own life for the sake of another individual person, for example that your spouse's or child's or rabbi's or king's life might come before your own.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Teshuvos HaRadbaz (Volume 5, response 1582) the rule that your own life comes first, applies only in a situation where the risk of you being harmed is a chance of 50 percent - meaning that the chance of you being harmed is equal to the chance of you surviving.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ritual immersion with washing of the body?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would like to know if the ritual immersion that is prescribed in the Torah requires one to wash himself as well. From what I see, the law tells you only to immerse yourself and not to wash yourself (though I know that in a way you also wash yourself a little bit by immersion).</p>\n<p>Does one fulfill the mitzva just by immersion, or does one also have to physically wash himself to fulfill it?</p>\n<p>Also, do you immerse with your clothes on? If yes, then does the same principle apply to clothes? If not, then you don't wash them at all or wash them later?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The purpose of tevillah (ritual immersion) is not for cleaning, it is to rid oneself of impurity.\nThere is, however, a problem of chatzitza (seeration) - if, for example, your leg was caked with dirt and therefor the water wouldn't be coming into direct contact with your skin, that would not be a good tevillah - you need to have no sperations at all between your body and the water.\nRegarding clothing, there are situations in which wearing very loose clothes may be okay (as the problem with wearing clothing is that they act as a chatzitza between your body and the water). However, contact your Local Orthodox Rabbi if you want to know whether that is permissible in your specific case.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>No, the immersion is just a dunk in the water. It doesn't require any kind of scrubbing. The Rambam writes in Hilchot Mikvaot 1:2  כָּל מָקוֹם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בַּתּוֹרָה רְחִיצַת בָּשָׂר וְכִבּוּס בְּגָדִים מִן הַטֻּמְאָה אֵינוֹ אֶלָּא טְבִילַת כָּל הַגּוּף בְּמִקְוֶה. \"<em>Anywhere the Torah speaks of washing the flesh or washing clothes to remove ritual impurity (tumah) it refers to immersing the whole body in a mikvah.</em>\"</p>\n<p>In terms of immersing with clothes on, the immersion should ideally be done without any clothes on. There is a principle called <em>chatzizah</em> which means a physical barrier between the skin and the water. The Talmud in Sukkah 6a-b learns this from the verse in Leviticus 14:9 “And he shall bathe his flesh in the water”--meaning the flesh comes in direct contact with the water. In some cases immersing with clothing can work, see Beitza 18a, but it's a complicated topic in practice. It's going to depend on how loose the clothing is, how well the water penetrates, etc. Google turns up a shiur (recorded lecture) on the topic in practice, which I have not listened to. <a href=\"https://etzion.org.il/en/talmud/seder-moed/massekhet-beitza/beitza-18a-tevila-clothes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://etzion.org.il/en/talmud/seder-moed/massekhet-beitza/beitza-18a-tevila-clothes</a>.</p>\n<p>Objects other than people (including clothing) sometimes needed to be immersed to remove ritual impurity. In a case where both a person and his clothing needed to be immersed, the person and clothing would have been immersed separately. By the way, most of the cases of immersion you will read about in the Bible are not practiced nowadays because without the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_heifer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Red Heifer</a> we are all in a state of incurable tumah impurity anyway. In addition, most people only needed to be ritually pure (tahor) when working in the Temple, bringing a sacrifice, or making a Temple pilgrimage, see Rosh Hashanah 16b, none of which apply nowadays. The only biblical applications of immersion nowadays are (1) a woman purifying from a state of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niddah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">niddah</a>; (2) conversion; (3) <a href=\"https://templeinstitute.org/guide-to-ascending-the-mount/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ascending the Temple mount</a>. Some people also immerse for purposes of sanctification or purification that are not directly related to biblical issues of tumah and taharah (usually men and most often before sabbath and holidays). But none of these immersions involve immersing the clothing and, therefore, are usually done without clothing.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Earliest Identification of Ishmael as Arabs / Muslims\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Both Jewish sources and Muslim sources seem to take for granted that at least some Arabs and/or Muslims are somehow descended from Abraham's son Ishmael (whether biologically or spiritually). See, for example, Mishneh Torah end of Hilchot Melakhim 11; Sefer HaIkkarim 4:42; Mefarshim to Genesis 37:27-28 and 39:1, etc. Though apparently there are traditions that some Arabs were descended from Yoktan/Joktan. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahtanite\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qahtanite</a>. Apparently some Arab authors record this tradition pre-Islam. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael#Pre-Islamic_Arabia\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishmael#Pre-Islamic_Arabia</a></p>\n<p>How old is this identification really? What are the earliest Jewish sources to support that identification? Does it match up with any evidence contemporary to the Bible in the way that, for example, archeological sources show who Moab, Babylon, and the Hittites were? If it's a later tradition, are there good theories about who made the identification and why? Basically, I'm wondering whether someone contemporary to the Torah would have clearly understood Ishmael as an origin story of the Arabs or if that arose later, and if the latter, when and why.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In Yeshayah (21:13-17) it refers to the families of “Teima” and “Keidar” - who were children of Ishmael (see Beraishis 25:13-15)  - as dwellers of “Arav”</p>\n<p>In the Tosefta (Berachos 4:14), it referrers to Ishmaelites as ״ערביים״, which translates nowadays as “Arabs”</p>\n<p>However not all ״ערביים״ are from Ishmael - in Bava Metzia (86b) it seems that there were ״ערביים״ even before Ishmael.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This article <em><a href=\"https://www.meforum.org/ishmael-father-arabs#:%7E:text=The%20commonly%20held%20view%20that,descended%20from%20Abraham%20through%20Ishmael\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ishmael is Not the Father of the Arabs</a></em> by Mark Durie suggests that the earliest proponent of the idea that Arabs were descended from Ishmael was the Roman-Jewish historian Josephus (first century CE).</p>\n<p><em>According to Sir Fergus Millar, Professor Emeritus of Ancient History at Oxford University, it was Josephus, a Jewish historian writing in the first century CE, who first advanced the idea that Ishmael was the ancestor of the Arabs. In <em>The Antiquities of the Jews</em> Josephus stated that Ishmael was \"the founder\" of the Arabian nation, and Abraham was \"their father\". From Josephus, this assumed connection between the Arabs and Abraham, through Ishmael, passed into the historical consciousness of Christians, and then made its way into early Islam</em>.</p>\n<p>See <em>The Antiquities of the Jews</em> by Flavius Josephus, Book I, Chapter 12.</p>\n<p>Concerning Abimelech: and concerning Ismael the son of Abraham: and concerning the Arabians, which were his posterity.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><p>[An. 1937] Now in a little time Abraham had a son by Sarah, as God had foretold him: whom he named Isaac: which signifies laughter. And indeed they so called him, because Sarah laughed when God (35) said that she should bear a son: she not expecting such a thing; as being past the age of child-bearing: for she was ninety years old, and Abraham an hundred, so that this son was born to them both in the last year of each of those decimal numbers. And they circumcised him upon the eighth day. (36) And from that time the Jews continue the custom of circumcising their sons within that number of days. <em><strong>But as for the Arabians, they circumcise after the thirteenth year: because Ismael, the founder of their nation, who was born to Abraham</strong></em> of the concubine, was circumcised at that age; concerning whom I will presently give a particular account, with great exactness.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As for Sarah, she at first loved Ismael, who was born of her own handmaid Hagar, with an affection not inferior to that to a son of her own; for he was brought up in order to succeed in the government. But when she herself had borne Isaac, she was not willing that Ismael should be brought up with him; as being too old for him, and able to do him injuries when their father should be dead. She therefore persuaded Abraham to send him and his mother to some distant country. Now at the first he did not agree to what Sarah was so zealous for: and thought it an instance of the greatest barbarity to send away a young child, (37) and a woman unprovided of necessaries. But at length he agreed to it, because God was pleased with what Sarah had determined; so he delivered Ismael to his mother, as not yet able to go by himself: and commanded her to take a bottle of water, and a loaf of bread; and so to depart, and to take necessity for her guide. [About An. 1930] But as soon as her necessary provisions failed, she found herself in an evil case: and when the water was almost spent, she laid the young child, who was ready to expire, under a fir tree; and went on farther; that so he might die while she was absent. But a divine Angel came to her, and told her of a fountain hard by, and bid her take care, and bring up the child: because she should be very happy by the preservation of Ishmael. She then took courage, upon the prospect of what was promised her, and meeting with some shepherds, by their care she got clear of the distresses she had been in.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>When the lad was grown up, he married a wife, by birth an Egyptian: from whence the mother was her self derived originally. <em><strong>Of this wife were born to Ishmael twelve sons: Nabaioth, Kedar, Abdeel, Mabsam, Idumas, Masmaos, Massaos, Chodad, Theman, Jetur, Naphesus, Kadmas. These inhabited all the country from Euphrates, to the Red Sea: and called it Nabatene. They are an Arabian nation, and name their tribes from these: both because of their own virtue, and because of the dignity of Abraham their father</strong></em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em><strong>Durie</strong></em> concludes:</p>\n<p>The evidence indicates that Ishmael was not the father of the Arabs, and neither was Abraham. The Ishmaelites were probably Canaanites, speaking, not an early form of Arabic, but a dialect similar to Hebrew. In time they disappeared or were absorbed into other groups, like so many other ancient peoples. Much later Josephus invoked Ishmael's name to conjure up a genealogy for the Arabs. He has a lot to answer for. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Targum_Yerushalmi_(Yonatan)/Bereshit/21.21#m6e_he_aram,en_n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yonasan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.30.6?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d'R Eliezer</a> both identify Yishmael's wives as A(d)isha and Fatima (Muhammad's wife and daughter, respectively).</p>\n\n\n",

Let me explain:</p>\n<p>There are 3 opinions as to who wrote the Haggadah: 1) In sefer Zechariah Lechaim 4a he mentions that the Haggadah was compiled by Rebbi Akiva and his source is the Yerushalmi Shekalim 5:1. 2) In Sidur HaRashban 29a he writes that Rebbi Elazar ben Hurkanus compiled the Haggadah. 3) Finally in the book Kol Hamevaser Pesach 3 Ot 12 writes that Eliyahu Hanavi compiled it and it was revealed to the sages. Whichever opinion we follow, it was in the times of the Tanaaim and earlier which means they spoke Mishnaic Hebrew (the hebrew/lashon of the Mishnah).</p>\n<p>The paragraph we say for Bedikat Chametz is found in a few places: In Mishnaic Hebrew: 1) Yerushalmi Pesachim 2:2, Rambam Hilchot Chametz Umatazah 3:7. However if you look in: Sheiltot Derav Achai Goan Siman 74, Rif, Rosh on Pesachim 6b, Sidur Rashi page 173, Machzor Vitri page 294, and others, it appears in Aramaic.</p>\n<p>Therefore I think that even though we had the paragraph of Bedikat Chametz from the Yerushalmi in Hebrew, the reason its in Aramaic is because the Geonim and Rishonim say that many words needed to be included or changed from the Hebrew text into Aramaic, because its meaning only comes out in Aramaic (just like one can’t precisely translate some words or any words from one language to another). There are many examples of this. For example, when we say  חמירא it includes all חמץ and all שאור unlike the word חמץ, and thus even if we were to say כל חמץ ושאור וכו, it wouldn't be as clear and concise (and this would also apply with other examples I didn't mention).</p>\n\n\n",

If she is younger than this, both participants are not liable, for the act is not considered as sexual relations.\"</p>\n<p>\"When a man enters into relations with a male or has a male enter into relations with him, once the corona is inserted [into the anus] they should both be stoned if they are both adults. As [Leviticus 18:22] states: \"Do not lie with a man,\" [holding one liable for the act, whether] he is the active or passive partner. If a minor of nine years and a day or more is involved, the man who enters into relations or has the minor enter into relations with him should be stoned and the minor is not liable. If the male [minor] was less than nine years old, they are both free of liability\"</p>\n<p>What caught my attention is the commentary on this passage from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960647/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-One.htm#footnote42a960647\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliyahu Touger</a> where he says: \"For until that age, her signs of virginity will regenerate and hence, relations are not of consequence.

So, this intercourse under this age (under tre year and under nine year), although it does not violate the law, is still punished.

    "content": "# Why is Moses not completely absent from the Haggadah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many explanations have been given about why Moses does not appear in the Haggadah, all of them plausible.  But, technically, Moses’ name does appear there, fleetingly.  When the rabbis recount the miracles, they quote the Torah, which says:  \"וַיַּֽאֲמִ֙ינוּ֙ בַּֽיהוָ֔ה וּבְמֹשֶׁ֖ה עַבְדּֽוֹ׃ -- The people... believed in the Lord and His servant Moses. [Exodus 14:31]\"  But he is clearly de-emphasized by being called only “God’s servant”.</p>\n<p>My question is: If the intention was to avoid mentioning Moses for a good and specific reason, why not go all the way and not mention him at all?  What's the point of spoiling that reason with a fleeting mention?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The reason Moshe Rabeinu isn't mentioned in the Haggada is because we want to attribute all the credit to Hashem, and be perfectly clear that all is from Him and Moshe has no power what so ever. The Seforim teach us that the pasuk וַיַּֽאֲמִ֙ינוּ֙ בַּֽיהוָ֔ה וּבְמֹשֶׁ֖ה עַבְדּֽוֹ, is the highest level of Emunah that Klal Yisro'el reached, that even though Moshe Rabeinu seemed to be the one to do all the miracles, and Hakadosh Boruch Hu is not visible to the naked eye, still Klal Yisroel believed in Him, and believed that Moshe is only His servant and holds no power at all on hs own.</p>\n<p>I believe with this understanding all your questions are answered, and we now have gained a clearer understanding of Moshe Rabeinu's role in Yetzias Mitzrayim, and why his name isn't mentioned in The Haggada so often.</p>\n<p>Chag Kosher ViSame'ach.</p>\n<p>Hatzlacha!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>maybe we can say that the reason why we mention his name once, is because had his name not have been mentioned at all, we wouldn’t be able to mention G-d’s name either, like the Midrash says (brought down in Akeidas Yitzchok 80:1) that the reason why G-d’s name is not mentioned in the “song of the well” (Bamidbar 21:17), is because Moshe’s name couldn’t be mentioned in it, being that because of the well, he was banned from entering the land of Israel, and the Midrash explains this with a parable, of a minister who made a feast, and did not invite the king’s friend, and the king refused to attend without him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The reason I heard is a chiddush by Rabbi Manis Friedman, which goes very well withh שלום's answer. Moshe didn't want to be mentioned because in it we talk about redemption. Yet that redemption was only fleeting. It didn't take that long before we were in galus, and Moshe said \"do me a favour, don't write of me as a redeemer in the haggadah, I don't want jews sitting in ghettos praising me for redeeming them while they are still sitting outside of their land, subjugated by the nations\".</p>\n<p>He did mention that part of the haggadah, but that's not a contradiction. It's not a statement about redemption. It's just saying that the people believed in Hashem and Moshe His servant. He's described as simply Hashem's servant, Hashem is the main point of that passage. I'll see if I can find a shiur where it is mentioned bli neder. I hope we get to see Moshe's name mentioned in the haggadah very soon!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the logic of \"You shall not abhor an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in that land.\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the logic of the reason given in Deut 23:8, \"You shall not abhor an Egyptian, for you were a stranger in that land.\"  How does the Israelites living for a while as welcome (and then as oppressed) strangers in Egypt excuse the murderous actions and oppression by the Egyptians?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Nothing in the verse \"excuses\" what the Egyptians did. Rashi on that verse explains that you should not hate the Egyptians entirely as all bad, it doesn't mean what they did is OK. The context of the verse is that certain nations (and kinds of people) are entirely cut off from joining the Jewish nation. If anything, it is the notion that Ammon and Moab are completely irredeemable even on an individual level that seems extreme and difficult to explain (at least to modern sensibilities). In contrast, the Torah tells us that even though the Egyptians did something horrible and inexcusable--which they were punished for--we should not write off the entire nation as 100% bad forever because we should also recognize that they did something good--namely, providing shelter to the nascent Jewish nation at a time of famine. It is also significant that the Torah does not say we need to love or forgive the Egyptians, just that we should not hate them or exclude them forever. Thus, it seems to me, the Torah is saying that we should relate to Egypt as a whole and to individual Egyptians based on their present attitudes and actions. To give a contemporary example, we do not need to love Germans, Christians, or Muslims unconditionally or forgive persecutions by them, but we also do not say that all Germans, Christians, or Muslims are per se irreconcilable enemies who can never get along with Jews or convert to Judaism.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Berachot 63b and Heemek Davar on that pasuk also explain that the purpose of this commandment is to inculcate in us a sense of gratitude for any slight good we receive, even if it comes from someone bad, and <em>a fortiori</em> for the good we receive from people who do not also persecute and mistreat us. (I recall seeing another gemara that mentions a similar idea, perhaps in Pesachim, but I cannot find it now).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] excuse the murderous actions and oppression by the Egyptians?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as I can tell, nowhere does this state this. This posuk is, as I try to demonstrate below, an instruction to treat others like we wanted to be treated. If someone wrongs you, G-d tells us \"do not harm that person\", rather, \"show him favour\".</p>\n<p>The Rambam, in Moreh Nevuchim (Part 3, 42:6) explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Law has taught us how far we have to extend this principle of favouring those who are near to us, and of treating kindly every one with whom we have some relationship, even if he offended or wronged us; even if he is very bad, we must have some consideration for him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shelah takes a different approach to this posuk (Torah Shebikhtav, Ki Teitzei, Torah Ohr 15):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We can better understand the reason that the Torah permits Edomites and Egyptians (of the third generation after conversion) to become fully fledged members of the Jewish people if we take a look at the historical development of Abraham, the first convert to Judaism.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah acknowledges this in 23,8: \"Do not despise Edom for he is your brother;\" this means that after living as a Jew for the third generation Esau once more qualifies as a brother of Jacob not only biologically but also spiritually. The same law applies to the absorption of Egyptians into the community of the Jewish nation. Our exile in Egypt actually commenced at the time G–d foretold Abraham about it at the covenant of the pieces in Genesis 15,13. Abraham was told that the fourth generation of his descendants would return to the land of Canaan. While in Egypt, the souls of the Jewish people were refined to the extent that they were able to become a nation comprising over 600,000 men of military age, a people that qualified for the title \"Israel,\" the honorific title bestowed by G–d on Jacob. <strong>It is appropriate therefore that the third generation of an Egyptian convert to Judaism should enjoy full equality with other Jews just as Jacob who was the third generation counting from Abraham's conversion, was pure and had shed all the spiritual פסולת which had remained from the pollutant of the serpent. Israel, too, had remained גרים, strangers, in Egypt for three generations.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I'm asking more specifically about <em>nisyonos</em> and not <em>mitzvos</em>, as I'm thinking perhaps the inherent challenge felt in the dream is more valuable.

But if just dream \"I sinned\" (in your dream you know you ate pork) or you dream of an action that could be a sin (for example, going to sleep Friday night and dreaming of writing) it doesn't mean anything. He doesn't say a person would get punished for the dream sin, perhaps it's more of a sign of spiritual deterioration.</p>\n<p>It sounds like in your dream you actually dreamt of doing a mitzva; I think the Ben Ish Chai would say midah tovah m'ruba and it's certainly a good thing.

Further, note that Chazal view the various assistances provided to the Children of Israel in the wilderness to be consequences of Avraham's actions in this episode (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.86b.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 86b</a>).

If we fail, someone gets hurt, sometimes badly. If it were possible to accomplish the same in a dream, then real life tests would be an unnecessary evil.</p>\n<p>There is no reason to presume we have free will in a dream. Only when we have explicit examples of genuinely prophetic dreams like Rambam (which is highly disputed among Rishonim), can we make a single-case presumption that he had real free will. Otherwise, we should view dreams as nothing but cloudy, static-filled noise.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As Ramchal states in Derech Hashem 3:1:6, most dreams do contain a small element of truth and prophecy, but so little that it is irrelevant to most people as it's too hard to pick out the true bits from the noise. If one has a dream, Chazal ask us to go to someone to interpret it for the good, and the meaning goes on the interpretation (Berachot Perek 9)<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>At most, view dreams as insight to where one is at. Without actually performing an action, a Jew is not held accountable as if he sinned (see Kiddushin 40a<sup>2</sup>), and a dream is just an intention at best, and even that is dubious as we haven't got proof there is free will in dreams. So at most - and this is a stretch - take it as a warning that one still has some temptations and risks in a certain area and if the situation would arise, a part of them is in danger of repeating the performance that occurred in the dream. The same goes in the converse as well; if someone surpasses a test in a dream, then great, take the confidence boost, but don't read too much into it or relax in that area.</p>\n<p>I say at most, but try to not interpret it that way.

But I heard someone once say that it’s all kinda a facade and every 4 is really 5- by the sons the fifth one is the son who never even showed up, by the cups we have the כוס אליהו, by the questions there’s that extra question in the Gemara...so does anyone know anyone or any good articles that expand on this idea?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You've got some great comments on your OP post identifying other 5s or 4/5 ambiguities. If you count the question about korbanot (Pesachim 116a) there are in fact 5, one is \"missing.\" (I assume this is what @Clint Eastwood meant). @Clint Eastwood also makes a good point about the ambiguity of whether there were 4x or 5x the plagues at the sea. I have heard the idea of the \"missing son,\" but don't know how old it is. The cup of Elija is actually based on a girsaot that say Rabbi Tarfon adds a fifth cup to the four, so there's actually a strong concept of a hidden \"fifth cup\" there. <a href=\"https://www.rabbisacks.org/archive/the-missing-fifth/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> cited in a comment explains the origins of Elija's cup.

And even if there isn't a fifth cup, then there is a fifth expression of geulah not represented by a cup.</p>\n<p>I cannot give you an answer that is specific to the haggadah, but I can tell you that the idea of \"four that are really five\" is a very common theme in kabbalistic thought. For example, in the introduction to Tolaat Yaakov the author describes how Hashem created an initial world of \"Adam Kadmon\" (probably similar to \"Ein Sof\") and from there the \"four worlds\" emendated. You will also see in many places that the four letters of God's name can really be broken into the 4 plus the tip of the yod, which represents the unity or invisibility of ein sof. The Shaarei Kedusha of Rav Chaim Vitale talks about this idea and it's also discussed in more recent \"Chassidus\" sefarim like Siftein Chein and Emunat Eitekha. Whether we are seeing kabbalah influencing the Haggada, both of them reflecting a common tradition, or coincidence is beyond me.</p>\n\n\n",

I would even go so far as to say it ultimately comes down to semantics - if god is defined as \"The singular being with complete and absolute power, ineffable, that which always was and always will be, and Who created everything and is everything\", then it follows that there could only be one such being, and that is Hashem. If we instead define the word \"god\" as \"someone or something really big or really strong, with capability that dwarfs any normal human, but not necessarily infinite in scale\", then I think it is not, strictly speaking, \"un-Jewish\" to say that multiple beings fit that criteria provided that we recognize their subservience to/inferiority relative to Hashem, from whom all other beings descend. Indeed, by that definition it could be said that Gabriel, the Leviathan, or even Og, are, in some sense of the word, \"gods\", but much smaller/limited in scope and scale/undeserving of worship/otherwise total squares compared to Hashem.</p>\n<p>Is my reasoning correct, or is there a clear prohibition against ever acknowledging any validity of another deity, no matter how it is justified or downplayed?</p>\n<p>Note: I use Helios as an example because there are a handful of cases in which synagogues of the ancient world contained pictures of Helios or other references to him, making Helios a genuine comparison. The prevailing scholarly theory is that these synagogues were not heretical Jewish groups who believed in Helios as an independent deity per se, but rather began to consider the gods of the surrounding nations to be angels while not actually worshiping them. My question is inspired by that, and essentially asks whether such a thing or its logical extension is possible/halakhically permissible.</p>\n<p>Update: I'll note that the first and second of the ten commandments are \"I am the Lord your God\", and \"You shall have no other gods <em>before me</em>\". As far as I can tell, this could mean \"I am your God, and the other godlike beings are not your God, even if they could be defined as a god by some definitions\", and \"You shall have no other gods before/above me, or receiving worship, but not necessarily after me [in the manner I described two paragraphs above]\".</p>\n<p>Also, to be clear, I do not believe in Helios or any other such thing, but I still think it's an interesting question.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Absolutely forbidden.

Enosh himself was one\nof those who erred.</p>\n<p>Their mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres\nwith which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated\nthem with honor, making them servants who minister before Him.\nAccordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat\nthem with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed\nbe He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and\nhonored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him\nbe honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.\nAfter conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to\nthe stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify\nthem with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by\ndoing so, they would - according to their false conception - be\nfulfilling the will of God.\n<strong>This was the essence of the worship of false gods</strong>, and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them. <em>They would <strong>not</strong> say that\nthere is no other god except for this star.</em>[!]</p>\n<p>This message was conveyed by Jeremiah, who declared (10:7-8): \"Who\nwill not fear You, King of the nations, for to You it is fitting.\nAmong all the wise men of the nations and in all their kingdoms, there\nis none like You.

Anything else is very inappropriate and perverse.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note: a chiddush by the Lubavitcher Rebbe. Why  is the above \"history lesson\" given as a \"halacha\" by Rambam, and not in an intro or philosophical work? Because <em><strong>knowing</strong></em> what is wrong and stupid about Avodah Zara is halacha. One can't fulfil this mitzva by simply not doing it, or simply remaining apathetic, or ignorant.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* - note, it has been raised several times that the Rambam looks to be basing this statement on the actual temple sacrifices and bowing just mentioned. This is not the case. This whole halacha is outlining the mitzva of שלא לפנות אחר עבודה זרה, which includes not reading about them, inquiring about them, or even thinking about them at all. See Negative Commandment 47. Sefer Hachinuch encodes this as a separate Mitzva and a full discussion would be a huge undertaking.<br />\nThe point that we are allowed to believe in supernatural powers created by Hashem doesn't apply to pagan gods - we would have to be talking about something that is part of Emet, something revealed through prophecy or Torah, for the points made to apply.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a really thought-provoking question. We need to begin with the Rambam. Most of the prohibitions around avoda zara are based on practice rather than belief: worship, making images, etc. However, the Rambam is the main source for the idea that belief in avoda zara is asur in and of itself. (If you study the rishonim, you will see that this really is an unusual approach. This is a long topic For a thorough analysis see Marc Shapiro's <em>The Limits of Orthodox Theology</em>.).</p>\n<p>The Rambam writes in Sefer HaMitzvot, Lav #1 היא שהזהירנו מהאמין באל אחר זולתו. והוא אמרו יתעלה לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים על פני. What does he mean that it is asur to \"believe in another god\"\" Clearly it is not asur to believe in supernatural beings other than the one God, such as angels, demons, sea monsters, spirits, etc. But when someone says \"I believe Helios exists but was created by God and subservient to God and should not be worshipped,\" it sounds to me like he doesn't really think Helios is a god at all. Rather, he is <em>functionally</em> saying Helios is an angel or something similar. To give an extreme analogy, it seems a bit like saying \"I believe Bigfoot is real but he's actually just a regular moose that people have mistaken for an ape-like cryptid.\" Why would that be asur? I can think of two hava aminas.</p>\n<p>First, maybe it's asur to believe that the gods of the non-Jews <em>exist at all</em>. I.e., there is some kind of prohibition to give credence to their incorrect beliefs.  That would mean it's asur to believe that the being Helios exits period, whatever you call him. However, I do not think that would be correct, because Rambam himself writes in Hilkhos Avodah Zarah 1:1 that idolatry arose out of the mistaken practice of worshiping God's messengers like the sun and the moon. Thus, avodah zarah isn't the belief in something that isn't real but rather the belief that something other than God is an independent being worthy of worship. Put another way, if someone worships the Sun, you don't have to say \"I don't believe the Sun is real,\" you just cannot believe the Sun acts independently of Hashem or worship the Sun, etc.  So if Helios is basically a mistaken proxy for the sun, or the angel (or sar or whatever) of the sun, I don't think believing he <em>exists</em> would be asur according to the Rambam. I.e., I do not think the Rambam would prohibit you from saying \"the Greeks who worshipped Helios were really worshiping the angel in charge of the sun and mistook him for a god.\"</p>\n<p>The second, and more interesting possibility, is that the word \"god\" has a special power, and it is prohibited simply to call something other than the one true God a \"god\" even if you don't mean that thing is in fact a god in any meaningful way. As OP points out, this seems like more of a semantic issue than a theological one. This could potentially have far reaching applications. For example, what about calling the Beatles \"gods of Rock and Roll\"? (OTOH maybe there is a distinction between something someone might actually come to believe is an independent deity, but we don't worry aboutcommon slang.)</p>\n<p>I have never heard of such a prohibition and don't see evidence of one in the other answers to this post. The only relevant source I can find or think of is Psalms 82:6-8 where the psalmist says: \"6 I have said, <strong>Ye are gods</strong>; and all of you are children of the most High. / 7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes. / 8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all nations.\" Apparently, King David did not have a problem calling people \"gods\" when saying they are mortal and subject to Divine judgment. To be fair, Rashi and Radak say that the word doesn't really mean \"gods,\" which is plausible grammatically. But either way it uses the Hebrew word for \"god\" or \"gods,\" and we also see elsewhere that Biblical Hebrew calls judges or lords \"elohim,\" (e.g., Exodus 21:6), which suggests that there is no prohibition to call something a \"god\" if you don't ascribe it god-like qualities.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> in the hypothetical scenario described in the OP, it sounds like you don't really believe Helios is a \"god\" at but more of a supernatural being. It does not seem that there is a prohibition to (a) believe that supernatural being exists or (b) refer to him as the (false) \"god\" Helios because you don't really think he is a god or treat him as such. It's just \"word games.\" But I don't have a clear proof for that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The 2nd one of the Aseres Hadibros:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall have no other gods before Me.

However, there does not seem to be support that Hashem is contradicting Himself in this. What's actually happening appears similar to <em>midda k'negged midda</em>. The prophets who gave Achav the false prophecy were deliberately trying to procure a false prophecy from shamayim. This is a power available to false prophets, see Derech Hashem 3:4:10. This power is available because Hashem tests us with false prophets (Devarim 13:4).</p>\n<p>The prophets were trying to gain faith from Achav by saying what he wanted to hear so they deliberately tapped into actual prophecy, but from the <em>impure forces</em> of prophecy that are available as we stated above. This created a debate in shamayim and a certain lying spirit called Nabot appeared before Hashem and asked if he could punish Achav by seducing him to his death in battle and Hashem agreed. The seduction was accomplished by the lying spirit that was put into the mouth of Tzidkiyah (see Sanhedrin 89a), which fooled him to say what he believed to be true (so he wasn't \"lying\"), but was actually false - that Achav would be triumphant in the battle and he heard it from God (Micaiah simply said that he will be triumphant, not that he heard it from God).</p>\n<p>So, this doesn't show that God needs man to lie because He said He wouldn't/can't. In fact, it appears that no man is lying here and God approved of this lie through this \"lying spirit of Nabot\" i.e. you could basically say that God is doing the lying here Himself (this is what an angel is - a faithful messenger of Hashem's word), and the reason Hashem does that is, as we have discussed above - false prophets are a test, and in this case it seems it is a test provided along lines akin to <em>midda k'negged midda</em>. Achav clearly didn't want to hear the truth, jailed Micaiah for always speaking it, and also all his prophets were trying to lie to him on purpose.</p>\n<p>See Derech Hashem 3:4:11 for a full discussion of this event.</p>\n\n\n",

Based on ideas in the commentary איפה שלומה on  by R' Akiva Moshe Silber, the argument between R' Meir and R' Yehudah results from the choice of the verses. Rabbi Meir speaks about greatness of spirit of entire shevatim based on Tehilim 68. According to the verses beginning with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.68.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">68:28</a>, he is trying to justify why the Beis haMikdash was mostly in the territory of Binyamin and partially in the territory of Yehudah. Perhaps, he wants to say that in achieving <em>kedusha</em>, the quality of <em>gevurah</em> of shevet Binyamin is more important than <em>chesed</em> of shevet Yehudah, because <em>yiras shamayim</em> is rooted in <em>gevurah</em> while <em>chesed</em> gives rise to <em>chasidus</em>. (1)</p>\n<p>It seems, Rabbi Yehudah seeks to resolve a different problem. He is justifying why shevet Yehudah merited kingship. He speaks about greatness of spirit of specific individuals within each shevet. Likely, R' Yehuda wants to also explain why kings from Shevet Yehudah were greater than kings from Shevet Ephraim. Perhaps, he wants to say that for a king a quality of <em>chesed</em> of people in shevet Yehudah, as leaders on behalf of others, is more important than <em>gevurah</em> of peole of shevet Ephraim - ability to withstand other people's criticism. Therefore, R' Yehudah uses <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.69.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 69:3-16</a> traditionally understood as the prayer of Nachshon ben Aminadav as he stood against the waters of the sea. Nachshon struggled and prayed for the sake of all Jewish people who stood behind him.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1) There is a distinction between <em>yiras shamaim</em> and <em>chassidus</em>. Based on Abarbanel's commentary on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 2:8</a>, R' Yose haKohen is <em>chasid</em> while R' Shimon ben Nethanel is <em>yirei chet</em>. I.e. they are two different ways to go beyond the letter of the law: <em>chasid</em> - in performing positive mitzvos, <em>yirei chet</em> - in performing negative mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n",

He cites that according to the Shulchan Aruch, <em>almost</em> all prohibitions are suspended when a risk to life exists. He also cites Gemara as saying that Shabbos can be violated even for a doubtful risk to life. He concludes that carrying a gun outside an eruv is subjective and one should obviously consult their LOR. It would perhaps make sense that this can be applied to a red dot as well, assuming the optic actually makes a significant difference in the shooter's ability to save lives. The essay also cites sources seeming to rule that guns are not muktze. I'm not sure that this can apply to red dots as well, so the pekuach nefesh issue is maybe the one to rely on, even in the instance that you're carrying inside an eruv.</p>\n\n\n",

How we balance they kept their jewish names /language/clothing verses gd had to redeem them or they wouldn't be redeemed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer to the question is not simple or straightforward. In fact, there seems to be a contradiction between two sources in the Tanakh that describe the spiritual state of the Jews in Mitzrayim. In Shemos (Exodus) 4:29-31, we read that Moshe and Aharon gathered the elders of Israel and told them what God had said to Moshe at the burning bush. They also performed signs and wonders to prove their authenticity. The verse says: \"And the people believed; and when they heard that the Lord had remembered the children of Israel, and that He had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.\" This implies that the Jews in Mitzrayim had faith in God and His promises, and that they accepted Moshe as their leader and redeemer.</p>\n<p>However, in Yechazkel (Ezekiel) 20:5-8, we read a different account. God tells Yechazkel to remind the rebellious house of Israel of their history and their sins. He says: \"And I said unto them: Cast ye away every man the detestable things of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the Lord your God. But they rebelled against Me, and would not hearken unto Me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things of their eyes, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.\" This implies that the Jews in Mitzrayim were idol worshipers and rebels against God, and that they did not listen to Moshe or follow his instructions.</p>\n<p>How can we reconcile these two sources? How can we understand the spiritual condition of the Jews in Mitzrayim? There are several approaches that have been suggested by various commentators and scholars over the centuries. Here are some of them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>According to the Midrash that the OP mentioned (Vayikra Rabbah 32:5), one of the merits that enabled the Jews to be redeemed from Mitzrayim was that they did not change their names or language (and according to some versions, also their clothing). This means that they preserved some aspects of their identity and culture as a distinct nation, even though they assimilated in other ways. The Abarbanel (Bereishis 15:14) suggests that this was a result of a mixed attitude towards idolatry among the Jews. He says that some of them believed in both God and idols, while others rejected idolatry completely. He explains that those who believed in both God and idols had a sense of pride and dignity as the children of Abraham, and therefore kept their names and language as a sign of their heritage. However, those who rejected idolatry completely were more humble and modest, and therefore changed their names and language to avoid drawing attention to themselves or provoking hostility from their oppressors.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Ran (Bereishis 15:14) and Eliyahu Rabbah (21) say that the Jews in Mitzrayim were completely monotheistic and never served idols. They explain that Yechazkel 20:5-8 refers only to a minority of Jews who were influenced by the Egyptian culture and worshiped idols. However, the majority of Jews remained faithful to God and His covenant. They say that this is why Moshe was able to gather them all together and convince them to follow him out of Mitzrayim.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Based on these approaches, we can understand how different opinions may view the balance between the urgency and necessity of the redemption from Mitzrayim. According to those who say that the Jews only did not change their language or name (and maybe clothing), they were on the cusp of losing their identity and faith completely. Therefore, God had to intervene at that exact moment to save them from total assimilation and destruction. However, according to those who say that the Jews were monotheistic and loyal to God, they were not in such a dire situation. Therefore, God could have waited longer or chosen a different time or method for their redemption.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alhatorah.org/Religious_Identity_in_Egypt/2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://alhatorah.org/Religious_Identity_in_Egypt/2</a> Brings many more sources and opinions</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Jews (with the exception of the Levites) were literally serving idols and fully mired in Egyptian sin, as related in the Haggadah.\nThere were those three differences of custom, and they had heard that they would be redeemed, but were essentially spiritually equivalent to Egyptian hedonists. They kept custom out of habit and not out of profound religious meditation. If they had all decided to stay Egyptian, it wouldn't matter how they dressed; they would not have been redeemed because they wouldn't have even wanted it. I hope that addresses the question sufficiently, but if not please expand.</p>\n<p>(Significantly though, the sefer מנהג ישראל תורה relates in the introduction that this shows how important Jewish customs are. If we were idol worshippers and were redeemed just for these customs, that demonstrates that keeping even small customs like these can save the Jewish nation. We shouldn't make light of abandoning our Jewish names, language, or dress.</p>\n<p>Likewise, the author relates how Jewish communities withstood forceful efforts to convert or assimilate Jews for hundreds of years that were largely unsuccessful, until the reform movement  came around and started to attempt to make changes to Jewish custom instead of law, a new kind of attack with devastating results. Historically, that period then saw entire communities fall to assimilation and intermarriage.</p>\n<p>Further, he points out that anti-judaic philosophers and debaters were historically only ever really successful against those who considered themselves knowledgeable enough to debate Jewish custom; the majority unlearned population, and virtually all Jewish women, never fell prey to such attempts.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is Chametz?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During Pesach and Chag Matztzoth, there are many beliefs of what needs to be removed during this time, and what chametz actually is. I.e., there’s the removal of just yeast, then there’s the removal of yeast, baking soda, baking powder, soaps, and etc. With that being said, what is <em><strong>chametz</strong></em> according to the <em><strong>letter of the law</strong></em>? Does baking soda and baking powder fall into the category of “<em>chametz</em>?” Also, do soaps, detergents, and cleaners need to be removed along with the yeast?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There is chometz and Seor which both need to be removed.\nSe'or is loosely translated as yeast, in reality, it is a sourdough starter made from wheat, barley, spelt, and barley (or oat). Yeast these days is not made from the 5 grains, therefore according to the letter of the law need not be removed.</p>\n<p>Chometz is flour which has come into contact with liquid and has been dormant for a period of time that allows the food to become chimutz (wheat flour and water under normal circumstances is 18 minutes) before being baked it then becomes chometz.</p>\n<p>This is according to the letter of the Law. Obviously, a Rabbi should be consulted about individual minhagim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the strict letter of the law chametz is one of the five grains that has become fermented. See Pesachim 35a. The five grains are traditionally identified as wheat, barley, spelt, rye, and oats, though some of these identifications (especially oats) are somewhat controversial. In theory, other grains (such as rice and millet), pure yeast, chemical compounds (such as baking soda) are not chametz. You can see some more background here. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chametz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chametz</a>. The problem is that, especially in this day and age, many products many contain mixtures of chametz, which is why kosher consumers rely on annual lists of what products do not require kosher supervision for Passover and, for all other products, require kosher certification.</p>\n<p>There are also many complicated and subtle details of defining chametz that are relevant to these questions. For example, what if chametz is a minority or trace ingredient? What if the product contains chametz but is no longer \"food,\" such as soap (and how do you define \"no longer food\")? How do you identify when fermentation has begun? What accelerates or slows the fermentation process? These are all very complicated areas of halakhah and people often take a strict approach to be safe. In addition, the cultural and religious practice has become to add many many stringencies to the prohibition against eating chametz for a variety of reasons. As just one example, most Ashkenazi Jews do not eat <em>kitniyot</em> or legumes, even though they are not chametz. See Mishnah Berurah to 453:6. All of these factors are why you see people throwing out or storing away many products that one would not think contain chametz or in fact do not contain any chametz.</p>\n\n\n",

I have some ideas.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>With regard to the Rule of Law, in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%92_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 3:2</a>, Rabbi Chanina S'gan Hakohanim says that one ought to pray for the government's stability, <strong>because</strong> the fear of governmental punishment prevents social wrongdoing <em>(see Tiferes Yisrael on this same Mishna for a precise description of the attitudes that are being combated by fear of punishment)</em>.</p>\n<p>Commentaries like Bartenura and Tiferes Yisrael make it very clear that this Mishna refers to gentile governments as well as Jewish ones. With that in mind, I think it's possible to infer from this source that the chief thing one hopes for from a government - the thing one prays for - is keeping social order, which accords with the Rule of Law doctrine.</p>\n<p>(Of course, the Jewish kingdom and Sanhedrin had other functions as well, including the enforcement of charity and religious observance, but we are speaking here in the context of gentile governments, presumably.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 5:10</a> , there are four understandings of how society ought to share its wealth.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Individuals should strive to only benefit from their own work, and desire that others feel equally independent. (sounds like liberatarianism, no?)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The collective should be happy to share with each other in permissive fashion, and look forward to receiving benefit from others as well. (communism?)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Everyone should strive to contribute to others, but should be repulsed by the idea of receiving benefit from others.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Everyone should take what they can and contribute as little as they can get away with.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, the Mishna identifies the first view as the purview of Sodom (i.e. also an evil view), and the rationale given in one of the commentaries is relevant to our question, so I'll bring it:</p>\n<p>The Bartenura says that the fierce desire that others be independent by not being forced to give their work (which is an application of voluntaryism), can lead to a callousness to the need of others, so much so that one might not help someone else even when it would cost him nothing. That was a Sodomite trait, to expect everyone to take care of themselves, even when helping them would be easy for society.</p>\n<p>To solidify this idea that we can ascribe this Mishna at least in part to explain the psychological origins of some values of societal systems like libertarianism, it's worth mentioning that regarding the second case, the Bartenura's description also seems to describe a (nonviolent variant of) the communist view. The Mishna describes one who holds the second view as \"עם הארץ\", which the Bartenura explains refers to someone who wants to improve the world but has no insight into the right way to do it.</p>\n<p>(Notably, I should mention that according to Tosfos Yom Tov and Tiferes Yisrael, this Mishna does <strong>not</strong> discuss charity, but instead other types of communal benefit like helping others with work.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(Your third source isn't exactly a value or creed, it's more of a statistical analysis of the negative correlation between libertarianism and violence. It does advance the idea that countries with more diversity of interest and diffuse power are less likely to decide on war than those with tighter control, but I personally don't know of a related source to that principle, so I'll skip to the next one.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are laws in place regarding doing business with thieves, whereby Jewish social obligation prevents one from deriving any benefit from their property when it is assumed to be stolen. See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088889/jewish/Gezelah-vaAvedah-Chapter-Five.htm#v7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Hilchos Gezelah Va'avedah, 5:7-10</a>. While this isn't exactly a description of the origin of social enforcement of contracts, it does show to what degree the Sages implemented it by tuning how much leniency they showed (to protect the free flow of goods in the market, for if they were to require you to return anything you purchased fairly that later turned out to have been stolen, you would be afraid to purchase from anyone you don't know.)</p>\n<p>Note that they could not have truly permitted business with stolen property even if they had wanted to, because as Rambam says in the first halacha of that chapter, doing business with a thief violates a scriptural prohibition. The only thing that could be done was to determine whether you need to return the original article or whether you must pay the original owner and may then sue the thief to reimburse you.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In the Jewish system of government, there wasn't exactly what you might call decentralization in a political sense, but the concern for it can be seen here in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=4/8/2023&rambamChapters=3#v9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam hilchos Edus, 11:9</a>. We see that in order to prevent the overlapping of the King's power with the court's , the king is excluded from testimony.</p>\n<p>(<em>Note: I'm pretty sure I've seen somewhere that a king can be subject to legal action, and that Rambam agrees, but I can't remember where. Somewhere in the laws of malkus maybe? Be aware that this last source probably could use some more context.</em>)</p>\n\n\n",

In all these cases, the human contact is purely mechanical, and does not involve personal sexual contact with the animal.</p>\n<p>There's also a general prohibition of sexually arousing oneself, unless the arousal is in the context of permitted sexual activity.</p>\n<p>Animal breeders are generally considered not to be aroused by their activities, since they're focused on their work, and it's not expected to cause them to have sexual thoughts. However if a person were to find themselves being sexually aroused from such activity, then they would be prohibited from being involved with this type of work.</p>\n<p>Based on the above, a person who has a sexual fetish with animals, is not allowed to conduct any activity with an animal that gives them sexual gratification.

And he finishes the command by '' So let it be written, so shall it be done''. Still nothing was written as a law...</p>\n<p>In light of this, how do we explain the factual existence of Moshe?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The below information is taken from: <a href=\"https://www.mayimachronim.com/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.mayimachronim.com/</a> - the article is called \"Archaeology Discovers Moses.\"</p>\n<p>\"One of the most common questions that people ask about the Exodus is: where is the evidence? The truth is that there is a great deal of evidence supporting the subjugation and liberation of the Israelites from ancient Egypt. Much of the evidence has been deliberately suppressed (as explained here), and other pieces of evidence are just not discussed or not well-known. Perhaps the greatest of the latter variety is the Mose Stele. This incredible archaeological find is possibly the best proof that we have of the existence of Moses, and the details of his unique life.</p>\n<p>The Mose Stele was found in the village of Qantir, just two kilometres away from the ancient Egyptian city of Pi-Ramesses. The Torah states explicitly that the Israelites built the city of Pi-Ramesses (Exodus 1:11). We know that Pi-Ramesses was built atop the more ancient city of Avaris, which was actually a Hyksos city. Recall that the Hyksos were Semitic foreigners who migrated to Egypt and, at one point, even took over much of the kingdom. Excavations at Avaris (in the northeast of Egypt, a region the Torah calls “Goshen”) show architecture in Canaanite and Syriac style. Amazingly, archaeologists have even found numerous seals bearing the name “Yaqub”.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, among others, scholars both ancient and modern believe that the Hyksos and the Israelites are one and the same. Already two millennia ago, Josephus identified the Hyksos (which he translated as “shepherd kings”) as the Israelites. If not completely one and the same, it is also highly possible that the Israelites were part of a larger wave of Semitic migration, and were initially a small group among the Hyksos. Whatever the case, the Hyksos as a whole were officially defeated by Pharaoh Ahmose I, who established the 18th dynasty around 1550 BCE.</p>\n<p>The following dynasty, starting in 1292 BCE, was founded by Ramesses I. His grandson was Ramesses II, the Great (r. 1279-1213 BCE), who ruled for a whopping 66 years. It was Ramesses II who built Pi-Ramesses and made it his new capital, and it is Ramesses II who is typically identified as the pharaoh of the Exodus. This is disputed for several reasons, including that the timing of Ramesses’ reign is both too long after the Hyksos defeat and a bit too late to fit with traditional Jewish chronology (which holds that the Exodus was in 2448 AM, or 1312 BCE). However, Ramesses’ reign is quite close to the Jewish dating and the chronology of ancient Egypt is not exactly known and may very well have discrepancies.</p>\n<p>One of the artifacts that we have from the time of Ramesses II is the Mose Stele. It describes a great general in Ramesses’ army. The general’s name is Mose (hence the name of the stele). In ancient Egyptian, this word simply meant a “son” or “begotten by”. Ramesses, for instance, means “son of Ra” or “begotten by Ra”, Ra being the sun god and one of the chief deities of the Egyptian pantheon. We find many Egyptians with mose or mses as a suffix in their name, including Ahmose, Thutmose, and countless others. “Mose” would just mean “son”, which is strange at first glance, since it carries no qualifying prefix. However, it makes perfect sense when we go to the Torah and remember that the daughter of Pharaoh adopted baby Moses and named him. While the Torah says she named him Moshe because she took him out (meshitihu) of the water (Exodus 2:10), it is highly unlikely that an Egyptian princess would give the baby a Hebrew name. She would have named him Mose, in Egyptian, meaning the long-awaited “son” she always wanted. Moshe is indeed his true Hebrew name, as God intended, which is why the Torah records the proper Hebrew etymology. Of course, in Hebrew both Moshe and Mose would be spelled exactly the same anyway (משה), since the shin and sin are one letter with interchangeable sound. Thus, he could simultaneously be “Moshe” to his Hebrew brethren, and “Mose” for his fellow Egyptian royalty among whom he grew up!</p>\n<p>The Mose Stele says that Mose was a victorious soldier, and Ramesses is shown lavishing gifts upon him. Ramesses declares: “How good is what he has done! Great, great!” Was the Biblical Moses a soldier? The Torah doesn’t quite say so explicitly, but the Talmud and Midrash do describe Moses as a warrior in several places. The most famous is where Moses is described participating in the battle against Og, and smiting the giant himself (Berakhot 54b). Lesser known is the Midrash that says Moses was once a great general in the land of Cush (see, for instance, Yalkut Shimoni I, 168). This is how he ended up marrying a Cushite woman, as the Torah later mentions in Numbers 12:1 (for more on this see ‘Did Moses Have a Black Wife?’) While the Midrash generally assumes that this happened after Moses fled Egypt and before he came to Midian, Josephus provides an alternate account that says Moses fought in Cush while still an Egyptian prince (Antiquities, II, 10:239). Before he fled, Moses was a highly decorated general in the Egyptian army, and helped the Egyptians subdue their Cushite neighbours.</p>\n<p>The Mose Stele fits perfectly with Josephus’ ancient account. Moses returns from battle with Cush as a victorious general, and is praised by Ramesses. The stele adds that Mose is “beloved of Atum and greatly favoured by him”. Atum was none other than the Egyptian creator god, the first of their gods, and the originator of all the others. It is fascinating to note that while Ramesses’ patron god was Ra, the stele describes Mose as being favoured by Atum, not Ra. We can learn from this that Moses was already something of a monotheist among the Egyptian royalty: he made sure that they knew he worshiped only the one true creator God. For the Egyptians, the closest thing to that was Atum! This is how Moses could have masked his Hebrew beliefs while growing up with idolaters in the palace.</p>\n<p>There is one last connection to Moshe in the Mose Stele. Ramesses is quoted as saying that he is “pleased with the speech of [Mose’s] mouth”. The Torah tells us that Moses was “heavy” of speech, and Moses himself humbly sought to shy away from oration. The fact that the stele mentions the speech of Mose is unlikely to be a coincidence. Perhaps Ramesses put it there specifically to address the critiques of others who disparaged Moses for his speech difficulties. Moses silenced his critics, and Ramesses declared that he is pleased with the speech of Moses, despite what others might say.</p>\n<p>All in all, the Mose Stele is an amazing piece of evidence that strongly supports the existence of the Biblical Moses. It was likely commissioned by Ramesses II while Moses was still a young Egyptian prince and general, before he fled, and long before he returned decades later to liberate his people. We can imagine that after the events of the Exodus, the angry Egyptians would have destroyed any mention of Moses, and would have tried to expunge any relic of his name or life. Thankfully, at least one piece of evidence has nonetheless survived, buried and hidden away for millennia. What other incredible treasures are still lying deep under the sand, waiting to be uncovered?\"</p>\n<p>*There is also a picture of The Mose Stele in the link above.</p>\n\n\n",

The response was to to observe the custom of your fathers that you received for the reasons stated.</p>\n<p>It seems like the people in Bovel did not feel that they were missing the emanations in only one day. Further the warning that came back from Israel did not mention this point of being unable to get the emanations in one day.</p>\n<p>So my question is how does the view that people outside Israel must have two days Yom Tov for spiritual reasons fit with the reason given in the Gemoro in Beitzah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The problem is even deeper than that. There were places in chutz l'aretz near Israel that observed 1 day based on where the messengers reached. See Rosh Hashana 21a. Conversely, in the view of the Rambam, there are places in Israel that should observe 2 days because the messengers did not go there! Mishneh Torah, Sanctification of the New Month 5:9-12.</p>\n<p>So I think this is one of those cases where you need to say that there is a technical reason and there is a deeper spiritual reason we use to explain it. This is not so different from the many other places where we come up with \"reasons\" for the mitzvot or Biblical events. For example, there are many drashot explaining why God killed the Egyptian firstborn, but the Torah itself (Shmot 4:21-23) says it is because Israel is God's firstborn. Likewise, the Sefer HaChinukh in explaining the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.386.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reasons for the mitzvah of tzitzit</a> acknowledges the reason given in the Torah but also gives additional reasons about what the tzitzit symbolize. Perhaps we could also reframe the issue as being a spiritual explanation for why the custom of yom tov sheini arose and persists even though it raises a lot of halakhic issues (extra berakhot, bitul melakhah, bal tosif) and doesn't seem to be based on a very realistic concern nowadays. After all, not every minhag that could be introduced is introduced, and not every minhag that is introduced survives.</p>\n\n\n",

See Melachim 9:8 and Ishut 1:1. No specific ceremony is required. The big question is what \"wife\" means in this context, because Rambam doesn't seem to contemplate a situation where people live together but are not married.

Today, however, engagement is really just a non-binding promise to get married. If the live-in boyfriend-girlfriend relationship is not marriage, I don't see how a contemporary engagement would be any different.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do the Rabbis maintain that a sukkah is a דירת עראי if Queen Helene's sukkah was over 20 amos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Gemara the Rabbanan maintain that a sukkah is a דירת עראי. There are many contextual indications to this fact within Masechet Sukkah. However, one of the most pointed statements regarding this is in Yoma 10b where it directly states: ורבנן לטעמייהו, דאמרי: סוכה דירת עראי בעינן.  This being the case, there does not appear to be any מפרשים that explain the logical flow of the Gemara that clearly demonstrates how the Rabbis maintained their opinion that a sukkah is a דירת עראי in opposition to Rebbi Yehuda, when Rebbi Yehuda brings a מעשה on Sukkah 2b regarding Queen Helene’s sukkah that was over 20 amos high and the Elders were silent, as the Baraisa states: סוכה שהיא גבוהה למעלה מעשרים אמה — פסולה ורבי יהודה מכשיר עד ארבעים וחמשים אמה. אמר רבי יהודה: מעשה בהילני המלכה בלוד שהיתה סוכתה גבוהה מעשרים אמה, והיו זקנים נכנסין ויוצאין לשם ולא אמרו לה דבר.</p>\n<p>My question: <strong>Assuming the Rabbis who hold that a sukkah is a דירת עראי are the Tanna Kamma of Mishna 2a,</strong> which states that a sukkah above 20 amos is invalid, what logical defense did they employ to avoid refutation by Rebbi Yehuda’s Baraisa regarding Queen Helene’s sukkah that was over 20 amos high and the Elders were silent?</p>\n<p>Finally, I am not asking what the halacha is, but what is the logical defense of the Rabbis position that allows them to remain in opposition to Rebbi Yehuda which is evidenced in Yoma 10b and Sukkah 3a, 3b, 9a, ect.</p>\n<p>After much research my tentative conclusion of what the answer is required reframing several concepts in Masechet Sukkah and is located at <a href=\"https://sukkah.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://sukkah.org</a> where I maintain a work in-progress page.  It's too lengthy to directly post here. However, to summarize it seems the Rabbis supports a concept of a דירת עראי being over 20 amos high when it is less than 4x4 amos in length without conflicting with other other parts of the Gemara. Where it appears to do so a good explanation is provided.</p>\n<p>My hope by posting this was to have either confirmation that I have learned correctly or if others cannot peer review my work due to its length, for them to post any other logical thread of the Rabbis' position without contradictions that I could consider in my understanding of Masechet Sukkah. Thank you in advance for your time. Best Regards.</p>\n<p>//Break//</p>\n<p>Thank you for the responses provided. I really appreciate the conversation.</p>\n<p><strong>@Anonymous</strong> brought the תוספות רי\"ד and ריטבא who suggests that “R. Yehuda’s citation of the ma‘aseh as proof rests on his assumption that the entire structure exceeded twenty amot, whereas the Rabbanan (and Rava) understood that there were two distinct spaces”.</p>\n<p><strong>An updated response:</strong> After explaining Rebbi Yehuda’s Baraisa of Queen Helene’s sukkah which was higher than 20 amos, the Gemara on 2b describes his disputes with R’ Yoshiyah, Rav Huna, and Rav Chanan bar Rabbah, but seemingly makes no effort to describe the dispute with Rava who holds that a sukkah is a דירת עראי.</p>\n<p>This becomes even more intriguing because unlike the other three opinions the halacha seemingly agrees with Rava that a sukkah is a דירת עראי and yet the Gemara never directly describes his dispute with Rebbi Yehuda outside of the Mishna.  Furthermore, this dispute should be of particular interest to the Gemara since its description and details would reveal the context in which the polar-opposite opinions of Rebbi Yehuda (a sukkah is a דירת קבע) and Rava (a sukkah is a דירת עראי) are pitted against each other.  However, the Gemara did not do this. Why?</p>\n<p>The תוספות רי\"ד and ריטבא address this glaring omission in stating that for Rava we can modify the understanding of Rebbi Yehuda’s Baraisa and say that Queen Helene’s sukkah had two rooms, one room was 20 amos or lower and the other room was higher than 20 amos.  And even though the queen was sitting in the room with the higher s’chach that was invalid, the elders did not say a word to her because her sons were sitting the valid sukkah which was 20 amos or lower in height.  This approach (while never mentioned in the Gemara) provides a framework within which a logical defense for Rava’s opinion can be sustained.</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara’s context and the orchestrated flow of the discussion seems to indicate a reason for the Gemara’s omission and reveals a different understanding of the nature of the dispute between Rebbi Yehuda and Rava, between קבע and עראי.  To do this the Gemara needed to first inform us through using a series of deductions that Rava’s opinion that a sukkah is a דירת עראי is derived from Beis Hillel and that Beis Hillel’s understanding of a דירת עראי includes the dimension of length and width, not just the dimension height.  The Gemara achieves this in few crucial steps.</p>\n<p>First, it utilized the case in Queen Helene’s sukkah of Rebbi Yehuda’s dispute with Rav Huna’s 1:5 shade ratio as the context to define the functional difference between Beis Shammai’s opinion that a sukkah דירת קבע, requiring a table inside the sukkah, and Beis Hillel’s opinion that a sukkah is דירת עראי, which limits the height of a sukkah.  The outcome of which impacts the minimum size of a sukkah.  However, this deductive reasoning of the Gemara is also being used as an effective way to connect Rava and Beis Hillel’s opinion that a sukkah is a דירת עראי.  This occurs because if Rav Huna’s sukkah which is based on a 1:5 shade ratio was accepted, it would invalidate their common understanding of a דירת עראי because it allows a sukkah to be higher than 20 amos when beyond 4x4 amos in length.</p>\n<p>Next, the Gemara continues developing the information by proving that Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel are not arguing in a large or small sukkah over a דרבנן, rather a דאורייתא.   In the process it also serves as means to further define Beis Hillel’s concept of a דירת עראי as one that includes more than just the dimension of height.  Beis Hillel’s concept of עראי also includes to the dimension of length and width.  This is clearly seen on 3a when the Gemara states:</p>\n<p>ותניא אידך רבי אומר כל סוכה שאין בה ארבע אמות על ארבע אמות פסולה וחכ”א אפילו אינה מחזקת אלא ראשו ורובו כשרה ואילו שולחנו לא קתני קשיין אהדדי אלא לאו ש”מ הא ב”ש הא ב”ה</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0Iw0p1CY.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0Iw0p1CY.gif\" alt=\"1\" /></a></p>\n<p>The secondary purpose of the Gemara here is to point out that Beis Hillel is arguing with Rebbe over the minimum length and width of a sukkah.  This is an argument regarding the dimension of length and width, not the dimension of height.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Gemara ties it all together using the Baraisa on 3b regarding the laws of houses when it states that the Rabbanan could also be the author of the Baraisa on 3b because they can build a sukkah at less than Rebbe’s 4×4 amos because they hold that a sukkah is a דירת עראי in accordance with Beis Hillel on 3a (and Rava on 2a).  Therefore, Beis Hillel holds that a sukkah can also acquire the quality of עראי by being built less than 4×4 amos in length and width as opposed to having to be built at 20 amos or less in height.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MLbPA6pB.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MLbPA6pB.gif\" alt=\"2\" /></a></p>\n<p>The proof that this is the correct understanding of the Gemara is that the Gemara on 3b states: עד כאן לא קאמרי רבנן התם אלא לענין סוכה — דדירת עראי היא.  But prior to this point in the Gemara on 3b, where did the Rabbanan ever speak about a sukkah being a דירת עראי, except on 3a where Beis Hillel argues with Beis Shammai over a דאורייתא involving the dimension of height in the case of Queen Helene’s sukkah and where Beis Hillel argues with Rebbe over the dimension of length and width.</p>\n<p>After the Gemara establishes that Rava’s opinion that a sukkah is a דירת עראי is derived from Beis Hillel and that Beis Hillel’s understanding of a דירת עראי includes the dimension of length and width, not just the dimension of height, the reader can understand how Beis Hillel (and Rava) can avoid refutation by Rebbi Yehuda’s Baraisa regarding Queen Helene’s sukkah that was over 20 amos high while the Elders were silent.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vTS3ztko.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vTS3ztko.jpg\" alt=\"3\" /></a></p>\n<p>Therefore, according to context of the Gemara the Rabbanan who maintain that a sukkah is a דירת עראי in accordance Beis Hillel, they held that Queen Helene was sitting inside a small sukkah of less than 4×4 amos which was higher than 20 amos in height and her sons were sitting with her.  Therefore, the Elders did not say a word to her.  And according to them, Rebbi Yehuda maintained that her sons were sitting in the large sukkah which was 4×4 amos or greater while above 20 amos in height. Thus, the Gemara conceptualized Rebbi Yehuda’s argument with the Rabbanan as in a sukkah that was entirely over 20 amos.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>[EDITED]</strong> I'm not sure your premise is correct that we hold a sukkah must be temporary. I have heard many people say that a sukkah needs to be temporary, and I agree that seems to be Rava's opinion, but I don't think that precisely fits the conclusion of the gemara and the poskim. (I'm unsure whether this means we reject Rava or not, as I will explain). You can build a sukkah out of stone and mortar or reinforced cement. Orach Chaim 630:1. And at least on a d'oraita level and possibly a d'rabanan level, you can also have a sukkah with very heavy wooden beams for a roof and lock them in place. See Sukkah 14a. According to Beit Hillel you can also leave your sukkah up year-round. Sukkah 9. L'hatchilah one should at least refresh the schach before the chag, though even that isn't strictly required. See Mishnah Berurah 636:4 and Beit Yosef 636:1.</p>\n<p>The phrase \"סוכה דירת עראי <strong>בעינן</strong>\" appears twice in the Gemara. It is Rava's shita on Yoma 10b (consistent with his shita on Sukkah 2a) and is stated as the opinion of Rabbi Akiva on Sukkah 22b-23a. On sukkah 2a there are three explanations for why a sukkah over 20 amot is pasul. Rabbah says you need to be aware you are in a sukkah; Rabbi Zeira says you need to be in the shade of the roof and not of the walls; Rava says because such a sukkah cannot be made temporary. Rashi explains Rava's problem is that a 20 amah sukkah would <em>require</em> foundations. Rava's position seems ambiguous. He could mean (A) a sukkah <em>must</em> be temporary and a sukkah with brick walls is pasul or (B) a sukkah must be <em>capable of</em> being temporary, but a very tall sukkah is pasul because it cannot be temporary. Rava's statement on Yoma 10b that a sukkah never requiers a mezuzah seems to imply he means (A).</p>\n<p>Either way, as OP notes the subsequent gemara does not fit with Rava's shita. As Sukkah 2b explains, according to Rabbah you can solve the problem by having walls go all the way up. According to Rebbi Zeira, you can solve the problem by making the sukkah large. But according to Rava, there appears to be no way to make a kosher 20 amot sukkah. The Gemara then brings the baraita you mention regarding Queen Heleni. And the Gemara explains this according to Rabbah or Rebbei Zeira, which seems to imply it's a rejection of Rava. (I have not found any mefarshim addressing this issue).</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, the Gemara certainly concludes that a sukkah does not <em>need</em> to be keva. (See Sukkah daf 7). But the Gemara (other than Rava) does not say that a sukkah can be pasul for being too permanent. (There does seem to be an assumption that you must be in a sukkah and not a \"house,\" see Sukkah 14a right below the mishnah and Rashi there, but it's not clear if there is an objective distinction between a house with a wooden roof and a kosher sukkah). The only exception is on Sukkah 23a when the Gemara explains the machloket between Rabban Gamliel and Rabbi Akiva whether a sukkah on a ship needs to be able to stand up to a sea wind. <em>L'fi aniyut daati</em> the gemara does not mean Rabbi Akiva requires davka a temporary sukkah; rather, he means we <em>only</em> require it be able to stand temporarily and we do not require it be able to stand permanently.</p>\n<p>The big <em>tzarikh iyun</em> on all this is that it seems even a permanent sukkah doesn't require a mechitzah. See MB 626:21; but see Sharei Teshuvah 626:7 citing some opinions that could imply the opposite. Perhaps there is just a general klal that since the sukkah's primary function is temporary and/or most sukkot are in fact physically temporary they do not need a mezuzah.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The תוספות רי\"ד and ריטבא ask a similar question by רבא who holds like the רבנן that you need דירת עראי.

Because the Elders entered only the main sukkah, they had no reason to object.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, R.

We do find different sources about the Midah of going above and beyond the limit even taking ones own resources in order to provide for a fellow Jew.</p>\n<p>The Tur quotes Rav Nissim Gaon <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Yoreh_Deah.251.1?lang=he&with=Shulchan%20Arukh,%20Yoreh%20De%27ah&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Yoreh_Deah.251.1?lang=he&with=Shulchan%20Arukh,%20Yoreh%20De%27ah&lang2=he</a> the following: כתב ה\"ר סעדיה חייב אדם להקדים פרנסתו לכל אדם ואינו חייב לתת צדקה עד שיהיה לו פרנסתו שנאמר וחי אחיך עמך חייך קודמין לחיי אחיך וכן אמרה הצרפית לאליהו ועשיתי לי ולבני תחילה לי ואח\"כ לבני והודה לה אליהו ואמר לה לך ולבנך תעשה באחרונה: ואחר שיפרנס נפשו\nThis means one must first provide for himself before providing for others. The Bedek Habayis disagrees with this but just writes he disagrees. The Halacha (I do not have the source to hand) one must not spend more then a 1/6th of his money on Mitzvos is also suggestive that one should not go overboard with doing Mitzvos, rather one needs to provide for himself. Yet this needs to be done with thought and not in a selfish way, as the Tur writes מצות עשה ליתן צדקה כפי השגת ידו  מאד מאד צריך אדם ליזהר בה יותר מכל מצות עשה one should spend as much as he can on tzedoka and be more scrupulous then other Mitzvos.</p>\n<p>The Stepleir Gaon in ברכת פרץ on פרשת בשלח is discusses at length how one needs to keep in mind his own good. If one does good for others and ends up regretting it he gets a sin. There are other sources as well for this idea. Yet it is a Jewish concept that charity starts at home. One needs to be sure that his family is provded for and that comes under the umbrellea of Tzedoka.</p>\n<p>Stories that we hear of those who went above and beyond for others, here are some questions we don’t hear the answer to…</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Did they provide for their families in a full way? Did their family agree or was there restenment?</li>\n<li>Did their familes suffer from the descion made?</li>\n<li>Did they come to regret what they did?</li>\n<li>Was it a one time story or did this happen on a constant basis?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how can we make sense of these stories and apply them to our lives? Here are some possible ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Maybe these stories are meant to inspire us to do more than we think we can, but not necessarily to the same extent as the heroes of the stories.</li>\n<li>Maybe these stories are meant to show us the ideal level of generosity and kindness, but not necessarily the practical level for everyone.</li>\n<li>Maybe these stories are meant to challenge us to examine our own priorities and values, and see if we can align them more with the Torah's perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whatever the case may be, I think we can all agree that helping others is a very important Mitzvah, but it also requires balance and wisdom. We should not neglect our own needs or those of our families, but we should also not be stingy or selfish.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I've also had trouble understanding this point all my life. There are many answers offered and the one that made sense to me is the one offered by <em>chassidut</em>, and therefore I'd like to bring it now. I hope to see other answers as well.</p>\n<p>The concept of humility seems almost impossible to embrace, yet we are told that \"For it is exceedingly near to you, in your mouth and in your heart, to do\" (Devarim 30:14), which the Alter Rebbe in Tanya explains means that it is supposed to be easy and natural for a Jew to be able to keep all mitzvot and Torah precepts, including being humble. If we are finding it hard, we have either misunderstood ourselves or misunderstood what humility means.</p>\n<p>I once heard in a shiur that one is <strong>not</strong> supposed to compromise in marriage, despite common wisdom. Then he proceeded to give a story about a couple who, for many decades, whenever they would fly on a plane, the husband would sit by the window and wife by the aisle. At some point, they realised that each spouse thought the other preferred that seat, so they were offering it to them, but the truth is that it was the other way around! One figured that he likes the aisle, but he will gladly give it to her and sit by the window. She figured that the window was best so she gladly gave it to her husband. This is not about compromise at all, neither were compromising, in fact, they never realised because they were actually both getting what they <em>really</em> wanted - making their spouse happy.</p>\n<p>This is the essence of <em>bittul</em>, or humility. There is a famous pasuk in Shir HaShirim - I am for my beloved and my beloved is for me. This is a <em>chassidic</em> answer, which means it's all about relationships - relationships are the most Godly aspect of creation, so how does God want us to structure our relationships?</p>\n<p>What He wants from us is 2 things. 1 is that we should have our own self identity, which really boils down to having a personality and things that we want and like, that makes us unique (Ratzon is the highest sefira, and therefore the most fundamental). Then, He wants us to become people whose greatest pleasure and enjoyment in life is serving others. He doesn't want us to have no other wants, and there is a reason for that, which we will get to in a moment, but He does want our greatest, highest goal and ambition in life to be \"for our beloveds\", not for ourselves.</p>\n<p>A quick detour to discussing the tree of knowledge of good and evil. This has been explained in many ways and the chassidic explanation is like this. It is a tree of da'at (which is the spiritual ability to internalise knowledge, and leads to self identity and self consciousness), and it is both good and bad. Why is it good? It is good because it means that we can actually be separate individuals and therefore it enables genuinely Godly relationships. It is bad because it can make us into selfish individuals who only are \"for myself\".</p>\n<p>So back to the couple we discussed above. If either of them were <em>completely</em> selfless, then there wouldn't been any room for a relationship. The husband, desperate to give something to his wife that she wants, would find she wants nothing and therefore not be able to find anyone there to love and be for, and visa versa. However, because they are both individuals, they both do have something with which to serve each other and be served by. When the husband thought his wife would prefer the aisle, he got to do something very Godly, and let her have it. He got to do so at his own expense, which was great, he absolutely lives for her and there is no greater pleasure in the world than making her happy and giving her what she wants - serving her. The fact that he had to not get what he wanted was not a compromise, in fact it enhanced his service for her, he got to do something particularly grand on her behalf, at his own expense. When he found out that she actually preferred the window seat, you understand the mixed feelings - all very Godly - where he felt sad that he hadn't actually been serving her, but happy that he found out what makes her happy and can actually give that to her, but also a little sad that he now is going to be giving less altruistically to her because now it's going to be easy, as he will actually be getting what he wants.</p>\n<p>That's ultimately what this world is all about and why Hashem started this whole mess. The highest spiritual plane is the plane of Atzilut, which is the world of \"there's nothing but you\". Our souls are all rooted there. However, when it truly is that we are all over the moon to serve others and never think about ourselves, there are a few questions that can be asked that taint it. Firstly, what is there to serve others, when everyone is selfless? Secondly, what is the greatness of serving others if it is so natural and Godly to a soul, and there's no resistance or challenge in it?</p>\n<p>So we are sent to the lowest world, the world of Asiya, a world where we are predominantly out for ourselves. We feel our own needs much stronger than the needs of others and our natural instinct is to put them first, no matter the cost. If there's any time and energy left over, then we might consider serving someone else. Hashem invites us, step by step, to rise through the worlds. First the world of Yetzira, where we are able to view the needs of others as just as important as our own. The world of compromising. Then we step up to the world of Beriya, where we actually become more interested in the needs of others than our own needs.</p>\n<p>After we have stepped through all this, then we can enter the world of Atzilut again, where all we see is our beloved, not ourselves. The questions that were asked before we left have all fallen away, <em>and</em> along the way we have become dynamic, wonderful people, who have something for our beloveds' to serve (\"my beloved is for me\" remember!).</p>\n<p>The first step in all this is to realise that it is better to be needed than it is to be needy. This is what will shake us out of our Asiya-dik stupor and realise that there is indeed a great nobility and pleasure in serving others. When we truly start to see the greatness in the fact that we are needed, and allow others to also respond to our need, we are well on our way back to Atzilut, with a strong momentum that lasts and doesn't require constant \"inspiration\" and \"chizuk\" to keep us going. One thing we realise is that there's nothing wrong with taking pleasure in being altruistic either. If my main pleasure in life is \"being for my beloved\", then that's about as Godly as it gets. And if we are worried that you will be challenged, when we get back to Atzilut, that we only did it for the pleasure - don't worry. Much of the time, in this cold, dark world, we don't feel the pleasure or the connection. That's often just a gift from Hashem in the moment, to make us remember what the right path is. We will respond to the needs of others under a lot of heroic challenge in life, leave that up to Hashem.</p>\n<p>At least now we understand what it means to be humble, why it isn't \"across the sea\" or \"in the heavens\" that we should have to go and get it (Devarim 30:12-13). It's doable, easy (yet challenging) and makes sense. Only one who truly grasps this concept will understand what the Rambam you quoted is saying: in order to serve others effectively, one has to first look after one's self. Primarily, so that one has the energy and wherewithal to rise to the immensely important, holy task of serving others, but also because they need to give to you too. If you are nothing, they have nobody to give to, and you will deny Hashem what He created the whole world for - true intimacy and oneness between each other.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Shimon Shkop notes that there are halachic indications that chessed (lovingkindness) is not supposed to be founded on selflessness.</p>\n<p>Quoting selections from his <a href=\"https://www.aishdas.org/ShaareiYosher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to Shaarei Yosher, my translation</a> (from <a href=\"https://amzn.to/40in1QW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Widen Your Tent, Mosaica Press, 2019</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>HOWEVER, what of a person who decides to submerge his nature, to reach a high level so that he has no thought or inclination in his soul for his own good, only a desire for the good of others? In this way he would have his desire reach the sanctity of the Creator, as His Desire in all of the creation and management of the world is only for the good of the created, and not for Himself at all. At first glance one might say that if a person reached this level, he would reach the epitome of being whole. But this is why our Sages of blessed memory teach us in this Midrash that it is not so.  We cannot try to be similar to His Holiness in this respect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For His Holiness is greater than ours. His Holiness is only for the created and not for Himself because nothing was ever added to or could ever be added to the Creator through the actions He did or does. Therefore all His Desire could only be to be good to the created, but what He wants from us is not like this. As Rabbi Aqiva taught us, “your life comes first.”  [Our sages] left us a hint of it when they interpret the scripture “Love your neighbor as yourself” in a negative sense, “That which is hateful to you, do not do to your peers.” In terms of obligation, it is fitting for a person to place his own good first.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Shimon then notes that self-love is so firmly and centrally placed in the human psyche to the extent that it cannot be uprooted. And that this self-love is what drives us to imitate Him and be creative beings. Skipping a bit:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sages of truth  describe the purpose of all the work in this language, “The Infinite wanted to bestow complete good, that there wouldn’t even be the embarrassment of receiving.” This discussion reveals how far the power of loving oneself goes, that “a person is more content with one qav [a unit of measure] of his own making than [he would be of] two qavin that are given to him” – even if from the Hand of the Holy One! – if the present is unearned. From here it should be self-evident that love of oneself is desired by the Holy One, even though “the wise shall walk because of it and the foolish will stumble over it.” In my opinion, this is true despite all the evil and sin that the world is full of because of this middah of self-love. ,,,,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although at first glance it seems that feelings of love for oneself and feelings of love for others are like competing co-wives one to the other [i.e. an unresolvable dialectic], we have the duty to try to delve into it, to find the means to unite them, since Hashem expects both from us. This means [a person must] explain and accept the truth of the quality of his “I”, for with it the statures of [different] people are differentiated, each according to their level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The entire “I” of a coarse and lowly person is restricted only to his substance and body. Above him is someone who feels that his “I” is a synthesis of body and soul. And above him is someone who can include in his “I” all of his household and family. Someone who walks according to the way of the Torah, his “I” includes the whole Jewish people, since in truth every Jewish person is only like a limb of the body of the nation of Israel. And there are more levels in this of a person who is whole, who can connect his soul to feel that all of the world and worlds are his “I”, and he himself is only one small limb in all of creation. <strong>Then, his self-love helps him love</strong> all of the Jewish people and [even] all of creation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my opinion, this idea is hinted at in Hillel’s words, as he used to say, “If I am [not] for me, who will be for me? And when I am for myself, what am I?”  It is fitting for each person to strive to be concerned for himself. But with this, he must also strive to understand that “I for myself, what am I?” If he constricts his “I” to a narrow domain, limited to what the eye can see [is him], then his “I” – what is it? Vanity and ignorable. But if his feelings are broader and include [all of] creation, that he is a great person and also like a small limb in this great body, then he is lofty and of great worth...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Shimon's ethic is not founded on denying the self. He sees such denial as being psychologically unhealthy and decreases our drive to contribute. Rather, we must realize our interconnectedness and investing in others. We develop that realization by giving, investing in other people, until we see ourselves in them, and that love of self grows to include a love of the other.</p>\n<p>It is therefore much like an Ethic of Care -- those we have a relationship with and resposibility for come first. The compass has a center, a corse self. As the laws of charity go, \"the poor of your own city come first\", before other poor. And family comes before them. (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.71a.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 71a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.251.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Arukh, YD 251:3</a>, etc...)</p>\n<p>I would add that selflessness is going to most naturally become a path to sympathy and pity. I am not a priority, your pain is. In contrast, Rav Shimon Shkop's path is founded on empathy. You are there, with them, sharing their need in a single extended \"I\".</p>\n\n\n",

Rava states that the explanation of the 20 amos height limitation of the Mishnah finds its restriction in the fact that a Sukkah must be a דירת עראי. Is a דירת עראי defined by its material construct or an abstract dimension?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rava states that temporariness is not determined by the materials used to construct a sukkah.  Rather, temporariness is determined by an abstract dimensional range.  Any sukkah constructed up to 20 amos in height is a דירת עראי.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JIV08.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/JIV08.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>And, even if a person builds his sukkah out of temporary materials or in a temporary fashion above 20 amos he does not fulfill his obligation because his sukkah would occupy a dimension of קבע, as Rava restates and clarifies this point to Abaye on 2a:  <strong>הכי קאמינא לך</strong> עד כ’ אמה דאדם עושה דירתו דירת עראי כי עביד ליה דירת קבע נמי נפיק למעלה מכ’ אמה דאדם עושה דירתו דירת קבע <strong>כי עביד ליה דירת עראי נמי לא נפיק</strong>.</p>\n<p>The literal meaning of Rava's words are that a person could build a materially weak or poorly fastened “seven-day” sukkah above 20 amos that would prove to only last temporarily (see the Bach §633).  As such, Rava informs us that a sukkah's material makeup or lack of sturdiness in construction does not matter at all.  If a דירת עראי occupies the abstract dimension of קבע above 20 amos, it would actually be a דירת קבע and not as Abaye would have thought, a דירת עראי.  Therefore, a materially weak or loosely constructed sukkah above 20 amos is invalid.  Just as conversely a sukkah made with מחיצות של ברזל is actually a דירת עראי and not a דירת קבע when it occupies the dimensional space of 20 amos or less.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2f7BfpM6.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/2f7BfpM6.jpg\" alt=\"12\" /></a></p>\n<p>And even though Rashi deviates from the simple meaning of Rava's words and understands differently than the Bach in stating that it is impossible to build a דירת עראי above 20 amos due to a connection to its material construct, he still concludes in his commentary on Gemara 2b that Rabbah and Rebbi Zeira did not agree with Rava's source for the 20 amos height limitation of a sukkah because they did not want to learn out from the words שבעת ימים an abstract measurement regarding the concept of temporariness and permanent.  Instead, they felt that if the words שבעת ימים could be interpreted to mean that a sukkah should be built in some sort of temporary fashion, it would have to be understood as Abaye did in the terms of the material construct of the sukkah.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wD8eo.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wD8eo.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Another proof that the definition of a דירת עראי is not determined by the materials used but is an abstract range determined as 20 amos or less can be learned from Gemara 7b where Rebbi Yehuda is listed as one of eight Tannaim that hold that a sukkah is a דירת קבע on the basis that he validates a sukkah above 20 amos in height.  From this we find a proof for Rava’s understanding that a sukkah which is built less than 20 amos in height is in the dimensional range of what is considered a דירת עראי.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3kq8b.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3kq8b.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/crxHh.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/crxHh.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Additionally, this understanding of an abstract measurement verses a material concept of עראי and קבע is further observed in the same Gemara on 7b in referencing Rebbe’s opinion that the קבע of a sukkah is established as one that is 4×4 amos or greater, <strong>regardless of its material construction</strong>.  And conversely, Rebbe maintains that a sukkah that is less than 4×4 amos is a דירת עראי.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/alxGR.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/alxGR.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZfYXN.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ZfYXN.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Furthermore, we find that on the basis of an abstract measurement of 4×4 amos, the Baraisa on 3b regarding the laws of houses determines whether a house is a דירת קבע or a דירת עראי.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HiAf1.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/HiAf1.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In losing a very close friend recently am at a loss how to commemorate according to Judaic law and custom. How is this done?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A very close friend of mine passed away recently and I do not know what Judaism teaches specifically about how to grieve and mourn. I am seeking grief comfort passages in the Torah/Tanach from source aside from reciting mishnayaot, lighting candles and sitting shiva. The grief itself - how to express it in a holy way and if there is a bitachon/emuna process to undergo - what is that process exactly. Thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I am sorry for your loss. One of the wisest things about the Jewish morning process is that it realizes that there is no magic recipe for comfort. Acceptance, and even comfort, take time. We absolutely do believe that everything happens for a reason, that the souls of the departed are in a better place, and in the eventual resurrection of the righteous. But those abstract ideas can often be small comfort to those left behind and can be among the last things a mourner wants to hear. See Ramban in his introduction to Torat HaAdam. Judaism also generally takes an approach that feeling and spirituality often follow action. The practices of lighting candles, learning mishnayot, and sitting shiva are not just pointless rituals; they are part of the process of finding comfort and acceptance. In other words, I think your question assumes a false dichotomy between mourning rituals and the effort to \"express [grief] in a holy way\" or \"a bitachon/emuna process to undergo\" because those are inherently related. Most people who have sat shiva, <em>rachmana l'tzlan</em>, will tell you that at the end of the process they felt \"ready\" to get up and start to move on.</p>\n<p>In a nutshell, the Jewish mourning process begins from a place of accepting profound grief and gradually transitioning to a place of acceptance and honoring the dead. What I'm about to write is a very short summary that may help guide your process. Rabbi Maurice Lamm has a wonderful book called the Jewish Way in Death and Mourning that has information about Jewish practices beliefs, and attitudes around death that elaborates on all this. On the day of dead, the mourner is an <em>onen</em> who is exempt from most mitzvot and focuses solely on the fact of death and funeral arrangements. During shiva, the mourner is mainly \"living\" his or her grief full time with the support of community, family, and friends. Over the next 1-12 months, the mourning practices are still present but less constant and more conscious. In addition, the mourner does things that shift the focus from personal mourning to elevating and honoring the memory of the dead (kaddish, learning torah, lighting candles, yahrtzei observances, etc.).</p>\n<p>Finally, in terms of specific things to read and think about, my experience is that different things work for different people. You may find comfort in reading parts of the Bible that deal with suffering and acceptance/comfort, such as Job, Jeremiah, and Lamentations. You may find comfort in reading passages of hope and/or the redemption/resurrection, such Micah, Isaiah, Zecharia, and Ezekiel. You may find comfort in reading about what Jews believe about the afterlife and resurrection. Some of this is in Rabbi Lamm's book. If you can read Hebrew the second volume of Rabbi Chaim David HaLevi's Aseh L'kha Rav has a long discussion of these issues at the beginning. You can also check out the Shaar HaGemul of the Ramban and Rambam's <a href=\"https://www.mhcny.org/qt/1005.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Introduction to Parshat Helek</a>. You can also find eulogies of many rabbis and other great Jewish figures online, which might help you see your friend's loss in context as part of a chain of Jewish tradition and Jewish values. In short, what comforts you or works for your own emunah is not a one-size-fits all issue, but I think Jewish mourning practices are also a good place to start in that process.</p>\n\n\n",

What does it mean when you read a certain Rabbi said in the name of another Rabbi?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Welcome. In Rabbinic literature (as in many other places) it's important to give sources. Passing off someone else's ideas as your own is unethical. Giving your source also allows the listener to evaluate how much weight or credibility the statement should be given, and can give more stature to the speaker's words. That's why so many quotations are often misattributed to influential figures like Einstein, Gandhi, etc. This was especially important because much of the early literature (such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and many midrashim) were originally orally transmitted, so there was no other place to look these statements up. For all these reasons, Rabbi Elazar says Rabbi Chaninah said whoever reports a saying in the name of the one who said it brings redemption to the world. Megillah 15a based on Esther 2:22.</p>\n<p>So when you see \"Rabbi A said in the name of Rabbi B\" it means that Rabbi A had a tradition that Rabbi B had said something, such as expounding a verse in a certain way. You may see chains that are very long (A said B said C said, etc.), but technically only the name of the first speaker and most recent speaker are needed. See Nazir 52b. So the fact that Rabbi A says something \"in the name of\" Rabbi B doesn't necessarily mean they ever met or their lives overlapped, but the important point is that the speaker is telling you who he understood the source of his statement to be. In fact, I believe that when something is said \"in the name of\" Rabbi X it means that the speaker did <strong>not</strong> hear it directly from Rabbi X, but I can't find a source to confirm that so I could be wrong.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Adding to Avraham's great answer: another epistemic purpose for keeping track of who said what is in the case of difficulties in transmission arising - a time when logic and reasoning are used by the Talmud to repair.

    "content": "# Would marriage and divorce for Gentiles be invalid for being an appropriation of Jewish commandments?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've read somewhere that God gave the law of divorce to the Jews but not to the Gentiles, quoted some rabbinic opinion about it, didn't say which one. Is there anything to that effect in the Talmud? I would imagine that to support such a basis would be that if there is no official marriage for Gentiles according to the Torah, even if countries established their own marriages it would make them unfeasible in the matter of divorce, which was not something given to them as it was with the Jewish people, I don't know if this logic of mine would have any merit since relations between Gentiles can be created and broken at any time according to great Jewish authorities but the question of institution remains, would Gentiles be appropriating a Jewish heritage by instituting marriage and divorce or do the Torah and the sages recognize that these things predate the Torah and in many peoples?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Although the concept of betrothal does not apply to Gentiles the way it applies to Jews, nevertheless, it is still considered a sin to have a relationship with a Gentile woman who was betrothed, although it is not punishable by death - this can be learned from the fact that the Talmud (Bava Basra 16b) lists this act as one of Esau’s sins - even though it took place before the Torah was given, and there was no official law of betrothal</p>\n<p>Regarding the question of it being considered “appropiatian”, Maimonides (laws of kings 10:10) writes that a Gentile may take on any Mitzvah that he wishes (aside from keeping Shabbos, and studying the laws that don’t apply to him)</p>\n\n\n",

However, Devarim 19:15 seems to suggest all convictions require two or three witnesses. Then again, Leviticus 5:1 may allow for \"witnesses\" to include forensics experts, at least if \"knowing\" a matter includes \"knowing\" from examining forensic evidence. I would like some more information on this, especially since the answer affects whether or not Noahides can even serve as criminal prosecutors in many jurisdictions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Leviticus 5:1 it states: “and he is a witness - either he saw, or he knew”</p>\n<p>The Gemara (Shevuos 34a) learns from here, that there is a case where it is possible to rely on a witness who knows without seeing</p>\n<p>An example of this would be, in a case where a man was seen entering a room with only one person inside, and came out injured - and we don’t assume that he injured himself (Ibid 46b)</p>\n<p>When it comes to capital punishment, according to Tosafos (Ibid 34a), only if the man was murdered in a way that he couldn’t have done it himself, can the other person in the room be convicted to death, but there are those (such as the Rambam and the Yad Rama) who disagree even in such a case, and hold that whith regards to capital punishment, the actual murder must be seen</p>\n<p>With regards to Noahide laws, the Minchat Chinuch (Mitzvah 82) writes, that it would seem that the same would apply to Gentiles</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Maimonides (in the second chapter of laws of a murder) writes, that although the court may not sentence a murderer to death, based on circumstantial evidence, nevertheless, they are still obligated to give an appropriate punishment</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the article you referenced I understand that Rabbi Kagnoff was answering your question.</p>\n<p>Jews are bound by two legal systems: the Torah law and the secular law. The Torah law consists of the commandments and regulations given by God and interpreted by the rabbis. The secular law is the law of the country where Jews live. The principle of \"Dina Dmalchoscah\" requires Jews to obey the secular law as long as it does not contradict the Torah law.</p>\n<p>The Torah law also applies to non-Jews, who are expected to follow the seven Noahide laws, one of which is to establish a just legal system. There is a debate among rabbis whether this means a legal system based on Torah values or any legal system that maintains law and order. Most rabbis today seem to favor the latter view.</p>\n<p>John Adams was following the secular law in his profession. He obtained evidence according to the rules of the United States legal system. He did not violate the Torah law or the Noahide law by doing so. In fact, according to most, he fulfilled the Noahide law of establishing a just legal system. However, he felt uneasy about his role and decided to change.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've been wondering about a similar thing for a long time, can a jewish woman be a judge in secular courts since halachically women can't be judges for Noahides?\nI don't see a heter, but I do see frum women who are judges so maybe there is some heter.</p>\n<p>I think he was correct to change jobs. A prosecutor is in a rough spot for many reasons beyond use of circumstantial evidence. Chief among those reasons is that the penalty for violating any of the 7 Noahide laws is death-- if he's not trying to get the death penalty for adulterers/thieves then he's violating the laws of dinim himself. (Whether according to the Rambam and Ramban who debate if dinim requires Torah law or to create a system of just laws.) However, R' Moshe has a famous teshuva to the governor of NY telling him it's okay to remove the death penalty. He does not explain his reasoning, but according to that R' Moshe al pi the Ramban that the mitzva requires a system of just laws then maybe he's okay sticking it out in the DA office.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I don't think he's allowed to prosecute Jews outside beis din.</p>\n<p>The question from his perspective may be if it's better for him to help with improper dinim then leave the whole system to fall apart? I think the attitude he has of not caring about his clients guilt may fly in the face of the mitzvah of dinim but it's not clear to me.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi\nḤiyya said to him: Son of noblemen [bar paḥtei], when Rabbi Yehuda\nHaNasi passed his hands over his face in the study hall in the middle\nof his lesson, he accepted the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven upon\nhimself, as his Shema was comprised of a single verse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The halacha is (according to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Reading_the_Shema.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam in his Mishneh Torah</a>), that the Shema must contain the three paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What does one recite? [There are] three sections, and they are: \"Shema\" (Deuteronomy 6:4-9), \"If ye shall hearken\" (Deuteronomy 11:13-21), and \"And the Lord spoke\" (Numbers 15:37-41). One begins with the section \"Shema\" because it has in it of the unity of God, loving Him, and learning [of Torah], which is the greatest essence on which everything depends. After [the Shema], \"If ye shall hearken\" [is next] as in is the commandment of the rest of the commandments, and after thus is the portion [referring to] the fringes, that also have in it the commandment of remembering all the commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first paragraph of the Shema has an important goal: ol malchut shamayim - acceptance of the yoke of heaven. <a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/ask-the-rabbi/q-a-a-short-shema/2021/05/07/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> by Rabbi Yaakov Klass mentions a story of Rabbi Soloveitchik who explains how Rebbi could say only the first paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Although normally cutting a prayer short invalidates the entire\nrecitation, in the case of Shema, it doesn’t. The purpose of the\nmitzvah is not saying words. It’s kabbalat ol malchut sha’mayim or\nkabbalat ol mitzvot.” Saying the words of Shema is merely the format\nby which these sacred commitments are made.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it’s understandable that one may fulfill the mitzvah by\nreciting only one the first verse as with this verse one accepts the\nyoke of heaven pertaining to the unity of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So per halacha, one should say the \"full-version\" of the Shema.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to some opinions (Berachos 13b), only the first chapter - and according to some only the first verse - is of biblical obligation, and the rest is rabbinical</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Rama writes (Orach Chaim 46:9) that it is good to say at least the first verse and ״ברוך שם…״ - and the Mishnah Berurah brings an opinion that one should say the entire first paragraph - before Shacharis, in case the time of Shema passes</p>\n<p>Also if one is in Shul, while the congregation is reciting Shema, and is not holding with them, he must recite with them at least the first verse (Ibid 65)</p>\n<p>Also, for the recital of Shema before going to sleep, one is obligated to read at least the first paragraph (Ibid 239)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, with regard to eating olives instead of olive oil, the idea is that one is too lazy to make oil out of the olives, and just eats the olives instead. It is a shortcut so to speak.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems that many of these habits have a common theme: they involve laziness and shortcuts. Instead of making the olives into oil, which in the time of the Talmud was the most accepted way of eating them, this individual takes a shortcut and customarily eats the olives plain. Instead of drawing new water for drinking, he uses the water left over from washing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similair with eating something that was already bitten by a cat or mouse. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54a.1?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin</a> says that if the Torah is learned with all your 248 limbs, you will retain it.

It's near the bottom of the first paragraph on the left-hand column.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"דהאמר שמואל (חולין צ\"ד.) אסור לגנוב דעת הבריות ואפילו דעתו של גוי [...] וכ\"ש שאסור לגנוב לגוי דלא תגנוב דומיא דלא תרצח ולא תנאף דהוי בין לישראל בין לגוי.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My translation: \"After all, Shmuel said (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chullin.94a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 94a</a>) that one cannot deceive people, even a non-Jew [...] and all the more so that one cannot steal from a non-Jew, since 'Thou shalt not steal' is similar to 'Thou shalt not murder' and 'Thou shalt not commit adultery' whether a Jew or a non-Jew.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Mechilta:</strong></p>\n<p>Sefaria does in fact have the section you're looking for (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.21.14?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.21.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechilta 21:14</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"\"a man\" — to exclude a minor (who killed); \"a man\" — to include others (i.e., gentiles who killed); \"his neighbor\" — to include (his killing) a minor; \"his neighbor\" — to exclude (his killing) others. Issi b. Akiva says: Before the giving of the Torah, we were exhorted against the spilling of blood (of gentiles). After the giving of the Torah, instead of being more stringent, shall we be more lenient? In truth, they said: He (one who kills a gentile) is exempt from the laws of flesh and blood, but his judgment is relegated to Heaven. (Exodus, Ibid.) \"to kill him with subtlety\": to exclude a deaf-mute, an imbecile, and a minor, who are not \"subtle.\"\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm guessing you misunderstood how the Mechilta works. The Mechilta, as we have it, only starts from Exodus ch. 12. The Mechilta (already within the ancient manuscripts) is divided into sections called 'masechtot' (tractates), and each tractate is divided into subsections. The reference you found was to the fourth subsection of Masechta/Tractate D'Nezikin, not to Exodus ch. 4.

I think he just meant to say: \"Even if the entire world as we know it should cease to exist, God will still be there, because He is above the world.\"</p>\n<p>That said, the Midrash tells us that God kept creating worlds and destroying them because He did not like them.  Then He created ours and it was \"very good\".  (If we don't behave, He may do it again.)</p>\n<p>I used this quote when I addressed end-of-world issues tangentially <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/111659/how-do-references-to-eternity-in-torah-square-with-the-finite-life-of-the-sun/111660#111660\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can make an attempt at answering \"what it means\" with Hashem's help, however I don't know what you mean by \"is there a halachic source\" as what would the halacha be? If you could clarify that, I will try to help with that as well. I think trying to fit this into a practical, rigid/logical way of thinking is going to cause problems as this is a more esoteric concept.</p>\n<p>The concept behind this idea is that Hashem's Essence is not that of a \"creator\", that's very \"out of character\" of Him. The Alter Rebbe writes in Torah Or, Megilat Ester 99B:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that all the worlds are brought into existence by God and\nreceive their vitality and sustenance from Him - this is not the\nessence of what God is. For as we say \"You are who You are before the\nworld was created, and after the world was created\" -\nexactly the same. Also, if God would not create the worlds, all would\nbe the same regarding Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A down to earth way to understand this is that He is Himself, <em>thoroughly and magnificently</em>. E.g. when He loves us, that's Him Himself loving us; the love is expressing His eternal, pure, perfect, unchanged self, completely and utterly - <em>who He is</em>. A mashal for this might be a human father's love for his son. The love doesn't <em>change him</em> at all, in fact, the love is actually the most authentic revelation of the father's truest and deepest self.</p>\n<p>I bring this part first, to ensure we understand the next part correctly and avoid an incorrect understanding. When \"all is gone\" can be understood by looking at a <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/85465/jewish/Maamar-VeYadaata.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">great ma'amer</a> by the Rebbe Rashab called \"VeYadata\". The link provided is an english translation and I encourage it to be read in full.</p>\n<p>I will summarise what is necessary for this question God willing. The idea that \"Hashem is HaElokim\" teaches a profound lesson. In life, we have this concept called a mashal, which is a way of dressing up a deeper idea in a more superficial one, because the latter is easier to understand and allows us an entry point into understanding the deeper idea. Sometimes we have several layers of this: we dress intellectual concepts in words, and we dress words in letters. Note how there bares no resemblance at all between the deeper \"concepts\" and the \"shapes on the page\", yet they accurately <em>carry them</em> and serve as a perfect vessel for them without any loss of original information.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe explains that the whole order of creation, which, like links in a chain, starts with Hashem's Infinite Light, and gradually, through sefirot and worlds, step by step like links in a chain, take the deepest of the infinitely deep, and make mashal after mashal of it until we get the physical world. The key point is that it is an absolutely <em>lossless</em> process, and everything of the original Nimshal makes it down to the lowest step, even if it is way beyond direct recognition.</p>\n<p>So really, there is no difference but we see a difference. This is referred to as \"two de'ot\" by the God of \"De'ot\". The process of gradually undoing this and having the mashal and the Nimshal become one <em>is the כִּכְלוֹת הַכֹּל</em> process. The end result is Hashem, who never changed, but not because we didn't mean anything to Him, but He and us became one perfectly - us becoming included in His Oneness doesn't change <em>Him</em> at all, because what He gave to us all along was Him, Himself, without any loss or change, and we became one with Him there and <em>became included in His life</em> - again, something that doesn't change <em>Him</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Even then, when \"all is gone\" because He and we are One, He will reign supreme!</strong></p>\n<p>This is something worth contemplating silently to oneself than trying to put into words, but for further reading I recommend starting with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Olat_Reiyah%2C_Adon_Olam.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this amazing Olat Reiyah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And after all is said and done, He alone shall reign in awe.

This is not because of an inherent fault, but because their professions are less prestigious, and the people will always treat them lightly.\nA person who has served in one of these professions for even one day, is disqualified for the monarchy.</em></p>\n<p>How much work do you need to do to be considered one who has worked in the profession?

Weighing the deli meat and putting a sticker on the bag?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word for butcher in Hebrew is ״קצב״ which literally means “chopper” - the kind of act that requires lifting an axe/knife and lowering it back down, in order to chop the meat together with the bone (see Rambam, laws of a murderer 6:13)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't think it's as much about a profession associated action serving as a tipping point as much as it is about whether the action under scrutiny is characterized as one performed in a professional capacity.</p>\n<p>The Kesef Mishneh (ad loc.) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונ\"ל דה\"מ כשעשה כן דרך אומנות אבל אם עשה דרך שחוק כדרך הבחורים\nשמספרים זה את זה אין בכך כלום והיינו דקאמר משום דזיל אומנתייהו אלמא\nמתורת אומנות נגעו בה</p>\n<p>It appears to me that this is the case when it is performed in a\nprofessional capacity, however if one does it trivially like the way\nthat youths cut each other's hair, there is nothing to be made of it,\nhere we are concerned with whether one goes about professionally and\nin a professional way does such</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According R.

Eg, if one is in a position to only do one or the other, or improve in one area or the other. Something from Gemara/Rishonim is preferable but notable achronim is also acceptable.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On the one hand, we learn from Avraham Avinu (in Beraishis 18) that “inviting guests is greater than greeting the Shechinah!”(Shabbos 127a)</p>\n<p>With regards to Torah study, in a case where you are needed for a Mitzvah, one is obligated to interrupt his learning (Megillah 3b)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, in general, Mitzvos between man and G-d take precedence, like it says (Bava Metzia 32a) regarding honoring parents, returning a lost item, assisting another man with his load etc.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You can look at the bottom of Bava Metzia 30A that a Kohen who can return a lost object but will become tamei (impure), we do not say that we can override the negative commandment between the Kohen and Hashem (to not become impure) because he can return a lost object (between man and man). Now it does appear there that there is a positive and negative commandment to not become Tamei. Perhaps if it was only a negative commandment he would.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the Meshech Chochma (Vayikra 19:4) says that one could not consider the idea that a mitzvah between man and his fellow could push off one between man and Hashem. Honouring your parents needed to be taught does not take precedence over Hashem because part of honouring your parents includes honouring Hashem, but still it cannot override.</p>\n<p>The Chasam Sofer in Sucah 42A says that one could not consider overriding a mitzvah between man for Hashem, like stealing to do a mitzvah for Hashem. Only a negative against Hashem can be overridden by a positive Mitzvah for Hashem.</p>\n<p>The Shav\"T Shem Aryeh (in siman 64) explains that mitzvot between men contain also an element of man and Hashem since he commanded it, but man and Hashem don't contain an element of mitzvah between men. And so one is more categorically obvious to not push off the other.</p>\n<p>In Summary, we saw with the Meshech Chochma and Chassam Sofer that only mitvahs of Bein Adam L'Makom can push be \"traded\", ie: a positive override a negative. So clearly a positive of one cannot override the negative of the other type.</p>\n<p>What about two positive mitzvot?</p>\n<p>We don't consider one \"more important\" than another. See Pirkei Avos 2:1 \"And be [as] careful with a “light” Mitzvah as with a weighty one, for you don’t know the reward given for [each of the] Mitzvoth\".</p>\n<p>Usually when considering Mitzvahs there are a number of considerations like, the time limit of one mitzvah ending before another, if one occurs more often, or will one be a negative prohibition. There might be a few more, but I have not seen the idea that one should do mitzvah A over mitzvah B because it was one class or another.</p>\n<p>In fact Rashi at the beginning of Parshat Mishpatim says that the monetary rules were given on Har Sinai like everything else, imo equating the mitzvot. Similarly the ten commandments were given together and even said at the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2896/jewish/What-Are-the-Ten-Commandments.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">same time</a>, likely to show the equivalence of their status.</p>\n\n\n",

The explanation is that all the various branches of wisdom which lead to the service of G-d, guarding His commandments, or demonstrating His wisdom and power - this category is permitted to us, and it is our duty to investigate it, as written: \"Behold, the fear of the L-ord is wisdom\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.28.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Iyov 28:28</a>), and \"The fear of the L-ord is the beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy ones (good deeds/traits) is understanding\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.9.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 9:10</a>), which means knowledge of G-d, and also: \"The fear of the L-ord is the beginning of wisdom\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.111.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 111:10</a>), and \"The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken; lo, they have rejected the word of the L-ord; and what wisdom is in them?\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jeremiah.8.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 8:9</a>), and all that is a wisdom outside of this way we mentioned - it is forbidden to study it and investigate after it. Therefore he said: \"do not be overly wise\".

You can also freeze, dry, or juice the berries and keep them through winter. If I ate blueberries in the summer, would I say shechiyanu when I eat imported or frozen berries in December? If I didn't eat berries in the summer, would I say shechiyanu on the winter berries even though they aren't in season? Conversely, would eating those berries in December prevent me from making shechiyanu next summer?</p>\n<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> I originally also asked \"what if a fruit has multiple seasons or grows continuously throughout the year?\" Those issues are addressed by OC 225:6. The Mechaber writes that produce that grows year round does not get a shechiyanu. The Rema adds that if it has two seasons, but doesn't grow continuously, you would say shechiyanu in each season.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I suggest looking at the piskei teshuvos 225:17-18 (including all footnotes) for a full understanding, however this is a summary of what he says:</p>\n<p>In general, a shehecheyanu is only made on seasonal fruit, not on fruit that grow year round (even if one hasn't eaten the fruit for a while). Also, shehecheyanu is made at most every 30 days per fruit (so if something grows in multiple seasons, but is not available all year, a shehecheyanu can be made assuming the seasons are at least 30 days apart).</p>\n<p>If a fruit used to be seasonal, but is now available year round because of advances in technology, a shehecheyanu is not made, even if in the 'off-seasons' they're harder to find and more expensive. However, if during the off-seasons the fruit can only be found in specialty stores and is very expensive, then one would make a shehecheyanu on it the first time he eats it during the 'real' season, assuming he hasn't eaten it for 30 days.</p>\n<p>If there is a seasonal fruit which is stored in freezers or other storage and can be found all year, and there is very little difference (in taste or look) between the fresh and frozen ones, one doesn't make a shehecheyanu (even if he hasn't eaten it in a while). If there is a difference in taste and look, then one makes a shehecheyanu on the fresh fruit, <em>even if he ate the stored version recently</em>.</p>\n<p>A shehecheyanu is only made on 'raw' fruits, not pickled, baked, fried, dried, or made into jam, nor on jarred fruit, even if the fruit is otherwise fresh. The only exception given is compote, since it is only eaten fresh. And even if he ate one of these (besides compote) and then ate a fresh one, he should still make a shehecheyanu.</p>\n<p>If a fruit is seasonal, but is imported from elsewhere, it depends: if it is imported seasonally (for example, it grows in the summer and is imported in the winter), then a shehecheyanu can be made on both seasons, assuming the imported one is fresh (if not, a shehecheyanu is only made on the local, fresh season). If, however, the fruit is imported all year, then it is considered a year-round fruit and a shehecheyanu is not made on it.</p>\n<p>Fruit that grows disconnected from the ground is treated the same as any other fruit, and has the same halachos mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n",

It gives as examples that Jerubaal (Gideon) is like Moses in his generation and Yiftach is like Samuel in his generation. I always thought it was interesting that it presents Yiftach as an example of an inferior leader even though he was chronologically earlier than Samuel--so that's at least one specific example where we see that the leaders of one era were superior to the leaders of another.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Wolfson also writes about this quite a bit. Towards the end of volume 1 of sefer emunat eitekha has a discussion of the calendar as a mashal for Jewish history. He says that as we get farther away from the \"source\" of torah (both in terms of time, knowledge, and--interestingly--geographical proximity to Israel) we get closer to the redemption. And in discussing the last days of Pesach (beginning of volume 3) he talks about how the later generations are more \"ikar\" than prior generations because they rely more on emunah.</p>\n<p>Finally, you also see this concept among mekubalim that over the course of history things become more and more revealed--thus chasidim teach a distilled form of kabbalah to the masses in a way that would have been unthinkable, say, 600 years ago.

He said: Anyone who comes and tells me a new halakha in the name of Rav, I will give these gifts to him. Rava bar Meḥasseya said to him, Rav said as follows: One who gives a gift to his friend needs to inform him, as it stated: “To know that I am God Who sanctifies you.” He gave the gift to Rava bar Meḥasseya. Rava bar Meḥasseya said to Rav Ḥisda: Are the halakhot of Rav so beloved to you? Rav Ḥisda said to him: Yes. Rava bar Meḥasseya said to him, this is what Rav said: Fine wool is precious to those who wear it (Rav Ya’akov Emden), meaning only a person who is used to delicate items can appreciate their quality.

Abaye asks if liver will <em>assur</em> other meat it is cooked with. Rabbeinu Tam understands his question to be \"given that the proper way to <em>kasher</em> meat is by salting, but with a piece that is <em>ribui dam</em>, one shouldn't salt it but use another method, did the Rabbanim worry that by allowing liver <em>in general</em>, people might think you can prepare <em>any</em> meat without salting?\".

For example, in <a href=\"https://codepen.io/lancejpollard-the-decoder/pen/jOeqBvW\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this CodePen demo</a>, I found some code which has each Hebrew \"glyph\" in a vector format in such a way where you can stretch the 4 key letters <code>דהרת</code>.

Should they be a standard width which is the same between every word?</li>\n<li>Do spaces between letters need to be the same everywhere, and smaller than the spaces between words?</li>\n<li>Any key or supremely important rules for stretching the 4 key letters?

That would be really great to be able to do, but I'm afraid the computer/software data behind the texts does not exist, and it would be an undertaking to implement it myself.

The verse states: “And there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8). Rav and Shmuel disagree about the interpretation of this verse. One says that this means he was actually a new king, and one says that this means that his decrees were transformed as if he were a new king. The one who says that he was actually a new king holds that it is because it is written “new.” And the one who says that his decrees were transformed holds that it is because it is not written: “And the previous king of Egypt died and a new king reigned.” This indicates that the same king remained. According to this interpretation, the words: “Who knew not Joseph” (Exodus 1:8), mean that he was like someone who did not know him at all. Although he certainly knew Joseph and his accomplishments, he acted as if he didn’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply that according to the opinion that he was actually a new king, we can interpret \"Who knew not Joseph\" literally - that he actually did not know him. But surely everyone  inside and outside of Miztrayim (and especially the person who became a new king) would have known who Yosef was, since he was second in command of the largest empire in the world and provided food for the whole surrounding region during the years of famine.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/119478/13680\">This answer</a> gives a suggestion by R' Hirsch that the ruler was foreign and therefore didn't know who Yosef was. But this is still hard to understand for the same reason given above. And even  if for some reason he hadn't heard of him before, surely he would have learned who Yosef was upon ascending to the throne of Egypt.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I think it means he didn't personally know Joseph and therefore didn't feel the same level of gratitude to him. The preceding verses first tell us that Joseph and his whole generation died. Then it says a knew king arose and he לֹא-יָדַע אֶת-יוֹסֵף. The verse uses the word \"yada,\" which usually means experiential knowledge. If the verse meant he didn't know Joseph existed at all or didn't recognize what Joseph had done it could have used the shoresh N-K-R or said he had not heard of Joseph or did know know <em>about</em> Joseph, etc. So I think pshat in the verse (and the gemara) is not about whether he intellectually knew the Joseph story but whether he experienced it.</p>\n\n\n",

Some communities add these additional verses before <em>baruch she-amar</em>, but in <em>ashkenaz</em> they add them after; Tur himself thinks it correct to add them after.</p>\n<p>Before Psalm 145 the custom is to add the verse from Psalms 84:5, and after it Psalms 115:18. The custom is to repeat the final verse of Psalm 150, and in <em>sepharad</em> they repeat the final verse of every psalm.</p>\n<p>Between the psalms and <em>yishtabach</em>, some are accustomed to recite Chronicles I 29:10-13, followed by Nehemiah 9:5 (the second half of that verse) until 9:11, and then the Song at the Sea (Exodus 15).</p>\n<p>Shabbat <em>pesukei dezimra</em> is described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.281.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur OC 281</a>. He writes that on <em>shabbat</em> one adds psalms; in <em>ashkenaz</em> they recite the additional psalms after <em>baruch she-amar</em>, but in Toledo they add most of them before. He doesn't specify which psalms are added, apart from mentioning Psalm 92. He notes the custom in <em>ashkenaz</em> to omit Psalm 100 on <em>shabbat</em>, but writes that this is unnecessary. <em>Nishmat</em> is added between the Song at the Sea and <em>yishtabach</em>.</p>\n<p>On the three pilgrimage festivals (<em>pesach</em>, <em>shavuot</em> and <em>sukkot</em>) <em>pesukei dezimra</em> is the same as on <em>shabbat</em>. (Tur OC 488, 494, 644)</p>\n<p>On <em>rosh hashanah</em> it is also the same as on <em>shabbat</em>, although some add relevant psalms such as Psalm 17 and Psalm 81. (Tur OC 584)</p>\n<p>Similarly, on <em>yom kippur</em>, <em>pesukei dezimra</em> is the same as on <em>shabbat</em>, but in <em>sepharad</em> they add many other relevant psalms.

    "content": "# A thought is considered a separate sin?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When someone commits a sin, is the thought of that sin considered a separate transgression? If this person, for instance, eats a forbidden food, is the thought of eating this food considered a second transgression, making this person be punished twice?</p>\n<p>Is that true even if this person is not able, for any reason, to eat this food?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>How do we reconcile these two positions: (1) Bad thoughts are sinful and require atonement; and (2) You can't help your thoughts and must not be punished for them?  In the standard Jewish fashion:  By saying “You are right” and “You are right”! Here is how the Talmud resolves it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[There is no punishment for mere intention to commit evil], for it is said [in the Book of Psalms]:\nIf I saw iniquity in my heart, The Lord would not hear. [Ps. 66:18]\nWhen intention [is followed by action] the Holy One, blessed be He, combines it with the action [and punishes both]. When intention [is not followed by action] the Holy One, blessed be He, does not combine it with the action [and there is therefore no punishment.]  [Kiddushin 40a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here is what is particularly artful in this teaching.  On the one hand, the rabbis could not very well say that bad thoughts are punished, because Judaism is clearly a religion of action, and not one of thought or belief.  But on the other hand, they are reluctant to allow unbridled bad thoughts.  If you go off in a corner and fantasize about doing terrible things to someone you don't like, it is very unhealthy.  So the rabbis steer us away from it by warning us that, if bad thoughts are followed by bad actions, the punishment will be both for the thoughts and the action.  In other words, you will get extra punishment just for the bad thoughts.  But if all you have is the bad thoughts, there is no punishment.  However, there is still a need to repent for having them, because they are unhealthy. So, on Yom Kippur, we repent \"For the sin that we have committed before You by sinful thoughts.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This has been discussed a lot, and there are different opinions. Some hold that thoughts of sin (<em>hirhurei aveira</em>) are not punishable<sup>1</sup>, and some hold they are worse than the actual sin<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>Some hold that <em>hirhurei aveira</em> refers only to sins of idolatry and licentiousness.

For example, the Vilna Gaon explains using the two words of Divine judgement mentioned in Avot 3:1, <em>din</em> and <em>cheshbon</em>, to refer to actual transgressions, and wasted opportunities respectively. Sinful thoughts are worse regarding <em>cheshbon</em><sup>4</sup>.</p>\n<p>For more resolutions, see for example <a href=\"https://etzion.org.il/en/talmud/studies-gemara/midrash-and-aggada/problem-sinful-thoughts-and-how-prevent-them\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this essay</a>, where some explain that <em>worse</em> doesn't mean more punishable, but more difficult to fix. Some explain that the inner life of a Jew is of primary importance and in that sense, it is worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Either way, it is always best to listen to the advice of Chazal and avoid sinful thoughts, which generally would include deriving satisfaction from thinking about doing any aveira.

Rava said: There was none who knew how to slander like Haman, as in his request to the king he included responses to all the reasons Ahasuerus might be reluctant to destroy the Jewish people. He said to Ahasuerus: Let us destroy them. Ahasuerus said to him: I am afraid of their God, lest He do to me as He did to those who stood against them before me. Haman said to him: They have been asleep [yashnu] with respect to the mitzvot, having ceased to observe the mitzvot, and, therefore there is no reason to fear.\nAhasuerus said to him: There are the Sages among them who observe the mitzvot. Haman said to him: They are one people, i.e., they are all the same; nobody observes the mitzvot.\nHaman continued with his next response as expressed in the verse: Perhaps you will say that I am making a bald spot in your kingdom, i.e., you fear that if an entire nation is wiped out there will be a desolate area within the kingdom. There is no need to worry, though, as they are scattered [mefuzarin] among the peoples, and eradicating them will not result in the creation of an unpopulated zone in the area where they had once lived. Furthermore, perhaps you will say that there is benefit from them; but this nation is meforad, like this barren mule [pereida] that cannot bear offspring, and there is no benefit to be gained from them. And perhaps you will say that there is at least a province that is filled with them. Therefore the verse states that they are scattered “in all the provinces of your kingdom” (Esther 3:8), and they do not inhabit one place.\nHaman continued: “And their laws are diverse from those of every people” (Esther 3:8), as they do not eat from our food, nor do they marry from our women, nor do they marry off their women to us. “Nor do they keep the king’s laws” (Esther 3:8). They spend the entire year in idleness, as they are constantly saying: Shehi pehi, an acronym for: It is Shabbat today [Shabbat hayom]; it is Passover today [Pesaḥ hayom]. The verse continues: “Therefore it does not profit the king to tolerate them,” as they eat and drink and scorn the throne. And a proof of this is that even if a fly falls into the cup of one of them, he will throw the fly out and drink the wine it fell into, but if my master the king were to touch the glass of one of them, he would throw it to the ground, and would not drink it, since it is prohibited to drink wine that was touched by a gentile.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are also other places in the Talmud that discuss why certain people hate the Jews or certain arguments against the Jews. In general, however, I think Judaism has tended to be more inward looking. I also wonder whether such works would have been further bait for censorship and Jew-haters. I imagine if a Jew tried to write \"why the Christians hate the Jews\" there's a good chance it would be taken as anti-Christian.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Netziv wrote a work on this topic titled <em>She'eir Yisroel</em>, available <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=59593&st=&pgnum=280\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n",

I have thought of a question on רבי שמעון בר נחמי who holds we learn it out from \"<strong>כ</strong>ימים\":</p>\n<p>The גמרא:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֵיכָא רְמִיזָא? אָמַר רַב שֶׁמֶן בַּר אַבָּא אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן, אָמַר קְרָא: ״לְקַיֵּים אֵת יְמֵי הַפּוּרִים הָאֵלֶּה בִּזְמַנֵּיהֶם״, זְמַנִּים הַרְבֵּה תִּקְּנוּ לָהֶם. הַאי מִיבַּעְיָא לֵיהּ לְגוּפֵיהּ! אִם כֵּן לֵימָא קְרָא ״זְמַן״, מַאי ״זְמַנֵּיהֶם״ — זְמַנִּים טוּבָא. וְאַכַּתִּי מִיבְּעֵי לֵיהּ: זְמַנּוֹ שֶׁל זֶה לֹא כִּזְמַנּוֹ שֶׁל זֶה! אִם כֵּן, לֵימָא קְרָא ״זְמַנָּם״, מַאי ״זְמַנֵּיהֶם״ — שָׁמְעַתְּ מִינַּהּ כּוּלְּהוּ. אֵימָא זְמַנִּים טוּבָא! ״זְמַנֵּיהֶם״ דּוּמְיָא דִּ״זְמַנָּם״: מָה ״זְמַנָּם״ תְּרֵי — אַף ״זְמַנֵּיהֶם״ תְּרֵי. וְאֵימָא תְּרֵיסַר וּתְלֵיסַר? כִּדְאָמַר רַב שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר יִצְחָק: שְׁלֹשָׁה עָשָׂר זְמַן קְהִילָּה לַכֹּל הִיא, וְלָא צְרִיךְ לְרַבּוֹיֵי, הָכָא נָמֵי: שְׁלֹשָׁה עָשָׂר זְמַן קְהִילָּה לַכֹּל הִיא, וְלָא צְרִיךְ לְרַבּוֹיֵי. וְאֵימָא שִׁיתְּסַר וְשִׁיבְסַר! ״וְלֹא יַעֲבוֹר״ כְּתִיב. וְרַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָנִי אָמַר, אָמַר קְרָא: ״כַּיָּמִים אֲשֶׁר נָחוּ בָהֶם הַיְּהוּדִים״. ״יָמִים״, ״כַּיָּמִים״ — לְרַבּוֹת אַחַד עָשָׂר וּשְׁנֵים עָשָׂר. וְאֵימָא תְּרֵיסַר וּתְלֵיסַר! אָמַר רַב שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר יִצְחָק: שְׁלֹשָׁה עָשָׂר זְמַן קְהִילָּה לַכֹּל הִיא, וְלָא צְרִיךְ לְרַבּוֹיֵי. וְאֵימָא שִׁיתְּסַר וְשִׁיבְסַר! ״וְלֹא יַעֲבוֹר״ כְּתִיב. <em><em>רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָנִי מַאי טַעְמָא לָא אָמַר מִ״בִּזְמַנֵּיהֶם״? ״זְמַן״ ״זְמַנָּם״ ״זְמַנֵּיהֶם״ לָא מַשְׁמַע לֵיהּ.</em> וְרַב שֶׁמֶן בַּר אַבָּא מַאי טַעְמָא לָא אָמַר מִ״כַּיָּמִים״? אָמַר לָךְ: הָהוּא לְדוֹרוֹת הוּא דִּכְתִיב.</em>*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Where is the allusion to this in the Bible? The Megilla itself, which was approved by the members of the Great Assembly, mentions only the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar. Rav Shemen bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is alluded to when the verse states: “To confirm these days of Purim in their times” (Esther 9:31). The phrase “in their times” indicates that they enacted many times for them and not only two days. The Gemara objects: This verse is necessary for its own purpose, to teach that the days of Purim must be observed at the proper times. The Gemara responds: If so, let the verse say: To confirm these days of Purim in its time. What is the significance of the term “their times,” in the plural? It indicates that many times were established for the reading of the Megilla. The Gemara objects: But still, the plural term is necessary to indicate that the time of this walled city is not the same as the time of that unwalled town, i.e., Purim is celebrated on different days in different places. The Gemara answers: If so, let the verse say: Their time, indicating that each place celebrates Purim on its respective day. What is the significance of the compound plural “their times”? Learn from this term that although the verse (Esther 9:21) specifies only two days, the Megilla may, at times, be read on all of the days enumerated in the Mishna. The Gemara asks: If so, say that the plural term indicates many times, and the Megilla may be read even earlier than the eleventh of Adar. The Gemara rejects this argument: The compound plural “their times,” should be understood as similar to the simple plural term, their time. Just as the term their time can be understood to refer to two days, indicating that each location reads the Megilla in its respective time on the fourteenth or the fifteenth of Adar, so too, “their times” should be understood as referring to only two additional days when the Megilla may be read. The Gemara asks: Say that these two added days are the twelfth and the thirteenth of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the eleventh as well? The Gemara answers: It is as Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said in a different context: The thirteenth of Adar is a time of assembly for all, as it was on that day that the Jews assembled to fight their enemies, and the main miracle was performed on that day. Consequently, there is no need for a special derivation to include it as a day that is fit for reading the Megilla. Here too, since the thirteenth of Adar is a time of assembly for all, there is no need for a special derivation to include it among the days when the Megilla may be read. The Gemara objects: And say that the two additional days are the sixteenth and the seventeenth of Adar. The Gemara responds: It is written: “And it shall not pass” (Esther 9:27), indicating that the celebration of Purim is not delayed until a later date. Having cited and discussed the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba, the Gemara cites another answer to the question of where the verses allude to the permissibility of reading the Megilla on the days enumerated in the Mishna. And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: These dates are alluded to when the verse states: “As the days on which the Jews rested from their enemies” (Esther 9:22). The term “days” is referring to the two days that are explicitly mentioned in the previous verse, i.e., the fourteenth and the fifteenth. The term “as the days” comes to include two additional days, i.e., the eleventh and twelfth of Adar. The Gemara asks: And say that the two additional days are the twelfth and thirteenth of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the eleventh as well? In answer to this question, Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak said: The thirteenth of Adar is a time of assembly for all, and there is no need for a special derivation to include it as a day fit for reading. The Gemara objects: Say that these additional days are the sixteenth and seventeenth of Adar. This suggestion is rejected: It is written: “And it shall not pass.” Since two derivations were offered for the same matter, the Gemara asks: What is the reason that Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani did not state that the days enumerated in the Mishna are fit for reading the Megilla based upon the term “in their times,” in accordance with the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba? The Gemara answers: He does not learn anything from the distinction between the terms time, their time, and their times. Therefore, the verse indicates only that there are two days when the Megilla may be read. The Gemara asks: And what is the reason that Rav Shemen bar Abba did not state that the days enumerated in the Mishna are fit for reading the Megilla based upon the term “as the days,” in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani? The Gemara answers: He could have said to you: That verse is written as a reference to future generations, and it indicates that just as the Jews rested on these days at that time, they shall rest and celebrate on these days for all generations. § With regard to the Mishna's ruling that the Megilla may be read on the day of assembly,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>רבי שמעון בר נחמי learns out from the word \"כימים\", that we read the מגילה on the 11th and 12th, unlike רב שמן בר אבא, who learns it out from the word \"בזמניהם\".<br />\nרב שמן בר אבא doesn't hold like רב שמעון בר נחמי because he already uses the word \"כימים\" to teach that we should read on 14th and 15th through every generation.\n<strong>But according to רבי שמעון בר נחמי, why doesn't he hold like רב שמן בר אבא?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Welcome. I second @Isaac Moses's comment. That said, I will give an answer a shot:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Gemara itself askes this questions and and answers that Rav Shimon bar Nachmani he does not think there is a significant difference to be learned between zmanam and zmaneihem. Perhaps because he thinks if there are multiple days then \"zmanam\" would be inappropriate because it would imply that multiple days share one zman (compare the first Tosafot on Pesachim 99b that finds similar language problematic).</li>\n<li>This is really the same issue. He doesn't think there are extra letters. (Or perhaps, as @Shalom mentioned in comments above, he doesn't learn from little extra details like this).</li>\n<li>The gemara asks on 2b how do we know walled and unwalled cities read on separate days. The stam answers that it's from the phrase zmaneihem, which teaches there are multiple times. So presumably Rav Shimon bar Nachmani would agree with that.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The way I understand the \"zman - zmanam - zmaneihem\" drash is as follows: if there was just one day, the pasuk would just say zmano. Everyone agrees that the plural language means there are at least two different days. But Rav Shemen bar Ada makes an <em>additional</em> drash that there are two <em>more</em> days because he thinks there is a \"double plural,\" whereas Rav Shimon bar Nachmani thinks zmaneihem is a regular, grammatically correct plural (or doesn't care about that fine distinction).</p>\n<p>Now, as for question 3 it's less clear. I think the simplest answer is that there are lots of other cues that Purim was accepted in perpetuity. For example, the passage where we find \"zmaneihem\" reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>29 So Queen Esther, daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote with full authority to confirm this second letter concerning Purim. 30 And Mordecai sent letters to all the Jews in the 127 provinces of Xerxes’ kingdom—words of goodwill and assurance— 31 to establish these days of Purim at their designated times, as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had decreed for them, and as they had established for themselves and their descendants in regard to their times of fasting and lamentation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Esther 9:29-31.\nSo he may just feel that \"kayamim\" is not needed to teach Purim for subsequent generations because we learn it elsewhere. If anything, I wonder why Rav Shemen bar Abba thinks we need kayamim to teach Purim for future generations.</p>\n\n\n",

The mitzvah itself thus precludes the use of ‘it’ in relation to human beings. The same is true in relation to Hashem (on the basic level of personhood).</p>\n<p>‘Dark horse’ Franz may be, but hashkafically he’s got this sewn up.</p>\n<p>A snippet from The Star, as a taster:</p>\n<p>‘For man’s act of love is only apparently an act. It is not said to him by G-d to do unto his neighbour what he would like done to himself. This practical form of the commandment of love of the neighbour, serving as a rule of conduct, really only designates the lower negative limit; the commandment forbids crossing over this limit of action, and already for this reason alone, it will be better to express it, even outwardly, in a negative form. For man must love his neighbour as himself. Like himself. Your neighbour is ‘like you’. Man must not deny himself. Precisely here, in this commandment of love of the neighbour, his Self is finally definitively con-firmed in its place. The world is not put before his eyes like a vast mixture, and he is not told, with a finger pointing at all this mixture: ‘This is what you are. This is what you are - so stop demarcating yourself from it, enter into it, disappear in it, keep on until you lose yourself in it.’ No, quite the contrary: out of the infinite chaos of the world, a neighbour, his neighbour, is placed before his soul, and of him, to begin with exclusively of him, he is told: he is like you. ‘Like you’, hence not ‘you’. You remain You and you will remain You. But he will not remain a He for you and hence only a This for Your You; no, he is like you, like your You, a You like you, an I - a soul.’</p>\n<p>(P.257 of Barbara Galli’s English translation of The Star of Redemption.)</p>\n<p>I could go on about Franz and his work, but I don’t want to overload the answer box here. As for Franz’s sources, he talks about his method in his work - which includes a commitment to ‘non-fanatical’ hashkafah (no derogatory meaning intended by him with this term), that attempts to put hashkafah on a different footing from discourses that rely on an ‘auctoritas’ (if you will pardon the expression) other than the existence, the witness, of Israel herself. I’ll say no more for now.

(<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=917&st=&pgnum=80&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe YD 1:47</a>)</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=917&st=&pgnum=83&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">teshuva 49 (ibid.)</a>, Reb Moshe addresses the question of farms.\nAlthough there is governmental inspection of dairy plants, where milk\nis pasteurized and bottled, much of the milk comes from farms, which\nReb Moshe describes as often lacking supervision. If so, how could the\nrule of Annan Sahadei apply to permit milk? Is there not a lapse in\nsupervision, such that the milk was lacking any governmental\nsupervision from the time it was farmed until it arrived at the dairy\nplant?</p>\n<p>Reb Moshe replied to the person who posed this question that Chazal\nwere gozair on milk only at the point of its transfer to a Yisroel\n(“bo l’yad Yisroel”). Therefore, only milk which comes to the Jewish\nconsumer from dairy processors can be prohibited as cholov akum; milk\nwhich is at farms and travels to dairy plants is not yet subject to\nthe gezeirah. Once this milk is at the dairy plants, it is subject to\ngovernmental inspection and becomes the halachic equivalent of cholov\nYisroel, as Annan Sahadei applies at that point and tells us to treat\nthe milk as supervised by Yisroelim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Don’t touch garments in the morning but you can touch tzitzis?",
    "content": "# Don’t touch garments in the morning but you can touch tzitzis?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read in Kitzur Shulchan Aruch in laws about waking up in the morning that before saying netilat yadayim, one should not touch things such as his eyes, ears, or his garments because his hands are tamei as if. But then it says that upon waking up one should first put on his tzizis, then then do netilat yadayim, and then say the bracha for tzizis. So why doesn’t this “getting clothes impure” concept apply to tzizis? I would think the opposite and you really shouldn’t touch it until you wash because it’s a holy garment</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding the premise that the prohibition to touch before netilas yadayim extends to garments, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.4.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MB in 4:2</a> states in the name of the Magen Avraham that although there are those who say that, the Gemara seems to say it’s not a problem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב בסדר היום שלא יגע במלבושיו עד שיטול ובגמרא לא משמע כן [מ\"א]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's written in Seder Hayom that one should not touch their clothing until after they wash their hands, but in the Talmud, it does not seem that way [Magen Avraham].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in the Magen Avraham 8:1 he says that one must first wash and then put on his tzitzis. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Levushei_Serad_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.8.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Levushei Serad 8:1</a> questions this ruling, as it contradicts his earlier ruling that says touching clothing isn’t a problem. If so, why can’t you put on tzitzis before washing? He goes on to explain that the M”A meant to say that the Gemara rules that it’s ok, but there’s still room to be stringent like the later authorities. Therefore, he ruled that one should wash first.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>י\"ל דדין זה של סדר היום חומרת האחרונים הוא וממילא דלדינא דגמרא היו לובשין הציצית קודם נט\"י</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He states further, that the Gemara itself is a proof that they put on tzitzis before washing, because in those days this stringency wasn’t followed. He concludes that the Shulchan Aruch argues with this Magen Avraham and follows the Gemara that rules tzitzis should be put on first before washing, as there is no stringency of not touching clothing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונ\"ל דמה\"ט לא כתב המחבר דברים אלו משום דאזיל לשיטתיה דבסי' מ\"ו הביא דברי הגמרא להלכה מבואר דלא ס\"ל כסדה\"י ממילא יכול ללבוש קודם נט\"י</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kitzur is obviously following the Shulchan Aruch not the Magen Avraham. Your question is based on two opposing views that argue with each other.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, RSZ points out that almost everyone touches their kippa before washing).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch doesn't mention not touching your garments. But it's brought in Shulchan Aruch Harav <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3152639/jewish/Shulchan-Aruch-Chapter-1-Laws-Relating-to-Rising-in-Morning.htm#v7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Zohar rules very stringently that one should neither recite blessings, nor study, <strong>nor touch one’s garments, nor walk four cubits</strong>, while the spirit of impurity still rests on one’s hands before they are washed in the morning</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he does rule similarly regarding tzitzis in the morning in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3269356/jewish/Shulchan-Aruch-Chapter-8-Laws-Relating-to-Tzitzis-and-Enwrapping-Oneself-in-a-Tallis.htm#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:20</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The following is the procedure] if a person desires to put on his tallis katan immediately upon rising [from bed] <strong>so that he not walk four cubits without tzitzis</strong>. [Since] his hands are not yet clean, he may not recite the blessing. He may [therefore] put it on without reciting the blessing, and after cleaning his hands he should handle his tzitzis and recite the blessing, for handling them is equivalent to putting them on at this time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But this halacha presupposes you're not following the Zohar, or else walking around before washing would not be an option in the first place, as pointed out in footnote 49:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This paragraph relates to a person who does not observe the stringency (whose source is the Zohar; see sec. 1:7 above) of not walking a distance of four cubits nor touching one’s clothes before the hands are washed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So if you're following the Zohar, it seems you should first wash near your bed and then put on tzitzis (assuming you don't wear them at night).</p>\n\n\n",

The mishna explains the circumstances\nwhen the Megilla is read on each of these days. Cities [kerakin] that\nhave been surrounded by a wall since the days of Joshua, son of Nun,\nread the Megilla on the fifteenth of Adar, whereas villages and large\ntowns that have not been walled since the days of Joshua, son of Nun,\nread it on the fourteenth. However, the Sages instituted that the\nvillages may advance their reading to the day of assembly, i.e.,\nMonday or Thursday, when the rabbinical courts are in session and the\nTorah is read publicly, and the villagers therefore come to the larger\ntowns. How so? If the fourteenth of Adar occurs on Monday, the\nvillages and large towns read it on that day, and the walled cities\nread it on the next day, the fifteenth. If the fourteenth occurs on\nTuesday or Wednesday, the villages advance their reading to the day of\nassembly, i.e., Monday, the twelfth or thirteenth of Adar; the large\ntowns read it on that day, i.e., the fourteenth of Adar, and the\nwalled cities read it on the next day, the fifteenth. If the\nfourteenth occurs on Thursday, the villages and large towns read it on\nthat day, the fourteenth, and the walled cities read it on the next\nday, the fifteenth. If the fourteenth occurs on Shabbat eve, the\nvillages advance their reading to the day of assembly, i.e., Thursday,\nthe thirteenth of Adar; and the large towns and the walled cities read\nit on that day, i.e., the fourteenth of Adar. Even the walled cities\nread the Megilla on the fourteenth rather than on the fifteenth, as\nthey do not read it on Shabbat. If the fourteenth occurs on Shabbat,\nboth the villages and large towns advance their reading to the day of\nassembly, i.e., Thursday, the twelfth of Adar; and the walled cities\nread it on the day after Purim, the fifteenth. If the fourteenth\noccurs on Sunday, the villages advance their reading to the day of\nassembly, i.e., Thursday, the eleventh of Adar; and the large towns\nread it on that day, i.e., the fourteenth of Adar; and the walled\ncities read it on the next day, the fifteenth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why by שבת does the משנה say \"מקדימין וקורין but by all the other days it just says \"מקדימין\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I suggest the 'וקורין' in \"חל להיות בשבת כפרים ועיירות גדולות מקדימין <strong>וקורין</strong> ליום הכניסה\" is a copyist's/editor's error.</p>\n<p>First, it doesn't fit grammatically: To be understood as saying \"when it falls on a <em>Shabbat</em>, villages and large towns advance and read <strong>on</strong> the day of assembly\", it should have said \"חל להיות בשבת כפרים ועיירות גדולות מקדימין וקורין <strong>ב</strong>יום הכניסה\" (instead of \"<strong>ל</strong>יום הכניסה\"). This is supported by the rest of the text, that says (when using 'קורין') \"קורין <strong>ב</strong>ו <strong>ב</strong>יום\", and precedes '<strong>ל</strong>יום הכניסה' with 'מקדימין' alone:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חָל לִהְיוֹת יוֹם אַרְבָּעָה עָשָׂר בַּשֵּׁנִי, כְּפָרִים וַעֲיָרוֹת גְּדוֹלוֹת <strong>קוֹרִין בּוֹ בַיּוֹם</strong>, וּמֻקָּפוֹת חוֹמָה לְמָחָר. חָל לִהְיוֹת בַּשְּׁלִישִׁי אוֹ בָּרְבִיעִי, כְּפָרִים <strong>מַקְדִּימִין לְיוֹם הַכְּנִיסָה</strong> וַעֲיָרוֹת גְּדוֹלוֹת <strong>קוֹרִין בּוֹ בַיּוֹם</strong>, וּמֻקָּפוֹת חוֹמָה לְמָחָר. חָל לִהְיוֹת בָּחֲמִישִׁי, כְּפָרִים וַעֲיָרוֹת גְּדוֹלוֹת <strong>קוֹרִין בּוֹ בַיּוֹם</strong>, וּמֻקָּפוֹת חוֹמָה לְמָחָר. חָל לִהְיוֹת עֶרֶב שַׁבָּת, כְּפָרִים <strong>מַקְדִּימִין לְיוֹם הַכְּנִיסָה</strong>, וַעֲיָרוֹת גְּדוֹלוֹת וּמֻקָּפוֹת חוֹמָה <strong>קוֹרִין בּוֹ בַיּוֹם</strong>. חָל לִהְיוֹת בְּשַׁבָּת, כְּפָרִים וַעֲיָרוֹת גְּדוֹלוֹת מַקְדִּימִין וְקוֹרִין לְיוֹם הַכְּנִיסָה, וּמֻקָּפוֹת חוֹמָה לְמָחָר. חָל לִהְיוֹת אַחַר הַשַּׁבָּת, כְּפָרִים <strong>מַקְדִּימִין לְיוֹם הַכְּנִיסָה</strong>, וַעֲיָרוֹת גְּדוֹלוֹת <strong>קוֹרִין בּוֹ בַיּוֹם</strong>, וּמֻקָּפוֹת חוֹמָה לְמָחָר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, to have 'וקורין' in \"חל להיות בשבת כפרים ועיירות גדולות מקדימין <em>וקורין</em> ליום הכניסה\", would make it translate as \"when it falls on a <em>Shabbat</em>, villages and large towns advance and read <strong>to</strong> the day of assembly\", which make it sounds awkward in English, as well.</p>\n<p>Beyond that, 'וקורין' doesn't appear in <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h2a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mechon Mamre's edition of the <em>Mishnah</em> of <em>Megillah</em></a> (based on the manuscript attributed to Rambam), nor in <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/ms50/ms50-080r.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Manuscript 50 of David Kaufmann's collection</a> (starting on the 10th line from the top of the right column, in the link). <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37942&pgnum=284\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Mishnayot Zekher Chanokh</em> for <em>Moed</em> II</a>, in it's \"שינויי נוסחאות\", says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מקדימין (וקורין)</strong>. במשדנו\"פ ובכי\"ק ובכל הכ\"י ובמשבי\"ר ליתא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In my translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>[They] advance (and read)</strong>.

The Megilla\nitself, which was approved by the members of the Great Assembly,\nmentions only the fourteenth and fifteenth of Adar. Rav Shemen bar\nAbba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: It is alluded to when the verse\nstates: “To confirm these days of Purim in their times” (Esther 9:31).\nThe phrase “in their times” indicates that they enacted many times for\nthem and not only two days. The Gemara objects: This verse is\nnecessary for its own purpose, to teach that the days of Purim must be\nobserved at the proper times. The Gemara responds: If so, let the\nverse say: To confirm these days of Purim in its time. What is the\nsignificance of the term “their times,” in the plural? It indicates\nthat many times were established for the reading of the Megilla. The\nGemara objects: But still, the plural term is necessary to indicate\nthat the time of this walled city is not the same as the time of that\nunwalled town, i.e., Purim is celebrated on different days in\ndifferent places. The Gemara answers: If so, let the verse say: Their\ntime, indicating that each place celebrates Purim on its respective\nday. What is the significance of the compound plural “their times”?\nLearn from this term that although the verse (Esther 9:21) specifies\nonly two days, the Megilla may, at times, be read on all of the days\nenumerated in the Mishna. The Gemara asks: If so, say that the plural\nterm indicates many times, and the Megilla may be read even earlier\nthan the eleventh of Adar. The Gemara rejects this argument: The\ncompound plural “their times,” should be understood as similar to the\nsimple plural term, their time. Just as the term their time can be\nunderstood to refer to two days, indicating that each location reads\nthe Megilla in its respective time on the fourteenth or the fifteenth\nof Adar, so too, “their times” should be understood as referring to\nonly two additional days when the Megilla may be read. The Gemara\nasks: Say that these two added days are the twelfth and the thirteenth\nof Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on the\neleventh as well? The Gemara answers: It is as Rav Shmuel bar Yitzḥak\nsaid in a different context: The thirteenth of Adar is a time of\nassembly for all, as it was on that day that the Jews assembled to\nfight their enemies, and the main miracle was performed on that day.\nConsequently, there is no need for a special derivation to include it\nas a day that is fit for reading the Megilla. Here too, since the\nthirteenth of Adar is a time of assembly for all, there is no need for\na special derivation to include it among the days when the Megilla may\nbe read. The Gemara objects: And say that the two additional days are\nthe sixteenth and the seventeenth of Adar. The Gemara responds: It is\nwritten: “And it shall not pass” (Esther 9:27), indicating that the\ncelebration of Purim is not delayed until a later date. Having cited\nand discussed the opinion of Rav Shemen bar Abba, the Gemara cites\nanother answer to the question of where the verses allude to the\npermissibility of reading the Megilla on the days enumerated in the\nMishna. And Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said: These dates are alluded to\nwhen the verse states: “As the days on which the Jews rested from\ntheir enemies” (Esther 9:22). The term “days” is referring to the two\ndays that are explicitly mentioned in the previous verse, i.e., the\nfourteenth and the fifteenth. The term “as the days” comes to include\ntwo additional days, i.e., the eleventh and twelfth of Adar. The\nGemara asks: And say that the two additional days are the twelfth and\nthirteenth of Adar. How is it derived that the Megilla may be read on\nthe eleventh as well? In answer to this question, Rav Shmuel bar\nYitzḥak said: The thirteenth of Adar is a time of assembly for all,\nand there is no need for a special derivation to include it as a day\nfit for reading. The Gemara objects: Say that these additional days\nare the sixteenth and seventeenth of Adar. This suggestion is\nrejected: It is written: “And it shall not pass.” Since two\nderivations were offered for the same matter, the Gemara asks: What is\nthe reason that Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani did not state that the days\nenumerated in the Mishna are fit for reading the Megilla based upon\nthe term “in their times,” in accordance with the opinion of Rav\nShemen bar Abba? The Gemara answers: He does not learn anything from\nthe distinction between the terms time, their time, and their times.\nTherefore, the verse indicates only that there are two days when the\nMegilla may be read. The Gemara asks: And what is the reason that Rav\nShemen bar Abba did not state that the days enumerated in the Mishna\nare fit for reading the Megilla based upon the term “as the days,” in\naccordance with the opinion of Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani? The Gemara\nanswers: He could have said to you: That verse is written as a\nreference to future generations, and it indicates that just as the\nJews rested on these days at that time, they shall rest and celebrate\non these days for all generations. § With regard to the Mishna's\nruling that the Megilla may be read on the day of assembly,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>רבי שמעון בר נחמי learns out from the word \"כימים\", that we read the מגילה on י\"א & י\"ב, unlike רב שמן בר אבא, who learns it out from the word \"בזמניהם\". רב שמן בר אבא doesn't hold like רב שמעון בר נחמי because he already uses the word \"כימים\" to teach that we should read on י\"ד & ט\"ו through every generation. But according to רבי שמעון בר נחמי, why doesn't he hold like רב שמן בר אבא?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the Gemara you quoted it asks this very valid question. It says that רב שמן בר אבא says that the  word \"כימים\" is for generations (\"דורות\"). This means according to Rashi, that just like this generation made the 14th and 15th different based off of walled cities, so too following generations should do the same.</p>\n<p>I suppose you might be asking why doesn't רב שמן בר אבא decide to darshan entirely like ר׳׳ש בר נחמני? First of all because he is bothered by the different way of writing זמן זמנם זמניהם. But also at a quick glance it would appear to me that ימים fits well with the verse before it to be reflexive of 14/15 just mentioned, perhaps רב שמן בר אבא understood the word \"כ\" to be \"just as\" (ie: to make the drasha as close as possible), so it works well for generations as it makes 14/15th just as making then, instead of the other opinion that understood just as 14/15th so too 11/12. צ׳׳ע</p>\n\n\n",

He writes that \"yesh omrim\" that if you heard something said in public (i.e., before three people), then it is not lashon hara for you to repeat it because we assume that the rumor will spread anyway. He doesn't talk specifically about talking to the person who already knows (I hope if he addresses it someone else someone will add). However there are several limitations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>You can't have intention to spread it; it just isn't lashon hara if you happen to mention it to someone else in conversation. 2:3.</li>\n<li>The heter only applies to those who heard it directly in public. But if you heard it second hand, the mere fact that it's public doesn't allow you to spread it further, especially since you don't know it's true. 2:4.</li>\n<li>The heter doesn't apply if the original listeners were yirei shamaim, because we can't assume they will spread the rumon. 2:5. Similarly, it doesn't apply if the original speaker told people not to repeat it. 2:7.</li>\n<li>The heter only applies within the same city; you can't spread it to a new city. 2:6.</li>\n<li>You can only say \"I heard X,\" you cannot add to it or endorse it. 2:9.</li>\n<li>While it may not be asur to say it, you should still worry that the person you tell will be over in isurim, for example if you think he will believe it and spread it more or amplify it. 2:10.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I think what comes out of this is not that we say once something is public all bets are off. Rather, we say that if you know firsthand that something was said in public, maybe you don't need to be quite so careful about spreading it further by accident. So applying this to your example, the fact that the listener already knows also shouldn't create a blanket heter for Reuven and Shimon to sit around trashing Levi, especially if it might cause them to add to it.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I would add two points from my own svara l'fi aniyut daati. First, the Chafetz Chaim writes in 2:1 that the more people hear it the bigger than sin. So even if you might be off the hook for spreading the story more, I would worry that you are compounding the isur of the original speaker, and why would you want to do that? Second, all of this refers to the specific isur of lashon hara. But there could be other isurim involved. For example if you do in fact contribute to spreading the story or you're just keeping the rumor alive instead of letting it quiet down, you might be causing more pain and embarrassment to the victim.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems  that Judaism may have been adopted to some extent as much as two centuries earlier, but inscriptions to polytheistic deities ceased after this date. It was embraced initially by the upper classes, and possibly a large proportion of the general population over time. Virtually all scholars are in agreement about this except one, who still acknowledges that it definitely makes sense for it to be this way though and even he acknowledges that by the time of Dhu Nuwas's reign (c. 517 - 527 CE) there is basically zero disagreement among the scholars that the king was Jewish, there was presence of Jewish tribal influence and other Jewish influence among the elites as well as the population most likely, the ruling elites and nobles were Jewish, etc.</p>\n<p>Taking into account that a Jewish state existed after the exile, how does this impact Jewish beliefs in the sense of, does it deter or delay the arrival of the Messiah? Did they break the Jewish law regarding Jews not being allowed to have a state until the arrival of the Messiah? Does this state existing in the past have any impact on the future of Jews or does it change the laws?</p>\n<p>I'm not sure if I phrased this well, but please let me know if I need to clarify since AFAIK Jews aren't allowed to have a state until the arrival of the Messiah, but a Jewish state has apparently existed long before even the contemporary \"State of Israel\".

The meaning is: We will be drawn toward you whatever the\ncase, though this process might take some time. However, if You draw\nmy soul - which in essence is a part of You - then not only will I be\ndrawn to You, but We (the soul and the body) will run after you, to do\nYour desire and attach to You always. We won't pay attention to the\ngoodies of the world, or material benefits, <strong>or reward for our good\ndeeds. We will run after You alone</strong>, and not after the emptiness of the\ngood things in this world.</p>\n<p>What's the connection between this and the rest of the verse: \"The\nKing has brought me into His chambers?\". Regarding this the Midrash\nasks \"To where are we being drawn?\" The meaning is: Hashem our God,\nsee how fitting it is to <strong>give us good fortune given that we followed\nYou.</strong></p>\n<p>The Satan and evil inclination provide immediate gratification. No man\never stole unless he could benefit from his theft; no one ever robbed\nanother unless it was for his own immediate benefit; no man ever had\nrelations with a married woman unless he enjoyed the sweetness of the\nsin. The Blessed One expects us, however, to follow Him without\n<em>immediate</em> reward, not on the same day, or the same month, year or even\nlater in life! <strong>Today we do it and tomorrow in Gan Eden do we get our\nreward.</strong></p>\n<p>This is the meaning: <strong>we are drawn after You, to Gan Eden</strong>, while we\ndon't get reward in this life, until our soul leaves our body and goes\nto Gan Eden, <strong>You will be faithful to us, O Faithful God.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is, what is the connection between Hashem and Gan Eden here? On first glance, it appears that the Alshich HaKodesh is contradicting himself. First he says our soul only wants Hashem, not any reward. Then he explains this by saying our greatness is that we are happy to do what He says without getting an immediate reward, <em>because we trust we will get a reward in Gan Eden</em>.</p>\n<p>So one might ask, are we actually saying anything particularly nice here? Is our greatness not that we \"<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/6008/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Kislev-18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">aren't in it for the reward, we just want You</a>\" as it initially sounded, or is it just we are trusting and patient?</p>\n<p>One clue might be in what he says: אנו נמשכים אחריך לג\"ע - \"we are drawn after You, to Gan Eden\". One might say that we are indeed after Him, as \"having Him is our reward\" so to speak, and Gan Eden is just the code word for that, or the place where that happens.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Does that sound right? If not, what is your interpretation on what all this means and whether there is a contradiction or not, and how to understand it? I very much look forward to hearing answers from all sorts of directions!</p>\n\n\n",

Which then they would be similar to the \"am sha'bisados\" that are included in the berachah even though they are not even in shul.(If they are required to move and they do not it would come out that it would have been better for them to stay home).\nSee shulchan orach, orach chain 128-24 and MB there</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As a practical answer, in every shul I've been in where the women's section extends past the duchan, the women move to in front of it for Bircas Kohanim.

(Alternatively, he’s saying that no matter what, being behind a Mechitza is never counted as being behind the kohanim since it isn’t showing disrespect.

Though not altogether uncritically, the Rambam relied heavily on Galen in areas of medicine. If you are interested in this topic see Y. Tzvi Langermann's chapter \"Maimonides and Galen\" in Brill's Companion to the Reception of Galen (<a href=\"https://brill.com/display/book/edcoll/9789004394353/BP000027.xml\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">short excerpt</a>). Galen wrote the following expressing his ideas about bread and the degree to which they are leavened (<a href=\"https://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam033/2002031066.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On the Properties of Foodstuffs, p. 41</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The best-concocted breads are those that have been most leavened and\nvery well kneaded, and baked in an oven with moderate heat. Greater\nheat scorches at once when first applied, and produces a pottery-like\nappearance on the outside; and the loaf turns out to be of poor\nquality on two counts, with its inside raw and inadequately baked, and\nits crust overbaked, dry and like pottery. With heat that is less than\nmoderate the bread is not well baked, but the whole loaf is left\nrather raw, the inside most of all. Those that are baked uniformly\nthroughout in moderate heat for a longer time are also very well\nconcocted in the stomach and are most suited to the sequence of\nactivities that occurs following concoction. Clearly, the worst breads\nare those to which none of the above applies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now that I have distinguished the extremes among them in both excellence and badness,\nit is no longer difficult for anyone on his own, without assistance\nfrom me, to grasp that some breads are close either to the best or to\nthe worst extreme, that some are further away; and that others, as I\nsaid, are placed midway between both extremes. It is just as I was\nsaying earlier about honey, namely that one should not say simply that\nit is good or bad for health, but rather that it is good for a\nphlegmatic nature, one that is moister or colder than a well-mixed\nnature, even if it is only colder without much moistness, or moister\nwithout much coldness; and that it is unsuited for warm mixtures, and\neven more so for warm, dry ones. So <strong>among breads</strong> too, while one that\nhas not been very well baked nor has much leaven is suitable for an\nathlete, and one that has been very well baked in the oven and has\nmuch leaven is suitable for an ordinary individual or an old person,\n<strong>one which is absolutely unleavened is not fit for anybody.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Baalei Batim and Daf Yomi versus Learning Halachah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Today, many baalei batim center their learning around gemara bavli, for example through programs like daf yomi. But the Drisha and Shach write that for those who aren't learning all day it's more important to learn halachah l'maasei and not learn gemara. How we we explain the fact that general practice seems to be at odds with this halachah?</p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Tosfos (Kiddushin 30a, DH. Tzricha Lyomi) explains the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=30&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gemara</a> which states that one must divide ones learning into thirds for Mikra, Mishnah and Talmud that we do this by dividing each and every day into threes.\nRabbeinu Tam is then quoted as saying that we rely on what is said in <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=24&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 24a</a>, which says that \"Babylonia means mixed with Bible, mixed with Mishna, and mixed with Talmud, since the Talmud Bavli is a mix of them.\nSo learning just Talmud Bavli fulfills the command to learn Mikra, Mishnah and Talmud because the Bavli is structured around the Mishnah and quotes pesukim from Tanach. This is clearer in what the\nGra (YD 246:4 sk.16) notes that Rabbeinu Tam says in Tosfos in Sanhedrin 24a (DH. Belulah):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבתלמוד שלנו אנו <strong>פוטרין</strong> עצמנו ממה שאמרו חכמים 'לעולם ישלש אדם שנותיו - שליש במקרא, שליש במשנה, שליש בש\"ס</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By studying our Talmud [Bavli], we are exempt from what the sages said [then quotes the Baraita from before]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or as it is put in <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=19b&format=pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos Avodah Zarah 19b DH. Yeshalesh</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>דאנו שעוסקין</strong> בתלמוד בבלי <strong>דיינו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[As a result], we are mainly engaged in Talmud Bavli and this is sufficient</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is brought down as an opinion by the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6223\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tur YD 246</a>, who says \"ובו אנו יוצאין ידי חובותינו\", \"by it [Bavli] we fulfill our duties [of Torah study]\" and the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x6714\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rema in YD 246:4</a>, who says the same \"אדם יוצא ידי חובתו בשביל הכל\". It is also confirmed by Piskei Tosafot (Kiddushin 58) and Ritva <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Kiddushin.30a.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kiddushin 30a, DH. Lo Tzricha Lyomi</a></p>\n<h2>The Halachic Problem</h2>\n<p>However, the Drisha (sk.2), complains that, to paraphrase, There are baalei batim who study the Gemara everyday but not poskim who bring rulings down. It seems to him that this is not a fulfillment of Talmud Torah nor will the man who learns like this be rewarded. We should instead learn seforim of poskim such as the Rif, Mordechai and Rosh etc. because they are the core part of the Torah and their rulings cannot be immediately found in the Talmud with Rashi and Tosfos. A rabbi such as Rabbeinu Tam who studies for nine hours a day with great leisure should study the Talmud Bavli. Someone with less than four hours should not study the Talmud separately. This is same system of division is brought down by the Shach (sk.5) and Baer Hetev (sk.2) as halacha.</p>\n<p>It seems like this limits Rabbeinu Tam's heter just to those with very long periods to study, while it does not apply to the majority of us. The \"we\" in the text of Tosfos and the Tur refers just to Rabbis.</p>\n<p>Outside of the yeshiva, very few people study for nine hours a day, every day; many of us do not even manage the three or four hours as baalei batim. However, Rambam <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&rtype=%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%93%D7%A3&hilchos=3&perek=1&halocha=12\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hil. Talmud Torah 1:12</a> seems to consider this normal. <strong>How can Daf Yomi be advisable for most people if they are not meant to be learning Talmud directly; shouldn't shiurim be about halacha instead?</strong> I wonder how Bavli has come to this position of being the center of many peoples' limud.</p>\n<h2>Some Initial Ideas</h2>\n<p>Two to three hours seems very long for what we would call a review of halachot, so maybe this Drisha refers to in-depth learning of halacha with reference to different Rishonim and Gemaras. Could we just reject the Drisha in favour of Rabbeinu Tam, and argue that the Drisha has a weak interpretation of Rabbeinu Tam? L'maaseh, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14244&st=&pgnum=228\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch HaShulchan 246:14</a> says that we practice and teach like Rabbeinu Tam and the Rema, but those who want to learn Gemara still need knowledge of Tanach and Mishnah.</p>\n<p>Maybe it comes down to two definitions who is not a talmid chacham (and instead referred to as baalei batim): someone who does not have much time (for the Drisha) or someone who does not have much knowledge of Tanach and Mishnayos (for the Rambam, who says to focus on Mishnayos and Tanach until one has mastered them and then focus mostly on Talmud). It might also depend on whether Rabbeinu Tam's statement is a heter (that makes us patur from 'normal' talmud torah) or a minhag that makes us completely yotzei talmud torah.</p>\n<p>Please don't take this post as a criticism of Daf Yomi. I love the practice and keep to it myself.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a Midrash around Rashi's claim of Terah's forefathers being from Canaan?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi's commentary on Tractate Sanhedrin 44b implies that Terah and his forefathers originated from Canaan.\nHe references the mention of 'your Amorite father' - presumably citing Ezek 16:3 - 'Thus says the Lord YHWH to Jerusalem: Your origin and your birth were in the land of the Canaanites; your father was an Amorite, and your mother a Hittite.'</p>\n<p>This seems to dismiss the pretty important point that we trace Terah's lineage to Shem, not Canaan, and we are told that he lived in Ur Kasdim (in modern day Iraq) and Haran (probably Turkey), possibly having been from the latter before he lived in Ur, according to Nachmanides.\nWith that said, we don't hear where the rest of Arphaxad's in-between descendants lived - I suppose members of that line could have travelled to Canaan and settled there for a few generations before moving (back) to the Chaldees.\nOf course, it's not impossible that some of the largely unmentioned wives within that lineage had Canaanite heritage.</p>\n<p>I had always understood the rebuke to be a reference to Jerusalem as a city having its foundation in Canaanite culture, since it was previously a Jebusite city before David's takeover (although why it references Amorites and Hittites rather than Jebusites is another question) and as an accusation that the population in Ezekiel's day are behaving more like descendants of that culture rather than Israelite culture (accounting for there still being some descendants of Canaanites present at the time, albeit assimilated).\nI'm still more persuaded by this concept than by Rashi's comment, but I'm curious if anyone knows of any further rabbinical writings (Midrash etc) giving Abraham's forefathers an earlier connection to the land of Canaan?</p>\n<p>The closest I've found so far is the story in the Book of Jubilees, where we are told that Ham had allocated to Canaan a land west of the Nile (Jubilees 9:1), and all Noah's sons agreed to invoke a curse on anyone who tries to seize land that was not allocated to them (Jubilees 9:14-15). But Canaan violated this agreement and instead chose to squat in the land delineated to Shem and his descendants, and so Canaan brought upon himself the full force of this second curse (Jubilees 10:29-35) in addition to the one inflicted on him by Noah.</p>\n\n\n",

I cannot do justice within this post, please look inside at the or Hachaim.

Adam tells his wife not to touch the tree. This was a Geder he decided was necessary<br />\n•   Nachash gets involved and tells her that Adam was lying and nothing will happen.

Not even a shogeg as you created an ezer knegdo to help me.<br />\n•   Chava says the tree looked to beautiful I could not resist to touch it, which I was told was assur. Adam added an issur which was too difficult so I am innocent.<br />\n•   Hashem gives Adam a chance for teshuva since at he did eat even if he was innocent.

The punishments were for changing the law that caused his wife to sin and not taking responsibility for the cause of changing the law and for not checking if the food was Kosher.<br />\n•   Chava, Since your downfall was that you enjoyed the outside look of the tree and could not resist, during the time of the greatest happiness (childbirth) you will be in pain. And for the sin of just enjoying the look, men will lust after your external body instead of an emotional internal connection which you crave.<br />\nAccording to the Or Hachim, in truth although the tree was eaten from it was not a punishable act, rather they were punished for the details of the way they sinned. As such they were not killed on the day they ate.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Because the curses for Adam and Eve are not actual curses. They are not some new invented punishment by God for Adam and Eve. Rather they are a description of their new reality.

As a result, God explained how childbirth would be for her. And we all know from the future stories in the Bible that childbirth is a very common way for women to die.</p>\n<p>Adam - Adam (and his partner) will now be kicked out of the garden. The garden grew food on its own and required no farming. Adam needed to maintain and protect the garden, that's all. Now that he's kicked out he will have to farm the land, and God describes it to him. Even after the curses are done being read, scripture simply states that God sent Adam out from the garden to till the land.</p>\n<p>Snake - The snake is the only one that is cursed directly. \"Cursed are you...\" as opposed to Eve where the word cursed is not at all used, and Adam is also not cursed, but rather the ground is apparently cursed for his sake. But I take that to mean that he will not be in the holy garden, rather he will be in the regular earth which is cursed and scarce and hard to survive in. The snake is an interesting case because animals only have two commandments: eat vegetarian, and have children. We don't see the snake violating either of those commandments, and yet God is holding the snake accountable because God apparently believes that the serpent \"should have known better,\" and because of that, the serpent is the only one who is actually cursed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gra explains that Hashem told Adam what the tree will do to him.

    "content": "# 2 mitzvot you do while sleeping\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently heard the Vilna Gaon says we do 2 mitzvot while we’re sleeping, does anyone know what they are?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have found numerous sources saying in the name of the Vilna Gaon that the mitzvot of sukkah and living in the land of Israel are done with the whole body. Some of these sources explicitly state or imply that you can do these mitzvot passively, including while you are sleeping. I have not been able to find a primary source for where the Gra said this or where someone reported that he said it. Here are some examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/judaism/jewish-holidays/thoughts-on-sukkot-644040\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jerusalem Post</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Living in Israel is a mitzvah that requires one’s entire being to be\nsurrounded by, and like the sukkah, submerged by the holiness of the\nland. I believe it is the Vilna Gaon who points out one other\ninteresting connection between these two mitzvot. Both of these\nmitzvot needed to be merited in order to observe them. If it is\nraining, one does not fulfill the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah\nand if one is forced into exile from the land, they too cannot fulfill\nthe mitzvah of living in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://ohr.edu/holidays/succos/the_succah/1857\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Somayach</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is said in the name of the Vilna Gaon that there are only two\nopportunities among all the 613 mitzvos to physically \"enter the\nmitzvah.\" One is the opportunity to live in Eretz Yisrael, and the\nother to be in the succah you have constructed for the Festival of\nSuccos. When you cross the border into the land of Israel, or walk\ninto the succah, you have \"entered\" the mitzvah. .... Similarly,\nduring the festival of Succos, a Jew has a chance to make every little\nact he does a holy act by being in the succah. <strong>Eating a celebratory\nmeal or even sleeping in the succah is a mitzvah,</strong> a symbol of the\ntotal fulfillment of G-d's plan for the Jewish people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://eng.beithillel.org.il/dwelling-in-israel-and-dwelling-in-sukkah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit Hillel</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon points out that the mitzvah of dwelling in the succa\nand the mitzvah of Tzion, dwelling in the Land of Israel, have\nsomething very special in common. When you perform these mitzvot, you\nenter into them with your entire being, with your entire spirit and\nwith your entire body – even with your shoes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/sukkot-festival-land-5777/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Mitzion</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon describes a remarkable connection between Sukkot and\nEretz Yisrael. It is these two mitzvot alone in which we immerse\nfully, with our whole physical being. <strong>These two mitzvot are also\nunique in elevating all we do to the level of a mitzvah – for example\neating, sleeping, or walking around in the sukkah,</strong> and hiking in\nEretz Yisrael.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for the point raised in one of the comments that mitzvot tzrikhot kavanah, I think you solve that issue by having proper kavanah when you begin doing the mitzvah. You do not need continuous, explicit kavanah throughout the mitzvah that you are doing a mitzvah. Furthermore, according to some poskim kavanah can be inferred from circumstances, for example if you recite a berachah before doing it, which we do in the sukkah. See Noda B’Yehudah I Y.D. 93 and Chayyei Adam 68:9. See also MB 60:10 discussing these issues.</p>\n\n\n",

But in both cases the dagesh is absent. Why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I suspect that it's something like this: The root begins with a <em>yod</em>, and the word also deserves a <em>yod</em> with <em>chirik</em> (\"yi\") prefix for future tense, masculine. So really, it should be written יִיצֹק. For whatever reason, the second <em>yod</em> isn't printed explicitly, but we act as if it's there, making the initial syllable's vowel a <em>chirik gadol</em>, which allows that syllable to stand on its own without the closure that a <em>dagesh chazak</em> in the next letter would afford.</p>\n<p>One suggested reason for this omission is found in Joüon/Muraoka's grammar, where they write (section 7c): \"Often, as a measure of economy or aesthetics, the mater lectionis is omitted when a ו or י occurs in the same word. Thus גּוֹיִם \"peoples\" is almost always written for גּוֹיִים, ...\"</p>\n<p>Here's another example of the same form: The root ישר appears around Tanach in future/perfect, masculine, sometimes with a second <em>yod</em>, sometimes without, in each case without a <em>dagesh</em> in the <em>shin</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/numbers.23.27\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Num. 23:27</a> יִישַׁר</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/I_Samuel.18.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Sam. 18:20</a> וַיִּשַׁר</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/I_Samuel.18.26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Sam. 18:26</a> וַיִּשַׁר</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/II_Samuel.17.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Sam. 17:4</a> וַיִּישַׁר</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/II_Chronicles.30.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Chron. 30:4</a> וַיִּישַׁר</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further examples: וי(י)צר in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 2:7</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:19</a>; וי(י)רא in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.12.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Sam. 12:18</a> vs <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.18.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">18:12</a>; וי(י)שר in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.18.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Sam. 18:20</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.17.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Sam. 17:4</a>; וי(י)קץ in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.41.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 41:4</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.3.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 3:15</a>; וי(י)בש in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.17.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 17:7</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.102.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 102:5</a>; י(י)רש in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 22:17</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.60\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:60</a>; י(י)טב in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 12:13</a> vs. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.24.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Sam 24:5</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><Sup>Hat-tip to magicker72 for the J/M reference and many examples.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Are there authorities who allow this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>We are allowed to remove kosher tzitzis and not add them to another tallit, which I think is implied by your question, in order to make the tallit more beautiful <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=60386&st=&pgnum=60\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Baer Hetev sk.2, bringing the Levush)</a>. Shaarei Teshuva sk.2 says that this might be for example because the tzitzis are worn out or not as strong fabric as they could be. Mishnah Berurah sk.3 explains that this is because you are then enhancing the mitzvah of tzitzis, and that the prohibition is instead because of dishonoring the tallit; and also cites the Taz (sk.2) who says the same thing.</p>\n<p>Those who add techelet to their tzitzis are doing so because they want to fully obey the mitzvah in the most appropriate way, even though we are allowed to fulfill it without techelet. So, they are trying to honour the tallit and tzitzis as much as possible, and therefore make it beautiful as techelet is beautiful. So, granting that we have the real techelet, it is permissible to remove kosher tzitzis to add ones with techelet.</p>\n<p>EDIT:</p>\n<p>Despite all this, the Piskei Teshuvos advises us to be makpid about avoiding removing tzitzis even if we want to add more beautiful ones. See Mor U'Ktziah of the Ya'avetz on Tur OC 15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאסור להתיר ציציות שלא להניחן בבגד אע\"פ שלא יבטל הבגד ממצות ציצית, כגון שיעשה בו אחרים, <strong>ואפילו טובים מאלה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=9003#p=34&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Hatahor 15:1</a> of the Komarno rebbe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל להניחם עד שיזדמן לו בגד אסור,‏ אפילו שהם ישנים ובלוים,‏ <strong>כל עוד שהם כשרים</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, unless the tzitzis are inappropriate/not kosher for the mitzvah, we should avoid adding more beautiful ones. Depending on whether we are makpid like this or more lenient like the plain reading of the sources further above, the question then resolves around how supporters of techelet view tzitzis without techelet.</p>\n<p>Either we are lenient and then it is allowed at least to beautify the tzitzis. Or we are makpid, and then your situation is only allowed if you think tzitzis without techelet are actually inappropriate/not kosher for the mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

For it is written, (Genesis 12:4) “And Abram was seventy five years old when he left Haran”, and Terah was seventy years old when Abram was born (Genesis 11:26), making Terah 145 years old when Abram left Haran, so that there were then many years of his life left (i. e. he lived many years after that — as a matter of fact, 60 years, as he was 205 years old when he died). Why, then, does Scripture mention the death of Terah before the departure of Abram? In order that this matter (his leaving home during his father’s lifetime) might not become known to all, lest people should say that Abram did not show a son’s respect to his father, for he left him in his old age and went his way. That is why Scripture speaks of him as dead (Genesis Rabbah 39:7). For indeed the wicked even while alive are called dead and the righteous even when dead are called living, as it is said, (2 Samuel 23:20) “And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada the son of a living man” - Rashi on Genesis 11:32</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Terah left Ur Kasdim with his family in the hebrew year 2000.</p>\n<p>Terah was born in the Jewish year 1878.</p>\n<p>And Terah took Abram his son and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees to go to the land of Canaan, <em>in the Jewish year</em>,  and they came as far as Haran and settled there.</p>\n<p>And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years, and Terah died in Haran.</p>\n\n\n",

From this point on if a non jew touches that liquid it will be yayin nesach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The source for this is the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=27&daf=59&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Avodah Zarah from the bottom of 59a to the top of 59b</a>. Rabbi Yeimar says that a Gentile can bring grapes to the winepress even though the grapes are squashed and the juice sprays off, Rabbi Kahana clarifies that he is talking about what is allowed after the fact.</p>\n<p>Tosfos there (sv. Mahu) clarifies what the squashing in the Gemara means. The Ri explains that the Gemara is only referring to when wine/grape juice has actually become separated from the grapes: if the wine just drips, it is not yayin nesech. As a result, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37970&st=&pgnum=159&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Piskei Tosfos 116</a> says \"אין לעובד כוכבים להוליך ענבים לגת <strong>שהתחיל למשוך</strong>\": a gentile worker does not carry grapes to the winepress that started to pour out wine. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37970&st=&pgnum=183&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh (4:8)</a>, says the same; \"לזורקו בגת בעוטה <strong>שהתחיל היין לימשך</strong>\".</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashba_on_Avodah_Zarah.59a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashba</a> concurs because it was never the intention of the gentile to create wine by putting the grapes in a container before they went in the winepress to create wine. I think there seems to be a nafka minah resulting from these Rishonim as to why Gentiles bringing grapes can be allowed: Tosfos because the wine has not separated vs. Rashba because there was no intention to produce wine. Either way, your situation is clearly allowed.</p>\n<p>We then come to the <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x4776\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yosef (YD 125)</a>. He agrees with all that has been said above. The rest of the difficulties in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37970&st=&pgnum=291&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran</a> and Beis Yosef are  about putting the grapes into the winepress, not supplying the grapes like in your situation. (I'm struggling to read this Ran so if I've got it backwards please correct me!). <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5013\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch (YD 125:6)</a> codifies that bringing grapes is only allowed retrospectively, but qualifies like Tosfos that this only refers to \"אף על פי שיש בדרדורים יין שזב מהענבים\", when wine is pouring out from the grapes and has become separated. This is much more wine coming out of the grapes than \"every so often I encounter a grape that is partially crushed\" as in your situation. This is made explicit in the Taz (sk.9, see Baer Hetev sk.8 for a summary), who brings the Rashba's explanation above.</p>\n<p><strong>So, according to all the Rishonim, as long as the intention is to provide grapes that will then be pressed, the grape juice has not become separated from the solid grapes in a large quantity, and the grapes are not put into the vat by the Gentile, these grapes are permitted both retrospectively and from the beginning.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=14840#p=19&fitMode=fitwidth&hlts=&ocr=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Maharal Zunz</a> explains the reasoning of the Rashba and Tosfos. <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=50947#p=139\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Berurah</a> summarises some of what I have said above.</p>\n\n\n",

There are two sages that can be identified by this name, one a tanna and the other an amorah:</p>\n<p><strong>The tanna Rabbi Chelbo of Koreya:</strong></p>\n<p>This sage is mentioned in a few sources by variant names (for example: Rabbi Chelbo, Rabbi Tachlifa bar Koreyah, Chalfa ben Koreya, Abba Chalfi ben Korea, etc). He is differentiated from the later amorah with the similar name by virtue of the sages he interacts with, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabban Gamliel II</a>. Sources where he is mentioned: Beresheet Zuta 24:10 (Hakohen Edition, p. 167 [Heb. pagination]); Sifrei Zuta Devarim 14:29 (Kahanah Edition, p. 208); Midrash Tehillim 20:9 (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14050&st=&pgnum=297\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Buber Edition, p. 176b</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tehillim.20.5?ven=hebrew%7COYW&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:5 in Sefaria</a>), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Maaser_Sheni_(Lieberman).4.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Maaser Sheni 4:4</a> (Liberman Edition, p. 263).</p>\n<p><strong>The amorah Abba Chilfai of Koreya:</strong></p>\n<p>This sage is also mentioned in a few sources by variant names (for example: Abba Chilfai of Koreya, Chilfai bar Koreyah, Abba Chilfai ben Kiroyah, Chilfa ben Kiroyah, etc). Like the tanna, he is differentiated from him by virtue of the sages he interacts with such, as the amoraim Rabbi Yochanan and Rabbi Chiya bar Abba. Sources where he is mentioned: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Maaser_Sheni.4.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Maaser Sheni 4:1</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.123a.21?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Bava Batra 123a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesikta_Rabbati.28.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta Rabbati 28</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereshit_Rabbah.82.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 82:8</a>, and perhaps other sources (these are the ones I found).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Aharon Heiman (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43957&st=&pgnum=34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תולדות תנאים ואמוראים, p. 451</a>) thought that the Rabban Gamliel mentioned in Midrash Tehillim is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamaliel_IV\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabban Gamliel son of Rabbi Yehudah Nesi'a</a>, however, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuel_Safrai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel Safrai</a> (in his essay <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/seferzikaronlevi0000unse/page/n337/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עניינים ארצישראליים</a>, in ספר הזכרון לבנימין דה-פריס, pp. 332-333) showed that there are enough sources that differentiate between these two sages with similar names. To Safrai's points I would like to add that it makes more sense for Rabban Gamliel II (the tanna) to go to Rabbi Chelbo, given: a. Rabban Gamliel was known for his many travels all over Eretz Yisrael and beyond. b. Similarly, Rabban Gamliel also once turned to Rabbi Chaninah ben Dosa, who lived in the Galilee, for him to pray for his son to be healed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.5.5.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Brachot 5:5</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.34b.27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Brachot 34b</a>). So too did Rabban Gamliel here turn to Rabbi Chelbo for prayer assistance. c. We should bear in mind that Rabban Gamliel was also the one who directed Shimon Hapakuli to instate the Amidah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.28b.23?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Brachot 28b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.17b.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Megillah 17b</a>). In other words, tefillah and methods of tefillah was certainly a subject that occupied R\"G's mind. In short, it seems more likely that the Rabbi Chelbo of Midrash Tehillim was the tanna.</p>\n<p>Koreyah (Κορεαί)'s location is under some debate. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshayahu_Press\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshayahu Press</a> in his book ארץ ישראל: אנציקלופדיה גאוגרפית היסטורית, p. 839 thought it was in the Galilee and suggested the Arabic village Qurai as its location. Shmuel Safrai, on the other hand, in his above-mentioned essay, p. 332 thought it was in Samaria and should be identified with the town of Koreous mentioned in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madaba_Map\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Madaba Map</a>, likely Tell el-Mazar. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%96%D7%A0%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben-Zion Rosenfeld</a> in his essay \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23508858\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מקומות מושבם של החכמים בגליל, 400-70: פריפריה מול מרכז</a>\", p. 74 suggested a third possibility, <a href=\"https://kinneret-excavations.org/tel-kinrot/horvat-kur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khurbat Kur</a> in the Galilee.</p>\n<p>In the case of Beresheet Rabbah 19:3, there isn't enough information in the context of the source to know which of these two is the sage in this case. I also checked variant manuscripts in the Theodor-Albeck Edition, pp. 171-172. It should be noted that a Rabbi Chalfai is mentioned a few paragraphs later (ibid. p. 176), and the sage after him is Rabbi Abba bar Kahanah. However, it is not clear that they were conversing with one another, and there's also the possibility that this was a third sage altogether (the hometown Koreyah is not mentioned).<sup>1</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aharon Mirsky</a>, Midrash Tannaim Le'Beresheet, pp. 55-56 thought that Abba Chalfon/Chilfai bar Koreyah in this passage is the tanna. However, from his discussion it seems evident that he wasn't aware that there were sources that demonstrate there were two sages with similar names, another having been an amorah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When Moshaich comes, what will happen to halachot that are not d'oraita or rabbinic insight into Hashem's absolute Ratzon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At some point after the Moshaich comes, we will famously no longer have a Yeitzer Hara (e.g. Sukkah 52a).</p>\n<p>At that time, will we still need the fences Chazal put around the Torah? I don't just mean the official סייגים, but any rules and regulations the Chachamim (even contemporary responsa) enacted for the sake of protecting ourselves from our Yeitzer Hara.</p>\n<p>E.g. following the discussion in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/133909/intimacy-%D7%A2%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%A0%D6%B8%D7%94-and-narcotics\">this question</a>, it's becoming apparent that drugs are probably only forbidden by contemporary responsa because they are conducive to letting our Yeiter Hara take over, and are not banned d'oraita (don't view this as conclusive, it is still being discussed there). Same with being overly drunk. I just wonder what things will look like in a world where we have no Yeitzer Hara.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I ask because sometimes I feel like there is a bit of a downside to have fences. They, quite literally, \"get in the way\"*. Of course I understand and respect the divrei Torah that explain that the fences themselves are clever and holy insights into Hashem's ratzon, so I'm sure it will be a complicated scenario, but perhaps we can say that some fences around the Torah are just fences, nothing more, and without a Yeitzer Hara wouldn't be needed. So I am contemplating what the halachic scene will be when we have a much closer interface with Hashem's direct ratzon. So I don't seek answers that follow opinions or speak only of future situations when we do have a Yeitzer Hara, I'm strictly focused on the day when there isn't one.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* I.e. in the context of Yediyat Hashem, it's harder to get to know Hashem, which we do by learning what He wants, when we have some confusion about what He wants absolutely, and things He only wants in the context of a Yeitzer Hara. I'd wager the vast majority of people have no idea what laws are actually d'oraita and which are rabbinic enactments in the contexts of Yeiter Hara. I think this question has quite far implications, and touches on a lot of hot issues in halacha. Lots of arguments erupt as a result of this, e.g. when certain isolated Jewish communities in Africa who still practice Yibbum/Halitza are expected to give it up and take on Rabbinic decrees that happened to other communities at other times. As someone who loves Yediyat Hashem, I am very interested in questions like this.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hil.

If you or your partner want to ask about a specific set up, check your local orthodox rabbi.

    "content": "# Is the pursuit of chokhmah something that can only be done for one’s own sake (and not Heaven’s)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom.</p>\n<p>A simple question: In Mishlei (9:12) it is written that one who has become wise has become wise for their own sake or for their own good. Does this imply that one cannot be wise for the sake of Heaven? Must the pursuit of chokhmah always be selfish?</p>\n<p>Many thanks for your time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The most pashut meaning of all is simply, it's in your hands to become wise or a scoffer. If you are wise, that's on you. If you are a scoffer, that's on you. However, there are of course deeper meanings. There are so many wonderful commentaries on this pasuk, I hope to see other answers, as I can't cover them all! Ibn Ezra on that pasuk states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כטעם אם תצדק מה תתן לו</p>\n<p>\"along the lines of <em>if you are righteous, what do you give Him?</em>\n(based on Job 35:7)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This line means that no matter how hard we try, our righteousness pales in comparison to Hashem's Righteousness. We will never \"impress\" Him by becoming righteous, and the whole purpose of this is to avoid arrogance.</p>\n<p>Pursuing righteousness can go to one's head, \"I am as right as can be, <em>I am righteous</em>!\" However, someone truly righteous can never be so arrogant - arrogance is a prime concern in Torah. So Hashem helps us and reminds us how lowly we are.</p>\n<p>Nowadays though, we might have taken this idea too far, and said \"nothing about us at all will ever impress or move Hashem, He doesn't care\" <em>chas veshalom</em>. So we must remember what <em>isn't</em> being said.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's true, Hashem doesn't need us to be righteous, but nobody said that He doesn't need <em>us</em>. On the contrary, that's why we become righteous - that's a means to an end; thats <em>how</em> we can give Him ourselves.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תזכרו ועשיתם את־כל־מצותי והייתם קדשים לאלקיכם</p>\n<p>You will remember and do all My Mitzvot <em>and you will be\nholy <strong>for [Me]</strong></em> (Bamidbar 15:40)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>He's not after the righteousness, He's after us.</em></p>\n<p>So what is Ibn Ezra possibly saying about this pasuk? It seems he is saying that this means that no matter how much of a chacham you become, your chochma is never going to impress Hashem, who invented chochma and knows everything. Don't be arrogant, or think that you are becoming wise to offer <em>your wisdom</em> to Hashem. Hashem created wisdom so that you should acquire it and learn about Him, and thus be able to give <em>yourself</em> to Him, which will also be <em>on you</em> - you did it. You get the credit for it.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, as the rest of the pasuk says, if one scoffs, that's akin to thirst (Ibn Ezra 3 on the same pasuk). When one is thirsty, only they feel that feeling, and when they drink, they drink only for themselves. There's absolutely no connection between scoffing and getting closer to Hashem, so they will be alone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>An interesting insight on the matter is from Bartenura on Ben Zoma in Avot 4:1 (\"Who is wise?  He who learns from every man.\")</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Every man\" -- even one lesser than he. As since he is not concerned about his honor and learns from the lesser ones, then his wisdom is for the sake of Heaven and not to boast and revel in.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

How are they allowed this?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, but since the destruction of the Second Temple, (G-d, blessed be He, forbid), the roles such as that of a Priest/High Priest and the like, were removed and similar practiced stopped. Rabbinical authorities, who have already been on the rise prior to this, took over from there to continue the truthful practices in an appropriate manner.</p>\n<p>If this is correct, then why do Ethiopian Jews still have roles such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nabiyy (Prophet)</li>\n<li>Monkosa (Monk)</li>\n<li>Kahen or Kes (Priest/spiritual leader similar to Kohen and analogous to Rabbi or Hakham)</li>\n<li>Liqa Kahnet (High Priest)</li>\n<li>Debtera (itinerant holy man)</li>\n<li>Shmagle (elder)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've never seen some of these like a Monk/Solitary man, and have read that Rabbis generally discouraged such activity of getting away from the community and being solitary, but apparently Beta Israel doesn't follow the Talmud or the Oral Law.</p>\n<p>By continuing to have, for instance, a High Priest, are Ethiopian Jews breaking any laws since Jews shouldn't have a High Priest if they don't have the Temple, etc.? Why do they still have such roles, and are so different from all the other Jewish communities even in the books they regard as authoritative?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Many of these roles are not practiced in the way you assume. A priest in the Ethiopian tradition is a role closer to a Rabbi than to a Priest in the times of the Temple. The Ethiopian Jewish tradition as it exists now seems to have developed separate from having a codified Talmud from Babylon or Israel.</p>\n<p>We know the Ethiopian Jewish community has existed for a long time as they come in and out of history, and during the times of the Radbaz they were well known and he accepted them as Jewish. But we lack historical documentation about their development and beliefs. It's a similar situation to the Sadducees. We know they existed, we know they were a dedicated group that was separate from other groups. But we truly only know what everyone else said about them as we lack any first hand knowledge or documentation from them.</p>\n\n\n",

Purim on the 14th Adar never falls out on Shabbos nowadays, but Shushan Purim in Jerusalem on the 15th can sometimes so the same issue occurs. <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/46624\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> explains the differences in detail. I will summarise.

Since it is inappropriate to make such a meal on Shabbat, we postpone it until after Shabbat. It is best to eat more meat and drink more wine than usual even on Shabbat, because some authorities maintain that the seuda is supposed to be eaten on Shabbat. If possible, it is also good to send mishloach manot privately on Shabbat, on condition that there is an eruv in one’s location</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3066\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 688:6</a>: most hold like the Shulchan Aruch that the seuda is postponed to Sunday, so the mishloach manot is as well. Taz (sk.8) and Baer Hetev (sk.7) bring <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=53913#p=114\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbach (32)</a> who disagrees and holds both on Shabbos. <strong>The reason why he says this is because</strong>, although the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.1.4.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi (Megillah 1:4)</a> suggests that the seuda should be postponed, <strong>the mitzvah is so important and clearly on the 15th of Adar that it cannot be moved</strong>. Even then, he says \"והנני מודה שטעות גדולה היא אלי לחלוק על זה מכת השכל כיון שבירושלמי נאמר\", he understands that it is very controversial for him to disagree with the Yerushalmi, but he feels compelled. He also argues that his view is hinted at in the Rambam, who says nothing about moving the seuda to Sunday. He also suggests that there are other ways to interpret the Yerushalmi, although the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ran_on_Megillah.3a.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran 3a</a> is clear about it meaning that the seuda should be on Sunday.</p>\n<p>Magen Avraham (sk.10) overrules this opinion. <strong>L'maaseh most authorities do mishloach manos only on Sunday</strong> and disagree with the Maharalbach. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.688.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah (688:18)</a> holds like this (citing <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_HaRadbaz_Volume_1.508\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radbaz 1:508</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Korban_Netanel_on_Megillah.7.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Korban Netanel Megillah 1:7:4)</a>, and so does the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.688.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan (688:17)</a>.

However of the different manuscripts of Berakhoth 60b and commentaries thereon that have existed over the centuries, different versions of this prayer have been presented. The printing of the text and its widespread adoption led to the many variants falling to the wayside and often forgotten about (see the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38512&st=&pgnum=425\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Diqduqe Sofrim, vol. 1, p. 345</a>). R. Drew Kaplan describes the varied nature of the nusah of ha-mapil as found in manuscript as follows (<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/37230536/Birkat_Ha_Mapil_The_Rabbinic_Pre_Sleep_Blessing\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Birkat Ha-Mapil: The Rabbinic Pre-Sleep Blessing, p. 160</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the opening and concluding lines of the blessing remain more or\nless consistent throughout the various texts, the middle sets of\nrequests differ widely. A number of possibilities account for these\ndifferent versions. There may have been initially a shorter version\nupon which people added lines, or a longer form which became\nshortened. Alternatively, it may have been a medium-length blessing with various strophes being added and/or deleted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As @magicker72 notes in the comments above, the text of the Gemara, especially as regards the nusah for blessings and prayers, was often edited to reflect the local practice.</p>\n<p>As for how such differences in nusah developed between communities in the first place. That is primarily a function of time and geography and sometimes competing halakhic traditions (e.g. Babylonian vs Israel based practice). As well as the halakhic culture of different communities historically, with some being more open to overtly adapting/modifying the nusah and others being far more conservative and averse to such change (if I recall correct, this was once a bone of contention between French and German Jews, I'll cite to Kanarfogel if I remember later).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are we forbidden from striving to develop biotech that can make us immortal since that would essentially be like biting off from the Tree of Life?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the recent years, there has been a lot of talk and investment in the biotech space regarding life extension, with some saying that the eventual goal is to make us live forever. However, to strive to live forever could be interpreted as an attempt to take also of the tree of life and live forever, something which seems that G-d, blessed be He, doesn't want us to do as can be seen from Genesis 3:22 after the fall:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, would we be forbidden from trying to develop such technology, and perhaps could we, at best, try to develop life saving or life-extending technologies that make our lifespans longer by a reasonable amount as opposed to forever? What do the texts say about this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't believe that there is any tradition of relating to the cited clause from Gen. 3:22 as a legal prohibition.</p>\n<p>My evidence for this is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I'm a fairly well-educated Jewish layperson, and I've never heard of such a prohibition.</li>\n<li>If you look on Sefaria for <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.22?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Halakhah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">references to this verse in legal texts</a>, two come up, and neither relates specifically to this clause about the Tree of Life.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This absence is not surprising, given the structure of the verse. In it, God is reacting to Adam and Eve's transgression of that which was a prohibition for them - eating from the Tree of Knowledge - in a manner designed to prevent them from taking from the Tree of Life and living forever. This implies that such taking is an outcome God wants to prevent, but does not describe a second prohibition, which would presumably be phrased in the second person rather than in the third person.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi on Genesis 3:22 explains that the reason why G-d had a problem with Adam living forever, was because he feared that the coming generations will mistake Adam to be a deity, being that no one was around when he was created (Gur Aryeh), which doesn’t apply in this case, and the sages teach that there were those - such as Elijah - who indeed attained immortality!</p>\n<p>But at the end of the day, it’s still in G-d’s hands, and he can always take away this power, like the sages teach regarding Hiram (Ezekiel 28), who was rewarded with immortality, but lost it later on for this reason</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it to our credit, or our discredit, if we feel ashamed and in awe of the Greatness of the Divine Presence?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a theme that appears a lot in the commentaries that being afraid of holiness, ashamed of nakedness and so on are either good things, or unfortunate results of bad things.</p>\n<p>For an example of the former, we have <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.8?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Haamek Davar</a> from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Zvi_Yehuda_Berlin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And they heard the voice: The rule is that in a place where, relative to the recipient, it is not fit for there to be a revelation of the Divine Presence, but the time nevertheless necessitates a revelation of the Divine presence, there is a sounding of a [loud] voice. It is like the metaphor of the Sages, may their memory be blessed, \"A coin in an [otherwise empty] barrel calls, 'Kish, kish' (makes much noise).\" And for that reason, they said in Sotah 9b concerning Shimshon, that the Divine Presence was beating in front of him like a [bell] clapper. And that is because he was not properly prepared - regarding the separation from desire for a woman - for the attainment of the holy spirit; but he attained the holy spirit nevertheless. So behold, up until now, Adam was clinging to the Divine Presence; and the woman did not see or know what the revelation of the Divine Presence was at all, but was rather like a monkey. However, from the time they ate from the tree of knowledge, both of them understood the greatness of that thing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like it is saying that the greatness of the revelation of the Divine Presence was only noticed <em>once they sinned</em>. I.e., now that they have knowledge of Good and Evil, they are able to recognise the holiness, whereas before they were ignorant to it. So regardless how you interpret the connection between the sin and the improvement, either way this aspect of things is an <em>improvement</em> and is therefore <strong>to their credit.</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.30?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This Rashi</a> also sounds like it is saying the same sort of thing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וייראו מגשת אליו AND THEY WERE AFRAID TO STEP NIGH UNTO HIM — Come and\nsee how great is the power (influence) of sin! For before they\nstreched forth their hand to sin what does Scripture say? (Exodus\n24:17) “And the sight of the glory of the Lord was like devouring fire\non the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel”, —\nand yet they were not afraid and did not tremble! But after they made\nthe golden calf they recoiled and trembled even at the sight of the\nrays of glory of Moses! (Sifrei Bamidbar 1:8)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I normally read this Rashi as \"<em>before the Golden Calf, they were ignorant to the awe one should feel in the presence of Hashem's Greatness, but now</em> look at the power of sin, <em>the end result of the sin and the teshuva is a higher level than before: they now feel the awe and are unable to even look at Moshe's holy face</em>\".</p>\n<p>However I am also wondering, maybe it's not to be read that way. Maybe it's a descent, not an ascent. Maybe this is non-ideal. Being pure and sin-free <em>allows one to look Hashem in the eye, so to speak, without shame</em>, which is higher and better. <strong>Not being able to is to one's discredit</strong>. The \"power of sin\" ruined it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.8?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim on Bereshit 3:8</a> (along with the pashut understand of the events in 3), imply that this is indeed a lower madregah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>They heard the voice</strong>. Before the sin they were able to communicate\nwith Hashem directly, as Moshe did, without the assistance of the\nimagination. Therefore their prophecies were accompanied by no sensory\nperceptions, either audible or visual. That is why they experienced no\nfright, unlike later prophets. Now, however, their physical natures\nhad become dominant and their prophecies were cloaked in more tangible\ngarb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I've seen other midrashim as well that imply this shame and embarrassment is a step down. I'll try to quote them.</p>\n<p>So which is it? Is it to our credit, or our discredit, if we can recognise, and feel ashamed and in awe of, the Greatness of the Divine Presence? Or perhaps it's a mixed answer - the more awe and shame we feel, <em>yet are able to stand up straight despite that</em>, the better, because truly it is fitting for a finite being to be in awe of Hashem, yet at the same time, if the finite being can emulate Hashem and stand straight in His Presence, such a person has truly made the best of all sides and become a gadol.</p>\n<p>Edit: I noticed the other day that the Arizal holds Hevel accountable for having gazed at the Divine Presence as it descended to consume his offering (and hence was chayiv mita). This is an interesting data point.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>We find that even before the sin, they were afraid to hear Hashem’s voice, by Mattan Torah - because they were afraid that they might die - and Hashem praised them for this (Devarim 5:20-25),\nand even Moshe - who spoke with Hashem, and was able to gaze upon Hashem’s glory - hid his face by the burning bush (although there is an argument in the Gemara (Berachos 7a) as to whether Hashem was happy with that, considering his level of greatness), and the Ben Yehoyada explains that Moshe did not want to see Hashem’s face in order that he remain in his physical body etc.</p>\n<p>There is also the concept of not gazing excessively at the things that represent Hashem’s glory, in a case where it isn’t necessary, such as the rainbow, the Nassi, and the Kohanim while they recite the blessings in the Beis Hamikdash (Chagigah 16a), and even by Matan Torah, those who gazed upon Hashem’s glory while eating - which is disrespectful - and drinking were punished (Vayikra Rabbah 20:10)</p>\n<p>so it would seem that there is a difference between the fear of “seeing his face” and “hearing His voice” - which is praiseworthy and relevant in all situations, regardless of one’s level (aside from Moshe, perhaps), as part of the Mitzvah of fearing Hashem - and just seeing “His glory”, which had they been on the proper level, they wouldn’t need to be afraid to do, when done respectfully and only when necessary</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Found a source in favour of the great goodness of having shame about being naked (all thanks to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/138069/31534\">@Shmuel</a>). Rav Hoffman <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/SP/R.%20David%20Zvi%20Hoffmann/Bereshit/2.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בתחילה נברא האדם בלי דעת טוב ורע. אפילו הבושה להתהלך ערום, שהיתה\n<strong>סגולתם של כל בני קדם הידועים לנו</strong>, אף אותה לא ידעוה אדם וחוה</p>\n<p>At first, man was created without the knowledge of good and evil.

But the only two mitzvos of Shabbos that the Torah writes openly is to not go out of the techum - אל יצא איש ממקומו [Shemos, 16, 29] and to not light a fire.

Does that mean that one is no longer benefiting of \"sacrificial food (kadshei shamayim)\"? If so then what is he benefiting from?</p>\n<p>If so, that would imply that through the act of the brocho, one is lowering the status of the food to a lower level. It seems counterintuitive, why should an act of holiness, a brocho and hamshacha of divine light, cause the object that it's being recited over</p>\n<p>(That is receiving the hamshacha)</p>\n<p>To degrade to a lower status than it was? That would imply that maybe it's better not to make a bracha, chos vishalom, so as not to lower the status of the food! (But that would be absurd to think, since the world is made to draw down Hashem's light into it).</p>\n<p>So what is the explanation for the effect that a brocho has on the food itself, if any?</p>\n<p>And if the brocho really elevates the person to become elevated to such a level that he can now partake even of kadshei shamayim, like the servant of a kohen can eat sacrificial meat since he's entirely nullified and given over to the kohen, then what's the point of the Gemara saying that</p>\n<p>\"Anyone who benefits from this world without a bracha is as if he partook of sacrificial offerings\", if that would be the case even after saying the brocho?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Just as by a sacrifice, there is a time when it is forbidden and when it is permitted - I.e. before and after the blood was sprayed on the altar - the same would apply with regards to making a blessing, as the Gemara earlier  calls it Me’ilah, which is the term used for benefiting from a sacrifice before it becomes permissible</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Rav Chaim Volozhiner Nefesh haChaim sec 2, the whole \"it is as if stealing\" thing isn't the way people assume from seeing the gemara.</p>\n<p>I was taught as a child that everything is G-d's, and so if you eat that apple without a <em>berakhah</em> you are taking from the Owner without asking permission. Thus, it is like <em>me'ilah</em>, stealing from <em>heqdeish</em> (the sacred).</p>\n<p>The Nefesh haChaim develops the idea that every physical object has in it inherent spiruality. After all, everything that happens in this world has metaphysical causes in higher ones. When a person makes a <em>berakhah</em>, they connect to that <em>qedushah</em>, and cause more of the fruit's inherent spirituality to be manifest in the world.</p>\n<p>And (he says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nefesh_HaChayim%2C_Gate_II.2.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:2</a>) this is why it is called a <em>berakhah</em>, from the word <em>barukh</em>, meaning increase. (Think \"<em>berekhah</em>\", a wellspring.) A <em>berakhah</em> increases the spirituality of this world. It would be heretical to say we are increasing G-d Himself, as though weren't already Infinite or that He lacked something (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nefesh_HaChayim%2C_Gate_II.2.5.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:5</a>).</p>\n<p>And (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nefesh_HaChayim%2C_Gate_II.2.3.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:3</a>) the phrasing of a <em>berakhah</em> is from the second person to the third \"<em>Barukh Atah</em> -- blessed are You\" to \"Who Created / Commanded / Brought forth...\" We are tracing that flow from the Source down into the physical world to bring it to manifestation here.</p>\n<p>Eating without a <em>berakhah</em> is thus stealing that potential for G-dliness from the world.</p>\n\n\n",

And she bore to Amram Aharon, Moses, and Miriam their sister.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verse is superficially ungrammatical. If \"her\" refers to Yocheved's birth, it should have said \"who was born to Levi\" and it wouldn't need a pronoun. If it refers to Levi's wife, it should have said \"hi\" (i.e., she), and it would still be odd to use a pronoun for a person not previously named or referenced.

And seemingly, as soon as he found out, he took action against the decrees of Haman.</p>\n<p>But can we really say that Achashverosh was not aware that Haman was plotting to destroy the entire Jewish population?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>At least in the Gemara it's clear that Achashverosh also wanted to get rid of the Jews and was happy with Haman's scheme. Megillah 14a commenting on Esther 3:11 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מָשָׁל דַּאֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ וְהָמָן לָמָּה הַדָּבָר דּוֹמֶה? לִשְׁנֵי בְּנֵי אָדָם, לְאֶחָד הָיָה לוֹ תֵּל בְּתוֹךְ שָׂדֵהוּ וּלְאֶחָד הָיָה לוֹ חָרִיץ בְּתוֹךְ שָׂדֵהוּ. בַּעַל חָרִיץ אָמַר: מִי יִתֵּן לִי תֵּל זֶה בְּדָמִים! בַּעַל הַתֵּל אָמַר: מִי יִתֵּן לִי חָרִיץ זֶה בְּדָמִים!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The actions of Ahasuerus and Haman can be understood with a parable; to what may they be compared? To two individuals, one of whom had a mound in the middle of his field and the other of whom had a ditch in the middle of his field, each one suffering from his own predicament. The owner of the ditch, noticing the other’s mound of dirt, said to himself: Who will give me this mound of dirt suitable for filling in my ditch; I would even be willing to pay for it with money, and the owner of the mound, noticing the other’s ditch, said to himself: Who will give me this ditch for money, so that I may use it to remove the mound of earth from my property? (Shteinzaltz translation and elaboration).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also the gemara on 13b elaborates on what Haman said in 3:8-10, and those criticisms are clearly specific to the Jews. I.e., Haman was trying to incite the King against the Jews and not some vague undesirable nation.</p>\n<p>As for Esther, Achashverosh did not know what nation Esther was. That's pshat in Ether 2:10, and mentioned repeatedly in Megillah 13-15.</p>\n<p>So, based on the gemara, Achashverosh knew the decree was to kill the Jews but he did not know Esther was Jewish, so he was surprised by her revelation (especially since he was antisemitic so why would he think his wife was Jewish).</p>\n<p>If you want a more \"pshat\" answer not based on the Gemara, Achashverosh didn't know the nation Haman had in mind but was shocked to find out it was the same nation as Esther. After all, he was king over 127 nations so the odds were less than 1%, and furthermore it seems quite audacious for Haman to go after the Queen's nation. Either way, to your specific question, there was no evidence for Achashverosh to \"put together\" until Esther's denouement.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Midrash on Esther gives another take on the matter.  Haman tries to convince the king to allow him to kill all the Jews.  The king is skeptical because the Jews are protected by God:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Resh Lakish said: When the wicked Haman said to Ahashverosh: “Come, let us exterminate Israel”, Ahashverosh replied: “You cannot prevail against them, since their God will not entirely forsake them. See what he did to the kings who preceded us and who laid hands upon them and who were much mightier and more powerful than we are. Whoever comes against them to destroy them and whoever schemes against them is wiped out... How much more so, then, we, who are not equal to those others.  Let me hear no more of this...” [Esther R. 7:13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

When I see someone with very short hair on the top of his head, but gigantic <em>peyos</em>, I tend to assume that he is a non-Chabad Chassid, rightly or wrongly.

The Rabbis of Provence say you missed a prayer so you need two the next time; the Ri says you do not gain anything by praying a second time because you cannot correct what you missed since we no longer mention rosh chodesh at night. See MB 108:10. Because it is a safek, the Shulchan Aruch concludes one should pray it as a tefilat nedavah (voluntary prayer). SA 108:10; MB 108:32-33. There is also a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/126885/did-rav-hai-gaon-pray-maariv-twice-on-friday-night-when-the-tsibbur-prayed-befor/126898#comment417969_126898\">machloket rishonim</a> whether one can make a voluntary tefilah on shabat. The SA and MB conclude you should not. SA 107:1; MB 108:33.</p>\n<p>So the big question is whether messing up the prayer for rain is similar to forgetting yaaleh v'yavo or different. This appears to be a machloket acharonim. The Magen Avraham (end of 108) writes that for sure one would repeat a second prayer if one forgot yaaleh v'yavo on the first day of yom tov [because yaaleh v'yavo is also relevant at night] and then says: וה\"ה אם שכח ותן טל ומטר או משיב הרוח <em>and so too if one forgot tal u'matar or mashiv haruach.</em> The MB 108:35 also says יעלה ויבא - בדיוקא נקט יעלה ויבא דאם שכח טל ומטר או משיב הרוח בשבת ור\"ח במנחה או ששכח שאר דבר המצריכו לחזור ולהתפלל לכו\"ע יתפלל בערב שתים דהא ירויח זה בתפילת התשלומין: <em>the rule is specific to yaaleh v'yavo, but if he forgot tal u'matar or mashiv haruach on shabat [erev shabat?] or rosh chodesh at mincha or he forgot another thing that he must repeat his prayer for, then according to everyone he should pray two at night...</em> Both of these sources seem to be saying that there is a difference between yaaleh v'yavo and an error in one of the brachot themselves. Rav Chaim Soloveichik says that explicitly in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40894&st=&pgnum=37\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"stencil\" chiddushim.</a>: according to the Ri, omitting yaaleh v'yavo on rosh chodesh is a valid prayer but fails to include a necessary addition, so you only need to pray again so you can mention yaaleh v'yavo; but erring in the blessing for rain invalidates the whole tefilah and it's as if you did not pray mincha at all, so you need to pray tashlumin. (HT @Joel K). However, this <a href=\"https://beinenu.com/sites/default/files/alonim/103_98_78.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">contemporary article from \"Beineinu\"</a> reads the Magen Avraham and Mishnah Berurah exactly the opposite: that all errors are the same. <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/112330\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This online teshuvah</a> from Rav Yitzchak ben Yosef also treats the two cases as the same and says you should not say tashlumin Friday night if you forgot to ask for rain Friday afternoon.</p>\n<p>A second question is whether incorrectly asking for rain in the summer is the same or different from omitting the prayer for rain in the winter. The Shulchan Aruch 117:3 says that if you mention rain when you shouldn't, you must repeat the shmoneh esrei as an actual obligation, unless you live in a country that needs rain in the summer in which case it is a safek whether you need to repeat and you should add a second tefilah as a voluntary offering (<em>nedavah</em>). SA 117:2. In other words, in the default case, incorrectly praying for rain invalidates the whole tefilah. Thus, according to the Grach, and my understanding of the Magen Avraham and Mishnah Berurah, you should pray tashlumin on Friday night. (If forgetting to mention rain is seen as \"not praying\" rather than omitting an addition like yaaleh v'yavo, kal v'chomer (<em>a fortiori</em>) improperly mentioning rain should have the same status. If all you had to do was \"not ask for rain,\" you could do that without repeating the shmoneh esrei at all!)</p>\n<p>According to the opposing approach--that you should not do tashlumin unless you can fix your mistake by doing so--I could see an argument that the obligation to <em><strong>not</strong></em> pray for rain is common between Friday afternoon and Shabat, so even the Ri would agree you can do tashlumin. In which case there would be no safek and tashlumin would be proper even on shabat.  But I don't think this is correct, because at the end of the day you messed up a specific blessing (the blessing of years), and you will not be saying that blessing at night. So I would think that the rule of not mentioning rain should be basically the same as the rule of mentioning it, but <em>tzarikh iyun.</em></p>\n<p>The Beineunu article I linked above proposes another creative solution. Technically, a prayer on shabat that mentions the weekday blessings is valid b'dieved. SA 268:2. So in your case, you could just include the additional weekday blessings you messed up on Friday night and conclude with the blessing for shabat and that would even satisfy the opinion of the Ri. However the article itself leaves this as a matter of <em>tzarikh iyun</em> (requiring further investigation).</p>\n<p>Finally note that, in places that need rain in the summer, the tashlumin for mentioning tal u'matar in the summer is a nedava anyway because there is an independent safek about whether you need to repeat at all, so the rule not to make voluntary prayers on shabat would apply regardless. The poskim mention Spain, Ashkenaz, and Eastern Europe as being in this category. See Biur Halacha to 117:2. It seems to me that much of the U.S. has a similar climate to Ashkenaz in that farmers rely on rain in at least part of the time between Pesach and Sukkot. I have not found a halakhic source discussing hte matter, but I did ask a posek in Lakewood and he thought that svara comparing U.S. and Europe was \"pashut.\" However, there are other opinions that say these countries only count as \"needing rain\" in a time of drought, and not times of summer when they need and are receiving rain. Biur Halachah (id.) brings both opinions and concludes that since it is a safek one should repeat the tefilah conditionally. Similar issues also arise in the Southern Hemisphere where the summer and winter can be the opposite of what they are in Israel.  Where they apply, these considerations add additional variables that could make repeating the shmone esrei a safek nedava and not a vadai tashlumin, suggesting it should not be made on shabat.</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> if one forgot yaaleh v'yavo on the afternoon of Friday Rosh Chodesh and shabat is not Rosh Chodesh, the SA and MB rule one should not say two tefilot on shabat because you will not be saying yaaleh v'yavo anyway, which makes tashlumin a safek and we do not do safek tashlumin on shabat . There is a machloket acharonim if this rule is specific to yaaleh v'yavo or also applies to defects in the blessings themselves. It seems to me that omitting the prayer for rain in winter and including it in summer should have the same status, though I concede that is not 100% clear. In addition, if you live in a place where rain is needed in the summer there is also a separate safek whether you need tashlumin at all, which would be an additional factor against praying twice Friday night.</p>\n\n\n",

He is just addressing the idea of guf naki which in some cases would prevent one from doing the miztvas aseh. How far guf naki goes is a separate discussion amongst the Rishonim.</p>\n<p>Text:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vBIUC.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/vBIUC.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Text of Shevuos 25b:</p>\n<p>מתיב רב המנונא לא אכלתי היום ולא הנחתי תפילין היום משביעך אני ואמר אמן חייב בשלמא לא אכלתי איתיה בלא אוכל אלא לא הנחתי מי איתיה בלא אניח</p>\n\n\n",

He said to him: What are you doing here? The man said to him: I have a case to present before you. Rav Anan would not accept the basket from him, and he said to him: I am disqualified from presiding over your case (due to the prohibition of a judge accepting payment)</p>\n<p>The man said to him: I do not need the Master’s judgment. However, let the Master accept my gift anyway, so that the Master does not prevent me from presenting first fruits. What does the mitzva of first fruits have to with this situation? As it is taught in a baraita: “And there came a man came from Ba’al Shalisha, and he brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and fresh ears of corn in his sack” (II Kings 4:42). But did Elisha, the recipient of these gifts, eat first fruits? After all, he was not a priest. Rather, this verse comes to tell you: <strong>Whoever brings a gift to a Torah scholar, it is as though he has presented first fruits</strong> (<strong>Bikurim</strong>). This visitor to Rav Anan wished to fulfill this mitzva.</p>\n<p>Rav Anan said to him: I do not want to take it from you, but now that you have explained to me the reason that you wish to give it to me I will accept it from you. Rav Anan sent the man to Rav Naḥman, and he also sent him a letter: Let the Master judge this man’s case because I, Anan, am disqualified from judging his cases (Kesubos 106b)</p>\n\n\n",

You are forbidden from gifting one to a non-Jewish friend for this reason.</p>\n<p>My question is regarding two scenarios and whether either of these scenarios would make such a gift acceptable.</p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 1.</strong> - The mezuzah scroll itself is not a traditional scroll. Instead of it containing the traditional lines from Devarim, the scroll is custom. <em><strong>You hire a scribe to write a custom scroll which asks for Hashem to protect and bless the home of this trusted friend of the Jewish people.</strong></em> - <em>In this scenario, the scroll would not function according to the traditional practice and would be a personalized scroll for a specific individual. Not an attempt at keeping a commandment reserved for the Jewish people. You would also be giving work to a scribe and benefiting the local Jewish community in the process.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Scenario 2.</strong> - The scroll is non-kosher and inappropriate for Jewish use. Since the scroll itself is imperfect or cannot be used, the non-Jew wouldn't be in possession of a true Jewish religious item. <em><strong>In this context, it would be similar to how you might have a non-Jewish prospective convert keep Shabbat but partially break Shabbat mid-observance as to not violate the restriction of non-Jews keeping shabbat.</strong></em> - <em>Again, this would also be beneficial to the Jewish community since practicing scribes could resell non-kosher scrolls to be used by non-Jews who respect Judaism but don't wish to convert.</em></p>\n<p>How would the Halacha view either of these two scenarios? I know we tend to be restrictive of Jewish articles being used by non-Jews but I have to wonder if we might be able to expand access to non-Jews within specific restrictive terms. Meaning we give non-Jews access to recognize Torah and Judaism and Hashem but we set a separate standard in terms of the items they have access to.</p>\n\n\n",

Yosef represents the tefillin of the arm, connecting the Infinite with created beings (the worlds of Beri'ah, Yetzirah and Assiyah)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The tefillin of the head enable the connection (chibur, related to 'attachment') of the Infinite with the emanated beings (the sefirot). This draws down additional light into the sefirot of Atzilut, specifically Abba and Imma.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The tefillin of the arm connect the Infinite with created beings. This is because the tefillin of the arm correspond to Malchut, the lowest sefirah, which bridges to the created worlds. Malchut is referred to as 'Yad Kehah', the 'dark hand'.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The tefillin of the head are referred to as 'Tash'R', meaning 'ornament'. They ornament and beautify the sefirot. The tefillin of the arm are a 'garment' for the created beings. The sefirot themselves are referred to as 'tikkunim', which also means 'ornaments'.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Thus, Yaakov represents Tash'R, connecting the Infinite to the emanated beings, while Yosef represents Tash'Y, connecting the Infinite to created beings. Yosef is described as a 'Poret Yosef', with 'poret' having the same letters as 'tofer' - meaning to connect.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Though light must first extend through Atzilut for there to be a flow into the created worlds, the passage says that the donning of tefillin of the arm (Tash'Y) precedes that of the tefillin of the head (Tash'R). This is because the mitzvot performed by the Jewish people draw down a higher light than the mitzvot on their own. This is especially true of tefillin, which refer to the Jewish people as God's chosen one, His 'am segulah'. Therefore, the Tash'Y, which corresponds to human action, reaches higher than Tash'R. The increase caused by donning tefillin, the union of Ein Sof in both Atzilut and the created worlds, comes primarily through Tash'Y.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The passage explains that human action, by transcending all revelations including that of Chesed, reaches the level of God's transcendent Will. Therefore human avodah increases the light in the mitzvot. This is another reason why the increase from tefillin primarily comes through Tash'Y - because it reaches the Essence that transcends the source of all revelation and emanation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<p>Based on this it seems that the main thing would be the tefillin of the hand, but it also says that the tefillin of the head itself is the main thing in terms of the revelation of the light. So it's still not clear if one is missing the head - the revelation of light - if he should still draw down the Essence through the hand.</p>\n<p>The question of how could someone live without a head, first of all:</p>\n<p>Not all questions in the Torah have real practical applications. One time in a Gemara shiur in B\"K the Rav was giving two possible ways of explaining the sugya, and someone asked, \"what's the practical difference?\" And the answer was that if one is mikadeish an isha on the condition that the sugya means one way or the other, is it a valid kiddushin.</p>\n<p>Maybe someone actually has a brain, but the section of the head that the tefillin needs to be put on could be either damaged, partially missing chos vishalom, or otherwise inaccessible. In this case the question of what to do about the hand tefillin (if a bracha should be made on it etc or if one is totally pattur) applies at all.</p>\n<p>Do we say that maybe the entire purpose of drawing down the Essence (hand) is for the sake of the revelation (head), and thus without the revelation one shouldn't put the hand one on (with a bracha), or maybe that even the essence alone is valuable in it's own right?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rema in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.26.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">26:2</a> brings from the Tur that one who only puts on the shel yad (for whatever reason) should only make one bracha (insinuating that he should still put on the shel yad alone)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם הניח של יד לבד מברך להניח לבד [טור]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if one only puts on the hand tefillin, he should only recite the blessing \"...to place\" (Tur)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The MB in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.26.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">26:3</a> brings others who disagree and say that both brachos should be made, however he concludes that most hold only one is made:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(ג) מברך להניח - עיין בפמ\"ג שהביא עוד פוסקים דס\"ל דאף על של יד לבד נמי מברך שתי ברכות ולהלכה הסכימו האחרונים דאינו מברך על ש\"י אלא להניח לבד דבלא\"ה הרבה ראשונים ס\"ל דאפילו על שתיהן נמי אינו מברך אלא אחת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He should only recite the blessing \"...to place\" - See Pri Megadim who quotes other poskim who hold that even on the hand tefillin alone one should recite both blessings.

Later commentators assume that Hillel belonged to the Nesi'im dynasty and was a patriarch, following the lineage of Hillel the Elder. Some inaccurately suggest that Hillel was the son or grandson of R. Yehuda HaNasi, likely due to copying errors. The commonly accepted view identifies Hillel as the great-grandson of R. Yehuda HaNasi, but this creates historical difficulties as there were multiple individuals named \"R. Yehuda Nesiah\" descended from Rabbeinu HaKadosh.

In this case, would God have acted on impulse and anger and when it calmed down, did he realize that he had not solved the problem, that this is something ingrained in human beings and that from now on the approach would have to be different?

The intellectual argument Hashem made was the same, but before the flood, He had lost the pleasure on His creation and therefore the argument lent towards destruction.

Their Creator will approach them with his mighty sword [and slay them both];\" then, \"from the beautiful skin of the Leviathan, God will construct canopies to shelter the righteous, who will eat the meat of the Behemoth and the Leviathan amid great joy and merriment.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But the quote is not sourced.</p>\n<p>I did some Googling and found that the first part of the quote comes from Akdamut.

    "content": "# Why kill a Ben sorrer umoreh for stealing according to the Gemara?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Masechet Sanhedrin daf 72a, the Gemara discusses that the Ben sorrer umoreh is judged on his Sofo, that eventually he’ll steal from his father and then come to steal from others, and because of this he’s killed. But why, according to this step by step logic that the Gemara presents, should he be killed? A normal thief only has to pay back what he stole, he never dies!\nAnd the Rambam when discussing Ben sorrer umoreh says that eventually he’ll come to kill after stealing, so accordingly it makes sense to kill him now (to prevent him from killing later where he’ll be liable to the death penalty). So why doesn’t the Gemara mention that he’ll come to kill as the final step? According to the Gemara it seems illogical to kill him now if all he’s going to do is steal</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I  would venture to explain that perhaps you are translating a word wrong in the Gemora, the words ומלסטם את הבריות this does not mean a thievery this is an armed robbery in which there are death expected. Like the Gemora in Sotah page 8B it has the same rules as if the king want to kill him. These robbers were killers, no questions about it. The Gemora in Sanhedrin you quoted was not about the stealing but about the killing. Hence we kill him “for the end” which is he is going to kill people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Executing a person now for possible future crimes is a concept explicitly negated in Chazal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the actions he is now doing shall he be judged and not according to what he may do in future. Because the ministering angels laid information against [Yishmael], saying, “Master of the Universe, for him whose descendants will at one time kill your children with thirst will You provide a well?” He asked them, “What is he now, righteous or wicked?” They replied to him, “Righteous.” He said to them, “According to his present deeds will I judge him.” (Genesis Rabbah 53:14).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Second, since the whole reason to prohibit asking a non Jew to do melacha is because we are afraid that people will come to rely on it in the future, in this case, where the light was on, and the non Jew caused the issue, we are not worried. The difference between these reasons are mentioned by Rav Wosner in a case of a shabbos clock that has the light off and the non Jew turns it on, if the Jew can benefit from it. In this case he didn’t turn it off, but the Jew had set up a different way to turn it on and therefore we shouldn’t worry about him relying on it in the future.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Shaving on eve of Lag B’omer\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why am I allowed to listen to music on the night of Lag B’omer, yet I have to wait for the following morning, or the day of lag b’omer to shave and take a haircut?  Why can I not shave the night before if music is allowed then?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The celebration of Lag b'Omer and the ending of the Omer mourning period on the 33rd are not necessarily the same concept. Most Sephardim do not cut their hair until the 34th but still celebrate on the 33rd. And some Ashkenazim observe the mourning period from Rosh Chodesh Iyar onwards, yet still celebrate on the 33rd. The core avelut practices of the Omer are not taking haircuts and not getting married. The Shulchan Aruch and Rema don't even mention not listening to music. Orach Chaim 493 (to be fair, the Mechaber thinks it's asur to listen to music year round). The general rule of avelut (mourning) is that mourning ends the morning of the last day of mourning because part of the day (in this context, daytime hours) is like the whole day. So the prohibitions on cutting hair and getting married remain in effect until the avelut ends on the morning of the 33rd or 34th. However, not listening to music during sefira is a later and less absolute custom. The custom not to listen to music is relaxed on the 33rd because of the hilulah of Rashbi. See Hazon Ovadia on Hilchot Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>Also, although the common custom is that music and hair cuts have different time periods, not everyone agrees. There are acharonim who say you can get a haircut on the night of the 33rd as well, see MB 493:11. Conversely, I have seen <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1320/music-on-lag-baomer\">some</a> <a href=\"https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/coffeeroom/topic/listening-to-music-on-lag-baomer-is-it-only-from-the-morning-or-even-in-the-evening\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">discussion</a> that maybe you shouldn't listen to music at night, but I haven't seen a posek who says that inside. (<a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2010/04/30/music-on-lag-bomer-night/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This article</a> cites Shevet HaLevi 8:168 for that proposition)</p>\n<p>The part I cannot explain is why the Rema writes that those who observe sefirah from Iyar through Shavuot are allowed to cut their hair on Lag b'Omer. They are still in the avelut window. And if it's because of Rashbi, why they can't cut their hair at night? Perhaps you could say the simcha of Lag b'Omer predates the custom of avelut during the Omer and therefore when the mourning customs arose they carved out Lag b'Omer, and as for timing of haircuts they wanted to follow the same customs as other mourners and wait until the morning to avoid confusion. But that's just a theory.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dovid Feinstein did in fact consider it a contradiction and he used the fact that people celebrate with music at night as a proof that the majority begin their celebration of the holiday on the eve of Lag Ba'Omer.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ykVE7.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/ykVE7.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/khfwc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/khfwc.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>This was in fact the practical opinion of his father, Reb Moshe Feinstein as well, see Shu't Vidibarta Bam 143, who held the reason to be able to shave was not miktzas Yom, but rather since Lag Bi'omer is treated as a holiday. There he speaks at length and quotes the Igros Moshe in O'ch 1 #159 and Chassam Soffer in O'ch #142 who want to assume weddings are stricter than haircuts in regards to this, and the prevailing minhagim to allow weddings should allow haircuts as well, although Reb Moshe agrees the M.B. and the Elya Rabba he is ruling like can say an opposite svara that the allowance in the morning is miktzas yom kikulo.</p>\n<p>I would add that up until recently, almost anyone engaging in music on the night of Lag Bi'omer was someone who didn't shave, so it probably never dawned on him he was ruling like the achronim who say the various is done by the time tachnun is no longer said on the eve of Lag Bi'omer. That and in all likelihood those people hadn't said tachnun in a few days since it is the week of Hod. Only more recently have people who shave started to join in the musical reveries on Lag Bi'omer night, not realizing if they wanted to keep strictly to the Mishna Berurah, they really shouldn't.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As far as I can tell, both are technically not appropriate to do until the day time, but we make an exception for music and permit it at night because it is observed as a festive day celebrating Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai. So we permit appropriate music <em>in order to celebrate the occasion</em>. Otherwise, it is forbidden to listen to music until the day.</p>\n<p>All of the above is for Ashkenazim. For Sefardim, one may not shave until the <em>day</em> of the 34th (following the Shulchan Aruch), and one may not listen to music (except to celebrate Lag Ba'Omer) until then either (provided they are relying on the leniencies to actually listen to music at all anytime of the year).</p>\n<p>The reason is because of the principle of \"Miktzat Ha'yom Ke'kulo\" (a bit of the day is like the whole day). This means that <em>the day</em> of Lag Ba'Omer is supposed to be \"the whole day\", but we consider part of the day as <em>the day</em> due to \"Miktzat Ha'yom Ke'kulo\". So therefore we can start \"early\" and listen to music/shave even on Lag Ba'Omer. However, and this is the key point, \"Miktzat Ha'yom Ke'kulo\" <em>only applies to daytime</em>, not night. So the night is still \"too early\" for these things. For more information on this see Hazon Ovadya, Yom Tov, p.g 261.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Big thanks to Rabbi Eli Mansour for his shiur on this!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the battle between Leviathan and Behemoth stand for the battle between Rome and Persia?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We first meet descriptions of the Behemoth and Leviathan in the book of Job. In the prophecy of Daniel wild beasts are used to represent kingdoms. We have received a tradition that the Leviathan and the Behemoth will do battle in the end of days and slaughter each other. If the Leviathan and the Behemoth represent kingdoms that do battle in the end of days which kingdoms do they represent?</p>\n<p>In tractate Avodah Zarah 2b we read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is because with regard to these, Rome and Persia, their kingship extends until the coming of the Messiah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we find that these two kingdoms of all the kingdoms of the earth will survive to the end of days. But the likeness doesn't stop there. Where do we find that these two kingdoms will do battle? In tractate Yoma 10 a we read:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said that Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: Rome is destined to fall into the hands of Persia</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and also the contrary opinion that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In contrast, Rav said: Persia is destined to fall into the hands of Rome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Either way we see they are destined to do battle. Interestingly both opinions can be seen to be correct if like Leviathan and Behemoth they slaughter each other.</p>\n<p>We also read that Leviathan is a giant fish that resides in the Mediterranean sea with its mouth open towards the river Jordan see Bava Basra 74b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rav Yehuda says that Rav says: The Jordan issues forth from the cave of Pamyas. That is also taught in a baraita: The Jordan issues forth from the cave of Pamyas, and travels in the Sea of Sivkhi, i.e., the Hula Lake, and in the Sea of Tiberias, the Sea of Galilee, and rolls down to the Great Sea, and rolls down until it reaches the mouth of the leviathan. As it is stated: “He is confident, though the Jordan rush forth to his mouth” (Job 40:23). Rava bar Ulla strongly objects to this explanation of the verse, stating: But this verse is written about the beasts on the thousand hills. Rather, Rava bar Ulla said that this is the meaning of the verse: When are the beasts on the thousand hills confident? When the Jordan rushes forth into the mouth of the leviathan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If we turn a standard map of Italy such that East faces up rather then North then we see that Italy has the shape of a giant fish with its mouth open towards Israel and thus towards the Jordan river.</p>\n<p>We also read that Behemoth resides to the East of Gan Eden and in Tehillim 50:10 we are told that Behemoth lives on a thousand mountains.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי־לִ֥י כָל־חַיְתוֹ־יָ֑עַר בְּ֜הֵמ֗וֹת בְּהַרְרֵי־אָֽלֶף:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For all the beasts of the forest are Mine, the behemoth of the thousand mountains.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Iran is to the East and is a very mountainous country with an average elevation of about 1000 metres. It also has the rough shape of a beast with horns.</p>\n<p>So my question is are there any reasons why I shouldn't believe that the war between Leviathan and Behemoth represents the war between Rome and Persia? Or could my chidush stand?</p>\n\n\n",

Our goal is to become one, like we once were. The point is brought down in, for example, chassidic mamarim based on the kabbalah that \"back to back\" oneness is not as sublime and lofty as \"face to face\" oneness, so having been split apart, we can turn and face each other and reach a new level of eternal oneness. Judaism, it seems, is the most truly romantic of the belief systems of the world, placing the closeness and true yichud (intimacy) between couples as the highest pinnacle of creation, the upper echelon of spirituality, and the entire Torah is practically a guide on how a husband and wife can learn to become closer than is humanly possible. Their reward is (at least in part), the eternal oneness that is the reward of this effort.</p>\n<p>[<em>Yes, this question will not likely be interesting unless you have a little romance in your heart.</em>]</p>\n<p><strong>This question is more specific than the title implies, please read the background carefully:</strong></p>\n<h2>Sources and Background</h2>\n<p>In this question I am considering <em>just</em> <strong>the case where one spouse from a successful, loving marriage dies younger, and therefore the remaining spouse remarries</strong> (which is encouraged in Judaism: <em>Tav le'metav tan du mi-le'matav armelo</em>). Let's bring some opinions about what this means for the eternity of the couple where the husband dies first (most of the opinions deal with this, there are a few brought for the other way around towards the end). This is the stronger case because generally speaking, the wife is the \"centre\", the \"crown\"<sup>1</sup>, the \"home\"<sup>2</sup>, and thus it makes more sense to ask this question from the husband's point of view (imo).</p>\n<p>According to Hagahot Yad Sha'ul<sup>3</sup>, a woman will reunite with <em>her second husband</em> after the resurrection. See also the Chatam Sofer (355) who ruled that when a woman remarries after being widowed, her second marriage, in effect, nullifies the bond that she had with her first husband<sup>4</sup>.</p>\n<p>The above opinions come up in the context where the woman had children only with the first husband. In the case she had children with both, the Kabbalah says that she will be reunited with her first husband in Heaven<sup>5</sup>.</p>\n<p>There is also the opinion in Piskey Teshuva 124 that brings that a woman will be reunited with her first husband, unless the second marriage was more distinctly successful (according to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210123090531/http://www.ravaviner.com/2011/08/spouses-during-resurrection-of-dead.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Aviner's understanding</a>). In Yabia Omer 7:40, Rav Ovadia paskins that a woman should be buried next to her first husband, unless she specifically requests otherwise.</p>\n<p>The differences between the above opinions is sometimes framed in the context of whether the wife was a virgin at the time of her first marriage. This also raises questions about what if the woman did teshuva, or if she converted prior to getting married, and I'd be happy if someone brought up answers to that in their answer if possible.</p>\n<p>With regards to the husband, there are strong sources that claim he is <em>always</em> connected to his first wife<sup>6</sup>. See also the discrepancy on the duration to which a husband must wait before remarrying vs a wife<sup>7</sup>.</p>\n<p>There is much more to discuss. If anyone has \"The Philosophical Quest\" by J. David Bleich, I believe a lot of information on this topic is found there around page 300 onwards.</p>\n<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>The question is, how do we solve this complicated problem, and what are the ramifications? If we hold that the wife is reunited with her first husband, what of the second husband (if it was his first marriage, and even if not)? Or <em>vice versa</em>. What if there were several remarriages, such as with the Chatam Sofer, <em>lo aleinu</em>?</p>\n<p>A sad image of a young man, madly in love with his wife, lying on his tragic deathbed, knowing that his wife will no longer be his, never again, she will remarry and be someone else's for eternity comes to mind. Is he being punished? What greater <em>Divine gift</em> can a man lose than his home, his crown, his soul mate? Maybe he will pray that her next marriage won't be successful so he can keep her. A worry that perhaps one shouldn't fully let one's heart fall for one's spouse, just in case, comes to mind, especially if he is her second husband. I think it's an important question... The tremendous task of becoming one with someone certainly won't benefit if there are doubts in this area.</p>\n<p>How can we have a more optimistic, as well as complete and sensible picture of this whole issue, that maintains the strongest Jewish opinions on \"soul mates\"? If it's unavoidable that some of us will be \"alone forever\" <em>chas veshalom</em>, then what will be our solace?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It's an emotional question, I'd appreciate answers that:</p>\n<p>a) Support the strongest Jewish stances on \"soul mates\"<br />\nb) Are based on deeper insights, such as sourced in kabbalah and chassidus<br />\nc) Are hopefully optimistic! Becoming \"One\" is such a profoundly important idea, I'd rather find answers that make it ikar, rather than dilute it in any way.</p>\n<p>E.g. a \"nice\" solution might be that when a spouse is lost, a part of the living spouse \"dies with them\", and they truly are united forever. A quick study of Shaar Gilgulim would yield that such things are certainly not out of the realm of possibility, and would be beautiful, yet a positively identified source is sought here.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - Mishlei 12:4<br />\n2 - Rashi on Shemot 19:3<br />\n3 - YD 366:3; See also She'arim Metzuyanim B'halacha 199:7; B'tzel Hachachma 2:73<br />\n4 - See also Be’er Heitev, EH 17:1; Pitchei Teshuva, EH 17:1.

Legally, a lot of this is similar to what you already cite from the Yad Shaul and Yabia Omer, but he has more discussion of the emotional stakes and brings sources that could guide you in further research.</p>\n<p>In Aseh L'kha Rav 7:56 he was asked about a widow who wants to be buried next to her second husband. He discusses the concept of soul mates and states that there is a presumption that a woman's first husband is <em>presumed</em> to be her soul mate, which is based on a Zohar. He also explains that divorce would sever the spiritual bond between them---i.e., a divorced couple are not together in the next world. However, he writes, sometimes a woman's first husband is not in fact her soulmate and she will have a stronger connection to the second husband (for example, maybe the first marriage was unhappy but the husband died before they could get divorced). Certain factors, including whether the couple had children <em>and the woman's own feelings and stated preferences</em> can be clues to which husband was the actual soulmate. Therefore, he concludes, if a woman wants to be buried next to her second husband her wishes should be honored. Even in such cases, however, the severing of the bond between a woman and her non-soulmate first husband is not as absolute as divorce.</p>\n<p>Rav HaLevi does leave many questions unanswered: for example what happens to the first husband? Or what would happen to the second husband in most cases? And whether if a man had two successive wives and neither was a widow from someone else whether he would be with both in the next world. Still, it provides a perspective regarding the situation of a woman with two husbands and what role the spiritual and emotional connection plays. Personally, I'd like to believe that for any man (or woman) who doesn't find his soulmate during life (whether because he never married, or had an unhappy marriage that divorced, or was a second husband) he'll meet the right person in another gilgul or in the yemot hamashiach etc. But I don't have a source for that (yet?).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The OP specifically requested positive answers, so let's rephrase the statement accordingly: Is the focus of Judaism primarily on the positivity of life? When asked about women's rights and Judaism, Rabbi Shimon Gruen emphasized the importance of not approaching Torah with a lens solely based on Western values. He stated that the Torah has its own set of values, and if one's perspective does not align with it, the Torah is not altered to fit individual viewpoints. While there will be enlightening responses that provide positive insights, it's important to acknowledge that not all answers may be pleasant.</p>\n<p>In the realm of Kabbalah, the Ramchal, a renowned mystic who authored numerous books, delved into the concept of gilgul neshamot (the reincarnation of souls) in Chapter 106 of his work, \"Sha'arei Ramchal.\" A friend who has extensively studied the subject shared with me his learning on this chapter. According to the Ramchal, the progression of souls has undergone various stages. Initially, each person received a new soul, followed by the idea of gilgulim, where the soul returns in a different body to rectify past transgressions. In our present time, the souls have become fragmented and comprise parts of many thousands of different souls that unite to form a complete soul. By performing sufficient mitzvot (good deeds) in our lives, the fragments can attach to a pure soul and partake in the spiritual connection known as the Shechina. However, failing to do so results in our souls fragmenting into numerous shards to be reused once again. This perspective may appear disheartening.</p>\n<p>I will include a relevant excerpt from the Ramchal's work at the end. It becomes evident from his teachings that unless a couple manages to perfect themselves and align with a spiritually \"good\" soul...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ed3NK.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Ed3NK.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

Genesis 17:17, Here is the Hebrew with an English translation (translated from the original German by Chat GPT)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכחישה שצחקה, וה' לא היה גוער בה. \"צחק\", \"שׂחק\", \"צעק\", \"זעק\", \"שאג\"\nהם שרשים קרובים, אך הם מציינים לכאורה דברים הפוכים. השורשים שהאות\nהאמצעית שלהם היא ע' או א' – מציינים צעקה, ואילו אותם שהאות האמצעית\nשלהם היא ח' – מציינים צחוק. מהו הבסיס המשותף לשתי התופעות השונות האלה\n(צעקה וצחוק)? שתיהן מתעוררות כשנפגשים הפכים מנוגדים שאין כל שייכות\nביניהם: מנקודת מבט עניינית [אובייקטיבית] מתעורר אז \"צחוק\"; וכשנוגע\nהדבר למישהו באופן אישי מתעוררת \"צעקה\". הבחנה בסתירה פנימית ובאי־התאמה\nבדבר שאינו קשור אלינו – אף אם הניתוק הוא זמני בלבד – גורמת לנו לצחוק;\nאך אם אי ההתאמה פוגע בנו אישית, או פוגע במי שאנו חשים כלפיו קירבה\nרגשית ומשתתפים בשמחתו ובצערו, הרי שאנו צועקים. ילד קטן החובש פאה\nנכרית, זקן שיש עליו חיתול כתינוק, וכדומה, מביאים לצחוק; וכן גם המרחק\nהגדול שבין ציפייה, תפקיד, או ביצוע, לבין האמצעים העומדים לשם כך; או\nהמרחק שבין התוצאות המצופות ובין מה שנוכל לעשות בפועל. הבא למדוד את מי\nהים בכף ידו, או אדם מבוגר המוֹעֵד ונופל, גורם לנו לצחוק; אך אם יש לנו\nקירבה עם אותו אדם ואנו משתתפים בצערו או בושתו, אנו חשים בצורך לצעוק.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאג (shout), זעק (cry out), צעק (scream), שחק (laugh), צחק (laughter),\nare evidently related roots in terms of sound, yet they seemingly mean\nopposite things; those with the middle letter ע and א: to shout, with\nח: to laugh. What is the common basic concept behind these seemingly\ncompletely different phenomena? Both are caused by perceived or felt\ncontrasts, that is, improperly paired opposites; objectively, this\nproduces laughter, subjectively: screaming. Perceiving such a contrast\nin an object that is foreign to us or temporarily foreign evokes\nlaughter; a more fitting contrast that involves ourselves or a\npersonality identified with ourselves makes us scream. A small child\nwith a wig, an elderly person as a baby, etc., generates laughter.\nSimilarly, the complete disproportion, the complete mismatch between\nan expectation, an endeavor, or an execution, and the means or between\nan execution and the expectation. Trying to empty the sea with\nnutshell cups or, conversely, the stumbling of an adult when our\nempathy does not identify us with their harm or embarrassment, in\nwhich case we would scream, etc., etc. (Even שחק, the cheerful\nlaughter, is only caused by the realization of an overcome contrast,\nan unexpectedly successful outcome, etc., etc. Even שחק, which occurs\nin the context of competitions, gymnastic exercises, and music, seems\nto stem from the joy of successfully overcoming opposing difficulties,\nthus offering a striking similarity to the other common expression for\nmusical virtuosity: נַצֵח).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While the letters זיין and צדי can be interchangeable phonetically and each shoresh essentially means a shouting, the nature of the shout can vary.</p>\n<p><strong>In the two cases mentioned above</strong> the Targum Onkelos in Shemos and the Targum on the Megilla each indicate that the shouts of <strong>Moshe</strong> and <strong>Mordechai</strong> had a purpose of <strong>tefila/prayer</strong> (a lashon of צלי).</p>\n<p>Used elsewhere it can appears with a number of meanings.</p>\n<p>The shoresh צעק is prevalent in the Chumash.  Targum Onkelos indicates multiple shades of meaning for this word: as <strong>צלי</strong> = prayer, <strong>צוח</strong> = scream, <strong>קבל</strong> = complaint, and ironically in one instance, <strong>זעק</strong>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1oVe2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1oVe2.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>On the other hand the shoresh for זעק appears only twice in the Chumash but many times elsewhere - In the Chumash, Targum Onkelos identifies each instance with shouts of complaint or anguish:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(בראשית יח:כ) וַיֹּאמֶר ה' <strong>זַעֲקַת</strong> סְדֹם וַעֲמֹרָה כִּי רָבָּה\nוְחַטָּאתָם כִּי כָבְדָה מְאֹד</p>\n<p>וַאֲמַר יְיָ <strong>קְבִילַת</strong> סְדוֹם וַעֲמוֹרָה אֲרֵי סְגִיאַת וְחוֹבַתְהוֹן אֲרֵי תְּקֵיפַת לַחְדָּא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(שמות ב:כג) וַיְהִי בַיָּמִים הָרַבִּים הָהֵם וַיָּמׇת מֶלֶךְ\nמִצְרַיִם וַיֵּאָנְחוּ בְנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מִן הָעֲבֹדָה <strong>וַיִּזְעָקוּ</strong>\nוַתַּעַל שַׁוְעָתָם אֶל הָאֱלֹהִים מִן הָעֲבֹדָה</p>\n<p>וַהֲוָה בְּיוֹמַיָּא סַגִּיאַיָּא הָאִנּוּן וּמִית מַלְכָּא דְּמִצְרַיִם וְאִתְאָנַחוּ בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל מִן פּוּלְחָנָא דַּהֲוָה קְשֵׁי עֲלֵיהוֹן <strong>וּזְעִיקוּ</strong> וּסְלֵיקַת <strong>קְבִילַתְהוֹן</strong> לִקְדָם יְיָ מִן פּוּלְחָנָא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>sometimes זעק is a shout to gather people together as in</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(יהושע ח:טז) <strong>וַיִּזָּעֲקוּ</strong> כׇּל הָעָם אֲשֶׁר בָּעַי לִרְדֹּף\nאַחֲרֵיהֶם</p>\n<p><strong>וְאִתְכְּנִישׁוּ</strong> כָּל עַמָא דִי בְקַרְתָּא בָּעַי לְמִרְדַף בַּתְרֵיהוֹן (תרגום יונתן)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere it can have some of the meanings listed above for צעק.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Tofel and Ikar - In the case of a mixture of Tofel and Ikar, what happens if some spoonfuls are just Tofel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have just done some learning on this and a question I didn't see answered was the following case:</p>\n<p>One has a mixture of food, let's say a stew. They decided that the Ikar was the meat, and the carrots are Tofel (e.g. following the halacha in Yalkut Yosef 212:17, the carrots are just there to enhance the flavour of the meat), so they said <em>shehakol</em>. This therefore covers all of the vegetables as well according to the laws of Tofel and Ikar (see Yalkut Yosef 212, Shulchan Aruch O.C 212).</p>\n<p>What happens if at various points during the dining, the person eating is going to be eating the vegetables by themselves a lot?</p>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: the person sticks fork into a pile and pulls out just a carrot and eats it.<br />\n<strong>Example</strong>: the person deliberately makes up some spoonfuls composed of just carrots.<br />\n<strong>Example</strong>: the person finishes all the meat quickly, and now has just a (not tiny) quantity of carrots left, which he proceeds to eat.</p>\n<p>In any of these cases or similar, does one need to make a <em>boreh peri ha'adama</em> on the vegetables?</p>\n<p>I would guess from YY 212:18, 19 and especially 20, that this person should probably say <em>boreh peri ha'adama</em> from the start on the carrots, and it is not a <em>beracha she'en tzericha</em>, but given the wording, I am not sure. That conclusion is also questionable because it seems like Tofel and Ikar is quite a fragile halacha, i.e. some of the places where I see it applied such as 212:17 itself might fall under scrutiny if we say that he should bless on the carrots here... If every time I have a mixture of foods I separate out everything and make individual <em>berachot</em>, what is the point of Tofel V'Ikar, aside from the very different cases like condiments and cheese on crackers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The first two examples you mentioned, are discussed by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.212.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan 212:2</a> where he differentiates if it so happened that a spoonful came out with only one of them, or if you deliberately picked out a spoonful of the taful to eat it separately</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאין זו שאלה, דבטפילה המעורבת לא שייך עיקר וטפל אלא כשאוכלם ביחד, כמו כשמבשלים גרויפי\"ן עם קטניות או עם תפוחי אדמה שלוקחין בכף אחת זה וזה, ואז אפילו אם אינו נלקח בכף רק מין אחד גם כן הוי טפל. אבל הבשר אוכלין בפני עצמו או קודם התבשיל או אחר כך, אין זה עיקר וטפל. והוא הדין אם ליקט התפוחי אדמה מתוך התבשיל ואוכלן בפני עצמם - מברך עליהם 'בורא פרי האדמה' אם התבשיל ברכתו 'מזונות' או 'שהכל', וכן להיפך בבשר כשחתכן לחתיכות קטנות ואוכלן ביחד עם התבשיל - נעשים בטילים וטפלים להתבשיל וכיוצא בזה בכל הדברים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The third example you mentioned, when the taful is left over by itself, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.168.46?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">MB 168:46</a> says that would not require a bracha since it is still considered part of the ikar</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מו פוטרתן - ואם אכל המרקחת מלמעלה והשאיר הרקיקין ואכלן בפני עצמן צריך לברך במ\"מ עליהם אך אם אכלן ביחד ונשאר עוד קצת רקיק בלא מרקחת אין צריך לברך עליו כיון דעיקר אכילתו היה ביחד ונחשב לטפל להמרקחת אין חוששין על גמר האכילה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are Obligations of teachers to their students\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What are the obligations of a teacher of the Torah to his students. Or what are the laws that a teacher, rebbe, Rav must follow.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One such obligation is to go very easy with corporal punishment.</p>\n<p>In the Talmud, Rav ordered Shmuel ben Shilat to deal tenderly with students, to refrain from corporal punishment, or at most to use a shoe-strap in correcting pupils for inattention. He added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if a student does not pay attention, put him next to a diligent student.<br />\n[Bava Batra 21a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there is no blanket ban on hitting one’s child, Jewish law over the centuries has substantially reduced its practice.  The Shulḥan Arukh severely limits instances when a teacher can hit a student. [Shulḥan Arukh, Yoreh Deah, Hilchot Melamdim, Siman 245:10]  It also says that a parent should not be too demanding of his child [240:19] and must not hit his adult child [240:20].</p>\n<p>The Ritva recommends that a parent verbally reprimand rather than hit. [Ritva on Moed Katan 17a] The Meiri calls for dismissing teachers who hit students [Meiri on Bava Batra 21a].  He even calls this abuse a <em>peshia</em>, or “major offense”. Contemporary Rabbi Rabinovitz states that a parent or teacher who hits out of anger, and not for educational purposes, or who hits his child harshly even for educational purposes has sinned, and one is required by Jewish law to report him to the police. [Sefer Halacha u'Refuah 1, p. 336]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here's a few...</p>\n<h2><strong>1) A teacher must be a ירא שמים</strong></h2>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.17a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moed Katan 17a</a> writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"א\"ל הכי א\"ר יוחנן מאי דכתיב כי שפתי כהן ישמרו דעת ותורה יבקשו מפיהו כי מלאך ה' צבאות הוא אם דומה הרב למלאך ה' יבקשו תורה מפיו ואם לאו אל יבקשו תורה מפיו\"</p>\n<p>“He said to him, so says R’ Yochanan: What does the following text mean; “For the lips of the Kohen should safeguard knowledge, and people should seek to ask (i.e. learn) from his mouth for he is an angel of Hashem, Master of Legions”, (it means, that) if a Rebbi is like an angel of Hashem he should seek Torah from his mouth, and if not, he should not seek Torah from his mouth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This chazal would appear to be slightly cryptic. How is it possible for a Rebbi to be on the level of an angel? Surely it is impossible for a man that is essentially ‘earthly’ in form, to draw parallels with a celestially-rooted malach? The answer is that just as a malach has no personal aspirations but rather is driven purely to satisfy the will of Hashem, so too a Rebbi must be focused entirely on fuelling the success of his talmidim.<sup>1</sup> Thus, a Rebbi must be consistent with his appointed title. This means that he must not be deficient in the traits necessary for a mechanech. If a teacher is lacking in his level of observance, character or learning it will serve to hamper his personal example. Failure to be a true role model will abjectly impact on his students. The fact that we liken our Rebbeim to angels is a testament to the high regard with which we view them. They serve to mould and fashion our children into ovdei Hashem, and for this alone, we must endeavour to ensure that our children receive the correct level of teaching. Indeed, Rabbi Moshe Shternbach shlita notes that one must be quick to ascertain that their children have a Rebbe who is a yarei shamayim and this means seeing him with your own eyes to verify if he will provide a good example.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>2) Conclusive Explanations</strong></h2>\n<p>A teacher must always endeavour, providing it is relevant, to try to fully explain the topic being taught. To merely shrug questions off, will leave students frustrated and may even teach them that it is not worthwhile exploring a matter further. Obviously, there is not always time to answer every question, and the questioning may indeed deviate from the subject, but a teacher should never completely avoid answering, and must try to make time to quench the ever insatiable curiosity of children.</p>\n<p>This matter is expressed quite clearly in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54b.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eiruvin 54b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ר\"ע אומר מניין שחייב אדם לשנות לתלמידו עד שילמדנו שנאמר ולמדה את בני ישראל ומניין עד שתהא סדורה בפיהם שנאמר שימה בפיהם ומניין שחייב להראות לו פנים שנאמר ואלה המשפטים אשר תשים לפניהם\"</p>\n<p>“Rabbi Akiva says, from where do we know that a person is obligated to teach his students until he has mastered the subject? Since it says, ‘And teach it to the Children of Israel’. And from where do we know that it must be taught until he is well versed in it? Since it says, ‘Put in their mouths’. And from where do we know that a person is obligated to explain to him the reasons? As it says, ‘Now these are the ordinances that you shall place before them’.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This demonstrates that it is crucial for Rebbes / mechanchim to go to great lengths to ensure that their students understand what they have been learning. It is not enough to gloss over something and to be concerned with covering ground above and beyond one’s student’s overall clarity of the topic. Patience when teaching, and providing comprehensive explanations is in fact supported in Halach. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.246.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, YD 246:10</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"הרב שלימד ולא הבינו התלמידים לא יכעוס עליהם אלא שונה וחוזר הדבר כמה פעמים עד שיבינו עומק ההלכה\"</p>\n<p>“A Rov who teaches and his students do not understand, he should not get angry with them, rather he should teach and return to the matter many times until they understand the depth of the law.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Baruch HaLevi Epstein zt\"l in his Torah Temimah further reiterates this point. Looking at the opening line of parshas Mishpatim (which is quoted the above stated gemara), the verse concludes \"אשר תשים לפניהם\" – “that you shall place before them”.  He understands this to mean that a teacher must fully provide reasons for everything that he says. He should not explain something as being merely due to the fact that it is a fixed law, and must never respond, “This is how I heard it, now understand it on your own!”<sup>3</sup> Whilst there are occasions when a teacher should encourage his students to seek the answer, he should in no way leave them without any sort of guidance. Ultimately, a מחנך should try to present the subject material in a clear and well-structured way. The מכילתא on the same פסוק elucidates this point, commenting, \"הלשון ערכם לפניהם כשלחן ערוך\" – “Spread out (the teaching) before them like a set table.”<sup>4</sup></p>\n<h2><strong>1) Accurate teaching materials</strong></h2>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.112a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 112a</a> relates how Rabbi Akiva taught Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai five things during the former’s incarceration. One of these points of advice was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וכשאתה מלמד את בנך למדהו בספר מוגה מאי היא אמר רבא ואיתימא רב משרשיא בחדתא שבשתא כיון דעל דעל\"</p>\n<p>“And when you teach your son, teach from a corrected book. What is this? Rava says, and some say it was in fact Rav Mesharsheya that it refers to a new book, since once an error has entered, it remains.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This chazal provides a very important message for parents and teachers alike. One must take pains to ensure that information be relayed in an accurate fashion. When incorrect facts are communicated, it is very hard to later rectify them. As has been mentioned on a number of occasions, the minds of children are particularly incisive, and so it is in their youth that one must take advantage of this mental astuteness. The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.21b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 21b</a> states, “נפקא מינה לגירסא דינקותא” – “The practical difference is: that which one learns when he is young is not easily forgotten”.

    "content": "# Gezeira Shava - They were taught the word? or the verse?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a semi famous idea regarding <em>gezeira shava</em>s (learning one law to another context through the use of parallel language in both locations), that <em>Chazal</em> had a tradition for which words to use but they didn't necessarily know which verse. This is why there exists disputes all over <em>Shas</em> which verses to use.</p>\n<p>This idea is expressed by Rashi</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רש\"י מסכת קידושין דף יז עמוד א ד\"ה מיכה מיכה</p>\n<p>אין אדם דן ג\"ש מעצמו ומסורה היא להם מרבותיהם ומסיני איזו תיבה נכתבה לג\"ש ככל דבר הלמד מחבירו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and Ramban</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>השגות הרמב\"ן לספר המצוות לרמב\"ם שורש ב\nוהוי יודע שזה שאמרו חכמים שאין אדם דן גזירה שוה מעצמו אין כונתם לומר שכל גזירה שוה מבוארת להם מסיני ונמסרת להם מפי משה רבינו תלמדו מלה פלונית שבפסוק פלוני ממלה פלונית שבפסוק פלוני ותשוו דין שניהם לענין פלוני. אין הדבר כן. שהרי מצינו אותם חולקין תמיד בהרבה מקומות בענין הזה...‏</p>\n<p>אבל הכוונה בגזירה שוה שהיא מסיני לומר שהיא בידם קבלה שדין שחיטה שאינה ראויה נלמד מגזירה שוה דשחיטה שחיטה והיתה סברתו שלרבי מאיר שהנכון ללמוד אותה משחוטי חוץ ויהיה שמה שחיטה ור' שמעון ראה בדעתו שיותר נכון ללמוד אותה מן וטבוח טבח והכן ולא תהיה שחיטה שאינה ראויה נדונת כשחיטה. וכן כולם. ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and Halichos Olam (by Rav Yeshua ben Yosef, 15th century)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הליכות עולם שער רביעי פרק ב אות טז</p>\n<p>ואם תאמר א\"כ דכל גזירה שוה מקובלת מסיני מה ניתן לנו לדרוש, ועוד בכוליה גמרא פריך מאי חזית דגמרת ממלה פלונית לגמור ממלה פלונית ומאי פריך והא אמרת אין אדם דן גזירה שוה מעצמו וכו'. ועתה דע והבן שרשו של דבר, דכל גזרות שוות נמסרו למשה מסיני סתם ומסרן הכתוב לחכמים איזו גזירה שוה נדון אלא שלא נמסרו בשוה ...ופעמים נאמרו התיבות סתם מלה פלונית תלמוד ממלה פלונית כגון טומאתו טומאתו לגזירה שוה פרק קמא דשבועות ולא נמסרו המקומות והחכמים מבקשים מנוח לתיבות אשר ייטב להם לדורשם בהם. זהו העיקר שעליו סובבת כל הגזירה שוה שבגמרא:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I always assumed that this is <strong>exactly what Moshe was given at Sinai</strong>. A list of words. However, I see the Chavos Yair argues that that's impossible, and says for sure Moshe had absolute clarity which verses, and he taught it to the people. Which verse to use is included in the list of things that were forgotten when Moshe died (Temurah 16b, he cites this earlier in the responsa).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שו\"ת חוות יאיר סימן קצב אות ע\"ג</p>\n<p>לימודים הנלמדים מי\"ג מידות הם מסיני כמ\"ש וא\"כ לא שייך בהם שכחה והרי התלמוד מלא במחלוקת בהם והרי ג\"ש שלכ\"ע צריך שיהיה ללומד בקבלה עד מרע\"ה ובלי ספק שמרע\"ה ביאר הג\"ש ביאור היטיב והרי נחלקו בה [על\"ק דקפ\"ו ע\"א] מהיכן יליף ג\"ש אם מדבר פלוני או מדבר אחר שע\"כ כתבו שלפעמים היו מקובלים המלות לבד לא המקומות ולפעמים בהיפך וזה בא ע\"י שכחות המלות או המקומות כי חלילה לומר כי קבלת מרע\"ה מסיני או מסירתו ליהושוע היה חסר הבנה ואפילו האומר כל התורה מן השמים חוץ מק\"ו זה ה\"ז אפיקור‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramban himself also seems to entertain this</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>השגות הרמב\"ן לספר המצוות לרמב\"ם שורש ב</p>\n<p>ואומר בשמא כי זה מכלל מה שנשתכח באבלו שלמשה בגזירות שוות </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However. the wording of the Halichos Olam seems to preclude this, as he says that Moshe was taught the words, and it's up to the <em>Chachamim</em> to figure it out (that's what נדרשת בהן means). Also the Chasam Sofer al HaTorah (Vayikra 22:32) understands this principle this way (otherwise his whole <em>shtickle</em> there makes no sense).</p>\n<p>Now, after all this background info, I have a question on the Chavos Yair (and I guess the Ramban). If the verses were given to Moshe at Sinai, how could that be? There are <em>gezeira shavas</em> from verses in Vayikra, Bamidbar, Devarim, regarding events that didn't occur yet. For example, תוך תוך, for אין דברים שבקדושה פחות מעשרה, is learned out from Korach (הבדלו מתוך העדה הזאת). How can we say that Moshe knew that Korach would have a rebellion? This is a question people ask how Moshe got the whole Torah at Sinai, when it takes away free will, and the answer is he received the laws but not the verses (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/2181/1739\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/59958/1739\">here</a>). According to this, he did receive at least some verses!</p>\n<p>What am I missing? This seems like an obvious question...</p>\n\n\n",

Do we really believe they contain “sparks of Judaism,” as if, in them?</em></p>\n<p>Evidently Rabbi Nachman thought so, though to find those sparks, preliminary research into the original, true form of the tale was necessary, as well as being very familiar with Kabbalistic terminology. I don't know if everyone thinks so, but Rabbi Nachman's position is very much in line with the general Chassidic position of borrowing cultural materials from non-Jews and \"kosherizing\" them. Take, for example, niggunim such as <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/music_cdo/aid/254254/jewish/Hupp-Cossack.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hupp Cossack</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/music_cdo/aid/140724/jewish/Shamil.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niggun Shamil</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I remember reading a similar idea in the translator's introduction to \"Rabbi Nachman's Stories,\" translated by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan.</p>\n<p>He said that, according to Rabbi Nachman, all these folk tales are based on deep truths, except they've become distorted.</p>\n<p>It was a long time ago when I read it, and I don't have this book. But if I remember correctly, it was heavily foot-noted. I don't want to send you on a wild goose chase, but there's a chance it might have the exact answer you're looking.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Correct way to apologise\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As I've grown older, I've started to find the phrase \"please forgive me\" to be a little bit distasteful. It has a big fat \"me\" in it, and (especially when it is ritualised) it can easily convey the impression that one isn't genuinely regretful in the victim's suffering, just regretful that now one is \"in trouble\" for \"having done something wrong\" so they better get the victim to forgive them otherwise they will go to gehinom.</p>\n<p>Of course, it doesn't have to mean this. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k2k3ooIfQy0&t=649s&ab_channel=RabbiManisFriedman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The way forgiveness generally works</a> is when we see someone humble themself and apologise and seek to reconnect, it allows our compassion to overcome our sense of justice (\"I am precious and he hurt me, he deserves to be punished\"), and that opens the door to us considering that our oppressor is also someone precious, and shouldn't be held to a standard we don't hold ourselves to, and perhaps we might even have deserved it a little.. and then forgiveness can come.</p>\n<p>So, \"please forgive me\" can mean \"I miss your friendship, I miss you, and until you forgive me, I can't have that so please forgive me\", which is a wonderful and beyond-reproachful thing to say (it's a big compliment to anyone imo), plus it is an implied apology, which is enough to ignite our compassion.</p>\n<p>Still, I would like to seek what Chazal meant <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.87a.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">when they instituted</a> this phraseology, <em>forgive me</em>. It's very interesting to note that nobody ever apologises to anyone else in Torah in the way we do (except to Hashem) - neither \"forgive me\" or \"I am sorry\" - and <a href=\"https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/no-apologies-just-a-kiss/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this is a very interesting article</a> with a theory about why that is*. It would be nice to hear answers sourced in tradition as to why that is and how the minhag developed to ask for forgiveness.</p>\n<p><strong>So basically my question is, why do we place the focus of apologising on \"forgive <em>me</em>\", and not simply \"I'm so sorry for what I did\"? The latter sounds much more authentic and appropriate to anyone striving to be other-centric, and to be genuinely concerned for the preciousness and wellbeing of his fellow. Are there any sources that discuss this, and particularly any that raise my point here?</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* It states, along with deals with a few cases such as Joseph and the brothers, Avshalom and David, Jacob and Esav etc.:</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup>There are simply no stories anywhere in the Bible – using any terms –\nwhere one person expresses remorse to another, and that person, in\nturn, accepts the gesture and expresses forgiveness.</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Recently I have experiences several of my classmates 'come out' as being part of this group (either being gay, or bisexual). Over the past few years many people that have been otherwise halachically observant I know have become much more lenient and accepting of this, with some of them ever becoming very close friends with these people, and some even embracing homosexuality, and have started to take the approach that homosexuality as well as LGBT+ are not a matter of choice, and is instead something people cannot change or help.\nMy question is this: Are they in the wrong by being more tolerant of these people despite clear halachic prohibitions over homosexuality, and is it allowed to be close friends with people who are part of the LGBT+ community?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The answer is no, they are not wrong by being friendly towards Jews who happen to be gay. It is a <strong>Mitzvah</strong> to <strong>\"love thy neighbour, as yourself\"</strong>. Furthermore, homosexuality in and of itself is not prohibited by halacha. People who are gay are human beings and deserve the same respect you would expect for yourself.</p>\n<p>So Yes, you absolutely can be friends with this person.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/57104.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/57104.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>Originally Published: July, 2010/ Menachem Av, 5770</p>\n<p>For the last six months a number of Orthodox rabbis and educators have been preparing a statement of principles on the place of our brothers and sisters in our community who have a homosexual orientation.</p>\n<p>The original draft was prepared by Rabbi Nathaniel Helfgot. It was then commented upon by and revised based on the input from dozens of talmidei chachamim, educators, communal rabbis, mental health professionals and a number of individuals in our community who are homosexual in orientation.Significant revisions were made based upon the input of Rabbi Aryeh Klapper and Rabbi Yitzchak Blau who were intimately involved in the process of editing and improving the document during the last three months.</p>\n<p>The statement below is a consensus document arrived at after hundreds of hours of discussion,debate and editing.</p>\n<p><strong>Statement of Principles on the Place of Jews with a Homosexual Orientation in Our Community</strong></p>\n<p>We, the undersigned Orthodox rabbis, rashei yeshiva, ramim, Jewish educators and communal leaders affirm the following principles with regard to the place of Jews with a homosexual orientation in our community:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>All human beings are created in the image of God and deserve to be treated with dignity and respect (kevod haberiyot). Every Jew is obligated to fulfill the entire range of mitzvot between person and person in relation to persons who are homosexual or have feelings of same sex attraction. Embarrassing, harassing or demeaning someone with a homosexual orientation or same-sex attraction is a violation of Torah prohibitions that embody the deepest values of Judaism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The question of whether sexual orientation is primarily genetic, or rather environmentally generated, is irrelevant to our obligation to treat human beings with same-sex attractions and orientations with dignity and respect.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Halakhah sees heterosexual marriage as the ideal model and sole legitimate outlet for human sexual expression. The sensitivity and understanding we properly express for human beings with other sexual orientations does not diminish our commitment to that principle.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Halakhic Judaism views all male and female same-sex sexual interactions as prohibited. The question of whether sexual orientation is primarily genetic, or rather environmentally generated, is irrelevant to this prohibition. While halakha categorizes various homosexual acts with different degrees of severity and opprobrium, including toeivah, this does not in any way imply that lesser acts are permitted. But it is critical to emphasize that halakha only prohibits homosexual acts; it does not prohibit orientation or feelings of same-sex attraction, and nothing in the Torah devalues the human beings who struggle with them. (We do not here address the issue of hirhurei aveirah, a halakhic category that goes beyond mere feelings and applies to all forms of sexuality and requires precise halakhic definition.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Whatever the origin or cause of homosexual orientation, many individuals believe that for most people this orientation cannot be changed. Others believe that for most people it is a matter of free will. Similarly, while some mental health professionals and rabbis in the community strongly believe in the efficacy of “change therapies”, most of the mental health community, many rabbis, and most people with a homosexual orientation feel that some of these therapies are either ineffective or potentially damaging psychologically for many patients. We affirm the religious right of those with a homosexual orientation to reject therapeutic approaches they reasonably see as useless or dangerous.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Jews with a homosexual orientation who live in the Orthodox community confront serious emotional, communal and psychological challenges that cause them and their families great pain and suffering. For example, homosexual orientation may greatly increase the risk of suicide among teenagers in our community. Rabbis and communities need to be sensitive and empathetic to that reality. Rabbis and mental health professionals must provide responsible and ethical assistance to congregants and clients dealing with those human challenges.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Jews struggling to live their lives in accordance with halakhic values need and deserve our support. Accordingly, we believe that the decision as to whether to be open about one's sexual orientation should be left to such individuals, who should consider their own needs and those of the community. We are opposed on ethical and moral grounds to both the “outing” of individuals who want to remain private and to coercing those who desire to be open about their orientation to keep it hidden.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Accordingly, Jews with homosexual orientations or same sex-attractions should be welcomed as full members of the synagogue and school community. As appropriate with regard to gender and lineage, they should participate and count ritually, be eligible for ritual synagogue honors, and generally be treated in the same fashion and under the same halakhic and hashkafic framework as any other member of the synagogue they join. Conversely, they must accept and fulfill all the responsibilities of such membership, including those generated by communal norms or broad Jewish principles that go beyond formal halakha. We do not here address what synagogues should do about accepting members who are openly practicing homosexuals and/or living with a same-sex partner. Each synagogue together with its rabbi must establish its own standard with regard to membership for open violators of halakha. Those standards should be applied fairly and objectively.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Halakha articulates very exacting criteria and standards of eligibility for particular religious offices, such as officially appointed cantor during the year or baal tefillah on the High Holidays. Among the most important of those criteria is that the entire congregation must be fully comfortable with having that person serve as its representative. This legitimately prevents even the most admirable individuals, who are otherwise perfectly fit halakhically, from serving in those roles. It is the responsibility of the lay and rabbinic leadership in each individual community to determine eligibility for those offices in line with those principles, the importance of maintaining communal harmony, and the unique context of its community culture.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Jews with a homosexual orientation or same sex attraction, even if they engage in same sex interactions, should be encouraged to fulfill mitzvot to the best of their ability. All Jews are challenged to fulfill mitzvot to the best of their ability, and the attitude of “all or nothing” was not the traditional approach adopted by the majority of halakhic thinkers and poskim throughout the ages.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Halakhic Judaism cannot give its blessing and imprimatur to Jewish religious same-sex commitment ceremonies and weddings, and halakhic values proscribe individuals and communities from encouraging practices that grant religious legitimacy to gay marriage and couplehood. But communities should display sensitivity, acceptance and full embrace of the adopted or biological children of homosexually active Jews in the synagogue and school setting, and we encourage parents and family of homosexually partnered Jews to make every effort to maintain harmonious family relations and connections.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Jews who have an exclusively homosexual orientation should, under most circumstances, not be encouraged to marry someone of the other gender, as this can lead to great tragedy, unrequited love, shame, dishonesty and ruined lives. They should be directed to contribute to Jewish and general society in other meaningful ways. Any such person who is planning to marry someone of the opposite gender is halakhically and ethically required to fully inform his or her potential spouse of their sexual orientation. We hope and pray that by sharing these thoughts we will help the Orthodox community to fully live out its commitment to the principles and values of Torah and Halakha as practiced and cherished by the children of Abraham, who our sages teach us are recognized by the qualities of being rahamanim (merciful), bayshanim (modest), and gomelei hasadim engaging in acts of loving-kindness).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It would seem that aside from the issue of being influenced by your surroundings, the other issue with being friends with them would be “machzik yedei ovrei aveira”.

    "content": "# Confused about the proper punishment for lesbianism since num. '40' is often symbolic & the use of the word \"brother\" (אָחִ֖יךָ) for a woman is odd?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Rambam, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960669/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twenty-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">H. Issure Biah 21:8</a>, he states that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נָשִׁים הַמְסוֹלָלוֹת זוֹ בָּזוֹ אָסוּר וּמִמַּעֲשֵׂה מִצְרַיִם הוּא שֶׁהֻזְהַרְנוּ עָלָיו שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ויקרא יח ג) \"כְּמַעֲשֵׂה אֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם לֹא תַעֲשׂוּ\". אָמְרוּ חֲכָמִים מֶה הָיוּ עוֹשִׂים אִישׁ נוֹשֵׂא אִישׁ וְאִשָּׁה נוֹשֵׂא אִשָּׁה. וְאִשָּׁה נִשֵּׂאת לִשְׁנֵי אֲנָשִׁים. אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁמַּעֲשֶׂה זֶה אָסוּר אֵין מַלְקִין עָלָיו. שֶׁאֵין לוֹ לָאו מְיֻחָד וַהֲרֵי אֵין שָׁם בִּיאָה כְּלָל. לְפִיכָךְ אֵין נֶאֱסָרוֹת לִכְהֻנָּה מִשּׁוּם זְנוּת וְלֹא תֵּאָסֵר אִשָּׁה עַל בַּעְלָהּ בָּזֶה שֶׁאֵין כָּאן זְנוּת. וְרָאוּי לְהַכּוֹתָן מַכַּת מַרְדּוּת הוֹאִיל וְעָשׂוּ אִסּוּר. וְיֵשׁ לָאִישׁ לְהַקְפִּיד עַל אִשְׁתּוֹ מִדָּבָר זֶה וּמוֹנֵעַ הַנָּשִׁים הַיְדוּעוֹת בְּכָךְ מִלְּהִכָּנֵס לָהּ וּמִלָּצֵאת הִיא אֲלֵיהֶן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Lesbian relations are forbidden. This is \"the conduct of Egypt\" which we were warned against, as [Leviticus 18:3] states: \"Do not follow the conduct of Egypt.\" Our Sages said: What would they do? A man would marry a man, a woman would marry a woman, and a woman would marry two men.. Although this conduct is forbidden, lashes are not given for it, for it is not a specific prohibition and there is no intercourse at all. Therefore such women are not forbidden to marry into the priesthood as zonot, nor does a woman become prohibited to her husband because of this, for this is not considered harlotry. It is, however, appropriate to give them stripes for rebellious conduct because they performed a transgression. A man should take precautions with his wife with regard to this matter and should prevent women who are known to engage in such practices from visiting her and her from visiting them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, according to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/131097/lesbianism-would-be-prohibited-based-on-what-principle\">an answer to this post</a> on the Judaism StackExchange, Rambam is echoing the earlier statements found in the Sifra and Talmud. For instance, Sifra, Ahare Moth 8:8 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כמעשה ארץ מצרים וכמעשה ארץ כנען לא תעשו\", יכול לא יבנו בנינים ולא יטעו נטיעות כמותם? תלמוד לומר \"ובחוקותיהם לא תלכו\" – לא אמרתי אלא בחוקים החקוקים להם ולאבותיהם ולאבות אבותיהם. ומה היו עושים? האיש נושא לאיש והאשה לאשה. האיש נושא אשה ובתה, והאשה נישאת לשנים. לכך נאמר \"ובחוקותיהם לא תלכו\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As the deed of the land of Egypt and as the deed of the land of Canaan, you shall not do,\" I might think they should not build or plant as they do; it is, therefore, written (Joshua 11:15) \"and in their statutes you shall not walk.\" I have proscribed for you only those statutes which were instituted for them and for their forefathers and for the fathers of their forefathers. What did they do? A man would wed a man, and a woman, a woman. A man would wed a woman and her daughter, and a woman would wed two — wherefore Scripture states \"and in their statutes you shall not walk.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So taking this into account, Rambam states that it is appropriate to give them stripes for rebellious conduct. Then, I went to research again the concept of giving stripes, and according to the <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14083-stripes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Encyclopedia article</a> wrriten by a counselor Lewis N. Dembitz, D.H.L. and a Jewish scholar, professor and theologian, Dr. Wilhelm Bacher, Ph.D., stripes as a corporal punishment may not be inflicted more than 40 times for a punishment. This comes directly from <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0525.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 25:3</a> which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַרְבָּעִ֥ים יַכֶּ֖נּוּ לֹ֣א יֹסִ֑יף פֶּן־יֹסִ֨יף לְהַכֹּת֤וֹ עַל־אֵ֙לֶּה֙ מַכָּ֣ה רַבָּ֔ה וְנִקְלָ֥ה אָחִ֖יךָ לְעֵינֶֽיךָ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but the judge must not impose more than forty lashes. If the guilty party is flogged more than that, your fellow Israelite will be degraded in your eyes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this, the question then becomes: since the word used here means essentially \"brother\" (<a href=\"https://biblehub.com/text/deuteronomy/25-3.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אָחִ֖יךָ</a>), which seems to be used <a href=\"https://biblehub.com/hebrew/achicha_251.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mainly in masculine contexts</a> (although some translations use the word <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"peer\", instead of \"brother\"</a> which is a little strange given that according to the <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9A\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wiktionary</a>, the word being used here is a singular form of אָח‎ (ách)‎ with second-person masculine singular personal pronoun as possessor), how appropriate is it to prescribe such a punishment to a woman (also taking into account that Rambam previously seemed to have believed in his Commentary to the Mishnah (Sanhedrin 7:3) that even according to Rabbinic Law, no punishment should be given? Additionally, since the <a href=\"http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2010/08/the-biblical-expression-40-days-and-40-nights-just-means-a-really-long-time/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">number 40 is a commonly used cultural idiom throughout the Ancient Near East</a>, and was certainly in use when the Deuteronomy was written down, does the number 40 in this context for this punishment, refer to a really long time period i.e. they are to be given stripes for a very long time period so don't go beyond a very long time or you may lose respect for them, or is it specifically 40 stripes in a more literal way? I know that in the Talmud, the number has been <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/flogging\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reduced to 39 stripes as the maximum just in case so that no one goes above the limit (Mak. 22a)</a>, but it doesn't conclusively indicate that 40 stripes wasn't metaphorical and the actual theoretical limit could potentially be higher in my view.</p>\n<p>All in all, I'm generally confused as to what the punishment for lesbianism is now, because of the word \"brother\" being used when stripes are to be given and also the length/quantity of the punishment. If someone could potentially clarify this, I'd greatly appreciate it. What are the exact specification that should be used for this punishment and also what type of whip should exactly be used for this? Alternatively, can someone explain why Rambam says that they're to be striped if the word being used is masculine and the number/type of tool to be used for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Let's unpack this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For Biblically-mandated lashes, do they apply to women too?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Makkot.3.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See Mishna Makkos 3:14</a>. Maimonides, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Sanhedrin_and_the_Penalties_within_their_Jurisdiction.18.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 19 of The Grand Court and the Punishments Entrusted to Them</a>, lists 207 ways to incur Biblically-mandated lashes. It includes \"a woman wearing a man's garb\", for example.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the verse about whipping talks about \"your brother\", why does the Talmud understand it applies to women too?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Excellent question! Please ask that separately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How many lashes, when Biblically-mandated?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We follow the tradition of the Talmud. Never more than 39. (If we expect them to be up for less, or they soil themselves in the middle, than it can be far fewer.) See Chapter 3 of Mishna Makkos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who gives these lashes, and how?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A properly-ordained rabbinic court, which we haven't had in over a thousand years. (There was an attempt to reboot \"super-ordination\" in the late 1500s; there were Jews who had violated all sorts of commandments in order to not be thrown out of Spain, and they felt guilty about it; they wanted to be whipped. But the ordination thing didn't work.) See more details in Tractate Makos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So can I go attack a lesbian?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>No.</strong> For many, many reasons. But first and foremost: are you an autonomous Jewish government with an overwhelming majority who are religiously observant, and have courts with super-ordination?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does the prohibition of lesbianism warrant Biblically-mandated lashes?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No. The creative reading on the verse in Leviticus appears to be a springboard for a rabbinic prohibition. Guess what's not in Maimonides' list of 207? Lesbianism. The key phrase he's using is \"whipping for rebellion\" (and he doesn't say <em>it warrants the punishment</em>, rather <em>it would be appropriate to ...</em>), which is a telltale phrase for violating <em>rabbinic</em> prohibitions, which are less severe.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Tell me more about whipping someone for rabbinic prohibitions?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105897/how-similar-were-rabbinic-mandated-lashes-to-torah-mandated-lashes\">Asked and answered here.</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who should we study with?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A standard teaching is having me a little confused:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עֲשֵׂה לְךָ רַב -- Make for yourself a teacher. [Avot 1:6]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first blush, it means: Find yourself a learned rabbi, as great as possible, to teach you Torah.  But the Rambam says it refers only to a study partner -- <em>any</em> study partner, even one who knows less than you do:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[Make for yourself a teacher] means [make him play that role] even if he is not fit to be your mentor.  Place him upon you as a mentor, so that you can discuss and argue with him.  As a result of this, wisdom will come into your hand. If a man studies on his own, it is good; but if he studies with someone else, the teaching will be better established in his hand and it will be clearer -- even if his partner is like him or even below him in wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud emphasizes that point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak said: Why are Torah matters likened to a tree, as it is stated [in Proverbs]: \"It is a tree of life to them that hold it fast.\" [Proverbs 3:18] ?  Because just as a small piece of wood can ignite a large piece, so too, minor Torah scholars can sharpen great Torah scholars.  And this is what Rabbi Ḥanina said: I have learned much from my teachers and even more from my peers, but from my students most of all. [Taanit 7a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does all this imply that</p>\n<p>(1) It is <em>better</em> to study with someone who is \"below you in wisdom\" or just that</p>\n<p>(2) You should study <em>with someone else</em> -- the more learned the better, but even if he isn't learned it's better than to study alone?</p>\n\n\n",

So too, on Shabbat, if one didn't\nsay \"Who sanctifies Shabbat\" but only said \"Who sanctifies Israel\" one\nhas also not fulfilled one's obligation, even though one did mention\n[shabbat] in the middle of one's tefilla, because one didn't seal the\nprayer with Shabbat. This is true of both kiddush and tefilla.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it sounds like it is only an issue to forget mentioning shabbat in the part after <em>Baruch Atah</em>. This appears to be the case, and following a discussion in Shulchan Aruch HaRav which goes into a lot more detail, it seems like there are opinions that would consider one as having fulfilled his obligation if one forgot Shabbat but did remember Yom Tov, <em>so long as they remembered to mention Shabbat in the middle</em>.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: It's clear from the wording of both the Mishna Berura and Shulchan Aruch HaRav that if one forgot to mention Shabbat at all during the tefilla, then one has not fulfilled one's obligation and would either need to repeat or do tashlumin (follow citations for the exact laws of this), but if one did remember at least to say it in the beracha itself after \"<em>Baruch Atah</em>...\" but otherwise forgot to mention it in the middle, they do not have to make it up. If it's the other way around, one should seek one's LOR for whether one should follow the opinions brought in the SAH'R about whether they have fulfilled it or not.</p>\n<p>Not answered yet:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is musaf any different due the korbanot being mentioned</li>\n<li>Is the procedure for tashlumin different from any other tashlumin?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Ex.: \"Land\" is “eretz”, but when last word or right before a pause, it's “aretz”.  So for \"geshem\": When it's last it's \"gashem\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Mashiv HaRuach U’Morid HaGeshem,\"--“The One Who makes the wind blow, and makes the rain fall.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This line is part of the \"Gevurot\" section, meaning \"strengths [of God]\".  \"Strengths\" is plural\", so \"making rain\" is not the end.  The section begins with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Atta gibor leolam Hashem mehayye metim atta rav lehoshia' --\n[You are the] mighty, eternal, reviver of the dead, savior.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Then comes the part about the wind and rain, then it continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"... [You] support the fallen, heal the sick, release the captive...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So \"geshem\" is not the last word, and should be pronounced “geshem”.</p>\n<p>Sephardim defuse the \"dispute\" by responding “l’vracha” after \"geshem\", thereby making the word “geshem” come in the middle, not the end, of a clause, and thereby accommodate both arguments by saying \"geshem\".</p>\n\n\n",

(Rashi)\n\n## Frage\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>קָטֹנְתִּי מִכֹּל הַחֲסָדִים <strong>וּמִכָּל־הָאֱמֶת</strong></p>\n<p>I am unworthy of all the kindness and <strong>all the truth</strong>...(Bereshit 32:11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi on \"truth\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומכל האמת. אֲמִתַּת דְּבָרֶיךָ, שֶׁשָּׁמַרְתָּ לִי כָּל הַבְטָחוֹת\nשֶׁהִבְטַחְתַּנִי:</p>\n<p>All the truth. You are true to your words, because You have already kept all the promises You made me</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is it me or is this an unexpected and interesting answer from Rashi?</p>\n<p>Shouldn't his feeling of unworthiness come from the <em>promises</em>  (and their inevitable fulfilment), not the <em>fulfilment</em> of the promises/Hashem's trustworthiness? Isn't that implying that Hashem only fulfils His own promises if the people He has promised are worthy?</p>\n<p><strong>I'm sure Rashi is telling us something amazing through this succinct and interestingly-worded point, what do you think?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ramban asks this question (thanks @Chatzkel) and explains that Rashi has made a mistake, and the real interpretation of this verse is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והחסדים הם הטובות שעשה עמו בלא נדר <strong>והאמת הטובה אשר הבטיחו ואימת לו\nהבטחתו</strong> יאמר שאיננו ראוי שיבטיחנו ויעשה לו אותן טובות שהבטיחו בהן ולא\nלטובות אחרות רבות שעשה עמו</p>\n<p>Now <em>hachasadim</em> (the mercies) are the kindnesses which G-d did for\nhim without having vowed to do them, <strong>and <em>ha'emet</em> (the truth) is the\nkindness which He promised him and fulfilled</strong>. Jacob thus said that he\nwas unworthy of G-d’s promising him and performing those kindnesses\nwhich He promised him, nor was he worthy of those other many\nkindnesses which He did for him without having promised to do them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, when Yaacov says he was unworthy of the \"truths\", he was saying that he was unworthy of the promises in the first place.</p>\n<p>He then adds that <em>Emet</em> is referring to long-lasting kindnesses that are well established, such as children.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup><strong>My own thought:</strong> One might thus say in defence of Rashi that Rashi could be saying that Yaacov was humbled by <em>the way</em> Hashem kept His promises. As יהושע ק@ pointed out, Yaacov was Hashem's Chariot because of his having taken truth in purity (see Shaarei Orah Hakdama 6), so therefore he was an expert in \"truth\". His praise that Hashem's truth is humbling could mean that the way Hashem keeps His promises makes him feel small i.e. 'I thought I was good at keeping promises but Your promise keeping is truly Divine; You promised me children, but I didn't expect to be given such wonderful children, so many children, and a family line that will never persih' etc.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Or is Boaz the only <strong>other</strong> one mentioned like that? I would like other examples because in the case of women, this is recurrent.

This indicates that one may wait twenty years. Rav Naḥman said to him: <strong>Isaac knew that he was infertile</strong>, and therefore there was no reason for him to marry another woman, as Rebekah was not the cause of their infertility.

Rather, the tanna requires that verse that states when Jacob and Esau were born for that which Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba taught. This is because Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Why were Ishmael’s years counted in the Torah, as they do not appear to be relevant to its narrative? In order to determine through them the years of Jacob, i.e., Jacob’s age at the time that various events took place, as explained in tractate Megilla (17a). The verse concerning Jacob’s birth was not meant to allude to a halakha about remaining married before having children, but to make it possible to determine Jacob’s age by relating it to the age of Ishmael.

    "title": "Why are some sins \"unforgivable\"?",
    "content": "# Why are some sins \"unforgivable\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong>: Why are some consequences (such as punishments, penalties) in Torah Law permanent, with no appeal or way to alleviate? I am looking for a general covering this topic ideally using an answer that case studies the point that once a wife has cheated on her husband they are no longer allowed to remain married ever again.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Background</strong>: What is the concept of forgiveness as it relates to relationships between people in Judaism? Are there forgiven and unforgivable sins? Forgiveness means forgetting any hurt or feeling of revenge, does it depend on whether the person regrets it or does it not depend on it? Does forgiving mean having previous relationships again?</p>\n<p>Observing the Torah this of forgiveness is a very strange concept for me but it seems to exist in the Jewish core, the common people and here I include myself see the Torah as a set of laws and punishments, with no scope for the law to punish an interval of repentance or forgiveness, even the concept of teshuvah that I've done here still has many doubts. It is said that God forgives everything, even the most vile sinner but apparently men have sins that cannot be forgiven such as adultery on the part of the wife since adultery on the part of the husband towards his wife is not recognized, he has to separate from her.</p>\n<p>So how is this structured in Judaism? I want to hear the whole story if that segmentation exists.</p>\n<p>There are similar questions already asked on this site that I have already seen but not with doubts like mine, so do your best to offer an adequate answer to each of the points in doubt, you don't need to answer all of them, you can answer all or just one</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems you are conflating a few different ideas. There is obtaining forgiveness from G-d (not being punished for the sin), forgiveness from the person you harmed, and there is undoing all effects of the sin.</p>\n<p>The first can be done with sincere teshuva. If one sincerely regrets the sin and resolves himself not to do it again, possibly with extra steps depending on the sin, etc, one can obtain forgiveness from G-d for even the worst sins. This means that on Rosh Hashana, or when one goes up to heaven, or any other time one is being judged for his sins, this one isn't counted as a sin, and one isn't punished for it. Note that, if the sin harmed another person, one must <em>first</em> obtain their forgiveness before G-d will consider forgiving your sin.</p>\n<p>The second can be done by sincerely asking the person you harmed for forgiveness. There are provisions for if the person has already died, in which case one may have to go to their grave with ten men to ask for forgiveness, or if the person won't grant forgiveness after being sincerely asked some number of times. After this, the sin is forgiven by the person, and is eligible to be forgiven by G-d.</p>\n<p>Even if a sin is completely forgiven, it can have some effects that can't be undone, regardless how much one regrets the act. This is the concept of \"what is crooked will not be able to be straightened\" (Ecclesiastes 1:15). If one has a child out of wedlock, the child will not be un-born just because he did teshuva. If one's sin has any lasting effects, they may not ever be able to be undone.</p>\n<p>In the case you mention, a woman can <em>never</em> go back to being with one man if she was ever with another man afterwards. This includes if she divorced her first husband, and then the second one died/divorced her/etc - she cannot get remarried to her first husband. Obtaining forgiveness from her husband and doing teshuva does not undo the fact that she was with another man. Not everything can be undone.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Laws are designed to ecnourage good behavior. When a woman knows her sin will not be forgiven, she will be less likely to cheat.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the Mamzer punishment is designed to deter parents from intending to bear a child through an illegal relationship.</p>\n<p>Sins between man and God are also not entirely forgivable, as implied in the Talmed  whenever quoting the verse \"that which is bent cannot be made straight.\"</p>\n<p>Much of the lore about repentance is designed to create visualizations which help keep a person's behavior optimal, before or after sin.</p>\n\n\n",

He had already predicted the downfall and death of Pharaoh and his army as being so decisive that Egypt as a world power would never again pose a serious threat to the Jews. (verse 13-14) He had also told the people that G’d would do the fighting for them and that all they had to do was to remain silent. Moses’ outcry was one of concern with the rebellious attitude of the people who not only were afraid, something that could be forgiven, but who had dared to be sarcastic in their hour of danger, ridiculing Moses’ leadership to the point where he was afraid that they would refuse to enter the sea when told to.

That if they will be in the mode of faith and belief, and they would travel, going and proceeding to the Sea absolutely certain and without fear, out of their mighty belief that it will undoubtedly split before them, then as a result they will cause an awakening above, so that a miracle should happen and it will split before them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Custom to sing about moshiach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does anyone know of sources documenting people singing about moshiach. For example, there is a chosid of the Ruzhiner who composed a song about the Ruzhiner as moshiach. Likewise it says in the Talmud that the leviim would sing mizmor shir l’yom hashabbos and think about the redemption. I’m wondering if anyone knows of any communities that sang about Moshiach or his coming and which has been documented specifically in the past 1000 years.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This question could be either very good or very bad. Maybe the questioner wants to know why moshiach is such a common theme in Jewish music. I could ask the same thing about any sport, why do the fans of X team sing Y song, is it written in a book that they have to sing it? Why do they sing the national anthem when the USA president goes somewhere? Is it a law?</p>\n<p>• Answer 1: When something matters to you, it shows up in your songs. Jews have longed for moshiach for so long that we sing about it with passion.</p>\n<p>• Answer 2: Most of the Jewish songs we sing today were composed and written after the holocaust, when the only hope that Jews had was that this was the start of the moshiach era, so it became a classic Jewish song.</p>\n<p>• Answer 3: It is one of the beliefs that Jews say every day, and it is the only one out of the thirteen that fits to the tune.</p>\n<p>• Answer 4: Moshiach is song, this is a deep answer and needs thought. If there are those interested I am more than happy to explain this idea.</p>\n<p>Rebbe Nachman in Lekutei mahran 49:5.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְזֶה בְּחִינַת הַשִּׁיר שֶׁיִּתְעַר לֶעָתִיד, וְהוּא שִׁיר פָּשׁוּט,\nכָּפוּל, מְשֻׁלָּשׁ, מְרֻבָּע, וְהֵם עֲשָׂרָה מִינֵי נִגּוּנָא.\n5. This is the aspect of the song that will be roused in the Future. It is a simple-twofold-threefold-fourfold song, this being the Ten\nKinds of Song.  זֶה בְּחִינַת הֵא, שֶׁהִיא דָּלֶת עִם יוּד. דָּלֶ\"ת,\nזֶה בְּחִינַת שִׁיר פָּשׁוּט, כָּפוּל, מְשֻׁלָּשׁ, מְרֻבָּע. יוּד, זֶה\nבְּחִינַת עֲשָׂרָה מִינֵי נִגּוּנָא.  This is the heh, which is a\ndalet and a yod. The dalet is the aspect of a\nsimple-twofold-threefold-fourfold song; the yod is the aspect of the\nTen Kinds of Song.  וְזֶה עַל־יְדֵי הִתְגַּלּוּת מַלְכוּתוֹ,\nבִּבְחִינַת שָׂרָה עַל כָּל הָעוֹלָם. וְשָׂרָה זֶה בְּחִינַת שִׁיר,\nבְּחִינַת: וְשָׁרִים כְּחוֹלְלִים. וְזֶה בְּחִינַת מַלְכוּת דָּוִד,\nשֶׁהוּא בְּחִינַת: נְעִים זְמִירוֹת יִשְׂרָאֵל (שמואל־ב כג).  This\n through the revelation of His Kingship, in the aspect of\n“sarah (she ruled) over the entire world.” And SaRah is the aspect of\nShiR (song), corresponding to “Then the ShaRim (singers) will be like\nflute players.” This is also the aspect of the kingdom of David, for\nhe is “the sweet singer of Israel” (2 Samuel 23:1).  וְזֶה פֵּרוּשׁ\n(ב\"מ נט): אִתְּתָךְ גּוּצָא – גְּחֹן וּלְחִישׁ, פֵּרֵשׁ רַשִׁ\"י:\nשְׁמַע עֲצָתָהּ.  This is the explanation of: If your wife is short,\nbend down and l’ chish (listen) [to her] (Bava Metzia 59a). Rashi\ncomments: listen to her counsel.  כִּי בֶּאֱמֶת אִשָּׁה יִרְאַת\nהַשֵּׁם הִיא בְּחִינַת עֵצָה. כְּשֶׁהַתְּפִלָּה, הַיְנוּ בְּחִינַת\nמַלְכוּת, בְּשִׁפְלוּת וּבְקַטְנוּת, בִּבְחִינַת אִתְּתָךְ גּוּצָא,\nבִּבְחִינַת (שיר השירים ח׳:ח׳): אָחוֹת לָנוּ קְטַנָּה, בְּחִינַת\n(בראשית א׳:ט״ז): אֶת הַמָּאוֹר הַקָּטֹן, בִּבְחִינַת עֲצָתוֹ נוֹפָלֶת\n(סנהדרין כב ע\"ש) –  In fact, a Godfearing woman is the aspect of\nadvice. When the prayer—i.e., the aspect of <David’s> kingdom—is lowly\nand KaTNut (constricted)—in the aspect of “your wife is short,” and\n“we have a KTaNa (little) sister” (Song of Songs 8:8) —it corresponds\nto “the KaTaN (lesser) light” (Genesis 1:16), in the aspect of “his\ncounsel falls away” (Sanhedrin 22a).  צָרִיךְ לְהָקִים אוֹתָהּ,\nבִּבְחִינַת (עמוס ט׳:י״א): אָקִים אֶת סֻכַּת דָּוִד. וְסֻכָּה זוֹ\nשָׂרָה, שֶׁסָּכְתָה בְּרוּחַ הַקֹּדֶשׁ (מגילה יד), וְשָׂרָה זֶה\nמַלְכוּת, בִּבְחִינַת (משלי י״ט:כ״א): עֲצַת ה' הִיא תָקוּם,\nבִּבְחִינַת (בראשית א׳:ט״ז): שְׁנֵי הַמְּאוֹרוֹת הַגְּדוֹלִים.  [When\nprayer is lowly] it is necessary to erect it, in the aspect of “I will\nerect the  sukkah (booth) of David” (Amos 9:11). SuKkah is\nSaRah, for “she SaKhtah (foresaw) with the spirit of holiness”\n(Megillah 14a), and Sarah is Malkhut. [Prayer is also] the aspect of\n“the counsel of God that will stand” (Proverbs 19:19), and the aspect\nof “the two great lights” (Genesis 1:16).  וְזֶה: וּלְחִישׁ לָהּ –\nתְּקַבֵּל עֲצָתָהּ. וְזֶה עֲלִיּוֹת הַתְּפִלָּה שֶׁהִיא בְּלַחַשׁ,\nשֶׁהִיא עֲבוֹדָה שֶׁבַּלֵּב:  This is “L’ChiSh (listen) to her” \naccept her counsel— the ascent of the prayer, which is\n[recited] b’LaChaSh (silently), for it is the service of the heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But Artscroll's footnote 24. on 17a summarizes the opinions and says this explicitly. And ריטב\"א's proof (linked above) to the חכמים agreeing is ובשיירא אפילו רבנן קמאי מודו דאפילו ביישוב נותנין להם כל צרכן וכדאמרי׳ בהדיא דיחיד ביישוב בלחוד איכא בינייהו. It seems to me that the same דיוק could be made on the גמרא, where רבי יהודה says something <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.16b.21?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">similar</a> מַקִּיפִין בְּקָנִים וְכוּ׳. בִּשְׁיָרָא אִין, בְּיָחִיד לָא? וְהָתַנְיָא, רַבִּי יְהוּדָה אוֹמֵר: כׇּל מְחִיצּוֹת שַׁבָּת לֹא הִתִּירוּ לְיָחִיד יוֹתֵר מִבֵּית סָאתַיִם.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe the חידושי הגר\"א מגריידיץ (from in the קובץ מפרשים of the עוז והדר משניות) addresses this point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>חידושי הגר\"א מגריידיץ רע\"ב ד\"ה אחד משני דברים.</strong> והלכתא כוותיהו וכו'. הרע\"ב קיצר כאן, דלכאורה נראה כסותר את דבריו שאמר בין ליחיד בין לרבים וכו' שהשוה יחיד לרבים, והדר כתב אלא שאדם אחד וכו' [שהוא כדעת רבי יהודה במתני' כדמתרץ הגמ' (טז:) לא נצרכה וכו', ועיין רש\"י שם ד\"ה ליתן וכו' דהא דקאמר רבי יהודה וכו']. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He says the רע\"ב words are very abbreviated, because taken literally they contradict themselves - the 1st \"הלכתא כותייהו\" implies both an individual and group can have כל צרכן, and then he qualifies it.</p>\n<p>The rest of the comment of the חידושי הגר\"א מגריידיץ appears to be clarifying the different opinions and what is the הלכה.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadiah of Bertinoro was 15th century and likely did not come up with this on his own, to say in Aramaic והלכתא כותייהו. Rather, he's channeling an earlier source such as the Rif, in the 11th century, who <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.16b.22?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&p2=Rif_Eruvin.5a.3&lang2=bi&w2=Eruvin&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> in quite similar language:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וחכמים אומרים אחד משני דברים: חכמים היינו תנא קמא איכא בינייהו יחיד בישוב דרבנן בתראי סברי יחיד בישוב שרי לטלטולי בתוך מחיצה של שתי או של ערב כדין המדבר <strong>והלכתא כוותיהו</strong> :</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rif operates by quoting the Mishnah and important excerpts of the gemara, then says when we rule like them. I don't feel like delving into how Rabbi Yehuda particularly holds (according to Ritva), which might be subject to dispute amongst Rishonim, but the reason we hold \"like them\" in this presumably something like ruling like the majority instead of the individual. Even if eventually, some combination / configuration led to a Rabbi Yehuda-expounded position, that is not the decisive principle that led the Rif to rule as he did, as he processed the gemara.</p>\n\n\n",

For whoever eats what is leavened, that person—whether a stranger or a citizen of the country—shall be cut off from the community of Israel.\nYou shall eat nothing leavened; in all your settlements you shall eat unleavened bread.\nMoses then summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go, pick out lambs for your families, and slaughter the passover offering.\nTake a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of the blood that is in the basin to the lintel and to the two doorposts. None of you shall go outside the door of your house until morning.\nFor יהוה, when going through to smite the Egyptians, will see the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, and יהוה will pass over the door and not let the Destroyer enter and smite your home.\n“You shall observe this as an institution for all time, for you and for your descendants.\nAnd when you enter the land that יהוה will give you, as promised, you shall observe this rite.\nAnd when your children ask you, ‘What do you mean by this rite?’\nyou shall say, ‘It is the passover sacrifice to יהוה, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when smiting the Egyptians, but saved our houses.’ Those assembled then bowed low in homage.\nAnd the Israelites went and did so; just as יהוה had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\nIn the middle of the night יהוה struck down all the [male] first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh who sat on the throne to the first-born of the captive who was in the dungeon, and all the first-born of the cattle.\nAnd Pharaoh arose in the night, with all his courtiers and all the Egyptians—because there was a loud cry in Egypt; for there was no house where there was not someone dead.\nHe summoned Moses and Aaron in the night and said, “Up, depart from among my people, you and the Israelites with you! Go, worship יהוה as you said!\nTake also your flocks and your herds, as you said, and begone! And may you bring a blessing upon me also!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Is it an offering or not?</strong></p>\n<p>@RabbiKaii : The meaning Christians employ is that Jesus died for our sins as in a sin offering. The pascal \"lamb\" however was not a sin offering, and can't be replaced with anything other the animal, certainly not a human. It was an offering that accompanies a celebration of a festival and is meant to bring joy, which is why we all had a mitzva to eat all of it.\n@Heshy : there's a mitzvah to eat the exact same parts of most sin offerings.</p>\n\n\n",

Does this verb to creates for example create the evil inclination as a sexual need that comes from the animal soul or does it encompass various layers of evil that he can deliberately bring about as a natural disaster?</p>\n<p>Natural disasters in almost all religions were understood as coming from divinity, is that in Judaism so rigid or does it just happen because of the absence of God's order in the world? I think I mean by this as if there were a thermostat in the world, where when humanity is closer to God's will, disasters decrease and when it is farther away, more chaos reigns, in which case God would not be responsible, but the people who come under his protection. Does this make sense in Judaism or does natural disasters run their course regardless and righteous people experience these tragedies? Wouldn't that be a contradiction? Of course, who will determine that a person is fair or not in our eyes? God only knows, would children be classified as righteous? I've seen Jews appeal to reincarnation to explain why apparently righteous or innocent people suffer, does this solve the problem that if we behave well bad things won't happen regardless of what we've done in other lives if the concept of reincarnation is a factual reality?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In our school we are taught that God creates good and evil for his own purpose, to test us?

It is a hindrance of the purpose of existence.</p>\n<p>G-D is perfect. He cannot improve, because there is nothing about Him to improve—mostly due to there being nothing about Him at all, since He’s not a creation. He doesn’t need anything for Himself. However, that is still not a perfect situation. A perfect situation can only be achieved when G-D is chosen. G-D is currently making this perfect situation occur.</p>\n<p>He created the world in a way that has the potential to become perfect, better than any spirituality could ever be. However, that ability is not active, and must be activated. For G-D to activate it Himself would be useless to Him, since there would be no purpose of the world. The only purpose of the world is for a choice to be made, independent of G-D Himself, to do what G-D wants. This is why humans are conscious, have free will, and why evil exists. If there were no evil, there would be nothing to choose from, and therefore no choice to begin with. There has to be a second option to choose against. Still, there has to be a real possibility of choosing the wrong choice, or it’s still not a choice.</p>\n<p>Something to note: Everything happens because of G-D’s active participation. If G-D doesn’t actively make something happen, it doesn’t happen. Therefore, every time you have a thought, G-D is making it happen. This is the miracle of free will: you can choose what you think, even though G-D makes that choice, and the resulting thought. It’s still your choice. This is what the human mind cannot ever comprehend. He also causes every single physical occurrence to happen. A grain of sand on the beach is created by G-D, every single moment, in that exact spot, and with in the same exact shape, etc., as the last moment. Everything happens from G-D.</p>\n<p>It is therefore impossible for evil to somehow be rebelling against G-D. Evil is simply a necessary tool that G-D dislikes, because if people choose it, it hinders the plan, along with the person who made the incorrect choice. However, if they make the right choice, then evil is perfectly functional.</p>\n<p>From the post-Messianic era and onward, the right amount of good choices will finally have been made, so that evil is no longer necessary. There will only be good, as was always intended. This era of evil is temporary.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Entire books have been written on this topic. I'll try to summarize to the best of my ability, based on my understanding of the works of Ramchal.</p>\n<p>G-d created man with the ability to choose between doing good (acting in accordance with G-d's will) and evil (doing the opposite). G-d also created man with the ability to affect the world by his actions. So when man does good, the good in the world is increased. When man does bad, the bad in the world is increased. This is a massive oversimplification, but the general gist of it.</p>\n<p>So on the one hand, G-d created a world with a potential for humans to cause evil. So there are verses in the Bible stressing that evil is a result of G-d's creation, and not the result of another, malevolent divine force outside of G-d's control, as most religions believe. On the other hand, there are verses stressing that evil is a result of human action, and not G-d's direct will.</p>\n<p>The specifics of how this plays out are far beyond human understanding. Part of our tradition is that each action is rewarded individually, so it is not simply a matter of being \"good\" or \"bad\". In addition, we are all both autonomous individuals and members of larger societies. So there is individual and group responsibility. The human mind cannot comprehend all of the calculations necessary to determine how these things play out specifically, even if we know the general rules. (Just as we can explain fluid dynamics, but not where each individual water molecule will end up.)</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, Jacob, physically I think, wrestles with an angel in Genesis 32:22-32, which indicates a material-physical form as far as I can tell. As has been described before, this indicates that angels have a physical form that they can manifest, in conjunction with a non-material transcendental form. As seen in Judges 13 also, when an angel appears to Manoach and his wife, angels can have a more supernatural form, but can still be seen, perhaps teetering on the edges between material and transcendental.</p>\n<p>My question is this: why can't we see angels in their material-physical form like the various people in the Torah could? My thinking is that, as many sages and Rabbis described, humans have degraded their spiritual capabilities and thus don't deserve to interact as a collective, with angels in their physical form, but I'd like to learn about what others have said also.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>An angel can disguise himself as a human being, and even like someone specific, like Eliyahu disguising himself as Rabbi Chiya (Beraishis Rabbah 26:5), however, it seems that there are still certain ways how one can tell if they are human, like the Ba’al Haturim (Beraishis 32:26) explains the reason why the angel struck Yaakov was in order to see if he had nerves, in order to know if he was an angel like him, as angels don’t have nerves</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>They are on a different plane of existence. And likely we couldn’t handle seeing them, when the prophets saw God and angels in a vision they were terrified.</p>\n<p>Also when Moses saw God’s “back” he was transformed.  It seems a person must be very holy to see the other side</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/1028910/jewish/Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 11</a>, the Alter Rebbe explains that there are persons, G-d forbid, in which the animal soul prevail:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is also the person in whom the wickedness prevails more strongly, and all three garments of evil clothe themselves in him, causing him to commit more heinous and frequent sins. But intermittently he suffers remorse, and thoughts of repentance enter his mind, from the quality of good that is in his soul, that gathers strength now and then. However, he has not enough strength to vanquish the evil so as to rid himself entirely of his sins and be as one who confesses and abandons [his evil ways, once and for all].Concerning such a person, the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have said, “The wicked are full of remorse.” These represent the majority of the wicked, in whose soul still lingers some good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe explains that there are also people in which's soul, there isn't good anymore, the evil prevails too much.

Living intensely within certain limits, working to get what our soul desires, relating intensely with whom we feel attracted, having children, tasting flavors and tastes, wandering around the Earth?</p>\n<p>Some argue that this would be a secular philosophy of life or even contrary to God, that by doing this we are almost living like animals, without having that spirituality developed, is there a greater purpose down here or is this only reserved for certain enlightened people for a specific purpose about Israel as prophets and kings? Should I pursue these issues or does it just happen naturally? The ordinary citizen in Israel at the time of the kings, as far as we can see, lived normally as people of the world, being guided by what the elite of Israel leaned towards, either towards monotheism or polytheism.</p>\n<p>In terms of philosophy of life, how do Jews see our stay here? Live as stated above only in a decent way and finally die, with no expectation that you will receive a special mission from God? I say this because it seems that living normally seems like an empty life and that it will not leave fruit or legacy, we see world and religious personalities who have done great things and we aspire to feel that contact, doesn't it have to be like that? Living normal, day after day is what we have as a creature?</p>\n\n\n",

This is not because it is \"depraved\", but because that's what it inherits from its animal nature. In fact, it's generally innocent. Enjoying good food is a morally neutral thing that all animals share, and so do we thanks to the animal component of our beings.</p>\n<p>To explain it in a different way (based on Tanya), the things which give us enjoyment and pleasure are unique to each individual, and are almost impossible to modify or change. We can cultivate pleasures, but generally speaking we are unable to do anything about the <em>enjoyment of material pleasures</em>. We are stuck with it, incurable. If a Jew were to accidentally take a bite out of pork, ch'v, he may be horrified at the mistake, but one thing he can't be blamed for is the fact that his mouth enjoyed the taste - there's nothing he can do about that*.</p>\n<p>The purpose and goal of us being created with pleasures for material things, and (for most of us), pleasures for evil things, is that we should use our free will to reject these things under challenge and temptation. By doing so, we elevate ourselves and the world and perform Hashem's mission, which is to cleanse the world of mundanity, impurity and lowliness and elevate it to holiness, spirituality, Godliness and receptive to the Divine Presence. Each person is given their own mission and their own area of life to \"fix\" like this, i.e. their own set and range of pleasures and temptations.</p>\n<p>By experiencing the energy and intensity of physical temptation, we are able to capture that energy by resisting (and repenting on the times we lose the battle) and rescue it, so that when evil is cured forever, we have kept all these wonderful <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133175/31534\">sparks</a> that never belonged on the side of evil in the first place.</p>\n<p><sup>* This is not the complete story, as Tanya mentions how King David destroyed this inclination through fasting, and discusses what goes on in the hearts of great people like him, as well as other people born with nothing but enjoyment of spiritual matters</sup></p>\n\n\n",

At the heart of the question here is if someone damages/steals but the owner in the end turns out to have gained, or at least not lost, due to his damage, is the person still liable.</p>\n<p>A somewhat similar case is a situation that someone damaged or stole an object that was insured. The owner did not incur a monetary loss (he may of even gained sometimes) from the damage that was done. More so, through the damage he received an insurance check. Is the damager liable?</p>\n<p>Although there’s a machlokes about insurance, the dispute centers on the exact mechanics of insurance payments, whether they are tied to the object or to the one who paid premiums. Regardless, this case would be similar in theory to those who look at insurance as a side benefit tied to the owner. The Maharsham was one of those held of this theory in insurance, and in Teshuvos <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1528&st=&pgnum=12&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsham 4:7</a> he says that if the insurance paid for the damages, the one who damaged is still liable to pay since the insurance is a separate thing.</p>\n<p>So it seems that if someone caused damage or stole, and the owner had a side benefit from that, the person is still liable for his actions. Even those who disagree by insurance it is only because they hold the item is insured not the owner, and so it’s not really counted as a damage. But in a case where the benefit is from a side thing, all seem to agree that the person is still liable for the damages. So in your case, any side benefit the owner received (item was saved from fire etc) shouldn’t have any bearing on the liability of the damager.</p>\n\n\n",

Shouldn't this gemara prove the opposite, that scissors are mutar, because he said that some use a razor and are oiver, with the implication that other than a razor is mutar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I've edited the question to include the text of Orchos Yosher.</p>\n<p>I believe that Rav Chaim's point is much narrower. He is not trying to prove from this that cutting with a scissors is forbidden. Rather, he is trying to bolster the idea that nowadays, we should act counter to those who are embarrassed about their beards. We should show everyone that the mitzvot commanded by the Torah are dear to us.</p>\n<p>To reinforce this point, he brought Berachot 11a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן, בֵּית הִלֵּל אוֹמְרִים: עוֹמְדִין וְקוֹרִין, יוֹשְׁבִין וְקוֹרִין, וּמַטִּין וְקוֹרִין, הוֹלְכִין בַּדֶּרֶךְ וְקוֹרִין, עוֹשִׂין בִּמְלַאכְתָּן וְקוֹרִין. וּמַעֲשֶׂה בְּרַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל וְרַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה, שֶׁהָיוּ מְסוּבִּין בְּמָקוֹם אֶחָד, וְהָיָה רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל מוּטֶּה, וְרַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה זָקוּף. כֵּיוָן שֶׁהִגִּיעַ זְמַן קְרִיאַת שְׁמַע, הִטָּה רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר וְזָקַף רַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל. אָמַר לוֹ רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה לְרַבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל: יִשְׁמָעֵאל אָחִי, אֶמְשׁוֹל לְךָ מָשָׁל לְמָה הַדָּבָר דּוֹמֶה — מָשָׁל לְאֶחָד שֶׁאוֹמְרִים לוֹ זְקָנְךָ מְגוּדָּל! אָמַר לָהֶם: יִהְיֶה כְּנֶגֶד הַמַּשְׁחִיתִים. אַף כָּךְ אַתָּה, כָּל זְמַן שֶׁאֲנִי זָקוּף — אַתָּה מוּטֶּה, עַכְשָׁיו כְּשֶׁאֲנִי הִטֵּתִי אַתָּה זָקַפְתָּ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Sages taught in a baraita that Beit Hillel say: One may recite Shema in any situation: Standing and reciting, sitting and reciting, reclining and reciting, walking and reciting and even working and reciting. And in the Tosefta an incident is related where two tanna’im, Rabbi Yishmael and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya, who were both disciples of Beit Hillel, were reclining at a meal in one place together with their students, and Rabbi Yishmael was reclined as was the customary dining position, and Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya was upright. When the time to recite the evening Shema arrived, Rabbi Elazar reclined to recite Shema in accordance with the opinion of Beit Shammai, while Rabbi Yishmael sat upright to recite Shema. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya appeared to take offense, and said to Rabbi Yishmael: Yishmael, my brother, I will tell you a parable to which this is similar. It is comparable to a situation where one to whom people say as a compliment: Your beard is full and suits you. That man says to them: May it be against those who shave and destroy their beards, i.e., the only reason I grow my beard is to irritate those who cut their own (Rashba). You are the same. As long as I am upright, you are reclined, and now when I reclined lauding your conduct and emulating you, you sat upright as if to demonstrate that whatever I do, you do the opposite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea here is that the person had a rather full and long beard, and was complimented for it, זְקָנְךָ מְגוּדָּל. He responded that the reason he grew his beard out so much was to counter those who shave improperly.</p>\n<p>Rav Kanievsky's focus in citing this gemara is <strong>NOT</strong> on whether there are some who might act properly (e.g. with a scissors, if that were the case). Though he does add the words legamrei, that they destroy it entirely, that they don't have any beards at all. Rather, it is that this fellow in the analogy acted lehach'is. And so too, he says, we should act lehach'is.</p>\n<p>Your question is whether the focus on countering those who destroy it entirely should be evidence that with scissors are permitted. Maybe, though note that he is talking about lehaktin, to trim, and not necessarily to get to the bare skin.</p>\n<p>Also, while earlier positions set out in the sefer are that it would be forbidden because of lo tashchit, or chukat goyim, or lo yilbash, here his point is that this person in the analogy was proud of the mitzvot, and so went counter to what others were doing (to the level of prohibition). So from a hashkafic approach we shouldn't trim.</p>\n<p>Comments and other answers have already written counter to the sefer Hadras Ponim-Zokon. I'll add that I concur with the disagreement with the sefer. The Targum Yonatan on Chumash is properly called Targum Yerushalmi, since Yonatan ben Uziel didn't translate chumash. Further, there are many valid counterarguments to the positions set out in the sefer, and many major talmidei chachamim through the generations who permitted, based on alternative understandings of gemaras. The sefer is a polemic, and doesn't admit the potential validity of the other positions. Meanwhile, we pasken like Bet Hillel in part because they first mentioned the positions of Bet Shammai.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya! Using scissors does not violate the aveirah of Ba'al Tashchis, which refers to shaving one's beard. The sources you quote say there may be other problems, such as appearing feminine, or other people assuming you shaved in a forbidden way.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that while many Israeli Charedi poskim and Chassidim are adamantly against shaving and consider electric shavers to be no better than razors, the American (non-chassidic) minhag is to rely on Rav Moshe Feinstein's heter to use some shavers. Before electric shavers, bochurim in yeshiva would use depillatory creams. Photos of European pre-War yeshiva bochurim bear this out. (Including one of Rav Aryeh Leib Steinman zt\"l.)</p>\n<p>In Slabodka yeshivas, which have a strong emphasis on appearing neat, they insist strongly on bochurim shaving. I heard from a former talmid of Slabodka in Eretz Yisroel that in his day, bochurim with beards could not get aliyos. In Ner Yisroel in Baltimore, Rav Dovid Kronglass zt\"l used to allow bochurim to shave in honor of Shabbos even during Sefirah. The yeshiva still has a strong emphasis on being clean-shaven.</p>\n<p>One of the greatest Kabbalists of all time, the Ramchal, did not have a beard, at least early in life. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/94533/did-the-ramchal-have-a-beard\">here.</a></p>\n<p>So definitely ask a Rav before deciding on your own whether or not to grow a beard.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My understanding of R. Chaim (at least in the piece brought in the question) is as follows:</p>\n<p>Technically, trimming the beard with scissors is permitted. However, since we live in a generation where many remove their beards in a forbidden way, it behooves us not to use scissors, even though it is permitted,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>להראות לפני הכל שהמצות שצותה תורה להצטיין בזה האיש יהודי חביב אצלינו ואין אנו מתבישין בהן ח\"ו</p>\n<p>to show everyone that the <em>mitzvot</em> which the Torah commanded us so that a Jewish man is distinguished are precious to us, and we are not embarrassed of them, G-d forbid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, scissors are permitted, but R. Chaim still encourages that they not be used.</p>\n<p>This, then, is like the story in Berachot. Although the man could have used scissors to trim his beard, he preferred to let it grow long, to show that he was different from those who shave their beards in a forbidden way.</p>\n\n\n",

What it says is to remember what Amalek DID (Deut.25:17-18).<br />\nSo it is very much as relevant today as it was in the time of Moshe (Moses). The next question that we must answer then is, what did they do? They allowed the Israelites to pass and then ambushed them from the rear. Who would be in the front? Who would be in the rear? In the front, you'd have strong and able bodied individuals who could protect the Israelites. In the rear, very old, very young, ill, and weak, or those unable to defend themselves or others. So as you look through history, do you find this behavior? The Torah is very clear. When we see the actions of Amalek, we shall blot them from existence.</p>\n\n\n",

However, there is a difference in the approach. I would recommend watching <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/multimedia/video_cdo/aid/3521399/jewish/Competing-Ideals-of-Ascent-and-Struggle.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lecture</a> which specifically sets out to answer your question.</p>\n<p>To summarise (far too briefly to do it justice), they are both seminal works of their authors, who both intended that this particular path will bring about the redemption. The \"difference\" in approach is that Mesilat Yisharim seeks to elevate the human being to perfection, whereas Tanya seeks to bring Godliness down into the world (and there is a huge amount of overlap). Both of these tasks are compatible and are both necessary to finish the job.</p>\n<p>A mashal I like to employ is that Mesilat Yisharim is a \"how to be a good husband\" manual. It's goal is to refine and elevate you. Tanya is more of a work specialising \"getting to know your Wife\". As you can see, both are very important jobs to engage in in order to achieve a successful and intimate marriage.</p>\n<p>R' Loewenthal does make a point that he believes is a key difference. Mesilat Yisharim doesn't devote much if any of its words to struggle. It's simply a very long a to b of \"do this, and when you've mastered it, do that, and so on\". Tanya on the other hand devotes a huge amount of work to explaining that some tasks in life are endless. The <em>Benoni</em> is <em>always</em> going to struggle with temptation, and it's not reasonable to expect this aspect of the battle is ever going to be winnable. The Tanya explains that the purpose of this is that the struggle itself is valuable, and brings down Kedusha and Godliness to the world.</p>\n<p>This is why the lecture is called \"Competing Ideals of Ascent and Struggle\"</p>\n<p>However, I personally prefer to focus on the similarities! The \"<em>Naki</em>\" is Ramchal's \"<em>Benoni</em>\", and so much of what each says about this type of person is identical. What we learn about in Mesilat Yisharim's chapters on <em>Perishut</em>, <em>Tahara</em> and <em>Chassidut</em> are ideas that are very much present in Tanya. The <em>Kadosh</em> and the 'Tanya Tzaddik' are very related. It's amazing how similar these works are, and how clear it is that we have a strong <em>mesora</em> that each Gadol is able to paint and weave into each their own incredibly holy work that has profoundly affected all of us to this day. The differences are mainly differences in personality and approach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Mesilat Yasharim teaches the <em>path of Nevuah</em>, the path of prophecy, meaning how to prepare oneself to become one of the <em>B'nai Aliyah</em>.</p>\n<p>Like its author says in general, he is teaching the analog to the allegory found in the teachings of The Ari z\"l. So too, Mesilat Yasharim follows the teachings of the Ari z\"l that are found within the writings of Rabbi Chaim Vital, z\"l in Sha'ar Ruach HaKodesh, in particular the 4th section.</p>\n<p>This is generally the domain of the <em>Yechidei Segulah</em>, the select, <em>distinguished few</em> within each generation.

The 5th section, Kuntress Acharon, is primarily an explanation of Igeret HaKodesh. It is suggested by some that a person new to the Tanya should begin at the second section, Sha'ar HaYichud which deals with the subject of the Shema, then proceed to Igeret HaTeshuva and only then begin Likkutei Amarim and the balance of the Tanya.</p>\n<p>Like the title page explains, Tanya teaches the path of the <em>Benoni</em>, the intermediate person, who is neither completely righteous, nor r\"l, the opposite. This means that it is intended for the majority of people.</p>\n<p>It's purpose is to teach how the majority of people are to serve G-d and to reveal that G-d dwells everywhere, including in this physical, material plane of existence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Nissan Mendel, quotes the compilers foreword from the Alter Rebbe to his magnus opus, the Tanya.

And what of all our character traits, who likewise are in need of so much rectification and correction. Who will correct them and who will rectify them if we do not attend to them and are not exceedingly meticulous in this?!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Baed on this, the Messilas Yesharim builds on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim%2C_Introduction.42-52?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following principles</a> and explains them at length.

The Tanya also speaks on the subject of the inevitable conflict ensuing from the two divergent sources of consciousness and how to channel them.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe says in the compiler's foreword that he wrote the Tanya to give \"counsel\" to those that seek the path to G-d. Every people has struggles in his Avodas Hashem. People want an private audience with their Rebbe, so the Alter Rebbe wrote the Tanya as an private-audience so to speak for those who seek to perfect their Avodas Hashem.</p>\n\n\n",

(This sichah is somewhat eludicated in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/92347/jewish/Bamidbar-In-Preparation-for-Shavuos.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this book</a>).</p>\n<p>I was wondering. Are there other commentators that explain 1) if, 2) why parashas Bamidbar serves as a preparation for receiving the Torah on Shavuos.</p>\n<p>The more sources, the better the answer :).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are several sources:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Rav Moshe Feinstein</strong> (as brought down in Tallelei Oros on Bamidbar) - Counting inspires self-worth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rav Moshe brings similar to your first point (that it connects to the counting of the Jewish people) that people may question their ability in Torah study and adopt a defeatist attitude. They may say, \"I'm a nobody, and even if I do toil in Torah I won't really achieve much!\" This mindset will lead to them giving up and becoming lazy in their Torah pursuit. As such, we read Bamidbar specifically before Shavuos, which details the count, as it underlines how each and every Jew, whether young or old, is meaningful and counts!</p>\n<p>Therefore:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי כל אדם מישראל יש לו חשיבות וערך והריהו מן הכלל כולו. קריאה בפרשת זו יש בה משום חיזוק לאדם לקראת קבלת התורה</p>\n<p>Because every person from Israel has an importance and worth and is different from the whole community. Reading this parsha is a chizuk for a person going into the acceptance of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.31b.10?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Megillah.31b.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos s.v. \"Klalos\" - Megillah 31b</a> - It serves a functional purpose</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנו קורין במדבר סיני קודם עצרת כדי שלא להסמיך הקללות שבבחוקותי לעצרת</p>\n<p>We read Parshas Bamidbar prior to Shavuos in order not to have the curses that are listed in Bechukosai before Shavuos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>Chidah</strong> - it serves as a uniting force similar to that of Mattan Torah</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.1.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Nachal_Kedumim_on_Torah%2C_Numbers.1.1.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nachal Kedumim</a> that \"במדבר סיני\" is the same gematriah (numerical value) as \"בשלום\" - in other words, from the day the Jewish people left Egypt they were in a fractious state. However, when they arrived at Sinai they came together and united as one - as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 19:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויחן שם ישראל - And Israel camped there</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.19.2.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> famously notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאיש אחד בלב אחד</p>\n<p>Like one man with one heart</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.55a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Nedarim 55a</a></strong> - A desert is reminder to be humble - a crucial tenet for the acquisition of Torah</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Gemara writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַאי דִּכְתִיב: ״וּמִמִּדְבָּר מַתָּנָה וּמִמַּתָּנָה נַחֲלִיאֵל וּמִנַּחֲלִיאֵל בָּמוֹת״? אֲמַר לֵיהּ: כֵּיוָן שֶׁעוֹשֶׂה אָדָם אֶת עַצְמוֹ כַּמִּדְבָּר, שֶׁהוּא מוּפְקָר לַכֹּל — תּוֹרָה נִיתְּנָה לוֹ בְּמַתָּנָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וּמִמִּדְבָּר מַתָּנָה״. וְכֵיוָן שֶׁנִּיתְּנָה לוֹ בְּמַתָּנָה — נְחָלוֹ אֵל, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וּמִמַּתָּנָה נַחֲלִיאֵל״. וְכֵיוָן שֶׁנְּחָלוֹ אֵל — עוֹלֶה לִגְדוּלָּה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וּמִנַּחֲלִיאֵל בָּמוֹת״. וְאִם הִגְבִּיהַּ עַצְמוֹ — הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מַשְׁפִּילוֹ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וּמִבָּמוֹת הַגַּיְא״, וְלֹא עוֹד אֶלָּא שֶׁשּׁוֹקְעִין אוֹתוֹ בַּקַּרְקַע, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וְנִשְׁקָפָה עַל פְּנֵי הַיְשִׁימוֹן״. וְאִם חוֹזֵר בּוֹ — הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מַגְבִּיהוֹ</p>\n<p>What is the meaning of that which is written: “And from the wilderness Mattana and from Mattana Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel Bamot” (Bamidbar 21:18–19)? Rava said to him that it means: Once a person renders himself like a wilderness, deserted before all, the Torah is given to him as a gift [mattana], as it is stated: “And from the wilderness Mattana.” And once it is given to him as a gift, God bequeaths [naḥalo] it to him, as it is stated: “And from Mattana Nahaliel.” And once God bequeaths it to him, he rises to greatness, as it is stated: And from Nahaliel, Bamot, which are elevated places. And if he elevates himself and is arrogant about his Torah, the Holy One, Blessed be He, degrades him, as it is stated: “And from Bamot the valley” (Numbers 21:20). And not only is he degraded, but one lowers him into the ground, as it is stated: “And looking over [nishkafa] the face of the wasteland” (Numbers 21:20), like a threshold [iskopa] that is sunken into the ground. And if he reverses his arrogance and becomes humble, the Holy One, Blessed be He, elevates him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, just a desert is devoid of life and is completely empty, if a person want to truly be ready to acquire Torah he also has to make himself \"empty\" - In other words, he has to become humble and then he will be more able to readily acquire the Torah. Hence we read parshas Bamidbar prior to Shavuos as a necessary preparation going into zman mattan toraseinu.</p>\n\n\n",

If the Torah and our fulfilling of it, is the point of creation, why was it given after so long?</p>\n<p>If people could please answer with some sources or pointers would be much appreciated!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>One explanation is given by Rabbi Naftali ben Shimon Hertz Ginzburg, in his commentary called <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Naftali_Seva_Ratzon_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_The_Four_Sons.1.1?ven=Rabbi_Mark_Greenspan&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Naftali Seva Ratzon on the Pesach Haggadah</a>. Rav Ginzburg explains that the Torah did not reject the earlier generations, but <em>they</em> rejected the Torah.</p>\n<p>It started with Avraham Avinu, who began to spread the Torah to the nations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was only in the time of Abraham that the teachings of Torah were\nrevealed. The Torah says, that “Abraham made souls in Haran;” the\nAramaic translation explains that this means that Abraham taught Torah\nto others; it implies that the Torah began to be revealed in the time\nof Abraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But after reading this, the question might occur:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the Torah was to be revealed after two thousand years, why wasn’t it revealed immediately in the time of Abraham?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Ginzburg explains that in one of the poets we recite on Shavuos, it says that that the Torah could not be given in the time of Isaac because he flattered Esau <sup>1</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jacob was not worthy of receiving the Torah n the Bible says of him:\n“My ways are hidden from the Lord”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Ginzburg goes on to explain that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would appear, then, that Isaac or Jacob were both willing to accept it but they were not worthy of receiving. The Torah did not want to fall into their hands. Ishmael and Esau were both offered the Torah and they rejected it; Ishmael rejected it because he didn’t want to accept the commandment, “Do not commit adultery,” and Esau because he rejected, “Do not murder.” The Torah did not reject them; they rejected the Torah!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to this opinion, the people before Moshe's generation did not accept the Torah with open hands. Moshe and his generation eventually did.</p>\n<p><em><sup>1</sup>  Isaac favored Esau over Jacob! He could not be trusted to give the Torah to Jacob so the Torah was not given in his time</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Why didn't the Torah exist at the very beginning of creation instead of a long time after? Isn't it unjust to deprive millions born before the Torah of the 'divine wisdom'? Many Jews struggled with this question. Therefore, tradition came up with the idea that Abraham observed the Torah before it was revealed.</p>\n<p>In Genesis 26:4 and 5, God tells Isaac that he will give him the land of Canaan, “because Abraham listened to my voice and kept my charge, commandments, statutes, and laws.”</p>\n<p>Rashi, to Midrash Genesis Rabbah 79:7, 92:4, and 95:2, the Babylonian Talmud, Yevamot 21, and other sources, states that Abraham observed the entire Torah even including the rabbinical enactments. Nachmanides adds that others observed the Torah before it was revealed.</p>\n<p>Contrary to Rashi and Nachmanides, however, the Rambam writes in the Mishneh Torah that Abraham had just eight mitzvot: the Seven Noachide Laws plus circumcision. According to the Rambam, Abraham did not have the Torah. He reads the many rabbinical statements that the patriarchs observed the entire Torah as hyperbolic sermons highlighting the importance of Torah observance. It is not meant to be taken literally. Besides, if the patriarchs observed the Torah, the Torah would have mentioned it.</p>\n\n\n",

Three commentaries are assembled together in this book: (1) A shorted version of the great commentary by Rabbi Moses Cordovero [1522-1570], entitled <em>Sefer Or ha-Yakar</em> (The Precious Light); (2) The commentary by Rabbi Hayyim Vital [1543-1620], which, according to Rabbi Abraham Azulai's preface, he wrote before he learned Torah from Rabbi Isaac Luria; and (3) The comments of an anonymous kabbalist that rabbi Abraham Azulai discovered in the margins of Rabbi Abraham Galante [d. 1583], under the title <em>Sefer Zohorei Ḥamah</em>, and this also contains some notes of great value for the understanding of the Zohar.

This extensive commentary, although based on Lurianic kabbalah, does contain many explanation that are very near to the literal meaning of the Zohar. (2) <em>Sefer Ispaklarya ha-Me'ira</em> by Rabbi Zvi Hirsch Horowitz [17th century], a brief commentary that does not follow in the footsteps of Lurianic kabbalah. The author's notes contain valuable textual emendations. (3) <em>Sefer Yahel Or</em> by Rabbi Elijah of Vilna [the Vilna Gaon], whose comments elucidate many of the most obscure points in the Zohar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Rambam observes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל שֶׁבָּא לְיָדוֹ אֶחָד מֵהֶן וְלֹא הֲרָגוֹ עוֹבֵר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כ טז) לֹא תְחַיֶּה כָּל נְשָׁמָה...</p>\n<p>Anyone who has the potential to kill them and doesn’t, has transgressed a negative commandment (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.20.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 20:16</a>) - \"Do not let a soul remain alive\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However he importantly concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּכְבָר אָבַד זִכְרָם</p>\n<p>“Their memory has already been lost”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <strong>Radbaz</strong> adds that the Assyrian General Sancheiriv, who conquered the tribes of Israel, literally, ‘mixed up the world’. This suggests that Sancheiriv destroyed the identities of the various nations and we can no longer define who belongs to one of the seven nations. As such, this command may now be deemed obsolete. Yet, in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.5.5?lang=bi&with=Commentary%20ConnectionsList&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following Mishnah</a> where the Rambam recalls the mitzvah to erase Amalek, he makes no mention of whether this command is applicable nowadays. Therefore, the implication is that since the Rambam says nothing, it must still apply nowadays.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58968&st=&pgnum=185&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haghos Maimonis</a></strong> suggests that this requirement to wipe out Amalek is only relevant in the days of Moshiach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצוה זו אינה נוהגת עד ימות המשיח לאחר כיבוש הארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet, this observation is quickly rejected by the Radbaz who points to the episode that happened with Shaul HaMelech. It was during Shaul’s reign as king, that Shmuel Hanavi told Shaul to attack the Amalekite kingdom and wipe it out – men, women, children and every single animal. As a result Shaul assembled a large army and began his campaign. However, along the way, Shaul faltered, and took pity on Agag, the Amalekite king and his wife. Instead of killing them he imprisoned them until he could confer with Shmuel. Upon hearing, Shmuel told Shaul that he had effectively forfeited his kingdom. When Shaul returned, Agag’s wife eventually escaped and would give birth to a child who would be the ancestor of Haman. The Radbaz proves from this case that Shaul was evidently criticized for not completely destroying Amalek and this was clearly before the days of Moshiach. Indeed, this serves to underscore the point that destroying Amalek is still applicable.</p>\n<p><strong>So back to square one - how to do it today?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Exodus%2C_Parashat_Zachor.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Sefas Emes</strong></a> on Parshas Zachor suggests that the way we are to confront the concept of Amalek is to focus on the very word we are commanded with – זָכוֹר. It is not enough to translate זָכוֹר as merely the need to remember. The Sefas Emes writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועיקר פי' זכירה הוא פנימיות החיות</p>\n<p>The essence of remembrance is a person’s inner vibrancy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that the only way we can erase Amalek from the world is to be constantly aware that enemies exist. It is not enough to just recall past events, rather, we must consciously keep it in our minds and not let the memories fade. By being vigilant, we will ensure that steps are taken to prevent such enemies from arising again, and this in turn, will stifle their very survival.</p>\n<p>In response to the difficulty with the Rambam, <strong>Rav Chaim Soloveitchik</strong> answers that the reason why the Rambam does not mention anything about the relevance of the mitzvah to wipe out Amalek, is because unlike the nations that inhabited the land of Israel, Amalek still exists today. However, it is not necessarily the exact biological descendants of Amalek but rather any person or nation who wishes the Jewish people harm. Thus, any nation who acts with cruelty to the Jewish people is considered to come under the term \"עמלק\" and there is a Mitzvah to destroy them. As a result, the Rambam was not concerned about the fact that Amalek may not be identifiable since there are many ‘Amaleks’ that exist in the world and the mitzvah still stands. Having said this though, classifying Amalek is something that can only come from the gedolei yisroel and it is not in our hands to make our own definitions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In Dov's well sourced and excellent <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135013/31534\">answer</a>, he states that today our duty is to remember, perpetually, that there are enemies, and translate this into practical vigilance preventing the enemies from arising again. Two supportive answers would be 1) what is an enemy and 2) how to take practical steps.</p>\n<p>I would like to deal with 1) in this answer, and I will outline the principles of 2), but a dedicated answer to that would be in order, possibly with reference to modern events to give context. I will base this answer mainly on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6Al_vjAt2c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a>, which is a deep explanation on what Amalek stands for, what we stand for, and what is the original source of what we are fighting over, and how the enemies gain ground. As we are concluding, what we are predominantly supposed to remember today is <em>their ideology</em> and the fact that this ideology is the enemy of Torah, so we need to get to the deep roots and first stirrings in creation that lead to good and evil. I recommend that shiur and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XGWPZAJgKM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">its second part</a> follow up (which goes deep into 2) for a lot more detail that I will have to leave out - apologies for the length despite that.</p>\n<p>I will refer to the ideology as a personified man called Amalek in this for clarity, and to reflect the sources and acknowledge the history. I will also embody Torah in the personification of Yisrael.</p>\n<p>One more disclaimer is that, while I've been deliberate in all my wording, this is the type of answer that Rabbi Sacks A'H might call a \"right brained answer\", intuitive and philosophical - its an answer that has to deal with the realm of super-rational, so it's an important approach - so again let me recommend further reading, and thinking, and certainly I welcome questions. Yaacov Deane in this comment references many other points as well, and references one of the main sources for the information in this answer: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/115101/jewish/Basi-Legani-5711-Chapter-1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ma'amer Basi Legani</a>.</p>\n<h4>What does Amalek stand for?</h4>\n<p>He is the antithesis of the enthusiastic worship of Hashem, may He be blessed. How can we see this? When the Jews came out of Egypt, the enthusiasm for Hashem and Torah was palpably strong, not just with the Jews but across the whole world. Amalek came and cooled off that enthusiasm (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Devarim 25:18</a>). He did it by making the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Look, God split the sea, no question. Fine. Why are you getting so excited? God can do anything! Are you surprised that God can perform a miracle? You are being strange getting so worked up about it, changing your lifestyle and all that!?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The technical issue is that there are two modes of service that shouldn't overlap. In the first, one can do a mitzva because one <em>understands the reasons for it</em>, and agrees, and therefore enthusiastically supports the cause and does the mitzva <em>personally</em>, with one's own self. Or, one can do a mitzva <em>without</em> understanding it, without <em>relating</em> to it, and therefore the service is done out of obedience; <em>God said so, He's in charge and wiser than me, so I'll just do it</em>. Obedience is a putting aside of one's feelings to do something outside of oneself, so how can it intersect with doing things with feeling (all this is based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ester 3:8</a> and commentary)? Amalek doesn't want anything that is outside of you to actually <em>affect</em> you inwardly. In Chassidic terminology, the <em>makif</em> should stay <em>makif</em> and not become <em>penimi</em>.</p>\n<p>What does this boil down to? It's saying only your subjective world should be important to you, and anything outside of you, anything objective, should <em>remain</em> objective and irrelevant to you. It should be meaningless to you. This is the root of the unholy force of Amalek: <em>meaninglessness</em>, קרי, happenstance, random, <em>whatever</em>, and this makes him the polar opposite to Yisrael who stands for preciousness and meaning, יקר (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Leviticus.1.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Baal_HaTurim_on_Leviticus.1.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Baal HaTurim</a>, Sfas Emes on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.1.1?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&aliyot=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra 1:1</a>).</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Amalek's argument that nothing outside of us should affect us personally translates to <em>a war on meaning and preciousness itself</em>, which really is a war on Hashem, the Source and Passionate Advocate of all meaning and preciousness. Nothing really is meaningful, or important, Amalek says. Everything objective just happens to be that way, so just go and find your own subjective meaning in whatever happens to appeal to you personally, for your own personal reasons, #yolo.</p>\n<p>This is Yisrael's worst enemy, and not a single iota of ground should be conceded to it. Yisrael isn't just here to teach monotheism, but that this One God is personal, and did everything meaningfully, and the meaningfulness of His subjectivity is our objective reality. Life <em>is</em> precious, people <em>are</em> precious, Hashem's world and plan is of infinite value and importance and it is good - <strong>be in awe of Him</strong> (see Yaacov Deane's edit further down). We should seek out, amplify and be affected by this meaning that He invested in the world, and not let our inborn subjective feelings get in the way or rise in prominence.</p>\n<h4>How does Amalek gain ground, how does wickedness prosper?</h4>\n<p>In the Kabbalah, there is a level of creation where there is no difference between good and bad, and all things are the same; right and wrong doesn't matter. This level is called <em>Tohu</em>, chaos. Contrast this to the world of <em>Tikkun</em>, order, where right is right and wrong is wrong. Hashem undid <em>Tohu</em> in the 6 days of creation: there were evenings and mornings, light and dark, sun and moon. This is the theme of those days; everything and its opposite was created side by side. The pig was created along side the clean animals. The holiest and most unholiest things were created. They were distinguished, yet they are in some sense still equal, as we will now explain...</p>\n<p>Amalek built a 50 ama gallows, which seems excessively high, and we learn that this number 50 was to represent the 50th Gate of Binah (Binah is the faculty of intelligence that analyses and applies logical derivations, and makes up human comprehension). What is this Gate? The other 49 gates are all the gates that comprise the totality of human comprehension and reason. The 50th Gate goes beyond human comprehension, and is therefore able to reach into this place of \"beyond good and evil\", beyond the world of <em>Tikkun</em>, and as a result evil is able to gain some power. This is best illustrated with a mashal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A person is born a wild animal, meaning he has no discernment. He has\na passion to get up and do things, and he wants to try everything. He\ndoesn't distinguish between what things are good and what are evil,\nwhat are right and wrong. It's only when he is taught and elevated to\na more moral level that he is able to see the difference between right\nand wrong. The more educated in this manner, the more fine\ndistinctions he can make between right and wrong. Regarding some people, the\nheight of their morality is that they know it's wrong to murder, and some\npeople are more refined, sophisticated and elevated, and make more\ndistinctions, and all the way at the top is someone who knows the\nmoral right and wrong of every act and detail of the world, even how to\ntie shoes!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The more we distinguish between the right and the wrong, the less energy is left for evil, because that original wild and untamed energy is now captured, channelled and contained in productive behaviour. The more distinctions between right and wrong, the more wildness has been used. The <em>indiscriminate</em> can no longer siphon off this energy as it has been channelled into and occupied by <em>discriminate</em> behaviour.</p>\n<p>This is true of the world at large. The more indiscriminate energy there is, the more evil can prosper, and in fact the more holiness suffers, as holiness cannot tolerate indiscriminateness (this is the deep reason why we have to earn our goodness - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_Mankind.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 1</a> et al. - as giving us goodness arbitrarily <em>is indiscriminate</em>. A holy person feels uncomfortable when Hashem gives him more than he deserves). So when we don't use the revelation of what God wants to give purpose and order to creation, the super rational passion that was given to all creation is now available to Amalek, and they use it <em>ruthlessly</em>; passionately undoing all meaning and preciousness from the world (one of the deeper reasons they are also called Reishit in the Torah, along side Yisrael).</p>\n<h4>How to defeat Amalek</h4>\n<p>As kabbalah and chassidus put it, our job is to capture the indiscriminate energy of the world and channel it into orderly behaviour. It's not enough to just teach a child right and wrong, but the child should take the wildness, the passion he was born with, and actually channel it in to that orderly behaviour.  Take that which is bigger than us, bigger than right and wrong, bigger than the details, and channel it into practical personal change and improvement. Then we've captured the best of both worlds.</p>\n<p><strong>We serve God in <em>His way</em>, but with <em>our enthusiasm</em>.</strong> Amalek can't stand this, he only thrives when the passion and energy of life is not earmarked for any particular purpose or behaviour, and by channelling it into purposeful behaviour and good deeds, the unholy has no energy left to put into its evil.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is an edit from Yaacov Deane on how to defeat Amalek:</p>\n<p>Rambam explains the mitzvah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.5.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and Their Wars, chapter 5:5</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן <strong>מִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה לְאַבֵּד זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק</strong>. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כה יט) \"<strong>תִּמְחֶה אֶת זֵכֶר עֲמָלֵק</strong>\". וּמִצְוַת עֲשֵׂה לִזְכֹּר תָּמִיד מַעֲשָׂיו הָרָעִים וַאֲרִיבָתוֹ. כְּדֵי לְעוֹרֵר אֵיבָתוֹ. שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים כה יז) \"<strong>זָכוֹר אֵת אֲשֶׁר עָשָׂה לְךָ עֲמָלֵק</strong>\". מִפִּי הַשְּׁמוּעָה לָמְדוּ זָכוֹר בַּפֶּה לֹא תִּשְׁכָּח בַּלֵּב. שֶׁאָסוּר לִשְׁכֹּחַ אֵיבָתוֹ וְשִׂנְאָתוֹ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is a positive commandment that we are to <em>erase</em> the memory of Amalek  by way of <em>remembering</em> what Amalek did to us.</p>\n<p>At first glance this seems to be contradictory. But by looking at the full quotation from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.17-19?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 25:18-19</a> as it appears in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the text of the daily remembrances recited at the close of daily prayers</a> its meaning is understood.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>זָכ֕וֹר אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר־עָשָׂ֥ה לְךָ֖ עֲמָלֵ֑ק</strong> בַּדֶּ֖רֶךְ בְּצֵאתְכֶ֥ם מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃ אֲשֶׁ֨ר קָֽרְךָ֜ בַּדֶּ֗רֶךְ וַיְזַנֵּ֤ב בְּךָ֙ כׇּל־הַנֶּחֱשָׁלִ֣ים אַֽחֲרֶ֔יךָ <strong>וְאַתָּ֖ה עָיֵ֣ף וְיָגֵ֑עַ וְלֹ֥א יָרֵ֖א אֱלֹהִֽים׃</strong> וְהָיָ֡ה בְּהָנִ֣יחַ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֣יךָ ׀ לְ֠ךָ֠ מִכׇּל־אֹ֨יְבֶ֜יךָ מִסָּבִ֗יב בָּאָ֙רֶץ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר יְיָ־אֱ֠לֹהֶ֠יךָ נֹתֵ֨ן לְךָ֤ נַחֲלָה֙ לְרִשְׁתָּ֔הּ <strong>תִּמְחֶה֙ אֶת־זֵ֣כֶר עֲמָלֵ֔ק מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם לֹ֖א תִּשְׁכָּֽח</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That we are to remember how it is recalled in the written Torah which explains that we were vulnerable because we were faint and weary from the exile in Egypt.</p>\n<p>To put this in modern language, we were experiencing battle fatigue and PTSD from the exile and exodus from Egypt and Amalek then struck at the weakest among us. In addition to this, <em>even Moshe was exhausted and was unable to respond</em> in defense. It states in connection with all the above that Amalek struck us (<em>like a predator that feeds upon the weak and sick, culling the herd</em>) and did not fear G-d.</p>\n<p>The root of the problem was not with the Jewish people or its leader, Moshe, but the assessment that <strong>Amalek did not fear G-d</strong>, meaning that Amalek did not act according to G-d’s will.</p>\n<p>And then the  wording of the mitzvah emphasizes that at the final redemption when we have been returned to the land of Israel and G-d has <em>given us rest from all our enemies that surround the land</em> of Israel, <strong>we are to erase the memory of Amalek</strong> <em>from under Heaven</em>. This emphasizes <em>after the stress of battle and the damage that it causes</em>.</p>\n<p>What <em>memory of Amalek</em> do we have? That <strong>Amalek did not fear G-d</strong>!</p>\n<p>וְלֹ֥א יָרֵ֖א אֱלֹהִֽים</p>\n<p>So what are we to erase about this? Are we to commit genocide and kill every last man, woman and child from the descendants of Amalek? Is this the lesson learned by the nation of Israel, <em><strong>who lost more than six million of its innocent people, men, women and children</strong></em>, and was the primary victim of the Holocaust?</p>\n<p>And in fact, if you look throughout the Torah literature to those times when Israel clashed with the descendants of Amalek in each generation, they never followed that path of genocide even when they could have actually succeeded. There was war and people died, but <em><strong>it was not in an attempt to exterminate the entire people</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>So what does the Torah actually tell us to do? <strong>לֹ֖א תִּשְׁכָּֽח</strong> You will forget the <strong>No!</strong></p>\n<p>What <em>No</em> are we supposed to forget which erases our memory of Amalek? וְלֹ֥א יָרֵ֖א אֱלֹהִֽים That our memory is that Amalek did not fear G-d and we are told to forget the <strong>negative modifier in that memory</strong>. That in so doing it is converted into וְיָרֵ֖א אֱלֹהִֽים and he feared G-d. That in fact, like any predatory animal that stalks its next meal provided by the Creator of us all, it seeks out the weak and weary of the herd.</p>\n<p>That this commandment of erasing the memory of Amalek is about us healing ourselves from the pain and perspective that the suffering we experienced during our long exile was random and senseless. We express this sentiment each day at the close of the Amidah prayer which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל־הַחוֹשְׁבִים עָלַי רָעָה, מְהֵרָה הָפֵר עֲצָתָם וְקַלְקֵל מַחֲשַׁבְתָּם: יִהְיוּ כְּמֹץ לִפְנֵי רוּחַ וּמַלְאַךְ יְיָ דּוֹחֶה. לְמַעַן יֵחָלְצוּן יְדִידֶיךָ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That this too was part of G-d’s plan from the very beginning of Creation and was only for good. That like we learn in connection with the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Simchat_HaRegel_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Story_of_the_Five_Rabbis.1.17?vhe=Otzar_Perushei_Ha-haggadah,_Chida._Jerusalem,_1959&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary of the Chida to the Maggid section of the Haggadah</a>, <em>that the opposite of good does not descend from Above.</em></p>\n<p>שאין רע יורד מלמעלה אך הוא רע מצד המקבלים וזה שאמר אין עוד כו׳</p>\n<p>This is an amazing statement that seems to fly in the face of what is commonly taught about the mitzvah concerning Amalek.</p>\n<p>But consider the details of what the Torah lays before us. Who is Amalek? He is in fact <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/theJewishWoman/article_cdo/aid/669550/jewish/A-Lesson-From-Timna-the-Concubine.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a descendent of Eisav, the brother of Yaacov Avinu through his son Elifaz and Elifaz's concubine, Timna</a>.</p>\n<p>What example do we have from Yaacov Avinu concerning his relationship with his brother, Eisav, who wanted to kill Yaacov?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, Yaacov acted trying to bring his brother to return to G-d's service and even to bring the offerings of Eisav as Korbanot. This is the subject of an incredible series of Chassidic discourses from the Alter Rebbe (בעל התניא ושלחן ערוך) in his <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16069&st=&pgnum=55\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Torah Ohr to parshat VaYishlach</a>. That Yaacov was ready at that time, but Eisav was not yet prepared  for this act of his brother. This would only be accomplished at the time of the final redemption with Melech HaMoshiach, King Moshiach!</p>\n<p>And like we learn from the expression of our Sages,\"<strong>The acts of the Patriarchs <em>(and the Matriarchs)</em> are a paradigm for their descendents.</strong>\"</p>\n<p>That ultimately, the remnant of Eisav, including Amalek, will return to serve G-d and the remnant of Yaacov, who is also called Yisrael and Yeshurun, will bring the offerings of his brother, together with his own in the service of G-d. That Amalek will come to  <strong>Fear G-d</strong>.</p>\n<p>And in so doing, measure for measure, by our forgetting the No connected with Amalek, we reveal and remember the <em>Alufo shel Olam</em> (אלופו של עולם היינו א׳), meaning G-d (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Vayikra.38.269?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, VaYikra 38:269</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Me%27or_Einayim%2C_Vayikra.3?vhe=Me%27or_Einayim_--_OYW&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Me'or Einayim to VaYikra 1:1</a>)  and the Aleph of the throne of G-d's Kingship (הכסא הכבוד מלכותו), which up until this time has been concealed (כִּֽי־יָד֙ עַל־כֵּ֣ס יָ֔הּ) like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.14-16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 17:14-16</a> and which also pertains to this mitzvah, will be revealed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֨אמֶר יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה כְּתֹ֨ב זֹ֤את זִכָּרוֹן֙ בַּסֵּ֔פֶר <strong>וְשִׂ֖ים בְּאׇזְנֵ֣י יְהוֹשֻׁ֑עַ כִּֽי־מָחֹ֤ה אֶמְחֶה֙ אֶת־זֵ֣כֶר עֲמָלֵ֔ק מִתַּ֖חַת הַשָּׁמָֽיִם</strong>׃\nוַיִּ֥בֶן מֹשֶׁ֖ה מִזְבֵּ֑חַ וַיִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖וֹ יְהֹוָ֥ה ׀ נִסִּֽי׃\nוַיֹּ֗אמֶר <strong>כִּֽי־יָד֙ עַל־כֵּ֣ס יָ֔הּ מִלְחָמָ֥ה לַיהֹוָ֖ה בַּֽעֲמָלֵ֑ק מִדֹּ֖ר דֹּֽר</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That <strong>only G-d</strong>, the Creator of us all, <strong>is King</strong>. <strong>There is no other</strong>! אין עוד מלבדו</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So if one keeps Torah and mitzvot unenthusiastically, and believes that it's not possible to get enthusiastic about it, then they have forgotten what Amalek did, and are therefore unaware that Amalek's ideology is making home in their heart. This person should at the very least realise that it is possible - nay imperative - to be completely, wholeheartedly and <em>realistically</em> enthusiastic about life, goodness, Torah, mitzvot, relationships and Hashem. Study the Torah and figure out and be in awe of Hashem's fine details of what is right and wrong, good and bad. Combine with teshuva (a higher-than-reason transformation) and healing; get closer to Hashem, study and <em>taste</em> (Tehillim 34) His goodness, discover the preciousness and meaning that is His objective Self, and His plan and desire, and the life He created for us, the relationships He gave us.</p>\n<p>Stay away from any ideology that tries to homogenize; tries to champion the cause of קרי; meaningless and indiscriminateness; tries to strip out and mock the preciousness of these things, out of Hashem's distinctions and preferences. Know instead that every last detail of everything is infinitely invested with super-rational and beyond-comprehensible meaning, purpose and preciousness - <em>to Him</em>; every atom, every thought, every word, every deed. It's all יקר.</p>\n<p>Learn how to emulate Him and serve Him and His very precious children <em>lishma</em>. It may be super-rational, but it is possible to find it and know it; the greatest of all holy passion is the goodness of making Him and the people we relate to in our lives important and precious to us, closely, personally, intimately, altruistically - when it comes to this, and the meaning and delight of serving people <em>lishma</em>, even the heavens are no limit! Amalek's empty promise that finding meaning only subjectively is all that matters will vanish like smoke, and his memory will indeed be utterly destroyed forever.</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Sacks put it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Faith is a relationship of intersubjectivity, the meeting point of\nour subjectivity with the subjectivity, the inwardness, of God. God is\nthe <em>personal reality</em> of <em>otherness</em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Kedushat%20Levi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this beautiful Kedushat Levi</a> on Ester 3:8, which I came across while researching this answer. Either way, I hope this has aided the question of identifying who Amalek is in 2023, how to spot his ideology, and given a starter into the avodah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rav Eliezer Ben David says that it says to erase Amalek \"from under the heavens\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dvarim 25:19</a>).

    "content": "# Torah as a bar metzra\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 88b</a>, shows a famous dialogue between Moshe Rabbeinu and the melachim, when Moshe ascended to the Heavens, after Matan Torah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: When Moses ascended on High to\nreceive the Torah, the ministering angels said before the Holy One,\nBlessed be He: Master of the Universe, what is one born of a woman\ndoing here among us? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them: He\ncame to receive the Torah. The angels said before Him: The Torah is a\nhidden treasure that was concealed by you 974 generations before the\ncreation of the world, and you seek to give it to flesh and blood? [...]\nThe rightful place of G-d’s majesty, the Torah, is in the heavens.</p>\n<p>[...] The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Moses: Provide them with an\nanswer as to why the Torah should be given to the people. [...] Moses\nsaid before Him: Master of the Universe, the Torah that You are giving\nme, what is written in it? G-d said to him: “I am the Lord your G-d\nWho brought you out of Egypt from the house of bondage” (Exodus 20:2).\nMoses said to the angels: Did you descend to Egypt? Were you enslaved\nto Pharaoh? Why should the Torah be yours? Again Moses asked: What\nelse is written in it? God said to him: “You shall have no other gods\nbefore Me” (Exodus 20:3). Moses said to the angels: Do you dwell among\nthe nations who worship</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are sources that discuss the legal basis of the statement of the angels, and why they, in first instance, \"protested\" the fact that G-d wanted to give the Torah to mankind. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Exodus%2C_Yitro.26.3?vhe=Sefat_emet,_Piotrk%C3%B3w,_1905-1908&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sfas Emes (parashas Yisro)</a>, for example, explains that the legal basis of this can be found in the laws of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.108a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bar Metzra</a>.</p>\n<p>The main focus of the laws of Bar Metzra is, as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Neighbors.12.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> puts it, that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the property should be acquired by the neighbor, instead of the person living further away</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, this was the problem the angels had. They were \"the neighbours\" of the Torah so to speak, they were closer to it than mankind, so why give it to them.</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.108b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 108b</a> says that <strong>a gift is not subject to the laws of Bar Metzra</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to a gift, it is not subject to the halakha of one whose field borders the field of his neighbor, as one can give a gift to whomever he chooses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question is: does the law of bar metzra applies to Torah? Torah is considered a gift (berachos 5a for example). Are there sources that explain that the laws of bar metzra still apply to Torah, or can't this be, since it is an gift?</p>\n<p>(When answering, please support it by sourcing it :))</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah is not only a gift. It's also referred to as an inheritance (מורשה קהלת יעקב, Deut. 33:4) and as a sale (מכרתי לכם תורתי, Shmos Rabbah 33:1). So the issue of bar metzra would still apply to the last of these.</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (Likutei Sichos vol. 18 pp. 28-34, adapted <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/92349/jewish/Shavuos-Responding-to-the-Angels.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) ends up explaining that what negated the angels' argument was that the purpose of the Torah is \"to make a dwelling for G-d in this world,\" and when the non-neighbor plans to use the property to build a house, they have precedence (Bava Metzia 108b).</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Sfas Emes that you mentioned in the question addresses this. Here is the background of the piece:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בלקיחה ניתנה לו יכול יתן דמים ת\"ל מתנות כו'. כי מרע\"ה הי' מוכן לקבל התורה בבחי' לקיחה… אבל הקב\"ה נתן התורה במתנה…. ומן ההר בזכות אבות. לאמר פי' בשביל לאמר לכל הכלל אפי' אותן שאין זוכין לקבל בבחי' לקיחה. רק במתנה. ובזכות אבות. וזה עצמו הב' לשונות כה תאמר כו' ותדבר. כי בית יעקב בבחי' מתנה. ושם ישראל לי ראש בבחי' לקיחה. ובב' הבחינות ניתנה תורה לישראל. לכן מברכין ב' ברכות על התורה אשר קדשנו וצונו לעסוק בד\"ת. בבחי' יגעתי ומצאתי לקיחה. ואשר בחר בנו ונתן לנו במתנה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>as a purchase it was given. Can it be that he actually gave money for it? That’s why it says “gifts” etc. Because Moshe Rabbeinu was ready to receive the Torah with the concept of a purchase… but Hashem gave the Torah to him with the concept of a gift… from the mountain, meaning, in the merit of the forefathers. To say, includes the entire nation even those who can’t merit to receive it as a purchase, rather as a gift in the merit of the forefathers. This is really the two modes of speech that the Torah was given, to say and to tell. Because bais Yakov represents the gift concept and the name Yisroel represents the purchase concept. The Torah was given to the Jews with both concepts and that is why there are two blessings on the Torah. “Who commanded us to toil in torah” represents the purchase concept, “who chose us and gave us the Torah” Is the gift concept</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this background he goes on to explain the piece your bothered by:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאיתא שהמלאכים לא הניחו ליתן התורה לתחתונים. כי באמת הם קרובים אל התורה. ואית בזה משום דינא דבר מצרא. <strong>אבל במתנה ליכא דינא דבר מצרא</strong>. משום שרוצה ליתן לזה ולא לאחר. אבל במכירה כל שהמצרן נותן כמו הלוקח הוא קודם. ולכן מרע\"ה שכחו יפה כמ\"ש נתגששת עם המלאכים. וזכותו רב מזכות העליונים. לכן ניתן לו בלקיחה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for it says that the Angels didn’t want to allow Moshe to receive the Torah because in truth they are closer to the Torah and there is a din of bar Metzra. But for a gift there is no din bar Metzra because he wants to give to this one and not the other. But by a purchase, as long as they both want to pay the same price, there is a din of bar Metzra. So Moshe Rabbeinu who had strong merits was quarreling with the angels, and his merit was greater than the angels, so he was receiving a purchase (and that’s why the din of bar Metzra applied)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>P.S. the translation is my own so please excuse any errors</p>\n\n\n",

Why did the Jews of that time specifically merit to be the\nones to re-accept the Torah? had there been no more deserving period\nof Jewish people prior to the story of Purim?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/145191/jewish/Maamar-Veatah-Tetzaveh.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maamar Ve'atah Tetzaveh</a>, the Rebbe explains that every exile present challenges with regard to observance of the Torah and mitzvos. In the time of Haman, those challenges were great:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the times of Achashverosh, by contrast, the Jews experienced the ultimate of descents. Every exile is associated with a veiling and concealment of G‑dliness. {For all exiles follow the paradigm of the Egyptian exile,28 of which it is written,29 “They did not listen to Moshe because of their dwindled spirits and hard toil.” Similarly, [all subsequent] exiles present several challenges with regard to [the observance of] the Torah and its mitzvos.} In particular, then (in the time of Haman), there was an even greater veiling and concealment [and the very lives of the Jewish people were endangered].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Never­theless, the thought of anything outside [the context of our faith], heaven forbid, did not occur to them.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, they exhibited self-sacrifice in the observance of the Torah and its mitzvos to the extent that they congregated to study Torah communally with self-sacrifice.}</p>\n<p>It was Mordechai, the Moshe of the generation, who inspired this\nself-sacrifice. [On this basis, we can understand the verse] “The Jews\naccepted what they had already begun,” that the giving of the Torah\nwas merely a beginning and their acceptance came at the time of\nHaman’s decree. For their actual expression of self-sacrifice in the\nobservance of the Torah and its mitzvos elevated them (in this regard)\nto a level above that experienced at the giving of the Torah.\nTherefore, this was when the acceptance of the Torah took place, “the\nJews accepted.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Jews were willing to sacrifice their life for their faith. As the Rebbe explains further in the maamar.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe explains that for example, during the Chanukah-story, only a small part showed mesirus nefesh. However, during the Purim-story, the whole of the Jewish people showed mesiras nefesh and took upon theirselves to accept the Torah, even though it was very dangerous to do so at that time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>at the time of Haman’s decree, the entire Jewish people displayed mesirus nefesh</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Frierdiker Rebbe, the previous Rebbe, explains in the Maamar VeKibeil HaYehudim 5687 (1927) <a href=\"http://www.sichos-in-english.org/books/defiance-and-devotion/02.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">that</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the time of exile, everyone is broken and crushed - but it is precisely at such a time that one reaches the [essence of the] luminary itself. This in turn allows us \"to keep a constant light burning.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the time of Purim, there was a huge ammount of mesirus nefesh, as the Midrash Rabbah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.9.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Esther Rabbah 9:4</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>After he erected the gibbet, he went to Mordekhai and found that he was sitting in the study hall with the children sitting before him, with sackcloth on their waists, <strong>engaging in the study of Torah</strong>, and they were screaming and weeping. He counted them and found there twenty-two thousand children. He cast iron chains on them and deployed guards over them. He said: ‘Tomorrow, I will kill these children first and then I will hang Mordekhai.’ Their mothers were bringing them food and water and saying to them: ‘Our children, eat and drink before you die and don’t die hungry.’ <strong>Immediately, they placed their hands on their books and took an oath: ‘By the life of Mordekhai our master, we will not eat and drink, but will die while fasting.’</strong> All of them began weeping loudly until their cries reached the heavens. The Holy One blessed be He heard the sound of their weeping approximately two hours into the night.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How would a person respond when someone treatens him with death if he studies further? The people did not stop studying Torah. No, they continued, accepting the risk. Why? Because the Torah was way more important than their lives. They wanted to live with G-d, no matter what!</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.9.4?lang=bi&with=Etz%20Yosef&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etz Yosef in his commentary</a> to this Midrash actually links the number of students to Matan Torah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושנים עשרים אלף תינוקות. [יש מדרשים אומרים שהכונה בשנים ועשרים אלף תינוקות לשנים ועשרים אותיות באל\"ף בי\"ת ורצה לבטל את מרדכי ותלמידיו מלעסוק בתורה (יפה ענף ועץ יוסף מהדורא קמא)]. ולי נראה שקבץ כמספר הזה שיעסקו בתורה כנגד המלאכים שבאו עם הקב\"ה להר סיני בנתינת התורה לישראל כדכתיב רכב אלהים רבותים אלפי שנאן אדני בם סיני בקדש. וקיבץ תינוקות סך הנ\"ל משום שיהיה הבל פה שאין בו חטא כלל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This whole question could also be linked to the question whether Matan Torah was out of coercion or out of love. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/129385/matan-torah-coercion-or-out-of-love\">See my question here</a>, with fascinating answers. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Shabbat.88a.5.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos</a> on that famous Gemara says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But at the time of Achashverosh, they accepted [it] with their consent from love of the miracle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See similary, the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohev_Yisrael%2C_Parsaht_Zachor_and_Purim.4.2?vhe=Ohev_Yisrael,_Zhitomir,_1863.&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohev Yisrael (Parashas Zachor and Purim)</a>, on the significance of \"accepting out of love\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But even so, they accepted it in the days of Achashveirosh, which was a time of great pain and distance from G-d, and even so, they accepted it upon their souls, even though they were in a very lowly state, and committed to do all that was written in the holy Torah.  And so we find that there was no longer any mitigating claim about the acceptance of the Torah after they accepted it out of the desire of their hearts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, the Emes LiYaakov writes (אמת ליעקב - ברכות, זרעים, מועד):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שבאמת צריכים לשני הענינים, היינו העבודה מאהבה והעבודה מיראה - Sometimes we need worship out of love and also out of fear</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>B\"H when studying the maamar, I've stumbled upon another explanation on why the generation of Mordechai was special (enough) to say that the re-accepted the Torah. In describing Mordechai, the Torah (Esther 2:5) uses the words \"Ish Yehudi\". The Midrash (Esther Rabbah 6:2) says that Moshe Rabbeinu was also called \"ish\" and thus, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther_Rabbah.6.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִישׁ מְלַמֵּד שֶׁהָיָה מָרְדֳּכַי שָׁקוּל בְּדוֹרוֹ כְּמשֶׁה\nבְּדוֹרוֹ - ish  teaches that Mordekhai, in his generation, was the\nequivalent of Moses, in his generation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The maamar then goes on to explain that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the unique quality of Mordechai was that he served as a shepherd of faith for all the Jews of his generation [...] drawing down knowledge to all the Jews in his generation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash goes further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as Moses taught Torah to Israel, as it is written: “See, I have taught you statutes and ordinances” <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.5?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Deuteronomy 4:5)</a>, also Mordekhai did so, as it is written: “Matters of peace and truth” <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.9.30?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Esther 9:30)</a>, and as it is written: “Acquire truth and do not sell” <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.23.23?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Proverbs 23:23)</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yefeh_Anaf_on_Esther_Rabbah.6.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yefeh Anaf (ad loc.)</a>.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe connects the greatness of the Purim-generation to the revelation on Sinai <a href=\"https://www.iggudhashluchim.com/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/1925119/jewish/Torah-The-Secret-of-Jewish-Survival.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(letter from the Rebbe, dated from 11 Teves 5718)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only Jews who have faithfully adhered to the Torah and Mitzvoth, as they were revealed on Mount Sinai, have survived all their persecutors, for only through the Torah and Mitzvoth can the Jewish people attach themselves to the Superior and Supreme Power, G‑d, who has given us the Torah and our way of life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope this answers your first question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chiddushei_Ramban_on_Shabbat.88a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on that Gemara explains that as long as they were in Eretz Yisroel they had to keep the Torah because Hashem gave them the land, even if the acceptance was coerced. However, once they were in galus they were able to claim they were free from keeping the Torah since they no longer have the land.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונ\"ל לומר, דמתחלה אף על פי שהיה להם מודעא מ\"מ לא נתן להם הארץ אלא כדי שיקיימו התורה כמו שמפורש בתורה בכמה פרשיות, וכתיב ויתן להם ארצות גוים ועמל לאומים ירשו בעבור ישמרו חוקיו ותורותיו ינצורו, והם עצמן מתחלה לא עכבו בדבר כלל ולא אמרו במודעא כלום, אלא ברצון נפשם מעצמם אמרו כל אשר דבר ה' נעשה ונשמע, (לפי) [לפיכך] כשעברו על התורה עמד והגלם מן הארץ משגלו מסרו מודעא על הדבר מדכתיב והעולה על רוחכם הי' לא תהי' אשר אתם אומרים נהיה כגוים וכמשפחות האדמה לשרת עץ ואבן, וכדאמרי' באגדה (סנהדרין קה.) רבי' יחזקאל עבד שמכרו רבו כלום יש לו עליו וכו' לפיכך כשבאו לארץ בביא' שניה בימי עזרא עמדו מעצמם וקבלוה ברצון שלא יטענו עוד שום תרעומות, והיינו בימי אחשורוש שהוציאם ממות לחיים, והי' זה חביב עליהם מגאולה של מצרים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this we can understand why they were the first ones who accepted it willfully.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Penei_Yehoshua_on_Shabbat.88a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pnei Yehoshua</a> explains further, that by Har Sinai they said naaseh v’nishma on Torah shebiksav, but not Torah Shebal pe. It was on this that Hashem forced them to accept with the mountain. (I believe there might be a Tosfos somewhere that says this as well, certainly there are others who mention it as well). After the Purim story, they had the first opportunity for a new mitzvah drabbanan, and when they realized that it was hinted at already in the Torah they accepted Torah shebal pe willingly.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד היה נ\"ל דעיקר התנאי במעשה בראשית לא היה אלא על תורה שבכתב אבל כפיית הר כגיגית לא היה אלא בשביל תורה שבעל פה שבשבילה כרת הקב\"ה ברית עם ישראל כדאיתא בפרק הניזקין והיינו מה שאמר הקב\"ה למשה וגם בך יאמינו לעולם ודרשו חז\"ל שבא לרבות הנביאים והזקנים שקיבלו ממשה התורה שבע\"פ לזה הוצרך כפיית הר כגיגית אבל בימי אחשורוש שהאיר הקב\"ה עיניהם שכיוונו ברוח הקודש קריאת המגילה שהיה נרמז בכתב הלוחות כדאיתא בפ\"ב דמגילה דף י\"ט ע\"ב דהא דכתיב ועליהם ככל הדברים וכו' מלמד שכל דקדוקי סופרים אפי' מקרא מגילה הכל מפורש בשום שכל בהלוחות ומש\"ה מסתמא כמו כן קיבלו עליהם כל התורה שבע\"פ כמו תורה שבכתב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, we can understand that the practical way they accepted it willingly was by undertaking the mitzvah drabbanan of Purim.</p>\n<p>I once heard a shiur from R’ Mendel Kessin on this topic, and he explained this idea in detail. He added (if I recall correctly, based on a Ramchal) another thought, that originally they thought that Torah shebal pe was just a way of running a nation in the practical sense. Just like other nations have laws, they thought Hashem wanted them to have these specific laws. That it was basically a set of laws to run society based on the Torah, but not really a part of the Torah itself, and this is what they didn’t accept willingly. However once they went to galus and saw what the nations of the world are capable of, killing out an entire nation in one day, they realized that Torah shebal pe wasn’t merely just a different set of laws, but rather it was a unique part of the Torah itself. Therefore they accepted it willingly.</p>\n\n\n",

It does not conflict with the halacha.</p>\n<p>Essentially, the reason for covering one's head is because of the gemara in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=156b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat (156b)</a> (Credit to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/1172/baal-shemot-tovot\">Baal Shemot Tovot</a> for translation) which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כסי רישיך כי היכי דתיהוי עלך אימתא דשמיא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Cover your head so that there will be on you fear of heavens\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is quoted in the Shulchan Aruch as Halacha (O\"C 2:6). Therefore, as long as you have your yarmulke covering on your head which imbues you with the \"fear of havens\", then you are fulfilling this, and thus, it is not a halachic issue if you have a hat over it.</p>\n<p>It's very common to wear a hat over your yarmulke and many Orthodox and Haredi Jews do it all the time.

It is ordered starting with the wonders of creation, moving onto taking us out of slavery, followed by the miracles needed to bring us into the land of Israel. All of these seem to be ordered chronologically. However, the psalm culminates in thanking Hashem for giving sustenance to all creation (136:25).</p>\n<p>If this psalm is ordered chronologically, where does the penultimate line fit in? If it's not chronological, how is the psalm ordered?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Alshich (quoted as a commentary to the link you posted) provides an explanation, but you have to first read the verse <em>before</em> the penultimate one to understand it.</p>\n<p>The verse before says</p>\n<p>ויפרקנו מצרינו כי לעולם חסדו</p>\n<p>This is commonly translated as \"And He saved us from our enemies for His kindness is eternal.\" However, the Alshich seems to use the more literal translation for מצרינו , which would be \"from our pain\", and understands the verse as follows. When Yehoshua circumcised the Jewish people, that pain stood in place of our lives, and effectively stood as some sort of atonement, saving the Jewish people. Then he goes on to say the part that's relevant to our line: if there is no Jewish people, there is no world. Therefore, He saved us with our pain by circumcision, for \"He renders His kindness to the world\" = כי לעולם חסדו. (Note that he does not translate עולם in the phrase כי לעולם חסדו as \"eternal\", but rather literally, as \"world\". )</p>\n<p>Now for our line (...נותן לחם לכל בשר), he says that after the circumcision, the Jews would not have had anything to eat until the Omer sacrifice would be brought, when they would be allowed to use the newly planted grain in the land (typically Jews can use old grain, but this was the first crop so they didn't have any). Therefore, Hashem miraculously gave them bread until that Passover (when they would be able to offer the Omer), which again saved the Jewish people, which saved the world as we explained with regard to the previous verse. Once again, this is כי לעולם חסדו \"for He renders His kindness to the world\".</p>\n<p>I believe that according to the Alshich, you are right that it's chronological, since he ascribes our line to an event after the events of the previous one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.118a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 118A</a> says that the entire point of this psalm is to extol The kindness of Hashem, that he provided sustenance to the world for 26 generations until the Torah was given:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי: הָנֵי עֶשְׂרִים וְשִׁשָּׁה ״הוֹדוּ״, כְּנֶגֶד מִי — כְּנֶגֶד עֶשְׂרִים וְשִׁשָּׁה דּוֹרוֹת שֶׁבָּרָא הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא בְּעוֹלָמוֹ וְלֹא נָתַן לָהֶם תּוֹרָה, וְזָן אוֹתָם בְּחַסְדּוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: These twenty-six mentions of the word hodu, give praise, in this hallel (Psalms 136), to what do they correspond? He explains: They correspond to the twenty-six generations that the Holy One, Blessed be He, created in His world, and to whom He did not give the Torah. There were ten generations from Adam to Noah, another ten from Noah to Abraham, and six generations from Abraham to Moses and the revelation at Sinai, i.e., Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehat, Amram, and Moses. And why did these generations survive, despite the fact that they did not learn Torah or perform mitzvot? They survived only because God sustained them through His mercy, even though they were undeserving.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, the reason it finishes off with praise for providing sustenance, is because that’s ultimately what we’re trying to praise throughout the 26 phrases.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I seem to recall that same gemara tells us that the very reason Tehillim 136 is called Hallel Hagadol is for that passuk ' nosen lechem lekol basar'.  The miracle of finding sustenance for every living creature at supercedes even the miracles of creation and of yetziat mitzrayim in the eyes of the author of the perek tehillim.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Non Jewish fundraiser working on Shabbos on your behalf\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Motzey Shabbos and Yom Tov I saw that Shabbos morning  I received a fundraising email from a certain well known (controversial)  frum group . Possibly  it was an automatically generated email coming off a sales automation program. Even assuming that is allowed  being that Friday was Yom Tov it’s unlikely that their list is so big that it takes two days to send out a mass  email. This leads me to suspect that their sales automation was possibly activated on Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p>\n<p>The fundraiser who sent it out is not Jewish and probably working on a commission basis with no set hours. Even so the recipients of these emails are probably almost 100% Jewish with a large percent being secular Jews who would look at their emails on Shabbos. Among other potential problems like maaris aiyin.</p>\n<p>Is or isn’t this allowed and why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>This is highly unlikely to be allowed because people will assume the fundraiser is working on Shabbat on behalf of a Jew (which is forbidden).</strong></p>\n<p>R Eliezer Melamed discusses this at length <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/01-25-08/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halakha Shabbat 25:8</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>A non-Jew may only do contract work for a Jew on Shabbat if it is not apparent that the work is being done on a Jew’s behalf.</strong> If it is\napparent, as is the case if the work is being done in the Jew’s home,\nit is forbidden to contract the work to a non-Jew because of marit\nayin. Therefore, the Sages instructed that one should not allow a\nnon-Jewish contractor who is hired to build a home to work on Shabbat,\nsince if people see the contractor working they will think that the\nhomeowner has desecrated Shabbat by hiring a non-Jew to work on\nShabbat (SA 244:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition, depending on the agreement with the non-Jew (whether the money directly benefits the Jew), benefiting from the fundraising is forbidden as R Melamed describes elsewhere in <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/category/01/01-25/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halakha Shabbat 25:1</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The Sages decreed that a Jew may not benefit from a melakha performed\nby a non-Jew for the Jew’s benefit.</strong> For example, if the lights in\none’s home went out, and a non-Jewish neighbor came and turned the\nlights on, neither the Jews living in that home nor any other Jews may\nbenefit from these lights, since they were turned on for a Jew on\nShabbat (SA 276:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146\">consult your rabbi</a>\nshould you want to try something close to this in practice.</p>\n\n\n",

And the priest shall have in his hand the bitter water that causes the curse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On of the \"ingredients\" was מים קדשים - holy water.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.5.17?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bahya (ad loc.)</a> asks the question why specifically water was taken for this \"mixture\". He explains that water symbolizes the Heavens, whereas dust represents the earth.</p>\n<p>However, I was thinking about a Gemara that explains that matters of Torah are likened to water <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.7a.15?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Taanis 7a)</a>.</p>\n<p>Water is likened to Torah, as per the Gemara in Taanis 7a. So I was thinking, maybe it has something to do with the fact that the Sotah, which also translates as the \"wayward wife\" can be a lesson to all of us. If we deviate from the path of Torah, e.g. being \"the wayward son\", we can return by \"drinking the water', e.g. holding on to the Torah. The thing to do is to take water, e.g. to delve into Torah.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there sources that agree with this notion? E.g. that the water can symbolize Torah and the Sotah is deviating from Torah, so what we need to do, is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.55.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"come and drink the water\"</a>?</strong></p>\n<p>(I do not know how to resolve this with the fact that bitter water was brought)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 1:12</a> associates <em>straying</em> with <em>bitter waters</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avtalion used to say: Sages be careful with your words, lest you incur the penalty of exile, and be carried off to a place of <strong>evil waters</strong>, and the disciples who follow you drink and die, and thus the name of heaven becomes profaned.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While little is known about the zug of Shemaya and Avtalyon, who headed the Sanhedrin for about 6 years, one thing that's know is the controversy with Akavia ben Mehalalel, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Eduyot.5.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eduyos 5:6</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He (Akavia ben Mehalalel) used to say: a woman proselyte and a freed slave-woman are not made to drink of the bitter waters. But the Sages say: they are made to drink. They said to him: it happened in the case of Karkemith, a freed slave-woman who was in Jerusalem, that Shemaiah and Avtalion made her drink. He said to them: they made her drink an example (and not the real water).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Akavia ben Mehalalel, the view of Avtalion is that giving bitter waters is done to make a person realize the act of straying, not as a <em>chok</em> - Torah decree. A <em>sota</em> had already been warned by her husband, yet she chose to cause more jealosy. I.e. the holiness of the sotah bitter water stems from bringing the realization of straying to her, make her frighten (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ra%27avad_on_Mishnah_Eduyot.5.6.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">if we go by Raavad</a> for example). Unfortunately, Akavia ben Mehalalel was excommunicated for such a view (among others) as the Mishna continues.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems at first that Yisro had known what took place with regards to the Jewish people and their release from bondage in Egypt. Why then is it necessary for Moshe to repeat to Yisro what he already knew?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim</a> asks the very same question in his commentary to the before-mentioned posuk. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויספר משה לחתנו, Moses told his father-in-law, etc. Although the Torah told us that Yitro had heard all that G-d had done, there may have been some details which he had not heard about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, Yitro had assumed that what he had heard previously was grossly exaggerated; Moses now explained to him that what he heard was true to the last detail. It is also possible that until Moses told him otherwise Yitro had been under the impression that the Israelites were still vassals of the Egyptians, not totally free. Moses told him of the slaying of the guardian angel of the Egyptians, something that Yitro could not have heard about from any other source as only the Israelites had seen the \"dead\" guardian angel (Zohar second volume page 52). Once Yitro heard about this he knew that the Egyptians did no longer have any hold over the Israelites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Or HaChaim further explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the Torah itself alludes to this with the words את כל התלאה אשר מצאתם בדרך ויצילם השם, \"all the travail that had come upon them on the way from which G'd had saved them.\" Seeing Yitro had been a religious leader he would be familiar with the fact that different nations had guardian angels in the celestial regions; Moses told Yitro about the personal pursuit by that guardian angel and how the Israelites had been very frightened of that guardian angel. When Yitro heard about all this he exclaimed: \"blessed be the Lord who has delivered this nation from the hand of Mitzrayim (the guardian angel).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Rashbam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Rashbam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that Moshe told Yisro additional things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התלאה אשר מצאתם בדרך, Pharaoh’s pursuit to the sea, the mannah, and the meat that the Holy One, blessed be He, gave them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, the reason why Moshe needed to repeat the accountings to Yisro, was that what Yisro heard (as stated in v. 1), was from the mouth of a outside. But, when Moshe told him what happened, it was told by someone who was an eye-witness <a href=\"https://alhatorah.org/Two_Accounts_which_Yitro_Heard\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see AlHaTorah)</a>. This can be connected to what the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Targum%20Jonathan%20on%20Exodus&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yehonasan says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Mosheh recounted to his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharoh and to the Mizraee on behalf of Israel; all the hardship they had found in the way, at the sea of Suph, and at Marah, and at Rephidim, and how Amalek had fought with them, and the Lord had delivered them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe told Yisro things, he still hadn't heard. How would the Midianites for example know what the Jewish People experience through all their journeys?</p>\n<p>See also the explanation from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.8?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Toledot%20Yitzchak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldos Yitzchok</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is G-d's 'mind' separate from Him?",
    "content": "# Is G-d's 'mind' separate from Him?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently, I've been studying Neoplatonic philosophy in its Jewish context and the history of Jewish Neoplatonic thought.</p>\n<p>In such a view, some propose that because G-d, blessed be He, is absolutely simple (meaning without 'parts', basically \"oneness\" in the Maimonedean sense), then that'd preclude a \"universal mind\" (universal intellect) that emanates from G-d (and through which G-d acts?) to directly be a part of Him (<a href=\"https://ismailimail.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/image11.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rather than simply within Him</a>).</p>\n<p>I'm asking this question from a Jewish Neoplatonic point of view, so I don't think it counts as comparative religion, however I'm going to link <a href=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FGWHmcSXsAULbvW.jpg:large\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this image</a> which is from an Islamic Neoplatonic perspective just for the illustrative purposes to visually show what I mean by this - if there are any issues, I'll modify the question.</p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that this would theoretically preclude G-d having any direct attributes as has been typically understood in Jewish philosophy I think because if G-d say had an attribute, technically it would mean that He is now composite and thus no longer \"simple\" (and by extension, also not the first principle/unconditioned \"reality\"/\"being\" which would contradict His nature as G-d, blessed be He. Therefore, there could perhaps be only what one can call \"associative attributes\" or maybe even proxy-attributes (though not sure about this - studying this school of philosophy messed up my thought process).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>More clarification of the question from the comments:</p>\n<p>My question is whether universal mind/universal intellect is separate from Him in the same way that e.g. material world is still within Him, but He is transcedental so there is a level of at least 'perceived' separateness even if not in reality. Is His mind separate so G-d, blessed be He -> Uni. Intellect (which coincides and holds all things like universals & abstractions like mathematical objects etc.) -> Universal Soul (which from there works with directing matter and soul creation/development) or all are together but no longer \"simple\"?</p>\n<p>The biggest concern is that if you take that G-d, blessed be He, and His mind are not 'separate' per se, then you no longer have absolute divine simplicity according to Neoplatinism since He would not be both composite and also have different parts be contingent, and thus, by extension no longer the unconditioned/non-contingent \"being\"/\"reality\" for the lack of a better word, and then by extension, no longer Him (G-d, blessed be He, forbid). So it becomes a little confusing to me. Is His mind another creation of His own? Does it even apply here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In the Maimonidean paradigm, there is a spiritual chain of being that begins with God. God contemplates Godself, He is thought thinking itself, mind contemplating itself, God is knower, known and knowing - all of that wrapped up in one. There is no recourse made by God to any of the emanated intelligences.</p>\n<p>In H. Yesode ha-Torah 2:8-11 the Rambam writes (Touger translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All existence, aside from the Creator - from the first form down to a\nsmall mosquito in the depths of the earth - came into being from the\ninfluence of His truth. Since He knows Himself and recognizes His\ngreatness, beauty, and truth, He knows everything, and nothing is\nhidden from Him.</p>\n<p>The Holy One, blessed be He, recognizes His truth and knows it as it\nis. <strong>He does not know with a knowledge which is external to Him in the\nway that we know, for ourselves and our knowledge are not one. Rather,\nthe Creator, may He be blessed, He, His knowledge, and His life are\none from all sides and corners, in all manners of unity.</strong></p>\n<p>Were He to live as life is [usually conceived], or know with a\nknowledge that is external from Him, there would be many gods, Him,\nHis life, and His knowledge. The matter is not so. Rather, <strong>He is one\nfrom all sides and corners, in all manners of unity. Thus, you could\nsay, \"He is the Knower, He is the Subject of Knowledge, and He is the\nKnowledge itself.\" All is one.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>This matter is beyond the ability of our mouths to relate</strong>, [or our]\nears to hear, nor is there [the capacity] within the heart of man to\ngrasp it in its entirety. [In expression of this concept, Genesis\n42:15] states: \"chay (By the life) of Pharaoh\" and [I Samuel 25:26]\nstates \"chay, (By the life) of your soul,\" but [I Samuel, ibid.] does\nnot say: \"chay, (By the life) of God\" but chai Adonai, “As God lives.”\n[This shows] that the Creator and His life are not two, as are the\nlives of living beings or the lives of the angels.</p>\n<p>Thus, <strong>He does not recognize and know the creations in terms of the\ncreations as we know them, but rather He knows them in terms of\nHimself. Thus, since He knows Himself, He knows everything, for the\nexistence of everything else is dependent on Him.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite the tremendous limitations language imposes on us, I will attempt to expand a bit: Being overflowed from God as a result of this self contemplation of God, which the medievals deem \"emanation.\" The \"First Intelligence\" which first emerges in this process, is the first mind outside of God. It contemplates both itself and God - and is where duality can first be identified.</p>\n<p>God, as the Rambam affirms, does not know with a knowledge which is external to Himself. With the main point being that this does not infringe on his Oneness. This is a concept that is difficult, perhaps impossible to relate here, and one which the Rambam deems as subject to the rules of transmission for Ma'aseh Merkabha (see H. Yesode ha-Torah 2:11-12). Hopefully the above citation in tangent with touching upon it in a cursory way here has been helpful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>God's knowledge is not something distinct from his essence. This is explained in depth in Guide for the Perplexed <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp078.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:68</a>. Knowledge (in general, not only that of God) is conception of something's form. A form is what can be intellectually conceived of something. So when the intellect has knowledge of a form, it <em>is</em> that form. Since God is absolutely simple, the object of his conception can only be himself. Hence God is the knower, the known and the knowledge itself.</p>\n<p>On a deeper level, however, we have to realize that when we say God is knowledge, we can't take it to mean that it is the same kind of knowledge we have. As explained at length in <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp156.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:20</a>: \"His knowledge is not of the same kind as ours, but totally different from it and admitting of no analogy.\"</p>\n<p>Our understanding of God's knowledge, like our understanding of every other of God's attributes, has to be understood in terms of what it isn't (<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp070.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:60</a>).</p>\n<p>I believe that with some effort, this is also demonstrable from <a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp070.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:1, fourth argument</a> (paragraph beginning \"The following is likewise a correct method to prove the Incorporeality and the Unity of God\").</p>\n<p>So indeed, to use the Neoplatonic terms, mind has to be understood as emanated from the one, not identical with it. This is also the meaning of the Zohar's statement אַנְתְּ חַכִּים וְלַאו בְּחָכְמָה יְדִיעָא quoted by Yaakov Deane. God is wise, from our perspective, but wisdom is not his essence. What we mean by calling God wise is that \"by the influence of the intellect which emanates from God we become wise, by it we are guided and enabled to comprehend the Active Intellect\" (<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp099.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:13</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For comparison with your image, the closest concept I am aware of in Jewish theology is the concept of mimale, sovev and Atzmus. There seem to be similarities, and differences, however I don't think the Torah fully supports this model. Here is how we understand the concept of Hashem and His mind, and all other angles of this sort*.</p>\n<p>The key pasukim in the Torah for answering this question are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁמַע יִשְׂרָאֵל ה' אֱלֹקֵינוּ <strong>ה' אֶחָד</strong></p>\n<p>Hear Israel, Hashem is our God, <strong>Hashem is One</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:4</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַתָּה הׇרְאֵתָ לָדַעַת כִּי ה' הוּא הָאֱלֹקִים <strong>אֵין עוֹד\nמִלְּבַדּוֹ</strong>׃</p>\n<p>It has been made known to you that Hashem is God, <strong>there is nothing besides Him</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 4:35</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God does not have anything separate from Himself at all, nothing exists separately from Him.</p>\n<p>The Ramchal, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_the_Creator.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 1:1:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פשיטותו: וכן צריך שידע שמציאותו ית' <strong>מציאות פשוט</strong> בלי הרכבה וריבוי כלל\nוכל השלימיות כלם נמצאים בו בדרך פשוט...אך האדון ית״ש איננו בעל כחות\nשונים אעפ״י שבאמת יש בו ענינים שבנו הם שונים כי הרי הוא רוצה <strong>והוא חכם</strong>\nוהוא יכול והוא שלם בכל שלימות אמנם אמתת מציאותו הוא ענין א׳‎ שכולל\nבאמתתו וגדרו (פי׳‎ אמתת ענינו כי אין שייך גדר בו ית׳‎ אלא על צד היתר\nלשון) כל מה שהוא שלימות</p>\n<p>His simplicity: And likewise he must know that His existence, may He\nbe blessed, <strong>is a simple (undifferentiated) existence</strong> without\ncomposition or multiplicity at all. And all of the perfections are\nfound within Him in a simple way...</p>\n<p>...the Master, may His name be blessed, does not have different\ncapabilities, even though He actually has properties that are\ndiffering within us. For surely He is wilful and <strong>is wise</strong> and is\npowerful and He is perfect in every perfection; however the truth of\nHis existence is one matter that includes within His truth and domain\n(meaning the truth of His being, as having a domain is not applicable\nto Him, may He be blessed - rather it is only by way of literary\nlicense) everything that is a perfection</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God is therefore ultimately simple. The word \"wise\" is appropriate for Him, but not because He has a part of Himself called \"wisdom\", but this particular perfection is \"contained within Him in a simple way\" in the \"truth of His existence\", which really doesn't have a domain.</p>\n<p>Tanya Shaar HaYichud VeHa'Emuna, in chapter 9, explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַךְ \"הַנִּגְלוֹת לָנוּ\", לְהַאֲמִין אֱמוּנָה שְׁלֵימָה דְּ\"אִיהוּ\nוְגַרְמוֹהִי חַד\",דְּהַיְינוּ, מִדּוֹתָיו שֶׁל\n<strong>הַקָּדוֹשׁ־בָּרוּךְ־הוּא וּרְצוֹנוֹ וְחָכְמָתוֹ וּבִינָתוֹ וְדַעְתּוֹ\nעִם מַהוּתוֹ וְעַצְמוּתוֹ</strong>, הַמְרוֹמָם לְבַדּוֹ <strong>רוֹמְמוּת אֵין קֵץ\nמִבְּחִינַת חָכְמָה וְשֵׂכֶל וְהַשָּׂגָה</strong>.וְלָכֵן, גַּם יִחוּדוֹ\nשֶׁמִּתְיַיחֵד עִם מִדּוֹתָיו שֶׁהֶאֱצִיל מֵאִתּוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ, גַּם\nכֵּן אֵינוֹ בִּבְחִינַת הַשָּׂגָה לְהַשִּׂיג אֵיךְ מִתְיַיחֵד בָּהֶן.\nוְלָכֵן נִקְרְאוּ מִדּוֹתָיו שֶׁל הַקָּדוֹשׁ־בָּרוּךְ־הוּא – שֶׁהֵן\nהַסְּפִירוֹת – <strong>בַּזֹּהַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ: \"רָזָא דִמְהֵימְנוּתָא\"</strong>, שֶׁהִיא\nהָאֱמוּנָה שֶׁלְּמַעְלָה מִן הַשֵּׂכֶל</p>\n<p>but it is incumbent upon us to believe with complete faith matters\nthat are revealed to us—that He and His attributes, [viz., the vessels\nand sefirot, including His mind], are One. I.e., the attributes of <strong>the\nHoly One, blessed be He, and His will, and His wisdom and\nunderstanding and knowledge, [are One] with His Essence and Being</strong>, Who\nalone <strong>is exalted by infinite elevations above the level of wisdom and\nintellect and comprehension</strong>. Hence, [since He totally transcends\nintellect and comprehension,] His union with the attributes which He\nemanated from Himself is also beyond the realm of comprehension;\n[i.e., it is impossible] to understand how He unites with them;\n[rather, this may be apprehended only through faith.] <strong>In the holy\nZohar, therefore, the attributes of the Holy One, blessed be He, which\nare the sefirot, are called “the secret of faith,”</strong> which is the faith\nthat transcends intellect.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam states in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_1.46.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim 1:46</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמנם פעולותיו – בעצמו לא בכלי. והכוחות באין ספק מכלל הכלים; אם כן\n<strong>אינו בעל כח – כלומר: שיהיה בו ענין זולת עצמו</strong> בו יעשה או <strong>ידע</strong> או ירצה</p>\n<p>His actions are accomplished by His Essence, not by any organ, and as\nundoubtedly physical forces are connected with the organs, <strong>He does not\nposses any such forces, that is to say, He has, besides His Essence</strong>,\nnothing that could be the cause of His action, <strong>His knowledge</strong>, or His\nwill.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wisdom is something we accomplish with a faculty of wisdom, but Hashem is only His Essential Self, and it is His Essence that \"accomplishes wisdom\" so to speak.</p>\n<p>The Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bo.15.223\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bo 15</a>) puts it like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָתַר עָבֵד מָאנָא זְעֵירָא, וְדָא י', <strong>וְאִתְמַלְיָא מִנֵּיהּ, וְקָרָא\nלֵיהּ מַעְיָן נוֹבֵעַ חָכְמָה, וְקָרָא גַּרְמֵיהּ בָּהּ חָכָם</strong></p>\n<p>Then He shaped a vessel diminutive as the letter Yod and <strong>filled it\nfrom Him, and called it Wisdom-gushing Fountain, and called Himself\nwise on its account</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He doesn't need wisdom to be wise. Remember, He brought forth wisdom from nothing, or more accurately, from Himself.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>So does God have a mind separate from Himself? <strong>No.</strong></li>\n<li>Is God wise, knowing, intelligent, conscious? <strong>We can't say no.</strong></li>\n<li>Can we understand those things? <strong>Yes and no.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As HaLeivi put very well in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/95427/31534\">this answer</a>, we cannot exclude these perfections from Hashem's Essence, but at the same time, as the sources I've quoted say, they are one with Him in a way we can only be admiring of.</p>\n<p>Rambam says it explicitly in Yesodei Torah 2:10:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא מַכִּיר אֲמִתּוֹ וְיוֹדֵעַ אוֹתָהּ כְּמוֹ\nשֶׁהִיא. <strong>וְאֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ בְּדֵעָה שֶׁהִיא חוּץ מִמֶּנּוּ</strong> כְּמוֹ\nשֶׁאָנוּ יוֹדְעִין.</p>\n<p>Hashem is aware of His own reality and knows it as it is. <strong>He does not\nknow with a mind that is distinct from Himself</strong>, as we know...</p>\n<p>וְדָבָר זֶה אֵין כֹּחַ בַּפֶּה לְאָמְרוֹ וְלֹא בָּאֹזֶן לְשָׁמְעוֹ\nוְלֹא בְּלֵב הָאָדָם לְהַכִּירוֹ עַל בֻּרְיוֹ</p>\n<p>This concept is beyond the capacity of the mouth to articulate, the\near to hear, or the human mind to fully comprehend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can't understand how thoroughly one Hashem is, because it is infinitely so, and it is not something our brains can wrap around even so. However, the words in the second pasuk quoted; אַתָּה הׇרְאֵתָ לָדַעַת, is explained by the Rebbe Rashab to mean that He somehow has made Himself knowable. We can climb a ladder of emulating Hashem and getting to know Him, with Torah study and mitzvot observance, and we will become more Godly ourselves and learn bit by bit what it means to be essential, and one, to whatever limited degree Hashem as decreed us to access.</p>\n<p>The same Rebbe wrote <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/85424/jewish/Maamar-VeYadaata.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a ma'amar</a> explaining the remaining words in that pasuk; כִּי ה' הוּא הָאֱלֹקִים, that really, Hashem has accomplished including His Essence completely in the mashal that He has made. We may not access the Nimshal in this life, but we should be assured that the mashal is authentically Him, and through it we can get to know Him completely; this type of mashal does not \"lose information\", the whole Nimshal makes it in!</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* - It should be stressed here that we are talking about Hashem, blessed be He, and this topic must be treated with great respect and care. We are talking about Him, not a theological concept, and, l'havdil, in the same way a person wouldn't want to overhear someone discussing things very close and personal to them, it can be disrespectful and hurtful to do so to Hashem, if done impersonally and without awe and sensitivity. This is why I will now skip directly to the words of Torah on this matter.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Please see MB O\"C 422:4 there where he states that one should repeat even after Mussaf with a conditional arrangement to satisfy the disagreement about Mussaf rectifying or not. But the Psak there appears to me to say that it should be repeated with that arrangement. I am not sure why the Tashlumin without Yaaleh Vayavo would change the matter?</p>\n<p>I will say that Shulchan Aruch HaRav does not require one to repeat after Mussaf. Perhaps if you are Chassidic this would change the psak, this is why I think people do not offer Psak here.</p>\n<p>I suppose you want to know whether the Mussaf mention of Rosh Chodesh can work if you said Mussaf before Shacharis (ie: the make up is said after Mussaf).</p>\n<p>The best I could find is in O\"C 126, B\"Y</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב הרא״ש שאם לא הזכיר בתפלת המוספין חוזר ולא סמכינן על מה שהזכיר\nבשחרית דדוקא אתפלה שעדיין לפניו סמכינן ולא על התפלה שהזכיר בה כבר ולא\nסמכינן נמי על מה שיכול לומר במנחה כי דוקא בשחרית ומוסף שרגילים להתפלל\nכאחד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here the B\"Y mentions the Rosh that states that when one makes a mistake in Mussaf he needs to go back, he can only rely on a prayer that happens after, and not in mincha since that is not said together. That being said it would be worthwhile to check the Pri Magadim because I saw a quote that might imply he is more lenient.</p>\n<p>Lamdus: So imo the repetition of the Amidah would depend on two things, is the first amidah for shachris batul then Mussaf can't help, for example it was wrong and NEEDS repeating or is it that something was missed and so to add that back in he repeats the whole Amidah, but the first Amidah was good and fixed by Mussaf. Yaaleh VeYavo might be like this (disagreement between Tosfot and Rif in Berachos - from memory).</p>\n<p>TLDR: It should be repeated with a condition that it might be a nedava see MB mentioned above.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is it an offensive stereotype that Jews tend to stick together?",
    "content": "# Is it an offensive stereotype that Jews tend to stick together?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I thought maybe this belonged on the Academia Stack Exchange, but then I thought I should ask the people directly, as I assume the highly ranked people on here are either Jewish or very familiar with Jews. And, I hope this question isn't offensive asking in and of itself. I've had this question ever since I was a kid, but the couple times I met a Jewish person (at least, that they informed me of) I was too scared to ask as I didn't want to offend anyone. Then, I saw an <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/resources/report/antisemitic-attitudes-usa-guide-adls-latest-poll\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Anti-Defamation League poll</a> saying that X percent of Americans hold one or more offensive stereotypes about Jews, and one of those offensive stereotypes listed is that \"Jews stick together more than other Americans.\" And, this confuses me, because, to me, this sounds like a positive stereotype. Like Asians being good with computers or black guys having large penes. Perhaps it will make sense if I explain how I encountered this anti-semitic trope.</p>\n<p>The first two times I encountered this trope, as a kid, was by two black women, lamenting the state of the black community, and saying they needed to emulate the Jews more; i.e. they need to look out for one another more. And, one of these women was in Minneapolis, MN while the other was in Cocoa, FL. One I overheard, the other said it to a group of students, though I can't really remember much about the context. The first time was when I was in 5th grade, the second was 4 years later in 8th grade (I was held back because, I got expelled; long irrelevant story). It was in opposite parts of the country, so I know this belief is not unheard of.</p>\n<p>I never thought about it after the first time, because like I said, I only ever had the opportunity to talk to 2 professed Jews. Then, when I heard it the second in FL, it just kind of pinged in my head that I heard this before. Then, as an adult, when I was in the Army, I heard it again, though I don't remember much about the context. By this time, I was in contact with no professed Jew (by professed, I should clarify; I am sure I came into contact with lots of Jews in my life, but \"What is your religion\" is not a topic that comes up much). So, the question of what they thought about this trope lingered. Finally, I saw the poll not long ago and the question festered.</p>\n<p>The reason I felt the need to explain WHY I have had this question is because I have noticed that questions dealing with Jews on various Stacks (particularly History, though some others as well) tend to be sensitive, and I want to show that I am not trying to spread lies. That being said, it does appear that Jews tend to stick together more than most Americans. Again, I am not sure that is a bad thing. For example, most Jews support Israel (though it could also be said that <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/390737/americans-pro-israel-though-palestinians-gain-support.aspx#:%7E:text=Israel%20Maintains%20High%20Favorable%20Rating&text=Seventy%2Done%20percent%20of%20U.S.,opinion%20of%20the%20Palestinian%20Authority.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>most Americans</em> support Israel</a>). Also, there are a disparate number of Jews in positions of high authority (though I believe this is explained by Judaism' historical dependence on literacy, and later encouragement of higher education). Then, I read something a long time ago, the specifics of which I forget. But it basically went that Ashkenazi (could be hasidic or other type of Jew, I will not pretend to know the difference) Jews had raised their average IQ points some absurd number over some seemingly short period of time. Regardless of how questionable that \"stat\" is, there is no denying Ashkenazi Jews have a higher than average IQ. I even found a pretty plausible explanation of how this occurred during the Middle Ages (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16867211/#:%7E:text=Ashkenazi%20literacy%2C%20economic%20specialization%2C%20and,intelligence%20but%20not%20spatial%20ability.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Natural history of Ashkenazi intelligence</a>)</p>\n<p>So my question is, what do Jews think about this trope? Is it offensive? Is it true/untrue? Specifically, it would be interesting to see a survey of Jews to see what they think about this.</p>\n<p>Now, it did occur to me while writing this that, if taken to the extreme, the trope becomes harmful. Like, if people start to think that not only do Jews stick together, they do so at the expense of others, this could lead to a kind of \"Screw them; they only help themselves; why should we help them?\" mentality. So, maybe that is why it is seen as offensive, but my only times encountering it is when people were commending Jewish people. I really would like to receive however long an education on this as anyone is willing to give. Again, I hope I didn't offend anyone with this.</p>\n<p>As far as what I have tried to answer this question, I have tried several versions of \"Survey on Jewish People\" \"about anti-Semitic tropes\". I got some surveys on Jewish people, such as <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2021/05/11/jewish-americans-in-2020/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a Pew Poll on Jewish Americans</a>. While it does briefly mention anti-semitic tropes (saying that 30% of Jews experienced an anti-semitic trope in person), it says nothing about specific tropes, other than to give the example of \"Jews care too much about money\".</p>\n<p>I also found the American Jewish Committee's <a href=\"https://www.ajc.org/Jewish-Millennial-Survey-2022/American-Jewish-Millennials\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Survey of American Jewish Millennials</a>, which together with the AJC's <a href=\"https://www.ajc.org/Jewish-Millennial-Survey-2022/Israeli-Jewish-Millennials\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Survey of Israeli Jewish Millennials</a> had some interesting insights, but nothing about specific anti-semitic tropes. Similarly, Jewish Electorate Institute's <a href=\"https://www.jewishelectorateinstitute.org/2022-national-survey-of-jewish-voters/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">April 2022 National Survey of Jewish Voters</a>, provided some uplifting (from my perspective at least) views, but again, nothing on specific tropes. I could go on like this for several different surveys, but none of them reveal anything about this specific trope. Thanks for any insight.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is a good question. No I am not offended, but it is hard to offend me.</p>\n<p>I see two types of stereotypes:</p>\n<p><strong>1).</strong> Untrue ones, usually an incident leaves an impression and that is applied to the group and back to other individuals. (ie: untrue even to the group, but certainly to the other individuals).</p>\n<p><strong>2).</strong> Ones that are statistically true about the group.</p>\n<p>I personally think that generalities applied to an individual whether positive or negative are \"stereotypes\" ie: options 1 and 2. In that sense they are not \"true\" to the individual.</p>\n<p>However, type 2, stereotypes that are documented to be generally true might have some useful information about the group or there situation etc.... It likely has some useful applicable knowledge. For example certain genetic illnesses affect European Jews, a true stereotype of the group, but not necessarily true of any individual or even the majority, but enough of a minority to be more common then the general population.</p>\n<p>So although it is a \"stereotype\" that Jews stick together, I do think it has some truth in general (ie: type 2). Though many Jews are sometimes the Jewish people's worst enemy, so certainly not always true.</p>\n<p>I actually think that usually when one Jew is on trial, we all feel that we are all on trial, and in fact usually that is what would happen. One Jew would be accused and all Jews in the city would be attacked even if that individual went to trial and received a punishment. Similarly in Israel one Jew does something wrong, he is brought to court and punished, but even still it is reported that all Jewish people are somehow evil.</p>\n<p>I also personally think of other Jewish people as extended family, but with so few Jews in the world, that might not be far off.</p>\n<p>I would presume most groups who form around a central idea/principle do feel a bond and unity though. It is certainly sad if a person feels they are part of a group where no one cares about each other.</p>\n<p>Is it a trope? Probably in the sense that it has been used in the past many times to attack the Jews. For example that the Germans claimed Jews didn't fight for them in WW1, even though they did, or that they betrayed Germany even though they didn't etc.... But that being said it can be used as a trope, it can be used as a stereotype, and it can be used different ways.</p>\n<p>Did that help?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>For what it's worth, this Jew is proud to say that we stick together.</p>\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/amp/s/collive.com/shliachs-ploy-to-sneak-in-kosher-food-for-stranded-passengers/amp/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a good example</a>. A local religious Jewish couple bought plane tickets to be able to bring food to other Jewish passengers who were stranded in the airport without kosher food.</p>\n<p>Of course, one off events aren't the half of it. Jewish-run support programs include <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatzalah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hatzalah</a>, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shomrim_(neighborhood_watch_group)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shomrim</a>, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaverim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chaverim</a>, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">various Gemach programs</a>, and much more.</p>\n<p>It's worth checking out all of these links.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that all of these will help non Jews if they call, with the possible exception of Gemach. They are Jewish in the sense that they mainly recruit Jews to help, have an ethical board that consists of Rabbis, and advertise only in the Jewish community.</p>\n<p>The idea of helping each other out comes not only from a sense of familial bond, but also from religious values which emphasize it.</p>\n<p>So in short, I for one don't find the trope offensive at all. Although it is true that this trope is sometimes used to imply that a certain amount of Jewish favoritism makes its way into hiring decisions, which can unfairly prevent someone qualified from being hired, that criticism ... is not entirely unfair. It isn't hateful per se because it's true sometimes. That said, it's not like Jews will find a Jewish owned company, say they are Jewish and expect to be hired. I've been rejected from Jewish businesses more times than I can count because someone else was more qualified, just like anybody else.</p>\n\n\n",

An Interview with Rabbi Menachem Perl, Head of the Tzomet Institute</a> writes that Rabbi Menachem Perl, head of the Tzomet Institute for Technology and Halacha, declared that, under certain conditions, a robot could write a kosher Sefer Torah (my edit: I do not totally agree with what is written in this interview, but it shows an interesting perspective on this subject).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In my humble opinion, there isn’t any real halachic obstacle to a robot writing [a Sefer Torah] provided that a sofer manually operates the writing of each letter – by, for example, pressing a button – and writes the names of Hashem.</p>\n<p>However, since there is a considerable amount of innovation in this\nhalachic understanding, the leading halachic authorities of the\ngeneration will have to give their consent to any practical\napplication of it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the writer needs to have kavannah and yirias shimayim. How can a robot then fulfill the job?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The writing must be for the sake of the mitzvah, and kavanah is especially required when writing the names of Hashem. But my assertion is that if a scribe with yirat shamayim operates the robotic mechanism and the computer controlling it – and he himself writes the holy names with the necessary intention – the Sefer Torah will be completely kosher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Related sources: <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1525&st=&pgnum=365\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Yitzchak</a> (brought down in a comment <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/93609/why-cant-a-sefer-torah-be-written-by-a-machine#\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>Maybe the principle of chadasha assur min HaTorah applies here? Any thoughts?</p>\n<p>One of the problems, halachically speaking, would be that the Bach says that before writing the words down, it needs to be vocalized (please add-in any sources, I could not find it at hand) - see <a href=\"https://rabbidunner.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CAN-A-ROBOT-BE-JEWISH.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article from Rabbi Dunner</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hmmm...</p>\n<p>See Keset HaSofer Perek 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>או אשה או חרש או שוטה או קטן פסולי' ויגנזו שנא' וקשרתם וכתבתם ודרשינן\nכל שישנו בקשירה ישנו בכתיבה וכל שאינו בקשירה\n... It says \"you shall bind them and write them\", this is darshaned whomever can tie can write whomever cannot tie cannot write</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So a robot has no mitzvas and cannot write a kosher sefer Torah. The other answer by Shmuel quotes someone saying it can be used as a writing implement - I suppose.</p>\n<p>However this is debatable please see Keset HaSofer 3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הקולמס אעפ\"י שלאחר שעשה בה מלאכתה אינה ניכרת כלל בכתב. מ\"מ צריכין\nלדקדק שתהא קולמס נאה. יש אומרים שיש לכתוב בקולמס של קנה ולא בנוצה ואין\nנוהגין כן אלא כותבין בנוצה ואפי' בקולמס של ברזל. ויש להסתפק אם מותרין\nלכתוב בנוצה של עוף טמא (דב\"ש סוף סי' קס\"ד): ...There are those who say you should write with a reed and not a feather, but that is not the minhag; rather, we write with a feather or an iron quill</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although this appears to permit a metal pen, it is clear that it should be a feather quill from a kosher animal as that is something kosher like the klaf etc... We can see from this though that what is written with does matter, it is not just an extension.</p>\n<p>Also see the end there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מעשה היה באחד שהיה גדם ותפס את הקולמס בשפתיו וכתב ופסלו אפי' באם אי\nאפשר למצוא אחרים מפני שאין דרך כתיבה כלל בפה (הרמ\"ע סי' ל\"ח):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There was an incident where an amputated man wrote with his mouth and it was decided to be pasul even if no other version can be found, because this is not the way of writing.</p>\n<p>So after all of that, I don't think that pressing a button is called a way of writing ink on paper.</p>\n<p>I didn't read the aformentioned linked article, but also in pure logic, I can see how the written Torah (via robot) can be ascribed to the button pusher, ie: he caused the ink to be put on the Torah, but I don't see how it could be called \"writing\". Ie: He didn't write it, he at best caused it to be written. I don't know if that is enough.</p>\n\n\n",

However I think it is slightly more nuanced, and this halakhah is balanced against דע מה שתשיב לאפיקורוס - knowing how to respond to an Apiqores (Abboth 2:14).</p>\n<p>The Rambam (Perush ad loc) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שתלמד דעות האומות לדעת איך תשיב עליהם, השמר שלא יעלה בלבך דבר\nמן הדעות ההם, ודע שמי שתעבוד לפניו יודע צפון לבך, והוא אמרו ודע לפני\nמי אתה עמל, רצה לומר שיכוין לבו באמונת השם יתברך</p>\n<p>Even though you study the opinions of the nations to know how to\nrespond to them, take care that nothing of those opinions arise in\nyour heart, and know that the One before whom you worship knows the\ndirection of your heart, and as it is said, \"and know before whom you\nlabor\", which is to say that you should direct your heart to belief in\nGod.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed the Rambam makes clear in the Moreh (3:29) that he has studied all of the idolatrous works of the Sabeans. Facially this would appear to contradict the halakhah as he restates it in AZ 2:2, but with Abhoth 2:14 born in mind makes perfect sense.</p>\n<p>To bolster this point and perhaps add a caveat, the Ribhash wrote concerning the Rambam (Vol 1, Res. 45):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי הוא למד קודם לכן כל התורה כולה בשלימות: הלכות ואגדות, תוספתא, ספרא\nוספרי וכוליה תלמודא. בבלי וירושלמי, כמו שנראה מספר משנה-תורה שחיבר,\nוכדי להשיב את האפיקורס...כשהתלמיד אדם גדול מותר שיבור פסולת וישליך\nהפסולת, כמו שאמרו שם \"ר\"מ רימון מצא, תוכו אכל קלינתו זרק\"</p>\n<p>For he had prior learned the entirety of the Torah, halakhoth,\naggadoth, Tosefta, Sifra, Sifri, the Babylonian and Jerusalem Talmuds,\nas is apparent from his composition of the Mishneh Torah, and [he\nstudied external works] in order to respond to the Apiqores... and\nwhen the student is a man of great standing he is permitted to peel\naway the shell and cast it away, as our Sages taught (Hagigah 15b) R.\nMeir found a pomegranate and ate its contents while throwing away its\npeel [i.e. studied halakhoth from the heretic Aher].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Ribhash, in order to engage in the process of learning such external works for the purpose of knowing how to respond to an Apiqores, one must already be at a high caliber of learning in their Torah. Then they may engage in a discerning process of תוכו אכל קליפתו זרק - consuming the valuable innards and tossing the outer peel/shell, which can be toxic/injurious.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, it would seem that before reading such a work one ought be very honest with themselves about a) what is the purpose of their study, b) even if a legitimate reason motivates them - what is the leaning of their heart? and c) per the Ribhash, is one on a level of Torah mastery such that they can competently discern what to keep and what to toss.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Rambam explicitly forbids this in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.2.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 2:2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The worshipers of false gods have composed many texts concerning their\nservice, [describing] what is the essence of their service, what\npractices are involved, and what are its statutes. <strong>The Holy One,\nblessed be He, has commanded us not to read those books at all, nor to\nthink about them or any matters involved with them.</strong></p>\n<p>It is even forbidden to look at the image of an idol, as [Leviticus\n19:4] states: \"Do not turn to the idols.\" In this regard, [Deuteronomy\n12:30] states: \"[Be careful]... lest you seek to find out about their\ngods, saying, 'How did they serve them.' <strong>This prohibits inquiring\nabout the nature of their service even if you, yourself, do not serve\nthem.</strong> This matter will ultimately cause you to turn to [the false god]\nand worship it as they do, as [the above verse continues]: \"so that I\nwill do the same.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The question whether to read a Christian translation of the Old Testament (the Torah) <a href=\"https://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/halacha-hashkafa/is-it-proper-in-looking-up-a-pasuk-online-the-first-result-one-gets-is-usually-the-king-james-translation-or-another-christian-translation-can-one-use-this-translation-if-the-pasuk-isnt/2021/03/10/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">was asked by the Jewish Press</a> to many religious authorities.

One proof is MB <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.46.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">46:14</a> that says such a bracha can be counted towards 100 Brachos required daily, but it’s not recommended to do so:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתב המ\"א דלא יכניס עצמו בחשש ברכה שאינה צריכה משום מצות ק' ברכות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another case that is similar to this, is if someone makes a bracha on something before he washes, he can eat the food even though it’s a bracha sh’eino tzricha (and assur to do, but it still works) as the MB calls it in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.211.29?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">211:28</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאי מיירי בשאר תבשילין בלאו טעמא דברכת המוציא חשובה צריך לברך תחלה על הפת ולפטור ממילא את התבשיל דאי יברך תחלה על התבשיל נמצא גורם ברכה שא\"צ ואסור [מ\"א]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.215.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">215:4</a> calls a bracha sh’eino tzricha saying Hashem name in vain and not to answer amen:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המברך ברכה שאינה צריכה הרי זה נושא שם שמים לשוא והרי הוא כנשבע לשוא ואסור לענות אחריו אמן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The MB there <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.215.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">215:18</a> includes in the list of examples, one who makes a bracha before washing for a meal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד כתבו הפוסקים דאפילו אם עכשיו לא היה הברכה לבטלה ג\"כ היא לפעמים בכלל ברכה שאינה צריכה כגון אם שלחנו ערוך לפניו ודעתו לילך וליטול ידיו ולאכול ולוקח קודם הנטילה ומברך על דברים שדעתו לאכלם בתוך הסעודה ג\"ז אסור דגורם ברכה שאינה צריכה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, he doesn’t mention that the person cannot eat it because he didn’t make a bracha. It seems that although it’s assur, and you shouldn’t answer amen, it still works to let you eat. If so it should work for food that was on the table as well.</p>\n\n\n",

So by answering this question about what's \"in it for me to do this\", I am not meaning to invalidate this point that it's not about us in the first place :)</p>\n<p>Rav Melamed states the following in Peninei Halachah, Simchat Habayit U'Virchato\n4:3:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שני צדדים ישנם בעוון הוצאת זרע לבטלה. מהצד הגלוי, הוא פחות חמור מחטאי\nניאוף ושאר החטאים שקצבה עליהם התורה עונשים, מפני שבפועל הנזק שנגרם\nממנו פחות חמור. אולם מהצד הפנימי, חטא זה מבטא את שורש כל הרעות, את שיא\nהתאווה האנוכית שפוגעת באופן העמוק ביותר באמונה בה' ובאהבת הבריות. שכבר\nלמדנו (א, ה-ו), שהפירוד הוא יסוד הקלקול שבעולם. הוא מתחיל בריחוק שבין\nהבורא לנבראים ונמשך לפירוד שבין הברואים. ולכן מצוות \"וְאָהַבְתָּ\nלְרֵעֲךָ כָּמוֹךָ\" היא \"כלל גדול בתורה\" (ויקרא יט, יח, ספרא שם), שעל\nידה מתקנים את העולם כולו. ורק בין בני הזוג מצוות האהבה והאחדות מתקיימת\nבשלימות, ותמציתה בחיבור שבמצוות עונה (לעיל א, א). וזה עניינו של יצר\nהחיים הזה שבין איש לאשה, שעל ידו בני הזוג פורצים את חומת האנוכיות,\nומתקשרים זה אל זה באהבת אמת, והשכינה שורה ביניהם, וחיים וברכה נמשכים\nעל ידם ממקור החיים ועד סוף כל הדורות (לעיל א, ד).</p>\n<p>There are two\ndimensions of the sin of masturbation. On the surface, it is less\nsevere than adultery and the other sins for which the Torah prescribes\npunishment, because, in practice, the damage caused thereby is not as\ngrave. However, from the interior perspective, this sin reflects the\nroot of all evil, the ultimate self-centeredness, which most\nprofoundly impairs a person’s faith in God and his love for other\npeople. As we have seen, detachment is at the root of all ruin in this\nworld (1:5-6). It begins with the distancing between the Creator and\nHis creations, and continues with detachment among His creatures. This\nis why the mitzva to “love your fellow as yourself” (Vayikra 19:18) is\na “major principle of the Torah” (Sifra ad loc.), for it repairs the\nwhole world. It is only in the spousal relationship that love and\nunity reach their complete fulfillment, and its essence is when they\nunite in the mitzva of ona (above, 1:1). This is the meaning of the\nlife-giving impulse that exists between husband and wife, through\nwhich the couple breaks the walls of egotism and connects with one\nanother with true love. The Shekhina dwells with them, and through\nthem, life and blessing extend forth from Source of life to all future\ngenerations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven't highlighted anything in specific because I think the entirety of this should be read. Aside from the previous sections that detail how it is <strong>likened to murdering one's children</strong>, it <strong>prevents one from greeting the Divine presence</strong> and having <strong>eternal life</strong>, and is <strong>impossible to repent for</strong>* (Zohar I 219b, 62a, SA EH 23:1), the root of all of the above comes from the darkening of one's soul and body that comes from this particular sin.</p>\n<p>What it does most powerfully is it makes one self centered**, which blocks one from being able to relate to God, and Godly goodness, i.e. connection with true love. The true goodness and pleasure of Ona, which is what this aspect of our body and soul is <em>designed for</em>, cannot be accessed. It's a bitter irony, when a person seeks sexual pleasure, they are able to steal a tiny remnant of a memory of it, but the price they pay is they never actually get to experience it properly as the enjoyment of the mitzva of Ona is lost to them. They lose the very thing they want.</p>\n<p>It dulls the soul*** and the body and life becomes uninteresting, tasteless, numb, all the vitality of their body that they remember from before they did this sin is nothing but an occasional nostalgic memory. The disconnection is the beginning of the end, as cynicism and apathy to life <em>is death</em>, and the beginning of everything on \"that side\", ch'v.</p>\n<p>Ta'anug, pleasure, actually is the highest of the high of spirituality and even Godliness. It's the inner aspect of the crown of the sefirot, and it's expression in intimate relationships is the pinnacle of its holy purpose, so to speak, and this is similar to what Rambam stated in the source brought by Shmuel in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135137/31534\">his answer</a>.

    "content": "# The victory over Amalek after the Yam Suf, was this \"above nature\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Surely it goes without saying that the miracles of the plagues and the splitting of the sea were \"above nature\" (Being manifest through יהוה).</p>\n<p>Question: was the victory which the Jews had over Amalek after the crossing of the sea, was this victory also \"above nature\"?</p>\n<p>Or was it enclothed within nature, similar to the story of Purim.</p>\n<p><strong>All answers are welcome, please cite any sources - direct links are preferred.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Rosh Hashanah (29a) elaborates the posuk in which it says that when Moshe's hands were lifted up, they prevailed, when they were down, they \"failed\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did the hands of Moses make war when he raised them or break war when he lowered them? Rather, the verse comes to tell you that as long as the Jewish people turned their eyes upward and subjected their hearts to their Father in Heaven, they prevailed, but if not, they fell.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rashbam on the posuk in Shemos (17:11) explains that it had a physological effect:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וגבר ישראל, it is a psychological axiom that when the warriors see their flag being held aloft they are inspired with additional courage. When they cannot see their flag being held aloft they interpret this negatively and are liable to flee from the battlefield.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the commentary of the Tur HaAroch (ad loc.):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Joseph Kimchi explains that the words וכאשר יניח ידו do not describe something that Moses actually did, but these words describe that Moses knew that he could not afford to allow his hands to rest, else Amalek would prove victor, and that in order to forestall such an eventuality, he took Aaron and Chur with him from the start to help him support his hands.     Some commentators understand Moses’ raising his hands as referring to the hands with which he was holding his staff as a sign of encouragement to the people. Moses’ staff meant for the people what the flag means to gentile troops. Generally, the purpose of the flag is to serve as a point around which the troops position themselves, to prevent being scattered by opposing forces. The description of Moses being placed in an elevated position even while seated, is to signify that Moses performed the function that a flag normally performs in a battle. This explains why Moses called the altar he built after the battle ה' ניסי. He did not want the people to think that their victory had been due to the visibility of Moses’ staff during the battle, but that it was exclusively due to the help of Hashem, without which the staff would not have proven effective at all. Israel’s “flag” is its faith in Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case, it would seem that it was not as \"above natural\" as the splitting of the reed see. It had to do with the fact that there was trust in G-d. As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.11?lang=bi&with=Seder%20Ma%27amadot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder Ma'amadot writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And so it was, when Moshe raised his hand, Israel prevailed…” (Exodus 17:11). And is it Moshe’s hands that make [success in] war or break [success in] war? Rather, [this comes to] tell you, [that] whenever Israel would look upward and subjugate their hearts to their Father in heaven, they would prevail; and if not, they would fall. Similar to this matter, you [can] say concerning the verse; “Make a [graven] snake and place it on a pole, and everyone bitten who sees it will live” (Numbers 21:8): And is it the snake that kills or [is it] the snake that [revives]? Rather, whenever Israel would look upward and subjugate their hearts to their Father in heaven, they would be healed; and if not, they would be harmed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Akeidas Yitzchok explains that G-d turned His face away when the people displayed lack of faith in Him. When they displayed faith, G-d would help them <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.42.1.7?ven=Akeydat_Yitzchak_by_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(42:1:7)</a>.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133695/27180\">my recent question about Moshe stretching out his hand during the makkos</a>, the Sforno is quoted by @Shalom. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Numbers.20.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> explains that there are different kinds of miracles in the Torah. One of the miracles is called an \"open-miracle\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Something that could not be produced by nature without a special assist by G-d, although it could conceivably be become a natural phenomenon over a long period of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the examples the Sforno connects with this kind of miracle is G-d commanding Moses to raise his staff (Exodus 14:16). It would seem to me that this is the same kind of miracle that happened during the battle with Amalek. Moshe holding his staff upwards etc...</p>\n<p>The Sforno then goes on to explain what the impact was when the people saw Moshe Rabbeinu performing these kind of miracles (through G-d, obviously):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Observing Moses in action in this fashion, they would get an inkling of the Power of the G-d Who had employed him as His emissary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be honest. My opinion is that the same principle(s) and explanation(s) apply to the story of the battle of Amalek. Moshe holding his staff upwards was an physical act, turning to prayer. But it also was an miracle, performed by G-d, through Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/129153/27180\">Why didn't Moses fight Amalek himself?</a>\nSee: Be'er Yosef, mentioned <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/129156/27180\">here</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rashi explains that there was actually quite a big miracle that took place at this war;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עד בא השמש. שֶׁהָיוּ עֲמָלֵקִים מְחַשְּׁבִין אֶת הַשָּׁעוֹת בָּאִיצְטְרוּלוֹגִיאָה, בְּאֵיזוֹ שָׁעָה הֵם נוֹצְחִים, וְהֶעֱמִיד לָהֶם מֹשֶׁה חַמָּה וְעִרְבֵּב אֶת הַשָּׁעוֹת (תנחומא):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionaly, Rashi mentions that there was plenty of kishuf going around and they had to be able to counteract that;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בחר לנו אנשים. גִּבּוֹרִים וְיִרְאֵי חֵטְא שֶׁתְּהֵא זְכוּתָן מְסַיַּעְתָּן. דָּבָר אַחֵר – בְּחַר לָנוּ אֲנָשִׁים שֶׁיּוֹדְעִין לְבַטֵּל כְּשָׁפִים, לְפִי שֶׁבְּנֵי עֲמָלֵק מְכַשְּׁפִין הָיוּ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However it is possible that these above natural occurences were not related to actual literal fighting of the war, rather they were the background that was used to help the fighters win against their kishuf.

Hashem gains nothing from any of them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אלו ההגדות אשר נתקשו על הרב כפי דעתי ענין אחר להם, שרצו לומר <strong>שאין\nהתועלת במצות להקב״ה בעצמו ית׳, אבל התועלת באדם עצמו</strong>, למנוע ממנו נזק,\nאו אמונה רעה, או מדה מגונה, או לזכור הנסים ונפלאות הבורא יתברך, לדעת\nאת י״י. וזהו לצרוף בהן – שיהיו ככסף צרוף, כי הצורף הכסף אין מעשהו בלא\nטעם אבל להוציא ממנו כל סיג. וכן המצות להוציא מלבנו כל אמונה רעה,\nולהודיענו האמת ולזכרו תמיד.</p>\n<p>...T<strong>hey have no benefit for Hashem himself, they are for the benefit of man himself</strong>: to stop him from being damaged, bad beliefs, bad qualities, to remind him of the miracles Hashem did, to know Hashem. They purify him [the person], like one who refines silver by melting it to remove the impurities, so too the mitzvos remove our impurities. And also the mitzvot remove bad beliefs and teach us truth to remember always.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore not only do we do harm to others when we sin, but we actually distance and destroy our connection with Hashem. We damage ourselves too! Hashem is constantly trying to shower us with all good, but we distance ourselves with our free choice. (See Ramchal Derech Hashem Chapter 4:10)</p>\n<p><strong>Gehinom is there to purify us</strong> from this harm.</p>\n<p>Please see Chagiga 15b.\nAcher a sage sins horribly, he may not enter the world to come because of the sin, he may not enter punishment because of his Torah.\nRebbi Meir mentions it would be better for Acher to face judgement (ie: Gehhna smoke pours from Acher's Kever) so that he should be able to enter the world to come. And that is precisely what Rebbi Meir causes to happen. We see a clear example (imo) that the \"punishment\" is for our benefit as well so that we may enter the world to come. Acher was not allowed to enter that world since he sinned, but after his punishment he is. The sin has been purified.</p>\n<p>Also the punishment is limited in duration (12 months) See Sefer HaIkarim 4:38.</p>\n<p>Also a number of commentators state explicitly that Hashem does things in an infinite way, gehinom (punishment) is limited because it precisely does not come from Hashem. <strong>Hashem does NOT punish us</strong>. <strong>We cause the punishment to come upon ourselves</strong>. (See 1st Perek of Tomer Devorah, and Rav Yaakov Mlisa on Eicha:  לא תצא מפיו הרעות והטוב)</p>\n<p>In theory Hashem is kind and allows this purification, had he not, that imo would be much more cruel.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In this world, we have an opportunity to serve Hashem. For the rest of eternity, He's going to be looking after us, and there won't be anything we can do for Him.</p>\n<p>When it comes to Hashem as He relates to His creation, He absolutely <strong><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136415/31534\">needs</a></strong> us to not carry on Shabbat, <code>צרך גמור הוא</code><sup>1</sup>. By not doing so, we are serving Him, by doing so, we are ruining the whole world.</p>\n<p>To Him in His Essence though, it is technically true that details like carrying a physical object in a particular space or not makes absolutely no difference to Him<sup>2</sup>, He is <code>שלימתא דכולא</code><sup>3</sup>. However, something far more sublime matters to Him in His Essence - the refinement of mankind. So even in His Essence, He needs us to become refined, and that is done by keeping His Mitzvot<sup>4</sup>.</p>\n<p>So, we are avoiding carrying on Shabbat <em>because He needs that</em>, <strong>not</strong> because <em>we</em> need it. He really does need it, He's not going to change<sup>5</sup> or budge on that<sup>6</sup>, and when one passes the point that one can no longer do that for Him, even though they had ample opportunity to do so, or worse: they violated it, then one will experience <em>gehinom</em>, which is regret and shame in full force.</p>\n<p>So this is the correct attitude: Hashem needs you, and that means all of you; every last detail of your life has a right way to do it, and a wrong way to do it. Judaism is not harsh though. It fully recognises that what is expected of us is very trying, and is very understanding. There is <em>teshuva</em>, there is <em>pesach sheni</em>, Yom Kippur, <em>mens rea</em> requirements that are very steep, 13 <em>middot</em> of <em>rachamim</em>, and every extenuating circumstance is taken into account.</p>\n<p>Still, after all that, once we've finished being silly, we are going to feel very embarrased and we will all need a hot shower in <em>gehinom</em>. He doesn't \"send us\" there, in fact, He has to come with us. That's part of why it's so painful and the real meaning of fearing Him<sup>7</sup>, but B'H in His great goodness, it can't last more than a year. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133247/31534\">It's not a punishment</a><sup>8</sup>, it's just reality, and a testament to how great Hashem is and how much He expects of (and believes in) us.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 - לא תהי׳ משכלה תשי״ב, ב<br />\n2 - Bereshit Rabba 44:1<br />\n3 - Tikkunei Zohar; Introduction, 17b <em>et al</em>.<br />\n4 - לא תהי׳ משכלה תשי״ב, ד; see also בשעה שהקדימו, יום ב׳ דחג השבועות תשי״ב, and Zohar Bereshit 16, and many other sources</sup><br />\n<sup>5 - Bamidbar 23:19<br />\n6 - 9th principle of faith of the Rambam<br />\n7 - See Tanya Ch. 36<br />\n8 - See Chovot Halevavot 1:10 for example</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Please note the only commandment that is explicitly mentioned in the tora that is connected to shabbat are Keep my Sabath, and don't light a fire.</p>\n<p>Everything else is Derabanan not directly from hashem.</p>\n<p>Yes, There are those fanatics that will throw to you that WHAT THE RABBIS DECREE IS MI-SINAI and HASHEM SAID It's like he ordained  it.</p>\n<p>At the very end, what was mentioned in the tora one can't add or remove, though it only takes a Possek to change to a degree what the rabbis decree.</p>\n<p>There's a book called (The Narrow Halakhik Bridge By Rabbi Ronen Neuwirth)Haskama from Chief rabbi of Shoham, and Rabat Gan.</p>\n<p>He says explicitly the majority of the laws that are spoken are rabbinical and not for the sake of heaven, rather for the sake of this world i.e Law is legal not necessarily logic) lets take an example, Electricity on shabbat, 99% percent (politically) say it's forbidden, though a son in law  of rabbi Eliyashiv (rabbi Zalman Aurbach, disagrees and permits it). To this day there's a rabbi by the name  of Rabbi Chaim Ovadia, the Grandson of Grand Kabbalist Rabbi Yehuda P'taya, and whom is also a student of the former chief rabbi of Israel, Rabbi Mordechai Elyahue, permits electricity on shabbat, (Albeit with other restrictions), another example, can't mix milk and meat, right? Correct, so why cant I have a chicken burger sandwich cheeseburger with real cheese? I learned with a big mass-mid that <em>A</em> rabbi Yose and his whole city <strong>ate</strong> chicken and milk together. And all-phi Halacha I may get a Cold cut and have it with real cheese. So Halacha Is <strong>very political</strong>, <strong>not really spiritual</strong>. I was told even The ARIZAL stayed FAR away from <strong>teaching Halacha</strong> as it's very subjective not Objective, (NOT a banana republic, just not as we perceive it to be as so heavenly).</p>\n<p>So Don't fret, You'd be surprised how far a simple honest life, will take you in heaven. Just find ( Or develop your own logical hashkafa) have a raw to guid within it, and you're good to go.</p>\n<p>I know this answer is going to get a lot bad remarks and down votes because it goes against the norm, so in the end, it's truly up to you.</p>\n<p>If you need help or clarification im more than happy to help.</p>\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n",

There is no daily obligation to wear sisith. However any time one wears a four cornered garment, they are obligated to wear sisith upon it. This is similar to other elective miswoth, such as mezuzah... there is no obligation to live in a house which would require a mezuzah, one can live in a tent or on a boat their entire life mezuzah free and have done nothing wrong. There is however a slight difference when it comes to sisith. The Rambam writes (H. Sisith 3:10-12):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היאך חיוב מצות הציצית:  כל אדם שהוא חייב לעשות מצוה זו--אם יתכסה בכסות\nהראויה לציצית--יטיל לה ציצית, ואחר כך יתכסה בה; ואם נתכסה בה בלא\nציצית, הרי ביטל מצות עשה.  אבל הבגדים הראויין לציצית--כל זמן שלא יתכסה\nבהן אדם, אלא מקופלין ומונחין--פטורין מן הציצית:  שאינה חובת הטלית, אלא\nחובת האיש שיש לו טלית. אף על פי שאין אדם מחוייב לקנות טלית ולהתעטף בה,\nכדי שיעשה בה ציצית, אין ראוי לאדם חסיד, לפטור עצמו ממצוה זו; אלא לעולם\nישתדל להיות עטוף בכסות המחוייבת בציצית, כדי שיקיים מצוה זו.  ובשעת\nהתפילה, צריך להיזהר ביותר; גנאי גדול הוא לתלמיד חכמים, שיתפלל והוא\nאינו עטוף. לעולם יהא אדם זהיר במצות ציצית, שהרי הכתוב שקלה ותלה בה כל\nהמצוות כולן, שנאמר \"וראיתם אותו וזכרתם את כל מצוות ה', ועשיתם אותם\"\n(במדבר טו,לט).</p>\n<p>What is the nature of the obligation of the commandment of sisith?\nEvery person who is obligated to fulfill this mitzvah, if he wears a\ngarment requiring sisith, should attach sisith to it and then wear it.\nIf he wears it without attaching sisith to it, he has negated [this]\npositive commandment. There is, however, no obligation to attach\nsisith to a garment which requires sisith, as long as it remains\nfolded in its place, without a person wearing it. It is not that a\ngarment requires [sisith]. Rather, the requirement is incumbent on the\nperson [wearing] the garment. <strong>Even though a person is not obligated to\npurchase a talleth and wrap himself in it so that he must attach\nsisith to it, it is not proper for a pious person to release himself from\nthis commandment. Instead, he should always try to be wrapped in a\ngarment which requires sisith so that he will fulfill this mitzvah. In\nparticular, care should be taken regarding this matter during prayer.</strong>\nIt is very shameful for a Torah scholar to pray without being wrapped\n[in a talleth].A person should always be careful regarding the mitzvah\nof sisith, because the Torah considered it equal to all the miswoth\nand considered them all as dependent on it, as [implied by Numbers\n15:39]: \"And you shall see them and remember all the miswoth of God.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though the obligation of sisith is only triggered by electing to wear a four cornered garment, it is nevertheless proper to endeavor to wear it - especially at times of prayer. Every time that you put on a four cornered garment that properly has sisith, you are actively fulfilling the miswah. And every time you don it for the purpose of prayer, you are fulfilling the exhortation of the hakhamim that you strive to do so at such time. If you are able to do so additionally throughout the day, that is wonderful. If you are not able to do so due to other practical considerations that impede your ability to do so, there is nothing defective in such practice.</p>\n\n\n",

The lyrics, energy, beat and rhythm is transmitted through listening. I think the Christian who song it certainly song it with idolatry in mind. Christians do not make a difference between Hashem and Jesus. Jesus is God, literally. So if a Christian song it then he song it with JC in mind and more than likely to JC. He didn't sing it to \"Hashem\" but to JC. JC is Hashem to them and vice-versa so they do not need to verbally state their beliefs because it is inferred automatically. If he is an apostate then that too has implications. In any case this is an odd unique case that should be easily avoided. What if your daughter listens to it today, looks him up and since she thinks it's okay she starts to listen to his other music, learns about their beliefs and falls in love with a Christian boy then converts?\nIt opens doors IMO. In theory you could also sing an Islamic jihad nasheed that doesn't mention Allah but discusses rather neutral though Islamically mailable lyrics -- This would be odd at best. I am worried about potential outcomes. Then again that's my own opinion. I wouldn't want my daughter to listen to and \"admire\" a song sung by an apostate and Christian.</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi comments: “As a reward that Abraham hearkened to My voice when I tested him. And he kept My charge — these are the precautionary decrees instituted by the Sages, which are intended to make us avoid the violation of Biblical laws, such as Second Degrees of forbidden marriages and certain prohibited acts on the Sabbath. My commandments — these are precepts which, had they not been written in the Torah, were requisite to have been written, such as robbery and murder. My statutes — these are matters against which the evil inclination and the heathen nations argue, such as the prohibitions against eating the swine and the wearing of garments woven of wool and linen, there being no apparent rationale for them except that they are decrees of the King imposed on His subjects. And My laws — the plural is intended to include, [besides the Written Law], the Oral Law as well as those rules given to Moses from Sinai.” [Thus far the words of Rashi.]\nNow if so, all this interpretation is posited on the opinion that Abraham fulfilled and observed the Torah before it was given on Sinai. This is indeed what the Sages of the Midrash said in connection with the verse, And Joseph gave them ‘agaloth’ (wagons), thereby indicating to his father that when he left him they were studying the section dealing with Eglah Arufah. Thus Joseph occupied himself with Torah just as his fathers did. Though the Torah had not yet been given, it is still written of Abraham, And he kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws. There the Sages also said that Abraham observed the details of the Torah, which he taught to his children, etc.\nThe question presents itself: If it be the case [that the laws of the Torah were observed by our ancestors before the Torah was given on Sinai], how did Jacob erect a pillar and marry two sisters in their lifetime, and, in the opinion of our Rabbis, four sisters. Also, Amram [Moses’ father] married his aunt, and Moses our teacher erected twelve pillars. How then was it possible that they should be permissive in matters of Torah which Abraham their ancestor had prohibited on himself, and for which G-d appointed him reward, when he [Abraham] was wont to command his children and his household after him to walk in His ways? In the case of Jacob the Sages taught that he observed the Sabbath and established borders for Sabbath distances. In this matter of the Sabbath it is possible though that Jacob observed it because it is equal in importance to the entire Torah since it testifies to the act of Creation.\nPerhaps then we should say that My charge refers to the Second Degree of marriages which were forbidden to the Sons of Noah; My commandments applies to robbery and murder; My statutes refers to the laws against eating a limb torn off from a live animal, as well as breeding mixed kinds of cattle or grafting together different species of trees; and My laws refer to civil statutes and the prohibitions against idol worship. The Sons of Noah were commanded concerning all of these matters, and Abraham observed and fulfilled the Will of his Creator, observing even the details and the strictures of their commandments, even as the Sages mentioned: “The tractate of idolatry of our father Abraham contained four hundred chapters.” They further expounded [on the verse referring to Isaac, which says], And he found in that year a hundredfold, that he measured the produce for the purpose of tithing, since the patriarchs were the generous ones of the peoples, giving tithes to the poor or the priests of G-d, such as Shem and Eber and their disciples, just as it is said, And he was a priest of the most high G-d.\nNow it appears to me from a study of the opinions of our Rabbis that Abraham our father learned the entire Torah by Ruach Hakodesh and occupied himself with its study and the reason for its commandments and its secrets, and he observed it in its entirety as “one who is not commanded but nevertheless observes it.” Furthermore, his observance of the Torah applied only in the Land of Israel, whereas Jacob married two sisters only when outside the Land, and similarly with Amram who married his aunt. For the Commandments are the ordinance of the G-d of the land, even though we have been charged with personal duties in all places. Our Rabbis have already alluded to this secret, and I will yet call your attention to it with the help of G-d. And the matter of the erection of the pillar [by Jacob and Moses referred to above] was a commandment that was innovated at a certain time, as the Sages expounded from the verse, “Neither shalt thou set up a pillar which the Eternal thy G-d hateth, He hated it although it was pleasing to Him in the days of the ancestors.” And with respect to Joseph concerning whom the Sages expounded that he observed the Sabbath even in Egypt, it was because it is equal in importance to all the commandments, constituting, as it does, a testimony to Creatio ex nihilo. Therefore Joseph would do so in order to teach his children faith in the Creation of the world, to remove from their hearts the false doctrine of idolatry and the opinion of the Egyptians. This then is the intent [of the Sages when speaking of the patriarchs and their children observing the Torah].\nIn accordance with the literal meaning of Scripture, you may say that My charge means faith in the Deity, implying that Abraham believed in the unique Divine Name and kept vigilant guard over it in his heart, differing thereby with the worshippers of idols, and calling by the name of the Eternal to bring many to His worship. My commandments refers to all that G-d commanded Abraham: Go out of thy land, the bringing of his son as a burnt-offering, and the expulsion of the maid-servant and her son. My statutes refers to walking in the paths of G-d by being gracious and merciful, doing righteousness and judgment, and commanding his children and his household concerning them. And My Laws refers to the circumcision of Abraham himself and his sons and his servants, as well as all Commandments of the Sons of Noah which constitute their Law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shem M’shmuel in Parshas Shmini offers another interpretation, that it means they kept the Torah in a different dimension, but not practically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דהנה מה שאמרו שאברהם קיים את התורה כולה, שבודאי אין הפירוש במעשה המצוות כמו שהן עתה, שזה אי אפשר ברוב מצוות התורה כמובן, מה גם שרובן תלויין ביציאת מצרים, אלא הפירוש אור המצוות, כענין שבזוהר הקדש שיעקב קיים במקלות אשר פצל סוד התפילין, וממנו תקיש אל השאר, ועל דרך זה היה אפשר להם לקיים כל התורה, אך בכלים ולבושים שונים מאשר הם אחר נתינת התורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Aggadah%2C_Genesis.4.3.1-5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Agadah to Bereshit 4:3-5</a> says that Adam HaRishon knew about Pesach and taught it to his sons, Kayin and Hevel. That was why they brought their korbanot to G-d, <em>in memory of the korban Pesach</em>.</p>\n<p>It was in connection to this that murder was introduced into the world by Kayin, mudering his younger brother, Hevel.</p>\n<p>This would mean that it must have been a tradition in the household of Adam and Chava.</p>\n\n\n",

This leads to the question: How does traditional Jewish thought guide those who are immersed in secular environments but seek a deeper connection to their Orthodox roots?</p>\n<p>I'm specifically interested in foundational Jewish texts that discuss strategies to cultivate piety and righteousness in the face of secularism. While I'm familiar with the Sefer Hasidim's perspective on piety, are there other primary Jewish texts that shed light on this?</p>\n<p>For instance, if we were to consider a hypothetical scenario where a man, isolated on a planet with no Jewish community, only had access to foundational Jewish texts, which ones would best guide him towards righteous living?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Neither were Abraham, the holy matriarchs, Josef, Jethro, and even Mosses brought up in the best of surroundings, and the Midrash even says that Abraham worshiped idols in his youth, yet heaven  forbid to say that they were at fault, and according to the Halacha, someone who sinned unknowingly because of the way he was brought up, need not even offer a sacrifice to atone for it, being that he did so unknowingly!</p>\n<p>The Talmud says that one can become righteous, and atone for anything and everything in an instant - just by opening your heart like the size of a “needle’s tip”, i.e. the smallest amount - and there are numerous stories in the Talmud of people who earned a share in the world to come in one moment!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Repentance is the biggest cleanser of the soul; and there is no sin that can't be forgiven, if a person truly repents.</p>\n<p>The first step of repentance; is regret, which you've amply expressed.</p>\n<p>The second step of repentance; is to have a firm conviction to disassociate yourself from the sins of the past.</p>\n<p>That involves making important life changes that will help you overcome the negative influences of your current situation.

Elsewhere, the Targum (to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.5.2?lang=bi&with=Targum%20Jonathan%20on%20Joshua&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua 5:2</a>, Jer. 48:37, see also Bereishet Rabbah 31:8) again uses variants of galav in this context of razors and cutting. All of this suggests that perhaps galav is an Aramaic word. However, Rashi and Mahari Kara (to Yechezkel 5:1) explain that galav actually comes from Greek. After much searching, I have not found any Greek word which fits this description, but I did find that Dr. Alexander Kohut (1842–1894) suggests changing Rashi’s wording to refer to Arabic instead of Greek. That said, Dr. Chaim Tawil notes that galav is clearly a loanword from the Akkadian gallabu (\"barber\").</p>\n<p>Other scholars connect the triliteral root GIMMEL-LAMMED-BET to\nsimilar Hebrew roots. For example, Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch (to Ps.\n74:6) connects this root to KUF-LAMMED-PEH (via the interchangeability\nof GIMMEL and KUF, and that of BET and PEH), which means “to peel” in\nRabbinic Hebrew. Indeed, “haircutting” which reveals one’s\npreviously-covered epidermis can be similar to “peeling” away the skin\nor covering of something. Rabbi David Golumb in Targumna (to Num.\n21:29) argues that galav is a metathesized form of gvul (“border”),\nwhich may be better understood in light of the possible connection\nbetween sapar and sfar (see below).</p>\n<p>Speaking of the word sapar, although this term does not appear in the\nBible, it has become the most popular term for the topic that we are\ndiscussing, because in Modern Hebrew, sapar means “barber” and\ntisporet means “haircut.” But where does this word come from?</p>\n<p>If you look closely at Targum Oneklos and Targum Yonatan, you will\nnotice an inconsistency in how they render the Hebrew giluach into the\nAramaic: Sometimes they translate giluach into sapar, and sometimes\nthey simply leave the verb in its original Hebrew form as a cognate of\ngiluach. Rabbi Eliyahu HaBachur (1469-1549) in Meturgaman notes this\ninconsistency and also points out that the Targumic term maspar for\n“razor” (see Targum to Num. 6:5, Judges 13:5) is also derived from\nthis root. Interestingly, Targum Neofiti is more consistent than the\nother Targumim in always rendering giluach as sapar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Don't have to recite korbanot at mincha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since today we don't have the temple and it's said one who recites korbanot even parsha hatamid in paticular it's as if he brought a the korban tamid. Halacha also says that korbanot may not be offered anywhere else but only at the beis hamikdash and today the shuls represent the beis hamikdash. If that is, how come its permitted to recite parsha hatamid at home ? wouldn't that be offering tamid from home from a place not permitted to give korbanot from ? The prayers today are in place of the korbanot for lack of the beis hamikdash, refers to amidah in paticular, not reciting korbanot passages, isn't it?</p>\n<p>I read online (i think it was the geonim if i remember) that one can recite korbanot at shacharis, but doesn't have to at mincha. Anyone know why ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To answer your first question:</p>\n<p>Reading the Torah portion and studying the laws of korbanot is like fulfilling the mitzvah. So it is like one brought the korban in the Beis Hamikdash according to all the rules.</p>\n<p>While shuls do represent the Mikdash, they are not the same thing. One could not offer sacrifices in a shul. When one recites korbanot in shul, it is like offering a korban in the Beis Hamikdash, just the same as a recitation at home.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rema in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.48.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">48:1</a> says that it is better to say it in shul with a minyan, but one can say it at home as well</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם אי אפשר לאומרו בצבור יכול לאומרו בביתו ולחזור לקרות פ' התמיד לבד עם הצבור ויכוין בפעם השנייה כקורא בתורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if it is not possible to say with the congregation, one can say it in one's house and come back to read the section of the daily offering on one's own with the congregation [i.e. in its presence]. And the second time, one should intend it like reading in the Torah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for korbanos before mincha, the SA doesn’t mention it, nor does the Rambam. The Rema brings it in 234:1. The Aruch Hashulchan in 234:2 says that it is a good custom to say it. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.234.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">234:7</a> he mentions a reason for those who don’t say it that in the Mikdash mincha was said before the korban Tamid therefore we don’t say it before (afterwards, even those who say it, agree that if one skipped it he shouldn’t say it afterwards)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובמקדש היו מתפללין במנחה קודם הקרבת התמיד. ובאמת 'אשרי' אינה תפלה אלא שבחו יתברך, אלא שאני אומר שמטעם זה רבים אינם אומרים במנחה פרשת התמיד מטעם זה, שבמקדש היתה התפלה קודמת ולכן לא רצו לאומרה קודם תפלת שמונה עשרה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Studying Torah laws is like performing the laws themselves. When we study the laws of the sacrifices, we are studying how to slaughter them within the Beit HaMiqdash specifically, since that is part of the law.\nI do not know how to answer your second paragraph.</p>\n\n\n",

While they may not be kosher to eat as birds (as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/76150/how-do-we-know-that-penguins-are-non-kosher\">another question on this site addressed</a>), since they're fish-eating birds like seagulls, shouldn't they qualify as kosher sea-dwelling creatures, since they have both scales (on their feet, like most birds) and fins (their wings/flippers)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Mishnah (Keilim 17:13) says that the creature called “dog of the sea” - which lives mainly in the sea, but will emerge onto land when escaping predators - is not considered a sea creature.</p>\n<p>so it would seem that penguins too - who live also on land, and need to “escape” the water in order to get oxygen, (and possibly also to escape predators) - wouldn’t be considered full fledged sea creatures</p>\n<p>Also, the Aruch Hashulchan (Yoreh Dei’ah 83:6-8) rules according to the Rambam (laws of forbidden foods 2:12), who seemingly holds that a sea creature that is not a fish is never Kosher - even if it has fins and scales - although there are those who disagree (such as the Pri Chadach and the Chasam Sofer)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Penguins are birds. Just because they swim, they're not suddenly sea creatures. That's like calling an octopus a mammal because they can temporarily be on land.</p>\n<p>Penguin scales are not fish scales. Penguin scales are more like calluses, or even just a leathery texture. They're not armor scales like fish have. In addition, the fact that their wings are round and sometimes used to swim, does not make them fins.</p>\n<p>And one more thing--fish scales have to be removable for the fish to be kosher. So even if you were to ignore everything else in this answer, penguins still wouldn't be kosher.</p>\n\n\n",

Primarily, how Orthodoxy changed in the 20th century in particular regarding reliance on books, rather than tradition, and what effect that has on how people practice.</p>\n<p>He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Fundamentally, all the above — stringency, “maximum position compliance,” and the proliferation of complications and demands — simply reflect the essential change in the nature of religious performance that occurs in a text culture. Books cannot demonstrate conduct; they can only state its requirements. One then seeks to act in a way that meets those demands. Performance is no longer, as in a traditional society, replication of what one has seen, but implementation of what one knows. Seeking to mirror the norm, religious observance is subordinated to it. In a text culture, behavior becomes, inevitably, a function of the ideas it consciously seeks to realize.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have sat in no shortage of halachic shiurim. In many different settings I have heard different versions of \"maximum position compliance\" essentially meaning that if there is more than one opinion we paskin according to the most stringent to 'comply with' the greatest number of positions.</p>\n<p>Is the idea of \"maximum position compliance\" an unspoken consequence of the culture and circumstance of 20th century Jewry, as laid out in that essay?

To be concerned even for the view of the solitary opinion if its reason has grounds, despite that the Halacha does not follow this opinion. The condition, however, is that his stringency not become a leniency. Likewise, to be stringent in cases of doubt even in situations where one may be lenient. Our sages, of blessed memory, explained the statement of Yechezkel (Chulin 37b) \"'behold my soul never became Tamei (spiritually unclean)' (Yechezkel 4:14) - for I never ate the flesh of an animal which a Sage was called to rule on nor did I ever eat the flesh of an animal about which one says \"slaughter it, slaughter it [urgently]\".

    "content": "# Why does the parsha of Tzitzis mention the word Tzitzis three times?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.38?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parsha detailing the mitzva</a> of Tzitzis, the Torah mentions the word Tzitzis three times over the span of two pesukim. I am wondering if any sources (from Chazal through Achronim) bring any insights as to why this is?</p>\n<p>Maybe I am missing something and each one is needed for the simple reading, but it seems to me like there’s room for an exposition here from the fact that it’s said three times. Has anyone come across this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The second time comes to teach us that the Tzitzis need to be made from the same material as the garment - Menachos 39b</p>\n<p>The third time comes to teach us that placing the Tzitzis on each of the four corners is all part of one Mitzvah - not four separate Mitzvos (practical differences can be found in Menachos 37b) - Malbim</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It's a way of emphasizing the commandments (the tzitzit are supposed to remind us of them).  The Talmud [Nedarim 25a] says that the mitzvah of tzitzit is equivalent to all the mitzvot of the Torah.  In that vein, Rashi points out that the gematria of tzitzit, 600, with 8 threads and 5 knots, is 613, the number of the commandments. [Rashi on Numbers 15:39].</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Like Maurice mentions in his answer, the source dealing with this subject is tractate Nedarim 25a which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But isn’t it taught in a baraita: And so we found with regard to <strong>Moses our teacher</strong>. When he administered an oath to the Jewish people in the plains of Moab, that they accept the Torah upon themselves, he <strong>said to them:</strong> <strong>Know that I do not administer an oath upon you according to your understanding and the stipulations in your hearts but according to my understanding and the understanding of the Omnipresent</strong>, as it is stated: “<em><strong>Neither with you only do I make this covenant</strong></em>” (Deuteronomy 29:13). What did Moses say to Israel? Isn’t this what he said to them: Perhaps you will perform negative actions, i.e., transgressions, and say: The oath was taken according to our understanding. Due to that reason, he said to them: <strong>You take the oath according to my understanding.</strong> The Gemara clarifies: What did his warning come to exclude? Does it not serve\n<em><strong>to exclude the possibility that they give the title God, to an object\nof idol worship</strong></em> and say that this was their intention when they took an oath to\nworship God? The fact that Moses needed to preclude this claim\nindicates by inference that a person commonly takes an oath according\nto his own understanding. The Gemara responds: No, idol worship is\nalso called: God, in the Bible, as it is written: “And against all the\ngods of Egypt I will execute judgments” (Exodus 12:12). Therefore,\nthis would not have been a special stipulation in their minds but a\nmisguided intention within the oath itself. Moses suspected this and\ntherefore issued the warning. The Gemara asks: And why did Moses have\nto state the oath with this warning? Let him administer an oath to\nthem with the words: <strong>That you will fulfill the mitzvot</strong>, which also\nincludes the prohibition against idol worship. The Gemara answers: <strong>The\nword mitzvot</strong>, meaning commandments, could also <strong>indicate the\ncommandments of the king</strong>, and this might be their intention if they\nwere to take an oath in this manner. The Gemara asks: And let him\nadminister an oath to them with the words: <strong>That you will fulfill all\nthe mitzvot.</strong> The Gemara answers: This too does not suffice, because\nthis phrase could indicate specifically the mitzva of ritual fringes,\nas the Master said: <strong>The mitzva of ritual fringes is equivalent to all\nthe mitzvot in the Torah.</strong> Consequently, if they would accept upon\nthemselves: All the mitzvot, they may have intended to refer only to\nthe mitzva of ritual fringes. The Gemara asks: And let him administer\nan oath to them: That you fulfill the Torah. The Gemara answers: That\nphrase indicates only one Torah, the Written Torah and not the Oral\nTorah. The Gemara asks: And let him administer an oath: <strong>That you\nfulfill the Torahs, in the plural, to include both the Written Torah\nand Oral Torah.</strong> The Gemara answers: This too does not necessarily\ninclude the entire Torah, since it is possible that it indicates the\nTorah of the meal-offering, the Torah of the sin-offering, and the\nTorah of the guilt-offering. The Gemara asks: And let him administer\nan oath: That you fulfill the Torahs and mitzvot. The Gemara answers:\nThis also does not include the entire Torah, because the word Torahs\ncould indicate the Torah of the meal-offering, and mitzvot could\nindicate the commandments of the king. The Gemara asks: And let him\nadminister an oath: <strong>That you fulfill the entire Torah.</strong> The Gemara\nanswers: Fulfilling the entire Torah could indicate <strong>specifically the\ndenial of idol worship</strong>, which is also deemed fulfilling the entire\nTorah, as it is taught in a baraita: Idol worship is so severe a sin\nthat anyone who denies it is considered as though he concedes to the\ntruth of the entire Torah. The opposite is true for someone who\nworships idols. Therefore, the Jewish people could have claimed that\nfulfilling the entire Torah denotes nothing more than not practicing\nidol worship. The Gemara asks: And let him administer an oath: <strong>That\nyou fulfill the mitzva to distance oneself from idol worship and also\nfulfill the entire Torah.</strong> Or, alternatively, let Moses administer an\noath that the Jewish people will fulfill six hundred thirteen mitzvot,\nso there will be no doubt as to their intention. Rather, Moses our\nteacher used an expression that was not troublesome for the Jews.\nAlthough he could have found another manner in which they could take\nan oath, and it would leave no doubt as to the correct intentions, he\ndid not want to trouble them by employing a more complex method.\nTherefore, he administered the oath and stated that it was according\nto his understanding and the understanding of the Omnipresent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this context of the complete discussion mentioned in Nedarim and according to how Moshe Rabbeinu taught us in the written Torah, the first two mentions are using the term \"<em>tzitzit</em>\" (spelled ציצת) only, gematria 590, which is also the gematria of אפס זולתו like is said in the first paragraph of the Aleinu prayer. Tradition teaches that this prayer was authored by Yehoshua ben Nun, who received semicha from Moshe and filled his position leading the Jewish people after Moshe was gathered to his people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עָלֵֽינוּ לְשַׁבֵּֽחַ לַאֲדוֹן הַכֹּל לָתֵת גְּדֻלָּה לְיוֹצֵר בְּרֵאשִׁית שֶׁלֺּא עָשָֽׂנוּ כְּגוֹיֵי הָאֲרָצוֹת וְלֺא שָׂמָֽנוּ כְּמִשְׁפְּחוֹת הָאֲדָמָה שֶׁלֺּא שָׂם חֶלְקֵֽנוּ כָּהֶם וְגוֹרָלֵֽנוּ כְּכָל הֲמוֹנָם: שֶׁהֵם מִשְׁתַּחֲוִים לָהֶֽבֶל וָרִיק וּמִתְפַּלְּ֒לִים אֶל אֵל לֹא יוֹשִֽׁיעַ, וַאֲנַֽחְנוּ כּוֹרְ֒עִים וּמִשְׁתַּחֲוִים וּמוֹדִים לִפְנֵי מֶֽלֶךְ מַלְכֵי הַמְּ֒לָכִים הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, שֶׁהוּא נוֹטֶה שָׁמַֽיִם וְיוֹסֵד אָֽרֶץ, וּמוֹשַׁב יְקָרוֹ בַּשָּׁמַֽיִם מִמַּֽעַל, וּשְׁ֒כִינַת עֻזּוֹ בְּגָבְ֒הֵי מְרוֹמִים, הוּא אֱלֺהֵֽינוּ אֵין עוֹד, <strong>אֱמֶת מַלְכֵּֽנוּ אֶֽפֶס זוּלָתוֹ</strong> כַּכָּתוּב בְּתוֹרָתוֹ וְיָדַעְתָּ הַיּוֹם וַהֲשֵׁבֹתָ אֶל לְבָבֶֽךָ כִּי יְהֹוָה הוּא הָאֱלֺהִים בַּשָּׁמַֽיִם מִמַּֽעַל וְעַל הָאָֽרֶץ מִתָּֽחַת אֵין עוֹד:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like it says there, this emphasizes that <strong>G-d, our King is true (<em>that G-d's seal and the seal of the Torah is Truth</em> אמת). There is no other King beside Him</strong>.  These two expressions pertain to the tzitzit of white and techelet (blue) being two separate and distinct categories of this single mitzvah.</p>\n<p>The third mention of tzitzit in the paragraph is \"<em>l'tzitzit</em>\" (לציצת) which is gematria 620, <em>not 613</em> like Rashi mentions  in connection to B'Midbar 15:39. <strong>To support <em>his proposed gematria count</em> of all the commandments of the Torah, Rashi adds a letter Yud to the spelling found in the written Torah.</strong></p>\n<p><em>In this context, it should be noted that if one adds a letter or omits a letter from the written Torah, it makes the whole Torah invalid.</em></p>\n<p>Like the text of the written Torah emphasizes, the word לציצת is emphasizing <strong>\"all the mitzvot of G-d\"</strong>, (<em>not only the 613 mitzvot of the B'nai Yisroel</em>) are one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְהָיָה לָכֶם לְצִיצִת וּרְאִיתֶם֯ אֹ֯תוֹ</strong> וּזְכַרְתֶּם֯ אֶ֯ת־כָּל־מִצְוֹת֯ יְ֯הֹוָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That לציצת, when including its five letters, is gematria 625 (הכתר או כתר ה׳) which is also the gematria of כל מצות יהוה when including its three words and ten letters.</p>\n<p>This means <strong>both</strong> <em>the 613 mitzvot of B'nai Israel</em> and <em>the 7 Mitzvot of B'nai Noach</em> (like is emphasized in Nedarim quoting Moshe Rabbeinu, \"<em>Neither <strong>with you only</strong> do I make this covenant...</em>\"), all of which were commanded by G-d directly, are essential and necessary for revealing the one, true G-d's Kingship and are complementary to each other. That 620 is gematria כתר (Crown) alluding to <strong>G-d's Kingship over everyone</strong>.</p>\n<p>That this 620 refers to the 613 mitzvot of B'nai Yisrael and the 7 mitzvot of the B'nai Noach follows the explanation of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.25a.7?lang=bi&p2=Ran_on_Nedarim.25a.7.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Nissim ben Reuven of Girona to this expression in Nedarim</a>. He explains that this is also the plain meaning from D'varim 29:13-14 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְלֹ֥א אִתְּכֶ֖ם לְבַדְּכֶ֑ם אָנֹכִ֗י כֹּרֵת֙ אֶת־הַבְּרִ֣ית הַזֹּ֔את</strong> וְאֶת־הָאָלָ֖ה הַזֹּֽאת׃\n<strong>כִּי֩ אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֨ר יֶשְׁנ֜וֹ פֹּ֗ה עִמָּ֙נוּ֙</strong> עֹמֵ֣ד הַיּ֔וֹם לִפְנֵ֖י יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֑ינוּ <strong>וְאֵ֨ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵינֶ֛נּוּ פֹּ֖ה עִמָּ֥נוּ הַיּֽוֹם</strong>׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Rabbeinu Nissim says this is referring to the non-Jewish nations, who were not standing at Har Sinai together with Israel and receiving the Torah. In fact, like is recorded in the Talmud, they had refused it. Their obligation to the Creator of us all is to His commandments which He gave to them previously with Adam HaRishon and Noach. That their obligation to keep the seven mitzvot of the children of Noach was not nullified or replaced, but renewed and re-emphasized at the time of the giving of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus, he said: “so too shall I break [the yoke of Bavel] from upon the necks of all the nations!” - [by declaring that in G-d’s name, G-d considered that statement] as if He actually broke the yoke off all the nations!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It seems to be saying that because Chanayah the Prophet announced this prophesy about shattering the yoke of King Nebuchadnetzer <em>from off the neck of all the nations</em> within two years, which are compared to yokes of wood, <em>meaning lighter and softer burdens</em>, that it was as if he had decreed all yokes would be removed (which was not the true, intended message from G-d).</p>\n<p>And Yirmiyahu the Prophet didn't contradict him, but said, it should only be so.

But that if Chananyah's prophesy actually comes to pass, then everyone will know that he truly spoke in G-d's name.</p>\n<p>Posuk 13 says that Yirmiyahu was told by G-d that by Chananyah's action, attempting to soften G-d's message, not only would the situation not improve, but that it would become worse through increased agitation.

The conquered were tied or chained to the rod, preventing them from escaping as they were forcibly taken into captivity and exile.

This seems to me a relatively modern phenomenon. The gemara and early poskim discuss certain cases where we know a specific food item is kosher based on simanim or the concept of a seal as an indication against tampering (e.g., in the chanukah story). But is there early precedent for the concept of an organization or rabbinate vouching for a product or establishment and, especially, sending that product to other locales or throughout a large area who will also rely on the hechsher?</p>\n<p>When did the paradigm of modern hechsherim like the OU, star K, etc. first arise? And when they did, was the concept at all controversial?

Cited <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2326880/jewish/Chapter-3-Studies-in-the-Passage-on-the-Redemption-in-Tractate-Sanhedrin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehoshua_Mondshine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehoshua Mondshine</a> in his sefer Migdal Oz, relates a story of the Alter Rebbe who was traveling through the city of Vitebsk and a few persons approached the Alter Rebbe and asked him \"Rebbe, when will Moshiach come?\". The Alter Rebbe famously answered <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=24743&st=&pgnum=225\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Migdal Oz, p. 170)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mashiach that the world at large wants will never come.

Rather, they:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>desired to be free to involve themselves in Torah and wisdom without any pressures or disturbances</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This got me thinking. The Gemara says that Moshiach comes unexpected. The Migdal Oz relates that the Alter Rebbe said that the Moshiach we are waiting for never comes. I think there is an connection between these two statements. But in order for me to understand all this, I really want to know how to understand these two statements.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I would like to know if there are (any) explanations given on the words that \"Moshiach will come when unexpected\". Especially in light of how the Rebbe translates בהיסח הדעת (with one's reason set aside). <strong>What does this mean?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Manis Friedman, a great student of the school of Lubavitch, <a href=\"https://11213.org/2015/07/29/dont-think-about-it-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> היסח הדעת like this, drawing from the explanations of the etz ha'da'at by the Rebbe and the feeling of self-consciousness that it gave us: If one is considering something with one's da'at, it means they are relating to it personally, they feel a <em>sense of connection and belonging with it</em>.</p>\n<p>He gives an example. A man gazes inappropriately at someone on the street. What do we advise him? The old method is screaming at him for being inappropriate, filthy, etc. The היסח הדעת way would be to ask him: what <em>shaychus</em> this person he is looking at has to him.</p>\n<p>Etz Ha'da'at's power is strongest felt in this particular urge, so it is a good example. It is a good exercise to compare this with some other thing we gaze at, but without so much דעת, say <em>expensive cars</em>. So, with the gazing at the person on the street, he will have some inner feeling of \"<em>this is to do with me</em>\" (or worse) about it, and <em>that</em> is what is inappropriate: she has nothing to do with him! Also, a stranger's expensive car has anything to do with him, <em>but he doesn't gaze with such a lust at the car</em>. <strong>He looks at it with היסח הדעת</strong>: \"that's way to expensive for me\", and doesn't give it a second thought. In the case of the woman on the street, if he could simply internalise <em>she has nothing to do with him</em>, he wouldn't find much draw in gazing at her.</p>\n<p>So now we know what היסח הדעת is. What about the concept of the Moshiach nobody wants coming? Rav Manis Friedman <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyCfd0REyfE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> 10 minutes in, the navi that says that the whole world thought they were right and the Jews/Torah were wrong, and there's going to be a great ideological shake up when it turns out to be the other way around. So, the shake up is when the thing they thought had nothing to do with them, was irrelevant, and they paid it no reason or mind, היסח הדעת; that thing will suddenly become the truth overnight, and it's very very hard to let go of one's da'at, and make room for another da'at, especially one we despise. So it will be a great struggle for most of the world.</p>\n<p>So this is how I understood the connection between your pasukim. <strong>Many people are seeking a Moshiach that will improve the world in a way they believe makes sense i.e. in ways that are very relevant and important to them, but actually they are wrong, and something that they didn't consider relevant at all will be the truth of the world of the Moshiach</strong>. This will be a huge surprise and cause a big agony for many people. Let me know if there's anything else I neglected to address, or didn't explain unambiguously.</p>\n<p>I see you asking in comments, so I'll just add from the rest of the shiur or related ideas that the Rebbe taught: this thing that many don't notice is that the desire for Moshiach comes <em>not</em> for our benefit, but because <em>Hashem</em> wants Moshiach. This is His plan, His deepest desire; all about Him, not us. That was the Rebbe's whole motto practically, it's about Him, not us. It's also going to be a great joy to many people, and there will be a great thirst. Many people will be so glad to know how real and personal Hashem is, and how much there is to know about Him with real da'at, having been starved of that knowledge for so long. It's thinking about Him in this way that really produces our desire for Moshiach, we want Him to get what He created the world for, speedily in our day!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>After several weeks of struggling over this Gemara, I've found a possible explanation.</p>\n<p><em>Note: my Hebrew is still a work-in-progress.

One of these three is Moshiach.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is as in that practice of Rabbi Zeira, who, when he would find\nSages who were engaging in discussions about the coming of the\nMessiah, said to them: Please, I ask of you, do not delay his coming\nby calculating the end of days.

The Rebbe says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This teaching does not mean that a person should not (G‑d forbid) think about the Redemption and anticipate its coming. It means that though his reason sees no possibility for Redemption, a Jew persists with an intense belief that transcends his reason. This meaning springs directly from the Hebrew idiom בהיסח הדעת (here translated “unawares”), which literally means “with one’s reason set aside.”  (Likkutei Sichos vol. 5)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to the Rebbe, Behesech Hadaas does mean unawareness (peshat reading). However, it should be read as \"with one's reason set aside\". That's the basis for the explanation of Rabbi Brod in sefer Yemos HaMoshiach.</p>\n<p>Beginning from <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/603612/p/57/t/0.68078875225487831234/fs/ePjnBFkPqUJ1uczek02VGjckjceAfv4M7mGG7g7xeTB9/start/0/end/10/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">page 59</a>, Rabbi Brod says that daily, we anticipate the coming of Moshiach. We pray about the coming of Moshiach/Redemption multiple times a day. We \"express a immense longing for redemption\", says the author. Does all of this become puzzling because of the statement of our sages that \"Moshiach comes unexpectedly\"?</p>\n<p>Rabbi Brod goes on to cite a Gemara that talks about Rabbi Zeira, encountering people that were engaging in discussions about the coming of Moshiach <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.97a.11?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Sanhedrin 97a)</a>.

As <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.97a.11?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi says (ad loc.)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דמעסקי ביה - לידע מתי יבא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Zeira responds to these people with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I ask of you, do not delay</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why? Because <em>\"three things come unexpectedly, one of which is Moshiach\"</em>.</p>\n<p>In sefer Yemos HaMoshiach, the author goes on to explain that even \"these three things come when not expected\", that does absolutely not mean that we should not think about redemption and the coming of Moshiach <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/603612/p/58/t/0.68078875225487831234/fs/ePjnBFkPqUJ1uczek02VGjckjceAfv4M7mGG7g7xeTB9/start/0/end/10/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(p. 60)</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שני הפרטים האחרים באותו מאמר מציאה ועקרב ממחישים עד כמה אין המחשבה והציפייה לגאולה סותרות את היסח הדעת' אדם יכול להתהלך כל היום במחשבה שהוא רוצה למצוא מציאה וכי מפני זה לא יהיה רגע המציאה הפתעהנ או אדם שמהלך בשדה מתוך מודעות מתמדת לסכנת העקרבים שבסביבה האם יוכל לדעת מראש מתי בדיוק יעקוץ אותו עקרבנ כך גם הגאולה אנו צריכים לחשוב עליה כל הזמן לצפות לה להתפלל עליה להתכונן לקראתה ועם זה ברור לנו שהיא תבוא בהפתעה A person can walk around all day thinking that he wants to find the object he lost, does that mean that when he finds the lost item that he is not surprised? Or a person who walks in a field with a constant awareness of the danger of scorpions in that area, will he be able to know in advance exactly when a scorpion arrives and sting him? So is redemption - we need to think about it all the time, expect it, pray for it, prepare for it. Even then will it come as a surprise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The author quotes an explanation of the sefer מאורי החסידות. I am not familiair with that sefer and exact place of the quotation. If someone could please add that in, that would be wonderful.</strong></p>\n<p>The sefer מאורי החסידות says that when a Jew looks around him and he does not see (signs) that redemption is coming soon but nevertheless has faith in that it will come, because Hashem says so. That is what בהיסח הדעת - Behesech Hadaas means. He put's away his thoughts and keeps faith in that even though we are still in galus, redemption will come. Somewhat related to this is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cognitive dissonance-theory</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הדעת זו מתנה מלמעלה שהאדם עצמו אינו יכול להגיע אליה באמצעות דעתו ושכלו אלא הקב\"ה נותנה לנו באופן שלמעלה מהדעת It is a gift from above, which a person by himself cannot reach through his own mind and intellect. Nevertheless, G-d gives us the understanding</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can't understand that Redemption is coming, but we are meant to put away this thoughts, e.g. behesech hadaas, because we know that it comes.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Brod then cites the Rebbe in Toras Menachem (תורת מנחם התוועדויות - חלק י\"א) (could not find it either) and says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Distraction is the highest form of waiting for Moshiach (תורת מנחם כרך ט עמ' p. 111)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We must distract ourselves from the thought that we want Moshiach because then, everything will be \"okay\". During Covid, people often said \"I want Moshiach because then this is all over\". This should not be the thought. Rather, we must want redemption because that is the end-goal of Hashem, e.g.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שתושלם הכוונה האלוקית בבריאת העולם להיות לו יתברך דירה בתחתונים G-ds intention in the creation of the world was to have a dwelling in the lower place(s).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The author ends with the explanation that when the situation is such that the mind and intellect see no place for redemption to come - this \"distraction\" is a sign of the coming redemption. This is בהיסח הדעת - Behesech Hadaas.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi has there ועקרב - נושך האדם פתאום: - Scorpion - it bites a man <strong>Pitom, suddenly/unexpectedly</strong>.</p>\n<p>Ben Yehoyada also speaks of the simple meaning - 'ולזה סיים מָצָאתִי דָּוִד עַבְדִּי כמו מציאה.\nעַקְרָב מְצִיאָה' שבאין <strong>בהיסח הדעת</strong>\nlike a lost object or scorpion, which happen suddenly/unexpectedly, so it concludes \"I have found my servant David\" - like a lost object.</p>\n<p>\"With one's reason set aside\" doesn't seem to fit the simple meaning as per Rashi and the BIH.</p>\n<p>Also per Chayey Moharan #597 Mashiach will come suddenly, \"Pitom,\" and causing an uproar, \"Raash gadol\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁמַעְתִּי בִּשְׁמוֹ שֶׁאָמַר <strong>שֶׁמָּשִׁיחַ יָבוֹא פִּתְאוֹם וְיִהְיֶה\nנַעֲשֶׂה קוֹל רַעַשׁ גָּדוֹל שֶׁבָּא מָשִׁיחַ</strong> וְכָל אֶחָד יַשְׁלִיךְ\nהַמַּשָּׂא וּמַתָּן שֶׁהוּא עוֹסֵק בּוֹ הַשֻּׁלְחָנִי יַשְׁלִיךְ\nהַשֻּׁלְחָן שֶׁלּוֹ, וְזֶה יַשְׁלִיךְ הַשַּׁעֲוָה וּכְמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב\nבִּישַׁעְיָה וְהִשְׁלִיכוּ אִישׁ אֱלִילֵי כַסְפּוֹ וֶאֱלִילֵי זְהָבוֹ.\nוְלא כְּמוֹ שֶׁסּוֹבְרִין קְצָת שֶׁכְּשֶׁיָּבוֹא מָשִׁיחַ יִהְיֶה\nעוֹלָם אַחֵר מִשֶּׁל עַכְשָׁו רַק הוּא כַּנַּ\"ל. וְכָל אֶחָד\nיִתְבַּיֵּשׁ מִשְּׁטוּת מַעֲשָׂיו כָּל אֶחָד לְפִי מַעֲשָׂיו\nוּצְרִיכִין חֲקִירָה וּשְׁאֵלָה עֲדַיִן, מִי שָׁמַע שִׂיחָה זאת\nמִפִּיו הַקָּדוֹשׁ</p>\n<p>I [R' Natan] heard it said in his [R' Nachman of Breslev's] name that\nhe said that Mashiach will come all of a sudden, and there will be a\nbig uproar that Mashiach has come, and everyone will cast away his\ncommerce that he is engaged in: the banker will throw away his table,\nand another will throw away his wax, as written in Isaiah, \"<em>Yashlikh\nha'adam eth elilei khaspo w'eth elilei z'havo</em>/Man will throw away his\nidols of silver and his idols of gold\" [Isa. 2:20].

A day of bitul Torah [wasting time one could spend learning] is a hole in the character of a woman, and one should relate to it, to some extent, like [the halachic category of] bitul Torah, even though it is not bitul Torah in its original sense. <strong>There is no bitul of [obligatory] Torah knowledge, but there is bitul regarding the spiritual character of the woman.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://etzion.org.il/en/halakha/studies-halakha/women-and-mitzvot/women-learning-torah-iv-what-study\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>.

However quite the contrary is true.</p>\n<p>Prophecy entails a process of physical and spiritual preparation (as @Dude points out much of this is explained in Ch. 7 of H. Yesode ha-Torah). Typically in order for prophecy to devolve upon an individual prophet, they must have already been prepared for the prophetic state. Generally however, prophets led otherwise \"normal\" lives, participated in family life, had wives with whom they co-habited, etc. When a given prophet wanted to place themselves in a state such that they would be ready to receive prophecy, they would among other things, temporarily separate themselves from their wives.</p>\n<p>The Rambam writes H. Yesode ha-Torah 7:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל הנביאים אין מתנבאים בכל עת שירצו משה רבינו אינו כן אלא כל זמן\nשיחפוץ רוח הקודש לובשתו ונבואה שורה עליו ואינו צריך לכוין דעתו ולהזדמן\nלה שהרי הוא מכוון ומזומן ועומד כמלאכי השרת. לפיכך מתנבא בכל עת שנאמר\nעמדו ואשמעה מה יצוה ה' לכם. ובזה הבטיחו האל שנאמר לך אמור להם שובו לכם\nלאהליכם ואתה פה עמוד עמדי. הא למדת שכל הנביאים כשהנבואה מסתלקת מהם\nחוזרים לאהלם שהוא צרכי הגוף כלם כשאר העם. לפיכך אין פורשין מנשותיהם.\nומשה רבינו לא חזר לאהלו הראשון לפיכך פירש מן האשה לעולם ומן הדומה לו\nונקשרה דעתו לצור העולמים ולא נסתלק מעליו ההוד לעולם וקרן עור פניו\nונתקדש כמלאכים</p>\n<p>All the [other] prophets cannot prophesy whenever they desire. Moses,\nour teacher, was different. Whenever he desired, the holy spirit would\nenvelop him, and prophecy would rest upon him. He did not have to\nconcentrate his attention to prepare himself [for prophecy], because\nhis [mind] was always concentrated, prepared, and ready [to appreciate\nspiritual truth] as the angels [are]. Therefore, he would prophesy at\nall times, as [Numbers 9:8] states: \"Stand and hear what God will\ncommand you.\" He was promised this by God, as [implied by Deuteronomy\n5:27-28]: \"Go and tell them: `Return to your tents,' but you stand\nhere together with Me.\" This should be interpreted to mean: When\nprophecy departs from all the [other] prophets, they return to their\n\"tents\" - i.e., the needs of the body like other people. Therefore,\nthey do not separate themselves from their wives. Moses, our teacher,\nnever returned to his original \"tent.\" Therefore, he separated himself\nfrom women and everything of that nature forever. He bound his mind to\nthe Eternal Rock. [Accordingly,] the glory never left him forever. The\nflesh of his countenance shone, [for] he became holy like the angels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe Rabbenu however, permanently separated himself from his wife as an aspect of rendering himself constantly prepared for prophetic engagement. This was not something God commanded Moshe to do, it was something he elected to do (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.87a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabboth 87a</a> teaches it is one of three actions he took of his own reasoning that God agreed to).</p>\n<p>Miriam and Aharon (not knowing/understanding) that this permanent separation from his wife was uniquely proper for Moshe, were critical of this act (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.12.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Numbers 12:1</a>). Accordingly when prophecy suddenly (פִּתְאֹ֗ם) devolved upon them they were surprised, as they had not undergone their regular preparations which normally would have included separating themselves from their spouses. It was then that they experientially understood that they had erred in criticizing Moshe for his action of separating from his wife. Unlike other prophets, Moshe was subject to the prophetic state at any given moment and thus his separation was proper.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yesodei haTorah - Chapter Seven describes that prophecy was a process that led up to the prophecy and not sudden except for Moshe rabenu who was always ready for prophecy.

Aharon and Miriam were not, since they were impure at that moment and needed to purify themselves. Moshe on the otherhand was always pure.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל משה, to Moses, etc. The reason that G'd called to Moses when it was Aaron and Miriam He wanted to speak to is that the latter were ritually impure at the time and first had to purify themselves.

This is why he was able to be called upon by G'd without having to undergo any preparation.

And why was it written here, even though it discusses the travels of the children of Israel, and the portion before it does not? It is in order to demarcate between the first punishment and the second punishment. What is the second punishment that appears immediately afterward? It is the verse: “And the people complained wickedly in God’s ears, and God heard and became angry, and the fire of God burned in them and it consumed the edge of the camp” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 11:1</a>). What is the first punishment?

In other words, Har Sinai was a lofty and incredibly holy experience where the Shechinah, the Divine Presence, rested. Following Mattan Torah, the Shechinah would move and take up residence in the Mishkan. The Bnei Yisroel who were scared of this powerful Presence did not want it to follow them after Mattan Torah, and it is this reaction that is viewed a punishable offence.</p>\n<p>The second occurrence was that of the \"misonenim\" - those that complained bitterly against Hashem.

It was a Heavenly fire sent to punish those that complained against the actions of G-d, but what was so bad about the seemingly natural reaction of the first incident, and why was it necessary to insert such a dramatic pause between the two?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Regarding the first punishment, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.10.33?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bahya (Bamidbar 10:33)</a> explains this Gemara to mean that as soon as they left the \"environment of Sinai\", the people deviated from following G-d. The Rabbeinu Bahya writes that they fled from the nearness of G-d. The result of this is that different desires began to surface, the desire to eat meat etc..</p>\n<p>The Rabbeinu Bahya then goes on to explain why the Gemara lists this as the first punishment.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why did the sages in Shabbat have to interpret events in this manner? It was to teach us that as soon as the people moved away from Mount Sinai they no longer felt that they were under the immediate benevolent supervision of Hashem. They believed that this kind of supervision existed only right at the Mountain of G’d. The expression הר ה' as opposed to הר האלו-הים is so unusual that the sages felt the essence of the move was “away from the Torah element associated with that mountain.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the commentary of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Numbers.10.35.1?vhe=On_Your_Way_New&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (Bamidbar 10:35)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the meaning of this interpretation [of the Rabbis that they set forward from the mount of the Eternal indicates a punishment, is based on that which] they found in the Agadah, that “they set forward from Mount Sinai with joy, just like a child who runs away from school, saying: ‘Perhaps He will give us more commandments [if we stay]!” This then is the sense of the expression, And they set forward from the mount of the Eternal, meaning that their intention was to remove themselves from there because it was the mount of the Eternal. This is the first “punishment” [i.e., the first sin, as explained further on], and then He interrupted [with the section on the ark] in order that there should not be three punishments one after the other, so that it would have established a basis for further punishment. He called the [first] sin “punishment” even though no actual punishment occurred to them because of it, [but since they deserved to have been punished, it is called a “punishment”]. Perhaps were it not for this sin of theirs He would have brought them into the Land immediately [and so there was indeed a “punishment”].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Haggadah (Magid, Dayenu) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If He had given us the Shabbat and had not brought us close to Mount Sinai; [it would have been] enough for us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Kos Shel Eliyahu, Rabbi Eliyahu Ben Harush <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Dayenu.12?ven=Sefaria_Edition&lang=bi&p2=Kos_Eliyahu_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Dayenu.12&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> this to mean that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>By bringing the people close to Mount Sinai, the Israelites acquired a\nsense of holiness and came to understand that G-d wishes them to\nstrive for holiness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What the Kos Shel Eliyahu says, seems to be in line with the explanation of the Rabbeinu Bahya. As long as they were in the vicinity of Sinai, they would feel the holiness. When they left this environment, people might have lost this special feeling. They just experienced something fascinating. G-d revealed Himself to the Jewish people. How to act aftwerwards?</p>\n<p>This seems to align with Tosfos' idea.</p>\n<p>The same notion is brought down by the Alter of Slabodka, in the sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohr_HaTzafun%2C_Bamidbar%2C_II.4?vhe=Wikisource&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaTzafun (Maamar Chovas HaDveikus BaTorah, Bamidbar 2)</a>. The Alter of Slabodka writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא בעל כורחנו שהפירוש הוא שאמנם עצם פעולת הנסיעה מהר סיני היתה כהוגן ועל פי ה׳, אבל בשמים ראו בתוך מצפוני לבם שלא הרגישו את הצער הדרוש על אשר עליהם להינתק מהמקום שלמדו בו תורה. ואמנם גם הליכתם היתה לשם מצוה, כדי להיכנס לארץ ולקיים מצות ישיבה, כפי שנצטוו עליה, אבל היה צריך להיות קשה להם לפרוש ממצות תלמוד תורה שהיא כנגד כולם, שכל הפורש ממנה כפורש מן החיים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was difficult for the people to withdraw from the place where they just received the Torah. The Shechinah moved on, but the people wanted to stay at the sacred place where they have just received the Holy Torah. The rebellion was punished by G-d, to make the journey three days instead of one day (see also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.116a.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi sv. מאחרי ה</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

Who did these 13 children marry and have children with before coming down to Egypt as a group of 70 people? Presumably there was some admixture with the local inhabitants of Canaan before the descent to Egypt. This could account for an infusion of genetics from the Canaanitic population into the Israelite population from its very inception.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this study compares the genetics of modern Jews, i.e. descendants of Israelites that (traditionally understood) re-entered the Land of Israel (Canaan) and in so doing were not always perfect faithful adherents of the Torah. Many improperly took gentile (Canaanite) wives, and adopted Canaanite practices, etc. Others may have married converts of Canaanite origin. All this would explain, again how another infusion of genetics from Canaanites would have entered into the Israelite nation.</p>\n<p>So when comparing the genetics of modern Jews to that of pre-Israelite Canaanites, it wouldn't be altogether surprising, from a traditional perspective, that there are shared genetics.</p>\n\n\n",

The possible ambiguity is the subject of a teaching in the Midrash.  The Torah says:</p>\n<p>And you shall watch over the matzot. [Ex. 12:17]</p>\n<p>The Midrash says:</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoshiyah says: Do not read אֶת-הַמַצּוֹת, [watch over] the matzot, but אֶת-הַמִצְוֹת, [watch over] the commandments. [The letters are the same, but the vowels are different.] Just as we may not allow the matzot to become leavened, so we may not allow the commandments to become leavened [by waiting too long to perform them].  If [a commandment] comes your way, perform it immediately.  [Mechilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 12:17]</p>\n<p>Thus, the deeper lesson is that we must be prompt in performing all commandments.  The Maharal notes that if the Torah only wanted to talk about matzah, it would have stated “Watch for ḥametz”, that is, make sure sure the matzah is not contaminated. Since the Torah said “Watch over the matzot”, there must be a deeper meaning. So a teaching is needed: Mitzvot must be performed with alacrity, promptly and with cheerful readiness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The letter ו in Hebrew can sometimes stand for either of the two vowels made with the lips--Cholam (ö) and Shuruq (ü).</p>\n<p>A Vav is pronounced as the Cholam vowel if it has a single dot directly above it. It appears as ״וֹ״.</p>\n<p>It is pronounced as Shuruq when the letter before it has no other vowel, and the ו itself it has a dot (dagesh) right next to it, appearing as ״וּ״. If either one of the above criteria are not met, it is a normal, consonantal Vav sound.</p>\n<p>(In Biblical Hebrew, consonantal Vav is like English W. In Modern Hebrew, it is like English V.)</p>\n\n\n",

And it\nalso states: “As I was in the days of my youth, when the converse of\nG-d was upon my tent” (Iyov 29:4). What is the\npurpose of the statement: And it also states: “When the converse of\nGod was upon my tent”? Why is it necessary to cite this verse in\naddition to the previously quoted verse from Mishlei? The Gemara\nexplains: And if you would say that the verse in Mishlei is\ninsufficient, as it is a prophet who is saying that he was taught the\nentire Torah in his mother’s womb, but this does not apply to ordinary\npeople, come and hear the verse in Iyov: “When the converse of G-d was\nupon my tent.” And once the fetus emerges into the airspace of the\nworld, an angel comes and <strong>slaps it on its mouth, causing it to forget\nthe entire Torah,</strong> as it is stated: “Sin crouches at the entrance”\n(Bereishis 4:7), i.e., when a person enters the world he is immediately\nliable to sin due to his loss of Torah knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Horayot.13b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Horayos (13b)</a> says to frequently eat olive oil to regain the Torah once learned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרגיל בשמן זית מסייע ליה לרבי יוחנן דאמר רבי יוחנן כשם שהזית משכח\nלימוד של שבעים שנה כך שמן זית משיב לימוד של שבעים שנה - One who is accustomed to eating olive oil\nrestores forgotten Torah study. This supports the\nopinion of Rabbi Yochanan, as Rabbi Yochanan said: Just as eating an\nolive causes one to forget seventy years’ worth of Torah study, <strong>olive\noil restores seventy years’ worth of Torah study.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone suggest this as a solution to recover all the Torah learned in the womb? If not, what is the incorrect premise of this question? (e.g., Is learning Torah in the womb not called learning Torah?)</p>\n\n\n",

The Talmud talks about extinguishing a fire on shabbos if someone is suffering from depression and it's causing them anguish in a way that could be life-threatening.</p>\n<p>A not-uncommon example today? A lot of people with eating disorders should not be fasting on Yom Kippur. It can trigger a bad cycle of \"if not-eating is holy, then I can be extra holy by doing lots more of not-eating!\" (To take it a step further: if someone tells the rabbi they're mentally sound but have issues with their blood sugar, the rabbi may ask if they can measure the food in small amounts and eat it every ten minutes. If someone has an eating disorder, any encouragement of \"measure/cut/time\" is not going to lead to healthy behavior.)</p>\n<p>Practically, these calls should be made involving consultation with a competent mental-health professional, plus a rabbi who understands the mental-health concerns -- or better yet, get the rabbi to talk with the mental-health professional.</p>\n<p>If you leave this to any individual to try and make their own call, some are going to declare it a mental health emergency when it's not... and a lot more are going to put themselves at risk in ways they shouldn't be.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the hope and plan is that this condition will not be a permanent one.

Taking care of one's health is a mitzvah, and the halacha is clear that taking care of one's health supersedes many other commandments. So if one is sick and recovery means not doing XYZ, <em>that is</em> <em>not considered</em> <em>not adhering to the Torah's commandments.</em> On the contrary, it is adhering to the Torah's commandments; <em>not taking care of one's health would be violating the Torah's commandments.</em></p>\n<p>The Sages spent great effort setting out the laws for the specifics of how to handle conflicts between laws, including health and other commandments. All cases must be asked of a rabbi, as Shalom says. If the rabbi says to prioritize health, then that is the Torah's desire, and it would be sinful to do the opposite and compromise one's health for other considerations.</p>\n<p>Mental health is part of health, and follows the same rules. But one should consult with a professional, as what is beneficial to one person might not work for another depending on circumstances.</p>\n\n\n",

Elyashiv’s name, that any dayyan (judge) who believes the world is more than 5771 years old is a dayyan pasul (disqualified judge) and that his conversions are invalid?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A: It’s an extreme position, and in this case, he had to retract it the next day. It is not a position I would take seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So is it an acceptable belief? Depends who you ask. Do we treat someone who believes it as a heretic to the point of halachic implications? <strong>No.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The large lizards are created in Genesis 1:21</p>\n<p>And God created the <strong>great crocodiles,</strong> and every living creature that crawls, with which the waters swarmed, according to their kind, and every winged fowl, according to its kind, and <strong>God saw that it was good.</strong></p>\n<p>Dinosaur means \"Terrible Lizard\" (in ancient Greek, converted into Latin), however the lizards God creates are good.

    "content": "# Tumat met on the London Underground\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apparently part of London's subway network causes problems for kohanim because it is underneath a museum that includes human remains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Due to the Science Museum and the Underground entrance sharing the\nsame roof, at present, Kohanim are unable to\nuse South Kensington station and any underground line that passes\nthrough it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is, therefore, currently a proposal to build an extra structure outside the entrance to the station: you can see before-and-after pictures <a href=\"https://www.jewishnews.co.uk/tube-station-entrance-could-be-redesigned-to-accommodate-religious-kohanim/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. I've found an explanation which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The proposed structure would be set to left and right of the entrance\nto the subway, with a partial horizontal return above set just under\nthe heavy existing cornice and forming a small roof structure. It is\nunderstood that the intention is symbolically to sever the entrance to\nthe station from the building above, which houses human remains. This\nwould allow access to the station to Kohanim. To be effective in this\nregard it has to extend beyond the outermost line of the cornice to\nthe roof above, and so projects out from the entrance frontage beyond\nthe elevation of the porch structure which it adjoins, although only\non the right hand side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is: how does this 'work' halachically? Looking at the pictures, I can't understand how the partial archway (covering only half of the entrance, ie the right-hand side) would suffice to prevent tumat met from flowing into the subway network. Can anyone figure it out?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that tumah is being transferred via the grey ledge. Perhaps that ledge extends to entrance to the museum both to the right and to the left.</p>\n<p>If that is the case tumah would spread from the entrance of the museum to the area under the ledge (if there is a tefach width). From there it would spread to the entrance to the subway.</p>\n<p>The proposed black structure would stop the tumah from spreading to the entrance of the subway.</p>\n<p>It takes a bit more guesswork to figure out why the black structure needs to extend over the entrance. Perhaps there is something above the entrance, some kind of structure jutting out from the building above. The black structure could be extending beyond the reach of the upper structure and blocking the tuma</p>\n<p>So this would be one scenario which would explain how it would suffice.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the difference between the פְּעַל and פְּעֵל in Aramaic?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>[As a preface I recognize this could be seen as an off-topic language question, but the question came up in the context of Gemara study using a book explaining the Grammar of the Bavli specifically for Gemara students, so I'm hoping the moderators will be lenient and allow the question, in the spirit of R Noson Kamenetzky's haskama to the Frank <em>Grammar for Gemara</em> book that brings a Tosofos Yuntif arguing that learning Aramaic grammar for Torah study is itself Talmud Torah.]</p>\n<p>I'm reading R Yitzchok Frank's Grammar for Gemara book, and I'm looking at the \"complete paradigms\" section (p. 259) where he shows the complete artificial paradigm for a regular Aramaic verb. My understanding is that the \"pe'al\" (פְּעַל) corresponds to the Hebrew pa'al, but in the book there are two \"kal\" binyanim listed, one spelled פְּעַל with the shoresh כתב and one spelled with a \"sere\" פְּעֵל, and the example listed is of the shoresh תקף.</p>\n<p>I'm trying  to understand what the difference is. Is פְּעֵל like a stative relative to the פְּעַל? Is the difference in conjugation due to some phonetic phenomenon? (Difficult to say because both examples have three strong letters.)</p>\n<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I will provide reference to these five Aramaic grammar books:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Caspar Levias, Cincinnati, 1900</p>\n<p>Caspar Levias (Hebrew edition), New York, 1930</p>\n<p>J. N. Epstein, Jerusalem, 1960</p>\n<p>David Marcus, University Press of America, 1981</p>\n<p>Elitzur Bar-Asher Siegal, Germany, 2013</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t have Rabbi Frank’s English book, but I couldn’t locate your example on a whim in the Hebrew version either (the Hebrew volume is called דיקא נמי). That’s okay, I’ll try to explain some of the grammatical points based on some modern and classic grammar books.</p>\n<p>The short answer to your question is that פְּעֵל may be a stative version of פְּעַל, but there are other grammatical designations that grammarians have given פְּעֵל (regarding grammatical case, see Epstein, p. 32, bottom). However, these do not seem to be concrete rules as are the “Binyanim” in their respective designations. Also, this change is not due to a phonetic phenomenon as you correctly surmised; grammarians have only derived rules as to its reasoning, but in essence, it is just an irregularity or corruption present in JBA (Jewish Babylonian Aramaic).</p>\n<p>The very way in which verbs function in Aramaic is not a simple matter. Although Rabbi Frank may use the terms “present, past, future” as a given, grammar works of the 20th century have more nuanced definitions. As an aside, I haven’t looked at Frank’s book in depth, but a casual perusal indicates that’s the case. Of note, however, is that Epstein’s book uses the same tense conventions as Frank, and does not appear to address this topic, despite his forebears’ discussions (I assume this is related to Kutscher’s famous critique of the work, but I have not checked).</p>\n<p>Marcus (p. 7) and Levias (p. 61) explain that JBA has something which is akin to regular tenses called Perfect, Imperfect, and Participle (Levias calls it the present indicated by the participle). These correspond to Past, Future and Present respectively (similar to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_verbs#Tense\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arabic</a>). Beyond the scope of this discussion, is the innovative treatment of TAM [tense, aspect, mood] advanced by Bar-Asher Siegal in chapter 7 (pp. 162ff).</p>\n<p>The existence of פְּעֵל does not seem to be acknowledged by Epstein (p. 34) or Marcus (p. 38). However, Levias discusses this (p. 60; Cf. p. 70f; HE, p. 129):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Qal.— §191. The Qal, or\nsimple stem, consists of the simplest root found in the language. The\n3d sing. masc. perfect is קְטַל, especially with transitive verbs.\nBeside קְטַל are also found קְטֵיל and קְטוֹל, chiefly with neuter\nverbs. The last form is rare. In the imperfect all the three vowels <em>a,\ni, u</em> occur even in strong stems.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Levias defines the קְטֵיל as a “neuter verb”. Goold Brown (<a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Page%3AThe_grammar_of_English_grammars.djvu/339\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">New York, 1882</a>) gives a definition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>IV. A neuter verb is a verb that expresses neither action nor passion,\nbut simply being, or a state of being; as, “There was light.”—“The\nbabe sleeps.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This definition seems to match that of a stative verb (See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stative_verb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia, Stative Verb</a>; Robin Hooper, \"<a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/20705843\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Neuter Verbs, Stative Aspect, And The Expression Of Agency In Polynesian</a>\").</p>\n<p>In his Hebrew edition, Levias (p. 125) adds several more details as regards the nature of the “Qal” verb.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קנט. הבנין הקל בעבר נבנה על שלשה משקלים: פְּעַל, פְּעֵל, ופְעֹל. למשקל\nפְּעַל הוראת פעולה יוצאת לאחר או עומדת; ד\"מ שְׁקַל, לקח; מרד; והמשקלים\nפְּעֵל, ופְעֹל מורים על תכונה ומצב, ד\"מ בְּעֵת, פחד; חֲרֹב. המשקל\nפְּעֵל מורה על תכונה עוברת; ופְעֹל, על תכונה מתמדת. ברבות הימים ההוראה\nהעומדת עוברת לפעמים להוראה יוצאת, ונסיונות החיים מלמדים את האדם לראות\nבתכונות שהיו בעיניו למתמידות רק תכונות עוברות. בהקשה אל העתיד והצווי\nגבולי המשקלים נטשטשו ברבות הימים, ומצאנו עתה פעולות יוצאות לאחר\nבמשקלים פְּעֵל, ופְעֹל, ופעולות עומדות במשקל פְּעֵל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>His outdated linguistic terminology indicates that, although פְּעֵל may follow certain conventions, i.e. that of neuter verb tendencies, the language as a whole has not been upkept in its rigidness. This is a theme covered by Levias throughout all his books, especially in his sharp comments at the beginning of his Grammar on Palestinian Aramaic.</p>\n\n\n",

However, it raises the question of why we assume that women would not experience similar impure thoughts. This is especially relevant in Orthodox synagogues where there may be one-way glass or women looking into the men's section, which is considered a normal practice.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, numerous studies have shown little to no difference in the desire for such matters between men and women. These findings challenge the assumption that women are inherently immune to impure thoughts or distractions during prayer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>(The question here made a bunch of assumptions, but ... let's give this a go ...)</p>\n<p>The Gemara says that when men and women were in the Temple together, there was <em>kalut rosh</em> -- best translated as \"disinhibited behavior\" -- and thus they created a separate section for them.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's opinion was that a mechitzah serves, essentially, two functions:</p>\n<p>A.) To keep the genders from mingling; and a wall sets a stronger tone about this than just asking people to sit separately.</p>\n<p>(If this was the only reason, then a clear glass wall would be okay.)</p>\n<p>B.) The Talmud says a man shouldn't pray near an inappropriately-dressed woman. Many a synagogue has female visitors who are baring \"sleeves and more.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein thus advised a mechitza that was opaque up to five feet -- at which point the only thing visible from the men's side would be the women's heads, assuming an average women's height; and women's heads being visible is not a problem.</p>\n<p>Now what about the women praying in the presence of inappropriately-dressed men?

The book is an attempt at describing the differences between science and religion generally, which he essentially divides into two distinct categories but which can be integrated together; hence \"great partnership\".</p>\n<p>Sacks says that the left side of the brain is responsible to break information down into its constituent parts and see how they interact ('left brain thinking'). In contrast, the right side of the brain is responsible for joining events together so that they tell a story and are relevant for creativity and relationships ('right brain thinking'). The left-brain is responsible for analytical processes (writing, comprehension, computation) whereas the right brain is responsible for intuition and creativity.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Sacks says that good examples of left- and right-brain thinking is science and religion. The mantra that he states throughout is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Science takes things apart to see how they work, religion puts things together to see what they mean\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Sacks uses this thematic idea to contrast \"Jerusalem\" with \"Athens\". He notes that although the alphabets are similar (aleph, bet, gimmel versus, alpha, beta, gamma):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...in the move to Greece the alphabet acquired letters to signal vowel sounds as well as consonants... Then, between the eighth and sixth centuries BCE, it evolved into a strange form of continuous writing, beginning from right to left, then, on reaching the end of the line, turning round and coming back, left to right, and so on. Eventually, in the fifth century, it settled into the new mode, left to right, where it has stayed ever since.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Greek philosophy (Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc.) \"emphasised the universal over the particular, the timeless over the time-bound, the abstract over the concrete particular and the impersonal as opposed to the personal\". He then goes on to state this as a basis for the fundamental differences in the philosophy of Jerusalem and Athens. The Torah tells a narrative story (\"right brain\"), whereas Greek philosophy tells of abstract universalism (\"left brain\").</p>\n<p>Sacks speculates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Could it be that this difference between the two cultures has something to do with the way their respective alphabets are written? Greece, at the time the alphabet was changing from right-left to left-right, became the world's first, and greatest, left-brain civilisation. It was not only a left-brain culture. There was greatness too, in the more right-brain fields of art, architecture and drama. But the conceptualisation and abstraction, the analysis of matter into its atomic parts, the Platonic devaluation of the personal and particular: all this comes with the unmistakable signature of the left hemisphere. The fact that this was hapenning at the same time, in the same place, as the emergence of the wrodls' first fully vowelled, left-right alphabet cannot be merely coincidental. The way we record and transmit information has a huge impact on cognitive styles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah narrative is in tune with right-brain thinking. Furthermore, the lack of vowels in hebrew also gives the Torah an inherent \"interpretive\" element to it. The Greeks used the letters to sound exactly as they are written.</p>\n<p>I will note that this is all speculation since it is not possible to know what the reasons are for the Greeks changing the direction of writing or why Hebrew specifically started as right-left. Ancient Egypt, for example, had both left-right and right-left and even vertical writing. There are pragmatic reasons for making the switch to left-right writing, for example, most people being right-handed, causing ink to smear less when written from left to right.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The chasam sofer answers this question in his shu\"t on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Responsa_Chatam_Sofer,_Orach_Chayim_187.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 187</a>.\n(You have to read the whole piece in order to understand the linked paragraph, so I'm not going to quote it).</p>\n<p>The gist of it though is that there's a gemara in Yuma 59a which discusses how the kohen should sprinkle the blood on the mizbeach. Either he has walk around the mizbeach to the right and go to each of the four corners. Or the opinion holds that the mizbeach was small enough to just stand at one corner and throw the blood to each corner while standing stationary.\nFrom this gemara we learn that \"every turn one makes should be to the right.\" Therefore hebrew is written starting at the right side of the page and since we have to end off on the right side (as per the gemara in yuma), the end of a sefer has words written on the right side of the column leaving the left side empty.</p>\n<p>According to the other opinion in the gemara where one is stationary, the letters themselves are written from left to right. E.g. a \"ר\" is written starting from the top left and ends at the bottom right.</p>\n<p>(Let me know if my explanation is comprehensible. I'm not sure if I explained it well enough.)</p>\n\n\n",

The angel said to him: At a time when there is divine anger and judgment, we punish even for the failure to fulfill a positive mitzva!</p>\n<p>There is an opinion in Tosafos however, that holds that the Gemara is specifically talking about those days, when most garments had four corners, and therefore one should not alter his garments in a way that it would be exempt from Tzitzis, but nowadays one would not have to buy such a garment, according to that opinion in Tosafos</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>Halacha does not require one to put tzitzis on a garment unless the garment that he is wearing has 4 square corners.</strong></p>\n<p>Mitsvah is only if your cloth has 4 squared corners.\nAnswer is no, you are not required to put tzitzis unless you have 4 squared corners.

Rab and Samuel differ on this point. One said that he was a wise king, and the other, that he was a foolish king. The reason for the statement that he was a wise king, can be derived from the fact that he had made the feast first for the remote subjects, because for his townsmen he could make it at any time; and the other said he was a fool, for he should have made it first for his townsmen, so that should the others rebel, they at least would defend him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Achashverosh wanted to show he was a wise king and not an unintelligent leader.

Did anyone read anything interesting about this topic?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Was there a certain geological location on the planet where they arrived/ popped out of ?</li>\n<li>How did they transform from a spiritual state to a physical state? There needs to be a point in time where they transform into physical humans and back into spiritual beings.</li>\n<li>Was there some sort of portal that they used as a highway between heaven and earth? Just exactly how did they 'jump' from the heaven side to earth side?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R' Avraham Azulai explains at the end of Maayan 1 of his work, Chesed LeAvraham that angels are pure souls, and when they come to Earth, they must take on a delicate garment, made up of the spiritual elements of fire and air, but somewhat materialized. The \"fire\" is indeed consuming, but it is contained and won't burn anything.</p>\n<p>This very subtle garment is not like a body, but simply a vehicle with which to operate during their stay in this realm, as they can't otherwise. It is so subtle that not everyone can see it, and it's possible that only the people they are sent to interact with will be aware of the presence of the angel, and once they are done, the garment dissolves back to its source and the angel returns to their source.</p>\n<p>This is not considered a death. The relationship between the angel and the garment is even less significant than the relationship between a human and his clothes, and they do not suffer any pain. In fact, the garment is very uncomfortable for them.</p>\n<p>There is no location or portal. That's not how things work. They simply become \"more concrete\"; they pass through to our world in that process, take on a garment that is composed of materials that are able to interact with the world. The garment is the main thing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The premise of your question may be mistaken. The Rambam in Yosodei Hatorah Pk.2 implies the following: the angels cannot become physical; if they did, it would be a new creation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>☞  וּמַהוּ זֶה שֶׁהַנְּבִיאִים אוֹמְרִים שֶׁרָאוּ הַמַּלְאָךְ אֵשׁ וּבַעַל כְּנָפַיִם. הַכּל בְּמַרְאֵה הַנְּבוּאָה וְדֶרֶךְ חִידָה. לוֹמַר שֶׁאֵינוֹ גּוּף וְאֵינוֹ כָּבֵד כַּגּוּפוֹת הַכְּבֵדִים. כְּמוֹ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים ד כד) \"כִּי ה' אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֵשׁ אֹכְלָה הוּא\" וְאֵינוֹ אֵשׁ אֶלָּא מָשָׁל. וּכְמוֹ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהילים קד ד) \"עשֶֹׁה מַלְאָכָיו רוּחוֹת\":<br />\nWhat is meant by the prophets' statements that they saw an angel of fire or with wings? All these are prophetic visions and parables, as [Deuteronomy 4:24] states: \"God, your Lord, is consuming fire,\" though He is not fire and [the description of Him in this manner] is only metaphoric. Similarly, [Psalms 104:4] states: \"He makes His angels as winds....\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>☞  וּבַמֶּה יִפָּרְדוּ הַצּוּרוֹת זוֹ מִזּוֹ וַהֲרֵי אֵינָן גּוּפִין. לְפִי שֶׁאֵינָן שָׁוִין בִּמְצִיאוּתָן אֶלָּא כָּל אֶחָד מֵהֶן לְמַטָּה מִמַּעֲלָתוֹ שֶׁל חֲבֵרוֹ. וְהוּא מָצוּי מִכֹּחוֹ זֶה לְמַעְלָה מִזֶּה וְהַכּל נִמְצָאִים מִכֹּחוֹ שֶׁל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא וְטוּבוֹ. וְזֶהוּ שֶׁרָמַז שְׁלֹמֹה בְּחָכְמָתוֹ וְאָמַר (קהלת ה ז) \"כִּי גָבֹהַּ מֵעַל גָּבֹהַּ שֹׁמֵר\":<br />\nSince they possess no body, what separates the form [of the angels] from each other? Their existence is not alike. Rather each one is below the level of the other and exists by virtue of its influence, [in a progression of levels,] one above the other.\nEverything exists by virtue of the influence of the Holy One, blessed be He, and His goodness. Solomon alluded to this [concept] in his wisdom, saying (Ecclesiastes 5:7 : \"Because above the one who is high there is a watcher [and there are others higher than them].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note: Look at the whole chapter for yourself, as there's a lot more content talking about this there.</p>\n\n\n",

However,\nregarding illness he wrote merely that “one should reveal it” and that\n“a person who discloses [the information] has not transgressed the\nprohibition of Rechilus”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://medicalhalacha.org/2020/06/24/shiduchim-and-disclosure-of-confidential-medical-information/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> goes on to explain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the majority of the Poskim, a person must spend all of his money, if necessary, to avoid transgressing Lo Sa’amod Al Dam Rei’echa. However, this is only true when attempting to save someone from death or serious injury. When the issue is merely prevention of some sort of damage (for example, refusing to testify in Beis Din and thereby causing a monetary loss to one of the litigants), he would not be obligated to the same extent[4].</p>\n<p>In the majority of cases, refraining from revealing medical\ninformation to a potential spouse, while causing untold harm to their\nquality of life[5], does not lead to a state of Pikuach Nefesh.\nHowever, the loss of a medical license is extremely damaging, as it\nleads to the loss of professional status, career, and income.  HaGaon\nRav Asher Weiss Shlit”a often says that a loss of livelihood should be\ntreated almost as if it is Pikuach Nefesh. Therefore, there are\ngrounds to be lenient and allow a doctor to refrain from revealing\nmedical information for a Shiduch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to summarize:</p>\n<p>The Gemara discusses the illness of Rava. Rava foresaw that people that did not like him, would rejoice when his family members would tell to people that he was sick, so Rava said \"Do not reveal to any person that I am ill\". The Nishmas Avraham quotes Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zt\"l and says that in the case of illness, one should reveal it. One is not obligated to do so. Modern poskim, for example HaGaon Rav Ahser Weiss Shlit\"a would say that a doctor is allowed to not tell information about a certain sickess, since that might lead to the loss of his professional status as a doctor. With regard to praying for someone in a community. If person a would tell you \"Please don't tell others that I'm sick!\", would you still tell people because you want to pray for the speedingly recovery of that person? Or would you accept the wishes of the sick person?</p>\n\n\n",

I got an edition of Torah, printed in London, and which has the Hebrew text accompanied by translation to German, printed in gothic characters. The year of the edition is written as follows:</p>\n<p>\"נדפס בעיר הבירה לונדן בשנת אשרי אדם מצא\nחכמה ואדם יפיק תבונה לפ''ק\"</p>\n<p>I attach the image of the front page. Could someone help to determine its year of print?

However in this case that would put the year in the future. Therefore, it looks like you add up the letters, not counting the ones with a dot on top.</p>\n<p>This adds up to 596. The letters at the end of לפ״ק indicates that it’s only counting the smaller number not the thousands (פרט קטן). It is safe to assume it is in the 5,000’s so it would be the year 5,596 which corresponds to 1836</p>\n\n\n",

Usually they are located at the lowest ship deck, far away from the people on the ship.</p>\n<p>Tumas Ohel is contracted by being in the same room as the corpse. So as a Kohen on a cruise-ship, one should avoid such places. I do not see why a person, let alone a Kohen, should even visit such a place in a ship. They are simply not allowed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The simple way that tumas ohel is contracted is by being in the same room as a corpse. Most Poskim are of the opinion that if there is an open window between the room that the body is in and the room that a kohen is in, he will become tamei d’oraysa as well <a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2010/07/22/a-concise-guide-to-the-halachos-of-taharas-hakohanim/2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>. There is another way that a kohen may become tamei through tumas ohel, which is known as “sof tumah latzeis”, the way in which the corpse will be taken out of the building. This means that if the corpse will be taken out of the hospital through a specific hallway or doorway, that hallway or doorway now has the status of tumas ohel even before the body is taken out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, a Kohen should not be a) withing the same \"roof\" of the place where corpses are, b) in the near area of sof tumah latzeis, the way in which the corpse will be taken out of the ship.</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.371.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Yoreh De'ah 371:1)</a> rules:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Kohen is forbidden to enter beneath an overshadowed space under which there is a corpse, even if it is very large; and [he is] even [forbidden to enter] into another [adjoining] house or another [adjoining] upper storey, which open into that house by means of an opening a square handbreadth in size, and [the prohibition also applies to entering] a house [which opens] into that [latter] house ad infinitum.</p>\n<p>[...]  footnote 3 If a corpse lies in a room, whatever is within the room suffers\ncorpse-uncleanness, and if the room has many doors or exits, even if\nthey are closed, all objects which lie beneath the lintels of these\ndoors or exits become unclean, because we assume that the corpse may\nbe removed through any one of the exits, at which time the corpse and\nthe objects will be together under the lintels, and the objects will\nsuffer uncleanness through overshadowing (v. supra n. 1a). Hence, we\nregard the objects and the corpse as if they were already present\nunder the lintels of the door or exits. But if we know through which\nexit the corpse will be removed, then only that particular exit\nsuffers uncleanness, not the others. This means that that particular\nexit saves the objects beneath the other exits from uncleanness\nthrough overshadowing. The minimum size of such an exit must be one\nhandbreadth square for an olive’s bulk from a corpse in the room, to\nprevent uncleanness from spreading to the other exits, and a minimum\nof four handbreadths square opening will prevent the uncleanness from\nspreading to the other exits in the case where an entire corpse is\npresent in the room.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, will tumas meis spread to other rooms? Well, according to the above, that depends on whether there are any windows or doors that connect them to eachother.</p>\n<p>With regard to a shul that was located near an appartment, Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/18344\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A shul was located in an adjacent building that connected to the apartment where the meis was located. Could kohanim enter the shul to daven on Shabbos? Since I could not ascertain whether or not there were any openings between the two adjacent buildings, I advised that the kohanim not enter the shul until the meis would be removed after Shabbos.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This could also apply to a cruise-ship, right?</p>\n<p>Needless to say, if it is a really small boat, the Kohen is not allowed to step even into it. If it is a big ship, e.g. a cruise-ship, the Kohen isn't allowed to be less than 4 cubits away from the area. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.371.6?lang=bi&with=About&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see Siman 371:6)</a></p>\n\n\n",

While Christians believe themselves to be observant of the Noahide Laws, I'm curious whether there are differences of interpretation such that Judaism teaches Christianity to be in unknowing violation of them. It would seem that observant mainstream (noting the distinction between mainstream and mainline) Christians live in accordance with them all, with the only possible exception of not committing idolatry. So my question probably reduces to, does Judaism teach that Christians (some or all) commit idolatry?</p>\n<p>This itself is complicated, because some Christians (certain Protestants) believe Catholics and Orthodox commit idolatry to Mary and the Saints, while those who practice defend these practices as not being worship. And all mainstream Christians think that Mormons to be polytheistic idolaters. Meanwhile, Jehovah's Witnesses and other Unitarians (who are outside the mainstream) consider Trinitarianism to be idolatry. Where does Judaism draw the line in terms of idolatry between Unitarians vs Protestants vs Catholic/Orthodox vs Mormons?</p>\n<p>And finally, are there any other differences in interpretation of the remaining Noahide Laws?</p>\n\n\n",

Then, every existing physical object was created as a manifestation of existing concepts, in a single uniform state. The process of creation described in the Torah was precisely how each physical concept was isolated from the rest of the abstract mish-mash and put into its proper niche. (Note: the “mish-mash” might be Tohw Vavöhw).</p>\n<p>The Sefer HaYetzirah states that G-D created a thought, and that the thought ascended into a point, and G-D carved the details of the universe on that point, which then becomes the universe. If taken somewhat literally (which should not be done on a whim such as this, as the Sefer Yetzirah is a biblically-ancient Kabbalistic work), this would appear to reflect the beginning stages of the Big Bang: Nothing, then a dot of everything, then the quantum stuff inside the dot is somehow spread a little bit unevenly, then the space inside the dot expands evenly into the full-sized universe.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>There are 3 possible answers that can answer your questions about the process of creation in Jewish text.</p>\n<p><strong>1) The process of creation from a Torah point of view -</strong></p>\n<p>The first Jewish text to teach about the creation of the world is the Torah. The book of Genesis states that the process took 6 days. This account of creation raises some questions and difficulties. Why did it take an all-powerful God six days to create? Couldn't God have created the world instantaneously?[1] It also states that God rested on the seventh day. Does an all-powerful Deity tires?</p>\n<p>Perhaps there is no real difficulty. Ancient Jews did not believe the first chapters of Genesis to be fact. Maimonides explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We ought not to understand, nor take according to the letter, that\nwhich is written in the book of the creation, (the book of\nGenesis.)... The book of Genesis, taken according to the letter,\nespecially with respect to the work of four days, gives the most\nabsurd and the most extravagant ideas of the divinity.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here Maimonides declares that the account of the Creation (in Genesis) is not a fact, that it is an allegory, and that to believe it to be a fact gives the most absurd and the most extravagant ideas of God. It shouldn’t be taken\nliterally. It is only a parable.</p>\n<p>The story contradicts what science teaches. The Torah narrative is not an explanation of the science of the creation of the world. If the book of Genesis is not a book of facts, what Jewish text can we rely upon to show us the scientific process of the creation of the world?</p>\n<p><strong>2) The process of creation from a mystical point of view -</strong></p>\n<p>The Zohar conceives of God as Eternal Nothingness (Ain Sof) from which emanates sefirot (Divine attributes) from which the world emanates. The Ari (Rabbi Isaac Luria), a Kabbalist said that God contracted himself into a very tiny space to and expanded, beginning the process of creation[2]. Many have argued that this view of the Ari precedes the contemporary notion of big bang.</p>\n<p><strong>3) There was no process of creation, the world is eternal -</strong></p>\n<p>The reader will recall the quotation I have already made from Maimonides, where he says, “We ought not to understand nor to take according to the letter that which is written in the book of the Creation.”</p>\n<p>Maimonides held the Aristotelian notion of the eternity of the universe. According to this view, the universe emanates from God. In the view that the universe is eternal, there is no process of creation.</p>\n<p>[1] This is the view of Maimonides</p>\n<p>[2] This is called the theory of contraction</p>\n\n\n",

R' Nachman said only R Nathan knows me. R Nathan had several disciples. So there's no mainstream. Who can say this is chief after this, Rabbeinu ended all that \"Dynasty\" and institutionalism nipping it in the bud and after and repeatedly battle after battle reaching the highest possible level a mortal can reach in Avodath Hashem until there's no more and he always said No just go in private and talk to God and you all have to do this and just be honest.</p>\n<p>Breslev were pretty united as they all know Breslev is just R Nachman until in the last generation b'ah there's some beef between publishers and communities and some \"leaders\" manhigim start acting Rebbeish and so for example in Saba's recordings and bio Yisrael Sabba he tells how one MSS (mefursam Shel sheker) took all the money which Saba gave all the money he could raise to print Rabbeinu's sefarim non profit and this MMS said he'd help print but instead he built himself a large community and name and acts rebbeish r\"l. Probably many members of various communities and mosdot don't hold by these MMS and are NaNaCh to some extent or neutral or ignorant r\"l but they might be there bc of the schools, kollel, funds etc.</p>\n<p>There's a spectrum of beliefs person to person so to make it brief a few extreme might hold Saba is Mashiach this or that (and since he passed away that would be the only \"parallel\" to C mashichists, l'habdil NaNaCh would say) or that he is R Nachman in whatever very strict sense they believe. Of course this results in occasionally even some NaNaCh won't accept or welcome each other so I think that will answer your question re other Breslevers, but they would room together for the RH kibbutz in Uman or Yerushalayim, hard to quantify but quantity isn't necessarily definitive anyway so.\nBarukh Hashem that we had Sabba here in such  recent years who always emphasized Rak Rabbeinu, only Rabbeinu z\"l, and not to regard MSS or any other sheker in the world that Rabbeinu warned us against.</p>\n<p>As for other orthodox I think the vast don't know what Nanach beliefs are or the relevant essential facts and info imo for example</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What was Rabbeinu's last lesson LM II:8 Tiku - Tokhacha where he finally mentioned the Future Song Y YK YKW YKWK that will be sung with the Moshe Mashiach as in Az Yashir and Rashi and Tikunei Zohar daf 51a-b and where he's saying, Who can be this proper Rebuker who needs this Voice of the Nahar the River from Eden like R Akiba said I'm amazed if anyone now could rebuke the generation etc. of course he's alluding to himself and he himself is rebuking bc why is he dying torturously coughing buckets of blood and the generation did not merit and like Moshe Rabbeinu gave his final rebuke etc etc Na Nach</li>\n<li>What is the Petek the letter that Saba discovered in his locked cabinet that only he had the key to bc the other students at yeshiva R Meir Baal haNess would mess with him r\"l</li>\n<li>Videos some viral of people friends of Yoel Ashkenazi who the opposers say was the guy there who forged the Petek just to cheer up Saba from his 17 Tammuz episode and who testify Yoel said God forbid God forbid, Those are lies, I never said I forged it, I did not write that, Saba got that by a miracle ..</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For further info I would recommend Yisrael Sabba his recordings or the bio which is the transcript of that, and of course personally talk to H\"Y with simplicity and truth and ask which is Hitboddedut which was Rabbeinu's main simple advice.

He clearly says that all of these Haggados boil down to Midrashic interpretation of verses in Tanach and aren't certain. Wouldn't that mean we don't really know anything whatsoever to any degree of certainty regarding Hell? Or is Hell different for some reason?</p>\n<p>Edit: Here are the words mainly applicable to my question with emphasis on the specific words in question: וְכָל אֵלּוּ הַדְּבָרִים <strong>וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן</strong> לֹא יֵדַע אָדָם אֵיךְ יִהְיוּ עַד שֶׁיִּהְיוּ. שֶׁדְּבָרִים סְתוּמִין הֵן אֵצֶל הַנְּבִיאִים. גַּם הַחֲכָמִים אֵין לָהֶם קַבָּלָה בִּדְבָרִים אֵלּוּ. אֶלָּא לְפִי הֶכְרֵעַ הַפְּסוּקִים. וּלְפִיכָךְ יֵשׁ לָהֶם מַחְלֹקֶת בִּדְבָרִים אֵלּוּ. וְעַל כָּל פָּנִים אֵין סִדּוּר הֲוָיַת דְּבָרִים אֵלּוּ וְלֹא דִּקְדּוּקֵיהֶן עִקָּר בַּדָּת. <strong>וּלְעוֹלָם לֹא יִתְעַסֵּק אָדָם בְּדִבְרֵי הַהַגָּדוֹת. וְלֹא יַאֲרִיךְ בַּמִּדְרָשׁוֹת הָאֲמוּרִים בְּעִנְיָנִים אֵלּוּ וְכַיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן</strong>. וְלֹא יְשִׂימֵם עִקָּר.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that his reasoning \"and therefore there is machlokes in these things\" seems to be an echo of what he says elsewhere, that anything that has machlokes is clearly not from Sinai.

Therefore, there is a controversy among\nthem regarding these matters. <strong>Regardless of the debate concerning\nthese questions, neither the order of the occurrence of these events\nor their precise detail are among the fundamental principles of the\nfaith.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>12:5 thematically continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ולעולם לא יתעסק אדם בדברי ההגדות, ולא יאריך בדברי מדרשות האמורים\nבעניינים אלו וכיוצא בהן; ולא ישימם עיקר--שאינן מביאין לא לידי אהבה,\nולא לידי יראה.</strong>  וכן לא יחשב הקיצין; אמרו חכמים, תפוח דעתן של מחשבי\nקיצין.  אלא יחכה ויאמין בכלל הדבר, כמו שביארנו.</p>\n<p>A person should not occupy himself with the Aggadoth and Midrashim\nconcerning these and similar matters, nor should he consider them as\nessentials, for study of them will neither bring fear or love of God.\nSimilarly, one should not try to determine the appointed time for the\nmessiah's coming. Our Sages declared: \"May the spirits of those who\nattempt to determine the time of the messiah's coming expire!\" Rather,\none should await and believe in the general conception of the matter\nas explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have cited these two halakhoth in toto, lest there be any ambiguity and so that we may easily reference them.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In 12:4 you left out the preceding clause ויש מן החכמים שאומרים שקודם ביאת המלך המשיח, יבוא אלייהו from your citation. This clause is important for understanding the context - which is what your question concerns. He is discussing the order of events in the messianic process and its details. He is asserting that there is no firm tradition on certain aspects of its details and its order and preoccupying one's self with such matters contributes nothing to proper religious development.</p>\n<p>The Rambam is not discussing \"hell\" (by which I assume you intend גיהנום Gehinnom). For the Rambam, discussion of שכר ועונש (reward and punishment) of the world-to-come would be off-topic here. His focus in this subsection of the sefer is the this-worldly, political institution of monarchy. The other sections similarly concern the this-worldly political institutions of the Jewish nation (i.e. the Sanhedrin, laws of judges, testimony, etc.). It is not the after-life, it is this life. While other commentators may have merged a concept of 'olam haba (the world to come) with the messianic era (such as Nahmanides), that was not the approach and understanding of the Rambam.</p>\n<p>In 12:5 the conjunctive indicates that this halakhah in part continues on the theme of 12:4 whose opening clause sets up the context we note above. In this halakhah he states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולעולם לא יתעסק אדם בדברי ההגדות, ולא יאריך בדברי מדרשות האמורים\nבעניינים אלו וכיוצא בהן; ולא ישימם עיקר--שאינן מביאין לא לידי אהבה,\nולא לידי יראה.</p>\n<p>A person should not occupy himself with the Aggadoth and homiletics\nconcerning these and similar matters, nor should he consider them as\nessentials, for study of them will neither bring fear or love of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here the Rambam makes clear that he is staying on topic (בעניינים אלו וכיוצא בהן) and warns that one should not take a deep dive on midrash/aggadah as regards this topic (the details and timing of the this worldly messianic process) for it does not bring one to greater Ahabhah and Yirah (love and awe of God). This clause similarly confirms that we are not discussing שכר ועונש (reward and punishment of the world to come). Unlike discussions such as whether Elijah will come before or after a particular date, שכר ועונש are topics whose discussion does naturally produce Ahabhah and Yirah.</p>\n<p>IMHO based on the context, as made clear in the opening clause, the theme, and its placement in the work, it is quite evident that these two halakhoth are not about hell nor a blanket statement about Hazalic interpretations and traditions.</p>\n<p>All the best.</p>\n\n\n",

Would like to utilize Judaic teachings, perhaps in a contemporary orthodox-oriented book that's very well written and compassionate, drawing both on Mikra, Kabbalah but also on psychology, to incorporate and adopt within positive parents, this in order to heal and move on.

To offer a resolution: The text is informing the inhabitants of the exile that the city’s perimeter will be 18,000 measuring rods, which is equivalent to the number of worlds through which the Holy One, blessed be He, glides at night. As stated in Tractate Avodah Zarah: “What does He do by night?... It may be said that He rides a light cherub, and glides in 18,000 worlds, as intimated by the verse, ‘The chariot of God is twice (שִׁנְאָן) 10,000 times 2,000 angels.’ Do not read shin’an, ‘twice,’ [rather] read [it] she’einan, ‘that are not’ [i.e., twice 10,000 minus 2,000].” Thus, by mentioning the dimension 18,000, the verse is alluding to these worlds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Milstein-edition <a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781422616192.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">(Artscroll, p. 427)</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.48.35?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1</a> it quotes the Maharal's Chiddushei Aggadah and says that these (eighteen thousand worlds) are the total number of worlds that are under the protecion of G-d.

The numerical value of lo, spelled lamed vav, is thirty-six. The Gemara asks: Is that so? But doesn’t Rava say: The row of the righteous before the Holy One, Blessed be He, extends eighteen thousand parasangs, as it is stated with regard to the city of God at the end of days: “It shall be eighteen thousand reeds round about, and the name of the city from that day shall be: The Lord is there” (Ezekiel 48:35)? The Gemara answers: It is not difficult; this statement of Abaye refers to the thirty-six righteous people who view the Divine Presence through a luminous crystal [be’ispaklarya], and that statement of Rava refers to the multitudes who view the Divine Presence through a crystal that is not luminous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Iyun Yaakov (עיון יעקב) builds upon this statement and quotes the Torah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.10.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishlei 10:25</a>, where it says that the righteous people are the foundation of the world, tzadik yesod olam.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but the righteous is an everlasting foundation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara here refers to these Tzadikim by calling them \"worlds,\" because the Tzadik is the foundation of the world, which enables the world to endure, as the verse says, \"Tzadik Yesod Olam\" (Mishlei 10:25).

But one that is not for the sake of Heaven will not endure. Which is a controversy that is for the sake of Heaven? The controversy of Hillel and Shammai.

[Pirkei Avot 5:17]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sure, Korach's timing and his motives were bad, but his controversy <em>did</em> endure.  A “controversy that endures” is one that is worthy of resulting in permanent change. His point was ultimately upheld.  The priests, the Levites, the Sadducees, the Jewish aristocracy all lost power after the Second Temple was destroyed.  Spiritual power became vested in the rabbis, who rise to their position thanks only to their own merit.  The kohanim and leviim have only ceremonial positions.  So, in that sense, Korach’s controversy did “endure”.  His descendants did well.  His three sons composed eleven of the psalms [Ps. 42, 44-49, 84-85, 87-88] and the prophet Samuel was his descendant.</p>\n<p>What am I missing?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Without getting into the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/135552/did-korachs-controversy-endure#comment450938_135552\">weeds</a> on whether today's rabbinical hierarchy reflects  or validates Korach's position, I think you're using an overly expansive definition of \"will not endure.\" The very fact that Korach's story is recorded in Torah refutes the interpretation that nothing at all endured of the controversy. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura%20on%20Pirkei%20Avot%205:17:1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> to the mishna offers two narrower definitions, namely that Korach did not survive and his selfish aims were not achieved:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Every argument that is for [the sake of] heaven's name, it is destined (literally, its end is) to endure:</strong> That is to say that the\n[parties to] the argument are destined to endure and not perish, as\nwith the argument between Hillel and Shammai, [whereby] neither the\nstudents of the School of Hillel nor the students of the School of\nShammai perished.

    "content": "# Does contemporary orthodox Judaism teach that \"Satan\" exists?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The figure of Satan (and not <em>a</em> שטן, which can be used as an adjective or a role) - an opposite counterpart to God, or a rebellious angel who has embraced, and epitomizes evil - is quite prominent in many currents of Christianity; but Jews are not that \"big\" on the notion of Satan, so to speak.</p>\n<p>In fact, if we look at the bible, <a href=\"https://www.learnreligions.com/jewish-view-of-satan-2076775\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it seems</a> that other than some uses of the word שטן in the sense of adversary-to-something/someone - Satan as such is mentioned only in the book of Zechariah, and featured prominently in the story of Job/Iyov. And that one does not attempt to explain how there's no Satan anywhere basically, but in that story he's a central character. The first episode just goes: \"וַיְהִי הַיּוֹם--וַיָּבֹאוּ בְּנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים, לְהִתְיַצֵּב עַל-יְהוָה; וַיָּבוֹא גַם-הַשָּׂטָן, בְּתוֹכָם. \" - a weird introduction: Yeah, Satan, sure, everybody knows about Satan, except how he's basically never been mentioned before at all.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I know that in the Talmud and later, there is mention of Satan, and we have these MY.SX questions answers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/100804/4996\">Does Satan have 12 wings?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9243/4996\">Do religious Jews generally believe the serpent of Garden of Eden was Satan?</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>which mention the Satan-is-a-fallen-angel option, the Satan-is-a-metaphor-for-Yetzer-Ha'ra option, etc.; and works such as Pirkei Rabi Eliezer, Yalqut Shim'oni and other texts. Very well, but that doesn't seem very significant and central to Jewish religious thought on most matters, on how to live one's life etc. And statistically, Satan is not mentioned that often in Jewish-religious texts (correct me if I'm wrong).</p>\n<p>My question is where things stand these days - but not in the realm of philosophizing and pilpulim on \"Can Satan be said to exist\"; I'm interested in terms of what religious Jewish people, particularly children, are taught. Do teachers, and parents, tell children that Satan exists, that they need to beware Satan, that they should resist challenges and temptations by Satan (and I don't mean the Yetzer Ha'ra)? Or - is it something that may be invoked in some occasional story in a mostly-allegorical way?</p>\n<p>And the same question for Rabbinical orations in synagogues and other public events: Is the public cautioned regarding the activity of Satan? Are undesirable events, people or organizations often described as Satanic, or under the influence of Satan? Or is that considered somewhat demagogic, and a rhetorical style respectable people would refrain from?</p>\n<p>Note: I'm asking about more mainstream/orthodox Jewish communities and traditions, not smaller minority groups, not Reform Judaism, etc. Maybe even that is too wide a question - feel free to comment about this point.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Isaac, the site founder, has asked me to put my personal experience answer into an answer, so I hope that's ok :)</p>\n<p>I've read your question and many of your comments and I'll confirm that what QwertyCTRL. said in their answer is what I was taught in Yeshiva.</p>\n<p>What they wrote there will also help you understand what the typical Satan education and cultural significance is in orthodox Jewish life. Firstly, how young children are told the explanation that this angel is in the role of 3 guises that affect us in various ways is not fixed. It depends on the school and the family. Some may have bright inquisitive children and a certain personality that will explain this when they are young, and some will never mention it.</p>\n<p>I should note at this point that Satan is not the name of the angel, but one of the 3 roles. Therefore, pretty much the only time you'll hear people mention the Satan is in and around Rosh Hashana, where we have the famous story from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.16b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> about the Satan rising to accuse us, and how the shofar will confuse him.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, we never say the name of the angel in question, and the vast majority of the time we talk about him in any way is when we are talking about the Yeitzer Hara. This will feature a lot in education and discipline from a fairly young age, and many children will know that he is an angel. In some chassidic circles, they likely also have strong associations of the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/924915/jewish/Evil-Inclination-vs-Animal-Soul.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeitzer Hara and the animal soul</a>.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, no we do not have much to do with the Satan. I've definitely heard some Rabbis who like to use reference to him in certain talks reasonably frequently, but it's not necessarily common (but the orthodox world is large, remember this is just an anecdotal answer). We are not scared of him, although we respect him and recognise we need Hashem's help battling him (there is a lot of liturgy on this, on defeating the Yeitzer Hara). We view him as part of Hashem's plan, Hashem's servant, and something that is absolutely necessary to Hashem's plan.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Additional comments since looking at OP's feedback:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The traditional Jewish belief system is insanely uniform, given how ancient it is. This particular subject is prevalent in the Talmud, and stems from sources at least as ancient as 2000 years, and likely stem back to Moshe as Sinai. As such, there will be very little variation, regardless of location, as almost all Jewish communities have had access to Talmud and Talmudic Rabbinates since the times the Talmud was composed, and have it venerated as the highest authority in Jewish Oral Tradition. On top of that, there has been many writings across the years by our chief sages that the Christian belief that Satan is an enemy of God, ch'v, is heretical, so there has been an internal pressure to not add any extra fabrications to the subject of Satan. This may have happened in some very far flung, disconnected communities, but they will represent the tiny tiny minority. Otherwise, what you grow up with in USA will be identical to what you grow up with in UK, Israel, Australia, Yemen, Latin America etc etc.</li>\n<li>It is very important to stress that we have zero associations with Satan as an enemy of God, and in fact we put emphasis to explain that this is <strong>not</strong> the case in our education. Our aversion to anything-idolatry-sounding is huge and concrete. For this reason we refer to him as \"the satan\", to capture that it is a role, a job, not a demigod or independent force. It is with this in mind that we phrase anything about Satan. We would never say \"we pray for protection from evil and satan\", but more like \"we pray for help to live righteous lives, and strength to overcome our temptations, and to not be tested, so that the satan has cannot accuse us\".</li>\n<li>I also can't stress enough how small a subject this is in normal conversation. Most religious Jews, in any community, will know almost nothing about this angel (or angels in general), beyond the basics we have generally outlined in the answers to this question. There may be midrashim and all sorts of esoteric references to satan, evil etc, but rarely are they of any interest to normal Jewish education. Certainly a secular person would find orthodox jews to sound a little bit superstitious and bible-bashy, but I would say in comparison to a stereotypical bible thumping Christian, we would sound very down to earth and normal in comparison, because the parts of the bible and oral tradition that we obsess over is not the midrashic passages of hell and brimstone and lords of the underworld and all that, but the fine details of the day to day laws that we practice, the festivals that are coming, some interesting logical debate in the Talmud, and theological discussions about God. If we talk about evil, we will talk about it far more philosophically, and even mystically, but definitely not with the fervour of a southern Baptist preacher, if you know what I mean. I understand I am invoking a stereotype, but that's only so I can make my point. Generally, the way we speak, and bless each other, and discuss religious themes, is very different to what the OP is bringing up in and around the comments, in a specific way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>What I was taught as a child and what I teach my own children is as follows:\nThe Satan is an angel whose job it is to tempt humans to sin and act as the \"prosecutor\" when we do sin. He has no independent will other than to do his job.</p>\n<p>We understand that prayers to save us from the Satan to be similar to the prayers not to give us \"tests\" or bad urges (which is included in a parallel prayer to the one pictured by @Yaacov Deane).

And those who study it not for it’s own sake, the Torah will be for them like a סם <strong>ה</strong>מות, and elixir of death.</p>\n<p>So my question is, why the added “hey” by elixir of death, implying that it’s <em>the</em> elixir of death, or potentially implying this will guaranteed be what causes you to die.

This midrash is a compilation of midrashic fragments on Esther collected by a scribe who had copied Midrash Abba Gurion and added some fragments from other Esther midrashim he had encountered and titled the fragments as 'Midrash Panim <strong>Acherot</strong>', apparently simply to differentiate between the well-known Esther midrashim (Rabbah and Abba Gurion) and these fragments, whose names he did not know. This compilation was then copied by another scribe in what's now known as MS Bodl. 155/MS Mich. 577 (unfortunately, this MS has yet to be digitized). The 'Acherim' was a term introduced by Buber in his edition for dubious reasons. These fragments were probably redacted no later than the 7th-8th centuries CE, and are based in part on Esther Rabbah.

Or, maybe they are close to them and they are without sin and the evil inclination does not control them. Therefore, perhaps there is no need for justice and sustenance, and G-d in His mercy and grace deals with this world (i.e. our world) day by day because we are full of sins and the evil inclination controls us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, if this is the difference he wonders as to what type of worlds these actually are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא פירשו לנו רבותינו ז\"ל אם יש בהן באותן העולמות בריות כמותנו שיצר הרע שולט בהם או אם הם מלאכים ורוחות למה הם צריכים לעולמות כמותנו די להם אויר או הרקיעים וכיון שאין ברור לנו כל זה אין אנו יכולים לפרש בזה כלום על בוריו וגם יש מי שמחשב בלבו ואומר שאלו הי\"ח עולמות הם סביבות זה העולם בתוך הגלגלים האלו שאנו בהן ולעניות דעתין לא יתכל זה לומר</p>\n<p>Our Rabbis of blessed memory did did not explain to us if in those worlds there are creatures like us that the evil inclination controls, or, if they are angels and spirits why do they need worlds like us? The atmosphere or the heavens are enough for them, and since we are not clear about all of this, we cannot interpret anything about it. And also if one were to think in his heart about these 18,000 worlds, that they are within the spheres surrounding our worlds, but in my humble opinion this is not possible to say this…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He therefore concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אלא פירוש הדבר לעניות דעתין לדעת האומר הדבר שהוא הלכה כי חוץ מזה העולם כלו ברא המקום י\"ח אלף עולמות כמו זה העולם כל אחד ואחד כמו זה העולם בגלגליו ואויריו ז' רקיעים וששה אוירין וכל מה שיש ביניהן הכל כמו זה העולם וצורתו ועניניו בלי חיסור ובלי יתור</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rather the explanation of the matter according to my humble opinion is to acknowledge that G-d created these 18,000 worlds outside our world (beyond our solar system?), and each and everyone of them is like our world with its spheres and atmosphere - with it seven skies and six levels of atmosphere. And everything that is between them is everything like this world in its form and matter without anything lacking or extra.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he thus closes, each of these worlds continued to expand until Hashem said \"די\" - \"Enough\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22063&st=&pgnum=404&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maamar 4, Drush 2</a> (Starts on the penultimate paragraph of the page)</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Although please note in the subsequent paragraph he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Of course, this Talmudic quotation is by no means absolute proof, for it may be speaking of spiritual worlds, of which an infinite number were created.

In the presence of the kings of the East and of the West, the sinner began to boast, saying: 'Who is the Lord, that I should hearken unto His voice, to let Israel go? Why comes He not before me, like all the kings of the world, and why doth He not bring me a present like the others? This God of whom you speak, I know Him not at all. Wait and let me search my lists, and see whether I can find His Name.' But his servants said, 'We have heard that He is the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings.' Then Pharaoh asked My messengers, 'What are the works of this God?' and they replied, 'He is the God of gods, the Lord of lords, who created the heaven and the earth.' But Pharaoh doubted their words, and said, <strong>'There is no God in all the world that can accomplish such works besides me, for I made myself</strong>, and I made the Nile river.</p>\n<p>well, I read several midrash that mention that the pharaoh of Moses believed himself to be god.\naccording to the passage of R.Louis Ginzberg, Pharaoh said: <strong>(There is no God in all the world that can accomplish such works\" created the heaven and the earth\" besides me, for I made myself)</strong></p>\n<p>Does anyone know where this specific Midrashic Passage can be found?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Midrash Tanchuma <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Vaera.5.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vaera 5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When they finally stood before Pharaoh, he said: “What do you desire?”\nMoses replied: The God of the Hebrews has sent me to you to say: Let\nMy people go that they may serve Me (Exod. 7:16).

R. Haim Kanievsky wrote to me (printed\nin BaTorah Yebhakshu Mipihu) that according to the Gemara in Menahoth\n(42) every miswah in which its performance does not complete a miswah\nthere is no need to bless upon it, and so to here its performance does\nnot complete the miswah for the ‘abhodah is still required to be\nperformed. However it would appear that the Aharonim are divided on\nwhat clothing it is is permitted to wear during the ‘abhodah in the\nMiqdash (Temple), if it is a positive command as an aspect of the\n‘abhodah or is it a positive command of wearing the vestments and it\nwould appear that if it has a power of deferral in the essence of the\ndonning of the vestments then it would absolutely be considered a\ncomplete positive commandment [unto itself]. Perhaps one can\ndifferentiate between the clothes of the Kohen Gadol (High Priest) and\nthe Kohen Hedyot (common Priest) and when I asked R. Dobh Landau he\nsaid that since we haven’t found [any blessing explicitly mentioned by\nHazal] it’s possible that there was no blessing even if it otherwise\nconforms to the principles transmitted by the Rishonim about\nblessings, for there is a responsum by the Rashba in which he writes\nto his son that all of the rationales the he writes about in responsum\n18 they are not the fundamental rationales rather whatever Hazal\nwanted to enact, they enacted and whatever they didn’t want to enact\nthey didn’t enact. However in truth we find among the Rishonim\nblessings that aren’t mentioned in the Talmud (see Rashi ‘Erubhin 50\non semikhah and more) and R. Aharon Yehuda Leib Shteinman adjudged\nthat if the Kohanim blessed, they would have been required in a manner\nin which the blessing is commenced with “that has sanctified us with\nthe sanctity of Aharon” such as when they bless in Birkhath Kohanim\nand upon the consumption of Terumah, since all of these miswoth are\ndependent upon the sanctity from Aharon. R. Moshe Mordekhai Shulsinger\nnotes that based on the words of the Arsoth ha-Haim it would seem that\nthe blessing ought commence with “that has sanctified us with His\ncommandments and commanded…”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Q3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>would they recite a blessing for each garment individually, or one for all of them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hakorbanot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mekhon Torath ha-Qorbanoth</a>, an organization dedicated to promoting the study of laws appertaining to the Miqdash (Temple), so that they may be readily implemented when it is rebuilt puts out a periodical. In Gilyon Torath ha-Qorbanoth, vol. 42, p. 3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה המנחת חינוך מצוה צט יג הביא מהגמ' ביומא דאסור\nשתיקדם לבישת שום בגד ללבישת המכנסיים וחוקר מה הדין אם הקדים את לבישת\nהכתונת למכנסיים האם צריך להסירה וללבוש כסדרן או שמא הרי זה דומה לדברי\nהט\"ז שאע\"פ שצריך להקדים תפילין של יד לתפילין של ראש אם עבר והניח של\nראש קודם אין צריך להסירן וכתב הגאון רבי אברהם יעקב זילברשטיין שליט\"א\nבספרו אבני חן דנראה דשאני תפילין ששתי מצוות הן של יד ושל ראש ואין\nמעכבות זו את זו וכשהניח של ראש קודם כבר נגמרה מצותה ולכן אין צריך\nלהסירה מה שאין כן בבגדי כהונה כל הבגדים הוי מצוה אחת של לבישה ולכן אם\nהקדים הכתונת יצטרך להסירה שהרי עדיין יכול לתקן זאת שעוד לא נגמרה מצות\nהלבישה עכת\"ד ולפי זה נראה דודאי שהברכה תהיה כללית ולא פרטית על כל בגד</p>\n<p>The Minhath Hinukh (Miswah 99, 13) cites the Gemara in Yoma that it is\nforbidden to clothe one’s self into any garment prior to clothing\none’s self in pants, and so we investigate what is the law if one\ndresses in the ketoneth before putting on pants, does he need to\nremove it in order to get dressed according to the proper order, or\nperhaps it is similar to the Ture Zahabh who holds that even though\none ought wrap the tefillin of the arm prior to the tefillin of the\nhead, if he has transgressed and already placed the head tefillin on\nhe does not need to remove it. R. Abraham Yaaqobh Zilberstein in his\nbook Abhnei Hen explains that it appears that this due to the fact\nthat tefillin is comprised of two miswoth, that of the arm tefillin\nand that of the head tefillin, and one is not me’aqebh (preventative)\nof the other, accordingly when one places the tefillin of the head on\nfirst he has already fully completed the performance of that miswah\nand accordingly he does not need to remove it [so that he can put on\nthe tefillin of the arm and then return the tefillin of the head].\nHowever, the same is not the case with the priestly vestments, donning\nall of the garments is collectively one miswah of wearing them, and so\nif one has first put on the ketoneth, he would need to remove it as he\ncan still rectify it as the miswah of donning the priestly vestments\nhas not yet been completed in its entirety (until here is the\nsubstance of his words). And according to this, it would appear that\ncertainly a blessing over the donning of the priestly vestments would\nbe over them collectively and not individually on each garment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The context of this verse however is more about idolatry than say, mere interaction. This is also repeated in Leviticus 19:31. That being said, many Jewish sources have historically also advised against any involvement with ghosts. For instance, Ibn Ezra says to not seek to request their services (as Saul did I Samuel 28:8). This implies that the main prohibition is to use the ghosts to inquire from them - i.e. reaching out to ghosts first. My question is then, what if the (neutral) ghosts are the ones who reach out to us (to say, only chat with us)? Are we to simply ignore the ghost and avoid the contact? What if the said ghost refuses to go away (if we ignore it or if we tell it to go away)? This all relates to how far would the halachic prohibitions apply and what we should do in such a case for its questionable whether it would even be a halachic prohibition in this context.</p>\n<p>The answer to this question should probably avoid sources like Rambam who didn't believe that ghosts existed and/or could be communicated with.

There is an inhabited latitude where daylight sometimes\nprevails for almost the entire twenty four hours.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The mechanism for this epigenetic effect seems to be based on what the mother sees, as we learn from Yaacov in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.30.37?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 30:37-39</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Jacob took himself moist rod[s] of trembling poplar and hazelnut,\nand chestnut, and he peeled white streaks upon them, baring the white\nthat was on the rods. And he thrust the rods that he had peeled, into\nthe gutters in the watering troughs where the animals would come to\ndrink opposite the [other] animals, and they would come into heat when\nthey came to drink. And the flocks came into heat by the rods, and the\nanimals bore ringed, spotted, and striped [young].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.30.38?lang=en&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on 38</a>, based off of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.30.38?lang=en&with=Rashi&lang2=en&p3=Bereishit_Rabbah.73.10&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 73:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They would come into heat — The female animal saw the rods, it was\nstartled at the sight of them and recoiled; its mate then pairing with\nit, it afterwards gave birth to young marked similar to the rods</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan, known for his exceptional beauty, would sit outside the mikva so women would see him and as a result have beautiful children. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.20a.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 20b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yochanan would go and sit by the entrance to the ritual bath. He\nsaid to himself: When Jewish women come up from their immersion [after\ntheir menstruation,] they should see me first so that they have\nbeautiful children like me</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The modern understanding of this is likely linked to epigenetics. Commonly, it is thought everything about us is hard coded into our genes. This is partly true, but there is variability in how the genes are expressed. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/science/dutch-famine-genes.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This is a famous example</a>. It seems something in the mind of the parents, especially the mother, can affect gene expression, which includes <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8358448/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the shape into which their children's bodies develop</a>, as well as personality traits.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As for when humans stopped looking like Adam and we ended up with a diverse range of racial body types, I am not sure. It seems likely that this happened before the tower of bavel, as the 70 nations were all in place by that point. There are sources that indicate that even the 3 sons of Noach each had a different skin colour.

The three principal races are Africans (those who live south of the Sahara), East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans), and Caucasians (Europeans and the peoples of the Near East and the Indian subcontinent). In each of these races, a different set of genes has been changed by natural selection.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a subject matter I am familiar with, but from the article, your premise of needing more time than the Torah allows for races to be created is not necessarily in line with science.

Shulchan Aruch, for example basically says to do the 39 also (except he says 40). This didn't start with the Ari; it started with Rashi (and the Rambam, in absence of Tekhelet). The Kabbalastic innovation was the Havaya (10-5...) method.</p>\n<p><strong>Bottom line nowadays</strong>, do whatever you want. Yalkut Yosef brings both tying customs. The distinction between Tallit Gadol and Kattan is brought in Magen Avot (ad loc.) by Rav Mordechai Lebhar citing Nehar Mitzrayim, Shemesh uMagen 3:32:2, and R' Yehoshua Maman. Ultimately, you fulfill the mitzvah regardless, and all these tying methods are just additional, post Talmudic, layers of remazim given the absence of Tekhelet.</p>\n\n\n",

So this is (what's meant by) WHARZ HYTH THU WBHU WHSK WRUaCH [from THU to WRUaCh is four names plus three Waw = 7] - these are the comparts of the earth: (First, bottom) <strong>Eretz (earth), Adamah (soil), Gey (valley), Neshiyah (oblivion), Tziyyah (dryness), Arka (??), and (seventh) Tevel</strong>. The largest (most important, outermost) is <strong>Tevel</strong>, as it's written (Ps. 9:9), \"And He will judge Tevel in righteousness.</p>\n<p>daf 40a</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yossi asked, \"What is Tziyyah?\"</p>\n<p>He replied, That's where Gehenom-hell is, as it says \"Tziyyah and Talmawwet.\" (Another thing: as it's wrtitten) (in the word) WHSK AL-PNY-THUM - this is the secret of the location of genehom. This is Tziyyah, the place of the angel of death, like we said he darkens the face of creation, and this is the place of the Upper HSK-darkness.</p>\n<p>THU is Neshiyah, that's totally invisibile, so much that it's NSY-lifted away from everybody, that's why it's called Neshiyyah.</p>\n<p>UBHU is Arka, a place that's not \"lifted away.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chiyya says no, that would be Gey.

All of them are the compartments/dwelling places of supernal angels, these ones above the others. It's the same way down below. They all clong to one another, so that they can be one.

For whom? \"For they that love Him and keep His commandments.\" (Ex. 20:6). For the wicked who are those that do not turn around in Teshuvah in these three reincarnations, it's said of them (Lev. 23:21), \"And I will destroy that soul from amid its people.\" Rabbi said, \"If so I'm going down!\" But rather, there are seven earths, constituting seventy, corresponding to the seventy souls [of Yisrael]. Seven earths, they are: <strong>Eretz Adamah Arka Gey Tziyyah Neshiyyah Tevel</strong> - and they are the seven compartments of Gehenom/hell! That Nefesh that doesn't return in Teshuvah in these three [incarnations], the Holy Blessed One sends him down in these three compartments of hell, and that's where he stays forgotten from era to era.</p>\n<p>אֲבָל לְצַדִּיקַיָּא וְעֹשֶׂה חֶסֶד לַאֲלָפִים (שמות כ, ה), אֲלָפִים וַדַּאי, תְּלַת גִּלְגּוּלִין בְּהוֹן אִיהוּ רָוַוח תְּלַת אַלְפִּין דְּאִינוּן עָלְמִין דִּכְסוּפִין, וּלְמָאן לְאֹהֲבָיו וּלְשֹׁמְרֵי מִצְוֹתָיו (שמות כ, ו), לְחַיָּיבַיָּא דְּאִינְהוּ לָא יַחְזְרוּן בִּתְיוּבְתָּא בִּתְלַת גִּלְגּוּלִין אִלֵּין, אִתְּמַר בְּהוֹן (ויקרא כג, לא) וְהַאֲבַדְתִּי אֶת הַנֶּפֶשׁ הַהִיא מִקֶּרֶב עַמָּהּ, אָמַר רַבִּי אִם כֵּן אָנָה נָחִית, אֶלָּא שֶׁבַע אַרְעִין אִינוּן, וְסָלְקִין לְשַׁבְעִין לָקֳבֵל שִׁבְעִים נֶפֶשׁ, וְשֶׁבַע אַרְעִין אִינוּן אֶרֶץ אֲדָמָה אַרְקָא גֵּיא צִיָּה נְשִׁיָּה תֵּבֵל, וְאִינוּן שֶׁבַע מְדוֹרִין דְּגֵיהִנָּם, הַהִיא נַפְשָׁא דְלָא חָזְרָה בִּתְיוּבְתָּא בְּאִלֵּין תְּלַת, נָחִית לָהּ קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא בְּמָדוֹרִין דְּגֵיהִנָּם אִלֵּין, וְתַמָּן אִתְנַשֵּׁי לְדָרֵי דָרִין.</p>\n<p>But if he's a Tzaddik it's said of him (Prov. 24:16), \"Yea, seven times He brings down a Tzaddik, and he gets up.\" Rabbi Elazar said to him, \"But if he's a Tzaddik why does he go down there?

    "content": "# Missing genealogy names\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the beginning of Parshat Korach, the posuk reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקַּ֣ח קֹ֔רַח בֶּן־יִצְהָ֥ר בֶּן־קְהָ֖ת בֶּן־לֵוִ֑י וְדָתָ֨ן וַאֲבִירָ֜ם בְּנֵ֧י אֱלִיאָ֛ב וְא֥וֹן בֶּן־פֶּ֖לֶת בְּנֵ֥י רְאוּבֵֽן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The lineage of Korach is given straight back to Levi (Yitzhar, K'hat, Levi). Rashi explains that the lineage stopped with Levi so as not to include Ya'akov:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It does not, however, make mention of Levi being “the son of Jacob”, because he (Jacob) offered prayer for himself that his name should not be mentioned in connection with their (the Korahites') quarrels</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So not being listed in geneology is for the benefit of the unlisted person.</p>\n<p>The lineage of Datan and Aviram is even more incomplete. They are listed as children of Eli'av, from Reu'vein. Palu, their grandfather (who would be between Eli'av and Re'uvein, as per Bam 26:7-9) is not listed.</p>\n<p>On is then mentioned as the son of Pelet but Pelet isn't even listed among any of the family trees of Re'uvein that I found, so not only is the connection to the tribe not confirmed, but the family member listed (Pelet) isn't connected at all. (yes, according to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/50684/what-happened-to-korachs-third-co-conspirator\">this</a>, he absented himself later, but that doesn't clear up his lineage)</p>\n<p>First, if anyone can find other mentions of Pelet to figure out whose Re'uvein family he is from, that would be appreciated.</p>\n<p>Second, if Rashi explains why Ya'akov isn't listed, does anyone explain why the missing generations in the families of On and Datan and Aviram are not mentioned? Did they have a special z'chut so as not to be associated, parallel to Ya'akov's request?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Only a partial answer:</p>\n<p>The Chizkuni on Bamidbar (16:1), regarding Datan and Aviram and Pelet says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בני ראובן</strong> אליאב ופלת, פלת הוא פלוא ואליאב בנו כדכתיב ובני פלוא אליאב</p>\n<p><strong>Sons of Reuven</strong> [this is regarding] Eliav and Pelet; Pelet is Palu [son of Reuven] and Eliav is his son, as it says \"and the sons of Palu is Eliav\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The Abarbanel and Siftei Chachamim on that Passuk say the same thing. Malbim on Bamidbar 26:8 says something similar as well, but it's a little more nuanced.)</p>\n<p>So On ben Pelet isn't missing any ancestors: On - Pelet/Palu - Reuven. As for Datan and Aviram, this is speculation but maybe Eliav is included in the \"ben Pelet\", or at least 'covered' by it, in which case they also don't have any missing ancestors: Datan and Aviram - Eliav - Pelet/Palu - Reuven.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As an aside, <a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> mentions that Pelet might be Palu, but doesn't give a source.

Ve'On ben Pelet) it is stated that On is Eliav and Pelet is Palu. In the same place Rabbi Kanievsky mentioned a Yemenite Midrash which stated that On is actually Nemuel (he also cited a strange opinion by the Rokeah that Pelet is Pelet ben Yonatan from Yehudah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.33?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:2:33</a>)).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To add to the answer of @Loani there is a midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.18.20?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabba 18:20</a> which explicitly says that neither On nor Peles are real names:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“And On son of Pelet” (וְאוֹן בֶּן פֶּלֶת) (Numbers 16:1) – why was his name On? It is because all his days were spent in acute mourning (<em>aninut</em>). *He regretted his association with Koraḥ and the rest. “Son of Pelet” – a son for whom wonders (<em>pelaot</em>) were performed. Rav said: On ben Pelet, his wife saved him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the midrash says, both On and Peles were applied to him only after the whole Korach story. Which means he was afraid to connect his name to the rest of Ruvenites, even his father, because of his participation with the congregation of Korach.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rebbe teaches that Eretz Yisroel was given to the Jewish People solely in order that they should learn Torah, do mitzvos, and raise ehrliche Yiddishe generations there, bringing glory and honor to the holy Name of Hashem and spreading knowledge of the truth of Hashem throughout the world. When we fail in this endeavor, drifting from this ideal state of existence in Eretz Yisroel, we cause, chas v'shalom, a desecration of Hashem's holy Name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>This might be the real question, since (1) is more of a \"helping hand\". Are there other sources that convey the same, or almost same view of the Satmar Rav, e.g. that \"<strong>Eretz Yisroel was given to the Jewish People solely in order that they should learn Torah, do mitzvos, and raise ehrliche Yiddishe generations there, bringing glory and honor to the holy Name of Hashem and spreading knowledge of the truth of Hashem throughout the world.</strong>\"</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li>My Hebrew is not that good at this point, it is getting beter, so    I am not able to locate the exact location of this explanation from    the Satmar Rav.

What do they do there?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the fact that the question is in a case where there is no contract, I am assuming that this includes that there is no overriding minhag ha’ir that can determine what the default intention is.</p>\n<p>Such a scenario is logically similar to a case in which the renter and the landlord didn’t discuss if the rent is yearly or monthly, and then the year was turned into a leap year (back when it wasn’t based on a pre calculated calendar). This case is the same thing, since in essence the only difference is whether or not the renter has to pay for the extra Hebrew month. (Although perhaps there is room to debate this logic, the reasoning behind the Halacha would seemingly apply in both cases regardless).</p>\n<p>The Halacha in that case is that the house is in the chazaka of the landlord, and the renter needs to prove that he has a right to the extra month. The Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Hiring.7.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sechirus 7:2</a> says;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הֲרֵי חֹדֶשׁ הָעִבּוּר שֶׁל מַשְׂכִּיר שֶׁהַקַּרְקַע בְּחֶזְקַת בְּעָלִים וְאֵין מוֹצִיאִין דָּבָר מִיַּד בַּעַל הַקַּרְקַע אֶלָּא בִּרְאָיָה בְּרוּרָה. וְכֵן בַּעַל הַבַּיִת שֶׁאָמַר לִזְמַן זֶה הִשְׂכַּרְתִּי לְךָ וְהַשּׂוֹכֵר אוֹמֵר לֹא שָׂכַרְתִּי אֶלָּא סְתָם אוֹ לִזְמַן אָרֹךְ עַל הַשּׂוֹכֵר לְהָבִיא רְאָיָה וְאִם לֹא הֵבִיא בַּעַל הַבַּיִת נִשְׁבָּע הֶסֵּת וּמוֹצִיאוֹ מִן הַבַּיִת:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this case it would seem that the same Halacha would apply, the landlord is assumed to be the muchzak on the extra month and the renter would be the one that has to prove otherwise. (Perhaps, if he always paid on the first of the secular month that can prove that the agreement was secular months, but if the landlord complained right away to use the Hebrew months then seemingly he’s in the right)</p>\n\n\n",

He doesn't ask for mercy. But <strong>Abraham</strong>, when the Holy Blessed One told him, \"This outrage of Sodom and Gamorrah is just too great ... I will go down and see\" etc. -- immmediately it's written, \"And <strong>Abraham</strong> approached and said, Really wouldst Thou destroy the righteous with the wicked?!\"</p>\n<pre><code>\"ויגש אברהם ויאמר האף תספה צדיק עם רשע\" -- אמר רבי יהודה, מאן חמא אבא דרחמנותא כאברהם, תא חזי בנח כתיב (בראשית ו יג) ויאמר אלהי\"ם לנח קץ כל בשר בא לפני וגו', עשה לך תיבת עצי גפר, ואשתיק ולא אמר ליה מידי, ולא בעא רחמי, אבל אברהם בשעתא דאמר ליה קב\"ה זעקת סדום ועמורה כי רבה וגו', ארדה נא ואראה וגו', מיד כתיב ויגש אברהם ויאמר האף תספה צדיק עם רשע.\n</code></pre>\n<p>Rabbi Elazar said, Even <strong>Abraham</strong> didn't do perfectly like he could and ought have. Noah did not one more thing neither [pleading] nor any [action]. Abraham requested proper justice like it ought to be, that the innocent not die with the wicked, starting with 50 and stopping after 10, stopping there and completing no more, for he's not asking mercy either way, because <strong>Abraham</strong> said, I do not want to demand reward for my actions) [perhaps this means to say that above 50 would not need his request, whereas below 10 would be already beyond justice proper, more than he is asking].\nBut who did do perfectly right? That's <strong>Moses</strong>! For as soon as the Holy Blessed One said (Ex. 32:8), \"They have turned quickly from the way ... they have made them a molten Calf and prostrated before it\" -- immediately what is written? -- And <strong>Moses</strong> totally besought the Face of the LORD His God\" etc. -- to the extent that he says, \"Now swear Thou willst forgive their deviousness - and if not then so I swear - wipe me out from Thy book that Thou hast written!\" And even though every single one of them was deviant, he did not more from there until He told him, \"I have forgiven per how thou hast spoken.\"\nBut <strong>Abraham</strong> paid no mind except if there be righteous people there, otherwise not at all. So for this reason there has never in the world been a mortal that defended his generation like <strong>Moses</strong>, who is the Raaya Meheimna, Faithful Shepherd!</p>\n<pre><code>אמר רבי אלעזר, אוף אברהם לא עבד שלימו כדקא יאות, נח לא עביד מידי לא האי ולא האי, אברהם תבע דינא כדקא יאות, דלא ימות זכאה עם חייבא, ושארי מחמשים עד עשרה, עבד ולא אשלים, דלא בעא רחמי בין כך ובין כך, דאמר אברהם לא בעינא למתבע אגר עובדי, אבל מאן עבד שלימו כדקא יאות, דא משה, דכיון דאמר קב\"ה (שמות לב ח) סרו מהר מן הדרך וגו', עשו להם עגל מסכה וישתחוו לו, מיד מה כתיב ויחל משה את פני יהו\"ה אלקיו וגו', עד דאמר ועתה אם תשא חטאתם, ואם אין מחני נא מספרך אשר כתבת, ואע\"ג דכלהו חטו, לא זז מתמן עד דאמר ליה סלחתי כדברך, אבל אברהם לא אשגח אלא אי אשתכח בהו זכאי, ואם לאו לא, ועל דא לא הוה בעלמא בר נש דיגין על דריה כמשה, דאיהו רעיא מהימנא.\n</code></pre>\n<hr />\n<p>Z.

Now <strong>Abraham</strong> thought there were 10 in the city, with Lot and his wife, sons and daughters and sons-in-law.

It is often explained that Hashem \"gets nothing out of creation\", it's purely for mankind, I'd bring a source but no need, just look up any answer to any question on this site regarding the purpose of creation and someone will be bringing such an opinion almost guaranteed.</p>\n<p>Rambam states in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.13?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim 3:13</a> that Hashem didn't create the universe to benefit man, but rather each person's existence <em>in and of itself</em> is Hashem's Ratzon (will), which He identifies as Hashem Himself:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בקשת התכלית לכל זה המציאות. וכן יחשבו שתכלית המציאות כולו – מציאות מין\nהאדם לבד לעבוד את האלוה ושכל מה שנעשה אמנם נעשה בגללו, עד שהגלגלים\nאינם סובבים רק לתועלותיו ולהמציא צרכיו</p>\n<p>Some hold that the inquiry after the purpose of the Creation is\nnecessary, and assume that the Universe was only created for the sake\nof man’s existence, that he might serve God.

We meet also with this\nview in Scripture “The Lord hath made everything (la-ma‘anehu) for its\npurpose (Prov. 16:4).

We have also pointed out that His\nessence is also called His glory. The words, “The Lord hath made\neverything for Himself, “express therefore the same idea as the\nfollowing verse, “Everything that is called by my name: I have created\nit for my glory, I have formed it; yea, I have made it” (Isa. 43:7);\n<strong>that is to say, everything that is described as My work has been made\nby Me for the sake of My will and for no other purpose.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[sorry for the long quote, and it's still not enough, please go learn the whole of 12 and 13]</p>\n<p>This sounds like a contradiction.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe seems to resolve this in B'Sha'a She'Hikdimu 5712, by stating that the idiom \"The mitzvot were only given to refine mankind\" means that Hashem needs mankind to be refined, and this is His inner will, and applies to Him, Himself, before creation, in Essence. So, Hashem created the world to <em>fulfil His own Ratzon</em> of improving mankind (with the inner <em>inner</em> Ratzon that He should have a dwelling place with Nishmat Yisrael).

    "content": "# Difference between a Menahel and Rosh Yeshivah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is there a difference between a Menahel and a Rosh Yeshivah, or are they synonymous?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>מנהל means \"leader\". When used with the definite article, the noun is likely referring to the highest director of the organisation in question. In the case of a yeshiva, that would usually be the Rosh Yeshiva, but doesn't have to be.</p>\n<p>From the root נהל, see the BDB entry <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/BDB%2C_%D7%A0%D6%B8%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%9C?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Depends on the institution. In some, there is one rabbi who is both setting spiritual leadership (rosh yeshiva), and responsible for the mundane running of the institution (menahel), possibly including fundraising. The Netziv served both roles in the Volozhin yeshiva. Think of menahel as a school principal, or company's chief operating officer. Rosh yeshiva is more like a CEO.</p>\n<p>In many yeshivas today, the roles are split. (Rabbi Rakeffet has noted, in retrospect, that Volozhin should have split the roles in the next generation, with R' Chaim Brisker as <em>rosh yeshiva</em> and R' Chaim Berlin as <em>menahel.</em>)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the colloquial ways they are used they aren't synonymous at all. Menahal  basically just means a school principal. Even an elementary school has a menehal. But an elementary school without higher grades would never have a Rosh Yeshiva. In elementary  school he frequently also owns the school but rarely teaches a class.</p>\n<p>On the mesivta or Beis Medrash level he more frequently  teaches  a class as well. On the Beis Medrash level  the menehal  is always  just an employee because if he owned the school he would be called Rosh Yeshiva. Even if someone else is teaching the highest level and more respected and  also referred to as Rosh Yeshiva. (In such a case there could also be a subtle distinction between being called Rosh Yeshiva or Rosh HaYeshiva)</p>\n<p>In  a Mesivta without a Beis Medrash where  the owner of the school has some level of direct non administrative involvement with the school he would be either   be called  Menehal or Rosh Yeshiva. Usually he would only be called  Rosh Yeshiva  if  someone else is active as principal/menehal.Then he would e called Rosh Yeshiva to distinguish himself from the menehal.  Otherwise a mesivta would not have a Rosh Yeshiva.</p>\n<p>Beis Medrash always has a Rosh Yeshiva. While it possible that the Rosh Yeshiva on a Beis medrash level is also just an employee his main position is giving the highest level shiur and setting the tone in the Yeshiva. He isn't the principal. If he does not own the yeshiva where he is Rosh Yeshiva then he would not be making principal like decisions such as hiring staff,  school schedule  or discipline .</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Reasons behind Prohibition on Mystical Speculation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Mishnah Chagiga provides limitations on mystical inquiry, e.g., that the merkabah literature should not be attempted alone or by an unwise student. The tale of the four sages who glimpsed paradise, and especially Ahar, in Chagiga 14b-15b supplements this view.</p>\n<p>But the reasoning here is obscure to me. As I read the story of Ahar (and Rubenstein's <em>Talmudic Stories</em> seems to agree), mystical speculation can lead to theological error, which leads to practical vice. In Ahar's case, this is apparently due to a fatalism born out of mystical speculation.</p>\n<p>On the one hand, I understand how fatalism or a feeling of futility could lead to vice. So if mystical speculation inevitably leads to fatalism, then I can grok this passage. But on the other hand, I simply don't see why mystical inquiry is supposed to lead to this kind of anti-social fatalism. In the story, Ahar receives a very direct message that he has no share in ha-olam ha-ba'ah. I understand why he in particular feels like he might as well as sin.</p>\n<p>But there's nothing to explain why the average person, who will not learn their fate in the world-to-come, should stay away from mystical speculation that exceeds their ability.</p>\n\n\n",

In my experience, basically all talleisim (Sefardic or not) have them on the side. As for tallis kattan, these knots are basically only made on woolen garments.</p>\n\n\n",

The mesorah for doing so stretches back to the Geonic academies in Babylon which are the direct inheritors of the Talmudic academies. See R. Sherira Gaon and R. Hai Gaon (as cited in Sefer ha-Eshkol, H. Sefer Torah 60a), R. Shemuel b. Hofni Gaon (in his intro to the Talmud, usually printed in the back of BT Berakhoth). The Rambam simply perpetuates this Geonic tradition. The debate over which aspects of the Torah and writings of Hazal should be taken literally, clearly has ancient roots.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the answer to the above question is yes, then would the fact that he’s the most cited person in the shulchan orech cause us to reconsider all of modern day halacha??

Rabbinic Judaism UNIVERSALLY upholds the Rambam as a respected authority on Jewish law.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the above answer is no, would accusing him of being one cause the accuser to have a status of an apikores?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One who disgraces/disparages a Talmid Hakham is to be placed in niddui (ostracization) and has no portion in 'Olam ha-Ba (see H. Talmud Torah 6:11-12 and H. Teshubhah 3:11). Furthermore, if he is spreading his malicious lies and causing others to follow his inequity, this may constitute a violation of the prohibition of enticing others to sin (מחטיא את הרבים), which similarly has the consequence of losing a share in 'Olam ha-Ba (see H. Teshubha 3:10). This latter category is one from which teshubhah is withheld (see H. Teshubha 4:1). Anyone treading upon such a path is highly cautioned against.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the answer is unknown, what would that mean for us in terms of following a possible heretic?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The answer is known.

However, the language they are using is as follows in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.116a.15?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Bava Basra 116a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara presents the third homiletic interpretation: Rabbi Pineḥas bar Ḥama interpreted a verse homiletically: Anyone who has a sick person in his home should go to a sage, and the sage will ask for mercy on the sick person’s behalf, as it is stated: “The wrath of a king is as messengers of death; but a wise man will pacify it” (Proverbs 16:14)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, they are using the word sage. However, as far as I'm aware, a sage and a tzaddik are not necessarily identical in meaning. By \"tzaddik\" I mean a deeply righteous and \"saintly\" person whose mere presence causes others to become more spiritually developed and enlightened and causes them to attach themselves to the person. Therefore, this made me wonder a) what is the earliest use of the term tzaddik, both in meaning and in literal form/word b) How long back does the concept of a tzaddik go, even if it wasn't termed a tzaddik necessarily?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The earliest reference is in the Torah regarding Noach (Bereishit 6:9):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵ֚לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֣ת נֹ֔חַ נֹ֗חַ אִ֥ישׁ צַדִּ֛יק תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּדֹֽרֹתָ֑יו אֶת־הָֽאֱלֹהִ֖ים הִֽתְהַלֶּךְ־נֹֽחַ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the generations of Noah.

He also discusses what \"in his generation\" means, which can be understood positively or negatively. Either way, Hashem 'walked' with Noah.</p>\n<p>The next reference to tzaddikim is regarding Avraham entreating Hashem not to destroy Sdom (Bereishit 18:23). The argument Avraham provided was that it would not be just to destroy tzaddikim and resha'im together. Whatever these 'tzaddikim' were, as defined by Avraham, he saw that in their merit no one should be destroyed in Sdom. From this we could learn that the actions of tzaddikim (even a few) outweigh the iniquity of resha'im. To this extent, the whole of Sdom could have been saved (or would have merited being saved) on account of the actions of the tzaddikim.</p>\n\n\n",

(And as it can be \"cash or cash-value\", you could do that math and then give the kohen just about any item with that value.)</p>\n<p>As DoubleAA noted, some opinions have it as a little more than that, maybe more like two-thirds of a troy ounce.</p>\n<p>Some folks do go to a coin shop and find older US currency that actually contains silver; you'd just have to do the math on its total weight of pure silver. (Back in the day -- and I think this is in Rabbi Bulka's RCA Madrich -- the typical US silver dollar didn't quite have half a troy ounce of silver, so it wound up being more like seven silver dollars.)</p>\n<p>As I recall, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_Liberty_half_dollar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Walking Liberty Silver Half Dollar</a> is easy to find at coin stores, and contains 0.36 troy ounces of silver.

The Satmar Rav quotes the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.21a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra (21a)</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קִנְאַת סוֹפְרִים תַּרְבֶּה חָכְמָה - jealousy among teachers\nincreases wisdom</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Satmar Rav uses this idea and explains that the admiration of the people for Pinchas and the way he acted, caused them to regret their actions and this brought forth a strong feeling of remorse which started the teshuva-process.

Thus, from this we can see that it was Pinchas' action that \"awakened\" the hearts of the Jewish people so to speak.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Klein writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He lightly urges his guests, \"Please take some water\", because he thought they were idol worshippers and wanted to purify them from avodah zara. The yetzer hara is referred to as \"לב האבן\" - \"stoney heart\", Avraham sought to soften them to remove the yetzer hara.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in the case of Miriam she turned the outside of the rock into a spring.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She had the חשק/desire to come forward at Yam Suf and she never abandoned hope. She stood by the Nile watching her baby brother float to a safer place because she anticipated that he would become the saviour of Bnei Yisrael. Miriam had an immense השתוקקות, ready to spring outward and gush forth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore when Miriam dies the be'er dries up. However, the outside remained soft (thanks to Avraham) but was missing the internal water source that came via Miriam.</p>\n\n\n",

This is one of the reasons why reward and punishment are not mentioned and the focus of the paragraph is on loving G-d and expressing that love, which is the major motivation for the actions of a <em>tzaddik</em>. Such people exist in a place which is protected from the evil inclination (e.g., in <em>Tanya</em>, a <em>tzaddik</em> does not even have one) and so the allusion to this spells <em>mezuza</em> without a <em>vav</em>, making an allusion in that the word <em>mezuzos</em> now has letters from <em>zaz maves</em> (the 2nd idea above).</p>\n<p>However, for a regular person, who is very much from the second paragraph of the <em>Shema</em>, the word <em>mezuzos</em> is spelled out in full to allude to the singular <em>mezuzah</em> which when spelled full is <em>gimatria</em> 65 (like the name אדנ-י), alluding to the Divine Presence being in the life of every Jew.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did only Pinchas (know how to) respond?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah relates the story of Pinchas, who, after seeing Zimri committing an act of immorality, in front of the leaders of B'nei Yisrael, took initiative and took action. The Torah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And, behold, one of the children of Yisrael came and brought to his\nbrethren a Midyanite woman in the sight of Moshe, and in the sight of\nall the congregation of the children of Yisrael, who were weeping\nbefore the door of the Tent of Meeting. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.25.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bamidbar 25:6)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash Rabbah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.20.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bamidbar Rabbah 20:25)</a> says that the leaders of the generation, after seeing this act of immorality took place before their eyes and the eyes of the whole community, were not able to come up with an immediate response to that situation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is simply that, while they were involved in give and take on the matter of whether or not [the culprit] was liable for death, that man (Phinehas) stood up from the midst of the congregation and volunteered [to carry out the sentence].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.25.7?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.25.7.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that Pinchas on the other hand, was reminded of the halacha dealing with all of this.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He saw what was being done and he was thereby reminded of the law on this subject (Sanhedrin 82a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What whas Pinchas reminded of? Well, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.82a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82a</a> relates the conversation between Pinchas and Moshe Rabbeinu. Pinchas says that Moshe told him, during his descent from Har Sinai, that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who engages in intercourse with a gentile woman, zealots strike him?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is as follows: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/129635/27180\">the elders had ruach hakodesh</a>, and surely, the leaders of the generation were of great statue. How could they not know how to respond? Didn't Moshe Rabbeinu teach them the same halachos he related to Pinchas (as told in the Gemara in Sanhedrin 82a)? Also, Moshe Rabbeinu, as per the Gemara mentioned above, knew the halachos concerning this matter. Why then, does the Midrash says they did not know how to respond? And how does it come that no one, even Moshe and Aharon, did not respond to this matter?</p>\n<p>Are there some great sources/ pearls on this that discuss this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Midrash says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Cozbi came along, [Zimri] desired her, but she said to him:\n“I will not yield to you, because my father told me that I must yield only to Moses.”  To which he replied: “I am greater than Moses, for he belongs to the third tribe, whereas I belong to the second. Shall I show you that I am greater than Moses? Well, in front of him will I take you,” ... so impudent was he towards him.\nHe said to Moses: “Is she forbidden or permitted?”\nTo which Moses replied: “She is forbidden to you.”\nZimri then retorted: “Are you the most faithful follower of the Torah, on whom God prides himself saying, ‘My servant Moses ... is trusted in all My house’”? You tell me that she is forbidden?  Well, the wife that you have taken is also forbidden to you, for both are Midianite women; and whereas this one is the greatest of her family, your wife is the daughter of a heathen priest.” [Exodus Rabbah 33:5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg comments:  A zealot must have pure motivations. This is why Moses did not kill Zimri himself:  His wife, Tzipporah, was also a Midianite. Of course, Moses' case was different, because he married before the Torah was given. Nevertheless, in his humility, Moses feared that if he killed Zimri, he might derive satisfaction from taking revenge on the person who insulted him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Sefas Emes on this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Numbers%2C_Pinchas.8.2?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">passuk year 5640</a> explains that it was designed to allow Pinchas to rise up and receive the reward of becoming a kohen</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שמרע\"ה לא הרג את זמרי רק פינחס לא הי' פחיתות למרע\"ה רק שבא פינחס ונטל את שלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He further explains that the idea of a kanai is best suited for the generation after Moshe, to take what they learned and apply it not necessarily exactly as it is written but modified based on the situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The simple answer as to why Moshe did not intervene according to the Midrash is because Hashem caused Moshe to forget.</p>\n<p>It writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.96.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 96:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כְּשֶׁעָשָׂה זִמְרִי אוֹתוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה מַה כְּתִיב שָׁם (במדבר כה, ח): וַיָּבֹא אַחַר אִישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל אֶל הַקֻּבָּה, וְהֵיכָן הָיָה משֶׁה, וּפִינְחָס מְדַבֵּר לִפְנֵי משֶׁה, אֶלָּא לְקַיֵּם וְאֵין שִׁלְטוֹן בְּיוֹם הַמָּוֶת, וְאֵין מָוֶת אֶלָּא לָשׁוֹן הַשְׁפָּלָה, נִתְּנָה הַיְשׁוּעָה לְפִינְחָס וְהִשְׁפִּיל אֶת משֶׁה</p>\n<p>When Zimri performed the act, what does it write there?

Because there is no sovereignty over the day of death and there is no death but humiliation as all the people died, that is, they lost their property like it says previously chapt. 71.

The crosses tattooed on their hands and foreheads remained a vivid symbol for me, shattering long-standing perceptions of Jewish identity” (1999, pg. 3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The origin of the practice of tattooing is questionable i.e., whether it was for medicinal purposes, or omens, etc. Furthermore, the author suggests that tattoos of crosses may have been to disguise Jews within a hostile (Christian) environment.</p>\n<p>I am interested in the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do any scholars or halachic authorities provide suggestions as to whether, or how, this practice is permissible or justified lechatchila? For example: would it be permissible for beauty/decoration but not for warding off demons. In particular, although there is an element of mystery surrounding the origin, I wonder if the isolated Jewish communities of Ethiopia integrated this as a legitimate cultural/Jewish practice and were able to justify it (I cannot find this information). Noting that many Western Jews nowadays would find it 'halachically unrecognisable' and 'unjustified'.</li>\n<li>I imagine there is a problem with specifically having a tattoo that has a cross on it. If so, what should one do? (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27535/would-a-convert-baal-teshuvah-have-to-remove-any-tattoos-they-may-have\">this</a> is a relevant question for tattoo removal)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Shalom\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Sharon Shalom</a>, a rabbi of Ethiopian extraction, has written a book titled מסיני לאתיופיה - עולמה ההלכתי והרעיוני של יהדות אתיופיה (the title of the English translation is From Sinai to Ethiopia: Shulhan ha-Orit; the Halakhah of Ethiopian Jewry, Then and Now). The book explores many halakhic topics and presents the Ethiopian tradition, the rabbinic-halakhic tradition in contrast, and what the present \"recommended\" practice for Ethiopians is in light of all of that.</p>\n<p>The section titled יסודות הבית היהודי (Foundations of the Jewish home) has a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/From_Sinai_to_Ethiopia%2C_Shulhan_haOrit%3B_The_Halakhah_of_Ethiopian_Jewry%2C_Then_and_Now%2C_6_Foundations_of_the_Jewish_Home.9?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chapter on tattoos</a>. In this chapter R. Shalom discusses the fact that in Ethiopia the Kessim tried to discourage the getting of tattoos. He notes that it was more often practiced among women, who may have believed that the prohibition applied only to men. He also notes that the tattoos were less often found among the earliest waves of Ethiopian Jews who he presumes had less exposure to the Christian world.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do any scholars or halachic authorities provide suggestions as to whether, or how, this practice is permissible or justified lechatchila?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted above, it seems that technically even their own tradition did not endorse this practice and that it did not conform to the instructions of the Kessim. He also seems to suggest that this was a much later phenomenon and thus is not necessarily indicative of an indigenous traditional practice but is rather a symptom of assimilation to the larger Christian Ethiopian culture.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I imagine there is a problem with specifically having a tattoo that has a cross on it. If so, what should one do? (this is a relevant question for tattoo removal)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Shalom notes that the women bearing tattoos of crosses (often smack dab in the middle of their forehead) are now ashamed of it in Israel and he discusses the possibility of/debate concerning marring the original tattoo with additional tattooing as a function of כבוד הבריות (the halakhic consideration of respect for human dignity). He also notes that today due to the philanthropic efforts of others, such women can readily avail themselves of laser removal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hard to prove a negative, but</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I have just been through <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.180\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 180</a>, which is the most likely place in SA to deal with this. I have learned it with a few commentaries and other related works including Mishneh Torah, and didn't see any hints of any opinion that say there is a <em>lechatchila</em> way to get a tattoo. At best, there may be some opinions that provide fairly straight forward ways to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.180.2?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">get a tattoo in a way that one is <em>patur</em></a>*, which may have been utilised in order to avert a <em>sakana</em> perhaps? This is pure speculation.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Also with regards to this topic, I didn't come across any trails that brought the <em>halachot</em> into the conversation of <em>avodah zora</em> or non-Jewish religious symbols.

And behold, Korah and his congregation believed that there is a God in Israel, and that the God who is called the Lord swore to their fathers to inherit the land, and that He performs signs and wonders for them. However, they believed that God, through special deeds, establishes a covenant with His priests and wise men who know His ways of worship, and He fulfills their desires. They believed that Moses performed mighty acts through the power of God, but they also believed that God can be persuaded and listens to Moses when he performs the desired deeds before Him. Therefore, now that the Tabernacle has been established and the laws of sacrifices and the desired ways of worship before God have been revealed, anyone can be a priest and a prophet apart from Aaron and Moses. And behold, Korah was elevating himself, saying, 'I will be a priest and a prophet, and God will answer me with miracles and wonders, just as He answered Moses and Aaron, after I perform His service as commanded by Him. Why should I not be seen with the same greatness as Moses and Aaron? Why should my brother and I be excluded from carrying the sacred vessels?' Moses perceived his intention and said to them, 'Take fire pans and see if the incense offering is accepted by God on its own merits, regardless of who offers it. Whether it is the chosen and beloved individual or any other person, the one who offers it will be the accepted one if it is God's will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So he thought that indeed it was Hashem's will, but that anyone with the good actions could become prophet and/or kohen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Korach's main objection was the nepotism he saw and how strange it is that the holiest people all happen to be the relatives of Moshe. The only prophetess we hear of in the Torah is Miriam. And Aaron, despite being the hands that ultimately made the calf and who seemingly is pardoned while  3,000 other men were put to death by the sword. And as if that wasn't enough, Korach and his members witnessed Aaron's sons die and be consumed by God for offering a strange fire. Korach was implying that Moses and Aaron had taken too much and might not be fit for the job. They had a legitimate question: compared to this idol making High Priest and his two sons who couldn't even handle being priests, couldn't we do a better job?</p>\n<p>But Korach knew why Moses was the leader. Moses was the leader because he did the work, he followed through on everything that he said he would do. And Moses was the teacher of a law that Korach was accepting.

I've been religiously observant (Orthodox) my entire life, and I have a yearning for some kind of profound mystical experience or connection with G-d (not sure how else to describe it). I sometimes find myself envying the generation that had the privilege to experience Matan Torah or other open miracles firsthand. All of the conventional avenues (mitzvos, Torah, davening, etc.) are great but they've never given me the profound spiritual revelation I wish I could experience. I wish I could experience Olam HaBa or Hashem speaking with me (even though I know it would probably be so overwhelming that my brain couldn't handle it). Does anyone else here feel that way?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Here are a few thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Learning Torah deeply, teaches one to switch from seeing nature as natural, to seeing it as miraculous, e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.25a.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the story of R' Chanina Ben Dosa and the vinegar</a>. Once one sees it as miraculous, you've achieved your goal. For example, if you see the feeling of love as just a physical manifestation of hormones affecting a nervous system, it will never be a spiritual experience, but once you start to learn how love has no place in a physical world, and comes from much higher, then every time you feel love, you have a mystical spiritual experience, and not even the lofty things, like love, but even the basic physical world of nature will do this. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3432275/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is an interesting article on this idea</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We are all numb nowadays, for various reasons including <em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.112b.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">yeridat hadorot</a></em> and others*. Part of the reason we might feel that life is devoid of spirituality is because of how numb we are. If we can only recall from our childhoods the true experience of intellectual excitement, the true feeling of deep emotion - and all the other amazing qualities of being a human being with a neshama in their proper expression - I doubt many of us would be struggling with this common question. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/135675/31534\">this answer</a> for discussing walls around the heart.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As you've brought in your question, engaging in Torah, mitzvot and davening isn't working for you, as it isn't for many people. I would venture that for a lot of people, this is because they don't see Hashem as real, and this is one of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/6237/jewish/Lessons-in-Tanya.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya</a>'s approaches in answering this common question. He is somehow abstract, distant and disconnected and therefore doing mitzvot becomes an abstract disconnected venture. Once He becomes real, and one realises that they are His mitzvot, and He needs us to do them, and the Torah is Him telling us about Himself. I.e. once He becomes an actual real <em>someone</em> to us, and we come to appreciate how we are His and He is ours, then every letter of Torah, and every detail of halacha becomes a true service of Him, and a profound spiritual experience.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of the above I think would be useful for a lot of people, and certainly within reach of everyone. Higher things like ruach hakodesh and prophecy, the more commonly understood notions of \"spiritual experiences\" are likely out of reach for us until Moshiach comes... However, I think by yearning to connect to Hashem, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">you are doing alright</a>, and I am highly optimistic that with this amount of yearning, and heartfelt davening, Hashem will bless you with success in this!</p>\n<p>Until then, we should also be aware of a fair point, which is that we are here for one reason only: to do a mission. Having a spiritual experience isn't necessarily part of that mission for each person, in the sense that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">we aren't doing it for the reward</a>, and the principle reward is not in this world, as we say every shabbat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְדַע, מַתַּן שְׂכָרָם שֶׁל צַדִּיקִים לֶעָתִיד לָבֹא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope that helps.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* See also Ma'amar Hageula 1:4, even fruit is lacking in taste; Sota 48a; and further explanation Da'at Tevunot 40 p. 30; and another angle in Mesilat Yisharim 11 והוא מה שאמרו בש\"ס גם כן (יומא לט): ונטמאתם בם, אל תיקרי ונטמאתם, אלא ונטמתם. שהעבירה מטמטמת לבו של אדם, כי מסלקת ממנו הדיעה האמיתית ורוח השכל שהקדוש ברוך הוא נותן לחסידים, כמו שאמר הכתוב (משלי ב): כי ה' יתן חכמה, והנה הוא נשאר בהמיי וחומרי משוקע בגסות העולם הזה.</p>\n</sup>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to Pinchas Ben Yair, in the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.20b.10?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 20B</a> and other places), if one wants spiritual revelations they must work on themselves until, after a many step process, they are refined enough for G-dly revelation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכאן א\"ר פנחס בן יאיר תורה מביאה לידי זהירות זהירות מביאה לידי זריזות זריזות מביאה לידי נקיות נקיות מביאה לידי פרישות פרישות מביאה לידי טהרה טהרה מביאה לידי חסידות חסידות מביאה לידי ענוה ענוה מביאה לידי יראת חטא יראת חטא מביאה לידי קדושה קדושה מביאה לידי רוח הקודש רוח הקודש מביאה לידי תחיית המתים וחסידות גדולה מכולן שנאמר (תהלים פט, כ) אז דברת בחזון לחסידיך</p>\n<p>From here Rabbi Pineḥas ben Ya’ir would say: Torah study leads to care in the performance of mitzvot. Care in the performance of mitzvot leads to diligence in their observance. Diligence leads to cleanliness of the soul. Cleanliness of the soul leads to abstention from all evil. Abstention from evil leads to purity and the elimination of all base desires. Purity leads to piety. Piety leads to humility. Humility leads to fear of sin. Fear of sin leads to holiness.

To be honest, He does. Refer to my comment regarding Shmuel HaNavi and Eli. Shmuel did think that Eli was calling him, but in truth, it was G-d who was calling Shmuel. He did not know that yet.

    "title": "Metaphors and truth in Torah",
    "content": "# Metaphors and truth in Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Rambam, certain parts of the Torah are to be understood metaphorically. While this approach works well in cases where we can imagine that the \"first listeners\" understood it as metaphors (e.g., \"the hand of God,\" dry bones...), isn't it more complicated to comprehend in cases where the listeners took it literally (e.g., the description of creation)? Isn't it strange to say that the Torah expresses itself not through \"metaphors\" but through \"myths\"? I.e. mashals that don't have a nimshal.</p>\n<p>Indeed, as I understand that the torah uses methaphors, I find it hard vis a vis \"trust\" that Hashem would teach us myths, that is, things that us listener would believe as true, but is in fact false (even if the \"moral meaning\" is of course important and true).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Rambam doesn't say that the Torah contains metaphors and myths. I do think he says two related things:</p>\n<p>1- Parts of the Torah happen, but in a non-physical way. The Abravanel shows that to the Rambam, nevu'ah is an experience of non-physical realities. (Which the Abravanel contrast's to the Ramban's understanding of nevu'ah as the reception of a message from Hashem.) And so, it isn't that the story of the three mal'akhim visiting Avraham was a parable, or that Bil'am's speaking donkey was a parable, or even the Man on the Throne seen by Moshe, Aharon and the Elders was a parable. Rather, these were real experiences that they had of real events. Which, due to human physicality, their minds experienced via familiar visions and sounds.</p>\n<p>Or the Six Days of Creation, which he says was a real event, if not in \"days\" as we generally use the word -- since time itself was created, but in 6 logical steps, each the cause of the next one.</p>\n<p>But that isn't a parable. It's the use of words to describe something we don't have sufficient language for.</p>\n<p>I think the first listeners understood as much. Especially the actual Sinai generation who were overwhelmed by prophecy once. But they established a culture that knew that words fall short of describing the prophetic experience, or other things that are beyond comprehension.</p>\n<p>2- The other oft-quoted idea of the Rambam in thie context is his reuse of R Yishma'el's expression \"dibera Torah belashon benei adam -- the Torah speaks in human language\". (To R Yishmael, this is an argument against R Aqiva's darshaning necessary words like \"akh\", \"raq\", or \"es\", or normal Hebrew grammar which creates doubling like \"aseir ta'aseir.)</p>\n<p>The Rambam reuses this idiom to mean just that -- the Torah can speak idiomatically. Just as you wouldn't think that someone who had a \"spare tire\" actually grew part of a car wheel on their body. And Neil DeGrasse Tyson will talk about \"sunrise\" even though he knows it's caused by the earth spinning, and not the sun rising over the earth. So too, don't take the Torah's describing Hashem as \"flaring His nostrils\" in anger as implying He has nostrils.</p>\n<p>Or that the use of \"yad - hand\" to mean \"might\" or \"under his control\" to mean that Hashem has a hand. And this \"belashon benei adam\" really is about the first listeners. \"Yad haChazaqah\" was used because the people who got the Torah normally used the word \"yad\" to mean \"might\", and not always a literal hand.</p>\n<p>Here it's even clearer -- the first generations were using these idioms themselves! The idea didn't fly over their heads any more than my saying \"fly over their heads\" just now made you think I meant ideas sailing through the air at a higher altitude than the people in questions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is no difficulty here at all. Maimonides felt that God is not anthropomorphic or anthropopathic. Regarding the description of creation. This, too, is a metaphor. The Jews did not believe the first chapters of Genesis to be fact. Maimonides explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We ought not to understand, nor take according to the letter, that\nwhich is written in the book of the creation, nor to have the same\nideas of it which common men have; otherwise our ancient sages would\nnot have recommended with so much care to conceal the sense of it, and\nnot to raise the allegorical veil which envelopes the truths it\ncontains. The book of Genesis, taken according to the letter, gives\nthe most absurd and the most extravagant ideas of the divinity.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here he declares that the account of the Creation in the book of Genesis is not a fact, and that to believe it to be a fact, especially with respect to the work of four days, gives the most absurd and the most extravagant ideas of God. Maimonides felt that the book of Genesis is not a book of facts. It is an allegory. It shouldn’t be taken literally. It is only a parable.</p>\n<p>Regarding the myths. I think you are asking about the first parts of Genesis which appear to be similar to myths. Noah's flood (for example) seems to be drawing from the tale of Gilgamesh. The early chapters of Genesis have many surreal elements (like talking snake, a garden of eden, two creation accounts, etc.) If we understand these stories as myths that serve a purpose, we can add that the Torah's account, unlike pagan mythology, adds a moral twist and changed to reflect monotheistic and teach moral lessons.</p>\n<p>The reader will recollect the quotation I have already made from Maimonides, where he says, “We ought not to understand nor to take according to the letter that which is written in the book of the Creation.\" This implies that there are other parts of the book (the book of Genesis) that ought not to be taken according to the letter, and as the Jews do not adopt the names mentioned in the first parts of Genesis, it is evident that ancient Jews did not believe the first chapters of Genisis to be fact.</p>\n<p>It follows, that the characters mentioned in the first parts of Genesis, such as Adam, Enoch, Methuselah, and Noah, are not real, but allegorical persons, and this is why early Jews did not use the names in the first parts of Genesis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Tatz deals with this in his works. He brings the school of thought in Torah thinking that holds like you; namely that the Torah's standard of truth should not allow for these non-true metaphors. I will be quoting chapter 13 of <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Thinking_Jewish_Teenager_s_Guide_to.html?id=7KFsAAAACAAJ&redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Thinking Jewish Teenager's Guide to Life</a>, and recommend <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Worldmask.html?id=IrP6oBLjhOgC&redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Worldmask</a> for further reading:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we are forbidden to conceive of any physical or material image when\nrelated to Hashem, why does the Torah do so?</p>\n<p>We know that Hashem obeys His own rules, as it were; He observes the\nTorah commandments - why not this one?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then quotes the Rambam's Yesodei Hatorah, where it is explained that the Torah is written in \"the language of men\", and therefore describes Hashem in human terms as a metaphor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Hashem does not have a hand, but since we can only\nunderstand things within our experience, the Torah speaks in terms\nfamiliar to us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Like many of the great gedolim that have dealt with understanding Rambam, he questions this interpretation of Rambam, along similar lines to you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the Rambam means that the Torah is using human terms as <em>mashal</em>,\nanalogy, we are faced with two major difficulties. Firstly, how can\nthe Torah speak in terms which are not strictly true? We know that the\nTorah is true in the very deepest sense possible; every nuance within\nTorah must be true. Since the Torah is none other than Hashem Himself\nspeaking, even the outermost layers of its expression must be\nabsolutely accurate and true <em>[and he goes on to show how an analogy is\nnot true in itself, and then gives the second reason that it is\nforbidden to attribute physical properties to Hashem, so how can the\nTorah]</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first answer he gives is similar to the answers given by Rambam in Moreh Nevuchim, e.g. Hashem's \"hand\" and \"eye\" are referring to Hashem's actions in the world etc. He challenges this from the deeper sources, which would say that this doesn't solve the problem, because it indicates that it is only true in this world, and not intrinsically true.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, if the Torah talks of Hashem's hand, it <em>must</em> mean that\nHe has a hand, intrinsically and most literally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So at this point, he introduces the Kabbalistic answer to this question, based on Shaarei Orah, Shelah  et al. When we call what the Torah says a <em>mashal</em>, we don't mean that His hand is a <em>mashal</em>, and ours is real. The opposite, <em>our hand is the mashal</em> and <em>His</em> is real.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the secret which answers our question is this: <em>Hashem's hand is a\nreal hand and our human hand is a mashal!</em> When the Torah talks of the\nDivine hand it is referring to that which is real in the deepest\nsense; that which is <em>infinite and no contradiction</em> to the absolute\nOneness of the Creator. Every nuance of meaning in Torah is absolutely\ntrue; Hashem indeed has a hand - but that hand transcends human\nunderstanding no less than any other Divine attribute which is\nexpressed in Torah, and no less than what we refer to as Hashem\nHimself.</p>\n<p>Of course this means that we cannot begin to understand any of the\nDivine attributes mentioned in the Torah. Since they all exist in\nthat realm of Oneness which has no parts they do not contradict the\nidea of the Oneness of the Creator. And no human mind can begin to\nimagine the meaning of that which is described as specific or\nparticular yet does not contradict the idea of Oneness...</p>\n<p>...The Torah talks of reality, the highest reality. The Torah\ndescribes things <em>as they actually are;</em> but it uses human language -\nit uses language that refers to things in our world, things with which\nwe are familiar so that we can begin to relate to those things that\nare above our world, those things that are real in the highest sense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Here's an early source for this idea, by Rabbi Yosef Gikatillah in Shaarei Orah (c.1260-1300 CE). In the introduction to this early Kabbalistic sefer, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אם כן כל אותם העניינים שאנו קורים בתורה, כגון יד ורגל, אוזן ועין, ושאר\nכל כיוצא בהם, מה הוא? דע והאמן כי כל אותם העניינים אף על פי שהם מורים\nומעידים על גדולתו ואמיתתו, אין כל בריה יכולה לדעת ולהתבונן מהות אותו\nהדבר הנקרא יד ורגל ואוזן וכיוצא בהם. ואם אנו עשויים בצלם ודמות, אל\nיעלה בדעתך, כי עין בצורת עין ממש, או יד בצורת יד ממש, אבל הוא עניינים\nפנימיים ופנימים לפנימיים באמיתת מציאות י\"י יתברך, אשר מהם המקור והשפע\nיוצא לכל הנמצאים בגזירת השם יתברך. אבל אין מהות יד כמהות יד, ולא\nתבניתם שווה, כמו שאמר ואל מי תדמיוני ואשוה (ישעיה מ, כה).</p>\n<p>So, what is the meaning of all these concepts we learn about in Torah\nregarding [Hashem's] hand, foot, ear or eye? Know and believe that no\ncreated being is able to understand or conceive of the thing called\n\"Hand\", \"Foot\" or \"Ear\" etc, even though they do teach and testify to\nHashem's greatness and truth.

In Exodus it says לֹא תַחְמֹד but in Deuteronomy it adds לֹ֨א תִתְאַוֶּ֜ה. The Rambam qualifies this by saying that one does not transgress לֹא תַחְמֹד until he actually takes the item, either by force or by convincing the person to sell it to him. However, לֹ֨א תִתְאַוֶּ֜ה is transgressed even with thought alone. In either case, one is not liable to a court punishment because it does not count as \"an action\" that is punishable. (The Raavad disagrees and says the reason he is not liable to punishment is because he can return the item, which takes away the laws punishment).</p>\n<p>The Rambam in Gezeila V'aveida 1:9-12</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַחוֹמֵד עַבְדּוֹ אוֹ אֲמָתוֹ אוֹ בֵּיתוֹ וְכֵלָיו שֶׁל חֲבֵרוֹ אוֹ דָּבָר שֶׁאֶפְשָׁר לוֹ שֶׁיִּקְנֵהוּ מִמֶּנּוּ וְהִכְבִּיר עָלָיו בְּרֵעִים וְהִפְצִיר בּוֹ עַד שֶׁלְּקָחוֹ מִמֶּנּוּ אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנָּתַן לוֹ דָּמִים רַבִּים הֲרֵי זֶה עוֹבֵר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות כ יד) (דברים ה יח) \"לֹא תַחְמֹד\". וְאֵין לוֹקִין עַל לָאו זֶה מִפְּנֵי שֶׁאֵין בּוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה. וְאֵינוֹ עוֹבֵר בְּלָאו זֶה עַד שֶׁיִּקַּח הַחֵפֶץ שֶׁחָמַד. כָּעִנְיָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים ז כה) \"לֹא תַחְמֹד כֶּסֶף וְזָהָב עֲלֵיהֶם וְלָקַחְתָּ לָךְ\". חִמּוּד שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ מַעֲשֶׂה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who covets a servant, a maidservant, a house or utensils that belong to a colleague, or any other article that he can purchase from him and pressures him with friends and requests until he agrees to sell it to him, violates a negative commandment,even though he pays much money for it, as Exodus 20:14 states: \"Do not covet.\"\nThe violation of this commandment is not punished by lashes, because it does not involve a deed. One does not violate this commandment until one actually takes the article he covets, as reflected by Deuteronomy 7:25: \"Do not covet the gold and silver on these statues and take it for yourself.\" Implied is that the Hebrew tachmod refers to coveting accompanied by a deed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַמִּתְאַוֶּה בֵּיתוֹ אוֹ אִשְׁתּוֹ וְכֵלָיו שֶׁל חֲבֵרוֹ. וְכֵן כָּל כַּיּוֹצֵא בָּהֶן מִשְּׁאָר דְּבָרִים שֶׁאֶפְשָׁר לוֹ לִקְנוֹתָן מִמֶּנּוּ. כֵּיוָן שֶׁחָשַׁב בְּלִבּוֹ הֵיאַךְ יִקְנֶה דָּבָר זֶה וְנִפְתָּה בְּלִבּוֹ בַּדָּבָר עָבַר בְּלֹא תַּעֲשֶׂה שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים ה יח) \"לֹא תִתְאַוֶּה\" וְאֵין תַּאֲוָה אֶלָּא בַּלֵּב בִּלְבַד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who desires a home, a wife, utensils, or anything else belonging to a colleague that he can acquire from him, violates a negative commandment at the time he thinks in his heart, \"How is it possible to acquire this from him?\" and his heart is aroused by the matter, as Deuteronomy 5:18 states: \"Do not desire....\" Desire refers to feelings in the heart alone</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָא לָמַדְתָּ שֶׁהַמִּתְאַוֶּה עוֹבֵר בְּלָאו אֶחָד וְהַקּוֹנֶה דָּבָר שֶׁהִתְאַוָּה בְּהֶפְצֵר שֶׁהִפְצִיר בַּבְּעָלִים אוֹ בְּבַקָּשָׁה מֵהֶן עוֹבֵר בִּשְׁנֵי לָאוִין. לְכָךְ נֶאֱמַר (שמות כ יד) (דברים ה יח) \"לֹא תַחְמֹד\" וְ(דברים ה יח) \"לֹא תִתְאַוֶּה\". וְאִם גָּזַל עָבַר בִּשְׁלֹשָׁה לָאוִין</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, we see that a person who desires another person's property violates one negative commandment. One who purchases an object he desires after pressuring the owners and repeatedly asking them, violates two negative commandments. For that reason, the Torah prohibits both desiring and coveting. If he takes the article by robbery, he violates three negative commandments</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Talmud makes clear that, while coveting is forbidden, there is no punishment for it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[There is no punishment for mere evil intention], for it is said [in the Book of Psalms]:\nIf I saw iniquity in my heart, the Lord would not hear. [Ps. 66:18]…\n[If evil] intention does not [lead to action], the Holy One, blessed be He, does not [punish it]. [Kiddushin 40a]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Talmud also describes one way we can go about not coveting:  Taking action not to look into our neighbors’ affairs.  It says that if two people share the same courtyard, each can force his neighbor to build a wall in the middle so neither can look into the other's half. [Bava Batra 2a]</p>\n<p>The Talmud even goes beyond that, asserting that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Damage caused by looking is also damage. [Bava Batra 2b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This implies that the neighbor is somehow harmed by mere thought.  So coveting is damaging to the neighbor even if no action results from it.</p>\n\n\n",

Even simply offering the temurah as a consequence is, in and of itself a mitzvah (in at least a rabbinical sense).</p>\n<p>Shouldn't this answer of \"a mitzvah that comes about my means of committing a sin\" excuse a person from having to offer any temurah as a sacrifice?

Based on this, perhaps one can say a lomdishe answer - the aveira of making a temura is an aveira on the person for doing it, but it doesn’t transfer to the animal. The animal isn’t the thing that has the aveira done do it, all it has is the hekdesh, the aveira was the words that the person spoke. Therefore it’s not connected to the mitzvah/korban that is brought later. The only problem with this is that the Gemara says that chatas is an aveira, which seems to indicate that the animal itself is part of an aveira. However, based on this explanation of the Shelah, the issue by chatas is a separate reason of removing one sin through another. If so, there’s no proof that the animal became the part of the aveira and the idea that the aveira is only in the words may still be true).</p>\n\n\n",

We aren't supposed to <em>enable</em> someone to sin (this is called <em>lifnei iver</em>). \"Enable\" means if I didn't provide my help, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for them to do the sin.  The Talmud says if you're the only frankincense seller in the area, and a pagan asks to buy one pound of frankincense, you can't sell it to them because you are <em>enabling</em> their pagan worship. You may, however, sell a hundred pounds to <em>AJAX PAGAN WORSHIP SUPPLY</em>, knowing fully-well that Ajax will turn around and sell it in one-pound packages to individuals intending to use it -- because that's \"enabling the enabler.\" On the other hand, a dual-use product (the Talmud says selling firewood to a pagan temple, of which they probably use 80% to keep the building warm and 20% for their sacrifices) would be okay.</p>\n<p>B.) We also shouldn't <em>facilitate</em> someone's sin, however, there are a lot of loopholes there. If there are ten frankincense stores in town and if I turn away the pagan customer, he'll just go to the next one down the block, the short answer is \"better to say no when reasonably possible.\" (This is called <em>mesayea</em>)</p>\n<p>C.) We're not allowed to tell a sinner: \"hey, that sinful <em>action</em> you're doing is a-okay.\" (This is called <em>chanufah</em>.) \"You're a swell guy overall\" is a different matter.</p>\n<p>For a mental-health professional treating secular patients (as in they're Jewish but not observant? Non-Jews of no particular religious persuasion?), I don't see how any of the above would be an issue. (Well, you'd have to construe some very odd cases, like someone who tells you they're Jewish but choose not to keep Sabbath, they drive trucks on Saturdays, but need help getting over some phobia so they can get back to driving trucks on Saturdays ...)</p>\n<p>If someone goes to a mental-health professional for, let's say, substance-abuse counseling, then the professional focuses on that; no one's asking about their  theology or marital status and it's a moot point. (Or even if it comes up -- that's not what the therapist is helping here.)</p>\n<p>(To back up a minute: there were rabbis in the 1960s who were suspicious of mental-health professionals unless they were Orthodox Jews; concerned that they'd diagnose the cause of all ills as the person's faith. Today therapy is much more focused. The same way that we are comfortable trusting that the clinician is going to just focus on the issue at-hand, the Orthodox Jewish therapist has no business addressing irrelevant stuff in their patient's life.)</p>\n<p>The thorniest issue, then, would be providing marriage counseling to a couple that halacha would not allow together ... at that point it would probably be worth consulting professional codes of ethics/conduct and secular law about what's required. And a competent posek.</p>\n\n\n",

My curiosity was aroused regarding fish specifically as I read a scientific article discussing the matter which pointed out amongst other things that people have a tendency to project human traits onto animals. Another point was that fishing and avoiding “noxious stimuli” doesn’t prove they feel pain. Personally, I would be inclined to believe that dolphins for instance have a capacity for physical and emotional pain while some fish have more simple systems.</p>\n<p>Another reason I'm curious about this is that in “tract on prayer” by the rebbe Rashab in the eighth section, it is stated: “similarly a behema which doesn’t have daas doesn’t feel a wound or pain as much like a person does (but nonetheless feels some due to the koach hamidameh within the creatures neural system”))</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya!

That time begins when you add the water to the dough, and only passes if you are not working the dough.<br />\nStill, in order to avoid questions, we should finish the process within 18 minutes.<br />\nHowever, it is clear in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.461.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siman 461</a> that the process <em>ends</em> when you put the matzah in to bake. The baking time does not count. The way the poskim describe it is that the matzah begins to bake \"מיד\", immediately, and will not become chametz thereafter.<br />\nThat is the reason that we hold you should - if you bake on a dry griddle - heat the griddle first (מרתיח ואח\"כ מדביק) and then add the dough to it. Otherwise it isn't going to start baking right away.<br />\nThe <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh_HaRav%2C_Orach_Chayim.461.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav there</a> even says a remarkable thing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן שלא יאפה בחמה שיש לחוש שמא יחמיצו קודם שיתחילו לאפות כו'\nאבל אם עבר ואפה בחמה אף על\nפי שמותרות באכילה דכיון שהחום גדול כל כך עד שיוכל לאפות אין החום מניחן\nלהתחמץ אלא מיד הן מתחילין להאפות<br />\nSo too you should not bake in the sun... if you did violate this and bake in the sun,\neven though it is permissible to eat [He'll explain later that you can't use it for the mitzvah the first night] - <em>because if the heat is great enough that\nit is able to bake</em>, the heat will not let it become chametz; it begins to bake\nimmediately...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is saying that it is a logical consequence of the fact that it can bake at all. The clock stops.</p>\n<p>My question: Does anyone disagree with this? When we talk about 18 minute matzos, do we always mean, until the matzah goes into the oven?</p>\n<p>-Update: I saw in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chayei_Adam%2C_Shabbat_and_Festivals.128.25?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chayei Adam 128:25</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך צריך ליזהר הרבה שלא יוציא מן התנור עד שתהיה נאפה יפה ושיהיה התנור\nמחומם הרבה שלא תבא לידי חימוץ<br />\nOne needs to be very careful not to take it out of the oven before it\nis well baked, and that <em>the oven should be very hot</em>, so that it should\nnot come to חימוץ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why does the oven need to be \"very hot\", if there is no danger of חימוץ once it is baking? How could it be worse than baking it in the sun?<br />\n--Update update: <em>Maybe</em> he means, if you're trying to make a lot of matzah fast, there's going to be a temptation to take it out of the oven too soon - as his sentence began - unless the oven is very hot and speeds up the process.</p>\n<p>Update 3: I see that the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&st=&pgnum=267\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Igros Moshe 1:153</a> quotes this Chayei Adam (I think he means this one, though the sefer points to a slightly different paragraph that I think must be a mistake, 27 instead of 25), as evidence that the oven needs to have a minimum temperature.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You're asking two questions</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Does anyone argue with the idea that the clock stops once you put the matzah in the oven.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My answer. None of the big sources take an issue with this. I'm sure you can find many sources in more modern times who want everything to be done within 18 minutes as a matter of stringency, but the halakha is exactly what it says in the shulchan arukh. The reason the shulchan arukh is confident that the time ends once you put the bread in oven or on the cooking surface is that you were already supposed to ensure your cooking method will cook the matzah. Your oven is either pre-heated, or your saj/wok/frying pan/ roof tile/ any flat cooking surface already has a fire lit under it and is hot to the touch. If you have pre-heated your cooking instrument, then the 18 minutes stops the moment you start cooking your matzah. If this seems too easy, that's kind of the point. Everyone used to do this, even the uneducated amongst Jewry, men and women alike. It's only in the past few hundred years that suddenly we need experts to cook a flat bread.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Why does the oven need to be \"very hot\", if there is no danger of חימוץ once it is baking? How could it be worse than baking it in the sun?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is danger of chameitz if your cooking temperature is too low. Bread will rise faster the hotter it is UNTIL it reaches a temperature that the bread cooks and the yeast is killed off. If you are unable to get your matzah to reach that critical temperature from the exterior to the interior of the bread then you won't be making matzah, you will be making chameitz.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rs8ZZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rs8ZZ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>In the above picture you can see how this bread did not finish cooking through. This would definitely be chameitz and we are required to burn it if we have made it during the hag. In order to avoid having a bread that is still chameitz in the center one must ensure they do not prepare their matzah to be too thick, and that they do not cook at too low or too high of a temperature. Although no one discusses it, it is entirely possible to have the oven be so hot that you burn the outside and don't fully cook the inside. This usually occurs with matzah being made too thick, remember according to halakha one can bake matzah up to a tefach thick.</p>\n\n\n",

When we returned twelve months later, we saw that they were crafting beams from its skeleton, and they began to rebuild those destroyed towns.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.73b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 73b</a>)</p>\n<p>What exactly is the meaning of this midrash and what does each number symbolize?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Artscroll brings in an explanation from Olelos Efrayim (§547)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The \"ship\" is the person in his passage through this world (as above,\n73a note 21 (Ch. 51). Rabbah states that during his sojourn in this\nworld he took note of the effect the death of tzaddikim had on people.\nEcclesiastes compares the death of a person to a fish being caught, as\nit is written (Ecclesiastes 9:12): For a man does not even know his\nhour; like fish caught in a bad net. Thus, the death of the fish in\nour story represents the death of a person.</p>\n<p>God is very particular with righteous people; they sometimes die on\naccount of a very small misdeed. A sin contaminates a person and is\ntherefore compared to a creeping thing which is a source of\ncontamination (see Leviticus 11:43). Thus, Rabbah said that a small\ncreeping thing settled in the nostrils of the tzaddik and took away\nfrom him the breath of life.</p>\n<p>How do people react to the death of a righteous person? There are\nthree classes of people. The first class reacts with extreme\nabstinence. They see that even the righteous die on account of a minor\nsin and they therefore decide to live a life of self-denial and\nabstain from all worldly activities. Their lives are thereby\ndevastated. That is not the way God intended the world. They are the\ncities that are destroyed by the dead fish.</p>\n<p>The second class reacts just the opposite way. Seeing that even the\nrighteous perish they perceive death as the ultimate end of all\nactivity and disregard the after-life. They therefore say to\nthemselves: For the time being let us eat and drink and make merry,\nfor tomorrow we will die (see Isaiah 22:13). Death teaches them to\nindulge in worldly pleasures. They are the cities that eat from the\ndead fish.</p>\n<p>The third class adopts a sensible attitude. Death teaches them that\none has to collect as many merits as possible while still alive so\nthat their reward should be preserved for the next world. They are the\ncities that salt the dead fish to preserve it for later.</p>\n<p>The barrels of oil are an allusion to the reward of the World to Come,\nas the Gemara (Taanis 25a) relates that R' Elazar ben Pedas dreamt of\nrivers of balsam oil which represented his reward in the World to\nCome. In our story, the oil came from the pupil of one eye, meaning\nthat the reward is a result of God's surveillance, as it is written\n(Psalms 33:18): Behold God's eye is on those who fear Him.</p>\n<p>[A year later, Rabbah saw them rebuilding the destroyed cities. The\neffects of even the most traumatic experiences wear off with time.\nAccording to the Gemara (Berachos 58b) a person forgets a deceased one\nafter twelve months. Thus, in our story, even those who were most\nmoved by the death of the fish, to the extent that their lives were\nshattered, could be seen a year later rebuilding their lives, totally\noblivious to the former events.]</p>\n<p>This story teaches that upon the death of a righteous person, one\nshould be stirred to performance of mitzvos with extra zeal.\nFurthermore, one should be aware of the fact that the inspiration\nderived from any event wears off with time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Saying berachot \"in your heart\"?",
    "content": "# Saying berachot \"in your heart\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems that l'chatchila one should say berachot out loud to fulfill one's obligation (see for example Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.206.3?lang=bi&with=Mishneh%20Torah,%20Blessings&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). The stipulation of the SA is that if the blessing is inaudible, one is yotzei \"as long as the words depart from one's lips\". Does that mean sound must come out, or that the lips must move, or other? What ramifications does this have for repeating (or not) a beracha that you said 'inaudibly'?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Blessings.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Berachot 1:7</a>) holds that b'diavad, if you don't say it out loud you are yotzei i.e., you say it \"in your heart\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַבְּרָכוֹת כֻּלָּן צָרִיךְ שֶׁיַּשְׁמִיעַ לְאָזְנוֹ מַה שֶּׁהוּא אוֹמֵר וְאִם לֹא הִשְׁמִיעַ לְאָזְנוֹ יָצָא בֵּין שֶׁהוֹצִיא בִּשְׂפָתָיו בֵּין שֶׁבֵּרֵךְ בְּלִבּוֹ:</p>\n<p>A person should recite all the blessings loud enough for him to hear what he is saying. Nevertheless, a person who does not recite a blessing out loud fulfills his obligation, whether he verbalizes the blessing or merely recites it in his heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this Rambam it seems that you would not need to repeat a beracha said \"in the heart\" (i.e., inaudible, or no lip motion).</p>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is the reason for the Rambam allowing (albeit b'diavad) blessings \"in the heart\"?</li>\n<li>Do any opinions hold that you can say berachot 'in your head' l'chatchila?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Note:\nAlthough there are similar questions (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/89032/is-a-silent-mental-bracha-considered-valid\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/7872/which-parts-of-the-prayer-service-must-be-said-clearly-out-loud\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/82094/is-it-better-to-say-a-blessing-quietly-or-loudly/82099#82099\">here</a>) elsewhere in MY. Some questions deal with 'how loud'. This question is specific to berachot 'in the heart'. This also addresses the reason behind the Rambam and whether there are opinions that allow this l'chatchila.</p>\n\n\n",

I know that many (if not all) of their flavors are listed on the KSA's website as Kosher, with the caveat that they are only certified when in the original sealed container, which- for obvious reasons- is near impossible to obtain in a retail setting.</p>\n<p>I've corresponded with their corporate offices and been told that they are all franchises are required to obtain their product from the corporate factory.

In general, I am curious as to how much of these Psaks on Kashrus matters are founded in Halacha, and how much are based on the specific Rav's opinions and assumptions; for example - can a franchise store that is required by contract to obtain its product from one source be trusted to do so, or must we suspect that they might decide to find another, non-kosher supplier?</p>\n<p>Is that a suspicion that is founded in halacha (such as the concept of Chazaka, or lack thereof), or is it purely that Rav's opinion on what liberties a company may or may not take?

However, what I would prefer is the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is written in an engaging, perhaps entertaining style, succinct rather than long-winded (I'm thinking something akin to the Ra'avad's commentary to the Mishneh Torah).</li>\n<li>The author is well-known in Orthodox circles. (If I'm going to read one responsa collection, I'd rather it not be obscure.)</li>\n<li>It is printed in clear square font rather than Rashi script, with at least minimal punctuation.</li>\n<li>It has minimal roshei teivos. In other words, not like this: (ומשני דס\"ל כירושלמי דפליג ארב הונא והמנהג וס\"ל כרנב\"י ע\"כ יש לנו לפסוק כרנב\"י וק\"ל, from a Responsa of the Remah on Sefaria).</li>\n<li>Similarly, citations to the Tanakh, Talmud, or other authorities are not so truncated or opaque that only someone with a Yeshiva background (which I lack) would follow the thread.</li>\n<li>If it contains cross-references in the style of Ein Mishpat or Masoret HaShas, that would be an added bonus but not a requirement.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The choice may come down to the right publisher. For example, I recently purchased <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Mechilta-deRabbi-Yishmael-with-Nineteen-Mefarshim-3-vol.---Zichron-Aharon-Edition__p-11239.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this set</a> of the Mekhilta from Zichron Aharon, which has all the roshei teivos expanded and is printed in a nice clear font on high-quality paper, with a masoret, making it a joy to learn from for a beginner.

Another good candidate would be Rav Ovadia's Yechave Daat. They are generally intended to be shorter and more accessible to an audience with less background, as opposed to his denser and more encyclopedic shutim in Yabia Omer. He is of course Sephardic, but usually makes clear what is a uniquely Sephardic issue versus what is not.</p>\n<p>You might also want to check out Igrot Moshe. You might find it a little dense and/or not as engaging. But especially if you are in America he's pretty influential and most of his shutim are not longwinded and I think pretty clear.</p>\n<p>Another recommendation I really enjoy, though a little farther from your list of criteria, would be Rav Chaim David HaLevi's Aseh L'cha Rav. He writes in Modern (less \"Rabbinic\") Hebrew and also deals with more hashkafa and not just halakha. Those may be pluses or minuses for you. He is also less widely known today, but still generally mainstream and respected, especially in Dati Leumi circles.</p>\n<p>One thing you might want to consider is that different authors have different styles in terms of whether they mainly want to focus on basics of the gemara and rishonim versus giving you a lay of the land of what other acharonim said. Rav Moshe and Rav HaLevi were both much more in the former camp; Rav OVadia is more in the latter camp.</p>\n<p>PS You probably already know this but you can sample shutim of most of these works online.

He points out that such practice certainly makes sense if the reason for reciting this <em>kedushah</em> is as a substitute for the <em>kedushah</em> of the <em>amidah</em>. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Beit_Yosef%2C_Orach_Chaim.132.2.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beit Yosef, Orach Chaim 132:2</a>.)

Rather, we are merely prolonging the service, and thereby delaying the return of the wicked to <em>gehinnom</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tur%2C_Orach_Chaim.295.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur, Orach Chaim 295</a>). Therefore, he believes that one can recite this <em>kedushah</em> in whatever postion one likes.</p>\n<p>In a footnote, he points to a comment of R.

Yaakov Tzemach's <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14835&st=&pgnum=133\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nagid uMetzaveh</a> which sounds like one should specifically sit, presumably for kabbalistic reasons.</p>\n<p>However, he writes that he believes that the common custom is indeed to stand. He conjectures that the reason people do this is because they have the practice to stand for <em>vihi noam</em> and Tehillim 91 (see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sha%27arei_Teshuvah_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.295.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'arei Teshuvah 295:1</a>).

The Mishna Brura (29-1) explains that they used to say a bracha because they wore the tfillin the whole day and held that night-time isn't a time for tfillin, hence taking off the tfillin before nightfall, was a mitzva which required a bracha. We hold that night-time is zman tfillin (and the only reason we don't wear them then is out of fear that we might fall asleep), hence we don't make a bracha when removing them.\nThe Dirshu edition of the Mishna Brura points to the MB in 25-59, who brings from the Elya Rabbah that on Rosh Chodesh one should remove the tfillin just before saying  יה\"ר מלפניך...שנשמור חקיך בעולם הזה. The Elya Rabbah himself (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41130&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41130&st=&pgnum=19</a>) writes that the reason for that is because of the ברכה that they used to say.</p>\n\n\n",

Abaye said: In Gilead, which is located on the\neast bank of the Jordan, murderers are common.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since Gilead is a city with a proclivity for murder, why would Menashe's family want to take it? (This sounds similar to Yaakov giving Shechem to Yosef.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First a question, does R. Abaye mean it was known for having many murderers at the time it was given to Menashe, or in his own time? Note that it does not say they \"built\" the cities, but \"rebuilt them.\" If he referred to the time of the conquest, then the tribes were supposed to conquer or drive out any men that remained in the land.</p>\n<p>But it was not just one town we are talking about. The text makes it clear that the land itself was a major reason why Gad and Reuven wanted territory in the region, so presumably this is one reason why it was attractive to Menashe as well.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the Reubenites and Gadites had a very large number of livestock.\nNoticing that the land of Jazer <em>and of Gilead</em> was a place suited to\nlivestock, 2 the Gadites and Reubenites came to Moses and Eleazar the\npriest and to the leaders of the community and said, 3“The region of\nAtaroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo and\nBaal-meon— 4 the land which the Lord has laid low before the community\nof Israel, is a land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, Menashe was not only given one particular town, but a major part of the <em>region</em> of Gilead. In fact, we know of two towns with the name of Gilead included in their designation (Jabesh-gilead near the Jordan and Ramoth-gilead further east). The map below makes clear why Menashe wanted it: it was a very large region, virtually equaling the size of the large territory they were allotted west of the Jordan. It made them the largest tribe in terms of land. So it was a major bonus, including not only the two towns mentioned above, but several others, as well as rivers, pasturage, trade routes and other natural resources.</p>\n<p>So even if ancient Jabesh-gilead was known to R. Abaye for having many murderers, that problem was more than made up for by the territory and other towns given to the tribe. In addition, we may consider that other towns - especially those in Canaan proper - had other problems just as thorny and perhaps more so, such as idolatry and various other forms of immoral behavior.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e3rNw.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/e3rNw.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

Unlike Kiddushin where the husband affects the marriage, by a divorce he merely does an action, and the divorce happened by itself.

The trouble with that explanation is that, if so, why is there no hei for the earlier days (at least days 2 to 5)? Ibn Ezra on Gen 1:31 gives two examples of word-pairs in smichut with a hei prefixed to the second word, but I think both examples could be proper nouns.

    "content": "# Chabad Method of folding Tallis under instead of over?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So i've been struggling at times during Shacharis trying to prevent my tallis gadol from unraveling and sliding off my shoulder, it oddly mostly seems to happen on the right side and less frequently on the left side. I fold it upwards onto the shoulder, but i think Chabad folds it from under, which seems more practical and lesser chances of it sliding off. However i've tried to tuck it under but it always gets jammed or stuck midway and doesnt go flat on my shoulder or the tziszis at the back tend to be on my shoulder rather than behind shoulder. What can i do?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ask someone that folds their tallis this way to show you how is a good option. If there is a chabad house near you I'm sure the shliach would be happy to help. Alternatively while it seems to not be very common I have occasionally seen clips used to help the tallis from slipping off. Is it possible your tallis is just not big enough? If there is only a s.all amount of material on your shoulders the tallis is more likely to fall off. Lastly, there are tallesim that are designed with a non slip weave.</p>\n<p>Best of success</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Try folding it up until it fits on your shoulder, and then roll the edges under a few times.</p>\n\n\n",

(and know what to do when)</p>\n<p>Are there moments where the denominations diverge a lot and what happens during an event is a surprise for someone from another domination?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I think Rabbi Kaii has provided this an excellent answer. He has given the broad strokes, and I would emphasize that the experience of many Orthodox Jews would be that they would feel \"at home\" in an Orthodox/traditional Shabbat service in any country in the world, even across the Ashkenazi/Sefardi divide, but going to a Reform synagogue across town would be disorienting and extremely difficult halachically, particularly because of the following:</p>\n<p>(1) Reform congregations often use microphones and musical instruments, which Orthodox Jews would see as strict violations of Shabbat laws, and even worse, these violations are occurring publicly and intentionally, which carry strict penalties under Torah law.</p>\n<p>(2) Many prayers are skipped and/or recited in English and/or altered, which means that Orthodox Jews would not fulfill their obligation (or feel they did not fulfill their obligation) by attending these services unless they can find a traditional prayer book.</p>\n<p>(3) The use of female cantors (who lead the congregation in prayer and in reading the Torah), and also females called up to the Torah, as well as mixed seating, are alien to Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n<p>On the flip side, I know from experience that many Reform Jews are quite uncomfortable at an Orthodox service.  For one thing, unless it is a bar mitzvah and the Rabbi sees that there are many non-traditional Jews present, it is rare that congregants are told which page/prayer they are on, and (in Ashkenazi synagogues) much of the service is davened (prayed) in an undertone. As a result, many Reform Jews will not know what's going on, and will need someone next to them to show them \"where we are.\" And there will be very many prayers with which they will be unfamiliar. There are of course exceptions, and some will be able to follow along well, but that would be the minority.</p>\n<p>Second, Reform Jews, who are used to egalitarianism, which in fact is one of the focal points of Reform Judaism, will be struck by the lack of female involvement in any aspect of the service. I have heard from many Reform Jews (male and female) that the reason they avoid Orthodox synagogues is because they palpably feel a sense of injustice during the service due to what they view as gender inequality. The same issue may arise for Conservative Jews, who are generally trending in that direction.</p>\n<p>So for very concrete reasons, the divide between the the more liberal and traditional forms of Judaism results in a situation where both sides would feel a great deal of discomfort attending a service of the other. This is really unfortunate, and I wish I knew where the solution lies.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Yes and no.</p>\n<p>Within traditional denominations (ones that preserve the tradition without modification), there is a near universal phenomena of mutual understanding. A sefardi orthodox jew can pray in an ashkenazi synagogue and understand everything (even though there are many differences). He may struggle with the accent, but the language is the same, and the practices will be similar enough. Any differences might arise from small differences in opinions in the earlier authorities, and each community picking a different opinion. Other differences will be superficial, such as the build of a Scroll of Torah, and these are personality differences, rather than substantial differences. The content in that Torah will be identical, letter for letter.</p>\n<p>However, the problem arises with non-traditional denominations. They will often struggle to share, agree or even understand each other, as well as traditional denominations and vice versa. Generally speaking, if I were to go into a reform synagogue as an orthodox Rabbi, there would be some things I'd recognise, and some things I'd feel are antithetical to Torah, and some things that are clearly not Torah-based at all.</p>\n<p>One point you made, that they are all \"christian\". Same will be true of Judaism. All Jews, traditional or non-traditional, are Jewish. Judaism is inherited at birth and is permanent, irrespective of practice or tradition.</p>\n<p>My source for this is personal experience, as well as common knowledge. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has a wonderful lecture that explains this traditional/non traditional divide.</p>\n\n\n",

Rav says: It means that the Torah does not deem the intercourse of one who is less than nine years old to be like the intercourse of one who is at least nine years old, as for a male’s act of intercourse to have the legal status of full-fledged intercourse the minimum age is nine years. And Shmuel says: The Torah does not deem the intercourse of a child who is less than three years old to be like that of one who is three years old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So from there I understand that once a man is 9 years old (or three years old according to Shmuel), if he performs homosexual acts he is liable to death. Fine. But the next verse states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במאי קמיפלגי רב סבר כל דאיתיה בשוכב איתיה בנשכב וכל דליתיה בשוכב ליתיה בנשכב\nThe Gemara asks: With regard to what principle do Rav and Shmuel disagree? The Gemara answers: Rav holds that any halakha that applies to one who engages in intercourse actively applies to one who engages in intercourse passively, and any halakha that does not apply to one who engages in intercourse actively does not apply to one who engages in intercourse passively. Therefore, just as one who engages in intercourse actively is not liable if he is less than nine years old, as the intercourse of such a child does not have the halakhic status of intercourse, so too, if a child who is less than nine years old engages in homosexual intercourse passively, <strong>the one who engages in intercourse with him is not liable</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is someone who is over the age of 9 not liable for death for these acts to someone less than 9? I see Rashi refernces Nidda 45a which says that intercourse with somone less than three is like a finger to the eye but I don't understand what that means, an explanation would help.

Below 9 years old it is not considered intercourse for him to do such an act and therefore receiving intercourse will also not make liable the pursuer.</p>\n<p>Shmuel argues and states that being on the receiving end of a forbidden relation applies just like a woman which is possible from the age of 3.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplified Explanation</strong></p>\n<p>Legally Rav is deciding that the factor causing the change is the child (גברא), and so he is analyzed to know when he makes a determinant difference in other cases. ie: his ability to become liable when he commits the act.</p>\n<p>Shmuel is analyzing the act (מעשה) in general, and since elsewhere it would cause liability to a 3 yr old, here it does too.</p>\n<p><strong>Philisophical Explanation</strong></p>\n<p>I think that a Beis Din can still kill the adult who sleeps with an 8 yr old or imprison him if they so choose, or if civil law exists they can use that.</p>\n<p>In regard to the adult's lack of death penalty:</p>\n<p>The death penalty by being administered is an act that helps or entirely cleanses the person of their sin. It is part of the atonement if done and accepted properly.</p>\n<p>Perhaps this man who slept with a child so young is such a disgusting crime that Hashem does not want this person to have a redemptive punishment. It is so awful he does not have a way of fixing such an atrocity with the death penalty! (Hashem has other ways to still kill him btw, should the court not do so) instead he will be destroyed in the next world.</p>\n<p>I am borrowing the logic of Rashba (שו׳׳ת ח׳׳ד סי׳ יח) where he discusses a father who gives his children to Molech - interestingly another incident with children.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gmara holds that for holding juridically an intercourse, there is a minimum age. For a girl it is 3 years; for a boy it is \"usually\" (when he is active) 9 years. Hence the mah'loket if for this case it is 9 or 3 years.</p>\n<p>You ask in commentary \"the adult is still punished for doing the act, what is his punishment ?\" Logically, he will have to pay the 5 things to pay for \"civil\" procedure: nezek - reimbursement of the damage caused, tsaar - the pain, ripouy - costs of the doctor, chevet - the loss of earnings during treatment and disability, boshet - the shame.</p>\n\n\n",

For the Prophets and Writings, these are commonly understood to be a study cycle.

The grotto contains a tomb, which some believe is the tomb of the prophet Elisha.</p>\n<p>It seems that recently there has been a surge of Breslov Hasidim (especially but not only followers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Berland\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliezer Berland</a>) that have been attempting to frequent the site.</p>\n<p>Some, like these fellows, made it all the way in (<a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.co.il/news/crime/article/14286102\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hdcEz.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/hdcEz.jpg\" alt=\"Two Jewish men praying praying at site believed to be Elisha's tomb beneath church altar\" /></a></p>\n<p>Others have been accosted/assaulted for their conspicuous presence near the Stella Maris Monastery (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLwkn6oYuck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gldqJ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/gldqJ.png\" alt=\"Jew assaulted outside monastery\" /></a></p>\n<p>It seems that those that are attempting to infiltrate the site, are doing so in the belief that they are emulating R. Nathan of Breslov (one of the main disciples of Nahman of Breslov). In Yeme Moharant (vol. 2, sec. 158) he records the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והמערה חדוש נפלא ושמחנו שם מאד. ואחר כך כשיצאנו עד שבאנו על פתח החצר\nשל המערה, התחילו לשיר ולזמר עד שבאנו לתוך שמחה גדולה. ורקדנו שם בשמחה\nבשמחה בעזרת השם יתברך. משם הלכנו עד שבאנו על קבר אלישע בן שפט אשר עד\nהנה עמד שם בית תפלה שלהם, וזה סמוך סתר אותה הפאשי (מושל תורכי(, ועתה\nיכולים לילך על קברו הקדוש. ותהלה לאל היינו שם אנחנו כלנו בעזרת השם\nיתברך</p>\n<p>And the is a novel wonder and we were very happy there. And then when\nwe went out until we came to the entrance of the courtyard of the\ncave, we began to sing and sing until we achieved great joy. And we\ndanced there happily with joy with God's help. From there we walked\nuntil we arrived at the grave of Elisha ben Shafat, which until here\nstood their \"house of vanity\" [play on words that could also be read\nas house of prayer], and it was nearby that the Pasha (high ranking\nOttoman officer) blocked it, however now we can go to his holy grave.\nAnd praise be to God, we were there with the help of God, may He be\nblessed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><s>Though I can speculate (perhaps the Ottomans at the time stripped the site of its Christian iconograghy in an attempt to Islamicize the site?), I do not really know what the basis of R. Nathan's actions were. Nevertheless, that he seemed to believe it was permissible seems to be sufficient to those Hasidim attempting to now emulate him.</s></p>\n<p>As has been pointed out in the comments, R. Nathan is said to have visited at a time when the church was in a state of ruin. Accordingly, the circumstances facing those seeking to visit today when there is a fully restored church on the site are different than those he faced.</p>\n<p>R. Ben-Sion Musafi seems to sidestep the issue by responding tersely to a questioner as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאלה: רציתי לדעת בבקשה האם מותר להיכנס לקבר אלישע הנביא הממוקם בתוך\nמנזר נוצרי בחיפה ?תודה ותזכו למצוות. תשובה: בכלל לא בטוח ששם קברו</p>\n<p>Q: I would like to please know if it is permitted to enter the tomb of\nElisha the Prophet which is in a place that is within a Christian\nmonostary in Haifa? Thank you, may you merit more miswoth.</p>\n<p>A: It is not at all certain that he is buried there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Others however are not circumspect and absolutely forbid entry to the church. R. Yishaq Rasabi writes as follows <a href=\"https://www.maharitz.com/hordot/shiurim/554.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sh'are Yishaq, Mose Shabboth Debharim, p. 5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בימים ההם, כאשר לא היה פה שלטון, נלחמו וכבשו כל מיני אומות, מי שהצליח\nבמלחמות, תפשו הם את המקום מאז, ובנו שם מנזר על הקבר. ויהודים רוצים\nלהתפלל על הקבר, אבל אי אפשר, אסור להיכנס לבית של נערים, זה כמו כנסייה,\nעבודה זרה, זהו מקום טמא. אז אמרו, טוב, אולי נבנה איזה בית בסביבה,\nונתפלל שם, סמוך לקבר לפחות. ועתה באו אלי הנ\"ל להציע את סְפָקֶם אם מותר\nלהתפלל על קברו. וכן האם מותר לפרסם הדבר, שהרי זה יכול להכשיל אחרים\nשיכנסו למנזר לחפש את המערה ולהתפלל שם על קברו ממש. אולי ישנם כאלה שלא\nיודעים שהדבר אסור, ויתפללו על הקבר ממש. ובתוך דבריהם הראו לי מתולדות\nרבינו האור החיים הקדוש וז\"ל, רבינו ותלמידיו עלו גם לראש ההר, כדי\nלהתפלל על קברו של נביא אלישע בן שפט. ומשנוכחו לדעת כי הנערים השתלטו על\nהמקום, עמדו במרחק, ומיררו בבכי על חילול המקום בידי הערלים. ע\"כ. ובעיקר\nבאו בשאלתם, לאיזה צד ולאיזה כיוון ראוי להתפלל. והוא עונה על כך, הנה זה\nודאי שאין שום היתר ליכנס לתוך בית תיפלתם אפילו כדי להשתטח על קברי\nצדיקים. אפי' אם ישנו איזה הכרח, כגון אם ישנה איזו מתיחות בין יהודים\nלגויים, וצריכים אולי להיכנס למקום שלהם. ואף משום איבה אסור לעשות כן,\nכמ\"ש בספר ארעא דרבנן [סימן שנ\"דו בשם תלמידי רבינו יונה, שאין להתיר\nאיסור תורה משום איבה. מה שיהיה קצת שנאה ח\"ו בין יהודים לבין גויים, זאת\nלא סיבה להתיר איסורי תורה. וללכת לבית תפלותם הוא איסור דאורייתא, ואכן\nגם בחצר אסור לעמוד. וכמו שמצינו בספר חסידים [סימן תל'\"הו, כומר אחד היה\nחייב ליהודי כסף, וידע הכומר שלא ילך אחריו לבית תיפלות. וכשהיה היהודי\nהולך לתבוע ממנו את חובו, הלך הנכרי לבית התיפלות, ולא רצה היהודי לילך\nאחריו שם וכו'. היה כומר אחד שהיה חייב ליהודי כסף, וידע שהיהודי לא\nייכנס למקום שלהם, אז מתי שהיהודי מחפש אותו בכדי שיחזיר לו את החוב, הוא\nהיה בורח לבית התיפלה, וכך הוא מתחמק ממנו. רואים שם שהיהודי עמד בנסיון,\nלמרות. החוב. אותו רשע ניצל את חוסר האפשרות שלו להיכנס, זה היה בשבילו\nכמו עיר מקלט</p>\n<p>In those days, when there was no government here, all kinds of nations\nfought and conquered, whoever was successful in the wars, they\noccupied the place ever since, and built a monastery there on the\ngrave. And Jews want to pray on the grave, but it's impossible, it's\nforbidden to enter a men’s monastery, it's like a church, idolatry,\nit's an unclean place. So they said, well, maybe we'll build a\nstructure nearby, and pray there, near the grave at least. And now the\nabove have come to me to offer an opinion on whether it is permissible\nto pray over his grave. And also whether it is permissible to publish\nthe matter, since this could become a stumbling block to others who\nwill end up entering the monastery to look for the cave and pray there\nover his actual grave. Perhaps there are those who do not know that\nthis is forbidden, and will pray over the actual grave. And in the\nmidst of their words, they showed me from the history of the holy\nRabbenu, ha-Ohr ha-Haim, of blessed memory, he and his students\nascended the mount, to pray over the grave of the prophet Elisha ben\nShefat. When they saw that the priests had taken over the place, they\nstood at a distance, and wept bitterly over the desecration of the\nplace by the heathens. And mainly they came with their question, to\nwhich side and in which direction it is appropriate to pray. And he\n[the Ohr ha-Haim] answers that, here it is certain that there is no\npermission to enter into the “House of Vanity” [i.e. the church] even\nto prostrate on the graves of the righteous. Even if there were some\nnecessity, such as if there is some tension between Jews and gentiles,\nwhence we should perhaps need to enter their place. And even where\nthere’s concern of breeding enmity it is forbidden to do so, as is\nfound in the Sefer Ar’aa de-Rabanan [s. 354] written in the name of\nRabbi Yona's disciples, that a prohibition of the Torah should not be\npermitted because of enmity. Whatever minor enmity that may be aroused\nbetween Jews and Gentiles, is not a [sufficient] reason to permit\nTorah prohibitions. And going to their house of prayer is a Torah\nprohibition, and indeed it is also forbidden to stand in their\ncourtyard. And as we see in Sefer Hasidim [S. 346] a certain priest\nowed money to a Jew, and the priest knew the Jew would not to follow\nhim to their house of vanity. And when the Jew was going to claim his\ndebt from him, the gentile went into the house of vanity, and the Jew\ndid not want to follow him there, etc. There was a priest who owed\nmoney to a Jew, and he knew that the Jew would not enter their place,\nso when the Jew sought him out in order to repay the debt, he would\nrun away to the house of vanity, and thus he avoids him. You see there\nthat the Jew stood the test, despite the debt owed to him. That evil\none took advantage of his impossibility to enter, it was for him [the\npriest] like a city of refuge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edit with additional source: At an earlier date, R. Rahamim Yosef Haim Oplatka wrote (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?sits=1&req=21043&st=%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2&_rnd=0.4846390627320708\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mas'e ha-Yerah</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>למעלה בראש ההר כנסיה של נצרים ויש אומרים כי שם קבור אלישע בן שפט הנביא\nזיע”א  ומפני רבוי צלמים אשר שם לא עלינו למעלה</p>\n<p>At the top of the mountain there is a Christian church and some say\nthat the prophet Elisha b.

See Nefesh Hachaim (3:12) that Rebbi Chanina was not affected by witchcraft and was not scared (even as a witch gathered dust beneath his feet to cast a spell) because he believed and knew that there is only one power, Hashem. He clung to Hashem and so nothing else could affect him. The Nefesh Hachaim writes this is a great thing to save one's self from judgements and designs of others.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובאמת הוא ענין גדול וסגולה נפלאה להסר ולבטל מעליו כל דינין ורצונות\nאחרים שלא יוכלו לשלוט בו ולא יעשו שום רושם כלל, כשהאדם קובע בלבו לאמר,\nהלא ה' הוא האלקים האמיתי, ואין עוד מלבדו יתברך שום כח בעולם...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally, I consider the most practical and beneficial as it causes one to be a greater person and connect to Hashem.</p>\n<p>2). In the Sefer \"Divrei Torah\" (ח׳׳ו סי׳ נ׳׳ו) he states that the Rambam held that one who doesn't believe in Kishuf it has no affect on him. Similar to #1 but not the same. He surmises that this is why the Rambam says witchcraft is not real. So his followers in Egypt (the heart of witchcraft) would not be affected even though perhaps the Rambam knew it was real. I am sure many would disagree with this part, but many times we find if you do not believe in something it has no effect: demons, evil eye etc...</p>\n<p>3). See Taamei HaMinhagim (likut 128) that water will undo or remove any magical effect (see Rashi Sanhedrin 67: That he connected it to water and it turned into a tree since it was only through magic and is nullified with water). Perhaps this means River water or even Ocean water.</p>\n<p>Similarly Ahavat Yonatan mentions the ability of פשתן to stop witchcraft (see הפטרת שלח לך).</p>\n<p>4).

Is it wrong for me to do that as a yachid davening at home ? Also not to mention its an optional tefillah as its done privately, sounds like its up to the one davening wether he wants that private time or not after the amidah.

I would advise finding the best way that suites you, whilst also complying with at least a minimal standard of halacha. The tefillah we have nowadays in the siddur is a mixture of tefillot that are obligatory and not. However, many of the non-obligatory parts have become a strong part of the minhag of tefillah. That is not to say that one must say them all at any cost.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, if you dont have kavanah for tachanum, the answer may not be \"not saying it at all\" but rather: figuring a way to make it meaningful for you. That could be, shortening it, reading a translation, saying it every other day, writing your own personalised abridged version, etc.</p>\n<p>You could ask yourself what it is about the mincha tachanun that resonates with you, and how can you channel that into the shacharit tachanun.</p>\n<p>Also, anecdotally, Rav Hershel Schachter has written that for the long tachanun on Monday and Thursday, he would only say half of it* because he finds that minyanim say it too quickly. We can learn from this that it <em>is</em> sometimes (always?) appropriate to go for quality over quantity. If there are a few sentences that are meaningful for you, focus on that.</p>\n<p>I find that if you hold on to a little, it could be a seed thats planted for the future. If you have some roots to hold on to, it could flourish into a tree. In the same way, don't discard tachanun entirely, do something small and meaningful for you, and see where it goes.</p>\n<p>*I think he would say one half on Monday and the other half on Thursday</p>\n\n\n",

I don't know if this would be 2D since the artwork is flat, or 3D because of the inwardness, despite it being relatively low sunk relief. Also this picture gives it an even stronger feeling of curving that would be presented, if any at all, because of the material its being carved on.

People getting a kibbud do not.\nI have previously only seen this at Chasidish or Sefardic shuls.\nI tried looking and could not find any of the sources for this custom either way.

Friedman pronounces the word in the video.</p>\n<p>What does <em>hisi'yani</em> mean?</p>\n<p>Well, literally it would mean something like \"he picked me up.\" But the word is also used in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnaic_Hebrew\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishnaic Hebrew</a> in the context of giving (good) advice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּא הוּא וִיבִמְתּוֹ לְבֵית דִּין, וְהֵן <strong>מַשִּׂיאִין לוֹ עֵצָה</strong> הַהוֹגֶנֶת לוֹ</p>\n<p>He and his sister-in-law come to the court, and they <strong>give him advice</strong> appropriate for him</p>\n<p>(<em><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Yevamot.12.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yevamot 12:6</a></em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I haven't found another source that reads the verse this way, but I'm fairly confident that this is what Rabbi Friedman is doing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Hebrew root to הִשִּׁיאַ֖נִי also has a connotation of marriage (אירוסין ו<strong>נישואין</strong>) as in the Nachash <em><strong>seduced me into having marital relations</strong></em> with him.</p>\n<p>And this is the teaching that is brought by Abarbanel's commentary to the Torah, Midrash Chemdat Yamim, Seder HaDorot and many other sources, that prior to Adam and Chava having marital relations, Chava had marital relations, meaning sexual intercourse with the Nachash.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does it mean to \"cleave to the letters\" during prayer or Torah study?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the teachings of the Baal Shem Tov, it talks about \"cleaving to the letters\" during prayer or Torah study. It has to do with the Hebrew letters and a special way of visualizing or focusing on them during prayer or study. It seems to be an actual method or technique for meditation. What does this mean on a practical level? I know this has something to do with meditation and kavanah.</p>\n<p>Is anybody familiar with this, and is anyone able to provide some actual instructions for how this is to be done? I would highly appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think what this is saying is that one should treat the words properly.</p>\n<p>There are two ingredients to a proper tefilla as Hashem needs it. The first is with <em>kavana</em>, which means putting one's soul into it; concentrating and contemplating the words, feeling the meaning of the words with love and fear; meaning it sincerely. If you would like further information about davening with <em>kavana</em> in english, I recommend purchasing a \"<a href=\"https://www.lehmanns.co.uk/pathway-to-prayer-for-weekday-ashkenaz.html?gclid=Cj0KCQjwk96lBhDHARIsAEKO4xamsRF5nd4RFX_515oiYSjF2-En9GF7QlNFOTcpJv7i3bTc29uS_GsaAms4EALw_wcB\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pathway to Prayer</a>\" book and reading the introductions*.</p>\n<p><strong>The other is davening with <em>dveykut</em>, with cleaving</strong>. This means even if you don't know what you are saying (and what business is it of ours anyway), you do know that these are not your words, they are Hashem's precious words. They are profound, powerful words written by prophets, that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/133143/31534\">fulfil the needs of Above</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא לחינם אמרו החכמים דתפילה צורך גבוה הוא</p>\n<p>It wasn't for nothing that the Sages said that prayer is the <em>needs of Above</em>\n(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Orach_Chaim.89.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch Hashulchan OC 89:8</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saying them with <em>dveykut</em> means treating them with awe, saying them slowly and carefully like handling fine china. It is intimately connected, and aimed at bringing about a <strong>cleaving to Hashem</strong>, and it therefore means being aware of Who you are saying them to, and how much you mean to Him, and how important your tefilla is for Him, how precious these words are to Him, and being aware that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this is in His service</a>, not our own. Indeed, one can't cleave to someone else if one is busy with one's own needs.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mashal is told of the wife who complains to her husband that he doesn't say \"I love you\" enough. He retorts that she knows he loves her, he will tell her if that changes, and therefore he doesn't need to say it. She doesn't accept this: <em>she</em> needs to hear it, it's not about <em>his</em> need. He moans and says \"if I say it, will it make you happy?\" and when she affirms, he grumpily (with a smirk) says \"fine, <em>I love you</em>, now will you let me read my newspaper?\". She is indeed happy, even though she would agree he still needs to keep working on his <em>kavana</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYOkNh2IFCM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here is a short shiur</a> that discusses this, and you can find several others on this channel. Rabbi Friedman is a great teacher of Chabad Chassidus, whose Rebbeim have <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/two-centuries-after-the-death-of-its-founder-chabad-launches-year-long-celebration-with-reissue-of-his-works/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">made it their mission</a> to bring down the <a href=\"https://www.inner.org/baal-shem-tov/letter.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">teachings of the Besht to every day life</a>, and this answer is an introduction to how they <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zmEU79hUVA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">teach their chassidim to daven</a>, and something that has improved my tefilla service greatly upon learning (I am not a Chabad chassid).</p>\n<p><sup>* Note, I would say that the appendix on the word \"Baruch\" would be hard to fit with the teaching of the Besht you are bringing without a fuller explanation, and therefore please bear in mind that there are opinions that either oppose or clarify what is explained there.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

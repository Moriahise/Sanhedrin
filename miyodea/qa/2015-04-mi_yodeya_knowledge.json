One example is <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=19&daf=50&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gitten 49b-50a</a> where Mar Zutra makes a statement that when the Mishna says that when land is foreclosed on to collect a Kesuba the land taken from the least valuable-per-acre land (Ziburis) it is only referring to if the husband dies and she is collecting from the heirs. If, however, he divorced her and she is collecting from his property, she gets the mid-valuable land (Beinonis).</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud goes back and forth on various potential Braisos which potentially contradict this, and finally Ravina concludes with a Briasa which unambigiously does, thus Mar Zutra's opinion is rejected.</p>\n\n<p>This is one of many examples where when a Tanna is found to have said something in contradiction, the Amora's opinion becomes inoperative.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Steinzaltz discusses <a href=\"http://steinsaltz.org/learning.php?pg=daf_yomi&articleId=1942\" rel=\"nofollow\">this rule</a> - and parenthetically gives the reason that Tannaim had access to reliable Mesorah that the Amoraim didn't - and notes a quazi in-between exception, that of Rav, who was the first generation Amora.

A) Inculcating and maintaining a healthy respect for Jewish works, including rabbinic ones. B) Inculcating and maintaining a willingness to think and question.</p>\n\n<p>The former may scare us from telling an impressionable youth that something in print as a Jewish source isn't to be taken literally. However, this risks the latter; the scenario described in the question in which an honest youth without malevolent intent is made to feel inferior for thinking.</p>\n\n<p>The two considerations seem mutually exclusive to a degree.  That being the case I would be tempted to just tell them the truth. Besides for avoiding the all to common case of honest youth feeling prohibited from thinking, you salvage a bit of the first concern as well, for although their respect for a particular source may diminish, their respect for the the system of rabbinic Judaism as whole will in all likelihood increase.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it is only by raising the stakes and putting every rabbinic word of pedestal of literal infallible truth, that such conflicts and \"kofer calls\" result. If one tells a child that we are meant to learn something deeper from the midrash, etc. and praises him for noting the difficulties with the straightforward interpretation (a balance between adherence to literal truth and rejection entirely) then he wont have reason to lose respect for even that individual source, let alone all of rabbinic Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>The only problem with this; the last consideration, is that while one controls what he teaches his child, he doesn't control what his child will be exposed to. Thus teaching a child that its okay to consider that a seemingly fantastic midrash may have a different intent may be the best from an objective perspective, but it wont lessen the \"kofer calls\" that he will be exposed to.\nThus perhaps it is wise to wait until a child is capable of differentiating between his views and others views, that is maintaining a more \"rational\" for lack of a better term mindset while being mature enough not to squabble with others over it.\nUltimately the balance of these concerns is a \"shiqul hadaas\" that can only be made individually.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>I have cited no sources, but as the question seemed to seek personal advice for dealing with a problem that isn't black and white, I think that presenting possible concern and a suggested course of action is appropriate.</p>\n\n\n",

The prohibition of a <em>shomeres yavam</em> to marry outside of her <em>zikah</em> to <em>Yibbum</em> (יבמה לשוק) is similarly based on the same idea - she still has a residual relationship to her deceased husband which prevents her from marrying anyone else until it is addressed through either <em>Yibbum</em> or <em>Chalizta</em>. (There are some Rashis near the beginning of Kesubos which hint at such an idea.)</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, the question can be addressed as follows:  once he has performed <em>Chalitza</em>, he has essentially severed the relationship, and the prohibition of <em>Eishes Ach</em>, marrying his brother's wife, which was only suspended (or never started, but let's not get into that) for the sake of the <em>mitzvah</em> of Yibbum, sets in, and he can no longer marry her once the relationship with the deceased brother is severed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm going to build an idea off of the Netziv on that passuk, so I'll mention his point first. \n He mentions the idea that yibbum has to do with neshamos like the Ramban says in Vayeishev, but then goes on to say a different pshat. That taking off ones shoe is symbolic of removing the teva of the body and natural order in order to single oneself out for Hashem, as he writes in Shmos 3 5 as well. However, there, the point is to be a constant Merkava for the Shekhina, no regular Jew is expected to be on this level. But at the moment an opportunity to perform a mitzvah is presented, and its not possible to do it without first 'removing the teva', and this is the shoe, this is a mitzvah And requirement to do at that moment, and the mitzvah will supersede the teva of his body. But the Yavam can't 'take his shoe off instantaneously', as we see he doesn't want to be miyavem her for a wife. Therefore the Yavama takes the shoe off his foot, as if saying you were not able to take off your shoe.</p>\n\n<p>Basing myself on this I would say once the Yavam dropped the ball and couldn't live up to that moment of mi laHashem eilai, it's too late. Doing something purely for the sake of Hashem can't be mulled over and thought about till he decides it's worthwhile. </p>\n\n<p>Another idea is that Yibum is described as an honor for the dead brother, so that his name won't be erased from Yisroel. At that moment when the Yavam said no and went through the Chalitzah process, he already disgraced his brother's memory. There is no fixing that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Not to negate the halachic-mechanics answer (which I like), but I think there's psychology at play here as well. At a simpler level, all rights in Judaism are tied to obligations, and it's just not fair to leave people hanging. Here's this widow, trying to figure out what to do with her life now. It's either going to be \"the brother will step up and do the right thing\", or \"he's not, so spit at him, then make a clean break and walk away from that family and start a new chapter.\" The brother needs to make a serious, one-time-and-this-is-final decision. </p>\n\n<p>Recall that if the living brother does marry the widow, he becomes the heir to the deceased's estate as well. So suppose the living brother isn't super-mature or considerate. Right now he looks at his sister-in-law and thinks, <em>\"Hm ... I'm hot stuff, she's a Size 2, I bet I can find a Size 0 lady out there  ...\"</em>, so he does <em>chalitza</em> and drives off into the sunset in his flashy sports car. </p>\n\n<p><em>Then</em>, a few years later, he needs to pay for Botox, a hair transplant, and alimony from that Size 0 relationship that didn't work out (or worse, he's still married to Size 0 lady and wants an extra wife to bring in more money) -- and suddenly his dead brother's bank account looks quite attractive! So he calls up his brother's widow. \"<em>Hey, Shprintza ... remember me? Oh you're still single? That's fantasti!--umm, so sorry to hear that ... but you know ...  we really ought to do the right thing for the memory of my dear brother and your dear husband, God rest his soul...</em>\"</p>\n\n\n",

The word לְמִינֵהוּ closely resembles the hypothetical way of expressing \"to its kind\" or \"to its species\" in Proto-Semitic (P.S.).  Here, the Tsere vowel underneath the nun indicates that the word מִין (\"species\", \"kind\") is in the genitive case.  Hence it should be clear that the form לְמִינֵהוּ is archaic and closely resembles what the P.S. would have been.  The form לְמִינוֹ is the more typical form we would expect to see according to the grammatical rules of Biblical Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>An analysis of the frequency of occurrences for לְמִינוֹ and לְמִינֵהוּ is revealing.  The word לְמִינוֹ occurs only 4 times in Tanach, with all occurrences being in the Torah.  Only once does לְמִינוֹ appear in Genesis 1:11, with the other 3 occurrences being in Leviticus (11:15, 11:22), and Deuteronomy (14:14).  The word לְמִינֵהוּ also exclusively appears 14 times in the Torah.  However, it appears 8 times in Genesis as well as 6 times elsewhere in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>I would argue that the book of Genesis has a preference for using the more archaic form לְמִינֵהוּ over the more modern form לְמִינוֹ.  In later books (Leviticus and Deuteronomy), both forms occur with a more equal frequency.  If we assume that the composition of Genesis and Leviticus are separated by 1000-2000 years, then it is possible that earlier variants of the Hebrew language were preferred in Genesis over the other books of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think this is the correct answer. I have not seen the ksav v'kabala'.\nRashi says that even though they dont look the same and have different names they can still be the same species. But they must have something in common.\nThe translation of \"lmino\" or \"lmino\" is his or her species, depending if its masculine or feminine. The translation of \"lminaihu\" is like \"lmin oisoi\" to the same type of species but not his/her species.  Like \"yochluhu\" \"yochlu oiso\".\nBest to give an example. Israel is a country, Yerashalaim is the same \"species\" and so is Tel Aviv. You could say the species is called Israel and these are its sub-species. Like \"b'haimo\" which uses the word \"lmino\", her species, for an ox and a sheep. Although they dont look the same or have the same name, they do have something in common. \nWhereas one cant say Tel Aviv is a species of Yerusholaim. But one can say it is the \"same type of  species\" using the word \"lminaihu\". \nSo \"arbe\" is a collective noun like \"b'haimo\", whereas \"solom\" isnt. So the torah is saying that anything which is the same \"type\" of species as \"solom\" is included. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Is there really a question?\nA simple idea by example (from ornithology, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine\" rel=\"nofollow\">passerines</a>). crow --> an Order, Crow and his specie (corvus albicolis, corvus corax, etc).\nPasserine birds with many suborders (למינהו) as suborder passery, infraorder corvida<br></p>\n\n<h3>An order that has not suborders --> למינו</h3>\n\n<h3>An order that has suborders --> למינהו</h3>\n\n<p>Arbe is one order without suborders<br> Sal'am is an order with suborders.\n<br> Additionnal remark, the word סוג is introduced by Yehuda Ibn Tibbon and is not used as super species or super order in Tora and Chazal.

Rather it was imbued with new meaning as the sign of the covenant.</li>\n<li>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachmanides\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>, writes (commentary to Genesis 9:12) that although the simple reading of the verses indicates it was a new phenomenon, we are forced to accept the conclusion of the Greeks that rainbows are a natural phenomenon based on light shining on the sky, as this phenomenon can be observed when light shines on a container of water. He notes that a preexisting phenomenon can serve as a sign for future events, as in the mound of rocks (Genesis 31:52).</li>\n<li>Additionally, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_ben_Moses_Arama\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Arama</a> writes in his <em>Akedat Yitshak</em> (Parshat Noah: Sha'ar 14) that Ramban who is well known as one the greatest believers, nevertheless concluded, on the basis of Greek arguments that the rainbow is a natural, and hence preexisting phenomenon. He uses this to demonstrate the lesson that the Torah is tarnished when one provides forced explanations for it, and Ramban shows us the proper path.</li>\n<li><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_ben_Elijah_Ashkenazi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliezer Ashkenazi</a> cites Ramban in his Torah commentary <em>Ma'asei Hashem</em> (Ma'asei B'reshit: ch. 28) that the rainbow was a preexisting phenomenon. He explains that specific meteorological conditions are necessary to sustain it. After the deluge, that specific combination of meteorological factors may be deliberately chosen by God to convey a message, whereas before they would have been random. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Zemah_Duran\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbats</a> writes pretty much the same thing in his commentary to Avot (5:6).</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> (Commentary to Genesis 9:13) also agrees with Rav Saadya Gaon that rainbows were a preexisting phenomenon; the result of rays of light shining towards clouds, but explains that the phenomenon was exaggerated by greater sunlight after the great deluge, leading to more dramatic rainbows.</p></li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nethanel_ben_Isaiah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maor Ha'afelah</a> (Parashat Noah Parashat HaKeshet) quoted by the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%A9_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash HaBeiur</a> (Genesis 9:13) also agrees with Rav Saadya Gaon.</p></li>\n<li><p>Ibn Ezra (ibid) references Rav Saadya, but disagrees and explains that it was a new phenomenon. However, he writes (ibid: 14) that if one accepts the Greek explanation of the rainbow, then one would have to say that after the deluge the sun's intensity increased. He seems to imply that the less intense sun was insufficient to produce rainbows at all. </p></li>\n<li>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abravanel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Abravanel</a> writes (commentary to Parshat Noah ch. 8: question 15) that Ibn Ezra is correct, and that it was a new phenomenon.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bahya_ben_Asher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Bahya ben Asher</a> (Commentary to Genesis 9:13) suggests both possibilities; that it was a preexisting phenomenon, or that is was a new phenomenon.</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_of_Gerona\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran</a> compromises between the two approaches, in his Torah commentary (9:12-17) He writes that the phenomenon of rainbows wasn't new, but their placement: in clouds or the sky, rather than exclusively in empty sky, was new.</p></li>\n<li><p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Isaac Caro</a> (the uncle of R. Yosef Caro, author of the Shulhan Arukh) repeats this compromise of Ran in his Torah commentary <em>Tol'dot Yitshak</em> (9:13); that the rainbows moved from the empty sky to clouds.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>To summarize:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did the rainbow exist as we know today, prior to the Mabul?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes. According to Rav Sa'adya Gaon, Ramban, Ralbag, <em>Akedat Yitshak</em>, Maor Ha'afelah, the Midrash HaBeiur Rashbats, R. Eliezer Ashkenazi, and one possibility of R. Bahya.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did it exist in a different form before the deluge?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes. According to Radak, Ran, and R. Isaac Caro.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Did it not exist at all prior to the Mabul?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yes. According to Ibn Ezra, R. Isaac Abravanel, and one possibility of R. Bahya.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Lastly, the Mishna (Avot 5:12) states that the rainbow was created during the twilight following the sixth day of creation. Which of the above approaches this supports, can be debated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch writes on Noach 9:12</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is by no means <strong>necessary</strong> to assume that hitherto there had been\n  no rainbow and to place it in connection with the atmospheric changes\n  which occurred after the Flood. Just as Hashem showed Avraham the\n  starry heavens and said, כה יהיה זרעך, as He showed Moshe and Aharon\n  the new moon, and with the words החדש הזה לכם consecrated this monthly\n  phenomenon - which, of course, had been in existence since the\n  beginning of the world - to be a sign of physical and moral\n  rejuvenation for Israel; as existing seasons and dates became memorials\n  for historical and instructive remembrance for Israel, so the rainbow\n  <strong>can also have been</strong> a well-known phenomen in the sky, and now became designated by\n  Hashem to be a sign of His covenant with Man and\n  the world. The נתתי <strong>can</strong> therefore quite literally be: My bow, I have\n  long ago placed it in the clouds, <strong>henceforth</strong> it shall serve as a\n  sign of the covenant between Me and you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This means that it is quite possible (as many meforshim say) that the atmosphere had been saturated until now, and as a result rainbows had not yet been a \"normal\" weather phenomenon. As an example, in Bereishis, we see that the garden was watered by a mist rather than falling rain. Now that the water had all fallen to cause the Mabul, it became a normal occurrance. However, as Rav Hirsch points out, this does not <strong>have</strong> to be true and the pasuk can be learned either way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Ramban (Chapter 9, Verse 12) argues that the rainbow existed before the Mabul. However, only after the Mabul did Hashem select it to serve as a sign of His covenant to not cause another Mabul.  The rainbow is a reversed bow.  One who wishes to indicate peaceful intentions reverses his weapon away from the person he is greeting and points the weapon towards himself.  So too, the rainbow faces away from humanity and towards the heavens.  This demonstrates that Hashem will not use the weapon of water to destroy the Earth.</p>\n\n<p>Malbim (Chapter 9, Verse 13) argues that the rainbow did not exist before the Mabul.  In the pre-Mabul world it rained infrequently.  But when it occurred the rain fell in a deluge. There was no opportunity for a rainbow to form.  Only after the vigor of the material world was diminished did it become possible for a rainbow to form.  The rainbow is the perfect symbol of Hashem’s commitment to not causes another Mabul.  It represents the cessation of rain and the reduced vigor of the material world.  It communicates the reason that another Mabul will not be necessary.</p>\n\n\n",

Studies have shown that e-cigarette emissions can include potentially toxic levels of formaldehyde, arsenic, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273096\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">benzene</a>, chromium, manganese, nickel, lead, zinc, and diacetyl, etc. Even though some of the ingredients in e-juice have been designated as safe when consumed at room temperature, when they are heated by a metal coil they produce toxic substances that are potentially dangerous. These findings have been discussed in many recent news columns including <a href=\"https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/321006.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medical News Today</a>, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/vaping-news-lead-arsenic-and-other-toxins-inhaled-when-smoking-e-cigarettes-818733\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Newsweek</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/opinion/formaldehyde-diacetyl-e-cigs.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The New York Times</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Stein goes on to cite more studies that seem to show that prolonged inhalation of these toxins can lead to an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory distress.</p>\n<h3>Thus:</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even though the precise long-term effects of regular e-cigarette use remains largely undefined, since it involves the frequent inhalation of known toxins, <strong>Rav Hershel Schachter</strong> shlit\"a and <strong>Rav Mordechai Willig</strong> shlit\"a believe that <strong>there is already ample basis to assert that the use of e-cigarettes by non-smokers should provisionally be forbidden by virtue of the prohibition against self-endangerment</strong> found in the pasuk \"And you shall watch yourselves very well,\" pending the collection of definitive data.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>2) Kashrus Issues:</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Often one of the core ingredients in the e-liquid is glycerin, a clear, odorless liquid with a thick consistency and sweet taste... Glycerin can be derived from vegetable oils or animal fats and they are used interchangeably. <strong>Therefore, a food product containing glycerin typically requires kashrus supervision</strong> despite the insistence of the manufacturer that it uses strictly vegetable glycerin.

This is expressed in the ability of intelligent\n  speech. True, animals can communicate and have intelligence but it is\n  only a \"practical intelligence\". They are not able to think\n  abstractly, to hold a thought, ponder it and deliberate on it\n  abstractly. It is because of this that one cannot have an intelligent\n  conversation with animals, not even in sign language. Sure you can\n  communicate a bit but you cannot have an intelligent communication\n  like with a human personality. You cannot ask him what he did\n  yesterday, what does he think about this or that, for that requires a\n  higher level of intelligence, an intelligent personality - and this\n  animals do not have.</p>\n  \n  <p>The consequence of this is something called free will. Free will does\n  not mean the ability to make decisions. Animals can also do that. Free\n  will means the ability to make moral decisions. For example, the\n  animal wants to eat, sleep, kick - and does it. So too, a man wants to\n  eat, sleep, etc. and does it. But man's free will is that he has the\n  ability to <strong>refrain</strong> from doing what he wants. To refrain from what his\n  nature wants him to do. This is the difference (Rabbi Matityahu\n  Solomon Matnas Chelko commentary to shaar bitachon). The animal is for\n  the most part compelled by its nature. Man has the ability to rise\n  above his base nature and act morally against the wishes of his lower,\n  animal self. This is free will. Animals have a form of intelligence\n  but man alone can be rational and deduce his moral obligations. Man\n  can hold a thought, contemplate it, analyze it and make a thought-out\n  decision. Man has an abstract thought intelligence, while animals only\n  have a practical intelligence. Therefore they are essentially ruled\n  over by passion and instinct. Theoretically, one can predict\n  everything that an animal will do throughout its life. An animal is\n  basically a machine. While for a man it is impossible to predict what\n  he will do. He himself does not know what he will choose. Therefore\n  man is a rational creature while animals are irrational.

    "title": "Yeshayahu 45:7 Does Rah exist because of the absense of Tov?",
    "content": "# Yeshayahu 45:7 Does Rah exist because of the absense of Tov?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Question:\nIn my own words based on some commentary of Rabbi Hirsch Yeshayahu 45:7 reads: I form ohr (light), and create choshech (darkness); I make shalom (that what is whole), and create rah (that what causes division); I Hashem worketh all these things. </p>\n\n<p>The antonym of light seems to be darkness, the antonym of shalom might be in this case rah. But in Bereshit it is said that the antonym of rah is tov. Are shalom and tov synonyms somehow? The Maharal in many places describes tov in terms of existence, and rah in terms of absence. Likewise I read that tov could be determined as functional and rah as disfunctional.  </p>\n\n<p>Did HaShem created rah as in 'He did made it directly', or did He not made it, but was it created by making shalom or that what we call tov (so that it could exist and HaShem adventually could be called the Creator of it)? Like darkness exist because of the abcense of light, and cold exist because the abcense of warmth.. could rah be the abcense of tov? Like Albert Einstein once said to a professor?</p>\n\n<p>Choshech seemed to be there already when HaShem called the light.. how do I need to understand this? And how is it paralleled with the shalom and rah part of this verse?</p>\n\n<p>What is rah, and how and when was it created?</p>\n\n<p>Please help me out with these questions,\nJ.Levi</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Part 1: Tov can mean complete:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Onkelos</strong> to the verse לא טוב היות האדם לבדו translates טוב as תקין - prepared or set up.  Man is not complete when he is alone.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Torah describes (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863#v=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 2:2</a>) that when Moshe was born, his mother saw that he was טוב.  One understanding of the Medrash (Tanchuma 58:5) is that she saw that he was born circumcised.  I think the Medrash sees his being טוב as meaning that he was finished and completed, and therefor concludes that he was born circumcised, as in his physical body was already complete.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Medrash (Bereishis Rabba 4:6) says that it does not say טוב on the second day, because the work of that day was <em>incomplete</em> - טוב implies complete, and something lacking completion lacks טוב.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since you are accepting <em>shalom</em> to mean \"that which is whole,\" I think we can see how they would be closely related concepts.</p>\n<p>Part 2: Indirect creation of \"Rah\"</p>\n<p>Daas Tevunos 104 - 108:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר השכל - שתים אומר לך, א' שאין הקב\"ה משפיע רעה, ח\"ו, כי הוא מקור טוב, וממקור טוב לא יצא רע.</p>\n<p>אמרה הנשמה - ואם כן, הרע איך בא? והרי כתיב (ישעיהו מה, ז), \"עושה שלום ובורא רע\".</p>\n<p>אמר השכל - \"בורא רע\" כתיב, ולא \"עושה רע\", לפי שהוא ברא הרע במציאות, שאם לא היה בורא אותו לא היה נמצא, אך אינו עושה אותו בקום ועשה.</p>\n<p>אמרה הנשמה - ואם כן, איך נעשה?</p>\n<p>אמר השכל - קראי כתיבי (תהלים ל, ח) \"ה' ברצונך העמדת להררי עז הסתרת פניך הייתי נבהל\", (תהלים קד, כט), \"תסתיר פניך יבהלון\"; ומשה רבנו ע\"ה כבר אמר (דברים לא, יז), \"והסתרתי פני מהם והיה לאכול\" וגו'. וזה, כי הטוב - הקב\"ה עושה אותו ממש בשפעו הטוב, אבל הרע אינו אלא העדר שפעו וביטולו, אם מעט ואם הרבה. כי השפע הטוב בא בכל תיקון המצטרך לטובת הנשפע, ואם יבטל ויעדר השפע לגמרי - זה יהיה ביטול לנשפע, ביטול גמור, אך אם השפע לא יבטל לגמרי, אך מתנאי שלמותו יתבטלו ויעדרו - יהיה החסרון בנשפע, ולא ביטול גמור</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Short summary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שכל - Evil does not emanate from Hashem, as He is the source of good, and evil does not come from the source of good</p>\n<p>נשמה - If so, how did evil come into being?  The verse (Yeshaya 45:7) says: \"I make shalom and I create rah\" !</p>\n<p>שכל - <strong>It says \"[I] create rah,\" not \"[I] do rah.\"</strong> He created the existence of evil, as if He didn't create it it wouldn't exist.  But He does not actively <em>make</em> evil.</p>\n<p>נשמה - If so, how is it made?</p>\n<p>שכל - (paraphrasing) Many verses describe Hashem \"hiding\" His \"face.\"  The meaning is, that with regards to tov, Hashem directly makes it.  But evil is nothing more than the withholding of the emanation and its nullification, be it a lot or a little.  The emanation of tov comes for the necessary preparation for any existence, and if it is nullified or withheld completely, the entity ceases to be, and if it is partially withheld it does not cease to be but it loses some aspects of its completeness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And siman 110:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר השכל - כאשר נדקדק במציאות הדברים, נמצא שאין הרעות אלא הפסדי הטובות עצמם. ואלו נקח כל מיני הטובות שיש במציאות, ונבין גדרם, וכל הרעות ונבין גדרם גם כן, נראה שאין מציאות הרעות אלא הפסדי אותם הטובות עצמם.</p>\n<p>Evil is nothing more than the decomposition of the good itself.  If we take all types of good and all types of bad and understand their definitions, it becomes apparent that the existence of evil is no more than the loss of the good themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In siman 114 the technical aspects of this are explained in more details (I discussed it briefly <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/34685/4794\">here</a>).  But as the Ramchal explains, you were mostly correct in your assessment - evil was created indirectly through making what we call tov and then reducing it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>[<strong>NOTE</strong>: The implications of what is expressed below are vast. It is a central concept in an entire position of <em>hashqafah</em>. As such, it will beg more questions than it answers. However, it is simply not possible in the space of an answer here to express it all adequately - to do so could fill volumes. So, please relate to following as a piece of a much larger whole.]</p>\n\n<p>It is important, first of all, to understand that when the word <em>ra^</em> is used in Hebrew, it is not always indicative of malicious or wicked \"evil\", rather it is used as a general term for all levels of negativity (e.g. \"bad\", \"evil\", \"wrong\", \"trouble\", et al). I make this qualification only to prevent the common misconception that if God is the \"Creator\" of evil, that this necessarily implies that He is the author of cruelty, barbarism, and travesty committed by human being throughout the course of history (<em>has wa-shalom</em>). This, of course, is completely absurd, as it is a foundational principle on which the entire Torah rests that man is endowed with an absolutely free will, without Divine coercion of any kind (cf. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/15n.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Hilkhoth Teshuvah</em> 5:5</a>). As Rebbi ^Aqivah said, \"<em>ha-kol ssafuy wa-reshuth netunah</em> - Everything is foreseen and [yet] free will has been given\" (cf. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/b/h/h49.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Pirqey Avoth</em> 3:18</a>). God is neither responsible nor the source of human choices, good or bad.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in order to not attribute neither outright evil and wickedness (<em>has wa-shalom</em>) nor absurdity to the Creator of All, blessed be He, we must seek an explanation for the seemingly explicit statement made by Yeshayahu HaNavi (45:7) that God is the creator of \"evil\" that accords with both <em>Hazal</em> and the <em>Tanakh</em>.</p>\n\n<p>In the <em>Moreh Nevukhim</em>, the Rambam addresses both the origin(s) of evil and the meaning behind the <em>pasuq</em> in Yeshayahu 45:7. </p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://press.tau.ac.il/perplexed/chapters/chap_3_10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">III:10</a>, the Rambam explains that the meaning of <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1045.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshayahu 45:7</a> [<em>yosser or uvore' hoshekh ^oseh shalom uvore' ra^ ani Adhonoy ^oseh khol eleh</em> - \"Forms light and creates darkness, makes peace and creates evil. I, HaShem, do all these things.\"] is that evil - expressed in connection with the word <em>bore'</em>-\"creates\" - is not a positive existence, but is merely the absence of properties. Therefore, it can only be \"created\" indirectly, like when someone directly extinguishes a lamp and indirectly \"produces\" darkness - the absence of the attribute of light. In the <em>pasuq</em>, light and darkness are used as a comparative metaphor for good and evil, and should probably not be understood as a reference to the original act of creation.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, we can attribute evil to the Creator only in the way that He created a world in which evil could potentially exist and He fashioned mankind with the capacity to commit wrong. However, the reality of evil is that it exists in the negative choices of human beings that fill the \"void\" of free will. </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, I would like to share a personal story.</p>\n\n<p>I once had a discussion with an older [secular] Jewish psychologist about the classic accusation of God: \"Where is He when children suffer?\" Now, any demographic could be inserted to replace \"children\" in that question. After all, suffering is suffering. However, the suffering of innocent children cuts directly to the point. This doctor asserted that if God were a truly loving God, then He wouldn't have caused it or allowed it to happen.</p>\n\n<p>My answer to him was another question. Actually, it was a series of questions: \"Where are we? Where is mankind when children suffer? Where are we when we make wars for money? Where are we when we encourage free sexuality and immorality, causing thousands of unwanted children to be born to mothers who will not properly care for them? Where are we when we use chemicals, plastics, radiation, and food additives to feed our people? Where are we when we feed people GMO produce that stock animals refuse to eat when given a choice in trials? Where are we when we pump pollution into the water and air? Is God to blame for all the nonsense that mankind is collectively responsible for when we know better?\" He was silent and then admitted that these were very good questions that he had never thought about before.</p>\n\n<p>As the Rambam explains in volume III of the <em>Moreh Nevukhim</em>, the majority of the evil in the world is man to man and man to himself. Very little comes from above.</p>\n\n<p>And if anyone is tempted to take issue with this understanding of Divine Providence, then I ask them to ask the difficult questions raised by the opposite view: When a frum Beis Yaakov girl is raped while walking home, did God pre-ordain her to be raped and the rapist to commit his disgusting act? Does God starve children? Does God cause men and women to commit adultery through His Divine Will? The answer to all of these questions is an unequivocal \"<strong>NO</strong>\". And if anyone persists in their position that such things are directly caused by God, then I would propose that such a person has never truly been a victim that has had to ask those questions. </p>\n\n<p>HaShem created a good world, He created man with free will, knowledge, and the ability to live on earth in peace. He expects us to do our job. And we will, <em>bi-siyata di-shmaya</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that this helps.

While one might argue that a 'mitzvah gedolah' is not necessarily 'mitzvas talmud torah', it's at least a strong indicator for early sources to such as idea. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the <strong>Maharal</strong> (Gevuros Hashem ch. 62) says that one can even make a bracha on learning without understanding, and perhaps he would differentiate between the written and oral Torah in this regard. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>At the end of Moreh Nevuchim 3:51, the Rambam presents the level one should aspire to in divine service, in which he trains himself to do more than the minimum--one should learn to focus on not only the first pasuk of Shema and the first blessing of Shemoneh Esrei, but throughout. The clear implication is that although one fulfills the mitzvah of Shema and Shemoneh Esrei with kavvanah for the first pasuk and first berachah respectively, the Rambam is discussing the level beyond what is strictly required. If so, when the Rambam continues,  </p>\n\n<p>״וכאשר יצלח בידך הדבר ויתחזק במשך שנים,\n הנהג עצמך אחרי כן שתהא כל זמן שקראת בתורה או שמעת אותה, לא תחדל בכל ישותך ובכל\n מחשבתך מלהתרכז בהבנת מה שאתה שומע או קורא״ </p>\n\n<p>it would seem that here as well the Rambam distinguishes between the basic fulfillment which does not require understanding what one is reading, and the higher level of kavvanah which one should strive to attain. See also the Rambam's continuation, in which he applies this to Nevi'im as well: </p>\n\n<p>וכאשר יעלה בידך זה במשך זמן, תרגיל את עצמך שתהא מחשבתך תמיד\n שלמה בכל מה שאתה קורא משאר דברי הנביאים, ואפילו בכל הברכות, תתכוון בו להבין מה\n שאתה מבטא ולהתבונן בעניינו</p>\n\n<p>As for sources that contradict this notion, see Turei Even Rosh Hashana 28b who explains the Gemara in Berakhot 13a to mean that reading without understanding serves no purpose; the same interpretation is given by the Tzlach  in Berakhot as well as the Nachalat David in Berakhot (citing R.

    "content": "# Tapping on the table for \"שולחן זה שאכלנו עליו\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always assumed that tapping the table as you say \"ועל שולחן זה שאכלנו עליו\" in bentching was something you do in Junior High School.  But I have now seen several full-grown (at least chronologically) adults who do this during bentching.  I still assume that I am correct, and they just never stopped doing it from when they did it in NCSY or something like that, but I figured I'd ask:</p>\n\n<p>Is there any source in the history of Halachic literature that says you should tap the table on which you are eating when you say those words in bentching?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>IMHO this is based upon the concept of \"Zeh\" in the mikra being connected to the principle of \"mareh ba'etzbah\" - see Rashi on \"zeh keli ve'anvehu,\" \"hachodesh hazeh lachem,\" \"ba'avur zeh asah Hashem li,\" etc. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, there is the lechatchilah obligation of being in the same location you ate your meal in. We are indicating our fulfillment of the halacha by being \"mareh ba'etzbah\" that it was this precise table we ate at. </p>\n\n<p>There is no halachic <strong><em>requirement</em></strong> to do so (that I have found), but it is a nice synergy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The practice is not about tapping but either pointing to the table or placing ones hand upon it at that point in the benching. Tapping rhythmically on the table on Shabbat or Yom Tov, could be a prohibited act.</p>\n\n<p>This appears to be an extension of the Minhag Beit HaRav found in the Hagadah shel Pesach of the Lubavitcher Rebbe. In the Hagadah, at the recital of \"matza zo\" and \"maror zeh\", the custom is to actually touch the matza and maror.</p>\n\n<p>One might think that it only applies to the Pesach Seder and those food items, but the Lubavitcher Rebbe discusses in many Chassidic discourses the significance of the word \"zeh\" and relating it to actual pointing with the hand. It is associated with the higher level of \"bittul\"(self-nullification) that was attained by Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n<p>Part of the concept of blessings and requests being answered by G-d is that the one requesting is in a state of self-nullification to the Master of the universe. This is the idea of being a \"kli rekone\", an empty vessel for the blessing. And this is associated with the expression \"zeh\" as in \"Zeh HaShulchan\" found in Birkat HaMazone. This placing ones hand upon the table at that point would appear to be an extension of that practice recorded in the Chabad Hagada.</p>\n\n<p>The Hagada is used as a halachic source in many places.</p>\n\n\n",

In order for something to attain that status of muktze, it usually must be quite valuable (ex. a brit milah knife, etc.) so that the only conceivable thing you could do with the object is either prohibited or just not use it at all. (Shulchan Aruch Siman 308.1)</p>\n\n<p>It appears to me however that it does fit quite well with the definition of a kli shemelachto lissur.  Of course, then you could move the tag if you needed the space it occupies or needed it for a permitted task.</p>\n\n<p>There is a question whether the book becomes a basis due to the tag-and one standard answer would be no because the tag serves the book not vice versa, as such, whenever we move the book, moving the tag should be okay because it is tiltul min hatzad ldavar hamuter.  (See Aruch HaShulchan Siman 309, 5 and 311 21).  The distinction here, is that a book would presumably be a kli shemelachto lheter and now you can move the book to protect it.</p>\n\n<p>But are books muktze?</p>\n\n<p>If we are talking about \"books of wisdom\" (ex. science, philosophy), the Shulchan Aruch brings down a debate (Siman 307 ,17 and 308 50) if we can study from them or move them on Shabbat.  See the Mishna Berura that says in Siman 307 there that we are accustomed to be lenient, (hence it would be a kli shemelachto lheter) but says that for a yira shamayim (a God fearing individual) it is appropriate to be stringent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Even according to those who view lighting and extinguishing incandescent light (and comparable electric devices) to be a violation of mavir and mechabeh or boneh and soser, and, resultingly, the light itself, at least in the unlit state,is muktzeh for lack of a shabbos use, it's hard to think of what would be the problem of using a book that has a passive embedded chip (short of the more general issues of shtarei hedyotos about which the general custom is to be lax).

Based on the actual Jewish sources (e.g. in the Talmud and Rambam), what punishment would a \"Rebbetzin\" who performed Bleigießen, to divine information or cast spells, be liable to (in an age and place in which the Sanhedrin still meted out Biblical and/or Rabbinical punishments, and assuming she fulfilled the requirements of having been halachically warned (<em>hasra'ah</em>) and having been witnessed by two kosher witnesses)? What would be the punishment/liability of one who made use of her services?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I don't think the ability to differentiate rulings for magical practices is simple. See for instance Menachos 65a top Tosafos in the name of Rav Hai Gaon that explains the qualification of 'Baalei Kishaphim' to be on the Sanhedrin, is the knowledge of the craft to know how to rule for real magic verses trickery. There is a similar explenation in the Margolios HaYam on Sanhedrin 17a.</p>\n\n<p>In general real magic in a qualifying situation for punishment in the times of Sanhedrin gets a stoning. Trickery gets Rabbinical lashes. Rambam hilchos Avoda Zara chapter 11 halacha 15. See there Kesef Mishna at length, concerning the Rambams earlier statement that trickery does in fact get Biblical Lashes, his differentiation between the cases would play a part in deciding what this lead pouring trickery would incur, if it is in fact trickery and not real magic or actually allowed.</p>\n\n<p>Last, I would like to point out the practical ruling which pertains to this. The Shulchan Aruch in Yoreh De'ah siman 179 under the prohibition of sorcery says it is not allowed to inquire of astrologers or cast lots. The Ramma adds that the prohibition is from the pasuk תמים תהיה עם ה׳ אלהיך, we must have complete faith in Hashem.\nHe adds and certainly a person cannot inquire of necromancy and witchcraft. The Ramma in the next siff adds that if a person happens to hear his future, he is not allowed to ignore 'his mazal', that would constitute relying on a miracle. However, one shouldn't seek out such information because of תמים תהיה.</p>\n\n<p>The Shach #1 on the Ramma not to inquire of necromancy and witchcraft because of Tamim, says in the name of Maharai, the actual practitioner is doing an issur dioraisa. But if the inquirer is doing this for health reasons, it is allowed, because it is not a real issur, only Tamim. He goes on to quote the Maharshal that even a sick person is not allowed to go to a witch unless it is a life threatening sickness, even if the sickness will cause the loss of an appendage. But, if the sickness came through magic or mikra(?) and ruach ra, it is allowed. The Shach says the Bach at the end of the siman rules the same. </p>\n\n<p>It is possible that sickness which comes from an Ayin Hara might deserve to be on the same list of supernatural diseases which witchcraft is actually allowed to be used to alleviate. </p>\n\n\n",

According to the Sages they are considered as two distinct actions; thus, if you don't replace the bread at the same moment as you remove it, the table will be considered as not having bread during that interval, which would be a violation of the command for it to constantly have bread. According to R. Yosi, though, the replacing is simply the conclusion of the action of removing. Thus, since it is all one process it is considered as if the table had bread constantly —  even during the interval when the technical reality was that the table did <em>not</em> have bread.</p>\n<p>When we apply this back to the case of circumcision, the Sages hold that the parts of the circumcision that do not invalidate it if not performed are considered as distinct actions/processes from the actual necessary components of the circumcision. Thus, if you already stopped doing the circumcision, you have no right to initiate a new violation of Shabbat for something that would not invalidate the circumcision if not performed. However, R. Yosi holds that it's all one process, and what you are doing now is simply the completion of the process of circumcision, and therefore it is still covered under the original Shabbat violation that was permitted for the circumcision in the first place:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה אני מקיים תמיד שלא ילין שלחן בלא לחם ולרבנן אי שקלי ושבקי ליה והדר מסדרי לא מיקרי להו תמיד אלא התחלה אחריתי ונמצא שמתעכב שלחן בלא לחם וגבי פירש נמי כי הדר אתי מילתא אחריתי היא ולרבי יוסי דאמר כי שבקי והדר מתחלי נמי תמיד הוא דחדא מילתא הוא הכא נמי פירש חוזר אע\"פ שאין מעכבין דכולה גמר מילתא היא</p>\n<p>And how do I fulfill \"constant\"? That the table [merely] should not sleep without bread.

I shall list a few ideas mentioned:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Torah itself states two people, namely Ya'akov and Yosef who were embalmed. The embalming process involved \"disemboweling the body and filling the cavity with certain unguents.\" This was allowed because of <em>kavod hamet</em> - respect for the dead body. As it was not possible to bury Ya'akov or Yosef, immediately, embalmoing was a means to preserve the body for burial, later.</p></li>\n<li><blockquote>\n  <p>(Ḥul. 11b) clearly states that an autopsy may be performed on the\n  victim of a murder in order to establish whether he was viable at the\n  time of the assault. Were he not, no charge of murder could be laid\n  against the assailant. This case would come within the framework of\n  permissibility of pikku'aḥ nefesh.</p>\n</blockquote></li>\n<li><p>As @Shokhet alluded in his above comment, Rabbi Ezekiel Landau of Prague ruled that an autopsy may be performed to reveal the cause of death if there is another known person suffering from the same malady that killed the first person. I.e. - if knowledge gained from the autopsy may preserve the life of another person immediately, the autopsy may be performed as this is a also a case of <em>pikuach nefesh</em>. There is a dispute if the autopsy may be perfomed to gain general medical knowledge.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A father changing a minhag - any impact on a grown child?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reading some questions about changing minhagim and I began to wonder -- if I took on my father's minhagim when I grew, and then, later, he changed a minhag because he learned something new, or for some other reason, then do I change my minhag to go along with what he practices now or what I accepted when I was raised?</p>\n\n<p>This assumes that he didn't change because he learned that the previous minhag was in error, or that he moved to a new place so he changed. Let's assume that he and his family had no minhag so he adopted one at a certain point, it became \"his\" that I would take and then later, when he studied more, he adopted a new one.</p>\n\n<p>I'm trying to explore the tension between adopting a father's minhag (which other questions seem to source in the gemara, making it a rather binding notion) and changing a minhag that has been adopted.</p>\n\n<p>Any edits or clarifications to the scenario would be appreciated. I can give more specifics if required but I would like to keep this on the level of the general.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My rosh yeshiva told me that the only minhagim that are binding upon one's children automatically are those adopted by the community. Any minhag that the father accepts upon himself personally does not carry over to his children. According to this, you would not have to keep either the old or the new minhag in this case.</p>\n<p>The context where I was told this will make this more clear. My father grew up without any minhagim, and when he got married he adopted my mother's family's minhagim. At some point I asked about how this applies to me, and was told that I don't have to keep my father's minhagim at all. One specific example that I asked about was how long to wait between meat and milk.</p>\n<p>(I must add that I don't fully understand the rules here, and I don't know why my mother's minhagim are not binding just like a father's minhagim from birth.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I think that the assumption that the minhag has binding force should be challenged.  In general, the adherence to these minhagim causes rifts -- certainly across different groups of Jews (esp. Sephardi vs. Ashkenazi, but also across different sects or versions of Judaism).  Phrased Talmudically, the issue is whether a mere custom which divides the people has binding force.  </p>\n\n<p>[edit] More particularly, I assumed from the question that the minhag in question was \"minor\", in the sense that one's father might change practice without rabbinic consultation or decree.    </p>\n\n<p>With respect to \"major\" minhagim, many rabbinic authorities have ruled that it is permitted (and perhaps even obligatory) to do away with them, particularly if they are  \"foolish customs\".  [EDIT] For example, with regard to the eating of kitnyot on Pesach - a \"major\" minhag, relevant citations for doing away with a \"foolish custom\" include: (see original source here: <a href=\"http://www.schechter.edu/rice-beans-and-kitniyot-on-pesah-are-they-really-forbidden/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Schechter.edu</a> \nMishnah Eruvin 10:10 = BT Eruvin 101b; Ḥullin 6b-7a; Yerushalmi Pesaḥim 4:1, ed. Venice, fol. 30d; Yerushalmi Pesaḥim, ibid., fol. 30c at bottom; Tosafot on Berakhot 48a, s.v. veleit hilkheta; Responsa of the Rambam, ed. Blau, Nos. 308-310, pp. 566-578; Responsa of the Rosh 55:10, and more at the link provided, toward the bottom of the page. </p>\n\n<p>The references above relate to a minhag for which there is uncertainty in the Halacha.  When there is no uncertainty, the weight of the rabbinic opinion is that we are compelled to change the minhag.  Where the issue is minor, all of these arguments apply <em>a fortiori</em>.  [/Edit]</p>\n\n<p>There are excellent reasons to do away with many minhagim: </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>They detract from the joy of holidays and Shabbat by causing angst, annoyance, or friction </li>\n<li>They emphasize the insignificant at the cost to the significant (by definition, these customs are not as significant as the actual mitzvot to which they relate) </li>\n<li>They cause people to scoff at the commandments in general (if this custom has no purpose and is observed, then there is no reason to observe other commandments)</li>\n<li>They cause unnecessary divisions among Jews (and possibly families). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Against these negative outcomes, there is only one reason to observe most minhagim: the desire to preserve a custom.  It seems clear that this desire cannot be dispositive.    </p>\n\n<p>Thus, you are neither obligated to change nor to follow the original custom (though if the question is stand vs. sit, presumably you must choose one or the other or begin to lie down).  In your own life, the minhagim should have no bearing - make up your own mind just as your father will make up his - you too may change a minhag because you learned something, etc.  When in your father's (or anyone else's house), the minhag has no power to affect the mitzvah, so broadly invoke shalom beto, go along with whatever the people do there.  </p>\n\n\n",

However, the Levushei Serad notes that this isn't satisfying as later authorities (eg. Peri Megadim) nearly universally question the Taz's proof. He remains uncertain (צ\"ע) as to the basis of the custom.</p>\n\n<p>R Akiva Eiger to <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x490\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 125</a> quotes the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7946&st=&pgnum=14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nezirut Shimshon</a> who quotes from the Ari who apparently thought that Kabbalisticly one should recite all of the parts of Kedusha along with the Chazzan.

One is that living in the Ghetto is a death-sentence and running away <em>could</em> save one's life, or maybe the Ghetto is \"safe\" (there was no <em>concrete</em> proof that all Jews were going to be killed, and many believed that if they just behave they'll stay alive) and running away is putting oneself in a safek sakana.</p>\n\n<p>To answer this question he quotes the Gemara in Eiruvin which says that when non-Jews come to attack a border city on Shabbos (even if they're only coming for money), we're allowed to fight back since \"lest land will be open in front of them\".

From here he derives that it's even more required for a Jew to put himself in a doubtful danger to save <em>himself</em> from a definite danger.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, as it appeared that there was more danger in staying than running away, one should run away to the forest.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, says R' Oshry</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מעתה לפי דברי המנחת חינוך הרי ברור, שהמלחמה הזאת שהגרמנים\n   הארורים צאצאי עמלק ימ״ש הכריזו על היהודים לאבדם ולהשמידם,\n   בודאי שהחיוב והמצור, מוטלים על היהודים להשיב מלחמה שערה ולהשיב\n   להם כגמולם ולעשות להם כאשר הם זוממים עלינו ומצוה לרדוף אותם באף\n   ולהשמידם מתחת שמי ה׳</p>\n  \n  <p>Now, based on the Minchas Chinuch it's clear, that [in] this war which the cursed Germans, descendants of Amalek, declared on the Jews to plunder and destroy is definitely an obligation on the Jews to  return to their gates and to answer them the way they planned to do to us and it's a mitzva to chase after them and destroy them from under the heavens of Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I am reminded of <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/61921/jewish/He-Could-Melt-A-Blizzard.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this recollection</a> of a visit by Harvey Swados with the Lubavitcher Rebbe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I began ... by asking his opinion of ... of the controversy about the behavior of the German masses and the Jewish leadership, which has tormented the western world ever since, particularly since the appearance of Hannah Arendt's book on the Eichmann trial. ...</p>\n<p>Speaking of the hardship and the anguish undergone by the Jews of Communist Russia, he asked rhetorically: How much more difficult do you suppose it was to keep hold of one's integrity under the crushing weight of the German tyrants, who were so much more efficient than the Russians? No, he said firmly, the miracle was that there was any resistance at all, that there was any organization at all, that there was any leadership at all.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>I was flabbergasted. Here I was, sitting in the study of a scholar of mystic lore late on a wintry night, and discussing not Chabad Hasidism, Aristotelianism or scholasticism but proletarian literature! \"Why,\" I said, \"I would hope that it is less narrowly propagandistic than Sinclair's. I was trying to capture a mood of frustration rather than one of revolution.\"</p>\n<p>Suddenly I realized that he had led me to the answer that he was seeking -- and what was more, with his next query I realized how many steps ahead of my faltering mind: \"You could not conscientiously recommend revolution for your unhappy workers in a free country, or see it as a practical perspective for their leaders. Then how could one demand it from those who were being crushed and destroyed by the Nazis?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a Gentile shovel / plow snow from your driveway on Shabbat if he has been paid for general work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read in Kitzur Shulcah Aruch (<a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_00561.html#HtmpReportNum0169_L5\" rel=\"nofollow\">סימן צ - דין עשית חפציו בלא מלאכה ומלאכה על ידי גוי</a>) that even if a person prepays a Gentile before Shabbat, he cannot tell him to specifically do work for him specifically on Shabbat. There is a rule that a Gentile cannot do work specifically for you without having some benefit for himself.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say you tell the Gentile, \"I am paying you a flat fee for the winter season. Whenever there is a lot of snow, I want you to shovel or plow my driveway.\" It snows on Shabbat. Can the Gentile shovel or plow your driveway in this situation? He gains no personal benefit from shovelling the snow, but, in this case, you did not specifically say that he must come and work on Shabbat, either. He showed up because it happened to snow that day.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I think the Kitzur Shulchan Aruch answers your question in the following paragraphs.</p>\n\n<p>The paragraph you quote says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף י\"ד:</strong> \n  כָּל דָּבָר שֶׁהַיִשְֹרָאֵל אָסוּר לַעֲשׂוֹתוֹ, אָסוּר לוֹמַר לְאֵינוֹ יְהוּדִי לַעֲשׂוֹתוֹ, דַּאֲמִירָה לְאֵינוֹ יְהוּדִי הֲוֵי שְׁבוּת. וַאֲפִלּוּ לִרְמוֹז לוֹ לַעֲשׂוֹתוֹ, אָסוּר. וַאֲפִלּוּ לוֹמַר לוֹ קֹדֶם שַׁבָּת שֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה בַּשַׁבָּת, גַּם כֵּן אָסוּר. וְכֵן אָסוּר לוֹמַר לְאֵינוֹ יְהוּדִי בַּשַׁבָּת שֶׁיַּעֲשֶׂה לְאַחַר שַׁבָּת. וְדָבָר זֶה אֵינוֹ מִשּׁוּם שְׁבוּת, כֵּיוָן דְּהַמְּלָאכָה נַעֲשֵׂית בִּשְׁעַת הֶתֵּר, אֶלָּא אָסוּר מִשּׁוּם מִמְּצוֹא חֶפְצְךָ. וְלָכֵן לְצֹרֶךְ מִצְוָה מֻתָּר (ש\"ו ש\"ז). ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I.e. If you can't do it, you cannot ask the non-Jew to do it, even before Shabbat.</p>\n\n<p>The next paragraph then says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף ט\"ו:</strong> \n  אֲפִלּוּ אִם הַנָּכְרִי בָּא מֵעַצְמוֹ לַעֲשׂוֹת אֵיזֶה מְלָאכָה בִּשְׁבִיל יִשְֹרָאֵל, צָרִיךְ הַיִשְֹרָאֵל לִמְחוֹת בּוֹ. וְלָכֵן אֵינוֹ יְהוּדִי שֶׁרוֹצֶה לְהָסִיר הַפֶּחָם מִנֵּרוֹת שֶׁל יִשְֹרָאֵל כְּדֵי שֶׁיַּדְלִיקוּ יָפֶה, צְרִיכִין לִמְחוֹת בּוֹ. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if the non-Jew comes of his own accord, you have to prevent him from doing anything you are not allowed to do. (All the more so if you actually paid him to come when needed.)</p>\n\n<p>However, as we see in the following paragraph, that if a considerable monetary loss is involved, then one may hint to the non-Jew that he has something to gain by helping you. However, you may not explicitly tell him to do anything you may not do. </p>\n\n<p>So if you risk getting fined - and it's a non-trivial amount -  for not clearing the sidewalk, then it would seem you can pay a non-Jew a flat fee for the winter season, and he will come whenever expected.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>סעיף ט\"ז:</strong> \n  אִם רוֹאֶה אָדָם שֶׁיּוּכַל לָבוֹא לִידֵי הֶפְסֵד, כְּגוֹן שֶׁנִּתְרוֹעֲעָה לוֹ חָבִית שֶׁל יַיִן וְכַדּוֹמֶה, מֻתָּר לִקְרוֹת לְנָכְרִי לְשָׁם, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁיּוֹדֵעַ שֶׁהַנָּכְרִי בְּוַדַּאי יְתַקְּנוֹ, וַאֲפִלּוּ בִּמְלָאכָה גְּמוּרָה, וּבִלְבַד שֶׁיִּזָּהֵר הַיִשְֹרָאֵל שֶׁלֹּא לוֹמַר לוֹ שׁוּם רֶמֶז צִוּוּי לְתַקֵּן. אֲבָל מֻתָּר לוֹמַר לְפָנָיו, כָּל מִי שֶׁיַּצִּיל הֶפְסֵד זֶה, לֹא יַפְסִיד שְׂכָרוֹ. וְאֵין לַעֲשׂוֹת זֹאת אֶלָא בִּמְקוֹם הֶפְסֵד מְרֻבֶּה (ש\"ז). ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>If the shoveling is being done for safety, ie, to make a path for people to walk without slipping, not only is the non-Jew allowed to do so, but the Jew can do so as well.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anybody know where it comes from?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>רַבָּה is written explicitly in the Torah the way we pronounce it in Bereishis 26,14: וַיְהִי לוֹ מִקְנֵה צֹאן וּמִקְנֵה בָקָר וַעֲבֻדָּה <strong>רַבָּה</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Its a name of a place in Samuel  12,27 and Chronicles 1 20,1: נִלְחַ֣מְתִּי בְ<strong>רַבָּ֔ה</strong> גַּם־לָכַ֖דְתִּי אֶת־עִ֥יר הַמָּֽיִם</p>\n\n<p>It is also a name in Yechezkel 5,5: וְנָתַתִּ֤י אֶת־<strong>רַבָּה֙</strong></p>\n\n<p>It is also name of a place/person in Jeremiah 49:3 צְעַקְנָה֮ בְּנ֣וֹת <strong>רַבָּה֒</strong> </p>\n\n<p>But רָבָא is not explicitly written anywhere in tenach so in order to differentiate between the 2 names, the minhag is that we pronounce it with a kometz under the Reish and a komeitz under the beis and then the beis automatically doesn't have a dageish and is pronounced Rovo (ashkenazi) or Rava (sefaradi) which sounds different to Rabo or raba.</p>\n\n<p>These are example of words wich the 2 letters before the end have 2 komeitzs ther is no dageish in the letter before the end:<br>\nBereishis 11,3:<strong>הָבָה</strong> נִלְבְּנָה לְבֵנִים</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis 11,4:<strong>הָבָה</strong> נִבְנֶה לָּנוּ עִיר</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis 11,7: <strong>הָבָה</strong> נֵרְדָה וְנָבְלָה שָׁם שְׂפָתָם</p>\n\n<p>Bereishis 29,21 applies toa noun:וַיֹּאמֶר יַעֲקֹב אֶל <strong>לָבָן</strong> הָבָה אֶת אִשְׁתִּי</p>\n\n<p>And here is a Noun in Melachim 1 15,8וַיִּמְלֹ֛ךְ <strong>אָסָ֥א</strong> בְנ֖וֹ תַּחְתָּֽיו</p>\n\n<p>In Aramaic as well we find the word <strong>הָכָ֑א</strong> (which means here\") many many times where the a kometz under the first letter and a komeitz under the second letter which drops the dageish just like רָבָא</p>\n\n<p>Also <strong>בָּבָא</strong> appears many times which means gate and is a noun has the same rule as רָבָא.</p>\n\n<p>So רָבָא is  grammatically correct without a dageish in the Beis.</p>\n\n\n",

By being wicked -  and encouraging other to do so - we forfeit that chance. Sort of defeats the purpose of having Mashiach come.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Secondly</strong>: We have 613 Mitzvot we are commanded to do. That's our purpose in this world. <em>Making Mashiach come</em> is not one of them - and we are under no obligation to make it happen.</p>\n\n<p>Unless you say that <em>Making Mashiach come</em> is part of the Mitzva of glorifying Hashem's name in this world. By making people wicked you'd be doing the very opposite.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So what does R' Yochanan mean by “אין בן דוד בא, אלא בדור שכולו זכאי, או כולו חייב”?</p>\n\n<p>The answer I like is that the world will be in a state where each person is either good or bad - no more people who are half-half.

Examples of the first category include shaking Lulav, not wearing shatnez, eating matzah on Pesach, etc. Examples of the second category are loving God and fearing God. (See beginning of Hamaspik L'ovdey Hashem of R. Avraham Ben HaRambam). One might assume that members of he former category dont have minimum requirements just as they don't have maximum requirements, but R. Avraham writes (there) that these mitzvos DO have minimum requirements. Presumably the mitzva to love your fellow as yourself is a member of this category.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding this particular mitzva, Rambam (Sefer Hamitzvos shoresh 2) writes that it includes visiting the sick, consoling mourners, and burying the dead. It also includes an implicit prohibition to despise him. (Sefer Hamitzvos neg. 302). Also included are \"bringing in the bride\", escorting guests, eulogizing the dead, gladdening the groom and bride, providing them with meals (Mishne Torah Hil. Avel 14:1) and praising others and concerning oneself with their financial well being (Hil. De'os 6:3) and redeeming them from captivity (Hil. Matnos Aniyim 8:10).</p>\n\n<p>The Orchos Chaim (kibbud av v'em 5) quotes Ri of Corbeille that this includes judging others favorably. Ohel Moed (Shaar Reishis Chochmah Haaruch derech 3 n'siv 4) writes that this also includes bringing peace between man and his fellow.</p>\n\n\n",

R. Idstein, the dean, writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A friend of mine recently related to me a fascinating story about Rav Moshe Feinstein zt”l. Rav Moshe was often asked about the widely accepted practice that boys start learning Gemora with Elu Metzios, dealing with the laws of returning lost items, as opposed to Mesechta Brochos,which many people find to be more useful and practical to everyday life. Rav Moshe explained that since many of the laws of Brochos are not carried out in exact accordance to the stringent halacha (and many rely on legal loopholes due to their specific situations), it is best to begin the study of Talmud with a set of laws that are adhered to always, and as is. In this way we will inculcate from youth the need and necessity to always act in meticulous accord with halacha and to shy away from leniencies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>A Rosh Kollel told me that he was told the reason is because, in the middle of a long debate between Abaye and Rava, we find תרגמא רבא אליבא דאביי, Rava interpreted on behalf of Abaye.

This teaches a fundamental lesson in learning the Talmud, which is full of arguments and disagreements.  The point is not that I should win the argument, but that we should reach the truth.  Children are taught this chapter in order to expose them to that lesson in intellectual integrity and search for truth.</p>\n\n<p>The Rosh Kollel who told me this pointed out that we find the same thing in Sukkah, but we both agreed that factors of simplicity necessary background probably make Elu Metzios the better choice between the two.</p>\n\n\n",

Arcahelogical evidence reveal that Jerusalem was largely destroyed, with the entired walled city being burnt to the ground.  There is some evidence that other areas of Judah were not deported.  However, the temple, which was the center of Jewish religious life, was lost and the Jews were no longer in political power.  The Babylonian captivity lasted for 70 years as prophesized by Jeremiah, and it ended in 538 BCE when Cyrus of Persia issued a general decree allowing exiled people to their lands.</p>\n\n<p>The book of Ezra indicates that when the Jews returned to Israel, Ezra had to reintroduce the Torah to the people (Ezra Chapters 7-10 and Nehemiah Chapter 8).  Many Jewish men had taken wives from the nations.  It also seems clear that most Jews were no longer aware of many of the holidays.  As further evidence of the influence of the captivity, consider that certain names for the months were adopted from Babylonian (e.g. תַּמּוּז , מַרְחֶשְׁוָן).  Tanach also does not make mention that the Jews who had stayed behind had been observant for the two generations of the exile.  Therefore, as all Jews had become largely unobservant during the exile, it seems plausible that the right of semicha could easily have fallen into disuse.  Even if semicha were continued in Bablyon or Judah, the argument could be made that the transfer were invalid since either party may not have been observant (similar to the modern halacha rejecting a reform ordination).</p>\n\n\n",

He criticizes those who blame their (other) sins for tragedies caused by their own actions. He quotes a verse from Mishlei (19:3): \"אולת אדם תסלף דרכו ועל ה׳ יזעף לבו\" - \"The foolishness of a person distorts his path, yet his heart fumes at G-d.\" When a person suffers due to his own carelessness, he has only himself to blame.</p>\n\n<p>This is the general approach.

If the practice had not become to seek out healing, a person would get sick according to his sins and would heal according to Hashem's will.  But they accustomed themselves to treatments, and Hashem left them to the happenstance of nature.  And this is the intent of their saying \"And he shall heal him - from here we learn that permission was given to the doctor to heal\" - they did not say that the patient was given permission to be healed, but since the patient got sick and came to be treated, since he accustomed himself to healing and is not from those whom Hashem is their portion in life, the doctor need not forbid himself from treating him ... and he need not say \"Hashem alone is the Healer of all flesh,\" since they have already accustomed themselves to such.  And therefore when fighting people hit each other, the one who strikes is held responsible for paying the medical costs because the Torah does not make its laws dependent on miracles.  But as Hashem would want us to behave, there is no business with healing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does the ל of לבעבור mean?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9881#v=17\">Shemos 20:17</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויֹּאמֶר משֶׁה אֶל הָעָם אַל תִּירָאוּ כִּי לְבַעֲבוּר נַסּוֹת אֶתְכֶם בָּא הָאֱלֹהִים וּבַעֲבוּר תִּהְיֶה יִרְאָתוֹ עַל פְּנֵיכֶם לְבִלְתִּי תֶחֱטָאוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What does the 8th word in the verse mean?  Generally, בעבור means \"in order to\" or \"for the sake of,\" as it is used in the second clause of this verse (without the prefixed ל).  Adding the ל seems to make it a difficult word to understand.  \"For in order to\"?</p>\n\n<p>What does the ל in this word mean, and how does it change the meaning of the word?  And if it doesn't change the meaning of the word, why is it necessary?</p>\n\n<p>And why the difference between the first and second time it is used in the verse?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Seems like Rav Hirsch is addressing this. He writes on that verse:\n בעבור in the transition to something, in the intention to achieve something. לבעבור for this intention: נסות אתכם So that you prove to yourselves whether you are able to receive God's Torah directly from Him, and inasmuch as you yourselves feel the necessity for an intermediary, you will all the more give the God-sent intermediary your full confidence, and also ובעבור וגו׳ So that the impression of this direct communication should remain with you for all time. </p>\n\n\n",

I have always wondered if that was the intention of the Chofetz Chaim when he wrote it, and there are some things that I have noticed that make me wonder. For example, there are times where he refers to what he wrote a few lines earlier in the same seif, which logically the reader would have seen going straight through. Another thing I have noticed is that the MB does not always give a clear cut psak (see MB 311:3 compared to Be'er Hetev and Aruch Hashulchan there). </p>\n\n<p>Was the MB meant to be learned straight through and to be used for psak Halacha, or is it some time of explanation to help a person navigate the Shulchan Aruch?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah explains his purview in his introduction.* He notes that there are two problems preventing people from properly learning halacha from the Shulchan Aruch:</p>\n\n<p>1) It is almost impossible to understand the Shulchan Aruch on its own without the background from the Tur/Beis Yosef but no one has time to properly go through a sugya in this fashion.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אחת כי השלחן ערוך לבדו בלתי למוד הטור הוא כספר החתום כי הבית יוסף\n  כשסדר השלחן ערוך היה דעתו שילמדו מתחלה את עקרי הדינים ומקוריהם בטור\n  ובית יוסף כדי שיתישב הדין לכל אחד בדעתו בטעמו ונמוקו אך לאשר שבטור\n  ובית יוסף נמצא לפעמים כמה דעות חלוקין בכל דין ודין לכך ערך לפנינו את\n  שלחנו הטהור לידע הלכה למעשה בכל דין ודין אבל לא היה דעתו שנלמד אותו\n  בלחוד כי אין הדין יוכל להתישב היטב בדעת האדם כל זמן שאין יודעו בטעמו\n  ונמוקו וגם על ידי ידיעת הטעמים נפקא מנה כמה פעמים למעשה כי כמה פעמים\n  נתחבר בשלחן ערוך בסעיף אחד דבר שהוא רק לכתחלה ודבר שהוא לעכובא אף\n  בדיעבד גם דבר שהוא מדאורייתא ודבר שהוא מדרבנן ונפקא מנה לענין ספק\n  וכהאי גונא עוד כמה ענינים עצומים בכל סימן וסימן אשר לא יתברר לאדם כי\n  אם על ידי ידיעת טעמיהם וללמד כל דין ודין שבשלחן ערוך במקורו וטעמו מן\n  הטור ובית יוסף יכבד זה בזמננו מאד על האדם כי בעונותינו הרבים נתמעטו\n  הלבבות וגם הטרדות נתגברו מאד אשר אם ירצה האדם בלמוד כזה לידע על נכון\n  סימן אחד בינוני למעשה יצטרך לעמל בו כמה ימים ולפעמים כמה שבועות כמו\n  סימן ל\"ב וכדומה אם לא מי שחננו ה' שיש לו לב רחב ואין לו שום טרדה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2) There are so many differences of opinion among the acharonim subsequent to the Shulchan Aruch that one needs to search through to arrive at a final halachic conclusion, and no one has time to go through each sugya in this fashion either.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>סבה שניה שגרם למעט למוד השלחן ערוך לדעתי הוא מפני שכבד הדבר מאד לידע\n  ממנו הדין למעשה מפני התחלקות רב הדעות המובא באחרונים ואין האדם יודע\n  איך לפנות את עצמו לימין או לשמאל וכאשר ירצה האדם תמיד להחמיר בדבר גם\n  זה איננו דרך כבושה כי פעמים רבות הוא חומרא דאתי לידי קולא עוד ראיתי\n  והתבוננתי כי מעת שלקט וקצר הבאר היטב את דברי הט\"ז ומגן אברהם ועוד\n  מפרשים ותשובות שקדמוהו עד עתה הוא לערך מאה ושלשים שנה ומאותו העת עד\n  עתה רבו כמו רבו כמה גאונים מפרסמים מפרשי השלחן ערוך אליה רבה ומטה\n  יהודא ומאמר מרדכי ורבות כהנה וגם בשערי תשובה לא הובא מהם כי אם מעט\n  מזער באיזה מקומות ובפרט ספר הפרי מגדים אשר הוא ספר נכבד מאד אשר בו\n  מבאר בכל סימן וסימן ענינים מחדשים למעשה ונתפשט הוראותיו בישראל לא נזכר\n  כמעט בכל השערי תשובה כל  כי מפני רבוי ספרי השו\"ת שהיה מטל עליו להעתיק\n  לא העתיק ממפרשי שלחן ערוך המצויין כמעט כלל וסמך על המעין בם גם הרבה\n  והרבה גאונים מפרסמים אשר נתפשט דבריהם בעולם אחר הדפסת השערי תשובה כמו\n  הגאון רבי עקיבא איגר ודרך החיים ומגן גבורים וארצות החיים וכדומה זאת\n  ועוד אחרת ראיתי בעני ועמל ישראל כי עתה כשנצרך האדם לידע איזה דין למעשה\n  שאין מברר היטב בשלחן ערוך הוא מכרח לחפש בכמה וכמה מהאחרונים בפרי מגדים\n  ודרך החיים וחדושי רבי עקיבא איגר וחיי אדם ומחצית השקל ורבות כהנה ואין\n  קץ לעמלו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, the issue is that in order to properly learn Shulchan Aruch you have to also learn everything (slight exaggeration) that came before and after it as well, which is only feasible for a select few individuals.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berurah claims to be the solution to this problem. It will essentially do the work for you. It will provide the necessary background so that you don't have to learn all the pre-Shulchan Aruch stuff, and it will provide a survey of the acharonim, and a conclusion that is apparently based on the consensus of acharonim barring certain other factors (for instance the extra weight of the Gra's opinion or a proof from the rishonim), so that you don't have to learn all the post-Shulchan Aruch stuff. Obviously, this is not absolute and it may vary throughout the Mishnah Berurah – there may well be instances where it doesn't provide all the background or doesn't give a final ruling – but this was the general purpose/goal.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אשר על כן נתעוררתי ונתחזקתי בחסדי השם יתברך לתקן את כל אלה כי עשיתי\n  בעזרת השם יתברך באור מספיק לדעתי על שלחן ערוך הזה עד אחר הלכות תפלה\n  לעת עתה ^ וקראתי שמו משנה ברורה ובו בארתי בעזרת השם יתברך את כל דין\n  ודין שבשלחן ערוך בטעמו ונמוקו מגמרא ופוסקים אשר לא יהיה כספר החתום גם\n  בארתי בו במקום שנמצא דעות בין הפוסקים את מסקנת האחרונים להלכה על כל\n  דין (והבאור ההוא מלוקט מב\"ח ודרישה ופרישה ואליהו רבה ובאור הגר\"א ופרי\n  מגדים וברכי יוסף ומאמר מרדכי ומטה יהודא ונהר שלום ודגול מרבבה ובאר\n  היטב ושערי תשובה ושלחן ערוך של הגר\"ז ולבושי שרד ושלחן שלמה ודרך החיים\n  וחדושי רבי עקיבא איגר וישועת יעקב וחיי אדם ומחצית השקל ומגן גבורים\n  וארצות החיים ורבות כהנה וגם מכמה ספרי שו\"ת   וארצות החיים ורבות כהנה\n  וגם מכמה ספרי שו\"ת) ובשולי היריעה פתחתי שער ושמו שער הציון בו צינתי על\n  כל דבר שבתוך המשנה ברורה כדי לידע מבטן מי יצאו הפנינים האלו ובמקום\n  שראיתי דעות בין שני אחרונים גופא באיזה דבר לא הייתי עצל בדבר מלחפש\n  בכלל ספרי שאר אחרונים לראות אל מי מקדושים דעתם פונה למעשה ובפרט בבאור\n  הגר\"א ז\"ל שהוא אורן של ישראל ויתד שהכל תלוי בו וכדאי להכריע הדבר גם\n  חפשתי בספרי ראשונים אולי אמצא בם הדבר מפרש או שאר ראיה ברורה כי ברוך\n  השם יש לי הרבה ספרי ראשונים</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That being said, there doesn't seem to be any reason why its use should be limited to either learning straight through, or to helping you understand a particular part of the Shulchan Aruch. If you are learning straight through then the \"final ruling\" part might be more useful to you, while if you are seeking clarification on a specific issue the \"background explanation\" part might be more useful. The fact that it might refer back to something recently stated does not indicate that it was not meant to be read straight through; it merely helps someone who hasn't read it straight through (or forgot something even so recent).</p>\n\n<p>*Also explained in brief on the title page.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone know what this process is and what the general opinion in the kashrus world is about such things?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The CRC says <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cRcKosher/status/390505879004393474\" rel=\"nofollow\">in a tweet</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he way the berries are processed is sufficient to clean them, as opposed to other frozen products</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The CRC generally states the things that a consensus position between themselves, the OK, the OU, the Kof-K and the Star-K (there may be outliers among that group for any given position, but most of them will agree to the position, or at least accept products from each other that conform to that position). However the OK's <a href=\"http://www.ok.org/assets/files/OK_Veggie_Checking_Guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vegetable Checking Guide</a> only permits frozen raspberries if they are pureed by the user after a cursory check (described there).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/211977/halachically-speaking-fruit-smoothies-yogurts.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">This volume</a> of Halachically speaking agrees with the OK (that raspberries need to be purred to be used) and provides reasoning for it. From the reasoning described there, the process involved is a government required washing. It depends on if, immediately prior to the freezing, after the government required washing, the bugs were a Miyut HaMatzui - a commonly found minority, or if they were Eino Matzui - not commonly found. Halachically speaking agrees about strawberries, for example, that the washing is sufficient, but regarding raspberries it says the washing is insufficient to remove it from that category.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that the CRC position is about how effective the washing prior to freezing is at removing bugs, and they think it is sufficient.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not sure why freezing fruit would cause insects to disintegrate. The fruit is flash frozen to prevent the cell walls bursting which should similarly preserve the insects.</p>\n\n<p>Some frozen fruit and vegetables are pressure sprayed to remove insects. For example although thrips are commonly found between maize kernels on the cob, most poskim permit frozen corn due to pressure spraying.</p>\n\n<p>The pressure that can be used depends on how hard the fruit or vegetable is, though. With lower pressure spraying you reduce the probability of eliminating all insects, but it could become a miut she'eino matzuy.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Possibility of buying treyf meat in a kosher store\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since meat may be sold to a consumer before kashering and traiboring, it is possible that parts of meat obtained from a kosher store may not be kosher.*  Ordinarily, one could guess whether the meat has been kashered/traibored according to the state in which it is sold. (That is, one assumes that a whole, fresh animal carcass is presumably not kashered/traibored, whereas a butchered cut probably is.) </p>\n\n<p>However, since there is the flexibility to sell both kinds of meat in the store, does this mean we cannot assume, say, that a package labeled \"beef fat\" contains meat free of chailev?</p>\n\n<p>*(Not theoretically, abstractly possible--but literally, by definition.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't really know what the situation in other countries in, but for a very long time, the only meat sold in stores in America has been soaked and salted. Even if a kosher-labelled piece of meat has not been salted properly, it's בטל ברוב, as the overwhelming majority of meat is completely kosher.</p>\n\n<p>...you used the word \"treyf,\" by which you probably meant the colloquial sense of \"not salted.\" If you meant to say that the animal was technically \"treyf,\" or not kosher due to some physical problem (certain kinds of broken leg, tear in the lung etc.), we'd also assume that it's probably fine, because every animal that leaves a slaughterhouse in America has been checked (quickly, but checked), and if something is missed, then it's also בטל ברוב.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are some really treyf pieces of meat that get through to the consumer. Most of the time you won't be able to tell, however, and can thus rely on the ביטול ברוב. All the same, there are certain problems that you can recognize in your store-bought chicken. The ones that you can find in poultry have been described by Rabbi Yisroel Belsky in an octapartite <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-news/new-ou-kosher-dvd-explains-whats-wrong-with-this-chicken/\" rel=\"nofollow\">video series</a> (named, aptly, \"What's Wrong with this Chicken?\" ;) that you can buy from the OU. (<em>I haven't checked, but I'm fairly certain that these videos can be found on Youtube as well. Search for \"Belsky what's wrong with this chicken\"</em>)</p>\n\n<p>(<em>I threw out a chicken leg last night for having a problematic bruise, the kind of which was described in those videos. It's rare, but it happens...and most people don't realize it.</em>)</p>\n\n\n",

We'll discuss kusmin in a\n  future post, but now I'd like to deal with shibolet shual and shifon\n  (or shipon, more on that in a bit.) In modern Hebrew, shibolet shual\n  means \"oats\" (although \"kvaker\" is the common term), and shifon means\n  \"rye\". This goes as far back as Rashi, who identifies them as such in\n  his commentary (Pesachim 35a). However, many modern scholars disagree\n  with this approach, such as Immanuel Low, who writes that shibolet\n  shual is millet, and shifon is oats (both Jastrow and Ben Yehuda\n  mention this approach), and more recently Yehuda Feliks, who says that\n  shibolet shual is \"two-rowed barley\" (compared to the four and six\n  rowed barley for seorim) and shifon is spelt (which in modern Hebrew\n  is kusmin). Feliks gives a number of reasons for his conclusions -\n  primary among them is that oats and rye were not commonly grown in the\n  Land of Israel at the time of the mishna (this post does a good job of\n  summarizing his arguments and those that disagree with him, on the\n  identity of shibolet shu'al).</p>\n  \n  <p>Most of the proofs are based on biological or historical evidence -\n  but I did find one etymological aspect: while many claim that the name\n  \"shibolet shual\" comes the spike, shibolet, of plant looking like the\n  tail of a fox, shual, (and we find the phrase \"foxtail\" with a similar\n  meaning in English), Feliks believes that the name comes from the fact\n  that foxes like eating the softer two-rowed barley more than other\n  grains, in the same way that invei shual  ענבי שועל - \"blackcurrants\"\n  (literally \"fox grapes\") are so called because foxes enjoy eating\n  them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I like the explanation in the last paragraph, as I was curious about the use of the word \"shu'al\" which means \"fox\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the Artscroll Mishnayos on Kilayim 1:1, besides bringing the opinion from Y.

There are also differing approaches to minhag. Some poskim (e.g. Aruch Hashulchan nad R.

For example, one Rishon might answer a contradiction by making a certain אוקימתא or establishing that the Halacha is so only in a specific case, while other rishonim will reject a Gemara from being definitive in light of another and not be compelled to resolve the contradiction to make both gemaras fit with Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>Another possible reason for a dispute can be found in logic and when to apply certain concepts or whether to derive one Halacha from another (מדמה מילתא למילתא).

First, it seems he is convinced that he really didn't do anything wrong, because he starts by saying that he DID listen to G-d's command. He also says, \"I have destroyed the Amalekites.\" No, not really, because he kept the king alive! That's not destroying ALL the Amelikites.. Is it not obvious in Sha'ul's own words that he is contradicting himself? And, was Sha'ul so clueless as to argue with Shmu'el, a prophet, who is relaying G-d's word, and who even explained to him before the battle, what to do?</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, he seems to blame the taking of the sheep on the people, as it was the people's fault!</p>\n\n<p>I'm a bit puzzled as to what Sha'ul was thinking. Did he think he really did nothing wrong at all, or was he so weak at the least minute that the people pressured him into taking the best of the sheep and cattle to offer sacrifices that this action alone blinded Sha'ul into thinking that this was the right thing to do? Essentially, what factors caused Sha'ul to forget what Shmu'el and G-d commanded him to do? Was it more his own personal blindness to the problem or being pressured by the people?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on the <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01883.html#HtmpReportNum0014_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim's explanation</a> to this chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Shaul and Shmuel were looking at this campaign from different angles.</p>\n\n<p>Shmuel- based on Hashem's command - had in mind to destroy Amalek totally and wipe out all traces of them. This was a punishment for Amalek attacking the Jews while they were in the desert for no other reason than to prove that Gcd couldn't protect them. I.e. Blasphemy. Now that there was a king that everybody revered, it was time to do this Mitzva.</p>\n\n<p>Shaul understood that this entire campaign was as a revenge for Amalek's cowardly attack on the Jews. To celebrate this successful campaign he would kill everybody but the strongest (i.e. their king). Wiping out their property would happen at a grand finale consisting of sacrificing their best aminals to Gcd; as a sign of victory and thanking Him for it.</p>\n\n<p>Shaul is neither weak nor blind; he misunderstood the instructions.</p>\n\n<p>So we read that Shaul meets Shmuel and proclaims \"mission accomplished - come join the victory party!\".</p>\n\n<p>Shmuel is aghast at what he sees and hears (and knows from a prophecy) - and questions Shaul about it, in the hope that Shaul would repent for not doing the Mitzvah properly.</p>\n\n<p>Like 2 ships passing in the night, Shaul doesn't understand what Shmuel wants from him until Shmuel finally spells it out in full: \"You misunderstood the Mitzvah\".</p>\n\n<p>At this point, the penny drops.

Why don't Jews prostrate as well?</p>\n\n<p>Surely it shows more honour towards Hashem if one would bow down properly rather than a slight bow, as is done on Yom Kippur by most congregations.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a Halacha that one must not prostrate themselves when praying? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Prostration was common throughout the Biblical period and remained daily practice for many Jews into the medieval period, especially in Muslim countries. Maimonides in Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Tefila 5:13-14 discusses prostration in the context of the post-Amidah suplications/tachanun. He seems to be writing descriptively (this is what Jews do) rather than prescriptively (this is what one should/must do), and says that some have the practice of 'kida' (sitting on ones knees and then folding one's body over them and stretching one's arms straight out on the floor) while others do 'hishtachavaya' (lying completely flat with both arms & legs extended straight, a 'superman' type pose). It remained the practice for tachanun among Yeminte Jews until relatively recently, and continues to be practiced by some individuals here & there. In Ashkenazi communities it is only preformed during a few key moments during the High Holidays.</p>\n\n<p>The only flat-out prohibition on prostration is that it cannot be done on stone floors outside the Temple in Jerusalem. Not very many places where Jews pray really have stone floors, but I suspect this prohibition is behind the common behaviour in Ashkenazi communities when prostrating during the High Holidays to put a towel or tallis bag beneath one's head. </p>\n\n<p>Nevertheless, because it is not common in any large Jewish communities today, there are issues with doing it in public. The Talmud records that during his prayer Rabbi Akiva could be left in one corner of the room and later found in the opposite corner because of his many bows & prostrations. It goes on to note that he would not do so in public so as to not inconvenience the community. Some authorities, for example Rav Moshe Feinstein, have interpreted this story to mean that one should not do things in shul that are seen as strange or outlandish and will cause a commotion or distract people. </p>\n\n<p>My personal practice when I'm alone or in my yeshiva is to prostrate during tachanun, but I don't do so in shul for the above mentioned reasons. I do think it's a shame that the practice has fallen into disuse, though.</p>\n\n\n",

See for instance towards the bottom of <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/halacha/halacha-lmaaseh/food-fore-blessings-bracha-rishona-special-cases/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>The easiest practical way out of the issue is to make individual brachot on each element <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5763/beshalach.html#\" rel=\"nofollow\">in the right order</a></strong> (<a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/?CategoryID=160&ArticleID=8803\" rel=\"nofollow\">mnemonic</a>: <strong>MeGa EASh</strong>: Mezonot Gefen Etz Adama Sheakol - works better in Hebrew <em>mega aish</em>).

Is this actually true for rice as well, because, clearly, the rice of the sushi is taful to the rest of the ingredients.</p>\n<p>A13) What bracha to say on Sushi is a really difficult and fantastic question. I personally asked Rabbi Mandlebaum, the author of V'Zos Habracha, and he confirmed that we treat sushi as the third category of Ikar and Tofel- TaArovet Tofel. Therefore, the bracha would be dictated by the largest ingredient by volume. I am no expert in sushi, but I feel like there is more rice than there is fish or vegetables (counted each separately)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Both males and females must be sent\n  out. Outside of the camp they must be sent; and they shall not\n  defile their camp that I dwell among them. (Bamidbar 5:2-3)\n  Chazal learn from these verses that there were three encampments:\n  the Machane Yisrael on the outside, the Machane Leviya surrounding\n  the Mishkan, and the Machane Shechina, which was the\n  Mishkan and its courtyard. Those with tzaraas could not enter any\n  of the camps. Those defiled by zav-related emissions could not enter\n  the Machane Leviya but could remain in the Machane Yisrael. Those\n  who were tamei mes could not enter the Machane Shechina but could\n  enter into the Machane Leviya. When the Beis Hamikdash replaced\n  the Miskan as the permanent home for the Aron Kodesh, the three\n  camps translated into: the walls of Jerusalem as the Machane Yisrael,\n  Har Habayis as the Machane Leviya, and the Mikdash and its courtyards\n  (not including the Ezras Nashim) as the Machane Shechina.\n  The same prohibitions restricting which person could go into a given\n  area applied to the Beis Hamikdash as with the Mishkan.\n  The Mishniac source for all restrictions concerning Har Habayis\n  and the various areas within it is in Kelim:\n  Har Habayis is holier (than the areas within the walls of Jerusalem)\n  since zavim, zavos, nidos, and yalados cannot enter it. The\n  chel is even holier since goyim and tamei mes may not enter it.\n  The Ezras Nashim is even holier since a t’vul yom may not enter\n  it, but entering it does not require the atonement of a chatas. The\n  Ezras Yisrael is even holier since a m’chusar kipurim may not enter\n  it and would require the atonement of a chatas. (Kelim 1:8)\n  It is clear from this Mishna that a tamei mes may enter Har Habayis.\n  2 The Tosefta (Kelim, Bava Kama 1:7) that parallels this Mishna is even clearer: “One who is tamei mes may enter Har Habayis; not\n  only a tamei mes, but even a mes itself.” While this ruling is rather\n  starling to those who have never heard it, it still holds today (Rambam\n  Hilchos Beis Habechira 3:15, Hilchos Biyas Hamikdash 3:4). A\n  corpse may be brought into Har Habayis.\n  The restrictions on entry to Har Habayis and the Ezras Yisrael\n  are from the Torah, since these were the original restrictions on the\n  Machane Leviya and Machane Shechina. The restrictions on the chel\n  and the Ezras Nashim are rabbinic. The Talmud records no debates\n  or analysis on this Mishna, so the Mishna remains the final halacha.\n  Rambam in Hilchos Beis Habechira (7:15–18) and Hilchos Biyas Ha-\n  Mikdash (3:3–12) details these halachos and follows the Mishna exactly.\n  The only outstanding issue, as far as contemporary halacha is\n  concerned, is whether the laws still apply to a time like today, when\n  there is no Beis HaMikdash. Concerning this point there is much\n  debate...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kohanim slept on guard?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The very start of <em>mishnayos maseches Midos</em> mentions that the <em>kohanim</em> guarded the <em>bes hamikdash</em> in three locations, including <em>bes hamokad</em>, a room on the north side of the <em>mikdash</em> courtyard. The <em>mishna</em> there says that if the captain of the guards caught guards asleep on the job, he'd hit him. The <em>Rambam</em>'s commentary to the start of chapter 5 of <em>mishnayos maseches Sh'kalim</em> clearly says that the punishment applied to <em>kohen</em> guards. (<em>L'viyim</em> guarded the <em>bes hamikdash</em> also, and some explain the punishment in <em>Midos</em> as applying to only <em>l'viyim</em>.) However, it's clear from the start of <em>mishnayos maseches Tamid</em> that the <em>kohanim</em> <strong>slept</strong> in <em>bes hamokad</em> (and the context implies that this was while they were on guard). How do we reconcile the <em>mishna</em> that says <em>kohanim</em> slept in <em>bes hamokad</em> with the one that (according into <em>Rambam</em>) says that they were punished for sleeping on guard?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Given that there were different shifts of guards, it would be that they would sleep in the guard room while not on shift. During their shift, they had to stay awake and on guard.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/salt-bemidbar/34-9bamidbar.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">PARASHAT BAMIDBAR By Rav David Silverberg</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>At one point in Parashat Bamidbar, the Torah speaks of the tribe of\n  Levi with the expression shomerei mishmeret ha-kodesh (\"watchmen of\n  the sacred guard\" – 3:38) – which the Rambam understood as a reference\n  to this tribe's responsibility to guard the Beit Ha-mikdash (Hilkhot\n  Beit Ha-bechira 8:3).  </p>\n  \n  <p>Later in this chapter (8:6), the Rambam\n  describes how the kohanim standing guard inside the Mikdash would\n  sleep: \"The kohanim who guarded would not sleep in the priestly\n  garments; rather, they would fold them and place them near their\n  heads, wear their personal clothing, and sleep on the floor – like all\n  guards of royal courtyards, who do not sleep on beds.\"  The\n  straightforward implication of the Rambam's description is that the\n  watchmen were allowed to sleep as they \"stood guard.\"  While at first\n  it may appear difficult to understand how \"watchmen\" could fulfill\n  their duties while sleeping, this becomes somewhat more tenable in\n  light of the Rambam's comments in the beginning of this chapter. \n  There he clarifies that the Temple did not require protection from\n  thieves and the like, but rather as a display of honor to the holy\n  site.  Conceivably, then, since the guards were not necessary to\n  protect the Mikdash, but rather as a means of showing honor, it was\n  perhaps permissible for them to sleep during their shift.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Indeed, the Chelkat Yoav (2:43) understood the Rambam as allowing the watchmen\n  to sleep in the Temple, and he enlists this ruling as a precedent to\n  the possibility of performing a mitzva while sleeping.  The context of\n  his discussion is the question of whether circumcision may be\n  performed on an infant while he is sleeping.  One might have argued\n  that since this mitzva is being performed on the child's behalf, some\n  minimal level of involvement is required, if only that he be awake. \n  The Chelkat Yoav demonstrates from the Rambam's ruling that Halakha\n  recognizes the possibility of fulfilling a mitzva even during sleep,\n  and hence an infant's slumber does not invalidate a circumcision.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Most other Acharonim, however, read the Rambam differently.  After\n  all, later in this same chapter in Hilkhot Beit Ha-bechira (8:10), the\n  Rambam codifies the Mishna in Masekhet Midot (1:2) which tells that an\n  official was appointed to oversee the watchmen and ensure that they\n  were all awake.  In fact, the official was authorized to strike a\n  watchman found to be asleep during guard duty, or even burn his\n  clothing.  How can this ruling be reconciled with the Rambam's earlier\n  comments, where he describes how the watchmen would sleep in the Beit\n  Ha-mikdash?  </p>\n  \n  <p>For this reason, several Acharonim (including the\n  Mishneh Le-melekh, the Ma'asai Le-melekh, and the work Be'er Sheva on\n  Masekhet Tamid) explain that the <strong>Temple watchmen worked on a rotation\n  system, whereby at every point during the night some kohanim stood\n  guard while the others slept.  When the Rambam describes how the\n  watchmen slept, he refers to the \"off-duty\" watchmen, whereas later,\n  when he tells of the official who made his rounds to ensure that all\n  the watchmen were awake, he refers to the guards working their shifts,\n  who were not permitted to sleep.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Minimum Halachic Definition of Bread\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is sort of the counter question to Mezonos bread. At what point does a grain based admixture transition between bread and non bread?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify:</p>\n\n<p>The general position of Sephardic Jewry is that any alteration of taste removes it from the status of bread, such as adding sugar, honey, or large amounts of oil. Here I'm NOT LOOKING to alter the taste per se, but I am looking to make a lower carb recipe by replacing much if the flour with a mixture of something else.</p>\n\n<p>For instance: would pure gluten still allow it to qualify as at least mezonos? Or a mixture of gluten, wheat flour, and chickpea flour allow it to be hamotzi? At what point would the transition (at least from an Ashkenazi perspective) be between bread and Mezonos, and between Mezonos and shehakol?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Pat_Haba_Bikisnin#What_is_Pas_Haba_Bikisnin.3F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Additional research</a> that may help. If we consider Pas Haba Bikisnin (PHbK), the primary definition of bread is water and flour. \"Adulterating\" the water by adding in a rov of non-water (For Ashkenazim, or enough to change the taste for Sephardim) would push an object into PHbK. This is irrespective of the additive being a liquid (oil, juice, possibly eggs, etc.) or a solid (fruit/raisins, sugar, etc.). </p>\n\n<p>Potentially, both the gluten and the chickpea flour might be considered \"adulterants.\" What isn't clear is whether the addition of more <strong><em>flour</em></strong> of another type is considered an adulteration to the <em>water</em> or the <em>wheat flour.</em> The chickpeas, since they operate <strong><em>as flour</em></strong> might be consider to dilute the wheat rather than the water. Gluten, since it is a wheat derivative, may even be rendered completely <em>battel</em> to the rov of flour, rendering the wheat flour volume of the bread effectively higher and allowing you to add in more chickpeas...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2014/02/gluten-intolerance-wheat-allergies-and-mitzvos/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> which is aiming to create a bracha of mezonot/hamotzi for the gluten intolerant, one needs 1/60 of flour from the 5 grains in order to require a hamotzi/mezonot.  Footnote 9 notes this is out of all ingredients.  So using less wheat flour than 1/60 of all ingredients should produce something on which hamotzi/mezonot need not be said.  Presumably you'll want to use some non-5 grains flour to constitute part of the rest, or else you'll have something more like a slightly thickened soup.  I'll note that the same article claims a bread of rice flour is mezonot, though I believe that is a topic of debate.  If the resulting bread has less than 1/6 or 1/8 wheat flour, one will never say birkat hamazon.  If it has more than that, one will say birkat hamazon only if one ate enough in 9 minutes to constitute an olive's worth of wheat flour.  So if 1/4 is wheat, only if one ate 4 olives worth in 9 minutes will one say birkat hamazon.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE: Wheat here is a stand in for any of the 5 grains.  Oats, barley, rye and spelt have the same halakhot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>If it looks like bread, and tastes like bread; then you bless hamotzi. Otherwise, you bless mezonot. </p>\n\n<p>If it tastes sweet(and the intention was such when it was being made) even though it looks like bread, then you bless mezonot; according to Sephardic custom.</p>\n\n<p>Any food item that contains some amount of flour(of the five grains; wheat, barley, spelt, oats, rye) in order to add flavor, then a mezonot is made; even if it is a minority ingredient(like greater than 2%). The exception to this rule is if it is added in order to keep the food item together and the flavor of the grain is not noticed(this is subject to machloket amongst Sephardi and Ashkenazi poskim regarding whether a flavored grain additive is tafel when it binds the food item together-like cheesecake).</p>\n\n<p>Any breads not made with flour of the five grains, and doesn't include a certain amount of them, would warrant a shehakol(like potato starch, chickpea flour, etc.).</p>\n\n\n",

The gemara explains that Adam was mistaken in his thought process behind the ban and commanded Chavah to neither eat nor touch it, but failed to clarify that the prohibition against touching was his extension and not an actual Divine command, in violation of Bal Tosif. This is why she does not distinguish between the two parts when asked by the nachash, and why his midrashic counter argument of pushing her against the tree persuaded her.

In this particular example, Ani Maamin brings a verse that the Rambam himself did not bring as source-text for this principle (however, in the Rambam's discussion of this principle in Moreh Nevochim, 3:17, he does cite this verse as evidence that Hashem investigates all actions of mankind). In any event, R' Moshe Shapiro assumes that the Ani Maamin was written by a person of stature, and it has been incorporated into the liturgy of virtually all Jewish communities, so here is his explanation  (R' Moshe Shapiro, found in Re'eh Emunah 10a):</p>\n<p>Seemingly, as this verse is not one of the verses that the Rambam brings, it is not being brought as a source but rather as a point of clarification. This verse is also cited in a mishna in Rosh Hashana (1:2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בראש השנה, כל באי עולם עוברין לפניו כבני מרון, שנאמר \"היוצר יחד, ליבם; המבין, אל כל מעשיהם\"</p>\n<p>On Rosh Hashana, all inhabitants of the world pass before Him like <em>b'nei maron</em>, as it says \"Who fashioned the hearts of them all, Who comprehends all their actions\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara (Rosh Hashana 18b) deduces from the addition of this verse that all of humanity is judged with one stroke. This is the judgement which incorporates all of humanity and their actions, though they may be done with free-will, into Hashem's greater plan for existence.</p>\n<p>R' Shapiro understands that the point of the 10th principle being emphasized is that Hashem's knowledge accounts for all the actions of man, and man's free will cannot subvert the greater plan that Hashem has for creation. Thus, the Ani Maamin brings this verse as an explanatory note, that Hashem has one master plan which takes into consideration and accounts for the actions of all mankind.</p>\n<p>(This is a summarized presentation of R' Shapiro's approach to this principle, in order to focus on the verse of the Ani Maamin. For the full discussion and context, see רעה אמונה p. 241-247)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Nefesh Shimshon Shaareh Emunah, R' Shimshon Pinkus says that in every other principle, we are meant to understand the concept according to our own terms. i.e. Hashem doesn't have a body means what we call not having a body. However, Hashem's knowledge is not the knowledge that we relate to on our own terms, as the Rambam explains in several places (e.g. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=1&perek=2&halocha=10\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchos Yesodei HaTorah 2:10</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=1&hilchos=5&perek=5&halocha=5\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchos Teshuva 5:5</a>), and therefore the Ani Maamin adds on this verse to clarify that Hashem's knowledge which is being discussed is the unique knowledge of Hashem's knowledge.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a parent \"victim\" forgive a child due the death penalty?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are two capital offences against parents: cursing a parent or striking a parent (and causing an injury).</p>\n\n<p>If someone did this in front of 2 witnesses with a warning etc. so they were due the death penalty, is the parent who is the victim allowed to intervene and not have their child sentenced to death?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Sheiltot (R. Achai Gaon, 8th c.) says that although a parent can forgo his honor, he cannot forgo the prohibition against striking and cursing. שאלתות (פ׳ משפטים סוף סא): האב שמחל על כבודו, כבודו מחול, ה״מ כבודו, אבל הכאתו וקללתו, לא. The Minchat Chinuch (R. Joseph Babad, 19th c.), on the other hand, holds that a father can forgo the prohibition against striking (Mitzvah 48). However, even the Minchat Chinuch concedes that after the fact, it is too late, because the sin has already occurred:</p>\n\n<p>ונלע\"ד דזה שחייבה התורה בהכה או\"א [אב ואם] או בחבירו היינו דוקא בלא רשות אבל אם אביו ואמו אומרים לו שיכם או יקללם או חבירו אינו עובר בלאו הזה ואינו חייב מלקות ולא מיתה ע' פ' החובל ובר\"מ פ\"ה מה' חובל לענין ממון אם נותן לו רשות ע\"ש. ולענין חיוב מלקות או מיתה נלענ\"ד פשוט דאינו עובר ואינו חייב וכ\"נ מלשון הר\"מ פכ\"ו מהלכות סנהדרין ה\"ו שכתב אע\"פ שיש לו לדיין או לנשיא למחול על כבודו א\"י למחול על קללתו וכן שאר העם אף על פי שמחל המקולל מלקין את המקלל <strong>שכבר חטא</strong> <strong>ונתחייב</strong> עכ\"ל וע\"ש בכ\"מ משמע דוקא אם כבר קילל כיון שכבר עבר עבירה לשמים אין המחילה מועלת אבל בתחלה שנותן רשות לקלל אין כאן עבירה כלל וכן כאן גבי מכה...‏</p>\n\n<p>In his Torah Shleimah (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_51490_94.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishpatim no. 289</a>), R. Menachem Mendel Kasher cites two works of the Ba'alei Tosafot as well as the Abarbanel on the Torah who ask how the Torah can have a death penalty for one who curses his parent--why can the parent not forgive? All of these sources conclude that the parent cannot forgive (though each gives slightly different explanations): </p>\n\n<p>ובפענח רזא: תימה איך יפסוק בזה מיתה (במקלל), ימחול האב ויפטר דהא אמרינן האב שמחל על כבודו כבודו מחול, וי״ל דהרי מכה ומקלל אינם חייבים בלא התראה ועדים ואח״כ משקבלו התראה בעדים שוב אין יכולים למחול...ובכת\"י מושב זקנים: הקשה הגן, היאך תמצא מקלל אביו במיתה והלא יכול למחול לו דהכי קיי\"ל בפ״ק דקדושין האב שמחל על כבודו כבודו מחול, וי\"ל נהי דיכול למחול על כבודו, על בזיונו אינו יכול למחול. ובאברבנאל: ואפי׳ שאביו ואמו ימחלו לו וירצו הם לחמול עליו אין מוחלים לו.‏</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I am going to point to a different mitzvah - Ben sorer umoreh <strong><em>requires</em></strong> that both parents willingly transport the child to Beis Din for both the initial warning and the final judgement. If either relents or refuses, the child cannot be punished.</p>\n\n<p>No such dispensation is provided for in the case of cursing or hitting your parents.</p>\n\n<p>@Shokhet notes that the father has the choice to be mochel on his kavod. While this is interesting, it is immaterial to the case at hand, since cursing or striking your parents is not <strong><em>only</em></strong> a violation of kibbud av v'em, it is <strong><em>also</em></strong> a violation of the direct prohibition against striking your parents, and a violation of \"Ish aviv v'imo tira'u.\" <em>[Additionally, it's also a separate prohibition against striking</em> <strong><em>any</em></strong> <em>person (though Chazal are at odds in Bava Kama as to whether you can preemptively mochel someone who strikes you.)]</em> These latter three are unaffected by the father's forgiveness of the son - he can mochel his own kavod, but he does not have the power to gloss over issurim at a whim.</p>\n\n<p>If he wishes to plead with the witness to keep them from bringing the case to court o testify, he can certainly try, but he cannot nullify the existing transgressions.</p>\n\n\n",

Will my children be Jewish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My mother was adopted, raised as a reform Jew and became Bat Mitzvah, continued with her Jewish studies through Confirmation...but I do recall her finding out one day that her parents never officially 'converted' her as an infant. She was informed by an Orthodox friend, who had to unfortunately be the one to let her know that she wasn't allowed to participate in some ceremony within her community because she wasn't officially on-the-books Jewish, which led to her asking her adoptive parents about it, who then confessed they never officially converted her as an infant, but they believed her becoming Bat Mitzvah and getting Confirmed were enough for their own community, so why go through the trouble?</p>\n\n<p>Flash forward to the future. I'm her (now adult) daughter, who was also raised in the Reform community. I also had the formal Jewish education and became Bat Mitzvah. I believe I can reasonably assume I am considered Jewish at least in the Reform community. </p>\n\n<p>My question is--when I have children some day, will my female children be considered Jewish by descent, at least in the Reform community? At birth, I mean, before they become Bat Mitzvah or receive specific religious instruction? Like those who are technically Jewish under Halachaic practice despite never practicing Judaism (i.e. great-grandmother was Jewish in unbroken female line, but let's say the person was raised Catholic, this person is still considered Jewish under Halachah without officially converting because of the Jewish female ancestor in maternal line). </p>\n\n<p>I suppose...am I \"Jewish enough\" for that matrilineal practice to come into play for my children? At least in the Reform community?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Reform movement believes in patrilineal descent (at least of 1983, when it was a radical departure from thousands of years of traditional Judaism). So if your father is Jewish, then you would be considered Jewish by the Reform movement (but not the rest of Jewry) whether or not your mother is Jewish. </p>\n\n<p>Whether your mother is Jewish according to Reform Judaism is a question for Reform clergy, since someone being adopted and raised Jewish despite never converting is an unusual case. </p>\n\n<p>However, according to <a href=\"http://www.reformjudaism.org/ask-rabbi-topic/adoption\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this website</a>, the Reform movement requires conversion of adopted children in order for them to be considered Jewish. I'm not sure whether this is a universal view.</p>\n\n<p>As you may be aware, you would not be considered Jewish by Conservative or Orthodox Judaism, because both require conversion according to Jewish law. Even if you and/or your children converted through Reform Judaism, this would not be considered valid by Orthodox Jews (and probably by most Conservative Jews). </p>\n\n<p>This is because Reform conversions are not conducted according to Jewish law (with a beis din made up of three valid witnesses, acceptance of the yoke of all the mitzvos of the (Oral and Written) Torah, and immersion in a kosher mikvah). As an aside, many people have grown up thinking they were Jewish, then realized they weren't Jewish according to halacha, and ended up completing an Orthodox conversion. See <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1470014521\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> and <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0684823411\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this</a> for interesting examples.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, I wish you all the best with deciding what to do about clarifying your status!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If there is a question about the legitimacy of your mother's status as a Jewess or not then an Orthodox Beis Din (court) will insist on <strong>at least</strong> a giyur l'chumra (a conversion to be stringent just to make sure), but in cases of adoption etc. especially coming from the Reform movement because of their disregard for Halacha especially in the areas of who is Jewish and marriage etc. they will most probably treat this case as a regular conversion. Either way an acceptance of all the mitzvos is necessary and it is an involved process. </p>\n\n<p>And no, jumping in the mikvah on ones own accord doesn't work. </p>\n\n\n",

I will provide an answer based upon my personal understanding of the issues involved. There are many sources throughout Rishonim, Achronim, and modern rabbis who talk about this and there are shivim panim le'Torah, especially in this regard. So there are plenty of source for and against any given opinion.</p>\n\n<p>I'm also going to steal something I wrote previously for a burial that is very pertinent to this question.\n/Disclaimer</p>\n\n<p>Okay, now on to the meat of things:\nWhen we talk of God being beyond time, there are many interpretations of the how we handly those implications. Does he \"walk through\" time at will like you or I would travel through space? My understanding is that God occupies a higher (or infinite, or beyond infinite, what have you) mathematical N-space. If you were to take your three dimensional self and consider the extension of your body through time from the moment of your birth until your eventual death, that unit would be your four dimensional self. A being in a higher dimension wouldn't see you \"going about your day\" in a linear, time based manner - they would perceive you and the sum of your choices like you view the contours on an object - as an indivisible part of the whole.</p>\n\n<p>To put it another way:\n<strong><em>Does your current knowledge of what you did yesterday impede your free will yesterday?</em></strong> No, because those actions have already occurred from your perspective in time. God does not view time linearly. So when he creates/created the world, it wasn't just at the moment of Genesis, but rather the whole of existence from start to finish. We only perceive creation linear because we are bound to this lower order of existence, which is why we state that \"He renews, in his goodness, the creation each day.\" We also states that Hashem sees \"From one end of the world to the other and from the creation of the world to it's end,\"  that \"a thousand years are identical to a single passing day in your eyes,\" and many others that point to this form of transcendence.</p>\n\n<p>This means that God's knowledge of our future actions isn't a violation of freewill because, from the divine, nonlinear perspective, <strong><em>you have already acted.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Now to answer your question...\nThere are many who would posit that, yes, if September 11th hadn't happened then those victims \"would have died anyhow in some other way.\" But this is true only if you are looking at \"destiny/fate\" from a linear perspective, so these people were \"fated\" to die. According to a non-linear perspective, not only is freewill completely free and preserved, <strong><em>the impact of your freewill is uniquely preserved as well.</em></strong> Your future actions are <strong><em>integral</em></strong> to the form of creation in \"our past,\" since from Hashem's perspective they exist simultaneous to the moment light was \"let.\"</p>\n\n<p>SHEHAKOL NIHIYEH BIDVARO: This is the only bracha we regularly recite that ISN'T in past or present tense. We don't say that everything IS or HAYU - WAS, only NIHIYEH - that it WILL BE. Not only that, but it's in first person PLURAL- WE will be according to his word. What is going on?!</p>\n\n<p>Intrinsic to this bracha is a recognition that, in the present tense, all is not (or doesn't seem) \"according to plan.\" Things that should never have been, are, and the world that was supposed to exist vanished. The expulsion from Eden, the spies in the desert, Moshe hitting the rock. Turning points where the brighter future was made distant, where the path was rerouted into two thousand years of exile, pogroms, the fires of the Holocaust, and a nation purchasing it's survival with the blood of its children and the tears of its parents. We lost the world that was, and this is not a world that should be. But it is still a world that CAN BE, because we can still become something greater. So we remind ourselves that hope is never fully lost, it is only deferred.</p>\n\n<p>In Parshas Yitro, Rashi remarks that originally all ten Dibros were stated simultaneously in a single incomprehensible syllable. They were later extracted by Moshe and individually related to Klal Yisroel. </p>\n\n<p>Shehakol nihiyeh <strong><em>bidvaro:</em></strong> We exist in that one utterance, a knotted and jumbled mass where we strain to hear the strands of the divine directive amid the cacophony of colloquial existence. When we reach that clarity, when the future that beckons us becomes our present, then we will hear the harmonies resolve themselves clearly and perceive the perfect tapestry of existence as we did at kriyas yam suf.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal state that this is the understanding of Shirah - the understanding of history at the point of redemption where even the worst pieces of our past are integral to our present - \"Az yimalei tzchok pinu, ulshoneinu rina.\"</p>\n\n\n",

While the daughter might verbally refuse to accept the kiddushin, her father can (or already has) accepted it on her behalf through the principle of Zachin Le'Adam Shelo Bifanav, coupled with the assumptions that 1) as a minor she doesn't have proper da'as to make an informed decision and 2) as a woman it is preferable to be married than single (Tav limeitav tan do milimeitav armelah).</p>\n\n<p>The marriage initiates whenever the \"master\" decides he wishes to be married to her or to marry her off, but they must do so by the time she reaches maturity. If they fail to arrange a marriage after the daughter becomes an adult, then she regains possession of herself when her father loses the right to sell her off. It doesn't <strong><em>preclude</em></strong> her from getting married to her erstwhile owner, but now she has complete choice in the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Since all divorce must be voluntarily initiated by the husband, the wife technically does <strong>not</strong> have a \"right to divorce,\" though Beis Din is capable of \"forcing one\" out of her recalcitrant husband.

Ultimately, emotionally feeling that God exists as an unverifiable experiential truth is functionally identical to choosing to believe and act as though God exists intellectually. Conceptually, the former is far more \"irreversible\" than professing an intellectual understanding, which can always be changed. Whether a behavior is \"more courageous\" simply because it is based upon uncertainty is irrelevant when discussing whether there is an obligation to be certain of God's existence.</p>\n\n<p>There is a very clear passuk (deuteronomy 4:35) that states \"You have been shown to know that Hashem is God, there is no other (or nothing) aside from him.\"\nThis seems to point to an actual requirement as a result of personal experience to know, factually, that God exists. </p>\n\n<p>The question that can be posed is whether this obligation applies only to the generation of the wilderness who had direct experience - they were \"shown\" - or is it incumbent upon everyone afterwards to a) accept the testimony from those who were shown and/or B) proactively seek-out the Divine and therefore \"see it\" being shown to you.</p>\n\n<p>While I find Halbertal's argument emotionally compelling, and I laud you for consciously choosing to accept the proposition of the existence of God, it seems that the next step may be that you are now <strong><em>required</em></strong> to find proof you feel is compelling you toward \"knowledge\" of Hashem's existence, rather than as an intellectual act of faith.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Chovos Halevavos (<a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=422\" rel=\"nofollow\">intro</a>) maintains we are under duty to investigate through rational proofs (see Gate 1) and by observing the divine wisdom in nature (see gate 2) as he says in the intro:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On this the believer is not permitted by our religion to remain in\n  ignorance, for the Torah exhorts us on this in saying \"Therefore, know\n  this day and consider within your heart, that the L-ord is G-d in\n  Heaven above and on the earth below.

This seems strange because if the translation is really  \"on the mountain Hashem will be seen\" then 'Hashem' and 'will be seen' should be combined.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any explanations for this phenomenon or alternative texts that in an way obviate this problem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>First of all, the plain-sense meaning of the verse (even without the te'amim) is that בהר and יי are in construct (\"the mountain <em>of</em> God\"), as is evidenced by the niqqud. As mevaqesh noted in a comment on the previous answer, \"on the mountain\" is בָּהַר (<em>bahar</em>), while בְּהַר (<em>behar</em>) means \"on the mountain <em>of</em>\". So the niqqud and the te'amim are, in this instance at least, consistent. The verse reads, \"on the mountain of God, he/it will be seen\".</p>\n\n<p>As to who the referent of the verb is, you could take it as God if you like. That will produce something that means that \"on the mountain of God, he [ie: God] will be seen\". That seems to have been the interpretation of Targum \"Yonatan\", which expands the clause as follows: בטוורא הדין כפת אברהם ית יצחק ברה ותמן אתגלית עלוי שכינתא דיי, \"on this mountain, Abraham bound his son Isaac, <strong>and there the shekhinah of God was revealed to him</strong>\".</p>\n\n<p>You can see similar interpretations in Rashi (בהר זה יראה הקדוש ברוך הוא לעמו) and in Rashbam (בהר יי נראה הקב״ה לאברהם), amongst other places.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the translation that you have provided is that of Artscroll. Artscroll's translation is what is known as a \"dynamic equivalence\" translation, in that it aims to convey the literal <em>sense</em> of the passuk (based on Chazal), rather than render it literally into English. In this instance, it is deliberately not following the niqqud/te'amim in order to present something that means the same as what an adherence to the niqqud/te'amim together with the interpretations of particular mefarshim will produce.</p>\n\n<p>You can compare this to the translation of JPS, which is more of a \"formal equivalence\" translation. They render this clause as, \"On the mount of the Lord there is vision\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Chazal state that <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/olas-shabbos/5768/vayeitzei.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Har Hamoriah and the place Yaakov slept</a> were identical to Har Sinai, which is called \"Har Hashem.\" Matan Torah was the point where Hashem \"made himself seen on the Mountain of Hashem,\" which would be the literal interpretation of the text when using the masoretic taamim. He also appeared to Yaakov at that location, who identified the place as Beit El (see the above link).</p>\n\n<p>See Rashi on your verse for a number of different interpretations, some of which point to other explanations.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch  (using the English translation of the German by his grandson Rabbi Isaac Levi) translates the pasuk</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>On the mount of Hashem one is seen</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the commentary, Rav Hirsch connects this with Aliyas Haregel</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Thrice yearly יראה, every son of Abraham, Isaac, must be seen on this\n  mount, and not ריקם, with mere inner, passing devotion, but with the\n  sacrificing dedication of the whole of his being as expressed in עןלת\n  ראיה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus we actually take part in the akeidah ourselves at the same place that Avraham and Yitzchak brought the korbon.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How many Judges need be present at a Mikva for conversion?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The halacha states that 3 judges have to witness the person who goes into the mikva for conversion. According to Biblical law, are 3 necessary (assuming mikvah is needed) and is the conversion complete with only one judge post facto (assuming the other requirements are fulfilled)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Talmud states in several places (Yevamos 46b, Kiddushin 62b), based on Biblical exegesis, that 3 people are required to witness <em>something</em> in order for the conversion to be valid:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גר צריך שלשה מ\"ט (ויקרא כד, כב) משפט כתיב ביה כדין</p>\n<p>Conversion needs 3.  Why?  It says \"judgement\" by conversion, like a court case (which needs a Court of 3 judges).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosefos in Kiddushin discusses what the three need to witness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נראה דוקא בקבלת מצות הוא דבעינן ג' אבל בטבילה בחד סגיא אם כבר קיבל עליו המצות וראיה מההיא דיבמות (דף מה:) דקאמר התם ההוא דהוו קרי ליה בר ארמאי פירוש משום דמל ולא טבל אמר ריב\"ל מי לא טבל לקריו כלומר וכי לא ראה קרי מימיו דצריך לטבול א\"כ משמע מדנפיק בטבילת קריו משמע דלא בעינן שלשה ומיהו קשה מהא דאמר (שם דף מז:) דמושיבין אותה במים עד צוארה ושני תלמידי חכמים יושבים מבחוץ ומודיעין לה מקצת מצות קלות ומקצת חמורות ופריך והא בעינן שלשה ומשני תני שלשה אלמא משמע דלטבילה נמי בעינן שלשה ויש לומר דודאי למצוה בעינן שלשה אבל לא לעכב אי נמי י\"ל דהא דבעי שלשה היינו טעמא משום קבלת מצות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosefos first brings support that the three are only necessary for the acceptance of <em>mitzvos</em>, but that one is enough for <em>mikvah</em>.  Then Tosefos questions this, and suggests that while 3 are ideal for <em>mikvah</em>, one is enough after the fact (but seemingly would still be necessary for accepting <em>mitzvos</em>).</p>\n<p>The Rambam concludes that someone who immerses before 2 people is not a convert - <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5113.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Isurei Biah 13:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טבל בינו לבין עצמו, ונתגייר בינו לבין עצמו, ואפילו בפני שניים--אינו גר</p>\n<p>If he immerses by himself... even if it is infront of two, he is not a convert.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>There is another question currently being discussed that touches on similar points.</p>\n\n<p>First off, any conversion is done under the assumption of Rabbinic approval (i.e.: that the authority of the conversion rests upon the approval of the rabbis). This is similar to how all marriages are done \"Kidas Moshe ViYisroel\" with Rabbinic approval, which allows Beis Din to retroactively nullify marriage in certain cases. Famously, the Rabbis refused to accept conversion during certain periods of history regardless of the process of the convert.</p>\n\n<p>Halachah demands that conversion requires kabbalas ol mitzvos, a small amount of learning, tevilah in a mikvah in front of beis din (though there are ways to circumvent this one - namely if they turn around until the convert is under water), and (for a man) circumcision. No \"biblical\" conversion is acceptable without these factors, because that is what is required by the rabbanim. </p>\n\n<p>Aside from all that, the Tanach is largely quiet on what constitutes \"conversion.\" It is clear that circumcision is definitely required, but it isn't readily apparent that mikvah for a woman is a d'orayta requirement, and it certainly wasn't required to be done in front of Beis Din. </p>\n\n<p>For the clearest example of this, look at Sefer Rus and <a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/rus-david-and-the-prohibition-of-marrying-moavites/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the associated gemaras.</a> At no point does Rus or Orpah engage in what we would consider an \"official\" conversion, even when married to two Jewish men. Rus declares her acceptance of the mitzvot, and Chazal consider her the \"first ger/giyoret.\" </p>\n\n<p>When they return to Eretz Yisroel, no one questions whether her conversion was valid. The only point in doubt was her previous status as a Moabite woman, which might prevent her from marrying into the Jewish lineage (though she would still be permitted to converts and mamzerim). The Chumash says \"Lo yavo ammoni umo'avi bikahal Hashem.\" Boaz laid claim that the possuk be interpreted \"Mo'avi vilo mo'avis,\" meaning that Rus, as a Moabite woman, would still be permitted to him. But there was many who questioned whether this was a savara subject to refutation or the de facto halacha. This was why Ploni Almoni was fearful of doing yibum on Rus. The halachic question wasn't even resolved until <strong><em>hundreds</em></strong> of years later when Shaul wanted to know whether he was bound by his promise to marry off his daughter to Dovid, the descendant of Rus the Moabite. After much back and forth, Amasa came forth and stated that it was a Halacha LiMoshe MiSinai, which isn't subject to logical refutation - Dovid was completely Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>What we see is that Chazal accepted Rus' declaration of kabalas ol mitzvos as a complete conversion <strong><em>in their time,</em></strong> as this was the only \"biblical\" requirement. In the present day, there is no distinction to be made between the \"rabbinic\" conversion process and the biblical one, since the Torah explicitly states an obligation to listen to the Sages.</p>\n\n\n",

Additionally, the text of the beracha implies nothing about it referring to a home. So why do people say divrei torah and use this as a reference for the couple to build an everlasting home?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Actually, it's Rashi, not the gemara, that says that... Ultimately, people use it because it's nice, not because it's 100% accurate vis a vis dikduk and the gemara. Lots of derashot do this - they take liberty in deviating from the peshat for the purposes of providing a nice message... </p>\n\n<p>After further thought, the \"Binyan Aday Ad\" is referring not to Chavah, but to Womanhood (because Chavah would become mortal). The term Binyan refers to the shape of a woman, which is not an exclusive trait of Chavah. This means that the bracha would therefore be a reference to Marriage and not just Chavah being made for Adam. Contrast this to us referring to a \"Bayis Ne'eman BiYisroel\" - the word bayis doesn't appear in our bracha. </p>\n\n<p>The bayis is a <strong>result</strong> of the binyan of the ishah being referenced in the bracha. Bayis ne'eman is stating the hope that the familial line being instituted by the bride and groom will not fail - that they will have children and those children will go on to have children, \"maintaining the house.\" We only refer to the woman's role in conception and childbirth obliquely when we gloss over the meaning of the bracha to wish them a Bayis Ne'eman, but it's still there.</p>\n\n\n",

First, nowadays one can only fulfill the mitzvah of\n  simchat Yom Tov by eating meat. Second, the mitzvah to eat meat is\n  obligatory. Third, the mitzvah of simchat Yom Tov applies to every Yom\n  Tov meal.

Once she is chosen by the king, why doesn't she (perhaps with Mordechai's permission) tell the king she is Jewish at that point? Wouldn't that have placed the Jews in a positive light in the kingdom and perhaps avoided Haman's plot in the first place?</p>\n\n<p>In sum, why didn't Esther reveal her origin earlier?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The following is culled from <a href=\"http://www.oz-vehadar.com/en/department/64/purim\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Oz V'hadar's Mesivta on Megillas Esther</a>, page 37, note 89; pages 230-232; and pages 251-252. Unless otherwise specified, the mefarshim are on Esther 2:10. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Mordechai wanted people to think that she was from a lowly family, and not from Sha'ul HaMelech. Had Achashveirosh known she was Jewish, that may have impacted her odds of becoming queen (Rashi, Rid). According to Rashi, presumably, Mordechai wanted to know if Esther's coronation was min hashamayim (see #7 below). The Rid says clearly Mordechai <em>didn't</em> want Esther to be queen and knew that revealing this information would mean her odds would go up for being picked. </p></li>\n<li><p>Were Achashveirosh to kill her like he did Vashti, he may have gone after her entire nation (Targum Rishon and Sheini).</p></li>\n<li><p>Mordechai did not want a position of authority. Were Achashveirosh told that Mordechai raised her, he would have been granted a position in his court (Yalkut Remez 1023, Manos HaLevi). </p></li>\n<li><p>It would be easier for her to practice her religion if Achashveirosh didn't know what it was (R' Sa'adiah Gaon, Ibn Ezra, Rabbeinu Bachaye, Maharam Cheliav). </p></li>\n<li><p>Mordechai was afraid that Achashveirosh, in his love for Esther, would decree that all of his officers should marry into her people (Rokeiach).</p></li>\n<li><p>If a bad decree were placed on the Jews, Esther would A) not be placed under the decree, and B) have the upper hand in getting the decree revoked, as they would rescind it upon hearing that she was Jewish herself (Rokeiach).</p></li>\n<li><p>Were Achashveirosh to know that she was Jewish, he wouldn't marry her, but nevertheless he would have relations with her. She would thus be humiliated (Tosfos HaShalem 2:10:3, Lekach Tov, Rishon LeTzion). And even if he wanted to marry her, his anti-Semitic advisors might give him some pushback (Chachamim of France, Ri Nachmiash to v. 8, Menachem ben Chelbo, R' Yosef Kra). It was important to Mordechai that she be queen so that she could be the conduit for good things between Achashveirosh and the Jews (Ralbag, R' Elisha Glikow). But if they knew that she was Jewish, she would have the opposite effect - they would hate the Jews even more (R' Sa'adiah Gaon).</p></li>\n<li><p>Mordechai wanted the option of kidnaping her and escaping to another kingdom if need be. If Achashveirosh knew she were Jewish, he would kill the Jews were she not returned (R' Avigdor Kohen Tzedek). That's why Mordechai was always hanging about the palace gates (Tosfos HaShalem 2:19:7).</p></li>\n<li><p>If Achashveirosh were to decree an evil decree on the Jews, he would single out Shevet Binyamin to be exempt. Were Esther to plead for her people, Achashveirosh wouldn't listen, as he would say that he already exempted her Shevet (Alshich to v. 11, R' Sa'adiah Gaon).</p></li>\n<li><p>Other nations, afraid of Esther's potential to knock down their standing before the king and to turn him against them, might spread rumors against her until she is killed like Vashti was (Maharal).</p></li>\n<li><p>They needed to take Esther against her will; she did not come willingly. Were she to reveal her nation, Achashveirosh might take revenge against them that they held back his future queen (Gra, Yosef Lekach). </p></li>\n<li><p>Everyone loved Esther and thought she was a part of their people. The ruse would only work as long as she didn't reveal her nation (Maharsha to Megillah 13a \"Esther\"). </p></li>\n<li><p>Mordechai reasoned that in light of all of the anti-Semitism, and that they didn't know what was to be in store for them, having someone in the palace secretly being a Jew would be an advantage over their enemies (pseudo-Rambam).</p></li>\n<li><p>If their enemies didn't know that Esther was Jewish, they would have no problem discussing their evil plans in front of her (Rishon LeTzion).</p></li>\n<li><p>Haman had given Achashveirosh the advice to kill Vashti and replace her with another queen. If Achashveirosh didn't know his wife's nationality, she could have been from Haman's people, for all he knew, and thus Haman's tool to overthrow him (Mahari Asad).</p></li>\n<li><p>Mordechai had no idea why Esther shouldn't reveal her nationality; he had received a nevuah to that effect, but was unclear on why it was necessary. To the contrary - it would have been better for her to say she were Jewish and the anti-Semitic king to refuse to marry her (Megillas Sesarim).</p></li>\n<li><p>Mordechai wanted to keep tabs on Esther. Were their marriage revealed, Achashveirosh would have prevented him from entering the palace. Now, Esther had been taken from Mordechai's house; is it not obvious that there's some connection between them? But they didn't bring any of the women to Achashveirosh; they brought them to Hagai, who could not be expected to remember where all the women came from. </p></li>\n<li><p>As long as it was doubtful if she would become Achashveirosh's queen, she was still mutar to Mordechai. If she were to reveal her nation and that she descended from royalty, she would definitely be his queen and would be assur (Ksav Sofer, based on Tosfos to Kesubos 51a \"Assurah\").</p></li>\n<li><p>If Achashveirosh had relations with Esther for his own pleasure, Esther would be considered an Anusah, as she was taken against her will. Once she revealed her nationality, she risked him having relations to draw her away from her religion, which would require her to give up her life rather than concede. Mordechai saw through Ruach HaKodesh that she was important for Hashem's plan, and therefore she needed to be alive rather than die al kidush Hashem (Yedei Moshe).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: You just asked a <strong><em>LOADED</em></strong> question that just about everyone talks about. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the <strong>Targum Sheni (2:10)</strong> Mordechai was concerned with Esther revealing this because the king would become upset with Esther at some point and direct his anger out on her people. Just as (later) Haman directed his hatred against Mordechai to the rest of the Jewish people, the king could do the same with Esther.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I always wondered if Mordechai told her to keep her family a secret because he wanted Esther to become queen and thought if it was found out that she was Jewish it would ruin her chances.</p>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8874/21\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10353/21\">here</a> for more.</p>\n\n<p>The most common name in the Jewish Bible for God is spelled in Hebrew letters that would roughly correspond with YHVH in English (Hebrew doesn't always use vowels); this is known as the \"Tetragrammaton\", i.e. the four-letter name of God. Jews don't pronounce that as written, instead they pronounce it \"Adonai\", which means \"my lord.\" The conventional English translations of the Bible (e.g. King James) translate this as \"The Lord.\" </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's traditional Jewish translation</a> translates this name simply as \"God.\"</p>\n\n<p>You are correct about its first appearance being in Genesis Ch. 2. Genesis Ch. 1 is taking a cosmic-scale look at the universe, and thus uses the name \"Elohim\", i.e. \"All-mighty.\" (The point is that one, all-mighty God, is responsible for everything in creation, rather than a pantheon.) </p>\n\n<p>The Tetragrammaton is generally used vis-a-vis a more personal relationship with God; it also is usually used when referencing God's mercy, whereas \"Almighty\" is usually used in the context of harsh judgment. Still one God, just different perspectives.</p>\n\n<p>Or as Rabbi Kaplan puts it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>For the rest of this chapter, the Torah uses two names, Adonoy Elohim, usually translated as 'the Lord God.' In the earlier chapters, only the name Elohim (usually translated 'God') was used. According to tradition, Elohim denoted a creation with unmitigated justice, whereas the name Adonoy denotes an admixture of mercy. Since there is no simple, contemporary way to translate Adonoy Elohim, we translate it as 'God'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From when the structure of the world is in place (Genesis 2:4) until Adam is figuring out his post-Eden existence (Genesis 3:24), the scripture uses the combined name \"Adonai Elohim.\" The first time \"Adonai\" is used on its own actually comes out of Adam's mouth in Genesis 4:1, when he becomes a father and says, \"I now have a son, thanks to [Tetragrammaton, pronounced \"Adonai.\"] This name is only used vis-a-vis God.</p>\n\n<p>Now if this wasn't complicated enough, <em>sometimes</em> a name is spelled out literally as \"Adonai\" (i.e. the Hebrew letters spell ADNY, not YHVH). Most English translations don't have a good way to distinguish between ADNY and YHVH-which-you-should-pronounce-ADNY. Sorry. ADNY, spelled as such, can be a person referring to God, his master; or could be a form of respectful address from one person to another.</p>\n\n<p>You'll find such an instance in Genesis 18:3. Abraham is having a prophetic experience, when he pauses to invite some guests. He starts by addressing ADNY. It's unclear (i.e. the traditional Jewish commentaries suggest both explanations) if he's asking God to be excused so he help the visitors; or if he's addressing the visitors respectfully. </p>\n\n<p>So far so good?</p>\n\n<p>You're probably thinking about <a href=\"https://outreachjudaism.org/psalm110/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 110:1</a>.

That stopped during the First Temple period with the exile of the northern ten tribes (a bit more than a hundred years before thee First Temple's destruction).</p>\n\n<p>But the prayers were instituted by the \"Men of the Great Assembly\", who were active during the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2835&st=&pgnum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">destruction</a> of the Beis Hamikdash and the Babylonian exile. So they instituted a prayer on an event which (as of then) hasn't happened for over a hundred years and won't happen again until Moshiach comes.</p>\n\n<p>Why institute a prayer to be said only when Moshiach will be here (sort of Hilchasa LeMeshicha)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rambam's ruling is based on the Mishna in Rosh HaShana (26b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוה היובל לר\"ה לתקיעה ולברכות</p>\n  \n  <p>Yom Kippur of the Jubilee Year is the same as Rosh HaShana with regard to both the shofar blasts that are sounded and the additional blessings that are recited in the Amida prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The simple answer to your question is that the <em>Anshei <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Assembly\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Knesseth HaGedolah</a></em> enacted the <em>tefilloth</em> when the Second Temple still stood and when the <em>Yovel</em> was kept Rabbinically and to keep track of the <em>Shemittoth</em> (see Ramban [cited <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/26132\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here] </a>on Gittin 36a; see also Rabbeinu Tam, cited by Tosafoth <em>d\"h</em> \"<em>bizman</em>\", who held that Yovel was biblical law then too.)  </p>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://halakhah.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Arakhin</a> <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Arakhin.32b.51?lang=bi&p2=Ezra.2.64&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32b</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מקיש ביאתם בימי עזרא לביאתם בימי יהושע מה ביאתם בימי יהושע מנו שמיטין ויובלות וקדשו ערי חומה אף ביאתן בימי עזרא מנו שמיטין ויובלות וקדשו ערי חומה... ומי מנו שמיטין ויובלות השתא משגלו שבט ראובן ושבט גד וחצי שבט מנשה בטלו יובלות עזרא דכתיב ביה: (עזרא ב, סד) כל הקהל כאחד ארבע רבוא אלפים שלוש מאות ששים הוה מני דתניא: משגלו שבט ראובן ושבט גד וחצי שבט המנשה בטלו יובלות שנאמר: (ויקרא כה, י) \"וקראתם דרור בארץ לכל יושביה\" - בזמן שכל יושביה עליה ולא בזמן שגלו מקצתן. יכול היו עליה והן מעורבין - שבט בנימין ביהודה ושבט יהודה בבנימין, יהא יובל נוהג - תלמוד לומר: \"לכל יושביה\" בזמן שיושביה כתיקונן ולא בזמן שהן מעורבין. א\"ר נחמן בר יצחק: מנו יובלות לקדש שמיטין</p>\n  \n  <p>...he compares their arrival in the days of Ezra to their arrival in the days of Joshua: just as at their arrival in the days of Joshua they counted the years of release and the Jubilees, and consecrated cities encompassed by walls, thus also at their arrival in the days of Ezra they counted the years of release and the Jubilees. and consecrated walled cities... But did they count the years of release and Jubilees [after the return from Babylon]? If even after the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh went into exile, the Jubilees were abolished, should Ezra in connection with whom it is said: The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and three score, have counted them? For it was taught: When the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh went into exile, the Jubilees were abolished as it is said: And ye shall proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the inhabitants thereof, i.e., [only] at the time when all the inhabitants thereof dwell upon it, but not at the time when some of them are exiled. One might have assumed that if they were there, but intermingled, the tribe of Benjamin with that of Judah and the tribe of Judah with that of Benjamin, that even the [laws of the] Jubilee should apply, therefore it is said: ‘unto all the inhabitants thereof’, which means, only at the time when its inhabitants are there as [where] they ought to be, but not when they are intermingled! — Said R. Nahman b. Isaac: They counted the Jubilees to keep the years of release holy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Even if we had wanted, for some reason, to say it was enacted only for the future, we could still suggest that the enactment reflected the general idea of \"<em>mehera yibaneh hamikdash</em>\" which, at a practical level, reflects that when Moshiach comes, it might be useful to have laws already prepared, and, at a deeper level, reflects the daily aspirations and hopes of the exiled nation. </p>\n\n<p>See also, e.g., <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.30a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh haShana 30a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ושיהא יום הנף כולו אסור: מ\"ט מהרה יבנה בית המקדש ויאמרו אשתקד מי לא אכלנו בהאיר מזרח עכשיו נמי ניכול \n  ולא ידעי דאשתקד לא הוה עומר האיר מזרח התיר השתא דאיכא עומר עומר מתיר</p>\n  \n  <p>The mishna taught: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai also instituted that for the entire day of waving the omer offering, eating the grain of the new crop is prohibited. The Gemara asks: What is the reason for this ordinance? The reasoning is that soon the Temple will be rebuilt and people will say: Last year, when the Temple was in ruins, didn’t we eat from the new crop as soon as the eastern horizon was illuminated on the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan, as the new crop was permitted immediately? Now too, let us eat the new grain at that time.\n   And they do not know that last year, when there was no omer, the eastern horizon illuminating, i.e., the morning of the sixteenth of Nisan, served to permit the consumption of the new grain immediately. However, now that the Temple has been rebuilt and there is an omer offering, it is the omer that permits the consumption of the new grain. When the Temple is standing, the new grain is not permitted until the omer offering has been sacrificed. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I'll quote some of it.</p>\n\n<p>The Pnei Yehoshua suggests this point, that it is according to Rabi Yehuda who we do not rule with, is the reason the Rambam and other codifiers don't bring this down. Because we rule in accordance with Rabi Shimon and chametz she'aver alav haPesach is only assur on a rabbinical level for which we don't assume a person will not leave hetter and eat issur, and we cannot assume he switched it. </p>\n\n<p>There is further discussion on this see Rosh Yosef there and Shu't Pnei Yehoshua #13. </p>\n\n<p>A variant reason for the lack of this halacha is found in Beis Yosef Yo'd end of siman 115, that the gemara is only talking about a mixture of chametz that was aver haPesach. See also Chachmas Shlomo in Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim siman 443, who studs therefore it wasn't mentioned as we already know that law. And see Yeshuos Yaakov there as well.</p>\n\n<p>So in short, lihalacha, the leniency in that gemara does not apply to us.</p>\n\n<p>If however you are discussing a case where you actually know the piece of real chametz your friend is offering you is the actual chametz he had over Pesach, there is no room for any discussion of any leniency whatsoever see Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim #448 siff 3 & 5.</p>\n\n\n",

Yaakov Kamenetzky famously held that it was preferable to maintain a relationship with a Jewish nidda in light of Rambam's statement about sexual relationships with non-Jews. He writes in ch. 12 of Isuurei Biah:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עוון זה--אף על פי שאין בו מיתת בית דין, אל יהי קל בעיניך; אלא יש בו הפסד, שאין בכל העריות כמותו:  שהבן מן הערווה, בנו הוא לכל דבר; ובכלל ישראל ייחשב, ואף על פי שהוא ממזר.  והבן מן הגויה, אינו בנו--שנאמר \"כי יסיר את בנך מאחריי\" (דברים ז,ד), מסיר אותו מלהיות אחרי ה'.  [ח] ודבר זה גורם להידבק בגויים, שהבדילנו הקדוש ברוך הוא מהם, ולשוב מאחרי ה', ולמעול בו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the prohibition shouldnt be taken lightly as unlike other forbidden relations this draws products of this union away from God.\n As such R. Kamanetzky held that a relationship with a Jew is preferable.</p>\n\n<p>It should be noted that his reasoning might only apply to a long term relationship.\nAn additional concern would be that although technically more severe, the relationship with a Jew is easily rectifiable as she can just go to a mikveh. Even if she (or both) are unobservant they can transition gradually to observance. The relationship to a non-Jew however, itself places a major impediment in the way of tshuva. </p>\n\n\n",

Is such allowed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The links you provide have to do with giving up one's life to prevent committing a sin. I'll answer according to your question on rabbinical violations that carry a death penalty.</p>\n<p>There is a baraita found throughout the Talmud (such as Ber. 4b) which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל העובר על דברי חכמים חייב מיתה</p>\n<p>Anyone who transgresses the pronouncements of the Sages is liable to\nreceive the death penalty</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This statement does not mean that the courts can impose the death penalty on people who commit such transgressions. Most commentators understand the baraita as a way of underscoring the seriousness of rabbinical pronouncements, to the extent that one is worthy of  death if transgressing one.</p>\n<p>That said, there are no rabbinical laws punishable by <em>karet</em>. The list of sins punishable by <em>karet</em> can be found in the talmudic tractate devoted to this subject (<em>Keritot</em> 2a), and they all derive from the Torah.</p>\n<p>There is a potential caveat, however, that deserves mention. The Rambam <em>appears</em> to indicate that the courts could strike a sinner to death for transgressing a rabbinic law:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אסרו חכמים לאכול מצה בערב הפסח כדי שיהיה היכר לאכילתה בערב. ומי שאכל מצה בערב הפסח מכין אותו מכת מרדות <strong>עד שתצא</strong> <strong>נפשו</strong></p>\n<p>The Sages forbade a person from eating matzah on Pesach eve, in order for there to be a distinction between [partaking of it as food] and eating it on the evening [of the fifteen as a mitzvah.] Whoever eats matzah on Pesach eve is given \"stripes for rebellion\" <strong>until his soul expires</strong>. (Mishneh Torah, Chametz uMatzah 6:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many commentators have used the final clause (\"until his soul expires\") to understand the extent of rabbinical authority. The Ran, for example, uses Rambam's point to emphasize the first point I mentioned, borrowing language from the Mishnah (San. 11:3):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולפי דבריהם יש בזה חומר בדברי סופרים יותר מדברי תורה</p>\n<p>These words prove that the law is more severe with respect to the words of the Sages than to the words of the Torah.  (Ran on Rif, <em>Ketubot</em> 16b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is crucial to note, however, that the most authoritative manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah do not have \"until his soul expires\" in the text. It is a later addition not from the Rambam, and many contemporary publications of the Mishneh Torah do not include it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Pri Migadim in Orach Chaim siman 75 Mishbitzos Zahav #2 writes there is misa and kares midivrei sofrim (i.e. rabbinic) for public listening to kol isha of an (even?) unmarried akum.</p>\n<p>I don't understand how it could work technically, but he does say it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WCSxo.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/WCSxo.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

Shimon Fuerst wrote a pamphlet called <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/22633\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tenu Kavod LaTorah</a> in which he discusses how Talmudic students should learn Gemara. His major thesis is that many students upon leaving yeshiva give up on learning Gemara because the style of learning promoted in yeshivos is not conducive to actually amassing a significant amount of Torah knowledge. He says that when these people realize that they were in yeshiva for 10 years and don't actually know much, and can hardly even \"learn a daf Gemara b'peshitus\" they simply give up. His solution is to revamp the way Gemara learning is done in yeshiva, with at least 100 (two-sided) pages studied per semester.

Here is one excerpt (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22633&st=&pgnum=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p.11</a>) that is representative of the point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והחילוק יהיה רק זאת שאותן מאה דפים ידעו היטב גם עם הראשונים עם הרשב\"א\n  והריטב\"א וכשיבואו לביתם לבקש איזהו פרנסה אם גם לא יזכרו אלף דפים גמרא\n  הדק היטב אבל ידיעת התורה בהרבה ענינים בש\"ס יהיה להם בודאי ולא יפסוק\n  מחמת זה החשק ללמוד להלן אחר שעזבו את דלתות הישיבה</p>\n  \n  <p>ולא יהיה עוד כדבר הלזה שאנו רואין היום שאחר שלמדו עשרה שנים בישיבה לא\n  ידעו ללמוד בעצמן דף גמרא וזאת רק זאת גרם שאינן פותחין עוד גמרא כל ימי\n  חייהן שאינן מרגישיו שום חיות בלימוד גמרא והטעם מחמת שאינם יודעים מאומה</p>\n  \n  <p>The difference will be only this – that those 100 pages they will know\n  well, even with rishonim, with the Rashba and the Ritva, and when they\n  come to their houses to seek out a livelihood even if they don't\n  remember 1,000 pages of Gemara very well they will certainly at least\n  have Torah knowledge in many topics in Shas, and they won't cease on\n  account of this their desire to learn later on after they have left\n  the doors of the yeshiva.</p>\n  \n  <p>And there will no longer be something like this, where we see today\n  that after learning for 10 years in yeshiva they don't know how to\n  learn on their own a page of Gemara. This and only this causes them\n  not to open a Gemara again for the rest of their lives, because they\n  don't feel any vitality in learning Gemara, the reason being that they\n  don't know anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R Yehuda Greenwald wrote a small booklet called \"Torah study\" under the direction of R Shlomo Wolbe (I have it in French, it is part of <a href=\"http://www.torah-box.com/editions/guide-de-la-techouva_154.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> larger book).</p>\n\n<p>In it he writes that learning gemara should be the main focus of any Jew. However it is just as critical to learn Humash, Halakha, Hassidut and Musar - all in just proportions and depending on the individual. He recommends 50-60% of time dedicated to gemara, the rest to other disciplines. And insists on the importance of getting advice from a learned rav that knows the person well.</p>\n\n<p>He explicitly discusses the case of many adults who get discouraged after a few years of learning gemara when they realize they won't become the <em>talmidei chachamim</em> they were hoping to be and don't actually enjoy the learning that much. He recommends avoiding to \"take refuge\" only in learning humash, hassidut and musar but believes a certain balance is important.</p>\n\n<p>I also heard directly from R Levi Azimov (who oversees 120 <em>batei Habad</em> in the Paris area) that learning gemara only is too dry and that a Jew needs \"something to warm his neshama in parallel\" (his words), e.g., in-depth humash and hasidut.</p>\n\n\n",

The adoptive parents are a frum couple who are told the baby's mother is Jewish by reputable sources. They are full believers in the truth of this information.</p>\n\n<p>They raise their daughter, Beis Yaakov, seminary in Yerushalayim, marries a Cohen, and b\"h, eventually two baby boys. Both undergo bris according to Halakah. </p>\n\n<p>The woman's boys too grow up, go to yeshiva, receive simcha, chuppa, kollel, and have children of their own.</p>\n\n<p>As the years pass their mother begins looking for her birth parents, only to find out to her astonishment, after years and years of searching, that her birth mother was indeed, not Jewish. </p>\n\n<p>What is her halakhic standing? That of her sons? What is their standing? That of their Kohan status? Their smichas? Their own children? Must a conversion to be done to all three generations? Must a bris be redone? Do any other problems arise in your minds?

If she wasn't a convert than her sons are not Jewish. In either case the sons children are Jewish (as their mothers are Jewish) but the daughters should not marry kohanim (either because they are chalalot or because their father is not Jewish).

    "content": "# Inadvertant Sin of Prohibited Food or Relations\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the explanation of the talmudic dictum (Sanhedrin 62b, Kreisos 19b) that one who inadvertently sins in the areas of forbidden foods or sexual relations (e.g. reaches for kosher food, misses it and instead puts non-kosher in his mouth) must bring a korban chatas because \"he received pleasure\" even though other sins would be exempt from a korban in this case? What characteristic do these sins share that gives them a this unique legal status? How are these sins different from e.g. shatnez which seems to also dependent on pleasure (see Yevamos 4b)?</p>\n\n<p>Some Acharonim (e.g. R. Elchonon Wasserman in Kovetz Shiurim) explain that the prohibition is actually the pleasure itself, not the act, so the disconnect from the act through lack of intent doesn't exempt them. I wondered if Rishonim hold of this or perhaps have some chiddush about korban chatas, or perhaps a different explanation.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One can characterize the general rule of \"mis'asek\" as stating that an act is not attributable to a person if the person lacks a conscious state of mind associating him to the act. An inadvertent act is disconnected from and thus not attributed to the person because the person had no conscious, mental connection to it. For an act to be associated to you it must be a conscious act.</p>\n\n<p>Things which involve pleasure, such as eating and sexual relations, are by definition not mis'asek, because pleasure is a conscious state. Any act which involves pleasure is thus by definition a conscious act.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>Asvun De'Oraisah</strong> (R' Yosef Engel, 19th C., <em>siman</em> 24) gives a similar approach to R' Elchanan- pleasure-based sins have no \"disconnect\" through lack of intention. </p>\n\n<p>However, see Rosh Hashana 28a (at the end of the page), which states that <em>kavana</em> for <em>mitzvos</em> should not be needed for <em>mitzvas matza</em>, \"<strong>as he ate</strong>\". Rashi explains: </p>\n\n<p>\"And he benefited, so it's not <em>mitsasek</em>, just like with <strong>prohibited foods and relations</strong>.\" </p>\n\n<p>R' Yosef Engel points out that according to his own approach, Rashi is impossible to understand. He writes that it's unreasonable to say that <em>mitzvas matzo</em> requires one to be derive pleasure from the <em>matza</em>, so the comparison to prohibited foods/relations cannot be made.</p>\n\n<p>It would seem that Rashi understands that pleasure <strong>in itself</strong> prevents the disconnect between the act and the person, preventing the <em>p'tur</em> of* <em>mis'asek</em>. As such it is relevant even to <em>matza</em>, as there too pleasure is experienced and disconnect prevented.</p>\n\n<p>(As an aside, Rashi is, even without this, difficult to understand- <em>kavana</em> for mitzvos is not just needed to \"connect\" to the act- even intending the act is not enough if it isn't done <em>leshem mitzva</em>, <em>vetzarich iyun</em>.) </p>\n\n\n",

First there's a lot of celebrations - like weddings -and then the people start feeling happy, as they fully realize the extent of the redemption.</p>\n<p>When describing the events in Shushan, the <strong>Megila</strong> first states וְהָעִיר שׁוּשָׁן צָהֲלָה וְשָׂמֵחָה that the non-Jews in the city made loud happy noise and then started feeling happy. But by the Jews - in the next Pasuk -  it says לַיְּהוּדִים הָיְתָה אוֹרָה וְשִׂמְחָה וְשָׂשֹׂן וִיקָר. They first <em>felt lighter</em>, then felt happy, and only then started singing and dancing and feeling proud again.</p>\n<p>More Malbim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ישעיה פרק-לה</p>\n<p><strong>א:</strong> יששום ותגל. <strong>הששון</strong>, גדרו הסימנים החיצונים שיעשה להוראת השמחה ויו''ט כמו משוש כנור, משוש תופים, שמן ששון. והפוכו הסימנים שיעשו לסימן אבל שמן ששון תחת אבל (לק' סג), ולפעמים <strong>יש ששון בלא שמחה</strong>, הלובש בגדי יו''ט ולפניו תוף וכנור, ונפשו עליו תאבל. ויש <strong>שמחה וגיל בלא ששון</strong>, הלובש בגדי אבל ויגיל וישמח בלבבו, לכן אמר ישיש עליך בשמחה\n(צפניה ג')  וישישו בשמחה (תהלות סח ד'). ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I believe it is the Gra who explains that Sasson refers to open, outer joy while Simcha refers to inner joy.</p>\n\n<p>You can explain the Pasuk as prioritizing one over the other, or suggesting which led to the other.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Judaism only intellectual or is it emotional?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Perhaps anecdotal, but common enough that many should be able to verify from their own anecdotal experience:</p>\n<p>There seems to be a lot of focus on the superiority of intellectualism over the heart in yeshivot. The vast majority of the time is spent on using our intellect to study gemara and halacha, and a small fraction is spent on working on our character. Even that is done in a very \"lamdus\" sort of way. Learning and discussing the heart and emotions is very rare. There is a common sentiment that the yeshivish world is about the intellect, and other demoninations are \"more emotional\", etc.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Is Judaism only <em>intellectual</em> or is it <em>emotional</em>?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If one <em>does</em> want to understand where emotions fit into Torah study, and work on their emotions and feelings, what should one study? For example, what should one do in order to reach a level where they can feel an emotional attachment with G-d (i.e. the <em>Shechinah</em>) like the Jews <strong>felt</strong> at <em>Har Sinai</em>?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Judaism is emotional as well as intellectual. Even the highly rationalist Rambam wrote <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=l5hz_n-XGg0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=jewish%20spiritual%20practices&hl=en&sa=X&ei=O6DjVJPxCJP5yQS0tIHYCQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22we%20should%20love%20him%20with%22&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">beautiful passages</a> about we should love and yearn for God like one does regarding a desired romantic partner. Early mussar seforim, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chovot_HaLevavot#Love_of_God\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chovos HaLevavos</a>, are focused to a large extent on developing intense love for God. The Ramak's <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:vLd__-JEfbIJ:www.israel613.com/books/TOMER_DEVORAH_E.pdf%20&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-a\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tomer Devorah</a> is full of references to the importance of being full of love for God and all His creatures. </p>\n\n<p>As for how to feel an emotional attachment to God, a variety of ways have been explained, from the earliest mussar seforim to more recent Chassidic philosophy. The encyclopedic volume <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=l5hz_n-XGg0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=jewish%20spiritual%20practices&hl=en&sa=X&ei=O6DjVJPxCJP5yQS0tIHYCQ&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=jewish%20spiritual%20practices&f=false\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jewish Spiritual Practices</a> by Rabbi Yitzhok Buxbaum is a wonderful resource for Chassidic teachings on this general subject (and also includes some classical and Litvish sources as well, such as many quotes from the Litvish mystic Rabbi Alexander Zyskind.) </p>\n\n<p>I am not sure whether any of these sources talk of reaching the level of how Jews felt at Har Sinai, but experiencing the Glory of God is sometimes mentioned in mystical sources. The Tanya describes at length the process of awakening an all-consuming love for God, including through contemplating His greatness in particular ways. The Bilvavi (Rabbi Itamar Schwartz) <a href=\"http://www.bilvavi.net/english/bilvavi-part-1-section-6-love-hashem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">discusses</a> how to cultivate love of God, based in part on the works of Rabbi Alexander Zyskind.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>... Yes. </p>\n\n<p>Judaism demands both intellectual (atah haresa <strong>lada'as</strong>) and emotional (tachas asher lo avadata es hashem elokecha <strong>bisimcha uvituv levav</strong>) engagement.</p>\n\n<p>Reaching the level of feeling of Har Sinai may not be entirely reasonable as a daily practice to engage in for the average individual. However, anyone may feel an emotional attachment to Hashem by reading and concentrating on the words of tefillah and bringing them into his heart, thinking about the wonders of the creation and all that Hashem does and continues to do for us.</p>\n\n<p>\"Talking\" to Hashem on a regular basis outside of tefillah is a very easy way to feel attachment to Hashem. I find that stopping for a few seconds to close my eyes and my mind to the world and concentrating while saying/thinking repeatedly <strong><em>\"I love you\"</em></strong> is probably the most powerful way to jump start that feeling of love. Just like it's also a powerful thing to do in a relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Probably the hardest part of prayer is drawing the emotional feeling from the heart, which is why it is called an <strong><em>avodah shebalev.</em></strong> As an actor, I found that approaching tefillah as a script was <strong><em>very</em></strong> conducive to developing my ability to engage in it with emotion. Bow here, say this, move there, sit down. Anyone can read the words of a script, but as an actor (Jew), your job is to take those actions and lines (prayers) and invest them with as much reality and meaning you can. When you manage to accomplish that, the emotion naturally flows.</p>\n\n<p>As always, there will be good and bad days, performances and prayers where your head or heart \"wasn't in it,\" or \"the energy wasn't there,\" or where you flub a line in what <strong><em>was</em></strong> a perfect \"show.\" The key is to keep pushing forward, keep practicing, and keep in mind how valuable and important what you are doing is.</p>\n\n\n",

We know from the midrash that at the end of days the righteous will feed on it, whatever it is.</p>\n\n<p>One could argue that because the righteous will feed on it, it must be a kosher fish.  Or if the leviathan is a serpent, one could argue that when God holds this end-of-days banquet He can declare anything He wants to be permitted, culinarily speaking -- the laws of kashrut as we know them don't apply.

The proof is that the Beheimos will not have a proper slaughtering, but will rather be killed by the Liviason. The medrash goes on to prove that Liviason is an abnormal strong creature, capable of killing Beheimos.</p>\n\n<p>But throughout the entire discussion of proving that slaughtering will become obsolete, the medrash does not entertain the idea that Beheimos or Liviason are not kosher. </p>\n\n<p>The Vayikra Rabba in chapter 22 states explicitly that it is kosher.</p>\n\n<p>The Bavli in Chulin 67b says it is a kosher fish. The Maharsha asks would Hashem ever feed his Tzadikim nonkosher fish? He answers that the gemara is clarifying that Liviason is in fact a fish and not some other creature like a bird. The Iyun Yaakov answers this question by pointing to Yalkut on Shmini 535 and on Tehilim siman 146, that in fact in the future Hashem will allow what was not allowed beforehand and a New Torah will be given from Tzion. The Aruch ערך גא says the gemara needed to tell us it was kosher because it is mentioned along with a snake, so as to preclude the assumption that it is not kosher like a snake, we have the drasha in the gemara. </p>\n\n\n",

He also says that the one listening has to be careful not to actually believe it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to R. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menahem HaMeiri</a> the definition of l'shon hara, is speech that is meant to be defamatory or hurtful. Thus, statements of a negative nature that are said for a positive reason (for example to relieve ones streff and unload on one's spouse), and not to hurt others, are permissible since by definition they are not <em>l'shon hara</em>. These are his words in is Hibbur HaTeshuva (Meshiv Nefesh I:4):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עקר לשון הרע הוא המתמיד לספר בגנות האחרים ויתן דפי בענינים או שילעג להם למעוט הצלחתם...ומעין זה מי שילעיג על חבריו למעוט השגתם בידיעה...<strong>לכונת לעג וליצנות</strong>...<strong>וכלל הדברים כל אשר יתן מום באדם...ללא כונת ענין נבחר הוא ענין לשון הרע</strong>...<strong>שאין לספר במומי בני האדם על דרך לעג וליצנות, אם לא יעשה כן...לאיזו כונה</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The archetypal <em>l'shon hara</em> is one who frequently relates embarrassing things about others, and adds falsehood to what he says, or he defames them on their lack of success...And similarly one who defames his fellows on their lack of intellect for the purpose of defamation and mockery...The rule is that anyone who ascribes a fault to others...without some specific intent is <em>l'shon hara</em>...For one should not relate the faults of others in context of defamation and mockery, unless he is speaking for some purpose. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it does not appear that speech without malicious intent, such as in the question would be l'shon hara according to Meiri.</p>\n\n<p>This also appears to be the opinion of this is also the opinion of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elchonon_Wasserman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Elhanan Wasserman</a>, who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot. He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך... \n  וכן בלאו דלא תלך רכיל, מותר לספר לה\"ר על בעלי מחלוקת כדי להשקיט המריבה. וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים... \n  ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת  </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And so too with the prohibition of gossiping, it is permitted to tell <em>l'shon hara</em> on disputants to quell the dispute...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse]...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Importantly, they do not attach conditions to to'elet, as the Haffets Hayyim famously does.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the eminent modern day halakhic authority, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osher_Weiss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Asher Weiss</a> Shlit\"a writes in Minhat Asher to Leviticus (p. 268) that to'elet renders speech permissible and not l'shon hara, by definition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באיסורי תורה צריך לדון בדיני דחיה האם תועלת זו ראויה לדחות איסור ...אבל בהלכות לשה\"ר לאו מדין דחיה אתינן עלה, אלא יסוד האיסור תלוי במדה רעה וכל שכונתו לטובה...ולא לרעתו אין בזה עבירה כלל, ודו\"ק בכ\"ז כי לענ\"ד ברור הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>With Torah prohibitions one must evaluate with the laws of <em>dehiya</em> [prioritisation], whether this <em>to'elet</em> [purpose] is sufficient to supersede a prohibition. But with the laws of <em>l'shon hara</em>, we are not utilising the law of supercession. Rather, the very definition of the prohibition depends on negative character traits, and anything in which his intent is for good...and not for someone else's harm, has no prohibition whatsoever, and consider all of this, for in my humble opinion, it is clear.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He shows that this is the opinion of Rashi (Moed Katan 16a s.v. amar lei la'avuha) and sharply disputes (p. 267) the Hafets Hayyim's attempt at escaping the implication of Rashi:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בחפץ חיים...כתב...ודבריו קשים לכאו' דמלבד שאין הדברים מתיישבים בלשון רש\"י</p>\n  \n  <p>However in Haffets Hayyim...he wrote...and his words appear difficult, for besides for the fact that his words don't fit with Rashi's wording...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>[Like R. Elhanan, he connects this to the idea that interpersonal mitsvot in general are by definition only prohibited when they are malicious. (In particular he connects this to the prohibition of overcharging, see p. 267)].</p>\n\n<p>Importantly, he clarifies (p. 267) that there are limits to the limitation of <em>l'shon hara</em> to cases of malicious intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דשאני המספר לשה\"ר דרך קלות ראש דהרי פושע גמור ובזה ודאי עובר בחטא כיון שהדברים מצד עצמם הם לשה\"ר גמור ובדרך שחוק וקלות ראש מנבל הוא את פיו בכה\"ג פושע הוא אף שלא התכוין להרע לחבירו</p>\n  \n  <p>For it is different if a person speaks <em>l'shon hara</em> with frivolity, since the matters are intrinsically <em>l'shon hara</em> and in the context of frivolity and levity, he pollutes his mouth. In such a case, he is a willful sinner even though he didn't intent to harm his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is: \"I was just having a good time\", isn't a legitimate excuse to speak disparagingly about someone. However, by all indications, speaking when there is some specific purpose, such as relieving stress, would be fine.</p>\n\n\n",

Note that it commences by asserting what will happen in <em>those</em> days (בימים ההמה), which the Radak interprets to mean the time of the moshiach. If, in the time of the moshiach, people are to be punished for the things that they <em>had</em> done, those things may not have yet transpired in human history - certainly not at the time of the prophet, and perhaps not yet from our perspective either.</p>\n\n<p>An indication of this ambiguity can be found also in the Radak, who mentions two interpretations of this passage: one, that it happened while the Judeans were still residing in their land; and the other, that it happened after the destruction of the temple when they were in exile. By contrast, the Malbim sees it as something that happened during the time of the temple's destruction itself. Since the passage is so vague, it could have happened at any time, or could also be something that has not (yet) happened at all.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it possible that Judaism would one day allow eating pork?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as I understand, pork was originally banned from consumption since it was hard to maintain a clean enviroment for pigs in a desert climate (as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_restrictions_on_the_consumption_of_pork#Prohibition_of_pork_consumption_in_Jewish_law\" rel=\"noreferrer\">summarized</a> in the Wikipedia).</p>\n\n<p>Since nowadays there is a much better understanding of how diseases transmit and modern technology for keeping animals healthy and clean, is it possible that pork would be allowed for consumption sometime in the future?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>There is an Agadic opinion brought in Or Hachaim in parshas Shmini 11:7 that after the arrival of Moshiach, the pig will begin to chew its cud, and will at that point be Kosher.* Until that day, the Torah clearly gave two signs which we base our dietary laws upon which cannot be ignored.</p>\n\n<p>Whether or not Rabbis throughout the ages have tried to make keeping Mitzvos more palatable by giving reasons for them or showing how good it is for us to keep them doesn't detract from the fact that they are statutes of the King.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically concerning pig, while the Ramban explained a good point of not eating it was the diseases associated with it, it should be noted that Rambam (Moreh Nevuchim 3:48) singled the pig (and fats) out as the one nonkosher animal which people claimed could not be explain through scientific reasons why it should not be allowed. He went on to explain his opinion of why it is unhealthy.</p>\n\n<p>The Chinuch in mitzvah 73 gives a general overview of Hashem's dietary laws which he himself references in mitzvah #154 concerning unclean animals, he says 'And if there are any reasons for the dietary laws which are unknown to us or those knowledgeable in the health field, do not wonder about them, for the true Healer that Werner us against them is smarter than us, and smarter than the doctors'.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi listed pig as one of chukim, laws who's reasons are not known and our evil inclination and nonjew tell us make no sense, and therefore the Torah gave a special admonition with the words 'I am Hashem', see parshas Acharei Mos 18:4.</p>\n\n<p>See also Rashi in parshas Kodshim 20:26 'do not say I am disgusted com pig, rather say I would like it but my Father in heaven has prohibited me'.</p>\n\n<p>*An interesting idea based on this is found in Chassam Soffer in Toras Moshe parshas Re'eh pg 33 and in Chassam Sofer al HaTorah parshas Shmini pg 101. He says according to the midrashim that pig will become kosher in the future, pig meat today which gets mixed into kosher should not be battul being that it is a davar sheyeish lo matirin, see Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah siman 102. He says this is not true. It's not that a mitzvah will be annulled and pig flesh will suddenly become allowed, but rather at that future time pigs will become ruminating animals and by that fact will from then on be kosher. But the flesh of  any pig which had died before then will remain nonkosher, and as such pig meat is not a davar sheyeish lo mattirin. Sorry for jargon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 13)\n\n<p><strong>No.</strong> Pigs are singled out by the Torah (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.11.7\">Leviticus 11:7</a>) as one of the unkosher animals that have a single kosher sign (they have split hooves but don't chew their cud), and as such, are Biblically prohibited. A Biblical prohibition cannot be overturned (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Foundations_of_the_Torah.9.1\">Rambam's Laws of Foundations of the Torah 9:1</a>).</p>\n\n<p>(According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut#Philosophical_explanations\">some</a>,) the kashrut laws were not instated for health reasons -- they are laws given by God to separate us from the nations.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>No, pigs will not be kosher food, not even when pigs learn to fly -- well, at least not until the Messiah comes or science finds a way to change the pig from a pig into something else a bit different. </p>\n\n<p>The Torah prohibits animals that can be eaten based on physical characteristics.  Leviticus <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9912/jewish/Chapter-11.htm#v=1\">11:1-32</a>.  A kosher animal among mammals must have a cloven hoof and chew its cud.  Lev. 11:3.  The Torah goes on to give us examples:  a camel, a badger, and a hare are forbidden because they chew their cuds, but do not have a cloven hooves.  Lev. 11:4-6. The swine is given as the opposite case because it has a parted hoof but does not chew its cud.  Lev. 11:7. The Torah gives us no other reason, certainly no health reasons.  And I am unaware of any health reasons that make it unsafe to eat camels, badgers or hares.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, it is not within our authority to change the Law if we wanted to.  <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9968#v=2\">Deut. 4:2</a> states that we can neither add nor subtract to the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The story could change when the Messiah comes and as for that there is some dispute.  The midrash on Lev. 11:says that the reason that the pig is called “chazir” is because in the future Hashem will return (lehachzir) the pig to Bnei Yisrael and permit it to be eaten. According to many Achronim the midrash is to be taken literally; pig will be kosher in the future. The Rama Mipano (Asarah Mamaros Chikor Hadin 4:13) explains that Hashem will make the pig chew its cud, thereby making it kosher.  Critics of this point, however, argue that there is a rigid guideline that prevents this, citing the Gemara at Bechoros 5b, “hayotzei min hatamei, tamei – anything that comes from a non-kosher animal is not kosher.” Therefore if a non-kosher animal gives birth to a kosher animal (which has the kosher signs), it is forbidden to be eaten.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/will-pig-eventually-be-kosher/2012/04/18/\">Rabbi Raphael Fuchs</a>, Rambam (Maimonedes) would say that a genetically-engineered pig that chews its cud would also be prohibited because it is not one of the ten explicitly-permitted animals mentioned in the Torah. Hilchos Machalos Asuros 2:3. Any other animal (even if it has the kosher signs) is prohibited to be eaten because it is a lav haba michlal assei (when the Torah says you should do this it is inferred that it is prohibited to do otherwise – and the Torah says to eat these animals). It is for this reason that humans are prohibited to be eaten, since they are not one of the animals explicitly mentioned in the pasuk. However, if you hold that way it would seem to me that you also can't eat turkey because it is not mentioned in the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So, how do we explain the midrash? The Radvaz (Teshuvos 2:828) explains that the midrash is not to be taken literally; rather it should be understood that in the future Bnei Yisrael will eat mashmanim, as if eating pig was permissible. Rabbeinu Bichaiya also explains that the intention of the midrash was not to say that pig will become permitted for consumption in the future, but rather that the midrash is referring to the kingdom of Edom (which is referred to as the chazir) – that Hashem will eventually return (lehachzir) on them midas hadin (judgment). The Ritva (Kiddushin 49b) explains that the midrash is referring to Amalek.</p>\n\n<p>There are opinions that suggest that a genetically-engineered pig (made with kosher signs) could be kosher if it was born of another genetically-engineered pig.  This assumes the rabbinic principal that something born of a forbidden item cannot become permitted.  Menachos 21a (example, boiled animal blood would technically be kosher according to the Torah, but since blood in its natural state is forbidden, rabbinically, we can not eat boiled blood, either).  But once genetically-engineered pigs are born, they would become permitted to be parents of kosher little pigs.  See this <a href=\"http://www.jewishpress.com/judaism/parsha/will-pig-eventually-be-kosher/2012/04/18/\">article from the Jewish Press</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

See there and in the Beit Yosef for how all the different Rishonim come out on the matter. The Rosh posits a compromise, whereby Asher Yatzar is recited after the first of the two pourings of water on the hands, where your hands are clean enough to say a Bracha, but are not ritually pure for bread.

I (and most other too probably) have been brought up with the belief that it is forbidden for a girl to walk around indecently. What that exactly is depends on whom you ask, with many opinions saying a skirt must reach 4 inches below the knee.</p>\n\n<p>Where does anyone even mention such an Issur in the Torah before 100 years ago?</p>\n\n<p>Here are some Pshatim I have heard.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Most people tend to quote the Issur of praying in front of an Ervah, however this is an Issur on Dvorim Shebikdusha and does not dictate how a lady must dress?  </p></li>\n<li><p>People bandy about with the term  לִפְנֵ֣י עִוֵּ֔ר לֹ֥א תִתֵּ֖ן מִכְשֹׁ֑ל (Lifnei Iver Loh Siten Michshol). However this should then subject it to the many rules of Lifnei Iver, upon which many leniencies should then apply. For example, one could say there are other ways a man has access to Hirhur and Histaklus, even if those would actually cost him money (Rema 151:1)</p></li>\n<li><p>Another Pshat I heard is that like the Gemoro deduces a woman must cover her hair from the fact it says Uporah Rosh HaIsha, so too we can deduct that she must cover her body because it says you shall uncover her top. This seems to me like a nice Vort, but I dont think we can make Droshos for ourselves.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Is it simply common sense but it was too obvious to be recorded in Halacha? If so, where do the Shiurim of x amount of inches come from? Was it common sense to use the Ervah guidelines used for Dvarim Shebikdusha?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I still feel the question of \"sources for indecent dress by women\" deserves a better treatment than we (including me) provided up to now.

All agree that certain areas of the\n  body fall under the Torah prohibition, while others may be drabanan,\n  or depend on custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The key gemara on <em>tzniut</em> is from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.24a.68?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Brakhot 24a</a> which defines erva as a woman's <em>shok</em> (leg), voice and hair (see RYHH p. 1).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Hisda said: The calf of a woman's leg is to be regarded as\n  nakedness; as it is said, \"Uncover the leg, pass through the rivers\"\n  (Is. xlvii. 2) and it continues, \"Thy nakedness shall be uncovered,\n  yea, your shame shall be seen\" (Is. xlvii. 3).\n  <br><br>Samuel said: a woman's\n  voice is to be regarded as nakedness; as it is said, \"For sweet is\n  your voice, and your countenance is comely\" (Cant. ii. 14).\n  <br><br>Rav Sheshet\n  said: A woman's hair is to be regarded as nakedness; as it is said,\n  \"Your hair is as a flock of goats\" (ibid. iv. 1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rishonim will debate if the <em>shok</em> is above or below the knee, i.e., the thigh or calf. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Isaiah.47.2.1-2?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a> on <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.47.2?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 47:2</a> mentions the arm (<em>zroa</em>) as <em>erva</em> and <em>poskim</em> will similarly debate the extent to which the arm should be covered (see RYHH p. 8).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The details of <em>tzniut</em> laws vary from time to time and community to community. The notion of differentiating between <em>dat Moshe</em> (Torah law) and <em>dat Yehudit</em> (custom) in the context of erva comes from <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.72a.86?lang=he&layout=block&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ktubot 72a-b</a> according to many Rishonim (see RYHH p. 12).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Mishna) What is dat yehudit? If she goes outside her home with her hair\n  uncovered.</p>\n  \n  <p>(Gemara) Going out with her hair uncovered is a Biblical\n  prohibition for it is written \"he shall uncover the head of the\n  woman\". And a Tanna in the academy of R Yishmael taught \"This is a\n  warning to Jewish daughters that they should not go out with their\n  head uncovered\".</p>\n  \n  <p>Biblically it is sufficient to cover her hair with her\n  head-basket [which allows hair to show through] But in accordance to\n  <em>dat yehudit</em> it is prohibited for her even to go out with her head-based [rather a more thorough covering is required]\n  (translation Artscroll)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Indeed the Shulchan Aruch (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.75?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OC 75:1</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Even_HaEzer.73?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"noreferrer\">EH 73:1</a>) doesn't detail the specific laws of <em>tzniut</em> but refers to local practices and local places.

This is true regarding some parts of a woman's body\n  which must be covered (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 75:1). Nonetheless,\n  there are other parts which must be covered regardless of communal\n  standards.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Mishna Brura draws the line at the elbow and the knee (75:2). Some\n  interpret \"shok\" (Berachos 24a) as the calf (since the thigh is called\n  yerech), and include it in objective erva (see Chazon Ish Orach Chaim\n  16:8). Yet others imply that since the requirement to cover the arms\n  and legs is das Yehudis (Kesubos 72a), i.e. a custom of Jewish women\n  (Rashi), it may be subject to change (see Kaf Hachayim 75:2, Igros\n  Moshe Even Hoezer 1:69). Sha'ar Hatziyun 75:5 disagrees.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, a woman's torso is certainly ervah (see Rambam Krias Shma\n  3:16), and must be covered. Unfortunately, many otherwise observant\n  women follow fashions, such as very low necklines, which expose the\n  flesh inappropriately. Women who wear tight-fitting clothes which\n  explicitly delineate a woman's figure are also in violation, as the\n  Midrash, contrasting Rus and the other women, implies (see Kuntres\n  Dinei Malbush Nashim page 12, 13).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://www.rabbimanning.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Hilchot-Tzniut-Part-1.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/modesty-tzniut/#\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for further sources.</p>\n\n\n",

While not directly indicating what the halacha is, he implies that from the wording, the concept is that the parents should tell the story of Pesach at night specifically when Matzah and Maror are in front of him. Keep in mind that there was no concept of a \"Seder\" at the time the Torah was given. What is also apparent from the placement of the verse, is that the previous verse says that you should eat Matzah for seven days, and a key phrase in this verse (the one you cited) is \"ba'avur zeh\" - because of THIS - meaning it is an answer to why we eat Matzah - at least, immediately. Rash\"i also explains that this is an answer to the wicked son, a concept developed later, as the 4 sons are part of the Seder.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to answer the rest of your questions - you raise a valid point, and this has been addressed in the past. I refer you to <a href=\"http://www.lookstein.org/online_journal.php?id=16\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> . Within it, he mentions these points:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Citing Mishnah Pesachim, 10th Chapter, it says:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When the second cup of wine is poured, it is expected that the child,\n  curious about what has transpired, will begin questioning. If the\n  child is not aware enough to notice the differences, his father is to\n  prod him with a series of observations – “Look at how different\n  tonight is from all other nights!” The continuation of the Mishnaic\n  description states that the father should teach his child according to\n  the child's ability to understand, and suggests that the teaching\n  begin with an exploration of how bad things were before they got\n  better. Finally, the Mishnah adds that part of the seder should\n  include an expounding of the Torah portion beginning with the\n  description of the wandering Aramean.</p>\n  \n  <p>Let us consider what preparation this child had for this event. Was\n  the child trained in advance to memorize a series of questions he\n  would perform for the assembled? Apparently not, as the Mishnah seems\n  to suggest that the questions are spontaneous. In fact, there is no\n  fixed text for the questions the child asks, only for the father whose\n  child has failed to notice the changes at the table.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So, it seems clear that you are correct that the commandment is for the parents to teach children and not in reverse.</p>\n\n<p>The author suggests the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Creating a contemporary educational program for the seder needs to\n  focus on the parents as much as on the children, restoring the\n  parent's role as a key transmitter of an oral tradition, and should\n  account for the essentially non-text component of the evening. In the\n  younger grades, model seders should be held for parents, and not their\n  children. Educational packets should present parents with the tools\n  for leading a seder which positions the children at the center of an\n  inquisitive process directed by the parents; as their children grow,\n  parents need to be taught how to encourage their children to ask more\n  substantive questions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I also recommend reading the <a href=\"http://lookstein.org/lookjed/read.php?1,5185,5194#msg-5194\" rel=\"nofollow\">related blog</a> to the article, as some of the writers offer supplemental ideas. In one of the emails, the author of the article adds this story:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I have been told that in the late Forties and Fifties Rav Avigdor\n  Miller  would tell the members of his Shul that they should make sure\n  at the Seder  to listen to what their children had learned in yeshiva.\n  During those  years the majority of the members of his Shul did not\n  have extensive  yeshiva educations.</p>\n  \n  <p>On the other hand, a grandson of his told me that at his Seder Rav\n  Miller  would go through the Haggadah, and focus on explaining only a\n  few key  points. When a grandchild would say \"My rebbe said,\" Rav\n  Miller would  smile and say, \"Let's wait until later to hear what he\n  said.\" He would  then move on, continuing the Haggadah narrative. The\n  grandson told me that  he never recalled \"later\" coming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary - you raised an important question, and I hope the article addresses your concerns. With that, wishes for a Happy and educational Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

This answer is based on that experience; see also the <a href=\"http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-communities/professional-resources/guidelines-for-rabbis-working-with-prospective-gerim/\">CCAR's guidelines for conversion</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>beit din</em> will, nearly universally, require successful completion of an introduction-to-Judaism class early in the process (~3 hours/week for 6 months or so).  This class covers key observances (Shabbat, kashrut, tefila, holidays, etc), ethical mitzvot, communal obligations, and history.  It may also include direct torah study, but my understanding is that this is mostly done in the congregation or with one's rabbi, not in the intro class that's a little more \"nuts and bolts\".</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the class the candidate will meet, probably weekly or biweekly, with the sponsoring rabbi for personal instruction.  This is where a lot of theology, philosophy, and torah get covered, and is usually a discussion (with the rabbi probing the candidate) rather than the \"frontal presentation\" of a classroom.  The candidate is also expected to participate regularly in the congregation.  (Also, somewhere in there, the candidate learns basic <em>siddur</em> Hebrew.)</p>\n\n<p>So by the time the <em>beit din</em> is convened, the sponsoring rabbi is already pretty confident that the candidate meets the knowledge requirements (and will have discussed this with the other rabbis on the <em>beit din</em>).  Locally (I don't know how common this is), there is also a written exam that is submitted before the <em>beit din</em> convenes.  So most of the time with the <em>beit din</em> isn't spent on assessing knowledge, because that's already been covered.</p>\n\n<p>What <em>do</em> they spend the time on?  Anything that is a particular concern for a given candidate (special family situations, etc) will be addressed, but beyond that, areas of questioning are likely to include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Why do you want to do this?  What's wrong with being a righteous gentile?</p></li>\n<li><p>If the candidate is an ex-Christian, questions about giving that up, probing for what the candidate really thinks about Jesus, relationships with Christian family members (e.g. parents), etc -- making sure the candidate doesn't have some idea of \"doing both\".</p></li>\n<li><p>How do you plan to observe Shabbat?  How will you resolve conflicts between that and your job, your family (if applicable), etc?</p></li>\n<li><p>Discussion of dating/marriage plans, avoiding intermarriage, and raising children.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(There's probably more, but those are the areas I know about.)</p>\n\n\n",

See the first mishnah for Rosh Hashanah.</p>\n\n<p>Beis Shammai hold it is the first of Shvat, so they also follow that you increase the simcha from Tu Bishvat.</p>\n\n<p>So if you did it from this date you would be following the practice of Beis Shammai.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for the celebration 2 weeks after is of course the G'zeira Shava with 15th / 15th. Sukkot is the celebration on the 15th day i.e. 2 weeks after Rosh Hashanah. Pesach is the one on the 15th day from the 1st Nisan new year.

One starts increasing his Simcha on Rosh Chodesh Adar and continues increasing it until Rosh Chodesh Av when he starts decreasing it. Thus on Tisha B'Av he is at a higher level of Simcha than on Purim as on Purim he just started increasing his Simcha and on Tisha B'Av he just started decreasing his Simcha. Thus if one starts early he will be too B'Simcha on Purim and it is therefore prohibited. </p>\n\n<p>(Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim volume 5)</p>\n\n\n",

This resulted in him either completely ignoring הלכות mentioned in the גמרא that were based on the existence of demons (such as the issur of keeping food beneath your bed), or giving the הלכות different and more rational reasons (an example for such an halach is מעין שבע said on Friday nights, which was based on the fear that demons, which are common on Friday nights, will attack those that stay alone after davining. The Rambam was instead worried of other natural dangers, and so when ליל הסדר falls on Friday night, the Rambam says you still say מעין שבע  even though ליל הסדר משומר מן המזיקין. In this example there is a real נפקא מינא from the Rambams rational approach!). The Rambams rational approach affected not only the הלכות based on demons, but also הלכות that base on other irrational/supernatural phenomenons (such as explaining the reasons of אישה קטלנית on medical reasons rather the her מזל, which has some נפקא מינות.)</p>\n\n<p>There are a few different approaches to his disbelief in them, that range from the Gra's statement that the philosophy twisted the Rambams mind:</p>\n\n<p>\"והוא [רמב\"ם] נמשך אחרי הפילוסופיא, ולכן כתב שכשפים ושמות ולחשים ושדים וקמיעות הכל הוא שקר. אבל כבר הכו אותו על קדקדו, שהרי מצינו הרבה מעשיות בגמרא על פי שמות וכשפים. \"אמרה איהי מלתא, ואסרתה לארבא\"...

Otherwise, one might be contributing to a false Messianism, which Judaism has seen <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Messiah_claimants\" rel=\"noreferrer\">too many</a> of already. So, your rabbi was wise to suggest that you put the yarmulke away until the right time.</p>\n<p>I learned from one of my teachers in high school that this concept is also hinted to in the Hebrew name of this garment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do you know why it's called a <em>kippah</em>?

Therefore he told you יהא מונח, it should remain in Munich, until Eliyahu can come and tell you which of its denizens misplaced it in your Shul.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This would depend on whether Eliyahu Hanavi actually comes to the seder or to a bris. in regards to the seder, there is no classical jewish source that says that eliyahu hanavi comes to the pesach seder. Obviously we know that Eliyahu Hanavi will comes to herald the messaih and obviously  on the seder night where the focus is on redemption we hope that he will come to herald the redemption, thus the minhag evolved that we say he comes on the seder night. Indeed,  in reference to the fifth cup \"kos shel eliyahu\", the Mishnah Berurah (480:10) says that the cup is called Kos shel Eliyahu to allude to the fact “that we believe that just as God redeemed us from Egypt, He will again redeem us and send Eliyahu to announce it.” the earliest source for this 5th cup is in the writings of Rabbi Zelikman Binga, the son-in-law of the Maharil. In his commentary to Pesachim (sec. 11 page. 195), he reports seeing individuals pour a cup of wine at the Seder and refer to it as Eliyahu’s Cup. He proposed that the practice is probably related to our hope that Eliyahu will come on Pesach night, which as mentioned above is the night of redemption—to herald the arrival of Mashiach. Therefore, i wouldnt put the lost item in the cup, probably because the wine will destroy it. However, in line with our deep desire for redemption i would have the lost item on hand in order to give it to eliyahu when he comes, but if chas ve shalom in the event he did not come, i would keep watch of it till the heralding of the Moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of his presence at brisos. The source for eliyahu coming is from the is Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer, (chapter 29) and Chazal instituted the Kisei Shel Eliyahu as mentioned in the Tur (YD 265), the Shulchan Aruch (YD 265:11), and the Aruch HaShulchan (YD 265:34). The Pirkei deRabbi Eliezer, doesn't actually say that Eliyahu will be present at each and every bris. All it says is that he will see with his own eyes that jews are performing the bris. As it says חייך שאין ישראל עושין ברית מילה עד שאתה רואה בעיניך. Rather the first place that says that Eliyahu will be at every bris is the Zohar: א\"ל הקב\"ה: חייך, בכל אתר דהאי רשימא קדישא די ירשמון ליה בני בבשרהון, אנת תזדמן תמן ופומא דאסהיד דישראל עזבו, הוא יסהיד דישראל מקיימין האי קיימא. I would suggest that its not a given if Eliyahu will be by any of these moments, so best bet is to wait till Mashiach. </p>\n\n\n",

And after he became the father of Mahalalel, Kenan lived <strong>840</strong> years and had other sons and daughters. Altogether, Kenan lived <strong>910</strong> years, and then he died. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Genesis 11 is an <em>exercise</em> in addition: there, only the age at the first birth and the number of years afterwards are written; we have to do the addition to get at the total age, e.g.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Shelah had lived <strong>30</strong> years, he became the father of Eber. And after he became the father of Eber, Shelah lived <strong>403</strong> years and had other sons and daughters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Genesis 18 is a lesson in subtraction! In Genesis 18:18, Abraham asks: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What if the number of the righteous is <strong>five less than fifty</strong>?\n  Will you destroy the whole city because of five people?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Abraham apparently didn't know up to that moment how to do 50 minus 5. So The Lord taught him to do the math:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If I find <strong>forty-five</strong> there,\" he said, \"I will not destroy it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Mr Bin who was recently serialized in Riva Pomerantz's story in Family First is an individual who has severe ADHD. When Adar rolls in he is very happy as that is when he finally realized how his issues are messing him up and was able to correct them. Due to that every year he is B'Simcha in Adar. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In Adar it is customary to make bad jokes, usually dry in nature and witty. Like British humor. I would assume that is the connection between Adar and the comedy of Mr. Bean. Thus he is happy at the arrival of Adar, for perhaps he gets a bump in sales of his comedy material. </p>\n\n\n",

But based on a statement in <a href=\"http://www.ravaviner.com/2009/11/man-on-moon.html\">this article</a> :</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rabbis therefore rule that a person should continue to follow the\n  time from the place from which he departed. Based on this, it is\n  possible that different people in a space station or on the moon who\n  came from different places will be observing different times.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a Jew was born in space (station), he has never \"departed\" from Earth. What times does he follow, or does he follow his Mom's minhag? Let's assume that Dad is still on Earth and Mom travelled to the space station while she was pregnant (If any of these factors would matter in answering the question?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>This is a fun question. Thanks for asking @DanF. The issue of time in regard to Shabbat and Yom Tov is not an issue of minhag. It is a matter of Halacha. In regard to your question, while in transit it would be like traveling on a plane. You would follow by the time of your point of departure once you left earth orbit.</p>\n\n<p>Once you landed at your new destination you would follow the sunrise and sunset of the place you are in, like for example the moon or Mars. This follows a general principle mentioned in Shulchan Aruch HaRav, Orach Chaim, Hilchot Birchot HaShachar, 46:1 and 5. Everything follows the order of the world in that particular location.</p>\n\n<p>A space station would appear to leave open the possibility that individuals could be holding by different times if they came at different times and their point of departure was from different time zones like with an international space station. One Jew coming from Russia, one from the United States and one from Israel. But even then, the worst case would be a gap of only 24 hours.</p>\n\n<p>In the case of Mom and Dad, it is most likely they normally reside with one another. Even if temporarily one departed from a different time zone, they would follow from where they reside.</p>\n\n<p>Baby is considered in this question like the portable property of the parents.

However, he brings the Magen Avraham who argues with that opinion , and indeed it seems that the Mishna Berura concurs that it isn't necessary. See also Sha”arei Teshuva Siman 4:12 where he rules that no utensil, and no three times is necessary after the bathroom.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Moreover. the Elya Rabba Siman 4:12 writes that even the stringent opinions that require 3 times after the bathroom, agree that no utensil is necessary for those three times!</p>\n<p>Another proof to this is brought by the Poskim from the language of the Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah Siman 376:4 where he requires washing the hands after being in a cemetery (which is the same Tumah status as after using the bathroom) where he writes “Rochtzim” and not “Notlim”, the language used for Netilas Yadayim, which would seem to mean him not requiring a utensil.</p>\n<p>The only reason that the custom developed to use a utensil after the cemetery was due to the restriction on dipping the hands into the river. (See Gilyon MaHarsha on the above Shulchan Aruch and see Kitzur Shulchan Aruch Siman 199:10.)</p>\n<p>Though many people are stringent to use a utensil it is a Chumra (stringency) and NOT M’Ikar D’Din (See Shu”t Minchas Yitzchok Vol. 5 Siman 96. See also Shu”t Yad HaLeivi where he rules that only after using a bathroom belonging to Aino Yehudims is a utensil required, but that is due to a danger and not M’Ikar D’Din.\nSee also Biur haGra to Shulchan Aruch Siman 4:18 where he clearly states that this washing is not M’Ikar D’din and is due to the danger)</p>\n<p>Bottom line, although there are indeed such opinions, most contemporary Poskim do not rule that way.

How does Jewish law traditionally treat voyeurism (if it does at all)? What is the punishment for voyeurism?</p>\n\n<p>Note: I am not referring to punishments or prohibitions against looking at immodestly dressed people or images in general. I refer to punishments or prohibitions against voyeurism as a form of damage or attack on the target.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>While hezek re'iyah is clearly an established halachic concept, they don't seem to explicate what's included in such a violation. In Bava Basra, they discuss what one may or may not do in building a house due to hezek re'iyah, and it seems that beis din may force a person to rebuild in order to fix any existing privacy violations. </p>\n\n<p>There's also a story in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=10&daf=24&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow\">Taanis</a> about a bochur spying on a rabbi's daughter through a hole in their fence (didn't end well for the daughter), but it's aggadah and doesn't discuss the assessment of damages due to voyeurism. </p>\n\n<p>It would seem (though I cannot point to an exact source) that hezek re'iyah would be treated as any other form of hezek and would be subjected to the same forms of recompensation. Much like pulling off a woman's headcovering in public and other forms of damage (see all over bava kama), you only pay what's applicable to your situation. </p>\n\n<p>For public embarrassment to a woman, you pay a very high amount of boshet, but no nezek, shevet, tzar, or ripui. See <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.8.6?lang=en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bava Kama 8:6</a>. Also in that perek (first mishna) - embarrassing someone who is <strong><em>currently unaware of their embarrassment</em></strong> (like a sleeping person) is just as assur. This is even stated explicitly by boshet (so don't go doodling on your passed out drunken friend's face...). This means that despite the fact that the women originally had NO IDEA they were being subjected to voyeurism, they are still considered to have been damaged and can collect after being informed of their damage.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, they are certainly eligible to boshet (psychological damages). If the injured parties required therapy, they may be able to collect ripui and/or shevet (if the pursuit of damages, embarrassment, and psychological harm prevented them engaging in normal work). Both tzar and nezek refer to physical damage, so neither of those would apply in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

What do our interpretations say about why she did this and whether it was, l'chatchila, Torah-sanctioned behavior? </p>\n\n<p>My motivation for asking is that I wasn't aware that there were any special permissions for a Jewish woman to enter a non-Jewish man's harem or engineer to marry him, even if she had righteous intentions (nor for a father to give away his daughter to do this). Mitzvos that might apply are</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Leviticus 21:29 \"Profane not thy daughter, to make her a harlot, lest\nthe land fall into harlotry, and the land become full of lewdness.\" \n(re: Mordechai's hand in this)</p></li>\n<li><p>Deutronomy 23:18 \"There shall be no harlot of the daughters of\nIsrael\" </p>\n\n<p>(I don't know if Esther was literally being \"וְאֶת רָחָב\nהַזּוֹנָה,\" but it would seem that at least a similar prohibition\ncould be involved.)</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...Someone told me that Esther and her father were \"made\" to do this, but the Megillah is not clear. If that interpretation is correct, please provide a textual source.</p>\n\n<p>If she was, in fact, forced, I would be interested in any possible answers to the related question of whether Esther made effort to avoid being kept or chosen. I never get that sense from the Megillah itself, but I haven't read much commentary.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are several places in the Talmud which assume she was taken by force, e.g. <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=11&daf=15&format=pdf\">Megillah 15a</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לך כנוס את כל היהודים וגו' עד אשר לא כדת אמר רבי אבא שלא כדת היה שבכל יום ויום עד עכשיו באונס ועכשיו ברצון וכאשר אבדתי אבדתי כשם שאבדתי מבית אבא כך אובד ממך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi there:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד עכשיו. נבעלתי באונס: ועכשיו. מכאן ואילך מדעתי: אבדתי ממך. ואסורה אני לך דאשת ישראל שנאנסה מותרת לבעלה וברצון אסורה לבעלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When she agrees to go to the King to plead for the Jewish people, then it won't be Halachic rape anymore, and she will no longer be able to be reunited with her Halachic husband, Mordechai.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Esther 2:8 uses the term \"Vatilakach\" - she was taken. While it doesn't clearly imply \"forcibly\", there are several hints that this was mandatory.</p>\n\n<p>One is 2:3 that says that the king should gather EVERY virgin girl. The text alone doesn't state that Esther was married, so she might have been a <em>betulah</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Even if we follow the explanations that she was married, see Rash\"i on 2:17 that says that the king took even married women.</p>\n\n\n",

This Mitzvah is of utmost importance as it is one of the few Mitzvos for which we stop learning torah (another one would be attending funerals).This illustrates the importance of this category of Mitzvos. The question is why on such a stand-alone happy day? After all, the couple is getting married. Is there a requirement for the guests to make them more happy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To understand why we make the couple happy, we must first point out the way we make them happy, which is by praising them. As the gemara in Kesuvos 17 asks 'how do we dance before the bride? By saying she is attractive and kind'. </p>\n\n<p>The reason to praise the bride and groom is so they should be happy with their decision to get married. As Beis Hillel ends the discussion there by saying 'when someone buys something in the market, should you praise itin his eyes, or degenerate it?'. So the basic idea is that at the time when someone makes the most life altering decision they will ever make, we try to help them be happy with their decision, and not be nervous about it, or have regrets. This is most applicable right away at the wedding and the seven days of feasting. \nBy praising and entertaining them, they ignore their nervous feelings.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Radal on Pirkei DeRabi Eliezer chapter 16 #61, points out just how deeply this praising of the couple is connected to praising someone's acquisition. He points out that the gemara in Kesuvos 17a only mentions praising the bride, whereas the Pirkei DiRabi Eliezer mentions praising the groom as well. He explains that the sugya in Ksuvos was discussing whether to praise her with her actual qualities or give a standardized praise was specifically taking into account the fact that the groom was the one who made the kinyan, aquirement, therefore Beis Hillel argued to Beis Shamai that a standardized praise was in order, just in case she is lacking qualities, we don't want him to regret his aquirement. </p>\n\n<p>But, says the Radal, concerning the praise about the groom, Beis Hillel will agree with Beis Shamai to praise him with his actual qualities, because a woman is happy with anything, as we see in Kedushin 41a טב למיתב טן דו.</p>\n\n\n",

Formulations of a similar nature are found in a number of texts, and lead me to wonder: in the event that one's rav or one's father is leyning from the Torah and makes a mistake, is one <em>always</em> permitted to publicly correct him, or are there situations in which it is better to let him continue?</p>\n\n<p>By way of an example, if he were to make a mistake in his leyning of Parshat Va'etchanan, mispronouncing one of the words in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4-9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:4-9</a>, should one correct him?

He writes that the reason its assur to correct ones father in general is because it will embarrass him. The question is does this apply to layning and davening. He writes that it seems there is room to say that it is true that the father will be embarrassed but nevertheless he rather be mochel and corrected than allow a bracha levatala to happen(meaning the oleh will say an after bracha on a leining which isn't good). However, the matter needs more inspection since it is prevalent to scream out and correct a mistake of the baal koreh and its embarrassing to the bal teffilah(koreh).A way to circumvent the problem is for the son to tell another congregant to correct his father. However,the Rivevos Ephraim is hesitant because many times the bal koreh is very close to the end of the aliyah and by the time the son relates the message a bracha levatalah may be made. He seems to end off by not giving a direct psak and wants to see what other Achronim have to say.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I once saw a Rav Shlomo Zalman Aurbach that says if a parent tells you go against halacha and the only way to fulfill that halacha is to go against him/her it would be mutar but in a case where it's possible to fulfill it in another way it would then be asur.</p>\n\n<p>(Rav Shlomo Zalman brings a case by Purim if a parent tells you not to drink you can't drink since there is another way to fulfill that mitzva i.e.: drink then go to sleep, ayin rama.)</p>\n\n<p>(By the way a Rav isn't allowed to be mochel on his kaavod.)</p>\n\n\n",

If one already began Modim, but remembered before moving his feet back at the end of Shemoneh Esrei, he should return to the beginning of Retzeh and continue from there until the end. The preceding is true only regarding Shacharit and Mincha, but if one forgot to say Ya’aleh VeYavo in Ma’ariv, he does not go back, unless he remembers before saying God’s name at the conclusion of Retzeh. The reason Ma’ariv is different is that the Beit Din did not sanctify the new moon at night. Thus, even though one should, ideally, say Ya’aleh VeYavo in Ma’ariv, he does not repeat the Shemoneh Esrei, or even just one blessing, in order to say it (Berachot 29b, 30b; Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 422:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/05-01-10/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/05-01-10/</a></p>\n\n<p>But what about ma'ariv at the beginning of the second day of rosh chodesh?

    "content": "# Why was King David Punished for Sending Others to Conduct a Census?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If there is no agency for sin, why was King David punished for sending people out to conduct a (forbidden) census?  (Explanation of agency: The Talmud says \"ein sheliach l'dvar averia,\" which means, practically speaking, that if you tell someone to eat non-kosher food, the sin is on the person who eats the food, not on you.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Possibly it's an issue of hora'as sha'ah. See ... all of maseches Horayos for detailed discussion on how Beis Din handles broadcasting improper halachic rulings that cause the public to commit an aveirah.</p>\n\n<p>\"Ein sheliach\" works potentially in two different ways - 1) divrei harav vidivrei hatalmid, and 2) Chazal not giving the capacity for shlichus in the case of an aveirah. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Since he was operating in position of authority more so than an average individual, he was held responsible for the command. Disobeying a direct order from the king may make you Chayiv Misa - see Shmuel 1 where people disobeying Shaul are killed - most of those were considered legally justified. That being the case, people are compelled to engage in this impermissable behavior, since the alternative is dying. So \"divrei harav vidivrei hatalmid, divrei mi shomin?\"  wouldn't shield Dovid from culpability in this case. That potentially puts Dovid in the position of machti es harabim on top of being responsible for the aveirah being committed. </li>\n<li>This may not be a case of shlichus anyhow - he was punished for issuing the command to count (over Yo'av's objections), not the act of counting itself. Also, the whole story is prefaced by either Hashem (in shmuel 2 24:1) or the satan (in divrei hayamim 1 21:1) inspiring Dovid to act. Dovid says he has sinned, not the navi Gad. Hashem merely gives Dovid a choice of punishments but doesn't accuse him of wrongdoing. In divrei Hayamim, it inverts the order and says Hashem was mad BECAUSE of the census, but still doesn't tell Dovid that he did wrong.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Practically speaking, since this was a punishment from Hashem, it's in His hands to determine guilt. This is clearly an exception to whatever other rules we think may apply.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>David decides to take a census</strong></p>\n\n<p>II Samuel, chapter 24, records one of the most puzzling stories in the Bible. II Samuel 24:9 tells us that King David took a census that resulted in a plague that killed seventy thousand Israelites. But counting or taking a census in the Bible could be done in order to determine the availability for war, for the division of land, and for tax purposes. But what did David do wrong and why were innocent people, indeed seventy thousand of them, killed by a plague?</p>\n\n<p>In the story, David orders his commanding general Joab to assemble the soldiers to tally people. The procedure ends after nine months and twenty days, when Joab returns with the count of eight hundred thousand men, along with an additional five hundred thousand from Judah as reserves which could be mobilized in a time of war. When David heard this report he immediately began to regret ever having taken the census. For the count has been made public.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What did Maimonides think</strong></p>\n\n<p>In his Guide of the Perplexed 2:48, Maimonides explains that whenever the Bible says that G-d did something, it is not that G-d actually did it but what occurred was the result of the laws of nature. Since G-d created the laws of nature, the Bible attributes the event to G-d, since G-d is the ultimate cause. If we understand the text in this way, we can posit that G-d did not really become angry (Rambam felt that G-d does not have emotions).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did David take the census?</strong></p>\n\n<p>David probably undertook the census to gauge how many men or to procure potential soldiers that he could muster for an anticipated battle since David engaged in many wars. For the census, David dispatched his senior officers to determine who was fit for military service. However, the census was done publicly which came to the attention of Israel’s enemies, the very nations that David was assembling forces to fight. When the enemies learned of the census they took preventative measures and mapped out the area of drafting disseminated along Israel's boarder, resulting in an ambush of David’s forces. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Natural consequences</strong></p>\n\n<p>After the census, David lamented it was too late. There was nothing he could do but face the consequences. The world functions according to the laws of nature, and one of those laws is that every act has a consequence. Thus, the prophet Gad had three possibilities for David’s negligent behavior. David could have fought the enemy or famine might arise as what happened to Saul. The plague was the result of a great slaughter [decomposing corpses]. Alternatively, the seventy thousand men were killed in battle, a “plague.” This number would have been much smaller had the census not been publicized. After the plague, Gad told David to set an altar where the plague has stopped, as a remembrance for David not to make the same mistake twice. The phrase “David’s Heart Smote Him” is a metaphor for David’s regret since the ancients considered the heart to be the seat of wisdom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n\n<p>The last chapter of the biblical book of Samuel, if taken literally describes an angry G-d pushing David, resulting in deaths of tens of thousands. This is theologically problematic. But if we read according to Maimonides’ teaching in Guide 2:48, it can be explained in a more rational manner. David was punished due to natural consequences. When David dispatched a military contingent to take a census over a nine-month period which was mistakenly publicized. We can surmise that the enemy discovered the secret, fought or ambushed David’s army, resulting in the deaths of seventy thousand men, followed by a three-day plague.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are there any halachot related to the position of a toilet seat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14085&st=&pgnum=276\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 23:14</a> states that when you camp during a battle, you should keep a spade with you so that you can use it to cover up your excrement.</p>\n\n<p>Since the Torah mentions the importance of \"bodily cleanliness\" when you're out in the field in battle, I wonder if there is any halacha learned from this verse or otherwise specifically regarding the position of a toilet seat after you are finished in the bathroom. Offhand, since the verse mentions \"covering\", to me it seems proper to close the toilet seat cover as a sense of cleanliness.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any ruling that can be extracted from this verse, or is there any other recommendation cited by anyone even if it doesn't use this verse?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's been related <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/17136/what-is-the-halachic-status-of-todays-modern-bathrooms\">questions in the past</a>. Flushing is far more critical than putting the lid down. If there's no excrement there, there's no \"need\" to put down the lid. See the discussion about <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=brachos&daf=26a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beis kisei haparsia</a> that had a sloped trench so none of the tzoah stayed at the mouth - Chazal say it's entirely muttar to engage in davar shebikdusha, since it is considered to be sealed.</p>\n\n<p>As a side point, this was regarding the use of latrines, where there was no designated \"space\" to relieve onesself. When one has a dedicated bathroom, the fact that it's an entire space dedicated to such removes any issues regarding covering of filth afterwards. See multiple places in shas (I can think of two at least - one in <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.co.il/berachos/points/br-ps-023.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brachos</a>, the other in shabbos daf 10) that discuss beis hakisei and how to behave near designated waste areas. These include things like rabbanim waiting outside to resume conversation while the other relieves themselves, cubbyholes to store tefilin and objects of kedushah in a passthrough wall that is considered it's own domain, and other goodies.</p>\n\n\n",

(See Shulchan Aruch Siman 217:1 and Mishna Berura S”K 1....</p>\n  \n  <p>Even if one enters the store for a purpose other than to smell or buy spices, if they are smelled even without intention to do so, a Bracha is recited.

(Mishna Berura 217:1)</p>\n  \n  <p>2) The aforementioned is only if one smells it unintentionally, then we say that since it wasn’t meant to be smelled no Bracha is required. However, if one picks up the closed container/box with the intention to smell it, it is then considered as meant to be smelled and a Bracha will indeed be required. (Ruling of the Mishna Berura ibid. The Chazon Ish Orach Chaim Siman 35:1 argues and maintains that if it is intended for sale, even when it is picked up and smelled no Bracha is required. See also Aruch HaShulchan Siman 216:6)</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly if the owner of the store hands over a sample to smell, a Bracha will be required.

The most notable of this group of animals is the shu'al.</p>\n<p><strong>So my question is this:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_(What_Does_the_Fox_Say%3F)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">What did the Fox say?</a></h2>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

And it says in pirkei avos, hevei zanav l'arayos v'al tehi rosh l'shualim, \"Be the tail of lions; do not be the head of foxes.\" Thus, the fate of the foxes must have been worse than that of the lions.</p>\n\n<p>The pasuk says (Bamidbar 23:24): הֶן עָם כְּלָבִיא יָקוּם וְכַאֲרִי יִתְנַשָּׂא לֹא יִשְׁכַּב עַד יֹאכַל טֶרֶף, so we see the lions were \"יֹאכַל טֶרֶף\", i.e. got the treife meat just like the dogs. Since the foxes are worse, it follows that they do not get this reward, indicating that they did speak at yetzias mitzrayim. (It also indicates that lions did not speak at yetzias mitzrayim, which makes sense, since they were not around at the time.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Since the fox is a smart animal, it knows enough to keep quiet and stay out of the way when faced with the Mal'ach Hamaves. As a result, when they sensed the deaths around them, they knew enough to hide and keep silent.</p>\n\n\n",

See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is obvious in halacha that Rov is equivalent to the whole, for linguistic (רובא ככולא) and philosophical reasons (תלמוד תורה כנגד כולם and כבוד התורה חמירא).</p>\n\n<p>However, it could be argued that in reality the Rabbi's whole role is to serve the people and therefore he is secondary to the congregation and if they weren't eaten, then it cannot be claimed that the dragon did its job. The proof that a rabbi is subservient to the people (besides for פוק חזי) iS that Rabbi (רב) has the numerical value of 202 which is numerically equivalent to \"עבד עבדים\" (a slave of slaves). this reveals that the rabbi is nothing in and of himself, but is wholly secondary to his congregation.</p>\n\n<p>Since we have equally compelling arguments to support paying the dragon renter and not paying, we conclude המוציא מחבירו עליו הראיה (the money stays where it is) in this case since the dragon-master already has the money, you have no right to demand it back. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I may be mistaken so correct me if I'm wrong, but from memory I believe there's a shita in gemara (I think Bava Basra perek yesh nochalin, but can't remember offhand), that if a shechiv mera (someone on his deathbed) writes over his property to his wife and his sons, he has equated the wife to all the sons, so the wife gets 1/2 and the sons split the other half. (The other shita holds the wife is just an apotropos for the property.)</p>\n\n<p>Thus, since you hired the dragon to \"devour the rabbi and the congregants\", you have equated the rabbi to all the congregants, and the principle of \"rubo k'kulo\" does not apply since it has only fulfilled exactly half the contract.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, in Bava Metziah (somewhere towards the end, maybe perek hasocher es haumnin?) there is a rule that if contracted workers back out part way through the job, the ruling depends -- if there are other workers to finish the job, \"ein alav elah tarumos,\" i.e. the employer has no legal recourse (but you would not need to pay for the full job). If there are no other workers, the employer is allowed to deceive them, i.e. claim to pay them more for finishing the job, but not actually give more in the end.</p>\n\n<p>So the ruling here depends on whether there are other workers to finish the job. If so, you must hire others, if not, you can deceive the dragon with a promise of higher wages.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While רובו ככולו would not normally apply to contract law, in this case one might say that it does because dragon attacks are understood to leave some survivors. However, on a closer reading of the terms of your contract with the dragon it appears that the dragon <em>cannot</em> claim רובו ככולו because the contract specifies both the Rov <em>and</em> the congregation. Thus in order to fulfill his terms, the dragon must eat a majority of the congregation in addition to the Rov. </p>\n\n<p>All that being said, having a <em>din torah</em> with someone is no excuse for rudeness. Dragons are intelligent beings and are hired, not rented like cattle.</p>\n\n\n",

So older sources only reference the uniqueness of prayer in vicinity of the Temple itself (e.g. Pirkei D'Rabbi Elziezer ch. 35).

Later Jewish literature also references 40 days of prayer (2). E.g. Devarim Rabba (Vatchanan 2):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מהו בכל קראנו אליו אמרו רבנן יש תפלה שנענית לארבעים יום ממי את למד ממשה דכתיב ואתנפל לפני ה' מ' יום וגו'</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea of special efficacy of 40 days of prayer is also found in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jami%60_at-Tirmidhi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Jami` at-Tirmidhi</a> (9th cent. Hadith compilation).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“Whoever prays to Allah for forty days in congregation, catching up with the first takbeer, he will be recorded as being free from two things: free from the Fire and free from hypocrisy.” (<a href=\"https://islamqa.info/en/34605\" rel=\"nofollow\">source</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A similar activity was practiced by Sufis:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One of these ... was the practice of a spiritual retreat (halwa) for a period of forty days ('arba'un) still followed by Sufis in the Naqsabandi order in present-day Egypt.

For this reason it is unsurprising that many poskim write that if one has a limited amount of time, study of practical halakha must come first.</p>\n\n<p>For example the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Derisha</a> (YD 256) writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש בעלי בתים נוהגין ללמוד בכל יום גפ\"ת ולא שאר פוסקים ... אבל לי נראה כי לא זאת המרגוע ולא בזאת יתהלל המתהלל כי אם בזאת יתהלל השכל וידוע בספרי פוסקים דיני תורה כגון \"האלפסי\" \"והמרדכי\" \"והרא\"ש\" ודומיהם דזהו שורש ועיקר לתורתנו ואינם יוצאים כלל בלימוד \"גמרא פירוש תוספות\"... ומ\"ש רבינו תם כאן תלמוד בבלי בלול וכו' קאי אמה שכתב רבינו לפני זה אלימוד תשע שעות ביום דכיון שיש לו פנאי גדול ילמוד בתלמוד אבל הנך בעלי בתים שאינם לומדים כי אם ג' או ד' שעות לא ילמדו בתלמוד לחוד כנ\"ל.</p>\n  \n  <p>There are some laymen who are accustomed to study the Talmud with the commentaries of Rashi and the Tosafists, but not the (other) <em>poskim</em>... However, it appears to me that this is not the point, and one not ought take pride in this; the only thing one ought take pride in is in the mastery of the works of the poskim such as those of al-Fasi, R. Mordehai, Rosh, and the like. For this is the root and foundation of our Torah. And they do not discharge their obligation (to study) at all with the (mere) study of the Talmud with the commentaries of Rashi and the Tosafists...And that which Rabbenu Tam wrote, [that the Babylonian Talmud incorporates all of the necessary components of study] that applies in a such a case illustrated previously, of one who studies nine hours a day. Since he has so much time, he can (afford) to study Talmud. But those laymen, who only study three or four hours, they should not merely study the Talmud, as explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is cited by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shabbatai_HaKohen\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shakh</a> there as well.</p>\n\n<p>Citing the Shakh, the Mishnah Berurah <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.155.3?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow\">(155:3)</a> writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ללמוד - חייב אדם ללמוד בכל יום תורה שבכתב שהוא תנ\"ך ומשנה וגמרא ופוסקים ובעלי בתים שאינם לומדים רק ג' או ד' שעות ביום לא ילמדו בגמרא לחוד דבזה אינו יוצא אלא צריך שילמוד דוקא גם ספרי פוסקים כל אחד כפי השגתו [שו\"ע יו\"ד וש\"ך שם]</p>\n  \n  <p>Each day one must study the Written Law, which is Tanakh, and Mishnah, and Talmud and Poskim. And laymen who only learn for three or four hours, should not study Talmud exclusively, for with this they do not discharge their obligation. Rather one must learn the works of the poskim in particular.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It should be noted that the Mishanh Berurah tones down the Derisha who seemed to advocate primarily studying poskim,and emphasized instead the need to also learn poskim. Either way, the question of whether one must study halakha daily, is answered with a clear: affirmative.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The end of Gemara Meseches Niddah says this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תנא דבי אליהו כל השונה הלכות בכל יום מובטח לו שהוא בן העולם הבא שנאמר הליכות עולם לו אל תקרי הליכות אלא הלכות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Very old fashioned English translation I found online (halakhah.com):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Tanna debe Eliyahu  [teaches]: Whoever repeats  Halachahs every day may rest assured that he will be a denizen of the world to come, for it is said, Halikoth — the world is his;  read not halikoth  but halakoth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Apparently, the tosafot on the popular \"shlish bimikra, shlish bimishna, shliah bitalmud\" gemara remarks that Mishna <strong><em>is</em></strong> the study of halacha.

The <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2510.htm#19\">Rambam - Hilchos Brachos 10:17</a> rules that one may say Kiddush Levana immediately after the Molad. Suppose 2 days after the Molad one made Kiddush Levana, and then realized he did it too early. Should he say Kiddush Levana again with a Bracha? (sources) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Be'er Hetev that you quote says that if Saturday night is before the third of the month, Kiddush Levana should be pushed off to the next Saturday night because it will still be before the 11th of the month (and we don't usually push off Kiddush Levana to Saturday night if it will be after the 11th of the month for fear of a few days of clouds).</p>\n\n<p>But he doesn't say we push it off because you can't say it then.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed his source is the Magen Avraham who quotes a number of Rishonim who permit saying it on Rosh Chodesh and one who even says doing so is a Mitzva min haMuvchar. (See Rashi, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21359&st=&pgnum=108\" rel=\"nofollow\">Semag</a>, Rambam, Sefer haKaneh, Meiri, Tashbetz, Maharam Rikanti, Yad Ramah, Sefer HaPardes, etc. and note the Girsa of בחידושה in the Rif and Yerushalmi. Indeed the Bavli, which defines explicitly the last time one can say it, omits any mention of an earlier limitation and in <a href=\"http://jnul.huji.ac.il/dl/talmud/bavly/showbav1.asp?mishnanum=1&pereknum=044&masecet=34&mnusriptnum=223&p=1&masecetindex=23&perekindex=41&numamud=1&manuscriptindex=1&k=\" rel=\"nofollow\">one manuscript</a> actually calls it \"the Beracha on Rosh Chodesh\".)</p>\n\n<p>Thus it seems according to this majority opinion, he has fulfilled his obligation in the case you describe and need not say it again.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed the first Rishon who suggests waiting at all before saying Kiddush Levana (with the exception of certain Kabbalistic positions of waiting a week) is Rabbeinu Yonah (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=364\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachot R21a</a>) who offers an original read of a variant text of Masekhet Soferim 20:1 that would require waiting \"two or three days\" until one can benefit from the light. While the Peri Megadim (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2349\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 426 EA 13</a>) thinks that this means 72 hours (!וצע\"ג), the straightforward understanding of \"two or three days\" is that it's an approximation (perhaps because the Molad is not always at the same time of day). Thus while the Bach (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1934\" rel=\"nofollow\">OC 426</a>) writes that the longstanding tradition is not to wait a week but to say Kiddush Levana soon after three days, his son-in-law the Taz (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2141\" rel=\"nofollow\">ibid. sk 3</a>) writes about his position that \"it is not about days but from the time that one can benefit from [the moon's] light, which is certainly [the case] after 3 days\". The case of the OP is almost certainly such a case as the moon probably looked regular enough to him that he didn't get concerned.</p>\n\n<p>Thus even according to this minority opinion, which many are generally careful for because it doesn't limit their Saturday night opportunities (see above), he has fulfilled his obligation and need not say it again.</p>\n\n<p>(To be fair, Rav Saadya Gaon's siddur (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=149\" rel=\"nofollow\">p 90</a>) says Kiddush Levana is said on nights 4-14 (inclusive) of the month, but this is not quoted in later works, it's not even clear that's an authentic wording (see footnotes there), and there are other reasons why the positions there appear non-standard.)</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=916&st=&pgnum=245&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igrot Moshe OC 1:143</a>) explains that according to the Shulchan Arukh, Kiddush Levana should Lekhatchila be said on Rosh Chodesh, and only if that is unfeasible (very common) then it is better to wait until the moon brightens significantly before reciting it. He also writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=921&st=&pgnum=256\" rel=\"nofollow\">ibid. CM 2:47:2</a>) that waiting any time for the moon to brighten is רק הידורא בעלמא a mere beautification of the Mitzva [but not an essential component]. According to that, it seems he has fulfilled his obligation in the case you describe and need not say it again</p>\n\n<p>Rav <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Zalman_Auerbach\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shlomo Zalman Auerbach</a> rules (Halikhot Shelomo Rosh Chodesh 1:108) that one who recited Kiddush Levana before the third of the month has fulfilled his obligation.</p>\n\n\n",

We also know that the encampment of the Jews in the desert is a classical public domain (Rashi <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=6b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 6b</a>).</p>\n\n<p>The questions becomes, was there a valid eruv when the Torah was given? Generally, one cannot make an Eruv in a real public domain without doors (ShA OC 364:2). They didn't install doors because that would imminently <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/17571/759\">create an obligation in Mezuzah</a> which <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/7878/759\">they didn't have any of yet</a>. However, in this case God held a roof over the encampment (Bavli <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=88&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 88a</a>) in order to remove its status as a biblical public domain (OC 345:14) and make the Eruv Kosher.</p>\n\n<p>However, we also know (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0219.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:12</a>) that no one was allowed to enter the mountain, giving it the Halachic status of <a href=\"http://ohr.edu/5070\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Karpef</em></a> which would prohibit carrying. This is supported by the Midrash which states <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/16754/759\">that plants grew on Har Sinai just prior to the giving of the Torah</a>. After all, a classical Karpef is freshly planted ground (cf OC 358:9-10).</p>\n\n<p>At first glance, the prohibition of Karpef is removed because the walls surrounded Moshe's and God's dwelling on the top of the mountain. However, since the two of them only got there after the walls were put up (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0219.htm#20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:20</a>) they do not count as mechitzot shehukfu ledirah (OC 358:2). God (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0219.htm#23\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 19:23</a>-24) even instructed Moshe to ensure that no one opened and closed the Eruv after he got up top, which would have made it a mechitza shehufah ledira (OC 358:2).</p>\n\n<p>Thus the Eruv could only work to permit the Karpef if the area of Har Sinai was less than 5000 ammah^2. This was clearly not the case as the mountain covered the entire encampment, as above, including over 600,000 people, each of whom takes up 1 ammah^2 of surface area (Bavli <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=7&daf=7b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 7b</a> \"גברא באמתא יתיב a man sits in a square-ammah\").</p>\n\n<p>Yet we know God <em>did</em> give the Torah and it thus must have entered the public domain. We must conclude that the people were <em>standing</em> and not <em>sitting</em>. This is the source for the ancient custom of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/5426/759\">standing during the Torah reading of the 10 commandments</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>The Torah was never published, so it is copyrighted until the death of God, which is impossible. The \"Torah\" is so much more than just the five books of Moses; it is a collection of divine ideas. Thus it isn't copyrighted at all, but patented. Assuming the patent has not yet expired, it is licensed to us under the terms outlined in Exodus and Deuteronomy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Hashem gave the Jewish people the Torah, as stated many times in the prayers. Hence, it now belongs to the Jewish people. Since the Jewish people will never cease, neither will their copyright on the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>It could be argued that the Torah was really given to the generation of Sinai, and that we merely inherited it, in which case it would be in the public domain. However, several individuals from that generation are still alive, such as Serach bas Asher and Pinchas (who is Eliyahu). And American law states that the copyright does not expire until <a href=\"http://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf\">70 years after the last surviving author’s death</a>. Presumably, since the Author permanently gave away His Work<sup>1</sup>, the law would consider the last beneficiary's death.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the Jewish people retain the copyright at least until 70 years past the deaths of all people who were at Mount Sinai, and possibly until 70 years past the death of the Jewish people. ח\"ו.</p>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> The Torah says, לא בשמים היא, which the Talmud says means that our interpretation is given <em>halachic</em> precedence over Hashem's.</p>\n\n\n",

And this is the Minhag of Aram Soba from the olden days that all the traditions of Purim were practiced both days (and even read the Torah with a Berakhah, only on the Megillah there was no Berakhah). This Minhag continued with the orginal settlers of Aram Soba (before the Sephardim of the Spanish Inquisition). However, when the Musta'arbim combined with the Sepharadim, all the traditions faded, except the reading of the Megillah on Shushan Purim without a Berakhah, which still is practiced today in Halab.</p>\n\n\n",

One\n  who does not know how to read the haftarah should not be called for\n  maftir. Everything we said concerning the reading of the haftarah,\n  including the unique stature of this aliyah, applies both on Shabbat\n  and Yom Tov.</p>\n  \n  <p>One receiving an aliyah must read along with ba'al korei. If he does\n  not, then the berachot he recites are rendered berachot le'vatalah\n  (wasted berachot) according to the view of the Shulhan Aruch.\n  Therefore, one who does not know how to read may not receive an\n  aliyah.</p>\n  \n  <p>For this reason, a blind person should preferably not be called to the\n  Torah, as he cannot read along with the ba'al korei. However, places\n  where the custom has been to give aliyot to the blind need not change\n  their practice. In Eress Yisrael, the practice follows the ruling of\n  the Mehaber (139:3) not to call blind people to the Torah. Even if the\n  only kohen present is blind, a Yisrael should be called for the first\n  aliyah. In extenuating circumstances, such as when a blind person has\n  a \"yarssheit\" and very much wishes to receive an aliyah, he may be\n  given the maftir aliyah, since seven people have already been called\n  to the Torah in fulfillment of the day's obligation. We may then, in\n  these extreme situations, rely on the ruling of the Maharil allowing\n  the blind to receive aliyot. However, this is on condition that the\n  blind person knows how to read the haftarah properly either by heart\n  or by reading Braille. This is how I ruled when an actual case of this\n  sort arose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.oztorah.com/2007/04/a-braille-haftarah-ask-the-rabbi/\">See also here.</a></p>\n\n\n",

For purposes of this question I'm going to go with the common modern-day interpretation: a werewolf undergoes involuntary transformation into wolf form at the full moon, losing most of its human instincts, and typically hunts and gorges on something before returning to human form in the morning with few if any memories.  If you had some other kind of werewolf in mind, you should specify.</p>\n\n<p>All of these holidays will pose problems for our werewolf because the full moon rises at sunset, which is before festivities can be concluded (or in some cases even started), but his transformation into wolf form commences with the appearance of the full moon.  If you follow the minority opinion that it's the <em>sight</em> of the full moon that does it then you might be able to prevent transformation for a time, but the majority seem to hold that the transformation happens at moonrise with or without consent.</p>\n\n<p>One possibility is that he's not obligated in mitzvot while in wolf form (because only human Jews are obligated).  If he is obligated, though, he's going to face some challenges:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Pesach:</strong> First off, you're asking a ravenous wolf to sit quietly for the reading of the haggadah and ensuing discussion before we get to the meal?  And that's assuming that either he retains his opposable thumbs or has a helper to assist him with the haggadah and the ritual food items.  Naturally he's going to have trouble saying \"matzah\", \"maror\", and \"Pesach\", because lupine vocal cords are different, calling into question whether he even fulfills his seder obligation.  We might look here to the laws of the mute for guidance.</p>\n\n<p>It is possible that the wolf gains special status to offset these difficulties, because a wolf is a dog and the dogs were rewarded during the exodus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sukkot:</strong> Spending all night outdoors under the stars?  He'll be all over that.  It would be a kindness to put a doggie bed in the sukkah.  By morning he should return to human form, so lulav will not be a problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tu Bishvat:</strong> Wolves are obligate carnivores.  A meal of fruit and nuts is <em>not</em> going to cut it.  Since the Tu Bishvat seder is <em>minhag</em> and not <em>halacha</em> anyway, he should just skip it.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, rumor has it that werewolves take damage from silver, so just to be safe, he should make sure that any kiddush cup he touches is not silver.  Because \"baruch atah <em>owww!</em>\" does not contribute to sanctification of the day.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 15)\n\n<p>Listen.

He must be careful, however, to eat any food he has killed that evening while sitting in the sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>Most fortunate is Tu Ba'av, which occurs right after a period of required abstention from meat eating. לא היו ימים טובים לישראל כחמישה עשר באב - a great day indeed!</p>\n\n<p>The other yomim tovim represent no peril, as they occur at other times of the month.</p>\n\n<p>Since the person in question is simultaneously half-wolf and half-man at the point of transformation, we may point to another halachic half-man in the middle of a transformation - A chatzi-eved/chatzi-ben chorin. As half free, he has an obligation to observe all the mitzvos of bal yira'eh and chametz, but eating the korban pesach is a special exception.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal say (Pesachim 88) that an eved with two masters may not eat from the Korban Pesach from either one. This is because each half is makpid on his ownership of the slave, and this precludes the other half from being yotzei with the other's korban (rashi and tosfos, ibid.)

Additionally, we must be choshesh for the shittah that the korban pesach may be eaten until amud hashachar! If a werewolf finds himself released back into human form due to clouds covering the moon or any other method <strong><em>before amud hashachar,</em></strong> then he <strong><em>must</em></strong> eat at least a kezayis of the korban without a bracha (Safek lehakel). </p>\n\n<p>As always, special care must be taken that, in his enthusiasm, he not eat it raw.</p>\n\n\n",

From what I see throughout תנ״ך, it appears he does His tasks highly emotionally.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The Rambam referenced in the question actually deals with the many times in Tanach in which we ascribe emotions to Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=x-0XAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA87&dq=rambam%20%22divine%20anger%22&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JEvrVOXlJsGgNt-BgoAG&ved=0CB8Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=wmotion&f=false\">chapter 55 in Moreh Nevuchim</a>, the Rambam discusses Hashem's \"emotion\" as a literary device used to convey meaning to us an audience. Emotions and moods are transient in nature, and are impossible for the unchanging perfection of Hashem. \"Wanting\" something means that there is something you are lacking, \"anger\" means something doesn't follow your intent, etc. </p>\n\n<p>When we use these phrases, it is to explain to us that the manner in which there is a \"response\" from Hashem is <strong><em>as if</em></strong> he were angry, jealous, happy, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In reality, what is changing is our relationship to Hashem - the rest flows as an inevitable reaction to the changes <strong><em>we</em></strong> make in that relationship.</p>\n\n<p>A very similar answer is given regarding prayer - we aren't \"changing Hashem's mind\" when we pray, we are changing who we are in our relationship to alter how we interact with Hashem, and the (hopefully desired) results flow from there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Notwithstanding all of the above quotes I would strongly suggest that God does have emotions otherwise it would be perfectly impossible for us to love God.

The\nGemara responds: This is not difficult. This statement, that God\ncries, is referring to the innermost chambers, where He can cry in\nsecret, whereas this statement, that He does not cry, is referring to\nthe outer chambers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Good question. After the flood, Genesis recounts G-d in a state of regret, “His heart was saddened.”</p>\n<p>Radak explains that: “When it says that He ‘regretted,’ this is the Torah speaking in human terms (Rabbi Ishmael), for in truth, ‘He is not human that He should change his mind [le-hinahem]’ (I Sam. 15:29), for in the Almighty there is no change of will.” Ibn Ezra and Maimonides agreed that the Torah ascribes emotions to G-d figuratively.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whenever any one of His actions is perceived by us, we ascribe to G-d\nthat emotion which is the source of the act when performed by\nourselves, and call Him by an epithet which is formed from the verb\nexpressing that emotion. We see, e.g., how well He provides for the\nlife of the embryo of living beings; how He endows with certain\nfaculties both the embryo itself and those who have to rear it after\nits birth, in order that it may be protected from death and\ndestruction, guarded against all harm, and assisted in the performance\nof all that is required [for its development]. Similar acts, when\nperformed by us, are due to a certain emotion and tenderness called\nmercy and pity. G-d is, therefore, said to be merciful: e.g., \"Like as\na father is merciful to his children, so the L-rd is merciful to them\nthat fear Him\" (Ps. ciii. 13); \"And I will spare them, as a man\nspareth (yaḥamol) his own son that serveth him\" (Mal. iii. 17). Such\ninstances do not imply that G-d is influenced by a feeling of mercy,\nbut that acts similar to those which a father performs for his son,\nout of pity, mercy and real affection, emanate from G-d solely for the\nbenefit of His pious men, and are by no means the result of any\nimpression or change--[produced in G-d].--When we give something to a\nperson who has no claim upon us, we perform an act of grace; e.g.,\n\"Grant them graciously unto us\" (Judges xxi. 22). [The same term is\nused in reference to G-d, e.g.] \"which G-d hath graciously given\"\n(Gen. xxxiii. 5); \"Because G-d hath dealt graciously with me\" (ib.\n11). Instances of this kind are numerous. G-d creates and guides\nbeings who have no claim upon Him to be created and guided by Him; He\nis therefore called gracious (ḥannun)--His actions towards mankind\nalso include great calamities, which overtake individuals and bring\ndeath to them, or affect whole families and even entire regions,\nspread death, destroy generation after generation, and spare nothing\nwhatsoever. Hence there occur inundations, earthquakes, destructive\nstorms, expeditions of one nation against the other for the sake of\ndestroying it with the sword and blotting out its memory, and many\nother evils of the same kind. Whenever such evils are caused by us to\nany person, they originate in great anger, violent jealousy, or a\ndesire for revenge. G-d is therefore called, because of these acts,\n\"jealous,\" \"revengeful,\" \"wrathful,\" and \"keeping anger\" (Nah. i. 2)\nthat is to say, He performs acts similar to those which, when\nperformed by us, originate in certain psychical dispositions, in\njealousy, desire for retaliation, revenge, or anger: they are in\naccordance with the guilt of those who are to be punished, and not the\nresult of any emotion: for He is above all defect! The same is the\ncase with all divine acts: though resembling those acts which emanate\nfrom our passions and psychical dispositions, they are not due to\nanything superadded to His essence. (Friedlander translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"For He is above all defect!\"  Since God is perfect, G-d does not have human emotions. According to Rambam, G-d does not become angry. When the Bible says that G-d becomes angry this is there to prompt people to act properly. The Rambam continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You, no doubt, know the Talmudical saying, which includes in itself\nall the various kinds of interpretation connected with our subject. It\nruns thus: “The Torah speaks according to the language of man,” that\nis to say, expressions, which can easily be comprehended and\nunderstood by all, are applied to the Creator. Hence the description\nof G-d by attributes implying corporeality, in order to express His\nexistence: because the multitude of people do not easily conceive\nexistence unless in connection with a body, and that which is not a\nbody nor connected with a body has for them no existence. (Guide for\nthe Perplexed 1.26; Friedlander translation, p. 111)[1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[1] From Dr. Yair Barkai’s essay “The L-rd and Regret.”</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Examples of considerations when bringing gifts to religious Jews\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am interested in examples of things one might into account when buying gifts for religious Jews of various stripes. I always have trouble buying gifts myself because I am worried that something I buy will violate either Jewish law, the person's minhag, or his group's engrained cultural preferences. Some examples I have run up against include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Food or drink -- Here, pretty much everything can be a problem, including spirits </li>\n<li>Clothes and accessories -- Does it contain shatnez? Is it tznius enough to wear, right down to the colors? Does it contain any symbolism or associations that could possibly be offensive or unwearable for any reason? (For example--I was going to buy a Magen David necklace for a girl, only to be told that her community doesn't \"do\" that. Same with red string)</li>\n<li>Home decorations -- Is art or craftwork by a non-Jew acceptable? Are there certain themes or motifs that should be avoided? (Again, the concern of problematic symbols/associations) ...Is a picture OK if it contains an image of a woman's face, or perhaps a non-kosher animal, for example? </li>\n<li>Books -- Presumably, this is forbidden territory, unless you are very familiar with the person or family's preferences and hashkafa</li>\n<li>Gadgets -- if it is intended to be a full-time-use gadget, is it usable on Shabbos/Yom Tov?</li>\n<li>Music -- Are recordings of music composed or performed by non-Jews generally acceptable? What about kol isha?</li>\n<li>Toys for children -- What if it's a dinosaur/a non-kosher animal/a too-anatomically-correct doll? What if it's something related to a television or popular culture character? </li>\n<li>Dishware or kitchen appliances -- Can it be kashered? Toiveled? Will there be any problems from a kashrus perspective?</li>\n<li>Quilts or bed linens -- Presumably, these should be avoided as a wedding present, since one doesn't know what size(s) they use (unless it is on their registry)</li>\n<li>Gift certificates for a store or an experience -- How do we know for sure that their community has not forbidden it, and/or that the company is not one accused of non-kosher attitudes or actions? Are any stores \"safe\"?</li>\n<li>Items brought on Shabbos that would involve a melacha for the guest or host to bring or use or prepare (for example, flowers)</li>\n<li>Something chametz-containing during Pesach</li>\n<li>In general: items with possible connection to avodah zara, hukkat ha-goyim, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27257/purchasing-products-that-were-not-manufactured-in-a-torahdik-manner\">non-Torahddik manufacture</a>, or any number of other prohibitions and quasi-prohibitions that could potentially be of issue. Also: Stuff where the manufacturer may be on the wrong side of debates related to Israel and/or issues involving Jews (A necklace from Zara? A recording of Chopin?)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>...Clearly, one shouldn't buy a shaving set for a frum man, a hair decoration for a frum (married) woman, or a honeyed ham or a poinsettia plant for anyone. But the extent of the \"rules\" is vast; they are complicated, and not easily gleaned by anyone who has not interacted for years with frum communit(ies). </p>\n\n<p>Can anyone add to my list, and/or give guidelines for navigating it? Perhaps there are some categories which should be avoided wholesale, such as food or drink. Alternatively, please suggest some \"safe\" gifts that should be welcome in all groups--keeping in mind that one can't, or may not want to, give a check for <em>every</em> occasion (and there isn't always a registry). </p>\n\n<p>Further examples of \"ok\" and \"not ok\" gifts or categories--globally or for particular groups--as well as any general pointers that have not been mentioned, would all be welcome as standalone answers. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think that knowing what is socially acceptable to gift, you should be fine, but you have to know who you are giving to. It's always appropriate to ask if someone keeps <em>cholov yisroel</em> or does not listen to non-Jewish music. Most people who are more <em>machmir</em> tend to understand that they are more stringent and others ours, and will not find it insulting, but will be touched that you care enough to buy a present. However...</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>FOODS : Dairy : Ask if your host is <em>cholov yisroel</em>. It avoids a lot of awkwardness, and it's not a weird or blunt question. </p>\n\n<p>Pareve : anything with a <em>hechsher</em> from this list <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/agency_list.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.crcweb.org/agency_list.php</a> is acceptable</p>\n\n<p>Meat : Just avoid meat. I don't think it's wise to bring a piece of steak for someone's birthday anyway, unless explicitly asked</p></li>\n<li><p>CLOTHING : I would shy away from giving shirts, pants, or skirts unless you are close with the person. A nice sweater that you don't estimate would be too tight would be nice, but probably without any images or too-bright colors. Needing an undershirt is acceptable (in most places) but not that low-cut; know who you are giving it to, and if you see them wearing something of that style, it is probably okay.</p>\n\n<p>With jewelry, know the person as well. Just don't give anyone something too flashy, a red string (because people view <em>ayin hara</em> differently), or <em>magen davids</em>, unless you've seen them wear one previously. Most people, however, are fine with them. </p></li>\n<li><p>HOME DECOR : Try shying away from images of people, but a nice vase is always appreciated. With paintings, if you haven't seen the persons house and style of decoration, do not get; some people like to decorate with pictures of Rebbeim, others with Jewish-feel paintings, others with nature. </p></li>\n<li><p>BOOKS : Anything frum is always good. A Haggadah or a book about a Gadol is always a nice addition to every collection. </p></li>\n<li><p>GADGETS : I think these are good to go. Just because something can be used on shabbos doesn't mean you cannot have it at all. </p></li>\n<li><p>MUSIC : If you are honestly unsure of the family's <em>hashkafa</em>, either get Classical Music or the newest Jewish hit. </p></li>\n<li><p>TOYS : Books, brain games, board games, and blocks are always great gifts for kids. Most are okay with a non-kosher animal, but can be easily avoided. </p></li>\n<li><p>DISHWARE : I would stick to new dishes, but you do not have to <em>toivel</em> them yourself. I think some would prefer to do it themselves, just for the security of it, but if you bought it, <em>toiveled</em> it, and then wish to gift it, that's also fair game.  </p></li>\n<li><p>QUILTS : Keep with couch decorations. Get nice pillows or a blanket that can also be used for the couch. </p></li>\n<li><p>GIFT CERTIFICATES : Any department store or a Bed Bath and Beyond-type place would definitely be all right. </p></li>\n<li><p>BOUGHT ON SHABBOS : Do not buy anything on Shabbos for someone else. They would probably not know, but if they did, would make them feel uncomfortable. Similarly, do not gift any <em>chometz</em> item on <em>Pesach</em>, as neither of you can own it. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I would suggest that for <em>Shabbos</em> gifts, you bring some <em>pareve</em> desert, fruit, or a flowers or candle (if brought before <em>Shabbos</em>). </p>\n\n<p>For birthdays or Bat/Bar Mitzvahs, you buy a <em>Siddur</em>, <em>Pirkei Avos</em>, or a different <em>sefer</em>. <em>Tzedakah</em> in the person's honor is always welcome.

Studies have shown that 99.9% (Eliyahu Hanavi) of people experience Yahrtzeit to either a family member or themselves at some point. Unfortunately,   Modern day treatments have only come so far.

Torah inheritance law says sons are heirs through thing that cannot change (chukat mishpat), and no waiving of different right can change this status. But the halachic system has other ways that are known, especially the shtar chatzi zachar and deathbed gifts—that do basically same results, so daughters can get equal parts through debt and gift structures and not real inheritance.</p>\n<p>Priority status: If the estate is not enough for both sons inheritance and daughters maintenance, daughters maintenance takes full priority, even if sons must ask for tzedakah (Shulchan Aruch, Even HaEzer 112). This very big priority shows that maintenance works like prior lien, not right you can negotiate.\nNone of these things are yerusha though. They are debts and obligations that are put on the estate, collected from it before or together with inheritance distribution. The daughter never becomes \"heir\", she stays creditor.</p>\n<p>The daughter dont need to waive nothing. Instead, the father makes arrangement during his lifetime that basically makes sure equal distribution when he dies, while the Torah inheritance structure stays technically same. This is the elegant halachic balance: keeping the formal authority of divine law while allowing practical accommodations that show contemporary family values and stop the discord and resentment that strict application might cause otherwise.</p>\n\n\n",

Many spices are considered to not require supervision when by themselves. Blends require either supervision or a thorough spec sheet to ensure that the blend only contains spices (some blends use flavorants, sugars, and the like).</p>\n\n<p>So the majority of spices used in pickling don't require checking. If the pickling plant has supervision itself inspecting the production of pastrami, perhaps particular precision pertaining to the provision of piquancy is not compulsory.</p>\n\n\n",

Does the owner have  to abide by the beth din and make sure to pay for a license?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It would seem to be that this establishment is not to be patronized and or trusted to be serving kosher food unless they have a kosher certification.</p>\n\n<p>This is based on a rule enacted by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Four_Lands\" rel=\"nofollow\">Vaad Ha'arba Artzot</a> - The Council of the Four Lands, the central body of Jewish authority in Poland from 1580 to 1764. The Vaad\ninstituted that it is forbidden to eat any food or drink any wine from anyone, even someone who is assumed to be trustworthy, unless the person has a letter from a head of a Rabbinical Court testifying to the Kashruth of the food.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדרכי תשובה יו\"ד סי' קי\"ט סע' א' אות ו', הלחם הפנים, ועוד אחרונים:\n  תקנת ועד ארבע ארצות שלא לאכול שום מאכל או לשתות ײן מאדם אחר אפילו ממי\n  שהוא מוחזק בכשרות אלא א״כ יש בידו כתב הכשר מאיזה רב אב״ד שנעשה בהכשר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The predominant opinion is to assume that this enactment only applies to establishments, but a private person can be generally trusted. Although there is a concept in Halacha called עד אחד נאמן באיסורין - that generally people who are trustworthy are believed to verify the kashrus of food, nonetheless the Vaad made this enactment. This is the source for modern day Kashruth Certifications. However, there is a debate if this enactment was for only their times, or if this was an enactment for all generations. However, in the Sefer \"<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50568&hilite=4ba31614-6dff-4936-817e-13403918f4cf&st=%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A0%D7%AA+%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93+%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A2+%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%AA+%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%90+%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9D+%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%9C+\" rel=\"nofollow\">B'nesivos Hakashrus</a>\"  the author writes Vaad did mean in for all generations. </p>\n\n<p>Thus it would appear to be that nowadays if a restaurant were to operate without a certificate attesting to its kasruth from the Beth Din, despite the fact they claim the food is kosher,nonetheless it would seem to be prohibited to procure food that establishment. </p>\n\n<p>Ultimatly this is how the Author cited above concludes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל מוכר שאינו מכיר את המורכבות והמסובכות בכשרות שבזמנינו ואינו יודע\n  מספיק ממה  .צריך להזהר, אע״פ שהוא מוחזק בכשרות אין לקנות אצלו כמבואר\n  חילוקי הדינים בפנים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, one who is not well versed in the intricacies of the Laws of Kashruth in our times, and does not what of what to be concerned for, even though he is a trustworthy person, nonetheless one should not acquire food from him.</p>\n\n\n",

And Lukshon Kuggle is very unhealthy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A little bit of history is in order. According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumptuary_law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first written Greek law code (Locrian code), by Zaleucus in the\n  7th century BC, stipulated that:</p>\n  \n  <p>A free-born woman may not be accompanied by more than one female\n  slave, unless she is drunk; she may not leave the city during the\n  night, unless she is planning to commit adultery; she may not wear\n  gold jewelry or a garment <strong>with a purple border</strong>, unless she is a\n  courtesan...\n  [Later, in the Roman empire] Only the Roman Emperor could wear the symbol of his office, a Tyrian purple cape trimmed in golden thread, and Roman senators were the only ones who could wear the badge of their office, a Tyrian purple stripe on their toga. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In the Megillah as well we find: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אִם-עַל-הַמֶּלֶךְ טוֹב, יֵצֵא דְבַר-מַלְכוּת מִלְּפָנָיו, וְיִכָּתֵב\n  בְּדָתֵי פָרַס-וּמָדַי, וְלֹא יַעֲבוֹר:  אֲשֶׁר לֹא-תָבוֹא וַשְׁתִּי,\n  לִפְנֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ, וּמַלְכוּתָהּ יִתֵּן הַמֶּלֶךְ,\n  לִרְעוּתָהּ הַטּוֹבָה מִמֶּנָּה. וְנִשְׁמַע פִּתְגָם הַמֶּלֶךְ\n  אֲשֶׁר-יַעֲשֶׂה בְּכָל-מַלְכוּתוֹ, <strong>כִּי רַבָּה הִיא</strong>; וְכָל-הַנָּשִׁים,\n  יִתְּנוּ יְקָר לְבַעְלֵיהֶן--לְמִגָּדוֹל, וְעַד-קָטָן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As should be well-known by now, the problem of Vashti was that she was a <a href=\"https://divinity.uchicago.edu/sightings/rabbi-rabba-maharat-rabbanit-orthodox-jewish-women-whats-title\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbah</a> who did not respect her husband, the king. Many have written that the problem with a Rabbah is that which Maimonides codifies:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין מעמידין אישה במלכות--שנאמר \"מלך\" (דברים יז,טו), ולא מלכה; וכן כל\n  משימות שבישראל, אין ממנים בהם אלא איש.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This explains why Mordechai was allowed to wear the king's clothing, including purple: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּמָרְדֳּכַי יָצָא מִלִּפְנֵי הַמֶּלֶךְ, בִּלְבוּשׁ מַלְכוּת תְּכֵלֶת\n  וָחוּר, וַעֲטֶרֶת זָהָב גְּדוֹלָה, וְתַכְרִיךְ בּוּץ <strong>וְאַרְגָּמָן</strong>;\n  וְהָעִיר שׁוּשָׁן, צָהֲלָה וְשָׂמֵחָה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem of Vashti was that she disrespected her husband. Since the halachah follows the opinion that \"a man's home is his castle,\" it follows that Mordechai was the king of his home. However, allowing purple messiahs would violate not only ancient Greek and Roman sumptuary laws, but also perhaps the laws against Rabbahs and female kings that Vashti violated. </p>\n\n\n",

There are various opinions.</p>\n\n<p>\"Latte\" is steamed milk. The amount of foam created by the steaming is too minute to worry that this overpowers the pot of meat to give it any taste, as it is mostly air. Then, I assume that milk chocolate is drizzled on top. Milk chocolate is mainly chocolate to which a small percentage of milk has been added. If they just drizzle a bit of this on the latte foam, again, too little to be concerned about the problem.</p>\n\n<p>If, however the latte is made by melting the milk chocolate into the coffee and then steaming extra milk and putting it on top, there might be a concern that the beverage is primarily milk, and perhaps, the volume of milk may have made your pot milchig.</p>\n\n<p>My bigger concern , here, is not the <em>basar bechalav</em> problem which is <em>assur behana'ah</em>, but the mere fact that you bought Starbuck's coffee which is overpriced and overrated.

    "content": "# Was Ankhmahor really Yosef?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was reading an article today on circumcision a news website I frequent. It displayed a picture from the <a href=\"http://www.ancient-egypt.org/_v3d/glossary/people/ankhmahor.html\">tomb of Ankhmahor</a>, a high ranking Egyptian official that was, apparently, responsible for mass circumcisions in Egypt. This is the earliest archeological evidence we have for Bris Milah.</p>\n\n<p>My mind immediately went to the story about how Yosef demanded that the Mitzrim circumcise themselves in order to receive grain from his storehouse during the famine. There are other significant similarities between the two personalities which lead me to wonder:</p>\n\n<p>Is it possible to identify the historic Ankhmahor with the biblical Yosef?</p>\n\n<p>More details:\nAnkhmahor is similar to Imhotep his importance to Egypt, he was called \"first\" to Pharoah (Yosef was called Av), called \"physician\" even though he wasn't. The first scene in his tomb is agricultural (referencing the feast/famine?), followed by artisans presenting goods (amassing egyptian wealth), followed by circumcision. Seems to fit the structure of Chumash. Like Imhotep, he was known as a \"Ra priest.\" Imhotep's tomb is unknown, but rumored to be in Saqqara like Ankhmahor's tomb. Ankhmahor's tomb has extremely strong words for people disturbing it, but I can't find anything about the condition of his mummy, or whether it even exists (possibly taken out of egypt?).</p>\n\n<p>But it was really the circumcision that drove the comparison home for me and made everything click.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'll give it a try. There are some inaccuracies in your question that should be clarified before considering the question of Ankhmahor as Yosef.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>This is not \"the earliest archeological evidence we have for Bris Milah.\" It was once thought to be, but that award now goes to a recently discovered relief fragment of two children being circumcised, found in the pyramid of king Djedkare from the 5th Dynasty. The children are either from the king's family or of the king with his <em>ka</em>. In any case, the depiction is in a funerary temple and part of the divine-birth myth often attributed to such kings.</li>\n<li>The tomb of Ankhmahor is no longer considered a depiction of circumcision. It was once thought to be, but most Egyptologists currently understand the scene as a depiction of pubic shaving as part of the ritual purification of a funerary priest (Grunert, Megahed) or an operation for treating a foreskin infection called paraphimosis (Spiegelman). </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Even if we rule out the circumcision, it would be hard to prove Yosef's identity one way or the other. Apart from the evidence you provide in your question, here is more information that supports or detracts from the Yosef assertion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>There is no body in the sarcophagus because it was robbed. It's not clear when this happened, but the robbers made a large, round hole in order to physically remove Ankhmahor's body.</li>\n<li>All Egyptologists agree the tomb is from the Sixth Dynasty, between Teti's reign to Pepy I. As mentioned in the comments, this complicates the match with Yosef by hundreds of years. </li>\n<li>Ankmahor has at least four sons depicted in his tomb. </li>\n<li>If Ankhmahor <em>was</em> Yosef, it would make sense that Ankhmahor's most frequent title was \"Zzj Sesi,\" described as \"his beautiful name.\" Perhaps related to Yosef as <em>yefeh to'ar vifeh mareh</em>.</li>\n<li>His other titles, \"overseer of works,\" \"overseer of the great court,\" \"master architect of the king,\" indicate that he was a vizier of the king. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>All that said, considering the chronology and the circumcision debunking, there does not seem much to argue in favor of the position that Ankhmahor is Yosef. </p>\n\n<h2>Sources</h2>\n\n<p>My sources are academic, so their links won't work unless you have institutional/library database access.

One point that he makes is that one rabbi said that he heard from many exceptional rabbis that on Shabbat we aren't so punctilious about the time for reciting Shema because the commandment to enjoy Shabbat is biblical while the time for Shema may be only rabbinic.</p>\n\n<p>If we assume that the time limitation is only rabbinic then it is possible that the recitation in the synagogue even after the prescribed time <em>is</em> the real thing (for those who haven't already said it) because it is a fulfillment of the biblical commandment to recite Shema even if it is not a fulfillment of the rabbinic time limit. Thus, it would not be surprising if some congregants engaged in practices that would be indicative of it being the real thing.</p>\n\n<p>Whether you accept the above argument or not, the two practices you mentioned are probably <em>not</em> actually indicative of treating it as the real thing.

The law as codified in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x435\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 65:2</a> is that one must join the congregation for the first verse of Shema so as not to appear as if he is not accepting the yoke of the kingdom of heaven along with them.

For example in your case, as you have stated, this person does not keep kosher (eating kosher only in the house is not called eating kosher, it just means he is a mumar leteavon - someone who transgress not out of spite but rather out of desire eg. A mouthwatering ham sandwich that he cant \"live without\") thus if were to claim that a specific food is 100% kosher, he is not to be believed unless he has a certification from a known Rabbi attesting to the kashruth of the food and that the food is under supervision.

We read the <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/1775/759\">birkat hamzaon</a> aloud for the sake of those who do not know the blessings.  In both cases, we assume that many people do not have a siddur or cannot read, and that they have not memorized the words.  So, why do we not repeat the <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/prayer/shema.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shema</a> in shul (and the blessings before and after), for the same reasons?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>The Gra writes (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40255&st=&pgnum=2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shenot Eliyahu to Brachot 1:1</a>) that you have to read Shema yourself and you cannot fulfill your obligation by listening to another. (This is not universally agreed to, but see the next point.)</p>\n\n<p>As for the blessings, the whole point of having a Chazzan starting from (just before) Barchu is for him to recite the blessings of Keriat Shema out loud to fulfill everyone's obligation. Like by Birkat HaMazon (and unlike Shemoneh Esrei), even someone who knows how to recite the blessings can listen and fulfill his obligation from the Chazzan. This is the agreed upon Halacha (Rambam Brachot 9, OC 59).</p>\n\n<p>The Rosh writes in a responsum (4:19) that since the blessings of Keriat Shema are long and one might space out for a moment and miss some words, he would recited along with the Chazzan in an undertone (and finish a moment early in order to say Amen). (This is again just like many people's practice for <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/36588/759\">Zimmun</a> at Birkat HaMazon if they fear for spacing out.) The Shulchan Arukh quotes this recommendation approvingly (OC 59:4).</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays unfortunately in many congregations the Chazzan is not careful to do his job. I know of no old source approving this change in traditional practice. (I have heard some argue that by reciting the openings and closings of the blessings aloud, Chazzanim have provided a minimally acceptable way for one to fulfill his obligation. This strikes me as a post-facto justification for the practice.)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>BTW the reason we recite Birkat HaMazon out loud in a Zimmun is not because of people who don't know how to say it. It's to do a Mitzva publicly together (Brachot 45a). If someone there doesn't know how to say it, you can recite it for him even without a Zimmun (ShA OC 193:1).</p>\n\n\n",

This one's relatively straightforward.</p>\n\n<p>As for a non-Jewish man: Judaism prohibits intermarriage. Now sadly, there are plenty of non-observant Jewish women who marry non-Jewish men anyhow. Usually there will be conversations about how they will affiliate, and especially with which faith to raise the kids. (Jewish law views the children of a Jewish mother as always Jewish.) In some situations the husband may convert -- if he's sincere about it, great. Sometimes he may feel pressured to do a quickie conversion that he doesn't really believe in, which isn't ideal from the standpoint of Jewish law nor their relationship.</p>\n\n<p>People are complicated!</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, if the man is a Kohen (i.e. his ancestors were priests in the Temple), he's only allowed to marry a born-Jewish woman who was never divorced (widowed is okay), nor ever had a non-Jewish \"boyfriend.\"</p>\n\n\n",

Since the loser does not willingly surrender the\n  wagered amount, the winner is considered to be stealing when he\n  collects, and is thus ineligible as a witness or judge.5</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Sheshet says this agreement is not considered an asmachta.\n  According to this opinion the only situations that involve asmachta\n  are when the individual relies on his own ability. Dice players\n  realize that the outcome of the game is determined by chance and not\n  their own personal skill6. Rather, dice players are disqualified\n  because they are not involved with furthering the general welfare of\n  society.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmud explains that the difference between these two opinions is\n  the case where the gambler learned another profession.</p>\n  \n  <p>Rami bar Hama would still disqualify the gambler by virtue of his\n  accepting winnings based on a non-binding asmachta agreement, whereas\n  according to Rav Sheshet he is eligible because his second occupation\n  is socially useful.7</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rami bar Hama the prohibition involved in gambling is not\n  the gambling itself but taking the winnings which involves the 'dust\n  of robbery'.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Rav Sheshet there is no prohibition in taking the\n  winnings, the problem is being a gambler. This occupation is\n  distasteful as is non productive. </p>\n  \n  <p>Tosaphot and the Mordechai explain that even according to the above mentioned opinion which permits \"Dice Playing\" as long as one has\n  another profession, it is only permitted to do so if the actual cash\n  is placed on the table and the money is transferred to the winner\n  immediately follwing his victory. If, however, there is no immediate\n  cash transaction but rather the game is based on Amanah, trust that\n  the loser will pay, then even according to the more lenient viewpoint\n  this is considered asmachta. There are those opinions that add that\n  even when the cash is placed on the table, the table must be jointly\n  owned by all players. Elsewhere18 the Mordechai further restricts the\n  aforementioned leniency, by distinguishing between gambling that\n  involves some form of skill and those that involve none. Only gambling\n  that involves no skill is permitted according to this lenient opinion.\n  The Shulhan Arukh follows the opinion of Rambam by classifying gambling as asmachta which would mean that the winner is not entitled\n  to the proceeds of his victory and retaining would be considered\n  stealing.22 However, like Rambam, he also only disqualifies the\n  gambler as a witness if gambling is his only means of livelyhood,23\n  thereby creating the same compromise between Rab Sheshat and Rami Bar\n  Hama as did Rambam. The Remah however disagrees with the Shulhan Arukh\n  and decides the law according to the Tosaphot and Mordechai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In Chabad Chassidus the example given to distinguish them is the difference between a house and clothing. Both surround, but clothing has to be sized to the individual.

If so, do they have any celebrations for their tribe?  Are all Rabbis descended from the tribe of Levi?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>After the reign of Solomon, the nation was divided into 2 kingdoms, North and South (the kingdoms of Israel and Judah respectively). The Northern Kingdom (sometimes called \"Ephraim\") was composed of most of the tribes while the southern kingdom, Judah, was made up mostly of Judah, Benjamin and some of Levi (though I have heard that there were a few stragglers from other tribes mixed into the southern kingdom). Because its mass was from Judah, a larger tribe, it was known as the Kingdom of Judah.</p>\n\n<p>The northern Kingdom was defeated and the tribes scattered. The southern kingdom was eventually defeated and sent to exile. What remains of modern Judaism came from that southern kingdom, the tribes of Benjamin and Judah and Levi. So priests and levites today are from Levi and everyone else is from the other 2 tribes.</p>\n\n<p>There are a few other nationalities which have tried to trace themselves to other tribes but for most of modern Jewry, one of those 3 suffices. We don't much celebrate this (maybe because it reminds us of such extreme loss) though there are separate laws for those from Levi on a day to day basis, and, eventually, a king will arise from Judah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rabbis today come from all tribes; there are no ancestral requirements for the job. Actually, if your ancestors were Temple priests (see below), you can't attend funerals unless they're of immediate family<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=21\" rel=\"nofollow\"> [Leviticus 21:1]</a>; so many synagogues do <em>not</em> want to hire a rabbi who's of priestly ancestry -- he can't do funerals!</p>\n\n<p>There are special synagogue honors for Levites, so many people today know they are Levites. The Kohen group (i.e. those who had been Temple priests) are a subset of the Levites. (As all Kohens are descended from Aaron, who was himself a great-grandson of Levi.) So many Jews today know they are a Levite or a Kohen. (If the latter, they do the priestly blessing <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=6\" rel=\"nofollow\">[Numbers 6:22]</a> in synagogue and receive certain other honors; if the former, they wash the Kohen's hands before the blessing and receive other honors.)</p>\n\n<p>No particular \"tribe\" celebration; though many, many Kohens in Israel make a point of going to the Western Wall and doing the priestly blessing on the Hebrew date of 1 Av (usually mid-to-late July), which is the day that Aaron died.</p>\n\n<p>Most Jews today know they are \"vanilla non-Levite\", as if you're not a Levite, your tribal ancestry today makes virtually no difference. If you've read through I & II Kings, you'll recall that Israel split into North and South kingdoms. Levi had cities scattered throughout both; but the South Kingdom, which lasted longer, consisted of Judah and Benjamin. And Judah was more numerous. (The population -- and significance -- of Judah out of all the tribes would be something like if you had one US state that was California, New York, Virginia, and Massachusetts combined.) So the average non-Levite Jew you meet today may occasionally know he's a Benjaminite; he may know he's a Judean, especially if he can trace his ancestry to some famous figure who was known to be descended from King David (himself a Judean). Many Ethiopian Jews are said to be of the tribe of Dan (Dan had belonged to the North Kingdom, but when the North Kingdom set up a pseduo-Temple with golden calves, legend has it that a bunch of Dannites said, \"forget this! We're going to Ethiopia!\"), and a group was recently found in India who said they were from Menashe. </p>\n\n<p>But your average Jew on the street, if he doesn't know he's Levite/Kohen, the odds are probably something like:</p>\n\n<p>70% Judean</p>\n\n<p>10% Benjaminite</p>\n\n<p>10% Levite</p>\n\n<p>10% Other</p>\n\n\n",

Why did Elohim refer to Us and Our, when in fact it was He and His? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"Eloha\" means a force. Pagans at the time believed there was one force in charge of life, one in charge of death, one in charge of day, one in charge of night, and so on.</p>\n\n<p>So the Jewish creation story is stressing that one God is \"all-forces\", i.e. in charge of everything, making everything. Hence the plural.</p>\n\n<p>Once God made the earth, the elements were in place for a natural progression, thus God says, \"let the earth produce vegetation.\" And so on, until the animals are around. At that point God turns to the earth and says -- \"to make humans, you [earth] & I -- i.e. we -- need to work together.\" The body is following the progression of nature, but the soul comes from God. </p>\n\n<p>(That's Nachmanides' reading.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The term is similar to the \"royal We\" that is used in English. That is, it is a matter of referring to the ruler in the plural. Consider the French usage of \"vous\" for you (plural) <strong>or</strong> as a sign of respect. In actuality, we see other usages as </p>\n\n<p>The Lord said to Moses, “See, I have made thee a god אֶלהִים, (Elohim) to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.”</p>\n\n<p>(Exodus 7:1)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly we see when speaking about a slave belonging to the master, we have the plural term ba'alim used, even though it refers to a single master.

The Rishonim debate whether the Gemara requires a minimum length\n  and width of four Amot (Rosh Hilchot Mezuza number 16) or just an area\n  of sixteen square Amot regardless of length and width (Rambam Hilchot\n  Mezuzah 6:2). For example, if an area is eight Amot long and two Amot\n  wide, it is sixteen Amot square, but is not four Amot wide. In such a\n  case, a Mezuzah is required according to the Rambam but not according\n  to the Rosh. This issue is quite relevant, as many walk-in closets\n  have narrow corridors but are quite long.</p>\n  \n  <p>Many individuals do not have Mezuzot attached to their walk-in\n  closets, and they certainly have many opinions upon which to rely. One\n  who adopts the strict view and attaches a Mezuzah to a walk-in closet\n  (either to the right or left side) should most likely omit the\n  Berachah in deference to the many opinions who rule that walk-in\n  closets do not require a Mezuzah.</p>\n  \n  <p>In practice, one should inquire of his Rav as to whether walk-in\n  closets and porches require a Mezuzah and to which side it should be\n  affixed. Moreover, it is highly recommended for one to invite his Rav\n  to visit his home for an inspection to insure that Mezuzot are affixed\n  in all of the required areas and that they are attached to the proper\n  side of the doorway.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In response to the question's edit I'll add a quote from the same site:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Akiva Eiger (commentary to Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 286:13) places a further limitation on the four by four Amot exemption. He believes that it does not apply if the area that is less than sixteen square Amot leads into an area that requires a Mezuzah. He rules that one is required to affix a Mezuzah to the right side as one leaves the small area into the larger area. Even though the small area is in and of itself exempted from a Mezuzah, one is required to affix a Mezuzah just as one places a Mezuzah on the doorway to his home. In that case, one places a Mezuzah on the right side entering the house, since one enters from an area that does not require a Mezuzah (the outside) to an area that requires a Mezuzah (one's home)...Although the Aruch HaShulchan (Y.D. 286:23) rules in accordance with Rav Akiva Eiger, some Acharonim dispute or limit his view... Rav Moshe Feinstein (Teshuvot Igrot Moshe Y.D. 1:181) writes that Rav Akiva Eiger's assertion is \"bewildering\" and that \"in practice one is not required to accommodate his view.\" Rav Ovadia Yosef (ad. loc.) does not even consider the opinion of Rav Akiva Eiger in his ruling (he cites Rav Moshe as one of his many precedents for this approach). > \n  <strong>A similar issue applies to affixing a Mezuzah to a porch (or a deck). A porch would seem not to require a Mezuzah, since it does not\n  have a roof (Shulchan Aruch Y.D. 286:14). However, one could claim\n  that it does require a Mezuzah either because it is normal for a porch\n  not to have a roof (similar to the approach of the Chamudei Daniel) or\n  that one should affix the Mezuzah on the right side as one enters the\n  house from the porch based on Rav Akiva Eiger. The Aruch HaShulchan\n  (ad. loc.) explicitly applies Rav Akiva Eiger's ruling to an area that\n  does not have a roof.</strong> A consensus view has not emerged among contemporary Poskim regarding this issue. The Chazon Ish (Y.D. 168:5) rules that one should affix a Mezuzah on the right side as one enters a house from a porch, while Rav Ovadia Yosef (ad. loc.) cites many Poskim, such as Rav Yaakov Emden and Rav Shlomo Kluger, who rule that it should be placed on the right side as one leaves one's home to enter the porch. Rav Yosef concludes that essentially a porch does not require a Mezuzah, but one who affixes a Mezuzah at the entrance to his porch \"will have a Berachah bestowed upon him.\" Rav Yosef rules that those who affix a Mezuzah to their porch entrance should do so on the right side as one leaves the house to enter the porch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This mitzvah is <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/613.htm\">listed</a> as one of the 613. I have been studying the sources and the discussion and am left with many questions, including \"why is there no bracha on this mitzvah?\" and \"is the essence the remembrance or the (particular) reading from the torah?\" but I'll skip that for this question:</p>\n\n<p>The gemara discusses in Megillah 18a that remembrance has to be performed through reading from a scroll (like a megillah or a torah) -- not by heart and not from anything else. In fact, this commanded remembrance is said to be the only min hatirah mandated torah reading! But there are 6 <a href=\"http://www.yeshiva.co/ask/?id=797\">zechirot</a> that we have in our siddurim including 3 which use the same imperative language of \"<a href=\"https://shaalvim.org/sfw/shiurim/view.asp?id=530\">zachor</a>\" as is used to tell us to read Parshet Amalek.</p>\n\n<p>If they are all zechirot, and the gemara says that zecher is performed through reading from a scroll, why are we not required to read the other sections of the torah at least once a year to be mekayem those mitzvot mide'orayta on the same level of magnitude as the zechira of Amalek?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>(Disclaimer that I have no sources for this, rather that I am disputing the basis of the question)</p>\n\n<p>Whenever we have a specific mitzva which is also included in the mitzva of talmud torah, such as zechiras yetzias metzraim, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/70273/why-hamokom-in-haggada/89650#89650\">v'higadta l'bincha</a>, or zechiras amalek, we do not make a specific bracha on that mitzva, as the bracha part of it is included in the talmud torah part. (However, according to some Rishonim one may have to make a special \"birchas hatorah\", such as ahava rabba, baruch hamakom, or asher bachar banu.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Adam masculine and feminine?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've gotten the advice to ask this question apart from another question i asked (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/55858/elohim-plural-singular\">Elohim plural singular</a>): so here it is</p>\n\n<p>Bereshit 5:1 reads according to my own words: <em>'In/On the day that Elohim created the human being (Adam), in the Demut of Elohim He made him (the human being), male (masculine) and female (feminine) He created them (the male and female) and He blessed them, and called their (the male and female human beings) name Human (Adam)'</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Bereshit 1:27 also reads: <em>'And Elohim created the human being (Adam) in His Tzelem, Elohim created him (the human) male (masculine) and female (feminine) He created them'</em>. </p>\n\n<p>Question:\n<strong>How could one human being be made made male and female or masculine and feminine, and how does that image fit to the Tzelem and Demut of Elohim?</strong> </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Tzelem and Demus cannot refer to a <strong>physical</strong> description of the being known as Adam. That is since Hashem is not in any way physical, the \"likeness\" means that Adam was created with the possibility of free will and with a spiritual dimension. Thus, the physical appearance does not matter in that respect. The being known as Adam was created as a \"unity\" with both male and female aspects in order to teach \"him\" that it was not possible (within this world) to live \"alone\". That is why he was initially created alone and the \"split\" into Adam and Chava.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, Hashem did not create a man and a woman seperately in order to teach the lesson that \"all men are created equal\". One must learn this lesson that we are all (men and women) from the same unique creation.</p>\n\n<p>For example:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/ci/w/48955181.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Men & Women: Jewish View of Gender Differences</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>To get a clear picture of the Jewish view of womanhood, we must go\n  back to the beginning – the Torah.</p>\n  \n  <p>In the first chapter of Genesis, the Torah chooses to refer to Adam in\n  the plural: God created the man in His image; in the image of God He\n  created him, male and female He created them. And God blessed them.\n  (Genesis 1:27-28)</p>\n  \n  <p>Why \"them\"? This was before the creation of Eve!</p>\n  \n  <p>The Jewish Oral Tradition provides us with a fascinating insight into\n  this grammatical oddity. The first human, it tells us, was really an\n  androgynous being, both male and female in one body, sophisticated and\n  self-sufficient.</p>\n  \n  <p>But if God had created such a complete human being, why the later\n  separation into two parts, into Adam and Eve? As God is the source of\n  everything, self-sufficiency would be a spiritual defeat. The answer\n  given is that God did not want this first human creation to be alone,\n  for it would then possess an illusion of self-sufficiency. Note that\n  there is no word for \"independence\" in classical Hebrew. (What we use\n  now, atzma'ut, is of modern vintage.) The concept of independence\n  doesn't exist in Jewish tradition. Aside from God, nothing and no one\n  is really independent. Since we are supposed to ingrain into ourselves\n  that God is the source of everything, self-sufficiency would have been\n  a spiritual defeat. God wanted to fashion the human being into two\n  separate people in order to create a healthy situation of dependence,\n  yearning, and mutual giving. Human beings are not meant to be alone\n  because then they would have no one to give to, no one to grow with,\n  and nothing to strive for. To actualize oneself spiritually, a human\n  being cannot be alone.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Why Not Identical Twins?</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>But why, then, didn't God create two identical beings? The answer is\n  that in order to maximize giving, the recipient must be different from\n  the giver. If the two are identical, giving can occur, but it is\n  limited. One would give based on his or her own needs, since the\n  receiver would have the exact same needs. To truly be a giver, the\n  person must take into account what the receiver needs and not only\n  what the giver wants. By giving to someone with different needs, a\n  person is trained to think and give on terms other than his or her\n  own.</p>\n  \n  <p>We see, then, that the separation had to be into two different beings,\n  in order for us to learn to appreciate, love, give, and care for those\n  unlike ourselves. This is fundamental to all moral and spiritual\n  growth. We can also understand why God didn't just create two beings\n  from the start: by starting as one, we can know and feel that our life\n  partners are our true complement, that we need them and their\n  differences just as they need us and ours.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Gender Differences</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>The Torah is a path to self-actualization, to spiritual growth. We\n  have seen that in order to grow, a person cannot be alone. Therefore\n  two beings were created. To maximize growth, the beings need to be\n  different, and so men and women were created as different beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The original creation, being one human being, contained both male and female elements.  Note that when God created Chava He <em>didn't</em> start over with clay; He <em>took part of Adam</em> as a starting point.  The \"creation\" of Chava was more like a separation of Adam into two parts, male and female.</p>\n\n<p>God does not have a physical form so \"in his image\" (and \"likeness\") cannot refer to physical aspects.  These concepts refer to spiritual aspects.  Rashi says that \"in his image\" (or \"form\") actually refers to the <em>process</em>, not the <em>result</em> -- God used a mold or die to make Adam.  (See below.)  Even if we don't accept that, though, whatever it is, it isn't a physical comparison of God and Adam.</p>\n\n<h2>Male and female</h2>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#showrashi=true&v=27\" rel=\"nofollow\">explains</a> that Adam had both male and female aspects in one body and were later separated:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>male and female He created them: Yet further (2:21) Scripture states: “And He took one of his ribs, etc.” The Midrash Aggadah (Gen. Rabbah 8:1, Ber. 61a, Eruvin 18a) explains that He originally created him with two faces, and afterwards, He divided him. [...] [from Baraitha of the Thirty Two Methods , Method 13]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h2>Image and form</h2>\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165#showrashi=true&v=26\" rel=\"nofollow\">understands</a> (\"in Our image\") as \"with Our mold/form/die\" and <em>kidmuteinu</em> (\"as Our likeness\") as referring to understanding and wisdom: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>26:<br>\n  in our image: in our form.  (Saperstein translation says \"mold\")<br>\n  after our likeness: to understand and to discern.</p>\n  \n  <p>27:<br>\n  And God created man in His image: [...] Man was made with a die, like a coin, which is made by means of a die, which is called coin in Old French. And so Scripture states (Job 38:14): “The die changes like clay.” - [from Letters of Rabbi Akiva , second version; Mid. Ps. 139:5; Sanh. 38a] </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The commentary in the Saperstein edition/translation of Rashi adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>According to <em>Maskil LeDavid</em>, Rashi speaks of a \"mold\" here rather than the \"form\" of God because he sees <em>b'tzalmeinu</em>, with the \"bet\" (\"in\" or \"with\") prefix, as a contrast to <em>kidmuteinu</em>, with the \"kaf\" (\"like\" or \"as\") prefix.  Had the verse here meant that man was to be created in God's form, it would have used <em>k'tzalmeinu</em>, \"like Our form\".  The \"bet\" is to be understood here in its sense of \"with, by means of\" -- let us create man with our mold.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>May I Quote:</strong></p>\n\n<p>We know from texts like the hymn Yigdal , which reflects the great Maimonides’ theological teachings, that G-d has no body. This prayer states, “He has no bodily form.” If G-d does not have a body, then G-d cannot have a sex. Sex is a physical attribute; it comprises biological categories like male and female. Gender, however, is a social construct that consists of the characteristics, expectations, assumptions and cultural meanings associated with sex. Gender and sex don’t always line up; sometimes men are “feminine” and sometimes women are “masculine” (as having masculine and feminine qualities). Because gender is not the same thing as sex, it might be possible for G-d to have a gender, even though G-d does not have a sex. In our tradition, G-d demonstrates characteristics of more than one gender (kind of like the human being G-d created in Genesis 1:27, which according to a literal reading was both male and female). Sometimes G-d is described as, “King of glory, mighty in battle” (Psalms 24:8) and other times G-d is depicted as a compassionate Source of life. If asked to identify these descriptions of G-d with a gender, most people would probably consider the former description masculine and the latter depiction as feminine.Some people feel threatened by feminine depictions of G-d, believing that they diminish the awesome, powerful and fear-inspiring aspects of G-d. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Paula Reimers notes that using masculine language for G-d not only reinforced the concept of G-d’s power, but also helped prevent the, “introduction of alien theological ideas [such as pagan goddesses] into the heart of monotheistic religion.” Now that Judaism is firmly established, we no longer need to be concerned about our religion dissolving into paganism. Feminine imagery of G-d does not in any way threaten Judaism. On the contrary, it enhances the Jewish understanding of G-d, which should not be limited to masculine metaphors. </p>\n\n<p>All language that humans use to describe G-d is only a metaphor. Using masculine and feminine metaphors for G-d is one way to remind ourselves that gendered descriptions of G-d are just metaphors. G-d is beyond gender.</p>\n\n<p><strong>If so: what did G-d ment by male and female?</strong> </p>\n\n<p><strong>Tzelem and Demus cannot refer to a physical description of the being known as Adam. That is since Hashem is not in any way physical, the \"likeness\". So the male and female making of the human being refer to spiritual part of the human being that contains characteristics, elements, qualities etc that can be defined masculine, feminine, neuter or both. \nAm I correct?</strong> </p>\n\n\n",

I don't have a source but I seem to recall that this urban legend began in the mid-to-late 00's when a rabbi from Moscow misinterpreted when a Russian-Jew living in Hamburg told him that their rabbi was upset that they were driving their Odessey at top speed on the aütobahn. The rabbi from Moscow did not understand the young German Jews' broken Russian and thought that the rabbi in Hamburg placed an \"auto ban\" on the Honda Odessey. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Anything called Odyssey is tainted by suspicion of <em>chochmos chitzoniyos</em>. Furthermore, both Honda (a parking meter-wielding sumo wrestler from a video game) and Odysseus (a fraudster and thief of truly Talmudic proportions) are horrible role models for Jews. As such, the Honda Odyssey is completely <em>treif</em> and any Rav certifying one is misleading the unsuspecting Orthodox public and should be ashamed to call himself a Rabbi. He might as well be a used car salesman!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question is so appropriate for this time of the year.

Granted, there may be other issues regarding how to preserve the body, etc. until the spaceship arrives and the return flight. Separate issue.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Although rabbinic literature has yet to discuss death on Mars, the issue of being wholly buried underground, and the various complications to that happening (e.g., state requirements for burial in a coffin, a corpse under water, a buried corpse with limbs above ground, etc.), have been discussed. My theoretical answer depends on the work of the Rambam, the only rabbinic authority I'm familiar with that discussed both the halakhot of burial and that of Mars.</p>\n<p>The halakha demands being buried in the ground (cf. Mishneh Torah, Evel, 4:4; Shulchan Arukh, Yoreh Deah 362), a mitzvah derived from the Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בזעת אפיך תאכל לחם עד שובך אל־האדמה כי ממנה לקחת כי־עפר אתה ואל־עפר תשוב</p>\n<p>By the sweat of your brow shall you get bread to eat, <strong>until you return to the earth</strong>--for from it you were taken. For dust you are, and to dust you shall return. (Gen 3:19)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, Ecc. 3:20 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכל הולך אל־מקום אחד הכל היה מן־העפר והכל שב אל־העפר</p>\n<p>Everything goes to the same place; everything is from the dust and everything returns to the dust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbinic literature significantly connects the land on Earth with the body of the individual; AFAIK, rabbinic literature does not equate the land on our planet with that of others. For example, in Mishneh Torah, Yesodei HaTorah 3:1, the Rambam explicitly refers to Mars as one of the nine spheres:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וגלגל חמישי שבו מאדים</p>\n<p>And the fifth sphere contains the planet Madim (Mars)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later (3:10), the Rambam distinguishes between these spheres and the forms of matter on Earth:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ברא האל למטה מגלגל הירח גולם אחד שאינו כגולם הגלגלים, וברא ארבע צורות\nלגולם זה ואינן כצורת הגלגלים ונקבע כל צורה וצורה במקצת גולם זה  ...\nוצורה רביעית צורת הארץ נתחברה במקצתו ונהיה משניהם גוף הארץ</p>\n<p>Below the sphere of the moon, <strong>God created a type of matter which\ndiffers from the matter of the spheres</strong>. He created four forms for this\nmatter, which differ from the forms of matter of the spheres. ... The\nfourth of these forms is the form of earth. When it became connected\nto a portion of this matter, from the two there came into being a body\nof earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this reasoning, Rambam makes a direct connection between the four elements found on our planet and the obligation of burial (4:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הואיל וכל הנפסד יפרד ליסודות אלו למה נאמר לאדם ואל עפר תשוב, לפי שרוב בנינו מן העפר</p>\n<p>Since every entity will decompose and separate into these four fundamental elements, why was Adam told: \"You will return to dust\" [implying that man alone] will return to dust? Because the major part of man's composition is from dust.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, <em>Adam</em> is derived from <em>adamah</em> (cf. Guide to the Perplexed, 1:14), as man is connected to the element of earth (an element he claims only exists on the planet Earth).</p>\n<p>Obviously, the inaccuracy of the Rambam's Aristotelian physics should be accounted for in any practical decision-making (CYLOR). Nevertheless, it appears that the Rambam would argue that one cannot be buried on the planet Mars.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>אִם־יִהְיֶ֥ה נִֽדַּחֲךָ֖ בִּקְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם מִשָּׁ֗ם יְקַבֶּצְךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ וּמִשָּׁ֖ם יִקָּחֶֽךָ׃</p>\n\n<p>Even if your outcasts are at the ends of the world, from there the LORD your God will gather you, from there He will fetch you. </p>\n\n<p>still applies\nalthough my answer may not directly answer your question.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Connection Between Purim and Yom Kippur\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard recently that the Arizal writes that Purim is a higher level holiday than Yom Kippur. In fact, Yom Kippur is Yom KiPurim, a day like Purim. What is the connection between the two? They seem like polar opposites</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/yalkutsh/mishli.html#A2320\">Medrash</a> records a machloket Tannaim about whether in the future all the moadim are batel except for Yom Kippur and Purim or all the moadim except for Purim. The Maharal writes in his <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31267&pgnum=4\">hakdama to Ohr Chadash</a>, his commentary on Megillat Esther, that on both days the Jewish people were/are opposed by a force that seeks their complete destruction - Yom Kippur siritually by the Accuser and Purim physically by Haman - and in the end they were/are saved. On Yom Kippur we therefore serve G-d as <em>sechel</em> (intellect) by annulling our physical selves via the 5 inuyim (self-afflictions); on Purim we serve G-d as <em>guf</em> (physical/body) by annulling our intellect via the Seudah/drinking (\"<em>ad d'lo yada...</em>\").  (It's also perhaps noteworthy that both days are preceded by a contrasting couterpart, erev Yom Kippur when we are commanded to eat in preparation for the fast and Taanit Esther when we fast; there are many other interesting parallels.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>My answer is that Purim starts with the Jews getting a Divine death sentence for giving up on Jerusalem and considering themselves like gentiles.  Then Purim ends with Mordechi second to the king and willing to sacrifice the temple.  \"All the talk about half the kingdom is code for anything but the temple\" and if that is not it's enough Esther the Jew it's married to the goy but now everyone lives happily ever after.  What is the difference is the  Jews were able to get Mercy from God in that being separated from the heathens was to much.   So too we hope that God will realize that we are sinning because it is to much.   In other words we should tell God that we v are in the exile because we are attracted to the fleshpots of the gentiles not that we are great tsaddikim who need to put on tefillin like habad in the exile or that we learn Torah instead of going into the army because we are lazy</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Mordechai correct in not bowing down?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Megillah explains that Mordechai's refusal to bow to Haman is what provoked Haman and nearly resulted in the death of many Jews worldwide. </p>\n\n<p>Halachically was Mordechai correct in not bowing down, if for arguments sake Haman did indeed have some sort of Avodah Zara if it could have major repercussions on world Jewry?</p>\n\n<p>To extend the question slightly may one prostrate oneself to an idol if refusing to do so means that many Jews will be killed? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The following answer was given by Ohr Sameach, \"Ask the Rabbi\". It gives three reasons as to why Mordechai did not bow. The third reason is an interesting take on the matter. It basically says that the king himself had exempted Mordechai from the command to bow. It explains why Haman had to come up with a totally different reason for killing the Jews. Had Mordechai actually disobeyed a command of the king, Haman could have had him seized and executed. he could also have used it as an excuse to claim that \"the Jews\" intended to rebel as shown by Mordechai's refusing to obey the king.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>PURIM – TO BOW OR NOT TO BOW</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>This is an intriguing question. Why did Mordechai refuse to bow down\n  to Haman arousing Haman’s anger and thereby endangering his people?</p>\n  \n  <p>The Sages explain that Haman intentionally hung an idol over his heart\n  in order to cause the prostrating Jews to bow in front of the idol\n  while bowing down to him and thus ensnare them in sin. Since idolatry\n  is one of the transgressions which one may not commit even under\n  threat of death, Mordechai refused to bow before Haman’s idol.\n  However, there is also a deeper reason for Mordechai’s refusal to bow\n  before Haman. Mordechai descended from Binyamin while Haman descended\n  from Amalek who came from Esav. Since Binyamin had not yet been born\n  at the time that Yaakov and his wives bowed in honor before Esav, he\n  was not tainted by submission to Esav. Therefore, Binyamin’s\n  descendants, such as Mordechai, do not bow before Esav’s, such as\n  Haman.</p>\n  \n  <p>This explanation is alluded to by the fact that the verse describing\n  Mordechai’s refusal to bow is in the future tense: Rather than saying\n  “He did not kneel or bow”, the verse actually states, “He will not\n  kneel or bow down”. This suggests that Mordechai’s refusal was part of\n  the larger metaphysical dynamic that Binyamin will not bow before\n  Esav.</p>\n  \n  <p>The use of the future tense in the verse suggests yet a third reason\n  why Mordechai would not bow before Haman. As opposed to the beginning\n  of the verse which says, “And all the king’s servants who were in the\n  king’s gate kneeled and bowed down to Haman, for thus did the king\n  command concerning him”, the verse concludes, “and Mordechai will not\n  kneel or bow down”. This suggests that the entire verse is discussing\n  the king’s decree, and while others were required to bow before Haman,\n  Mordechai was, according to the language of the decree, specifically\n  exempt by the king from bowing.</p>\n  \n  <p>This would explain why Haman didn’t actually slander Mordechai before\n  the king for contravening the decree: it did not apply to him. Rather,\n  he conjured up a different pretext for complaining against the Jews</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mordechai was a major figure for the Jews. His refusal to bow down took place in public. Let's presume that, as Rashi writes, he did not bow down to Haman because Haman wore/became an Avoda Zara.</p>\n\n<p>Both bowing to an idol and doing any sin in public (Chillul Hashem) are sins for which one must put oneself in danger rather than transgress.\nA Jew is forbidden to desecrate G-d's name in such a way regardless of the reprecussions involved. </p>\n\n<p>An interesting parallel case is brought in the Rambam. He writes that a group of Jews may not cause the death of one of their members even to save the entire group.  (This is different than the individual Jew sacrificing himself for the group, which is indeed permitted, even commendable). Certain acts can never be permitted regardless of the repercussions that may result.</p>\n\n\n",

He served as the Rabbi of Givat Shaul, Jerusalem in 1924. However, his ideas on Kabbalah were considered very un-orthodox and thus he was always considered a man of stature but also a fringe personality. Famously, he was an ardent socialist to the extent that in a meeting with Ben-Gurion the first Prime Minister of the State of Israel complained: “I wanted to talk about kabbalah, but the rabbi wanted to talk about socialism.” </p>\n\n<p>As is widely known his philosophy has been used to disseminate \"Kabbalah\" to the masses Jew and non Jew alike, and has been grossly misinterpreted in doing so. This has turned off many people from his writings and philosophy (assuming people even know of the origins of the Kabbala Centre)</p>\n\n<p>In summation, Rav Ashlag was a well respected albeit fringe personality in his day, the progenitor of a peripheral Kabbalistic philosophy and an avowed socialist. His legacy is complicated in the orthodox world, and thus I would not say he wasn't \"Kosher\" for he was greatly respected by the Rabbinic establishment of his time, but also I wouldnt say he was fully embraced in the mainstream of the Jewish world, and his works are approached with a small amount of trepidation mostly due to his self described students and legacy bearers have misused his teachings in grotesque ways. </p>\n\n<p>See more here: <a href=\"http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Ashlag\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Ashlag</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I have seen Rav Ashlag's commentary on the Zohar (The Sulam) in many varying shuls and yeshivot in Israel and I have never heard of anyone who thought to exclude his works from the Orthodox canon. Many yeshivot do not promote the study of kabbalah so perhaps they would not have a zohar at all.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Philip Berg the founder of the Kabbalah Centre, was a disciple of Rabbi Yehudah Brandwein, the primary disciple of Rav Ashlag. He has NOT been accepted by the Orthodox community. The Kabbalah Centre also published an edition of the Sulam which they gave away for free and therefore it made its way into unsuspecting Jewish institutions. As far as I know the edition is the same as the standard edition. You can see a picture of it at this link <a href=\"http://store.kabbalah.co.il/Product/%D7%A1%D7%98-%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%94%D7%96%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A8---%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A9-%D7%94%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D-%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kabbalah Centre Hebrew store</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My experience in mainstream Yeshivish circles is that if someone has heard of one commentary on the Zohar, it's the Sulam.

Normally, Rashi clarifies when there is a dispute in the pshat, even if he brings both options. Rashi doesn't list these as conflicting sources, as he does in other places. It reads as though he interprets these two midrashim as working in concert, not conflict.</p>\n<p>How was Hur killed on two separate, consecutive days?</p>\n<p>Alternately, are there other places where he brings explicitly conflicting midrashim but doesn't address them as conflicting?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In fact, there is no contradiction between Midrash Tanchuma and Vayikra Rabba. Both maintain that Chur died on the first day, rather than the second.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=2&perek=32&mefaresh=tanhuma\">Tanchuma siman 19</a> reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וירא העם כי בושש משה \n  בא שש שעות. \n  נתכנסו ארבעים אלף שעלו עם ישראל ושני חרטומי מצרים עימהם, ושמותם יונו\"ס ויומברו\"ס, שהיו עושין לפני פרעה כל אותם כשפים, כמו שכתוב: ויעשו גם הם חרטומי מצרים בלהטיהם (שמות ז יא). ונקהלו כולם על אהרן, שנאמר: ויקהל העם על אהרן ויאמר וגו', שמשה שוב אינו יורד כבר. ואותו היום יום ארבעים היה בשש שעות ביום. \n  אמרו להם אהרן וחור: עכשיו יורד מן ההר, לא השגיחו. </p>\n  \n  <p>ויש אומרים: \n  שעמד שטן והראה להם דמות מיטתו מן ההר, ממה שאמרו: כי זה משה האיש. \n  מיד עמד חור וגער בהם. עמדו עליו והרגוהו. \n  כשראה אהרן כך, נתיירא והתחיל מעסיקן בדברים. \n  והם אומרים לו: קום עשה לנו אלהים. \n  והכל גלוי לפני מי שאמר והיה העולם מה הם מבקשים. \n  אמר להם אהרן: פרקו נזמי הזהב אשר באזני נשיכם.\n  אמר אהרן להם דבר קשה, שהנשים מתעכבות בו, שהם ראו כל הנסים והגבורות שעשה הקדוש ברוך הוא במצרים ובים ובסיני.  </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is (using ellipses liberally for the first paragraph):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Pasuk 1) וירא העם כי בושש משה -- 'And the nation saw that Moshe was delayed' -- He came at the sixth hour... (still pasuk 1) וירא העם כי בושש משה -- and the nation gathered unto Aharon and said to him... Aharon and Chur said to them, now Moshe will descend from the mountain, and they didn't listen.</p>\n  \n  <p>And some say: that the Satan arose and showed them the image of his [Moshe's] bier from the mountain, from that which they said (still pasuk 1) כִּי זֶה משֶׁה הָאִישׁ. Immediately Chur arose and rebuked them. They arose against him and killed him. When Aharon saw this, he feared and began making them busy with busy work. And they said to to him (still pasuk 1) עֲשֵׂה לָנוּ אֱלֹהִים. And all was revealed before He who spoke and the world came into being what they were asking. Aharon said to them (pasuk 2): פָּרְקוּ נִזְמֵי הַזָּהָב אֲשֶׁר בְּאָזְנֵי נְשֵׁיכֶם. Aharon told them to perform something difficult, for the women would prevent them, for they saw all the miracles and mighty acts which Hashem had performed in Egypt, at the Sea, and at Sinai...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the killing of Chur is <strong>explicitly</strong> on that first day according to Midrash Tanchuma.</p>\n\n<p>It is true that, on the next day, in Siman 20, Midrash Tanchuma makes reference to the fact that Chur was killed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולא עגל בלבד עשו, אלא גלוי עריות ושפיכות דמים, שנאמר: וישב העם לאכול ושתו ויקומו לצחק. \n  ואין צחוק אלא גלוי עריות, שנאמר: בא אלי העבד העברי וגו' (ברא' לט יז). \n  שפיכות דמים, דכתיב: יקומו הנערים וישחקו (ש\"ב ב יד), ואין לך גדול מן חור שנהרג. </p>\n  \n  <p>And not only did they fashion the Golden Calf, but also engaged in licentiousness and bloodshed, for it is stated  וישב העם לאכול ושתו ויקומו לצחק. And צחוק only means licentiousness as is stated... [pasuk citation] Bloodshed as is stated... [pasuk citation] And you have no greater bloodshed than that of Chur who was killed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>You are right, in your question, that this ambiguous statement of Rashi, and even the ambiguous statement in Tanchuma 20, <strong>seems</strong> at first glance to be stating that Chur was killed right now, on the second day. After all, it is offered in explanation of צחוק, which happened on the second day.</p>\n\n<p>However, this midrash in Tanchuma 20 is not the primary place that the Midrash Tanchuma states that Chur was killed. That primary place was Tanchuma 19. The wording that Tanchuma 20 uses, ואין לך גדול מן חור שנהרג, implies a <em>fait accompli</em>. Not because it uses the past tense, or passive, because much of the other details are also written in past tense. Rather, because it refers to it as something already known. It is not coming to state that \"Chur was killed\". Rather, as a way of demonstrating the bloodshed part of צחוק, it notes that Chur's death, which the audience already knows, easily (אין לך גדול) fulfills that part of the definition.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps one could resolve this messiness and say that there was licentiousness in general and bloodshed in general, as proved by the pasuk citations about the meaning of צחוק. And as an added bonus, the author of Tancuhma threw in this bloodshed of Chur, which happened the previous day. Or perhaps one could say that the Midrash meant to apply צחוק to the entire incident, and thus extends it to the events of the previous day.</p>\n\n<p>Regardless, the author of Midrash Tanchuma assumes people will be reading in context, and so will not be misled into thinking that he was stating that Chur was killed on the second day. And <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?tdate=3%2F2%2F2015\">Rashi</a>, who knows the context as well, and is channeling Tanchuma, also did not intend to convey any contradiction.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I will suggest an original answer only because all the sfarim I checked don't address this. Some of the sfarim (see Nachlas Yaakiv for instance) did however raise the point why Rashi in passuk 6 found it necessary to bring an example of murder, whereas he did not bring an example of the giluy arayos.</p>\n\n<p>What I think Rashi means is that the general mood that the nation was involded in the previous night, was the same mood they awakened to involve themselves in again. That mood is called tzchok, which implies avoda zara, gilui arayos, and shfichas damim. </p>\n\n<p>When Rashi says in passuk 6 'here too they killed Chur', he doesn't mean they killed him that morning, rather they killed him the evening before as Rashi mentioned in the previous passuk. But now in the morning they woke to once again involve themselves in tzchok. So 'here too' means here, at this point in time, they not only transgressed with gilui arayos, but they killed Chur too.</p>\n\n<p>This answers as well why Rashi felt it necessary to mention the case of murder, being that we don't find them actually murdering anyone that morning, but his point is the mood was the same.</p>\n\n<p>The wording in the Tanchuma also implies that Chur was already dead at this point שפיחות דמים, דכתיב יקומו נא הנערים וישחקו, ואין לך גדול מן חור שנהרג. \nWe see a past tense being used.</p>\n\n\n",

Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For Jews specifically, this should be the number one thought. It is so important Daniel refused the king's meat, and the 3 young men refused to bow to the statue of Nebekenezzer.</p>\n\n<p>That's the first part of the foundation of my argument. When you place yourself under the authority of someone who serves another god, you are submitting to that authority. As potential evidence I give you Job. He was tested by the adversary. In that testing all he had was touched and destroyed. That included his children, his livestock, his home, and his servants.  His employees.</p>\n\n<p>When I worked for a Christian, he refused to work on Sunday because it was his holy day. By not working, I passively was honoring that day with him. This is an example I am using to make a point. If you work for a Catholic charity, you will be under the authority of an organization that practices Idolatry, claims the Jews have lost their place as the Children of God, have claimed they can change the word of God, the seasons of God and the Laws of God and hold up the Sunday command as proof of this.</p>\n\n<p>They have consistently been against your people in every single point since the exile. They were at Spain, they crowned the emperor of France, Constantine, and all who followed answered to Rome. Even now Rome sides with your enemies. Why would you want to work for someone who considered their Pope the Vicar of God, the only voice between Man and God? </p>\n\n<p>For now that's my answer. I hope it answers it. It is not good to serve anyone, unless you are willing to leave the moment they demand you bow to their god. and tyat means the moment they expect you to do what their god demands or expects. God is not God only one day a week, or only during prayers. He is God always. And if you need a reference for that, I have no way to help you understand better. Ask God.</p>\n\n\n",

There are many vegetarian curry pastes and other spice pastes that can be found that are both certified halal and vegetarian but don't have a kosher hechsher.</p>\n\n<p>Pastes are in sealed tin cans. They say they are processed in facilities that process nuts and sesame. There is no milk or dairy in them.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>It would depend both on what's in it and how it was processed. There are many ingredients that are Halal and/or vegetarian and are not kosher (e.g. non-kosher wine [which might also be vegan]; some produce from Israel; turtle eggs). Also cooking utensils/processing equipment would have to be kosher. That said, there are some products that don't require special kosher certification. See e.g. <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/cons-appr-no-need.htm\">http://www.star-k.org/cons-appr-no-need.htm</a> .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are several main problems with vegetarian/vegan products. </p>\n\n<p>1) The reliability of the vegan/halal certifying agency is questionable from a Halachik perspective. (That is, can they be trusted to check carefully? Can one rely on their word?)</p>\n\n<p>2) Jewish law is extremely strict on the prohibition of eating bugs, which are common in vegetable products. (Though this is less of a problem in a paste or puree where the bug cannot possibly be whole).</p>\n\n<p>3) The utensils used in the facility must also be Kosher (this is less of a problem in dairy and meat free facilities).</p>\n\n<p>4)Additives (color, flavor, stabilizers) may be not kosher. </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, many grape products are not kosher without certification due to the special prohibition of Yayin Nesech/Stam Yaynam.</p>\n\n<p><strong>All things considered, there is a decent chance that these pastes <em>are</em> Kosher.

This sufficed to help me understand most of the common Gemarah language.</p>\n\n<p>I am looking, now, more for a \"basic\" book in Aramaic that focuses more on the structure and grammar of the language and, perhaps, its comparison to Hebrew. I.e. - I am not looking for Jastrow or some book that cross refs. Talmudic terms. That's \"incidentally\" useful for me. I am looking for something that focuses more on the general structure of Aramit to help me understand how the word structure / grammar fits into the Gemarra by citing a few examples.</p>\n\n<p>Can someone recommend a good book that has this approach and explain some of its highlights. I'm not seeking a list, here. I just want to get a sense of what's available that will do the job.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I would recommend a few different texts. Chiefly, since you are looking for something basic and fundamental, I would encourage you to check out Yitzhak Frank, <em>Grammar for Gemara and Targum Onkelos</em> (Jerusalem, 2009). He goes into detail as regards the relationship of different Aramaic dialects to one another, their relationship with Hebrew (Biblical and Mishnaic) and presents a basic grammar of Talmudic language. For what you are looking for, this might be the best bet.</p>\n\n<p>If you wanted something a little bit less \"basic\", but somewhat more direct as regards the relationship between Aramaic and Hebrew, have a look at Sabatino Moscati (<em>et al</em>), <em>An Introduction to the Comparative Grammar of the Semitic Languages</em> (ed. S. Moscati; Wiesbaden, 1980), or Patrick R. Bennett, <em>Comparative Semitic Linguistics: A Manual</em> (Eisenbrauns, 1998), which is somewhat more basic than its title suggests.</p>\n\n<p>So too, if you decide that you want something that focuses a little more heavily on the grammar of the language and less on its relationship to Hebrew, I personally found very useful Alger F. Johns, <em>A Short Grammar of Biblical Aramaic</em> (Michigan, 1972) and Wm. B. Stevenson, <em>Grammar of Palestinian Jewish Aramaic</em> (Oxford, 1962) - although note that neither of these are for the gemara. The first will help with Daniel, Ezra and some targumim and the second with the Yerushalmi (and various other targumim), but unless you are going to delve into a lot of detail, I don't think you'll find either so different from the grammar of the Bavli that they will fail to be of assistance there either.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, and if only because nobody else ever mentions it in this context, you can never go wrong with a good grammar of Syriac. Although it will necessitate learning a different script (and depending on how readily you learn scripts, that may or may not be much of a setback), but the grammar is virtually indistinguishable from Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic. For my money, the best three grammars of Syriac are:</p>\n\n<p>Takamitsu Muraoka, <em>Classical Syriac: A Basic Grammar with a Chrestomathy</em> (Wiesbaden, 1997);</p>\n\n<p>Theodore H. Robinson, <em>Paradigms and Exercises in Syriac Grammar</em> (4th ed; Oxford, 1962);</p>\n\n<p>W.M. Thackston, <em>Introduction to Syriac</em> (Maryland, 1999).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>i recommend that instead of a book you listen to a 5 part lecture series from Web Yeshiva featuring Rabbi Dovid Fink who goes into the exact details you are looking for. The signup is free, and you can download the videos. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.webyeshiva.org/class.php?cid=1179\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.webyeshiva.org/class.php?cid=1179</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm not sure why you would say that Syriac is \"indistinguishable\" the Aramaic of Talmud Bavli. They are entirely different dialects of Aramaic! As far as dialects go, Mandean is closer to Jewish Babylonian Aramaic than Syriac, both in terms of geography and features. </p>\n\n<p>A good practical grammar of Talmudic Aramaic would be A manual of Babylonian Jewish Aramaic, by David Marcus. A more thorough and up-to-date grammar would be Elitzur A. Bar-Asher Siegal's Introduction to the Grammar of Jewish-Babylonian Aramaic.</p>\n\n\n",

Such Jews are easily 100% kosher, and in fact that was basically Rabbi Akiva's theology post-Beitar. (\"Bar Kochba could have been, but it didn't work out.\")</p>\n\n<p><strong>Category B.</strong> Those that believe that Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneurson isn't really dead, or that he gets a second coming to be the messiah, are wrong, and this belief is very dangerous as it can spin into all sorts of other problems. As such, the Rabbinical Council of America does not want members with such a belief. Some would argue that it's best to avoid associating one's self with people (or at least communities or institutions) who believe this. Rabbi Shach was concerned of this danger even while Rabbi Schneurson was alive, and called for people not to associate with such believers. <em>However</em>, such a belief is not so wrong as to void one's halachic status as a witness, or invalidate a Gett, meat, wine, or cheese.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Category C.</strong> Unfortunately, there are those who took the next step and blurred the line between Rabbi Schneurson and God. Such a belief (e.g. referring to the rebbe as \"above all space and time\", or \"he controls what happens in this world\"; or more simply, \"we're bowing to a picture of the rebbe because he totally nullified himself to God\") would render one's Gett, conversion, cheese, meat, and wine all not kosher. </p>\n\n<p>So this leaves us with the contemporary questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>What's the best way to approach Category B Lubavitchers?</p></li>\n<li><p>How many Lubavitchers are in Category C? And what category should I assume (or fear for) if I have incomplete information?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I believe you're confusing some of the rhetoric between those questions. </p>\n\n\n",

But on a very basic level he seems to say:</p>\n\n<p>Hashem used the Torah as a blue-print; reading the words and creating whatever he read.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>באור' כתיב בה בראשית ברא וכו' [את השמים] אסתכל בהאי מלה וברא את השמים. כתיב בה ויאמר אלהים יהי אור אסתכל בהאי מלה וברא את האור. וכן בכל מלה ומלה דכתיב בה באורייתא אסתכל קוב''ה ועביד ההוא מלה ‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I heard once somewhere that compared the Torah to a filmstrip (the old-fashioned type) and the world to the projected image. The world is the actualization of the miniature print described in the Torah.\nA similar comparison would be the Torah as DNA and the world as the cell - created from the instructions and an exact replication, though of different form and function.</p>\n\n\n",

It also brings sources for the importance of keeping these rules.</p>\n\n<p>Further, it follows the rav's rulings in his extensive work on the proper wordings in prayers. The wordings often resemble <em>nusach ashkenaz</em> (\"German\" – non-Chassidic – rite) more than <em>sfard</em> (common Chassidic rite).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the tradition of these <em>hakpados</em> was broken when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Yehoshua_Yerachmiel_Rabinowicz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the rav's son-in-law</a> took up the mantle of leadership after the rav's passing, only to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baruch_Yehoshua_Yerachmiel_Rabinowicz#Post-war\" rel=\"noreferrer\">radically depart</a> from his father-in-law's ways. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Leib_Rabinovich\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Today's Munkacser rebbe</a> is but a namesake, without proper <em>mesora</em> (tradition) from the <em>Minchas Elazar</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the memory of the  past lives on, e.g. in the preface to the official siddur.

The question we need to ask is why the number comes out exactly 502.  </p>\n\n<p>The answer comes from the story of Ruth.  We know that Ruth in gemetryia is 606 because she started off with 7 Noachide mitzvot, then added 606 when she converted.  In the same manner, since drinking on purim is  כְּנֶגֶד the full 613 mitzvot you'd think  בָּרוּךְ מָרְדָּכַי, etc. should be equal 613.  Instead, the gemetrya is only 502 -- we're missing 111.</p>\n\n<p>111 happens to be the gematryia of אנס, so when the megilla says והשתיה כדת <strong>אין אנס</strong>, it means that it <em>looked like</em> the drinking was leshem mitzvah, but in reality we were missing the key component that made it kodesh, and so that is why the chachamim didn't go to the mishteh.</p>\n\n<p>Still, the fact that the Jewish people refrained from having kiddush clubs for a fully 180 days was a serious problem, which is why Mordechai was metaken drinking on Purim ledorot.

Moshe himself may have used this name out of gratitude to\n  her.</p>\n  \n  <p>Another reason the Torah calls him Moshe is the significance of the\n  name itself.

Did Mordechai do something specific that set off Haman, now?</li>\n<li>There was already a decree in place to kill all the Jews, which included Mordechai (and Esther, if we assume that by that time someone would discover that she was Jewish). Why not wait until that date?</li>\n<li>If there had to be a special killing for Mordechai, why didn't Haman cast a special lot to decide when to do this?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2304&st=&pgnum=22&hilite=\">Sefer Ginzei Margoliyos</a> in his Ginzei Nistaros on Megilas Esther ponders this and explains as follows. Haman could not control himself until the time of killing all the Jews as he was incensed by Mordechai's refusal to stand up for him. Haman's plan was to get other's to hang Mordechai thus it will remain a secret that he was the one behind this plot. </p>\n\n<p>My own thoughts are that perhaps Haman feared that Mordechai will convince the Jews to pray and do Teshuva and thus the decree would be annulled. By planning on killing Mordechai, Haman was hopeful that the Jews would not come to repent. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The following is my own \"theory\" based loosely on, and mostly inspired by, some comments of the Vilna Gaon.</p>\n\n<p>Haman (and Achashverosh) did not know Esther's nationality, but did know that she was raised by Mordechai (the Vilna Gaon makes this point in several places throughout the Megillah. Commentary to 6:1 is one example).  Therefore, there was reason for Haman to assume that if he directly assaulted Mordechai, this would raise the ire of Esther and, in turn, the king.  Esther had already been made queen before Haman was raised to his position (Esther 3:1), so by the time Mordechai was refusing to bow down to him, Esther was already in her position of influence. Haman would have killed Mordechai immediately, sans any lots, but he was afraid of Esther's reaction.</p>\n\n<p>When Esther invited Haman to the party, Haman concluded that Esther felt more fondly towards him than she did towards Mordechai (Vilna Gaon commentary to 5:9).  When, upon his departure from the party he saw Mordechai and was reminded of his hatred for him, he no longer had any barriers preventing him from directly taking action against Mordechai, and went to arrange for his immediate hanging.</p>\n\n<p>I realize this does not fit well with the Vilna Gaon's commentary to Esther 3:6 (which is why I called it my theory inspired by the Vilna Gaon, and not what I think he would say), but, borrowing the explanation of the Malbim to Esther 3:4-6, it could be understood as follows: Haman understood Mordechai's failure to bow as an expression of Mordechai's personal hatred towards Haman (Malbim to 3:5), and even so he decided to destroy the Jews as a whole out of spite for a belief system which <em>could have</em> led to not bowing to him (Malbim to 3:6).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>it says  it was embarrassing  for people to see that hes so petty to want to kill a rival. Once it becomes a national issue,which is what he turned it into, your killing the jews \"with mordechai\", that does not look petty at all</p>\n\n\n",

Nowadays, we have <a href=\"http://www.wikipedia.org/Beis_Yaakov\" rel=\"nofollow\">plenty</a> of women reading from the Torah in public so it lost it's lack of Kavod Hatzibbur.</p>\n\n<p>So why can't women read from the Torah nowadays?</p>\n\n<p>It's a Shavua (kind of like the fact that even though the Cherem of Rabbeinu Gershon expired, the Jewish people accepted a Shevua not to marry multiple wives). This is such a powerful Shevua, since even Hashem kavyachol took part in it (like the Cherem that the brothers took not to reveal Yosef's sale, in which Hashem took part).</p>\n\n<p>On Erev Purim, we have a risk that feminists will demand us to undo this oath (in honor of Esther, who broke all Persian and Jewish protocol (kol kvuda bas melech pnima) to talk to Achashveirosh and Haman (both men) to save the Jews. </p>\n\n<p>To avoid giving in to them, we read Vayechal, which the Gemara explains in the 5th chapter of Brachos symbolizes Moshe Rabbeinu saying that Hashem annulling his oath is \"secular\" and sacrilegious.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, we're just sending a message to people in the Viber Shul - Don't count on it!!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Simple answer.</p>\n\n<p>The word חל means \"sick\".

This latter detail is crucial if you believe your wife will not support this plan, in which case you must hide them somewhere where she will be unable to find them. Halachically you will not owe them anything if they are over 6 years old. However, you will not be able to then take them right back home again since if you do this, they will be expecting the same behavior next year and will not be wondering where their next meal will come from, and then they will not be halachically an evyon next year.</p>\n\n<p>2) Get an eved knani and immediately release him, there will be no obligation of hanaka. The problem this would be considered illegal according to every constitution in the world, and so since dina demalchusa dina, the eved would not get a chance to be an evyon. Arguably this might work in a war-torn country such as Syria, since the constitution is worthless and there is effectively anarchy. However the only way for a Jew into Syria is to pretend to be an Islamic Jihadist and this would involve building a reputation for yourself. It definitely wouldn't work for this year.</p>\n\n<p>3) Convince your best friend to give you all his belongings. The use of force won't be necessary, since I'm sure your friend will understand the need. It's crucial that this not be a matana al menas lehachzir though, since the friend must be left uncertain where his next meal will be coming from. Therefore you should agree to flip a coin - if its heads, you give him his stuff back right away, and if it's tails, you withhold it from  him for a few days. Note: The matanos laevyonim must be given before the coin is flipped.</p>\n\n<p>Your dedication to this mitzvah is truly admirable :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I think it's pashut and inherently the answers lies in part of your question, about robbing him. as we know from the story of yakov and esav or as some might spell it esu that rashi teaches us that when yakov ran away and elifaz ran after him and took his money yakov became was at that point technically considered a dead man cause uni chasuv k'mess therefore it would seem only logical that a dead man is avaday chasuve k'uni therefore I think u should find the nearest cemetery dig up the greatest tzadiks grave that's in your vicinity and throw your matanos la'evyonim in to the grave the only issue that might arise would be that since the dead man now has money im not sure u can consider him a mess lechatchila I think that this question is what chazal would considure a teku and iyh next year in yerushalyim we will have the answer (ps if there is no local cemetery just get drunk and kill your best friend and you'll be patur as the famous gemarah teaches us so don't worry and have another drink purim sameach </p>\n\n\n",

If, in the dream, the\n  pomegranates are split open, if the dreamer is a scholar he may hope\n  to learn more Torah … while if he is unlearned, he can hope to perform\n  mitzvot ….” Drawing upon a verse in Shir HaShirim (4:3; 6:7), the\n  gemara concludes by stating that even “the empty ones among the Jews\n  are full of mitzvot like a pomegranate [is full of seeds].”5 Many\n  misread this gemara to mean that there are precisely 613 seeds in a\n  pomegranate, as there are 613 mitzvot. It should be clear, however,\n  that the gemara uses pomegranates to imply an abundance. In fact, the\n  very name “pomegranate” is derived from Latin’s “pomum” (apple) and\n  “granatus” (seeded), alluding to the fruit’s many seeds.\n  from: <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/09/2008/whats_the_truth_about_pomegranate_seeds/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.ou.org/jewish_action/09/2008/whats_the_truth_about_pomegranate_seeds/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Thus, is not associated with Gog uMagog but with Esau. Gog is associated with the grandson of Esau, amalek. The source is in Numbers 21:20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּרְא֙ אֶת־עֲמָלֵ֔ק וַיִּשָּׂ֥א מְשָׁל֖וֹ וַיֹּאמַ֑ר רֵאשִׁ֤ית גּוֹיִם֙ עֲמָלֵ֔ק וְאַחֲרִית֖וֹ עֲדֵ֥י אֹבֵֽד\n\"He saw Amalek and, taking up his theme, he said:\nA leading nation is Amalek;\nBut its fate is to perish forever.\" JPS1985\n(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.20?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.24.20?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I read the commentaries and there is kind of a small machloket if the phrase \"resheyit goyim amalek veacharito odei obed\" refers to that is the first in history of humankind or it is the one who leads the 69 remaining nations against Israel. In the previous translation of JPS1917 it is translated as \"first of the nations\". Overall the conclusion seems to be both, that is the first formal nation in humankind and also the leading of nations against Israel in the final war of Mashiach. The clearest explanation is seen in Pri Tzaddik Nasso 15:2, from where we understand that Numbers 24:20 and Ezekiel 38 is the leading nation of Amalek;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואחר כל זה יהיה עוד מלחמת גוג ומגוג על משיח בן יוסף כי גומ\"ג הוא מזרע עמלק\n\"...and after all of this still there will be the war of Gog uMagog upon Mashiach ben Yoseph, for Gog uMagog is from the seed of Amalek\"\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Tzadik%2C_Nasso.15.2?vhe=Pri_Tzaddik,_Lublin,_1901&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Tzadik%2C_Nasso.15.2?vhe=Pri_Tzaddik,_Lublin,_1901&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, right now I am doing a clip from rabbi Daniel Glatstein /shlita/ where he explains what Rav Kanievsky ZT'L said about Gog uMagog and the clipped part starts talking about Yavan being a /shor/, an ox. Esau is associated with an ox or bull, correct me if they are not the same animal, I think that are very similar, same class.

So there is something with these two, with Yavan, and with Magog. The first assimilates into Esau, and the latter into Esau's grandson amalek.</p>\n\n\n",

This indicates that he would say \"Ve'al\" because he would have added it to the Hoda'ah section in Shemoneh Esreh, which is a list: \"Ve'al nissecha shebechol yom imanu...Ve'al tovoteicha...\" and then \"...Ve'al hanissim ve'al hapurkan.\" <br>\nThe source in Brachot reads </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\".ברוך ה' יום יום- בכל יום תן לו מעין ברכות\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara is speaking of putting in some short summary of the day in our Shemoneh Esreh; which appears as a separate Bracha, Ya'aleh Ve'yavo.<br> People like the Rambam would hold that \"Al Hannisim\" <b> is </b> the summary of the day, and would put it as a separate Bracha to fulfill <i>Baruch Hashem Yom Yom.</i><br>\nYour question is one of the נפקא מינות of this debate.<br>\nRav Lichtenstein explained: Birchat Hamazon is the lengthy version of the Bracha Me'ein Shalosh.

However, on Shabbos and Yom Tov, we still add in a short summary of Ya'aleh Ve'yavo in the Bracha Me'ein Shalosh. On Chanukah and Purim we do not. The reason why is that \"Al Hanisim\" is a bracha of Hoda'ah, not of the Yom, and so is not placed in the Bracha Me'ein Shalosh, where there is no sentence about Hoda'ah.<br><br>\nHope this helps. א פרילייכן פורים everyone!</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Al_Hanissim_on_Chanukah#cite_note-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachapedia</a> has a nice write up on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Maharam Rutenberg (Teshuva 70) writes that Al Hanisim is a prayer of thanks and is therefore inserted in the appropriate Berachot in Shemoneh Esrei and Birkat Hamazon.

The minhag was only adopted for Birkat Hamazon and was not adopted for Al Hamichya.</p>\n<p>Rav Yosef Dov Soloveitchik (Igrot Hagrid <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.3.13?lang=he-en&utm_source=halachipedia.com&utm_medium=sefaria_linker\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 3:13</a> and Harerei Kedem vol. 1: pg. 302) explains that regarding Shabbat and Rosh Chodesh, the inherent kedusha of the day obligates us to mention them even in Me’ayn Shalosh. On the other hand, for Purim and Chanuka there is no inherent kedusha of the day (all types of melacha are allowed). We mention Al Hanissim simply as an expansion of the Beracha of Hodaa. Once we thank Hashem in Modim, it is fitting to mention the specific miracle of the day. The Beracha of me’ayn shalosh is a condensed version of birkat hamazon. The additions for Shabbat, Yom Tov, and Rosh Chodesh are independent portions of Birkat HaMazon and are therefore abridged and included in Me’ayn Shalosh. However, Al Hanissim is not an independent portion, and it is not the main idea of the Hodaah section.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim Soloveitchik (cited in Haggadah Shel Pesach MiBeit Levi pg. 233) suggests that the reason why Chanukah and Purim are not mentioned in the Me’ayn Shalosh is based on the concept of the compensatory beracha for Birkat Hamazon. The Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.49?lang=he-en&utm_source=halachipedia.com&utm_medium=sefaria_linker\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 49a-b</a>, provides a solution for one who omits Retzei or Yaaleh Veyavo from the Birkat HaMazon of Shabbat and Yom Tov. If one realizes the mistake after completing the third beracha of Uvnei Yerushalayim, but prior to reciting Hatov Vihameitiv, one can recite a compensatory beracha at that point, and there is no need to return to the beginning of Birkat HaMazon. This beracha is only available for the additions for Shabbat, Yom Tov and Rosh Chodesh. Me’ayn Shalosh is an abridged form of all of the berachot of Birkat HaMazon. Anything that is not a beracha is not included. Although the additions for Shabbat, Yom Tov and Rosh Chodesh don't normally appear as independent berachot, they have the potential to exist as independent berachot in the form of the compensatory beracha. Therefore, the additions for Shabbat, Yom Tov and Rosh Chodesh are abridged and included in Me’ayn Shalosh. The addition for Chanukah and Purim does not have a compensatory beracha and never exists as independent beracha. Therefore, it is not mentioned in Me’ayn Shalosh. [Based on this logic, Rav Chaim explains why the additions for Shabbat, Yom Tov and Rosh Chodesh in the Me’ayn Shalosh appear after Uvnei Yerushalayim and not before. The compensatory beracha is recited after Uvnei Yerushalayim. Therefore, one should view the me’ayn Shalosh as an abridged form of Birkat HaMazon when the compensatory beracha is recited and the logical placement for these additions is after Uvnei Yerushalayim.]</p>\n<p>See also Tzitz Eliezer 9:33 who cites a beautiful approach of the Minchat Ani. see also <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=455\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eli Mansour</a></p>\n<p>see article by <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2011/03/the-al-hamichya-inconsistency-ii/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ari Enkin</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Since the Ring’s inscription is only visible when it is heated, it would be preferable not to put the Ring in fire immediately before the ceremony.

In Kiddushin 41a, Rav Yehudah quotes this ruling from Rav: “אסור לאדם לקדש אשה עד שיראנה <em>A man is forbidden from betrothing a woman he cannot see.</em>” Since the One Ring produces invisibility, it may not be used for <em>kiddushin</em>.</p>\n\n<p>(See also the discussion at <em><a href=\"http://archiveofourown.org/works/3478202\" rel=\"noreferrer\">One Ring to Bind Them: A Halachic Inquiry on the Occasion of Purim 5775</a></em> where a different answer is offered.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It would seem that based on the כלל of כל העומד that you can't use it.

When Frodo declared that it was his on the Fiery Mountain, it is possible that he was קונה through שינוי רשות, bt at that point it is obviously כל הומד לשרוף כשרוף דמי, if he was קונה or not is a moot point.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This answer is inspired by my wife:</p>\n\n<p>It is essential that the ring for <em>kedushin</em> be the property of the <em>chasson</em> in order for it to effect a <em>kinyan</em>.

He says that it means that one year one would go to the other for the meal, and the next year they would reverse it.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>זה אוכל עם זה בפורים של שנה זו ובשניה סועד חברו עמו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yosef</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2821\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 695</a>) asks how they fulfilled their obligation of mishloach manos according to Rashi if only one of them was giving each year, and he does not have a good answer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורש\"י פירש מחלפי סעודתייהו זה אוכל עם זה בפורים של שנה זו ובשנייה סועד\n  חבירו עמו וקשה לי על דבריו דאם כן לא היו מקיימים משלוח מנות איש לרעהו\n  וא\"ת שהיו שולחים מנות איש לרעהו אם כן מאי אתא לאשמועינן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_de_Boton\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lechem Mishneh</a>, however, answers (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=91341&rid=2820\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Megilla 2:15</a>) that what Rashi meant is that one of them would give a meal to the other and fulfill mishloach manos, and then would join the recipient for the meal. Thus, the recipient gives back (as part of the meal) what he just received, and thereby also fulfills his obligation of mishloach manos. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ורש\"י ז\"ל פירש זה אוכל עם זה בפורים של שנה זו ובשניה סועד חבירו עמו\n  וקשה על דבריו דא\"כ לא היה מקיים מצות משלוח מנות אלא אחד מהם שהיה נותן\n  סעודתו לחבירו אבל חבירו לא היה מקיים וכן הקשה מהרי\"ק ז\"ל ול\"נ לתרץ\n  דהיו עושין כך זה היה נותן סעודתו לחבירו במתנה בשנה זו ואחר שהיה שלו אז\n  חבירו כשהיה נותן לו מאותה סעודה והיה סועד עמו נמצא שגם הוא נותן לו\n  כיון שכבר היתה קנויה לו במתנה והרי נתן מהנתון לו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus, the Lechem Mishneh explicitly states that (at least according to Rashi) one can give mishloach manos to someone from the very mishloach manos that that person just gave him. </p>\n\n<p>However, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_da_Silva\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peri Chadash</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3115\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 695:4</a>) gives a similar interpretation of Rashi, except that he says that only the first giver fulfills his obligation but the second guy does not. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכתב רש\"י ז\"ל מחלפי סעודתייהו זה אוכל עם זה בפורים של שנה זו ובשניה\n  סועד חבירו עמו ע\"כ והקשה בב\"י ז\"ל דאם כן לא היו מקיימים ומשלוח מנות\n  איש לרעהו ולי נראה שכונת רש\"י ז\"ל לאשמועינן שאותו ששולח הסעודה היה\n  מיפטר ממשלוח מנות אף על פי שהיה הולך ואוכל שם עם חבירו אבל חבירו ודאי\n  דלא מיפטר בהכי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This might indicate that \"recycled mishloach manos\" is not valid, but perhaps he means that inviting someone for your meal does not count as mishloach manos – you have to actually send the guy a gift of food.

In his explanation of Rashi he mentions that one might have thought that because the two fellows were planning on reversing the meal invitation the next year it would not count as mishloach manos because it looks like lending/borrowing rather than giving. He goes on to note that if they made this arrangement within the same year then it would actually be real lending/borrowing:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_HaLevi_Segal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Turei Zahav</a> (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x3076\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O.C. 695:5</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בגמ' אמרי' אביי בר אבין ור\"ח בר אבין מחלפי סעודתייהו להדדי ופי' הר\"ן\n  לא היה א' מהם כדי לשלוח ולהשאיר לעצמו ולפיכך כל אחד שולחים סעודתן זה\n  לזה כדי לאכול סעודת פורים ולקיי' מצות משלוח מנו' ודרך זה כתוב כאן\n  ורש\"י פי' מחליפין סעודתייהו זה אוכל עם זה בפורים של שנה זו ובשני סועד\n  חבירו עמו והקשה ב\"י לפירש\"י דא\"כ לא היה מקיימים משלוח מנות איש לרעהו\n  וא\"ת שהיו שולחין מנות איש לרעהו א\"כ מאי קמ\"ל עכ\"ל ונלע\"ד לרש\"י הוה\n  רבותא בזה שהיו אומרים בפי' שזה יאכל עם זה ואח\"כ להיפוך וה\"א דהוה כמו\n  הלואה ואין כאן מנות דהוא מתנ' דוקא קמ\"ל דאפ\"ה היו יוצאים דהיינו שבשנה\n  זו יצא זה שמזמין לחבירו וחבירו היה שולח לאיש אחר ולשנה שניה היה להיפוך\n  אלא שיש לדקדק למה לא פירש\"י באמת הכל על שנה א' ושניהם יצאו ואפשר לו'\n  דבזה הוה באמת הלואה גמורה כיון שנראה לכל שתיכף מקבל תשלומין והיה תנאי\n  ביניהם משא\"כ אם היו בשני שנים לא היה נראה כמו תשלומין בשנ' זו ולא בזו\n  ודוגמ' לזה מצינו בסי' ק\"ע סי\"ג בהג\"ה לא יאמר אדם לחבירו בא ואכול עמי\n  מה שהאכלתני דהו' כפורע לו חובו ונרא' כאלו הלו' לו ויש לחוש שיאכילהו\n  יותר ואית ביה משום ריבית אבל מותר לומר לו בוא ואכול עמי ואאכול עמך פעם\n  אחרת ומותר לאכול עמו אפי' סעודה יותר גדולה עכ\"ל הרי דבשעת אכילה השניה\n  אסור להזכיר שהוא תשלומין ה\"נ כן דאז הוה הלואה כנלע\"ד נכון</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>In Sum:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Lechem Mishneh appears to explicitly allow \"recycled mishloach manos\", and while the Peri Chadash disagrees in that specific case it is likely for a different reason.

I understand that this has become a popular activity in many communities. The shul gets a percentage of the fund collected, and it saves people the effort of packing packages, themselves.</p>\n\n<p>Is such \"pooled\" mishlo'ach manot acceptable, in light of the verse mentioned above. Also, it seems that the shul is the one delivering the mishlo'ach manot, not the people themselves.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edited</strong> based on \"repetitive comments:</p>\n\n<p>1 - My shul gave these baskets out at night, to SOME people, i.e. - those that showed up last night and, partially, b/c they knew there would be snow on Purim so it would be harder to get it to them. I'm aware that doesn't fulfill the mitzvah. For the answer, ignore this aspect. I just mentioned that fact incidentally.</p>\n\n<p>2 - Several Orthodox shuls in my neighborhood are doing this seemingly with the intent that this shoul dbe \"acceptable\" mishloach manot, and many of them deliver it during the day time like postmen - neither rain nor snow... (and boy, is it snowing, now!) So, is the shul fulfilling the mitzvah o rno one is fulfilling the mitzvah this way?</p>\n\n<p>3- Some of the comments, so far, seem like they would be better as answers.

A person can become a agent for multiple people. As long as the basket of goodies has enough items in it so that each person who has appointed the person delivering the shalach manos would be yotzei with his part, then the agent has fulfilled his shlichus. In fact, if a number of people give the agent the appropriate food items, then they all fulfill the mitzvah, even if the shaliach delivers them all at once.</p>\n\n<p>This is what is done by the organizational deliveries. Consider chayalelchayal which delivers shalach manos to Israeli soldiers on Purim. Each delivery would be like that.</p>\n\n<p>The organizations and shuls that I have dealt with have always increased the amount being sent with the number of people being signed up for each person receiving. Many also send specific packages which are specified in the sign up so that the mitzvah is fulfilled.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, when sending via a shul or other organization, it is always a good idea to doublecheck that this has been done.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who should one credit? A question on the Bartenura\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question might be larger than just on the Bartenura, but it was a passage in his commentary on the Mishna that inspired it:</p>\n\n<p>In Menachot 8:7, the mishna states that the Temple treasurer would watch the pouring of wine for libations in order to check that there was neither froth nor sediment in it, and that he would strike with his stick (perhaps against the side of the barrel) once it was time to stop pouring. The Bartenura comments on this, suggesting that the reason that he used a stick rather than his voice is that speech is harmful to wine (לפי שהדבור קשה ליין).</p>\n\n<p>He credits this idea to his teachers (...ורבותי פירשו), but also acknowledges that it's found in the gemara (והכי מפרש בגמרא...). In fact, it appears in the gemara almost exactly as the Bartenura transcribed it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי יוחנן כשם שהדיבור יפה לבשמים כך דיבור רע ליין</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Yohanan said: Just as speech is good for [the grinding of]\n  herbs, so is speech harmful to [the pouring of] wine.</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Menachot 87a (≈ Keritot 6b)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>My question is</strong>: if the gemara provides this explanation explicitly, why did the Bartenura credit it to his teachers? And if the point was merely to show honour to his own rabbonim, why would one <em>ever</em> credit something to the gemara if they heard it from their teacher first?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It appears that he learned it from his teachers at the time he was learning mishnayos. Only later did he learn it from the gemara itself. Thus he credited the ones who taught him (and may have referenced the gemara). We see in the gemara that at times it credits Rav A and then quotes him as saying that he heard it from Rav B. We first give the credit to the one that we learned it from.</p>\n\n<p>One should say who one heard it from first, and then give the ultimate source so that others can see where it came from.</p>\n\n<p>I have given answers that my Rav gave an answer and cited a particular source when he did so.</p>\n\n\n",

Someone comes to Elisha the prophet, who was sitting with 100 prophets. The person brings 20 loaves of barley bread and some parched grain. Elisha says \"feed this to the people\". Elisha's servant mocks him and asks, \"What? This is enough to feed all 100 people??\"</p>\n\n<p>Whereby Elisha says that G-d said that not only would it be enough, but there would be left-over.

The later Massoretes, unable to decide which was right, directed that <em>both</em> accents should be chanted (הקורא יטעים הגרש קדם התלישא), Geresh first, as being the more common.

He says that the two different trop indicate that they went in part of the way, then used spears to pull them out, as the Midrash says.</p>\n\n<p>The Artscroll Baal Haturim gives a nice explanation in the footnotes.  They say that because the gershayim and the telisha gedola are both (small) pauses, it indicates that they were supposed to stop in the middle of their action, like we have an extra pause in the middle of the word.</p>\n\n<p>I've had a few thoughts extending this:</p>\n\n<p>The siman given in the Mesorah is כי תכלה לעשר, which also has a gershayim before a telisha (on two different words).  This is meant to help you remember how to read it, the gershayim goes first.  In the case of the double trop on one word, this is backwards with respect to the way it's written; in the case of כי תכלה לעשר, it's backwards with respect to the normal order, since usually telisha comes before gershayim.  I think this could be taken to mean that in these cases, we should stop and look backwards, and do something different.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>In the one in Melachim, this is obvious - that's basically the definition of teshuva</li>\n<li>In כי תכלה לעשר, which the Mesorah gives as the basis - let's say you didn't fulfill all the qualifications outlined in the viduy, and this time around you're ineligible for it.  But there's always next time, in 3 years.  כי תכלה, when you finish separating, stop, and לעשר again.  (Yes I know this grammatically doesn't make sense, it's a drash.)</li>\n<li>When Noach was born - don't just be happy that you're now able to work the earth, do better this time and don't cause it to be cursed again.  (Didn't work out that way, but it should have.)</li>\n<li>In the case of Mishael and Eltzafan, as the Baal Haturim says - stop, remember what caused Nadav and Avihu to die, and don't go in yourself.  Use spears.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For the other two it's not hard to identify some change, but I'm not familiar with these pesukim in depth to understand why this is such a big deal to deserve one of the 5 instances of this trop.  They deserve further development.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yechezkel - this is a change from the original cities of the Kohanim.</li>\n<li>Tzefanya - a complete change in Nineveh for the worse this time, they did teshuva in the time of Yonah, but now they became bad again.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

I haven't seen this as an actual <em>issur</em> - prohibition per se. However, there are many paragraphs in Pirkei Avot that in some way, mention that one should not do this. The two most notable that I can think of:</p>\n\n<p>וְאַל תְּהִי רָשָׁע בִּפְנֵי עַצְמָךְ - Avot 2:13</p>\n\n<p>Do not be a wicked person in your own eyes.</p>\n\n<p>אל תהי בז לכל אדם - Avot 4:3</p>\n\n<p>Do not disparage <strong>anyone</strong> (i.e. - including yourself. It does not say \"anyone <strong>else</strong>\")</p>\n\n<p>An <em>apikoros</em>, as you know, does not receive commendations in the Talmud, or anywhere, in general, in Judaism. Self-evaluation is valuable if it is used to improve oneself. But, generally, a person should not publicize his own character faults other than for useful positive purposes. For example, if he had a flaw in the past that he has improved, it is very useful to teach others who have currently a similar flaw, his example of how he improved himself so that they learn to emulate how he improved.</p>\n\n\n",

Most people who I've spoken to have told me that it smells terrible, or at least the smell is not pleasant in and of itself. (This is also the conclusion of \n<a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/157912951X\">this author</a>\n, and one <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/690226\">paper for the journal of clinical psychology</a> assumes that it's reasonably close to the smell of burning hair, which is terrible). Therefore, smelling marijuana would not warrant a bracha whatsoever (see Aruch Hashulchan O.C. 216:4).</p>\n\n<p>While it's true that any pleasant smelling thing can be used for besamim, it must be something pleasant smelling, and must require a bracha (see Shulchan Aruch O.C. 491:1).

(See, for instance, the commentary in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50042&st=&pgnum=170\" rel=\"nofollow\">this Haggada</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>\"Sabba, why do we eat this thing called <em>Pesach</em>?\" \"Well, it's because God skipped (<em>Pasach</em>) over our houses when he killed the firstborns back when we were in Egypt. Have I told you that story? A long time ago...\"</p>\n\n<p>\"Sabba, why do we eat this thing called <em>Matza</em>?\" \"Well, it's because we had to bake flat-bread (<em>Uggot Matzot</em>) when we were fleeing slavery in Egypt. Have I told you that story? A long time ago...\"</p>\n\n<p>So too in your case:</p>\n\n<p>\"Sabba, why do we eat this thing called <em>Maror</em>?\" \"Well, it's because the Egyptians embittered (<em>Mareru</em>) our lives back when we were enslaved in Egypt. Have I told you that story? A long time ago...\"</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>What follows are my own thoughts:</p>\n\n<p>The verses cited as proof-texts are not found in the Mishna or in the Yerushalmi, and in our printings of the Bavli they are in brackets. The stated reason for the name Matza is just שנגאלו that we were redeemed. Perhaps the original answer of \"_Matza Al Shem Mah?\" was something like this:</p>\n\n<p>\"Sabba, why do we eat this thing called <em>Matza</em>?\" \"Well, it's because God took us out (<em>Motzi</em>) of our slavery in Egypt. Have I told you that story? A long time ago...\"</p>\n\n<p>Isn't Sabba punny? :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I am not sure I would agree with the premise of the question, that the reason to mention these (two of) three things because (for Pesach) the Torah says the Lord will see the blood and not smite and because (for Matza) that it is evidence.</p>\n\n<p>Rather, the most immediate cause of Rabban Gamliel's opinion is the word Zeh, within the command to relate the story of the Exodus. Shemot 13:8 reads: וְהִגַּדְתָּ לְבִנְךָ בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא לֵאמֹר: בַּעֲבוּר זֶה עָשָׂה ה' לִי בְּצֵאתִי מִמִּצְרָיִם. \"And you shall relate to your son on that day saying: Because of Zeh (this) Hashem did for me when I left Egypt.</p>\n\n<p>Zeh is taken, midrashically, to something you can point to. For instance, the word Zeh by the construction of the Menorah is the spark for the midrash that Moshe did not understand its complex construction until Hashem showed him a Menorah made of flame. The same for the half-shekel, where the word Zeh is a spark for saying that Hashem showed him the coin out of fire.</p>\n\n<p>בַּעֲבוּר זֶה teaches us that the mitzvah of sippur yetziat mitzrayim is only at the time when the (Pesach) Matzah and Maror are resting before him. That is, he is supposed to be able to point to these symbols and say \"because of this\", indicating these physical items.</p>\n\n<p>Once these items are meant to be pointed out, as an essential part of the commandment (such that \"whoever does not say these three things has not fulfilled his obligation\"), we may then search for the significance. And perhaps the mentioning of the significance is also essential to the mitzvah, as the \"baavur\" (because of) of \"baavur Zeh\". Then we find elaboration of the significance of the three.</p>\n\n<p>Further, the connection is not just linguistic, in the sense of a pun. It is called maror because it is indeed bitter. And so it represents bitterness, just as the Egyptians in a non-taste fashion embittered the lives of the Hebrews.</p>\n\n\n",

She said: This man should be banned because he transgresses the prohibition of placing a stumbling block before the blind. For indeed we are taught in a Beraisa: You shall not place a stumbling block before the blind, this verse refers to a man who hits his mature son.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, if a parent hits their child they are creating the potential for the child to strike back, which will result in that child violating an issur D'oraisa. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.17a.13?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Moed_Katan.17a.13.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there notes that although the child may rebel and sin, the responsibility lies with the parent. Ultimately, if the parent were to exercise more control, the child will not learn the art of retaliation and will gain greater respect for their parent.

He notes that when the Gemara refers to a \"בנו גדול\" it is not necessarily a גדול, if a young child is of the disposition to respond in a similar fashion, then the issur extends to him as well. The only reason why the Gemara uses the term \"gadol\" there, is because it is more likely to happen with an older son.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראי' דברים דלא גדול גדול ממש אלא הכל לפי טבעו שיש לחוש שיתרם כנגדו בדבור או במעשיו כי אפי' לא יהא בר מצוה אין ראוי להביאו לידי מכה או מקלל אביו שלא ישתדלנו בדברים ומשום דאורחא דמילתא דבגדול שכיח כי הוא נקט גדול</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Parenthetically, Rav Shlomo Wolbe zt\"l adds (see ספר זריעה ובנין בחינוך, 'ענישה', עמוד כה) that in this present day, if one even hits a three-year-old, the likelihood is that they will hit you back!)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does sesame oil differ from grapeseed oil?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/15249/how-do-we-operationally-define-kitniyos\">related M.Y. question</a> regarding the definition of kitniyot. However, the answers there don't seem to provide a certain definition on how seed extracts are treated. Within the past 10-20 years, it seems that nearly all seeds have been included as <em>kitniyot</em>, though they are not considered legumes or in the \"grain-like\" category such as rice.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen cottonseed and grapeseed oil used by almost everyone on Pesach, despite the fact that these are from seeds. Sesames are considered seeds and banned. But, if the other two oils mentioned above are from seeds, I would infer that sesame oil should be permitted. I haven't seen Kosher L'Pesach sesame oil, which leads me to surmise that for some reason, maybe this is kitniyot as well. If it is, why is this different from cottonseed or grapeseed oil?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Logically, you've got to consider the reasons things are considered kitniyos: the item is used to make some kind of flour, the item is grown among chometz species, the item was historically confused with chometz in storage or preparation -- and sometimes, there's just a longstanding minhag that the item is kitniyos. </p>\n\n<p>Sesame is considered kitniyos by every Ashkenazi I know and clearly appears as kitniyos in  Beis Yosef Orach Chayim and the Rema 453. I'm assuming it's because of one of the reasons above.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we know grapes are a necessity for the mitzvos of Pesach, and there is certainly no minhag forbidding the consumption of grape products on Passover. Moreover, you would never confuse grapes with a grain or legume, and you wouldn't store them together in a sack -- the moisture from the grapes would rot the chometz.   </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer Melamed \"peninei Halakha:Pesach\n6.  Kitniyot That Never Touched Water and Kitniyot Oils</p>\n\n<p>We are not stricter with kitniyot than we are with the five cereal grains, so whatever is acceptable regarding these grains is kosher for kitniyot, too. Thus, kitniyot that have not come into contact with water, or that have come into contact with water but were not left for more than 18 minutes before being cooked (like matza), may be eaten. Some poskim are stringent in this respect, but most are lenient.[4]</p>\n\n<p>The poskim disagree about oils and whiskeys made from kitniyot. Those who rule leniently contend that the kitniyot prohibition does not apply to oil extracted from them, while those who rule stringently maintain that kitniyot oil has the same status as the kitniyot themselves. There is a middle position that asserts that if the kitniyot had been rinsed in water (for example, as part of the malting process) they become forbidden, and the oil extracted from them is prohibited. However, if they are ground and made into oil without having been moistened, they do not have the status of kitniyot.[5]</p>\n\n<p>Soybean, cottonseed, and canola (rapeseed) oils are not included in the prohibition. Many are stringent about soybean and canola oils, but whoever wishes to be lenient may be so. The widespread custom regarding cottonseed oil is to be lenient.[6]</p>\n\n<p>Lecithin extracted from rapeseed and added to chocolate is not included in the kitniyot prohibition, though some are stringent.[7]</p>\n\n<p>Chocolate and candy labeled “Kosher for Pesaĥ only for those who eat kitniyot” are technically permissible even for those who do not eat kitniyot, because the kitniyot in these products are added before Pesaĥ and are batel be-rov. In addition, these products generally contain kitniyot oils, which, according to several leading poskim, are not included in the custom to prohibit kitniyot. In practice, however, many people are stringent in this respect, and kosher certification agencies therefore label them as kosher for Pesaĥ only for those who eat kitniyot.[8]</p>\n\n<p>[4]. Most authorities are not stricter about kitniyot than about the cereal grains (SAH 453:5; Ĥayei Adam 127:1; Responsa Maharsham 1:183; Be’er Yitzĥak §11; Responsa Marĥeshet §3; and Rav Kook’s Oraĥ Mishpat §111). Some, however, are more stringent (Sho’el U-meishiv 1:1:175 and Ma’amar Mordechai §32). Their rationale is that no one would understand these distinctions since kitniyot do not become ĥametz. Additionally, they were concerned that making the kitniyot exactly like the cereal grains would mislead people to think they could use kitniyot to fulfill the mitzva of matza. As noted, though, most poskim are lenient, and in any dispute about a custom the halakha follows the lenient opinion.\nThe Rishonim also debate whether or not scalding works for kitniyot, since scalding any of the five cereal grains technically eliminates the possibility of its leavening, though the Ge’onim agree that no one knows how to scald the grains properly (SA 454:3). However, according to Or Zaru’a 2:256, since the prohibition of kitniyot is just a custom, scalding the kitniyot is effective and permits them. Mordechai rules stringently, and Rabbeinu Peretz’s glosses to Smak §222 notes the lenient opinion but rules stringently.\n[5]. Terumat Ha-deshen §113 explains that oil extracted from kitniyot is prohibited because the kitniyot are first malted. This is also the opinion of Rema 453:1. The implication of Terumat Ha-deshen is that if the kitniyot were not malted, their oil would be permitted. R. Yitzĥak Elĥanan Spektor in Responsa Be’er Yitzĥak §11 rules even more leniently, explaining that if the kitniyot were checked to ensure that no grain seeds were mixed in, the oil extracted from them is permitted, since the act of checking proves that the person is familiar with the prohibition. Similarly, Responsa Emek Halakha §134 permits whiskey distilled from kitniyot, as the prohibition applies to kitniyot themselves, not the liquid extracted from them.Conversely, other Aĥaronim maintain that oil extracted from kitniyot is prohibited even when the kitniyot are not malted (Nishmat Adam §33 and Avnei Nezer OĤ  §373). However, Terumat Ha-deshen and Rema imply that such oil is permissible. This raises an apparent difficulty, since the oil will eventually be mixed with water, a process that would be forbidden to apply to grain. Thus, according to these authorities, the custom is to prohibit kitniyot in their seed and flour state, but not in their oil state. One need not be concerned that grain kernels got mixed in with the kitniyot, which would turn to ĥametz when the extracted oil is mixed with water, since any oil extracted from the grain is batel be-shishim and is not ĥozer ve-ne’or on Pesaĥ (SA 447:4). Additionally, it appears that even liquid that is exuded by grain does not become ĥametz, as explained in Oraĥ Mishpat §§111-112 and Responsa Marĥeshet §3. Tzemaĥ Tzedek permits this for poor people, provided that the kitniyot did not come into contact with water while in seed form.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Kook has a well-known ruling (Oraĥ Mishpat 108-114) in which he broadly permitted sesame oil since not only are the seeds not malted, but the oil is also fried, which would prevent cereal grain from becoming ĥametz and is certainly enough to alleviate the problem of kitniyot. This idea is echoed by Avnei Nezer OĤ  §533 with regard to rapeseed oil (this responsum appeared in 5458, 11 years before Rav Kook’s responsum). The Hasidic-Ashkenazic rabbinical court in Jerusalem vociferously opposed Rav Kook without any regard for the honor of Torah or of all of the poskim who had previously ruled even more leniently than Rav Kook on this matter. Rav Kook responded to them sharply, with erudition, and with strong proofs. As part of his response, he wrote (p. 123): “In truth, the path of my righteous and ingenious mentors, may their merit protect us and all of Israel, whom I merited to serve, was not to incline toward stringency when it was possible to be lenient, especially regarding issues without a strong basis in the words of the talmudic Sages. It is sufficient that we do not budge, God forbid, from the customs we accepted at the guidance of our rabbis, the poskim. But as for the details that can be argued one way or the other, certainly one who inclines toward a lenient ruling in an effort to be wise and benevolent is praiseworthy, as long as his words are based on the profundity of halakha and sound reasoning…” Furthermore, one who adds prohibitions to a prohibition that is not rooted in the law may violate a prohibition implied by a positive commandment (“lav ha-ba mi-khlal aseh”) according to Rashi’s comments in the first chapter of Beitza. As Rav Kook wrote (p. 126): “That which the Talmud often states, that we do not make decrees on top of other decrees, is derived from the following verse: ‘You shall safeguard my observances’ [‘u-shmartem et mishmarti’ – Vayikra 18:30]: make safeguards, i.e., enact decrees, for my observances, that is, for the Torah. But do not make safeguards for safeguards; do not make decrees upon decrees.” Against the claim that we must be increasingly stringent nowadays, Rav Kook writes: “I know the character of our contemporaries well: it is precisely when they see that everything that can be permitted based on the profundity of halakha is permitted, they will understand that when we do not permit it is based on the truth of Torah law. Consequently, many people will adhere to the Torah and heed the words of the Sages, God willing. On the other hand, when they discover that there are things that can be permitted according to the letter of the law, but the rabbis were not sensitive to the travails and hardships of the Jewish people and leave these matters in their prohibited state, it will cause a terrible desecration of God’s name, Heaven forbid. Ultimately, there will be an increase of outbursts saying about core elements of the Torah that if the rabbis want to permit it, they can; thus, the law will be perverted” (p. 126).</p>\n\n<p>[6]. Soybean oil is produced without moistening the soybeans, so according to Rav Kook and most poskim it is not forbidden. Furthermore, it is questionable whether soybeans were even included in the prohibition of kitniyot, since they did not arrive in Europe until about 100 years ago. Igrot Moshe OĤ  3:63 writes that only what has customarily been accepted as prohibited is included in the custom. This is also the opinion of R. Dov Lior, the rabbi and head of the rabbinical court in Kiryat Arba.Regarding cottonseed oil, Mikra’ei Kodesh 2:60 is lenient, citing a ruling attributed to R. Ĥayim Soloveitchik of Brisk. Sidur Pesaĥ Ke-hilkhato (16:4) rules leniently in the name of R. Moshe Feinstein. However, Minĥat Ĥinukh 3:138 is stringent.</p>\n\n<p>Peanut Oil: We learned in section 4 above that in Greater Lithuania the custom was to eat peanuts, as per Igrot Moshe OĤ  3:63, since only items that are known not to have been eaten because of kitniyot are prohibited. Peanuts, which were discovered later on, were not included in the original prohibition. On the other hand, Mikra’ei Kodesh 2:60 and Ĥelkat Yaakov §97 prohibit peanuts but permit peanut oil. This is also the opinion of Melamed Le-ho’il OĤ  §88. Seridei Esh 2:37 also echoes this idea, and quotes that Avnei Nezer OĤ  §383 prohibited peanut oil, as did Minĥat Elazar. Practically, if one is unaware of a family custom to be stringent, he may be lenient, since this is an unclear custom.</p>\n\n<p>[7]. The Badatz is strict about lecithin derived from rapeseed. Halakhically there is nothing wrong with this substance; however, there are many uncertainties that mitigate toward leniency. Firstly, rapeseed is not a legume (the technical meaning of kitniyot), but a member of the Brassicaceae family of crucifers, whose fruit grips the stalk and whose seeds grow in pods, much like the mustard plant. Oil is extracted from these seeds. According to Igrot Moshe OĤ  3:63, we do not forbid anything that was not explicitly prohibited by custom. Additionally, it is debatable whether the status of kitniyot can be applied to the seeds of a plant when it is clear that the plant itself is not kitniyot. However, according to Avnei Nezer OĤ  §373, rapeseed oil is considered kitniyot, just like mustard (although even according to Avnei Nezer, if one boiled the seeds they would be permissible, as explained in §533). Moreover, we already saw that there are opinions that permit oil produced from any type of kitniyot. According to Maharsham 1:183, rapeseed oil is kosher for Pesaĥ since the oil is extracted without malting the seeds, and we have seen that most poskim are lenient in these situations, akin to the case of sesame oil. Finally, the oil is batel be-rov before Pesaĥ. According to Be’er Yitzĥak, any oil that was added to a mixture before Pesaĥ is batel. Ultimately, when there are so many uncertainties regarding a custom, we rule leniently. This is the ruling of R. Mordechai Eliyahu, as cited in Responsa Ama Devar 1:62.</p>\n\n<p>[8]. According to Rema 453:1 and MB 9 ad loc., even if kitniyot were mixed in on Pesaĥ, they are batel be-rov, although clearly one may not do so le-khatĥila. In this case, the mixing took place before Pesaĥ, and not for the purpose of nullifying the prohibited ingredients in the majority of permissible ingredients, since they may be eaten according to Sephardic custom. Therefore, since they were batel be-rov before Pesaĥ, the mixture may be eaten on Pesaĥ. Additionally, R. Yitzĥak Elĥanan Spektor writes in Be’er Yitzĥak §11 (quoted in n. 4 above) that the prohibition of kitniyot does not apply to kitniyot oil that was checked before Pesaĥ. This is the opinion of R. Lior and R. Rabinovitch.</p>\n\n<p>R. Lior also rules that string beans and fava beans in their pods are kosher for Pesaĥ, since in this state they are considered vegetables and not kitniyot. They were never included in the original prohibition since all of the concerns that were mentioned as the reason for the custom of kitniyot never applied to them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does \"getting a heter\" work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard of the concept of \"getting a heter\" to do something that is not ordinarily permitted, but I don't have a good idea of what it means. I am interested in explanations of what this process entails, particularly when the question is big enough that one needs to get a heter \"officially.\"</p>\n\n<p>I would appreciate answers that address some or all of the following: </p>\n\n<p>If someone needs a heter to do something (either something for which heterim are understood as readily available, like using birth control after having two children; shortening the niddah period in order to conceive; or going without hair covering [women] after divorce--or something personal and more unusual), how does one \"officially\" get a heter to do so? </p>\n\n<p>--Is it simply a matter of getting the go-ahead from anyone with semikha--or must the approval be from the  \"official\" rabbi of one's community? Or must it, moreover, be from an expert in that area of halacha? A rov? A member of a vaad or beis din?... Or, if I find the loophole myself, and see that it applies to me, can I then take advantage of my \"heter\"?</p>\n\n<p>Also: when petitioning a rov, does one always have to present a catalogue of extenuating circumstances, or in some cases is even the desire for a heter enough to get one? (That is, if I have a son and daughter already, must I have a special reason in order to be eligible to use birth control? ...And if not--if everyone gets one--why bother going to the rov at all?)</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps this question can be best summed up by my own situation, its motivation: I asked my community rabbi a shayla about a personal circumstance. He gave a stunningly lenient answer about what to do. Would it now be correct for me to say I have a \"heter\" to do such and such according to his advice? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It really depends on the question and severity of the issue at hand ie. Shaas hadchak, money considerations, mental health. But generally, big questions such as medical issues, end of life issues etc. should asked to a world expert on that particular topic. Like medical issues should be asked to a rav who is competent in those issues and has good medical advisors as well. </p>\n\n<p>Famously in regards to allowing abortion, Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach generally refused to answer questions put to him in certain circumstances but often he would send the questioner to get a Heter from The Tzitz Eliezer who was lenient in extremely specific cases (See Tzitz Eliezer 13:102). Despite the fact that the questioner came to Rav Shlomo Zalman nonetheless  he would send them to get, if needed, a Heter from the Tzitz Eliezer - Rav Eliezer Waldenberg (Posek of Bikur Cholim Hospital in Jerusalem) who in his great knowledge in Torah and expertise in Medicine was willing to issue such a brave psak.</p>\n\n<p>Of course when asking, all pertinent information should be presented to the Rav so as to make sure the psak is fitting with your life circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>A responsible Jew should ask a Rav before deciding for themselves especially in regards to complex questions where more often than not personal bias plays a heavy role as well as a serious lack of knowledge of the source material.</p>\n\n<p>As per your personal case I don't think this site is the forum for such guidance. Although, I will say if your Rav fits in the category as stated above (well versed in the sugya, takes issue seriously, has guidance in this realm) then I would not be overly concerned. </p>\n\n<p>There are many capable Rabbonim who are generally reachable through specific channels such as Rav Dovid Feinstein, Rav Yisroel Belsky (Zt\"l) , Rav Dovid Cohen, Rav Moshe Heinemann, and many more who are capable of dealing with such questions.</p>\n\n\n",

Modena responded to many inquiries about his rulings on various halakhic questions. However, one response of R. Modena dealt not only with a halakhic question, but also with an event that seems to have occurred frequently. R. Modena wrote that “a Rabbi Yitzhak Gershon12 would not once or twice, but every week berate [R. Modena] for standing with his hat in his hand [bareheaded].”</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Modena would stand outside the local synagogue speaking with people, all the while without a yarmulke, and R. Yitzhak Gershon would chastise him for doing so. R. Modena justified his practice and commented that “the majority of Jews in Italy [do not wear a yarmulke]” as well. He also noted that Italian Jews “dress differently [than other Jews], grow their hair long, and their custom is to remove their hats when greeting important people, as this honors them.” Indeed, when R. Modena’s Historia de Riti Hebraici, History of Jewish Rites, was published in 1637, the portrait of R.

Due to the concerns raised in the article there are those who manufacture aluminum in a way to avoid a possible issue. </p>\n\n<p>My understanding is that on Pesach when people are more careful than usual, even those who rely on the leniencies during the year may be extra careful and use only a product that has a strict supervision in place.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>During the manufacture of aluminum foil, molten aluminum alloys\n  undergo a series of rolling processes between top and bottom rollers.\n  During this process, release agents or lubricants are applied to\n  production lines that the foil comes into direct contact with.\n  However, initially the potential kashrus concerns are somewhat abated,\n  since during production the foil undergoes a process known as\n  annealing, which exposes the foil to a heat exceeding 1,000 degrees\n  Fahrenheit. This process would certainly burn any non-kosher residue\n  the aluminum foil might have come into contact with, and also qualify\n  as a kashering through the process of libun chamur. However, toward\n  the end of the process the temperature does drop somewhat\n  considerably. Although any foreign residue present on the foil’s\n  surface would still certainly be burnt out, the process would no\n  longer achieve kashering temperatures of libun chamur, and ta’am\n  (taste) from lubricant at that stage would be absorbed by the foil.\n  However, since the presence of release agents is always very minimal,\n  any ta’am that the foil could possibly impart would always meet bitul\n  proportions and become nullified in food. In halacha, this is known as\n  a keili hassui lehishtamesh beshefah, which is a utensil that absorbed\n  non-kosher taste in such minimal amounts, that the ta’am imparted by\n  the utensil will always become botel in the food cooked. The Mechaber\n  is lenient and allows one to use a keili hassui lehishtamesh beshefah\n  without hesitation. However, the Taz disagrees and only permits the\n  use of a keili hassui lehishtamesh beshefah if the issur and ta’am\n  imparted is unpalatable. There is a debate amongst authorities if a\n  utensil is permissible after a 24 hour period elapses, since once an\n  eino ben yomo, the bliyos (taste absorbed by the utensil) would be no\n  longer be palatable . This leniency would certainly apply to aluminum\n  foil, which is never available for retail sale on the market until\n  well after a 24 hour period has passed. Moreover, Rav Moshe Feinstein\n  zt’l is quoted as being lenient with aluminum foil, with slightly\n  different reasoning. According to Rav Moshe, since this particular\n  type of kli (utensil) is never available for purchase until after a 24\n  hour period has elapsed, the gezeira mederabbanan should not apply\n  altogether.</p>\n  \n  <p>Aluminum pans are manufactured in a similar fashion to foil and the\n  potential kashrus concerns are similar. However, there is one\n  additional consideration with pans. During manufacturing, thick foil\n  is stamped and formed into a pan shape and a very thin non-stick\n  coating is applied. This thin coating is a possible point of concern\n  as well. Therefore, some recommend washing the pans before use ,\n  although it is questionable whether this will effectively remove the\n  coating from the pan and obviate this concern. Nevertheless, since the\n  amount of any possible treifos present would be highly minimal, there\n  is still basis to be lenient.</p>\n  \n  <p>Although there is a possibility on some level that these questionable\n  materials could contain non-kosher components, research appears to\n  indicate that this issue is more likely to be just theoretical.\n  Another very important piece of the puzzle is that very often a\n  release agent or aid, even when containing a non-kosher component, is\n  independently foul tasting and not fit for consumption.

When he opened it up, recently he noticed that they were stale. He says that since they got moist, they became chametz and cannot be used. He further pointed out that since all matzah boxes stamp the year it was made, this means that one can <strong>never</strong> use matzot from one year to the next.</p>\n\n<p>My thinking - as long as the matzot never touched chametx, why would there be any problem using them. One of my friedns bought cases of matzot after Pesach was over because the prices had dropped significantly. The boxes were never opened, and on Pesach she had 1 year matzot. Some were a bit moist, so she put them in the oven for a few minutes and they were crisp and fine.</p>\n\n<p>As for my friends concern about it being moist, I don't see how this is different than the concern with gebrokts, and then, the matzot are completely soaked in the liquid.

Here is an excerpt from Bava Basra 130b.</p>\n\n<p>א''ר זריקא א''ר אמי א''ר חנינא אמר רבי הלכה כר' יוחנן בן ברוקה אמר ליה ר' אבא הורה איתמר במאי קמיפלגי מר סבר הלכה עדיפא ומר סבר מעשה רב תנו רבנן אין למדין הלכה לא מפי למוד ולא מפי מעשה עד שיאמרו לו הלכה למעשה שאל ואמרו לו הלכה למעשה ילך ויעשה מעשה ובלבד שלא ידמה מאי ובלבד שלא ידמה והא כל התורה כולה דמויי מדמינן לה אמר רב אשי הכי קאמר ובלבד שלא ידמה בטרפות דתניא אין אומרים בטרפות זו דומה לזו ואל תתמה שהרי חותכה מכאן ומתה חותכה מכאן וחיתה א''ל ר' אסי לר' יוחנן כי אמר לן מר הלכה הכי נעביד מעשה אמר לא תעבידו עד דאמינא הלכה למעשה אמר להו רבא לרב פפא ולרב הונא בריה דרב יהושע כי אתי פסקא דדינא דידי לקמייכו וחזיתו ביה פירכא לא תקרעוהו עד דאתיתו לקמאי אי אית לי טעמא אמינא לכו ואי לא הדרנא בי לאחר מיתה לא מיקרע תקרעוהו ומגמר נמי לא תגמרו מיניה לא מיקרע תקרעיניה דאי הואי התם דלמא הוה אמינא לכו טעמא</p>\n\n<p>Each approach has its own validity and purpose. There are quite a few interesting Rashbams there, and cross references to other sugyas with Rashi. </p>\n\n<p>But Halacha v'lo limaaseh definitely has it's benefits. One simple benefit is the ability to delve into a given subject to it's deepest understanding, without being distracted by extenuating circumstances of a specific case which would impact the outcome. </p>\n\n<p>The introduction to the Igros Moshe also addresses this, he too did not want that work to be used as a 'Halcha Limaaseh' work to look up rulings, but rather wanted the reader to get a better understanding of the issues at hand and use the information to properly rule in their particular situation. </p>\n\n\n",

If possible, try and put the opening in the North or South. West is also better, because generally (i think) the sukkah isn't full in the afternoon when the sun comes in on the West, so the few people who are can just sit with their backs to it.<br>\nNote that my sukkah has 1.5 open walls, so it might not be as much of an issue for people who have a more closed model.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you can, putting it <strong>up against a window</strong> is nice. It lets you pass things through very easily.<br>\n<strong>Building it up against a wall</strong> also lets you skip some of your walls.

If you want to put it in your own driveway, go ahead. But please, not in the street.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In my experience, the following are factors to consider:</p>\n\n<p>1) Flat, solid surface - build the sukkah on as even of a surface as possible.  Grass is the worst, for setting a table and chairs down and hoping they won't wobble.  Dirt is slightly better.</p>\n\n<p>2) Close to your house - build the sukkah close to your house, preferably near the closest entrance to your kitchen.  This minimizes the length of trips to bring out and clear food, and for bringing out the sukkah materials from your garage/storage room when you build the sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>3) Private - build your sukkah in the backyard, if possible.  You will have more privacy, which is especially important for sleeping in the sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>4) Against a wall of your house - if you build your sukkah against the wall of your house, you will have one less wall to build, and an easy, sturdy mount for the <em>s'chach</em>.  If you can, put it in a convex corner of the house, with two walls! (Be careful about roof overhangs, which will invalidate some of your sukkah area.)</p>\n\n<p>5) Not attached to a door - this is my personal opinion, but it is annoying to have the sukkah attached to the house, both for the people in the sukkah who now have house-traffic going through, and for the people who want to go out and have to circumvent the often crowded obstacles in the sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>That being said, good places for the sukkah are:</p>\n\n<p>1) <strong>A Deck</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you have a deck, that is the ideal spot for a sukkah.  It is a flat surface, is close to your house, and often has railings tall enough to count for at least one wall.  Decks are usually private, in your backyard.  You may have to violate rule 5, but it's worth it.</p>\n\n<p>2) <strong>A Patio</strong></p>\n\n<p>Patios are also generally smooth, flat surfaces, and are usually coming off a door to the house.  You can also usually leave a small amount of space between the house-entrance and the sukkah.</p>\n\n<p>3) <strong>Back end of your driveway</strong></p>\n\n<p>If your driveway goes around the side of your house, the back corner of your driveway can be a good spot.  It is flat, often has quick access to space that can be used for sukkah-supplies (the garage), and can still be out of the way, if your driveway is large enough.  Try not to ruin your kids' basketball court, though.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The above summary is very good. I would add a few others:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>One of the most obvious is to keep away from as many overhanging trees as possible. Remember that <strong>any</strong> area of the succah under any part of a tree or house overhang is disqualified for use as succah, and enough of such cover could invalidate the whole succah. So, be sure that you have a good idea of your succah dimensions.</p></li>\n<li><p>The window idea is excellent. But, I might also consider, along with the other factors, proximity to your garage or storage space, depending on the materials that your succah uses. If you're using boards, \"legos\", plastics, etc. and / or bamboo poles for schach, these occupy a lot of storage space and they are heavy. You'll like to minimize the schlepping as much as possible. Canvas succot don't matter as much because the canvas folds into a bag. The poles, though still occupy some space.</p></li>\n<li><p>As long as the other answer mentioned windows, I recommend even more, use as many existing walls as possible. When I lived in an apartment building, there was an enclosed courtyard. The janitor did the Succah construction, mostly. This was easy, as he had to put up just 1 wall and throw schach on top.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

In Diaspora it is read doubled, whereas in Israel, they are read separately.</p>\n\n<p>However, in a leap year, the catch up parsha is <em>Matot-Mas'ei</em> - almost 2 months later.

It is unclear if this means immediately before Shavu'ot, or by the time Shavu'ot comes, it should have already been read, meaning that it can be read 1 0r 2 weeks earlier.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rambam תפילה יג׃ב after quoting the above Gemara almost verbatim,7\n  adds:</p>\n  \n  <p>...והמנהג הפשוט שיהו קוראין במדבר סיני קודם עצרת. ואתחנן אחר תשעה באב.\n  אתם נצבים קודם ראש השנה. וצו את אהרן קודם הפסח בשנה פשוטה. לפיכך יש\n  שבתות שקורין בשחרית שני סדרין כגון אשה כי תזריע וזאת תהיה.ובהר סיני\n  ואם בחוקותי וכיוצא בהן כדי שישלימו בשנה ויקראו אותן הסדרים בעונתן</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it seems, that Ramba\"m insists that we leave 1 week between <em>Bechukotai</em> and Shavu'ot. It seems that this is the opinion that we follow.</p>\n\n<p>I checked the calendar arrangement in MS Outlook comparing this year with next year, as Pesach is on Shabbat in both years - this year regular year and next year a leap year.</p>\n\n<p>This year, a non-leap year, if we (Diaspora) didn't double them up, <em>Bechukotai</em> would be read on Erev Shavu'ot, which is the Shabbat immediately prior to Shavu'ot (Shavu'ot is on Sunday.) Therefore, this parsha is doubled.</p>\n\n<p>Next year, which is a leap year, in Diaspora, Bechukotai which is read on its own is already 2 weeks before Shavu'ot, and the Shabbat immediately before Shavu'ot is <em>Bamidbar</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Ramba\"m mentions an additional concern, namely that <em>Va'etchanan</em> be read after Tish'a B'Av. To do this, <em>Devarim</em> must be the parsha immediately before (or on) Tish'a B'av (as is this year. I think that's why Ramba\"m was careful to phrase things in terms of <em>Va'etchanan</em>.) To do this, in Israel, <em>Matot-Mas'ei</em> are read separately. (In most years, they are doubled.)</p>\n\n\n",

When they told him that they came early to the Synagogue and left it late, he said: That is what helps them. Even as R. Joshua b. Levi said to his children: Come early to the Synagogue and leave it late that you may live long. R. Aha son of R. Hanina says: Which verse [may be quoted in support of this]? Happy is the man that hearkeneth to Me, watching daily at My gates, waiting at the posts of My doors,  after which it is written: For whoso findeth me findeth life.

Samuel Eidels</a> in his commentary to this passage writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש לפרש ע\"פ מה שאמרו בפ' בני העיר עתידין בתי כנסיות ובתי מדרשות שבבבל שיקבעו בא\"י כו' וקאמר עד\"ז שכני הרעים הנוגעי' בנחלה וגו' דהיינו שנוגע דבר זה בנחלה אשר הנחלתי לבני ישראל שהוא א\"י דאותן בתי כנסיות שבבבל גם הם יהיו מכלל א\"י שיקבעו שם לעתיד ומייתי עלה איכא סבי בבבל תמה למען וגו' על האדמה וגו' ומסיק דאהנו להו דקדימו וחשיכו כו' דהיינו טעמא דבי כנשתא דבבבל ה\"ל כאלו הם על האדמה שהרי יקבע לעתיד שם בא\"י</p>\n<p>This can be explained by what [the Sages] said in chapter \"The Members of the City\", that in the future the synagogues and study halls of Babylon will be transplanted to Israel, etc. And about this [Scripture] says \"the wicked neighbors that touch the inheritance\", that is that they touch this thing of the inheritance that I have given as inheritance to to children off Israel, which is the Land of Israel, so those synagogues in Babylon are included in the Land of Israel where they will in the future be transplanted. And regarding this [the Talmud] brings that \"there were old men in Babylon, he showed astonishment, that, etc.\" \"upon the land, etc.\" and concludes that [the fact that] they came early and stayed late helped them. And the reason is that the synagogues in Babylon are as if they are upon the land [of Israel] since they will be transplanted there in the Land of Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_Sofer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R.

If we treat them as holy then they will in the future be transplanted to Israel (as in Megillah 29a), and even now they have the holiness of Israel and the prayers are sent to the gate of heaven. But if heaven forfend we treat them disrespectfully God forbid and speak in them useless words, and the air of useless words is impure and the angel of the Diaspora is dressed in it and even becomes the owner of the synagogue God forbid, and he accepts the prayers and brings them to the outer ones, and it is like idolatry like one who lives in the Diaspora who is compared to one who has no God (like in Ketubot 110b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, by putting these three sources together we see that Synagogue attendance causes long life because it is as if one is in the Land of Israel, but if one talks in the synagogue then it is no longer considered as if he is in the Land of Israel. Accordingly, we can say that the reward for not talking during prayer is long life, because refraining from talking grants it the status of the Land of Israel which is how you get long life.</p>\n\n\n",

Now, suppose he does so, and then the fellow in charge of getting people to lead the services comes over to him and asks him to lead <em>shacharis</em>. (Assume for the purposes of this question that he cannot, or does not, refuse, and goes to the lectern to lead the services.) Normally, the <em>shacharis</em> leader starts reciting aloud from \"<em>Yishtabach</em>\" and then says <em>kadish</em> — but, of course, in this case, he's said \"<em>Yishtabach</em>\" already. Skipping reciting it aloud will be unusual for the congregation (not a big deal necessarily) and may cause someone present who cannot himself pray to miss out on hearing a prayer and fulfilling his obligation that way (not likely, but conceivable, in most synagogues). On the other hand, I seem to recall a rule that no one say <em>chatzi kadish</em> between prayer sections without saying the preceding prayer immediately beforehand; if I recall that rule correctly, then for our protagonist to start with <em>kadish</em> would be inappropriate also. So what should he do?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rama discusses a similar situation in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.54.3\" rel=\"nofollow\">ShA OC 54:3</a> where, after reciting Yishtabach, the congregation halted the prayer service for specific Mitzva/communal needs.

(It seems to me that his specification of \"from Pesukei Dizimra\" is <em>lav davka</em> and any verses should suffice, though those may be thematically appropriate.)</p>\n\n<p>Regarding your first point: I am not aware of an obligation on the Chazzan to fulfill illiterate congregants' obligation to say Yishtabach. Indeed it seems unlikely that there is one, as traditionally there is no mandated Chazzan for Yishtabach's sister-blessing of Baruch SheAmar (cf. ShA OC 53:1 who begins the Chazzan's role with Yishtabach). Furthermore, Rambam in his presentation of public prayer (Tefilla 9:1) omits the public recitation of Yishtabach entirely.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What should our response be to ancient scripts that mirror the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are quite a number of ancient documents that have been found that (supposedly) predate the Torah, and yet they share many lines practically verbatim. If the Torah is truly divine, how could this be? Seems as if many lines were directly copied and borrowed from other, earlier works.</p>\n\n<p>Another example of this would be that there have been ancient plans discovered that are almost exactly the design/layout of the Mishkan, but, of course, predate the Mishkan by quite a while. How, then, can the Mishkan be divine, as we would say that it is?</p>\n\n<p>What should our response be to these sorts of issues?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>It's perfectly plausible that God commanded, for instance, to use designs similar to existing idolatrous ones, and instead turn them on their head by modifying them to build the Tabernacle.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the Torah quotes the curses that were written by professionals before Sichon went to battle against Moab. They were written by someone else, but for whatever reason, God wanted them to appear in the Torah, so He commanded Moses to write them into the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>It's therefore acceptable that God chose to use some existing texts (often with highlighted tweaks) when writing a complete whole that was dictated to Moses. And that's okay. In some cases, parts of it may have even been intended to sound familiar to the audience. E.g. if I said \"there's a feminist cereal called Snap, Crackle, & Mom\", you'd get the joke if you'd already heard something similar.</p>\n\n<p>Often when we focus on the differences, we can then see what points were being stressed. E.g. the Torah says the laws of an ox killing a person are the same if it kills a boy or girl -- it turns out that other codes at the time had different rules if the victim was a child, as they had less financial value.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>You make a mistake in assuming that in order for something to be Divine it must be completely original.</p>\n<p>To understand the Torah and G-d's intentions and its applicability to modern times does not require cutting off and ignoring the societal backdrop of the Torah's historical time period. This means that although there may be some slight similarities in certain laws to the Code Of Hammurabi or similar themes in the flood story to the Epic of Gilgamesh, it's not concerning. The Torah does not claim to be the sole source and originator of judicial law, society's were governed by law, way before the Torah was given i.e. Derech Eretz.</p>\n<p>Rather, the Torah is coming \"to set the record straight\". Meaning that the intention of \"re-stating\" the laws either to infuse mundane societal laws with divinity and the novel concept of a G-d centered moral code which up until then was primarily dictated by rulers.</p>\n<p>Regarding the flood story, the Torah repeats it in order to actually tell the \"true story\" of the flood, devoid of all the idolatrous aspects that crept in over the generations as a result of it being retold again and again. (IIRC Rav Dovid Z Hoffman makes this argument, but I can’t seem to find where)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, without an intimate knowledge of Akkadian or Hyroglyphics or other ancient Semitic language it's almost impossible to claim that verses were taken from one source to the other. The nuances of these languages can sometimes change the entire meaning of an inscription. (Heard from Rav Aharon Lopiansky)</p>\n<p>In regards to similarities to the building of the Mishkan. Human history is rife with man's desire to reach out to G-d in many forms of altars and worship centers. But the difference in Judaism is that the commandment to build the Miskhan: \"ועשו לי מקדש ושכנתי בתוכם\": marks the first time that G-d <em>reached out</em> to man to build. That alone suffuses the keilim - holy vessels in the Mishkan with profound divinity.</p>\n<p>Thus, you could find similar, or even the exact same floor plans of the Mishkan anywhere in the world, but at its core and essence it is a completely different entity from the Mishkan. (Heard from Rav Yechiel Perr, in writing <a href=\"https://www.yofr.org/dvar-torah/parsha/parshas-terumah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well)</p>\n<p>I suggest the Shiurim of Rav Ahron Lopiansky on the topic archaeological evidence and the Torah which can be found <a href=\"http://www.torahdownloads.com/shiur-1009751.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>History isn't a science. It can't be proved. Therefore, it's difficult to accurately place ancient texts in a coherent timeline. This is both because of the precise nature of the Jewish traditions (which in turn yields precise dates), and because of the equally vague histories of all other cultures preceding the Greeks (and even largely including the early Greeks). Naturally, historians didn't choose the precise, rational tradition from which to date the rest. They chose the Egyptians.</p>\n<p>Archeologist David Rohl has explored the inherent contradictions in the traditional Egyptian dating scheme in his book A Test of Time. He argues that the connection of Pharaoh Shoshenk I to the Jewish name for an Egyptian king \"Shishak\" is actually incorrect. Since this connection is what's used by Egyptologists to fix their histories to a particular point in time (while ignoring the obvious irony of using the Jewish tradition to disprove the Jewish tradition), there's certainly ample room for speculation regarding relative dates (as Egyptian dates are then used to date all other cultures in that general area and timeframe). I am unqualified to evaluate his claim, except for mentioning that he makes a compelling, apparently consistent argument from the perspective of broad history that explains a number of oddities within the Egyptian tradition. \"Fixing\" the Egyptian dates to his corrected timeline also eliminates the Greek Dark Age (a period of little archeological evidence that chronologers insist is there because the timelines require it to be there.) I have not seen how he reconciles his new timeline with carbon dating, however.</p>\n<p>Importantly, many Egyptologists, while rejecting his argument, agree with his analysis of the weakness of the Egyptian chronology. Professor Erik Hornung, for instance: \"...there remain many uncertainties in the Third Intermediate Period, as critics such as David Rohl have rightly maintained; even our basic premise of 925 [BC] for Shoshenq’s campaign to Jerusalem is not built on solid foundations\" (from his article \"Ancient Egyptian Chronology\"). It's important to note that shifting the date of Shoshenq at minimum shifts all the chronology directly dependent on it, which is a quite substantial correction.</p>\n<p>\"An extreme low chronology has been proposed recently by a group devoted to revising the absolute chronology of the Mediterranean and Western Asia: P. James et al., Centuries of Darkness, London, 1991; similar, though slightly diverging revisions, are upheld by another group, too, and partly published in the Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum. The hub for the dating of other cultures is Egypt, so much of the work of both groups focuses on Egyptian evidence. Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework presented in these volumes, but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.\" Professor Amélie Kuhrt, The Ancient Near East, a standard reference work.</p>\n<p>Of course, this is as Rohl presents it. Alexander Hool presents yet another timeline correction (from a Jewish perspective) in his The Challenge of Jewish history, attempting to show by the 150 or so years difference between the Greeks and Jewish tradition is resolved by critically examining the details of the Greek dates themselves, and weighing the credibility of various Greek sources.</p>\n<p>I am not presenting this as conclusive evidence, but merely to show the concept of dates becomes exceedingly vague and exceedingly controversial (to the non-dogmatist historians anyway) the further back we go. Adding to this confusion is the bogus Documentary Hypothesis (one argument put simply: a single writer must use the same name of G-d, so any \"name change\" of G-d is proof of a different author). The only way to get to a Documentary Hypothesis is to assume the Torah was written by a collection of borderline illiterates incapable of nuance, and therefore ANY variation between stories or narrative pacing, etc, is because of a different author (ie. \"one author wouldn't do <em>that</em>, so there must be at least two authors\"). This is an obviously absurd instance of circular logic, but it's commonly used to \"prove\" the Jewish date for their Torah is false. (taken Rabbi Dr. David Gottlieb his Youtube lecture, Jewish Philosophy: Biblical Criticism - Parts 1&2)</p>\n<p>Putting these uncertainties together, it becomes unclear exactly what we can reasonably say about the originality of one tradition over another, unless of course, we are comparing texts that were written so far apart that this uncertainty becomes irrelevant. And comparing these uncertainties to the abundance of detail, clarity, and the scope of the Jewish tradition, one is certainly not obligated to jettison the latter for the former. This is, of course, in addition to the above great answers to this question.</p>\n\n\n",

This much is clear from the text. But in between Esther's parties, Haman constructs a gallows 50 cubits tall, at his own home, specifically to hang Mordechai.  I'm a little befuddled by how he could think he could get away with this.  True, he lurked in the king's courtyard that night, probably rehearsing his speech and/or waiting for the king to wake up, so he could request permission for Mordechai's hanging.  But wouldn't Ahashverosh find it a little bit odd that Haman had <em>already built</em> the gallows <em>at his own home</em> to hang Mordechai?</p>\n\n<p>Under what kind of system of laws were the Persians operating that Haman could conceive of this as somehow legitimate - or legitimate enough to avoid some kind of inquiry by the king's court into what the heck he had planned and for how long?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When Haman is introduced (I think it's chapter 3), we see that Mordechai was already violating the king's command that everyone should bow to Haman.

The work had never been missing, but was merely in manuscript form for some six hundred years, only being printed for the first time in the 18th century. My guess is that the anonymous author of the article you cite is using the phrase \"modern times\" to refer to this period, but the implication that the work was either unknown or unstudied before that point is entirely untrue. Obviously, with its publication in the 18th century, it came to be known and studied by a larger group of people.</p>\n\n<p>If you wish to see a printed source for the foregoing, cf:</p>\n\n<p>Menachem Elon, <em>Jewish Law: History, Sources, Principles</em> (4 vols; trans.

Shimon bM is correct in that the <em>Beit ha-Beḥirah</em>, the most famous work of the Meiri, was first printed in the 18th century, but there is now a corpus of the Meiri that is due to the work of 20th century scholarship. Here are some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The Meiri wrote other commentaries to the Talmud besides his <em>Beit\nha-Beḥirah</em>. The manuscripts are available in the scholarly world, but most have not been printed.\nHis commentary to <em>Beitzah</em>, for example, was printed in 1956. His introduction to <em>Avot</em> was published in 1995, in a book called <em>Seder ha-Kabbalah</em>. Further publishing of his Talmudic commentaries is very contemporary.</li>\n<li>The Meiri wrote a book on teshuva as a young man, called <em>Ḥibbur ha-Teshuvah</em>, printed in its entirety for the first time in 1950. </li>\n<li>The Meiri's commentary to <em>Tehillim</em> was first published in 1936. </li>\n<li>The Meiri wrote a book on the customs of the Jewish community in Provence, called <em>Magen Avot</em>, first printed in 1909. </li>\n<li>Different collections from the Meiri's works, including those taken from unpublished manuscripts, have also been published. This includes a Meiri commentary on the Haggadah, first published in 1965, a book of <em>mussar</em> called <em>Sefer ha-Middot</em> published in 1966, and an anthology of <em>drashot</em> published in 1957. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>It is in this sense that one might claim that the Meiri has been \"rediscovered\" in modern times. It is not that he was unknown before modern times, nor is \"modernity\" defined as the 18th century. Of course, the Meiri has been known and studied for much longer. His commentary to <em>Kohelet</em> was printed at the end of the 15th century and in subsequent <em>Mikraot Gedolot</em>. He was even known to the Jewish world during his lifetime (beyond the close communities who had access to the <em>Beit ha-Beḥirah</em>), particularly because of his involvement in R. Aderet's polemic against the Rambam. Nevertheless, it is the modern publications of the Meiri that has sparked more attention to his genius, and I would venture to guess has produced more interest in his classic Talmudic commentary. </p>\n\n\n",

For one such example, here is the Ben Ish Hai, (Hacham Yosef Haim) who lived from 1832-1909 in Baghdad, and who refers to the <em>maghrab</em> (an Islamic prayer-time called after sunset) in various places:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ben Ish Hai, Year 1, Vayakhel #4</strong></p>\n<p>וכן המנהג פשוט פה עירנו בגדא\"ד יע\"א לשער מעמוד השחר עד צאת הכוכבים, כי אצלנו חושבים צאת הכוכבים שליש שעה אחר קריאת המגרב בעיר זו, וכך קבלו לשער בזה מן עט\"ר הרה\"ג מור זקני רבינו משה חיים זלה\"ה</p>\n<p>[Regarding the halachic dispute of determining the length of a day] Here in Baghdad, the accepted custom instituted by my grandfather, our teacher R. Moshe Haim z\"l, is to calculate the length of the day from daybreak to nightfall, and we calculate nightfall as being twenty minutes after calling <em>maghrab</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here's another source, which introduces other locales using this system and provides more sources:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ben Ish Hai, Year 1, Vayakhel #9</strong></p>\n<p>והנה פה עירנו בגדאד יע\"א בחנו ונסו הראשונים וראו שבמקום גבוה שבעיר נראית שקיעת החמה שבעה דקים קודם קריאת המגרב, ועל כל העלתי בסה\"ק רב פעלים בתשובה בס\"ד דפה עירנו אין רשאין להתפלל מנחה אלא עד ששה דקים אחר קריאת המגר\"ב, כי עד ששה דקים הוא נקרא בין השמשות ויכולים להתפלל בו מנחה בשעת הדחק לדעת המתירים, וא\"כ לא יתחילו להתפלל אלא עד ארבעה דקים אחר קריאת המגר\"ב כדי שתהיה תפלת המנחה רובה בתוך בין השמשות. ויש מקומות ששקיעת החמה אצלם עשרה דקים קודם קריאת המגר\"ב, וכמ\"ש הרה\"ג הרח\"ף ז\"ל על עיר אחת, והם ישערו זמן בין השמשות כפי המצוי בעירם. ושמעתי מנהג עה\"ק ירושלים וחברון תוב\"ב אם כבר קרא המגר\"ב אין מתפללין מנחה לא בחול ולא בשבת, והוא כפי עדות הגאון חיד\"א ז\"ל ועיין במחב\"ר סי' רס\"א אות ז' ובסי' תנ\"ד אות ב' ועיין עוד בברכ\"י ומחב\"ר סי' של\"א ואדרת אליהו סי' י\"ג ותפארת אדם סי' י\"א ולב חיים סי' קל\"ד יע\"ש</p>\n<p>And the exact time of sunset in Baghdad has been established in previous generations, by observation from the highest point in the city, as being seven minutes before <em>maghrab</em> is called. If one did not pray mincha at the correct time, I conclude in my work Rav Pealim that, here in Baghdad, one may pray until six minutes after <em>maghrab</em>, since until then it is still dusk. However, since it is necessary to pray the major portion of the amidah during the permitted time, one should not begin the amidah later than four minutes after <em>maghrab</em> is called.</p>\n<p><em>Maghrab</em> is not called at the same time in all areas: R. Haim Palagi z\"l mentions the case of a city where sunset occurs ten minutes before <em>maghrab</em> is called. In that city, the time of dusk must be calculated accordingly.</p>\n<p>I have heard that, in the Holy City and in Hevron, if <em>Maghrab</em> has already been called, mincha is subsequently not prayed, both during the week and on Shabbat (cf. Birkei Yosef; Mahzik Brachah ch. 331; Aderet Eliyahu ch. 13; Tiferet Adam ch. 11; Lev Haim ch. 134).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Please help me out </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Very interesting question! The confusion arises primarily due to semantic concerns when translating between Hebrew and English.</p>\n\n<p>Metaphysical literature in Judaism recognizes five parts to the \"spiritual essense\" of man, some of which are given analogous physical components.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Nefesh - the \"sustaining force,\" this correlates to blood/the circulatory system in animals and humans. Jews are explicitly forbidden to eat blood due to this connection.</li>\n<li>Ruach - the \"spirit,\" this correlates to the respiratory system.</li>\n<li>Neshama - translation at this point can get a bit... dicey. This has to do with the capacity for thought and correlates to the nervous system. Generally this is what people talk about as the \"soul,\" but it is connected/bundled to the next two levels.</li>\n<li>Chayah - literally \"life-ness.\" This is hard to explain. It's... kind of an atomistic spiritual force... like the \"nefesh/life force of the soul\" ...</li>\n<li>Yechidah - \"Uniqueness\" - considered the \"highest\" level of the soul. It correlates to the \"source\" of the soul in it's unique connection to God.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There's plenty of discussion around the precise metaphysical mechanics of the upper levels of the soul, but it's <strong><em>really</em></strong> esoteric and almost entirely in hebrew (and yiddish!)</p>\n\n<p>To directly answer your question:\nYour \"sustaining - nefesh\" and \"animating/breathing/speaking - ruach\" forces are vested in the body to make it function, but your \"soul - neshamah\"-self is the purely spiritual \"you\"-ness that expresses itself in the intellect. It is sustained by the Chayah through the Yechidah - it's direct connection to God.</p>\n\n<p>To clarify - when you die, you shed the cloak of your physical body, the ruach and the nefesh being the tools employed by you in that body, and you - the neshamah (and it's related parts) - emerge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Here is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Ashlag\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Ashlag</a>, which is one of the greatest <em>Mekubalim</em> of about a hundred years ago:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>TWO CREATIONS: A) MAN, B) A LIVING SOUL</p>\n  \n  <p>From the above, we can clearly understand the verse: “And the Lord God\n  formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils\n  the breath of life; and man became a living (Chayah) soul (Nefesh)”\n  (Genesis 2:7). Here we find two creations:</p>\n  \n  <p>A. Man himself;</p>\n  \n  <p>B. The living soul itself.</p>\n  \n  <p>And the verse says that in the beginning, man was created as dust of\n  the ground, a collection of molecules in which resides the essence of\n  man, meaning his will to receive. That force, the will to receive, is\n  present in every element of reality, as we have explained above. Also,\n  all four types: still, vegetative, animate and speaking emerged from\n  them. In that respect, man has no advantage over any part of creation,\n  and this is the meaning of the verse in the words: “dust of the\n  ground.”</p>\n  \n  <p>However, we have already seen that this force, called “will to\n  receive,” cannot exist without dressing and acting in a desired\n  object, and this action is called, “life.” And accordingly, we find\n  that before man has arrived at the human forms of reception of\n  pleasure, which differ from those of other animals, he is still\n  considered a lifeless, dead person. This is because his will to\n  receive has no place in which to dress and manifest his actions, which\n  are the manifestations of life.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is the meaning of the verse, “and breathed into his nostrils the\n  breath of life,” which is the general form of reception suitable for\n  humans. The word, Nishmat, (breath) comes from the word, Samin,\n  (placing) the ground for him, which is like “value.” And the origin of\n  the word “breath” is understood from the verse (Job 33:4): “The spirit\n  of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty has given me life,”\n  and see the commentary of the MALBIM there. The word, “soul”\n  (Neshama), has the same syntax structure as the words, “missing”\n  (Nifkad), “accused” (Ne’esham), and “accused” (Ne’eshama—female term\n  of Ne’esham).</p>\n  \n  <p>And the meaning of the words, “and breathed into his nostrils” is that\n  He instills a soul (Neshama) in his internality and an appreciation of\n  life, which is the sum of the forms that are worthy of reception into\n  his will to receive. Then, that force, the will to receive, enclosed\n  in his molecules, has found a place in which to dress and act, meaning\n  in those forms of reception that he had obtained from the Creator. And\n  this action is called “life,” as we have explained above.</p>\n  \n  <p>And the verse ends, “and man became a living soul.” This means that\n  since the will to receive has begun to act by the measures of those\n  forms of reception, life instantly manifested in it and it “became a\n  living soul.” However, prior to the attainment of those forms of\n  reception, although the force of the will to receive had been\n  imprinted in him, it is still considered a lifeless body, since it has\n  no place in which to appear and to manifest in action.</p>\n  \n  <p>As we have seen above, although man’s essence is only the will to\n  receive, it is still taken as half of a whole, as it must clothe in a\n  reality that comes its way. For that reason, it and the image of\n  possession it depicts are literally one, for otherwise it would not be\n  able to exist for even a moment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Source:  <a href=\"http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/31386?/eng/content/view/full/31386&main\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kabbalah.info/eng/content/view/frame/31386?/eng/content/view/full/31386&main</a>  </p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> THIS SOURCE IS FROM A CULT THAT TRANSLATED RABBI ASHLAG'S WRITING.

If he doesn’t have a wife, [those in attendance] ask each other, “Why is this night different?” even if they are all sages. If he is alone, he asks himself, “Why is this night different?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(<em>Technically</em>, Mah Nishtanah isn’t strictly required. What <em>is</em> required is that the general question be asked, even if not in those words: what’s the big deal about tonight? Cf. Pesachim 116a.)</p>\n\n<p>§4:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְצָרִיךְ לְהַתְחִיל בִּגְנוּת וּלְסַיֵּם בְּשֶׁבַח. כֵּיצַד. מַתְחִיל וּמְסַפֵּר שֶׁבַּתְּחִלָּה הָיוּ אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בִּימֵי תֶּרַח וּמִלְּפָנָיו כּוֹפְרִים וְטוֹעִין אַחַר הַהֶבֶל וְרוֹדְפִין אַחַר עֲבוֹדַת אֱלִילִים. וּמְסַיֵּם בְּדַת הָאֱמֶת שֶׁקֵּרְבָנוּ הַמָּקוֹם לוֹ וְהִבְדִּילָנוּ מֵהָאֻמּוֹת וְקֵרְבָנוּ לְיִחוּדוֹ. וְכֵן מַתְחִיל וּמוֹדִיעַ שֶׁעֲבָדִים הָיִינוּ לְפַרְעֹה בְּמִצְרַיִם וְכָל הָרָעָה שֶׁגְּמָלָנוּ וּמְסַיֵּם בַּנִּסִּים וּבַנִּפְלָאוֹת שֶׁנַּעֲשׂוּ לָנוּ וּבְחֵרוּתֵנוּ. וְהוּא שֶׁיִּדְרשׁ מֵ(דברים כו ה) \"אֲרַמִּי אֹבֵד אָבִי\" עַד שֶׁיִּגְמֹר כָּל הַפָּרָשָׁה. וְכָל הַמּוֹסִיף וּמַאֲרִיךְ בִּדְרַשׁ פָּרָשָׁה זוֹ הֲרֵי זֶה מְשֻׁבָּח:  </p>\n  \n  <p>He must begin with disgrace and conclude with praise. How so? He begins and tells over that originally our forefathers, in the days of Terach and earlier, were deniers, straying after vanity and chasing after idolatry. He concludes with the truth that Hashem has brought us close to him and separated us from the nations, bringing us close to his uniqueness. Likewise, he begins and acknowledges that we were slaves to Paroh in Mitzraim, and all the evil which he gave us, and he concludes with the miracles and wonders which were done for us and in our freedom. He expounds from “An Aramean destroyed my father” until he finishes the entire passage. Whoever adds and extends in expounding this passage, he is praiseworthy. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>§5:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל מִי שֶׁלֹּא אָמַר שְׁלֹשָׁה דְּבָרִים אֵלּוּ בְּלֵיל חֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר לֹא יָצָא יְדֵי חוֹבָתוֹ וְאֵלּוּ הֵן. פֶּסַח מַצָּה וּמָרוֹר. פֶּסַח עַל שׁוּם שֶׁפָּסַח הַמָּקוֹם עַל בָּתֵּי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְּמִצְרַיִם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות יב כז) \"וַאֲמַרְתֶּם זֶבַח פֶּסַח הוּא לַה'\" וְגוֹ'. מָרוֹר עַל שׁוּם שֶׁמֵּרְרוּ הַמִּצְרִיִּים אֶת חַיֵּי אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בְּמִצְרַיִם. מַצָּה עַל שָׁם שֶׁנִּגְאֲלוּ. וּדְבָרִים הָאֵלּוּ כֻּלָּן נִקְרָאִין הַגָּדָה:  </p>\n  \n  <p>Whoever doesn’t say these things on the night of the fifteenth has not fulfilled his obligation. These are they: Pesach, Matzah, and Marror. Pesach is because Hashem passed over the houses of our fathers in Mitzraim, as it says, “And you will say, ‘it is a Pesach sacrifice to Hashem, etc.’” Marror is because the Mitzri’im embittered the lives of our fathers in Mitzraim. Matzah is because we were redeemed. All of these things are called “Haggadah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(When the Rambam writes “all” of these things, it’s unclear to me whether he refers to Pesach, Matzah, and Marror, or to everything listed above, from §3.)</p>\n\n<p>§6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בְּכָל דּוֹר וָדוֹר חַיָּב אָדָם לְהַרְאוֹת אֶת עַצְמוֹ כְּאִלּוּ הוּא בְּעַצְמוֹ יָצָא עַתָּה מִשִּׁעְבּוּד מִצְרַיִם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (דברים ו כג) \"וְאוֹתָנוּ הוֹצִיא מִשָּׁם\" וְגוֹ'.</p>\n  \n  <p>In every generation, a person is obligated to show himself as if he personally left, now, from the enslavement in Mitzraim, as it says, “And He took us from there.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn’t indicate that one is obligated to say this Mishnah, but it does indicate that one must show himself (Rambam has a different reading of the Mishnah than we do, apparently) as if he personally left. As such, it’s certainly prudent to say this Mishnah, to emphasize this point. </p>\n\n<p>§7:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְכָל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד בֵּין אֲנָשִׁים בֵּין נָשִׁים חַיָּב לִשְׁתּוֹת בַּלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה אַרְבָּעָה כּוֹסוֹת שֶׁל יַיִן. אֵין פּוֹחֲתִין לוֹ מֵהֶם.</p>\n  \n  <p>Everyone, both men and women, are obligated to drink four cups of wine on this night, no fewer than that. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>§10:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כָּל כּוֹס וְכוֹס מֵאַרְבָּעָה כּוֹסוֹת הַלָּלוּ מְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בְּרָכָה בִּפְנֵי עַצְמָהּ. וְכוֹס רִאשׁוֹן אוֹמֵר עָלָיו קִדּוּשׁ הַיּוֹם. כּוֹס שֵׁנִי קוֹרֵא עָלָיו אֶת הַהַגָּדָה. כּוֹס שְׁלִישִׁי מְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בִּרְכַּת הַמָּזוֹן. כּוֹס רְבִיעִי גּוֹמֵר עָלָיו אֶת הַהַלֵּל וּמְבָרֵךְ עָלָיו בִּרְכַּת הַשִּׁיר.</p>\n  \n  <p>On each of these four cups, we make an individual blessing on it. On the first cup, he says Kiddush. On the second cup, he reads the Haggadah. On the third cup, he bentches. On the fourth cup, he finishes Hallel and recites Yehalelucha. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The identity of Birchas HaShir is disputed in the Gemara (Pesachim 118a), whether this refers to Yehalelucha or Nishmas. In practice, we say both in Hallel; however, in 8:10, the Rambam explicitly identifies it as Yehalelucha. </p>\n\n<p>What about the rest of the Seder? In chapter 8, the Rambam gives the basic rundown of the Seder. Some notable parts:</p>\n\n<p>§1-2:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְבָרֵךְ עַל נְטִילַת יָדַיִם וְנוֹטֵל יָדָיו. [...] מַתְחִיל וּמְבָרֵךְ בּוֹרֵא פְּרִי הָאֲדָמָה וְלוֹקֵחַ יָרָק וּמְטַבֵּל אוֹתוֹ בַּחֲרֹסֶת וְאוֹכֵל כְּזַיִת הוּא וְכָל הַמְסֻבִּין עִמּוֹ כָּל אֶחָד וְאֶחָד אֵין אוֹכֵל פָּחוֹת מִכְּזַיִת. וְאַחַר כָּךְ עוֹקְרִין הַשֻּׁלְחָן מִלִּפְנֵי קוֹרֵא הַהַגָּדָה לְבַדּוֹ. וּמוֹזְגִין הַכּוֹס הַשֵּׁנִי וְכָאן הַבֵּן שׁוֹאֵל. וְאוֹמֵר הַקּוֹרֵא מַה נִּשְׁתַּנָּה הַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה מִכָּל הַלֵּילוֹת שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אֵין אָנוּ מַטְבִּילִין אֲפִלּוּ פַּעַם אַחַת וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה שְׁתֵּי פְּעָמִים. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין חָמֵץ וּמַצָּה וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ מַצָּה. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין בְּשַׂר צָלִי שָׁלוּק וּמְבֻשָּׁל וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלּוֹ צָלִי. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין שְׁאָר יְרָקוֹת וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה מְרוֹרִים. שֶׁבְּכָל הַלֵּילוֹת אָנוּ אוֹכְלִין בֵּין יוֹשְׁבִין בֵּין מְסֻבִּין וְהַלַּיְלָה הַזֶּה כֻּלָּנוּ מְסֻבִּין: </p>\n  \n  <p>After [Kiddush], he makes an Al Netilas Yadayim and washes his hands. [...] He begins and makes a Borei Pri Ha’adamah, and he takes a vegetable and dips it into Charoses and eats a Kezayis - he and all those seated with him. Nobody may eat less than a Kezayis. Afterwards, we remove the table only from the one who recites the Haggadah; we pour the second cup, and here the son asks, “Why is this night different from all other nights? [...]”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Rambam is clearly implying that Urchatz and Karpas are performed in order that the children ask; while this is not his suggestion in 7:3 regarding how to do this, it’s for that reason that it’s done. This is borne out by Pesachim 116a as well:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מה נשתנה הלילה הזה מכל הלילות שבכל הלילות אנו מטבילין פעם אחת הלילה הזה שתי פעמים: מתקיף לה רבא אטו כל יומא לא סגיא דלא מטבלא חדא זימנא אלא אמר רבא הכי קתני שבכל הלילות אין אנו חייבין לטבל אפילו פעם אחת הלילה הזה שתי פעמים מתקיף לה רב ספרא חיובא לדרדקי</p>\n  \n  <p>”Why is this night different from all other nights? For on all nights we dip once, but tonight we dip twice.” Rava challenges this: “Do you think every day a person manages to dip once?!” Rather, Rava said, “This is how it should be taught: ‘For on all nights we are not obligated to dip once, but tonight, we dip twice.’” Rav Safra challenged this: “Is there an obligation for the children?!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since Karpas is only meant for the children to ask, it seems strange to refer to it as an obligation. What we see from here is that while Karpas specifically isn’t mandatory, something to the effect of getting the children to ask is. </p>\n\n<p>I should also note that the Rambam did not seem to hold of Yachatz or Ha Lachma Anya, as he jumps from Karpas straight to Mah Nishtanah. </p>\n\n<p>It should go without saying that Matzah and Marror are obligatory (the latter Rabbinically nowadays, but still obligatory), but the Rambam discusses them in 7:12-13 and 8:6-8. At the end of §8, he writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְחוֹזֵר וְכוֹרֵךְ מַצָּה וּמָרוֹר וּמְטַבֵּל בַּחֲרֹסֶת וְאוֹכְלָן בְּלֹא בְּרָכָה זֵכֶר לַמִּקְדָּשׁ: </p>\n  \n  <p>He goes back and wraps Matzah and Marror and dips it in Charoses and eats them without a Beracha, as a remembrance of the Mikdash. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It’s unclear to me from this whether the Rambam holds Korech is an absolute obligation or not. </p>\n\n<p>§9:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְאַחַר כָּךְ נִמְשָׁךְ בַּסְּעֻדָּה וְאוֹכֵל כָּל מַה שֶּׁהוּא רוֹצֶה לֶאֱכל וְשׁוֹתֶה כָּל מַה שֶּׁהוּא רוֹצֶה לִשְׁתּוֹת. וּבָאַחֲרוֹנָה אוֹכֵל מִבְּשַׂר הַפֶּסַח אֲפִלּוּ כְּזַיִת וְאֵינוֹ טוֹעֵם אַחֲרָיו כְּלָל. וּבַזְּמַן הַזֶּה אוֹכֵל כְּזַיִת מַצָּה וְאֵינוֹ טוֹעֵם אַחֲרֶיהָ כְּלוּם. כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּהְיֶה הֶפְסֵק סְעֻדָּתוֹ וְטַעַם בְּשַׂר הַפֶּסַח אוֹ הַמַּצָּה בְּפִיו שֶׁאֲכִילָתָן הִיא הַמִּצְוָה: </p>\n  \n  <p>Afterwards, he drags out the meal and eats whatever he wants to eat and drinks whatever he wants to drink. At the end, he eats from the meat of the Pesach, even a Kezayis, and he doesn’t taste anything after it. Nowadays, he eats a Kezayis of Matzah, and he doesn’t taste anything after it. This is so that there be a distinction from the meal, as the taste of the meat of the Pesach or the Matzah in his mouth that he ate them is the Mitzvah. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In summary, then, the Rambam holds that the following are mandatory:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Kadeish</li>\n<li>Urchatz and Karpas, or some equivalent so that the children will ask</li>\n<li>Maggid\n\n<ul>\n<li>Mah Nishtanah or some equivalent for questions</li>\n<li>Avadim Hayinu</li>\n<li>Mitechilah</li>\n<li>Arami Oved Avi; not necessarily the Sifra, as we do, but at least some exposition on it, the longer, the better. The ten plagues are included in our exposition on Arami Oved Avi, as an explanation of the final verse in the passage. </li>\n<li>Pesach, Matzah, and Marror</li>\n<li>Not necessarily B’chol dor v’Dor, but certainly the spirit of it</li>\n<li>The second cup and its Berachos</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Rachtzah and Motzi Matzah</li>\n<li>Marror</li>\n<li>Maybe Korech?</li>\n<li>Shulchan Orech</li>\n<li>Tzafun</li>\n<li>Barech\n\n<ul>\n<li>Third cup</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Hallel\n\n<ul>\n<li>Fourth cup</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The Rambam does quote Ha Lachma Anya, the story in Bnei Brak, the four sons, and the passage of B’chol dor v’Dor in his text of Maggid; however, as per the above, these are not obligatory. Further, Yachatz, Nirtzah, hiding the Afikoman, and Dayeinu are not discussed at all in these sections.</p>\n\n\n",

There's way too much to source directly, but I'll try to point to a couple things. </p>\n\n<p>The source for Chovel (recently came up in a Daf Yomi Shiur for Kesuvos 32) is derived from the possuk that ossurs a shaliach beis din from adding to the malkus. Chazal point out that Beis Din is given the authority to wound only so far, and that <strong><em>if a shaliach commits an aveirah even by going over the permitted number of malkot, then everyone NOT approved by Beis Din is certainly forbidden from intentionally injuring another person.</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>Primary sources: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14274&st=&pgnum=101\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Khovel u-Mazik</a></li>\n<li><p>Tur and Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat chapters 420-424 - <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=45449&st=&pgnum=832\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chovel Bechaveiro</a></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>A person may not volunteer to be injured - Beis Din does not consider a waiver of rights against intentional personal injury to be valid. (Maimonides, Mishneh Torah, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14274&st=&pgnum=113\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilchot Khovel u-Mazik ch.5:11</a>)</li>\n<li>Even slapping without any actual injury is liable to prosecution. This is specifically discussed and falls under the category of boshet, for which there is botha sliding scale (based upon the people involved in the offense) and set penalties (given for specific actions - slapping, boxing ears, uncovering a womans hair in public, etc.). <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14274&st=&pgnum=108&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Khu\"M ch.3:8-end</a></li>\n<li>Permission to hit a minor child by a parent or teacher only extends for the purposes of educational discipline. As mentioned elsewhere on these forums, slapping a child (particularly an older one) is considered to fall under the category of Lifnei Eiver lo Titen Michshol, as the child is likely to be provoked into retaliation (which would be a serious Torah offense - Moed Katan 17a). <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14274&st=&pgnum=111\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam Khu\"M 4:19</a> says that a parent is obligated to reimburse any injury TO THEIR OWN CHILD, whether they are adults (paid immediately) or children (invested in property until they become adults).</li>\n</ol></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>BONUS: As mentioned in 1, Torah law does not recognize a voluntary waiver against personal injury. This means that boxing a fellow Jew is absolutely forbidden. (Fun Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?aid=15559&showrashi=true&p=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">parshas shemos</a> 2:14 - Dathan and Aviram were called risha'im merely for lifting their hands to strike! Sanhedrin 58b) However, their is a question about whether wounding a non-Jew is prosecutable to the same extent as a Jew. The possibility exists that such a waiver, for a non-Jew, might be binding, making it permitted to hit him. He would still be held liable for hitting you, however, since your corresponding waiver would be invalid. Mipnei darchei shalom, we tend to treat non-Jews and Jews in the public domin identically. </p>\n\n<p>As @user6591 hinted at, there IS an exception written into halacha regarding <strong><em>accidental personal injury</em></strong> in specific circumstances where we expect the individual to be \"out of his mind\" - injury by a drunkard on Purim is the big one here. But that doesn't provide an exemption for proactively entering into a fight with a clear mind and the express intent to injure another person.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal would likely not condone the Jewish boxer/MMA fighter, especially since it's a dangerous sport where you subject yourself directly to injury - a violation of Vinishmartem Me'od Linafshoseichem. <a href=\"http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/muhammad-ali-to-yuri-foreman-does-jewish-law-allow-boxing/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This piece</a> has a decent treatment of it.</p>\n\n<p>To answer @msh210's objection: The Rambam's psak regarding providing a waiver is quoting the psak in the mishna at the end of the 8th perek in Bava Kama. Rabbi Akiva in a previous mishna in that same perek (where the psak is like him) brings this point up to prove that a \"Chovel be'atzmo\" is still chayiv for damaging himself, <strong><em>even though</em></strong> there is no payment of any of the five forms of nezek. Kal VeChomer someone damaging another \"with permission\" is still considered assur.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do people who don't eat gebrokts have any reason to say \"Borei Minei Mezonot\" during Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This may sound like a trivial question, but I'm curious.</p>\n\n<p>Many Chasidim do not eat <em>gebrokts</em> during Pesach. So all the Pesach cakes are made from potato starch which makes them <em>shehakol</em>. And they only eat shmurah matzah which is <em>hamotzi</em>. Is there anything during the week of Pesach that they can make the bracha <em>borei min mezonot</em> on?</p>\n\n<p>Someone in my neighborhood wants to make <em>Se'udah shlishit</em> on Shabbos during Pesach in shul to accommodate Chasidim. He doesn't want to bring matzot because it requires washing, and the shul kitchen is closed so there's really no convenient sink to wash. (He is averse to using the rest room sink.) He also insists that there be <em>mezonot</em> at <em>Se'udah Shlishit</em>. What can he use to accommodate the Chasidim?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Edit based on comments</strong></p>\n\n<p>Let's assume that the Chasidim do not eat any kitniyot either in whole form or as a processed product. So, that would exclude rice cakes / matzot.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>(<a href=\"/a/56521\">Rice-flour <em>matza</em> should work</a> — but I don't know of any on the market. I suppose you can make some. Consult your rabbi before attempting it.</p>\n\n<p>Beyond that, and more practically speaking,) I can assure you from personal experience that those who don't eat <em>gebrochts</em> or <em>kitniyos</em> or egg <em>matza</em> will never say \"<em>m'zonos</em>\" on the first seven days of <em>Pesach</em>. (Afaik everyone eats, and certainly the widespread custom among non-<em>gebrochts</em>-eaters is to eat, <em>gebrochts</em> on the eighth day of <em>Pesach</em> outside of Israel.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>My advice for <em>Shalosh seudos</em> is to eat dates or drink wine less than 3 <em>reviis</em> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.208.17?lang=bi&p2=Biur_Halacha.208.17.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see biur halacha</a>) since the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.208.17?lang=bi&with=Beur%20HaGra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 208,17</a> says they are filling and one would be <em>Yotzei</em> sayng <em>Birkas hazon</em> on them since they satisfy the the eater (though of course the chassidim should say <em>Me'ein Shalosh</em> after). According to the Rambam (see Kesef mishne hilchos brochos 1,2), the Bahag , the Rosh ,Rashba and Tur  hold that Birkas me'ein Shalosh is  <em>min haTorah</em> when satiated (to the exclusion of the Smag and Rabeinu Yonah hold Me'ein shalosh is derabanan) . So this can partially fulfill the questioners requirement of having \"Mezonos,\" i.e satisfying food. Ths is why if one said brocho of Mezonos on dates or wine (only a small by mistake its not Levatolo).</p>\n\n<p>Alternatively if nothing else available just use regular fruit for <em>shalosh seudos</em> <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%90_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim and Rema 291,5</a></p>\n\n<p>If the chasidim are unwell or old they can eat <em>Matza Ashira</em> and make mezonos (Rema 462,4) in spite of their Minhag.<br>\nThe Darkei Moshe Orach Chaim 453,2 brings the opinion Maharil, (so paskens the Minchas Yitzchok(III:138:2),Avnei Nezer (373 & 533) and Maharsham (I:183) ) that derivatives of <em>Kitniot</em> are prohibited to eat  so if the oil is prohibited how much more so the rice cakes themselves even though they are baked under 18 minutes they are prohibited on Pesach for ashkenazim like the questioner pointed out. Though if Chasidim are unwell (e.g celiac), eating <em>kitniot</em> Hechshered rice cakes would be permitted and they can say Mezonos specifically on the rice products(S.A O.C 453,1 in the Mishna Brura).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Anything that falls into pas ha ba bekisnin will be mezonot if eaten less than a kvius seuda.  See Shulchan Aruk 168.</p>\n\n<p>The Mishna Brerura 168/59 discusses products made from flour that was made from bread.  That is you make flour and water bread or matza, and then make them back into a flour.  That would be matza meal.  You then use this flour and mix it with fruit juice (not water), dont bake it but cook it otherwise, and the item produced does not look like bread (tor lechem) the bracha according to all except the Magen Avraham would be mezonot.  See the Piskei Teshuvot 168/17 for further discussion, and other ways to make a mezonot with matza meal.</p>\n\n<p>So a cake made with matzo meal and a majority of oil or honey even baked is mazonot (end of Mishna Berura 168/59)</p>\n\n<p>EDIT - Define Gebrochts</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/57139/cream-cheese-on-matza-gebrochts#answer-57147\">This answer</a> on stackexchange gives a good run down of why gebrochts is water only.  I would add below 463/2 of The Shulchan Aruk Ha Rav  that only water is the issue:\n שולחן ערוך הרב אורח חיים סימן תסג סעיף ב</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>השבלים או החטים עצמן שנקלו\n  בתנור או באור אם טחנן לא יבשל הקמח שלהם במים שמא לא נקלו באור יפה\n  ויבואו לידי חימוץ בתוך המים קודם שיספיקו להתבשל שם ואפילו אם הקמח עצמו\n  נקלה בתנור לא יבשלנו במים שמא לא נקלה יפה (ויבא לידי חימוץ) ויש מתירין\n  לבשל קמח הקלוי לפי שחום האור שולט בו יותר ממה ששולט בהחטים ויש לסמוך\n  על דבריהם בדיעבד שאם עבר ועשה ממנו תבשיל יש להתירו בהנאה או להשהותו עד\n  לאחר הפסח:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Even if there are other people who wont have any liquids, chabad, or a large portion of chabad would qualify for chasidim who do not eat gebrokts yet have a case where they would make a mezonot, thus answering the question.  The question is not are there people who will not make mezonot.  </p>\n\n<p>Is Honey a problem of liquid for gebrokts?  The MB says cooked in honey.</p>\n\n<p>But aside from that, find some non liquid binder on <a href=\"https://cooking.stackexchange.com/\">Seasoned Advice</a> and you wont have the issue of liquids.  Some type of recipe like 1/3 matza meal, 1/3 ground almonds, 1/3 potato starch would get the beracha of mezonot for everyone?   </p>\n\n\n",

Why is this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The question revolves around of whether or not a woman may be appointed to a positions of power or lordship, known as Serarah in Hebrew. This is based off the Rambam's opinion (Melachim 1:5)</p>\n\n<h2>אין מעמידין אשה במלכות שנאמר עליך מלך ולא מלכה. וכן כל משימות שבישראל אין ממנים בהם אלא איש</h2>\n\n<p>“So too all leadership appointments…we do not appoint them (woman) except from the men”.</p>\n\n<p>This is the Rambam’s position (as well as the Ritva's in Shevuos 30a).</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstien in Iggeros Moshe (Y.D., II, sec. 44) was asked this very question ie. If a woman could be a mashgicha, and after discussing the issue and the opinion of the Rambam at length. He goes on to note that the Rambam is not the only view, and demonstrates that there are a whole series of Rishonim who disagree with the Rambam and are lenient. He says that in a dire situation where we are dealing with a woman’s livelihood, certainly these other opinions could be relied on so that she could continue to be a mashgicha for kashrus. In other words, he maintains that the Rambam opinion is lechatchila, and we would generally prefer to be stringent and rule like the Rambam. However, since this shaas hadchak, and there are major authorities- including, Ramban, Rashba, Ran, and Rabbeinu Tam – who disagree with the Rambam, we can rely on these other sources to give us the flexibility to allow this woman to be a mashgichas kashrus.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, my mother worked as a mashgicha for the Star-k under Rav Moshe Heinemann for many years. Seemingly he held there was no issue. And to the best of my knowledge we were not in a dire situation (maybe my mom never told us :) </p>\n\n<p>However, none of this can be taken as a halachic psak for any personal circumstance.</p>\n\n<p>For further reading see here: <a href=\"http://text.rcarabbis.org/women-in-communal-leadership-positions-shul-presidents-by-aryeh-frimer/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://text.rcarabbis.org/women-in-communal-leadership-positions-shul-presidents-by-aryeh-frimer/</a></p>\n\n\n",

In that answer, I state that I have known people who are known by the name of the adoptive father.</p>\n\n<p>Given the general case, we can see from the other answers to this topic, that the Jewish father and the nonJewish son have <strong>no</strong> halachic connection whatsoever. The answer as far as aperson who converts to Judaism and is adopted by a Jew is the same no matter who the adoptive father may be. In any case, as explained in the other answers, a person can take the name of his adoptive father.</p>\n\n<p>The only difference that would occur, is that if the adoptive father is a Levi (as an example from an actual case) then he is <strong>not</strong> called with the term \"Levi\" in the name because he is a yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>As an example if the adopted son is named Moshe and his adoptive father is Shmuel HaLevi (made up names) the he would be called to the Torah as Moshe ben Shmuel. </p>\n\n<p>In the case of the question, it would depend if the boy had converted and became part of the family of the biological father or not. In that case, it would be like an adoption. Otherwise it might be considered an embarrassment for the father to have his name used. If both parties consider it an honor, then it is acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting point is found in masecta Yevamos 101B (Art Scroll 101B4 bottom of the page) in which Rav Shmuel Ben Yehudah explains that he is a ger. Thus we see that even as far back as the gemara a ger could use the name of someone else as the patronymic.</p>\n\n<p>Beit Yosef, Even HaEzer 129:20, quoting Moses ben Isaac</p>\n\n<p>מצאתי שצריך שיכתוב בלשון דלישתמע מיניה שהוא גר כגון שיכתוב הגר או בן אבינו אברהם ―</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I found that one needs to write in language that implies that the\n  person is a convert, for example write ―hager, the convert, <strong>or</strong> son\n  of Avraham Avinu</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(emphasis added).

    "content": "# Why do the first born fast on erev Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the logic behind the first born fasting on erev Pesach?  Is it a form of celebration?  If so, would not a feast be better?  Is it a form of teshuva?  If so, for what sin?  Is it a form of thanks?  If so, by what logic is a fast a form of thanks?  Also, why is the fast limited to the first born?  None of us alive today were personally passed over. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I spent a while researching this along with some similar questions. Here's what I came up with:</p>\n\n<p>The vast majority of Rishonim (A notable exception is the Rambam who doesn’t quote this Halacha),  including the Tur and Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 470:1), Pasken based on Meseches Sofrim (21:3) [That is the primary source. However, some Rishonim such as the Mordechai (Pesachim 610) and the Orchos Chaim (Chelek Aleph Din Arvei Pesachim Veshaar Yamim Tovim os 13) quote Yerushalmi Pesachim 10:1 as the source. A discussion as to whether or not this is a valid source is beyond the scope of this discussion. See Rosh Pesachim 10:19 with Kobran Nesanel (ad loc. os Samech and os Ayin), Birkei Yosef (Orach Chaim 470:1), and Sefer Taanis Bechorim (pg. 4-11).] that firstborns should fast on Erev Pesach.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur (ibid.) explains that the reason for the fast is to commemorate the fact that the Jewish firstborns were saved by makkas bechoros. This is a strange thing to need to commemorate. The makkos simply did not apply to us. We did not need to commemorate that the Jews were able to drink water while all the Egyptians drank blood by makkas dam, that the wild animals didn’t enter Goshen by makkas arov (Shemos 8:18), that not one animal belonging to a Jew dies by makkas dever (Shemos 9:6), that the hail didn’t enter Goshen by makkas barad (Shemos 9:26), or that all of the Jews had light by makkas choshech (Shemos 10:23). Why should the firstborn Jews have died? The Jews weren’t affected by any of the other plagues! (Many Jews died by makkas choshech, but they weren’t affected by the plague of darkness itself. Hashem merely used the cover of darkness to remove them without the Egyptians being aware that Jews were dying left and right.) </p>\n\n<p>The Orchos Chaim (Chelek Aleph; Din Arvei Pesachim Veshaar Yamim Tovim; os 13) writes that the reason why the firstborns were specifically targeted by makkas bechoros is because they were the priests for the avodah zarah there. Based on this, the Orchos Chaim points out that it is likely that among the Jews, many of which were idol-worshippers as well, many firstborns would have been priests for avodah zarah (See Yechezkel 20:7 [as explained by many commentators] and Shemos Rabbah 21:7). If so, since this was primarily an attack on those that were the priests for avodah zarah, the Jewish firstborns should have been killed were it not for Hashem’s mercy.</p>\n\n<p>However, the explanation that Taanis Bechorim commemorates the salvation of the firstborns remains troubling. We don’t generally commemorate being saved by fasting. Generally, when we are saved, we commemorate that by eating. As Alan King said, “A summary of every Jewish holiday: They tried to kill us, we won, let’s eat!” Shouldn’t firstborns be celebrating their salvation through feasting, as opposed to mourning it through fasting?</p>\n\n<p>To make matters worse, the Midrash Rabbah writes (Shemos Rabbah 19:7) that we do not mourn the suffering we had in Egypt. This is comparable to a king who married a woman from across the sea. On her way to the king her boat was rocked by terrible waves for days making her fear for her life, but in the end she survived. When she finally reached the king and informed him what had happened to her on the way the king told her “I don’t want you to commemorate all the suffering you experienced getting here. Instead, I want you to remember the day that you were saved and make it a day of celebration every year.” This is understandable. Nobody wants to start off their marriage with the wife focusing on how miserable her journey to the wedding was. That would make the whole marriage start off on the wrong foot. Hashem, as well, did not institute any days of mourning to commemorate the terrible suffering we experienced in Egypt. [We do eat marror and recount the bad times we had (maschil begenus umesayem beshevach), but the goal is not to mourn the suffering we endured under the hands of the Egyptians but rather the goal is to help us appreciate our miraculous salvation.]  We only celebrate the salvation. If so, why do we fast to commemorate what the bechorim went through?</p>\n\n<p>Based on the strength of these questions, some, such as the <a href=\"https://pasteboard.co/J1ZDnmn.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Pe’er Yitzchak (25:4)</a>, have suggested that the entire concept of Taanis Bechorim is based on a ta’os sofer (The letter Gimmel from the word \"מתענגים\" got left out and turned into \"מתענים\") and indeed, the author brings a number Gedolim who were firstborns did not bother fasting or even attending a siyum or other seudas mitzvah because they too felt it was a ta’os sofer. However, being that virtually all major Halachic works over the last thousand years have felt that Taanis Bechorim is halacha lemaisa it behooves us to understand what the purpose of it could possibly be.</p>\n\n<p>Shu”t Lecha Shlomo suggests that generally we don’t fast to commemorate various tribulations we were saved from because we ourselves did mitzvos or teshuva and merited to be saved. However, by yetzias Mitzraim we were utterly bereft of Mitzvos and it was only because Hashem graciously gave us the Mitzvos of dam Pesach (the blood of which was placed on the lintel and doorposts) and dam Milah that we were able to be saved. Therefore, Chazal instituted that firstborns should fast in order to diminish their fat and blood as a reminder that their blood should have been spilled.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can suggest in a similar vein that we don’t generally need to mourn the terrible things that happened to us that we were saved from because the purpose of all the fast days that we mourn nowadays is as the Rambam (Hilchos Taanis 5:1) writes “יש שם ימים שכל ישראל מתענים בהם מפני הצרות שארעו בהן כדי לעורר הלבבות לפתח דרכי התשובה ויהיה זה זכרון למעשינו הרעים ומעשה אבותינו שהיה כמעשינו עתה עד שגרם להם ולנו אותן הצרות. שבזכרון דברים אלו נשוב להיטיב שנאמר (ויקרא כו, מ) \"והתודו את עונם ואת עון אבתם\" וגו'.” The purpose of a fast day is to remember the ways our ancestors suffered for their misdeeds which they did not correct and we ourselves are following in their footsteps and sinning.</p>\n\n<p>If our ancestors had dealt with the problem head on by doing Teshuva, there would be no need to mourn this day. However, by makkas bechoros our ancestors never dealt with the problem by doing teshuva. As the Orchos Chaim said, the firstborns deserved to die for worshipping avodah zarah, and even when we came to the sea before krias Yam Suf the sea was not going to split for us because we were idolaters (Shemos Rabbah 21:7). Indeed, even after Matan Torah the firstborns still struggled with avodah zarah and were the first ones who sinned by the Golden Calf (Yerushalmi Megillah 1:11). Thus, since the entire salvation happened without the firstborns ever fully repenting for their sins it remains a day of mourning, although since the firstborns were not actually killed out of Hashem’s mercy, we don’t remember the tragedy but rather that the firstborns were miraculously saved from receiving the fate they deserved and therefore Taanis Bechorim is not treated with the same stringency as other fast days.</p>\n\n<p>There are also several other reasons for Taanis Bechorim that circumvent the entire issue of why firstborns fast to commemorate the miracle of their salvation altogether by providing other reasons why firstborns fast:</p>\n\n<p>The Chassam Sofer (Pesachim 108a d”h “kol maali yoma depischa”) suggests that Taanis Bechorim is similar to Taanis Esther. The same way that on Taanis Esther the Jews fasted as a merit that they should not be killed in battle so too the firstborns fasted on Erev Pesach as a merit that they should not be killed for their sins, and nowadays we do the same to commemorate that. The Chassam Sofer adds that it is likely that fathers fasted on behalf of their firstborn sons who were ketanim to ensure that they wouldn’t die for their father’s sins which is why nowadays as well fathers fast on behalf of their firstborns under bar mitzvah.</p>\n\n<p>In the journal Otzar Hachaim (5691 pages 96-99) another reason is suggested by Rav Ehrenreich. At the point that Hashem slaughtered all the firstborns in Egypt He sanctified all of the Jewish firstborns (Shemos 13:2, Bamidbar 3:13 and 8:17) and made them the Kohanim (Shemos 19:22 and 24:5 with Rashi). However, when they sinned by the chet ha’egel the bechorim lost their right to be the priests and that right was given to Shevet Levi (Bamidbar Rabbah 3:3, 3:10, and 4:8). Therefore, the bechorim fast to demonstrate their sorrow over the loss of their incredible opportunity to serve Hashem as Kohanim. It is also possible that this is what the Tur meant when he said that the fast is to commemorate the fact that the bechorim were saved. They are remembering the fact that they were saved by Hashem by way of Hashem sanctifying them which they subsequently lost.</p>\n\n<p>This explanation also explains why, unlike all the other fasts, if one attends a siyum they no longer need to fast. Even though the firstborns are no longer capable of bringing the korbanos, learning Torah is equivalent or perhaps even greater than bringing korbanos (Sifri Devarim 41, Menachos 110a, Avos D’Rebbi Nassan 4:1). Through making or even attending a Siyum the bechorim are showing that despite having lost their incredible opportunity to serve Hashem through bringing korbanos they can still serve Hashem on at least the same level through learning Hashem’s Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (Pa’amei Kol Torah, cited in Sefer Taanis Bechorim page 22) points out that claiming that the reason for Taanis Bechorim is to remember that the firstborns were saved by makkas bechoros is difficult because makkas bechoros did not happen on the 14th of Nissan, it happened on the 15th. The reason we commemorate it on the 14th cannot merely be because the 15th is Yom Tov so they moved it to the 14th. If that were the case the fast should have been moved to the 13th since the 14th of Nissan is also somewhat of a Yom Tov, as it is Erev Yom Tov and the day that the Korban Pesach was brought. There are even restrictions against doing various forms of melachah on the 14th.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the same way we see that when Purim is on Sunday, Taanis Esther is moved back to Thursday, as opposed to Friday (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 686:2) and when Erev Pesach falls out on Shabbos, Taanis Bechorim is shifted back to Thursday as well (470:2). The Aruch Hashulchan (470:4) Mishna Berura (470:6) explain that the reason Taanis Bechorim is shifted back to Thursday instead of Friday is because since its anyway not in the proper time it is preferable to distance it from Shabbos so that the bechorim do not enter into Shabbos while fasting. Based on that, if Erev Pesach were not the real time for the fast it would seem inappropriate to reschedule the fast to Erev Pesach thereby causing the bechorim to enter into Pesach while fasting.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, if Taanis Bechorim was really because the bechorim were saved it should be the descendants of those bechorim who fast, not other bechorim who were descended from people who weren’t bechorim at the time of makkas bechoros. Future bechorim wouldn’t have been affected by the fact that the bechorim were spared unless their ancestors were bechorim at the time of makkas bechoros, so why are they the ones who fast?</p>\n\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman therefore suggests that the reason for Taanis Bechorim is actually because when the bechorim came along with the rest of Klal Yisrael to bring their korban Pesach on Erev Pesach they were incredibly pained, depressed, and embarrassed about the fact that they lost their opportunity to be ones performing the avodah in the Beis Hamikdash and instead had to merely watch as the Kohanim did the avodah in their place. This was especially difficult for them because the korban Pesach that they were bringing actually celebrates the very moment that they became sanctified. Because of the bechorim’s incredible pain and sadness they did not eat or drink at all that day, and they instituted it as a day of mourning for all those who would have been the ones doing avoda as well.</p>\n\n<p>(The reasons of Rav Shlomo Zalman and Rav Ehrenreich both do not explain why firstborn Kohanim and Leviyim fast. They are still doing avodah in the Beis Hamikdash. Furthermore, these explanations do not explain why boys who are firstborns only from their father fast, as they were not sanctified by makkas bechoros (this is why they do not need pidyon haben). It is likely that these reasons are not intended to be the only reasons but rather complimentary reasons. See Sefer Taanis Bechorim (5:1) for more on why it is not just the bechorim from the mother that fast.)  </p>\n\n<p>Perhaps we can weave elements from several of these reasons together to form another beautiful explanation for Taanis Bechorim. Chazal tell us (Rosh Hashana 11a) that the same way we were redeemed in Nissan we will be redeemed again in Nissan at the end of our current exile. [See Drashos HaRan (end of Drush 3) that we pasken that we will be redeemed in Nissan like Rebbi Yehoshua says and not in Tishrei as Rebbi Eliezer says.]  Yalkut Shimoni (Shemos 12:42 and Yeshaya Remez 436) and Rashi (Eruchin 11b d”h “zechus”) imply that this means that we will be redeemed on the exact same dates as our original redemption from Egypt. When we are redeemed and the Beis Hamikdash is rebuilt the service in the Beis Hamikdash will be restored to the firstborns (Ohr Hachaim [Bereishis 49:28 d”h “asher diber” and Bamidbar 3:45 d”h “vihayu li”], Tikkunim Chadashim of the Ramchal [54], and Ahavas Yehonasan [Haftaras Emor]).</p>\n\n<p>However, although the redemption culminates on Seder night, it doesn’t start then. Throughout Erev Pesach we begin experiencing the redemption of Pesach. Chametz starts to become forbidden to us, we become forbidden to do serious melachah that is not for Pesach purposes (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 468:1-3), and this is the time that we would bring the korban Pesach should the Beis Hamikdash be rebuilt. Furthermore, in Egypt the effects of makkas bechoros started before Pesach with the firstborns waging war against their fathers (Midrash Aggada Shemos 11:5, Midrash Tanchumah [Buber] Bo 18, Midrash Tehillim 136, Yalkut Shimoni Tehillim 136, Pesikta Rabsi 17). (See also Zohar Pinchas 249a that Hashem’s throne will become complete on Erev Pesach with the wiping out of Amalek.)  Thus, this is a very opportune moment for the firstborns to remember the way they had been entirely spared in Egypt many years earlier by way of being taken into the service of Hashem and they fast that day in the zechus that the Beis Hamikdash should be rebuilt and they should be worthy to be the ones doing the avodah and bringing the korban Pesach on this day in the Beis Hamikdash just as they had been many years earlier.</p>\n\n<p>[See Sefer Taanis Bechorim (page 23) for more reasons for Taanis Bechorim.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_of_the_Firstborn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>, which also lists sources, states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The origins of the Fast of the Firstborn are found in the Talmud, and\n  the custom may have existed even prior to Talmudic times.

He then (in Section 140) lists examples where the <em>kamats</em> became mutable, again not listing our example דָת.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, although it is impossible to make a definitive conclusion from <em>Shadal</em> about דָת, since it is conspicuously absent from both sides of the discussion, one could argue (especially based on the evidence in our text of <em>Tanakh</em>) that he would include the <em>kamats</em> in דָת among the immutable <em>kamats</em> (of which his list includes the words \"for example\"), and thus carrying over to the construct form and plural.  If this is indeed the case, then ArtScroll is incorrect<sup>1</sup>, and the correct pointing would always be with a <em>kamats</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> On the other hand, the exact language of הרי את does <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37973/4940\">not</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/68185/4940\">seem</a> to be a required part of <em>kiddushin</em>.  Thus, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/68185/4940\">any language</a> that implies <em>kiddushin</em> is acceptable.  Since דַת with a <em>patach</em> is correct in modern Hebrew (according to <em>Even Shoshan</em>), it might not be incorrect to use modern Hebrew, and hence this formulation, nowadays in effecting <em>kiddushin</em>.</p>\n\n<p><sup>2</sup> We can see from the <em>Prolegomena</em> that <em>Shadal</em> posits correct pronunciation based on his discussion for words in common parlance (like שְׁטָרֵי and כְּתָבֵי), not just Biblical pointing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I just took a look at some mishnah manuscripts from Argon's links in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/104366/11532\">this answer</a>.

The first version published in Benei Brak in 2002 contains one volume. Siman 135 Anaf 6 in this volume is indeed the one about shaking hands with women.</p>\n<p>The second version published in Jerusalem in 2008 contains four volumes – one each for Orach Chaim, Yoreh Deiah, Even HaEzer, and Choshen Mishpat. R. Chaim Belin wrote several responsa to a certain Shabtai Baruch. One of these contains the section you are looking for, but the respona, and their component parts, are arranged differently in the two versions. Below is a table that I have compiled showing the breakdown of the three responsa to Shabtai Baruch in the original version, and the corresponding locations of each section in the new version. As you can see, there are quite a few rearrangements in the new version. Some of these rearrangements required subtle changes in order to make them understandable (e.g. adding a couple of words of opening context that was obvious in the original version because of the section immediately preceding it that does not immediately preceed it in the new version). This apparently also led to some strange numbering arrangements in the new version, as for example Yoreh Deiah Siman 141 which begins with Anaf 11 with no indication as to what ten sections it is following.</p>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\">\n<table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Topic</th>\n<th>Benei Brak 2002</th>\n<th>Jerusalem 2008</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Minyan 1</td>\n<td>7:1</td>\n<td>Even HaEzer 3:4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Minyan 2</td>\n<td>7:2</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:17/18</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bein Hashemashot</td>\n<td>7:3</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 143:6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Work Agreement</td>\n<td>7:4</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 143:7</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/2997/what-should-a-chazan-do-if-he-has-theological-problems-with-the-congregations-t/93577#93577\">Praying with Chasidim/Nusach</a></td>\n<td>7:5</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 143:9</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Moving to California</td>\n<td>7:6</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Singing</td>\n<td>7:7</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:16</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mikvah 1</td>\n<td>106:1</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:11/143:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mikvah 2</td>\n<td>106:2</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 143:2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Gentile Believability</td>\n<td>106:3</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:12/143:2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oaths</td>\n<td>106:4</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:13/143:4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cursing Sinners</td>\n<td>106:5</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 141:14</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sha'atnez</td>\n<td>106:6</td>\n<td>Even HaEzer 3:5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wife and Kids</td>\n<td>135:1</td>\n<td>Even HaEzer 3:1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mesader Kiddushin</td>\n<td>135:2</td>\n<td>Even HaEzer 3:2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Women's Believability</td>\n<td>135:3</td>\n<td>Even HaEzer 3:3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1807/double-head-covering-for-women/97140#97140\">Women's Head Covering</a></td>\n<td>135:4</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 143:5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Conversing with Women</td>\n<td>135:5</td>\n<td>Yoreh Deiah 143:8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Handshaking with Women</strong></td>\n<td><strong>135:6</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Yoreh Deiah 141:19</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Shechitah</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Even HaEzer 3:6</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n\n",

One reason is based on the idea\n  that the recital of the shirah by Moshe and Bnei Yisroel was\n  comparable to the recital of Hallel (Mishnah Sotah 27b). The halacha\n  is that Hallel is to be said standing (Shulchan Aruch 422:7), because\n  one is testifying to the fact that Hashem did miracles for us, and\n  testimony must be said while standing. Therefore, the custom is to\n  stand during the shirah, and <strong>perhaps this is also the reason why\n  some people stand for Az Yashir during pesukei d’zimra</strong> (Kitzur\n  Shulchan Aruch 14:4; Badei HaShulchan ibid.). Another reason for\n  standing during the shirah is based on the Zohar (Lech-Lecha 81b)\n  which says that Dovid HaMelech merited to be the ancestor of Moshiach\n  because he stood up in order to say shirah, as it says (Tehillim\n  119:62), “I will arise to praise You” (Siddur Tzelosa d’Avraham, pg.\n  168).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I've seen varying practices, including a rise-an-inch-from-the-seat-fake-stand.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Depends on your minhag. Some hold that since its a davar shbekedusha you must stand. The Mishna Berurah(146:18) says that even if you wont stand for the krias hatorah in accordance with the opinion of the Maharam M'Rottenberg (quoted by the Rema 146:4) still you must at least stand for borchu for everyone holds you must stand.</p>\n\n<p>The Rama M'pano says the obligation to stand is so much that really one must stand even for the Kria in order not to mistakingly sit during borchu </p>\n\n<h2>ולא זע בשעת ברכה משתלי ויתיב גם בשעת ברכו, ועיניך רואות היושבים בשעת קריאת התורה שהן אחד מהם לא קם כדאמרינן טעמא בגמ' מפני הנכנסים והיוצאים, לדברי הכל טוב ויפה לעמוד כל זמן הקריאה דלמא אבל עכשיו שהרבים העולים כלם אומרים ברכו\". –</h2>\n\n<p>Rav Eliezer Melamed <a href=\"http://ph.yhb.org.il/en/03-16-03/\" rel=\"nofollow\">writes</a>:</p>\n\n<p>After the Kaddish,the chazan says, “Barchu et Hashem hamevorach” (“Bless Hashem Who is blessed”). The congregation responds, “Baruch Hashem hamevorach l’olam va’ed” (“Blessed is Hashem, Who is blessed for all eternity”), and the chazan repeats the congregation’s line, saying, “Baruch Hashem hamevorach l’olam va’ed” (Shulchan Aruch 57:1).</p>\n\n<p>The primary purpose of Barchu is to introduce Birkot Keriat Shema,for by declaring “Barchu,” the chazan invites the congregation to recite Birkot Keriat Shema. Even though it can also be recited as praise in itself, like when Barchu is recited at the conclusion of the prayer service, nevertheless, the essence of its establishment was to introduce Birkot Keriat Shema. Therefore, every person must finish saying Pesukei d’Zimrah and Yishtabach before Barchu so that immediately after Barchu he can begin Birkot Keriat Shema. It is best to even skip Az Yashir in order to start Birkot Keriat Shema with the congregation. Still, whoever did not yet succeed in saying the berachah of Yishtabach,even if he already responded to Barchu,must conclude Yishtabach and only afterwards continue with Birkot Keriat Shema.</p>\n\n<p>There are varying customs with regard to standing when responding to Kaddish and Barchu. According to the minhag of most Sephardim,there is no need to stand up while answering matters of sanctity, but one who is already standing must remain that way for Kaddish and Barchu (Maharil,Kaf HaChaim 56:20; 146:20-21; Yechaveh Da’at 3:4). Most Ashkenazim are accustomed to standing while responding to Kaddish and Barchu which are matters of sanctity (Mishnah Berurah 54:7-8; 146:18). However, concerning Barchu which requires a short answer, many Ashkenazim have the custom that if they are already sitting, such as for Torah reading, or before Ma’ariv,they do not completely stand up, rather they only rise slightly from their chairs when responding. This is similar to the custom many people have when answering a zimun with ten men.</p>\n\n<p>When the chazan says the word “Barchu” he bows a bit, and when saying “Hashem” he straightens himself. Regarding the congregation, there are different customs. There are those accustomed to bowing down completely, those who bow slightly, and those who don’t bow at all. Every person should follow his family’s minhag. When people with different minhagim pray together, it is proper that everyone bows slightly (see further in this book chapter 17, note 3).</p>\n\n\n",

This phenomenon occurs in many languages, including English. </p>\n\n<p>An example in English of linguistic “attraction” – a technical grammatical mismatch – is: “Turn left at the street where there is a carwash and a fast food restaurant.” Due to there being two landmarks, the sentence should have a plural verb. But, “there are a carwash” (even with addition of another landmark), grates on the ear. This type of grammatical error is called “attraction,” where verbs or adjectives or even pronouns are so strongly connected to the form of a nearby noun that proximity overtakes the proper \ngrammatical construction. </p>\n\n<p>So, in connection to the few examples of where Elohim (for Israel’s God) is clearly the subject, though used with plural forms of verbs or adjectives, we now can see that this is an instance where linguistic “attraction” has likely occurred. For instance, even though it literally says this in the Hebrew, we know the Hebrew Bible is not saying that “the gods” caused Abraham to wander from his father’s home (Gen. 20:13), “the gods” revealed themselves to Jacob at the place called El Beth El (Gen. 35:7), “the gods” redeemed Israel (2 Sam.7:23), or “the gods” judge the earth so that humankind can be pleased that justice prevails (Ps. 58:11[12]). Rather, we can \nunderstand that we are reading instances in the Hebrew where linguistic “attraction” has occurred.</p>\n\n<p>There are still other instances where certain Hebrew adjectives refer to Israel’s God using plural forms. A potential for confusion develops because these adjectives translate into nouns in English (e.g., Job 35:10; Ps. 149:2; Ecc. 12:1; Is. 54:5). It is difficult to convey the sense of this in English. These are not expressed in verbs or \nnouns, but rather by adjectives in Hebrew. The instances are: Job 35:10, which conveys the idea of God (eloah, singular form) who (are) making humanity (osai, pl. [= plural]); Psalm 149:2, the idea of HaShem who (are) making Israel (osav, pl.); Ecclesiastes 12:1, the idea that we are to remember God (ha-elohim, plural form) who (are) creating us (bor'eikha, pl.); and Isaiah 54:5, the idea that HaShem of hosts (ADONAI ts'vaot[h]), God of the whole earth (elohei khol ha-arets, plural form), who \n(are) mastering/husbanding Jerusalem (boalaikh, pl.), who (are) making her (osaikh, pl.). </p>\n\n<p>When conveyed in this fashion, it is apparent that there are more grammatical \noddities here. Yet, Hebrew language scholars who translate the Hebrew text into English are not caught off guard. They translate these into English in singular forms, knowing there is no mysterious thing happening here. </p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, however, the fact that these adjectives translate into English as nouns – “my makers” (Job 35:10); “his makers” (Ps. 149:2); “your creators” (Ecc. 12:1); “your masters/husbands, your makers” (Is. 54:5) – has opened the door to speculation that these texts are really saying the God of Israel is a mysterious plurality of makers-creators. In reality this continues to be a matter of linguistic “attraction” that has \nbecome an occasion for mistakes to be made by those looking for hidden hints of plurality to the godhead.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems that the Chabad translation is a mistake.  The verse in <em>Job</em> literally says \"my makers\".  Similarly, the verse in <em>Kohelet</em> says \"your (singular) creators\".</p>\n\n<p>However, we do find that God is referred to using the plural, and we understand it as the singular.  For example, most instances of אלהים in <em>Tanakh</em> refer to God, and they take a singular verb (eg. <em>Bereishit</em> 1:1).  Therefore, the standard understanding and translation of these verses are as in JPS translation (as linked in the question).  This can also be seen by reading the commentaries on these verses, which understand a singular referent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/d/Books/JPS-Tanakh-Jewish-Bible-Publication-Society-Inc/0827603665\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">New JPS Translation</a> to Job 35:10 reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But none says, “Where is my God, <strong>my Maker</strong>, Who gives strength in\n  the night</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Both expressions (עשי in Job and בוראיך in Koheles) are a kind of <strong>pluralis majestatis</strong> or <em>\"plurales excellentiae\"</em> (see Gesenius <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesenius%27_Hebrew_Grammar/124._The_Various_Uses_of_the_Plural-form#GHGpar-124-k\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">GKC §124.k</a>). </p>\n\n\n",

So also in the case of the spies who had spread slander (according to Numb. 14:36), “when they returned, they made [the whole congregation] murmur against him.” A decree was issued against them, because they had said (in Numb. 13:31), “We are unable to go up [against this people for they are stronger than us].” <strong>The women, however, were not with them in their counsel.</strong> What is written above the matter (in Numb. 26:65)? “Because the Lord had said to them, ‘They shall surely die in the wilderness,’ not a man of them remained […].” [Note that Scripture speaks of] “a man,” and not of \"a woman.” Because they (i.e., the men) did not want to enter the land, but the women came forward to ask for an inheritance in the land.

This means that causing somebody else\n  emotional pain, by means of verbal, written, or any other form of\n  communication, is a Torah prohibition. This basic prohibition is\n  recorded by the Rambam and by the Shulchan Aruch (Choshen Mishpat\n  228:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My question is: What if a person is overly sensitive about something or even has a particular disorder that makes them upset under certain circumstances, to what extent must I accommodate their feelings?

The fact that a woman cries easier, you must cater that sensitivity and adjust how you speak to that person. Thus, we see the principle that despite someone being very sensitive nonetheless you must take that into account and speak nicer to them.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, we see in the Rambam (Deos 6:10) a need for an extra level of sensitivity. The Rambam writes that it is imperative to be careful of the honor of orphans and widows for they are of lowly spirit and are depressed: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חייב אדם להזהר ביתומים ואלמנות מפני שנפשן שפלה למאד ורוחם נמוכה אע\"פ\n  שהן בעלי ממון אפילו אלמנתו של מלך ויתומיו מוזהרים אנו עליהן שנאמר כל\n  אלמנה ויתום לא תענון והיאך נוהגין עמהן לא ידבר אליהם אלא רכות ולא\n  ינהוג בהן אלא מנהג כבוד ולא יכאיב גופם בעבודה ולבם בדברים קשים ויחוס\n  על ממונם יותר מממון עצמו כל המקניטן או מכעיסן או הכאיב להן או רדה בהן\n  או אבד ממונן הרי זה עובר בלא תעשה וכל שכן המכה אותם או המקללן ולאו זה\n  אף על פי שאין לוקין עליו הרי עונשו מפורש בתורה וחרה אפי והרגתי אתכם\n  בחרב ברית כרת להן מי שאמר והיה העולם שכל זמן שהם צועקים מחמס הם נענים\n  שנאמר כי אם צעק יצעק אלי שמוע אשמע צעקת</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, this extra level of sensitivity only applies in cases where there is no overt need to speak harsher. But, in a case where you must speak \"tougher\" for the persons benefit ie. You are a therapist and are working with that person, or you are their teacher and you must guide them on the right path, the Rambam qualifies the prohibition:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בד\"א בזמן שעינה אותן לצורך עצמו אבל עינה אותם הרב כדי ללמדן תורה או\n  אומנות או להוליכן בדרך ישרה הרי זה מותר ואע\"פ כן לא ינהוג בהן מנהג כל\n  אדם אלא יעשה להם הפרש וינהלם בנחת וברחמים גדולים וכבוד שנאמר כי ה'\n  יריב ריבם אחד יתום מאב אחד יתום מאם ועד אימתי נקראים יתומים לענין זה\n  עד שלא יהיו צריכין לאדם גדול להסמך עליו ולאמנן ולהטפל בהן אלא יהיה\n  עושה כל צרכי עצמו לעצמו כשאר כל הגדולים.</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rav Elchonon Wassermann (Kovetz Ha’aros Yevamos #70) echoes this qualification as well:</p>\n\n<p>\"Similarly, concerning the prohibition of Lashon harah, it is permitted against people who cause discord and quarrels in order to stop the fight. <strong>Similar concerning using words to cause anguish (onas devarim), it is permitted to publicly criticize someone if it is for the sake of chastisement.</strong> It is even permitted to publicly embarrass someone if it is done for the necessity of chastisement for a person who has not stopped his bad behavior after being rebuked in private. In such a case it is even permissible to curse him. In fact, this is what was done by the prophets in the past as the Rambam (Hilchos De’os 6:8) notes. We have thus shown from all this, that all the prohibition involving interpersonal actions does not apply when the act is beneficial.\"</p>\n\n<p>Thus, even for an overly sensitive person if speaking to them harshly will cause them anguish it is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>For more see <a href=\"http://daattorah.blogspot.co.il/2013/09/lashon-harah-is-only-prohibited-when.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>the talmud in ketubot 17 says one should be \"meurov im habriot\" (lit.mixed with others).</p>\n\n<p>Rashi there says to strive to do the will of each and every person.</p>\n\n<p>this implies being sensitive to the individual needs of each person and behave according to how that person wants to be treated.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Are these \"Teachings of the Jewish Talmud\" and does a typical Jew believe this?",
    "content": "# Are these \"Teachings of the Jewish Talmud\" and does a typical Jew believe this?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've come across <a href=\"http://www.christusrex.org/www3/talmud-exposed/talmud.htm#02\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a page that lists quite a few items as \"Some of the teachings of the Talmud\"</a>. They are pretty harsh things and I kind of doubt a reasonable and kind person would believe and follow them, whether Jew or not.</p>\n<p>Starting on that page from the heading:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some Teachings of The Jewish Talmud [This is the heading]</p>\n<p>The Talmud specifically defines all who are not Jews as non-human\nanimals. [This is the first summary]</p>\n<p>[The parts supposedly from the talmud that say this follow.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>it lists many items (way to many to quote all) and they can certainly be construed as anti-Semitic (as the site generally appears to be).</p>\n<p>Are these works generally considered part of the Talmud? Are they accurately represented in the brief summaries? Does a typical Jew believe and follow these things (or should they, I guess)?</p>\n<p>Disclaimer: I'm not even sure what the Talmud is. I know many modern Jews revere it and that it is a collection of Rabbinical works, but that's about it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Absolutely not, none of these \"quotes\" are representative of Talmudic, Rabbinic, or mainstream Jewish belief.</p>\n\n<p>These quotes are either mistranslated or taken completely out of context.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, most major commentators say that most, if not all the references to the idol worshipers in the Talmud do not apply to modern-day Gentiles.</p>\n\n<p>Without a mastery of the <em>original</em> language of the source i.e.. Aramaic and Mishnaic Hebrew, it is impossible to pass judgment on the material at hand, and the nuances involved in the text are only privy to those who have spent a large amount of time and investment in understanding them.</p>\n\n<p>It should be understood as well, that Jewish Law culled from the Talmud is an intricate body of rules, and each rule has its parameters and limits, and with that just like in any respectable set of laws and subset of laws, there will always be technical aspects to it that carries with it dispensations and scenarios that fall outside the bottom line \"obligation\". So too, regarding the \"give and take\"; known in Talmudic parlance as the Shakla V'tarya, of the Talmud when discussing and fleshing out the Law discussed, in order to fully understand the Law at hand in its fullness, full intellectual investigation requires a discussion of scenarios which are not practically feasible, and may even seem beyond the pale of normalcy, and completely impractical, but in order to find and feel out the parameters and boundaries of where the law applies and ends. </p>\n\n<p>This approach is common in any normal university setting (especially Law School). Go into any classroom discussing civil rights and other social issues, and one will hear seemingly wacky discussions and scenarios seriously discussed such as \"whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, and whether that is needed to confer civil rights to animals\" (as suggested by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cass_Sunstein#Animal_rights\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cass Sunstien</a> <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal%20Rights:%20Current%20Debates%20and%20New%20Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> who claimed he does not believe that in a policy sense, but was only discussing it philosophically). These types of theoretical discussions are implicitly accepted as legitimate, for we understand that in the interest of investigation, ideas are tested and taken seriously. So too in the Talmud, in order to fully grasp the parameters of the Law and subject under discussion, ideas are discussed seriously and openly in order to push the discussion for more clarity.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, a large part of these \"quotes\" are not representative of accepted, peer-reviewed and majority ruled Jewish opinion, as some of these comments were cherry picked straight out of the middle of a long detailed discussion.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>a person can take quotes from the bible or the talmud and pretty much fabricate anything he wants.</p>\n\n<p>even if such quotes exist, there are other quotes saying the exact opposite such as the mishna in avot 1</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Akiva used to say: Beloved is the man that he was created in the\n  image of G-d; an extra love is made known to him that he was created\n  in G-d's image, as it says (Genesis 9:6) \"for in His own image G-d\n  made humankind\".  Beloved are the Jews that they are called sons to\n  G-d; an extra love is made known to them that they are called sons to\n  G-d, as it says (Deuteronomy 14:1) \"You are children of the Lord your\n  G-d.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>whose first half clearly refers to non-jews. show me any other religion which puts all men on such a high pedestal.</p>\n\n<p>whatever one finds in the talmud must be taken in context of everything else said. hence it is important to ask a wise rabbi who is well versed in the entire talmud before accepting any quotes from those looking to demonize the torah sages.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>After reviewing the page linked, I know, as others have answered, that many of those quotes are not accurate translations or interpretations of the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, gentiles are not considered animals, and Jews who think they are, are incorrect. We believe that people who live virtually without morals are like animals because they are losing their human soul (and become even worse then animals); this applies to Jew or non-Jew alike. This does not mean we should treat them with no respect, because we are supposed to treat people with basic respect to maintain a functioning society. Also, good Jews try not to judge people, especially in our modern world where many people are trying to be good but are just struggling with their desires (treating all people with proper respect may possibly be considered law if the society's constitution (e.g. United States) includes equality). </p>\n\n<p>Also, some of the references to people being \"animals\" are talking about the human body in a context of Jewish bodily ritualistic laws, where the body is just like an animal's if not for sanctification. Jews are commanded by God to keep many bodily ritualistic laws to sanctify their bodies. Gentiles don't have this, so their \"body\" is simply coarse physicality. If a gentile wants to become \"holier,\" good for him or her, but it is not necessarily his or her mission in life. There are many Jews who don't live up to their mission of holiness, and that makes them a lot more \"animalistic\" than many gentiles who are being holier in their divine service.</p>\n\n<p>There are differences between Jews and non-Jews in Talmudic law. However, that is not the law in practice for most of the cases discussed. Some of our Rabbis (Meiri, Maimonides, Rabbi Reuven Margolis, Rabbi Samson Hirsch, and others) have explained that the reason there is some discrimination in the Talmud is because the nations of the world at that time did not have just and moral systems of law; therefore, we treated them in law as they treated others. Nonetheless, the way of the Torah is a way of peace and love, and Jews were encouraged to go above the strict letter of the law and treat gentiles like Jews in order to show God's love, greatness, and morality to the world. </p>\n\n<p>These Rabbis explain (and is implied by <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=11606\" rel=\"nofollow\">Maimonides</a> concerning the case of the oxen) that as non-Jews evolve to become moral and just in their systems of law in society, the Jewish law evolves with it, and we are obligated to treat them as is the accepted standard. As far as I understand, that will be reflected in Jewish law for eternity, as long as gentiles remain faithful to God and morality. </p>\n\n\n",

Their rule is \"simple\" - outside of your own family members, it should be never for any reason.</p>\n\n<p>Let's say Reuven's friend, Benzi (who are in the same class) has a sister, Talia. The three of them walk together on the street on Shabbat to visit their friends, Habakuk & Reut. Is this activity \"marit ayin\"? Keep in mind, that there is no prohibition, per se, even according to the yeshiva's rules about Benzi talking to Talia, as they are siblings. But, people don't know Talia, who don't know the family. Also, it IS against the yeshiva rules for Reuven to be with Talia.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes, it's Maaras Ayin <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=43b&format=text\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 43b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואל יספר עם אשה בשוק אמר רב חסדא ואפילו היא אשתו תניא נמי הכא אפילו היא אשתו ואפילו היא בתו ואפילו היא אחותו לפי שאין הכל בקיאין בקרובותיו</p>\n<p>And one shouldn't talk to strangers in the marketplace.</p>\n<p>Rav Chisda said that the law applies even with his wife, and a Braisa said that [this law applies] even with his wife, daughter or sister since not everyone is fluent in his relatives.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No. It is not Maaras Ayin.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.43b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ששה דברים גנאי לו לתלמיד חכם אל יצא כשהוא מבושם לשוק ואל יצא יחידי\nבלילה ואל יצא במנעלים המטולאים ואל יספר עם אשה בשוק ואל יסב בחבורה של\nעמי הארץ ואל יכנס באחרונה לבית המדרש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Six things are a disgrace for a Scholar: (i) he should not go out perfumed to the marketplace; (ii) he should not go out alone at night; (iii) he should not go with patched shoes; (iv) <strong>he should not speak with a woman in the marketplace</strong>; (v) he shouldn't recline in a group of ami haaretz; (vi) he should not go in last to the Bais Medrash.</p>\n<p>The Gemara goes on to explain that this applies even if the woman is his wife, daughter or sister, but none of things listed here are issurim.

    "content": "# Why two genders?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Why did G-d make it that all animals need both genders to procreate?</p>\n\n<p>Couldn't He just make one kind of animal per species and give it the ability to produce children on its own?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It would appear that the statement \"lo tov\" o be alone which was applied to the Adam is based on the example of the animals. Considewr Rav Hirsch and Rabbi Sorotzkin discussing the meaning of that and why it is \"not good\" for a human being to be \"alone\" and how that means that Adam had to learn from the animals that he required a partner. Note that hashem saw that the creation of the animals <strong>was</strong> \"tov\". Also see how Rav Hirsch and others explain that by having all the animals brought to Adam to receive their \"names\", Adam was able to discern the essence of each animal and learn how it applied to him. As a result, the animals had to be created as pairs (male and female).</p>\n\n<p>Note that even according to the analysis of \"male and female\" being involved in the creation of Adam, we see that the traits of sex had to be involved. It does appear from the fact that Adam was created alone, that there would have to have been the possibility of that being causing itself to produce offspring (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction#Agamogenesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">agamogenesis</a>). However, that would make the logic of the argument even more compelling. That is, the lesson that Adam <strong>had</strong> to learn, <strong>required</strong> the multiple sex concept. The minmum number of multiple sexes, would then be two.</p>\n\n<p>Also consider the specialization of roles to allow the males to defend and the females to bear and raise the young. This also makes things easier for the species, especially as gestation times increase with the various animals. However, the main point is the lesson that it teaches people and the fact that Adam had to understand that heesh needed to be split into he and she.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that man was supposed to be able to use the animals for his purpose in the world. While one can breed plants (which are effectively hermaphroditic), it would have been much more difficult to breed animals in the same way. Consider what people who attempt to breed specific types of plants have to do to prevent the crossbreeding because of pollen as opposed to the breeding of animals. In order to breed two specific animals, or to prevent \"improper\" animals, each animal would have to be kept totally isolated. Herds of dairy cows (for example) could not be kept as any two animals could breed. This could cause inbreeding with all of its problems.</p>\n\n<p>Look at the answers as to why Hashem created Adam to be \"male\" and \"female\" and the discussions as to why \"heesh\" was initially created as both and then split. Additionally, Hashem created sufficient animals to be a fully functioning ecology. That is He created herds of animals with the correct amount to make the system work.</p>\n\n<p>It was <strong>only</strong> Adam that had to be created as unique and individual. After that creation, Hashem showed him that it was \"lo tov\" for him to be alone and capable of having children without the input of another being (on both a physical and spiritual level).</p>\n\n<p>You can see some of the discussion in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/55913/adam-masculine-and-feminine\">Adam masculine and feminine?</a> and it is mentioned elsewhere as well.</p>\n\n<p>Another point is that Hashem did not create only one pair of animals at the moment of creation. He created a fully functioning ecology with the proper number and age distribution of animals (including massive numbers of animals that were required to be in herds). Thus, even if the animals had been created as hermaphrodites (which I show was <strong>deliberately</strong> not done above) he would not have just created the single base animal.</p>\n\n<p>See some of the implications of <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2011/10/breishis-creationism-and-evolutionism.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Breishis - Creationism and Evolutionism</a></p>\n\n\n",

When subsequently asked by the Mitteler Rebbe as to why and what had happened, he responded that at the time he saw a vision that Moshiach would come in 5775.

Uriah refused and latter David technically lawfully kill Uriah.

So, when Uriah died, the retroactive divorce was in effect. Hence, technically, Bathsheba was nobody's wife, and hence being with her was not a sin.</p>\n\n<p>The website assumes that having relations with single woman is not a sin. Notice that this is a pretty conservative rabbi. So for now, let's just agree with the website and \"assume\" that sex outside marriage is not a sin.</p>\n\n<p>Now that we have that assumption, another problem shows up.</p>\n\n<p>So David is technically not doing adultery thanks to the retroactive divorce.

If Uriah\n  had returned alive from the battle, the ‘get’ would not have been\n  effective, no? He would still have been married to Mrs. Uriah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that the pious thing to do, technically, is to just technically kill Uriah and continue having relations with Bathsheba.

I know that there are rules in the <em>talmud</em> to decide whom the <em>halacha</em> follows when there are particular parties involved, but I don't know all the rules and I don't see how they work in every case.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>masechet brachot</em>, <a href=\"http://images.e-daf.com/d.asp?ID=57&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">30a</a>, there is the following <em>mishna</em> (about whether one has to <em>daven mussaf</em> on his own) \" ר' אלעזר בן עזריה אומר אין תפלת המוספין אלא בחבר עיר וחכ\"א בחבר עיר ושלא בחבר עיר ר' יהודה אומר משמו כל מקום שיש שם חבר עיר יחיד פטור מתפלת המוספין\"</p>\n\n<p>Two opinions are given, the <em>Chachamim</em> and R. Elazar Ben Azaryah. The <em>gemara</em> points out that there are actually 2 versions of R. Elazar Ben Azaryah's statement, one filtered through R. Yehudah.</p>\n\n<p>The section continues with \"א\"ר הונא בר חיננא אמר ר' חייא בר רב הלכה כר' יהודה \" that the <em>halacha</em> accords with R. Yehudah's version of the statement and corroborates the ruling (through R. Chiya and Shmuel) The <em>gemara</em> continues to cite R. Yannai who, disagreeing with that ruling, practiced like the <em>Chachamim</em>, before returning to give another example of an <em>Amora</em> who ruled in the same way as R. Huna et al.</p>\n\n<p>This seems fine except for one thing -- the <em>halacha</em> seems to follow the <em>Chachamim</em> (and R. Yannai). The little letter <em>chaf</em> next to that opinion in the <em>mishna</em> (5 lines from the bottom) indicates that the <em>halacha</em> (as published in the S\"A, O\"C 286:2) and our normative established practice is not at all what R. Elazar Ben Azaryah said, with or without the framing of R. Yehudah.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know the rule that would allow the singular voice of R. Yehuda to hold sway over the <em>Chachamim</em>, but I'm more curious about how later authorities can decide that the <em>halacha</em> doesn't go along with what the plurality quoted in the <em>gemara</em> explicitly said the <em>halacha</em> is (and that position, while challenged, is never refuted). What is the value of quoting \"R. X says halacha k...\" if it isn't establishing that the rule follows that position? When there are multiple opinions cited in the <em>gemara</em> and a plurality of voices seem to support one view, how does a rule get codified in accordance with another view?</p>\n\n<p>Any insight would be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n",

So it is alluding to a Klallah that nothing will be left. Not sure why the middle words are left out except that the point is brought across without the additional words and, obviously, to make it equal 92. It would seem to imply that Pikudei which lists the materials for the Mishkan and lists the clothing of the Kohanim and contains the setting up of the Mishkan and the fact that the Glory of Hashem filled it, means that the Yidden were forgiven for the Chet Ha Egel. So the Kellalah of Bli Kol was avoided. Perhaps the printer made a mistake but perhaps he left it out on purpose because it's not a good siman if you just refer to the curse. But if you refer to the curse being uprooted, than its ok. All in the intention of the reader.</p>\n<p>Additionally, a few Pesukim before at 28:47 the Torah says that because you did not serve Hashem correctly when you had מרב כל therefore the punishments will come. Seems that Bli Kol is the opposite of Merov Kol. Same idea, you dodged the bullet of Bli Kol with the building and dedication of the Mishkan but now we see that a Bli Kol is the Midah Keneged Midah of not serving Hashem when you had Merov Kol. My thought- not sure if it's any good.</p>\n\n\n",

The commentary of <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>They brought the Tabernacle, etc.,</em> because they couldn't put it up.… No one could raise it because of the weight of the boards [that formed the walls] that no one had the strength to put upright, and Moses raised it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's good and well for the first time the Tabernacle was raised. But it was dismantled and raised again every time the Jews stopped along their travels through the desert (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9938&showrashi=true&v=17\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Numbers 10</a>:17, 21). Rashi there (verse 21) explains that it was the descendants of Gershon and Merari who put up the walls — certainly not Moses, then (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9867?v=16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Exodus 6</a>:16–20). How did they put it up in all their travels if they were unable to the first time?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi says that Hashem set this up in order to honor Moshe. Once he set it up then it became possible for the Leviim to continue setting it up and taking it down. My son said at his son's bris (Yom shlishi Parshas Pekudei) that because of the kedusha of the mishkan, not even Moshe could (physically) put up the walls. Hashem had Moshe act and He caused the walls to be erected. </p>\n\n<p>Once that was done, and the Chanukas Habayis completed, the kedusha of the mishkan had been established. Also, Moshe Rabbeinu had established that the mishkan was now completely set up. The Leviim had received their tasking and were now in the position of \"working for Hashem\". At this point, Hashem allowed them to carry out their appointed tasks and to succeed in taking down and setting up the mishkan.</p>\n\n<p>This means that the reason that the Leviim could not set it up originally was a decree from Hashem as was the neis of Moshe (appearing) to set it up by himself. Once Moshe had completed his task, Hashem decreed that the Leviim would be able to perform their assigned tasks.</p>\n\n<p>This is another way of teaching the lesson that a person does his hishtadlus (effort) but it is actually Hashem who causes the effort to succeed or fail.</p>\n\n<p>We can see a similar situation with the Aron, which \"bore its carriers\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Now they brought the Mishkan to Moses, etc.:</strong> Because they could not\n  erect it. Since Moses had done no work in the Mishkan, the Holy One,\n  blessed is He, left for him the task of erecting it [the Mishkan],\n  since no human being could erect it [by himself] because of the\n  heaviness of the planks; and no human was strong enough to put them\n  up, but Moses [was able to] put it up. Moses said before the Holy One,\n  blessed is He, “How is it possible for a human being to erect it [the\n  Mishkan]?” He [God] replied, “You work with your hand.” He [Moses]\n  appeared to be erecting it, and it arose by itself. This is [the\n  meaning of] what it says: “the Mishkan was set up” (Exod. 40:17). It\n  was set up by itself. [This is found in] the midrash of Rabbi\n  Tanchuma. -[from Midrash Tanchuma 11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our rav, on Shabbas Parshas Pekudei, cited Rav Yaakov Galinsky who calculated the weight of the kerashim. It was almost 4 metric tonnes per board. This is based on 58 cm. per amah. .5 grams per cubic cc of wood (atzai shitim is considered a light wood). The plated gold is estimated at 8mm thick at 19.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Thus the boards had to be put up by a neis.</p>\n\n<p>Each board was 10 X 1.5 X 1 Amah = 2,926,680 cubic centimeters</p>\n\n<p>.5 grams per cubic centimeter = 1,463,340 grams = 1,463.340 kilos = 3,219.348 pounds</p>\n\n<p>gold covering (on inside and outside) (9 x 58) (excluding the pegs) x (1.5 x 58) x .8 cm x 2 (two sets of covering) = 72,662.4 cubic centimeters</p>\n\n<p>19.5 grams per cubic centimeter x 72,662.4 = 1,416,916.8 grams = 1,416.9168 kilos = 3,117.21696 pounds</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Someone told me today that he had heard <a href=\"http://www.yadyechiel.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Yissocher Frand on an audiotape</a> quoting another rabbi who had asked the question above and had answered it by saying (citing the <em>Zohar</em>) that there is more hindrance from the <em>sitra achara</em> against a holier endeavor so that, when the <em>mishkan</em> was first erected, there was more hindrance than on later occasions, and the boards, actually light enough for people to put up normally, proved too heavy the first time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ikkur Sifsei Chachamim (#10 in the Artscrol chimash) says this was one of the questions Rashi was coming to address. To paraphrase his words \"about this Rashi explains that after Moshe erected it once 'by itself'(meaning through a miracle), and from that day on it was also erected through a miracle.\"</p>\n\n<p>He is apparently basing his words on the Mizrachi who phrases it somewhat differently, but also takes for granted that there was a miracle every time it was erected.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Performing Magic Tricks for Children",
    "content": "# Performing Magic Tricks for Children\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've often seen people do magic tricks for their nieces, nephews or for children in general. To an adult observer, the trick is obvious - but to young children, it seems like real magic. Considering that it's <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/torah/mitzvot/taryag/mitzvah250/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">permissible</a> to perform \"magic\" for <em>adults</em> as long as it's only to entertain and impress the audience, is this allowed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>In terms of magic to begin with Rav Moshe Feinstein (Iggros Moshe YD 4:13.) Seems to allow it. But later versions of Iggros Moshe seem to indicate he was hesitant to issue a Heter.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Chochmas Adam (89:6) forbids the practice. Chochmas Adam writes, \"...those badchanim (merrymakers) who perform achizas einayim at weddings are transgressing a prohibition of the Torah. One who bids them to do so transgresses the prohibition of lifnei eveir (causing one's fellow man to sin). Anyone who can object to this practice is obligated to do so, and certainly it is prohibited to watch their tricks, since one is aiding transgressors. \" The Chochmas Adam's ruling is quoted by many other poskim and none mention that the prohibition may no longer apply in our times. </p>\n\n<p>However, the Maharshal differed with this Chochmas Adam and held that swift hands coupled with sorcery is forbidden. But sleight of hand alone. Is permissible. </p>\n\n<p>Rav Yisroel Belsky (Shulchan Halevi page 138-141) suggests that announcing to the audience beforehand that none of the tricks involve actual sorcery but is just trickery, that  maybe even the Chochmas Adam would have permitted it. </p>\n\n<p>The poskim mentioned above do not make a distinction between adults and children. Although, logically if one is going to make a disclaimer, he should explain it in  a way that the children in the audience can understand that the tricks are not magical.  </p>\n\n<p>However, I did find on <a href=\"http://www.thehalachacenter.org/at_a_glance/5772_vaeira.php\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this site</a> that mentions without quoting a source that one should not preform for young impressionable children:</p>\n\n<p>Question: In practice, how should we conduct ourselves in regard to magic shows?\nDiscussion: None of the poskim who discuss this issue are quick to permit any type of magic. Indeed, the vast majority of poskim strictly prohibit it, some of them on the grounds that it a Biblical prohibition. Consequently, whenever possible, one should not perform or watch magic tricks, <strong>and surely not present magic shows in a school or camp to young, impressionable children.</strong>\nIn unique situations when-under direction of a rav-an exception has to be made, we have seen that there are some poskim who are more lenient, provided that the audience clearly understands that no magic is involved. Some poskim add that the magician must also demonstrate how the magic is performed.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, many commentators say that as long as you are not actually preforming magic, even if the audience would be duped into believing it is, it was not forbidden (Radbaz in Metzudas David 61, who maintains that the Torah only prohibits true acts of sorcery, and not deceptive acts that rely on purely natural phenomena. See Betzel Hachochmah 4:13 as well who echoes his opinion) thus even with impressionable children, it would be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.dinonline.org/2010/06/22/magic-as-innocent-as-it-seems/3/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here as well</a>: </p>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it is worth noting that even those who are stringent regarding “slight of the hands,” may concede that today no prohibition would apply. As the Rambam and the Chinuch (250, at greater length) conclude, the evil of “deception of the eyes” is that people will come to believe the impossible to be possible, and even reach conclusions that contravene the basic Jewish faith.</p>\n\n<p>Nowadays, this scenario is quite implausible—which is perhaps the background to the difference in approach of later authorities, such as the Iggros Moshe and the Klausenberger Rav, in comparison with the stringency of earlier authorities. <strong>The first question that a child raises after a magic trick is performed, is “How did you do it?!” He clearly doesn’t believe that the word “abracadabra” in able to achieve miracles, and supernatural forces are surely the last thing on his mind.</strong></p>\n\n<p>See here for further reading: <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5757/kedoshim.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5757/kedoshim.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

Likewise, I have not been able to secure a pillow on such a chair.  How do others deal with this little practical challenge?  Any helpful tips would be appreciated.  Note: there is another question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/56472/is-there-an-ideal-way-to-recline-on-pesach\">Is there an ideal way to recline on Pesach?</a> that asks what the ideal leaning posture is or might be.  The current question just asks for practical approaches to leaning while seated around a dining room table.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I've turned the chair sideways (i.e., the chair back is perpendicular to the table), draped a pillow over the back and leaned my hand over the pillow and the back. Don't use a high-back chair for this. A short chair or folding chair will work fine for this purpose. Another easy solution is just lean your elbow on the table.</p>\n\n<p>I have seen a number of ravs I have been with do just this.</p>\n\n<p>Another simple solution (perhaps) is just put an empty chair to the left of yours and pile some soft books and at least one pillow on top of the pile. I know - it does mean an extra seat at the table. Hey! My adage is that there's always room for one more \"dummy\" :-)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The simplest thing that I have done in this situation is to pull over a folding chair, and set it perpendicular to the left of my chair.  Then I use the back of that chair as my armrest.  If you have space for it, this is probably your best option.</p>\n\n<p>As a backup, I once turned to my right, so that the table was on my left, and then used the table to lean on.</p>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>At most seders I've been to, people are packed tightly-enough around the table that we end up kind of leaning into each other's spaces.  Since we're all doing it, nobody is inconvenienced.</p>\n\n<p>Sometimes, like @msh210, I've turned in my seat so that I can lean against the back of the chair.</p>\n\n\n",

In both of these cases, Rashi says that they are to be vertical and Rabbeinu Tam says that they are to be horizontal, and their reasons are the same as when it comes to mezuzot (cf: the Mordekhai, <em>ibid.</em>, who quotes Rabbeinu Tam at length). In my experience, sifrei Torah are <em>always</em> vertically arranged, and I have never even heard of anybody with their tefillin parchments at an angle.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I once saw in the ספר יראים that Rabbeinu Tam himself put it on an angle since it was a חשש on his part.

Leave enough room for this when preparing the seating.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The full section by Rabbi Eli J Mansour reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When and How to Recline</p>\n  \n  <p>The Raavayah determines that since people no longer eat as was once common practice, namely close to the floor on a couch or supported by cushions, it is therefore no longer obligatory to recline, causing us discomfort instead of feeling like kings. Maran rejects this opinion and considers reclining mandatory even today when we are used to eating sitting up straight in chairs. We recline while drinking the arbah kosot and while eating the massa. If one does not recline as he drinks one of the arbah kosot, he hasn't fulfilled his obligation and must drink another kos. So, before making Kiddush, the baal habayit should make an announcement, reminding everyone to recline while drinking. Keep in mind that reclining, haseva, is always to the left. Each person should concentrate on reclining to his own left and not be confused by the people sitting opposite him who look like they're reclining to their right. The Sages offer two reasons for reclining to the left. One is for safety purposes, to avoid the sakana of our food or drink being ingested by the windpipe which might happen if we lean to the right. The other reason is practical. Since most people are righties and need their right hands to eat, reclining to the left makes their right hands available for holding the kos or the massa. The Rabbis decided that even a lefty should recline to the left, despite the inconvenience, in order to avoid the aforementioned sakana. Haham Ben-Sion defines haseva as leaning forty-five degrees to the left, and one must be leaning on something such as the back of the chair or the table, and not simply leaning to the side in mid air with no support. Leave enough room for this when preparing the seating. It is debatable whether or not women should recline, some opinions maintain that a woman shouldn't do haseva unless she is considered an isha hashuva, an important woman. Shulhan Aruch says that all women are hashuvot, important and significant, and therefore they should also recline.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I did not find a copy of this whole document posted on the web, so I quoted the relevant section above.

That is the allusion of the phrase. </p>\n\n<p>To expand the idea a little, the idea is that anger affects the rate of breathing. It's a well-known strategy that breathing slowly helps you stay calm. Breathing rate is perhaps a more integral part of anger than facial expressions, etc. since it's subconscious and not easily faked. Additionally, breathing rate is directly correlated to heart rate, but only the rate of breathing can be observed by an onlooker.</p>\n\n<p>On a Kabalistic level, anger is said to affect the neshama, which is connected to the breath of the nose.

The nose is the strength of the mouth, or we could equally say, “Anger is the strength of the mouth.”\nAnatomically speaking, the nose and mouth are connected. When we breathe, air passes through both passageways. Vocalists use the nasal cavity to create resonance, allowing their voices to be heard with more volume and added brightness. \nAll that being said, for many of us, the mouth ‘flies off’ and flaps open when we become angry. Add to that what has already been said about the nostrils dilating when we are in a state of rage and it seems that the connection is not far-fetched.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If a man is married to a Gentile, is he forbidden from receiving an Aliyah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently a man went into a Sephardic synagogue with his Conservative Convert fiance to pray and eat. Upon learning of the woman's status, the Rabbi informed the man that once the marriage is consummated, he would be forbidden from receiving 'Aliyoth and there may be further halakhic repurcussions as time goes on. The Rabbi said that nothing could be done because it was the ruling of Ovadia Yosef as codified in Yalkut Yosef. Does anyone know if this is true and where in the Yalkut Yosef it can be found? And as a second question, does anyone know if it is normative halakha to restrict someone in such ways because of their marital status?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'm not aware of Rav Ovadiah's responsum. There are different communal standards about this.</p>\n\n<p>While a kohen is married to a divorcee (or non-Jewish woman for that matter), his kohen status is \"voided\" and will not receive any kohen-specific honors in the synagogue. The Talmud entertains -- and then rejects -- the possibility that a Levite would lose Levite honors if he marries someone illegally.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein has a responsum about giving synagogue honors to a sinner. The issue is that we are prohibited from validating a sinful behavior. (If necessary you may tell a gangster something vague like \"you're an okay guy\"; but you may not tell a Jew who is driving on shabbos \"what you're doing is okay.\") He concludes that giving someone an aliyah or the like is not necessarily commenting on any of his actions, and is therefore not prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, a community has the right to make a statement about certain actions they feel are beyond the pale. A few hundred years ago, there was a blue-blooded Sephardic Jewish fellow in London whose \"heart was stolen\" by an Ashkenazic girl named Jochebed Baruch; his Sephardic community decided that he could still attend synagogue, but receive no honors. (Okay, that's an extreme example.) </p>\n\n<p>There are many Sephardic communities that draw a simple line in the sand: wear a kipa or not, keep shabbat or not, we don't judge. But if you officially marry out, that's it. You are shunned.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There is such a thing as a \"marriage\" with a non-Jew. See Ezra chapters 9-10:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35a10.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt35a10.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>It may well be that it isn't a \"marriage\" without consummation as kesef and sh'tar don't work.</p>\n\n<p>As was the case in the book of Ezra, or possibly because of his reaction, Rabbis may have put a kind of \"cherem\" on men who marry out in order to pressure them to \"divorce\" or send away their wives.</p>\n\n\n",

He has to make <em>Borei Minei Besamim</em> so you let him. Both of you have to make <em>Borei Me'orei Ha'esh</em>, so he'll listen to you. He will listen to you make the rest of havdalah as the beginning words are identical to the weekday words; the ending is a bit \"extra\". The final bracha, while you say <em>Ben Kodesh L'kodesh</em>, he says \"ben kodesh l'chol\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>option 3</strong>- He listens to your Kiddush and Havdala and is yotzei through the words you said \"Baruch ata Hashem.. Hamavdil Ben Kodesh Lechol...\" even though the end of that brocho is \"Hamavdil ben Kodesh lekodesh?

Rav Moshe has an explicit responsum to a fellow who has 100% picked up and moved to Israel (house, business, everything); and is now visiting family in America. He is not obligated in the second seder because his home is Israel, but he should not be disruptive of what they are observing. Rav Moshe goes through the details of how to sit through a seder in such a situation.</p>\n\n<p>As for havdala, which was not addressed in that responsum: he should not make his own havdala out-loud, as that would be disruptive of the local observance. I agree that Option 4 would work (make havdala in his own room), but I strongly suspect (sources needed, obviously) it's not entirely necessary, and that in fact listening to a \"hamavdil bein kodesh l'kodesh\" havdala fulfills the same requirement of a \"hamavdil bein kodesh l'chol\" one. As everyone gets up to wash, he can then say, \"yum, I just feel like smelling some yummy spices now!\" and make a bracha on smelling the spices. There's nothing disruptive about that as plenty of people smell spices 7 days a week.</p>\n\n\n",

He says that the mitzvah of biur chametz is accomplished at the onset of Pesach. It is not a mitzvah accomplished at the time of biur, rather it is fulfilled when Pesach arrives after one has done the biur. And since once Pesach arrives, he has previously rid himself of chametz, it is more proper to make the blessing in a language that can also mean past tense, and not לבער which is only a future tense.</p>\n\n<p>But we see that the mitzvah of biur is not to destroy chametz per se, but rather the insurance that one does not have the chametz on pesach. </p>\n\n<p>At the end of Sh'a O'ch siman 432 The Ramma mentions the minhag to \"put out pieces of bread to find during the bedika so his bracha should not be in nought. But if one did not place, it is not a problem being that all people have in mind when they make the bracha that they will destroy any chametz if they find it.\" \nThe achronim mention the opinion of Ta'z that one should in fact not put out these pieces as it can lead to problems if they are not found, and it is better to rely on the second idea in the Ramma. See Shaar Hatzion 11. Many uphold the minhag to put bread of course, and quote the Arizal to put ten pieces.</p>\n\n<p>Again, in this second opinion of Ramma, we find bedikas chametz with a bracha, with no hope of actually finding chametz in one's possession. And no-one gives an eitza to go buy chametz, which would fly in the face of the Taz's concern which was said about chametz one already owns, certainly going to buy more chametz would be wrong, or as the OP puts it it is counterintuitive to the spirit of this commandment.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramma again at the end of  siman 445 mentions a minhag where if no chametz is found during the bedika, to burn the item used to do the search so as not to forget the chiyuv to do biur. (I guess this is where the feather and wooden spoon comes from, easily combustible items).</p>\n\n<p>This is a hindsight minhag, but again we don't see anyone saying 'it would have been better to buy some chametz beforehand in order to avoid this.

Accordingly, in a ladies' mikveh, one should similarly not make a blessing. However, Rabbenu Manoah himself states that the reason not to make blessings is that the water is dirty given the usage of hot water, but in a mikveh that uses cold water there would be no problem.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, R. Ovadya Yosef rules in Taharat HaBayit (Vol. II: 15:1) that the blessing should not be recited in modern day mikvaot, since the water is warm.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rabbenu Manoah doesn't elaborate why exactly a mikveh would get so dirty form using hot water (perhaps they effectively cleanse the women of dirt?), and modern day mikvaot stay quite clean, in spite of hot water, so it seems likely that according to Rabbenu Manoah, it would be permissible to make a blessing in a mikveh.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, R. Qafih (notes to Hilkhot K'riat Sh'ma there: 13) notes that Berakhot (3:5) discusses reciting sh'ma in a mikveh. He explains that immersion in a mikveh is brief, unlike a bathhouse in which naked people congregate.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, see <a href=\"http://net-sah.org/product/10814\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birkat Moshe</a> by R.

    "content": "# Does Maimonides Allow Prayer to Angels?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In his Mishna Commentary to Sanhedrin 10:1 Maimonides lists as his 5th principle the prohibition to pray to an angel even as an intermediary.\nHe counts this in his enumeration of his 13 principles in his Mishne Torah as well (Hil. Tshuva ch. 3).</p>\n\n<p>How then are we to understand his codification in Laws of Tfilla (7:5) of a prayer addressed to angels</p>\n\n<p>וְכָל זְמַן שֶׁיִּכָּנֵס לְבֵית הַכִּסֵּא אוֹמֵר קֹדֶם שֶׁיִּכָּנֵס הִתְכַּבְּדוּ מְכֻבָּדִים קְדוֹשִׁים מְשָׁרְתֵי עֶלְיוֹן עִזְרוּנִי עִזְרוּנִי שִׁמְרוּנִי שִׁמְרוּנִי הַמְתִּינוּ לִי עַד שֶׁאֶכָּנֵס וְאֵצֵא שֶׁזֶּה דַּרְכָּן שֶׁל בְּנֵי אָדָם.\n(Other versions of the text include even more prayer).</p>\n\n<p>This formulation is more difficult as he writes elsewhere that the angels that accompany man are his positive and negative inclinations.\n“It is to the good and the evil inclinations that they refer in their well-known words,\"  Every person is accompanied by two angels, one being on his right side, one on his left.\" In the Babylonian Gemara (Shabbath 119b), they say distinctly of the two angels that one is good and one bad.” (Moreh Nevuchim 3:22; Friedlander Trans.)</p>\n\n<p>For a similar presentation of the angels that accompany a person, see <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/2306n.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hil. Mezuzah 6:13</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is it permissible to pray to one's inclinations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>There is indeed at least unnamed but very early Rabbi who believed this prayer to be proof that there's no prohibition of praying to angels. See the responsum published by Simcha Emanuel in Hamayaan, Tishrei 5758. (<a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/Machnisei_Rachamim_1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This article</a> attributes the same responsum to R. Eliezer Rokeach, though this is not necessarily correct). </p>\n\n<p>Also, before answering the question directly, I'll note that Maimonides/Rambam does not believe that Biblical or Talmudic angels are to always be understood as man's inclinations (see the Commentary to Sanhedrin 10:1, for example, where they are intermediaries for prophecy). Just because he offers that explanation of a passage in Shabbos 119b, he wouldn't necessarily believe the same about these \"angels\". </p>\n\n<p>Actually, there's a huge body of literature regarding what exactly would be problematic, in Maimonides'/Rambam's view, regarding 'praying to' (or making requests of) angels. I can't find a link right now to all of the many (approx. 30) sources that I know of myself. However, there are less sources dealing directly with this particular prayer, and I'll be happy to discuss those answer. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>One explanation is that Maimonides/Rambam probably did not have the version of the text that you cite above, but rather a version that lacked the phrase \"עזרוני עזרוני\" (as testified by the <a href=\"http://www.jewishhistory.com/HARAMBAM/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bodleian MS. Huntington 80</a>, the copy autographed by its great author).  Thus, the only problematic two words (which seem like a 'prayer'), would be \"שמרוני שמרוני\", \"protect me\". However, R. Yehudah ben Yakar, in his commentary to the Siddur, explains that the phrase should be translated as \"wait for me\", just as the verse, \"ואביו שמר את הדבר\". (He recognizes that this renders the next phrase, המתינו לי as redundant, and his response to that issue is merely to not include it). This explanation is also suggested by R. Meir HaMeili of Narbonne (in the book Milchemes Mitzvah, printed in the back of his Sefer HaMeoros on Maseches Berachos)</p></li>\n<li><p>Rabbeinu Manoach, a very early commentator on the Rambam, writes that this prayer is indeed directed not to angels, but to certain intellectual faculties. By saying this 'prayer' before entering the lavatory, a person is actually reinforcing (to himself) that he shouldn't be fully using his rational faculty while in there (I assume because one is not permitted to study Torah in the bathroom) but at the same time doesn't want to abandon it completely. </p></li>\n<li><p>Another source that I know of which addresses this issue directly is R. Yaakov Emden in his commentary on the Tur, Mor U-Ketziah (O.C. 3). There, he explains that because he refers to the angels as משרתי עליון, it's clear that he doesn't believe that the angels have any independent agency, but he's speaking to them as emissaries of God. He believes that doing so avoids running afoul of Maimonides' 5th principle, which is merely that is isn't worth requesting anything of angels because they cannot act against God's will; here, a person is merely asking that they perform God's will happily. (See Abarbanel in Rosh Amanah ch. 12, and R. Moshe Feinstein, Iggros Moshe vol 8, O.C. 5:43:6). Personally, I'm not so convinced that Rambam/Maimonides would really be OK with this, especially if his source is the Talmud Yerushalmi 9:1)</p></li>\n<li><p>R. Asher Weiss discussed this question in a shiur from September 2006 (<a href=\"http://www.kolhalashon.com/New/Shiurim.aspx?Path=Hebrew%7CHTnc%7CParashaShiur%7CR0007-1%7CPrevLessons%7CMoadeyShana%7CYamimNorayim%7CElul\" rel=\"noreferrer\">available here</a>) and said that careful reading of Maimonides in both his Commentary to Sanhedrin as well as in Hil. Teshuvah 3:7 shows that he only prohibits prayer to angels if done as an expression of their status as intermediaries between oneself and God or serves them. However, if one merely \"prays\" to them to ask them a favor, this is not considered serving the angels in any way and is thus permitted. (However, this still seems to be against the Ramban in his \"Toras H' Temimah\", R. Yehudah ben Yakar in his commentary to Tachanun, and R. Shimon ben Tzemach Duran in Magen Avos ch. 4)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Never did the Rambam understand this declaration as a \"prayer\" nor at any time did he deem requests or favors be permissible to ask of <em>mal'akhim</em> (\"angels\"). </p>\n\n<p>In an article written for the monthly newsletter of <em>Makhon Mosheh</em> and <em>Halikhoth `Am Yisra'el</em> - <em>Or HeHalikhoth</em> - by Rabbi Dr. Hhananel Sari (<em>Shevat</em>, 5773), the position of the Rambam from his own writings is explanation as regards the nature of <em>mal'akhim</em> and specifically the purpose and identity those that are constantly referred to by <em>Hazal</em> as accompanying each person.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...the <em>mal'akhei ha-shareth</em> that the <em>gemara</em> describes such as that they accompany a person [home from the <em>beth kenesseth</em>] on <em>Shabbath</em>, they appear to be the same <em>mal'akhim</em> that are mentioned in other places in the words of <em>Hazal</em>. They testify to the deeds of a person if he acts in a way that is not appropriate (cf. <em>Ta`anith</em> 11a), and from them it seems that a person needs to separate with apologies before they enter to perform their needs (i.e. use the bathroom - cf. <em>Berakhoth</em> 60b). The <em>Shulhhan Arukh</em> writes that today we no longer have the custom to say this apology, called \"<em>hithkhabdu mekhubadim</em>\" (OH 3:1), since we are not so strong in our <em>yirath shamayyim</em> that <em>mal'akhim</em> accompany us (cf. <em>Mishnah Berurah</em>). In the <em>sefer</em> \"<em>Kaf HaHhayyim</em>\" an opinion is brought in opposition to this that there are <em>mequbalim</em> who recommend to say it also in our times, since these <em>mal'akhim</em> continue to accompany each person also today. This <em>mahhloqeth</em>, whether or not <em>mal'akhim</em> still accompany people in our generation and if it is feasible to turn to them, for they comment on their observation that it accomplishes not only a positive assistance but it is also involved in [promoting] a more meticulous inspection of our deeds, these are debated due to a conception of <em>mal'akhim</em> which is far removed from that of the Rambam. In the <em>Moreh Nevukhim</em> (2:6, 3:22) the Rambam, in dealing with the explanation of the nature of <em>mal'akhim</em>, mentions that the meaning of the \"<em>mal'akh</em>\" is not always consistent, however the basic meaning is always \"<em>shaliahh</em>\". Because of this, each <em>navi</em> is worthy of being called by this name and even forces of nature through which <em>HaQadhosh Barukh Hu</em> manages His world, all of them are worthy to be called \"<em>mal'akhim</em>\" and they are known as the <em>pamalya shel ma'alah</em> (i.e. the entourage of <em>HaQadhosh Barukh Hu</em>). After this introduction, the Rambam brings a passage from <em>Midrash Qoheleth</em> that tells how when a person sleeps \"<em>nafsho omereth le-mal'akh umal'akh omer le-keruv</em> - his soul speaks to the 'angel' and the angel speaks to the 'cherub'.\" And from here he learns that in the language of <em>Hazal</em> the creative faculty of a person is called a \"<em>mal'akh</em>\" ('angel') and his intelligence is called \"<em>keruv</em>\" ('cherub'). The Rambam knew that the majority of people were not accustomed to designating these parts of the soul as being <em>mal'akhim</em> and would even resist to accept this fact, therefore continues and says, \"How important this is for the one who knows, and how ugly it is to those who are fools.\" We find therefore who these <em>mal'akhim</em> are according to the Rambam that accompany a person to every place that he goes, and it is clear now that in his opinion each person is accompanied by these two <em>mal'akhim</em> also in our times. Now it only reamins to clarify who is the \"evil <em>mal'akh</em>\" and who is the \"good <em>mal'akh</em>.\" The question is not so difficult, yet the Rambam also deals with this question, but in another chapter of the <em>Moreh</em> (2:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Making requests - either for intercession or favors - from objects or beings other than HaShem is a violation of the 5th principle of Jewish faith and is the basis of all idolatry. Even <em>nevi'im</em> who receive their prophecies through the agency of a <em>mal'akh</em> don't ever make requests of them. Instead, they pray directly to God and allow God to use whatever means He deems necessary.</p>\n\n<p>This particular statement amounts to little more than reminding one to hold off thinking holy and religiously constructive thoughts while in the bathroom until he finishes and exits. There is no prayer here and the phrases of \"help me\" and \"guard me\" etc. are later additions made by those who took this statement as a prayer to angels for protection from demons that supposedly live in the bathroom.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. Kol tuv.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Maharal in Nesivas Olam (Nesiv Hoavoda 12) discusses the issue of Machnisei Rachamim. He is completely in line with the Rambam that it is absolutely Assur to pray to angels. However, he writes that it would be ok to say it as a command rather than a prayer.</p>\n\n<p>In our case, this 'prayer' is actually <em>telling</em> them to wait rather than begging or praying to them. It seems that a function of this recital is to keep in mind that Hashem send us angels to protect us.</p>\n\n\n",

He is not desirous of getting her, being that he has no chance. So too are all belongings of another person when we realize who allocated all things to all people.</p>\n\n<p>This seems to be built around the idea presented in Rambam and other Rishonim, quoted in Chinuch #38, that one does not transgress Chimud until they take an action to acquire the item in question, and at the time of ascertaining the item, he has retroactively transgressed Chimud. The appreciation of an item is not what is outlawed, contrary to popular belief, it is the obsession and contrived actions taken to procure it that defines the lav. Whether the obsessed chooses to steal the item or pressure the owner with money in a fair sale.</p>\n\n<p>Personally, I have a similar idea to the Ibn Ezra which seems to find favor in the ears of us westernized narcissists. Imagine Hashem shows you the most wonderful (fill in the blank). He gives you the opportunity to bestow this (fill in the blank) to whomever you wish. The one caveat is it can't be you:) Now, after you present this gift of (fill in the blank) to whomever, would you turn around and be jealous of it? Seems whoever I mention this scenario to says no. The entire reason we are jealous, even while believing that everything is from Hashem, is because deep down we still think well why didn't He give it to me?! But when we find a way to take this anti-Godly thought out of our system, the battle is half won.\nThe Ibn Ezra has his approach to combat this thought process with a mashal, I'm simply adding mine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Torah commands us not to envy.

That Hashem created a world with me in it means that I have an important role to play - Bishvili Nivra Ha'olam. But I am not an end to myself. Hashem placed me here for both my development as an individual AND for my ability to connect and change the world around me. My job is to be the soil from which a better family, community, society and world draws its nourishment. And <em><strong>everyone else also has this charge.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Rashi on parshas Vayera notes an interesting dichotomy - Avraham addresses the three visitors in a very respectful, but ultimately human manner. Lot goes out of his way to shower them with words of trepidation, treating them as the emissaries of Hashem that they were. Rashi notes that Lot had seen angels previous in the house of Avraham (and hence recognized them for what they were), but that Avraham's greatness was such that the angels appeared merely to be people to him.</p>\n<p>But the critical point is as follows: <em><strong>the greatness of Avraham isn't that he perceived angels as people, but that he looked at people and perceived them as angels.</strong></em> Avraham understood that one needn't be a divine being to be a malach, and that each person (as well as every situation) we interact with in this world shapes and is shaped by us in turn. It is our job to see beyond the surface, deeper than our immediate reactions, to the opportunity beneath.</p>\n<p>So how does this relate to your question?</p>\n<p>A doctor, a shokhet and a chef all have knives, but it would be foolish for them to covet the tools of the other professions - they aren't properly suited for their employment! A sledge hammer doesn't do the job of a wooden mallet. And coveting the dentist's drill just because it's expensive doesn't make sense when you're job is building a house. If we really, genuinely believe that Hashem is controlling the world, then that means that each person has their role, and that each person is <em><strong>given the tools for their unique role.</strong></em></p>\n<p>At a wedding, we recite in one of the sheva brachot: \"Same'ach Tisamach ... kisameichacha yetzircha bigan eiden mikedem.\" What was the uniqueness of the simcha of Gan Eiden? Adam HaRishon knew, without any question, that Chavah was the only one for him (Rashi - \"Zos Hapa'am\"). The bracha we wish upon the chassan and kallah is that they recognize that this is <em><strong>the woman,</strong></em> that Hashem placed them here, and that it is their job to recognize the uniqueness of their relationship.</p>\n<p>The challenge of envy is keeping this principle in mind for all things (the first clause of Lo Sachmod is eishes rei'echa) - Hashem has set the world up so I am given the tools for my success, and other people's possession aren't worth coveting because their job is unique and different from mine.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Pirkei Avot 2:12:</p>\n\n<p>רַבִּי יוֹסֵי אוֹמֵר, יְהִי מָמוֹן חֲבֵרָךְ חָבִיב עָלֶיךָ כְּשֶׁלָּךְ. </p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yosei says: The property of your friend should be as precious to you as your own. </p>\n\n<p>I think that the above adage stands on its own merit, and doesn't necessitate further explanation. However, I will add my own take, somewhat.</p>\n\n<p>The above is somewhat of an extension of \"Love to your friend as you love yourself.\" Think this through, a bit. The Torah mitzvah sets <strong>yourself</strong> as the basis of love. Is this selfish? Not at all! The idea is that normal thinking people (i.e. - no mental problems that are self-destructive, depressive, etc.) always seek the best for themselves. The mitzvah says, that's what you need to do to your friend - seek the same standard of \"best\" for them that you want for yourself.</p>\n\n<p>Avot narrows this down, here. Just as you consider your own property \"precious\" - i.e. - you don't want anyone touching, abusing or stealing your property, because, after all, it's <strong>yours</strong>, don't look after your friend's property - i.e. - don't envy what's not yours in the same way that you don't want your friend to envy your property.</p>\n\n\n",

So seems like he'd be ok with it too.</p>\n\n<p>Maharsham 1:183 quotes that as well as R Shlomo Kluger (Nidrei Zerizin 8) and the Peri Megadim (444:2) permitting.</p>\n\n<p>Chatam Sofer (OC 121) seems to permits it <em>qua</em> Kitniyot. He cautions though that one should make with a Heker (a la YD 96, I presume) lest anyone confuse them with real Matza to fulfill the Mitzva with Seder night. (He expresses doubt if there is really a need to change the way we keep Pesach (absent some sort of localized stress, eg. famine), but doesn't claim there is formal Minhag to avoid it. This seems just general Chatam-Sofer-conservatism.)</p>\n\n<p>Binyan Tziyon (HaChadashot 6) is hesitant to be more lenient than the Chatam Sofer <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/a/702/759\">lechatchila</a>, but certainly allows such Matza to be eaten if already produced.</p>\n\n<p>Be'er Yitzchak (OC 11) justifies a common practice in his communities to bake such Matza (from רעצקע (?)).</p>\n\n<p>Avnei Nezer (OC 534) writes that \"Chachamim made Kitniyot like the 5 grains\" and therefore a Kitniyot derivative which was made with out water will still become prohibited if later mixed with water. It sounds from that like rice Matza would be ok.</p>\n\n<p>I note that major Kashrut organizations nowadays such as the OU permit selling \"Matza\" from non-grains (with a printed disclaimer) without concern for mixing it up for use in the Seder (see for instance <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B004DBVJRA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this product</a> or <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B00D7MG6RE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this product</a> made from tapioca and potato).

When the customer buys the item and is about to pay for it, the owner says, \"No, The price advertised is wrong. The real price is higher. We made a mistake in the circular, and you can see on the bottom of each circular in tiny letters it says, 'Not responsible for any errors'.\"</p>\n\n<p>I know that in certain U.S. states, the disclaimer may or may not allow the store to do this. Halachically, must the owner honor the advertised (mistaken) price considering that the customer is about to purchase the item (i.e. - it was scanned, but cash was not yet tendered)? Or, can the owner rely on the fine print disclaimer (see assumptions, below) and he can charge the higher price?</p>\n\n<p>Assumptions:</p>\n\n<p><strong>The rules of \"fine print\"</strong> - Does this work in halacha? The majority of people don't read it, and most don't understand \"legalease\". Granted, in this case, the single sentence is understandable, but still, most people may not notice it. Thus, perhaps, this is \"lifnei iver\" - how clearly most something be stated to avoid misleading people?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Generality of the disclaimer</strong> - The disclaimer is placed on every ad. It therefore seems that this exempts the owner from randomly changing his mind on the price whenever he feels like it and using the ad as a backup. Seems like a form of \"gneivat da'at\" or something similar. The owner is trying to weasel his way out of his own error.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Who is responsible for the error? / Benefit of doubt</strong> - Maybe there really was a mistake! The owner sent the ad copy to the printer showing the correct (higher) price, but the printer printed it incorrectly.

I put \"<em>Korban Pesach</em>] in brackets in the previous sentence because whether the <em>Korban Pesach</em> was part of Hillel's wrap is the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.koltorah.org/ravj/ZecherLemikdashKehillel.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">later disagreement</a> between <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashi\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rashbam\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashbam</a> there, who hold that it was, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam</a> in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Leavened_and_Unleavened_Bread.8.6-8?lang=he-en\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Hilchot Chametz Umataza</em> 8:6-8</a>, who implies that the wrap was only matza and <em>maror</em>, while the <em>Korban Pesach</em> was eaten separately.</p>\n\n<p><em>Tzafun</em> is a placeholder for eating of the <em>Korban Pesach</em>, which, as encoded in <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Pesachim.10.8?lang=he-en\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>Mishna Pesachim</em> 10:8</a>, must be the last food consumed on Pesach night.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when we restore the practice of <em>Korban Pesach</em>, we will presumably eat it in the <em>Tzafun</em> slot in the <em>Seder</em>. If we follow the Rambam's interpretation of Hillel's practice, then that plus the <em>Korech</em> we're already used to, on the schedule we're used to, fulfills both Hillel's opinion and that of his contemporaries, since they agreed that the <em>Korban Pesach</em> was eaten by itself, at the end of the meal.

Before we factor in the dispute between Hillel and the Sages (and <em>rishonim</em>'s interpretations thereof) we need to define what the essential nature of <em>tzafun</em> is. This appears to be a dispute between Rashi and Rambam. As I noted in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/91206/13438\">this answer</a> the simple reading of Rambam is that the <em>tzafun</em> step is not really part of the <em>mitzvah</em>. The essential <em>mitzvot</em> of <em>matzah</em>, <em>maror</em> and <em>korban pesach</em> are fulfilled by eating those three things prior to the main meal, as Rambam codifies in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=2288\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:6</a> and <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=2289\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:7</a>. Once you've done that you have fulfilled all three mitzvot. There is a separate rabbinic institution that we should eat the <em>korban pesach</em> again after the meal in order for it to be the last taste in our mouths, as Rambam explains in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=2268\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:11</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now if the purpose of <em>tzafun</em>was just to make the <em>korban pesach</em> be the last taste in your mouth, it would presumably be irrelevant how the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>korban pesach</em> must be fulfilled. It doesn't matter what Hillel holds, what the Sages hold, or how <em>rishonim</em> interpret that dispute, because that was all already taken care of before the meal when we ate all three items and tried to fulfill both opinions. After the meal we are not attempting to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em>; we are simply leaving the taste of the <em>korban pesach</em> in our mouths, which should not require any accompaniment of <em>matzah</em> or <em>maror</em>.</p>\n\n<p>However, Rashi on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=119b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 119b</a> seems to explain the point of <em>tzafun</em> differently. He seems to assume that the main <em>mitzvah</em> is actually fulfilled by what is eaten during <em>tzafun</em>. If so, then we would presumably fall under the dispute between Hillel and the Sages as to how to correctly do the <em>mitzvah</em>. Thus, according to Rashi's explanation of Hillel on <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=115&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">115a</a>, you would presumably have to wrap all three together for <em>tzafun</em> as that is how you would fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> in Hillel's view.</p>\n\n<p>If you mix and match opinions and follow Rashi's interpretation of the nature of <em>tzafun</em> but Rambam's interpretation of Hillel's view then you would presumably have to eat a wrap of <em>matzah</em> and <em>maror</em> after the meal when you eat the <em>korban pesach</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a chart:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/94PNv.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/94PNv.jpg\" alt=\"A chart showing the breakdown of the different opinions\"></a></p>\n\n\n",

It was a general statement by the sorcerers of Egypt that \"all of these events are the work of Hashem and not magic.\"</p>\n\n<p>So we can say that the sorcerers use of \"finger\" had nothing to do with the third, or the passing of three, plagues. It was simply that the third plague was when they noticed Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, it doesn't matter if there were 3, 10, or 27 plagues in the group; it would all be called \"finger\". It also doesn't matter if the Egyptian sorcerers knew how many plagues there would be. The statement simply means that the sorcerers knew they were dealing with Hashem, and not magic. It was not a statement meant to convey Egyptian mathematical calculations. We are not dealing with some Egyptian priestly scroll which holds that 3 acts of intervention on behalf of a god = a \"finger's\" worth; and two acts of a different god = a \"toe\" etc. That is not what is happening here.</p>\n\n<p>(Also, we need not be bothered that the <em>single plague</em> of cattle disease is called \"hand\" and not \"finger\". The Zohar on the parshah, discusses this question, and explains that since there were 5 different kinds of animals stricken, the word \"hand\" was chosen as the proper metaphor <em>within that plague</em>. This does not mean that the other plagues count as a finger or hand <em>each</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>Also, we do not need to be bothered by the Haggadah's comparison of what an Egyptian said vs. what the Jews saw, in order to make the 1:5 ratio calculation. This is because a Medrash will take notice of an extra word in a verse to establish a point of revealed wisdom. In this case, the exact quote of the word \"finger\" was not needed for the Torah to express that the Egyptians finally admitted that Hashem was involved. That could have been conveyed by quoting the sorcerers simply: \"It is G-d!\". The word \"finger\" is extra in as much as the Torah does not always quote everything everyone said (even if that's what they said). </p>\n\n<p>So, R' Yossi is pointing out that the Torah itself must be endorsing the word \"finger\" as a proper and necessary descriptive of the situation. It is to teach us that the entire episode of plagues was merely a \"finger's\" worth of Divine intervention. Now, using hindsight, we see that there were ten such plagues, and at the sea Hashem uses the word \"hand\", so we can now calculate the revelation of Hashem's intervention on our behalf was much greater than what He showed us during the plagues in Egypt proper.</p>\n\n<p>However, we can still be bothered that the Tanach, in a few places, refers to the entire \"going out of Egypt\" as \"Hashem's hand\". For instance Devarim 26:8 \"And the Lord brought us out from Egypt with a <strong>strong hand</strong> and with an outstretched arm, with great awe, and with signs and wonders.\"</p>\n\n<p>so why make the comparison of \"finger\" to \"hand\" by the sea? Why not say that based on Devarim 26:8, the whole batch of \"signs and wonders\" is called \"hand\" (not merely \"finger\") so that the ratio is 1:1 and not 1:5??!</p>\n\n<p>So it seems that the same Netziv (in his previous paragraph right before the one quoted above), answers this too. He says that the key wording by the \"hand\" at the sea is that \"Israel was afraid of Hashem\" (this phrase is not used to modify \"hand\" in other places like Devarim 26:8). What extra level of fear of Hashem was achieved at the sea? He answers that the fact that at the sea, each slave saw their personal master punished and killed in a certain specific way that matched his crimes/level of evil was a totally convincing event, proving that Hashem was indeed intricately involved in everyone's life, and a caring judge of each man's actions in this world. This could not be seen by the plagues in Egypt which were events of general destruction.</p>\n\n<p>So now we can explain R' Yossi to mean that the general proof that Hashem controlled every aspect of nature was seen during the plagues, while the fact that Hashem judged man individually and fairly, measure for measure, was seen at the sea. The former is called \"finger\" and the latter is called \"hand\". Hence 1:5.</p>\n\n<p>Still, we can finally ask, if R' Yossi meant 1:5 mathematically or is it just a teaching to contrast intensity? IOW, did R' Yossi have a secret list of the 50 plagues at the sea that was somehow lost and never published in the Mechilta?</p>\n\n<p>IMHO, it seems that an exact list of 50 (although possible) is not R' Yossi's intention. I draw this from some Torah examples. 1. Yosef tells the Egyptians that it is enough if they pay a fifth of their crop to Pharoah to show he owns their lands. 2. The Torah asks that we pay a fifth if we wish to redeem maaser sheni. 3. If someone steals from Hekdesh (me'ilah) he pays an additional fifth etc. The concept of the fifth seems to be used by the Torah to convey that it represents just enough to convince someone, that the matter is important. </p>\n\n<p>So too, the only other time in all of Tanach (IIRC) that the words \"finger of Hashem\" is used, appears in connection with the writing of the 10 commandments. (see Devarim 9:10 \"And the Lord gave me two stone tablets, inscribed by the <strong>finger of G-d</strong>,...\") Why isn't it written by the \"hand\"? When we say an author wrote something, do we say it was by his \"hand\" or \"finger\"? So too we can say here that the Torah may wish to convey that the 10 commandments is enough of a collection of Law to show how Hashem wants you to respect Him and others in general. The rest of the 613 would be the \"hand\" (the full details of those ethics-interestingly, the Rambam calls his book on all the mitzvos: \"Mighty Hand\"). This is true, even if 10 x 5 = 50 and not 603! It is a parable. a finger represents a person's willing involvement to a limited extent in a given situation. A hand represents a total manipulation which proves a person's intimate involvement and reveals the complete depth of the involvement. </p>\n\n<p>Maybe the plagues in Egypt could only reveal that Hashem controlled the natural world and there was indeed judgment <em>in general</em> (one fifth). So now, maybe Moshe was just a very good sorcerer who knew Hashem's rules of karma, and invoked them as general calamities(like Billam)? However, once the Jews saw that Hashem was individually judging each Egyptian with exact measure, they feared Hashem realizing He was constantly involved in everyone's life; and they believed in Moshe completely (and they knew he did not use \"magic\").</p>\n\n<p>\"10\" in Egypt showed us Hashem is involved. \"50\" is full (shleimos) involvement. So it would seem R' Yossi uses the key number 50 to represent \"fullness\".</p>\n\n\n",

It's also Rav Moshe projecting how he would approach the problem.)</p>\n\n<p>Otherwise, asks Rav Moshe, explain to me why <em>mustard</em> was on the list 700 years ago, yet <em>caraway</em> was clearly not on the list as of 200 years ago?</p>\n\n<p>So why buckwheat and not quinoa? Because buckwheat was known to Ashkenazic rabbis a few centuries ago, and quinoa was not. So they never developed a ban or warning about it.</p>\n\n<p>If, instead, we look for categorical explanations, then <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/Passover/QuonfusedAboutQuinoa/\">several could be offered</a>, e.g.: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Buckwheat and wheat can grow in the same field and therefore there is a cross-contamination risk, whereas quinoa is grown at such high altitudes that wheat couldn't grow there.</li>\n<li>\"Buckwheat\" is a word that people can confuse with \"wheat\", but \"quinoa\" is not. </li>\n<li>Quinoa's closest commonly-eaten relative is the beet, which everyone eats on Passover.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>As for what's happened with quinoa in the past few years: there have been legitimate questions of cross-contamination in the factories and how it's processed. But assuming you know this is 100% pure quinoa, some poskim felt (and feel) that it is so grainlike that it should be prohibited, or it was already covered under some sort of categorical ban. (Some even attempted to split hairs and say it's so grainlike, even Rav Moshe would consider it prohibited; in my humble opinion that's a forced reading.) The Star-K has vociferously allowed it. There were differences of opinion among OU poskim, and my understanding is that recently, there was some change of thought among them to shift the official OU position from <code>ask your posek, we're not commenting</code> to <code>it will say OU-P, and if your custom is otherwise, then follow your custom.</code> I believe someone approached the OU poskim with the categorical arguments. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Coffee beans are allowed, as well as cocoa beans. They are really a fruit od a plant, just like Kasha. If we don't call it buckweat but instead Kasha there is no confusion.</p>\n\n<p>String beans or green beans are allowed because its a vegetable, not a legume. They both have the word bean in it to confuse it with a legume.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam in Moreh Nevochim 2:25 actually says that he would have had an easier time reinterpreting the account of Bereishis to align with Aristotle's view of the eternity of existence than he did with reinterpreting all of the references to G-d's having a body to be in line with G-d's incorporeality.  It is a principle of faith to <em>not</em> read these verses according to the simplest way to read them.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, the Rambam there writes that he does not feel that reinterpreting these verses to align with Aristotle's view would be a problem with reading the verses, and his rejection of Aristotle's view is not because of the text of Bereishis.  It would have been a valid way to read it, if not for the fact that the Rambam has other, very significant, issues with the doctrine that is behind it.  </p>\n\n<p>So not reading something according to its literal reading is certainly not an independent reason to be considered a heretic.

If we assume that less prohibitions are better, that would be an advantage. (There are some counterpoints as well though.

    "content": "# Kol Dichfin, Why So Hesitant?\n\n## Frage\n\n<h2>כל דכפין ייתי ויכול, כל דצריך ייתי ויפסך</h2>\n<p>\"All who are hungry come and eat\".</p>\n<p>Why don't we ask this in a more emphatic way? Instead of saying \"I invite all who want to come...\" we say something to the effect of \"if you need and are so desperate then come\" as if to say that if they had what to eat they are not wanted.</p>\n<p>In contrast, we find during Sukkos, we invite the ushpizin and we say \"azmin l'seudasi ushpizin ila'ah etc\" \"we invite to our meal...\" here we are extending an explicit invitation. This is significantly different than the way we ask on seder night which seems very passive.</p>\n<p>It would seem to be more appropriate that we would be enthusiastic on this night that we are free men and are rejoicing in our redemption and thus extend a formal invitation to all those in need.</p>\n<p>How is this supposed to be understood?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The comparison to Succos is off base. As on Succos you are inviting departed souls. As SethJ mentioned in the comment regarding Pesach \"how we can invite guests, given that each individual and family is obligated to eat from their own Korban, which means that your partners for the Korban need to be selected before the Korban is brought; you cannot invite poor guests of the street to join you.\" Thus this must not be a real invite. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%94%D7%92%D7%93%D7%94_-_%D7%94%D7%90_%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%90_%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi translates these words as follows.</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כל דכפין ייתי ויכול - צריך אדם שיהיה רעב ערב הפסח, כדי שיאכל מצה\n  לתאבון, כדאמרינן בערבי פסחים דרבא הוה שתי חמרא בכל מעלי יומא דפסחא כי\n  היכי דגריר לבא טובא:</p>\n  \n  <p>כל דצריך - שכל אדם יעשה עצמו כמו שצריך לאחרים לגבי פסח:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would indicate that we are not actually inviting guests as much as we are inviting ourselves and our family.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is purely opinion, but if you look at Ha Lachma Anya, the entire paragraph is simply four simple statements with no flowery language at all.  We state that we have in front of us the mataza for our seder, and refer to it as \"lachma anya\" which is frequently translated a\"bread of affliction\", certainly not a \"nice\" phrase, but it is completely accurate, and points out a primary Pesach mitzvah.  Our next statement invites all to join us in the mitzvah of both matzah and the korban pesach (the translation of the second clause that I read was \"those who require fellowship come an join us\", but the Hebrew might mean \"all who need, join us in our Pesach). I see these as directly connected.  We announce our intention to fulfill a mitzvah, and then tell all others within earshot to join us (in shul on Shabbat, I've certainly heard people say - \"I'm making kiddush, anyone need to be yotze?\" - similar feeling/intent).  You may not consider it the nicest language, but I hardly read it as focusing on desperation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I actually found this question was asked in the haggada Pilpula Charifta pg.37 in the name of the Hagaddas Korban Pesach written by Rav Gedalia Silverstone former Chief Rabbi of Belfast, Northern Ireland:</p>\n<p>He explains according the Gemara in Shabbos (127a) which says the Gedolah Hachnasas Orchim Yoser M'Kabalas Pnei Hashechina- Welcoming guests is greater than welcoming the divine presence. He asks why does it say \"Pnei Hashechina\" the \"face\" of the divine presence,  and not \"Kabalas Hashechina\" receiving the divine presence. He explains, that just like the face of G-d is so intense that the look at would kill man, so too with guests, as they are actually greater than receiving the shechina. With receiving guests comes the intensity  and seriousness of receiving G-d's presence. So, on Pesach night when we invite them in we actually say it with a bit of hesitancy in the fear of the possibility of not acting appropriately in the presence on G-d <em>i.e.</em> the guests.</p>\n\n\n",

When wet, densely packed nylon bristles of a\n  regular toothbrush are pressed against the teeth, many poskim consider\n  it is as if the water is squeezed out of the bristles and forbid using\n  a wet toothbrush. The rubber bristles of the Shabbos Toothbrush™ are\n  far enough apart that it is obvious that liquid does not get absorbed\n  into the bristles and is not squeezed out Shabbos Toothbrush's soft\n  rubber \"bristles\"</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Chavalah:</strong> Causing oneself to bleed on Shabbos is prohibited. Sharp nylon bristles of a regular toothbrush can cause gums to bleed. The\n  soft rounded rubber bristles of the Shabbos Toothbrush™ do not cause\n  bleeding. In the extremely rare case that very sensitive gums bleed\n  even with the Shabbos Toothbrush™, consult your local Rabbi and see\n  your dentist!</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Memareach:</strong> Spreading a cream or ointment onto an object used as an\n  applicator to the body is prohibited on Shabbos. Therefore, most\n  poskim prohibit use of regular toothpaste or gel applied to any\n  toothbrush. Kosher Innovations™  Shabbos Toothwash™ is a concentrated\n  liquid and this prohibition does not apply. We do not recommend using\n  the Shabbos Toothbrush™ with any product other than Kosher Innovations\n  Shabbos Toothwash™ Also, the Shabbos Toothwash™ is certified kosher by\n  the OU.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Uvdin D'Chol:</strong> If a regular activity involves something that one may not do on Shabbos, that activity will be classified as a “weekday\n  activity”. For some poskim who permit the use of a regular toothbrush\n  without toothpaste this prohibition would apply to using one's weekday\n  toothbrush and they require a separate and even distinctive toothbrush\n  for Shabbos.  The Kosher Innovations Shabbos Toothbrush™ was designed\n  specifically for Shabbos and not for weekday use, eliminating the\n  issue of Uvdin D'Chol according to all poskim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to a list found <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/20439/3073\">here</a>, <em>Sechitah</em> (whether a <em>Tolda</em> of <em>Dush</em> or <em>Melabain</em>) and <em>Memachaik</em> (a rabbinic prohibition based on <em>Memareach</em>) are forbidden on <em>Yom Tov</em>, while <em>Chavalah</em> (a <em>Tolda</em> of <em>Shochet</em>) and is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>If one has a unique toothbrush set aside for <em>Yom Tov</em> (to avoid an <em>Uvda D'Chol</em>) and does neither wet the toothbrush (to avoid <em>Sechitah</em>) nor apply toothpaste (to avoid <em>Memareach</em>), it would seem that the sole act of brushing the teeth with a standard toothbrush (even if it causes bleeding) would be permitted on Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>However, I have never seen or heard this stated explicitly. Neither has R' Yakov Farkas, a <em>Wiznitz</em>er <em>Dayan</em> in Montreal, but he could also not think of a reason it would be prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>Any sources?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>* They mistakenly call <em>Memareach</em> and <em>Uvda D'Chol</em> – which are rabbinic prohibitions – \"categories of prohibited melacha\".</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://shiurim.rabbibelovski.com/i/48.brushing%20teeth.shabbat.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://shiurim.rabbibelovski.com/i/48.brushing%20teeth.shabbat.pdf</a>  (And note all the source there)</p>\n\n<p>The English Summary at the bottom:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Given the number of distinct issues involved in brushing teeth, theoretically, there could be numerous opinions regarding which\n  issues we must be concerned with and which issues are not of concern to us.

The opinion of Rabbi Yosef Dov Halevi Soloveitchik and yibadel l’chaim tovim, his student Rabbi Hershel Schachter shlit\"a:\n  According to these poskim it is absolutely permissible to brush teeth on Shabbat with a wet toothbrush and toothpaste. It is also\n  permissible to wash the toothbrush ifter brushing.</p>\n  \n  <p>B. The opinion of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef shlit\"a: Rabbi Yosef maintains that one (specifically referring to Sefardim) may brush with a\n  wet toothbrush and toothpaste. However, one must set aside a separate toothbrush specifically for Shabbat use due to the concern\n  of uvda d’chol. It is also preferable not to wash the toothbrush after brushing due to concerns of hachanah.</p>\n  \n  <p>C. The opinion of Rabbis Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg and Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zt”l: One may not use regular toothpaste on\n  Shabbat due to concerns of mimarayach. However, it is perfectly permissible to use liquid toothpaste on the toothbrush, and brush\n  normally.</p>\n  \n  <p>D. The opinion of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein zt”l: One should not use toothpaste due to a problem of mimarayach, and should not wet\n  the toothbrush before using it due to a problem of sechita. The toothbrush should also not be washed off after brushing due to\n  problems of hachono. The best method of brushing, according to Rabbi Feinstein, is to put mouthwash or liquid toothpaste directly\n  into the mouth. One may then take a dry toothbrush and brush normally (provided that he is not certain to bleed). One should also\n  be careful not to wash the toothbrush after brushing (due to concerns of hachanah).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I heard from my local Orthodox Rabbi that it is permitted to brush one's teeth on Shabbos and Yom Tov with a dry toothbrush that is set aside for Shabbos/Yom Tov use.</p>\n\n<p>This is permitted even if your mouth is moist (with water or mouthwash) and even if it may (but is not very likely to) cause bleeding.</p>\n\n\n",

The essence of Shema is to fulfill the command “with all your heart”—meaning with both inclinations. This implies that a person must withstand anything that could hinder their love for G-d. The term “your heart” alludes to one’s wife and her children to whom their heart is naturally bound. “Your soul and might” is understood, literally, your life and sustenance—these, too, should not obstruct one’s devotion to G-d.</p>\n<p>But the question arises: how can a physical being, who is inherently tied to the material world, achieve such an intense love for G-d—one that nothing can get in the way of?</p>\n<p>To answer this, the sages introduced the blessing of Yotzer Or, which emphasizes the negation (or bittul) of all angels and heavenly beings. And so on.</p>\n<p>The second blessing, “You have loved us with an everlasting love,” follows. It describes how G-d, in His great compassion, set aside the celestial beings and caused His Shechinah (Divine Presence) to dwell among the Jewish people. This is expressed in the phrase “Exceedingly abounding compassion,” which speaks of a love and closeness from G-d that surpasses even His relationship with the heavenly hosts.</p>\n<p>“And You have chosen us from among all nations and tongues”; this refers to the material body, which in its physical form is similar to the bodies of the nations of the world. “And You have brought us near” etc.</p>\n\n\n",

The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=12371&rid=166\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beiras Hamayim</a> prefers to say that the Kesef Mishna means like Rashi, that for Torah SheBaal Peh, the son is expected to go learn on his own. So the father isn't obligated, rather the son is now old enough to do it himself (see further on the Shulchan Aruch HaRav who asks the obvious question on such a reading - nothing was written in those days, so how could he learn it himself?).</p>\n\n<p>For #2, The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=12371&rid=166\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beiras Hamayim</a> says one possibility is the Kesef Mishna means that the father can teach his son himself Torah SheBaal Peh, so there is no obligation to find another teacher (unlike Torah SheBeksav where there is a Takkana to establish a school - I think that is what he means), but he prefers #1.

The shank represents <em>chesed</em>, the egg represents <em>gevura</em>, and the marror represents <em>tiferet</em>. <em>Tiferet</em> connects <em>chesed</em> and <em>gevura</em>, and is always depicted as being between and slightly below the two. This is because kabbalistically, <em>chesed</em> and <em>gevura</em> are anthropomorphically depicted as the right and left hands, and <em>tiferet</em> is considered the torso (cf. <em>Zohar</em> 1:77b). </p>\n\n<p>I have never seen an Arizal seder plate done in the way you suggest, probably for that reason above. If you are looking for a source that specifically details the marror in the Arizal seder plate, here's R. Yisrael Bitan's commentary on the Yalkut Yosef Pesach (p. 313):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When arranging the Seder platter, however, the custom of the Sefardic Jews in the Land of Yisrael is to follow the instructions of the Arizal, and as the <em>Kaf Hahayim</em> Sofer cited from the <em>Etz Hayim</em>. Therefore, we place <em>maror</em> (endives) in the center of the platter and we position the lettuce on the side closest to to the leader of the Seder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The word באמצע doesn't refer to the middle of the Egg and Shank.  Rather, it refers to the middle of the plate (or the \"middle view\" of the one looking at the plate).  Traditional drawings of the 10 sefirot (of which six are listed here) generally place Tiferet slightly below Chesed (incidentally, several daleds in the quote above are written as lameds) and Gevurah.  See Sefer Yetzirah for a famous drawing in this fashion.  Further, to read the text the way you do would require the Chazeret to also be between the Carpas and Charoses, which your picture does not represent.</p>\n\n\n",

I've never seen anyone who tried to claim otherwise, but if you're seeing other descriptions in modern haggadot, my feeling is that the basic factor at play here is modern revisionism. With regard to leaving out the salt water, most of the other minhagim (Gra, Ari zl, etc) don't have salt water on the seder plate. Since most people do not follow the Rema's order for the seder plate, it's simply unusual. The only people I know of who have tried to keep the Rema's order are the Yekkes (German Jews). Since most people nowadays don't have the salt water on the seder plate, the authors of contemporary haggadot feel comfortable leaving it off \"because it's not done\" even if they're ignoring what the Rema actually said. Their goal is to give options that work for today's generation. As minhagim change, they print what they expect their audience to want.</p>\n\n<p>As for the matzot - it's a similar story. There isn't room on the modern seder plate for today's modern sized matzot (I have no idea what size matzot the Rema had - they may have been a different size back then). Therefore, people leave it off. Even the German Jews who tried to keep the Rema's arrangement <a href=\"http://www.kayj.net/en/forum/minhogim/1679-rema-seder-plate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">started making multi-layer seder plates</a> in order to keep the matzot on the seder plate technically, but not have them interfere with the other items. Since it's just not done anymore, many authors feel comfortable providing something which is more usable (in their mind) even if it's not technically accurate.</p>\n\n\n",

In most <em>hagadot</em> that I have seen, the phrasing says:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah.9.4?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sefaria.org used here</a></p>\n\n<p>הָיָה כּוֹרֵךְ מַצָּה וּמָרוֹר וְאוֹכֵל בְּיַחַד, לְקַיֵּם מַה שֶּׁנֶּאֱמַר: עַל מַצּוֹת וּמְרורִים יֹאכְלֻהוּ.</p>\n\n<p>He would wrap the matsa and <i>marror</i> and eat them together, in order to fulfill what is stated, (Exodus 12:15): \"You should eat it upon matsot and <i>marrorim</i>.\"</p>\n\n<p>However, in a number of Hagaddot, such as <em>Passover Haggadah: The Feast of Freedom\" The Rabbinical Assembly, 1982</em> and, I think Rav Riskin's Hagadah, IIRC, I have seen the phrasing:</p>\n\n<p>הָיָה כּוֹרֵךְ פסח מַצָּה וּמָרוֹר וְאוֹכֵל בְּיַחַד</p>\n\n<p>He would wrap the matsa and <i>marror</i> and Pesach sacrifice and eat them together</p>\n\n<p>To me, it seems that the 2nd version is correct, assuming that Hillel was doing things correctly, as he was supposed to eat the Pesach sacrifice and the verse says, \"On matzot and maror you shall eat <strong>it</strong>\"</p>\n\n<p>Yet, many hagaddot, don't mention the fact that he included the Pesach lamb. So are there various opinions as to what he actually did? What are the opinions based upon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I was taught that it is because we do not have the korbon Pesach any more that we do not mention it (out loud). That is why many haggados have the \"pesach\" in parentheses or as you show it without vowels. This is similar to the reason that we do not point to the seder plate when saying \"Pesach\" in the Rabban Gamliel said portion, while we say Matza Zu and point. Thus, the answer to your question (as I was taught) is that Hillel did put the korbon Pesach on Matza with Maror, but we just do not say it explicitly. </p>\n\n<p>I found this answer, which gives the basic statement as a preface to explaining the reason behind Hillel's custom.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ravkooktorah.org/PESACH_68.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Hillel Sandwich</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Together or separate? The Sages disagreed on how one should eat the\n  matzah and maror (bitter herbs) at the Passover Seder.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Talmud in Berachot 49a admonishes us not to perform mitzvot\n  'bundled together' (\"chavilot chavilot\"). We do not want to give the\n  impression that mitzvot are an unwanted burden, an obligation that we\n  wish to discharge as quickly as possible. For this reason, the\n  majority opinion is that the two mitzvot of eating matzah and maror\n  should be performed separately.</p>\n  \n  <p>But Hillel's custom was to place the pesach offering and the maror\n  inside the matzah and eat them together like a sandwich. Why did\n  Hillel combine these mitzvot together?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Most of the article has been omitted from the quote)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Discipline and Freedom</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Now we may better understand the disagreement between Hillel and the\n  other sages. Freedom, as symbolized by the matzah, reveals the\n  inherent holiness of Israel and our natural love for God and Torah.\n  This innate character enables us to overcome desires that do not\n  concur with our elevated goals. It is through our persistence and\n  dedication to the overall goal that we reveal our inner resources of\n  freedom.</p>\n  \n  <p>Both of these traits, freedom and servitude, need to be free to act\n  without interference from one another. When a spirit of freedom and\n  independence is appropriate, it should not be constrained by a servile\n  attitude; and when discipline and a sense of duty are needed, they\n  should not be disrupted by a desire for freedom. Thus, according to\n  the majority opinion, we should eat the matzah and maror separately,\n  indicating that each trait should be expressed to its fullest.</p>\n  \n  <p>The ultimate goal, however, is attained only when we recognize that\n  these two forces do not contradict one another. Joined together, they\n  present the highest freedom, whose nobility and power is fully\n  revealed when it wears the crown of lofty servitude — the service of\n  the Holy King, a service that is freedom in its purest state.</p>\n  \n  <p>Thus Hillel would eat the matzah and maror together. He sought to\n  emphasize that freedom and slavery are not contradictory concepts.\n  Generally speaking, the quality of servitude belongs more to the\n  preparatory stage; but in the overall picture, the two forces are\n  interrelated, complementing one another to attain the final goal.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Moshe Alshikh explains (there) that the calling out of the ravens refers to calling out to God.</p>\n\n<p>Indeed this is nearly explicit in Job (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt2738.htm#41\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">38:41</a>):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מִי יָכִין לָעֹרֵב,    צֵידוֹ:\n  כִּי-יְלָדָו, אֶל-אֵל יְשַׁוֵּעוּ;    יִתְעוּ, לִבְלִי-אֹכֶל. </p>\n  \n  <p>Who provideth for the raven his prey,\n  when his young ones cry unto God, and wander for lack of food?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, other commentators explain these verses differently. Regarding the first verse (Psalms 104:21),  Radak and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> (there) explain that this does not mean that they literally pray to God.</p>\n\n<p>In the words of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Kimhi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולבקש מאל אכלם, כי הוא נותן לחם לכל בשר בהשתלשלות הסיבות, וכאילו הם מבקשים ממנו אוכלם בבקשם טרפם</p>\n  \n  <p>And to request their food from God: For he provides food to all\n  beings, through the chain of events, <em>and it is as though</em> they\n  request their food from him, when they seek their prey.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> there explains that when it says that they request their food from God, it means they seek out their food from those species that God has designed for their consumption.</p>\n\n<p>In regards to the second verse (Psalms 145:15) as well, many commentators understand that \"all those who look to God for sustenance\" refers to humans; not animals. (Cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Karo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tol'dot Yitshak</a> to Leviticus 25:3).</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the third verse (Psalms 147:9), Radak (there) explains that the animals cry out \"<em>as though</em> to God\", but not actually to God.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the verse in Job (38:41), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Sa'adya Gaon</a> gives the exact same explanation (in his commentary to the verse); that they cry out \"as though to God\".</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Qafih</a> explains (in his edition of Rav Sa'adya Gaon's commentary to Job there), that Rav Sa'adya Gaon inserts the words \"as though\" since animals are not intelligent enough to pray.</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>, according to the understanding of the Rokeah, Alshikh, and Metsudat David, verses in Psalms indicate a certain connection the animals have with God, but according to the other commentators, these verses would be inconclusive. Indeed some such as Rav Sa'adya Gaon and Radak take pain to obviate this view.</p>\n\n\n",

The sash should not be confused with the embroidered belt of the ephod. Like the other priestly vestments, t<strong>he purpose of the sash was \"for glory and for beauty\"</strong> (Exodus 28:41). On the Day of Atonement the High Priest changed into special linen garments that included a sash of fine linen without any embroidery (Leviticus 16:4).

    "title": "Downvoting someone you don't know",
    "content": "# Downvoting someone you don't know\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Onaat devarim</em> is a biblical prohibition to commit verbal abuse (Bava Metzia 58b based on Vayikra 25:17 \"וְלֹא תוֹנוּ אִישׁ אֶת עֲמִיתוֹ וְיָרֵאתָ מֵאֱלֹקיךָ כִּי אֲנִי ה' אֱלֹקיכֶם\", \"one shall not aggrieve his fellow, and you shall fear your G-d, for I am Hashem your G-d.\"; Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat 228:1; Sefer Hamitzvot 251; Sefer Hachinuch 338). The Gemara and Shulchan Aruch say it is worse than <em>onaat mamon</em> (overcharging) because it can't be undone and it injures the person himself, not just his money. Rambam (Hilchot Deot 6:3; Hilchot Teshuva 3:14) writes that one who regularly shames others has no portion in the World to Come. Chazon Ish Letters volume 1 #211 says <em>onaat devarim</em> applies even if the discomfort is only momentary (see <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Hurting_Others%27_Feelings\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Hurting_Others%27_Feelings</a> ). </p>\n\n<p>A counterpoint to this ideal of \"<em>Torat Chessed</em>\" (Torah of Compassion) is that of the extremely high regard halacha places on the pursuit of truth and intellectual honesty (\"<em>Torat Emet</em>\"). The Maharshal infers from a passage in Bava Kamma that the principle of presenting <em>halacha</em> accurately is <em>yehareg v'al ya'avor</em> (worthy of martyrdom) even to the extent of endangering the Jewish nation as a whole. In fact, the Talmud is replete with examples where harsh (and seemingly personal) rhetoric is used in disputes of halacha, and the biting tongues of Torah scholars are famously compared to those of venomous serpents. (See also the famous dispute between Beis Hillel and Beis Shammai [כתובות ט\"ז ב] regarding how one handles the balance between honesty and avoiding offense.)</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, the internet/blogosphere has become a notorious forum for cyberbullying and anonymous harassment, even within the otherwise halachically-observant world and even in forums devoted to analysis of halacha and hashkafa, such as this one. This can sometimes be the case unintentionally where the \"victimizer\" is not even aware that he is inflicting suffering on his fellow. </p>\n\n<p>It is a frequent occurrence, on this forum as well as others, that a clearly less experienced poster submits an entry that is not particularly knowledgeable. My question is this:</p>\n\n<p>If one doesn't know very much about a poster (e.g. their education level, if they are emotionally vulnerable, if they are a child), is it permitted <em>halachically</em> to e.g. \"downvote\" a question or answer they have posted, whether on this forum or any other?</p>\n\n<p>[It was suggested that this question is a duplicate of another that discusses the ramifications of \"down-voting\" with regard to the prohibition of <em>lashon hara</em>. However, these are 2 completely different prohibitions with different laws. Furthermore, while the accepted answer there does cite a view that is possibly relevant to the question of down-voting between peers, it tells us little regarding where a down-vote might be (mis)interpreted as hurtful by a child or new user.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>According to Rambam, the prohibition of ona'at d'varim is specifically in a case where one intends to hurt the subject. Accordingly, in this case, if the point of the downvote is not to hurt the subject, then the prohibition would not be violated. In this vein, Rambam writes in Perush HaMishna to Bava Metsia (4:10) that onaat d'varim is insidious, for only the speaker knows his own intent and knows whether he intended to hurt, or not. For this reason, the Torah says in regards to onaat d'varim: \"And you shall fear your God\" (Leviticus 25:17), for only God knows your intent:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>האדם יכול לעשותה בתחבולה כגון שעומד על המחיר והוא אינו קונה, ואומר אין דעתי אלא לקנות. או שיציע לאדם שאינו מלומד דבר חכמה ויאמר לו הסבר לי דבר זה <strong>כדי לביישו</strong>, ויאמר אני חשבתי שהוא מאנשי החכמה. או שיספר ספור ויכלול בו מגרעות איזה אדם ומומיו, ויאמר אני לא נתכוונתי למה שחשבתם. לפיכך אמר <strong>ויראת מאלהיך היודע כוונותיך ומחשבותיך</strong>, וזהו ענין אמרם כל דבר שהוא מסור ללב נאמר בו ויראת מאלהיך </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Similarly, in Hilkhot Teshuva (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1507.htm#10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">7:10</a>) in describing the prohibition of onaat dvarim, he writes: \"reminding a penitent of his former deeds, <em>in order to embarrass him</em>\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>חטא גדול הוא לומר לבעל תשובה זכור מעשיך הראשונים או להזכירם בפניו <em>כדי לביישו</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the opinion of R. Elhanan Wasserman as well (who generalises this to all interpersonal mitsvot) He writes in Kovets Ha’arot (Yevamot: 70):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולולי דבריהם היה נראה, דכל האיסורין שבין אדם לחבירו אינן איסורין אלא דרך קילקול והשחתה שלא לצורך...וכן בלאו דאונאת דברים, מותר להקניטו בדברים דרך תוכחה, וכן מותר להלבין פנים דרך תוכחה...ומוכח מכ\"ז, דכל האיסורין האלו הותרו לצורך תועלת </p>\n  \n  <p>If not for their words, it would appear that all interpersonal prohibitions, are only forbidden in the context of degrading and tarnishing others for no purpose...And similarly with the prohibition of <em>onaat d'varim</em> [verbal abuse] it is permissible to hurt him verbally as part of rebuking him, and it is similarly permissible to humiliate him as part of rebuke...And it is evident from all this that all of these prohibition are permitted to achieve an end. (Trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That being said, although according to their view the prohibition would not be violated, it goes without saying that you should do everything possible to \"love one's fellow as one's own\" (Leviticus 19:18) and to avoid hurting others. In this case, this could perhaps be accomplished by explaining to new users how the site works, how voting works, why you voted a you did, and explaining that the intent is not ad hominem.</p>\n\n\n",

(Although as an exception, I've seen a Yemenite Chazan use some of these sounds while reading the Torah).</p>\n<p>Does the particular phonetic makeup of the language mean that only the included sounds are capable of being holy? Is there some other significance to it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First of all, Yemenites, Iraqis, and some other Mizrahim (‘sup) preserve the Minhag that developed in Late Biblical Hebrew and was widespread until the Late Masoretic Era, to pronounce all the soft בגדכפת letters distinctly, which includes pronouncing ת without a dagesh as /th/. They also preserve the very ancient pronunciation of ו as /w/</p>\n<p>In Biblical Hebrew, before the exile, there were no soft letters. So no bh/v, gh, dh, kh, ph/f, or th. All six letters only had their “hard” pronunciations.</p>\n<p>Additionally, ו was always W, never V. ז, ד, and ת were on the teeth instead of the roof of the mouth. ח and ע each had two pronunciations—one like Mizraħim pronounce them, and the other slightly fronted. ט, צ, and ק were also pronounced the Mizrahi way. ר could have been a Spanish tap normally but an Italian trill when geminated (דגש חזק), universally an Italian trill, or universally a French trill. Sin was different from ס; air was directed around the sides of the tongue. In the Gileadite dialect of early Biblical Hebrew, Shin was pronounced /th/ in some words (e.g. אשר, שלש, שְנַים), and /sh/ in others; but in most dialects, Shin was always /sh/ (as it is now). In some less-widespread dialects, probably around eastern Samaria or northern Judaea, ז was the voiced /th/ (like in “bathe” or “the”) in certain words (e.g. זהב, זה, זבח).</p>\n<p>If only these sounds are “holy”, and other sounds can’t be, we’re in trouble. Almost nobody pronounces the letters in their original form. I’m going to assume (i.e. I know) that Hashem planned for these inevitable changes, and still accepts our תפִלּות and לִימוד תורה.</p>\n<p>This probably means that non-Hebrew sounds have the potential, at least, to be holy.<br />\nAnother possibility—I don’t know the source at the moment, but I recall reading that angels fix mistakes in pronunciation as they take our words to שמים. If non-Hebrew sounds are <em>not</em> holy, this may be the way Hashem accepts our Hebrew service.<br />\nEither way, Hashem knows what He’s doing.</p>\n<p>As for the significance: As I write this, I’m not yet a Kabbalist, and I doubt most people on this site are either. But I do know that each letter corresponds to a certain fundamental abstract concept. So the original sound of each letter is likely connected in some way to its fundamental meaning. Using ו as an example, something about the /w/ sound has to do with connecting things (like a וַו, the Hebrew word for hook).</p>\n<p>On a similar note, maybe sounds that didn’t exist in Biblical Hebrew correspond to non-existent concepts that were never created. Or maybe they don’t correspond to any “unborn” potential concepts, and the fact that those sounds exist at all is simply a result of the shape of the human mouth. Or maybe they do correspond to concepts that <em>were</em> actually created, but those concepts weren’t necessary for the creation of anything else. Those are three theories for you off the top of my head.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Quoting R' Avraham DeBalmash: \"lashon hakodesh contains all possible movements of the mouth, but there is controversy as to what letter signifies which sound\", on which he elaborates between differrent methods.</p>\n<p>The yemenites have (some of them at least) kept the original pronounciation intact,\nwhere today many if not most Jews have lost some of the more obscure and uncommon sounds in their native country to an extent.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According the to answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143679/36610\">here</a> Hebrew alphabet sounds were selected by Avraham avinu who knew 70 languages of the world.

    "content": "# Why is there a guilt offering and not a sin offering for slander?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I read this on Chabad.org in its discussion of Parshat Vayikra:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>• The different types of “sin offering” (chatat) brought to atone for\n  transgressions committed erroneously by the high priest, the entire\n  community, the king or the ordinary Jew;</p>\n  \n  <p>• The “guilt offering” (asham) brought by one who has misappropriated\n  property of the Sanctuary, who is in doubt as to whether he\n  transgressed a divine prohibition, or who has committed a “betrayal\n  against G‑d” by swearing falsely to defraud a fellow man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It seems that the <em>asham</em>, or guilt offering, applies to a lesser category of sins than the sin offering, <em>chatat</em>. For example, <em>asham</em> is used when there is merely a suspicion that a sin has been committed. However, it is odd to me to find the sin of slander, which is generally considered a fundamental Jewish transgression--and, along with stealing, a breach of the Ten Commandments--listed among these \"second-class\" sins. </p>\n\n<p>What are some interpretations for why this is so? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question contains two incorrect assumptions. </p>\n\n<p>One incorrect assumption is that a guilt offering (<em>korban asham</em>) is less serious than a sin offering (<em>korban chatas</em>). The Ramban 5:15 indicates that the opposite is true, and the Rama (O.C. 603:1) actually quotes as accepted halakha: one must expend greater effort in repenting from a sin that he might have committed than for one that he know for certain that  he has committed.</p>\n\n<p>Second is the issue of \"slander\". From google: \"slander (n.): the action or crime of making a false spoken statement damaging to a person's reputation\". This is not mentioned in the verse whatsoever; the case of \"defrauding\" that is referred to by the Torah here is where someone swears that he is not holding onto the property of his fellow man, when he actually is. </p>\n\n<p>Either way, the main point of the sacrifice is to help the repentant person atone for defrauding his fellow, not for the misuse of God's name. (I say that because intentionally swearing falsely, in general, is subject to the punishment of lashes; see Temurah 3b - even though one has to bring an extra sacrifice for each denial only if it includes a swearing). Thus, the sacrifice isn't such a big deal, because the main idea for repentance here is that the person return the property that he denied. However, because it's still inappropriate for someone to think that they can just deny having someone's property and give it back later, the Torah requires a sacrifice to be brought as well.

El simply means strenght\n(as in mighty one). Elohim or Eloahim is derived from Eloah, the\nplural of Eloah is Eloahi. However, both Eloahi and Elohim are the\nplurals of Eloah, but Eloahi is simple plural (Jurors) while Elohim is\na collective plural noun (Jury). Most dictionaries states that a\ncollective plural noun is a ‘singular noun denoting a group of\nindividuals’. Apparently, Elohim (Eloahim) and Elohi (Eloahi) is used\ninterchangeably. That is, where Elohim is said to be in DUE 6:4 it can\nalso read Eloahi or some say it reads that. Eloahi is also often\ntranslated Elohe. Nevertheless, as stated, the plural form can be used\nfor a singular subject, that is, one person, to denote majesty; as is\nthe case with using Elohim for G-d.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When I was doing research for my newly-released book <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NO4jLy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">God versus Gods: Judaism in the Age of Idolatry</a></em> (Mosaica Press, 2018), I looked into this question and found some important sources. @Zeev wrote in a comment to the question to look at the Abarbanel. What he writes is long and complicated (exactly how the Abarbanel usually writes), but here's my attempt at summarizing what he says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hashem has two main names: One is the Tetragrammaton which is His\n  “personal” name and refers to His infinite being, which cannot be\n  described nor comprehended. The other name is El, which denotes His\n  power and influence over creation. Because the latter name does not\n  describe Him “personally”, the Bible usually complements the name El\n  with elements of His “personal” name. This combination can result in\n  three types of compound names/descriptions of Hashem: When the first\n  two letters of the Tetragrammaton are added to El, the resulting word\n  is Elohei (א-להי), which is the construct form of the word god (i.e.,\n  “god of…”). When the last two letters of the Tetragrammaton are added\n  to El, the resultant is Eloah (א-לוה), which literally means “god”.\n  The third word, Elohim, is essentially the first compound with a mem\n  (מ) appended in order to differentiate the definitive form from the\n  construct form, so that א-להים means “god” as opposed to “god of…”.\n  Based on all of this, Abarbanel explains that Elohim was not borrowed\n  from another context in order to serve as another word for God.\n  Rather, Elohim primarily refers to God, and was borrowed from that\n  context to also refer to angels who also influence the world (in a\n  God-like way, albeit with limitations).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding why the word Elohim seems to be in plural form, I found a bunch of sources on this, and it is actually related to the Abarbanel I mentioned above: </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Ibn Ezra and R. Bachaya (to Gen. 1:1) write that the word Elohim is in plural form because it is an expression of honor to refer to an individual as if he were many. Abarbanel (to Gen. 1:1) questions this explanation by noting that the Bible also uses the word Elohim to mean idols; if Ibn Ezra is correct, then why are idols also referred to in plural if they are not due the same honor afforded to Hashem. </li>\n<li><p>R. Yehudah ha-Levi writes (Kuzari 4:1) that the word Elohim is in plural form because it is borrowed from the “gods” of the idolaters who generally worshipped a set of gods. </p></li>\n<li><p>Nachmanides (to Gen. 1:1) writes that the word Elohim is a portmanteau of the two words el (אל, power) and heim (הם, they are). He explains that according to this, the name Elohim refers to God’s role as the source of all powers and abilities. Abarbanel (to Gen. 1:1) cites this explanation in order to explain why the word Elohim seems to be in plural form. Accordingly, he understood that Nachmanides means to explain that Elohim is in plural because God is the holder of all powers. However, Abarbanel notes that this explanation fails to account for the extra letter yud (י) found in the name Elohim. </p></li>\n<li>R. Bachaya (to Gen. 1:1) addresses the extra yud by attaching to it some mysterious Kabbalistic implications, which he refuses to explain. R. Menachem Tziyyoni (as cited by Sefer Naphtali to R. Bachaya there) explains that the letter yud—which holds the numerical value of of ten—alludes to the Ten Sefiroth significant in Kabbalistic writings; see also R. Moshe Isserles’ Toras ha-Olah (3:4). </li>\n<li>In line with his abovementioned explanation, Abarbanel contends that the seemingly plural ending of the word Elohim is merely incidental, the mem at the end of the word simply serves to draw a difference between the construct form of the word god and the definitive form of the word. See also R. Meir Al-Dabi’s Shvilei Emunah (Nesiv #1) and R. Moshe of Trani’s Beis Elohim (Shaar ha-Yesodos, chs. 4–6).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>El means power.  It is used as a descriptiona as well as a name for G-d, humans, angels and even pagan gods. The plural of el is elim (powers or gods), and not “elohim.\"  Hebrew  has a full conjugation (with different forms for 1st, 2nd and 3rd person, singular and plural, masculine and feminine).  </p>\n\n<p>A noun by itself isn't plural (so an \"im\" ending doesn't always mean the word is plural -- it may just denote power). It is the verb which indicates the word’s plurality.  In Hebrew a single word does not make a sentence singular or plural, and often the use of ים is found in words that are obviously singular.   Elohim ends with the masculine plural suffix \"ים”.</p>\n\n<p>All of that is to state that the word \"elohim\" isn't automatically plural.  The singular of Elohim is: Elo'ah, which can used to stress the Oneness even more then the seemingly plural elohim, without the limitations and “many-ness” (of each individual power) which could be inferred by: el.</p>\n\n<p>The Sforno says that eloha focuses on the eternal nature of G-d, “eternity”, and el stresses decisiveness, capability, and active will.</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides (the Rambam usually) prefers \"elo'ah\" as opposed to elohim. The T'nach, on the other hand, believes in the total Unity of elohim with such monotheistic clarity when used to speak of HaShem, that it usually uses elohim more than elo'ah, to davka stress the Unity without suspecting any kind of confusion or plurality. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What caused God?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently came across <a href=\"http://dovbear.blogspot.co.il/2009/12/is-it-rational-to-believe-that-god.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this webpage</a>, in which I read the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You say everything needs a cause, right? So what caused the 1st cause? Why is the 1st cause the exception to the rule? Maybe the universe itself is the exception to the rule?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It makes it easier if you read the whole back-and-forth to understand what is happening here, but, in essence the question is: If everything needs a cause, then what caused God?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>here is a quote of the Manoach Halevavos commentary on the Shaar Yichud ch.5</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>That which a thing cannot make itself applies only to something\n  created but that which is Kadmon (eternal, without beginning) and\n  infinite, behold, in truth, it did not make itself. This is the reason\n  why the question of \"how did G-d make Himself?\" is not relevant.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>i.e. only the non-eternal needs a cause.</p>\n\n<p>The next question is can the universe be eternal?</p>\n\n<p>The Shaar Yichud discusses the conditions which disqualify something from being possibly eternal. ex.not composite, no boundaries, no \"properties\", ex. natural laws, etc.</p>\n\n<p>(best not to get too much involved in rational investigation though, as this inherently leads to doubts. be simple with God)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The definition of G0d is the \"Primal cause\", which means that there can be nothing before it. If a \"creator\" had to have a creator itself, then it is a creation which was used as a method by the creator. This is known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Turtles all the way down\"</a> argument. That is the problem with the attempt to claim that everything requires a creator.  At some point, one must realize that there is a primal cause which is outside the rules of the Universe, because by definition, anything inside the Universe , subject to \"natural law\" is a creation.</p>\n\n<p>That is why the question as asked is meaningless. It is similar to arguments as to \"how old is the Universe\" or \"What happened before creation\", or any similar question.</p>\n\n<p>That is, if a \"creator\" is assumed to be within the Universe and subject to the \"laws of Nature\", then it will automatically lead to infinite regression. Once the infinite regression occurs, there is no way of determining how this chain began. However, according to the logic of the argument, the Universe requires a starting point for the chain of \"creators\". Thus the original creator (or G0d) must be outside the Universe and not subject to its \"laws of Nature\".</p>\n\n<p>Also note that this states that the existence of an original creator or Primal Cause is treated as an axiom. If one wants to assume that the universe never had a beginning, then that is a different (and false) argument. The reason that I say that it is a false argument is because the physical laws of nature show that there had to be a beginning (which we currently identify as the Big bang). Even if something existed before the Big Bang, then we have to see what caused that to come into existence.</p>\n\n<p>The actual point is that no matter how or when the Universe is assumed to have developed, it says nothing about creation. G0d could have created it with this message on your computer screen while you are reading these words. Similarly G0d could have created the universe 5 seconds, minutes, hours, months, years, decades, centuries, millenia, eons, ago. Those who argue against the existence of G0d because of fossils are just as wrong as those who argue against the existence of evolution because of creation from nothing. This says nothing about the “G0d in the gaps”, it just says that in order to allow us to have free will, G0d deliberately allows ambiguities.</p>\n\n<p>A famous example is the splitting of the Reed Sea during the exodus from Egypt. The bible explicitly states that G0d caused a wind the entire night before in order to open up the path. Modern science has discovered a reef in the sea at the point that they think the exodus occurred that a 60 mile per hour wind blowing all night would uncover and allow people to cross. Some of them them said that this “proves” that G0d does not exist. After all, if G0d existed, then it would have been done like Cecil B. DeMille showed it and not by a “natural wind”. They ignore the fact that this wind occurred exactly at the right time and place to let the Israelites escape and that it stopped blowing just in time to drown the Egyptian army.</p>\n\n<p>Here is a site that makes <a href=\"http://www.tgdaily.com/general-sciences-features/51655-strong-winds-could-have-parted-red-sea-for-moses\" rel=\"nofollow\">that claim</a></p>\n\n<p>For example see my post at <a href=\"http://sabbahillel.blogspot.com/2011/10/breishis-creationism-and-evolutionism.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Creationism and Evolutionism</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When people ask what brought God they are playing with words. When we say that everything has to have a cause, that is because we are discussing 'created items'. By this I mean that we are looking at something that is a composite, so we know that its pieces are brought together from outside of itself. In other words, most items we look at are products. A product, by definition, is a product of something else.</p>\n\n<p>When we talk about Hashem being Kadmon we are introducing the concept of מחויב המציאות, a required existence. The current working assumption of science and all other disciplines is that the natural state of existence is null (law of entropy). Anything that exists is a disturbance of the natural state of null. This leads to the question of what would cause anything to come about. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, we say that the natural state is the opposite of nothing — everything. Not a product or a composite, but a wholesome All. This is what, or rather who, we are calling The Creator. There too there is no room for any creations, since they are only a negative in this setting. However, once we understand that this Natural, Wholesome, All is conscious, this too can be understood. The only question left is why, indeed were we created? This is addressed many times over. </p>\n\n\n",

A traditional Chasidic story\n  speaks glowingly of the prayer of an uneducated Jew who wanted to pray\n  but did not speak Hebrew. The man began to recite the only Hebrew he\n  knew: the alphabet. He recited it over and over again, until a rabbi\n  asked what he was doing. The man told the rabbi, \"The Holy One,\n  Blessed is He, knows what is in my heart. I will give Him the letters,\n  and He can put the words together.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>There are many good reasons for praying in Hebrew: it gives you an\n  incentive for learning Hebrew, which might otherwise be forgotten; it\n  provides a link to Jews all over the world; it is the language in\n  which the covenant with G-d was formed, etc. To me, however, the most\n  important reason to pray in Hebrew is that Hebrew is the language of\n  Jewish thought.</p>\n  \n  <p>Any language other than Hebrew is laden down with the connotations of\n  that language's culture and religion. When you translate a Hebrew\n  word, you lose subtle shadings of Jewish ideas and add ideas that are\n  foreign to Judaism. Only in Hebrew can the pure essence of Jewish\n  thought be preserved and properly understood. For example, the English\n  word \"commandment\" connotes an order imposed upon us by a stern and\n  punishing G-d, while the Hebrew word \"mitzvah\" implies an honor and\n  privilege given to us, a responsibility that we undertook as part of\n  the covenant we made with G-d, a good deed that we are eager to\n  perform.</p>\n  \n  <p>This is not to suggest that praying in Hebrew is more important than\n  understanding what you are praying about. If you are in synagogue and\n  you don't know Hebrew well enough, you can listen to the Hebrew while\n  looking at the translation. If you are reciting a prayer or blessing\n  alone, you should get a general idea of its meaning from the\n  translation before attempting to recite it in Hebrew. But even if you\n  do not fully understand Hebrew at this time, you should try to hear\n  the prayer, experience the prayer, in Hebrew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Studying the Written Torah in English\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In terms of fulfilling the Mitzvah of Talmud Torah, when studying the Written Torah, must one learn the translation in tandem with the Hebrew words? Or is it sufficient to understand the meaning, messages and translation of the Written Torah without reading the Hebrew that it's written in?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam writes fairly emphatically in a <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Iggerot_HaRambam.7.5?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">responsum</a> that Torah study depends not upon the Hebrew language, but upon the intent of the words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואין הפרש שהבין אותו הענין מלשון קודש או מלשון ערבי או מלשון ארמי הכונה היא הבנת ענינים בכל לשון שיהיה</p>\n  \n  <p>There is no difference if he understood the matter in L'shon Hakodesh (Hebrew), or in Arabic, or in Aramaic.

In fact it wasn't even available in Hebrew. Thus it wouldn't make sense for this statement to be about the PH in particular. Rather, it seems to be a universal statement.</p>\n\n<p>As with any text the original often conveys nuances that translations don't carry. (It is for this reason that Rambam writes in the responsum that his Mishne Torah will not be translated to Arabic.) Therefore, everyone would certainly agree that there is value in learning Torah texts (be they Torah, Mishna, Gemara, or anything else) in their original, in that this will further ones appreciation of them. Nevertheless, the implication of the Rambam is that the mitzva is fulfilled with trans. as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Berachot 13a says that there is a dispute about whether the Torah was given in Lashon ha-Kodesh or in every language. The Shitah Mekubetzet ibid. cites the Ra'avad who explains that the question is about Torah study: if the Torah was given in every language, one can study it in every language, but if it was not, then one only fulfills והגית בו יומם ולילה in Lashon ha-Kodesh.  </p>\n\n<p>ואם תאמר ומאי נפקא לן מינה אי בלשון הקודש נאמרה או בכל לשון, <strong>אי לשינון בכל לשון ששינה וקורא יצא</strong>. ורש\"י ז\"ל פירש פרק ב' דמגלה דנפקא מינה לענין לקרות בספר תורה בבית הכנסת... אבל הראב\"ד ז\"ל כתב וזה לשונו: הא דדייקינן מרבנן על התורה אם נאמרה בכל לשון אם לא לא על הכתיבה שכתב משה נאמרה שהכל יודעים שלא נכתבה בספר אלא בלשון הקדש ולא נכתבו שאר לשונות אלא על האבנים שבגלגל כדכתיב באר היטב. אלא על התלמוד שלמדו הקדוש ברוך הוא למשה ומשה למד אותה לישראל לפי שהיו בהם גרים משאר לשונות [נסתפק לנו] אם <strong>היה מלמדה לכל אחד ואחד בלשונו וכן כל אחד ואחד יוצא ידי שינון בלשונו או שמא לכולם שונה בלשון הקדש ואין אדם יוצא ידי והגית בו אלא בלשון הקדש</strong></p>\n\n<p>R. Meir Soloveitchik (cited in Chiddushei Ha-Griz, Sotah 33a) explains that the Ra'avad does not intend to say that if the Torah was not given in other languages then one doesn't fulfill the mitzvah of Talmud Torah, because obviously one fulfill the mitzvah regardless;  learning in another language is no worse than thinking about learning, with which one fulfills the mitzvah. Rather, the Ra'avad is referring to another aspect of the mitzvah which is fulfilled merely by reading the words. Whether one fulfills this additional aspect in another language depends on whether the Torah was given in other languages: </p>\n\n<p>ודברי הראב\"ד צ\"ב במש\"כ דלרבנן דכה\"ת כולה בלשה\"ק נאמרה אין אדם יוצא יד\"ח והגית בו אלא בלה\"ק, והרי זה פשוט דבכל לשון יוצא יד\"ח מצות ת\"ת, דהא לא גרע מהרהור בד\"ת דפשוט דיוצא בו יד\"ח מצות ת\"ת, וכן כשלומד תורה שבע\"פ יוצא בו יד\"ח מצות ת\"ת. והנראה מבואר בזה דחוץ מקיום מצות ת\"ת, נאמר עוד דכשקורא ד\"ת, דין ותורת קריאה עלה, ונאמר בה דינים מסויימים, וממילא לרבנן כשקורא בשאר לשונות, אף דאיתקיימא ביה מצות ת\"ת, מ\"מ לא יצא יד\"ח \"והגית בו\", דהוא דין ותורת קריאה דרק בלשון הקודש יש דין ותורת קריאה עלה, אבל בשאר לשונות לא הוי שם ותורת קריאה עלה...מהג\"ר מאיר הלוי סאלאווייציק שליט\"א, והסכים עמו בזה אביו מרן הגרי\"ז זצ\"ל</p>\n\n<p>Tosafot in Berachot 13a says that according to the view that the Torah was given in every language it means that each word of God \"divided\" into seventy languages: בכל לשון נאמרה בסיני שכל דבור ודבור שהיה יוצא מפי הקב\"ה היה מתחלק לשבעים לשון. The Keren Orah in Sotah 33a explains that the ramification of whether the Torah was given in Lashon ha-Kodesh or not according to this view is whether one fulfills the mitzvah of Talmud Torah in other languages: </p>\n\n<p>והיה נראה לומר דלענין מצות ת\"ת קאמר דעיקר מצות הלימוד הוא המקרא, ולחד מ\"ד אין מברכין אלא על המקרא. כדאיתא בברכות פ\"ק (י\"א ע\"ב). ומספקא לן בהא אי קיים המצוה בכל לשון, או דווקא בלה\"ק. אלא דגם בזה אין לספק אלא בכתיבתה היכי היא, דבע\"פ אסור ללמוד מקרא. ועדיין צ\"ע בזה</p>\n\n<p>See also the Meiri in Berachot who explains the Gemara along these lines as well: </p>\n\n<p>אף כל התורה בכל לשון נאמרה כלומר שאע\"פ שבלשון הקודש נאמרה מפי הקב\"ה למשה וממשה לישראל וכן שאם נכתבה בלשון אחר אין בו קדושה <strong>מ\"מ על מנת כן נאמרה שיהא שנונה או למודה מותר בכל לשון ויוצא בו ידי הגיית יום ולילה</strong> ואע\"פ שבמסכת סוטה נאמרו קצת דברים שהם טעונין לשון הקדש כגון מקרא בכורים וכו' מ\"מ קריאת התורה דרך כלל אין למדין אותה ממצוה פרטית וכו' ולפי דרכך למדת בפי' הסוגיא לימא קסברי רבנן <strong>שהתורה בלשון קדש נאמרה פירושה שאין שנונה ולמודה בכל לשון פוטרתו מידי הגיית יומם ולילה</strong> </p>\n\n\n",

Each asks a question in his own way, and receives an appropriate answer.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Mishnah in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=116&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pesachim 116a</a> teaches:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They pour him the second cup, and here the child asks (and if the child doesn't know how, his father teaches him): Why is this night different from all other nights? For on all other nights...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This clearly indicates that the child must ask these questions. This is also brought down in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2251\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim 473:7</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Why don't we follow the procedure indicated in the <em>Hagaddah</em>, where a child asks a question he thinks of? Why do we require each child to ask the same four specific questions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Talmud you cite states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר ליה רב נחמן לדרו עבדיה: עבדא דמפיק ליה מריה לחירות ויהיב ליה כספא ודהבא, מאי בעי למימר ליה? אמר ליה: בעי לאודויי ולשבוחי. אמר ליה: פטרתן מלומר מה נשתנה. פתח ואמר עבדים היינו.‏<br>\n  R. Nahman asked his slave Daru: ‘When a master liberates his slave and gives him gold and silver, what should he say to him?’ ‘He should thank and praise him,’ replied he. ‘You have excused us from saying \"Why [is this night] different?\"’ observed he. [Thereupon] he  commenced by reciting, ‘We were slaves.’ (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And on the previous page it states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אביי הוה יתיב קמיה דרבה, חזא דקא מדלי תכא מקמיה. אמר להו: עדיין לא קא אכלינן, אתו קא מעקרי תכא מיקמן? אמר ליה רבה: פטרתן מלומר מה נשתנה.‏<br>\n  Abaye was sitting before Rabbah, [when] he saw the tray taken up from before him. Said he to then: We have not yet eaten, and they have [already] come [and] removed the tray from before us! Said Rabbah to him: You have exempted us from reciting, ‘Why [is this night] different? (Soncino translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While Tosfot there (surprisingly) understands the Gemara's story with Abaye to have 'implied' the continuation of the formal text of Mah Nishtana, Rashbam understands the Gemara simply. Indeed Maharil writes about Seder night (<em>Minahgim</em>, Order of the Haggada):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כוס שני מוזגין בבא לומר מה נשתנה. ואמר מהר\"י סג\"ל כדי שישאלו התינוקות מה מוזגין עוד לשתות כולי האי ולא אוכלין מידי. ואם שואל אין צ\"ל מה נשתנה ויתחיל עבדים היינו אם ירצה... אמר מהר\"י סג\"ל שבנימוקי רבינו שמחה כתב אם יש שם קטן השואל לו ולמה הגבהת הקערה אז אינו אומר כל ההגדה, וראיה בגמ' דאמר התם פטרתנו לומר מה נשתנה... והעיד מהר\"י סג\"ל על חמיו מהר\"ר משה כ\"ץ פעם אחת שאלתו בתו אבא למה הגבהת הקערה, והתחיל עבדים היינו ולא אמר מה נשתנה.‏<br>\n  The second cup is mixed when he comes to say Mah Nishtana. And Maharil said it's to prompt the children to ask \"Why are we mixing to drink so much and not eating anything?\" And if he asks there is no need to say Mah Nishtana and he can start with \"We were slaves...\" if he wants.... Maharil said that he found in comments of R Simcha that if the child asks \"Why did you pick up the bowl?\" then you don't have to say the whole Haggada, as seen from the Gemara [referenced above].... And Maharil testified about his father-in-law R Moshe Katz that one time his daughter asked him \"Abba, why did you life up the bowl?\" and he started \"We were slaves...\" and he didn't say Mah Nishtana. (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Shulchan Arukh you cite, ruling like Maharil, states:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מוזגין לו מיד כוס שני, כדי שישאלו התינוקות למה שותים כוס שני קודם סעודה. ואם אין חכמה בבן, אביו מלמדו. אם אין לו בן, אשתו שואלתו; ואם לאו, הוא שואל את עצמו. ואפילו תלמידי חכמים שואלים זה לזה: מה נשתנה וכו' <em>(וכשהבן או האשה שואלת, אין צריך לומר: מה נשתנה, אלא מתחיל עבדים)</em><br>\n  They prepare for him a second cup so the children will ask \"Why are we drinking a second cup before the meal?\" And if the son isn't wise [to ask that] the father teaches him [to]. And if he has no son, his wife asks him. And if he has no [wife], he asks himself. Even two scholars [who are alone] must ask each other [questions such as] \"Mah Nishtana etc.\" (<em>And if the son or wife asks, there is no need to say \"Mah Nishtana etc.\", rather they start with \"We were slaves etc.\"</em>) (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Any question works. Kids like singing Mah Nishtana because they learn it at school, and I'm not going to make them upset just before story-time by not letting them sing. Plus, for better or for worse, people like regularity and tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

If someone tries to do that, it <em>proves</em> that he is a false prophet. As is mentioned in the comments on the question, the Quran as revealed by Mohammad permits eating camel. Since this is explicitly prohibited in the Torah, it proves that Mohammad is a false prophet. This is just one example of statements in the Quran that contradict the Torah. Each and every one of those contradictions is sufficient to dismiss the possibility of Mohammad's prophethood.</p>\n\n\n",

And the halacha is, you need to come forward.\"</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Belkin quoted a Gemara in which the Jewish court issues a summons for Joe Shmoe to appear. The Gemara discusses the process if Joe refuses the summons. Waitaminute, said Rabbi Belkin! So the rabbis sent Shmerel the Messenger with the summons. Joe took the summons, tore it in two, and spat in Shmerel's face. Then ... Shmerel -- aha! Shmerel reported what happened back to the rabbis!

A Jewish \"rationalist\" would, however, be inclined toward the style of those two Ba'alei Mesorah rather than, say, Tanya or the Zohar for handling things like metaphysics and miracles.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: a rationalist would tend to ignore metaphysics as not empirically observable by humans, so it can't really be ascertained or meaningfully discussed. Historical miracles would be handled in the fashion of the Rambam - as engineered \"coincidences\" of a grand scope that utilize the rules of nature for uncanny results.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://finkorswim.com/2013/12/09/what-is-rationalist-judaism/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's</a> a good discussion of things from the rationalist point of view. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_philosophy#Jewish_philosophy_before_Maimonides\" rel=\"nofollow\">wikipedia page on Jewish philosophy</a> delves into this divide between traditionalist and \"rationalist\" thinking.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rationalism in Jewish sense is in not philosophical rationalism but, rather a tool. In analyzing Jewish tradition as there have been many different forms Conservative, Reform, Orthodox, Modern Orthodox, Haredi, and Hasidic. The rationalist in any of these is more of trying to separate falsehoods from truths with the use of reason. </p>\n\n<p>\"The biggest stumbling block to love of God is the belief that the only way to remain true to the Bible is to interpret it literally. The result of literal interpretation is a material conception of God, which, in Maimonides’ opinion, amounts to idolatry.\" (Maimonides Stanford Encyclopedia)</p>\n\n<p>For example, concerning G-d's incorporeality Rambam talks about how some Jews can make the simple mistake of G-d's being corporeal because taking the Torah literally in that sense. </p>\n\n<p>\"The biblical texts suggest that God is corporeal and the interpretation of these texts is not a very easy task\"(The Guide for the Perplexed). From this, we can conclude that some Jews may be confused, led astray, or be susceptible to conversion to other religions when they misinterpret the Torah. If they can't understand G-d's incorporeality they might lose their faith. This is why Rambam wants to guide Jews to pure monotheism and rationalism, being using reason as a tool is helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Also, to note Rambam, the famous rationalist had created the 13 principles of faith. three of which are like miracles.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"11\">\n<li><p>The belief in divine reward and retribution.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the arrival of the Messiah and the messianic era.</p></li>\n<li><p>The belief in the resurrection of the dead.\n(Chabad)</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The word miracle definition in the Dictionary.com \n\"is an effect or extraordinary event in the physical world that surpasses all known human or natural powers and is ascribed to a supernatural cause.\"</p>\n\n<p>As it said in the Torah \"for dust you are, and to dust you will return.\" and along with the notion that people can be resurrected is a miracle as itself as people do not see their dead relatives coming back to life.</p>\n\n<p>Also, the Rambam states \"The existence of G-d and his unity were admitted as unquestionable by all Jews; all Jews as Jews know that G-d exists and that He is one, and they know this through the biblical revelation or the biblical miracles.\"(Guide of the Perplexed PG XXI,Volume 1)</p>\n\n<p>Both faith and reason can work together and in Judaism are not conflicting but rather complementary each other. For rationalism it is simply a tool to help us understand G-d and how we are live in a proper state to worship G-d. This proper state should be clear of misunderstandings from superstition to G-d's incorporeality.</p>\n\n<p>The difference between the rationalist and non-rationalist is the focus on reasoning. Rationalist use of reason to help them while, non-rationalist do not use any form of philosophical techniques from the Greeks, Western, British, and etc. All non-rationalist forms of Judaism tend to be mystical rather than philosophical.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism have a concept of holy text literalism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apologies if this is an ignorant, foolish or offensive question. I am not Jewish, and am asking to satisfy my curiosity.</p>\n\n<p>Some time ago, on a political forum online, I was discussing religious literalism, the tendency of some religions to insist that their holy texts are the revealed word of the divine and thus cannot ever be contradicted by modern research, philosophy or belief systems.</p>\n\n<p>A poster claiming to be an Orthodox Jew turned up, and said that Judaism finds this concept bizarre. That it is understood that the scripture was written a long time ago, by fallible humans who lacked modern understanding, and might thus be flawed. He went on to say that Jews maintain books of Rabbinical law which are updated as a result of discussion amongst learned Rabbis down the ages and which are given almost equal weight to the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>He stated that it is generally agreed amongst Rabbis that the original creation story, for example, can be understood as a metaphor rather than the literal truth. And that this explains why there is little or no opposition to modern evolutionary science amongst Jews.</p>\n\n<p>Is this partially or wholly correct? And if so, are there any particular cultural or scriptural reasons why Judaism differs in this regard from other Abrahamic religions? Given that a number of Jewish practices appear somewhat anachronistic to other cultures, on what basis do Rabbis decide which laws and views should be updated, and which should be kept?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 34)\n\n<p>Either what was posted on that forum is about half-correct, or your understanding of what was said was about half-correct. Traditional Judaism does believe that \"[H]oly texts are the revealed word of the divine and thus cannot ever be contradicted by modern research, philosophy or belief systems.\" It is not true \"[t]hat it is understood that the scripture was written a long time ago, by fallible humans who lacked modern understanding, and might thus be flawed.\" We believe that scripture was written directly by God and that it is 100% truth.</p>\n\n<p>This does not mean, however, that we cannot understand the Torah in the context of modern knowledge. To use your example, it is not outside the range of orthodoxy to believe that the creation story in Genesis is written metaphorically. To be clear, it is <strong>not</strong> wrong; it is metaphorical. Imagine the Torah being given thousands of years ago explaining modern physics. The pre-scientific people of the time couldn't possibly understand it. Even today, the exact mechanism for creation could not possibly be understood by anybody but the most brilliant scientists (and probably not even them). Instead, we have a metaphorical version that gives enough of the details in order to convey the message that needed to be passed on. The Torah is not a science manual, so if some scientific details have to be glossed over to make us understand its underlying message, so be it. Again, that does not subtract from the likelihood of having been written by an all-knowing being.</p>\n\n<p>As far as the rabbinical books of laws, those do exist, though they're not afforded quite the same level of sanctity as the scripture. Those laws are not really updated as much as they are constantly being reinterpreted in order to understand how they apply today.</p>\n\n<p>So in short, we believe that scripture was written by God and that it is 100% true; however, we do not discredit science and modern knowledge. Instead, we try to use modern knowledge to have an even better understanding of what the Torah is teaching us. In other words, the Torah is totally true but not totally literal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 28)\n\n<p>I agree with the answer Daniel gave, but I would clarify things slightly differently.</p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Orthodox Judaism believes that the Torah is the exact Word of G-d as given to Moses.  This is one of the Thirteen Principles of Faith as brought down by Maimonides:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We do not know exactly how the Torah was transmitted to Moses. But\nwhen it was transmitted, Moses merely wrote it down like a secretary\ntaking dictation....[Thus] every verse in the Torah is equally holy,\nas they all originate from God, and are all part of God's Torah, which\nis perfect, holy and true.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> The laws of Orthodox Judaism do <strong>not</strong> however come from reading the text literally, but are interpreted via an oral tradition leading back to Moses (e.g. when it says \"An eye for an eye\", it actually means monetary compensation, not mutilation).</p>\n<p>Again Maimonides (introduction to the Mishneh Torah):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>3  But the Commandment, which is the interpretation of the Law--he did\nnot write it down, but gave orders concerning it to the elders, to\nYehoshua, and to all the rest of Israel, as it is written \"all this\nword which I command you, that shall ye observe to do . . .\"\n(Deuteronomy 13,1).  For this reason, it is called the Oral Law.</p>\n<p>4  Although the Oral Law was not written down, Moshe Our Teacher\ntaught all of it in his court to the seventy elders; and El`azar,\nPinehas, and Yehoshua, all three received it from Moshe.  And to his\nstudent Yehoshua, Moshe Our Teacher passed on the Oral Law and ordered\nhim concerning it.  And so Yehoshua throughout his life taught it\norally.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While our understanding of the Torah may have been corrupted over time, Orthodox Judaism holds that the core interpretation of the Torah does not morph to fit the changing notions of morality or modern understanding.</p>\n<p>Note that this does not say that bottom line practices cannot change.  Consider the analogy of driving a car:  Physics says that if you crash into something fast enough you will have a fatal accident, but the legal speed limit is derived by human laws that take the safety of cars and the way people drive into consideration.  Thus, the bottom line legal speed limit may change due to scientific advances (safer cars) and social norms, but the physics of it is still immutable.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> Finally, regarding things like evolution/creation, etc.  Orthodox Judaism generally has quite the open mind.  As long as there is no impact on the core interpretation of the Torah, then any amount of allegorical understanding is valid.</p>\n<p>Maimonides (intro to Perek Helek):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is often difficult for us to interpret words and to educe their\ntrue meaning from the form in which they are contained so that their\nreal inner meaning conforms to reason and corresponds with\ntruth......when you encounter a word of the sages which seems to\nconflict with reason, you will pause, consider it, and realize that\nthis utterance must be a riddle or a parable. You will sleep on it,\ntrying anxiously to grasp its logic and its expression, so that you\nmay find its genuine intellectual intention and lay hold of a direct\nfaith, as Scripture says: “To find out words of delight, and that\nwhich was written uprightly, even words of truth”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now technically Maimonides is addressing here the words of the Sages, not the actual Torah.  Still this is completely in line with his understanding of (e.g.) the story of Creation in his \"Guide to the Perplexed\", and I would argue what most Orthodox Jews follow.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Final note.  Maimonides is not the end-all answer for what Orthodox Judaism believes (there were considerable debates even in his day), but his writing are generally considered to be one of the pillars of our understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do we know that R' Yehuda does not think writing is a good way to remember something?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yoma.55a.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma on page 55a</a> quotes a mishna which has R' Yehuda saying that there were no boxes of money for people to donate for <em>kinei chova</em> offerings because the kohanim could confuse that box with donations for <em>nedava</em> offerings. Abaye suggests writing on the boxes which box is for which kind of offering, but the gemara retorts that R' Yehuda does not hold such inscriptions are useful. The gemara then seems to try to prove this assertion by quoting our mishna and going through basically the same reasoning: R' Yehuda says there is only one stand and the gemara asks why. Evidently because the stands could be mixed up. So why not write which stand is which? Because R' Yehuda doesn't hold this works.</p>\n<p>But how is this a proof? The reasoning seems exactly the same as the original point we are tying to prove. If this is a sufficient proof, why did the equivalently structured statement need to be proven at all?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Taz in his commentary Divrei David on Rashi asks a similar question on Rashi: Sometimes Rashi will quote another verse as proof to his interpretation of the verse under discussion, but when you look at Rashi to that verse, he quotes this verse as a proof to his interpretation there. The Taz explains that the fact that there are two verses that can be read the same way strengthens the interpretation for each verse simultaneously.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the fact that there are two Mishnayos which indicate R' Yehuda did not think writing works for avoiding confusion makes it more likely that was his opinion. If it is just one Mishnah, maybe there is another explanation. Two Mishnayos makes it much more likely this is the real explanation. (So theoretically, the Gemara could have had the exact same discussion with the Mishnayos reversed.)</p>\n\n\n",

If\n  it were possible that it could have been written with less than one\n  person, we would consider this possibility. And even though it is\n  possible that it was written by more than one person, it is not proper\n  to consider this, unless there is evidence which testifies to this,\n  such as different handwriting style in part of the letter or the like.</p>\n  \n  <p>Since this is so, it is not necessary to know Him face to face, if\n  this is not possible, and it will suffice for us to see the letter,\n  accepting as proof the writer's acts, namely, the form of the writing,\n  instead of seeing the writer himself. From this alone, we will know\n  clearly that one writer exists, who knows how to write and is capable\n  of writing, and that he wrote this letter, and did not partner with\n  someone else in writing it. This we can see from its orderly form and\n  uniform handwriting, since the handiwork of two makers is changing, it\n  is not uniform and orderly in one unison, and it changes in quality\n  and character.</p>\n  \n  <p>Similarly we will say regarding the Creator, since the signs of wisdom\n  in His creations are similar and uniform, we must conclude that one\n  Creator created them, because the existence of the created things is\n  impossible without Him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>also in ch.6</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are some people who claim that the world came into being by\n  chance, without a Creator who created it and without a Maker who\n  formed it. It is amazing to me how a rational, healthy human being\n  could entertain such a notion. If such a person heard someone else\n  saying the same thing about a water wheel, which turns to irrigate\n  part of a field or a garden, saying that it came to be without a\n  craftsman who designed it and toiled to assemble it and placed each\n  part for a beneficial purpose - he would be greatly amazed on him,\n  consider him a complete fool, and be swift to call him a liar and\n  reject his words. And since he would reject such a notion for a mere\n  simple, insignificant water wheel, which was made through basic design\n  for rectifying a small piece of land - how could he allow himself to\n  entertain such a notion for the entire universe which surrounds the\n  earth and everything in it, and which is designed with a wisdom that\n  no rational human intellect is capable of fathoming, and which is\n  prepared for the benefit of the earth and everything on it. How could\n  he claim that it came to be without purposeful intent and thought of a\n  capable wise Being?</p>\n  \n  <p>It is evident to us that for things which come about without the\n  intent of an intender (i.e. an intelligence who designed it with a\n  purpose) - none of them will display any trace of wisdom or ability.\n  Behold and see, that if a man suddenly pours ink on clean paper, it\n  would be impossible for there to be drawn on it orderly writing and\n  legible lines like it would be with a quill, and if a man brought\n  before us orderly writing from what cannot be written without use of a\n  quill, and he would say that ink was spilled on paper, and the form of\n  the writing happened on its own, we would be quick to call him a liar\n  to his face and tell him that it must have been written with an\n  intelligent person's intent</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(BTW, nobody has ever refuted this premise. the evidence for evolution is for things like common ancestry but nobody has ever observed a functional complex structure arising from unguided natural processes.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/articles/a/the-design-argument/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> website, Rabbenu Bachya makes  this argument in “The Duties of the Heart,” The Gate of Oneness, Chapter 6:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Do you not realize that if ink were poured out accidentally on a blank\n  sheet of paper, it would be impossible that proper writing should\n  result, legible lines that are written with a pen?

    "content": "# What if Purim hadn't happened?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is widely known that Purim is often compared to Yom Kippur in its level of holiness, etc. It is said that the spiritual heights to which one can rise to on Purim are essentially unparalleled at any other time of the year.</p>\n\n<p>My question, though, is what would have been if the story of Purim had never occurred? Had the events of Purim never happened would we not have this most-holy of days?</p>\n\n<p>(I suppose this same thing would apply to Chanukah as well. Biblical holidays could be exempt from this because they are there to commemorate events, or were instituted by God specifically for the purpose of purifying oneself and becoming holy [Yom Kippur/Rosh HaShanah].)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's the other way around. Every date in the Jewish calendar has a particular nature, and gives that date the potential for particular things to happen on it. So the 14th Adar had always had the nature of being the holiest day of the year, it was just revealed when Purim happened. Rav Dessler speaks about this in Michtav HaEliyahu (sorry, don't have an exact source).</p>\n\n<p>We can see this in the piyut \"Vayehi Bachatzi Halaylah\" that we say on seder night. Many, many events in Jewish history connected with redemption happened on seder night, some of them long before the Exodus from Egypt (such as the birth of Yitzhak and the angels coming the year before to inform Avraham).</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, Tisha B'Av has the potential for disastrous events - some, like the sin of the spies happened before the destruction of the temples (and some afterwards, like the Expulsion from Spain).\nSo it would seem that Purim was always of this nature, and so the Purim miracle happened on that day.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As opposed to Pesach where the holiday is because Hashem revealed himself and took us out of mitzrayim, Purim is because we did something. We didn't give up on Hashem even though it seemed he has given up ob us. So if Pesach hadn't happened is a nonsense question because Hashem made it happen. But Purim is a holiday of our efforts, so without the Jews holding steadfast there would be no Purim. (The idea is that because we did something Hashem reciprocated with more then he gives on his own)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Let me tell you a parable, about an ant climbing a building. As it advances, it feels different types of textures, lights, temperatures etc. When it climbs a window it feels hot and shiny, but when it passes a concrete wall if feels dark and cold. <strong>For this ant the sequence of the changes is random and sequential, it experiences them over time as it climbs up</strong>. So if it was writing his \"history\" it would write \"I've been through tough dark times and times of light and joy\".</p>\n\n<p>But for us, seeing the building from aside, the order of floors is very clear, we can see when the ant approaches those dark or good times. So for us, its \"history\" would be clearly predicted, moreover, it is seen for us as a whole, instead of disjointed fragments.</p>\n\n<p>This idea of a whole 4-dimensional creation (time-space), that's unfolding in time for 3-dimensional us, with all historical events in place is echoed a lot in numerous Midrashim, Meforshim and Kabbalic books. </p>\n\n<p>For example, prophecy, or Ruach HaKodesh, i.g. \"seeing the future\" can be easily explained by this perception, as in Rashi that brings Gemorah (Meggilah 16b) on Bereshit 45: \"וַיִּפֹּל עַל צַוְּארֵי בִנְיָמִן אָחִיו וַיֵּבְךְּ וּבִנְיָמִן בָּכָה עַל צַוָּארָיו\" -  he wept on two Beit Hamikdashot the are destined to be destructed. There are many interpretations of this kind that vents had influenced not only forward but also backward in time.</p>\n\n<p>THe 4 Galuyot were also destined (as many interpretations suggest).</p>\n\n<p>Another aid is the Mishna in Avot \"הכל צפוי והרשות נתונה\" - \"Everything is seen [at once]\". From this point of view, <strong>there could be no questions of \"what if\" as all history is destined from the moment of the Creation</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>Concerning Purim - just as the destruction of the first Temple was destined and so the Babylon exile, Purim was necessary to fulfill the establishment of the second Temple, and it was destined just as all other events.</p>\n\n\n",

See for instance Shabbos 13a דאמר עולא אפי' שום קורבה אסור משום לך לך אמרי נזירא סחור סחור לכרמא לא תקרב.</p>\n\n<p>If the phrase סחור סחור is in fact the standard Aramaic rendering of סביב as we seem to find in Targum Onkelos, than that doubling does not mean to be extra careful to turn away, so why use that phrase in conjunction with לך לך and in a sentence which seems to imply extra care to stay away?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Posen in <a href=\"https://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?199843&\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Parshegen I</a> (to <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bereshit/23.17#e1n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bereishis 23:17</a>, or page 432), every time it is used as an adverb, it is translated as סחור סחור. (Otherwise, it is translated as מקיף etc.) In his opinion, this is because Targum Onkelos cares about certain Hebrew/Aramaic stylistic points, and in this case, what Onkelos noticed is the Hebrew phrase סביב סביב, which occurs many times in Tanach, especially in Yechezkel (e.g. <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Yechezkel/8.10#e1n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">8:10</a>, 40:14). Therefore, as a rule, Onkelos chooses to use this phrase in Aramaic, sometimes even when grammatically incorrect (!).  See there for more specific examples.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Significance of nine months of pregnancy and eleven stars\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the <em>piyyut</em> Echad Mi Yodeya, recited at the Passover <em>seder</em>, we discuss what relates to the first thirteen numbers.</p>\n\n<p>Most of these are central to Jewish belief: One is Hashem, two are the Tablets (representing the giving of the Torah), the Patriarchs and Matriarchs, the Written and Oral Torah, Sabbath and circumcision (two of the most important <em>mitzvos</em>), the Ten Commandments (which include the whole Torah), the twelve tribes, Hashem's mercy.</p>\n\n<p>But two of these stand out: <strong>Nine</strong> are the months of pregnancy and <strong>Eleven</strong> stars [in Yosef's dream]. These seem to be only marginally related to central Jewish thought.</p>\n\n<p>Is there some special significance of the nine months of pregnancy and the eleven stars of Yosef's dream? Or did the author just not think of anything better to say for nine and eleven?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>R' Shimshon Pinkus published a sefer called ברכות בחשבון (that's breichos, not brachos) which goes through the song Mi Yodeya and explains the philosophical significance of each one and how it fits in to the chain of the song.  His thesis is that the words of the refrain are not מה אחד מי יודע - \"who knows what there is one of\" - but rather \"אחד מי יודע\" - \"who knows one,\" i.e. who knows what \"one\" is.  He explains how each chosen item demonstrates and epitomizes what that number represents in Jewish thought.</p>\n\n<p>The ideas are rather complex and difficult to summarize, but I'll do my best:</p>\n\n<p>Nine: Eight represents \"למעלה מן הטבע,\" going above nature, that Hashem is not subject to and can override the natural order.  Nine represents something above that - that Hashem is beyond all definition, אין סוף (limitless), and we can only describe Him by what He is not.  This, however, is still not the highest level.  This is still something we can understand - we understand that Hashem's existence is beyond our understanding.  But even that is, at the end of the day, a shade of \"definition,\" albeit a safer one.  This is the \"presentation\" to us, on our level, of Hashem being beyond definition.  But above that is the level of לך דומיה תפילה (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16286#v=2\">Tehillim 65:2</a>), to You silence is praise - meaning that there isn't even anything we can express.  \"Nine\" is the level of the realization that Hashem is אין סוף.</p>\n\n<p>This is encapsulated in the process of birth, through which the soul, which is destined for eternal life, and through it man has in him צלם אלקים and an aspect of infinitude, is put into man.  This parallels the \"revelation\" of Hashem's infiniteness being presented on our level - the חלק אלוק ממעל being put into man - the \"אין סוף הנגלה והנתפס,\" the \"infinite which is revealed and expressed\" (quotation is from R' Pinkus).</p>\n\n<p>Eleven: I am going to <em>majorly</em> oversimplify because he goes on for pages developing this idea.  Eleven is the number which represents the <em>sitra achra</em>, the \"negative side\" of spirituality, as well as the ability to overcome the <em>sitra achra</em>.  R' Pinkus goes at length to explain how and why this is so, but I won't attempt to do it justice here. The eleven stars in the dream represented the ability of the brothers (as part of the greater picture of the thirteen stars, as there were actually thirteen stars in the dream) to vanquish the <em>sitra achra</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I suggest reading it (and the rest of the book!) inside to actually get what he is saying.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can noisy fans and dehumidifiers be run on Shabbat in a home that has had a flood?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Talmud Shabbat 18a states that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“It is forbidden to place grain in a water mill [on Erev Shabbat]\n  unless it will be ground before nightfall. Why? Rabba said: Because it\n  creates noise.”[10] Rashi explains: “Because it makes noise and\n  becomes known (avsha milta) on Shabbat, causing denigration [of\n  Shabbat].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Suppose that a home had a flood on Thursday. The insurance company evaluated the home Friday morning, opened the ceiling and placed giant noisy industrial blowers and fans to dry out the walls and ceiling and prevent mold. The assessor said that these loud units must remain on continuously through Shabbat, and beyond for several days, otherwise mold will build up quickly, and the home will not be insured.</p>\n\n<p>In this situation, may the home owner leave these loud units on during Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>My understanding is that the concern of <em>avsha milta</em> is (at least primarily) the public nature of the (albeit automated) <em>melocho</em> of grinding. In this case, there would seem to be no such problem since air-drying would not seem to be a <em>melocho</em>. (I believe that even according to the <em>Yerushalmi</em> that has a strict and broad interpretation of the <em>melocho</em> of winnowing,it still should only be an issue when something tangible is visibly scattering in the wind). </p>\n\n<p>(In fact, my assumption is that the fans are not necessarily any louder than central air units outside shuls, batei medrash, or other communal buildings that are traditionally run on <em>shabbos</em>.)</p>\n\n\n",

I came across the following verse (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.5?lang=he-en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 22:5</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא-יִהְיֶה כְלִי-גֶבֶר עַל-אִשָּׁה, וְלֹא-יִלְבַּשׁ גֶּבֶר שִׂמְלַת אִשָּׁה:  כִּי תוֹעֲבַת יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ, כָּל-עֹשֵׂה אֵלֶּה ‏</p>\n<p>A woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man, neither shall a man put on a woman’s garment; for whosoever doeth these things is an abomination unto the Lord thy God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I looked online.  This prohibition is commonly called \"beged isha\". To my surprise, I read about the following exception in an <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Mens_and_Womens_Clothing.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish.com article</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It would be permitted for a man to wear one item of women's clothing for some functional reason -- e.g. he is stuck in the pouring rain and only has a woman's raincoat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How did this exception come to be?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This issue is discussed and there is a controversy. See Shulchan Aruch Yore Dea 182, paragraph 5, and the Baer Heytev commentary. Baer Heytev reports a controversy between the Bet Chadash and the Ture Zahav. The <strong>Bet Chadash</strong>  on Arbaa Turim, expresses surprise that the Tur doesn't distinguish between cases. He gives a lengthy explanation that the sin relates only to clothing worn for aesthetic purposes and that can generate to confusion, to appeal and lust.</p>\n<p>The BC enumerates two leniencies:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Even aesthetic clothes, to wear them with the intent to protect himself from heat in summer or from rain in winter is not prohibited. The proof is from the Talmud in tractate Nazir pages 58b-59a, according to Rabenu Tam's commentary. The Talmud said that shaving underarms may be allowed, even with a razor blade, if the reason is not for beauty.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>To wear clothes specific to the other sex, but which are not made for beauty, is allowed. He learned this from the Sifre.  For a woman, the prohibition is to wear clothes that glorify a man; and, for a man, clothes that embellish a woman.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The BC reported a discussion between Sefer Yereim and Mahari Mintz regarding making people laugh with a disguise for Simchat Mitsva, such as Purim or a wedding. He advised to be stringent.</p>\n<p>The way in which the Baer Heytev reported the BC is not clear to me.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Talmud Nazir 59a states. That there would be no reason for the Torah to state this verse for the purpose of telling us that a man shouldn't wear women's clothes just for the purpose of wearing it, per se, because it already stated that this is an abomination, and simply wearing clothes on its own is not an abomination. Therefore, it is stating this for the purpose of telling us that he shouldn't wear the clothes in order to sit among other women.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, since the man is wearing the coat to keep warm, this is not an abomination, and is therefore permitted. In short, this is not an \"exception\". It is based on the Talmudic interpretation of the verse.</p>\n\n\n",

According to some poskim they are considered\n  liquids, and would therefore be covered by the hagafen blessing (see\n  especially Sephardi poskim: Or Le-Zion14:18; Yakut Yosef 3:177, 10;\n  see also Ben Ish Chai, Masei 8; see also Be’er Moshe 1:11, and Vezos\n  Ha-Berachah p.44, inthe name of Rav Elyashiv).</p>\n  \n  <p>However, others write that they have the halachah of solids (see Shaar\n  Ha-Zion 158:1; Mekor Ha-Berachah p.110, inthe name of the Steipler;\n  Betzeil Ha-Chochmah 3:114, 4 distinguishes between ice creams that are\n  made with many different ingredients, and ices that are predominantly\n  frozen water).</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, some recite a blessing over the ice cream even in a meal,\n  and even after reciting hagafen at the beginning. This is probably the\n  common custom among Ashkenazim. Most Sephardim do not recite a\n  blessing on the ice cream, and leave eating the ice cream until after\n  benching, following the ruling of Rav Ovadyah Yosef and other Sephardi\n  poskim.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong><em>For ices that are licked and not chewed, it appears that this is\n  certainly considered drinking and not eating, and the hagafen blessing\n  will suffice.</em></strong>\n  (My Emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=1563\" rel=\"nofollow\">Daily Halacha</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Moshe Stern of Debereczyn, in his work Be'er Moshe (vol. 1,\n  11:2), rules that Halacha indeed treats ice cream as a liquid, and not\n  as a solid, and thus it is covered by the Beracha recited over bread\n  or the Beracha recited over wine. This view is codified as well by\n  Hacham Yishak Yosef in his work Kol Torah, in the name of his father,\n  Hacham Ovadia Yosef. The work \"Ve'zot Ha'beracha\" (p. 100) likewise\n  cites this ruling in the name of several leading Halachic authorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From <a href=\"http://eretzhemdah.org/newsletterArticle.asp?lang=en&pageid=48&cat=7&newsletter=99&article=313\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eretz Hemdah</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>a few poskim make the following claim. Ice cream is a liquid that is\n  served as a solid because people enjoy it at an artificially cold\n  temperature. Since accepted practice is not to make a beracha on\n  liquids during a meal, including during dessert, one should not make a\n  beracha on ice cream. Yalkut Yosef (on OC167, 10) rules this way in\n  the name of his father (Rav Ovadya). There are reports that Rav Moshe\n  Feinstein ruled this way as well (see Vezot Haberacha, pg. 74). One\n  could say that it is logical to call ice cream a liquid only when it\n  is based heavily on milk and/or water, not when it is a mixture of\n  eggs, soy products, and sugar (i.e., pareve ice cream) (see opinions\n  in Piskei Teshuvot 177:(24)). Perhaps Rav Moshe was speaking about\n  classic ice cream; however, Rav Ovadya does not accept this\n  distinction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It appears that many poskim treat ice-cream and frozen fruit juices (ices) as liquids for the purposes of determining whether they are exempt from brachos during a meal. This means that we would use the shiur of a revi'is when determining shiur requirements for the bracha achrona, therefore the consumption of ice on Yom Kippur would only be a violation of inuy if one consumed the equivalent of a revi'is of water once it is melted rather than the smaller kezayis shiur.</p>\n\n\n",

What there is mention of is re tznius that a woman even when in the washroom should be careful about only exposing what is necessary.

Indeed, one should not even stack a \"less holy\" sefer on top of a \"more holy sefer\" (although the Rama states, I believe, that anything that is bound and not written on <em>klaf</em> all have the same status). Thus, where would a phone with Torah on it fall in this spectrum?</p>\n\n<p>Maybe it would make a difference if the Torah was actually up on the screen at the time of stacking?

Ask your Rabbi to make sure you aren't one of them.</p>\n\n<p>Some things to consider:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>You will be dealing with a lot of water, some of which will be spilling onto the floor.  Consider wearing galoshes or boots, or at least an old pair of shoes that you don't care too much about.</p></li>\n<li><p>You may get splashed by water that is coming off of a dead body.  Most <em>chevra kadishas</em> will provide some kind of apron or protection, but you're better off wearing clothing that you don't mind if it gets soiled.  I was also told that some <em>poskim</em> consider it part of <em>kavod hameis</em> (honoring the deceased) to be prepared to get dirty in the process.</p></li>\n<li><p>You will probably be standing for your entire time there.  If you are quick, it may take you 40 minutes.  If you're slow, it could be over an hour.  If you end up with a double-header (two deceased for the same shift), you could be there for over 2 hours.  So make sure you wear comfortable shoes.</p></li>\n<li><p>In addition to standing for a long time, you will also be lifting the deceased and holding his/her body up for various reasons.  And <em>taharas</em> are done at night, at the end of a long day. Make sure you are well-rested.</p></li>\n<li><p>Since this is your first time, you may want to be prepared for dealing with possible squeamish-ness.  Consider asking to be put in a group that is large enough that you could step out if you need to.  Also, make sure they know it is your first time, so that they can avoid assigning you to a difficult <em>tahara</em> (some <em>taharas</em> are physically more challenging, and some emotionally).</p></li>\n<li><p>Talking around the deceased is kept to a minimum.  Ask the individual in charge of the team (or anyone experienced) to give you a rundown of what goes on, so that you don't need to do as much talking in the room (although this talking would be permitted).</p></li>\n<li><p>When you get home, you will need to wash your hands outside before you go into your house.  In the event you are doing a late <em>tahara</em>, make sure this is arranged before hand so that you don't have to wake anyone up when you come home.</p></li>\n<li><p>Don't assume that you will be able to go home and continue business as usual, or go straight to sleep - you may need some time to emotionally unwind.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n",

Could this prayer be recited privately by the relative himself? </p>\n\n<p>When there are a few people with Yahrzeit in the following week, I confess to having felt irritation. </p>\n\n<p>2) Is there a possible problem of “troubling the congregation” (tircha detzibura) involved?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't been able to locate a definitive source that authoritatively answers your question, so I hope that you'll be fine with what I infer from <a href=\"http://www.beureihatefila.com/files/2010-07-09_Tefila_Newsletter.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this source</a>. The article, and the site is comprehensive, and I haven't found any other that delves into the history of <em>tefilot</em> as well. I will summarize some of the key points in the article.</p>\n\n<p>There is a controversy on the definition of the term הזכרת נשמות - \"memorializing the souls\" and how that translates into specific prayer forms. Two versions spawned from this.</p>\n\n<p>The version composed by שבולי הלקט (Zedekiah ben Abraham Anav (1210 - ca. 1280)) - states that a prayer should be recited by anyone present in synagogue on Shabbat morning\nwho wishes to recite a prayer for the benefit of a deceased relative provided that the one reciting the prayer includes a promise of a gift to charity. This version is written in the 1st person and is what we now know ad the \"short\" יזכור prayer that is recited as part of that service on major Holidays. This is the \"silent\" prayer recited by individuals - see the linked article for details.)</p>\n\n<p>The other version is  מחזור וטרי (composed by Simhah ben Samuel of Vitry, a French Talmudist around 12th century). His versions provides for a format that is recited by the <em>Chazan</em> (he doesn't mention Gabbai, though, I infer that it refers to any congregational \"leader\" who can do this.) to honor deceased individuals who\nhave contributed to the benefit of the community either through the study and teaching of Torah or by having bestowed a physical benefit to the synagogue or whose family did so after his death. This version is what is now known as the <em>El Maleh</em> prayer that you are referring to.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the history of the prayers, this would explain why the <em>Chazan</em> or <em>Gabbai</em> is the one reciting it. It was meant as a communal prayer to acknowledge the important individuals who contributed to the shul. As to how and why this \"tradition\" shifted, i.e. - that emphasis is no longer there, I can't say, and I might be able to locate something about this.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't know if an individual can say this prayer, either. I haven't seen it done. I viewed a few web funeral home web sites and similar that discuss gravesite and unveiling prayer rituals. All of them said that \"El Maleh\" should be recited at the grave only when there is a <em>minyan</em> present. Regardless, now that you understand the history of the prayer, it seems, IMO, inappropriate to recite this prayer individually. Rather, one should recite the \"shorter\" version.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>tircha detzibur</em> problem - Yes, I see what you mean, as I am a Gabbai, and I have this question often. In terms of obeying the history of the prayer, there's nothing within the article implying that each person needed to be mentioned individually. Look at the article, and you'll see it mentions that the original text was similar to the ending of <em>Yequm Purkan</em>, which mentions <strong>no</strong> names. So, I infer that even then, there was no concern about grouping names together.</p>\n\n<p>In my shul, we \"compromise\". Individuals that approach me get individual prayers. We ususally don't get more than 2 per day, anyway, so the extra minute is not a big deal. Those that submit their names are on a list, and I group those together. Regardless, follow your shul's custom.</p>\n\n<p>I hope all this helped. Read the linked article, and I think you'll glean some great insights.</p>\n\n\n",

The case here, when it is bent over, is that the Matzah may not have baked properly, and that section is now Chametz. The Mechaber allows the Matzah at all times, minus a thumb-width (Magain Avraham there) of the part that touches the Chametz.</p>\n\n<p>The Ramo allows this for Matzah baked before Pesach, but not on Pesach. On Pesach he requires the whole Matzah to be regarded as forbidden, but never anything else baked in the oven.</p>\n\n<p>So the answer to your question is they would dispose only of the bad part plus a bit. This leaves a broken Matzah to sell. But Matzah's break for other reasons as well in handling. (Regarding price, the Matzah bakery I went to the other day was about 29% cheaper for the broken ones, but given the price of the Matzah, perhaps that isn't such a deal :-)). I have never heard of it being sold for Chametz rather than just being disposed of (e.g. burnt with Biur Chametz).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Two important points:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The issue is one of <em>chashash</em> chametz. They can't be certain that folded parts and bubbles were cooked fully (but they might have been), leaving some small amount of uncooked dough/flour inside still subject to leavening.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I can't speak to whether they engage in \"matzo surgery\" (which would be far easier to do without breaking them when they're fresh out of the oven, btw) or to the popularity of <em>shevarim.</em> It might just be what the market can bare.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Chametz is not a \"bio-hazard.\" It doesn't magically infect non-chametz items just by proximity. It would still take at least 18 minutes from the initial mixing of water for it to become chametz gamur (by the most stringent shitos), and most matzos are baked in a fraction of that time. </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Technically if you ate them right out of the oven on Pesach you would be fine. Plenty of time left to remove the \"not yet but potentially soon to be in <em>chashash</em> status\" matzot away from the \"perfect without any <em>chashash</em> whatsoever\" ones.</p>\n\n<p>If they were to decide to keep these folded matzot for whatever reason, then yes, they would have to sell them for Pesach. I have never seen \"shmurah matzo chametz\" for sale, though I have seen shmurah matzo meal. I suppose they could grind it up for the latter and slap on a \"not for passover use\" sticker on it like they do for Tam Tams. Not sure they'd want to - too many people might use it on Pesach without checking...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are so many of the sacrificial procedures discussed twice?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are two passages in the Torah which detail the laws of a <em>korban chatas</em> (sin offering), one in Parshas Vayikra and the other in Parshas Tzav. These two passages are very close to each other; why did the Torah discuss it twice, and in two different places?</p>\n\n<p>The same is true regarding the Asham (guilt-offering) and Shalmei Nedava (involuntary peace-offerings), that those sacrifices are discussed in both Parshas Vayikra and Tzav, albiet in slightly different ways. Why? </p>\n\n<p>(I'm not asking about what <em>halachos</em> are learned out from this repetition or from the second paragraph, but why the Torah needed two paragraphs a few chapters away from each other to teach us these laws)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As a matter of pashut pshat, it's not really difficult that something is discussed twice if the basic topics of the two sections are different.</p>\n<p>Here, Vayikra is mostly about a) when a korbon is brought, and b) the details of bringing it. That's where you have the details of which chatas for which sin. That's where you discuss how to make various types of menachos.</p>\n<p>Tzav is mostly about what to do with it afterwards: Burn it all up and deal with the ashes, who eats it, how long do they have to do that. For a mincha that's where you discuss whether a Cohen eats it or (for a Cohen's mincha) that it is burned completely. For a shelamim that's where you discuss whether you have 1 day (a todah) or 2 days (a regular shelamim) to eat it.</p>\n<p>Along with all this there is a lot of overlap and repetition.</p>\n<p>Korbon asham doesn't fit this rule very well: Vayikra doesn't discuss how to bring it - though it does discuss when it is brought. Rather, those details are in Tzav.</p>\n<p>Another question is on the special korbon mincha of the Cohen Gadol, which is made differently from every mincha, and yet it is in Parshas Tzav instead of Vayikra. You could say it's אגב the basic halacha there that a mincha of a Cohen is burned and not eaten, but צ\"ע.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>There is a widespread concept in kodshim that any law must be repeated for to to be meakev (affect the kashrus of the korbon). for example (menachos <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%99%D7%98_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">19b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב כל מקום שהחזיר לך הכתוב בתורה מנחה אינו אלא לעכב</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I believe this covers many instances, although you are right that there are individual inferences made from certain repetitions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>Why are so many things mentioned twice in the Torah, such as, but not limited to the examples you gave? </p>\n\n<p>An answer can be gleaned from the very first repetition of a subject in the Torah (Gen 41:32) and the answer given was כִּי-נָכוֹן הַדָּבָר מֵעִם הָאֱלֹהִים</p>\n\n<p>I've thus answered, because you specifically noted, that you are \"not asking about what halachos are learned out from this repetition ....\"</p>\n\n\n",

Nonetheless, it is common practice today of virtually all prayer-book publishers to include G-d's names in their products. Is there a halachik justification for this seemingly unnecessary leniency? </p>\n\n<p>(While not necessarily addressing all the potential halachik issues, many older <em>siddurim</em> often employed e.g. the use of \"יי\" in place of the Tetragrammaton and used a character that combined the א and ל for other divine names. [My understanding is that the other names were printed as is.] Even this practice seems to have been abandoned by modern publishers of prayer-books.)</p>\n\n<p>An additional potential issue of e.g. printing the Tetragrammaton as written instead of as pronounced is the possibility that those unaware of the rule about pronouncing that name are likely to be misled into violating that halacha. Is there any basis for this potential \"<em>michshol</em>\" as well?

Since the reason to not write siddurim no longer applies, and they'll be saved anyway, having HaShems name written out is no longer considered \"as if he is a burner of the Torah\", and it would be allowed.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In regards to Lifnei Iver, it's possible that the first printers who printed in such a way we're Over the Aveira. However, subsequent printers wouldn't be, because Lifnei Iver is only if the one doing the sin wouldn't have been able to do it without the 'help' of the other, IIRC. However, it would still be מסייע לידי עובר עבירה.</p>\n<p>Additionally, presumably almost anyone who we might worry won't know how to pronounce HaShems name (i.e. YKVK) are k'tanim, and probably even below / just barely chinuch age, in which case there might not be a worry of Lifnei Iver or מסייע לידי עובר עבירה to begin with.</p>\n\n\n",

One should remind people of the kingdoms in Europe and particularly our ruler the Czar and his predecessors, and the kings of England, who spread their influence over many lands in order that people should have confidence in the security of their body and money. The wealthy do not have to hide themselves so that others will not loot or kill them. On all of this (the presence of looting and killing) hinges the rules of informing (moser) and slandering (malshin) in the talmud and later authorities, as I will explain infra: These rules apply only to one who informs on another to bandits and so endangers that person's money and life, as these bandits chase after the person's body and money, and thus one may use deadly force to save oneself.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Waldenberg, Tzitz Eliezer 19:52</strong></p>\n<p>Even in the understanding of the secular court system it appears that there is a difference between primitive and enlightened governments as is noted by the Aruch Hashulchan in Choshen Mishpat 388:7 where it states that \"every issue related to informing found in the Talmud and poskim deals with those far away places where no one was secure in his money or body because of bandits and pirates, even those who had authority, as we know nowadays in places like Africa\" such is not the case in Europe, as the Aruch Hashulchan notes...I write this as a notation of general importance in the matter of the laws of informing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See, however, Iggrot Moshe Orach Chaim 5:9(11) who [according to the aforementioned site] writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is prohibited for us to inform on a person for a matter where the\npunishment is unfounded in Jewish law.

Providing of course that the Gentile is aware that his behavior will cause the breaking of a mitzvah on the side of the Jew, is he also to be held co-responsible in any grade for the violation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Gentiles are not obligated in the mitzvot besides the Seven Mitzvot of B'nei Noach. According to Tosafot on masechet Avodah Zarah (15b), the prohibition of \"placing a stumbling-block before the blind\" is not one of those seven commandments, so technically, a gentile is not responsible for a non-observant Jew's actions. </p>\n\n<p>The simple reading of the gemara and the opinion of some other Rishonim, however, is that the particular prohibition of \"placing a stumbling-block\" is a derivative of each individual commandment. As such, causing someone to murder (for example) is a part of the same exact prohibition as murder itself. Therefore, lifnei iver applies to gentiles as well as Jews for all prohibitions that apply to them (even when the person they cause to transgress is also a gentile). Still, since gentiles are not obligated in shabbos, the lifnei iver prohibition with respect to shabbos wouldn't apply to them.</p>\n\n<p>Nonetheless, it is a major halachic problem (for the Jew himself) to knowingly violate the commandments, so it would certainly be appropriate for a non-Jew to go above the letter of the law and refrain from causing a Jew to willingly violate halacha. While he may not be punished for not doing so, I would imagine he would be rewarded in the world to come for the extra effort.</p>\n\n\n",

In any case, I ended up being told by a security guard that I wasn't supposed to take pictures.</p>\n\n<p>Since the impression the guard (erroneously) gave me was that photography was outright forbidden (perhaps for privacy or security reasons), I was wondering if I wasn't aware of something and decided that I would email the place for a clarification (in case I go there again). I ended up on their website, and noticed that they prohibit photography and mobile phones on Shabbat (which I understand the motivations for, and which explains what happened).</p>\n\n<p>Is this a common restriction (for both Jews and Gentiles) that I should be aware of for synagogues in general?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It's understandable that the synagogue rules would ban photography inside the synagogue on the sabbath, even for gentiles. (As far as I'm aware, Jewish law does not.) Photography is forbidden for Jews then; therefore, having someone around snapping photos can be disconcerting and disturb people's sense of sabbath. That may even apply in the synagogue courtyard, but presumably not to to photography from the street. I suspect that the latter was forbidden to you either by a security guard who didn't understand why photography was forbidden inside, or for security reasons (in case you were casing the joint).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can an induction hob be kashered on Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking\" rel=\"nofollow\">Induction cooking</a> involves an alternating magnetic field in a coil underneath a smooth glass/pyrex surface. This alternating field induces eddy currents in an iron pot placed on the hob. In turn, these currents (due to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule_heating\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joule heating</a>) cause the pot to directly heat up and the contents within them.</p>\n\n<p>The actual glass/pyrex surface heats up as a result of contact with the hot pot. Often, induction hobs have a fail-safe whereby you can only turn on a heating ring when a pot is placed onto it (unlike a typical electric/gas hob). In this sense, it cannot be heated/kashered at full temperature in the same way that an electric/gas hob can be - the glass surface of an induction hob is indirectly heated by the pot.</p>\n\n<p>Is there a procedure to kasher such a surface for Pesach bearing in mind the Ashkenazi stringency not to kasher glass on Pesach? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't understand these answers. Surely the basis of kashering is to bring the item to a temperature above that that it experiences when cooking. As the glass top only receives heat indirectly (from the pot above), it never reaches a particularly high temperature and therefore does not need hagolah or libun. Or have I misunderstood this. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Those cooktops can totally handle 212 degree water poured on them. Thus, <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/articles/seasonal/338/preparing-kashering-the-pesach-kitchen/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Star-K writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Induction Cooktop</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before kashering an induction cooktop, it must be thoroughly cleaned and then left unused for at least 24 hours. The cooktop then requires iruy roschin. (Refer to instructions below for kashering a stainless steel sink by using iruy roschin.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially -- treat it like a stainless-steel sink.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In Peninei Halacha, Rav Melamed permits koshering and using induction cooktops under certain conditions (<a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-11-02/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Induction cooktops: The surface on which the pots are placed is like smooth, impervious glass. However, unlike ceramic burners, in which the heat source is within the ceramic surface, in induction cooktops the heat source is in the pot, which heats up by means of a magnetic field. From the pot, the heat spreads to the food cooking within it and to the surface on which it is standing. Ḥametz is liable to be absorbed into the cooktop via food that overflowed from the pot, some of which can get stuck to the base of the pot and continue to heat up along with it. Such cooktops are therefore kashered by cleaning them and pouring boiling water over them. Kashering them from the food that overflowed and got stuck to the bottom of the pot is based on the principle of ke-bole’o kakh polto: wet the bottom of the pot when they are empty, and heat them up on the cooktop for about 15 minutes. (Below, in section 12, the obligation to kasher glassware is discussed.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In section 12 (<a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-11-12/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) Rav Melamed makes a distinction between Ashkenazim and Sephardim vis a vis glass and concludes that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many Sephardim follow the lenient opinion and kasher glassware by rinsing it only, and many Ashkenazim have the custom not to kasher glassware. In practice, however, it seems that the middle position, according to which glassware has the same status as metal kelim and can be kashered by means of hagala, is primary. Those whose family custom is to be lenient may maintain their custom, and those whose family custom is to be stringent should maintain their custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e., Rav Melamed brings a distinction between Sephardim and Ashkenazim. It is acceptable for Sephardim to kosher and use like regular glass, and that (\"primarily\") Ashkenazi psak would allow it as well.</p>\n<p>To counter this, the OU does not allow kashering of glass stovetops, but provides a solution to using one in any case (<a href=\"https://oukosher.org/passover/how-to-kasher-your-kitchen-for-passover/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Glass Stovetop: A glass stovetop <strong>cannot be kashered</strong>, and therefore must be dealt with as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Clean the stovetop surface well and do not use for 24 hours.</li>\n<li>During Pesach, pots should not be placed directly on the stove surface, but\nrather an aluminum (or other metal) disk should be placed directly\nunder the pots.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One should not cover the entire glass top surface, as this might cause it to overheat and crack.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Presumably even if your argument were otherwise a justification of instituting a <em>chazarat hashatz</em> for optional services, the <em>tircha d'tzibura</em> ([time-]burden on the congregation) involved would preempt such an enactment, since the would-be <em>maariv</em>-prayer truly has no requirement to <em>daven</em> maariv whatsoever.

    "content": "# Making Kiddush with Grape Juice or White Wine\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Lechatchila</em> (a priori, by standard Halacha), can you make <em>kiddush</em> with grape juice or white wine?  Can you fufill the mitzvah of drinking your 4 cups on <em>Pesach</em> with white wine or grape juice, <em>bedieved</em> (a posteriori, at a minimal level)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Red is described as preferable, though white is always acceptable if necessary. (Or perhaps even if it's a type of wine you strongly prefer.) During times of the blood libels, white wine was actually recommended for the seder as no one could claim you were hiding blood in your glass.</p>\n\n<p>For regular kiddush, the Gemara says you can use freshly-squeezed grapes. The question is with today's pasteurized grape juice. While there are some rabbis who feel it's Shehakol, the overwhelming majority opinion today is that grape juice can be used for kiddush. (<a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/rabbi-zevulun-charlop/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Zevulun Charlop</a> has a <a href=\"https://www.yutorah.org/lectures/lecture.cfm/714040/rabbi-zevulun-charlop/a-changing-world-in-halacha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YUTorah mp3</a> on several interesting shifts in thinking over a generation of rabbis; this is one of them.)</p>\n\n<p>Grape juice for the 4 cups is a little bit shakier. Rabbi Heinemann feels that to demonstrate freedom, there should be some small percentage of alcohol that can still be tasted. His mentor Rav Moshe Feinstein also felt that grape juice wasn't acceptable, citing the Gemara about a rabbi who complained that the only time in the year he drank was the 4 cups on Passover, and that left him with a nasty headache for weeks. \"If alcohol was so disagreeable to his body, why not just drink grape juice?\", asked Rabbi Feinstein. \"Must be that grape juice is not acceptable for the 4 cups.\" (Others retorted that grapes are harvested in the summertime; without modern technology, there was no way to obtain grape juice in the early spring. You had to ferment it into wine to preserve it.) Mind you, the Kedem grape juice says on the label that it's kosher for the 4 cups (with the blessing of the Tzelemer Rebbe, if I'm not mistaken), and many people use it, especially if they've hit their limit on alcohol.</p>\n\n<p>But if faced with the choice between white wine and (purple) grape juice: white wine is very clearly suitable for kiddush and the 4 cups, merely less-preferred than red wine. Grape juice has some rabbis against it. So for the 4 cups, certainly white wine would be better. For kiddush, there's also the value of what you especially like, so if that happens to be grape juice, you could rely on that. But white wine is always safe, halachically. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>During the era of prohibition (of alcohol) in the United States Rabbi Levi (Louis) Ginzberg <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=r8uJAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=grape%20juice\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">paskened</a> that grape juice was usable <em>lechatchila</em> in fulfilling mitzvot such as kiddush and the four cups on passover. \nA summary of his reasoning can be found here: <a href=\"http://www.schechter.edu/four-cups-of-wine-a-path-to-freedom/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.schechter.edu/four-cups-of-wine-a-path-to-freedom/</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>We thus arrive at the following decisions: … From the point of view of Jewish law and custom, there is no preference to be given to fermented wine over unfermented. Both are of equal standing… As for the objection that has been raised against the use of unfermented wine for religious ceremonies on the grounds that it is against Jewish custom… There can be no doubt that in the past most of the wine used for religious purposes was fermented, since the process of preventing fermentation was unknown. But to base on such a fact the prohibition of the use of unfermented wine would be as unreasonable as to suppose that because only wax and tallow candles were used for lighting synagogues, the use of gas and electricity for that purpose is forbidden. (The Responsa of Professor Louis Ginzberg, ed. D. Golinkin, New York and Jerusalem 1996, pp. 130-131).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Other orthodox Rabbis responded to R' Ginzberg's psak years later. A summary of their rebuttals can be found here: <a href=\"http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1991_43_02_00_sprecher.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/journal/PDF/1991_43_02_00_sprecher.pdf</a></p>\n\n<p>By and in large the reasoning of R' Ginzberg has prevailed to this day.\nAdditional sources can be found here\n<a href=\"http://www.torahlab.org/doitright/using_grape_juice_for_kiddush/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.torahlab.org/doitright/using_grape_juice_for_kiddush/</a>\nand can be summarized as follows</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The common practice, and the position of the vast majority of contemporary poskim including Rav Moshe Feinstein, Rav Elyashiv, Rav Ovadia Yosef, Rav Soloveitchik, and the aforementioned poskim, is that grape juice may be used for Kiddush and all other sacramental purposes. Many do note the position of the Magen Avraham, that it is preferred to use wine when possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayim.272.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orech Chaim 272:4</a> says that Ramban disqualifies white wine for night kiddush even bidieved.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are some excerpts from that siman that should help with your question. The translations here are my own.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayyim.8.2?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">2</a>: סדר עטיפתו, כדרך בני אדם שמתכסים בכסותם ועוסקים במלאכתם, פעמים\n  בכיסוי הראש פעמים בגילוי הראש. ונכון שיכסה ראשו בטלית</p>\n  \n  <p>The עטיפה (wrapping, which is part of putting it on) should be done in\n  the manner that people wear their clothes and do their work; sometimes\n  with the head covered, and sometimes with the head uncovered. It is\n  better to cover the head with the <em>talis</em>.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.8.3?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">MB 3</a>: ועוברי דרכים, שמניחין הטלית כשהוא מקופל ומשלשלים סביב\n  צווארם על כתפיהן, אין יוצאין ידי חובת ציצית בזה, דבכהאי גוונא – לכולי\n  עלמא לאו עיטוף הוא</p>\n  \n  <p>Travellers, who place the <em>talis</em> on their shoulders when it's folded,\n  and wrap it around their necks (=all strings in front), do not fulfil\n  their obligation of <em>tzitzis</em> in this manner, because all would agree\n  that this does not count as \"עיטוף,\" wrapping.</p>\n  \n  <p><a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayyim.8.4?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">4</a>: מחזיר שתי ציציות לפניו ושתיים לאחריו, כדי שיהא מסובב במצוות</p>\n  \n  <p>One should place two <em>tzitziyos</em> in front, and two in back, so that he\n  should be surrounded by <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So it would appear that the correct method, per SA and MB, would be to have the <em>talis</em> over the shoulder, two strings in front and two behind, with the head sometimes covered with the <em>talis</em> like a hood.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As someone already mentioned, there is the Shulchan Arukh which says</p>\n\n<p>Orach Chayim 8:4 - \"One should place 2 fringes in front and two behind him in order that he should be surrounded with fringes.\"</p>\n\n<p>But this is not regarded as a halacha. You can see this by the opening line of this same section.</p>\n\n<p>Orach Chayim 8:2 -\"The manner to wrap oneself goes according to the way people wrap themselves in clothing.\"</p>\n\n<p>These are suggestions, not halachically binding. You find other codifications making similar mentions or suggestions.</p>\n\n<p>Such as Nehar Misrayim, written in the 1900s on the laws of Egyptian Jewry. i actually have pictures to verify this was how it was done. So you have instances of an entire community, post Shulchan Arukh, not following what was written. Why? Probably because they already had a custom and did not feel the need to follow a new suggestion. </p>\n\n<p>Nehar Misrayim Halachoth Sithsith 4:\"</p>\n\n<p>ד) במצרים רובא דרובא דהמוני עם משלשלין כל הארבעה ציציות לצד פניהם והטלית מקופל על צוארם וראוי להודיעם שלפחות בשערת העטיפה. יברך ויתעטף בו ראשו ורובו ויעמוד כן כדי הילוך ארבע אמות ואח״כ ישלשלנו על כתפו.\"  </p>\n\n<p>\"4) In Egypt the most common way is that one drapes all four ṣiṣioth to their front and the tallit is folded on their neck. And it's appropriate to inform them in their time of wrapping. He blesses and wraps his head and most of his body in it and will stand up in the space of four cubits and afterward will drape it over his shoulder.\"</p>\n\n<p>You may say that this custom could be a recent development, or a deviation away from the Shulchan Arukh. But the Yemenite custom is to also drape over the neck and shoulders with all four sisioth in front, and this custom very likely to predates the Shulchan Arukh.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G0s8w.jpg\" alt=\"Yemenite tallit\"></p>\n\n<p>As for written sources that predate the Shulchan Arukh, Rav Sa'adyah Gaon and the Radbaz both say that one should wear a tallith with it draped over the neck and then both sides thrown back over ones shoulder so that all sithsith are on ones back, in order to fulfill the words of a midrash. These are some of the earliest, and in the case of Sa'adyah Gaon, most authoritative opinions one can rely. If you would like to see or hear the specific sources, you can watch a video by Rabbi David Bar Hayim <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHijhmFCFXY\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n<p>So in short. No, there is no way to wear a tallith according to halacha. It's a custom, and a matter of preference, with many differently valid suggestions on how it should be done. In the end you will probably be ostracized for doing anything contrary to the status quo of the community, so a more pertinent question may be, is one allowed to wear a tallith any way he pleases even if it's against the community norm?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a woman be part of the decision regarding a shul's minhag?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are a few areas in davening where each shul has it's own <em>minhag</em> (custom). For example, whether to say Hallel the 1st two nights of Pesach, in shul. </p>\n\n<p>Some shuls have a ritual \"committee\" that meets frequently to discuss these minhagim and any modifications made to them. Changes to the minhag are decided by a majority vote of the committee members in consultation with the shul's Rav. The Rav acts as the halachic advisor on all issues. Obviously, if the committee votes on something that is against halacha (e.g. - no men have to wear <em>tefillin</em> during weekday <em>Shacharit</em>), he would veto the vote.</p>\n\n<p>Generally, women are not obligated to attend shul to daven. They are also not obligated to daven all the sections of the davening as men are (have to locate supporting sources in O.C.) Thus, my thinking is that having women on the ritual committee making decisions that they are not obligated or fully involved with, and in a sense deciding what the shul minhag should be when they are uninvolved and, perhaps, \"uneducated\" would seem inappropriate and possibly lead to a \"flawed\" decision.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the committee does not approve of anything anti-halachic, is a woman allowed to be part of the voting decision regarding any changes to the shul's minhag that affects davening itself?</p>\n\n<p>What about \"peripheral\" shul minhagim such as changing the <em>nusach</em> (Ashkenaz to Sefarad or vice versa; requiring men to wear tefillin during Hol Hamo'ed when previously the shul didn't, and similar decisions?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Obviously -- for practical matters please consult a local rabbi. Or sometimes the bigger guns must be brought in, and consult (and abide by!) a bigger posek. But here's some theory on the subject.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein -- <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14675&pgnum=193\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igros Moshe OC2:21</a> -- addresses a shul making changes to its custom. (Though with regards to Hallel on Seder nights, he suggests that in most cases they didn't have a custom to <em>not</em> say Hallel, they simply didn't have a custom about saying Hallel.) If I recall correctly, usually what's needed is the majority of the congregation, plus a significant rabbi. (Presumably if the shul has a rabbi that would work; sometimes the shul itself is in flux and has no rabbi, and thus contacts an outsider. For instance Rabbi Shlomo Zalman Auerbach allowed both a yeshiva in Jerusalem and a shul in Baltimore to generally switch from the German text to the more-common Ashkenazic one.) Drastic changes (such as Nusach Ashkenaz to Nusach Sefard) seem to require an overwhelming majority -- \"if the official custom was Nusach Ashkenaz, and many Nusach Sefard people move in, if there remain 'many' Nusach Ashkenaz-ites, even if they're the minority, the custom shouldn't change.\"</p>\n\n<p>(Mind you, it could be argued that some democratically-organized Shuls today have the official custom of \"whatever the ritual committee decides.\" Also note that Rabbi Feinstein begins his reponsum with the language of <em>rov hamispallelim</em> -- \"most of those who pray\", and ends it with <em>rov hakahal</em> -- \"most of the community.\" That distinction could come into play here.) </p>\n\n<p>It wouldn't be terribly hard to extrapolate that a synagogue's membership may agree to be represented by a ritual committee, rather than a direct referendum of its entire population. If so, I don't see what the issue would be. (Other than broader questions of <em>serara</em> -- \"positions of dominating authority\" -- and the like -- vis-a-vis women.) Now if a significant percentage of the shul feels that they should only be represented by men, who are most-significantly affected by changes in the liturgy, they could probably demand a direct referendum. But <em>otherwise</em>, if a shul is comfortable with women having a vote on whether to renovate the building or hire a new rabbi, then I can't see why they shouldn't have it on liturgical changes as well. </p>\n\n<p>For tefilin on Chol HaMoed, I don't think the shul could compel those who don't wear tefilin to wear them (or vice versa!). They could ask those with the non-official practice to please pray behind a mechitza. (And if women show up that day, I guess you'd have the main sanctuary; the walled-off section for those of the \"wrong\" tefilin persuasion; and the women's section. Ask me if the women want to wear tefilin, you'd need a fourth section ...) </p>\n\n\n",

This is also the view of the kabbalists: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Man is greater than the angels in that he was given inclinations, and\n  obliged to contend with vital questions and his bodily needs, even\n  with the seductions of the evil inclination, while the angels'\n  existence is static. </p>\n  \n  <p>This distinction is famed for the names assigned in it to man and the\n  angel.

See <strong>Rambam, Nashim, Yishut, 1, 1:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace and he and she decided to marry, he would bring her home, conduct relations in private and thus make her his wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And <strong>halacha 4:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before the Torah was given, when a man would meet a woman in the marketplace, and he and she desired, he could give her payment, engage in relations with her wherever they desired, and then depart. Such a woman is referred to as a harlot</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You see here a natural delimitation between marital and non-marital behavior.</p>\n<p>For the intermarriage, the Rambam stated in <strong>Kedusha, Isure Bia, 12, 1-2:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a Jew engages in relations with a woman from other nations, [taking her] as his wife or a Jewess engages in relations with a non-Jew as his wife, they are punished by lashes, according to Scriptural Law.1 As [Deuteronomy 7:3] states: \"You shall not intermarry with them. Do not give your daughter to his son, and do not take his daughter for your son.\"  This prohibition applies equally to [individuals from] the seven [Canaanite] nations and all other gentiles. This was explicitly stated in Ezra [Nechemiah 10:31]: \"That we will not give our daughters to the gentiles in the land and that we will not take their daughters for our sons.\"</p>\n<p>The Scriptural prohibition applies only to marital relations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch ruled as Rambam in <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7541\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Haezer 16, 1</a></p>\n<p>I hope that now the question is answered.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now we can enter a bit more deeply in the topic. In Gemara two opinions of Tanayim are exposed concerning the verse of intermarriage. The first opinion is from Rabbaban, the verse prohibits only to marry, within Jew marriage rules, a convert from the 7 Canaanite nations<sup>(1)</sup>. The second, the opinion of Rabbi Shimm'on,  is that the verse prohibits to marry (in the old, before Tora manner) someone non-Jew when he is not converted to Judaism. Rambam ruled as Rabbi Shim'on and the Smag (<a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20520&st=&pgnum=155&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lavin 112</a>) and the Tur ruled as Rabbanan. One question is what is the opinion of Rabbi Shim'on for the case of a convert from 7 Canaanite peoples. The Sefer Hachinuch in <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01644_part_427.html?dyn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitsva 427</a>, which follows exactly the Rambam, ruled that for this detail, we (Rabbi Shim'on) agree with Rabanan and prohibits by this verse. So he, following the Rambam prohibits. Nowadays we can not consider anybody as from 7 peoples and to marry a convert is never prohibited by this verse (See also Shaar Hamelech on Rambam IB 12, 1, which explain this following the Ran in Rif AZ).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>(1)</sup>\n<sub> Gemara Yebamot 76a: Subsequently Raba stated: What I said is of no consequence. For while they are still idolaters their marriages are invalid; only when they are converted are their marriages valid. {Rashi: The verse mentione marriage, so it cannot concern their status before conversion because there is no [halachically] marriage with non-Jew, but obviously the verse talk about them after conversion ...}. See also in the Smag, lavin 112, in link above and in Sefer Hachinuch.\n</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam addresses this in Hilkhot Issurei Biah (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5112.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">12:1-2)</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א  ישראל שבעל גויה משאר האומות, דרך אישות, או ישראלית שנבעלה לגוי, דרך אישות--הרי אלו לוקין מן התורה, שנאמר \"לא תתחתן, בם\" (דברים ז,ג):  אחד שבעה עממין, ואחד כל האומות באיסור זה.  וכן מפורש על ידי עזרא \"ואשר לא ניתן בנותינו, לעמי הארץ; ואת בנותיהם, לא ניקח לבנינו\" (נחמיה י,לא). ולא אסרה תורה, אלא דרך חתנות</p>\n  \n  <p>ב  אבל הבא על הגויה דרך זנות--מכין אותו מכת מרדות מדברי סופרים, גזירה שמא יבוא להתחתן.</p>\n  \n  <p>1) A Jewish male who engages in relations with a non-Jewish female in a manner of marriage, or a Jewish woman who engages in intercourse with a non-Jew in the manner of marriage--these are subjected to whipping according to Biblical law, as it says \"do not marry them\" (Deut. 7:3). Both members of the 7 (Canaanite) nations, and members of all other nations are equivalent in this law. Ad this is also explicit in the words of Ezra \"And that we we will not give our daughters to the nations of the land, and their daughters, we will not take for our sons\" (Nehemiah 10:31). The Torah only forbade this in the manner of wedding.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) However, one who engages in intercourse with a non-Jewish woman in the manner of a non-marital liaison, is subjected to rabbinically imposed lashes; as an enactment lest he come to get married. (Translation my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize it is not halakhic marriage (which as you noted cannot exist) to a non-Jew which is Biblically forbidden, nor is it intercourse alone, but rather, intercourse <em>in the manner of wedding and marriage</em>. That is, the prohibition is to have intercourse in the social framework of a marital relationship; even though technically there is no marriage.</p>\n\n<p>However, there is a separate rabbinic prohibition against sexual intercourse even outside of marriage.</p>\n\n\n",

Also i read that one has to use \"shmurah matzah\" that was guarded from the field it was ripened, and i went to 3 different Jewish markets and bakeries to attempt to buy \"shmurah flower\" and of course they looked at me like i was insane. Does one need to use Shmurah matzah as defined is this strictest sense? Or can one use normal flour?</p>\n\n<p>So when one wants to bake their own Matzah, what are the halakhoth?

Moses Cordovero has a quote in Pardes Rimonim (1591) found in Maggid Mesharim. Gordon points out that Caro's children never expressed any doubt as to his authorship. R. Shalom Bailea (1680-1743) provided a detailed defense of Caro's authorship, and more recent scholars found no reason to question his authorship.

Heller in Yishai's answer.  Shadal considers the argument based on Sefer HaPardes (a sefer written by R' Moshe Kordovero in the lifetime of Rav Yosef Karo) to be a straightforward proof that the M.M. could not have been a forgery.  Josh Waxman (translator there) provides Mevaqesh's counter-argument that perhaps \"someone took that genuine quote and included it in a forged Maggid Mesharim to bolster its authenticity...\".  However, see the full quote from Emunas Chachamim, as this bolsters the argument, by noting the reputation of the Sefer, as well as the likelihood that it was read by Rav Karo:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וא\"כ איך אפשר שדברים כאלה המדברים בסתרי התורה יכתוב הר\"ם קורדואירו בשם רבו מהרי\"ק בחייו ובעירו של מהרי\"ק ויעלם על ספר ויפרסם אותם בפני רבו וישלחם להרמ\"ע, ובכמה מקומות אחרים אם לא היה האמת שהרב קארו כתבם ופרסמם יתעקש המתעקש ויאמר מה שירצה שזו היא בעיני תשובה ניצחת שאין להשיב עליה והראיתי דבר אלה לאחד מן המתפלספים ואמר לי שצריך לומר שהרב קארו בדה דברי שקר כדי לגדל מעלתו, תאלמנה שפתי שקר אתפרכן אתחרשן הדוברות על צדיק עת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Shadal there assumes that if we would not consider Rav Yosef Karo to be a \"completely wicked individual, like Yeravam and his colleagues\" and as a result, it is impossible to believe that \"he invented these words from his heart\".  (Note that later in the Vikuach, there are some passages that are pointed out that would be hard to accept as having been said by an angel, or accepted by Rav Karo.  See <a href=\"http://parsha.blogspot.ca/2008/04/discussion-of-maggid-meisharim-pt-iv.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>The above, however, is simply a review of the introduction of this section.  Shadal's main thesis is that Maggid Meisharim was never intended to be literally taken as a discussion between Rav Karo and an angel, but rather it was just him going through his thoughts in an imaginary dialogue.

The worker, of course, gets a salary via studying the chametz.</p>\n\n<p>Is the fact that he handles and gets a salary studying chametz considered within the prohibition of \"deriving benefit\" from chametz, or is it not since the chametz never belongs to him.</p>\n\n<p>Also (possibly) in this equation - because of the nature of the research, in most cases, chemicals and other processing (such as centrifuging and heating) usually render the food inedible almost immediately.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Based on comments:</strong> - The question is not restricted to only this specific job, but any job where chametz may need to be handled as part of research studies, including a professional chef or baker at a non-Jewish place.</p>\n\n<p>I have included the chef and baker based on this assumption - it is not your chametz. Never bought or owned by you and will never be eaten or used by you.

Every Motzai Shabbos we say ויהי נועם to lengthen the return of the souls that were released from Gehinnom for Shabbos who must go back on Motzai Shabbos (Tur O.C. 295).  However, when Yom Tov is during the week, we don't say it, because the souls are not returned to Gehinnom for such a short period since they will be coming back in less than a week, when Yom Tov arrives.  Therefore, the extra soul of Shabbos remains for the week, and the sanctity of Shabbos is thereby extended into the week.  The first time this happened was the Shabbos immediately before the first Pesach.  In commemoration of this \"big\" Shabbos, we call it \"Shabbos HaGadol.\"</p>\n\n<p>This would explain why it is a title unique to the Shabbos, not to the date.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Bach (430:1) writes that Shabbos was set aside to commemorate this miracle - and not the tenth of the month (when the miracle actually happened) in order to prevent confusion with the miraculous Crossing of the Jordan, which also happened on the tenth of the month. </p>\n\n\n",

The shul davens nusach Ashkenaz, and the chazzan did not say <em>Mashiv Haru'ach</em> in his repetition.</p>\n\n<p>No one in the minyan noticed anything until after davening was over. During <em>kiddush</em>, I told the <em>chazan</em> that he forgot to say <em>Tal</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I assume that if davening has concluded, one need not say <em>Tal</em> at all, as it is not a mandatory part of davening as it is <em>piyutim</em>. But, I'm curious if the <em>chazzan</em> had remembered at any time during the repetition of <em>Musaph</em>, should he have inserted Tal there, go back to the beginning of Musaf, or just ignore it and continue Musaph?</p>\n\n<p>Another option - Can Tal be said at any time during the day?

In <em>Nussach Yeshivish</em> in Eretz Yisrael (based on the Gr\"a, I assume) they do not say Tal during the repetition of the Amida, but rather (an abridged version) before the Kaddish of the silent Amida. So we see it's not part of the repetition.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>But, I'm curious if the chazzan had remembered at any time during the repetition of Musaph, should he have inserted Tal there, go back to the beginning of Musaf, or just ignore it and continue Musaph?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Those Piyutim that are said after \"Mechaye Hameithim\" can be said at their correct place even if he forgot the earlier ones.<br/>\nOne would have to study the other Piyutim to see if they are relevant to other sections and if they can be moved around. Those that are Bracha-specific (i.e. explicitly refer to a specific Bracha) probably shouldn't be said anywhere else, as they may be irrelevant to another section.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Another option - Can Tal be said at any time during the day? For example, can it be included in Mincha?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Since it's simply a prayer for rain, it can be said any time. But it cannot be included in the Amida except in the 2nd Bracha where it belongs. Since we say Piyutim during Mincha on Yom Kippur, I assume it's OK to add Tal in Mincha, if everybody forgot during Mussaf.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My question would apply to Tefillat Geshem as well. I'd imagine the rules would be the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I see no reason why not.</p>\n\n<p>What are the above assumptions based on?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I could not find anybody who talks about the entire congregation forgetting Tal or Geshem. </li>\n<li>From a strict Halachic POV there's no need for the Tal/Geshem \"Piyutim\" - all one needs is the announcement from the Chazzan.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Since for (old fashioned) Ashkenazim there's nothing to announce for Tal, the fact that the Chazzan skipped Mashiv Haruach in Mussaf is the signal to stop saying it in from Mincha onwards.</li>\n<li>Or, some announce \"Machalkel Chaim\" before Mussaf as a signal to stop saying it in Mussaf already.</li>\n<li>Those who say \"Morid HaTal\" can announce that before Mussaf as a signal to stop saying it in Mussaf already.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>Same for Geshem, if Mashiv HaRuach is announced before Mussaf, one doesn't say it in Mussaf, else one stops in Mincha having heard it from the Chazzan in Mussaf.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch  114 - <a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01975_part_6.html#HtmpReportNum0025_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">סימן קיד - דין הזכרת הרוח וגשם וטל</a> - for these rules in the original.</p>\n\n\n",

How does one qualify something is Chesron Mamon and why exactly did the rabbis permit melachos in such scenarios? We don't violate melachos on Shabbat due to Chesron Mamon...</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>One way to understand this is that the restrictions are Rabbinic (Tosfos, Maggid Mishna to the Rambam Shvisas Yom Tov 7:1 and others), and they built-in this exception. Rabbinic decrees often have such trap doors in order to ensure that they are manageable by the people.</p>\n\n<p>Another is that while the prohibition is Biblical (Rashi and many more), the exact nature of the prohibition is left by the Torah for the Rabbis to decide.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.darchenoam.org/working-on-chol-hamoed-sources-status-nature-and-rules/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is a nice summary of the various sources.</p>\n\n<p>More listing of sources <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/936041/jewish/Shevitat-Yom-Tov-Chapter-Seven.htm#footnote3a936041\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps one may suggest the following. Simply speaking, chesron mammon is an actual loss of money, as opposed to losing out on potential gain, as the gemaras in Moed Katan (2b, 3a, see there) seem to imply.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah only forbade work that has a halachic name of \"melacha\" (the 39 of shabos etc.) with the exclusion of techumim, crossing the line of permitted travelling distance.\nTherefore, automatically, everything else is permitted. The sages felt that it was degrading to the holiday to perform anything that involves excessive bother (Moed Katan 2a, see there).</p>\n\n<p>However, the rabbis said that where there is a loss of money, anything that isn't too strenuous may be performed, for those instances don't express total degradation of the holiday: rather, it is understood that the action is due to the loss of money.</p>\n\n<p>In a similar vein, the Ksav Sofer permits smoking on a holiday, but only on the second day of the holiday, for on the first day it would be degrading to the holiday, but the second day, after not haven smoked the previous day, the buildup of discomfort would be tremendous and smoking is no longer a display of degradation.</p>\n\n\n",

Defining chametz. Two passages in the\n  third chapter of pesachim discuss the definition of “chimutz”\n  (leavening). one passage (pesachim 48b) presents the physical\n  characteristics of chametz. the mishna describes the leavening process\n  as follows: first, the dough becomes pale, similar to the appearance\n  of a man whose hair stands on end out of fright.  next, cracks begin\n  to develop on the dough’s surface, described by the mishna as “karnei\n  chagavim” (locusts’ antennae).  the cracks then begin to increase and\n  merge into each other. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This part of the quote is the main point:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rishonim and the Shulchan Arukh (451:2) rule in accordance with\n  the Sages (and R.  Meir) regarding the definition of chimutz. it is\n  forbidden and punishable by karet to eat the mixture once it has\n  developed cracks like a “locust’s antennae.”</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Yosef Karo, in the Shulchan Arukh (459:2), concludes:   One should\n  not leave dough without it being worked, even for a moment.  <strong>as long as one is\n  working the dough, even for the entire day, it does not become\n  chametz.</strong>  If one left the dough without working it for a mil, then\n  it becomes chametz.  the period of a mil is 18 minutes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>From this we see that the halachic status of chimutz is specifically related to the appearance of the dough and not to some chemical status. The <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/334116/leavening-agent\" rel=\"nofollow\">chemical fermentation process</a> of leavening will continue  while the dough is being worked.</p>\n\n<p>So yes,  the concept of chametz is to be treated as a purely halachik construct which is not defined by the \"physical\" (I prefer to call it \"chemical\") fermentation. Nevertheless, chimutz cannot occur unless there is this fermentation. </p>\n\n\n",

Ramba\"m discusses this quite extensively.

The example about Pharoah to illustrate the difference, I think, is very good. Some excerpts:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Rambam defines emunah as the knowledge that HASHEM created and\n  continues to run all of Creation. Simply put, nothing can exist and no\n  activity can occur without HASHEM.</p>\n  \n  <p>Bitachon, however, is a quite different. The Chovos Halevovos defines\n  bitachon as trusting in HASHEM. It is a sense of relying on HASHEM to\n  watch over and protect me, as if to say, “I take my heavy burden and\n  place it on HASHEM.” While I am responsible to be proactive, I am not\n  in charge of the outcome, and I am not the determinant of the results.\n  I rely on HASHEM to care for me.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Emunah is a state of understanding; bitachon is a state of trust</strong>.\n  Emunah means knowing that HASHEM is involved in every activity on the\n  planet; bitachon means trusting in HASHEM in every situation.</p>\n  \n  <p>A person can have emunah and not bitachon</p>\n  \n  <p>Aperson can have emunah and not bitachon. Pharaoh was a classic\n  example. When threatened by the Jewish overpopulation, Pharaoh’s\n  solution was to throw the baby boys into the Nile. The Medrash\n  explains that this wasn’t a flippant reaction – it was highly\n  calculated. Pharaoh knew that HASHEM promised Noach that He wouldn’t\n  bring another flood. He also knew that HASHEM pays back “measure for\n  measure.” Therefore, Pharaoh determined that HASHEM would want to\n  bring a flood to pay back the Egyptians for drowning the babies, but\n  because of HASHEM’s promise to Noach, that couldn’t happen, so he felt\n  protected from HASHEM’s wrath.</p>\n  \n  <p>Clearly, Pharaoh understood the power of HASHEM. He realized that\n  HASHEM watches over the world. He also understood that HASHEM acts\n  with justice. Pharaoh had no problem with emunah, but he sure didn’t\n  trust in HASHEM – he rebelled. He had emunah, but no bitachon.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Growing in emunah</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Both emunah and bitachon are based on relating to the world in a\n  deeper manner. Emunah is the understanding that HASHEM is involved in\n  more than just the big picture issues: life and death, war, famine,\n  disease. . . HASHEM is involved in the minutiae of my daily life.\n  HASHEM is there with me, 24/7, 365, all day, every day, from morning\n  to night.</p>\n  \n  <p>Amazingly, I can have this understanding and yet lack a level of trust\n  in HASHEM.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What I infer from this is that <em>emunah</em> is not \"blind\" faith. If it were, we'd be \"dummies\" or \"zombies\", just performing our activities without thinking through it at all. It seems that <em>emunah</em> requires at least some minimal understanding that G-d exists and is in control of all. Atheists, thus, have no <em>emunah</em>, based on this definition. Perhaps, this is why David in <em>Tehilim</em> (I think it's ch. 11 or 13?) calls them fools.</p>\n\n\n",

To quote Dr. Marc Shapiro in <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/1993/905/704648.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maimonides' Thirteen Principles: The\nLast Word in Jewish Theology?</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbinic sources speak of tikkun soferim, i.e. textual changes introduced by the scribes, some of which concern the Torah. According to the Tanhuma and Yalkut ha-Makhirt, it was the anshei kenesset hagedolah who changed certain words in the Torah. The Masoretic work Okhlah ve-Okhlah and R. Joshua Lisser credit Ezra with the textual changes. The 'Arukh, Rashi, R. David Kimhi, Yemenite Masorah, and Shemot Rabbah as explained by the standard Midrashic commentary Matanot Kehunah (which is actually the clear meaning of the text), are also explicit that the biblical text was changed by the Soferim. Although lacking in our texts, there are some versions of Shemot Rabbah 13:2 which also contain this explanation....Likewise, in a different context, Ibn Ezra asserts that the text has\n  changed since Moses' day. It should also be noted that a similar view is\n  incorporated into an edition of the Pentateuch widely used today by\n  Orthodox Jews. (J. H. Hertz, ed. The Pentateuch and Haftorahs (London, 1960), to Leviticus 1: 1.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>A stronger formulation regarding the authorship of the entire Torah was made by R. Solomon David Sassoon (Natan Hokhmah li-Shelomo, p. 106; emphasis in original) cited <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2007/08/marc-b-shapiro-forgery-and-halakhic.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הדגש הוא על מה שאומר כי משה אמר זה <strong>מפי עצמו</strong>, אבל אם יאמר פסוקים אלה נביא אחר כתב אותם מפי הגבורה ומודה שקטע זה הוא מן השמים ומפי הגבורה, אדם שאומר כך אינו נקרא אפיקורוס, מה שהגדיר אותו כאפיקורוס אינו זה שאמר שלא משה כתב את הקטע אלא בזה שהוא אומר שדבר שזה <strong>מדעתו ומפי עצמו</strong> אמרו ושאין זה <strong>מן השמים</strong> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, the definition of heresy would be to deny the divinity of the text. But to suggest post-Mosaic authorship, such as suggesting authorship by later prophets, would not be heresy, as long as the Divine origin of the text is accepted. (It should be noted that R. Sassoon is discussing attributions of passages to post-Mosaic authors. It is possible that he would draw a distinction between that and the suggestion that larger portions of the Torah are post-Mosaic.)</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https://www.ykr.org.il/Rabbi/31\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Mordechai Breuer cited <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/27379/where-can-i-find-responses-to-biblical-criticism\">elsewhere</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The standard definition of heresy as found in the vast majority of contemporary responsa on topics that require its definition, such as whether spmepne with a given belief is an acceptable conversion candidate, can be counted toward a minyan, or can one can drink wine that was handled by them is consistently the 13 fundamentals of Jewish Faith. (Perhaps with other criteria that define who is \"a heretic\" rather than simply believing heresy.) By this I mean the versions accepted into the siddur, as few require believing in the original Maimonidian version.</p>\n\n<p>That criterion for deciding which beliefs are Orthodox presumes that the question has halachic impact, and therefore while philosophical disputes in general are not resolvable through the rules of halachic decision-making, there are limits of halachically valid philosophy. (And, oddly, those limits would change with time as rulings get refined or majority shifts from one ruling to another.)</p>\n\n<p>But one can argue that there is room in Orthodoxy for other definitions of heresy. So, the above is just setting context, and not a definitive answer.</p>\n\n<p>Another such definition is that Orthodoxy is defined by halakhah, and therefore \"heresy\" is anything which removes reason for fealty to halakhah. (Ignoring any halakhos that depend on belief, for reasons that need to be added to this answer by someone who knows them.) One can possibly defend this as the loosest possible definition of heresy according to Orthodoxy, as it is hard to defend defining \"Orthodox\" in a manner that does not include observance of halakhah as part of that definition.</p>\n\n<p>So, by this criterion, the question of whether there is place for the Document Hypothesis in Orthodoxy becomes asking whether belief in Document Hypothesis contradicts assumptions necessary to justify fealty to halakhah.</p>\n\n<p>The Document Hypothesis is based on different assumptions about the nature of the text than Jewish Tradition is. We believe that the Torah, and Tanakh in general, describes events that were not typical. In fact, that the events themselves were as much part of how Hashem “wrote” His message to mankind as the books. We believe that the written Torah is Cliff Notes to a fuller body of wisdom, “merely” the seed to a Tree of Life planted among us, a process we were given and instructed how to work.  So, yes, Hashem orchestrated similar but different events, wanted Yaaqov to have 7 children in 12 years, tells the same story in different ways or calls the same person by different names, and presented the term limits of a Jewish slave in terms that engender halachic discourse.</p>\n\n<p>So, for example a Bible Critic might ask, \"Do slaves go free on the seventh year (Exod. 21:1-6, Deut. 15:12-18), or do they go free in the Jubilee (50th) year (Lev. 25:39-55)?\" and use it to conclude that different schools of thought with different practices about slavery wrote their own texts which were only later merged into our Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Chazal, of course, note the same contradiction. The Yerushalmi (Qiddushin vilna ed.6b) says that a Jewish slave is freed at shemittah (the sabbatical year) if they sold themselves or if court sold them (e.g. to repay a debt incurred stealing an item) and they wish to leave. If someone sold by court chooses not to, they go through an ear piecing ceremony (mentioned in the quoted portion of Shemos) and remain slaves until no later than the Jubilee. And this is as the Rambam codifies it as well (Avadim ch. 3).</p>\n\n<p>If someone believes that Hashem planned the Oral Torah and halachic process as part of His Intent when He composed the text, there is no question for the Bible Critic to address. That is not to dismiss the need to understand the peshat, the plain meaning of the verse. But there is no “why?”, we know the Author’s motivation to at times make that peshat less than obvious — there are other layers that we can only find through those indicators. They are not imperfections to be attributed to a human element in authorship or inconsistencies to be attributed to redaction.</p>\n\n<p>There is something paradoxical about the belief in a text that evolved from the voices of prophets into Hashem’s word. If you accept that the final complicated product is indeed Hashem’s Word, and that Word is of the sort that supports Jewish Tradition and the halachic process, there is no longer motivation to speak of multiple “voices of prophets”.</p>\n\n<p>Underlying the whole exercise was the presumption that Oral Torah and halakhah are an afterthought, and not part of the original texts. Thus Chazal’s answers come across as a weak apologetic, rather than reflecting the true body of the full corpus of the Torah in which the Oral and Written are a single entity. And I do not believe that traditional Shabbos observance can stand on that foundation.</p>\n\n<p>It is not coincidental that once that JTS invited Document Hypothesis into their tent, they ended up fostering a legal system that does not resemble what Orthodoxy considers halakhah. Once all the pieces are there to conclude that rabbis of the past were playing a game with derashah to remake the law as they wanted, they have no reason not to do the same themselves. (And if even deOraisos are man-made, it's all fair game.)</p>\n\n<p>Even by this looser definition of heresy, that which removes the rationale for the observance of the \"duties of the limbs\", Document Hypothesis qualifies as heretical.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First we need to figure out if belief in Mosaic authorship is an ikar emuna (if it is, that would obviously mean that there is no room for it in observant Judaism, since it would be labeled as heresy). We also need to address the question if the study of biblical criticism threatens the authority of the Torah and its divine origin.</p>\n<h2>The main Chazalic sources</h2>\n<p>Now, the Mishna in Sanhedrin 90a states,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and these (listed below) don’t get a portion in the world to come:\none who says ‘there is resurrection of the dead according to the\nTorah’; or ‘Torah is not divine etc[1].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the main source regarding the parameters of emuna and kefira/heresy. Though the Mishna only addresses the question as to “who gets oilam habu”, the Rambam assumes that this Mishna has some bearing on the question regarding “who is a heretic” as well. So far we haven’t seen anything about belief in Mosaic authorship of the Torah. The Mishna merely states that a Jew must believe in the divine origins of the Torah or that תורה מן\" השמים\". The Gemara in Sanhedrin (99b) writes regarding the words of the Mishna “Torah min hashmayim”,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for he scorned the word of god’ (Bamidbar 15:31), this refers to one\nwho says the Torah is not divine. Even if he says that the entire\nTorah is divine besides for one verse which god did not speak, but\nMoses said it on his own is included in the verse ‘for he scorned the\nword of god.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here too we don’t find any mention of Mosaic authorship being an ikar emuna, but the belief in the divine inspiration of the author/authors of the Torah.</p>\n<p>The Rambam codifies this belief in his Mishna Torah and in his Perush hamishnayot (in the beginning of perek chelek), and makes the belief of “Torah min hashamyim”, an ikar. However he adds a few words (Hilchos Teshuva 3:8) that are not mentioned in the Gemara itself: “אם אמר משה”, “if Moses said it”. It is not clear if the Rambam is trying to say that the belief in Mosaic authorship is in itself an ikar (meaning that doubting this in itself constitutes heresy), or that the Rambam is merely giving an example of a prophet (Moses), saying that mere doubting that the transcriber of the Torah was a prophet constitutes heresy, since that would be the equivalent of denying the divinity of the Torah altogether. The words of the Rambam in Perush Hamishnayot are too ambiguous to tell us anything conclusively on the question of Mosaic authorship, but we can deduce from his ikrei emunah how he would have viewed the evolutionary aspect of the documentary hypothesis as we will see now.</p>\n<p>The Rambam in his 8th ikar emuna writes that a Jew must believe that the way Tefillin and Succah is done by Jews today is the same way it was done in the days of Moses. Since the documentary hypothesis posits that the Torah and Halacha has evolved, it would clearly constitute heresy according to the Rambam. However since the ikar is not mentioned in the Mishna or Talmud, the defender of biblical criticism (in accordance with Jewish law) may argue that it still fits the scope of \"תורה מן השמים\", as he agrees that Chazal interpreted the Torah through divine inspiration, and may come to regard the above ikar an invention of the Rambam himself. On the other hand, we must admit that the documentary hypothesis would most probably constitute heresy according to the Rambam.</p>\n<h2>The orthodox minimalist view</h2>\n<p>The first affirmation of the orthodox minimalist view that \"Mosaic authorship of the Torah\" is an ikar emuna is found in the Ani Maamin[2] (article number 8), “I believe with perfect faith that the entire Torah presently in our possession is the one given to Moses.\" This is a clear declaration that a Jew must believe that the Torah was written by Moses himself, and that it wasn't tampered by anyone else besides for Moses. According to this position, one who doesn’t accept the Mosaic authorship of the Torah is a heretic. However, as we have already seen this does not necessarily reflect the view of Chazal or the Rambam, in their words the only belief required of the Jew is that he believe that the Torah is of divine origin. That Mosaic authorship is an ikar emuna (not merely a Jewish tradition) is an invention of the author of Ani Maamin. See also Tiferes Yisroel beginning of perek chelek ois vav, he seems to agree with the author of the Ani Maamin that Mosaic authorship is an ikar. See also Shut R’ Moshe, YD 3 vol. 6, siman 114-116. From these teshuvos It is evident that he accepts Mosaic authorship for an ikar, though he doesn’t feel the need to defend this position as it is self-evident to him.</p>\n<h2>The maximalist view: Ibn ezra and other chazalic sources</h2>\n<p>Now the Ibn Ezra (the Tzafenat Panaeach also cites him in the end of Parshat Vayishlach) in a few places in his commentary hints that the Torah might have been edited by different people, and that certain words were added only after the Israelites conquered the land (see his commentary on Dvarim 1:2). See also the Tziyuni al haTorah Bamidbar 21:17. This supports the position that belief in Mosaic authorship is not an ikar emuna, and that dismissal of it is not heresy (unless we say that the Ibn Ezra himself was a heretic[3]). The Tzafenat Panaeach also writes clearly that Mosaic authorship is not an ikar emunah</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And since we must believe in the words of tradition and prophecy, what\ndifference does it make whether Moses or some other prophet wrote it,\nsince the words of all of them are truth and given through prophecy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is also evidence from the Midrashic literature that the Torah was edited by other scribes. In a few places (see for example Rashi Breishis 18:22) the Rabbis point out that it would have been more appropriate for the Torah to write in different way, only that the scribes (Ezra and his assembly) edited it when they felt the need to. “ תיקון סופרים הוא זה\". From these and other similar statememts we see that the Rabbis themselves were comfortable with the idea that the Torah was edited by different people other than Moses, although they surely believed that they all did so with divine inspiration[4]. This lends credence to the idea that Mosaic authorship was never intended to be an ikar emunah, as the Rabbis themselves questioned this tradition. A similar tradition is found in Bamidbar rabbah (III, 13) in the name of yesh omrim that the Eser nekudot signify that they were added by Ezra himself,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If Elijah comes and asks: \"why have you written these words?\" I [Ezra] Shall\nanswer: \"That is why i dotted these words\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also Rashi Dvarim 34:5 regarding the last eight verses of the Torah.</p>\n<p>(Note: nowhere does the Torah claim that it was written in its entirety by Moses . The Torah only states in a few places that the previous Parsha was written by Moses, but that never includes the whole book. After Parshas Mishpatim (Shmos 24:4) the Torah makes such a statement. And the same claim we find by the Maso’es of the Israelites (Bamidbar 33:2). The only book that is claimed to be written (almost) in its entirety by Moses is sefer Devarim (31:9)[5]. [Indeed this is the only sefer that’s called “Toras Moshe” in the Tanach. See Joshua 8:32; 2 Melachim 14:6]. And even that doesn’t preclude small edits by other scribes).</p>\n<h2>Resolving the issues</h2>\n<p>Although we haven’t seen anything yet close to the study of biblical criticism or the belief in the documentary hypothesis (saying that small edits cropped in the text is wholly different than saying that different portions were written by different authors and only compiled much later) some modern Rabbis stretch this argument and say: since we haven’t seen anything conclusive yet in the Gemara or in the Poskim regarding the belief in Mosaic authorship, and we do find some Rabbinic literature (and Rishonic literature as well) supporting the idea that Mosaic authorship in the traditional sense is not an ikar, there is no reason for us to draw the line and stop here, for this would be an arbitrary distinction; by the same token we may accept the documentary hypothesis within the boudaries of the Jewish belief system[6].</p>\n<p>One might still argue and say, if we acknowledge the scholarly position that portions of the Torah were written by different authors, when they often contradict each other, then we are essentially denying the divinity of the Torah, since Hashem surely does not utter contradictions! This problem can easily be resolved through the Gemara in Eiruvin 13b, “three years the Bais Shammai and Bais Hillel argued, one would say the Halacha is like us and one would say the Halacha is like us, a heavenly voice came out and announced: both [schools] are the words of god, but the Halacha is like Bais Hillel etc.” The concept of \"אלו ואלו דברי אלהים חיים\" states that even two contradictory opinions can be true in the sense of them both being divinely inspired. In a similar vein, all of the different contradictory verses evident in the Torah can be said to be divinely inspired, as every author tries to derive new laws from the broad principles set forth by Moses which are the words of Hashem. We can even say that all 613 Mitzvos are of Mosaic origin, since all of the Mitzvos can effectively be attributed to Moses as the authors of the Torah all derived their laws from his words. This theory is advanced by Jacob Milgrom in the introduction to his book Leviticus (a book of ritual and ethics) where he shows that even critical scholarship can believe in the Mosaic origin of the Mitzvos.</p>\n<p>This theory works for the biblical narratives as well; although they were composed by different authors each writing down their own version of the biblical oral traditions that were passed down to them, they were all equally inspired by God to speak and write and inspire the Jewish nation to be morally upright and follow in the footsteps of their ancestors.</p>\n<p>Here, the conservative may argue that if we admit that there are different versions (of narratives) in the Torah, then we are essentially saying that some parts of the Torah are not factual, since when we’re dealing with contradictory versions, obviously, only one can be a factual account. However, one can still argue that the minimum requirement is that the Jew believes in the divine origin of the Torah, since it is sensible to believe in the documentary hypothesis and at the same time believe that the authors were divinely inspired (as we have proven from the Gemara in Eruvin), this would suffice for the belief in “תורה מן השמים”.</p>\n<p>If one accepts biblical criticism he must reject the notion that the words of the Torah were dictated by God to a single prophet, since God cannot dictate contradictory laws. He must say that the Torah is heavenly in the sense that it has been divinely inspired by its authors, akin to the inspiration of the Jewish sages when they composed the Mishna and Talmud. However this does not deter some modern orthodox Rabbis to embrace such a belief, since nowhere is it mentioned that divine dictation is an ikar emuna. The position that biblical criticism and Jewish orthodox belief system are compatible is advanced by a few modern orthodox Jewish Rabbis including: Rabbi Louis Jacobs in his book “we have reason to believe”; Abraham Joshua Heschel professor at the JTS[7]; David Weiss Halivni[8]; Rabbi Jeremy Rosen[9].</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>Though mainstream orthodoxy does not allow for any other biblical authors besides for Moses and advances the minimalist position that the entire Torah was given to Moses by God word for word, and considers this belief to be an ikar emuna, some Rishonim allow for some edits to have been added after Moses’s death by divinely inspired scribes. Since biblical criticism is a relatively new phenomemnon we cannot know if the Rishonim and Rabbis would have endorsed such a radical view. However, since Mosaic authorship is not mentioned in the Gemara or the Rambam to be an ikar emuna (unequivocally), some modern orthodox Rabbis embrace biblical criticism and take the maximalist position in regards the definition of \"תורה מן השמים\" and define it as a \"divinely inspired\" code of law, this allows for multiple authors and even contradictions in the bible to coexist with the belief in \"Torah is from Heaven\".</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] Literally it translates to “Torah is not from heaven”. [2] A composition that is based on the Rambam’s ikarim, but was not composed by the Rambam himself, and has some significant differences with the Rambam’s original ikarim enumerated in his Perush hamishnayot. The author of the Ani Maamin is unknown. [3] Rabbi Mordechai Breuer in his debate with Professor Israel Knohl remarked, “I do not know if [ibn Ezra’s] words were to the liking of the rabbis. In any event, they were uttered by Ibn Ezra, and we can therefore not reject their legitimacy.” [4] However, see Tiferes Yisroel for different interpretation. Almost all the meforshim explain it similarly. But of course my interpretation of the Midrash is more straightforward. See also Dr. Marc Shapiro in \"Maimonides' Thirteen Principles: The Last Word in Jewish Theology?\". His words have been quoted by mevaqesh in his answer. See also Abarbenel's introduction to Jeremiah regarding the meaning of keri and ketiv. JPS Torah commentary Numbers by Jacob Milgrom pp. 375-376 that according to one medieval tradition the verses in bamidbar (10:35-36) were excerpted from a source known as \"The prophecy of Eldad and Medad\". This idea may be alluded to by R' Yehuda Hanasi when he says \"[They are marked] to indicate that they form a separate book\" (sifri bamidbar 84).\n[5] However see Ramban Devarim 31:9. But this is not the only way to read the verse. The simple interpretation is that it refers to sefer Devarim only. [6] However see Tzafenat Panaeach end of Vayishlach. He writes that the Ibn Ezra himself did not endorse large scale criticism as is evident from his commentary to Breishis 36:31.

    "content": "# Why no \"Musaf\" for Korban Pesach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Your average Jews in Temple times did not go participate actively in the regularly scheduled Temple offerings. For them, probably the biggest sacrificial experience of the year was the Korban Pesach on 14 Nissan afternoon. It is one of the two positive commandments in the Torah (along with Brit Milah) that have a punishment of Karet (Mishna Kereitot 1:1), women are obligated in it despite its being a positive time bound commandment (Rambam KP 1:1), it has a second opportunity to be brought (Numbers 9), and seems in Tanakh to be a central part of a Jew's religious experience. 14 Nissan was seen as a holiday, with its own prohibition on Chametz (Pesachim 5a), a prohibition on doing labor (Pesachim 50), and Hallel being recited in the Temple (Pesachim 64) accompanied by flutists (Arachin 10).</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (Brachot 26b) tells us that the prayer services enacted by Chazal were based on the Temple sacrifices (hence, the existence of an extra \"Musaf\" prayer on days when there was a Korban Musaf).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why did Chazal not enact a liturgical commemoration of the Korban Pesach on 14 Nissan?</strong> There could have been an extra Amida said after Mincha (a pseudo-Musaf).

These forms of the blessing had never been heard of before, or even seen as necessary, by any scholar of any previous generation; not the Tannaim, not the Amoraim, not the Geonim.</p>\n\n<p>This type of thing arises in numerous instances and no one seems to ask in response why, if the <em>halakhah</em> was 'good enough' for the earlier scholars/authorities, it needs to be changed or altered.</p>\n\n<p>My question is:\nIs this type of innovation warranted, necessary, or even possible? Shouldn't the <em>halakhah</em> remain unless changed by either reality or an authorized <em>beth din</em> [<em>ha-gadhol</em>]?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The basic principle of later authorities introducing new ideas and addressing them even though earlier authorities had obviously left things as is, is addressed in Chulin 6b-7a. </p>\n\n<p>Chizkiyahu destroyed the copper snake from Moshe Rabbeinu due to avoda zara issues. The gemara asks is it possible Assa and Yehoshaphat didn't destroy it? But they destroyed all the avoda zara? The gemara answers that they let room for Chizkiyahu to become great. Rabi Yehuda HaNasi used this story to give credence to his decision to accept the testimony of a certain talmid chacham and obviate Beis Shaan from the laws of Maaser, something which no-one was willing to do until then. \n Notice two points, that Chizkiyahu was being machmir and Rebi was being Meikel. A second point is that Chizkiyahu made a self reliant decision contrary to previous acts, whereas Rebi was accepting testimony contrary to previous practice. But Rabi Yehuda and the Gemara had no issue comparing them and neither should we.</p>\n\n<p>The gemara goes on to prove from here that if a Talmid Chacham says a halacha one should not dismiss his words. The gemara has three versions of how not to react to him. Don't say he didn't actually hear this, or don't say his words are ridiculous and don't say his haughty nature caused him to not listen to his teacher properly. </p>\n\n<p>There is always room to invent.

Sefirat HaOmer, on the other hand, is a biblical command to count 50 days from the offering of the <em>Korban Omer</em> which only makes sense incrementally since the actual date of the latter korban of the <em>shtei halechem</em> is dependent on that of the former of the <em>omer</em>.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The verses regarding the mitzvah of counting read:</p>\n\n<p>Leviticus 23:15-16:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וּסְפַרְתֶּ֤ם לָכֶם֙ מִמָּחֳרַ֣ת הַשַּׁבָּ֔ת מִיּוֹם֙ הֲבִ֣יאֲכֶ֔ם\n  אֶת־עֹ֖מֶר הַתְּנוּפָ֑ה <strong>שֶׁ֥בַע שַׁבָּת֖וֹת תְּמִימֹ֥ת\n  תִּהְיֶֽינָה׃</strong> עַ֣ד מִֽמָּחֳרַ֤ת הַשַּׁבָּת֙ הַשְּׁבִיעִ֔ת\n  תִּסְפְּר֖וּ <strong>חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים</strong> י֑וֹם וְהִקְרַבְתֶּ֛ם מִנְחָ֥ה חֲדָשָׁ֖ה\n  לַיהוָֽה׃</p>\n  \n  <p>And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the day of rest,\n  from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the waving; <strong>seven weeks\n  shall there be complete</strong>; even unto the morrow after the seventh week\n  shall ye number <strong>fifty</strong> days; and ye shall present a new meal-offering\n  unto the LORD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Within the verses, there is a progression as well as a specific number.

AFAIK, in making \"shmurah matzot\" The <strong>wheat</strong> is being watched, not the matzah, itself. Perhaps, from the time it comes out of the oven until it's packaged, it's watched, but, then again, so are \"non shmurah\" matzot, and I don't think that's what the term applies to, anyway.</p>\n\n<p>So why not call it מצה מתבואה שמורה or something similar.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> I used the term תבואה because nowadays, matzot are also commonly made from oats and spelt, and not just wheat.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Normal matza is \"watched completely from grinding to baking\" -- yes, at the baking stage it's matza, at the grinding stage it's \"flour.\" So we refer to extra-shmurah as \"matza that was watched completely, from harvesting to baking.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Shmura (\"guarded\") matzah (Hebrew מַצָּה שְׁמוּרָה maṣṣā šəmūrā) is made from grain that has been under special supervision from the time it was harvested to ensure that no fermentation has occurred, and that it is suitable for eating on the first night of Passover. </p>\n\n\n",

It then goes on to say that if she brought a bondwoman (into the marriage?) that exempts her from certain of the chores, and if she brings a second then she's exempted from even more, and so on up to four (when she's exempt from everything on the list).  R' Eliezer dissents and says that even if she brought a hundred bondwomen she'd have to do one of the chores.</p>\n\n<p>All this got me wondering: who supports these bondwomen?  Is a husband automatically obligated to do so, the same as he maintains his wife?  Only for ones that predate their marriage (he knew what he was getting into)?  Only if this was specifically negotiated?  Only up to a certain number (and we assume R' Eliezer is exaggerating)?  And if he doesn't, is his wife likely to be able to or would her father somehow still be obligated or what?</p>\n\n\n",

But my question is why the debate at all? Where from the Torah's verses does anyone derive that there even needs to be any type of guarding from harvesting?

This rule-of not discarding bread with the rest of one's garbage-probably doesn't have to do with Val tashchis, because it applies only to pieces that are a kezayis or larger (Shulchan Aruch 180:4 though see Mishnah Berurah 180:10 for a stringency not to discard bread crumbs that would combine to be a kezayis).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>from: <a href=\"http://thehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/Vol3Issue6.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thehalacha.com/wp-content/uploads/Vol3Issue6.pdf</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Bread may be used for any purpose as long as it is not used in a disrespectful manner and the bread will not be\n  ruined by what you are doing to it.7 One should not pass a cup of wine over a piece of bread because the wine\n  may fall on the bread and make it uneatable. Similarly, one should not place raw meat onto a piece of bread.8\n  One is allowed to use bread to cover food in a utensil, since this is not showing disrespect to the bread because\n  it will be eaten as part of the food.9 Accordingly, it is common for caterers to use a bread-like food to cover the\n  soup at weddings to retain the heat.10 When reciting kiddush one may place a siddur on top of the challah\n  cover.11 Similarly, one who wants to lift up a sefer may place bread underneath the sefer in order to lift it.12\n  When washing mayim achronim one should be careful not to let the water fall onto bread.13 Many caterers bake bread in a round shape, hollow the inside, and fill the space with soup (the bread is hard so no soup leaks\n  through).

The Rosh, Tur, and other great Rishonim rule likewise.

Also, I believe there may be midrashic/kabbalistic analogies between man and bread.</p>\n\n\n",

This was the psak of my rav and I did not ask for his reasoning. I think that it is probably because the CO2 is not derived from chametz, but you must CYLOR.</p>\n\n<p>There is a discussion at <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/kosher_articles/carbon_dioxide_for_pesach.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Carbon Dioxide for Pesach</a> which explains how CO2 generation was originally chametz, but nowadays is no longer a problem.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>With this understanding, we can now address the question of whether\n  carbon dioxide recovered from a chametz fermentation should be\n  forbidden on Pesach.  It turns out that the technology of recovering\n  carbon dioxide has steadily progressed over the past 100 years.  At\n  first scientists figured out how to liquefy the carbon dioxide\n  escaping from these reactions but had no effective method of purifying\n  these vapors.  As such, in those days, the liquid carbon dioxide\n  likely did have a carryover of taste from the beer or whisky it was\n  made from, and for that reason, the Poskim of that era concluded that\n  the carbon dioxide was forbidden on Pesach.  </p>\n  \n  <p>However, in the past 50 years, the industry has developed 5 different\n  methods of purifying the carbon dioxide6 – four while it is in the\n  gaseous state, and a fifth after it is liquefied – to the point that\n  nowadays carbon dioxide recovered from beer or whisky bears absolutely\n  no taste of the original liquid it was created from.  We can surmise\n  that that this change of facts is why when the question was presented\n  to Rav Auerbach, he ruled that it is surely permitted!  Rav Auerbach\n  appears to have held that a vapor/condensate only retains the status\n  of the original liquid if it also retains the taste of that liquid,\n  and since nowadays the carbon dioxide has absolutely no taste of the\n  original beverage, it is not forbidden as chametz.  [See the footnote\n  for an alternate explanation of these halachos.]7  </p>\n  \n  <p>Of the kashrus agencies we conferred with, we found that many chose to\n  take a strict approach and not allow carbon dioxide from chametz or\n  even kitnios (but they took varying approaches to verifying the source\n  of the carbon dioxide)8 but others came to the conclusion outlined\n  above that one may be lenient nowadays.9  Due to the (commendable)\n  strictness with which people traditionally treat questions of chametz,\n  the cRc only certifies seltzer or soda after verifying that the carbon\n  dioxide is not recovered from chametz (but does accept it from kitnios\n  sources).  While this may not be required on strict halachic grounds,\n  it is within the spirit of חומרא דפסח to be machmir on this matter.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Postscript  </p>\n  \n  <p>The following are some relevant facts about the current carbon dioxide\n  market:  </p>\n  \n  <p>Nowadays, beer companies typically do collect the carbon dioxide\n  vapors escaping from their fermenters for reuse in their products, and\n  it is very rare for them to sell the carbon dioxide to others.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Most whisky and ethanol produced in the United States is kitnios, not\n  chametz. Due to an overabundance of carbon dioxide byproduct, it is\n  uncommon for a producer (e.g. a whisky or ethanol plant) to recover\n  the carbon dioxide unless they have a specific buyer in mind.  In\n  fact, typically the carbon dioxide resellers are the ones who install\n  the collection equipment in the producer of their choice, and then\n  remain with that producer for many years.  As such, although many new\n  ethanol plants have opened up in the USA in recent years, it may take\n  many years before the carbon dioxide produced in those plants is ever\n  used in seltzer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Z'roa Netuya refers to the threat of a <em>future</em> violent act, just as a 'drawn sword' represents the threat of an attack, not the attack itself. And the possuk cited refers to a drawn sword seen in the skies over Yerushalayim, a <em>future</em> threat, not an attack.</p>\n\n<p>I believe it is Netziv who asks why --out of frustration--Par'oh did not simply kill all of Bnei Yisrael in retaliation for the makkot. He answers that the makkot were Hashem's yad chazaka, but that there was another constant as well. To keep Par'oh off-balance Hashem arranged to kill off his ministers one by one. It is this aspect of haShem's hashgacha we call the Z'roa Netuya, and it kept Par'oh busy replacing those ministers. As a result of this ongoing (and future) threat to his government's stability, Par'oh had no time to act against Bnei Yisrael.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I can answer the second part of your question. The pasuk is quoted in order to make a \"Gezairas Shava\" between the two words \"נְטוּיָה\" in order to show that the word נְטוּיָה refers to a sword.</p>\n\n<p>A \"Gezairas Shava\" is one of the exegesic principle by which the Torah is elucidated. The basic premise of Gezairas Shava is that the occurrence of the same word in two places comes to indicate a connection between the two places where that same word is mentioned. The exact details are beyond the scope of this answer, but this principle is extremely common in Medrash - tradition-based Biblical exegesis.</p>\n\n<p>So in this case, we might wonder what exactly נְטוּיָה comes to indicate. We realize than another occurrence of נְטוּיָה is found in another Pasuk in Tanach to refer to a sword, and surmise that the first occurrence also refers to a sword. That is what the Haggada is trying to say.</p>\n\n\n",

This was certified by one of the people who was in the class at the time and who was involved in writing the FAQ.</p>\n\n<p>When I helped writh the soc.culture.jewish FAQ on usenet, we explained it as follows.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/11-03-01.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why do some people write \"G-d\" with a hyphen instead of an `o'?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>Question 11.3.1: Writing:</strong> Why do some people write \"G-d\" with a hyphen\n  instead of an `o'?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n  \n  <p>Based on the words in Deut. 12:3-4, the Rabbis deduced that it is\n  forbidden to erase the name of G-d from a written document. Since any\n  paper upon which G-d's name was written might be discarded and thus\n  \"erased\", the Rabbis forbade explicitly writing the name of G-d,\n  except in Holy Books, with provisions for the proper disposal of such\n  books.</p>\n  \n  <p>According to Jewish Folklore, G-d has 70 names. However, only one of\n  these names is the ineffable name, which cannot be erased or\n  pronounced. Further, of the 70 names, seven may not be erased but they\n  can be pronounced on certain occasions (such as when reading the\n  Torah). The other names may be erased and pronounced, but still must\n  be treated with respect. The Talmud (Shevuot 35a-b) makes it clear\n  that this prohibition applies only to seven Biblical names of G-d and\n  not to other names or attributes of G-d, which may be freely written.\n  The prohibition was later codified by Maimonides (Mishneh Torah,\n  Yesodei HaTorah 6:1-2). The practice of writing \"G-d\" is supported in\n  Shut Achiezer, 3:32, end, where it is endorsed and accepted as the\n  prevailing custom. Rambam cites Deut. 12-03:04, which states \"and you\n  shall destroy the names of pagan gods from their places. You shall not\n  do similarly to G-d your Lord.\" The intent of this is to create an\n  atmosphere of respect for G-d's name vs pagan gods names.</p>\n  \n  <p>As a result of this, people acquired the habit of not writing the full\n  name down in the first place. Strictly speaking, this only applies to\n  Hebrew on a permanent medium, but many people are careful beyond the\n  minimum, and have applied it to non-Hebrew languages. Hence, \"G-d\".\n  One explanation is that using G-d is a reminder that anything which we\n  may say about G-d is necessarily metaphorical. Spelling out the Name\n  (even in a language other than Hebrew) would imply that one could\n  speak meaningfully (not just metaphorically) about G-d.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, the Shach (Yoreh De'a 179:11) ruled that \"God\" spelled in a\n  foreign language does NOT have the status of a \"shem\" and thus may be\n  erased, lehatkhila. There is a story about Rav Soloveitchik (z\"l)\n  intentionally writing GOD on the board while teaching a class and then\n  just as deliberately and intentionally erasing it, so as to\n  demonstrate by his own example that this was not a halakhically a\n  problem.</p>\n  \n  <p>Conservative (ref:\n  <a href=\"http://communities.msn.com/JudaismFAQs&naventryid=160\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://communities.msn.com/JudaismFAQs&naventryid=160</a>) and Reform\n  practice is to use \"God\". However, even some who are not strict (or\n  even observant) in general will write \"G-d\", to emphasize that Jewish\n  conceptions of G-d are meant.</p>\n  \n  <p>Note: There is one exception to the destruction of G-d's name. In\n  Numbers 6, the Suspected Wife Ceremony, a man who suspects his wife of\n  adultery (with witnesses seeing a forbidden seclusion) brings his wife\n  to the temple. The Priests test the women by pronouncing the horrible\n  Biblical curse. After reading the curse it is written on parchment and\n  dissolved in water (which the women drinks). If she is guilty she dies\n  and otherwise the couple gets their marriage back. Thus, G-d actually\n  allows the ineffable name to be dissolved in water that the women\n  drinks. As the Talmud notes: G-d allows the ineffable name to be\n  erased for the sake of bringing peace between a husband and wife.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

First, we learn here that (according to this berayta), there is a mitsva to start Shema as soon as possible, or at least, to stop the Tora's learning when the time of Shema's reciting is comming (1). We learn also that according to the related event, <strong>Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua</strong> and <strong>Rabbi Akiva</strong> are agreing on one thing. The starting time of Shema.</p>\n<p>As soon in comments, in Mishna and Gemara, in Rishonim, all this is dealt extensively.</p>\n<p>First the opinion of <strong>Rabbi Eliezer</strong> is in Mishna and is explained in Gemara.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Berachot 9b) Mishnah: From what time may one recite the Shema in the morning?  <strong>from the time that one can distinguish between</strong> blue and white.  <strong>Rabbi Eliezer says: between blue and green</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Secondly, the time of KS according to <strong>Rabbi Akiva</strong>, two beraytot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Berachot 9b): <strong>Rabbi Akiba says</strong>: Between an ass and a wild ass.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, two versions of Rabbi Akiva's opinion according to Rabbi Shim'on, his student, are mentioned above Berachot 8b. ,I follow the lecture of the Baal Hamaor in this Gemara, which is literal and easy to explain.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It was taught, Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai says: Sometimes a man may recite the Shema' twice in the night, once before the dawn breaks and once <strong>after the dawn breaks</strong>, and thereby fulfil his duty once <strong>for the day</strong> and once for the night.</p>\n<p>...  'He thereby fulfils his duty once for the day ... <strong>It is in reality night, but he calls day because some people rise at that time</strong>.</p>\n<p>... Some people refer this [statement] of Rabbi Aha bar Hanina to the following lesson, which has been taught: Rabbi Simeon ben Yohai says <strong>in the name of Rabbi Akiba</strong>: Sometimes a man may recite the Shema' twice in the day-time, once before sunrise and once <strong>after sunrise</strong>, and thereby <strong>fulfill his duty once for the day</strong> and once for the night...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, we already see two opinions regarding the opinion of rabbi Akiva according to Rabbi Shim'on {despite that the second berayta only mention Rabbi Akiva, see Raavad who points this, we don't want to address this detail}. The Berayta of the Hagada may be congruent to the first, so Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Eliezer may agree regarding shema's time.</p>\n<p>Regarding <strong>Rabbi Yehoshua</strong>, it seems from the Gemara Berachot 25b that he aggrees to Rabbi Eliezer regarding the fact that preferentially it's better to recite Shema before the first rising of the sun.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>May we say that the Mishnah teaches anonymously the same as Rabbi Eliezer, who said that [the Shema' may be recited] until the rising of the sun?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what is the hour of the reported event quoted in the Hagada, when the students have told the rabbis that they need to stop the Exodus learning because of the <code>erliest time for morning Shema</code>? I think that this time was the time in which we can distinguish between blue and green or between an ass and a wild ass.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>(1): See Gemara Berachot 5b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תניא, אבא בנימין אומר: על שני דברים הייתי מצטער כל ימי - על תפלתי שתהא לפני מטתי...‏ לא תימא לפני מטתי, אלא אימא: סמוך למטתי. ‏‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It has been taught: Abba Benjamin says, All my life I took great pains about two things: that my prayer should be before my bed ... etc... Do not read 'before my bed', but 'near my bed.</p>\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סמוך למטתי. כל ימי נזהרתי שלא לעשות מלאכה ושלא לעסוק בתורה כשעמדתי ממטתי עד שאקרא ק''ש ואתפלל: ‏‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

    "content": "# Can someone help me understand Genesis Rabbah 4?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The beginning of Genesis Rabbah 4 talks mainly about the firmament in creation account. It goes as follows (from the Artscroll Mesorah publication): </p>\n\n<p>(4:2): \"At the moment the Holy One, Blessed is He, said, 'let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters', the middle drop of the waters of the universe crusted and the lower heavens and the upper highest heaves were made.\"</p>\n\n<p>This I understand less. What does it mean, when it says, \"the middle drop of the waters of the universe crusted?\" </p>\n\n<p>If there are two firmaments, \"lower heavens and upper highest heaves\" (as the footnote in this publication says), shouldn't there be three waters (waters above, waters between, and waters below)? </p>\n\n<p>Also, in 4:1 it says that the firmament itself is water. How can something which is water separate water? What is the firmament? What is the water? etc. </p>\n\n<p>I am very confused. Could someone please explain? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I read that piece, I imagined a giant onion of water, with lots of layers. When Hashem created the firmament, He took one of the middle layers and \"crusted\" it, such that it became solid. He then took a lower layer, still with plenty of water beneath it, and did the same thing, emptying out all the water between these two layers. (Based on note 3 in the Artscroll.) Thus, the firmament was made of water, as 4:1 depicts, yet there's no middle waters, because, well, they don't exist. (Besides, if there <em>were</em> middle waters, we would be required to make use of our gills. Little-known science fact is that all vertebrates have gills, just that most don't or can't use them.)</p>\n\n<p>The entire second day of creation is difficult to understand. For that matter, the entire week of creation is difficult to understand. Kudos to you for not letting that stop you from trying, though. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Like we learn from the opening words from Kabbalat Shabbat (Tehillim 95:1-4) we can understand the Upper Wisdom of the Torah via the allegorical models of the Lower Wisdom. The Upper Wisdom refers to the wisdom of the Kabbalah. To a large extent, what is found in Midrash is based upon these inner teachings of the Torah. The Lower Wisdoms refers to the 7 sciences (mathematics, chemistry, physics, mettalurgy, etc.).</p>\n\n<p>What you are translating as \"the middle drop of the waters of the universe crusted\", is actually from the Hebrew: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>גלדה טיפה האמצעית</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The middle drop (of water) froze...</p>\n\n<p>This root <em>גלדה</em> is better translated as freezing, becoming ice. What it is describing is the transition from liquid to solid. The liquid state is more like what is described in modern Physics as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronology_of_the_universe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">plasma state of existence at the beginning of the Big Bang</a>. The point of transition from <em>Liquid</em> to <em>Solid</em> is referred to as the point in the expansion of the universe when <em>Large-Scale Structure Formation</em> started to take place.</p>\n\n<p>A very good allegory for the firmament (<em>Rakia</em>) in this case is the concept of an <a href=\"http://www.memidex.com/inversion+chemistry\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">inversion layer</a> as discussed in chemistry. What is described as <em>Rakia</em> would be the analog of the inversion layer.</p>\n\n<p>In this case, the concept of the transition from dextro-rotary (right rotating particles) molecules to their chiral (mirror) counterparts, levi-rotary (left rotating particles) molecules corresponds to the mirror aspect of the transition from the spiritual to the physical.</p>\n\n<p>A second good allegorical model from chemistry is called a phase separation or to be more precise, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aqueous_two-phase_system\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aqueous Bi-Phasic System</a>. In this case, there are quite literally two <em>Waters</em>, aqueous solutions, which are separated or distinguished by the transitional phase which is also <em>Water</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Again, the <em>Rakia</em> is the layer of transition (the phase separation between the upper waters and the lower waters). That transitional point  also corresponds to the ideas of <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4k6iUn2HoA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nekuda, Kav and Shetach</a></em> which are discussed in the Kabbalistic areas of the Torah discussing the same subject.</p>\n\n<p>The significance of this aspect is that like is understood from the geometric definition, a point (<em>Nekuda</em>) and a line (<em>Kav</em>) do not occupy space, meaning the type of existence as we know it. Similarly, a plane (<em>Shetach</em>) occupies space only from the point of observation above or below the plane itself. If one observes the plane from the level of the plane itself, it has the appearance and qualities of the line (<em>Kav</em>) which means it does not occupy space. It does not appear to exist at all.</p>\n\n<p>Another important concept that relates to this particular allegory is that Phase Separation is used for the process of performing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraction_(chemistry)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">extractions</a> which corresponds to the idea of <em><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380805/jewish/Rectifying-Sparks.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birrur HaNetzutzot</a></em> which we perform through the performance of the Mitzvot and the reciting of the accompanying Brachot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Firmament is a weird word that you basically only see in old bibles in this passage.</p>\n\n<p>We understand that there were \"waters\" and the \"firmament\" was a separation introduced to make two sections of \"water.\" Your midrash rabbah says that this separating layer became the world but was made from the \"waters\"</p>\n\n<p>I put \"waters\" in quotation marks because these early passages invoke deep mysticism. The hebrew word for waters could also be interpreted as the plural of the word \"what.\" The \"waters\" thus refer to \"whats\" or undefined things (what?) </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to create a Seder to accommodate a large age/education range?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My family came across an interesting problem at tonight's Seder: My dad, the leader, attempted to write a Seder that attracted everyone at different times, but the actual result ended up as a particularly bad Seder beyond the norm. Here are some details:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The cousins' ages: 18, 16, 14, 12, 9, 7</li>\n<li>18 and 16 have had an excellent Jewish day school education, and the rest haven't had more than a Sunday school-level education</li>\n<li>The families of 7/9 and 12/14 traditionally leave after Tzafun, which I'd assumed was out of the youngsters' exhaustion but now seems like an active decision out of a lack of interest in Barech/Hallel/Nirtzah</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Here are the shticks that my dad tried to execute throughout the Seder:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Seder bingo - everyone got a piece of paper with a 5x5 board listing various elements of the Seder. The first person to make bingo by crossing off squares as their words got said over the course of the Seder (and get us to guess all 5 of their things, without using the words themselves) won the coveted prize of being first in line for dinner. We got a first and second place winner, but then it fell apart when everyone got bingo during the Ten Plagues.</li>\n<li>Kid-oriented Magid - my dad's traditional Magid m.o. is to get the kids to fill in the blanks. Two problems: The 7- and 9-year-olds were too shy to contribute even the things that they did know, and the 12-year-old went off on a heavily Prince of Egypt-inspired summary of the start of the story, in which everyone else pretty much was able to zone out.</li>\n<li>Modern problems - after removing the 10 drops from Kos Sheini, my dad had everyone go around and list a modern problem, and we'd remove another drop for each one. The 12-year-old thought it'd be funny to name explosive diarrhea as a problem facing the world today.</li>\n<li>Mini-debates - at various points in the Seder, my dad asked for volunteers and assigned each of them a position to defend in 30 seconds before opening up a vote on who had the best argument. The kids had no involvement whatsoever.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Basically, our problem is this: How do we keep everyone engaged at the same time? Even the adults ended up in side conversations during the kid-oriented bits, and in a post-Seder \"debriefing\" held by those of us who stayed till the end acknowledged that my dad's role was more \"traffic cop\" than \"Seder leader\" tonight. Ever since he'd started planning this year's sdarim, he'd had the idea of maybe doing something different tomorrow night, since it's the exact same crowd who already did all the traditional stuff tonight.</p>\n\n<p>What can we do at tomorrow's Seder that'll hold everyone's interest? For what it's worth, we're Reform, so hardly anything is off-limits. Our debriefing didn't come up with any solid ideas, so any and all suggestions are welcome!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I've <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/15687/472\">found</a> that I get the most engagement at a \"mixed levels of religious interest\" seder when there are lots of <em>questions</em>.  Less-engaged people don't necessarily want to hear prepared <em>divrei torah</em>, at which they will feel like bystanders -- the cousins who have only Sunday-school education compared to the older teens, in your case.</p>\n\n<p>Next time, try this: talk with the well-educated older teens in advance to get their buy-in, and then tell everyone (again, in advance) to bring questions to try to stump these cousins.  Take advantage of teenagers' natural competitiveness.  The younger cousins who are too shy to give answers, even ones they know, might be less shy about asking questions.  While it didn't involve kids or teens, I've seen similar effects when I've hosted seders attended by both rabbis and those with little education.  The latter are shy about answering but not about asking.  And do make sure you praise well-asked questions as much as you praise the answers.  (Maybe even slip them a link to this site for after <em>chag</em>. :-) )</p>\n\n<p>If just inviting questions isn't enough, maybe your dad can build some sort of game around the Q&A, like giving points or prizes or first dibs on dessert for questions that took the longest to answer.  (You'll need to set some boundaries here to avert repeats of the \"explosive\" problem.)  The main idea is to give the less-educated cousins a way to come out as winners too alongside their better-educated, older cousins.</p>\n\n\n",

And fruit juice, it is such as wine, milk, honey, olive, apple juice, pomegranate juice and all such wine's, oils and liquids -- and this, only if no water has ever mixed with them; and if any water whatsoever has mixed with them, see they become hametz.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I was searching regarding milk production in Israel and ran across the following <a href=\"http://kashrut-tnuva.co.il/milk_page.php?actions=show&id=212\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on the Tnuva website</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חלב תנובה אינו נמהל במים, ולכן לכאורה אין כל חשש לשרות מצה בחלב גם למחמירים בשרויה. אך כמו שלגבי יין נפסק בשו\"ע או\"ח סימן תס\"ב שאי אפשר ליין בלי טיפת מים הנופלת בשעת הבציר, כך אי אפשר להבטיח שבחלב לא נכנסו מעט מים, שהרי צנרת החלב עוברת שטיפות יסודיות בין ייצור לייצור. אשר על כן, לגבי לישת קמח בחלב, הדבר תלוי לכאורה במחלוקת האחרונים לגבי ביטול מעט מים במי פירות מרובים, ולהלכה, יש להחמיר</p>\n<p>Tnuva's milk is not diluted with water, and therefore in light of this there is no worry to soak matza in milk even for those who are stringent with soaking.  However, just as in regards to wine it is the opinion of the Shulchan Aruch that it is impossible to make wine without a drop of water falling in during the harvest, similarly it is impossible to guarantee that a little water didn't get into the milk, since the milk pipes are thoroughly washed between production batches.  <strong>Therefore, regarding kneading flour with milk, the issue depends as it seems on a dispute of the later sages regarding the negation of a little water in vast quantities of fruit juice, and the practice is to be stringent.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm curious if anyone can provide sources for the above mentioned dispute.</p>\n<p>I understand that the <a href=\"http://www.papouchado.co.il/?id=118\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Papouchado cookies</a> are made in this manner and where permitted by Rav Ovadia Yosef, although I don't know if they are prepared in less than 18 minutes.</p>\n\n\n",

Although lukewarm water may cause the dough to become leavened, the Gemara was not concerned because Kohanim were in charge of the Mikdash and they are \"zerizim\"; so they will not let the dough become chametz.</p>\n\n<p>So, how did the Kohanim process so many Pesach offerings in the few hours of the afternoon of the 14th of Nissan? The answer is that they were \"Zerizim\". They not only did the job quickly, but they must have taken steps to insure that time was not wasted at all, so everyone would be able to bring their Korban before time ran out!</p>\n\n<p>A Korban Pesach was designated by the head of a household and that person would then register his family and others to eat from the Korban. (see Shemos:12) Therefore, the 30,000 sheep/goats given in Divre Hayamim (Ⅱ, 35:7–9) for the Yisraelim as Korban Pesach animals, were for thirty thousand GROUPS of people; not individuals. </p>\n\n<p>I am sure that the people of the time did what they could to try and put as many people as possible onto one animal. This was not only to insure that everyone \"car-pooled\" (thereby reducing the total amount of animals needed to process), but also because any meat of the holy sacrifice should not be left over (and would be burned in the morning - Shmos 12). The more people per animal would reduce waste. So, although we do not know how many people attended above, we do know how many groups there were.</p>\n\n<p>By contrast, the 3000 cattle were assigned as a fixed number for the needs of a certain amount of people. The Chaggigah offering was used with the Pesach as additional meat so the Pesach could be eaten on a full stomach and enhance the holiday. First the Chaggigah was eaten, then the Pesach requirement was eaten on a full stomach. (See Mishnah and Gemara: Pesachim 69b - 70a with Rashi, Tosefos, and others at length for an in depth understanding) </p>\n\n<p>However, the Chaggigah was optional. (see Pesachim 69b) If there were fewer people registered on one Pesach, then there would be enough meat from the Pesach itself per person, so the Chaggigah meat was not needed. Minimally however, we would want that each lamb provide 1 olive volume of meat per registrant.(see Rambam, hilchos Korban Pesach 8:3)  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the 3000 cattle (and 500 for the Levites and 300 for the Kohanim) were given so they could eat enough meat first, before eating a minimum of Pesach meat. Furthermore, since sheep and goat can be used for the Chaggigah, we see that the exclusive use of cattle may have been for the efficiency of using a larger animal that could be processed faster than many sheep/goats. All of this was done apparently to provide the maximum registration per sheep/goat.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the 2600 Passover lambs/goats for the Kohanim should have been 3000 since the Kohanim needed 300 cattle for back up meat (similar to the other groups (Yisraelim and Leviim) who also were given 10% cattle.) However, since Kohanim are \"zerizim\", they wanted to process even less animals for the Pesach to save time. They therefore were meticulous and registered more people per lamb/goat among themselves and saved an additional 400 offerings from the busy schedule.</p>\n\n\n",

Opinions regarding the time it takes to walk a mil vary from 18-24 minutes, and here the Shulchan Arukh is strict to take the shorter time: 1/5 of an hour + 1/20 of an hour = 18 minutes 0 seconds.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I shall split the answer up.\nOne first makes the dough as I wrote as big as there is room in the oven.\nOne should use a 'pin' a kind of metal or wooden hinged bar to 'bang' it down.\nThen one should cut it with a knife (according to the r'mo but not kept) and give it out to the 'rollers' called velgerers.\nThe most important and only thing mentioned in the gemoro is heat. One has to be careful to keep it cold. Once it gets worked on and  warm the 18 minutes does not apply.\nBefore one starts one has to immerse ones hand in cold water (not kept today) to make sure its really cold. Washing negel vasser isnt good enough.\nOne holds it with only two fingers (thumb and forefinger) not the whole hand and starts to knead it. The way to do it is holding it up again with two fingers from one hand and carrying on squashing it down with the other. This is the only way one can work with the 'whole' dough at once all the time. Each time you squash it down you are squashing the whole dough not just part of it. \nTo be continued if found to be interesting. </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The whole idea of 18 minutes for becoming chometz is a mistake.</p>\n\n<p>I am specially going to write how a hand matzo has to be made, since today it is rarely done correctly. Please forgive the length of this very important post.</p>\n\n<p>The 'ran' (regarding the three women mishna system) writes that it has to be done as quickly as possible. That means if it can be done in 4 minutes and you take 5 minutes over it, that is not doing  matzot correctly.</p>\n\n<p>So you have to make a system which caters for that. Today no hand matzot which I am aware of do, against the 'ran' and all other poskim.</p>\n\n<p>The kitsur writes that one makes a dough as large as the amount of workers you have. So you have to make sure you divide all of it out immediately. I would add to speed things up that one should not make a dough larger than there is room in the oven. So each matso gets 'done' in the least possible time.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>When he feels the dough is ready he should do what is called 'aricha'. Shaping it round, putting all the folds and lines in the middle not leaving them on the outside which makes jagged edges and kfulos,  turn it over flatten it a bit, and start to 'velger'.\nOne starts 'from' the middle but not going over the middle and keeps going round and round lifting it up over the velger holz so it shouldnt stick, not velgering till the end otherwise it sticks, until it is ready. One doesnt turn it over in the middle and tries to keep the thickness even. If it is thinner in one place like in the middle it is likely to burn there. That is really all I have to say about the technical aspect of baking matzot. One should start slowly being very careful not to make kfulos and build up speed gradually. If one starts by being careful about kfulos one never makes them.\nIt is not right do it quickly and then straighten out kfulos. One doesnt type at 100 wpm and then make corrections.</p>\n\n<p>If you make kefulot and then iron them out it will leave a line or shirtut on the matso. One can often see many of these on the finished product. That proves that the person didnt know how to velger or worked too quickly. According to the r'mo one is not allowed to make kfulos specially and then iron them out because he may not iron  them out properly. He talks about a whole matso but I would say this applies even to one kfulo. Another problem is that if one makes a kefulo you have to take it out with another stick from the oven, not being used for other matzot. Making jagged sawtooth edges is also prone to making kfulos in the oven, since they bend over each other while baking. Having a mashgiach to check matzos (they are not chickens) should be unnecessary for those who can velger properly, who anyway  should be the only ones baking matzot. One doesnt use novice shochtim either.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>The r'mo says during the tekufa one has to pour out all water. So what does one do with the 'mayim shelonu'. The special well water for matso.</p>\n\n<p>He says one should put a metal object on a string and drop it into the water but should not use his hands since if he uses his hands this would heat the water.</p>\n\n<p>I am sure on a thermometer you wouldnt notice any different at all, but still you have to be machmir with heat during baking matsot.</p>\n\n<p>Our tekufot times today are not right. They should be the solstices.</p>\n\n<p>They have four halachic considerations. When to say 'v'sen tal umotor. When to keep 'nittul' since he was born on the longest darkest night, and when to pour out water and also if one makes a leap year and when to say birchas hachamo.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>carrying on.\nThe 'story' of the three women in the  mishna is that they had room for only one matso (which was then something very similar to a loaf of bread today), One started kneading the flour five minutes later she was up to the 'aricha' stage which can be translated as 'forming' the shape then the second woman started kneading. Five minutes later the first woman was up to baking the second up to forming and now the third started kneading. The idea being that not a second is wasted and each matso is done in the quickest time possible.\nThe yerushalmi says after the 'forming' (ten minutes in my example) she also had to make the oven. In the olden times that was the hardest part. Each one had to make the oven separately when their dough was finished before baking it. It sounds like they left it lying without anything being done to it. Which would be against the shulchan aruch who says one it is ready for baking it must not be left for even one second! One must say that they poured cold water over it.</p>\n\n<p>I dont understand the yerushalmi because it should have been the husbands of these three women who made the oven. The gemoro says that a poor man his wife bakes and he does the oven. </p>\n\n<p>The mishne berura says that the rosh carried his matso quite a distance to the oven so how can the Shulchan Aruch say it becomes chomets straight away! My simple answer would be again that he poured cold water over it. </p>\n\n<p>Coming back to the cold hands.\nThe MB brings the Bach who says that during the kneading and forming even if your hands are cold you still have to wash them under cold water or immerse them. He brings others  who say that is only if you are near the oven. But he finishes saying you have to be machmir. \nOne sees from here how careful they were about heat.</p>\n\n\n",

The default work prohibition includes the 39 forms of forbidden work. On Shabbat and Yom Kippur all 39 forms of forbidden work (the 39 melakhot) are prohibited. On the Yamim Tovim (the first and last days of Pesach, on Shavuot, Rosh Hashana, the first day of Sukkot and on Shemini Atzeret) the Torah permits work activities that are needed for food.

If one kneaded dough with these liquids, even if it rises, it's permitted since this isn't the Chometz which the Torah forbids.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(However, this is only true when, as it says in the next syif, these are pure.

As the \"worry\" of Gebrokts is that you might cause some flour to become Chametz, the issue would only occur if the liquid is applied to the Matzah and given time to \"rise\". So with your example of Cream Cheese, it wouldn't be an issue to spread it on the Matzah right before eating (maybe not on the whole Matzah at once, if you're a slow eater like me ;) ), however, Gebrokts keepers probably wouldn't spread Cream Cheese on their Matzah in the morning and save it for lunch.</p>\n\n<p>Source: Personal experience as a life-long member of a non-Gebrokts eating family (seriously everybody, it's not that bad). Yes, I know that isn't the best of sources, but it's what I've got.</p>\n\n\n",

The ink recipe includes flour, fruit juice, vinegar, and a little water.</p>\n\n<p>According to my cousin, it's not ראוי לאכילת אדם (edible for humans), but it might be ראוי לאכילת כלב (fit for canine consumption); while it tastes too bad for humans to eat, dogs would probably be okay eating it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Your question asked about \"making\" the ink on Pesach. \"Flour\" was one of the ingredients. If you have unguarded flour (of wheat, barley, spelt, oats, or rye,) and you want to own it, then the problem starts as soon as you pick it up to take possession. It may have gotten wet and become \"chametz\"? As flour, it is not yet mixed into the other ingredients that would make it non-edible etc. So it should be forbidden to \"make\" it, unless the flour is kept unleavened the whole time. Furthermore, just because a group of foods (flour, fruit juice, vinegar, and water,) might not taste good as a recipe, it doesn't mean that it is called non-edible! The combining of flour, water, and fruit juices = Chametz gomur (real leavened dough) which would be forbidden on Pesach unless processed in a fast way that curtails leavening.</p>\n\n<p>But, if the dough/ink is made strictly under a procedure that would follow the halachic rules for the making of matzah on pesach, then there would be no problem. </p>\n\n<p>Most people don't make matzahs on Pesach, because its easy to accidentally make \"chametz\" out of it if you are not careful.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Should be prohibited, pretty much the same as the <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%97%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%92_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishna Pesachim 3:1</a>. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אלו עוברין בפסח, כתח הבבלי, ושכר המדי, וחמץ האדומי, וזיתום המצרי, וזומן של צבעים ה, ועמילן של טבחים, <strong>וקולן של סופרים</strong>.\n  רבי אליעזר אומר, אף תכשיטי נשים.\n  זה הכלל ו, כל שהוא ממין דגן, הרי זה עובר בפסח.\n  הרי אלו באזהרה, ואין בהן משום כרת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Ovadiah of Bartenura explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>עד כאן חמץ הראוי לאכילה ע\"י תערובת. מכאן ואילך חמץ נוקשה בעיניה: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Thus:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One must do away with the following items on Passover: [food items in which chametz is a non-dominant ingredient, such as] fermented dairy dip containing some grain, or date beer containing some barley ... [<strong>and non-food items that are technically edible though not tasty, such as] dye-workers' bran-water ... and bookmakers' glue.</strong> Rabbi Eliezer includes cosmetics. As a rule: things made with grain [if they're not <em>foods</em> that are <em>predominantly grain</em>] must go away on Passover, one is prohibited from eating them, but they don't get the full punishment of <em>Karet.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi and Tosfos debate whether you must throw these out, or simply put them away and not use them on Passover; but you certainly couldn't use them or make them.

The plain meaning of the verse leans this way, But Jonathan ben Uziel was not a strict translator. See for example earlier in verse 3 where he introduces the eagle/vulture simile when it doesn't occur in verse until verse 4.</p>\n<p><strong>What does ברוֹמא mean?</strong> I first read it plainly as in Rome, but then I encountered <a href=\"http://www.tyndalearchive.com/tabs/jastrow/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jastrow</a>, who brings down two options: in haughtiness or in Rome. Both seem to fit, if I'm not mistaken.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The word ברומא in the Targum to this pasuk means 'on high'.</p>\n\n<p>As you write, Jastrow gives a few possibilities of translating that Aramaic word רומא, in the general case. It could mean \"at a height\", \"haughty\", or \"Rome\".</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/OjEIa.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>The etymology for the first two comes from the root רום, in both Biblical Hebrew and in Aramaic. The etymology for the third is unrelated -- it is the name of the country, Roma.</p>\n\n<p>I wouldn't put much stock in the vocalization as shown in the link in the question, <strong>רוֹמא</strong>, because (a) that sort of vowel shift is easy for a copyist to change, and (b) 'haughty' and 'on high' are shades of meaning from the same root, so even if accurate, this would just be evidence of a roma meaning 'on high'. Assuming that this is the literal translation used consistently by Tg Yonatan, then moving to 'Roman' in one particular instance seems a stretch. Other places to look are מלכים ב פרק יט פסוק כ\"ב פסוק כ\"ג, ישעיהו פרק כב פסוק ט\"ז, and so on. It appears approx 46 times and really the Targum for each should be checked</p>\n\n<p>For a specific instance of the word רומא, we should consider the context. You have considered the context of this being sefer Ovadia, which is targeted at Esav / Edom and thus Rome. But you also intuited the context of זְדוֹן לִבְּךָ הִשִּׁיאֶךָ, \"the pride of thy heart hath beguiled thee\", which led you to the meaning of \"haughty\".</p>\n\n<p>However, the proper context to which to pay heed is the Biblical Hebrew word this is translating, מְרוֹם. The root of this is רום, meaning height. And so the Aramaic translation uses the exact same root, of רום. And so it means, just as in your English translation, \"his habitation on high\".</p>\n\n<p>Besides this immediate context, we should consider how Biblical Hebrew מרום is translated by Targum Yonatan throughout Tanach. For example, there is the word ממרום in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14258&st=&pgnum=423\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Shmuel 22:17</a>, where from context it cannot mean Rome:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/DPoRy.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p>\n\n<p>So, while this is indeed an interesting theory, I believe that a straightforward analysis results in the conclusion that the meaning is \"height\".</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kiddush Cup a Proper Wedding Gift for a Very Observant Couple?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My friend is very observant and will be getting married in May.</p>\n\n<p>I was thinking a Kiddush set would be an appropriate gift, but I want to make sure I'm in strict accordance with the laws (if any) of gift giving for the occasion.</p>\n\n<p>Should I avoid it? Will a member of the family most likely buy them a Kiddush set?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I received about a dozen Kiddush cups as wedding gifts. B\"H, I have used almost all of them for some reason!</p>\n\n<p>Offhand, I see no problem with giving a couple a Kiddush cup for their wedding, regardless of whether family members do likewise. (Interestingly, I don't recall any family member giving me a Kiddush cup.) IMO, you can't have too many Kiddush cups. Many people I know reserve certain cups for Yom Tov and additional ones for Pesach. (I've heard of some people that use a different cup for each of the 4 cups during the Seder!) If the wedding couple invites their own large family and / or many Shabbat guests, they will probably want every male guest to have his own cup. So, you can see that there are many occasions where even a dozen cups (not necessarily all from you ;-) still may not suffice!</p>\n\n<p>Most people use silver cups. They are the most valuable, increase in value over time (usually), are easy to clean, lightweight, durable and non-breakable (though, they can get dented if abused.) Some people like clay cups / sets, and many beautiful ones are available. You may want to find out if the couple has a preference. However, as stated. clay / pottery ones stain and chip far more easily than silver does.</p>\n\n<p>While I know that silver is expensive, I strongly advise against silver plate, though I know it's now cheap and \"trendy\". You pay a lot more money than it's value, and it has a tendency to stain and become dented because it's a bit brittle.</p>\n\n<p>Also beware that some of the plated as well as full silver ones, esp. the ones with stems tend to be \"weighted\" on the bottom with wax! Yes, wax! Often dealers don't tell you this, and make you think you are buying weightier silver, and you paid silver weight for wax. Go to a reputable dealer or know what you're buying!</p>\n\n<p>Another factor - Many people place a silver plate under their cup for Kiddush. Years ago, the plate was included in the price of the set. This is a rarity, now. While you do not <strong>need</strong> to buy a plate, this could be a factor in your total gift cost. My opinion if you're buying both - get a fancier cup and a less fancy plate if cost is a huge factor. You also, of course, don't have to buy both from the same place at the same time!</p>\n\n<p>I don't advise buying online, as it's hard to tell what you're getting. But, if you <strong>do</strong> search online, consider eBAY. I've bought some nice antique silver cups on eBAY and have been quite pleased. Just research well and ask the buyer plenty of questions until your satisfied, and do not buy anything on eBAY from a foreign country that is not bound by U.S. legal buying laws (such as China). VERY risky!</p>\n\n\n",

Enkin</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The first reason is related to the Mussaf liturgy. According to nusach sefard and sefardi, the Mussaf Kedusha opens with the words “keter yitnu lecha” (“We crown you, our Lord…”) referring to the teaching that the Jewish people, along with the angels, crown God as King of the world. It is explained that it would be unbecoming to make reference to God as the Supreme crowned being while one is wearing tefillin, which are considered to be a crown in their own right.</li>\n<li>The second reason is in order to add a Yom Tov flavor to the day. As Mussaf represents the Yom Tov nature of Rosh Chodesh the tefillin are removed at that time. In fact, some authorities recommend removing the tefillin before the Torah reading as it also represents the Yom Tov nature of the day. There are also those who recommend removing the tefillin before Hallel for the same reason. Some suggest removing the tefillin after the Torah is returned to the aron kodesh.

In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0610.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Joshua chapter 10</a> it lists a number of nations that they conquer and kill.

At the end of the Book of Genesis, you read how Joseph went from slave, to prisoner, to second in command in Egypt. There are several examples where the leaders were influenced by Hebrew slaves...Nebuchadnezzar is a great example.</p>\n\n<p>It is reasonable that a slave could influence his/her owner to follow their religion. it would be possible for slaves of the people of Canaan could influence the Hebrews to follow after false gods. The history of the books of Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles show a Jewish history of turning against God, to follow false gods, God's judgment, God showing grace by sending a deliver who turns the people back to Jehovah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Because keeping prisoners is very expensive resource wise. Also, this wasn't a war to steal loot or create a vassal, it was a war of supplantation- to come in and replace the cannanites. You can't keep them prisoner because they might regroup.</p>\n\n\n",

It is not addressed explicitly anywhere I looked and I assume it is because it is quite theoretical. Someone learning can wait to practice by day. But still interesting.</p>\n\n<p>As mentioned in the comments the mitsva of tfilin deoraita applies during both day and night. The reason Hazal forbid putting on tfilin at night is because one cannot sleep [or pass gas] wearing them (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.30.2?lang=en&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shulchan Aruch OC 30:2</a>). Even if these reasons do not apply to your case, we do not \"double guess\" Hazal when they forbid something even if their rationale doesn't apply.</p>\n\n<p>On the other side, the same siman of Shulchan Aruch says we can leave tfilin on if one wears them before the sun sets. <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Orach_Chayyim.30.3?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow\">The next one</a> says one can put them on before daybreak and touch them when the sun rises to say the bracha.</p>\n\n<p>Also when a minor needs to learn, there are certain barriers which are lifted, e.g., saying God's name, which is allowed to teach a minor.</p>\n\n<p>From all these I believe one can be lenient. But as always in these cases <a href=\"https://www.google.co.il/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjZzdDy3_TJAhVKaRQKHcXnAbgQFgggMAE&url=http%3A%2F%2Fjudaism.stackexchange.com%2Fquestions%2F10103%2Fhow-do-you-cylor-after-posting-on-judaism-stackexchange-com&usg=AFQjCNExjTe_PER4BALbn_htnQmZAeugVw&sig2=bpkN9YOwxEMG6YDB-2u1mQ\" rel=\"nofollow\">CYLOR</a>.</p>\n\n<p>PS. Note that <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2522\" rel=\"nofollow\">this source mentions kabalistic reasons from the Arizal</a> not to put tfilin on at night</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Shevet Hakehasi 6:15 writes that one may try on teffilin for practice if one is not having in mind to fulfill the mitzvah . He brings a proof from the gemara in Menachos that the only issue is that one may fall asleep with them. The teshuva is discussing a child who is practicing putting on teffilin at night.</p>\n<p>Text of teshuva:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3kbiI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/3kbiI.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Wear them in a way that does not comply with the mitzvah.

However, in practice, many cash transactions may begin rounding totals to the nearest nickel, and some businesses may no longer want to deal with pennies at all.</p>\n<p>This raises a question for me regarding tzedakah:</p>\n<p><strong>If someone gives charity using pennies — for example, four pennies (4¢) — does this still fully count as a valid act of tzedakah?</strong> Or does the fact that pennies are no longer being produced (and may be functionally phased out of daily transactions) affect their halachic or practical status as “real money”?</p>\n<p>More specifically:</p>\n<p>Since pennies are still recognized by the U.S. government as legal tender, does that alone mean they retain full monetary value for purposes of tzedakah?</p>\n<p>If, in everyday commerce, cash totals are rounded and pennies are rarely accepted, does that change whether such a donation is considered meaningful or valid?</p>\n<p>From a halachic perspective, is the defining factor the coin’s legal status, its market acceptability, its purchasing power, or the intent of the giver?</p>\n<p>Would giving multiple pennies together (e.g., 4¢, 10¢, etc.) be viewed differently than giving a single penny?</p>\n<p>Is there any precedent or discussion in halacha regarding currencies or coins that remain legal tender but are no longer produced or commonly used?</p>\n<p>I’m asking both from a practical standpoint and a halachic one, and I’d appreciate insight from anyone familiar with Jewish law, monetary policy, or communal charity practices.</p>\n\n\n",

Only the footnote on the first page is incomplete, and beginning with the parentheses (הערה זו...) is added by the editor. Footnotes in other volumes of the work are also written by the author (the preface mentions that this posthumous volume was not as revised as the other volumes in the series).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Doesn't look like it. Earlier in that very volume it says it was put out by Mossad HaRav Kook, which are known to add many scholarly footnotes to their works. There's an introduction by a Rav Y. L. Fishman and a preface by Dr. B. M. Levine, so perhaps they contributed to the footnotes. I didn't see any other indication who contributed.</p>\n<p>I found the same edition on <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/15078/p/1/t/9525969801234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar HaChochmah</a> but in a seemingly older format.

Here the term “<strong>chinuch</strong>” hasn’t yet been introduced:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>תוספתא שקלים ג:טז</strong> - כהן הדיוט אין נכנס לעזרה לעבודה אלא א\"כ הביא\nעשירית האיפה משלו ועובדה בידו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ספרא צו פרשה ג:ג</strong> - כשהכהן מתקרב תחלה\nלעבודה מביא עשירית האיפה משלו ועובדה בידו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ברייתא ירושלמי שקלים ז:ג</strong> -\n…..דְּרִבִּי יִשְׁמָעֵאל אָמַר. עִשָּׁרוֹן מְקַדֵּשׁ. כְּשֶׁהַכֹּהֵן\nמִתְקָּרֵב תְּחִילָּה לָעֲבוֹדָה מֵבִיא עֲשִׁירִית שֶׁלּוֹ וְעוֹבְדָהּ\nבְיָדוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see the term “<strong>חינוך</strong>” introduced into this process in the following גמרות:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ירושלמי שקלים ז:ג</strong> (<em>המשך</em>) - …..רִבִּי מָנָא בָעֵי מֵימַר. בּוֹ בַיּוֹם\nנִתְקָרֵב כַּתְּחִילָּה לָעֲבוֹדָה. בּוֹ בַיּוֹם נִתְמַנֶּה לִהְיוֹת\nכֹּהֵן גָּדוֹל. מֵבִיא שְׁתַּיִם. אַחַת <strong>לְחִינּוּכוֹ</strong> וְאָחַת לְחוֹבַת\nהַיּוֹם.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>גמ' מנחות עח.</strong> - אֶלָּא מַקִּישׁ חִינּוּכוֹ לְהִמָּשְׁחוֹ: מָה\nהִמָּשְׁחוֹ רְבוּכָה, אַף חִינּוּכוֹ רְבוּכָה. אָמַר רַב חִסְדָּא:\nכֹּהֵן גָּדוֹל הַמִּתְקָרֵב לַעֲבוֹדָה צָרִיךְ שְׁתֵּי עֶשְׂרוֹנוֹת\nהָאֵיפָה, אַחַת לְהִמָּשְׁחוֹ, וְאַחַת <strong>לְחִינּוּכוֹ</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>רש\"י (מנחות שם)</strong> - מקיש\nחינוכו - דכהן הדיוט להמשחו (היינו רבוכה) <strong>וחינוכו הוא המילואים שלו</strong> אלמא\nדבמילואים הוי רבוכה דכהן הדיוט מביא חביתין [היינו רבוכה] ביום <strong>חינוכו</strong>\nלעבודה וכהן גדול בכל יום: ואחד לחינוכו - בשביל <strong>שנתחנך היום</strong> לעבודת כהן\n[גדול]</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, the first time I have seen an appearance of the actual term “<strong>מנחת חינוך</strong>” is in the <strong>Mishna Torah of the Rambam</strong>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הלכות מעשה הקרבנות יב:ד</strong> - וְתֵשַׁע מִנְחוֹת הַיָּחִיד וְכֻלָּן\nקְרֵבִין לַמִּזְבֵּחַ וְאֵלּוּ הֵן. ……הַמִּנְחָה שֶׁמַּקְרִיב כָּל\nכֹּהֵן תְּחִלָּה כְּשֶׁיִּכָּנֵס לַעֲבוֹדָה שֶׁמַּקְרִיב אוֹתָהּ\nבְּיָדוֹ <strong>וְהִיא הַנִּקְרֵאת מִנְחַת חִנּוּךְ</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Is there anyone prior to the Rambam who had coined the term “מנחת חינוך”?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Dealing with guilt around anger at the divine",
    "content": "# Dealing with guilt around anger at the divine\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question has been bottled up for years but AI convinced me to ask if as it needs a human touch.</p>\n<p>My mother passed away a few years ago, sort of young and unexpected. People told me to \"grieve\" but one of the <strong>strongest</strong> feelings I had was anger at Gd.</p>\n<p>She got sick and was first neglected in a rehab center, and then transferred to the hospital during Holiday season (right around now). We all assumed she'd be fine but one day..she wasn't. It feels like the timing was bad (low staff) along with a few mistakes (tried wrong medication etc). It makes me feel like it wouldn't have taken a miracle for her to survive, just a gentle divine nudge.</p>\n<p>So I built up this <strong>anger</strong> about the situation, and at the same time I felt <strong>guilty</strong> for being angry, since people deal with much worse. I was also <strong>scared</strong> to be angry because \"how dare I\" be angry when so many other things go well for me. Stories like Tisha B'Av being retribution for the spies \"cries\" makes me nervous to \"unnecessarily\" be upset.</p>\n<p>I've never voiced or even wrote this down from fear of manifesting \"smite\" but honestly I think just want to repair the relationship.</p>\n<p>How do I move forward when I'm stuck between needing to express my feelings but being terrified of the consequences.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>While Mi Yodeya can't give you personalised advice, here's a story I once heard that is true, and has relevant wisdom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There was a holocaust survivor, a professor, and he was angry at God\nand abandoned Judaism. He was living in a community in Eretz Yisrael\nand there was a Rabbi there who was well known for being well versed\nin science and philosophy - a genius - and had a popular class on\nTorah.</p>\n<p>Many of his friends would regularly tell him to join the class because\nhe would enjoy it, but he refused. He didn't want to have anything to\ndo with Rabbis or Torah, or God. People also told the Rabbi about the\nprofessor, and at some point they actually met - I believe they ended\nup in an elevator (lift) together.</p>\n<p>The Rabbi asked the man to come to class, and the man refused, but\nthey got into a chat anyway and in the end, the professor actually\nsaid that he was impressed with what the Rabbi was teaching, and\nenjoyed it. As they were departing the Rabbi suggested that he join\nthe class, and the professor said no, he can't.</p>\n<p>The Rabbi asked why he can't, and he said \"you don't understand, you\nand me, we are not the same - we are completely different. I am angry\nat God because of the holocaust, I can never forgive Him. I am so\nangry in fact, that every Friday night, I deliberately make a meal of\npork, just to stick it to Him.\"</p>\n<p>The Rabbi said, \"not at all! We are exactly the same, we both keep\nShabbat!\".</p>\n<p>They departed and after a couple of weeks, the professor joined the\nclass. When his friends asked him why, he said, \"that Rabbi is very\nsmart. Very very smart. Listen to what he was saying. I thought that I\nwas too far 'gone' to have anything to do with Torah, Judaism or God.\nI was eating pork on Shabbat, in spite and anger. The exact opposite of what a Jew should\ndo, but when the Rabbi made the joke that we are actually the same,\nthere was a big truth in it. Why was I eating pork? Because I knew it\nangered God. And why was I doing it on Shabbat? Because I knew that\nShabbat is a special day to God. In a deep sense, I am a believer, son\nof believers, I believe in Shabbat, I believe in God, in fact, in my\nanger, I am in a very close relationship with Him. Therefore, I have\nno reason to not join this class\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Being angry at God is obviously not ideal (and I'm sure you've read some scary literature on this), but the truth is that some of the people who are angry at Him are in a more real relationship with Him than many believers. What does Hashem want? For us to be in a real relationship with Him, with Emunah.</p>\n<p>I can't speak to your situation and I of course recommend speaking to a Rabbi who can get to know you and your specific situation. But I'm sure if you read up on this very topic you'll find a lot of Rabbis have said very reassuring things. We are living in spiritually dark times, and Hashem is very patient and understanding. Above all, He's glad you're still thinking about Him, even if it's in anger. There are many Jews who have completely abandoned Him, and many \"religious\" Jews who are not as close to Him as you may be.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Try asking yourself -- is the anger/guilt cycle helping you, or holding you back?</p>\n<p>By all means acknowledge your feelings, but every so often we get someone here who says, \"I feel so guilty about XYZ that I'm not doing mitzvos!\" ... which is just making things worst. First focus on what you're actually doing every day.</p>\n<p>There's the famous story of the group of rabbis in the early days of the Holocaust that held God on trial ... and concluded He was guilty. And then they got up and davened Mincha.</p>\n<p>I heard one therapist comment -- \"we can't control our thoughts, but we can control our thinking.\" So okay. You're feeling angry at G-d. A lot of religious people can have that feeling. You can acknowledge it and then move on, instead of letting it consume you.</p>\n\n\n",

The goy who signed the agreement is an illegal immigrant employee of the business who hardly understands English, let alone Jewish law. Furthermore, the agreement states that the goy gets none of the profits unless the business make over $300,000 on an given Shabbos; an amount that couldn't ever possibly be close to being realized. It seems as if this owner is stretching an already questionable loophole to the point of breaking, just to make a few extra dollars. These Shabbos jobs barely make a dent in the overall profitability of the business. Lastly, the Rabbi/Rabbis he is using are based in London, even though the company is in New York with no ties whatsoever to the United Kingdom.

He gave the example of the Rambam’s medical treatises which, while containing a lot of good wisdom, contains quite a few statements that are verifiably false with today’s medicine. My Rabbi said that despite this, the Rambam <strong>could not</strong> be wrong, and that perhaps we don’t fully understand the Rambam’s statement or people were simply <em>different</em> back then. He later gave a second example of a colleague of his who disagreed with Ibn Ezra on an issue of dikduk and then stated that Ibn Ezra (and other rabbis) essentially couldn’t be wrong in most fields.</p>\n<p>My question is, is the opinion that rabbis are essentially infallible common in the orthodox world or is this merely a Chabad phenomenon. Given the fact that Rishonim and other early rabbis commonly disagreed with each other on hashkafa and other issues, is this “rabbinic infallibility” a recent phenomenon or does it have any real basis?</p>\n<p>If a rishon, for example, says that in the times of David Hamelech, everyone had 8 arms, could he be considered wrong?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This answer is based on my experience, take it as you will. First, this is not a Chabad-only position, but the general position of the Ultra-Orthodox (\"Chareidim\" etc.). Nonetheless, there is nuance to it:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Some hold that they are sometimes fallible, especially in matters that do not directly pertain to Torah*. This will much more likely be an opinion of a more Modern-Orthodox Jew, especially one in the academic/rationalist direction. Even many Ultra-Orthodox will admit this to some degree, given that there are Gemaras that do suggest this themselves, so generally everyone holds they are ultimately human, and thus not perfect like Hashem. <em>How much</em> they think they are fallible is a spectrum.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some prefer to say it like this: they are indeed human and thus not perfect like Hashem, but nonetheless, we are not on the level to see their fallibility, in the same way a 7 year old who just learned the rules of chess has no way of perceiving any flaw in Magnus Carlsen's chess game (<em>l'havdil</em>). They are so much above us in spiritual and intellectual level, that for all practical purposes, they are perfect to us. If they say something we don't understand, or is seemingly proven wrong, we must find a way to defend them.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There are some that reduce their fallibility to the limit of zero i.e. they are indeed infallible, second only in place to God. This is because they are born with special souls from lofty realms, are indeed speaking with <em>ru'ach hakodesh</em> or minor prophecy, and their teachings are guided by the Hand of Providence. It's important that we do not <em>at all</em> entertain the notion that they are fallible, <em>chas veshalom</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There is wisdom to all 3 approaches and many fine Jews hold by each. The main thing that all Orthodox agree is that we should have a prodigious amount of respect for them, and certainly a huge dose of humility if we ever wish to take on the task of describing them as being wrong about anything.</p>\n<p>This is part of \"Emunat Chachamim\" - faith in our Sages (Pirkei Avot 6:7), and is a very <em>Jewish</em> way of thinking. We don't worship saints, we venerate Sages. We give our respect and trust to our great Torah giants, who have proven themselves worthy of it. It has rarely let us down, and indeed, been one of the pillars of our success as a people, and as transmitters and teachers of the Torah from Sinai to this very day.</p>\n<p><sup>* The Lubavitcher Rebbe, I believe, wrote a letter answering how we should deal with the fact that science facts, written by some Rabbis in their Torah teachings, have been proven wrong in modern times. He answers that they were using the science of their time as a \"vessel\" or \"garment\" to explain the Torah idea. The fact is, the garment may have changed, but the truth behind the Torah idea is eternal. I've never had any trouble applying this principle</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How many Mishna-Gemara segments appear in the Babylonian Talmud?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the Babylonian Talmud, each chapter contains a Mishna and Gemara unit. The  breakdown and usage of the Mishnayot, as compared to the original corpus, is frequently different. The roughly 4,192 Mishnayot in the original corpus of the six orders of the Mishna are not all used in the Babylonian Talmud. However, how many Mishnah-Gemara sections are there in in the Babylonian Talmud. The figure must be far less the 4000, for two of the six orders of the Mishna were basically excluded from the corpus of the Babylonian Talmud. But it may be considerably less than the strict figure of: 2,582</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moed: 418\nNashim: 521\nNezikin: 613\nKodashim: 1,030</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>simply due to the fact that the Mishnayot were restructured, as mentioned above.</p>\n<p>I am similarly inquiring into the median word count, as well as a readout of the longest to shortest Mishna-Gemara segments.</p>\n\n\n",

There’s seemingly no way to get them out (apart from ripping the jacket open). May one wear this jacket on Shabbat since the coins/muktzeh are pretty much useless and you don’t care about them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>I'm not a posek please ask your LOR</strong></p>\n<p>If you ask someone who knows how to sew, they will likely be easily able to open up the coat and take the coins out (not on Shabbat, obviously).</p>\n<p><strong>If its right before Shabbat and one needs the coat:</strong></p>\n<p>The Piskei Teshuvot O.C Siman 310:13 explains that if one left the coins or any other muktzeh in their pocket (i.e a jacket) with intent that they will stay there on Shabbat such as this case, then the Mishneh Berurah there Seif Katan 30 and 31 and Magen Avraham there say that if its a pocket sewn by its edges, where the garment is NOT a wall, the pocket is a complete pouch with its own front and back and is then sewn onto or into the garment only to attach it (like a coat), the coat would not be מקוצה because the pocket is בטל to the coat, and in footnote 87 he says that one can do so even lechtachilah as long as one's intention is not for the purpose of the coins.</p>\n<p>However, this is all with regards to muktzeh, however, I think even if it's בטל (and there might be a case to argue the other way), we still hold by the Rema O.C 310:7 that one should not use the jacket because one might go outside the eiruv and forget about the coins.</p>\n<p>However, because this is a unique case in which the coins are in the coat itself and not in the pockets (somehow), then I would say a kal vechomer that in terms of mukteh it's batel to the jacket but would still be assur to walk out of the house with it.</p>\n\n\n",

Since Joshua was dead, if Israel would fight and be defeated by the enemies, everyone would say that their shade/protection (of God) has departed from them. They (the enemy) would grow strong to fight against Israel, which would not be (the case), if they would see that also after the death of Joshua, Israel defeated them (the enemy) and performed great deeds as days of old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>לכן היתה התשובה יהודה יעלה, ר״ל שבחר ה׳ שילחם יהודה בראשונה וזה להפחיד בגבורותיו הגוים כלם\nTherefore the answer (from God) is that 'Judah should go up (first)', meaning that God chose that Judah should fight battles first in order to scare the nations, all of them, through his mighty deeds.</p>\n<p><em>Ok. But if they were wise enough on their own to know that there should be an initial one-on-one battle (instead of all of the tribes fighting simultaneously), then why not also know without asking God that Yehuda was the most suitable choice (due to his might and regal nature - which is obvious and discussed at length in the Torah) for starting things?!</em></p>\n<p><em>ממה נפשך-  pose both questions to God (simultaneous v an initial one-on-one, and if the latter,  who goes first?) or ask neither!\nIn fact the question of whether to wage all out war or an initial one-on-one battle, strikes me as a meta-question and thus the more appropriate question to be submitted to God.</em></p>\n\n\n",

We also pasken like this Behag in Shulchan Aruch OC 679:1. This even applies to Sefardim, who don't generally hold like this Behag for Shabbat candles. As to why Sephardim (Mechaber) light Chanukah candles first and then Shabbat candles, see Chazon Ovadia Chanukah page 176, which in summary gives an approach that even though we should apply tadir (the more frequent mitzvah comes first) but persumei nisa of lighting Chanukah candles comes before tadir, therefore lighting Chanukah candles comes first.</li>\n<li>Ben Ish Chai Parashat Vayeshev 1:20 and Kaf Hachaim O.C Siman 678:2, quoting the Sha'ar Hakavanot 109a gives a kabbalistic reason for this- see there.</li>\n<li>Kaf Hachaim O.C 679 says that it's because of מעלין בקודש (going up in holiness), so therefore Chanukah goes first and then Shabbat (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/154522/chanukah-candles-or-shabbos-candles-first-on-friday/154537#154537\">here</a> why this might be).</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mikar hadin you're right ideally one should light shabbos candles before Chanuka.

Or do those  who hold this opinion simply reject the academic theory?</p>\n<p>My immediate theory to reconcile the two would be that Hashem created the world using Lashon Haqodesh, however either after the tower of Bavel (or maybe earlier?), Hashem dispersed the languages of the world, and in a sort of “guided evolution”, had Lashon Haqodesh evolve from Proto-Semitic.

In high school, I remember I had to write diary entries from the point of view of a Christian woman in the French Revolution, and I had to refer to Greek G-ds when reading various Greek plays.</p>\n<p>I never knew how to approach it. I write G-d or Hashem usually, but doing this with the G-ds of other religions seems to imply that the G-d they believe in should be revered enough that I could not spell out the word \"G-d\" when referring to them. I do not believe this, and when I did this in high school it always felt like a was breaking the rule to \"distance yourself from idol worship\" seen here in Pirkei Avos 1:7</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נִתַּאי הָאַרְבֵּלִי אוֹמֵר, הַרְחֵק מִשָּׁכֵן רָע, וְאַל תִּתְחַבֵּר\nלָרָשָׁע, וְאַל תִּתְיָאֵשׁ מִן הַפֻּרְעָנוּת:   Nittai the Arbelite\nused to say: keep a distance from an evil neighbor, do not become\nattached to the wicked, and do not abandon faith in [divine]\nretribution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have also just written the word G-d with an o in the middle, uncapitalized to show my non-belief in the other religions G-d, but even then, it seemed to me that this could be interpreted as suspending my belief in Hashem for a moment to speak of other G-ds. (Sorry if that is unclear, it's hard to explain; honestly it just felt sketchy.)</p>\n<p>So, what should I do when referring to other G-ds?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Torah describes idols as \"elohim acheirim\", i.e. \"other powers\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא־יִהְיֶ͏ה־לְךָ אֱלֹהִים אֲחֵרִים עַל־פָּנָ͏ַי׃</p>\n<p>Thou shalt have no other gods beside me. [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.3?lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 20:3</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you click on the link I provided above, it will show you the 11 different professional English translations available on Sefaria for translating the Torah. All but one translate the word \"אֱלֹהִים\" as \"god\". Note, even in Hebrew, the word used is the same word used for Hashem when being referred to as G-d (such as in the first pasuk of the Torah), and this is in quite a famous pasuk, being the Second Commandment!</p>\n<p>This, indeed, is completely standard and accepted. Therefore, you are more than welcome to write \"god\" without worrying that you are suspending belief in Hashem or giving that impression. If you still don't like it, you could try what the 11th translation did, and use \"deity\". You may feel that that has the same problem, but as I've proven, even the Torah is happy to use the same word for both G-d Himself, and false gods. Don't over think it!</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, be careful when it comes to Christianity and Islam. They are Abrahamic religions that ostensibly believe in the same God of Abraham as us, and therefore you might wish to write G-d in that context. Obviously, not for Jesus, but if they are more generally discussing G-d (which indeed, other religions might also do). Ask your local orthodox Rabbi.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that it's not universally accepted that one must insert the hyphen in the word \"G-d\".

    "title": "Does the discomfort of a fast matter in relation to the spiritual benefit?",
    "content": "# Does the discomfort of a fast matter in relation to the spiritual benefit?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Odd question but I was curious where the Rabbis fall on this.</p>\n<p>Fasting is a common practice in Judaism. There's a spiritual benefit associated with it. My question is how the \"value\" of a fast is determined and if the value changes depending on the struggle of the fast.</p>\n<p><strong>For example.</strong> I have a friend who suffers from ADHD. He takes a medication which makes eating for him almost impossible. In such a context, if a person took a medication which suppressed hunger, how would that impact the fast's benefit to one's soul or spiritual development?</p>\n<p>My thoughts break down to the following possibilities:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No matter what the fast is valid so don't worry about the fact it may come easier due to a necessary medication.</li>\n<li>The discomfort associated with fasting has benefit because you're suffering for God. The willingness to take on discomfort and deny yourself as a sign of love adds a second layer to the fast besides the act itself.</li>\n<li>Being able to condition yourself to discomfort is a positive character trait one should develop in general. So hiding from discomfort ultimately hides you from the benefits and growth of that discomfort.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I was curious if there were any sources discussing this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Great question!</strong></p>\n<p>Within the example you gave, although your friend doesn't feel the hunger, the fast is only a preparation for teshuvah, as the Rambam says in Hilchot Taanit 5:1 (also mentioned by Mishneh Berurah O.C 549:1).</p>\n<p><strong>Two Major components of the fast:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> The Gemera in Brachot 6b says that the reward for a fast day is from the tzedaka that one gives. The Meil Tzedaka 435 writes in the name of Rabbi Yehuda Hachassid that תענית (fast day) and תת עני (give to the poor) have the same letters because the fast is only complete if you give tzedaka.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> Another major thing that we do on fast days, which is very important, is Teshuvah as mentioned above. The Gemera in Taanit 15a says that it does not state with regard to the people of Nineveh: And God saw their sackcloth and their fasting. Rather, the verse says: “And G-d saw their deeds, that they had turned from their evil way” (Jonah 3:10). And in the Prophets it says: “And rend your hearts and not your garments, and return to the Lord your God” (Joel 2:13). This teaches that prayer and fasting are insufficient, as one must do teshuvah. The Rambam Taanit 5:1 and the Mishneh Berurah O.C Siman 529:1 say that fasting brings to teshuvah, which is a major aspect. The Mishneh Berurah adds that he doesn't understand people who waste their fast day strolling around and wasting time; he says they are doing the טפל and disregarding the עיקר.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if one gives tzedakah and has done teshuvah and doesn't feel any hunger or thirst, one has definitely impacted one's spiritual development for the good and will get rewarded immensely, as the fast is only a way that leads to teshuvah, but if one can to it without feeling the hunger like in this case than one has accomplished the goal of the fast.</p>\n<p>(Of course, mederabbanan, those who are physically capable of fasting must fast, but I am only discussing this specific case, which can be applied to other similar types people who might be exempt from fasting because of any physical incapability and yet are still able to achieve the goal of the fast if they give tzedaka and do teshuvah- assuming they are also capable of doing that).</p>\n\n\n",

Because if you look up the gemara it says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״וַתִּתְפְּשֵׂהוּ בְּבִגְדוֹ לֵאמֹר וְגוֹ׳״, בְּאוֹתָהּ שָׁעָה בָּאתָה\nדְּיוֹקְנוֹ שֶׁל אָבִיו וְנִרְאֲתָה לוֹ בַּחַלּוֹן, אָמַר לוֹ יוֹסֵף!\nעֲתִידִין אַחֶיךָ שֶׁיִּכָּתְבוּ עַל אַבְנֵי אֵפוֹד וְאַתָּה\nבֵּינֵיהֶם, רְצוֹנְךָ שֶׁיִּמָּחֶה שִׁמְךָ מִבֵּינֵיהֶם, וְתִקָּרֵא\nרוֹעֶה זוֹנוֹת? דִּכְתִיב: ״וְרֹעֶה זוֹנוֹת יְאַבֶּד הוֹן״.</p>\n<p><em>The verse states: <strong>“And she caught him by his garment, saying:</strong> Lie with\nme” (Genesis 39:12). <strong>At that moment his father’s image [deyokeno] came\nand appeared to him in the window.</strong> The image <strong>said to him: Joseph,</strong> the\nnames of <strong>your brothers are destined to be written on the stones of the\nephod, and you</strong> are to be included <strong>among them. Do you desire your name\nto be erased from among them, and to be called an associate [ro’eh] of\npromiscuous women? As it is written: “But he who keeps company with\nharlots wastes his riches”</strong> (Proverbs 29:3), as he loses his honor,\nwhich is more valuable than wealth.</em> [Steinsaltz annotated translation and commentary]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question, therefore, is what was so special about Yosef passing this test? He had this incredible vision of his father clearly explaining to him the massive consequences of his action and the terrible ramifications. We all know that we are only able to commit aveiros because we are temporarily taken over by a \"Ruach Shtus\" - \"a spirit of folly\" (\"רֵישׁ לָקִישׁ אָמַר: אֵין אָדָם עוֹבֵר עֲבֵירָה אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן נִכְנַס בּוֹ רוּחַ שְׁטוּת\" - Sotah 3a). Surely Yaakov's stern warning to Yosef would totally obliterate this Ruach Shtus! Can't we all say that if we had such clear visions challenging our own Ruach Shtus then we too wouldn't sin? Why is Yosef’s restraint so special?</p>\n<p><strong>I have a number of answers that I have come up with myself, but I am looking for answers with a source, preferably from Rishonim or pre-war Achronim.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have found a source that deals directly with my question!</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://www.dirshu.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Purity-in-Sight-011.pdf?srsltid=AfmBOoqLt9Az1m7affypDNLwpkPHs1UKmAOCJ5GVKSM7L-HCcXsFyIHh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this publication</a> which in Paragraph 8 on Page 4 says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The peirush Yefei To’ar on the Midrash explains at length that it\ncannot be that Yaakov actually appeared to Yosef at that point,\nbecause if he had, it would be no challenge for Yosef to overcome his\nyetzer hara.

When faced with the nisayon, he started contemplating who he\nis, and where he comes from. He started thinking about his heilige\ntatte Yaakov, and remembered the hashra’as haShechinah he had\nexperienced in his father’s home. The avnei haChoshen represent this\nidea, that Hashem rests His Shechinah on the Shevatim. As Yosef\nthought about it, he realized that if he falls, he will be removed\nfrom the company of the Shevatim; he will no longer be able to host\nthe Shechinah.

There is a strong case this was a tremendous miraculous Hizuq from G-d that saved Joseph from sinning and kept him on the path of righteousness, The sages of the Talmud even say it was because of this event that Joseph is not called the father of the 12 tribes of Israel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.36b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 36b</a>). At the least, I think this is evidence that he did not do everything perfectly. It presents a case for אִם עוֹשִׂין לוֹ נֵס- מְנַכִּין לוֹ מִזְּכֻיוֹתָיו (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.32a.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbath 32A</a>) - A person who placed themself in a dangerous situation and then was saved, he has his merits reduced.  Afterall, It is a recorded opinion (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.36b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 36b</a>, also see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Vayeshev.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanhuma</a>) that Joseph intentionally secluded himself with Esheth Potiphar to \"do his needs\" and only after that, he was saved via miracle that helped him snap back to reality. See Ohr HaHaim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.1.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> as well.</p>\n<p>The text (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.36b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 36b.15</a>) says he merited to have his name on the ephod and be called a Ro'eh Israel because of the 'Aveer Yaakov אֲבִיר יַעֲקֹב, Otherwise he would have been eschewed from the ephod and considered as a Ro'eh of harlots if not for the miraculous intervention (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.36b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">36.13</a>). Essentially God gave Joseph a vision saying \"If you do this crime, you will be defamed and called a Ro'eh of harlots.\" and Joseph chose not to do it, and as a result he is called instead a Ro'eh Israel (but not an Avi Israel as he would have been called). Instead of him having 12 sons, he had 2 and his brother's 10 were named for him... significant demotion (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.36b.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibid</a>). He comes out considered righteous (but not without <em>any</em> blame) because of the intervention. Still, when he had the matter laid out for him miraculously from God, not unlike <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.11?ven=english%7CThe_Five_Books_of_Moses,_by_Everett_Fox._New_York,_Schocken_Books,_1995&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshath Re'eh</a> רְאֵ֗ה אָנֹכִ֛י נֹתֵ֥ן לִפְנֵיכֶ֖ם הַיּ֑וֹם בְּרָכָ֖ה וּקְלָלָֽה, he could chose a blessing or a curse, he chose the blessing, which is certainly a righteous choice and that is why he is called a Ro'eh Israel and a Tzadiq. I don't think I would characterize that choice as special or great but Betzadeq. There are men who would have made the other choice, like Esau essentially made the other choice, intentionally choosing not to be considered an Avi Israel and to instead live a life of edom. When laid out for him, Yoseph realized he wanted to be on the right side of history. He did need divine intervention, he certainly could have performed better, but he is still righteous based off his conduct here.</p>\n<p>B'H</p>\n\n\n",

This is explained in Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, siman 13, that one is permitted to take his fellow’s tallit without his knowledge and recite a blessing over it, even though a borrowed tallit is exempt—even rabbinically—and nevertheless one may recite a blessing over it, similar to women who recite blessings over positive time-bound commandments even though they are never obligated in them. All the more so in the case of a man, who is obligated in them at certain times. Likewise, we find in many places that although one who is exempt from a matter and nevertheless performs it is called a hedyot (an ordinary person), he does not transgress bal tosif, since the act itself is inherently a mitzvah. And so it is stated in Rambam, Hilchot Melachim, that a gentile who innovates a new religion beyond his seven commandments is liable to death, but if he performs one of the commandments of the holy Torah in order to receive reward, he is permitted to do so.

However, having looked over the first few books of Nevi'im Rishonim, it's not clear to me where the Tannaim learned this idea from. P'shat Tanach appears to contradict such a notion. Here is a list of places where worship sites (bamot, altars, houses of worship) were built in the Shiloh period (assuming this period began with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.18.1?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 18:1</a> and ended with the destruction of the Mishkan at Shiloh in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.4.12-22?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:4:12-22</a>, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.7.12?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yirmiyahu 7:12</a> with <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.7.12?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Jeremiah.7.12.3&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudat David</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jeremiah.7.12?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&p2=Radak_on_Jeremiah.7.12.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a>), with the context implying that these were thought to be legitimate worship sites:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shechem - Mikdash Hashem (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.24.26?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 24:26</a>)</li>\n<li>Bochim - altar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.2.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 2:5</a>)</li>\n<li>Ofrah of the Aviezerites - spontaneous altar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.6.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 6:21</a>) turned into permanent altar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.6.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:24</a>); second permanent altar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.6.25-28?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">6:25-28</a>)</li>\n<li>Tzor'ah - spontaneous altar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.13.19-20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 13:19-20</a>)</li>\n<li>*Har Efraim - Beit Elohim (specifically Garev according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.103b.15?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 103b</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.17.3-5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 17:3-5</a>)<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>*Dan - cultic center (not entirely specified; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.18.30-31?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 18:30-31</a>)<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Beit Lechem - Beit Hashem (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.19.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 19:18</a>; debatable)<sup>2</sup></li>\n<li>Beit El - a large altar, the location of the ark (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.20.26-27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 20:26-27</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.21.2-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">21:2-4</a> according to p'shat)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Chazal state in various places (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.90b.5?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 90b</a>) that Eliyahu's altar on Har Ha'Carmel was an extraordinary case of a Hora'at Sha'ah (a temporary ruling), which is what allowed him to build and use an altar outside of the Mikdash at Yerushalayim. However, it's difficult to imagine that all of these cases would have likewise been Hora'at Sha'ah. Constantly using the \"excuse\" of Hora'at Sha'ah effectively makes the leniency null. Moreover, some of these cases appear to have been intended for long-term use (e.g. Shechem, Ofrah, Beit Lechem, Beit El, Dan [albeit framed in the story as an illegitimate site]),<sup>3</sup> while Hora'at Sha'ah is intended for short-term use.</p>\n<p>In short, what exactly is the case to be made that there indeed was a prohibition of bamot during the Shiloh period? And if indeed there was a prohibition, how are all of these other cases to be understood?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup><sup>1</sup> While idolatrous with the usage of some kind of idol, the context of the story clearly indicates that Michah, his mother, his son (the first priest) the Levite (the second priest) and the Danites believed that this cultic construction was a legitimate form of worshiping Hashem.</sup></p>\n<p><sup><sup>2</sup> The various commentators on Sefaria argue that the Levite was trying to reach Beit Hashem at Shiloh. This is also argued by Da'at Mikra. However, this is somewhat problematic in p'shat terms. The verse states:  \"עֹבְרִים אֲנַחְנוּ מִבֵּית־לֶחֶם יְהוּדָה עַד־יַרְכְּתֵי הַר־אֶפְרַיִם מִשָּׁם אָנֹכִי וָאֵלֵךְ עַד־בֵּית לֶחֶם יְהוּדָה וְאֶת־בֵּית ה' אֲנִי הֹלֵךְ\" - Roughly translated: \"We are going from Beit Lechem of Yehudah towards the base of Har Efraim where I am from (=I am from Har Efraim), and I went until Beit Lechem Yehudah, and to the House of Hashem I am going.\" The Levite seems to be skirting around the real reason he came to Beit Lechem, which was to seek out his concubine, who had fled there (see Da'at Mikra on Shoftim 19:18). If his final destination was Shiloh, he did not succeed in explaining away why he went to Beit Lechem in the first place. It would seem, therefore, that there was a Beit Hashem in Beit Lechem, which was his made-up excuse for going there. An altar of sorts at Beit Lechem is also indicated by verses from the post-Shiloh era, which nonetheless may hint at an established, well-known worship site (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.16.1-5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:16:1-5</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.20.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:20:6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.20.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">29</a>).</sup></p>\n<p><sup><sup>3</sup> There are also multiple cases of what appear to have been pre-Monarchic Israelite cultic sites identified in various archeological sites. The most famous is the altar at Har Eval, but there are also the so-called \"footprint\" sites (also known as \"Gilgalim\") around Har Menashe (see e.g. <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%9C_(%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8_%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99)#%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%A7%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Whether these were officially legitimate or only supposed to be such from a colloquial perspective (as in the case of Michah's idol and house of worship) is unknown.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The assumption that a temple contains an altar, and that an altar is built for sacrifices, is a reasonable assumption in general, but isn't true in the particular case of the time that the bamot were prohibited, as we find explicitly regarding the altar built on the Jordan, which was from the outset not intended for offering sacrifices, since doing so would have been prohibited (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%9B%D7%91_%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 22:10</a>). The same may be the case regarding any other altar, and so the question only arises when we find explicitly that sacrifices were offered.</p>\n<p>So we can safely ignore every cultic center where no sacrifice is explicitly said to be offered. This is sufficient to explain Shechem (this location is based on an explicit commandment of the Torah, Devarim 27:5), Beit Lechem (according to your conjecture), Har Efraim and Dan as well (although, as you noted, these two weren't considered legitimate, though the reason for that is apparently the idol).</p>\n<p>Next, as you note, the prohibition can be overridden by a prophet, and this seems to be the case in Bochim, Ofrah, and Tzorah, since each sacrifice was said to be commanded by God or an angel or prophet. As above, the altar may well be permanent, without any transgression, as long as the sacrifice on it is a one-time event directed by a prophet.</p>\n<p>Beit El is a difficult one to explain, since there was an actual offering of sacrifices, while no prophet is mentioned as approving it, nor is there any criticism of it. (1) Radak understands Beit El generically like the generic name בית ה' (possibly called that due to the geographical proximity of Shilo to Beit El), and accordingly the ark would have remained there the whole time.</p>\n<p>(2) Alternatively, if the ark was taken out for war, even temporarily, the bamot would be permitted, even during the period of Shilo. This is stated explicitly in Yerushalmi <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40739&st=&pgnum=487\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilla 1:12</a>, quoted by the Meshech Chochma <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14061&st=&pgnum=339\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ד\"ה לא תעשון</a>, which I looked at from a suggestion by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/42703/m-g\">M G</a>). In fact, the Meshech Chochma also uses this insight to answer the case of Bochim as well as Beit El. The reason why bamot were forbidden in the Shilo period is because the ark wasn't moving from place to place, but when it was being transported the prohibition of bamot ceased.</p>\n<p>(3) To address the other side, if bamot <em>weren't</em> permitted during that time period (contra the Meshech Chochma; the Yerushalmi is inconclusive, and may be either a statement or an unanswered question), it seems to me that it would be unthinkable to have the sacrificial service go on as normal in Shilo with the most important vessel missing, facing the ordinary altar rather than the ark. The one place to which sacrifice would have been restricted would presumably be to the location of the ark, in or out of Shilo.</p>\n\n\n",

Many other authorities though questioned if there was any good basis for that requirement (see Beit Yosef YD 286), and thus the common practice is to attach a mezuza but, out of doubt since it may not really be necessary, omit the blessing said upon affixing it (cf. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%94_%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%95_%D7%98%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shakh ibid :15</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

And as a result of this distance, even those who try to do good are not met by G-d’s favour. The nation has become tamei (spiritually impure), both by distancing itself from holiness and by influencing one another negatively, with no one left to purify or guide them back to repentance.</p>\n<p>Their good deeds have become superficial, like clothing worn only for show rather than garments that become part of one’s essence. They are like withered leaves rather than fruit-bearing trees, lacking substantial righteousness and true inner faith. Therefore, their sins easily sweep them away, just as a strong wind carries off a dry leaf, since they no longer have deep spiritual roots to hold them firm.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.64.5?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Isaiah.64.5.1-4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a> says like Rashi that the righteous have departed and thus there is no one there to spiritually defend them. All the good deeds are like worn-out garments as because they do not come from a wholehearted place but rather only from the pursuit of self-glorification. Thus their strength is faded like a withered leaf and their sins serve to accuse and bring punishment on them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.64.5?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_Isaiah.64.5.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> writes that as an exiled nation we resemble something impure and disgusting. He notes that the word \"עדים\" - \"garment\" can be understood in a few ways - 1) As per the Targum, a blemished, stained garment. 2) From the Aramaic meaning of childbirth, referring to clothing dirtied with blood. 3) Or simply an old, worn-out rag. Either way, all interpretations point to a piece of clothing that is filthy and rejected. Like the Metzudos Dovid and Malbim he explains that their good deeds aren't pleasing to G-d because they are done for show, self-glorification, or out of jealousy of others, not from any sincere intent. Like a dried up leaf, the Jewish people have withered spiritually and just like  the wind blows away a fallen leaf, their sins scatter them to all corners of the earth and cause their exile.</p>\n\n\n",

It seems like a \"rule of nature\".</p>\n<p>Very much related is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zipf's Law</a>, which said simply is when you have a large set, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/76751/does-the-word-distribution-in-the-torah-follow-zipfs-law?r=SearchResults&s=1%7C29.4659\">e.g. the words in the Torah</a>, the number of occurrences of each item in the set will be inversely proportional to its rank-by-occurence. The 5th ranked and fifth most popular word in Torah will make up one-fifth as many of the total words in the Torah as the 1st ranked and most popular word (if the Torah holds by Zipf's Law, which we can't find out because the question was closed. Many languages do hold by it and so many other similar systems, from city sizes to whale phonemes).</p>\n<p>The main point is that these two issues are quite mysterious, due to how prevalent they are.</p>\n<p>Given that these are quite important to the way the world works, and Torah is the world's blueprint, I was wondering if there is any Torah source that in any way discusses these issues in any way whatsoever.</p>\n<p>E.g. Does the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle#Gini_coefficient_and_Hoover_index\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gini coefficient</a> (0.8:0.2) appear in Torah? Do <em>mefarshim</em> explain it? Its root? Do any halachos or gemaras utilise the 80/20 rule or the facts of Zipf's Law in any way? Do any Midrashim or Kabbalistic sources bring it up and try to explain them mathematically or metaphysically?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does God really provide for all our desires?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Psalm 145:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פּוֹתֵ֥חַ אֶת־יָדֶ֑ךָ וּמַשְׂבִּ֖יעַ לְכׇל־חַ֣י רָצֽוֹן׃\n<br />\nYou open your hand and satiate the desire of every creature.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can we say that God provides everyone’s desires? People starve to death in the world, and everyone wants what they don’t have.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It appears that the OP's question is a result of a confusion resulted from using the english word <em>desire</em> for different Hebrew words. Indeed the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.145.16?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 145:16</a> is translated in the Hebrew-English Artscroll Siddur as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פּוֹתֵ֥חַ אֶת־יָדֶ֑ךָ וּמַשְׂבִּ֖יעַ לְכׇל־חַ֣י <strong>רָצֽוֹן</strong>׃</p>\n<p>You open your hand and satisfy every living thing [with its] <strong>desire</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, the words of midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kohelet_Rabbah.1.13.1?ven=english%7CThe_Sefaria_Midrash_Rabbah,_2022&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabba 1:13:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יוּדָן בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי אַיְּבוּ אֵין אָדָם יוֹצֵא מִן הָעוֹלָם וַחֲצִי <strong>תַּאֲוָתוֹ</strong> בְּיָדוֹ, אֶלָּא אִן אִית לֵיהּ מְאָה בָּעֵי לְמֶעֱבַד יַתְהוֹן תַּרְתֵּין מָאוָון, וְאִן אִית לֵיהּ תַּרְתֵּי מָאוָון בָּעֵי לְמֶעֱבַד יַתְהוֹן אַרְבָּעָה מְאָה.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yudan said in the name of Rabbi Aivu: A person does not leave the world having achieved even half of his <strong>desire</strong>; rather, if he has one hundred he wishes to turn them into two hundred. If he has two hundred, he wishes to turn them into four hundred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the first case, if we speak about people, the Hebrew word רָצֽוֹן refers to purely spiritual or intellectual desire devoid of any physicality, such as desire of good deeds, as one can see based on Malbim below. Indeed G-d provides many avenues for one to realize his/her <em>ratzon</em>. If we speak about all creatures, we could use <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.145.16?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>and satisfy every living thing [with] its desire</strong> With a sufficiency to sustain him, He satisfies his goodness, his will, and his blessing. <strong>desire</strong> Heb. רצון, <em>apayement / apeiement</em> in Old French, propitiation, making it appeased.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the second case, the word תַּאֲוָה refers to purely materialistic desire. The material world is lacking indeed.</p>\n<p>Malbim in the <em>Sefer Yair Or</em> usually printed in the back of <em>Sefer haCarmel</em> provides further distinctions between different words in Hebrew, which express <em>desire</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חֶמְדָה - expresses desire for things that one saw with his eyes and it appeared good to him/her. Example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nahum.2.11?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nachum 2:11</a> - \"“Plunder silver! Plunder gold!” There is no limit to the treasure; It is a hoard of all precious (i.e. desirable) objects.\"</p>\n<p>תַּאֲוָה (אַוֶה) - expresses the desire also for things that one has never seen,  rather due to strengthening of the power of imagination in shaping the form or making comparison, one begins to desire it, even if it is bad.</p>\n<p>Both חֶמְדָה and תַּאֲוָה are similar, as they do not originate from intellectual contemplation.</p>\n<p>אָבָה - it is not distinguishable from either חֶמְדָה or תַּאֲוָה, rather it refers to inclination of acceptance or support of one's heart to the words of a friend, who requests for a favor. Example: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.10.27?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 10:27</a>: \"But Hashem stiffened Pharaoh’s heart and he would not agree (or desire - אָבָ֖ה) to let them go.\"</p>\n<p>חֵפֶץ - it indicates a type of desire of one's nature or character (<em>nefesh</em>) for something or to play with it. Example: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.42.22?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 42:22</a>: \"GOD  desires (חָפֵ֖ץ) for the sake of (his servant's) righteousness, that he may magnify and glorify the Torah.\"</p>\n<p>רָצֽוֹן indicates only type of desire that stems from intellectual contemplation, even if one's soul (<em>nefesh</em>) has no desire (חֵפֶץ) for it. One expresses such a desire after intellectually thinking about the goodness of the matter or its wholesomeness, or because it is upright or proper.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Two relevant quotes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who is rich?  He who rejoices in his lot. [Avot 4:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nobody departs from the world with half of his desire gratified. If he has a hundred he wants to turn them into two hundred, and if he has two hundred he wants to turn them into four hundred. [Ecclesiastes Rabbah 1:32]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Unfortunately, it doesn't quite explicitly deal with what the Rebbe Rashab discusses there*, despite it mentioning these <em>bechinot</em> of Malchut and Yesod d'Adam Kadmon.</p>\n<p>I did more research, and have found a little bit more information:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php?title=%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93%D7%90%22%D7%A7&mobileaction=toggle_view_desktop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabadpedia has some sources on Malchut D'AK</a> and explains how it is related to <em>shevirat hakelim</em>, Knesset Yisrael, and Shechina</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%93%D7%90%22%D7%A7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapadpedia also has some sources on Yesod D'AK</a>, and connects it to the source of Mitzvot, the root of Tikkun, the source of Yosef HaTzaddik.</li>\n<li>I found <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sources_and_References_on_Likkutei_Torah%2C_Re%27eh.19.54?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this note to Likkutei Torah Re'eh</a> which introduced a \"<em>tzarich iyun</em>\" on the roots of Chochma and Binah, at least in Atzilut</li>\n<li>I have found 2 ma'amarim by the Mittler Rebbe that seem highly relevant: <a href=\"https://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/4801940019\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אדם כי יקריב מכם from Pelach HaRimon</a> and <a href=\"https://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/2300670031\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ויאמר גו' לך לך from Torat Chaim</a>*.

This also appears in the Chabadpedia links above.</p>\n<p>I also spoke to my Rav and he couldn't give me the full connection to AK but did explain that the reason why Chochma is \"lower\" than Binah is because it is a <em>nekuda</em>, and Binah is <em>rachava</em>. He said this would make sense as Malchut causes a contraction (words) and Yesod, being part of the Middot, is expansive, similar to the breath of speech. I liked this, although <em>taiching</em> it to Malchut D'AK is something I am still working on as it's not quite the same as regular Malchut - it's the first level of emanation where Hashem's Light can be called by Names.</p>\n<p>I've also had some thoughts myself but I really would like to find a fuller treatment and explanation of how Chochma is rooted specifically in Malchut D'AK and Binah in Yesod D'AK.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of any sources that deal with this other than the ones cited? Does anyone have an explanation, ideally not their chiddush (but feel free), but if they heard it from a Rav etc. I am all ears. I would really like a good, sense-making explanation of how these are connected, ideally source based.</p>\n<p>* Note: I am still learning some of these sources myself, so if I end up figuring it out, I'll <em>bli neder</em> answer.

They would eat to excess, dress flamboyantly, engage in witty repartee, and joke about their situation, continuing to live their lives with no regard for Torah and morality. They would derisively deflect the warnings of the prophet and concern for the future. The prophecies in this section are directed at this reality. The first prophecy refers to the arrogance of the drunkards in the decadent city of Samaria, and the second addresses the inhabitants of Jerusalem, who will also be stricken. The prophecies describe a corrupt society whose members ignore those seeking to offer them the opportunity to escape their situation and show them how to correct their ways. In their indifference, they dismiss the Torah and any attempts to rebuke them, as though the words were spoken in a foreign language or intended for children. The prophet’s harsh tone betrays his contempt for these people. Interspersed with these harsh comments are consolations to the remnant who will survive, describing the honorable, just, and stable society that will be established in the future. These prophecies contain many recurring metaphors and images, some which are obscure.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We have therefore bestirred ourselves to build and\nestablish an iron wall to protect our identity and religious integrity\nand to bolster the strong foundations of our faith and religious\npurity which we have maintained for many centuries going back to our\ncountry of origin, Syria.</p>\n<p>We, the undersigned rabbis, constituting the Religious Court, together\nwith the Executive Committee of the Magen David Congregation and the\noutstanding laymen of the community, do hereby decree, with the\nauthority of our Holy Torah, <strong>that no male or female member of our\ncommunity has the right to intermarry with non-Jews; this law covers\nconversions, which we consider to be <em>fictitious and valueless</em>. We\nfurther decree that no future rabbinic court of the community should\nhave the right or authority to convert male or female non-Jews who\nseek to marry into our community</strong>. We have followed the example of\nthe community in Argentina, which maintains a rabbinic ban on any of\nthe marital arrangements enumerated above, an edict which has received\nthe wholehearted and unqualified endorsement of the Chief Rabbinate in\nIsrael. This responsa is discussed in detail in Devar Sha’ul, Yoreh\nDeah, Part II to Part VI. In the event that any member of our\ncommunity should ignore our ruling and marry, their issue will have to\nsuffer the consequences. Announcements to this effect will be made\nadvising the community not to allow any marriage with children of such\nconverts. We are confident that the Jewish People are a holy people\nand they will adhere to the decision of their rabbis and will not\nconceive of doing otherwise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Questions</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>What is being prohibited?\n<ul>\n<li>According to this ban, can a Syrian marry a child of a convert?

Then, I realized, what about the two parts of the tribe of Jacob, Ephraim and Mannaseh? Though they were Jacob's grandchildren, he essentially adopted them when he blessed them. Also, I remember hearing that the tribe of Mannaseh was weak and more minor than Ephraim, how can this be when Mannaseh had so much land? (see map). Also, who is Re'uvain? On the back of my book cover (The Midrash Says) It references Re'uvain, Leah's son and his gift to her of duadaim-flowers.

This is what is stated below (8:3): “And I was intimate with the prophetess, etc.,” and we do not find a prophet's wife called a prophetess unless she prophesied. Some interpret this as being said about Hezekiah, but it is impossible, because, when you count his years, you find that Hezekiah was born nine years before his father's reign.<br />\n<strong>And some interpret that this is the sign, that she was a young girl and incapable of giving birth</strong></em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do we know which commentaries Rashi is referring to when he says that \"some interpret that this is the sign, that she was a young girl and incapable of giving birth\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Partial answer:</p>\n<p>A few scholars suggest that this was supposedly a reference to the Christian interpretation of the word \"almah\" as virgin. According to them, Rashi probably originally included an argument against this interpretation, but it was lost over time, perhaps due to censorship or scribal error, or, perhaps, as Yehuda Rosenthal suggested, the whole sentence was a Christian addition to the commentary.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>However, I'm a bit skeptical of these proposals. I checked a number of 13th century manuscripts of Rashi's commentary on Isaiah (the oldest ones I've found so far) and they're all pretty much the same in this passage - no hint of any censorship or scribal error.<sup>2</sup> Of course, that doesn't preclude either of the two options; they may have indeed occurred prior to the 13th century. But that would of course make them very old changes, taking place apparently not long after Rashi died (ca. 1105 CE, the early 12th century), which considerably lowers the odds of this actually being some kind of censorship or scribal error.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>I have not yet found any who suggest that Rashi based himself on earlier commentators, but I'll update if I find any such statement.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> See for example: Nehemias Kronberg, <em>Raschi als Exeget: mit besonderer Rücksicht auf das Sprachwissenschaftliche in seinem Bibel-Commentar</em>, Breslau 1882, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=ZokDEJfUAv0C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9F&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 11, n. 1</a>; <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Maarsen</a>, <em>Parshan-Data</em>, Amsterdam 5690/1930, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34653&st=&pgnum=47\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 23, n. 24</a> (in Hebrew); <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Shor</a>, \"The Source of Wisdom\" (מקור חכמה), in: Rabbi Yehuda Leib Maimon (ed.), <em>Sefer Rashi</em> (ספר רש\"י), Jerusalem 5716/1956, p. 457, n. 6 (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah); <a href=\"https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/rosenthal-judah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehuda Rosenthal</a>, \"Rashi's Anti-Christian Polemic on Tanach\" (הפולמוס האנטי־נוצרי של רש\"י על התנ\"ך), in: Yehuda Rosenthal, <em>Studies and Sources</em> (מחקרים ומקורות), Jerusalem 5727/1967, p. 111 (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Ms. British Library, Harley 150, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990001205940205171-1,FL30141500%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 135r</a> (1257); Ms. St. Petersburg, Russia Ms. EVR I 11, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990000788520205171-1,FL37467226%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 70r</a> (from before 1271); Ms. St. Petersburg, Russia Ms. EVR I C 6, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990000893970205171-1,FL37608492%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 99v</a> (1285); Ms. Wrocław, Poland Ms. 104 II, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990000687000205171-1,FL81242934%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 70v</a> (1288); Ms. Palatina Library, Parma, Italy, Cod.

But what about the custom on the latter days of Pesach? Is that recorded anywhere in the Talmud? If not, where do we first see the appearance of such a custom?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Frankel/Goldschmidt maḥzor for Pesaḥ says that the only reference to \"half-Hallel\" (הלל בדילוג) in the Talmud is for Rosh Ḥodesh, and the earliest source for Pesaḥ is from the Geonim. See p14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮... ולפי המקורות התנאיים ומנהג א״י העתיק אין הלל בשאר ימי הפסח כלל כי אינם חלוקים מיו״ט ראשון בקרבנותיהם. הלל בדילוג (המכונה לעתים ״חצי הלל״) לא היה ידוע בא״י בתקופת המשנה והתלמוד ונודע לראשונה בתלמוד הבבלי על ראש־חודש (תע׳ כח ע״ב), ולעניין חוה״מ פסח נזכר כעניין ידוע ומובן בימי הגאונים. (הערה: ה״ג, סוף הלכות לולב, עמ׳ ‬357‮; אמנם בסרע״ג לא נזכר הלל של חוה״מ פסח ואולי אין זה אלא טעות.)</p>\n<p>... and according to the Tannaitic sources and the old practice of Erets Yisra'el, Hallel is not said at all in the remaining days of Pesaḥ because they are not distinguished from the first Yom Tov day as to their offerings. Hallel with skipping (sometimes called \"half Hallel\") is unknown in Erets Yisra'el in the time of the Mishna and the Talmud and is first mentioned in the Talmud Bavli regarding Rosh Ḥodesh (Taanit 28b), and as for Ḥol HaMo'ed Pesaḥ, it is attested as a known and self-evident practice in the times of the Geonim. (footnote: Halachot Gedolot, end of the laws of lulav, page 357; however, in Seder Rav 'Amram Gaon, Hallel on Ḥol HaMo'ed Pesaḥ is not mentioned, but perhaps this is simply a mistake.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The passage in Halachot Gedolot starts <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Halakhot_Gedolot.15.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. There, only Ḥol HaMo'ed is mentioned, but other Geonic sources mention all remaining days of Pesaḥ. For example, in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=212&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Siddur Rav Sa'adia Gaon</a>, the Gaon writes: ואמא פי אלסתה איאם אלאכ֗ר ליס יקאל אלא בעצ֗ה (translation: but on the other six days, we only say part of it [Hallel]).</p>\n\n\n",

And likewise, if Israel is strong, then Edom must be weak.  רש''י mentions b.Megilla 6a, where the same idea is depicted with the cities of Jerusalem and the city of Caesarea, which represents Edom / Rome.</p>\n<p>Why then we (Jews) are not commanded to boycott the Western world? Or should we at least be happy if the Western world collapses? Why haven't I never heard something similar? Is this just a process that happens at the End of times?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There can be several answers to this question, which really speak about the same idea:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>According to Rav Yom-Tov Schwarz's book <a href=\"https://www.urimpublications.com/eyes-to-see-recovering-ethical-torah-principles-lost-in-the-holocaust.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Eyes to See\"</a>, chapter 24, <em>The Primary Mission of a Jew today is for the World to Extol G-d and the Jews on Account of His Conduct</em>. The essay is included in Part VII <em>Relations with Non-Jews</em> on pages 262 - 282. It deals with the mitzvah of <em>kiddush Hashem</em>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... the central focus of our anticipation for future redemption is concentrated effort on the <em>kiddush HaShem</em> before the eyes of all the nations which will occur at that time - thus reversing the longstanding era of <em>chilul HaShem</em> before the eyes of the gentiles that began with the Temple's destruction and will continue as long as we remain in exile amongst the nations,  as Rashi explains in  Tractate Yoma 86a. Commenting on the verse in Ezekiel 36:20 \"They came among the nations where they came, and they desecrated My holy Name, when it was said of them, 'These are the people of HaShem, yet they departed his land,'\" Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For it is stated, \"They desecrated My holy Name,\" In what way was it desecrated? When the gentiles in whose midst they were exiled said of them, \"Look! These are the people of HaShem, but He could not save them from being exiled.\" Thus, G-d's name is desecrated, and G-d's honor is diminished.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We do not have any specific commandments for our relationship with Edom (except for marriage with Edomite converts). Due to mixture of nations that occured under Assyrian and Babylonian kings, we do not know which nation is made out of Edomites. Therefore, the main focus, according to R. Schwarz (and many sources that he brings - Rambam, Maharal, Sforno, Smag, etc.) must be in mitzva observance and kiddush HaShem.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The understanding of what it means to be strong in Judaism comes from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:1</a>:</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who is mighty? He who subdues his [evil] inclination, as it is said: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty (i.e. <em>strong</em>); and he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city” (Proverbs 16:32).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we see in the present world, some nations and political leaders seek to create disorder in the world often because these people carry inside many conflicts which they cannot address.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The Western Society with its freedoms is much closer to the Jewish ideal as compared to every other society that we lived under in any part of the world. Many changes that occurred in recent years in Europe and America actually destroy western society and turn in into a totalitarian socialist one. Free business carries much G-dliness as it builds relations among people. Boycotting it will be destroying the efforts of many people who built it turning the wheel of history backwards.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Aryeh Kaplan offers a good summary of rabbinic literature on this word in his commentary <em>The Living Torah</em> (Gen. 31:19)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Teraphim</em> in Hebrew, sexual images, from the word <em>turpha</em> (<em>Tanchuma</em> 12; <em>Zohar</em> 164a). These were images having\nhuman form (cf. 1 Samuel 19:13). In some cases, they were made out of the shrunken head of a first-born infant\n(<em>Targum Yonathan</em>; <em>Tanchuma</em> 12). They were not necessarily idols (Rambam, from 1 Samuel 19:13; Judges 17:5,\n18:5), but here they were used for idolatrous purposes (Genesis 31:30; <em>Zohar</em>). In general, they were used as a\nmeditative device to obtain messages (Hosea 3:4, Zechariah 10:2; Ibn Ezra; Radak; Ralbag; Rashi on Ezekiel\n21:26). The <em>teraphim</em> would be tapped, inducing a relaxed, meditative state (<em>Zohar</em> 164a, from 2 Samuel 24:16; cf.\nYad, <em>Avodath Kokhavim</em> 11:6; Chinukh 510).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As for why the Torah specifically uses this name, the Ramban gives one suggestion that goes along with his interpretation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁהֵם כֵּלִים לְקַבֵּל הַשָּׁעוֹת, וְיִקְסְמוּ בָּהֶם לָדַעַת עֲתִידוֹת, וְהַמִּלָּה נִגְזֶרֶת מִלְּשׁוֹן \"רְפֵה יָדַיִם\" (שם ב יז ב) \"נִרְפִּים אַתֶּם נִרְפִּים\" (שמות ה יז), יִקְרְאוּ אוֹתָם \"תְּרָפִים\" לִרְמֹז בִּשְׁמָם כִּי דִּבּוּרָם כְּמוֹ נְבוּאָה רָפָה, תָּבֹא בָּרֹב וּתְכַזֵּב לְעִתִּים רְחוֹקוֹת, כְּמוֹ שֶׁאָמְרוּ (זכריה י ב) \"כִּי הַתְּרָפִים דִּבְּרוּ אָוֶן\". וְהִנֵּה יַעֲשׂוּ אוֹתָם קְטַנֵּי אֲמָנָה לָהֶם לֵאלֹהִים, לֹא יִשְׁאֲלוּ בַּשֵּׁם הַנִּכְבָּד וְלֹא יִתְפַּלְּלוּ אֵלָיו, רַק כָּל מַעֲשֵׂיהֶם בַּקְּסָמִים אֲשֶׁר יַגִּידוּ לָהֶם הַתְּרָפִים.</p>\n<p>These are vessels to receive a knowledge of the hours, and they\ndivine with them in order to gain knowledge of future events. The word\n<em>teraphim</em> is derived from the expressions: <em>‘rephai’ (weak) handed</em>;\n<em>‘nirpim’ (idle) ye are, idle</em>. <strong>They are called “teraphim” in order to\nhint by their name that their words are like a weak prophecy</strong>, usually\noccurring as a prophecy for many days hence and turning out to be\nfalse, just as the prophets have said, <em>For the teraphim have spoken\nvanity</em>. People of little faith set them up for themselves as gods.\nThey do not seek to know by the glorious name of the Eternal, nor do\nthey offer their prayers to Him. Rather, their deeds are guided by\ndivination revealed to them by the teraphim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, the Shadal argues that this was not their real name, and that they were known as <em>elohim</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמנם התרפים נ\"ל שהם כלים שהיו קוסמים בהם לדעת העתידות והנסתרות, <strong>והיו\nנקראים אלהים</strong>, לא שהיו עובדים אותם ממש, אלא שהיו חושבים שהאל או האלילים\nמשפיעים על הכלים ההם ומודיעים הנסתרות על ידם (קרוב לענין העגל שעשו\nישראל, והעגלים שעשה ירבעם, ופסל מיכה)</p>\n<p>Although the above-mentioned teraphim were instruments used to perform magic to know the future and the hidden, <strong>and were called elohim</strong>, they did not actually worship them. They thought that God or the idols influenced those instruments and revealed the hidden through them (similar to the case of the calf that Israel made, and the calves that Jeroboam made, and Micah's statue)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea of whether these are idols or not (and what it means to call them by name) is a separate question. In the above explanation, these objects are referred to as <em>terafim</em> in the Torah (rather than <em>elohim</em>) to hint that they are for people of little faith.</p>\n\n\n",

Among the things he introduced there and the worst of them was the two golden calves to be semi worshipped. Why did he need to do that for? As Chazal say part of his argument was that since Achiyah HaShiloni had prophesized his kingdom it is a legitimate one and therefore in the need of its own Beis Hamikdash. He even went so far as to use an anti-idol worship argument and said that we should no longer go Yerushlayim because it has been too defiled by the idol worship structures and actions of Shlomo Hamelech’s wives. Etc.</p>\n<p>Why couldn’t he simply make those arguments and build a variant temple without introducing idol worship of his own in it?

A new variant temple  should have been a much easier sell without bringing the Egel in it.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems to me that your working assumption is that once the Temple was constructed, all members of Am Yisrael instantly forgot the old ways of using the bamot and other previous forms of worship. In such a reality, it would probably indeed make more sense to push for a separate monolithic temple in the Kingdom of Israel to rival the one in Yerushalayim.</p>\n<p>However, the continuous usage of bamot throughout the entire First Temple period, even during the reigns of righteous kings (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.15.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:15:14</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.22.43-44?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22:43-44</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.12.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:12:3-4</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.14.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:3-4</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.15.3-4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">15:3-4</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.15.34-35?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">34-35</a>; etc), seems to indicate the opposite: Many members of the nation clung to the old ways. Perhaps there were select periods where worship was mostly, if not entirely, focused at the Temple, but there was always a historical memory of an apparent legitimacy of bamot-usage. There are indications of the continuous survival of other such heterodoxies among Yisrael. For example, the bronze snake made by Moshe became a cultic object called Nechushtan (eventually destroyed by Chizkiyahu in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.18.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:18:4</a>); many generations prior Gideon made some kind of golden <em>ephod</em> which apparently became the subject of a certain form of cultic worship (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.8.24-27?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 8:24-27</a>); and the Name of Hashem is invoked multiple times throughout the story of the statue of Micha and the Danites, which indicates that in the minds of those involved, they were worshipping Hashem in a legitimate fashion. Recall that even when the Tabernacle was already set up in Shiloh, the 2.5 Transjordanian tribes set up their own altar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.22.10-34?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 22:10-34</a>). Officially it was only supposed to be a model altar, for no practical use. But how long do you suppose a perfect copy of an altar remains unused?<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Not to defend these customs, but there is some logic in bamot, which represent a decentralized model of worship - in a society where making sacrifices is a daily business and part of everyone's life, it's much easier bringing a sacrifice to a local cultic center rather than hauling it all the way up to the capital. Yerushalayim is fine for most of the Kingdom of Judah (although is still quite some walking distance from the edges of the kingdom), but most of the other tribes were located much farther away. Synagogues, in a sense, are a continuation of the local bamot. Or rather, they are based on the same basic human necessity: a place of worship that's just a stone's throw away (more or less).</p>\n<p>In my opinion, Yerovam took advantage of these lingering heterodox beliefs and customs by institutionalizing (or perhaps, reinstitutionalizing) the bamot and other old concepts: bringing back the golden calf in a decentralized form (two instead of one), reinstituting the non-kohen priests of the bamot (see Rabbi Yehuda's opinion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Zevachim.14.10?ven=hebrew%7CMishnah,_ed._Romm,_Vilna_1913&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Zevachim 14:10</a> that there was no necessity of kohanim in the bamot; this view may also be indicated by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.1.1?lang=bi&p2=Targum_Jonathan_on_I_Samuel.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Yonatan on Shmuel 1:1:1</a> which states that Elkanah divided up kodashim [despite being a Levite]), reactivating two important ancient Israelite centers of worship: Dan and Beit El, and so forth. For a discussion of the background of various elements of the new/old cult set up by Yerovam, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/149073/20472\">this answer</a>.</p>\n<p>In other words, Yerovam's argument was likely that he was reinstituting a form of worship of <strong>Hashem</strong> (and not pagan idols!) that had long been considered perfectly legitimate by many members of Am Yisrael (though whether Yerovam himself entirely believed in the legitimacy of what he was doing may be debatable. But it's also possible that he convinced himself over time).<sup>1</sup> And to further legitimize this new/old religion, as well as further distancing the tribes who were part of his kingdom from the Kingdom of Judah, he denounced the Temple in Yerushalayim, thereby sealing the deal.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.102a.1?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Sanhedrin 102a</a> notes that Yerovam received a stamp of approval from Achiyah Ha'Shiloni. The commentators are largely in agreement that Achiyah intended to approve all halachically legitimate rulings by Yerovam, however the approval convinced many people from Yisrael to believe that Achiyah also approved the religion Yerovam set up, and as such it turned out to be a mistake on Achiyah's part to sign such a writ of approval. Perhaps Yerovam also became convinced that this was Achiyah's actual intention.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>All of the kohanim worked at and had an interest in Solomon's temple. if he were to make his temple the same thing, he would only get the second rate fringe cohanim and if its worship was similar, people could compare them.  also. if the people remained accustomed to the same kind of worship, it would be easier for them to revert back. he made them worship idols to burn the bridge</p>\n<p>as for why he put the 2 sites at dan and bet el, it couldn't have been for convenience because those places are at the edge of the kingdom.</p>\n\n\n",

I have noticed people talking about their doubts (in tiny comments here and there and in other conversations), and I thought about it; other than random times during shiur, there isn't any time to talk about philosophy/theology at my school. No separate class (besides the low Gemara class, where there is also a Machshava class, but I find it less likely to have these doubts). Is this different in other schools? Does anyone have an explanation as to why a school wouldn't build it in? Does anyone have any suggestions on how to build it into a school schedule, in theory? My first thought for the last question was maybe build it into the English curriculum, but then the question would be what books, and how would a gentile teach that class? For this purpose I was using philosophy to describe philosophy of religion, topics such as understanding arguments for and against(more why those arguments aren't good) the existence of God.</p>\n\n\n",

In Sameach Tesamach he writes (sampling two lines):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\"בעצמות אינו שייך ספירות ח״ו, אבל באור א״ס שייך ספירות אלא שלא יש מספר לספירות שם...\"</li>\n<li>\"באמת באור א״ס אינו שייך שיש שם מציאות ספירות... אלא ... קריאת שמות בלבד...\"</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This exact point is discussed by the Mittler Rebbe in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/The_Gate_of_Unity\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'ar HaYichud</a>, chapters 7-10, although he doesn't quote his sources.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>\"בעצמות לא יתכן לומר עדיין ענין עשר ספירות כלל...\"</li>\n<li>\"ובאמת גם בבחינת העצמות דאור אין סוף... כלול בעצמו י׳ ספירות... עד ולאו מכל אלין מדות כלל.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the Mittler Rebbe uses the Pardes' \"version\", and the Rebbe Rashab quotes <em>both</em>.

See Igros Moshe Orach Chaim 1:39 (third to last paragraph) who quotes the Aruch Hashulchan's ruling with regard having mechitzos in shul at a low enough height that one would be able to see womens' uncovered hair, and he says that \"kvar horeh zakein baal Aruch Hashulchan\" that for the above monetioned reason this would be permitted.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Leah getting annoyed at Rachel about the dudaim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>You'll have to excuse me for not bringing my source, except I saw it in the Schottenstein Chumash, and my mind seems to remember it was Ibn Ezra or Ramban (perhaps someone can help if they know, otherwise I can try and look it up later) but...</p>\n<p>It is said that Leah got annoyed at Rachel for asking for some dudaim, because she felt that Rachel was being self-centred (or something similar). It went further on to say that Leah was annoyed that Rachel married Yaakov after Leah, creating this competitiveness in the marriage in the first place (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno%20on%20Genesis%2030:15:1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a>).</p>\n<p>I was really taken aback by this. How can we reconcile this with the fact that Leah was a Tzaddeket? Leah knew that Rachel was supposed to marry Yaakov and he was tricked into marrying Leah instead. Despite that Rachel didn't want Leah to be embarrassed so gave her the passwords etc during the marriage.</p>\n<p>So, it seems to me that in the name of normal human decency, Leah should a) feel bad that due to their father's evil, Leah married Yaakov when that wasn't his or Rachels initial intention - basic bashfulness is a trait specific to the Jewish people... and b) feel grateful that despite that, Rachel looked after her and made it as pleasant as possible.</p>\n<p>Instead, she now is annoyed at Rachel, has no empathy that Rachel has no children, and in fact thinks that Rachel did something wrong by proceeding as planned and marrying her love, Yaakov? It just doesn't add up to me.</p>\n<p>I get that Leah was also a victim in all this, and had her own problems of feeling unloved, but should that really be a cause for this indecent reaction?</p>\n<p>Help me understand.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I had a thought about this once, I don't recall seeing it anywhere, so I'll share it.</p>\n<p>Leah had eyes ruined from all her crying, as Rashi brings from Chazzal, she thought she was going to marry Esav since they were both the older sibling.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועיני לאה רכות. שהיתה סבורה לעלות בגורלו של עשו ובוכה שהיו הכל אומרים שני בנים לרבקה ושתי בנות ללבן, הגדולה לגדול והקטנה לקטן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My chidush is that although we always mention these prayers in praise of her, we never seem to focus on the outcome of her crying. I would suggest that Leah heard about Yaakov sneaking and getting the bechora and blessings, and she assumed, perhaps rightfully, that Yaakov was now her true match. And maybe she even believed it was her prayers that helped him succeed.\nBased on this theory we could understand how Leah believed it was Rachel who not only 'practically took her husband' but was even more incensed after the duda'im incident.</p>\n<p>I would offer a slight proof that they knew about the bechora and bracha incidents, as Yaakov was not shy about his sneakiness when he told Rachel he was a brother of her father in this regard.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומדרשו אם לרמאות הוא בא גם אני אחיו ברמאות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course this could get complicated to the point of impossible if we assume like Chazzal that Rachel and Leah were very young and there were multiple decades between Yaakov's escape and arrival by Lavan.</p>\n\n\n",

Elokim can conceal, but its deeper role is to make Havayah receivable, like digging out a channel that draws water from a powerful river into a measured flow, so the water becomes available and useful.</p>\n<p>On this basis the maamar reads Yaakov’s phrase “and Havayah will be for me Elokim” to mean: the very light of Havayah should shine for him through Elokim in a way that does not hide but reveals, so that Hashem Himself is internalised within Yaakov's soul (kelim) and generates love and awe. This is the unification “Havayah–Elokim are one,” where the letters of Elokim serve as channels that reveal the light of Havayah inwardly.</p>\n<p>[The maamar further contrasts the Avots’ attainment with the later giving of the Torah: the Avot drew the “lower Havayah” (Z'A of Atzilut) by effecting the unification of Havayah and Elokim, ensuring that Elokim would not obscure the light of Havayah. Yaakov’s wording “Havayah will be for me Elokim” is presented as part of that level. At Matan Torah, however, the “higher Havayah” was revealed: Hashem's true Essence, via Torah as inner light and mitzvot as encompassing light, surpassing what the Patriarchs accessed. Thus, within the maamar’s frame, Yaakov’s phrase expresses Havayah revealed through Elokim on the plane available before Sinai, not the higher revelation that came with the Torah]</p>\n<p>Now, why the timing - \"when I return in peace\", etc? The answer to this is found in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3140411/jewish/page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מאמר ושבתי בשלום תשל\"ח</a>. Yaakov is about to embark on a descent into \"the real world\" where Havaya is very obscured. It is a world of concealment, and by passing through it in peace - by passing the test - he will elevate himself <em>so that he can indeed see that Havaya is Elokim</em>.</p>\n<p><sup>(I used AI to help copy edit parts of this answer, but I have learned both maamarim and confirm what is written is correct)</sup></p>\n\n\n",

The English translation is by Aryeh Newman. I will follow her essay in answering the OP's question with some rearrangement for brevity. In fact, most of the ideas can be found in the supercommentaries on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.20?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 28:20</a>, and I will indicate the relevant supercommentaries.</p>\n<p>One should be aware, this is a classic question which has been addressed by midrashim. The way the OP phrased it, essentially can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abarbanel_on_Torah%2C_Genesis.28.10.6?ven=hebrew%7CTorah_Commentary_of_Yitzchak_Abarbanel,_Warsaw_1862&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel on the Torah Bereshis 28.10.6</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How could Jacob act like those who serve upon the condition of receiving a reward, by saying, \"If G-d will be with me and keep me and give me ... \" so and so, the he would accept Him as his G-d. Conversely, then, He would not perform these things for him, He would <em>not</em> be his G-d and he would not serve Him? His grandfather Abraham did not act thus, but was tried many times and without temptation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The following midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.70.4?ven=hebrew%7CDaat_Bereshit_Rabbah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 70:4</a> is an answer to OP's question. It is used to clarify Rashi's comment by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mizrachi%2C_Genesis.28.20.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliyahu Mizrachi on Bereshis 28:20</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Rabbi Abbahu and Rabbi Yoḥanan, one said: The narrative requires rearranging (i.e. chronologically speaking, Yaakov's vow was uttered before the Divine promise to keep him, etc.). The other said: It requires no rearrangement. The one who said: the order was wrong, said so because he wondered how it was possible for Yaakov to say, <em>If</em> G-d will be with me, when G-d had already promised to be with him? How does the one who says the narrative requires no rearrangement, understands the words \"If G-d will be with me?\" It is, rather, that this is what Yaakov said: ‘If the conditions that G-d promised me - to be with me and to protect me, are fulfilled, then I will fulfill my vow.’</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Nechama Leibowitz explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the first view that the order is wrong, Yaakov's vow was not a reaction to the divine promise, but the reverse. Yaakov prayed and petitioned for guardianship and protection, made his promisses and vowed his vow: \"If G-d will be with me,\" after which came a dream and blessings as an answer to hos prayer. According to this Midrash, the Almighty ony reveals Himself after a man approached Him first, in the sense of Tehilim 145:18: \"The LORD is near to all who call Him, to all who call Him with sincerity.\" The reason why R. Abbahu wished to change the order of the narrative, was because it implied Yaakov's lack of faith in the Divine promise.</p>\n<p>How does R. Yoḥanan meet the same objection without changing the order? Surely, his answer: \"If the conditions that G-d promised me are fulfilled\" hardly meets the objection. Yaakov is still casting doubts on the certainty of the Divine promise., but we must understand Yaakov's words in the Midrash to mean: *If I prove worthy of all promises. The promises of protection to the righteous are not absolute and unconditional, but depend on him maintaining his standards of conduct and not deviating to an evil path. The Righteous man cannot assume that he has been granted an irrevocable title deed to comfort and protection, and he has no longer to stand in awe  of his Master, but can do as he likes. On the contrary, man stands in judgement at every moment of his existence, and at any time, his judgement can change. This point is brought in Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.76.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 76:2</a>, which can be found in <a href=\"http://sefaria.org/Genesis.28.20?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban on Bereshis 28:20</a>:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Aḥa: “Behold, I am with you” (Genesis 28:15); “if God will be with me”? (Genesis 28:20). Rather, from here [we learn] that there is no promise to the righteous in this world.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Nechama Leibowitz continues with explanation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ramban explains that the \"reason for the condition, the <em>if</em> qualification, was lest sin should intervene.\" Yaakov then did not, G-d forbid, cast doubts on the Almighty's word, displayed no lack of faith with Him. Perhaps, as a result of his long stay at Lavan's in alien environment, he might succumb to heathen influences. He doubted his own ability to withstand temptation. He might not ultimately prove worthy of the kindnesses promised by G-d. Perhaps sin would soil him. Yaakov did not cast doubts on G-d and His credibility, but on himself and his capacity to withstand temptation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, Yaakov's vow should be viewed as a protection as we see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.31.5?ven=hebrew%7CSifre_on_Deuteronomy,_ed._Dr._Louis_Finkelstein._JTS,_1969&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Devarim 31:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, etc.\" Now would it occur to anyone that Jacob our father would say (Ibid.) \"If G-d will be with me … and He will give me bread to eat and a garment to wear (21) and I return in peace to my father's house, and (only then) He will be a G-d to me!\" (Obviously,) He will be a G-d to me in any event. How, then, is \"and He will be a G-d to me\" to be understood? That His name repose upon me, that no \"base matter\" issue from me from beginning to end.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The words of Sifrei Devarim support the position of Ramban as explained. However, Rashi and Rashbam seem to use this midrash defending the position that once Hashem promised, it should materialize contrary to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.76.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 76:2</a>. The Netziv addresses this difference in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.28.21?lang=bi&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaEmek Davar on Bereshis 28:21</a>, second comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sense of the text supports Ramban that it is the consequent cause, and not Rashi's view. It means that he would not rely on his own might and the power of his hand, but would keep G-d continually in front of him to leed him. Whilst away from home, with Lavan, it was natural for him to place his trust in G-d and not rely on his own efforts. But it was possible for him to be completely self-reliant at home, in his father's house. Regarding this he made his vow and stated that even there, G-d would be his guide and support. In actual fact, though the contingency of \"the Lord shall be my G-d\" is dependent, in the main, on man himself, on his own will, nevertheless the Divine assistance is necessary. It was necessary for Divine providence to be behind him at every step. Therefore, Yaakov worded it as a consequent condition that he could fulfill, if the Divine promisses were realized.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Can someone explain me more detailed which years exactly are meant and what kind of gates this are?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>The Rebbe in <a href=\"https://awtsmoos.com/heichelos/ikar/series/likkuteiSichosVolume15/6?idx=0&sub=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Sichos, parshas Noach, Sicha #2</a> explains that this prophecy of the zohar is saying that in the Hebrew year 5600 (600th year of the 6th millennium, corresponding to the 600th year of Noach's life when the \"windows of the heavens\" opened and the \"wellsprings of the deep\" opened up), that there's going to be me \"wisdom\" from the heavens, new divine wisdom, and new \"water\" (wisdom) from the Earth.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe says that the wisdom from the heavens corresponds to the publishing of Torah Ohr around that time, and the wisdom of the Earth refers to the industrial revolution at that time</p>\n<p>The Rebbe asks why the Zohar connects these two things together. It is understandable that the revelation of the inner secrets of Torah is a preparation for the times of Moshiach, but how does the development of secular science and technology help us enter the Messianic era. Since they are mentioned together, the physical wisdom must serve the spiritual goal.</p>\n<p>The explanation is based on the principle that everything G-d created was made for His honor and for the sake of the Torah. Therefore, the true purpose and perfection of these scientific advancements are achieved only when they are utilized for serving G-d.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe adds a crucial warning here. This explanation does not mean one should attend college or universities to learn these subjects. The atmosphere in those institutions is often filled with ideas that deny Divine Providence and lacks modesty, which presents a serious spiritual danger. The Rebbe is discussing the purpose of the wisdom itself, not giving permission to study it in an environment that is harmful to one's faith.</p>\n<p>The specific connection between technology and Moshiach is that in the Messianic era, the physical flesh itself will see G-dliness. It will not just be a spiritual understanding but a tangible experience. Modern technology provides a physical example of this. For instance, the telephone and radio allow a voice to be heard instantly across great distances. This gives us a tangible way to understand the concept that an Eye sees and an Ear hears everything. It makes the idea of G-d's constant presence feel real to our physical senses, which helps a person act properly.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, just as the Sages say gold was created primarily for the Holy Temple, these technologies were created primarily to spread Torah. When the inner dimension of Torah is broadcast over the radio, the words of G-d physically fill the entire world, reaching even places where no people are present. This provides a taste of the prophecy that the earth will be filled with the knowledge of G-d.</p>\n<p>Finally, the Rebbe explains that science itself is moving closer to Torah. In the past, science viewed the world as being composed of many separate, distinct elements. As science advances, it discovers that matter and energy are interchangeable and seeks a single unifying force in nature. This scientific realization that the world is essentially one unity reflects the spiritual truth of the absolute Unity of G-d taught in Chassidus. By revealing the unity within the physical world, science prepares the world to recognize the Unity of the Creator.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does the Torah only explicitly forbid certain deviant sexual behaviors and not others?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah explicitly forbids sexual relations with animals. It <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/bestiality-in-biblical-and-hittite-law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seems clear</a> that this behavior occurred in the ancient world. However other deviant sexual behaviors (known as paraphilias) are not mentioned as explicitly forbidden. I would like to understand why the torah explicitly forbids bestiality but does not mention other deviant forbidden sexual behaviors (specific types exist but are intentionally omitted here for reasons of modesty). Alternatively the Torah could simply indicate that all sexual activity outside of (normal) male-female union is proscribed, without the need to mention animals or other behaviors at all.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Presuming that most if not all of these behaviors result in zera levatalah, then the question really would boil down to why that's not listed as one of the 613 mitzvos, for which there's already a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16052/if-masturbation-is-so-bad-why-is-it-not-in-list-of-613-mitzvos\">question</a> on this site (and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18398/what-is-the-philosophy-or-logic-for-considering-masturbation-to-be-sinful\">several</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/60658/zera-levatala-source-of-issur-from-torah\">related</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/16522/does-the-act-of-masturbation-cause-a-change-in-ones-spiritual-religious-status\">ones</a>). Aside from the various answers there (at least one of which states that some Rishonim do count it as such), it's also worth noting what R. Schneur Zalman of Liadi writes in his <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7886/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya (ch. 7)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלָכֵן לֹא הוּזְכַּר עֲוֹן זֶרַע לְבַטָּלָה בַּתּוֹרָה בִּכְלַל בִּיאוֹת אֲסוּרוֹת, אַף שֶׁחָמוּר מֵהֶן, וְגָדוֹל עֲוֹנוֹ בִּבְחִינַת הַגַּדְלוּת וְרִבּוּי הַטּוּמְאָה וְהַקְּלִיפּוֹת שֶׁמּוֹלִיד וּמַרְבֶּה בִּמְאֹד מְאֹד בְּהוֹצָאַת זֶרַע לְבַטָּלָה, יוֹתֵר מִבִּיאוֹת אֲסוּרוֹת. רַק, שֶׁבְּבִיאוֹת אֲסוּרוֹת מוֹסִיף כֹּחַ וְחַיּוּת בִּקְלִיפָּה טְמֵאָה בְּיוֹתֵר, עַד שֶׁאֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לְהַעֲלוֹת מִשָּׁם הַחַיּוּת בִּתְשׁוּבָה, אֶלָּא אִם כֵּן יַעֲשֶׂה תְּשׁוּבָה מֵאַהֲבָה רַבָּה כָּל כָּךְ, עַד שֶׁזְּדוֹנוֹת נַעֲשׂוּ לוֹ כִּזְכֻיּוֹת. מִפְּנֵי שֶׁנִּקְלְטָה בִּיסוֹד דְּנוּקְבָא דִקְלִיפָּה הַמְקַבֶּלֶת וְקוֹלֶטֶת הַחַיּוּת מֵהַקְּדוּשָּׁה, מַה שֶּׁאֵין כֵּן בְּזֶרַע לְבַטָּלָה, שֶׁאֵין שָׁם בְּחִינַת נוּקְבָא דִקְלִיפָּה, רַק שֶׁכֹּחוֹתֶיהָ וְחַיְילוֹתֶיהָ מַלְבִּישִׁים לַחַיּוּת שֶׁבַּטִּפּוֹת, כַּיָּדוּﬠַ לְיוֹדְﬠֵי חֵן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gist is that with zera levatalah there's no \"recipient,\" unlike in forbidden relationships, and therefore the type of teshuvah needed to rectify it is of a different kind.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now, assuming that some of these behaviors (reliance on a certain item of clothing, for example) can be incorporated into a male-female relationship without zera levatalah or other implications, then presumably there's no reason for them to be forbidden per se.</p>\n\n\n",

Nouns with Afformatives, paragraph 54.</p>\n<p>The most complete treatment of these suffixes can be found in Jouon and Muraoka <a href=\"https://www.logos.com/product/4607/a-grammar-of-biblical-hebrew-revised-english-edition?ff_showPdpAddSubx=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"A Grammar of Biblical Hebrew\"</a>, Section 88-M Forms with Sufformatives. It distinguishes the following cases:</p>\n<p><strong>Abstract Noun Case Qatalān > Qittalōn</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is made up of <em>qatal</em>+<em>ān</em>. This form of <em><strong>abstract noun</strong></em>, as expected, becomes קְטָלוֹן in Hebrew, which is found only in רְעָבוֹן (<em>famine</em>). Elsewhere <em>qatalān</em> has a doubling of a second consonant (i.e. getting <em>dagesh-chazak</em>). This secondary doubling was perhaps due to the need to preserve the three vowels, which give a form a characteristic aspect. The doubling may also have originated in certain nouns for some phonetic reason and then spread to others.</p>\n<p>Thus we have examples עִוָּרוֹן (<em>blindness</em>) from עִוֵּר; or עִשָּׂרוֹן (<em>a tenth part</em>) from עַשֵׂר.</p>\n<p>The primitive first vowel <em>a</em> (<em>patach</em>) has been only preserved in שַׁבָּתוֹן (<em>abstention from work</em>) probably under the influence of שַׁבָּת. (There is also a curious Greek name of the city <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ακκαρων</a>, Akkadian <em>Amqarruna</em>, while Hebrew is עֶקְרוֹן). Everywhere else, the <em>a</em> (<em>patach</em>) is weakened to <em>i</em> (<em>hiriq</em>) to create a form קִטָּלוֹן (<strong>qittalōn</strong>) probably because it is far from the last stressed syllable <em>ōn</em>. In the construct state or with a suffix the form becomes קִטְלוֹן (<strong>qitlon</strong>, no <em>dagesh</em>), and if the first consonant is gutteral <em>hireq</em> becomes <em>segol</em>:</p>\n<p>Examples: <em>musing</em> הִגָּיוֹן with construct הֶגְיוֹן; <em>tenth part</em> עִשָּׂרוֹן with plural עֶשְׂרוֹנִים. Exception Ezekiel 27:27 עִזְבוֹנִַיִך</p>\n<p>More examples: <em>remembrance</em> זִכָּרוֹן with construct זִכְרוֹן and plural זִכְרוֹנִים. This pattern follows: <em>breaking</em> שִׁבָּרוֹן; <em>deposit</em> פִּקָּדוֹן; <em>hard work</em> עִצָּבוֹן; <em>arid land</em> צִמָּאוֹן; <em>hasty flight</em> חִפָּזוֹן; <em>confidence</em> בִּטָּחוֹן; <em>desolation</em> שִׁמָּמוֹן. There is no dagesh in ר so we get עֵרָבוֹן with <em>segol</em> becoming <em>tzere</em>, however curiously there is a Greek form <a href=\"https://lsj.gr/wiki/%E1%BC%80%CF%81%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B2%CF%8E%CE%BD\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ἀρραβών</a>. Also <em>horror</em> דֵּרָאוֹן.</p>\n<p>In ל\"ה verbs (the last letter of the root is ה turns into י) we find likewise: <em>vision</em> חִזָּיוֹן (however there is a form חָזוֹן described below). <em>Musing</em> הִגָּיוֹן; <em>a kind of song</em> שִׁגָּיוֹן; <em>polished plate</em> גִּלָּיוֹן; <em>purity</em> נִקָּיוֹן; <em>annihilation</em> כִּלָּיוֹן; and no dagesh in ר: <em>pregnancy</em> הֵרָיוֹן. Besides these forms with י, there are some common forms that are likely influenced by Aramaic or Syriac: <em>vision</em> חָזוֹן close to Aramaic חֶזְוָּנָא; and similarly <em>iniquity</em> עָוֹן; <em>good will</em> רָצוֹן; <em>highness</em> גָאוֹן; <em>tumult</em> הָמוֹן; <em>leanness</em> רָזוֹן; <em>anger</em> חָרוֹן.</p>\n<p>In the ע\"י verbs (a two-letter root with a vowel י in-between, such as <em>to judge</em> דִין) the pattern is <em>qat</em> + <em>-ān</em>. I.e. the previously mentioned forms of ל\"ה verbs could have also been influenced by these forms. We have: <em>joy</em> שָׂשׂוֹן (root שׂישׂ); <em>pride</em> זָדוֹן; <em>insolence</em> לָצוֹן.</p>\n<p>Exception: <em>perdition</em> אַבַדּוֹן with <em>dagesh</em> in ד; although the Aramaic אַבְדָן in Esther 9:5.</p>\n<p>Bereshis 3:16 has הֵרֹנֵךְ which violates the form הֶרְיוֹנֵךְ or alternatively הֲרוֹנֵךְ as the rule would dictate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Abstract Noun Case Qitlān</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It can be represented as either קִטְלוֹן or קִטְלָן (no dagesh in the second letter). Examples: <em>success</em> כִּשְרוֹן, <em>advantage</em> יִתְרוֹן; <em>lack</em> חֶסְרוֹן.</p>\n<p>Also the anomalous Hebrew forms, <em>acquisition</em> קִנְיָן; <em>building</em> בִּנְיָן; <em>business</em> עִנְיָן. These words do not have attested construct form.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Abstract Noun Case Qutlān</strong></p>\n<p>Examples: <em>table</em> שֻׁלְחָן; <em>offering</em> קָרְבָּן; <em>loss</em>  אָבְדָן</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Adjectival Case</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Often occurs when the suffix <em>-ān</em> > וֹן is added to certain nouns. Examples: <em>preceding</em> or <em>eastern</em> קַדְמוֹן from <em>east</em> קֶדֶם; <em>last</em> אַחֲרוֹן from <em>behind</em> אַחַר; <em>first</em> רִאשׁוֹן from <em>head</em> רֹאש. The last formation is made by analogy with the two-consonant roots: <em>extreme</em> קִיצוֹן from <em>end</em> קֵץ; <em>outer</em> חִצוֹן from חוּץ; <em>middle</em> תִּכוֹן from תוֹך. Similarly, <em>lower</em> or <em>inferior</em> תַּחְתּוֹן; <em>superior</em> or <em>Most High</em> עֶלְיוֹן</p>\n<p>There are also cases when the suffix is added to the feminine form as in Aramaic. For example, <em>tortuous</em> עֲקַלָּתוֹן; and in case of nouns for serpents לִוְיָתָן, נְחֻשׁתָּן.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Diminutive form</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Examples: <em>pupil of the eye (little man)</em> אִישוֹן; <em>little moons</em> or <em>crescents</em> שַׂהֲרֹנִים; perhaps the names of some reptiles such as <em>horned snake</em> שְׁפִיפוֹן; <em>basilisk</em> צִפְעֹנִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>For example, the name שִמְשוֹן can be read as <em>little sun</em> from <em>sun</em> שֶמֶש. As far as the names in the question, there exist established etymologies for them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><em>Shimon</em> שמעון - based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.34?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 29:33</a> the son is a result of Hashem's hearing of Leah's distress, just like the <em>offering</em> קרבן is a result of a sacrifice.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Pishon</em> פשון - Based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.11?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bereshis 2:11</a>, who either quotes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Habakkuk.1.8?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%A4%D6%B8%D6%96%D7%A9%D7%81%D7%95%D6%BC%20%D7%A4%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%A8%D6%B8%D7%A9%D7%81%D6%B8%D6%91%D7%99%D7%95&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Habakuk 1:8</a> וּפָ֖שׁוּ פָּרָשָׁ֑יו - \"their steeds gallop\", which gives abstract noun for the river name - the result of rushing water; or the fact that they grow flax (פשתן) (Genesis Rabbah 16:2) - i.e. that the river water (פָשׁה - male) is the source of growth of the linen (פשת - female).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Gidon</em> גדעון. The root גדע means to chop off, cut off. Hence גדעון is  someone who chopped many soldiers, i.e. a <em>mighty warrior</em> as given by Alfred Kolatch <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0824603761\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Name Dictionary\"</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><em>Alon</em>/<em>Eilon</em> אלון - means <em>oak tree</em>. The Klein dictionary gives two etymologies. The first appears as an abstract noun derivation from from אול:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%90%D6%B5%D7%9C%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%9F.1?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%90%D6%B7%D7%9C%D6%BC%D7%95%D6%B9%D7%9F&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אֵלוֹן</a> - m.n. oak.

It creates an unusual abstract noun from a future 1st person אֶהֱרֶה <em>I will conceive/implant seeds of knowledge</em>.</li>\n<li>הר <em>mountain</em>, which makes a diminutive <em>small mountain</em>. It would be the case with the name הָרָן, but does not explain the initial א.</li>\n<li>אור <em>light, illuminate</em> - also creates an abstract noun, but does not explain the change of ו into ה.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Klein_Dictionary%2C_%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%9F.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רנן</a> <em>to give ringing cry</em>, <em>to shout of joy</em>. If this is a source of an abstract noun, it is unusual even if one starts from the <em>hiphil</em> form הִרְנִין</li>\n<li>The Kolatch dictionary also suggests that the Arabic word for <em>messenger</em> is close. Unfortunately, I do not know Arabic, and standard translation for messenger is <em>rasoul</em>.</li>\n<li>אהר this is a Syriac/Aramaic root meaning <em>to sexually arrouse</em> (see the <a href=\"https://www.gorgiaspress.com/sokoloff-syriac-lexicon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A Syriac Lexicon</a> by Michael Sokoloff, p.12). This would make a great case of an abstract noun, a result of arousal with intent to conceive, although the Hebrew equivalent is אחר, with ח instead of ה. Women in <em>Mitzraim</em> approached men, who were extremely tired from hard labor. Women aroused them to have relations to conceive children.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

It's about the Alter Rebbe. It's a two parter and both are relevant. Part 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A father, whose son had been attending Yeshiva, came to the Alter\nRebbe and told him how proud he was of his son, that he had made huge\nprogress and was very talented in gemara. The only thing was, this\ntalent was going to his son's head, and the son was getting arrogant.\nThe father was quite repulsed by him, to be honest, and wanted advice\nfrom the Alter Rebbe. The Rebbe told him to come back with his son.</p>\n<p>When they returned the Alter Rebbe asked him which sugya he was\nlearning, and then when the son told him, asked a very good question\non the sugya. The son couldn't work out the answer, so the Rebbe said\n\"no matter, but you agree at least that it's a good question right?\"\nand the son said \"yes, amazing question!\", and the Alter Rebbe\nretorted \"no it isn't!\" and immediately gave an answer that destroyed\nthe question. The son was amazed, and the Alter Rebbe asked him again,\n\"so, that was a good answer wasn't it?\" and the son again exclaimed\n\"yes, profound!\" and the Alter Rebbe did the same: \"no it isn't!\" and\nimmediately brought a devastating <em>kashe</em> on the answer.</p>\n<p>This proceeded several times, \"good <em>kashe</em>, no?\", \"yes, fantastic!\",\n\"no it isn't!\", <em>teretz</em>, etc. etc. After a while, the Rebbe\neventually turned to the father and said, \"nu, I thought you told me\nthat your son was talented in gemara?\". Indeed, the experience brought\nthe son down a peg, and the son walked out a head shorter, but also a\ngreat deal more humble.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The son joined the Alter Rebbe's class, and a few years later, we get part 2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The son came in for a <em>yechidus</em> with the Alter Rebbe. As they were\ncatching up, including talking about what they were learning at the\ntime, the Rebbe said \"what do you think of the Mordechai on our\nsugya?\". The son said, \"to be honest, I didn't really get it. His\nanswer is very <em>shver</em>, and seemingly unnecessarily so\". The Rebbe\nasked why he thought that, and the son said \"I can think of at least 3\nbetter, simpler and easier answers\". The Rebbe asked him what they\nwere and he proceeded to list them out. The Rebbe then said \"very\ngood, and there are others too\" and proceeded to give another 6.</p>\n<p>After he was done, the Alter Rebbe then proceeded to dismantle every\nsingle one of the 9 answers, one by one, until all that was left was\nthe Mordechai. The son was stunned. Then the Alter Rebbe turned to the\nson and said \"and you want to know the difference between a Rishon and\nan Acharon? Do you think the Mordechai had to go through all 10\nanswers before realising that the one he gave was the only one? No,\nnot at all. He went straight for the correct answer\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How is this relevant? Well, you make a strong case by bringing the gemara in Eruvin 13b that says that Rebbi Meir's mind was so profound, that he could give a proof that something is pure, and another proof that something is impure and nobody could work out which proof was better. He had a student who could make 48 proofs either way, and the gemara brings evidence of another student from Yavne who could bring 150!</p>\n<p>What is this telling us? That there is no truth? That there is no such thing as proof? No, I don't think so. I think this is telling us that <strong>the ability to assess proof is a skill</strong> that has a huge ladder of mastery to climb - they couldn't make Rabbi Meir the posek ador because he was too high up the ladder, they couldn't make use of his reasoning (the key point: <strong>if they could, they would have</strong>). This actually is the root of why people are so very capable of reasoning out anything they want - something we see today very prevalently in the world of social media: <strong>our character traits directly affect our thinking</strong>.</p>\n<p>We have an \"intellectual soul\", and a \"vital, natural soul\" (i.e. our emotional being), and the former is enclothed in the latter. This means that our heart is נתפס, \"grasps\" the mind, and is thus able to influence it. It is able to \"bribe\" the mind, and thus alter its reasoning. In the words of the great-great-great-grandson of the Alter Rebbe, The Frierdiker Rebbe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כמו שאנו רואים בחוש שהחפץ ותשוקת הלב מטה את השכל להשכיל דוקא כחפץ\nלבבו, ובפרט בענין הנוגעללבו ה״ה משכיל בזה כמה השכלות וממציא המצאות\nמופלגות <strong>והכל רק כחפץלבבו, עד שאינו יכול  השכיל ולהשיג כלל באופן אחר\nואינו מבין כלל איך יכול להיות באופן אחר כו׳, ואמיתת הענין הוא לא כלפי\nהאמת כלל</strong></p>\n<p>And we see tangibly that the desire and will of the heart inclines the\nintellect to understand specifically as the heart desires, especially\nin a matter that touches the heart. He will then grasp this with many\nintellectual arguments and produce astonishing innovations, <strong>all only\naccording to the desire of his heart, to the point that he cannot\nunderstand in any other way at all, and he cannot comprehend how it\ncould be otherwise. And the truth is that none of this corresponds to\nactual truth whatsoever</strong>. [ <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31676&st=&pgnum=134\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">הבאים ישרש יעקב יציץ ופרח ישראל כו׳ from\nספר המאמרים תרפ\"ה</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This influence is practically unavoidable, which is why the only way to ensure that our thinking and reasoning are accurate, good and have a chance of attaining the \"actual truth\" is if our heart is thoroughly good as well. Basically, the ladder is, at least in part*, our character traits**.</p>\n<p>Ultimately though, if we work hard, and apply morality to our thinking process - integrity, intellectual honesty, rid ourselves of laziness, arrogance etc. - the truth is within reach through reason and proof. As the Alter Rebbe showed, with enough tenacity, <strong>one can bring an end to the cycle of <em>kashe</em> and <em>teretz</em> and we can have hope of getting closer to understanding Hashem and what He wants from us</strong>. This is why our Sages, our Gedolim, had perfect character traits - if they didn't, they wouldn't be Gedolim!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Indeed, this is exactly what the Rebbe Rashab (the great-great grandson of the Alter Rebbe) explains in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58811&st=&pgnum=121\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ש״פ תולדות - ויתן לך in ספר המאמרים תרס\"ו</a> (Hemshech Samech Vav):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The essential idea of pilpul is that the first comprehension… immediately becomes the subject of many questions… until the matter is completely hidden… However, it does not remain in concealment. Rather, <strong>after all the concealments and absence of understanding, one reaches the true comprehension of the matter… At that point, all the questions and concealments are automatically resolved, and the light of truth shines forth with greater clarity and purity</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“What brings one to the true essence of the matter are specifically the questions and concealments… <strong>through questioning and pilpul, one clarifies all the dross and impurities within the intellect</strong> — like filtering wine many times — <strong>until the light of truth shines</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“This is ‘He has set me in darkness’ — this is the Babylonian Talmud — whose path is or chozer (reflected light): to obscure through many questions, not to remain in darkness, but to reach the ‘essential concealment’ of chochmah from which a deeper light emerges, and to purify the dross <strong>so that a higher light of truth shines</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Yerushalmi often gives clear rulings with less pilpul (or yashar, direct light), while Bavli’s toil reaches the ‘essential concealment’ — the level of Torah that ‘<strong>only Elokim understands its path</strong>’ — attained specifically by striking the flint through toil and questions.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Although toil in Torah became necessary after Moshe struck the rock… this very concealment yields a superior advantage: <strong>by laboring through garments and questions, one reaches the true essence of Torah</strong> as it is in absolute essential concealment — the King’s delights in His Essence.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Therefore, the multitude of halachic details, safeguards, and even stringencies are not a flaw but a feature — drawn from supernal wisdom and great love — instruments to refine good from the Tree of Knowledge, <strong>so that truth emerges clarified</strong>.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He will act for those who wait for Him… <strong>those who press and delve to discern the clarified truth</strong>. Through strenuous analysis and many questions, one returns to the source, the essential concealment, from which infinite revelation flows.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>(I used my AI assistant to extract these quotes from my personal copy of the <em>ma'amar</em>, and ChatGPT to translate them, and I went through them to ensure their accuracy)</sup></p>\n<p>All in all he explains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a purpose to <em>pilpul</em>, the phenomenon that you pointed out i.e. that we have multiple competing proofs that we have to work through etc.</li>\n<li>It happened after Moshe hit the rock, but is ultimately for the good.

I understand you're <em>allowed</em> to eat a fruit outside the sukkah but isn't it praiseworthy to eat and drink even water in the sukkah?

They were involved in a couple of wars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>During the battle between the northern tribes led by Devorah and Barak, and the Canaanites led by Yavin and Sisera, Chever the Keinite, husband of Yael, is stated to have separated from the rest of the Keinites and to have agreed to a peace treaty of sorts with the Canaanites. Practically, however, he seems to have opted out of active involvement in the war. A kind of biblical Switzerland, if you will. Yael decided to break the neutrality by killing Sisera (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.4.11?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 4:11</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.4.17-22?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17-22</a>).</li>\n<li>When Shaul went to battle Amalek, he warned the Keinites, who lived in the vicinity, to clear out, otherwise they will be attacked as well.

David claimed to have robbed various Judahite territories in the Negev, including the Negev of the Keinites, though he actually robbed other southern nations (the Geshurites, Gizrites, and Amalekites) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.27.8-12?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:27:8-12</a>). After defeating the Amalekites in a later battle, he split the loot between the Judahite territories, including elders of Judah who lived in the Negev of the Keinites (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.30.30?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:30:30</a>). This indicates that at this stage the Keinites began mixing in with the Judahites and David did not consider them fair game for robbery (hence his earlier decision to leave them alone in ch. 27). The Keinites probably had some sort of treaty with the Judahites (possibly indicated also by their mention in the Judahite genealogical lists in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.55?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:2:55</a>).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On the other hand, there were several non-Jews in David's government and army:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.27.30?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ovil the Ishmaelite</a>, in charge of David's camels.<sup>1</sup></li>\n<li>Perhaps Yechedyahu the Meronothite (according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.27.30?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Malbim_on_I_Chronicles.27.30.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a>), in charge of female donkeys.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.27.31?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaziz the Hagarite</a>, in charge of flocks.</li>\n<li>Perhaps <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.11.39?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzelek the Ammonite</a>, one of Yoav's arms-bearers.<sup>2</sup></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.11.46?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yitmah the Moabite</a>, another warrior.</li>\n<li>Cherethites and Peletites - non-Israelite units in David's army.

The entire dynamic in Gerar was not the same as the dynamic in Egypt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וישאלו אנשי המקום כו'. ששאלו לאשתו ולא לו כי הוא יאמר אחותי מאימת מות פן יהרג לנושאה כי בעולת בעל יש להם. ע\"כ שאלו לאשתו כי היא תאמר אישי פן יקחוה כי זה מוראה ולא תחוש פן יהרג בעלה כי ברית כרותה לאבימלך עם אביו. אך הוא בשומעו לא הניחה להשיב פן תאמר אישי הוא ויהרג. ע\"כ קפץ והשיב הוא ויאמר אחותי היא ולא מיראת אבימלך כי הלא היה לבו בטוח בו על אשר כרת עם אברהם ברית. וגם יזכור מה שאירע לו עם שרה אמו. אך מה שירא לאמר אשתי הוא על אנשי המקום. וזהו פן יהרגוני אנשי המקום כו' וכאשר ארכו לו שם הימים נתן לב לאבימלך להסתכל בדבר. באומר כי לא יתכן היה יצחק שרוי בלא אשה ימים רבים. וישקיף וירא אותו מצחק שהוא ענין נשוק וחבוק אז ויקרא כו' הנה לפנינו כי אשתך היא ואומר אך הוא למעט כי לא ראה התשמיש ממש כ\"א קרוב אליו שהוא הצחוק כמדובר ואיך אמרת אחותי היא. ולא אמר למה אמרת כלומר הנה כדי לשקר אתם מקרבים הדבר כמ\"ש אברהם אחותי בת אבי כו' אך אתה איך אמרת אחותי היא. איך הוא התואנה שבקשת כי הלא אין זאת בת אביך. וזה יתכן כיון במלת אך לומר אברהם היתה שרה אשתו ואחותו בת אביו. אך זו הנה אשתך בלבד ולא אחותך בת אביך. ויאמר אליו יצחק כי אמרתי פן אמות ומותר לשקר מאימת מות ע\"ד נשבעים להרגים ולחרמים כו'</p>\n<p>“And the men of the place asked…” - They asked about his wife and not about him, because if they would ask him, he would say, “She is my sister.” That answer comes from fear of death, lest they kill him in order to take her, for they possessed the practice of taking a married woman. Therefore they asked her about her husband, for she would say, “He is my husband,” lest they take her, as that is where her fear lay, and she would not worry that her husband would be killed, for a covenant had been made between Avimelech and her father-in-law (Avraham).</p>\n<p>However, when he (Yitzchak) heard that they were asking her, he did not allow her to answer, lest she say, “He is my husband,” and he would be killed. Therefore he quickly answered in her stead, and he said, “She is my sister.” This was not because he feared Avimelech, for his heart was confident in him because he (Avimelech) had made a covenant with Avraham. He also remembered what had happened with Sarah his mother. What he feared to say was “She is my wife” on account of the men of the place. And this is what is meant by the verse: “lest the men of the place kill me…” And when many days had passed there, Avimelech turned his attention to look into the matter, saying that it was impossible that Yitzchak would be dwelling without a wife for so many days. So he looked out and saw him ‘metzachek’ - which means an act of kissing and embracing. Then he called (Yitzchak)… “Behold, she is indeed your wife!” And he said “however”, to indicate that he had not seen the actual act of intercourse, only something close to it - i.e., the tzchok (playful intimacy) mentioned.</p>\n<p>“And how did you say, ‘She is my sister’?” He did not say, “Why did you say…?” Meaning: he was not accusing him of lying; for just as Avraham had said, ‘She is my sister, the daughter of my father…’, so too here. But you, how could you say ‘She is my sister’? What claim were you intending? For she is certainly not your father’s daughter. And this is the meaning of the word “ach” (“however”), to imply: Avraham’s situation was different, for Sarah was both his wife and also his sister, the daughter of his father. But this one (Rivkah) is only your wife, and not your sister, your father’s daughter. Yitzchak answered him: “For I said, ‘Lest I die.’” And it is permitted to lie out of fear of death, just as we find that oaths are permitted to one who is threatened with being killed or placed under a ban, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Avraham had to speak with Sarah because she would naturally say, “He is my husband,” which would endanger him.</li>\n<li>Rivkah also would naturally say, “He is my husband,” but for a different reason: she feared being taken and did not fear for Yitzchak’s life because of Avimelech’s covenant with Avraham.</li>\n<li>The men of Gerar questioned Rivkah first, intentionally, because they knew Yitzchak would say “my sister.”</li>\n<li>Yitzchak had no chance to brief her beforehand; he overheard them asking her and jumped in.</li>\n<li>He answered for her to prevent her from telling the truth and endangering him.</li>\n<li>Therefore, unlike Avraham, Yitzchak could not rely on Rivkah cooperating, nor did he have time for a discussion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

But practically we don't see that now.</p>\n<p>So why do we include this in our daily prayers?</p>\n<p>You could even argue that saying these verses every day becomes a drawback. It can leave a person thinking there are no consequences at all, because in this case, where the Torah gives a direct warning, we aren’t seeing it play out.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Before we attempt to answer the question let's first understand the simple meaning of the verse. Why indeed do we not see the consequence as is explained in the verse? We have today most Jews in Israel who are not following the Torah. So why is God not expelling them? [Chas Vshalom!]</p>\n<p>If I remember correctly there are some classical commentaries explaining that the direct consequences of our actions are not fully seen and felt these days because the relationship that God had with the Jews during earlier times untill the end of the Holy Temple era was a much closer one in which there was a more cause-and-effect relationship that God has with the Jews.</p>\n<p>The consequences did happen, just as the verse says. The books of Neviim spell it out in full: when the people went off course, there were wars, deaths, tragedies, and expulsions.</p>\n<p>So based on this understanding of the verse we can answer our original question. (This explanation is my own thought, perhaps there are commentaries that agree or disagree, please let me know in the comments.)</p>\n<p>We read the והיה אם שמוע so that we are reminded everyday of the close relationship that we once had with God and to train ourselves to yearn for that close relationship once again.</p>\n<p>It is just like in any relationship between a husband and wife or between two other friends. If a husband acts rude to his wife and his wife doesn't have any reaction at all then you can assume that the relationship is not that great.</p>\n<p>And so we read these verses everyday to remind ourselves of the close relationship that we CAN and SHOULD have with God.</p>\n\n\n",

One linguist, Mordechai Betzalel Schneider, suggested that <em>perhaps</em> the name Datan <em>could</em> stem from the same root.<sup>1</sup> Shmuel Loewenstamm in the <em>Encyclopedia Mikrait</em> entry for \"Datan\" (in Hebrew) followed the opinion of Martin Noth that Datan comes from Akkadian <em>datnu</em>, meaning \"strong\". In short, it's debatable whether there is an actual etymological connection between Datan and Dotan.</p>\n<p>If, indeed, there is some connection between Datan and Dotan, perhaps there was an intent in remembering Reuven's (ultimately failed) attempt to save Yosef at Dotan (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.37.17-22?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet 37:17-22</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.37.29-30?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">29-30</a>).<sup>2</sup> Another possibility that I can think of is that it was a prophetic name: Dotan was the place where the split between the brothers occurred, for it was there where they sold Yosef.

A different, more spiritual explanation was suggested by Rabbi Yisrael Krauss, '<a href=\"https://asif.co.il/wpfb-file/%D7%9E%D7%AA%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%96%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">When was the Techelet Hidden and Why?</a>' (in Hebrew), <em>Vehaya Lachem Letzitzit</em> 12 (5778/2018), pp. 83-87, though it does not contradict the natural processes that led to the gradual disappearance of the techelet (see pp. 85-86).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> See: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma_Buber%2C_Sh%27lach.29.1?vhe=Midrash_Tanhuma_haKadum_veHaYashan,_S._Buber,_1885&qh=%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%AA%20%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma (Buber) Shelach 29:1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Sh%27lach.15.1?vhe=Midrash_Tanchuma_--_Torat_Emet&qh=%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%AA%20%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Shelach 15:1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bamidbar_Rabbah.17.5?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&qh=%D7%A9%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%9C%D7%AA%20%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 17:5</a>, and thought to perhaps be hinted at in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.74b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bavli Bava Batra 74b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sifrei_Devarim.354.7?vhe=Sifre_on_Deuteronomy,_ed._Dr._Louis_Finkelstein._JTS,_1969&qh=%D7%9B%D7%96%D7%99%D7%91%20%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifri Devarim 354:7</a>.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Mordechai Kirshenbaum, 'Seventy Five Years to the Renewal of the Techelet' (in Hebrew), <em>Sinai</em> 53 (5723/1963), p. 161 wrote as much (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"מכאן, שאין כוונת המדרש שנגנזה התכלת ושלא נמצאה כלל, אלא לפי שלא היתה מצויה אצל כלל ישראל בשל יוקרה הרב, ואף קשה היה להשיג אומן בקי ומומחה במלאכת הצביעה, על כן משתמש המדרש בלשון \"נגנז\", כלומר: נשתכח (ראה רש\"י פסחים סב, ב: \"נגנז - נשתכח\"). אבל באמת היה החלזון מצוי, אלא שיכלו להשיגו יחידי סגולה בלבד ובייחוד העשירים והמקורבים למלכות.\"</p>\n<p>\"Therefore, it must be said that the midrash did not mean that the techelet was hidden away and could not be found at all, but rather since it was not found by all of Israel because of its great cost, and since it was also difficult to find an expert craftsman knowledgeable in the art of the dyeing, therefore the midrash used the phrasing \"hidden\", meaning: forgotten (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.62b.15?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Pesachim.62b.15.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Pesachim 62b</a>: \"Hidden - [means] forgotten\").

The Gemara explains the reason for these names: There is a distinction between gold and good gold, as it is written in the verse: “And the gold of that land is good” (Genesis 2:12), which indicates the existence of gold of a higher quality. Gold of Ophir is gold that comes from Ophir. Glistering [mufaz] gold is so named  because it resembles the luster of pearls [paz] in the way it glistens. Shaḥut gold is named as such because it is very malleable and is spun like thread [shenitve keḥut]. Shaḥut is a contraction of the words shenitve keḥut. Closed gold is so called because when a shop opens to sell it, all the other shops close, as no one is interested in purchasing any other type of gold.

    "title": "Should one despair of a potential terrible situation?",
    "content": "# Should one despair of a potential terrible situation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In bGittin 57b the Talmud relates the following tragic story (translation from Sefaria)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל, ואיתימא רבי אמי, ואמרי לה במתניתא תנא: מעשה בארבע מאות ילדים וילדות שנשבו לקלון, הרגישו בעצמן למה הן מתבקשים, אמרו: אם אנו טובעין בים – אנו באין לחיי העולם הבא? דרש להן הגדול שבהן: ״אמר ה׳ מבשן אשיב, אשיב ממצולות ים״ – ״מבשן אשיב״, מבין שיני אריה; ״אשיב ממצולות ים״, אלו שטובעין בים.\n<br />\nRav Yehuda says that Shmuel says, and some say that it was Rabbi Ami who says this, and some say that it was taught in a baraita: There was an incident involving four hundred boys and girls who were taken as captives for the purpose of prostitution. These children sensed on their own what they were expected to do, and they said: If we commit suicide and drown in the sea, will we come to eternal life in the World-to-Come? The oldest child among them expounded the verse: “The Lord said, I will bring back from Bashan, I will bring them back from the depths of the sea” (Psalms 68:23). “I will bring back from Bashan,” i.e., from between the teeth [bein shen] of the lion, and “I will bring them back from the depths of the sea” is referring to those who drown in the sea for the sake of Heaven.\n<br />\nכיון ששמעו ילדות כך, קפצו כולן ונפלו לתוך הים. נשאו ילדים קל וחומר בעצמן, ואמרו: מה הללו, שדרכן לכך – כך; אנו, שאין דרכנו לכך – על אחת כמה וכמה! אף הם קפצו לתוך הים.״.\n<br />When the girls heard this, they all leapt and fell into the sea. The boys then drew an a fortiori inference with regard to themselves and said: If these girls, for whom sexual intercourse with men is their natural way, act in such a manner, then we, for whom sexual intercourse with men is not our natural way, should all the more so conduct ourselves likewise. They too leapt into the sea</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The implication of this story is that this behavior was appropriate, however there is a principle mentioned in bBerachot 10a that a person should not despair of a potential terrible event</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפילו חרב חדה מונחת על צוארו של אדם, אל ימנע עצמו מן הרחמים.\n<br />\nEven if a sharp sword rests upon a person’s neck, he should not prevent himself from praying for mercy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My assumption is that the reason a person should pray for mercy is that even in such a precarious position they can still be saved. This was not the approach of the children in the previous gemara. I would like to know which approach regarding despairing of a potential horrible situation is considered correct (or if both are correct, why that is not a contradiction)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Polytheistic roots of Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am very interested in understanding the historical roots of the God that is universally worshipped today, the one revered by billions across Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. It is understood that idol worship was widespread in ancient Israel. Is the scholarly view correct that one of these earlier deities (or 'idols') was somehow elevated to become the sole God worshipped by much of the world today?</p>\n<p>If so, is it true that other deities, such as Baal (the storm god), were subsequently demoted? In essence, is the religion based on the narrative of how one deity became HaShem?</p>\n<p>Furthermore, I've noted a possible connection between the word Asher (attributed to HaShem) and the goddess Asherah, who was also worshipped. Could you please shed light on these topics and explain the process of how exactly this transformation happened?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Since you asked this on the Judaism SE, I will give a Judaism-based answer. As already noted in the comments, Judaism does not hold that belief in God began with idolatry but the other way around. First there came God who created the universe (and all of reality), as per the first two chapters of Genesis (and mentioned elsewhere in Tanach as well). Then there came the first humans who worshipped God. Some generations later, idolatry began as a perversion of the original belief in God. This process was summarized well by Maimonides in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1.1-2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Laws of Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations</em> 1:1-2</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"During the times of Enosh, mankind made a great mistake, and the wise men of that generation gave thoughtless counsel. Enosh himself was one of those who erred.<br />\nTheir mistake was as follows: They said God created stars and spheres with which to control the world. He placed them on high and treated them with honor, making them servants who minister before Him. Accordingly, it is fitting to praise and glorify them and to treat them with honor. [They perceived] this to be the will of God, blessed be He, that they magnify and honor those whom He magnified and honored, just as a king desires that the servants who stand before him be honored. Indeed, doing so is an expression of honor to the king.<br />\nAfter conceiving of this notion, they began to construct temples to the stars and offer sacrifices to them. They would praise and glorify them with words, and prostrate themselves before them, because by doing so, they would - according to their false conception - be fulfilling the will of God.\nThis was the essence of the worship of false gods, and this was the rationale of those who worshiped them. They would not say that there is no other god except for this star. [...]</p>\n<p>After many years passed, there arose people - false prophets - who told [their nations] that God had commanded them to say: Serve this star - or all the stars - sacrifice to it, offer libations to it, build a temple for it and make an image of it so that all people - including the women, the children, and the common people - could bow to it. [...] In this manner, the people began to make images in temples, under trees, and on the tops of mountains and hills. [...]<br />\nSubsequently, other deceivers arose and declared that a specific star, sphere, or angel had spoken to them and commanded them: Serve me in this manner. He would then relate a mode of service [telling them:] Do this, do not do this.\nThus, these practices spread throughout the world. People would serve images with strange practices - one more distorted than the other - offer sacrifices to them, and bow down to them. As the years passed, [God's] glorious and awesome name was forgotten by the entire population. [...] The Eternal Rock (a title for God) was not recognized or known by anyone in the world, with the exception of a [few] individuals: for example, Chanoch, Metushelach, Noach, Shem, and Ever. The world continued in this fashion until the pillar of the world - the Patriarch Abraham - was born.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maimonides does not clarify how idolatry began again after the flood, given that Noah was a righteous, God-fearing man and presumably directed his three sons to follow in his footsteps. The resurgence of idolatry in the post-deluvian world was discussed by Rabbi Chananyah Elchanan Chai Hakohen in his book <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38431&st=&pgnum=16&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Bamot Ba'al</em></a> on the history of idolatry (from a Jewish perspective, of course) (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"[...] Sin couches at the door and the evil inclination leads others astray and causes them to sin, and it awakens the hearts of men to leave the straight path and to trip them during every generation [...] and immediately upon exiting the Ark, the inclination turned their hearts to this foolishness and to destroy their path [...] for already Ham son of Noah was known around as the man who revealed his father's nakedness and he cohabited in the Ark [...] and undoubtedly he was the first to be guilty of this as well. And as evidence of this we find in books of mythology that the nation most greatly awash in the vice of idolatry after the spreading out of the nations was the land of Egypt [...] and undoubtedly after the flood its masters were strengthened in their conviction, after seeing that the sun intensified after the flood more than it had been before, as <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44711&st=&pgnum=18&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">stated</a> by Rabbi Shem Tov ben Shem Tov.\"<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This indicates that post-deluvian idolatry first began with sun worship, which led to the worship of other planets and stars, and that led to the worship of all other false deities. Some of these perversions, as indicated by both Tanach, later Jewish sources and archeology, included mixing forms of the worship of the One True God with idolatrous notions. For example, the golden calf in the wilderness and later the two golden calves in the Kingdom of Israel (the so-called \"Northern Kingdom\"), or the \"Y. and (his?) Asherah\" found in a couple of sites. Neither reflect the original form of worship of God. They are mutilations of the original modes of worship.</p>\n<p>The scholarly argument is highly speculative. It is based on several assumptions, one being that monotheism developed from earlier more primitive religions, e.g. Animism. There is no concrete evidence for this. Another is that archeological findings represent the everything and all (never mind that archeology isn't a hard science [I typically avoid calling it a science at all] and that archeological conclusions are disproven fairly often, as new sites are excavated, new artifacts uncovered and new studies produced. I say this as an archeology doctoral student, who has also worked in the field a bit). A third assumption is that Tanach is solely the work of a significantly later very specific sect of priests and/or affiliated individuals who were essentially part of a conspiracy to hide the supposed polytheistic origins of the faith of Israel, but were pretty incompetent at it (given that modern scholars have been able to \"rediscover\" these so-called origins). Once again, none of these theories have any actual hard evidence.</p>\n<p>So, in essence, Judaism is not about one deity becoming \"The Deity\", because He Was and Is and Will Always Be the One God. It is about people who stay true to the One God and do their part in fixing the world - one of its main problems being people who have been led astray from the path of the One God and must be guided back.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> According to Rabbi Avraham Ibn Ezra (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.9.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.9.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Genesis 9:14</a>), the appearance of the rainbow only after the flood, despite being a natural occurrence, should be understood as an after-effect of the sun becoming stronger after the flood. The gist of this idea, according to Rabbi Chananyah, is that while all forces of nature were essentially rebooted during the flood, the sun was the only body to not be rebooted but rather to receive an upgrade. This led Ham and his sons to conclude that the sun was a mighty entity that should be worshipped.</p>\n\n\n",

Chassidut is based heavily on Kabbalah, and therefore it most likely falls under a \"bashamayim hi\" lomdus.

We don't argue it and innovate with it.</p>\n<p>Does that mean that one should seek a different type of Chavruta when learning Kabbalah? I've noticed something when I learn Chassidut with two people, my best friend and my wife. Both of them, are \"on my side\"; they love me, and they don't feel the slightest drop of competitiveness or disrespect with me, and visa versa - there's no jealousy at all when one of us figures something out that the other missed. We just celebrate each other's achievement and are glad to understand things better.</p>\n<p>Unlike when I learn Gemara, I find that this method of learning Chassidut is GREAT. I absorb and understand my learning literally 10-100 times better when going through it with them.</p>\n<p>I just want to know, is there an official source that actually says that when it comes to learning Chassidut b'chavruta, one should do so in a non-adversarial approach?

Why? What do the two situations have in common that warrants an oath?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It is essential to comprehend the role and significance of oaths within Judaism in order to address this question with scholarly completeness. According to the Aderet Eliyahu (Rabbi Yosef Chaim), an oath may be construed as a form of spiritual \"binding\" or \"commitment\" that imparts an additional stratum of accountability and gravity to an individual's actions.\nOne might therefore posit that in both instances under consideration, an oath was administered so as to underscore the solemnity and importance of the respective undertaking. Both the selection of a wife for Isaac and the burial of Jacob in Canaan constituted tasks of paramount significance and spiritual importance, necessitating such supplementary binding.\nFurthermore, one might draw attention to the symbolism inherent in these oaths, both of which pertain to the connection with the land of Canaan. This could suggest that the oaths likewise represent an emphasis upon the significance of the Land of Israel within Judaism.\nThe question presents an analysis of two situations in which an oath was administered. The oath appears to constitute a significant component of the interaction between the characters and raises questions concerning the meaning and purpose of the oath.\nThe halakhic principles in this matter concern the use and significance of oaths in the Torah. Oaths are frequently employed in the Torah to reinforce obligations or to emphasize the gravity of a statement or promise.\nIn Genesis 24:2, Abraham causes Eliezer to swear an oath to ensure that he does not procure a wife for Isaac from among the Canaanites. In Genesis 47:29, Jacob causes Joseph to swear an oath to ensure that he is buried in the Land of Israel rather than in Egypt.\nIn the Gemara (Nedarim 2a), there is discussion of how oaths may be taken and annulled. In the Gemara (Shevuot 36b), it is explained that it is forbidden to take an oath unnecessarily.\nThe Rishonim and Acharonim discuss the use of oaths in various contexts. The Rambam (Hilkhot Shevuot 2:1) explicates that an oath serves to confirm the veracity of a statement or to obligate a person to perform an action.\nA potential objection might be that oaths in the Torah are not invariably employed in an identical manner, and that the specific contexts of the two aforementioned cases might highlight different aspects of the use of oaths.\nThe majority opinion appears to be that oaths in the Torah serve to obligate a person to perform an action or to emphasize the gravity of a statement.\nA minority opinion might propose that oaths in the Torah may also possess symbolic or ritual functions that transcend their juridical function.\nIt is important to distinguish between different types of oaths in the Torah and their various functions and meanings in different contexts.\nUpon weighing the arguments, it appears that oaths in the Torah serve to obligate a person to perform an action or to emphasize the gravity of a statement. This appears to hold true in both of the aforementioned cases.\nIt is observed that the common denominator between the two situations under discussion lies in the employment of the oath. This functions as a means of emphasizing the significance of the obligation and underscoring the gravity of the respective situation.\nIn the Talmud, the significance of the oath and its function as an emphasis upon the binding nature and gravity of an obligation is highlighted (Shevuot 36b). An oath serves not merely to confirm the veracity of a statement, but also to emphasize the gravity of a situation or task.\nThe gravity of the oath is made manifest in Judaism by the fact that the abuse of an oath is regarded as a most serious transgression. From this one may deduce that the significance of the oath in Jewish ethics and Jewish law ought not to be underestimated.</p>\n\n\n",

Likewise, if someone used the wrong method of kinyan for a certain circumstance. it also doesn't count. See Talmud Baba Metziah 2b.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>If an object is properly acquired by someone, it stays put in their ownership forever; unless the owner allows a new person to take it from them via a new valid kinyan act; or the owner abandons the item, making it ownerless (\"Hefker\").</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Therefore, the OP's suggestion that a physical event be enough to declare that an object has moved out from the ownership domain of person A to that of person B or to a zone called (Hefker) \"ownerless\", is impossible in the Torah system. This impossibility was suggested by the OP with the term: \"the objective reality of the situation\".</p>\n<p>There is no \"objective reality of the situation\" that can transfer ownership away from an owner. Rather, the object remains always attached to you once you own it. This is true even if an atomic bomb blew the item into the next country. It still belongs to you until a proper freewill kinyan is performed transferring the object.</p>\n<p>Such Kinyanim (when done with intent to transfer ownership) are listed in the Talmud and sourced in the Torah. Examples: Handing an item to your friend, picking up an item high enough into the air, leading away a horse or cow, digging a hole on a piece of real estate, paying money, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>An exception* to this rule is that of the \"lost object\" which can transfer out of the ownership of a person and into Hefker status if the owner gives up hope with legal free will. (\"yeush\")</p>\n<p>*(Other exceptions to the pure Kinyan system are a sister in law whose husband dies childless, instantly being acquired by the surviving brother as a wife; and the money of inheritance transferring instantly from the father to the son without any freewill act of kinyan, upon the father passing away.)</p>\n<p>The Torah recognizes that if a person realizes that reality most likely will have destroyed the item or kept it forever away from him, then he will stop wasting his time over it and allow it to become Hefker.</p>\n<p>When does this not work? It doesn't work with children. A minor cannot \"realize legally\" to have \"yeush\" and give up on ever finding the object again. The minor therefore keeps the object wherever it is. No one can take it regardless of the \"reality of the situation\" because a minor cannot legally decide to give up.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/113561/what-is-the-law-regarding-the-aveidah-of-a-katan-lost-object-of-a-minor\">See the link again from above</a></p>\n<p>The Halacha of the minor proves that we are not talking about an event of reality triggering the lost object going to Hefker (or else a minor's object would also be Hefker.) Rather it depends on an adult's legal mind to abandon hope of return; albeit coupled with a difficult reality situation like a river washing away the object.</p>\n<p>This entire secret is hinted in the extra wording of the verse we quoted at the beginning above.</p>\n<p>...and so shall you do with any lost article of your brother <strong>which he has lost and you have found.</strong></p>\n<p>The bolded words seem to be extra. The first two verses clearly describe a loss and find before we get to verse #3</p>\n<p><strong>Which he has lost</strong> ... refers to the fact that he cannot find it.</p>\n<p>BUT</p>\n<p>... <strong>and you have found</strong>. means that he knows other responsible people can in fact find it so there is nothing to give up on yet!</p>\n<p>However, if he lost it and you can also not normally find it, then it seems very lost indeed to the point that normal people now give up on finding it.</p>\n<p>In that case the Torah allows the object to move out of the person's ownership into Hefker as a lost object the finder may keep.</p>\n<p>The extra words in the Torah are emphasizing an attitude, not just the situation in reality. (already explained by verse 1-2)</p>\n<p>(That is the D'rashah from the Yerushalmi mentioned by the OP.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tosfos Bava Kammah 66a ד\"ה מוצא אבידה and Tosfos Bava Metziah 27a ד\"ה מה שמלה, writes that the source is from the word \"שמלה\", the Chachamim derived that the obligation to return a lost object is only when the owner can identify his object-\"Siman\" and therefore is demanding- requesting its return, but if the owner gives up,and is not demanding its return, then the finder make keep the object.\nמה שמלה מיוחדת שיש שיש בה סימנים ויש לה תובעין</p>\n\n\n",

Since Avraham had a Yishmael and Yitzchak had an Eisav, it could not be said about them that their sons also kept Shabbos. However, Yaakov had twelve sons who were צדיקים, so we say יעקב <strong>ובניו</strong> ינוחו בו.</li>\n<li>If Yishmael did Teshuvah, that means that he would've kept Shabbos with Avraham, Sarah, and Yitzchok. Then, why don't we say אברהם ובניו יגל, if indeed, Yishmael did Teshuvah?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Indeed, Ishmael made <em>teshuvah</em> during the life of Avraham, so that he meritted to burry Avraham together with Yitzchak, as we find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.9?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 25:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite, facing Mamre,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ISAAC AND ISHMAEL — From this we gather that Ishmael repented of his evil ways (cf.Bava Batra 16b) and yielded the precedence to Isaac. This is what is meant by the “good old age” mentioned in connection with Abraham (Genesis Rabbah 38:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the same time, after the death of Avraham, the Torah says, about Ishmael and his descendands, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.25.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 25:18</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They dwelt from Havilah, by Shur, which is close to Egypt, all the way to Asshur; <em>they camped (literally, he fell) alongside all their kin/brothers</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There Rashi notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נפל (literally, he fell) means \"he dwelt\", as (Judges 7:12) “Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all children of the East dwelt (נופלים) in the valley.” Here it says “He fell” and there (16:12) it says “In the presence of all his brethren shall he dwell”. But it may be explained thus: before Abraham died it could be said “He would dwell in security: after he died, “he fell” (Genesis Rabbah 62:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Midrash Rabba, Rashi's source, states this even harsher:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[nafal, literally, fell down], but elsewhere it says [of Ishmael]: “He will dwell [yishkon] [among all his brethren]” (Genesis 16:12). The explanation is that all the days our patriarch Abraham was alive – yishkon. When our patriarch Abraham died – nafal. Before - he did not extend his hand against the Temple – <em>yishkon</em> (he dwelled); once he extended his hand against it (see  Psalms 83:3–19) – <em>nafal</em> (He fell in stature.). In this world – <em>yishkon</em>; but in the future – <em>nafal</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The midrash indicates that Ishmael returned to his evil ways after the death of Avraham, which resulted in his falling in statue.</p>\n<p>Additionally, one can learn the same idea from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.17?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Bereshis 21:17</a> based on Eicha Rabba 2:4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>באשר הוא שם WHERE HE IS — According to the actions he is now doing shall he be judged and not according to what he may do in future. Because the ministering angels laid information against him, saying, “Master of the Universe, for him whose descendants will at one time kill your children with thirst will You provide a well?” He asked them, “What is he now, righteous or wicked?” They replied to him, “Righteous.” He said to them, “According to his present deeds will I judge him.” This is the meaning of what is written: “[For God hath heard the voice of the lad ] באשר הוא שם in that condition in which he now is” (Genesis Rabbah 53:14). Where did he (Ishmael) kill Israel with thirst? When Nebuchadnezzar carried them into exile — as it is said, (Isaiah 21:13, 14) “The burden upon Arabia … O ye caravans of Dedanites, unto him that is thirsty bring ye water! etc.” When they were bringing them near the Arabians the Israelites said to their captors, “We beg of you bring us to the children of our uncle, Ishmael, who will certainly show pity to us”, as it is said, “O ye caravans of the Dedanites (דדנים)”; read not דדנים but דודים, kinsmen. — These indeed came to them bringing them salted meat and fish and water-skins inflated with air. The Israelites believed that these were full of water and when they placed them in their mouths, after having opened them, the air entered their bodies and they died (Eichah Rabbah 2:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The fact that the ministering angels referred to Ishmael himself, and not to his descendands directly, implies that the problem started with Ishmael and he had not fixed it in the last part of his life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A) It’s actually debated whether the Avot kept the mitzvot or not. According to several opinions, even Avraham didn’t keep Shabbat.</p>\n<p>B) Even assuming the Avot kept the mitzvot, Yishmāʿēl wasn’t one of the Avot. He was never part of our nation, so even after repenting and becoming righteous, there was no reason for him to keep Shabbat.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it disrespectful to today's Jews to wear a cross and star of David necklace?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am not a Jew through Jewish law, my grandfather on my dad's side was a full Jew and I am a newer Christian. I do, however, feel very connected to Judaism and I'm a strong supporter of Israel. Anyway, I was wondering if it would be disrespectful to wear a Magen David and cross necklace to show my support of Israel and Judaism? I understand how it could be seen as offensive and I have no wish to be.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From a purely ethical standpoint there's nothing wrong with wearing the two as historically speaking the six sided star only recently \"became\" the Star of David. The six pointed star has existed in ancient Babylonian and Mesopotamian cultures, and was very prominently used by Muslims who would even adorn their Mosques with it and called it the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seal_of_Solomon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seal of Solomon</a>. They claimed it was the symbol on Solomons ring which he used to enslave or capture demons. Which also explains why Wiccans still use this symbol for their witchcraft. The symbol has also been used in flags of countries such as Nigeria whom are not Jewish.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJH9LWqA.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oJH9LWqA.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E43TW6YZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/E43TW6YZ.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrG8BEa0.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yrG8BEa0.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>But the six pointed star has mostly been abandoned by other cultures and Jews have repurposed the six sided star and claimed it as a symbol of David. And so in our modern world the symbol is mostly associated with Jews and Judaism. And so when it comes to modern cultural understanding I would offer you the following question:</p>\n<p>As a Christian, how would you feel if a Muslim wore a cross with a Crescent and Moon and told you that they are a very proud Muslim who also supports Christians.</p>\n<p>I think you would come to the opinion that some Christians would be okay with this, but probably most wouldn't. And most wouldn't because it doesn't feel great to have someone who believes that their religion replaces yours to be wearing \"your symbol\" alongside their symbol which replaces yours.</p>\n<p>What I would recommend instead is JUST to wear a star of David like the great Louis Armstrong used to do. He was Christian, and those who knew him knew he was Christian, but his support for Jews meant he would wear a star of David out of respect for Jews, and not wear a cross with it. If you would have asked Louis why he wore the star of david he would tell you about the Jewish family who helped raise him as a small child, helped him buy his first trumpet, and would show up to his shows even into adulthood. By wearing a star of david you can tell anyone, Jewish or not Jewish that you support the Jewish people, that it's part of your family history. Instead of saying you are such a big Christian that you also support Judaism</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Wxm7eATw.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Wxm7eATw.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Jewish star isn't a holy symbol nor is it necessarily exclusively owned by Jews. Anyone is free to use symbols as they want to. More importantly than what jewelry a person wears is understanding it would be inappropriate to proselyte Christianity to Jews. This of course isn't directly related but is important to keep in mind.</p>\n\n\n",

I didn't want to lie, and \"I'll tell you later\" would be a lie, and so would saying anything false, so I just told him the truth. Looking back, I wonder if there was another way around this. I don't know much about Halacha or Jewish philosophy, so I wasn't able to site much, but another reason I shouldn't say \"I'll tell you later\" might be because it would be <em>genevat zman</em>, stealing his time. He might spend time thinking about this thing I would \"tell him later\", even worrying about it, just to have me not tell him. Though really is that even my fault if he does that?</p>\n<p>Okay anyway thank you everyone <3</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, there does exist a concept of \"joining\" two mitzvot (many have the custom to burn their lulav with their chametz on Erev Pesach).</p>\n<p>Is it permissible to use the Havdalah candle as the shamash to light Chanukah candles?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R Yaakov Goldstein (<a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/may-a-havdalah-candle-be-used-for-the-shamash/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) rules one can use the Havdala candle as shamash arguing that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the entire reason for lighting a shamash is to ensure that one does\nnot make use of the other candles and to make it recognizable that the\nother candles were lit for the sake of a mitzvah. <strong>Accordingly, not\nonly should it be permitted to use a torch [havdala candle] for the shamash, but on the\ncontrary, it could even be considered preferable.</strong> By doing so, you\nmake a clear distinction between the candles of obligation and the\nshamash.

This is prayer.\nThe number of prayers is not prescribed in the Torah, nor does it prescribe a specific formula for prayer. Also, according to Torah law, there are no fixed times for prayers.</p>\n<p>...</p>\n<p>4 When Israel was exiled in the time of the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, they became interspersed in Persia and Greece and other nations. Children were born to them in these foreign countries and those children's language was confused.\nThe speech of each and every one was a concoction of many tongues. No one was able to express himself coherently in any one language, but rather in a mixture [of languages], as [Nehemiah 13:24] states: \"And their children spoke half in Ashdodit and did not know how to speak the Jewish language. Rather, [they would speak] according to the language of various other peoples.\"\nConsequently, when someone would pray, he would be limited in his ability to request his needs or to praise the Holy One, blessed be He, in Hebrew, unless other languages were mixed in with it. <strong>When Ezra and his court saw this, they established eighteen blessings in sequence.\nThe first three [blessings] are praises of God and the last three are thanksgiving. The intermediate [blessings] contain requests for all those things that serve as general categories for the desires of each and every person and the needs of the whole community.</strong>\nThus, the prayers could be set in the mouths of everyone. They could learn them quickly and the prayers of those unable to express themselves would be as complete as the prayers of the most eloquent. It was because of this matter that they established all the blessings and prayers so that they would be ordered in the mouths of all Israel, so that each blessing would be set in the mouth of each person unable to express himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to Rambam, the method by which we are mandated (rabinically) to fulfill the biblical command to pray is precisely by reciting the <em>amidah</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

We know from Tanach that the original name of Chevron was Kiryat Arba (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.23.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beresheet 23:2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.14.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yehoshua 14:15</a>, etc.). I think the Israelites renamed Kiryat Arba in honor of Efron's willingness to sell the Machpelah Cave to Avraham. The form Chevron was favored rather than Efron because it contains the root חבר (friend), to symbolize the hand of friendship Efron extended toward Avraham.<sup>1</sup> We similarly find that the city of Shomron, which was bought by Omri and turned into Israel's capital, was named after its original owner, Shemer (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.16.24?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Melachim 1:16:24</a>).</p>\n<p>Linguist <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%96%D7%99%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9C\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Dr. Moshe Zaidel</a> (חקרי לשון, pp. 41-42, can be found on Otzar Hachochmah) proposed something similar, that Efron should be identified with Arba, the patriarch of the giants of Kiryat Arba (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.14.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA%20%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yehoshua 14:15</a>; per <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.1.28?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Targum_Jonathan_on_Deuteronomy.1.28&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Targum Pseudo-Yonatan on Devarim 1:28</a>), with the root of Arba, רבע, being contained in Efron, again with the letter-switch. The Israelites renamed Kiryat Arba after Efron, but it was easier for them to pronounce the form Chevron, so that's what they used.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Following this reasoning, it also occurred to me that Efron's father's name, Tzochar (צחר), also contains a ח, which can be switched with an ע, which would form Tzo'ar (צער). This might mean that Efron was originally from Tzo'ar, a place also connected to Avraham's story - it was one of the Jordan plain cities saved by Avraham (when it was still named Belah), and Lot eventually escaped there following the destruction of Sodom and the other cities. Perhaps this background also explains Efron's decision to agree to sell the cave, perhaps as thanks to Avraham. I've written about the topic of Efron's name more in detail in a couple of blog posts (<a href=\"https://tanachthoughts.blogspot.com/2024/10/efron-and-chevron.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://tanachthoughts.blogspot.com/2024/10/further-thoughts-on-efron-and-chevron.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>עפרן (as spelled uniquely in the verse when he is paid) is 400 in Gematria, equal to the amount he took (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Ba%27al_HaTurim_on_Genesis.23.16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baal Haturim</a>).\nIt is also the Gematria of רע עין, or stingy.

Lau. Or. 104 (<a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990001478900205171-1,FL161721447%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both have this comment in the same location.</p>\n<p>I then checked a few supercommentaries on Ibn Ezra. The only reference to this issue (albeit not entirely explicit) that I found (though there may be others, especially supercommentaries that haven't been printed) is Da'at Ezra by Rabbi Nechemiah Sheinfeld (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah), who wrote between Ibn Ezra's comment on the letter Mem in אמנם and the \"problematic\" commentary on the three visitors (p. 230):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"עתה חוזר רבינו לשאלה שעסק בה בתחילת הפרשה: מי היו שלושת האנשים.\"</p>\n<p>\"Now our rabbi returns to the question which he had been examining in the beginning of the parsha: Who were these three men.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, yes, technically this comment should have been at the start of the parsha. But, apparently, the Ibn Ezra went into a kind of \"tangent\" (so to speak) in clarifying the first verses of the parsha, and then went back to the first issue he had been dealing with (in the second verse of the parsha), which is the identity of the three visitors.</p>\n\n\n",

However, Lot, whose strength was weak — meaning, he was not accustomed to prophecy, therefore they appeared to him as angels.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, this refers not to physical strength, but to spiritual capacity. Avraham, being accustomed to prophetic revelation (“מראות אלהים”), had a high level of spiritual perception. As such, when angels came to him, their presence did not appear extraordinary — they seemed to him like human beings. Lot, on the other hand, lacked this prophetic refinement (“שלא היה רגיל בנבואה”), so the angels appeared to him in their more awe-inspiring, celestial form — “כמלאכים.”</p>\n<p>Also note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.50.2?lang=bi&p2=Perush_Maharzu_on_Bereshit_Rabbah.50.2.6&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peirush Maharzu</a> there that builds on this concept and adds further points worth noting.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהיה כחו יפה. להשגת מראות אלהים וכמ\"ש ר\"פ כ\"ז גדול כח הנביאים שמדמים הצורה ליוצרה. וכ\"ש למלאכים. משא\"כ לוט. וכמ\"ש במנוח מות נמות כי אלהים ראינו. או שהיה כחו יפה במע\"ט כמ\"ש פ' ל\"א סי' י'</p>\n<p>‘Whose strength was great’ — refers to his capacity to perceive Divine visions. As it is stated earlier (at the beginning of chapter 27): ‘Great is the power of the prophets, for they liken the Form to its Creator’, and all the more so, they can perceive angels without awe. This was not the case with Lot, as it is written regarding Manoach: ‘We shall surely die, for we have seen a divine being’ (Judges 13:22). Alternatively, ‘his strength was great’ refers to his excellence in good deeds, as stated above (chapter 31, section 10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Peirsh Maharzu offers two points:</p>\n<p>The Maharzu offers two interpretations of the phrase “שהיה כחו יפה” (“whose strength was great”):</p>\n<p>Prophetic strength:\n(Like the Eitz Yosef) Avraham possessed a powerful prophetic faculty — he could perceive even Divine visions (מראות אלהים) without fear. The Maharzu cites an earlier Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.27.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 27:1</a>): “Great is the power of the prophets, for they liken the Form (the Divine appearance) to its Creator.” Since prophets can behold the Divine itself, it follows even more so that they can behold angels without being overwhelmed. Lot, however, lacked this spiritual strength, and therefore was awed by the angels — similar to Manoach in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.13.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 13:22</a>, who feared death upon seeing an angel (“We will surely die, for we have seen a divine being”).</p>\n<p>Moral strength:\nAlternatively, the phrase may refer not to prophetic ability but to strength in good deeds (מעשים טובים), as discussed earlier in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.31.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 31:10</a> - (I'm not sure about this source - it doesn't bring out this point - unless Sefaria has different segmentation of the Midrash?).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# \"Harmless\" pranks - does such a thing exist? Is it good or bad?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a genre of pranks that are considered \"harmless\". The definition varies, but generally speaking, the rough definition can be \"a prank that ends up with the victim laughing, having enjoyed the experience\". I suspect that the Torah would consider all pranks some form of harm, even harmless ones, as they at absolute best involve a little bit of <em>genevat da'at</em>, and <em>genevat zman</em>. Also, not everyone is going to laugh, especially if the victim is having a very bad day.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, maybe I am being too \"strict\" and maybe the potential laughter at the end is worth it as <em>simcha</em> can be really important! It would be interesting to know what halachic principles really do apply to pranks, and if they can all be extended to the most harmless of pranks. Or, is this all just \"<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/85062/5th-part-of-the-shulchan-aruch\">fifth book of Shulchan Aruch</a>\"-grade questioning?</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of pranks that are generally considered \"harmless\":</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Blowing bubbles into the air when someone is not looking and when they wonder where the bubbles came from, act like you are as clueless as them - leading them to think there are random bubbles floating around.</li>\n<li>Asking someone a question for directions to a non-existent place, the joke being the name of the place is actually really silly/funny and obviously not real, but the delivery was done so well that the person initially thought they misheard.</li>\n<li>Take a copy of your friend's desk photo, reproduce it but photoshop in Uncle Moishy's face over your friend's, and put that into the photo frame (over the original) when he is not looking, and see how long it takes him to notice (someone did this to a Rabbi of mine once in Yeshiva).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Nobody gets hurt, or scared, or (hopefully) embarrassed.

    "content": "# Deeper meaning of \"field of knives\" being harvested with the \"horn of a donkey\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/torah-texts/5463513/The-Talmud/Bechorot/Chapter-1/8b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechoros</a> brings a debate between Rabbi Yehoshua and the wise men of Athens, where they asked different riddles to test his wisdom</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משרא דסכיני במאי קטלי בקרנא דחמרא ומי איכא קרנא לחמרא ומי איכא משרא\nדסכיני</p>\n<p>They asked him another question: With what does one harvest a field of\nknives? Rabbi Yehoshua answered: With the horn of a donkey. They said\nto him: But is there such an item as a horn of a donkey? He said to\nthem: But is there such a thing as a field of knives?</p>\n<p>משרא דסכיני במאי קטלי ליה ערוגה דסכיני במה קוצרין אותה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The simple meaning is obvious: a ridiculous/nonsensical question deserves a ridiculous answer, a question without a premise can be dismissed without a premise.</p>\n<p>But I've heard that all of the questions they asked are really deep philosophical debates of perspective that even continue to the modern day.</p>\n<p>For example another question they asked earlier was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מילחא כי סריא במאי מלחי לה אמר להו בסילתא דכודניתא ומי איכא סילתא\nלכודנתא ומילחא מי סרי</p>\n<p>The sages of Athens then asked another question: When salt is\nspoiling, with what does one salt it to preserve it? Rabbi Yehoshua\nsaid to them: With the placenta of a mule. They said to him: But is\nthere a placenta of a mule? Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: And does salt\nspoil?</p>\n<p>סיליתא שיליא:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similar idea but I <a href=\"https://www.theyeshiva.net/jewish/item/6011/essay-simchas-torah-shavuos-the-mule-the-salt-the-secret-of-torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">heard</a> that by \"salt\" they were referring to the Torah, which was meant to preserve the Jewish ppl. And the greeks were claiming that in the new \"progressive\" Greek era, the Torah that said was getting old and spoiled.</p>\n<p>Then the answer of \"placenta of a mule\", a mule is a combination of a horse and a donkey, two seemingly strong animals, which should have the advantages of both, implying maybe one can mix the Torah around with Greek culture to keep it modern</p>\n<p>But \"do mules have placenta?\", if one tries to mix the Torah with other things to try to get the best of both, it won't actually reproduce and continue. To which he answered \"does salt spoil?\", that the Torah never gets old, because it's totally beyond time and eternally relevant.</p>\n<p>Based on this similar way of thinking, what is the deeper metaphorical meaning of the field of knives?</p>\n<p>I've heard bits and pieces but not sure exactly what the full explanation is, based on what I think I understand from it so far I think it might mean something about a field representing life and growth with knives representing destruction , and the \"field of knives\" the greeks were asking how can the Jewish ppl hope to \"harvest\" and thrive in the exile, a place of destruction, to which he answered \"the horn of a donkey\", a non existent instrument implying that the survival of the Jewish ppl is really from a place that's beyond understanding, similar to a donkey which represents bittul, self nullification to Hashem, within the chomer (physicality) of the physical world, reaching a place beyond the world and beyond \"existence\" as we understand it, especially through the hope and yearning, while in exile, for moshiach who will arrive on a donkey.</p>\n<p>But the the answer?

I would like to know where this custom comes from and the meaning or symbolism it conveys.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Partial answer:</p>\n<p>Various sources, like the link you brought, mention this custom but find no source for it. However, a similar custom by Libyan Jews was recounted by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahum_Slouschz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nachum Slouschz</a> in his book ספר המסעות, vol. 2, p. 104 (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...בני משפחה שמתו שנים מבניה בשנה אחת ויש לחשוש שמא ימות גם בן שלישי...מיד בשובם מן הקבורה הם נועצים מסמר בדלת - שזוהי סגולה בדוקה כדי שמלאך המות יפסח עליה ויעבור.\"</p>\n<p>\"Members of a family of which two sons died in one year and there's a fear that a third may die...immediately upon returning from the funeral stick a nail into the door - a tried-and-tested charm (<em>segulah</em>) to ascertain that the Angel of Death will pass over that [door] and continue on.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I doubt that Chabad received this custom from Libyan Jews, in my research of Jewish segulot and kemeot (amulets), I found that on occasion nails were used, for various types of charms and amulets. Sometimes they were inscribed with special words or names, and often as part of the ritual they were banged into a door or another object. So it seems that Jews in various communities had such similar customs. I don't recall any specifically like the custom recounted by Slouschz, but then again, I read perhaps thousands in recent months and don't have perfect memory. If I come across an Ashkenazic segulah formula that is intended to defend from death and involves nails, I'll edit that in.</p>\n<p>The usage of nails as amulets is ancient. Already <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Shabbat.6.10?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&qh=%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Shabbat 6:10</a> mentions a custom of using a nail from a crucifixion as an amulet (the Bavli <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.67a.12?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">clarifies</a> that it was used for healing sicknesses). The custom, as the gemara itself <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.67a.14?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">indicates</a>, is of non-Jewish origin, but finds leniency in halacha because it is intended for healing. The medieval usage of nails probably developed from this older custom, and the Libyan custom most likely developed from that, and perhaps the Chabad custom as well.</p>\n<p>Another possible reason for the Chabad custom was suggested in the book <em>Mourning & Mitzvah: A Guided Journal for Walking the Mourner's Path through Grief to Healing</em> by Anne Brener, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=Yig9ECkFbYIC&pg=PA104&dq=%22nail%22%20%22mourning%22&hl=en&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwipr6jB-tyQAxWPTkEAHd9SOggQ6AF6BAgIEAM#v=onepage&q=%22nail%22%20%22mourning%22&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 104</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In some Jewish communities, for example, <em>shiva</em> is ended by hammering a nail into a wooden board. This rich image acknowledges that it is time to end the period of numbness and withdrawal and begin to face the reality of loss. The loud rap of the hammer is a sensory alarm clock. It wakes up the mourner and penetrates the layers of his or her withdrawal, just as the nail penetrates the board.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Upon further research, but without a source, there is an example of placing a nail into a hard surface as a sort of remembrance that a significant event took place at that spot.</p>\n<p>This idea is found in Yerushalmi Chagigah 3:1 wherein, after intercalculating the year in the valley of Rimmon, the following statement was made</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אתיי מיזל לון אמרין\nאתון נחוי עובדינן. והוה תמן חד כיף דשייש והוה כל חד וחד נסיב חד מסמר וקבע ליה בגויה והוא נחת ושקע כהדין ליישא. עד כדון מיתקרי כיפא מסמרא. <br />\nWhen they were leaving they said, come and let us record our act. A rock of marble was there. Each of them took a nail and fixed it in it; it descended and sank in as in dough. Until now it is called the rock of nails.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps this is the source for this custom, as a reminder of the significance of the mourning which was completed there</p>\n\n\n",

Also, it's perhaps similar to the Rashi in Beresheit 1:22 who writes that the animals were in need of a bracha as well, but Hashem did not bless them, in order that the snake not be might not be included in the blessing, and therefore it comes out that many animals have reproductive suffering in their natural biology because of the lack of the bracha of pru urvu as well.

    "content": "# Repentance vs Intercession\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know (from grok) that The Eleh Ezkerah is a powerful liturgical text that recounts the martyrdom of ten sages, framing their deaths as a Kiddush Hashem with atoning significance for the Jewish people. Its poetic narrative, celestial dialogue, and concluding plea for mercy underscore the themes of sacrifice, righteousness, and communal redemption central to Yom Kippur. By invoking the martyrs’ merit, the text bridges historical suffering with the present-day pursuit of atonement.</p>\n<p>If God forgives people for the dying of a righteous person/persons why there is Repentance? is not Repentance alone enough? How do Jews balance between Repentance and Intercession?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The answer is that Repentance alone still leaves behind an aftereffect of the sin, which still needs to be purified. As explained in the classic work \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27arei_Teshuvah.1.9?ven=hebrew%7CSefaria_Vocalized_Edition&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gates of Repentance</a>\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And behold that there are many levels of repentance. It is true that you will find forgiveness for any repentance. However the soul will only find complete purification - to be as if the iniquities never had been - when a person purifies his heart and prepares his spirit, as will be explained. And so is it written (Psalms 32:2), \"Happy is the man whom the Lord does not hold guilty, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.\" And it is like the matter of a garment that needs washing: For a little washing will be effective to remove its soiling. However, it will [only] whiten according to the amount of washing. And so is it written there (Psalms 51:4), \"Wash me thoroughly of my iniquity.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact the entire <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27arei_Teshuvah.4.1?ven=hebrew%7CSefaria_Vocalized_Edition&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fourth part</a> of the work focuses on this topic. It begins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the same way as the body has sicknesses and ailments, so too does the soul. And the ailments of the soul and its diseases are its evil traits and its sins. But when an evildoer repents from his evil path, God, may He be blessed, heals the soul of the sinner - as it is stated (Psalms 41:5), “O Lord, have mercy on me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against You.” And it is [also] stated (Isaiah 6:10), “and repent and save itself.” And in the way that it is sometimes found with the sicknesses of the body that the sickness lightens itself from upon one, as does the length of most of the ailments, but the body is not cleansed of it without drinking a bitter drink and suffering further by afflicting his soul from [eating] all desirable food; so too is it with the soul sick from great iniquity: And even though most of the sickness is healed, and most parts of the punishment are removed after the repentance - and God, may He be blessed, has gone away from His anger - the soul will not yet be cleansed from the sickness and its sin will not be atoned until the sinner is made to suffer with afflictions, purified with pain and with bad and difficult things that happen to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in the prayer Eleh Ezkerah and many others like it we beseech G-d to recognize our suffering and count it towards our full atonement.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it halachically valid to rebuild the Beit HaMikdash if we have doubts about the line of Kohanim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Kohanim managed the day to day responsibilities of the temple and their line was preserved and protected through stringent practice.</p>\n<p>But since the exile - <em>while I do trust the community has managed to maintain the validity of Kohanim lines</em> - we don't have the same \"guarantee\" that our ancestors did when it came to the Kohanim of ancient Israel. The fact we all lived in one place and could manage those issues prevented doubt. Galut changed all of that as while we still have Kohanim, all documentation and facts stop beyond a specific point. No Kohan alive today (as far as I know) can truly validate their line that far back.</p>\n<p><strong>This leads to my question.</strong></p>\n<p>There are groups which wish to rebuild the Beit HaMikdash. They believe it is the responsibility of the Jewish people to restart temple processes in an effort to more fully connect with God and redeem Klal Yisrael.</p>\n<p>While I fully endorse the end goal and the hope for a third temple, my question is whether this goal is a violation in and of itself due to the Kohanim issue.</p>\n<p>What I mean is if we don't have a guarantee about the priesthood's status anymore, we run the risk of inviting a population of people in to manage the temple who have no business managing the temple. Not due to their character but due to the restrictions around lineage. They literally would not be allowed to stand where they'd need to be. What I'm asking is does the very act of restarting temple processes in a questionable way overrule the benefits to the Jewish people if we did so in a wrong way?</p>\n<p>I know that the Rabbinate of Israel formally bans Jews from the Temple Mount in part because they are concerned some Jews may go in beyond the archway and violate the sanctity of the location. This makes me wonder if that same rule would apply if we had the opportunity to rebuild the temple.</p>\n<p>Would Hashem recognize we are trying and relax his standards due to the circumstances of galut or would he be displeased with the temple restarting if it was done in an incorrect way? The fact we managed this long without it makes me wonder if we'd be forcing something we ultimately shouldn't.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are essays on this topic (in Hebrew) <a href=\"https://asif.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/6.-116-129-1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://asif.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/mal-8-8.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, with numerous sources cited.

They are given credit for forming the students to whom they taught Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Agadot_on_Sanhedrin.99b.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha</a> explains this is because a person can only exist when he has Torah and therefore supplying him with Torah makes him able to be created. Furthermore, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.9a.7?ven=english%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avoda Zara 9a</a> says that the two thousand years of Torah in the world start from Avraham when he taught Torah.</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.19b.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 19b</a> says the same idea, but changes the phraseology to:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָנִי אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹנָתָן: כׇּל הַמְלַמֵּד בֶּן חֲבֵירוֹ תּוֹרָה, מַעֲלֶה עָלָיו הַכָּתוּב <strong>כְּאִילּוּ יְלָדוֹ</strong>, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וְאֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹת אַהֲרֹן וּמֹשֶׁה״, וּכְתִיב: ״וְאֵלֶּה שְׁמוֹת בְּנֵי אַהֲרֹן״. לוֹמַר לָךְ: אַהֲרֹן יָלַד וּמֹשֶׁה לִימֵּד, לְפִיכָךְ נִקְרְאוּ עַל שְׁמוֹ.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shmuel bar Nacḥmani says that Rabbi Yonasan says: Anyone who teaches another person’s son Torah, the verse ascribes him credit <strong>as if he gave birth to him</strong>, as it is stated: “Now these are the generations of Aharon and Moshe” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 3:1</a>), and it is written immediately afterward: “And these are the names of the sons of Aharon: Nadav the firstborn and Avihu, Elazar, and Isamar” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 3:2</a>), but it does not mention the names of Moshe’s children. This serves to say to you that Aharon sired his children, but Moshe taught them Torah. Therefore, the children were also called by his name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p>So we see that the Gemara switches from \"making\" to \"giving birth\", does anyone pick up on this change in phraseology? I know the easy answer is that we can say it is quoting different Amoraim but wondered if there is anything more to say?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And perhaps we can say further, that there is a question on the second Gemara on 19b because the whole posuk says:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֵלֶּה תּוֹלְדֹת אַהֲרֹן וּמֹשֶׁה בְּיוֹם דִּבֶּר ה’ אֶת מֹשֶׁה בְּהַר סִינָי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it describes when Moshe learnt from Hashem, so how could the Gemara say that Moshe teaching was as if he gave birth if the posuk was only discussing Moshe learning. It must be that when Moshe was already learning and possessed that yearning to give it over, already from then it’s considered as if he gave birth to them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>So I asked this question to someone and they made the following suggestion:</p>\n<p>The only difference in the two Gemaras is the word \"את\".</p>\n<p>The Gemara on 99b says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המלמד <strong>את</strong> בן חבירו תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>while the one on 19b merely says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המלמד בן חבירו תורה (without the את).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps we can explain the difference between creating and giving birth. When someone is giving over only to a specific person as conveyed with the word את, then it’s merely a level of creating that person which the person possesses full control over just like creating a certain object.</p>\n<p>However, if someone just has כל המלמד בן חבירו תורה without anyone in specific and he is open to teach everyone, as we find by Moshe that already from the time he was learning he had in mind to teach anyone, then he gets the higher level of actually giving birth to them which we know a person has no direct control over.</p>\n\n\n",

I can't remember which biography I saw this in.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am assuming they both missed minyan during the week at those times.

If some say they had precedent for this, and others say actually no, they had no precedent and those who say so are wrong, I'd rather not get into that.

We can ask another question about whether that's legitimate or not.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>Three possible theories:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rabbeinu Yonah on the Rif Berachot 4a brings the opinion of the rabbonim of France that one need not leave one's place of learning in order to pray in a minyan because it is better to pray alone in a place designated for the study of Torah day and night than to pray in a shul in a minyan. So maybe that’s what the Arizal and others relied on.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Rema Orach Chaim Siman 90:18 (quoting Rishonim) says that someone for whom תורתו אומנתו (whose learning is his “occupation”), meaning that one does not waste any time not learning except for the absolutely necessary activities, may daven without being part of a minyan; however, nowadays this is discouraged. So perhaps the Arizal and others also relied on this.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Piskei Teshuvot O.C 90:9 quotes the Pri Megadim Siman 101 Mishbetzot Zahav Seif Katan 1, and also brought in the Biur Halacha that says one is permitted to daven by himself if he is, גדול הדור ומפורסם שכל מעשיו לשם שמים, which could be someone like the Arizal and Baba Sali. In the Mishmeret Shalom 10:4 he says that those who want to have the kavvanot of the Arizal (which are long and require lots of concentration and no distractions) may daven themselves, so this may also explain the practice of the Arizal and Baba Sali (who was also a very big kabbalist).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Permissible Hefsek while reading The Megillah",
    "content": "# Permissible Hefsek while reading The Megillah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I wish to present a halachic inquiry regarding the reading of the Megillah, specifically regarding the practice of making certain verbal additions during the kriyah itself.</p>\n<p>Specifically, I am curious whether there is room to permit the inclusion of the phrase “חרבונה זכור לטוב” within the reading, as mentioned by Rav Pinchas and others.\nWe find this concept already in the Yerushalmi (Megillah 3:7), which describes that Rabbi Yonasan, upon reaching the verse mentioning Nevuchadnezzar, would pause and declare:\n“נבוכדנצר שחיק עצמות.”</p>\n<p>The Gemara proceeds to ask why this was not similarly done when reading Nevuchadnezzar’s name in Yirmiyahu — clarifying that such an addition was made during the reading itself and not afterward.</p>\n<p>This theme reappears in Bereishis Rabbah (49):\nרַבִּי בֶּרֶכְיָה וְרַבִּי חֶלְבּוֹ מִשּׁוּם רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָן וְרַבִּי יוֹנָתָן... רַב כִּי הֲוָה מָטֵי לְהָמָן בְּפוּרִים, אָמַר אָרוּר הָמָן וַאֲרוּרִים בָּנָיו... אָמַר רַבִּי פִּינְחָס חַרְבוֹנָה זָכוּר לַטּוֹב.</p>\n<p>The Matnas Kehunah there explains explicitly that Rav Pinchas made this declaration as he reached the verse mentioning Charvonah during his reading of the megillah:\nא\"ר פנחס... בפורים כשהגיע לפסוק ויאמר חרבונה.</p>\n<p>The Maharzu suggests alternatively that perhaps these expressions were said after the completion of the Megillah, to avoid any appearance of a hefsek between the berachos and the mitzvah of reading:\n...אך במס' סופרים איתא בהדיא שרב אמר כן אחר קריאת המגילה... אפשר שהטעם משום הפסק הברכה והמ\"ע יקיים אחר הקריאה.</p>\n<p>Moving forward in time, the Shulchan Aruch (O.C. 690:16) codifies that one should say:\nצריך שיאמר ארור המן ברוך מרדכי... וצריך שיאמר וגם חרבונה זכור לטוב,</p>\n<p>which seems to legitimize such additions as part of the reading experience itself.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, later authorities such as Peninei Halacha — and this appears to reflect the common custom — specify that these statements are recited after the Megillah reading:\nצריך לומר אחר הקריאה... וגם חרבונא זכור לטוב.</p>\n<p>However, it would seem from other sources — including Shulchan Aruch O.C. 690:13, Yerushalmi Megillah 2:2, and Mishnah Berurah 690:19 — that a brief verbal interjection of this nature would not constitute a hefsek invalidating the reading. These sources indicate that not every interruption or reaction during the reading rises to the level of a prohibited hefsek, especially where it is derech kavod or derech mitzvah, as would be the case here.</p>\n<p>Having reviewed these sources, my main question is as follows:</p>\n<p>Is it halachically permissible, in principle, to make such additions during the reading of the Megillah itself — such as saying “חרבונה זכור לטוב” aloud upon reaching that verse — or would this nonetheless be considered an invalidating hefsek?\nAdditionally, if this is permissible, would the same apply equally to a private reading (for oneself or one’s family) as to a public congregational reading?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a discussion in the poskim with regards to saying ושם רשעים ירקב (pasuk in Mishlei 10:7) when getting to המן, which we would then apply to all other phrases mentioned in Masechet Sofrim 14:6 and other places.</p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham 690:21 citing the Levush, the Shalmei Tzibur page 328, Chemdat Yamim Purim Perek 3, Hagahot Uminhagim Purim אות נה, permit to say ושם רשעים ירקב (Mishlei 10:7).</p>\n<p>In Sefer Shenot Chaim Siman 32 footnote 16, Kaf Hachaim 690:11, Chazon Ovadia Purim page 93 forbid saying it.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the possible reason for both sides?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Side that permits it:</strong> Sha'ar hatziun 690:57 writes that it's not a hefsek based on Shulchan Aruch O.C 690:13; however there could be a big problem where if people start saying ושם רשעים ירקב every time Haman is mentioned, there will be many who won't be able to hear the words before or after Haman, which is a big problem.\nHowever, Rav Moshe in Igrot Moshe Orach Chaim 1:192 says that even if we use this Shulchan Aruch to permit saying ושם רשעים ירקב after every Haman, this is not a lechatchila thing to do, even though it's technically valid, since maybe in the case of the Shulchan Aruch, the guy never said a bracha before the meggilah reading. And the Tosfoat in Brachot 13a in the name of the Yerushalmi says that Brachot are not מעכב, and Tosfoat Brachot 14a says that by Hallel for Rosh Chodesh, if one doesn't say a bracha, it's not שייך to say that there is a הפסק. Furthermore, that Yerushalmi Meggilah 3:7 that Rebbi Yonatan said נבוכדנצר שחיק עצמות might have been during the reading itself, therefore the Yerushalmi says there is no הפסק, if you learn like that.\nFurthermore, maybe based on the Midrash in Yalkut Parashat Vayera, 82, it says that anyone who mentions a bad guy and doesn't curse him goes over a לאו. The proofs that one should do this even while reading the meggilah would be from the Midrashim (Ester Rabah פרשה י, Beresheit Rabah Vayeira פרשה מט, and Yerushalmi meggilah 3:7.</p>\n<p><strong>Side that doesn't permit it:</strong> Rav Moshe then concludes that the Rosh Meggilah 1:8 says that this saying was after kriat hameggilah, and Rebbi Yonatan just did it as he was learning the meggilah in depth. Therefore, because of a safek it is better not to say the phrase. In Chazon Ovadia Purim page 93 he brings in the argument that people might still not be able to hear the words before and after Haman which be very problematic.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> From the Rav Moshe and Rav Ovadia in Chazon Ovadia Purim Page 93 and others, it seems that this should not be done lechatchilah (even though its technically permissible according to halacha) mainly because people might miss the words of the meggilah thus causing people to not fulfill the mitzvah.</p>\n<p>I would think that even if the meggilah is being read for ones family it would still be a problem based on the reason that people might still not be able to hear the words before and after Haman, however if someone is reading it to themselves, then there would be no problem seemingly.</p>\n\n\n",

Lemech also preserved Hevel's memory by marrying two women, as according to a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.4.1?ven=hebrew%7CPentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.4.1.4&lang2=he&p3=Bereshit_Rabbah.22.3&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash</a> that one daughter was born with Kayin and two with Hevel.</p>\n<p>Each of the three sons went on to amend Hevel's death in his own way: Yaval took up Hevel's mantle as a shepherd, and Yuval created music which is connected to the same pastoral lifestyle, and is also connected to Ruach Hakodesh (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Kings.3.15?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 2:3:15</a>), reflecting Hevel's closeness to Hashem. Tuval-Kayin is more complicated. He reflects a merge of Hevel and Kayin - he is named after Hevel like his brothers, but also after Kayin. He invented metal weapons that could be used to kill - detrimental to the world's development.<sup>2</sup> His actions led to the killing of Kayin by Lemech (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.4.24?ven=hebrew%7CPentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.4.23.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Beresheet 4:24</a>).

    "content": "# Numbers mi yodeya - how do we look at numbers in the Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently disagreed with a friend on the following question. I wonder if others can bring evidence.</p>\n<p>Assumed:\nFor various numbers the Torah seems to treat the number as being significant. (See the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mi-yodeya-series\">Mi Yodeya series</a> here on every number you've ever heard of.) For example, there are many \"threes\" (Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov; Pesach, Shavuos, Sukkos; Moshe, Aharon, Miriam;...) We seem to understand that there is some underlying idea that these \"threes\" share. The same is true for many examples of \"fours\", many examples of \"tens\", \"forties\", etc. Each number represents something shared by its examples; see the Maharal and many others who discuss what the underlying ideas are.</p>\n<p>Question: Do we think that all the cases of \"threes\", say, should be matched up in a specific one-to-one way? So (as a Midrash says), Pesach is Avraham Avinu, Shavuos is Yitzchak, Sukkos is Yaakov. Or the Ten Makos in Mitzrayim match up with the Asarah Maamaros that created the world: see the Maharal who puts them in reverse order, and some Achronim who switch the order... As the examples show, sometimes that is a good idea. Is it always true?<br />\nOf course, it maybe be difficult or impractical to do it, above our level. But in theory, yes, you should be able to match up each \"ten\" one-to-one, and each \"seventy\", etc. That was my friend's position and he claimed his rabbeim would agree with him.</p>\n<p>I thought that was absurd. לשבר את האוזן, just because something is a three-dimensional system, say, doesn't mean that there's only one way to choose the axes. Depending on where you're standing on the earth, Up/Down, Forward/Back, Left/Right can be completely different directions - all perfectly acceptable and all very different and independent. My \"up\" can be equal to a sum of parts of your \"up, back, and left\". Why should Moshe, Aharon, and Miriam have to represent the <em>same</em> three sides as Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yaakov do? Maybe they're three different kinds of side.<br />\nDo you really think that the seventy souls who went down to Mitzrayim, just because they correspond to the seventy nations, have to match up one by one? Which one is Kush and which one gets to be Peleg? Which of the seventy nations is from the side of Leah, and which from the side of Rachel or Bilhah? I'm not saying it's hard to decide. I'm asking why you're so sure that exactly one of them corresponds to exactly one of the other group. Maybe it's just the aspect of \"seventy\" that they share, along with the Sanhedrin, along with the Parim on Sukkos, but they represent very different ways of looking at that aspect.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, does someone discuss this?</p>\n\n\n",

For the primary intention is to compare the actions of Israel to those of Abraham, not to those of Pharaoh. However, the language of the Sages brings healing and teaches us the depth of matters.</p>\n<p>The Sages were puzzled by the fact that the verse does not say “as he approached” (כַּאֲשֶׁר קָרַב), and therefore they interpreted it as referring to drawing near to the Omnipresent (God) – that is, drawing near with the heart. For the taking of Sarah by Pharaoh is one of the ten trials of Abraham. Abraham understood and knew that Sarah would be taken, and he offered his heart and hers to the Holy One, blessed be He, through Pharaoh and Egypt – to place their trust in God and withstand the test.</p>\n<p>This serves as a sign for Israel, who also drew near to the Holy One, blessed be He, through Pharaoh and Egypt at the sea, as it is written: “And Pharaoh drew near” (וּפַרְעֹה הִקְרִיב). This is interpreted in Shemot Rabbah, Parashat 21, Section 4, to mean that Pharaoh brought the hearts of Israel closer to repentance.</p>\n<p>This is the true parallel: in the case of Israel, it is written “And Pharaoh drew near,” and in the case of Abraham, it is written “as he drew near.”</p>\n<p>After a long time, I found this very idea explicitly stated in the Zohar on this verse “as he drew near,” and I rejoiced, for my understanding of the Midrash aligned with the truth of the Torah.</p>\n<p>And these are the words of the Zohar: Rabbi Elazar said, “‘As he drew near’ – it should have said ‘as he approached.’ Why does it say ‘as he drew near’? Rather, as it is written, ‘And Pharaoh drew near,’ meaning that he brought Israel near to repentance. So too, here, he brought himself closer to the Holy One, blessed be He,” etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And they were called Perizzite, as it is written in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.18.7?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim</a> \"to...a tranquil and unsuspecting people\", \"after the manner of the Tzidonim\".

Elsewhere, in the description of the Canaanite families in Parashat Noach, Tzidon (Sidon) is also described as distinct from the other families, as all of the families were included in the territory of Canaan, while Tzidon was described as having a separate territory. As for why the Tzidonim were known as Perizzites, this question is clarified in a verse in Shoftim which describes people from Tzidon (or at least closely connected to them) living tranquil lives, which appears to indicate they lived in unwalled cities - not fearing any enemy attacks.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the hebrew wiki entry on <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%96%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פריזי</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Perizzite are never mentioned anywhere separately from the other Canaanite nations. In fact, they aren't t even mentioned in the list of the sons of Canaan:</p>\n<p>\"וּכְנַעַן, יָלַד אֶת-צִידֹן בְּכֹרוֹ וְאֶת-חֵת: וְאֶת-הַיְבוּסִי, וְאֶת-הָאֱמֹרִי, וְאֵת הַגִּרְגָּשִׁי:\"\n— Book of Genesis, Chapter 10, verses 15–16</p>\n<p>Arel Segal Halevi writes that it is possible that the term “Perizzite” is merely a designation given to a portion of Canaan’s descendants (perhaps among the sons of Canaan who did not become separate nations — such as the Arkite, the Sinite, the Arvadite, etc.), possibly because they lived in villages and unwalled towns (arei perazot), as it is written:</p>\n<p>\"וְעַכְבְּרֵי הַזָּהָב מִסְפַּר כָּל עָרֵי פְלִשְׁתִּים לַחֲמֵשֶׁת הַסְּרָנִים מֵעִיר מִבְצָר וְעַד כֹּפֶר הַפְּרָזִי...\" (Book of Samuel I, Chapter 6, verse 18).\nAnd Rashi explains: \"כפר הפרזי\" — a village without a wall.</p>\n<p>Also written in Ezekiel:\n\"וְאָמַרְתָּ אֶעֱלֶה עַל אֶרֶץ פְּרָזוֹת אָבוֹא הַשֹּׁקְטִים יֹשְׁבֵי לָבֶטַח כֻּלָּם יֹשְׁבִים בְּאֵין חוֹמָה וּבְרִיחַ וּדְלָתַיִם אֵין לָהֶם\" (Book of Ezekiel, Chapter 38, verse 11).</p>\n<p>It may be inferred that peoples who lived in unwalled towns were peaceful nations engaged in trade rather than war. Accordingly, the Perizzite was also a quiet and tranquil people — perhaps even more so than the Canaanite.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra, in his commentary on the Torah, associates the nation of the Perizzite with “Sidon,” the firstborn son of Canaan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It is so called as it flashes just like a bolt of lightning, ברק. <strong>It illuminates like a lamp</strong>. Onkelos also translates it as ברקן, a flashing stone. This was the gemstone Noach hung in the ark to provide him with light. The Torah referred to this light in Genesis 6,15 צהר תעשה לתבה. Isaiah refers to it as אקדח, in Isaiah 54,12 where, speaking of the future of Israel he writes: ”I will make your battlements rubies and your gates of precious stones, i.e. לאבני אקדח.” The name is justified as it appears glowing like red-hot coals. A similar expression occurs also in Isaiah 50,11: “kindlers of fire.” The reason this stone was chosen to symbolise Levi was that the Levites illuminate the people by teaching them spiritual illumination, i.e. Torah, as we know from Deut. 33,10 יורו משפטיך ליעקב ותורתך לישראל, “they teach Your judgments to Yaakov and Your Torah to Israel.” We also know of Moses, who was of the tribe of Levi, that the whole house was filled with light when he was born as the Midrash (Shemot Rabbah 1,24) interpreted the words in Exodus there (Exodus 2,2) that “she (his mother) saw that he was good.” Furthermore, when Moses returned from Mount Sinai with the second sets of Tablets the Torah testified that the skin of his face emitted rays of light (Exodus 34,29). We have another verse (Kohelet 8,1) “a man’s wisdom lights up his face.” The positive value of this gemstone is that it is apt to enlighten the foolish, providing him with insights he never had. <strong>This is in addition to the general usefulness of that jewel in providing light just as does a lamp</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But I am missing lots of details and clarity, especially on what prayers are said when alone vs. in a communal service.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<ol>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/modeh-ani/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Modeh Ani</a> (see source for the positioning).</li>\n<li>Washing <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1452816/jewish/Whats-Up-with-the-Hand-Washing.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Negel Vaaser</a>.</li>\n<li>Dressing, going to a <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/men-immersing-in-a-mikveh-daily-prior-to-davening-shacharis-part-1/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mikva</a> (ritual bath) if there's one in the area (some may even use a pool).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/283764/jewish/Jewish-Morning-Prayers.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Morning Prayers</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/706163/jewish/Text-of-the-Shema-Prayer-in-Hebrew-and-English.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shema</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://derher.org/wp-content/uploads/Kislev-5784-4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mezonot</a> (pastries), coffee / tea to taste.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://derher.org/wp-content/uploads/40-shevat-5776-05.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Learn</a> <a href=\"https://chabadpedia.com/index.php/Toras_HaChassidus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad Chassidus</a>.</li>\n<li>Shacharis. <em>Whether or not you're praying with a minyan, <strong>preparing</strong> for prayer  is the same:</em> Start at <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/torah-texts/1754412/Online-Siddur-with-Commentary/Morning-Prayers/Hareini-Mekabel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hareinu Mekabel</a>, until <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/torah-texts/2352011/Online-Siddur-with-Commentary/Morning-Prayers/Eizehu-Mekoman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eizehu Mekomon</a> at this point we <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/530124/jewish/Tallit-The-Jewish-Prayer-Shawl.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lay the Talit</a> (if applicable) and <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/272666/jewish/How-to-Put-on-Tefillin.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teffilin</a>.

In the first one, he states that Shmuel was judge from Eli's death to Shaul's Coronation [20 years], adding that that includes the 20 years that the Aron was in Kiryas Yearim before Klal Yisroel did Teshuva, and then 5 or 6 years before Shaul's coronation. That would mean that from Eli's death to Shaul's coronation is 25-26 years, not 20 as he mentioned in the timeline!

The Abarbanel preferred including Shamgar's reign within the 80 years between Ehud and Yavin, but noted a variant option for Shamgar, having him rule for one year. This would shift all dates forward by one year until Shmuel's time, and then cutting down Shmuel's reign as judge by one year (19 years total instead of 20). Abarbanel assumed that all dates were accurate except for the \"300 years\" that had passed since the Israelite conquest of the Amorite (ex-Ammonite) territory in the 40th year from the Exodus, stated by Yiftach in his speech to the king of Ammon. Here he assumed that it was a rough estimate, with the accurate number being 268 years from year 40.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTaPSx2A.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oTaPSx2A.png\" alt=\"Timeline graphic of the Abarbanel's opinion on the biblical chronology\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

The new asteroid is not orbiting Earth, but conducting an orbit around the sun that is close to Earth's. As such, it is not a \"moon\" but a space rock that happens to be close to us, and will dissapear in 2083 because it is not in a stable orbit around Earth.</p>\n<p>Also, like @RabbiKaii and @shmosel said, halachically \"moon\" refers to Earth's current moon, the rounded object you can see in the sky.</p>\n<p>If halachically a \"moon\" were any object orbiting the earth that you could see, than we could celebrate Rosh Chodesh every 90 minutes because the ISS could be considered a moon.</p>\n<p>If earth really did have a second moon that was astronomically defined as one, I still think that halachically only our moon that we already are familiar with would count for calendar purposes.</p>\n<p>As for the premise of the question, I think it is valid, since technically the question actually also includes the question inside a question of \"what is halachically defined as a moon?\"</p>\n\n\n",

Because it's connected to Hashem's Name - yud-hei (י-ה) - which shows us there's a kesher, a connection, between the physical aliyah and the Shechina, the divine presence, davka.\nNow, regarding the Mabul, the flood - the Torah tells us explicitly that the water rose fifteen amos above the highest mountains, right there in Bereishis 7:20. This number could symbolize, in a symbolic way, the koach of HaKadosh Baruch Hu that encompasses everything - both in destruction and also in protection of the briyah, the creation.\nSo mamash, the number fifteen in these contexts - it connects the whole inyan of aliyah, of divine presence, and of Hashem's all-encompassing power, you see?</p>\n\n\n",

For an excellent summary, I recommend Yaakov Spiegel's book עמודים בתולדות הספר העברי: הגהות ומגיהים (can be found in Otzar Hachochmah and Kotar). This volume, part of a series on the history of the Jewish book, is dedicated to examining sources from throughout Jewish history on the topic of hagahot (annotations) and manuscript variations. In chapter 15 he discussed views on the topic from the late Enlightenment period (end of the 18th century) and the early modern era (19-20th centuries). As he cited, several prior scholars have written regarding Chazon Ish's views regarding the role of manuscripts in the field of Torah study and halacha, including: Zvi A. Yehuda, '<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23258632\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hazon Ish on Textual Criticism and Halakhah</a>', <em>Tradition</em> 18 (1980), pp. 172-180; Rabbi Shnayer Z.

Yehuda began his discussion by stating that he was once asked by the eminent Orthodox scholar <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Binyamin Menashe Levine</a> to ask the Chazon Ish - whom Yehuda knew personally - why yeshiva students (and the yeshiva world at large) don't use his then-newly-published <em>Otzar Ha'Geonim</em>, a work he had toiled upon for years and which he believed would have greatly enriched the study of yeshiva students. According to Yehuda, Chazon Ish responded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The old material, we have; the new, we don't need. The sources already printed are found in the works of the Rishonim, organically within the context in which they are quoted and the way they are discussed and treated; the sources now printed for the first time from Geniza manuscripts, whatever their importance may be for academic study, are irrelevant for halakhic consideration.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, usage of material - minute as it may be - that was not known to earlier generations, those whose works form the basis of the modern halachic corpus - is extremely problematic, as it is not contained within said corpus. As such, this material did not undergo generations of refinement within the rabbinic crucible and is therefore irrelevant for current discussions of halacha.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Chazon Ish noted regarding the nusach of the Munich manuscript of the Talmud (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_Codex_Hebraica_95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ms. Munich 95</a>), which is the only manuscript we have today of the entire Bavli, and which formed the basis for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael_Nathan_Nota_Rabinovicz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Refael Natan Neta Rabinovicz</a>'s <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikdukei_Soferim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dikdukei Sofrim</a></em>. In response to seeing its usage within halachic discussions, Chazon Ish wrote (קובץ אגרות מאת חזון איש, vol. 1, no. 33 [cited by Spiegel, p. 544]):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...ולהגיה בגמ' עפ\"י כת\"י מינכן, וכי כל חכמי הדור מזמן הראשונים עד עכשיו כולם לא עמדו על האמת, מפני שסופר אחד טעה והוסיף דברים בגמ' מלבו, והכשיל את כל החכמים. ואני לא מהם ולא מהמונם, וכת\"י שהיה ביד הראשונים מסרו נפשם עליהם, והשגחתו ית' שלא תשתכח תורה מישראל הגינה עליהם, וכשהחלו להדפיס את הגמ' מסרו חכמי הדור נפשם על זיקוקו והגהתו. ואם אמנם לפעמים נהנים מהכת\"י לנקות השיבושים המתהוים בהמשך הזמן, אבל דבר שיצא מיד כל רבותנו בלי שום פקפוק - חלילה להרוס. הגע בעצמך, בשעה שיש שלשה כת\"י לפנינו ושניהם שוין, אנו לוקחים את השנים ומניחים את האחד, ומאן לימא לאן דכת\"י מינכן אינו מאותו שנתבטל ברוב בזמנו, ומאן לימא לן שלא היה ידוע לבעלי מדוקדק, ובכל אופן הוא בטל כחרס הנשבר נגד הגרסא המקובלת, וכי מני שהסופר טעה והשמיט איזה תיבות [...] נבנה מגדלים, ואולי כן שהסופר השמיטם ולא מיד חכמים הוא, אבל כשאנו סומכים על הקבלה, תורת רש\"י ותוספות וכל החכמים, ודאי היא התורה, וכמעט שלא ראיתי תועלת להגיע אל האמת ע\"י הגירסאות שמחפשים מהגניזות, רק כולם תועלת לעוות משפט ולעקם את האמת, וראוי היה לגונזם, שההפסד יתר על השכר.\"</p>\n<p>\"...And to make corrections in the talmud according to Ms. Munich, and [should we think] that all of the sages of past generations did not uncover the truth, all because one scribe made a mistake and added things to the gemara from his mind, and caused all of the sages to stumble. And I am not of them and their kind, and manuscripts that were in the hands of the Rishonim they gave their lives over them, and the Blessed One's providence that the Torah shall not be forgotten from Yisrael protected them, and when the gemara began to be printed, the sages of the generation gave their lives to purifying and correcting it (=the nusach). And even though sometimes we enjoy from fixing errors formed over time within manuscripts, but something that undoubtedly came from the hands of our rabbis - God forbid that we destroy. See for yourself, when we have three manuscripts before us and two are equal, we take the two and leave the third, and who told you that Ms. Munich was not one of those that was canceled out in time, and how do you know that it (Ms. Munich) was not known to the annotating sages, and in any case, it (Ms. Munich) is canceled out like a broken pottery sherd in the face of the accepted (widespread) version, should we build towers from a version where the scribe made a mistake and left out some words, and perhaps the scribe is the one who left out the words and not sages, but when we rely on tradition, the Torah of Rashi and Tosfot and all of the sages, it is certainly the Torah, and I hardly saw any usage for reaching the truth based on versions pulled out from genizot, their entire usage is to simply distort the law and bend the truth, and it is appropriate to bury them, for the loss is greater than the gain.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, according to the Chazon Ish, widespread versions of sources are more trustworthy than ancient manuscripts, because we must believe that the popular versions were ones that were checked out, properly corrected and purified by earlier sages, and that Hashem's providence led to our possession of these popular versions. Chazon Ish also produced arguments specifically against Ms. Munich: It may well be that this manuscript was already known at the time of its production to be of poor quality in terms of its content. In the end, we really do not know what Jews of the past thought of its nusach. In other words, old and complete isn't necessarily better.</p>\n<p>That's not to say that the Chazon Ish would have been entirely against the usage of manuscripts, as he himself noted that sometimes scribal errors may creep into manuscript traditions that had passed under the hands of sages. Rabbi Bleich in his article (pp. 38-39) noted a case where Rabbi Wosner ruled in favor of a version of Ra'avad cited by the Rosh and the Shulchan Aruch against the Chatam Sofer's interpretation of the Ra'avad, as a version of Ra'avad based on newly-discovered manuscripts proved that the former poskim's versions were more accurate than Chatam Sofer's, thereby rendering the latter's interpretation irrelevant. Such a case conforms with the Chazon Ish's view, according to Rabbi Bleich.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein agreed with the Chazon Ish's position to some extent. His main criticism of critical editions of Jewish works was that they were often produced by academics and not men truly learned in Torah, which would often lead to severe mistakes in their reasoning. See a summary of his view in Rabbi Bleich's article, pp. 37-38. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Yosef_Zevin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Zevin</a>, who was part of the team that worked on <em>Dikdukei Sofrim Ha'Shalem</em>, agreed that manuscripts may only be used if they are in agreement with a textual tradition that can be found among the Rishonim. His rationale was that we today do not have the ability to discern correct textual versions and must trust the judgement of the giants of previous generations (<em>Dikdukei Sofrim Ha'Shalem</em>, vol. 5: Ketubot, pt. 1, p. 12; mentioned also by Rabbi Bleich, p. 42).</p>\n<p>But the Chazon Ish also had some opponents on the issue. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Yaakov_Weinberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg</a> (author of <em>Shu\"t Seridei Esh</em>), for example, noted on one hand that there is no reason to assume that a unique textual tradition found in the work of a rishon was necessarily flawed. The reverse may be true: That that book preserves the true, correct version. Therefore, Rabbi Weinberg wholeheartedly supported the publication of critical editions. See a summary of his view in Rabbi Bleich's article, pp. 35-37.</p>\n<p>Another of the Chazon Ish's opponents on the matter was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher</a> (most well-know for his <em>Torah Shelemah</em> compendium), who began publishing the <em>Gemara Shelemah</em>, a critical edition of the Talmud based on multiple manuscripts. On the occasion of the publication of two volumes from a separate project, Yad Ha'Rav Herzog's Mishna Zeraim and Masechet Ketubot of <em>Mif'al Ha'Shas Ha'Shalem</em>, Rabbi Kasher published an essay on the importance of using manuscripts in the study of gemara (\"<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51870&st=&pgnum=365\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">להופעת שני כרכים ממפעל הש\"ס השלם</a>\", <em>Noam</em> 16 [5733/1973], § Halachah, pp. 165-182). This essay was prefaced by an essay written by Rabbi Yisrael Rosen on the importance of Rabbi Kasher's work in the field of talmudic manuscripts (\"<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51870&st=&pgnum=356\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">להופעת שני כרכים ממפעל הש\"ס השלם</a>\", ibid., pp. 156-165), and included copies of letters Rabbi Weinberg sent Rabbi Kasher (and herein we see the differences between the Chazon Ish and Rabbi Weingarten). Among other things, Rabbi Kasher responded to the Chazon Ish (simply referring to him as a \"gadol ha'dor\" without explicitly stating who he was speaking about. However, he quotes the above passage from <em>Igrot</em>, vol. 1):</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kasher opened by expressing surprise at the Chazon Ish's wholesale rejection of manuscripts simply due to one scribal error in Ms. Munich, which led another contemporaneous rabbi to reach a faulty conclusion regarding that specific passage. He then noted the importance of Ms. Munich:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is the only complete Shas manuscript that has survived to this day.</li>\n<li>It was used by the author of the Korban Netanel.</li>\n<li>Several prominent rabbis welcomed Rabbi Rabinovicz's publication of <em>Dikdukei Sofrim</em>, based on Ms. Munich. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Saul_Nathansohn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Natansohn</a> (author of <em>Shoel U'Meshiv</em>) in particular greatly valued the book and heaped praises on it. Other gedolim who praised the publication include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Elchanan_Spektor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Elchanan Spektor</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Ettlinger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Ettlinger</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Kluger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shlomo Kluger</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Rabbi Kasher then noted the flaws in the Chazon Ish's arguments:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The process of preserving two manuscripts against a third is only relevant for Written Torah (Tanach). The poskim never argued that the same rule applied to manuscript variants of Oral Torah works.</li>\n<li>The reverse is actually true: There were poskim who argued that a manuscript with a unique textual tradition must also be taken into account (חוששין לו).</li>\n<li>Many gedolim over the ages used variant manuscripts and textual traditions as a basis for their arguments.</li>\n<li>The claim that \"when the gemara began to be printed, the sages of the generation gave their lives to purifying and correcting it (=the nusach)\" is simply incorrect - studies of the history of the printing of the Talmud shows that no gedolim were involved in correcting the nusach of the printed Shas. Again, the reverse is true - when gedolim began studying printed gemaras, they marked down the vast number of mistakes found in these editions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is therefore evident, noted Rabbi Kasher, that the many mistakes in the printed editions <em>necessitate</em> a critical study of the textual tradition of the Talmud, to discern what is the most correct text. Rabbi Kasher finished off this section of the essay by noting that the same (regarding using manuscripts and variant textual traditions to discern the correct text) should be argued regarding other Jewish works, from the time of the Geonim and onwards.</p>\n<p>Where we are today: Rabbi Kasher had opened his essay by noting that it's clear to him that not every person has the intellectual capability to sift through textual variations and to properly understand how each variation arose, but he hoped that other talmidei chachamim (<em>Yechidei Segulah</em> as he referred to them) will join him, perhaps via Yad Ha'Rav Herzog, in working on producing a critical edition of the Shas and other important Jewish works, and that these editions will be welcomed by the yeshiva world. Nowadays, however, to my knowledge, it seems that for the general gemara (and other works)-studying public, the old printed editions largely remain triumphant, while the study of manuscript variants is mainly limited to the halls of academia, though can also be found among some individuals in the Torah/yeshiva world. Some yeshivas and Torah-background-type institutes publish on occasion new critical editions of Jewish books, typically the result of a joint effort between members of the institutions and more academically-leaning scholars. Sometimes such editions merit general popularity and sometimes they remain obscure.<sup>1</sup> It's not entirely clear to me whether there are prominent \"camps\" today as there were back then (last century). Perhaps someone else can shed light on the matter.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Anecdotally, there's such an institute that's connected to my yeshiva (it was essentially founded by alumni and is situated near the yeshiva; note that I am otherwise unaffiliated with this institute) that published, among other books, a new edition of the <em>S'fat Emet</em>. I've heard that the Gerrer Rebbe keeps this edition on his desk.</p>\n\n\n",

He heard it in a class from a young Chacham but that's all he can tell me.</p>\n<p>I don't know exactly what was said but the following do seem to apply:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He wasn't saying that Chassidic learning is fundamentally wrong in and of itself</li>\n<li>He was framing it as a preference</li>\n<li>It isn't anything to do with <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/150003/31534\">the controversy regarding the Baal Shem Tov's use of \"non-Vitalian sources\"</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I don't dare to misquote him, so please understand that this is just third hand \"hearsay\" and is only provided to help someone who might know respond, but it was something along the lines of him not liking the more philosophical, expansive way of explaining Kabbalah, with lots of deep connections between matters, <em>bechina</em> of this and <em>bechina</em> of that etc, e.g. the way <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Meir_Morgenstern\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaRav Morgenstern Shlita</a> teaches.</p>\n<p>Can someone please confirm what he thinks about it more precisely, as well as explain it in more detail? Why doesn't he like what he claims to not like? What does he find wrong with it and what does he see value in his method over it? What precisely is his method in contradistinction to the \"Chassidic\" method? The more detail and clarity, the better.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Fascinating question.</p>\n<p>I preface this answer by openly stating this is not an area of expertise, but I was intrigued by the question and therefore did some digging...</p>\n<p>So, firstly some background as to the Chassidish approach.</p>\n<p>It writes <a href=\"https://inner.org/chassidut/chassidut.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chassidut is inwardly based upon the ancient doctrinal tradition of Kabbalah. Outwardly it gives new emphasis to the simple and joyful service of God, particularly through prayer and acts of loving-kindness. <strong>In Chassidic thought, the abstract and often impenetrable formulae of classical Kabbalah are recast into the psychological terms of human experience.</strong></p>\n<p>By using the individual’s own inner experience as an allegorical model for understanding the deepest mysteries of the universe, Chassidut both elevates the consciousness of the ordinary Jew as well as <strong>expands the conceptual territory of Kabbalistic thought</strong>. Indeed, the classical tradition of Kabbalah can be considered superficial relative to that of Chassidut. By focusing upon immediate experience, Chassidut identifies aspects of Divinity that the highly formal and abstract system of Kabbalistic induction leaves unexplored.</p>\n<p>Another way of explaining the differing emphases of Kabbalah and Chassidut is to say that Kabbalah focuses on the \"vessels\" (kelim) of Creation while Chassidut deals with the \"lights\"(orot) that fill these vessels. This distinction is apparent even in the names attached to these two mystical traditions: The word Kabbalah in Hebrew is derived from the root kabal, \"to serve as a receptacle or vessel,\" while the word Chassidut is constructed from the root chesed, \"lovingkindness,\" an attribute often referred to symbolically as the light of day...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more about detail about the specifics of the Chassidish approach to Kabbalah see <a href=\"https://www.saet.ac.uk/Judaism/Hasidism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a><sup>1</sup>. <strong>And also look at the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mevo_HaShearim.4.1?vhe=hebrew%7CHakhsharat_haAkhrakhim,_16._Ring._11-432&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">4th chapter of Mevo HaShearim</a> by the Piaseczna Rebbe that deals exactly with this topic at length.</strong></p>\n<p>It would seem that this extra dimension, of \"recasting\" Kabbalah is what Chacham Hillel takes issue with.</p>\n<p>I found this academic piece entitled <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/913898/_The_Boundaries_of_the_Kabbalah_R_Yaakov_Moshe_Hillel_and_the_Kabbalah_in_Jerusalem_Kabbalah_and_Contemporary_Spiritual_Revival_ed_Boaz_Huss_Beer_Sheva_2011_pp_163_180_English_\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Boundaries of the Kabbalah: R. Yaakov Moshe Hillel and the Kabbalah in Jerusalem</em>, Kabbalah and Contemporary Spiritual Revival, ed. Boaz Huss, Beer Sheva 2011, pp. 163-180 (English)</a>.</p>\n<p>It is a good read and one of the things that it notes is how Chacham Hillel critiques the popularization of Kabbalah, warning against superficial interpretations and public display. As far as the chassidish approach, it is this 'deeper', discernment of the inner meaning of Kabbalah that he takes issue with. Or, in other words, whether the chassidish approach has both the capacity or right to explain it.</p>\n<p>On page 69, footnote 42 it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since Lurianic Kabbalah rarely reveals the inner meaning (nimshal) of any one\nof its symbols (mashalim), it is a matter of controversy whether it is possible for anyone to discern it. The prevailing view among Sefardic Kabbalists (in\nTeiman, Iraq and North Africa) is that the nimshal is not available to us; we\nmust simply learn Kabbalah as it has been revealed, as a sacred wisdom. As\ncontemporary author Rabbi Ya’akov Moshe Hillel writes, summarizing the position of the leading Sefardic Kabbalist, Rabbi Shalom Sharabi (1720–1777):\n“There is no possibility whatsoever to grasp the inner ‘nimshal’ hidden in the\ntext and its symbols. Ask yourself: Is it possible to interpret a riddle without first knowing the whole of the riddle itself, in all its detail? That is why our master Rabbi Shalom Sharabi—and following him, the works of most early and later Kabbalists—set their primary goal to study the teachings of Arizal, to know with as much clarity as possible, the stated symbolism (mashal hachitzon).... This is our primary task” [Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Hillel, Ahavas Shalom (Jerusalem, 2002), p. 124].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It also writes <a href=\"https://seforimblog.com/2021/11/how-dare-you-translate-kabbalah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> in footnote 26 the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Yaakov Moshe Hillel writes about the conditions and methods for Zohar study in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=64952&st=&pgnum=285&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayeshev HaYam, Part 3, Siman 32, sect. 11</a>, which includes the following statement (the original Hebrew is followed by its translation and analysis):</p>\n<p>… ובפרט יש להודיע ולהזהיר, לגבי אותם הקטעים שבזוהר העוסקים על דרך הסוד, שאיסור חמור הוא לתרגם אותם, כי אין בהם שייכות עם הפשט, והם סודות מופשטים ונעלמים, ורק שהלבישום במשלים גשמיים, אבל אין להם שום דמיון עם המשל החיצוני לפי האמת. ולכן אין בתרגומם שום תועלת כלל, כי הרי אין הדברים כפשטן כלל. ואדרבא הוא מזיק מאד, שמגשים בתכלית את הסודות. (ופשוט דגם ללשון הקודש אין נכון לתרגם לשונות כאלו). וכבר האריך בזה בתשובה רבינו הרי”ח טוב ז”ל בשו”ת רב פעלים (חלק א’ חלק יו”ד סימן נ”ו), וגזר חרם ושמתא על אדם אחד על שתרגם שיר השירים והאדרות וספר שומר אמונים ללשון ערבי המדוברת בין היהודים (באותיות עבריות). ואסר בכל תוקף לתרגם סודות התורה, עי”ש באורך.</p>\n<p>“It should specifically be made known and the caution given, that there is a severe prohibition to translate those passages of the Zohar that relate to Kabbalistic secrets, as they do not have any associated literal meaning. They are abstracted and concealed secrets expressed using physical analogies. However, in truth, they are not comparable with the external analogy. Therefore, there is no purpose in translating them at all, as these matters are not like their literal meaning at all. On the contrary, it is very damaging, as it absolutely physicalizes the secret concepts. (It is obvious that it is also improper to translate these expressions [from Aramaic] into Hebrew.) This has already been elaborated upon by R. Yosef Chaim in a responsum in Rav Pe’alim (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1401&st=&pgnum=152&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Part 1, Yoreh De’ah, Question 56</a>). He decreed the excommunication of an individual who translated Shir Hashirim, the Idrot [Rabba and Zuta] and the work Shomer Emunim into Arabic that was spoken by the Jews (using Hebrew letters). He forbade, in the strongest terms, the translation of the secrets of the Torah. Refer there at length.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So at least tentatively, we can suggest that he does not like the approach that Chassidish-based kabbalah takes where it probes and suggests meaning in the words of the Zohar and the like which, traditional sefardi mekubalim do not think anyone has license to do.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> In short, Chassidish thought reinterprets Lurianic Kabbalah through the inner life of the human soul, rather than as a description of cosmic, metaphysical processes. Whereas classical Kabbalah, especially the Lurianic system, focused on the structure of the divine realms, the emanations (sefiros), and the dynamics of creation, contraction (tzimtzum), and repair (tikkun) in the supernal worlds, Chasidism internalised these doctrines, seeing them as psychological and spiritual processes within man.</p>\n\n\n",

In the past, I used to make nedarim (vows), and this approach worked very well for me—once I made a neder, whatever I vowed about became completely forbidden to me, just like eating pork, and it really helped me overcome the nisayon (challenge).</p>\n<p>However, someone later warned me very strongly not to make any more nedarim, saying it’s dangerous and that people can end up suffering their whole lives because of them.</p>\n<p>I’ve heard about the practice of saying “bli neder,” where you make a commitment without it having the full halachic weight of a vow. My question is: Is there something in between—something like a “neder-bli-neder”—where the commitment is stronger than a regular promise, but doesn’t carry the severe consequences of an actual neder? Has anyone heard of such a concept or practice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Doing a commendable practice three times without specifying bli-neder is an intermediate level -- somewhat like a neder, but probably not a full Torah-level vow. \"כעין בל יחל\"</p>\n<p>.ר\"ן נדרים דף 81 ד\"ה משום שנאמר</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This might not be what you are looking for, but you can make a time-limited Neder.

Getting a neder rescinded is not a simple or comfortable process. Having a Neder time-fenced reduces the risk and challenge of ensuring it is not transgressed.</p>\n<p>If the Neder was successfully upheld for the duration of its lifetime, you can then create a new one.</p>\n<p>(I believe I saw this hint in a <a href=\"https://guardyoureyes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">guardyoureyes</a> handbook some time ago.

According to the <a href=\"https://www.jewishhistory.org/the-volozhin-revolution/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish History website</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until then, the system of learning in Eastern Europe was that boys went to cheder (literally “a room,” but more broadly an elementary school) from about the time they turned three until about bar mitzvah. Some stopped at 11 or 12. Most young Jewish men were working by the time they were bar mitzvah. The elite — those who showed promise in their Talmudic studies, or who came from the upper classes, or from rabbinic homes — continued their education into their adolescent years and beyond, usually by studying with the rabbi of the town in which they lived. That was part of the task of the rabbi, to conduct the study sessions with whoever came to learn. If the young man showed particular promise, then he was sent out of town to the cities of noted rabbinical scholars, where he would learn with that rabbinic scholar for a period of time. Then, finally, when he attained sufficient knowledge he would be ordained, usually by a number of rabbis.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, this doesn't sound like there had been any particular structure prior to Volozhin for advanced study beyond essentially a chavrusah with greater and greater rabbonim as one progressed. But I was reading the wiki of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_ben_Abraham_of_Sens\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Rash miSens</a>, where it references yeshiva learning that he did:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...for ten years, together with his older brother R. Yitzhak (known as the \"Ritzba\"), attended the Yeshiva of Rabbi Isaac ben Samuel ha-Zaken (the Ri) of Dampierre, after whose death he took charge of the yeshiva of Sens.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This sounds like a more structured design than the history of Volozhin would suggest. What is known about these earlier yeshivos, around the period of the Tosafists? What was their design, and how Volozhin differ from them such that it became known as the mother of yeshivos?</p>\n\n\n",

How did this view arise? Who were the first people who announced it? If you are thinking of telling me that Rav Moshe would sometimes disregard this respect for Rishonim, is he the exception proving the rule, famous for doing this because almost nobody did this? And would such a person, who felt free to differ with all Rishonim and Acharonim, still have any use for the distinction?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Like <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/151814/1570\">user55402's answer</a>, I would say the trigger was a historical event. But not directly.</p>\n<p>It took a while for the Shulchan Arukh to get accepted. MichoelR's answer quotes the Yam Shel Shelomo's opposition. The Maharsha also objected. (Chiddushei Aggados, Sota 22a) And the Bach (responsum #80).</p>\n<p>The Maharal (Nesivos Shalom, Nesiv haTorah) proves that the Mechaber didn't intend the Shulchan Arukh [SA] as a stand-alone code, to be used without his commentary on the Tur that brings in previous discussion, the Beis Yoseif. There is a whole article by R' Ari Storch in Hakira vol. 33 on the topic of the original intent behind the SA, \"<a href=\"https://hakirah.org/Vol33Storch.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Was the Shulchan Aruch Intended to Be a Code of Jewish Law</a>?\"</p>\n<p>What brought common acceptance to the SA was when the standardized page included commentary from the first generations after its writing -- the Shakh, the Taz, the Magein Avraham, the Beis Shemu'el / Chelqas Mechoqeiq), Be'er Heiteiv, etc..</p>\n<p>This, combined with the Beis Yoseif, made it clear that the SA was a landmark in the conversation, and not entirely separate from it. The SA draws on previous conversation, and usually you could turn to the Beis Yoseif to see how, and it is published with the start of the contination of that conversation.</p>\n<p>This takes care of the Maharshal's et al's objection to the reliance on codes. In ways the Rambam's Mishnah Torah and the Tur do not. (While the Rambam tells the layman to just go straight to his book, he too didn't expect Rabbis to make decisions without looking at the same primary sources he did. But still, the text is very closed, and subsequent commentary didn't save it.)</p>\n<p>Same thing happened before:</p>\n<p>The <em>Mishnah</em> divides <em>tannaim</em> from <em>amoraim</em>.\nThe <em>Bavli</em> - <em>amoraim</em> from <em>ge'onim</em>.</p>\n<p>The Rif tried to sum up after the <em>ge'onim</em>, but it didn't get that level of acceptance. And sure enough, <em>rishonim</em> have no problem arguing with ge'onim.</p>\n<p>And in those cases there was a reason to summarize just then: Hadrian motivated Rebbe to write the <em>Mishnah</em>. The end of the Sanhedrin was followed up with the <em>Talmud Bavli</em>.</p>\n<p>The Rif lived right after the great relocation of Jewish communities that led to Ashkenaz and Sepharad. But there is no real split in authority -- <em>Rishonim</em> have no problem arguing with <em>Geonim</em> -- because not enough people started following the Rif's code, giving the <em>gemara</em>'s conclusions (as he saw them).</p>\n<p>The Mechaber lived among people expelled from Spain. So he too had reason to feel that the state of halakhah, his Beis Yoseif, needed a summary.</p>\n<p>So nowadays, if you want to hold differently than the SA, you need to bring a justification. An <em>Acharon</em> can be <strong>defined</strong> as a <em>Rav</em> who needs to justify a differing opinion, a <em>Rishon</em> as a potential source they could use for that justification.</p>\n<p>Parallel to the <em>gemara</em> concluding like a <em>beraisa</em> over a <em>mishnah</em>. Or like a rishon holding like a <em>Yerushalmi</em> or <em>Tosefta</em> despite the <em>Talmud Bavli</em>.</p>\n<p>And I mentioned the Holocaust and our subsequent gravitating to new codes.</p>\n<p>Our children or grandchildren will see if the Holocaust ended the <em>Acharonim</em>. It will take more than a historical event. If the Mishnah Berurah ends up being the Ashkenazi go-to summarizing text then we would be in a weird place where contemporary rabbis can't argue with <em>acharonim</em> on <em>Orach Chaim</em>, but they could in most other topics?!

But he decided that there was enough discussion in the Rishonim and he was going to quote much of it, and not add (much) more of his own. Then he would rule like two out of three of the main Rishonim: Rif, Rambam, Rosh. And where one of them didn't rule and the other two disagreed, or none of them ruled, he'd add on other Rishonim to decide.</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=67643&st=&pgnum=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yam shel Shlomo</a> (see Hakdamah to Bava Kamma and to Chullin), his contemporary the Maharshal disagreed strongly with this approach. He held that it was his obligation to study the sugya of the gemara, read and ponder what earlier authorities said about it, and then decide himself. He said (again, if I remember correctly) that the Beis Yosef was abdicating his responsibility by just letting the Rishonim \"vote\" on it.<br />\nHere is an article bringing Rav Ovadia Yosef's discussion on the subject: <a href=\"https://nleresources.com/2014/09/guest-post-to-begin-to-appreciate-rav-ovadia-yosefs-derech/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://nleresources.com/2014/09/guest-post-to-begin-to-appreciate-rav-ovadia-yosefs-derech/</a></p>\n<p>So roughly speaking, the Beis Yosef was taking the attitude you describe, that we could or should just work with the opinions of Rishonim, and the Maharshal didn't agree. Later authorities seem to mostly be following the approach of the Beis Yosef. And indeed they have great respect for the Maharshal himself, but usually won't accept his opinion over the usual Rishonim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My personal impression is that Rishonim tend to comment directly on the Gemara (or Rif), whereas Acharonim comment on the Gemara and commentaries of Rishonim, primarily Rashi and Tosafos. In other words, there is one group of commentaries that forms the starting point for a second group of commentaries. We call the former Rishonim and the latter Acharonim.</p>\n<p>The Acharonim feel duty-bound to try to justify the approaches of the Rishonim, although they will disagree if they feel compelled to do so by powerful arguments. Rishonim OTOH will disagree with each other much more freely. Some Acharonim are more confident in their willingness to argue with Rishonim, but they still feel obligated to refer to the Rishonim and demonstrate their reasons for arguing, as opposed to Rishonim who much more frequently just state their opinion without mentioning whom they disagree with.</p>\n\n\n",

It's likely supposed to be ר' חנוך, סרסה. \"Sarsa\" refers to Ibn Zarza (common Hebrew variants included אבן סרסא, אבן סרסה, אבן צרצא, אבן צרצה) - this is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_ibn_Seneh_Zarza\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shmuel Ibn Zarza</a>, a well-known Sefardic philosopher from the 14th century. Ibn Zarza was also sometimes simply known as R' Shmuel Zarza (/Sarsa, סרסא, e.g. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11643&pgnum=120\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shalshelet Hakabbalah</a>), so it seems that Abarbanel just wrote his surname.</p>\n<p>One source (R' Yochanan Lederman, <em>Midrash Abarbanel</em> [in Hebrew], p. 7 [can be found on Otzar Hachochmah]) appeared to suppose that \"Chanoch\" is also a printing error and that the original name was \"Shmuel\" (ר' שמואל סרסא in his words). However, there's another possibility, that Abarbanel did in fact mean, as I suggested above, that there were two people: ר' חנוך and סרסה. There are a few places in his works where Abarbanel listed philosophically-minded individuals who held views that Abarbanel deemed to be extreme and problematic. To identify Rabbi Chanoch, we turn to Abarbanel's list in <em>Yeshuot Meshicho</em>, pt. 2 (<a href=\"https://ravzuriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, p. 51), where he mentioned:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וכבר נמצא בזה...וגם בדברי הרלב\"ג ורבי חנוך אלקוסטאנטינא ורבי שמואל מוטוט ורבי לוי בן רבי אברהם...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would guess that this Rabbi Chanoch Alkostantina (in some editions \"Alkonstantina\" [אלקונסטאנטינא]) is the one Abarbanel referred to in his commentary. It seems likely that this Rabbi Chanoch should be identified with Rabbi Chanoch Saporta (ר' חנוך ספורטה/צפורטא/צפורתא/other variants). The only explicit mention we have of him is in a responsum by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Mizrachi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliyahu Mizrachi</a> (the Re'em), where he <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1233&pgnum=176\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">stated</a> that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordecai_Comtino\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Comtino</a>, who was born in Constantinople, told him (Rabbi Mizrachi) that his rabbi, Rabbi Chanoch Saporta, had a tradition from other Sephardic rabbis that it was allowed to teach Karaites Torah. The bit we know of Rabbi Chanoch is that he originally lived in Catalonia ca. the late 14th-early 15th centuries and apparently eventually moved to Christian Byzantium (which is likely where Rabbi Mordechai met him).<sup>2</sup> Rabbi Mordechai, his student, was known as being philosophically-minded. It's likely he received his views from his rabbi, Rabbi Chanoch. For these reasons I believe Rabbi Chanoch Alkostantina should be identified with Rabbi Chanoch Saporta. Rabbi Chanoch Saporta was likely also mentioned by the Karaite <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2404-bali-abraham-ben-jacob\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Bali</a> (Gurland, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/journals/NNL-Journals990018391730205171/NLI?volumeItem=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ginzei Yisrael in St. Petersburg</em>, vol. 3</a>, p. 32; the identification was suggested by Jean-Christophe Attias, <em>Le Commentaire Biblique Mordekhai Komtino ou l’herméneutique du dialogue</em>, Hebrew translation, p. 69).</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Avner:</strong></p>\n<p>This case is less clear. Given that these individuals were looked upon by the Abarbanel in disdain, I think it may be proposed that he was referring to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abner_of_Burgos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avner of Burgos</a>. Avner was originally a rabbi in Castille ca. the late 13th-mid-14th centuries, who eventually converted to Christianity. He was also known to being philosophically-minded, both before and after his conversion. Shalshelet Hakabbalah <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11643&pgnum=107\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brings</a> a legend about Avner having been a student of Ramban and what led him to apostasy. However, Avner was about 10 years old when Ramban died, and anyway the latter was already long living in Eretz Yisrael by that time, so the legend is impossible (at best, Avner may have been inspired by Ramban's writings, or perhaps was a student of a student). Most significant to us is Ibn Yechiya's wording of the story: He refers to Avner as ר' אבנר, which demonstrates that even after his apostasy, some later writers referred to him as ר' אבנר. This raises the likelihood that Abarbanel was indeed referring to Avner of Burgos.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As a side-note, it should be mentioned that ר' יהושע הנרבוני is also problematic. A famous philosopher of Narbonne was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_of_Narbonne\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Ha'Narboni</a>. His father's name is debatable (see a summary in <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99#cite_note-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this footnote</a> in his Hebrew Wiki entry), it was either Meir or Yehoshua. If Yehoshua is the correct version, perhaps the Abarbanel originally wrote בן יהושע הנרבוני, and ר' יהושע הנרבוני is a mistake already in the 1512 printing. If not, perhaps again it should be separated thus: \"ר' יהושע, הנרבוני\", with Narboni being one person - Rabbi Moshe Ha'Narboni - and Rabbi Yehoshua being another (though I don't know who).<sup>3</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This was still the wording in the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40218&pgnum=45\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leipzig 1681 edition</a> and the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40217&pgnum=35\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hamburg 1687 edition</a>.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> This rationale seems to be the basis for the assertion made in <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/he/newspapers/iva/1873/01/17/01/article/9/?e=-------he-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxTI--------------1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> that Rabbi Chanoch Saporta was a rabbi in Constantinople. And see also the assertion made <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36655&pgnum=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> A wild guess may be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_ibn_Shuaib\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehoshua Ibn Shuaib</a>, though I'm not sure if he was considered a philosopher.</p>\n\n\n",

And therefore where he might have taken Chabad-Lubavitch? Would <em>shlichus</em> have looked the same, with its globe-spanning, outward-looking approach?

Dirah Betachtonim in practice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are needed, it's not about <em>your</em> needs!</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It's interesting to note, from what I've heard, that the 6th Rebbe did say that he liked Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneersohn z'tl because he appreciated his vision*. Indeed, it is this vision that produced unique direction that he took Chabad in, and informed many of the resulting actions he took (and from this we can also presume Rabbi Shmaryahu Gurary z'tl would not have taken them, at least to this extent):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Shlichut</strong> - just go, you are needed. Don't wait until you are \"on the <em>madregah</em>\", it's Shabbos now.</li>\n<li><strong>Kiruv</strong> - Hashem needs all His Jews back, don't abandon them, like many were doing in the post-war generation. They are all Jewish in their hearts, someone needs to bring them their Torah and Mitzvot!</li>\n<li><strong>Tefillin</strong> - do the mitzvah even if the person is far from \"ideal\" (tattoos, no <em>mikveh</em>, shaky beliefs) — e.g., put on tefillin <em>on the street</em>. Earlier eras would protest \"<em>bizayon hamitzvah</em>\"; the Rebbe argued that in this era, this is the right move.</li>\n<li><strong>Education</strong> - stop with the negative pressure, \"What will be with you!\". Reframe in objective-mission language \"Can you do something for Hashem?\".</li>\n<li><strong>De-narcissize <em>avodah</em></strong> - don't focus on you \"becoming a <em>tzaddik</em>\", the goal is not about you, but about Hashem. Don't fix the Jew, <em>deploy him</em>!</li>\n<li><strong>Lectures</strong> - Chabad Rebbeim put out more material than all other Chassidic groups combined, and arguably <em>all other groups</em> - it's hard to imagine which modern dynasty comes even close. Weekly lectures and essays penned or delivered by the Rebbeim themselves for 7 generations. If you thought that was a lot, the 7th Rebbe <em>opened the floodgates</em>, putting out 3 generations of Chassidus in one generation, making sure every last detail of <em>penimius haTorah</em> was explained as thoroughly, clearly and <em>down to earth-ly</em> as possible. The Dirah Betachton.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This would also inform his other famous, rather unique practises - telling teenagers that they are fine, just get on with doing something useful.

    "content": "# What should an Ashkenazi expect from a Sefaradi Hoshana Rabbah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am Ashkenazi and will be davening at a Sefaradi shul for Hoshana Rabbah. (I don't know more precisely what minhag they follow.)  I've occasionally been to Sefaradi shuls during the week or Shabbat, but never on Sukkot.</p>\n<p>What should I expect that is different from what I'm used to (i.e. artscroll)?  I'm particularly interested in hoshanot, and in things that will not be obvious from following along in the siddur and could be distracting if I don't know about them in advance.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This was a separate minyan for a brit in the basement of a Sefaradi shul of some variety.  The baalei simcha are Syrian and ran the minyan, so it's probably following those minhagim.</p>\n<p>These are my observations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No tefillin</li>\n<li>Pesukei Dezimra\n<ul>\n<li>Same as a regular weekday, as far as I could tell.  At least it didn't seem to be longer.  If you're planning to say the Shabbos Pesukei Dezimra as per the Ashkenazi custom, you should start early.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hallel\n<ul>\n<li>This is where I was caught most off guard</li>\n<li>I think Sefaradim say לגמור את ההלל but wasn't paying enough attention to notice.</li>\n<li>They did <em>not</em> say הודו or אנא responsively, which surprised me.  (If anything I was expecting everyone to be yotzei the first four pesukim with the chazzan instead of also repeating them as Artscroll says.)  Instead everyone said the pesukim together, turning in unison and waving the lulavim.</li>\n<li>The order of the 6 directions of waving was different than I'm used to.</li>\n<li>They waved for the first הודו and the first time saying הודו at the end.  I'm fairly certain they did not wave for the repetition of הודו but did wave for both times אנא ה' הושיעה נא.</li>\n<li>For אנא ה', they waved one direction per syllable instead of two per word.  This makes נא a lot less unwieldy.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Hoshanot\n<ul>\n<li>Totally different than the Ashkenazi custom, but very easy to follow as long as you have a machzor.</li>\n<li>After Hallel, not after Musaf.</li>\n<li>Each hakafa had a similar structure: piyutim interspersed with responsive tefillot that were reminiscent of Avinu Malkeinu and selichot.</li>\n<li>Each time a different person was chosen to be the leader.  The leader reads the piyutim and leads the responsive parts.  The responses are either אמן or simple lines like וחוסה על ישראל עמך.</li>\n<li>We started each hakafa's prayers while walking around the bimah, but that finished pretty quickly.  After everyone completed 360 degrees we just stood in place to finish that hakafa, then started walking again when we got to the next one.</li>\n<li>After the 7 hakafot are tefillot that are kind of like the Ashkenazi ones.  A lot of the lines that are bolded in Artscroll (e.g. אנא אל נא הושענא והושיעה נא and קול מבשר מבשר ואומר) are still there, sometimes with slight variations, but the piyutim afterwards are different.  Sometimes they have similar structure.  For example the piyut that goes with אני והוּ הושיעה נא (also note different vowels) still has each stanza starting with כהושעת.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Leining\n<ul>\n<li>The aliyot were days 6, 7, 7, 6+7.  (As opposed to Ashkenazi 5, 6, 7, 6+7.)</li>\n<li>(As DoubleAA points out, this is not specific to Hoshana Rabba.  They follow a similar sequence every day.  For example the previous day was 5, 6, 6, 5+6.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Musaf\n<ul>\n<li>Kedusha was the same as the Sefaradi minhag for Chol Hamoed and Rosh Chodesh.  The intro was כתר, but there were just the short joining verses (לעמתם משבחים ואומרים) and no Shema.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Arava\n<ul>\n<li>They hit the aravot all the way after davening, not after hoshanot, and were makpid to go outside to hit it on dirt as opposed to the floor of the shul.  (Even though it was raining - the seudat mitzvah was inside.)  I didn't see it because I didn't know what was happening until they came back in.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

To this I'll add some info from Eliyahu Ashtor, <em>The Jews in Moslem Spain</em> (Hebrew edition), Vol. 1 p. 111 (can be found on Otzar Hachochmah). He was born in the Spanish city of Jaén (an important city in Eastern Al-Andalus) sometime during the second half of the 9th century CE. At some point he moved to Cordoba. He was a wealthy and righteous man. He built a synagogue in Cordoba and financially supported tamidei chachamim. His son Chasdai was born around 910 CE.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Dosa ben Saadya:</strong></p>\n<p>The two linked Wiki entries (in <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%91_%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%90_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A1%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dosa_ben_Saadia\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English</a>) are pretty rich (especially the Hebrew one) (though there's at least one discrepancy between them), so I'll summarize their info along with a bit of added info. Rav Dosa is thought to have been born around 930 CE, to Rav Saadayah Gaon. The family was originally from Fayum in Egypt, hence their last name \"Al-Fayumi\". Rasag was the first \"outsider\" (non-Babylonian) elected to position of Gaon (head of the yeshiva) in the Babylonian yeshivas of the period. Dosa was about 12 when his father died (ca. 942 CE). Dosa waited about 71 years (!) before being called upon to succeed his father as Gaon, stepping into the role at the ripe old age of 83 (ca. 1013), and holding office until his death four years later, ca. 1017/8. He succeeded Rav Shmuel ben Chofni Gaon, and was in turn succeeded by Rav Yisrael ben Rav Shmuel ben Chofni Gaon, who had previously served as scribe of the yeshiva under Rav Shmuel his father and then under Rav Dosa. Rav Dosa's advanced age was a matter of note, as indicated by a Genizah letter from the summer of 1015 CE mentioning him with added wishes for good health to be given to him (see its publication with a Hebrew translation <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/42926176/S_D_Goitein_Three_Letters_from_Qayrawan_Addressed_to_Joseph_ben_Jacob_ibn_Awkal_Tarbiz_vol_34_no_2_January_1965_156_161_Hebrew_\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Yechiel:</strong></p>\n<p>The following information is from Avraham Fraenkel, <em>The Piyyutim of R. Yechiel bar Avraham of Rome - Father of R. Natan, Author of the 'Aruch'</em> (in Hebrew), Introduction, pp. 1-4. Not much is known about Rabbi Yechiel. He lived in Rome and was the son of one R' Avraham, who was the son of one R' Yoav. All three were members of a Judeo-Italian family known in Hebrew as the \"Anavim\" (ענוים, humble), and in Italian Piatelli or Delli Mansi. A certain historical document describes an anti-Jewish decree from the year 1007 CE commanded by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_II_of_France\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Robert II of France</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990000688090205171-1,FL14960153%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentions</a> that Rabbi Yaakov ben Yekutiel, one of the leaders of the Jews of Rome, sought an audience with the pope to try to overturn the decree, and afterwards he met with other leaders of the community, among them one Rabbi Avraham. This might be Rabbi Yechiel's father.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yechiel lived ca. the first half of the 11th century, and according to a responsa from the Rokeach (preserved in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8727&pgnum=128\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Or Zarua</em>, Hilchot Rosh Hashanah, § 275</a>), he headed the yeshiva of Rome, and had studied under the previous head of the Roman beit midrash, Rabbi Yaakov Gaon. For this reason, Rabbi Yechiel was also referred to as \"Gaon\" in the responsa. It has been speculated that he died when his son Rabbi Natan was fairly young, and so the latter had not studied much under his father, and that Rabbi Yechiel was no longer alive when his son wrote the Aruch. He was known for writing various piyyutim and selichot (published by Fraenkel). He had three sons: Rabbi Daniel, Rabbi Natan and Rabbi Avraham (all are mentioned in another responsa in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8727&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Or Zarua</em>, Hilchot Shabbat, § 52</a>). Another prominent Roman rabbi who lived during Rabbi Yechiel's time was Rabbi Shabtai ben Moshe, a fellow paytan and a \"rosh kallah\" (a certain position in the Roman beit midrash, subordinate to the rosh yeshiva). Rabbi Shabtai's sons were Rabbi Moshe ben Shabtai and <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Kalonymos of Rome</a>, prominent figures as well (Rabbi Kalonymos eventually moved to Worms, Germany, and headed the yeshiva there. He is often thought as one of the \"missing links\" between Italian Jewry and Ashkenazic Jewry).</p>\n<p>It should be noted that Rabbi Yechiel lived during what were arguably the final decades of the Geonic period, so really all three of these figures should be considered as being from the Geonic period, not the Rishonic period.</p>\n\n\n",

In that case it could be said that the screen would be analogous to a preexisting flame. Now that being said, would swiping the screen to answer the call or message be analogous to increasing the flame?</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the way a touchscreen work is that when one touches the screen the user’s finger causes a disruption of the electrical field and based on the disruption the controller determines the action of the user. In which case, it should be analogous to extinguishing a flame. Based on this reasoning, should the use of the touchscreen be considered a forbidden action and therefore one may not answer a smartphone on Yom Tov?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which direction to face when shaking the Lulav (not the order in which we shake)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Minhag to keep one’s body still while waving, which direction does one face?</p>\n<p>I’ve read several times that one should face east, but no clear makor or reason was given. When I lived in America, I assumed it was to face Yerushalayim; however, since moving to eretz Yisrael, I notice that people are still facing east. When I asked for an explanation I was unable to get one.</p>\n<p>To my knowledge, in the times of the Beis Hamikdash, Jews wave their lulavim and esrogim in the beis hamikdash. We continue to do this today during Succos.</p>\n<p>Had the Jews in the Beis HaMikdash faced east for some kabbalistic reason, then in the beis hamikdash the entire klal would be turning their backs to the kadosh kadoshim and the shechinah to their west, which is very hard for me to understand.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I've received some corrections from AI, and made corrections on it:</p>\n<p>They circled the altar and the ceremonies thus <strong>facing all directions.</strong> Facing one direction is a <strong>modern adaptation</strong> anticipating the return to Jerusalem.</p>\n<h1>Did participants in the Temple's Sukkot lulav ritual face east, based on Mishnah Sukkah 4:5?</h1>\n<p>The <strong>Mishnah Sukkah 4:5</strong> describes the Sukkot <em>Hakafot</em> (circumambulations) around the Temple altar, where priests, Levites, and the crowd waved the lulav and performed the <em>aravah</em> ritual:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Each day they would circle the altar one time and say: “Lord, please save us. Lord, please grant us success” (Psalms 118:25). Rabbi Yehuda says that they would say: Ani vaho, please save us..</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The question is whether this implies they faced east while waving, as some modern customs suggest.</p>\n<h2>Answer</h2>\n<p>The mishnah describes the crowd standing facing the altar, waving lulavim in sync with the priests circling counterclockwise (Mishnah Sukkah 4:5; Talmud Sukkah 38b). The focus is on facing the dynamic procession, not a fixed cardinal direction like east. Classical sources (Rashi, Tosafot on Sukkah 51a; Rambam Hilchot Lulav 7:13) emphasize ritual unity, not orientation.</p>\n<p>In contrast, post-Temple customs (e.g., Shulchan Aruch OC 651:8; Arizal) prescribe facing east during lulav waving, symbolizing the return to Jerusalem. This is a rabbinic innovation, not a Temple practice. The Temple ritual prioritized encircling the altar and communal participation, with waving in all directions to signify God's universal presence (Talmud Sukkah 37b).</p>\n<h2>Summary Table</h2>\n<div class=\"s-table-container\"><table class=\"s-table\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Context</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Standing Direction of Wavers</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Source</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Temple (Sukkot Hakafot)</td>\n<td>Dynamic, facing the counterclockwise procession (all sides of altar)</td>\n<td>Mishnah Sukkah 4:5; Talmud Sukkah 51a</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Modern Custom</td>\n<td>Static, often facing east (symbolic)</td>\n<td>Shulchan Aruch OC 651:8; Arizal</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table></div>\n<p>Thus, the Temple practice does not support an east-facing orientation for lulav wavers.</p>\n<p><em>Sources</em>: Sefaria (Mishnah Sukkah, Talmud Sukkah); Rambam Hilchot Lulav; Shulchan Aruch OC 651.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My previous thoughts are below. Maybe they should be deleted, or maybe they're useful in understanding modern customs.</p>\n<p>Great question. When facing just one direction in waving lulav, one faces <strong>east</strong>, even at the Temple.</p>\n<p>One faces <strong>east</strong> because even the kh\"k, which contains the luchot haBrit, has their back on this, on the inyan of the <strong>Tzaddik who is the Berit</strong> who is in principle facing east (think Yossef haTzaddik or ..) and it's to him we are binding, and the klal is it's all Zekher Liysiyat Misrayim which was to the <strong>east</strong>, and Qriyat Yam Souf was in his merit, right?</p>\n<p>Which <strong>direction</strong> did we have to bring out his Atzmos? Another thing: since Yesod and the lulav corresponds to West, isn't it sensible <strong>it faces East</strong>? To unify? The four species?</p>\n<p>T. Zohar 2b: <strong>Lulab - Tzaddik</strong> like Tamar blooms (yiPrach) - yiZrach? Zerach - Peretz? Also keep in mind when the TZ was written, the Tzaddik haEmet is Rashbi.</p>\n<p>Also the following says the Sukkah is Imma which is Binah which is connected to Malkhut. These are <strong>no longer space dimensions</strong>, because Binah is discernment, past (Chokhma is foresight, future) and Malkhut is \"the No Good\" or counter-dimension to Keter per Sefer Yetzira. In the womb you have no direction. So maybe during Sukkot there's a less regard for directions. And if the Sukkah represents the Clouds of the Kavod, well in a cloud can you tell direction?</p>\n<p>There's a story about a Tzaddik, an apparent hunchback beggar, who told about a conversation where ... eventually they want to get to this Tree that's above space. He tells this group, \"Why argue about which side to get to the Tree? First ask <strong>who</strong> is worthy to get to that Tree! (He that attains the attributes of the Tree; its roots are faith, fear, and humility, and truth is the Tree's body). I believe this illustrates the level of the Spirit dimension (Keter-Malchus) over the other Sfirot namely time-space; by humility (contraction of Malkhut to Keter?) they're all Nothing. The point is <strong>who</strong>, and that who is facing <strong>east</strong>.</p>\n<p>ועל קן דצפורא דא אתמר, וסוכה תהיה לצל יומם וגומר, ואיהו לשון סכך שמסככת בה אימא על בניה, אפרוחים דילה תלת הדסים ותרי בדי ערבות ולולב, או ביצים דא אינון אתרוגין דכל חד שיעוריה בכביצה, ואלין דרשימין בהון כתיב עלייהו לא תקח האם על הבנים, דתלת הדסים רמיזין לתלת אבהן, תרי בדי ערבות לתרי נביאי קשוט, <strong>לולב צדיק כתמר יפרח</strong>, אתרוג רמיז לשכינתא, <strong>סוכה רמיזא לאימא דמסככת עלייהו,</strong> הא אינון תמניא לקבל יאקדונק\"י, דאיהו חושבן סוכ\"ה כ\"ו ה\"ס, ואלין דלא נטלין אלין סימנין בידיהון כתיב בהון שלח תשלח כת\"ר חכמ\"ה, דלא שריין אלין באלין תמניא, למהוי כלהו עשר ספירן בכל נענוע ונענוע דנענועי דלולב ומיניו, בכל פקודא ופקודא:</p>\n<p>And so too we need to bring the <strong>hostage</strong>, Rebbe <strong>Nachman</strong>, who told the aforementioned story, home. Isn't it fitting that we push <strong>south</strong> first in that custom? Also, Rashbi the Tzaddik haEmet, is in the north. I wonder if he faced south.</p>\n<p>The following says Lulab L-U L\"B. Meaning, the Waw, the Tzaddik, has (all the) 32 paths of wisdom. <strong>All the directions.</strong> And that waving ח\"י wavings four times, is said to humble the 72 nations. Then you say An-i Wa-hu (twice) from the 72 letter Name (again recalling Y\"M), thus the Mom is never again taken from her children, \"at that time.\" Regarding these nations, where was the reishit goyim and where was Yossef; what's their special relation? Also, it's morning and you're waving <strong>east</strong> against the sun which is Esau.</p>\n<p>פרי עץ הדר אימא תתאה, עץ איהו לול\"ב, (ל\"ו ל\"ב נתיבות), דאיהו אתרוג, וצריך לנענעא ביה לשית סטרין, ארבע רוחין ועילא ותתא, לאתערא עליה ו', ותלת נענועין לכל סטרא סלקין ח\"י, וצריך ארבע זמנין ח\"י, חד בנטילת לולב, וחד (נ\"א ותרין) באנא ה', תרין אחרנין בהודו לה' תחלה וסוף, <strong>ובאלין נענועין אינון משפילין מעילא לתתא לשבעין ותרין אומין</strong>, ולבתר דנצחי לון אמרי אנ\"י וה\"ו הושיעה נא תרין זמנין, דאינון וא\"ו מן וה\"ו אנ\"י וה\"ו, מן ויס\"ע ויב\"א וי\"ט, בההוא זמנא לא תקח האם על הבנים:</p>\n<p>Hey there's אומין again.</p>\n<p>In merit of Rashbi may the Bird be brought back to her children.

His birth town, Gath-Chefer, was in the Tribe of Zevulun, not far from Sidon, and was surrounded by the region of the Phoenician language, whose influence is clearly visible in the language of this prophet. However, according to tradition, the prophet Yonah received his prophetic inspiration while making pilgrimage (aliyah) to Yerushalayim. Following that, his prayers return to the standard psalms in all five books of Tehillim...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Marcus then listed the unique or almost-unique words used by Yonah and noted where the uncommon phrases appeared elsewhere in the Tanach, as well as showing where Yonah used phrases from Tehillim. One of the words he noted was וימן, as well as several other words and phrases.</p>\n<p>The gist of this idea is that Yonah's usage of this word, as well as other terms, reflects his own unique linguistic background, as a person who came from the northern Zebulonite town of Gath-Chepher in a heavily Phoenician-influenced region, while at the same time being drawn to Judahite Hebrew as he picked it up while visiting Yerushalayim. This is demonstrative of the statement the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.89a.19?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 89a</a> put in the mouth of King Yehoshafat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כָּךְ מְקוּבְּלַנִי מִבֵּית אֲבִי אַבָּא: סִיגְנוֹן אֶחָד עוֹלֶה לְכַמָּה נְבִיאִים, וְאֵין שְׁנֵי נְבִיאִים מִתְנַבְּאִים בְּסִיגְנוֹן אֶחָד.\"</p>\n<p>\"This is the tradition that I received from the house of the father of my father: A prophetic vision relating to one and the same subject matter may appear to several prophets, but two prophets do not prophesy employing one and the same style of expression.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

That’s why Ashkenazim use a fish head at the meal, and why we do tashlich in rivers, which have fish.

Fish might be hidden, yes—but they also have strange, prominent eyes.

It is, however, extremely widely quoted that דבורה הנביאה was a גלגול of צפורה who didn't sing the שירה after קריעת ים סוף due to the fact that she only joined her husband משה afterwards. That's why she, as דבורה, sang שירת דבורה. See for example <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=67096&st=&pgnum=375&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ילקוט ראוביני פרשת שמות</a>. It is also brought widely that דבורה also was a גלגול of תמר who put herself into a situation of יחוד with יהודה which is why דבורה sat in an open place, תַּחַת־תֹּמֶר דְּבוֹרָה (with the word תומר written as תמר).

I was looking at how the Sofer who wrote the Sefer Torah stretched the letters and there was indeed a <em>lot</em> of stretching. The double-columns themselves were indeed beautifully justified, but the letters did look a bit weird. I understand that's subjective so I decided to do a bit of research as this is not my area of expertise.</p>\n<p>I had a look at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Lishkat_HaSofer.14?ven=hebrew%7CKeset_Hasofer,_Ungvar_1871&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לשכת הסופר י״ד</a>. It gives guidelines on stretching letters, and basically says a few things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>One may not stretch or shrink the width/height of the letter in a way that changes its normal form.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One may make small, aesthetic adjustments, particularly at the end of a line, in order to make the column justified.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Excessive stretching is not allowed, if it changes the letter's shape (e.g. turning a ר into something that looks like a ו).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The following letters can be stretched: Only those letters that have natural room for widening or lengthening without deforming: <code>א, ד, ה, ל, ק, ר, ת</code>, and sometimes <code>מ סתומה</code>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>How exactly can we know if they have been applied properly? They are a bit subjective, especially 2. I was seeing letters stretched to 3 or 4 times their normal length?</p>\n<p>Bonus question: which verses in the Torah are \"notoriously hard to justify\" due to a lack of \"beautiful letters\"? Any <em>soferim</em> here care to share their <em>safrut</em> woes, whether it be for a Sefer Torah, Mezuzah, Tefillin etc.?</p>\n\n\n",

Apparently his memory had yet to\nfail him, and he knew that God meant business. He had learned his\nlesson long ago, and made sure that the next time God came calling, if\nHe came calling, He would back down immediately and comply with the\ndivine will.</p>\n<p>Or, if the original Pharaoh had already died, he made sure that his\ndescendants learned the lesson and applied it when they were king.\nEither way, Pharaoh had changed his ways after losing everything at\nthe splitting of the sea.

When Jews repent, they have to utterly eradicate sin from their hearts and return to Hashem with love and inspiration, which is a very difficult process. <strong>Pagans only have to desist from sin</strong> (of which they have less to worry about), and this can be achieved by simple fear of punishment.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><sup>Based on research of Yosef Deutsch, Let My Nation Be Warned.

Come and see from Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who rebelled most grievously against the Rock, the Most High, as it is said, \"Who is the Lord, that I should hearken unto his voice?\" (Ex. 5:2). In the same terms of speech in which he sinned, he repented, as it is said \"Who is like thee, O Lord, among the mighty?\" (Ex. 15:11). The Holy One, blessed be He, delivered him from amongst the dead. Whence (do we know) that he died? Because it is said, \"For now I had put forth my hand, and smitten thee\" (Ex. 9:15). He went and ruled in Nineveh. The men of Nineveh were writing fraudulent deeds, and everyone robbed his neighbour, and they committed sodomy, and such-like wicked actions. When the Holy One, blessed be He, sent for Jonah, to prophesy against (the city) its destruction, Pharaoh hearkened and arose from his throne, rent his garments and clothed himself in sackcloth and ashes, and had a proclamation made to all his people, that all the people should fast for two days, and all who did these (wicked) things should be burnt by fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words,the king knew what it meant when a prophet showed up warning him that Hashem would destroy his people.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it permissible according to Halacha to look at women in such situations, as long as the intention is not for pleasure or attraction?</p>\n<p>Please include sources in your answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/9146\">Ask your Local Orthodox Rabbi</a> for practical p'sak to your individual situation. My answer is:</p>\n<h2>yes, so long as they are dressed appropriately</h2>\n<p>...but <strong><a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1734\">do not follow that as p'sak</a></strong>. Here's my justification:</p>\n<h4>General case for men looking at women</h4>\n<p>There are 3 types of looking for our purposes<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Leer: Looking lustfully.</li>\n<li>Gaze: Looking to enjoy beauty.</li>\n<li>Glance: Looking without either of the above. Just looking.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>One is <strong>not allowed</strong> to even glance (3) at the normally-covered parts of a woman's body (which is the basic halachic definition of \"erva\"/\"nakedness\", and includes also the hair of a married/widowed/divorced woman, and a woman's singing voice), even if one isn't trying to derive enjoyment from the glance<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>If the looking is \"leering\" or \"gazing\" (1 or 2) i.e. deliberate watching/staring, and the woman is forbidden to him, then it is forbidden <em>even if she is appropriately dressed</em> (if he knows her, then even if one isn't looking at <em>her</em>, but just looking at her clothes!)<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>With regards to all of this, known as \"<em>shemirat enayim</em>\" (guarding one's eyes), the consensus is it is <em>d'oraita</em><sup>4</sup>. See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments.47.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaMitzvot Negative Mitzvah 47</a><sup>5</sup>. All the more so if she is inappropriately dressed.</p>\n<p>It is based off of Bamidbar 15:39:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם אשר אתם זונים אחריהם</p>\n<p>Do not follow your heart and eyes after which you are going astray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.4.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 4:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someone who looks at forbidden women will think that there is no problem, since he will say: “Did I have intercourse or draw close to her?”  But he does not know that looking is a great sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h4>Exceptions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is permissible to look (3) at a woman when talking to her, if he does not do so for the purposes of enjoying her appearance<sup>2</sup>, and certainly he must not look at <em>ervah</em>. Following the advice of Rabbeinu Yonah in Sefer HaYira (starting from Vayetze mibeit hakneset), as a precaution one should minimise the looking to avoid improper thoughts coming against one's will.</li>\n<li>It is permissible for a male doctor to look (3) at a female patient, even her normally covered parts, as part of his examination and treatment - he is totally absorbed in his work and therefore the authorities permitted it<sup>6</sup>.</li>\n<li>We are less strict about gazing (2) at one's mother, daughter and sister, as well as any Jewish girl under the age of 11, although of course lustful thoughts are completely forbidden even here<sup>7</sup>.</li>\n<li>A man looking to marry may look at (2) and intentionally examine the beauty of his suitors, in order to determine if he finds them attractive. This is not only permitted, but fitting, as one is not allowed to marry someone he is not attracted to. Once this is determined he may continue looking at her while they continue to meet before marriage, but he must avoid deriving pleasure from her beauty<sup>8</sup>.</li>\n<li>One may look at one's wife (2) during the time of Niddah<sup>9</sup>, as she will become permissible to him soon so we are not worried about anything improper. However, he may not look at her nakedness i.e. parts that are normally covered, including her hair.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><sup>1 - Following Lift Up Your Eyes - R' S.

Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, the Tzaddik haEmet, teaches that forcing <em>limud Torah</em> or <em>kavana</em> during fatigue risks spiritual alienation. Instead, <strong>temporarily lighten intensity or pause</strong>, using <strong>hitbodedut</strong> (private meditation and prayer) or <strong>simcha</strong> (joy) to restore connection to Hashem. Don't fight the burnout; observe it, accept it as a benevolent messenger from your Shadow (see Carl Jung, the Tao, Buddhism, Alan Watts etc.) The <strong>Na Nach</strong> chant—“Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman”—<strong>lifts despair, reigniting passion</strong>!

Many modern scholars have proposed identifying Nechemiah ben Chushiel with an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nehemiah_ben_Hushiel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">actual figure</a> (i.e., that this was the real name of a historic figure), the nameless leader of the Jews in Eretz Yisrael in the early 7th century CE, circa the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine%E2%80%93Sasanian_War_of_602%E2%80%93628\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sassanian (Persian)-Byzantine War</a> of 602-628 CE (whence Yerushalayim was captured by the Persians in 614),<sup>1</sup> and later borrowed by Jews and repurposed as the name of Mashiach ben Yosef, based on historical memories of the greatness of the original namesake.</p>\n<p>I myself am skeptical that this was ever the name of an actual past historical figure. It seems more like a symbolical name, like the name Menachem ben Chizkiyah (מנחם בן חזקיה), the name of Mashiach ben David according to Chazalic sources, later transformed into Menachem ben Amiel (מנחם בן עמיאל). Menachem is well-known as one of the symbolic names of the Mashiach (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.98b.14?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 98b</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.2.4.12?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&qh=%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Brachot 2:4</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Eikhah_Rabbah.1.51?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&qh=%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbah 1:51</a>; etc), and Chizkiyah was the name of one of the most righteous kings of Am Yisrael, who was supposed to have been the Mashiach himself at one point (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.94a.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%97%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 94a</a>).<sup>2</sup> Nechemiah has the same connotation as Menachem: Comfort, consolation (נחמה). And Chushiel reminds me of the phrase \"בְּעִתָּהּ אֲחִישֶׁנָּה\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.60.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 60:22</a>) - a request from Hashem to speed up the redemption.</p>\n<p>Another figure mentioned in sources starting from the Zohar and later is Serayah ben Dan (שריה בן דן), who is supposed to be Mashiach ben Yosef's Chief of War (שר צבא, presumably meaning his righthand man) (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zohar%2C_Balak.13.179?vhe=hebrew%7CHebrew_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zohar Balak 194:2</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kol_HaTor.1.28?vhe=Kol_HaTor&qh=%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%93%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kol Ha'Tor 1:28</a>). Here, too, there are some messianic connotations in the \"ben Dan\" part. Already Chazal present a notion of a kind of \"Mashiach ben Dan\", so to speak (Shimshon was thought to be the Mashiach - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereshit_Rabbah.98.14?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 98:14</a>;<sup>3</sup> according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bamidbar_Rabbah.10.5?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 10:5</a> the Mashiach is a descendant of Dan on his mother's side, etc). My assumption is that also in the case of Serayah ben Dan, this was not the name of a real historic figure, but is symbolic (and unlike the prior two figures, I have not found suggestions to the contrary).</p>\n<p>Following that assumption, I was wondering whether there were any sources that explain the reasoning behind naming Mashiach ben Yosef and his assistant specifically these names. I mentioned some possible reasons for Nechemiah ben Chushiel, but these are just my own thoughts. Was \"Nechamiah\" chosen specifically to compliment \"Menachem\", or is there another reason? And why \"Chushiel\"? I also have no idea why specifically \"Serayah\" for the Danite. And do the two names (Nechamiah ben Chushiel and Serayah ben Dan) compliment each other somehow?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> This theory is so popular nowadays that it is presented as fact in the linked Wikipedia entry. However, the relevant historical sources that describe the period and mention the Jews of the time never actually refer to this person by that name (or any other name).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> However, like in the case of Nechemiah, scholars have proposed that the name Menachem ben Chizkiyah was also borrowed from a historic figure. Some propose <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menahem_ben_Judah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Menachem ben Yehudah ben Chizkiyah</a> the Galilean zealot of the 1st century CE (e.g., Yosef Klausner, <em>The History of the Second Temple Period</em>, vol. 5 [in Hebrew], pp. 148-149), and others propose a hypothetical son of Chizkiyah, Resh Galuta ca. the time of the Great Revolt (e.g., Yehuda Even Shmuel, <em>Midrashei Geulah</em> [in Hebrew], <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33218&pgnum=41\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pp. 47-49</a>).</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> It's been noted that this passage bears some similarities to Rabbi Akiva's pronouncement of Bar Kochva as the Mashiach. See e.g., <a href=\"https://jewish-faculty.biu.ac.il/sites/jewish-faculty/files/shared/JSIJ11/fogel.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>, pp. 85-86).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Which commentary says this\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a commentary who says, and I am paraphrasing, on Shabbos 23b, that the reason why the Gemara there says \"One who is careful to fulfill Mezuzah properly will merit to have a nice dwelling; one who is careful about Tzitzis will merit to have a nice garment;  One who is careful about Kidush ha'Yom will merit to have much wine\" is that these mitzvos are not mechuyav on a person, one can choose to live in a camper or something that doesn't require a mezuzah, one can wear a non-four-cornered garment and not have to put on tzitzis, one can make kiddush on bread rather than wine.  So midah k'neged midah, Hashem rewards him with extra things because he himself did more than was required.  Which commentary says this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meiri_on_Shabbat.23b.7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a> there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לעולם יהא אדם זריז לקיים את המצות ובקלה כבחמורה שאינו יודע מתן שכרן של מצות ומ\"מ יהא לבו סמוך שאין השם מקפח שכר כל בריה ושמדתו לשלם מדה כנגד מדה דרך הערה אמרו הרגיל בנר חנוכה דרך חבוב מצוה ובהערה מפורסמת הויין לו בנים תלמידי חכמים לקיים עליו נר מצוה ותורה אור הרגיל במזוזה זוכה לדירה נאה הזהיר בציצית זוכה לטלית נאה הזהיר בקידוש היום זוכה וממלא גרבי יין וכל אלו מדה כנגד מדה וכל עוד שמרבה במצות שכרו מתרבה דרך הערה אמרו ובאחד מגדוליהם שראה באחד והיה רגיל בשתי נרות ר\"ל של חנכה ושל שבת בהדור ודרך חבוב ואמר גברי רברבי נפקי מהכא וראה באחד שהיה רגיל באחת בהידור ובחיבוב ואמר גברא רבא נפיק מהכא וכאשר פתר כן היה:</p>\n<p>A person should always be careful to perform the mitzvos - treating the light ones like important ones - because he doesn't know the reward for mitzvos, and nevertheless his hert should always rely upon the fact that Hashem doesn't deprive His creations from reward and His nature is to reward middah k'neged middah. As an example: They said \"one who regularly performs ner Chanukah in a loving and public way will have children who are Torah scholars,\" to fulfill in him the idea of \"the mitzvos are a candle and Torah is a light.\" [They say further that] \"one who regularly performs mezuzah will merit a beautiful home and one who is careful in tzitzis will merit a beautiful tali's and one who is careful in kiddush with merit to fill jugs of wine\" - all of these are middah k'neged middah. And the more one increases his mitzvos the more his reward increases. As an example, they said \"and one of them saw someone who would regularly use two candles\" - that is to say, for Shabbos and Chanukah - \"in a beautifying and loving way and said 'two great men will emerge from here.' And they saw someone who was did one [candle] in a beautifying and loving way and they said 'one great man will emerge from here.'\" And so it was.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the gemara doesn't only discuss voluntary mitzvos so I think that component of your paraphrase is fundamentally mistaken.</p>\n\n\n",

Because when the Mochin, brain, are tired (מִתְיַגְּעִים)</strong> then sleep recharges them.** During sleep the Mochin, mind, and hence the Neshama, soul, enters into Emunah, faith, as in (Job 3:23), \"<strong>New (chadashim)</strong> to the morning - great is Thy faith! (L. Moharan 35:3)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>There's many kinds of sleep. There's physical sleep which is good for the Mochin, brains. Some Torah learning is also a sleep relative to Dveikut (cleaving, communion) with the Blessed One, and that's learning Pashtei Oraita, basic levels of Torah.</strong> So someone that's constantly wrapped up in devotions to the Creator and his Mochin are <strong>tired</strong> due to so much Dveikut, he should study <strong>Pashtei Oraita.</strong> There's also <strong>sleep</strong> found in <strong>Masa uMatan b'Emunah (lit. commerce in faith)</strong> - when doing Masa uMatan b'Emunah then his Mochin i.e. his Neshama enters in Emunah and gets <strong>revitalized</strong> there and <strong>refreshed from its exhaustion</strong>, and he <strong>draws a new Sekhel, mind, from the Ohr haPanim, Light of the Face.</strong> The main point and the purpose is to carefully <strong>guard the Emunah</strong>. So when his Mochin, mind, is <strong>tired</strong> he needs to revive it in the Emunah through some kind of <strong>sleep</strong>, whether it's <strong>simple physical sleep</strong> which is when the Mochin are renewed as we can see tangibly, but <strong>again the main point and purpose is the Emunah, so before sleeping you need to attach yourself to the Emunah which this is the aspect of Kriat Shma She'al haMita that we recite before sleep.</strong> You need to read it with Kavana, intent, in order to hook up your Neshama and <strong>insert it inside the Emunah during sleep,</strong> and then your Nehsama will be <strong>revitalized</strong> in there, as in \"<strong>New</strong> to the morning, great is Thy faith!\" as mentioned. By <strong>sleeping</strong> you'll be able to get a <strong>new Sekhel, mind, and new Neshama, soul, from the Ohr haPanim.</strong> Likewise whoever has some kind of Dveikut and it has made his Moach <strong>tired</strong>, he needs to then occupy himself in <strong>Pashtei Oraita</strong> (simple Torah) and <strong>enter inside the Emunah while doing so.</strong> Meaning, since his Moach starts to get confused and he's no longer able to cleave to Hashem Yitbarakh in the aspect of Daat and Mochin, by way of mind and brain, mentally, then he needs to just <strong>remove his Daat and Mochin entirely and hook himself up to the Emunah in Pshitut and occupy himself in Pashtei Oraita in Temimut, simplicity, and Emunah Sheleimah.</strong> Because actually whenever you're maintaining your Mochin in Dveikut or any kind of level, even then <strong>the main thing that sustains the mind is Emunah, for \"you cannot rely on Sekhel, mind, alone\" [like we've explained above in #15].</strong> But when the mind goes away you need to <strong>enter into the Emunah alone, through some kind of sleep as mentioned.</strong> Similarly, doing <strong>commerce</strong> is sometimes a kind of <strong>sleep</strong> that can renew his Moach, as mentioned, and <strong>there too the main point and purpose is the Emunah, when he's doing commerce \"in Emunah;\"</strong> then his Neshama which is his Sekhel, mind, <strong>enters inside the Emunah and gets revitalized there as mentioned</strong> (Ibid. 4, 6).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Saying Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman</h2>\n<p>Saying Rebbe Nachman's new name NNNNM, and blasting Nanach music and dancing, can only help and can't hurt, per Saba.</p>\n\n\n",

And it is proper to be stringent in accordance with this opinion (this is the view of the Shelah).</p>\n<p>And so too, the custom in our times is to recite then Tefillah Zakkah (‘Pure Prayer’).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, it is Erev Yom Kippur where we are about to go into a day where our year ahead will be decided. We are in a state where our very existence is \"hanging in the balance\"<sup>1</sup>. If G-d forbid a person were to choke etc. they would not have had the chance to confess their sins and help bring about a proper teshuva, and as such it is more significant than an every day scenario.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As per the wording of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.16b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 16b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי כְּרוּסְפָּדַאי אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: שְׁלֹשָׁה סְפָרִים נִפְתָּחִין בְּרֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה, אֶחָד שֶׁל רְשָׁעִים גְּמוּרִין, וְאֶחָד שֶׁל צַדִּיקִים גְּמוּרִין, וְאֶחָד שֶׁל בֵּינוֹנִיִּים. צַדִּיקִים גְּמוּרִין — נִכְתָּבִין וְנֶחְתָּמִין לְאַלְתַּר לְחַיִּים, רְשָׁעִים גְּמוּרִין — נִכְתָּבִין וְנֶחְתָּמִין לְאַלְתַּר לְמִיתָה, <strong>בֵּינוֹנִיִּים — תְּלוּיִין וְעוֹמְדִין מֵרֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה וְעַד יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים</strong>, זָכוּ — נִכְתָּבִין לְחַיִּים, לֹא זָכוּ — נִכְתָּבִין לְמִיתָה.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kruspedai said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Three books are opened on Rosh HaShana before the Holy One, Blessed be He: One of wholly wicked people, and one of wholly righteous people, and one of middling people whose good and bad deeds are equally balanced. Wholly righteous people are immediately written and sealed for life; wholly wicked people are immediately written and sealed for death; <strong>and middling people are left with their judgment suspended from Rosh HaShana until Yom Kippur</strong>, their fate remaining undecided. If they merit, through the good deeds and mitzvot that they perform during this period, they are written for life; if they do not so merit, they are written for death.

The gemara in Yerushalmi Yoma 6:1 says that two teachers had an argument if you could wear socks, and Rav Chisda explain that the one that said you could go out, was talking about normal socks, and the other one was talking about leather socks. The main thing is you wear that something that doesn't protect from the elements.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mishnah Berura 614:5\nמ\"מ מי שאפשר לו נכון להחמיר בזה ולילך באנפלאות של בגד כנהוג\nNevertheless, if it is possible for him (if he is able) it is correct to act  <strong>stringently</strong> and walk in socks of cloth, as is the custom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see that it is actually better to wear socks and slippers etc. The mishna Berura 91:11 allows to Daven with socks, and it is not considered \"barefoot\"</p>\n\n\n",

I can’t find any online image of the page, but this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmRSEaWplto\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Youtube video</a> contains a comparable image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MFlj4gpB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/MFlj4gpB.jpg\" alt=\"The Te'amtzeinu passage in a Machzor\" /></a></p>\n<p>You can see something in this image which is also true of my Machzor. Each line begins Hayom, followed by a word that begins with a Tav. From one line to the next, the Tav is followed by letters that (at first) suggest an alphabetical progress. The first four lines follow Hayom with Te’amtzeinu (Aleph), Tevarcheinu (Beis), Tegadleinu (Gimel) and Tidresheinu (Dalet). But the next lines in my Machzor follow Hayom with Tishma (Shin), Tekabeil (Kuf) and Tismecheinu (Sav), letters near the end of the alphabet but not consecutive in the alphabet. I would assume that this reflects an original, properly alphabetical Piyut that was somehow transmogrified to this.</p>\n<p>The trouble is, there’s something similar in the daily prayers.</p>\n<p>Each morning, just before the Shema, my Chabad siddur contains the line Kulam Ahuvim, Kulam Berurim, Kulam Giborim, Kulam Kedoshim, Vechulam Osim… Vechulam Poschim… This quoted passage begins on the fourth line of type in the following image. Once again, there’s a gesture toward alphabetical progress that fizzles into letters late in the alphabet but not consecutive: Aleph, Beis, Gimel, Kuf, Ayin, Peh. (Again, this image is one I found online for a fairly close depiction of my Siddur.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qwp0KrnZ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Qwp0KrnZ.jpg\" alt=\"The Kulam Ahuvim passage in a Siddur\" /></a></p>\n<p>What explains these halfhearted devices?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the comentary on artscroll's machzor.\nSome machzorim do have all 22 lines with all the aleph beis, but no one says them.

    "content": "# Who is a part of Israel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many sections in the Torah where it reads to me like the umbrella of who God accepts as part of Israel is bigger than we are comfortable with. For example on Shabbat we learn that not only can we not work, but our slaves, maidservants, animals, etc. Most of the commentators frame this as instructing Israel to give other groups time off or to emulate God. Whereas to me it reads like slaves and animals become part of Israel by living with us and therefore they are entitled to similar rights such as not working on Shabbat. Just as one example: An animal example is God claims the right to the firstborn of Israel, whether human or animal. Could it be considered that the animal is now a part of Klal Yisrael?</p>\n<p>The Gemara also brings down in Berakhot 2a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צְרִיכִי, דְּאִי תְּנָא לוֹקֵחַ — הֲוָה אָמֵינָא מִשּׁוּם דְּקָא\nמַיְיתֵי לַהּ לִקְדוּשָּׁה, אֲבָל מוֹכֵר דְּקָא מַפְקַע לַהּ\nמִקְּדוּשָּׁה — אֵימָא לִיקְנְסֵיהּ, קָא מַשְׁמַע לַן.  The Gemara\nexplains: All of these examples are necessary. As, had the tanna\ntaught that a donkey is exempt from the obligations of firstborn\nstatus only in the case where a Jew purchases a fetus from a gentile,\nI would say that this is because the Jew brings it to a state of\nsanctity in that it will not be worked on Shabbat. But in the case\nwhere a Jew sells the fetus of his donkey to a gentile, where he\nabrogates its state of sanctity, I would say that the Sages should\npenalize him [likneseih] for his actions by rendering the fetus\nsubject to the obligations of firstborn status. Therefore, the mishna\nteaches us that it is exempt from these obligations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi comments</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גמ' מייתי לה לקדושה – “The Gemara brings it to holiness” – meaning:\nthat the animal is brought under a category of sanctity,</p>\n<p>שתהא שובתת בשבת – “that it should rest on Shabbat.”</p>\n<p>וכיון דמצוה עביד – “And since he is performing a mitzvah (by ensuring\nthe animal rests on Shabbat),”</p>\n<p>ליכא למיקנסיה – “there is no reason to penalize him.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A human example is the longstanding custom to convert your slaves, who often then practice Judaism upon being freed. Were they a part of Israel even while slaves? Is that why they receive Shabbat off?</p>\n\n\n",

More than that, they might create an image for others to know them by (e.g. a profile picture or avatar that is not a photo of them), and perhaps even a full on personality/persona.</p>\n<p>I believe the Torah is likely to have plenty of material that would be relevant to helping me understand what sort of effects this may have had on the collective human psyche. There may even be some useful halachic discussions, or interesting Kabbalah/Mussar discussions on the topic of names that is relevant. For instance, there's a question here about the custom of naming Rabbonim after their most popular Sefer. That topic might be relevant?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>My guess is that giving ourselves names is overall not the greatest thing because it can feed narcissism, or at least self-absorption, and destroy <em>bittul</em> and <em>anivut</em>.

    "content": "# How to understand the aggada of non-Jews testifying that the Jewish people kept the whole Torah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Avoda Zara 3a there is an aggadic tale wherein God calls on representatives of the non-Jewish nations to testify that the Jewish people have kept the whole Torah. The relevants parts are excerpted here</p>\n<p>אֶלָּא כָּךְ אוֹמְרִים הַגּוֹיִם לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם, יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁקִּיבְּלוּהָ הֵיכָן קִיְּימוּהָ?\n...\nאָמַר לָהֶם הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: מִכֶּם יָבֹאוּ וְיָעִידוּ בָּהֶן בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁקִּיְּימוּ אֶת הַתּוֹרָה כּוּלָּהּ, יָבֹא נִמְרוֹד וְיָעִיד בְּאַבְרָהָם שֶׁלֹּא עָבַד עֲבוֹדָה זָרָה, יָבֹא לָבָן וְיָעִיד בְּיַעֲקֹב שֶׁלֹּא נֶחְשַׁד עַל הַגָּזֵל, תָּבֹא אֵשֶׁת פּוֹטִיפֶרַע וְתָעִיד בְּיוֹסֵף שֶׁלֹּא נֶחְשַׁד עַל הָעֲבֵירָה.\nיָבֹא נְבוּכַדְנֶצַּר וְיָעִיד בַּחֲנַנְיָה מִישָׁאֵל וַעֲזַרְיָה שֶׁלֹּא הִשְׁתַּחֲווּ לַצֶּלֶם, יָבֹא דָּרְיָוֶשׁ וְיָעִיד בְּדָנִיֵּאל שֶׁלֹּא בִּיטֵּל אֶת הַתְּפִלָּה, יָבֹא בִּלְדַּד הַשּׁוּחִי וְצוֹפַר הַנַּעֲמָתִי וֶאֱלִיפַז הַתֵּימָנִי וֶאֱלִיהוּ בֶּן בַּרַכְאֵל הַבּוּזִי וְיָעִידוּ בָּהֶם בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁקִּיְּימוּ אֶת כָּל הַתּוֹרָה כּוּלָּהּ, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״יִתְּנוּ עֵדֵיהֶם וְיִצְדָּקוּ״</p>\n<p>The upshot of this discussion is that certain non-Jews can be expected to testify that they knew of certain Jews who kept certain mitzvot.\nI would like to understand the logic of this argument which seems to have the following issues</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The issue at stake is that the entirety of the Jewish people possibly did not keep the Torah they accepted and thus the non-Jews deserve a chance to receive the Torah as well. None of the testimony offered is about the Jewish nation as a whole, rather it is about select individuals. I don't see how such testimony bears on the discussion at all</li>\n<li>How does the testimony of Nimrod, Lavan or the wife of Potiphar have any bearing on the discussion when all of the incidents in question took place before the giving of the Torah?</li>\n<li>Even granting all of the testimony is relevant and compelling, could not the nations of the world offer a strong rebuttal that the prophets themselves constantly berate the Jewish nation for failure to keep the Torah, including statements from prophets like Ezekiel which indicate that the leaders of the people who may themselves be righteous are held accountable for not exerting more influence on the general populous to repent and adhere to the Torah?</li>\n<li>How are we to understand the reference to Iyov's friends? Even assuming Iyov was Jewish (itself a disagreement in the Talmud) Iyov's friends actually spend their time accusing Iyov of sinning in some capacity as an explanation for his suffering. Furthermore the quote in the aggada does not come from them (or even from the book of Iyov!).</li>\n<li>Lastly, the logic of this overall argument could be used in reverse, the nations of the world could say that they have individuals over the course of history who have in fact kept the 7 Noahide laws, which if that is the only criteria necessary, would entitle them to receive the Torah as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given what appears to me to be extensive issues with the internal logic of this aggadah I would like to know if any commentaries or scholars address any of these issues or offer a way to read this story that removes these problems.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why does Onkelos translate הַשִּׁירָ֖ה to תּוּשְׁבַּחְתָּא instead of שִׁירָתָא?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the end of the parashas Vayelekh, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.31.30?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 31:30</a>, Moshe Rabbeinu refers to the song הַשִּׁירָ֖ה, which is the song Haazinu starting in the next verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.32.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 32:1</a>. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Deuteronomy.31.30?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Onkelos translates</a> the word הַשִּׁירָ֖ה as תּוּשְׁבַּחְתָּא in Aramaic. While according to Jastrow, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%AA%D6%BC%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%A9%D6%B0%D7%81%D7%91%D6%B7%D6%BC%D7%97%D6%B0%D7%AA%D6%B8%D6%BC%D7%90?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">תּוּשְׁבַּחְתָּא</a> has also a meaning <em>song</em>, it is not the main meaning of the word which also means <em>praise</em>, <em>glory</em>. We also see this difference in the well-known line of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Kaddish%2C_Kaddish_d%27Rabbanan.8?ven=hebrew%7CDaat_Siddur_Ashkenaz&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kadish</a> that has both words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לְעֵלָּא מִן כָּל בִּרְכָתָא וְשִׁירָתָא תֻּשְׁבְּחָתָא וְנֶחֱמָתָא דַּאֲמִירָן בְּעָלְמָא.</p>\n<p>Above every blessing and song, praise and consolation that are said in this world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted by @DoubleAA, the same translation occurs also in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Exodus.15.1-2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 15:1 -2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Onkelos_Numbers.21.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 21:17</a>. Why does Onkelos translate הַשִּׁירָ֖ה to תּוּשְׁבַּחְתָּא instead of שִׁירָתָא, given that it's not seemingly the best translation? Is there a midrashic source for this translation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><em>Lechem V'Simlah</em> on Onkelos, Shemot 15:1 <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5997&st=&pgnum=113\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"שבח - כל שיר ורנה והלל תרגומם שוה בלשון שבח, ובעברית הוא רק ל' הלול וכן ושפתי ישבחונך כמו ישבחו אותך ולא ביחס שאליו ישבחו לך, וכן השם שירה מתורגם גם באונקלוס ותושבחתא ומה שנמצא בל' הקדיש שירתא תושבחתא נראה כי הוא מושאל מלשון העברי אשר בו הם שמות נרדפים שיר ושבחה וכן בתיוב\"ע בזה ית שבח שירתא.\"</p>\n<p>\"Shevach - every song, joy and praise are equally translated as \"Shevach\" (praise), and in Hebrew it only means \"praise\", and it is similarly written \"(and) My lips declare Your praise\" like they will praise You and not towards You who they will praise, and so the term \"Shirah\" (song) is also translated in Onkelos as \"V'Tushbechata\", and that which we find in the Kaddish \"Shirata v'Tushbechata\" it seems that this is a borrowing from the Hebrew language, where the synonyms \"Shir\" (song) and \"Shevacha\" (praise) are found, and so too in Targum Yonatan ben Uziel (=Pseudo-Jonathan) \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Targum_Jonathan_on_Exodus.15.1?ven=hebrew%7CTargum_Jonathan_on_Exodus&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yat Shevach Shiratah</a>\" (This praise-song).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following Lechem V'Simlah, Rabbi Binyamin Posen wrote in <em>Parshegen</em> on Shemot 15:1, p. 257, § 5 that the many different words meaning \"song\" in Hebrew were consistently translated in Aramaic as \"Shevach\" because of the lack of relevant synonyms in Aramaic (מחמת דלות הלשון הארמית).

It is also the 29th day of the month in Jerusalem. You don't know if the first day of the next month is tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. If the spotters in Jerusalem spotted the new moon on the evening of the 29th, then the next day would be Tishri 1. But the Jews in Babylon wouldn't know that the 29th day was the last day of the month, so they would consider the next day the 30th of the month and not celebrate Trumpets until the day afterward (Tishri 2 in Jerusalem).</p>\n<p>How does keeping the Feast of Trumpets two days in Babylon make them keep the day correctly?</p>\n<p>If I understand correctly,</p>\n<p>If it was Nisan 29 in both Babylon and Jerusalem the same day, would the Jews in Babylon celebrate the next day as Iyar 1? If the spotters in Jerualem spotted the crescent on the evening of Nisan 29, then the next day would be Iyar 1. Is that how it works?</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Jews in Babylon, would celebrate Nisan 30 as the first day of the month and the next day Iyar 1 and in effect they would have celebrated the first of the month would be celebrated two days in a row, right? Later, when word from Jerusalem reached Babylon, they would then “correct” with the right day of the month. Is this correct?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Explanation for the BeShT insulting his disciples?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During studying towards the upcoming holy days, I encountered two stories about the BeShT insulting his disciples.</p>\n<p>The first story is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shivchei_HaBesht.15.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שבחי הבעש\"ט ט\"ו</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פ\"א ביום הכיפורים בהשכמה לא בא הבעש\"ט לבית המדרש כפי המנהג ביה\"כ להתפלל בהשכמה. והיה שוהה עד בוש על היום והמתינו עליו מלהתפלל ואח\"כ בא וישב על מקומו והיה ראשו על הסטענדר מקים ראשו ומניח ראשו מקים ומניח כמה פעמים. ואח\"כ רמז שילכו להתפלל לפני התיבה ובא ר' דוד הנ\"ל להתפלל כי הוא היה מתפלל בימים נוראים וכשבא סמוך לתיבה התחיל הבעש\"ט לבזותו בפני כל עם ועדה ואמר בזה הלשון. <strong>זקן אשמאי היכן אתה הולך וביזה וגינה אותו ערך חצי שעה</strong> והיה רוצה לחזור ולילך מן העמוד כי היטב חרה עד מאוד כי אמר שמא ח\"ו ראה בי דבר מגונה. וגער עליו ואמר. עמוד והתחיל להתפלל ובכה ולא היה יודע מה שהוא מדבר רק שצעק ובכה כי שבר לבו מאוד. ואח\"כ במוצאי יה\"כ הלך ר' דוד מ\"מ ז\"ל אל הבעש\"ט ואמר לו רבינו מה ראית בי דבר מגונה ח\"ו ענה ואמר ח\"ו לא ראיתי בך כלום רק באשמורת ראיתי להס\"ס על הדרך מקום שהתפילות הולכים לקבל כל התפילות ח\"ו. ואמרתי בלבי למה אלך להתפלל ולמסור לו התפילות ח\"ו וע\"כ שהיתי מלהתפלל. ות\"ל פניתי דרך אחד שילכו התפלות בזו הדרך ולא יוכל לאחוז בהם וע\"כ יראתי פן ח\"ו יכנוס בלבך ויקלקל ח\"ו הדבר ושברתי את לבך בכדי שלא יהיה בך שום מחשב זרה בלבך ואח\"כ צויתי לך להתפלל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second story is from a much less reputable source, called שופרא דיעקב, עמ' תרי (the source can be found in Otzar HaHochma):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פעם בראש חודש אלול נתוועדו יחד חמשה מתלמידי הבעש״ט ה\"ה ר׳ אליעזר כהנא מקארלין, ר׳ דוד ממיקלאיוב, ר׳ דוד פירקוס, ר׳ דוד מקאלימייא, ור' דוד לייקעס, והחליטו ביניהם לפעול\nיחד כל החדש אלול ועשרת ימי תשובה בפרישות וקדושה בתעניות ותפילות ביחודי שמות הק' המיוחדים לקרב קץ הגאולה, וגמר העבודה תהיה בעבודת יום הכיפורים על פי כוונות יחודים הערוכות על פי ח\"ן המסוגלים לביאת המשיח, ויהיו מסורים לבעל המוסף ר׳ אליעזר מקארלין שהיתה לו חזקה לתפילת המוסף בבית המדרש של הבעש״ט, וכל אלו ההכנות היו נעשות בהסתר גדול שאפילו מלאכי מעלה לא ידעו מהן. ובהגיע יום הכיפורים אחרי קריאת התורה עלה ר׳ אליעזר כדרכו מאז לקחת הספר תורה ולומר יהללו, אז קרא אליו הבעש״ט ממקומו ויאמר <strong>איך זה ירהיב איש לגשת ולעבור לפני התיבה לפני קהל קדוש כזה, מה יתרון ראה בעצמו ומה מצא בקרבו להיות ראוי לכך, ואם גם הוא מלא מסתרים איך יגבה להיות שליח ציבור כזה</strong>. ר׳ אליעזר התפחד לקול מורו ורבו והתחיל לסגת אחור ולרדת מן הבימה ברוב דיכוי הנפש ושבר לב, אך אז קרא אליו הבעש״ט ואמר לו: ועתה שוב וקח הספר הק׳ ועבור לפני התיבה לתפלת המוסף. ר׳ אליעזר עשה כן, ברם נלקחה ממנו כל גדלות המוחין שלו והתפלל בלי כל הכוונות\nשהכין לו, ובאותה השנה נפטר ר׳ אליעזר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two stories have a moral justification, by which the disciple ego had to be broken, not because it was full of pride, but because its ideal state is humility.</p>\n<p>However, what is the justification to violate the prohibition of מלבין פני חברו ברבים as well as אונאת דברים?</p>\n\n\n",

Also, is there anyone who disagrees?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to the Rosh and most of the Rishonim, one who was awake all night, as on Shavuot night, may not recite Birkot HaTorah before Shacharit, because as long as he did not interrupt by sleeping, the previous day’s Birkot HaTorah still apply. That is how many eminent Acharonim rule (Pri Chadash, Gra, Chayei Adam). According to Rabbeinu Tam, however, he must recite Birkot HaTorah before Shacharit. Since Birkot HaTorah are intended to last for a 24-hour period, even if he did not sleep at all during that whole day, when the time arrives to recite Shacharit the next day, he must recite Birkot HaTorah again. That is what is said in the name of the Arizal, and that is the minhag of the Sephardim (Birkei Yosef 46:12; Ben Ish Chai, Berachah 3; Kaf HaChaim 47:26).</p>\n<p>In order to avoid uncertainty, it is preferable that someone who did not sleep at night hear someone else recite Birkot HaTorah, thereby fulfilling his obligation according to all opinions.</p>\n<p>If he cannot find someone who needs to recite Birkot HaTorah, according to the minhag of the Sephardim and some of the Ashkenazim, he should recite Birkot HaTorah himself. According to the minhag of the majority of Ashkenazim, he should have kavanah to fulfill the obligation of Birkot HaTorah in Ahavah Rabbah before Shema (Mishnah Berurah 47:28), for we have already learned (in halachah 2) that this berachah is considered like Birkot HaTorah. After praying he must learn a verse of scripture or a Mishnah in order to adjoin his learning to the berachah.[8]</p>\n<p>Regarding that same person who stayed awake all night, if he slept a regular sleep during the day prior to that, according to all opinions he must recite Birkot HaTorah before reciting Shacharit.[9] (See earlier in this book 9:6 for a summary of the laws concerning one who was awake all night.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/02-10-07/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link to source</a></p>\n\n\n",

The perplexity lies in the fact that the commandment of an oath is not one of the Seven Noahide Laws.\nI find this even more difficult regarding the oath at Mount Sinai, which is the very foundation of accepting the Torah. After all, as long as they had not yet received the Torah, they were not commanded concerning oaths. Furthermore, even if they had been commanded, the power of an oath stems from the commandment \"He shall not profane his word.\" How is this warning any different from other warnings in the Torah? And what power does the oath add to the Torah's warnings, given that the oath itself is also merely a warning?\n<strong>Therefore, it seems clear that when one swears to another, this is a compelling reason to fulfill it, and no [additional] warning is needed.</strong> This applies to the oaths of Abraham, Isaac, and Eliezer, and similarly to one who swears to the Holy One, blessed be He.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R Elazar Moshe Horowitz already waxed poetic about it in his Responsa <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21025&st=&pgnum=147&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohel Moshe 138</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Who had the authority to label a particular prophet as kosher?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is how Rambam lays it out in the <a href=\"https://rambam.alhatorah.org/Full/Yesodei_HaTorah/10.1#e0ne\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">last chapter of Yesodei haTorah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any prophet who arises and tells us that God has sent him does not have to prove himself by performing wonders like those performed by Moses, our teacher, or like the wonders of Elijah or Elisha, which altered the natural order. Rather, the sign of the truth of his prophecy will be the fulfillment of his prediction of future events, as implied by Deuteronomy 18:21: “How shall we recognize that a prophecy was not spoken by God?...” Therefore, if a person whose progress in the service of God makes him fit for prophecy arises and claims to be a prophet — if he does not intend to add to or diminish the Torah, but rather to serve God through the mitzvot of the Torah — we do not tell him: “Split the sea for us, revive the dead, or the like, and then we will believe in you.” Instead, we tell him, “If you are a prophet, tell us what will happen in the future.” He makes his statements, and we wait to see whether his prophecy comes to fruition or not. Should even a minute particular of his prophecy not materialize, he is surely a false prophet. If his entire prophecy materializes, we should consider him a true prophet. We should test him many times. If all of his statements prove true, he should be considered to be a true prophet, as I Samuel 3:20 states concerning Samuel, “And all of Israel, from Dan to Beersheba, knew that Samuel had been proven to be a prophet unto God.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Maybe they are seen as legitimate by some groups but not others.</p>\n<p>I'm NOT asking if the Karaim are seen as Jews, but if their traditions of only doing commands in the Bible without extensive rabbinic commentary is seen as a legitimate expression of Judaism.</p>\n<p>Also, corrections are welcome regarding any misunderstanding on my part of the Karaim, their traditions, or of any Jewish group.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>No. Rabbinic theology is based on a number of factors, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Leading sages have legal authority according to scripture, and violating their legal interpretations and enactments is forbidden.</li>\n<li>Many aspects of the Oral Law were received along with scripture, and were preserved by the sages of each generation; so a number of laws from the oral tradition are as strong as scriptural law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Karaites violate both: They reject Rabbinic authority, and reject the authenticity of our oral tradition. They believe that each person’s subjective interpretation of scripture is entirely valid, whether literalist or otherwise. Thus, their practices and theology are not a valid form of Rabbinic Judaism (and therefore not considered Judaism at all by Rabbinates).</p>\n\n\n",

I've heard the following already:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The most common: Doctors gain pride, hubris or some lack of <em>emuna</em> in Hashem. They start to believe in their own power, and less in Hashem's (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi%20on%20Kiddushin%2082a:8:8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ben%20Yehoyada%20on%20Kiddushin%2082a:2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei%20Agadot%20on%20Kiddushin%2082a:5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netzach_Yisrael.30.7?ven=hebrew%7CNetzach_Yisrael,_with_footnotes_and_annotations_by_Rabbi_Yehoshua_D._Hartman,_Machon_Yerushalyim,_1997&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal</a>).</li>\n<li>Doctors inevitably make mistakes, bad decisions, or similar and thus are responsible for a lot of bloodshed (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meiri_on_Kiddushin.80b.4?ven=hebrew%7CMeiri_on_Shas&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a>)</li>\n<li>Medicine is a dangerous practice, and this statement isn't necessarily against doctors but against the profession (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torat_HaAdam%2C_The_Gate_of_Malady%2C_The_Matter_of_Danger.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But I've also heard the occasional \"positive\" interpretation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It's not talking about practising doctors, but rather people who could be doctors but don't do so, and thus lose out on the great Mitzva of healing (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tur%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.336?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur</a>)</li>\n<li>It's not a practical statement but rather a meditation - every doctor should imagine that each one of his patients risks him going to Gehinnom if he messes up.

Any that are very clever and satisfying? Especially with regards to the \"<em>kasha</em> of the heart\" that many people seem to have about this: <em>we generally see doctors as particularly engaged in Mitzvot and trying to make the world a better place - people we should be very grateful to, and in awe of. Why such a seemingly harsh statement?</em></p>\n<p>[I know the latter is opinion based, but it's not <em>me'akev</em> - just a hint at what I would find the most interesting. The main question is I want more explanations of this difficult Chazal.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>טוב שברופאים לגהינום\nmeans those doctors who say only 17 (טוב) of the 18 Brachos of Shmoneh Esrei, omitting the brochah of רפאנו -- since they believe that healing is in their hands -- go to גהינום</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think the Rasbha says -if not him a different early Torah source- that it is because they make you come back for follow up visits when you really don't need to so that they can make money off you.</p>\n<p>A more positive explanation alleged to be said by Rav Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld is because when patients tell them that it is too difficult for them to take important measures for their, they are too empathic instead of insisting that they do so.</p>\n<p>Rashi on the mishna says an additional reason to the one quoted here. He should have healed poor people for free</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Akiva Eiger explains the it to mean the best of doctors will lead others to gehenom. Meaning the good traits of doctors. Sometimes they have to give painful treatment, or amputate limbs to save the person. But a regular person who does these things will go to gehenom.</p>\n\n\n",

It is better not to respond, \"Barukh Hu u-Barukh Shemo,\" which is essentially a custom, in order to prefer hearing the conclusion of the blessing properly, and respond with \"Amen,\" a response absolutely obligatory by law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The footnote to the <em>Yalkut Yosef</em> cites the Ben Ish Hai (Terumah #12) that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאם הש\"צ ממהר ולא ענו הצבור ב\"ה וב\"ש, כדי לענות אמן, העונש עליו</p>\n<p>If the prayer leader ​​rushes and the congregation does not answer \"Barukh Hu u-Barukh Shemo\" in order to answer Amen, the punishment is on him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Notably, some sages named here also appear in the Beit Shammai list, such as Rebbi. Another notable point is that the three explicitly named students of Hillel are missing: Yonatan ben Uziel, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai (who does appear in the Beit Shammai list; and indeed was a student of both), and [Rabban] Shimon ben Hillel.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>So, to this list should be added the above-three sages.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Some medieval sources refer to Hillel's son Shimon by the title rabban, though he does not appear with that title in Chazalic sources.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# time for starting evening shema (Yehoshua, Berakhot 2b)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Berakhot 2b the Gemara debates whether the starting time for Shema is determined by the priest (when he may eat his teruma) or by the poor person (when he eats his evening meal).</p>\n<p>Among the various baraitot (e.g. of Rabbi Meir, Rabbi Yehuda, Rabbi Ḥanina), Rabbi Yehoshua states: “From the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their teruma.”</p>\n<p>From what I understand, Rabbi Yehoshua sets the latest possible starting time (among these views).\nThe emergence of stars, after completely setting of sun.</p>\n<p>But in the Steinsaltz commentary I see the line:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“As if you say that the poor person is earlier, it would be impossible\nto establish a time earlier than that established by Rabbi Yehoshua.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My confusion: <strong>Why would it be “impossible to establish an earlier time” than Rabbi Yehoshua, if Rabbi Yehoshua is actually giving the latest time?</strong></p>\n<p>The whole text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And is the time of the poor person and the priest the same? The Gemara raises a contradiction to this approach from another baraita, in which other opinions regarding the time for the recitation of the evening Shema are cited. From when does one begin to recite the evening Shema?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From the time when the day becomes sanctified on the eve of Shabbat. This is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer, who established an earlier time for Shema. Rabbi Yehoshua, like our mishna, says: from the time when the priests are eligible to partake of their teruma. Rabbi Meir says: the time for the recitation of Shema begins before the priests were purified, from when the priests immerse themselves in order to partake of their teruma.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda said to Rabbi Meir: How is it possible that the time for the recitation of the evening Shema corresponds to the time of the priests’ immersion? Do the priests not immerse themselves during the day, so that with nightfall and the onset of a new day they will be purified? If so, how can that time be called night?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥanina says that the time for the recitation of the evening Shema begins when the poor person eats his bread with salt. But Rabbi Aḥai, and some say Rabbi Aḥa, says: from the time when most people recline at their meal during the week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The preceding was the text of the baraita. Returning to our question, if you say that the time of the poor person and the priest are one and the same, then the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina is identical to that of Rabbi Yehoshua. However, the fact that they are cited together indicates that they are not, in fact, the same. Rather, must one not conclude from this that the time for the poor person is separate and the time for the priest is separate? Since no objection is raised, the Gemara concedes: indeed, conclude from this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Having established that the time of the poor person and that of the priest are different, the Gemara seeks to determine: which one is later? The Gemara suggests that it is reasonable to conclude that the time of the poor person is later. As if you say that the poor person is earlier, it would be impossible to establish a time earlier than that established by Rabbi Yehoshua, unless we hold that night begins with sunset, in which case the opinion of Rabbi Ḥanina is identical to that of Rabbi Eliezer. Rather, must one not conclude from this that the poor person is later? The Gemara notes: indeed, conclude from this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Timeline and circumstances of \"Rabbi as leader\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In our community we sometimes discuss not only <em>who</em> should be the Rabbi, but also <em>whether we should have</em> a Rabbi at all.</p>\n<p>I would like to better understand the role of the Rabbi as a leader, and how that role has evolved over time. For example, in Second Temple times, the national leadership was the Sanhedrin — but were there also local sages (the forerunners of the 'Rabbis') who served in leadership roles within individual communities? If so, what did their leadership look like?</p>\n<p>In later periods, especially in Europe, it was common for a town or region to have a Rabbi as the <em>Mara d’Atra</em> — the communal halachic authority and leader — but not necessarily for an individual synagogue to have its own Rabbi. Rather, the Rabbi’s role was to adjudicate disputes, issue rulings, supervise communal standards, and represent the Jewish community to the outside world.</p>\n<p>So my question is: What is the historical development of the role of the Rabbi as a communal or local leader, from the time of the Second Temple through the medieval European model, and how did that evolve into today’s more synagogue-centered model of Rabbinic leadership?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does it mean that the nefesh'guf resides in the liver?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Gra and others, the nefesh which is the guf resides in the liver. What does it mean that the guf resides in the liver?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'll answer according to the Vilna Ga'on's contemporary (and disputant, but probably not on this), the Alter Rebbe (R' Schnuer Zalman of Liadi).</p>\n<p>This statement is explained in Likkutei Torah Pinchas (3rd Ma'amar) as follows:</p>\n<p>The statement in the Torah \"<strong>the life is in the blood</strong>\" (Devarim 12:23 \"הַדָּם הוּא הַנָּפֶשׁ\"; see also Vayikra 17:11, 14) is taken straightforwardly in Kabbalah due to the principle of \"the order of links in a chain\" (Seder Hishtalshelut). I.e. the body and soul exist on many planes of existence, like links in a chain, each one \"beyond\" the other.</p>\n<p>Note, that chain links pass through the adjacent links, and this is why they are used as the analogy here - in order for each part of the soul to connect to the parts above it and below it, there has to be a <strong>similarity/cross over</strong> between them. I'll give an example, and then show how it relates to the Nefesh and the blood, and then finally we can bring in the liver.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: the soul has <strong>emotions and intellect</strong>. They seem worlds apart! Yet we also know that they are directly connected - our emotions are born in our intellect. So, <strong>what is the similarity</strong>? Well, the highest aspect of emotion is \"like/don't like\" (Chesed and Gevura). The lowest part of the intellect is \"yes, or no?\" (Da'at). Thus, there is a similarity: yes = like, no = don't like. When the Da'at concludes yes, our heart is moved to like it. When it concludes no, our heart is opposed to it.</p>\n<p>That's how <strong>intellect overlaps with emotion</strong>! Da'at overlaps with Chesed and Gevura (as we know from the 4 pronged Shin on the Tefillin Shel Rosh - see Derech Mitzvotecha Mitzvat Tefillin).</p>\n<p>Da'at itself is below Binah, which is our left-brain analysis. This has a mode of \"agree, disagree\", and that's how Da'at \"overlaps\" with Binah. And so on.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, when it comes to the body and soul connection, we need something similar*. The lowest part of the soul is called the Nefesh, and it's the most \"physical\" aspect of the soul (it is described this way in the sources, as being a part of the physical world - see Derech Hashem 3). It needs to <strong>connect</strong> with the most \"spiritual\" part of the body, which is <strong>the heat of the blood</strong> (you can't see heat, only feel it, similar to a soul).</p>\n<p>So, finally we can explain why it is in <strong>the liver</strong> specifically. According to the sources, this is because the liver cleans and refines the blood. Blood gets its vitality from the food the body eats, but the food is not all useful for the vitality of creating this heat, so the liver is one of the final stages in the <strong>refinement of the blood</strong>, where it becomes purified to supply the rest of the body with <strong>vitality</strong>. Therefore it is the <strong>seat of the Nefesh</strong>, where the Nefesh first connects.</p>\n<p><sup>* it should be noted, as per the Rema on Orach Chayim 6:1, and Derech Mitzvotecha Shoresh Mitzvat HaTefilla 39, the leap from spiritual to physical is a truly wonderous miracle, far more of a leap than any other \"leaps\" in the Seder Hishtalshelut.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Multiple layers of literary creativity can be discerned within the text. It may be that the Zohar should be seen as the product of a <em>school</em> of mystical practictioners and writers, one that could have existed even before 1270 and continued into the early years of the fourteenth century. Certain texts, including the Midrash ha-Ne'elam [...] belong to the oldest stratum of writing. The main part of the Zohar [...] were indeed composed in the decades claimed by Scholem.<sup>2</sup> Work on the Zohar did not cease, however, with the turn of the fourteenth dentury or the passing of Moses de Leon. In fact, the author of the <em>Tiqqunei Zohar</em> and the <em>Ra'ya Meheimna</em>, see by Scholem as \"later\" addenda to the Zohar corpus, may represent the third \"generation\" of this ongoing school [...]\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But, it should be emphasized, as Green later noted himself (pp. 167-168), that this \"school\" of Zohar authors is purely hypothetical, based on literary analysis of the Zoharic texts.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I.e., that the Zohar was composed solely by Rabbi Moshe de Leon (Ramdal).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Ca. the time of Ramdal.</p>\n\n\n",

He does not become more perfect if all His creatures serve Him and comprehend Him as far as possible; nor would He lose anything if nothing existed beside Him. It might perhaps be replied that the service of God is not intended for God's perfection; it is intended for our own perfection,--it is good for us, it makes us perfect. But then the question might be repeated, What is the object of our being perfect? We must in continuing the inquiry as to the purpose of the creation at last arrive at the answer, It was the Will of God, or His Wisdom decreed it; and this is the correct answer. . . We remain firm in our belief that the whole Universe was created in accordance with the will of God, and we do not inquire for any other cause or object. just as we do not ask what is the purpose of God's existence, so we do not ask what was the object of His will, which is the cause of the existence of all things with their present properties, both those that have been created and those that will be created. . . This must be our belief when we have a correct knowledge of our own self, and comprehend the true nature of everything; we must be content, and not trouble our mind with seeking a certain final cause for things that have none, or have no other final cause but their own existence, which depends on the Will of God, or, if you prefer, on the Divine Wisdom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For Rambam all of nature and Torah has purpose (ibid 2:20, 3:20,25,26).</p>\n<p>God surely doesn't do anything for no reason or point so surely the universe has a reason for God bringing it into existence.</p>\n<p>What does Rambam mean when he asserts that creation is only the function of God's will and/or wisdom but that it doesn't have a purpose or point?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If it has a purpose, then why does He see value in that purpose?

But in places where it's more likely they really were walled cities - especially Tiberias and Hebron - many people read the Megillah on the 15th as well. Some even do all the Purim mitzvot on both days in these cities.\nThe uncertainty comes from two things: either we don't know if the city actually had a wall in Yehoshua's time (or if the wall was built after the houses), or we're not sure if the modern city is in the exact same spot as the ancient one.\nAnd yeah, you're spot on about Ramot, once they connected it to Yerushalayim, its status changed since it became part of the city.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Secularism in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was wondering if there are any aspects of life which Judaism considers not holy but secular (e.g. politics today)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I suspect a lot of this is a bit of a semantic question and can't truly be answered. With that out of the way, here's my answer to this question:</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.231?vhe=hebrew%7CMaginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chaim 231:1</a> lists several actions that one does throughout the course of the day that could switch between positive, negative, or neutral depending on one's thoughts and intentions. The implication being that the actions themselves are not inherently holy, but how one does them could turn it into a holy act, or leave it as a purely secular act (or even a negative one).</p>\n<p>Here's a small sample of the text (it gives multiple examples, but for the sake of brevity only quoting one. Loose translation is my own):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכל צרכי גופך יהיו כולם לעבודת בוראך או לדבר הגורם עבודתו שאפילו היה צמא ורעב אם אכל ושתה להנאתו אינו משובח אלא יתכוין שיאכל וישתה כפי חיותו לעבוד את בוראו</p>\n<p>And all bodily needs should be done in furtherance of serving G-D. For  example, even if someone was hungry and thirsty, if he ate with the sole intent of having enjoyment in the food, that is not praiseworthy. Rather, he should have the intention that the food and drink should give him strength to enable him to serve his Creator.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding your specific example (politics), that would probably most closely parallel the example the Shulchan Aruch gives regarding \"לישב בסוד ישרים\" - sitting amongst the righteous. The parallel being one can sit and discuss/philosophize any topic with a group of people, and can either turn it into a productive discussion session or a non-productive one. Of course, even without an exact parallel to one of the examples listed in the Shulchan Aruch, the idea remains true for all actions.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah_im_Derech_Eretz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<p>Rav S.R. Hirsch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Judaism is not a mere adjunct to life: it comprises all of life. To be a Jew is not a mere part, it is the sum total of our task in life. To be a Jew in the synagogue and the kitchen, in the field and the warehouse, in the office and the pulpit ... with the needle and the graving-tool, with the pen and the chisel—that is what it means to be a Jew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And from Wikipedia regarding study of so-called secular topics:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגר\"א, למשל, דיבר על נחיצותן של שבע החכמות החיצוניות. בהשראתו של רמב\"ם, טען הגר\"א כי ידיעת כל החכמות מסייעת לתורה: \"כפי שיחסר לאדם ידיעות משארי חוכמות, לעומת זה יחסר לו מאה ידות בחוכמת התורה, כי התורה והחוכמה נצמדים יחד\" \"כל החוכמות נצרכות לתורתנו\", כך שלימודי החול יכולים להוות חלק מתלמוד התורה. אך לפי פרשנותו של הרב יוסף קאפח על תפיסת רמב\"ם בעניין זה לא קיים ביהדות כלל מושג \"לימודי חול\" מול \"לימודי קודש\", אלא \"לימוד מועיל\" מול \"לימודי סרק\" כאשר \"לימוד מועיל\" אלה לימודי תורה ומדעי טבע ו\"לימודי סרק\" הם פחות או יותר</p>\n<p>The Vilna Gaon, for example, spoke of the necessity of the seven external sciences. Inspired by Maimonides, the Vilna Gaon maintained that knowledge of all the sciences assists in the study of Torah: “To the extent that a person lacks knowledge of other sciences, by that same measure he will lack a hundredfold in the wisdom of the Torah, for Torah and wisdom are bound together”; “All the sciences are necessary for our Torah”. Accordingly, secular studies can constitute a component of Torah study. However, according to Rabbi Yosef Qafih’s interpretation of Maimonides’ position on this matter, within Judaism there is no concept at all of “secular studies” versus “sacred studies,” but rather of “useful study” versus “vain study.” “Useful study” refers to Torah study and the natural sciences, while “vain study” is more or less…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also see <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32683&st=&pgnum=290&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n\n\n",

What was meant to be the most joyous of days is marked as shiva asar b'tammuz each year (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ta%27anit.4.6?vhe=hebrew%7CTorat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Taanis 4:6</a> amongst other sources).</p>\n<p>The second set of luchos followed and were brought down from Har Sinai on the day of Yom Kippur (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Exodus.34.29.1?ven=english%7CPentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi - Shemos 34:29</a>).</p>\n<p>Rabbi Hartman asked, this was a watershed moment in the history of klal yisroel, and yet it is not marked anywhere throughout the entire liturgy of Yom Kippur(!)</p>\n<p>Are there any sources that discuss why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is a very good question and can only suggest an answer, which is that we do not mention them because of the Midrashic principle that the reason why the second tablets endured is due to the fact that they were not given with \"public spectacle\", but quietly and without fanfare (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Ki_Tisa.31.2?vhe=hebrew%7CTsel_Midrash_Tanchuma&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma, Ki Tisa 31:2</a>). The first Luchot were subject to the \"evil eye\", but the second not (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.34.3?ven=hebrew%7CPentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a>).</p>\n<p>Therefore, we follow this principle, which is associated with modesty, by only hinting at the tablets. How do we hint at them?</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>All forgiveness comes from the second tablets, so the whole day is a testament to the \"power\" of the second giving of the Torah. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefat_Emet%2C_Deuteronomy%2C_For_the_Day_of_Atonement.7.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sfat Emet on Yom Kippur</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The second tablets were given with the 13 Middot Rachamim, which we say repeatedly on Yom Kippur. The Arizal notes that saying them invokes the original mercies of the Second Tablets at their giving. See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pri_Etz_Chaim%2C_Gate_of_Confession.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Etz Chaim, Sha'ar HaSelichot ch. 1</a>. See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.17b?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana 17b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: אִלְמָלֵא מִקְרָא כָּתוּב אִי אֶפְשָׁר לְאוֹמְרוֹ. מְלַמֵּד שֶׁנִּתְעַטֵּף הַקָּב״ה כְּשְׁלִיחַ צִבּוּר וְהֶרְאָה לוֹ לְמשֶׁה סֵדֶר תְּפִלָּה. אָמַר לוֹ: כָּל זְמַן שֶׁיִּשְׂרָאֵל חוֹטְאִין, יַעֲשׂוּ לְפָנַי כַּסֵּדֶר הַזֶּה, וַאֲנִי מוֹחֵל לָהֶם</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Were it not explicitly written in the verse, it would be impossible to say this, as it would be insulting to God’s honor. The verse teaches that the Holy One, Blessed be He, wrapped Himself in a prayer shawl like a prayer leader and showed Moses the structure of the order of the prayer. He said to him: Whenever the Jewish people sin, let them act before Me in accordance with this order. Let the prayer leader wrap himself in a prayer shawl and publicly recite the thirteen attributes of mercy, and I will forgive them. [Steinsaltz annotated translation/commentary]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li><p>We do note in our Mishna that Yom Kippur's joy is associated with the second giving of the Tablets and the meal we have on Erev Yom Kippur is directly associated with them. See Taanit 30:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל: לֹא הָיוּ יָמִים טוֹבִים לְיִשְׂרָאֵל כַּחֲמִשָּׁה עָשָׂר בְּאָב וּכְיוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים. בִּשְׁלָמָא יוֹם הַכִּפּוּרִים — מִשּׁוּם דְּאִית בֵּיהּ סְלִיחָה וּמְחִילָה, יוֹם שֶׁנִּיתְּנוּ בּוֹ לוּחוֹת הָאַחֲרוֹנוֹת</p>\n<p>§ The mishna taught that Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel said: There were no days as happy for the Jewish people as the fifteenth of Av and as Yom Kippur. The Gemara asks: Granted, Yom Kippur is a day of joy because it has the elements of pardon and forgiveness, and moreover, it is the day on which the last pair of tablets were given. [Steinsaltz annotated translation/commentary]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> They are only implicitly mentioned due to the principle of the importance of modesty, which is how they were given. Despite their giving being a monumental event, nonetheless the Giving of the Torah in general is celebrated on Shavuot, and here the theme is actually forgiveness and atonement, and this power does indeed come from their giving.</p>\n\n\n",

And then 49:6 talks about the nations bowing down to Hashem, possibly bowing to Israel. Is 49:5 talking about Isaiah? I don’t see how he was a light to the nations. It doesn’t seem to be Israel, because whoever it is “restores the survivors of Israel”. 49:6 seems to continue the thought from 49:5, and it almost seems to fit the future Messianic age where the nations bow to Israel.

Despite this, he finds consolation in the fact that G-d honoured his effort and recognized the sincerity and effort he put into his mission.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועתה,  מתחיל לבאר איך סבב ה' את פני הדבר שיהיה תועלת ושכר לפעולתו, אומר, ה' אמר לי, ה' אשר יצר אתי מבטן לעבד לו לשובב יעקב אליו,  ר\"ל הגם שהתכלית אשר בעבורו יצר אותי ה' מבטן לעבד לו, היה מיוחד רק לדבר פרטי ועבודה מיוחדת, שהוא לשובב יעקב אליו בתשובה, וישראל שהם הגדולים שבהם שא\"צ להחזירם בתשובה לו יאסף אפעול בתוכחה שיתאספו לו לעבוד אותו באגודה אחת שכם אחד, זה היה עקר עבודתי שיחד ה' לי מעת יצירתי, ובעבודה הזאת אמרתי כי לריק יגעתי כי לא השלמתיה כי ישראל לא שבו אל ה' ולא שמעו לתוכחתי, מ\"מ אחר כי ואכבד בעיני ה',  אחר שנכבדתי בעיני ה' ע\"י שראה רוב ההשתדלות והיגיעה שהיה לי, ואלהי היה עזי על ידי מעשי הטובים</p>\n<p>Now, he begins to explain how Hashem orchestrated the outcome of the matter so that there would be benefit and reward for his actions. He says, \"Hashem said to me, the Lord who formed me from the womb to be His servant, to bring Jacob back to Him.\"</p>\n<p>This means that although the purpose for which G-d formed me from the womb to serve Him was specifically for a particular task - a unique work, which was to bring back Jacob to Him in repentance - Israel, who are the great ones among them, do not require such repentance. He will gather them together through rebuke, so that they will unite to serve Him in one assembly, with one heart.</p>\n<p>This was the essential work that Hashem assigned to me from the moment of my creation. And regarding this task, I said that I had labored in vain, because I did not complete it, as Israel did not return to G-d and did not listen to my rebuke.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, after being honoured in the eyes of Hashem, after He saw the great effort and toil I had put forth, my G-d became my strength through my good deeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.49.5?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Isaiah.49.5.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a> there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועתה אמר ה׳ וכו׳. ר״ל ה׳ אשר מבטן יצר אותי להיות לו לעבד ללכת בשליחותו אמר לי עתה להשיב אליו את יעקב בתשובה ובעבור זה אהיה נכבד בעיני ה׳ ואף היה חזקי לבל יוכלו הרשעים להרע לי וכאומר כאשר חשב באחרונה כן אמר לי ה׳ שאף אם לא אועיל אהיה נכבד בעיניו וכן היה לי למעוז ולחוזק</p>\n<p>\"And now, says G-d...\": This means that Hashem, who formed me from the womb to be His servant and to carry out His mission, now tells me to return Jacob to Him through repentance.

Abba bar Korya said: He had engaged in the way of nature and he was sleeping. The Rabbis say: The Holy One blessed be He was taking him and circulating throughout the entire world [telling him]: ‘This is a good place to plant, this is a good place to sow.’ That is what is written: “In a land that no man has ever crossed, and where no person [adam] has ever dwelled” (Jeremiah 2:6) – Adam the first man did not dwell there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pirkei DeRebbi Eliezer 13:5 dicusses the Serpents plan</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דָּן דִּין נָחָשׁ בֵּינוֹ לְבֵין עַצְמוֹ וְאָמַר: אִם הוֹלֵךְ אֲנִי וְאוֹמֵר לְאָדָם, יוֹדֵעַ אֲנִי שֶׁאֵינוֹ שׁוֹמֵעַ לִי, שֶׁהָאִישׁ לְעוֹלָם קָשֶׁה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וְהָאִישׁ רַע מַעֲלָלִים״. אֶלָּא הוֹלֵךְ אֲנִי וְאוֹמֵר לְחַוָּה, שֶׁהָאִשָּׁה שֶׁאֲנִי יוֹדֵעַ שֶׁהִיא שׁוֹמַעַת לִי, שֶׁהַנָּשִׁים נִשְׁמָעוֹת לְכָל הַבְּרִיּוֹת, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״פְּתַיּוּת וּבַל יָדְעָה מָּה״.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The serpent argued with itself, saying: If I go and speak to Adam, I know that he will not listen to me, for a man is always hard (to be persuaded), as it is said, \"For a man is churlish and evil in his doings\" (1 Sam. 25:3); but behold I will speak to Eve, for I know that she will listen to me; for women listen to all creatures, as it is said, \"She is simple and knoweth nothing\" (Prov. 9:18).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The problem with most interpretations is that they don't ask the questions the text asks. Such as: How does the snake know what the tree of knowledge will do to Eve?</p>\n<p>I think most people accept the idea of the snake being Satan because it kind of answers that question by writing it off as secret knowledge by the adversary. This answer is not very satisfying.</p>\n<p>I believe the only way to understand this story is to read it literally and without putting any religious notions on it whether you are Jewish, Christian, or Muslim. I think we often make the mistake of not letting the Torah worldbuild because we're too preoccupied looking for lofty spiritual answers. I think if you let the logic of the text flow then the story is quite understandable but possibly not religiously satisfying to anyone.</p>\n<p>Josephus and Jubilees both state that all animals spoke one language with humans in the beginning. Jubilees makes the claim this ability was lost after Adam ate from the Tree. Abarbanel in his commentary to Genesis 3:1 says that the snake never spoke. Because the Torah lists punishments and taking away speech was not listed and it's the only one really worth mentioning. His answer seems to be addressing and defeating Jubilees and Josephus. But a rare book of tosafot collections called Moshav Zekenim says that the universal language that all life spoke was lost when all languages were confused in the Tower of Babel story. Which means that all animals spoke in the garden of eden story, the noahs ark story (I mean just logistically doesn't that story make so much more sense if all the animals and humans could talk to each other?), all the way up til the tower of Babel. This also explains why the Bible doesn't say God had to open the mouth of the snake to talk, but had to open the mouth of the donkey because it happens after the tower of Babel.</p>\n<p>We don't know if Abarbanel knew of this opinion from Moshav Zekeinim but he offers a fascinating alternative to talking animals that I argue answers the question of how the snake knows what the fruit does.</p>\n<p>According to Abarbanel Eve saw the serpent eat from the tree of knowledge day after day and it wasn't dying, which is what God told Adam would happen. From there the Torah is basically reflecting her inner monologue and she convinces herself the fruit looks good to eat. But Abarbanel still doesn't answer how the Serpent or Eve know what the tree does because God never says what it does, only that on the day the human eats of it he will surely die.</p>\n<p>I think Abarbanel is correct, the snake does eat the fruit day after day, and that's why the snake knows what the fruit does: because it did it to him. This also explains why there's wordplay with Arum/Nakedness happening.</p>\n<p>Genesis 2:25-3:8 (Abridged)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּֽהְי֤וּ שְׁנֵיהֶם֙ <strong>עֲרוּמִּ֔ים</strong> הָֽאָדָ֖ם וְאִשְׁתּ֑וֹ וְלֹ֖א\nיִתְבֹּשָֽׁשׁוּ׃</p>\n<p>The two of them were <strong>naked/arumim</strong>, the Human and his wife,</p>\n<p>yet they felt no shame.</p>\n<p>וְהַנָּחָשׁ֙ הָיָ֣ה <strong>עָר֔וּם</strong> מִכֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַשָּׂדֶ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה\nיְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־הָ֣אִשָּׁ֔ה אַ֚ף כִּֽי־אָמַ֣ר\nאֱלֹהִ֔ים לֹ֣א תֹֽאכְל֔וּ מִכֹּ֖ל עֵ֥ץ הַגָּֽן׃</p>\n<p>Now the serpent was\n<strong>the shrewdest/arum</strong> of all the wild beasts that God יהוה had made. It said\nto the woman, “Did God really say: You shall not eat of any tree of\nthe garden?”</p>\n<p>....\nוַתִּפָּקַ֙חְנָה֙ עֵינֵ֣י שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיֵּ֣דְע֔וּ\nכִּ֥י <strong>עֵֽירֻמִּ֖ם</strong> הֵ֑ם וַֽיִּתְפְּרוּ֙ עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה וַיַּעֲשׂ֥וּ</p>\n<p>לָהֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת׃</p>\n<p>Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they\nperceived that they were <strong>naked/arum</strong>; and they sewed together fig leaves and\nmade themselves loincloths.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The serpent knowing good from evil helps explain why he's Arum/Naked just like Adam and Eve become at the end of the story. It also explains how it was able to have the moral nuance to sway Eve with a single question and be punished by God as if an animal can be held morally responsible. It also explains how the donkey was able to plead a moral case against Balaam for striking her instead of knowing her better from a shared history together.</p>\n<p>I think the deeper message of the story is that the tree of knowledge makes you believe you know right from wrong. This knowledge is apparently allowed to God and animals, but not to humans. Something apparently really bad will happen if we believe we know right from wrong. Narratively it's not a shock when the next story is brothers killing each other and God has to wipe out humanity less than 10 chapters later. It seems the Torah was spot on: us believing we know right from wrong made really bad things happen.</p>\n<p>All this to say, the story is really about a snake who wanted to lead Eve astray. And it really just talked to her. And the story is more about how unified all life was, how the tree of life was offered to everyone unless humans ate from the tree of knowledge. Because can you imagine if the generation of Noah, the generation God had to wipe out, could live forever?</p>\n\n\n",

Jephthah's daughter was dedicated to serving God and remained a virgin.</li>\n<li>Jephthah made a foolish vow and foolishly carried it out. He should have gone to a priest to be released from his vow. Instead, he committed the crime of human sacrifice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The question: what do Jewish sources say on the topic?

But if so, why were Jephthah and his daughter so worked up about the vow?  Because, if a sacrifice wasn’t “appropriate”, the creature would still have to be consecrated to God.  So the daughter had to seclude herself in a house outside the city, in nun-like fashion.</p>\n<p>Later medieval commentators (such as Abravanel, Gersonides, or Malbim) agreed that Jephthah only consecrated his daughter to God as a virgin.  Indeed, the Bible says: “And he did to her as he had vowed. She had never known a man.” Why add that last comment? It must be because it is relevant.  However, asceticism and lifelong virginity are not encouraged in Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Ramban <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Dual/Ramban/Vayikra/27.29#m6e2n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> that he made a mistake and sacrificed her. He also quotes ibn Ezra that he dedicated her to God and never allowed her to marry or mingle with people, censuring it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this was the mistake that Jephthah made with his daughter. For he thought that just as a cheirem [\"doomed\" object] of the chief of Israel is valid and takes effect to put [certain] people to death, and [also] anyone who transgresses it is liable to the death-penalty, so [Jephthah thought] that if he uttered a vow at a time of war, to make an offering of a certain person or persons, the vow is valid; but he did not know that a cheirem declared by the king and Sanhedrin is valid [only] regarding the destruction of rebels, or against one who transgresses their decrees and ordinances. But that a vow should take effect to make a burnt-offering of something not appropriate for G-d, [as Jephthah thought] — Heaven forbid! Therefore the Rabbis have said in Bereshith Rabbah that [Jephthah] was not even obliged to pay the price of her market-value to the Temple treasury [as his vow was totally invalid], and he was punished for her [innocent] blood!</p>\n<p>Now do not let yourself be misled by Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra's empty words, when he says that the meaning of the expression and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering is \"or I will offer it up,\" as if to say: \"if that which comes forth of the doors of my house be a man or woman, that person shall be holy to G-d, inasmuch as he will abstain from the ways of the world, to stand to minister in the Name of the Eternal in prayer and thanksgiving to G-d; but if it be something fit for an offering, I will make it a burnt-offering.\" Accordingly [Ibn Ezra's interpretation continues, since Jephthah's daughter was the first to come out to meet her father], he built her a house outside the city where she resided in seclusion, and he provided her with sustenance all her days, and no man knew her, so that his daughter remained shut away [from the world all her life].</p>\n<p>All this are words of emptiness. For if he vowed that [whatsoever comes forth of the door of his house] shall be the Eternal's, this does not mean that he should be a recluse [from the world], but instead he is to be like Samuel, of whom his mother said, and I shall give him unto the Eternal, and he was a servant in the House of G-d, not a recluse. And according to the ordinances of the Torah, no man can utter a vow which will bind the persons who come out of the door of his house to live thereafter in seclusion, just as he cannot bring them as an offering. And if the matter be so [as Ibn Ezra put it] then Jephthah's daughter would be bewailing her virginity with her companions with her, like harlots enhancing their hire! Heaven forbid that this be a custom in Israel, to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year because she did not marry and she worshipped G-d in purity! Rather, this whole subject is to be understood in its plain meaning [that Jephthah actually brought her as an offering], and his mistake was as I have explained.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As in the view that it's better to accept the mitzvot without investigating the reasons, and discovering the reasons is only the second best option (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%99_(%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F)#%D7%9B%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kuzari 2:26</a>). Or the view that the mitzvot are intended to bring about a spiritual benefit (הענין האלהי) rather than a worldly benefit (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41560&st=&pgnum=78\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ran, Derashot 11</a>). Or the tendency to offer symbolic reasons instead of practical ones (as far as I can tell this is a tendency, not that anyone has actually claimed all the mitzvot are explicable only by mystical reasons and none by rational reasons; the Rambam also sometimes gives symbolic reasons, e.g. <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D_(%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F)/%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%92/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%9E%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">More Nevuchim 3:46</a>).</p>\n<p>As far as I know, the view that there are no reasons for the commandments doesn't exist among the Rishonim. This has been claimed, so it might be worth explaining the reason why I don't think it's correct. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24236724\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lorberbaum</a> believes that there was opposition to giving reasons for the commandments in the Rambam's time, based on his description in <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D_(%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F)/%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%92/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%9C%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">More Nevuchim 3:31</a> of people who would prefer that there would be no reason at all for the mitzvot (והטוב אצלם שלא יושכל למצוה ולאזהרה ענין כלל). This seems to me to be a misreading, because  firstly, the Rambam is describing a feeling or tendency, but not an articulated theory (חלי שימצאוהו בנפשם ולא יוכלו להגות בו ולא ידעו לומר אותו). Secondly, the Rambam says that the view that the mitzvot have a reason is the opinion of all Jews (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%9D_(%D7%90%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%9F)/%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%A7_%D7%92/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A7_%D7%9B%D7%95\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">More Nevuchim 3:31</a>). Apparently then this view is insignificant enough to be excluded from \"all Jews,\" if he meant it was a Jewish view at all. However, he also quotes the Rambam's commentators, such as Narboni, who identify this view with that of \"religious people\" (תוריים), which is more likely to be an actual Jewish view, but apparently not a view that has come down to us from a proponent.</p>\n<p>Lorberbaum also wants to identify this view that the mitzvot are unknowable with that of the Tur, and suggests that the Tur is possibly concerned that offering reasons for the commandments based on historical context (as the Rambam does in this case) would lead to disrespect towards the prohibitions (p. 40). Again both claims seem to me to be a misreading, since (1) the Tur, in one particular context, razing the beard, doesn't accept the Rambam's speculative reason that this was an idolatrous practice, and falls back to saying we don't need to know the reason, and no epistemological or pragmatic claim is being made at all. (2) <em>If</em> any <em>general</em> criticism is intended, then rather than speculatively positing a hitherto-unknown anti-reason community, it would be much more straightforward to identify the Tur's brief rejection with some known criticism of historical reasons, as that of the Ramban (a big influence on the Tur) in <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Vayikra/1/9#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his commentary</a>. (3) The Tur himself, in his (long) <a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Vayikra/19/27#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah commentary</a>, <em>does</em> offer a practical reason. (4) This is also, as Fred notes in the comments to the question, the kind of thing that the Rambam himself says (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%97_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Meila 8:8</a>, <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94_%D7%93_%D7%99%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchot Temura 4:13</a>), and isn't expressing general opposition to finding reasons for commandments. If anything it should be read as an affirmation of the Rambam's approach, which he's only repeating as a commonplace.</p>\n<p>There was very fierce controversy surrounding the Rambam in the generation after his death (even leading up to some of his books being burned). Some of the controversy involved the character of the mitzvot (it's not clear to me whether this was an issue of obligatoriness or merely of classification, i.e. that the mitzvot are in the same category of things as secular laws). However, as far as I know, none of those involved in the controversy took issue with the Rambam's views on the matter (or if they did they didn't leave behind writings). Typically they took the Rambam as being on their own side and took issue with his interpreters (see for instance <a href=\"https://www.google.co.il/books/edition/%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99_%D7%94/fqk8AAAAYAAJ?hl=iw&gbpv=1&dq=%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%AA%20%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%AA&pg=PA50&printsec=frontcover\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">קבוצת מכתבים בעניני המחלוקת... letter 7</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

I am ignorant of how the Israelites would have understood this event, and I want to understand it from the Jewish perspective.</p>\n<p>(I apologize if my wording is offensive; it is not my intention to offend anyone with my question.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It's complicated.  The Mekhilta tells us that Moses promised his father-in-law Jethro that his first son would become an idolater. [Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 18:3]  Why?  The Midrash says that Jethro first worshipped all existing idols and concluded only God was real [Midrash Tanḥuma, Yitro 7] Rabbi Shim'on Schwab concludes that Jethro wanted a grandson to do as he did: Worship all existing idols and conclude only God was real.  This would give him a better appreciation of monotheism. [Mayan Bet Hashoeva on Yitro 18, 4] So Moses at first did not circumcize Gershom, and God threatened to kill him as a result, and his wife Zipporah had to do it in his stead. [Ex. 4:24-26]  Moses intentionally did not want Gershom circumcised because of his promise to Jethro.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Of interest is Rashbam's relevant comments. On the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.24?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashbam_on_Exodus.4.24.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">verse</a> in question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויפגשהו ה' - המלאך - כי היה מתעצל בהליכתו ומוליך אשתו ובניו.</p>\n<p>The LORD encountered him -- [i.e., His] angel -- since Moses was meandered in going, and that he had brought his wife and children along.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The suggestion local to the verse is that Moses' lack of urgency was the cause. However, Rashbam presents a more complex picture elsewhere. Returning to the scene at the bush (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.14?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashbam_on_Exodus.4.14.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ex. 4:14</a>), he comments</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויחר אף ה' במשה - וחרון אף עשה רושם לפי הפשט כאמור לפנינו: ויפגשהו ה' ויבקש המיתו - כדפירשתי אצל יעקב כשנעשה צולע על יריכו.</p>\n<p>The LORD's anger kindled against Moses -- According to the <em>peshat</em>, [God's] anger produces a manifestation as stated later: \"Hashem encountered him and sought his death\" as I have explained regarding Jacob when his thigh was injured.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashbam is implicitly responding to a statement in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.102a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">b. Zevachim 102a</a> (cited by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.4.14.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on our verse</a>) of Rabbi Yehoshua:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן קׇרְחָה אוֹמֵר: כׇּל חֲרוֹן אַף שֶׁבַּתּוֹרָה נֶאֱמַר בּוֹ רוֹשֶׁם, וְזֶה לֹא נֶאֱמַר בּוֹ רוֹשֶׁם</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korcha said: For each instance of [God's] anger in the Torah there is recorded a manifestation, but this instance has no such manifestation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is challenged by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai (in the Bavli, although Rashi quotes Rabbi Yose), who objects:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַף זֶה נֶאֱמַר בּוֹ רוֹשֶׁם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״הֲלֹא אַהֲרֹן אָחִיךָ הַלֵּוִי״ – וַהֲלֹא כֹּהֵן הוּא! הָכִי קָאָמַר: אֲנִי אָמַרְתִּי אַתָּה כֹּהֵן וְהוּא לֵוִי, עַכְשָׁיו הוּא כֹּהֵן וְאַתָּה לֵוִי.</p>\n<p>This, too, has a manifestation, for it says: \"Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite?\" but in fact he is a priest! [the Bavli clarifies:] That is to say: I intended you will be the priest and he will be the Levite, now he will be the priest and you will be the Levite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see that Rashbam rejects the opinion of both the <em>tanna</em> and Rashi and suggests simply that the \"manifestation\" of God's anger is delayed until later, at the inn. This is distinct from, but thematically agrees with, Rashbam's local comment in the original verse. The consistent position is that Moses' reticence to return to Egypt and accept his mission provokes God's anger. This position is clarified and distilled when we refer back to the episode of Jacob's injury. There (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.32.29?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Rashbam_on_Genesis.32.29.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 32:29</a>), we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֗אמֶר לֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ יֵאָמֵ֥ר עוֹד֙ שִׁמְךָ֔ כִּ֖י אִם־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל כִּֽי־שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִ֛ים וְעִם־אֲנָשִׁ֖ים וַתּוּכָֽל׃</p>\n<p>He [the man] said to him: Your name shall no longer be called Jacob but Israel, for you have striven with God and men and have prevailed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashbam's relevant excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שלקה יעקב ונצלע, לפי שהקב\"ה הבטיחו והוא היה בורח. וכן מצינו בכל ההולכים בדרך שלא ברצון הקב\"ה, או ממאנים ללכת שנענשו. במשה כתיב: שלח נא ביד תשלח ויחר אף ה' במשה. ולפי הדרש, אף על פי שאמרו חכמים בכל מקום חרון אף עושה רושם וכאן מה רושם יש? הלא אהרן אחיך הלוי עתיד הוא להיות לוי ואתה כהן ועכשיו הוא יהיה כהן ואתה לוי. אך לפי הפשט: לפי שהיה מתעצל ללכת כתיב: ויהי בדרך במלון ויפגשהו ה' ויבקש המיתו.</p>\n<p>The reason that he injured Jacob is that the Holy One promised him [safety], but he had fled [from confronting Esau]. Similarly we find all who travel against the will of the Holy One, or refuse to travel, are punished. Regarding Moses, it is written: \"[Moses said,] 'Please, send the one You will send,' and the LORD's anger kindled against Moses.\" In <em>derash</em>, the Sages said that every instance of [God's] anger has a manifestation, but what manifestation is here? 'Is there not Aaron your brother, the Levite' who would only be a Levite while you become the priest? Now, he will be priest and you will be but the Levite.\" Nevertheless, in <em>peshat</em>, since Moses was reluctant to go, it is written, \"It was on the way in the inn, the LORD encountered him and sought his death\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I want to note that this investigation is prototypical Rashbam.  He proposes his own principle, \"God punishes those who journey/do not journey against His will\", and demonstrates its consistency with many textual examples. In service of this principle, he resolves to his satisfaction a claim of the Sages (all instances of God's anger entail a physical manifestation) that ostensibly fails in one textual instance. But in doing so, he rejects the midrashic interpretation of his grandfather and <em>tannaim</em> themselves! This is quite radical, especially for a <em>rishon</em>.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, I do find this explanation of the inn episode compelling. It neatly resolves the mystery by connecting it to the broader narrative while exposing an important characterization of Moses (and God) in these scenes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Completely rational question. Moses had two sons Gershom and Eliezer. Circumcision was done on the 8th day and since Gershom was already born in exodus 2 but no mention of Eliezer. This baby must be Eliezer. God commanded Moses to circumcise his son on the 8th day and Tzipporah refused.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Exodus 4.25 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of\nher son, and cast it at his feet; and she said: 'Surely a bridegroom\nof blood art thou to me.'26 So He let him alone. Then she said: 'A\nbridegroom of blood in regard of the circumcision.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here we see clearly she was against it. This is the reason they got divorced. So why did God almost kill Moses? I would argue God almost killed the baby to scare Tzipporah because she was against it, where as Moses was all for it. This explains why they got divorced also. And we know the Midianites believed in other gods according to numbers 25.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Exodus 18.11 Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods; yea,\nfor that they dealt proudly against them.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now i know meaning i didn't know before since he worshiped many gods before. Now tzipporah clearly didn't accept the God of Moses as we can tell by her language \" a bride groom of blood\" .</p>\n<p>There is another secret here reguarding the identity of Eliezer and how he became Joshua son of Nun, Moses being Nun. Lets leave that for another discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yitzḥak of the school of Rabbi Ami says: He desired something unclean, as he was driven by lust to Philistine women. Therefore, the saving of his life was dependent on something unclean, the jawbone of a donkey.</p>\n<p><em>Is the above Talmudic piece suggesting that Samson's women were his metaphorical jawbones? In other words, in the same way that he could have fought the Plishtim bare handed with full trust in God, but, instead, chose to sully himself and rely on a dubious externality (a donkey jawbone), he also could have generally fought the Plishtim in another manner (rather than via connecting with various Plishti women)?</em></p>\n<p>I think the Yerushalmi actually suggests this (Sota First Chapter)</p>\n<p>וְאָבִיו וְאִמּוֹ לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי מֵיי הִיא כִּי תוֹאָנָה הוּא מְבַקֵּשׁ מִפְּלִשְׁתִּים. אָמַר רִבִּי לָעְזָר. בְּשִׁבְעָה מְקוֹמוֹת כְּתִיב לֹא תִּתְחַתֵּן בָּם. אָמַר רִבִּי אָבִין. לֶאֱסוֹר שִׁבְעָה עַמָּמִין. וְהָכָא הוּא אָמַר הָכֵין. אָמַר רִבִּי יִצְחָק אִם לַלֵּצִים הוּא יָלִיץ.\n“And his father and mother did not know that this was from the Eternal, that he was looking for a pretext from the Philistines.” Rebbi Eleazar said, In seven places it is written: “Do not contract marriage with them.” Rebbi Abun said, to prohibit seven peoples. <strong>And here, it says so? Rebbi Isaac said, “if he scoffs about the scoffers.</strong>”</p>\n<p>The Pnei Moshe Explains:</p>\n<p>ואת אמר הכין. כי מה' הוא בתמיה:\nAnd you say such? That (marrying the Plishti woman) it was from God! (read in astonishment).\n(Rather the answer is:)\nאם ללצים הוא יליץ. כתיב דבדרך שאדם רוצה לילך מוליכין אותו: 'With scoffers, He scoffs' it is written. for in the way that a man wants to go, he is led (by God).</p>\n<p><em>Notice it is Rabbi Yitzchak who makes the comment in both Talmuds</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Devarim vs mitzvot\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am a newcomer to Judaism. When I was younger, it was always emphasised to me that I needed to follow the 10 commandments. But, I've learned that \"commandments\" in Deut 4/13 may be too strong of a word and, that it's better rendered as sayings/words.</p>\n<p>For someone coming from Christendom, what is the difference between the devarim and mitzvot? If I observe the 10 (strictly speaking 7) devarim, does that automatically mean I am also observing the 613 mitzvot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Welcome to Judaism! Let's clear this up step by step:</p>\n<h3>Are the 10 <em>Commandments</em> actually the 10 <em>Sayings</em>? What's the difference?</h3>\n<p>Yes, but they are also commandments. In Hebrew, the word for \"commandment\" is <em>Mitzva</em>. The reason you heard that they are actually the 10 Sayings is because the name given to the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2896/jewish/What-Are-the-Ten-Commandments.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">10 <em>Mitzvas</em> given at Mount Sinai</a> are referred to, in Hebrew, as the 10 Devarim (sometimes referred to as Eser HaDiberot). Devarim = \"Sayings/Statements\" (and this is generally because we heard them spoken by Hashem and Moses during the Sinai Event). That does not mean that they are not also commandments - they are. They are 10 out of the full 613.</p>\n<p>That being said there is <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1438516/jewish/Mitzvah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">interesting discussion regarding the word <em>Mitzva</em></a> (and even <em>Devarim</em>) in our sources and whether \"commandment\" is the correct translation. If I were to summarise those discussions in a nutshell, Mitzvas are indeed obligations, but they are also ways of connecting to Hashem (the root of the word <em>Mitzva</em> is both <em>Tzav</em> = command as well as <em>Tzavta</em> = connection). Therefore we should view them as more \"obligations in a relationship\", similar to all relationships. Every relationship carries with it obligations on both sides, but those obligations should be kept lovingly, and with the intention that they are there to bring the participants in the relationship closer.</p>\n<h3>If I observe the 10 (strictly speaking 7) does that automatically mean I am also observing the 613 Mitzvot?</h3>\n<p>I can answer for the 10 but I am not sure about the 7. When it comes to the 10, we say that <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4755814/jewish/Why-Only-Ten-Commandments-at-Sinai.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the 10 Devarim contain all of the other Mitzvot within them</a> (see here: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/83758/613-mitzvos-in-the-aseres-hadibbros\">613 mitzvos in the aseres hadibbros</a>), homiletically. In fact we even say that the 10 Devarim are contained in the first, and in fact, in the first word of the first, and in fact, the first letter of the first. This is, as I said, homiletics. One should not stick to the 10 Devarim and ignore the rest, <em>practically</em>. This homiletical teaching is beautiful and contains many secrets, but practically speaking it just means that if one truly internalises the 10 Devarim, that will <em>lead</em> to them keeping the rest as well, and in some deep way they are all connected to the 10.</p>\n<p>That being said, this applies to a Jew. To a Noahide, I am not sure what there is to be said about keeping the 7. We generally hold that the non-Jew is not obligated to keep the 613 (and actually forbidden from keeping some, such as Shabbat - which is included in the 10), and I am unaware of any homiletical interpretations that keeping the 7 is equivalent to keeping the 613, but could be. The 7 bring the non-Jew closer to God and fulfil his obligations to Him, and they do so on their own.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I have provided quite a few links to a reputable, authentic resource for questions on Judaism, to back up and expand on what I've been saying - Chabad.org, who are on top of their game generally speaking. Here are a few others about the Noahide Laws for you to read up on.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/62221/jewish/The-7-Noahide-Laws.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/62221/jewish/The-7-Noahide-Laws.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5559665/jewish/The-Seven-Laws-of-Noah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5559665/jewish/The-Seven-Laws-of-Noah.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4157474/jewish/Seven-Laws-for-a-Beautiful-Planet.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4157474/jewish/Seven-Laws-for-a-Beautiful-Planet.htm</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380332/jewish/The-Mitzvot-of-Non-Jews.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380332/jewish/The-Mitzvot-of-Non-Jews.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does reading the Judges of Caesarea's formulas as area-based fit the Gemara's flow in Sukkah 8b?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Sukkah 8b, the Gemara cites the “Judges of Caesarea” who said:\nA circle inscribed in a square is one-quarter, a square inscribed in a circle is one-half.</p>\n<p>Typically, this is read as a statement about perimeters, but Tosafot already notes difficulties with this reading. So, I was exploring whether perhaps they meant for us to calculate the areas, not the perimeters:</p>\n<p>The inscribed circle is ~25% smaller in area than its square (actual value ≈ 21.46%). The inscribed square of that circle is exactly 50% smaller in area than its circumscribing square.</p>\n<p><strong>A circle inscribed in a square is</strong> [approximately] <strong>one-quarter</strong> [less than the area of the circumscribing square. While the area of] <strong>a square inscribed in a circle is</strong> [exactly] <strong>one-half</strong> [less than the circumscribing square of the circle].</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6HWCpy5B.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/6HWCpy5B.png\" alt=\"Judge's Area Based Formulas\" /></a></p>\n<p>If so, the Gemara could be read as first offering an approximate formula of the Judges (like Rabbi Yochanan’s method) that is “good enough” when it leads to a stringency, alongside their precise one for calculating the area of the internal square of a round sukkah to complement Rabbi Yochanan's imprecise method that utilizes circumference; or even the Gemara's own use of a circle's diameter to calculate the perimeter of the internal square of a round sukkah, Sukkah 8b.</p>\n<p>It seems the Gemara may have brought the first saying of the Judges of Caesarea in support of Rabbi Yochanan right after the discussion about how his formula was an acceptable method even though it was imprecise, so long as it resulted in a stringency.  It supported him by showing that even the Judges of Caesarea stated that a circle inscribed in a square has an area which is one-quarter less than the area of the external square when it is actually 21.46% less.</p>\n<p>That said, the Gemara ends the discussion with bringing the second part of the sayings of the Judges of Caesarea to teach us how to more simply calculate the area of a square inside a circle (round sukkah) without having to use the formulas for circumference or the diagonal of a square for calculating its perimeter.  And their formula is also exactly precise.</p>\n<p>For example, if you wanted to know if a round sukkah is valid all you need to do is draw a square on the outside of the round sukkah and then measure the length of one side and square it.  Afterwards, you know that the area of the square inside the circle is exactly half the area of the external square of that same circle. So, if one side of the external square is 6 amos then the total area of the external square would be 36 amos and the round sukkah would contain an internal square of 18 amos, exactly 50% the external square.</p>\n<p>I want to read Gemara 8a like this: This is where R Yochanan was imprecise in his measurement, and his imprecision results in a stringency. [The Gemara then notes for the reader how it knows that an imprecision resulting in a stringency is an acceptable practice and that it had indeed arrived at the proper understanding of R Yochanan’s formula by bringing the following proof:] The Rabbis of Caesarea and some say the Judges of Caesarea… A circle inscribed in a square is one-quarter less… But this [formula also] is not so [exact] for we see that it is not that great [resulting in a stringency].</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Judges of Caesarea were correct and the Gemara knew why it was bringing their formulas.</p>\n<p>My question: Does this reinterpretation fit the logical flow of the Gemara — or am I forcing the text?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is a very niche question as one needs to have learned the sugya in depth to understand it. I happen to have just done so - which attracted me to your question. Your suggestion is mathematically correct, but how does this help R Yochanan? R Yochanan is interested in placing people all across the circumference of the circle - or even if you say he is interested in placing them inside the circle, he would want to fill all of the circle.</p>\n<p>In any case, as Tosfot notes, the statement of the Judges of Caesarea don't really help us because they are incorrect, at least as it relates to the circumference of the Sukkah.</p>\n<p>What is interesting to note is that the area of the circle going around a 4x4 sukkah is exactly 24 ! If anything, that might have been what R Yochanan meant (problem is the gemara doesn't seem to think this way, but the fact Rashi and Tosfot both allude to areas - while the gemara only speak of circumference - might mean they also explored this)</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara answers: Since the tanna taught tractate Ketubot, and in that tractate he taught a chapter that begins: One who vows, in which there are several mishnayot concerning vows between husbands and wives, he then taught tractate Nedarim, whose subject is the halakhot of vows. And since he taught tractate Nedarim, he then taught tractate Nazir, which is similar to tractate Nedarim in that one becomes a nazirite by taking a vow.

A few commentators have addressed the issue:</p>\n<p>The commentary by the anonymous Student of Rasag on Chronicles 1:2:15 suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"דויד השביעי – ואעפ\"י שעוד אליהו שמיני כדכתיב בדברי הימים: ליהודה אליהו מאחי דויד (דברי הימים א כ\"ז:י\"ח), ותימה לבני אדם למה אמר דויד השביעי, ואומר ודוד הוא הקטן (שמואל א י\"ז:י\"ד), דע לך כי אליהו היה באותה שעה קטן ומוטל בעריסה בחיק אומנתו ולפיכך לא מנה אותו בחלק הבנים, ומניין אתה יודע שכן הוא הדבר, כי בשעה שברח דוד מפני שאול הנהיג עמו אחיו ובית אביו כדכתיב וינחם את פני מלך מואב (שמואל א כ\"ב:ד') וכשהלך מאתו קם מלך מואב והרגן כולם ולא נשתייר מהם אלא אליהו שהיה קטן ותטמנהו אומנתו, ולפי שקטן היה לא העלהו כאן בחשבון הבנים, וכן דרשו חכמים (ילקוט שמעוני שמואל קמ\"ז). ויהודה בן קורייש פירש כי לאליאב היה בן גדול והעבירו ישי לפני שמואל, ועוד נשאר הקטן הוא דוד, ולכך אומר ויעבר ישי שבעת בניו (שמואל א ט\"ז:י') ודוד הוא שמיני, כי בן אליאב חשוב בבנים...\"</p>\n<p>\"David the seventh - and even though Elihu was the remaining eighth, as it is written in Chronicles: \"Of Judah, Elihu from the brothers of David\" (Chronicles 1:27:18), and it is therefore strange why it is written that David is the seventh (and no more), and it is also stated that \"and David was the youngest\" (Samuel 1:17:14), know that Elihu at the time was young and lay in the crib by his nurse and therefore was not counted among the sons, and how do you know that this was the case? Because when David fled from Shaul he led his brothers and the house of his father, as it is written \"So he led them to the king of Moab\" (Samuel 1:22:4), and when he left, the king of Moab rose and killed all of them, and none remained but Elihu who was small and hidden by his nurse, and since he was small, he was not counted among the sons, and the sages also taught (Yalkut Shimoni Samuel 147). And <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judah_ibn_Kuraish\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehudah Kuraish</a> explained that Eliav had a grownup son who was passed by Yishai before Shmuel, and \"another remains, the youngest, David\", and for this reason it is stated that Yishai passed his seven sons (Samuel 1:16:10), and David was the eigthth, because Eliav's son was counted among the sons...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pseudo-Rashi on the verse in Chronicles 1:2:15 suggested:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"דויד השבעי – מלא יו\"ד מפני כבודו של דוד ועתה מצא המרגלית לפיכך לא מנה השמיני אליהו.\"</p>\n<p>\"David the seventh - written fully with a Yod<sup>1</sup> in honor of David, as he (i.e., the author of the text) now came across the gemstone and therefore did not name the eighth, Elihu.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.15?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim on Chronicles 1:2:15</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"דויד השביעי – וזה סותר למה שבשמואל (א' טז, י; י\"ז:י\"ב) חושב לישי שמונה בנים ודוד הוא הקטן. ודעת חז\"ל במדרש שהשמיני הוא אליהו הנזכר בין הנגידים שהקים דוד על יהודה, אליהו אחי דוד (לקמן כ\"ז:י\"ח), והוא היה קטן מדוד, וקרא לדוד קטן על שהיה מקטין א״ע, וכן פרש\"י. וראב\"ע ורד\"ק פירשו שאליהו היה אח מן האב ולא מן האם, ולכן לא חשבו פה מפני שאומר ואחיותיהם צרויה ואביגיל, והם היו אחיות מן האם ולא מן האב, וא\"כ לא היו אחיות לאליהו לא מן האב ולא מן האם, וכדבריהם נראה ממ״ש (שמואל ב י\"ז:כ\"ה) ועמשא בן איש ושמו יתרא הישראלי אשר בא אל אביגיל בת נחש אחות צרויה אם יואב, מבואר (לפי הפשט, והדרש ידוע) שאביגיל היתה בת נחש לא בת ישי, וא״כ היתה אחותם רק מן האם, לכן אמר אחות צרויה ולא אמר אחות דוד, מפני שאחות צרויה היתה מן האב ומן האם שגם צרויה היתה בת נחש, ואמם נשאת לישי באלמנותה.\"</p>\n<p>\"David the seventh - and this contradicts what is said in Samuel (1:16:10, 17:12) that Yishai was thought to have eight sons and David was the youngest. And our sages' opinion in the midrash is that the eighth was Elihu, mentioned among the princes that David raised \"Of Judah, Elihu from the brothers of David\" (ibid. 27:18), and he was younger than David, but the text called David the youngest because he made himself small (i.e., he was humble), and so explained Rashi. And <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36900&pgnum=107\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.14?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_I_Chronicles.2.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> explained that Elihu was a brother from the paternal side but not from the maternal side, and therefore he was not counted here, as it is said \"and their sisters Tzeruyah and Avigail\", and they were sisters on the maternal side and not the paternal side, and therefore were not sisters of Elihu not from the father and not from the mother, and their arguments appear to be proven from what is written (Samuel 2:17:25), \"And Amassah was the son of a man named Yitra the Israelite who cohabited with Avigail daughter of Nachash\" - not the daughter of Yishai, and therefore was only their sister from the maternal side, and therefore it is written \"sister of Tzruyah\", not \"sister of David\", since she was the sister of Tzruyah from father and mother, since Tzruyah was also the daughter of Nachash, and their mother married Yishai during her widowhood.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Unclear to me whether he meant that David was written with a Yod (דויד) or that he had before him seventh written with two Yods (שביעי) rather than what we have (שבעי).</p>\n\n\n",

There is no lack or weakening of authority at all.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The \"wayward son\", way before he faces a question of execution, is given 39 lashes with a fierce whip by the Court, for his \"first offense\" of stealing his father's funds and eating and drinking with the stolen funds.

It obviously is not the case.</p>\n<p>Saying that the Torah's authority is \"weakening\" because of technicalities in extreme cases, would be like claiming that murderers are flocking from Florida to Texas because they realized they could merely receive lethal injection if caught in Texas, vs. the electric chair back in Florida.</p>\n<p>Maybe the OP should restart and ask why these extreme cases are taught when we already have a Torah framework for their sins, and what lessons they teach if they will never come to pass?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The answer to your question is simply \"Yes\".

Masterfully transliterated, it provides an inclusive experience for individuals from all backgrounds, empowering them to join in with other communities and strengthen the bonds of faith. This remarkable Siddur has garnered international acclaim, with copies cherished by devotees in the U.S., Israel, Spain, the U.K., Germany, France, Poland, and India.

You are not to say: \"How can I [permit myself to] eat this real forbidden fat, or execute this innocent man;\" instead you are to say, \"The Lord Who enjoined the commandments commanded that I perform all His commandments in accordance with all that they, who stand before Him in the place that He shall choose, teach me to do. <strong>He gave me the Torah as taught by them, even if they were to err.</strong>\" Such was the case of Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabban Gamaliel [Rabbi Yehoshua being instructed by Rabban Gamaliel to come before him with his walking stick] on the Day of Atonement that occurred according to his reckoning.\nNow the need for this commandment is very great, for the Torah was given to us in written form and it is known that not all opinions concur on newly arising matters. Disagreements would thus increase and the one Torah would become many Torahs. Scripture, therefore, defined the law that we are to obey the Great Court that stands before G-d in the place that He chose in whatever they tell us with respect to the interpretation of the Torah, whether they received its interpretation by means of witness from witness until Moses [who heard it] from the mouth of the Almighty, or whether they said so based on the implication [of the written words] of the Torah or its intent. For it was subject to their judgment that He gave them the Torah even if it [the judgment] appears to you to exchange right for left. And surely you are obligated to think that they say \"right\" what is truly right, because G-d's spirit is upon the ministers of His Sanctuary, and He forsaketh not His saints; <strong>they are preserved forever from error and stumbling.</strong> In the language of the Sifre: \"Even if they show you before your own eyes that right is left and that left is right — obey them!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the halachic basis for Machon Shilo?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In many places but labeled as such <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8ZDS6nGu5aM\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, Rabbi David Bar-Hayyim of Machon Shilo declares that the organization's mission is to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>be in touch with the true, authentic Torah of Eretz Yisrael, without any deviation and without all manner of foreign ideas and accretions. The Torah, as it is, does not require any embellishment - תורת ה' תמימה משיבת נפש as it is. All you have to do is to live according to the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://machonshilo.org/en/blog/nusah-erets-yisrael/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Elsewhere on their website</a>, they state that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Until the time of the First Crusade, the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel maintained the ancient traditions: they followed the Halakhic rulings of the Jerusalem Talmud (as opposed to its Babylonian counterpart) and prayed according to the liturgy used in Erets Yisrael from time immemorial. Even outside the Land, certain communities, notably in Egypt, used the Land of Israel liturgy and followed the ancient customs of Erets Yisrael as recently as two generations ago. In general, the nusah of Erets Yisrael had receded into the mist of history ... Machon Shilo - and its rabbinical court Beth haWa’adh, led by HaRav David Bar-Hayim-believe that the Return of Jews to Erets Yisrael must be complemented by a return to the authentic teachings and religious practices of Erets Yisrael in order to “renew our days as of old”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Rambam in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.34?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction to the Mishnah Torah</a>, places authority with the Talmud Bavli:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַדְּבָרִים שֶׁבַּתַּלְמוּד הַבַּבְלִי, חַיָּבִין כָּל בֵּית יִשְׂרָאֵל לָלֶכֶת בָּהֶם; וְכוֹפִין כָּל עִיר וְעִיר וְכָל מְדִינָה וּמְדִינָה לִנְהֹג בְּכָל הַמִּנְהָגוֹת שֶׁנָּהֲגוּ חֲכָמִים שֶׁבַּתַּלְמוּד, וְלִגְזֹר גְּזֵרוֹתָם וְלָלֶכֶת בְּתַקָּנוֹתָם.</p>\n<p>all the matters mentioned by the Babylonian Talmud are incumbent on the entire Jewish people to follow. We must compel each and every city and each country to accept all the customs that were put into practice by the Sages of the Talmud, to pass decrees parallelling their decrees, and to observe their ordinances, since all the matters in the Babylonian Talmud were accepted by the entire Jewish people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is there a halachic basis for establishing a halachic framework around Toras Eretz Yisrael - one that requires us to abandon various community mesoros - rooted in Chazal/rishonim/acharonim, or is it more just an attitude of \"we're here now so we gotta do things different\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I don't totally agree with Harel. Machon Shiloh as much as it talks about Torath Eres Yriroel, it still abides for the most part on rulings of Bavli, Rambam and Gra. It definitely takes a position aligned with Yerushalmi, but as we know there's no Yerushalmi in everything. Yes, they do put Tefilin during cholo shel moed as one would take Vadii Yerushalmi over. Safek Bavli. They make a beracha when taking off Tefilin, but it is not like it was not mentioned in the Bavli. They do pray in-line with Nusach Eres Yiaroel, so that is maybe the most Minhag Eres Yriroel Machon Shiloh is. However, the concept of Machon Shiloh is to approach Torah with rationale, unlike the rote minhagim that the masses follow blindly without understanding what they are or not doing. Everyone is supposed to be learned and be able to carry a conversation and debate with our community leaders. It does a disservice when there is no discussion and you are told this is how we always did things, thereby shutting down dialogue. This creates a lack of learning. Regardless, you can do you, I can do me as long as we are all in the boundaries of Torah.\nI strongly disagree with the person mentioning something along the lines that Machon Shiloh is proposing new minhagim. It is quite the opposite, the Sepharadim and Ashkenazim of today that have been so kabbalistically infused that one would argue these groups have been introducing Chadash into their respective communities.</p>\n\n\n",

He decreed the blessing on them and said of them that they should be fruitful and multiply, meaning that they should bring forth abundantly, that one creature should bring forth many like itself. The purport of the blessing is procreation, even as it says, And I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations. In connection with plants also, the term “blessing” applies: Then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year. However, it does not say so on the third day [when the plants and trees were created] because all created living beings were only a single pair, male and female, according to their kind, and therefore they were in need of a blessing to bring forth abundantly; but in the case of plants, they sprang up over the face of the entire earth in great abundance, just as they exist today. Nor did He mention a blessing on the sixth day for cattle and beasts because in the decree of abundancy which He decreed for the moving souls in the waters there were included the moving souls on the earth, as all living souls that do not speak are in the same class of creation. And our Rabbis have said that they [the fish and fowl] were in need of a blessing because people hunt them and eat them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND HE BLESSED THEM — Because people decreased their number, hunting them and eating them, they needed a blessing (Genesis Rabbah 11:2); it is true that beasts also were in need of a blessing, but on account of the serpent that was to be cursed in the future, He did not bless them, in order that it might not be included in the blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These commentaries note that there was a blessing on the fish and fowl because they were hunted as food, but there was no blessing on the land animals. Fish and fowl that are hunted for food commonly have short lifespans. This may be a hint that longer lifespans for animals are not indications of blessing, because the fish and fowl were blessed because we eat them, and the fish and fowl we eat are typically young.

The relevant point there reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וגם כל בעל תאוה עושה מעשה שטות ואיתא (מ\"ר בלק) על אתונו של בלעם שזו הטפשות שבבהמה וכו' ע\"ש וכן הלשון בגמרא (ב\"ב עד.) כל אבא חמרא ופירשב\"ם שוטה כחמור. וכן איתא (נדרים פא.) שאין מצויין לצאת ת\"ח מבניהן משום דקרו לאינשי חמרי היינו שמתגאים על הציבור בחכמתם להחשיב הכל כטפשים. וחמור הטיפש שבבהמה כנ\"ל. ותאוה מעשה שטות כמ\"ש (סנהדרין קו.) שטים שנתעסקו בדברי שטות וכן איתא (סוטה ג.) אין אדם עובר עבירה אלא אם כן נכנס בו רוח שטות שנ' כי תשטה אשתו. כי אין שטות גדול מזה כי הוא דבר מאוס כמ\"ש (שבת קנב.) אשה חמת מלא צואה וכו' ושוטה זה מאבד עולמו בשביל רגע א' דתאוה מנוולת ועל כן נקרא קליפת ישמעאל דתאוה חמור.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, anyone driven by lust performs acts of foolishness. As it is written in Midrash Rabbah on Parshas Balak, regarding Bilam’s donkey, it is said: “This is the foolishness of the animal”. Similarly, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.74a.2?lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra (74a)</a>, it says: “Until all the fathers became donkeys,” and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.74a.2?lang=bi&p2=Rashbam_on_Bava_Batra.74a.2.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> explains that a fool is like a donkey.

Yechiel Michel Stern</a> in Sefer \"Leshon Limudim\", p. 187-8 notes based on Rabbeinu Bachya that this is play on the animal name חמור (donkey) - חומר (chomer measure [of barley], also raw matter). Here's the full translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The donkey carries his load longer than any other animal, that's why people use it to transport heavy cargo of wheat. Explained <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.2.19.2?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_%5Bben_Asher%5D._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya on Bereshis 2:19</a>, reason (2), that's why the donkey's name in Hebrew is חמור (chamOr), which is derived from the meaning חומר שעורים (<em>chomer</em> measure of barley):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When it came to naming the donkey, Adam called it חמור. Adam had recognised that that (1) animal was extremely dull-witted, more foolish than all the other animals. This is why he chose a name which is closely related to the word חומר, i.e. “matter, material.” (2) An additional reason for that name is the fact that the donkey is a beast of burden employed to carry sacks of grain. Grain is measured in terms of a weight called חומר, as we find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.3.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hoseah 3:2</a> חֹ֥מֶר שְׂעֹרִ֖ים “a <em>chomer</em> of barley.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the donkey appears to be more absorbed in physicality compared to any other animal as it is even capable to rest with the load on his back. (Btw. that's why the symbol of Yissachar is donkey, for just like a donkey can rest with a load on its back so does <em>ben Yissachar</em> with the Torah scroll).</p>\n<p>As noted by @Dov with other sources, R. Stern continues explaining reason (1) in Rabbeinu Bachya:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The nature of donkey is gullible, foolish, and more burdensome from other animals, as they say in midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Balak.9.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Balak 9</a> (at the end of the paragraph): שֶׁזֹּה הַטִּפְּשִׁית שֶׁבַּבְּהֵמוֹת - the donkey is the silliest of animals. Also Rabbeinu Bachya in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.2.19.2?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_%5Bben_Asher%5D._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quote above</a>. The donkey's Hebrew name is חמור (chamor), since it is driven after its physical desires (התאוות) which is derived from חומר - physicality, as pulled towards materiality (חומריות). That is why the nations with culture driven by physicality are called <em>a nation like a donkey</em>. Also a human being at the time of one's youth who pursues physical pleasures is compared to a donkey that brays (חמור נוער, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.3a.7?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'rachos 3a</a> for usage of the phrase, also a play on the word נער - youth).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Based on these sources, one could interpret the gemara as follows. The children of rabbis that do not grow to be Torah scholars is a punishment of the rabbis themselves, who, in moments of frustration, may call ordinary people <em>donkeys</em>. Why donkeys? Either because the ordinary people did not develop intellect, or because they are fully engrossed in materiality, or in pursuit of physical desires.</p>\n<p>The punishment is spelled in the gemara, since naturally children seek to test the boundaries of the permitted set by their parents. It is especially true after age 7 and in their teen years as they develop independence, as the source above compares them to a <em>donkey that brays</em>, when they get more adversarial. Such a youth, when seeing the parent-rabbi frustration with ordinary people, may not appreciate reasons for frustration, but rather use it as a weapon to continue frustrating the parent. At the end he, חו\"ש, develop dislike for the profession of the parent.</p>\n\n\n",

Besides the examples given in the comment by <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/759/double-aa\">DoubleAA</a> (Numbers 21:6 or Kohelet 10:8), the root נשך can be seen in\nDeuteronomy 23:20-21 (with and without the נ), where it means to charge interest.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>Can mean to settle or live.

He proceeds to quote verses to support each part of his statement. He is without joy, as it is written: “And you shall rejoice, you and your household” (Deuteronomy 14:26), which indicates that a man is in a joyful state only when he is with his household, i.e., his wife. He is without blessing, as it is written: “To cause a blessing to rest in your house” (Ezekiel 44:30), which indicates that blessing comes through one’s house, i.e., one’s wife.

The context there seems to be that giving terumah and various gifts to the kohen will result in a blessing on the giver's home. I do not see any indication of a connection to marriage or having a wife.

Given that they were Kehatites living in Ramah/Ramatayim Tzofim, in a territory called \"Eretz Tzuf\" (both eponymously named for their ancestor Tzuf), it seems that Tzuf was a Levite who had to leave his original territory, likely due to monetary issues.

    "content": "# What is the nature of the Oath we made before coming into the world vs The one we made on mount Sinai\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>BH</p>\n<p>The start of the Tanya Likutei Amarim/Sefer Shel Beinonim says in the beginning, quoting from Massekhet Nidah, that a Malach made us swear that we will be a tzaddik and not a rasha; however, I heard from other people that we also made an oath on Mount Sinai for keeping the mitzvot.</p>\n<p>Is this true?  If yes, what is the nature of this oath to keep the mitzvot? Is it different from the one we made before we came to the world? Also was this oath always made before, even before Mount Sinai? Or only after Sinai did this oath come into the world and stay happening until now, and, if yes, also what was the point of having the oath done at Mount Sinai or we had to make this oath only after the oath at Mount Sinai?</p>\n<p>In short, is it the same two oaths or different?  If not different, what is the purpose of the two oaths?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Chida offers one difference. He brings a Gemara in Niddah 30b that says that we all make a shevua in the womb to be a Tzadik and not a Rosha. Rashi explains that this is a Shevua to keep the whole Torah. The Shevua at Har Sinai was on all Nefashos present and future, in the womb however, we make a 2nd Shevua with Guf and Nefesh together. See sources below.</p>\n<p>Another potential difference is that the Shevua at Har Sinai was made under duress, as Hashem held a mountain over our heads like a barrel. The Shevua made in the womb is seemingly made willingly.</p>\n<p>Another potential difference based on the Maharsha on Shavuos 29a is that the Shevua at Har Sinai was the communal acceptance of the Torah onto the Jewish people, effectively making its laws binding. The Shevua in the womb on the other hand, would just be an oath to actually do that which we are bound to do by that original oath.</p>\n<p>In a similar vein, the Chazon Ish on Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 119:8 explains that the Shevua at Har Sinai was actually a Bris - covenant - unlike the Shevua in the womb.</p>\n<p>Edit: Adding more sources about the Shevua made at Har Sinai</p>\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<p>Chidah – In his sefer Maharis Ayin on Nedarim</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והלא מושבע ועומד מהר סיני וכו'</strong>. בפ\"ג דנדה אמרו דמשביעין לילד בבטן אמו.\nונראה דשבועת הר סיני היתה לנפשות העתידות שהיו הכל בהר סיני כדכתיב את\nאשר ישנו פה ואשר איננו. וזו השבועה היתה לנפשות לבד. ואח\"כ בבטן היא\nשבועה לגוף ונפש כאחד. ומ\"מ רגיל הש\"ס לומר מושבע ועומד מהר סיני כי היתה\nהשבועה הראשונה וגם היתה לכוללות ישראל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Niddah 30b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואינו יוצא משם עד שמשביעין אותו שנאמר (ישעיהו מה, כג) כי לי תכרע כל ברך\nתשבע כל לשון כי לי תכרע כל ברך זה יום המיתה שנאמר (תהלים כב, ל) לפניו\nיכרעו כל יורדי עפר תשבע כל לשון זה יום הלידה שנאמר (תהלים כד, ד) נקי\nכפים ובר לבב אשר לא נשא לשוא נפשו ולא נשבע למרמה ומה היא השבועה\nשמשביעין אותו תהי צדיק ואל תהי רשע ואפילו כל העולם כולו אומרים לך צדיק\nאתה היה בעיניך כרשע והוי יודע שהקב\"ה טהור ומשרתיו טהורים ונשמה שנתן בך\nטהורה היא אם אתה משמרה בטהרה מוטב ואם לאו הריני נוטלה ממך</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi (ibid.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ולא נשבע למרמה</strong> - שקיים שבועתו לשמור את התורה דאי בשבועה בעלמא אטו משום\nדלא נשבע למרמה חשיב להו בעולין בהר ה':</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfos Shavuos 29a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כשהשביע משה את ישראל.</strong> קצת קשה מה היתה מועלת השבועה כמו שהיה ירא שיעבדו\nעבודת כוכבים כמו כן היה לירא פן יעברו השבועה:?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Maharsha (ibid.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>כשהשביע משה את ישראל.</strong> כתבו התוס' ק\"ק מה היתה מועלת השבועה כמו שהיה ירא\nשיעבדו את ע\"ז כו' עכ\"ל ונראה דלק\"מ דהשבועה עצמה היא קבלת התורה ואי לאו\nהשבועה בדיבורא בעלמא ליכא קיבול ולא היו נענשים אם יעברו עליה וכן מוכיח\nהמקרא דכתיב לעברך בברית ה' אלהיך ובאלתו וגו' והרבה כמוהו וק\"ל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Chazon Ish - SA YD 119:8\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AJr4bNm8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/AJr4bNm8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Additional Sources about the Shevua made at Har Sinai:</strong></p>\n<p>Gemara Nedarim 8a - Source for Shevua made at Har Sinai</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַב גִּידֵּל אָמַר רַב: מִנַּיִן שֶׁנִּשְׁבָּעִין לְקַיֵּים\nאֶת הַמִּצְוָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״נִשְׁבַּעְתִּי וָאֲקַיֵּמָה לִשְׁמֹר\nמִשְׁפְּטֵי צִדְקֶךָ״. וַהֲלֹא מוּשְׁבָּע וְעוֹמֵד מֵהַר סִינַי הוּא.\nאֶלָּא הָא קָא מַשְׁמַע לַן דְּשָׁרֵי לֵיהּ לְאִינִישׁ לְזָרוֹזֵי\nנַפְשֵׁיהּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Devarim 28:69 – Bris at Har Grizim and Har Eival</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֵלֶּה דִבְרֵי הַבְּרִית אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּה יְהֹוָה אֶת־מֹשֶׁה לִכְרֹת\nאֶת־בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּאֶרֶץ מוֹאָב מִלְּבַד הַבְּרִית אֲשֶׁר־כָּרַת\nאִתָּם בְּחֹרֵב׃</p>\n<p>These are the statements of the covenant that Hashem commanded Moshe\nto ratify with Bnei Yisroel in the land of Moav, beside the covenant\nthat he had made with them at Choreiv.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi (ibid.) - This Bris at Choreiv/Har Sinai was a Shevua</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>לכרת את בני ישראל.</strong> שֶׁיְּקַבְּלוּ עֲלֵיהֶם אֶת הַתּוֹרָה בְּאָלָה\nוּבִשְׁבוּעָה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Medrash Rabbah  Parshas Naso - The Source for Rashi</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמִנַּיִן שֶׁבְּסִינַי לָקְחוּ שְׁבוּעַת הָאָלָה, שֶׁכֵּן כְּתִיב\n(דברים כח, סט): אֵלֶּה דִבְרֵי הַבְּרִית וגו' מִלְּבַד הַבְּרִית\nאֲשֶׁר כָּרַת אִתָּם בְּחֹרֵב, הִקִּישׁ בְּרִית חוֹרֵב לִבְרִית אֶרֶץ\nמוֹאָב, מַה לְּהַלָּן בְּאָלָה אַף כָּאן בְּאָלָה. אֵי זֶהוּ בְּרִית\nשֶׁל חוֹרֵב, (ויקרא כו, יד): וְאִם־לֹא תִשְׁמְעוּ לִי וְלֹא תַעֲשׂוּ\nאֵת כׇּל־הַמִּצְוֺת הָאֵלֶּה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.60a.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 60a</a> mentions that the matriarch Leah did indeed pray thus, and she was answered. The Gemara responds to this that you can't bring up miracles. And so, we see from that Mishna that you should not indeed pray for a miracle. It is considered silly.</p>\n<p>Similarly, we find the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.24b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara in Taanis 24b</a> saying that one should not take from the product of miracles. (Rashi implies that it uses up your merits.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we find instances of miracles such as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.25a.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanis 25a</a> where Rebbi Chanina ben Dosa caused vinegar to burn like oil. The Gemara (in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Meilah.17b.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Me'ila 17b</a>) also describes Rebbi Shimon bar Yochai as a miracle worker. And obviously, we have all the instances of the prophets performing miracles.</p>\n<p>Therefore, a distinction must be drawn, where you'd say that it depends on whether you are a \"miracle person\" who lives a life above his nature or a regular person or is steeped in the physical world.</p>\n<p>With that in the background, we find that the Rema wrote in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.682.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 682</a> that if one forgot to say AL Hanissim then he should say, at the end of Birchas Hamazon, הרחמן הוא יעשה עמנו נסים כמו שעשית לאבותינו בימים ההם בזמן הזה: The Merciful one, He should bring upon us miracles, as He did for our fathers in those days in this time.</p>\n<p>The same question applies here: how can you pray for a miracle? One answer is that you may pray for everyone but just not for yourself alone. This align well with the answer differentiating prophets and holy people from the rest.</p>\n<p>But also, in essence, you aren't actually asking 'for a miracle'. You are asking to merit a relationship with G-d in which He will show His closeness by doing miracles. This is something that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.33.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshe prayed for</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Permissible and even desired, however, is to ask for divine help and miracles within the natural order; this is what we constantly do in the Amidah: for example, \"רפאנו\" (Heal us) – even if medicine has given up on us, we may hope for HaSchem's hidden miracles; such prayers are not a \"test\" of HaSchem, but an expression of our faith in His omnipotence within His creation; even when the situation seems hopeless – \"אפילו חרב חדה מונחת על צווארו של אדם אל ימנע עצמו מן הרחמים\" – \"even if the sword is already on a person's neck, he should not withhold himself from mercy (prayer)\" (Talmud, Berachot 10a); for HaShem can still save in natural ways, such as through circumstances we do not foresee; hoping for such miracles is part of our Bitachon (trust); the Chazon Ish teaches in Emunah u’Bitachon that true trust in HaSchem does not mean being certain that a miracle will happen, but knowing that nothing is beyond HaSchem's power and He does what is best – sometimes through wondrous providence.</p>\n<p>Communal prayers for miracles for the entire people (or for the public sanctification of HaSchem's name) are permitted; thus, we may ask for the final redemption with great miracles, as in the Amidah: \"May the offspring of David... quickly flourish,\" which according to the prophets will only happen with great miracles (<a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/sites/default/files/2021-12/%D7%93%D7%A3%20%D7%9B%27%27%D7%92%2C%20%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D%20-%20%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%94.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">etzion.org.il</a>). Our prayers on Chanukah or Purim (\"In the days of Mordechai and Esther\") or Passover (\"Who performed miracles for our ancestors\" in Al HaNissim) remind HaSchem of past miracles and plead for similar acts of His grace. This is permissible according to the Poskim because it either (a) comes in the form of thanks/remembrance and not as a demanding new request, and (b) concerns the welfare of all Israel and the honor of HaSchem (<a href=\"https://halachayomit.co.il/he/default.aspx?HalachaID=390#:%7E:text=%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90%20%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%99%2C%20%D7%9E%D7%9B%D7%9C%20%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%9D%20%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%97%D7%A8%20%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%9F%20%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%94%20%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%20%D7%9B%D7%96%D7%94%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%A4%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%98%D7%91%D7%A2%2C%20%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%9C%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%9B%D7%9A.%20%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%20%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A8%20%D7%91%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%99%20%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A7%20%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">halachayomit.co.il</a>).

Nevertheless, even here, the Rema cautiously uses \"perform miracles for us\" (<a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/sites/default/files/2021-12/%D7%93%D7%A3%20%D7%9B%27%27%D7%92%2C%20%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%9D%20-%20%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%94.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">etzion.org.il</a>), in the plural, to make it clear: We ask for miracles as once, for all of us.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For the Yehi Ratzon after Birkat Kohanim, it follows: One should preferably say (or think) \"ועשה עמנו נפלאות וניסים\" instead of \"עמי\", thereby transforming the request into a collective one. As shown above, this change is well supported by (<a href=\"https://beinenu.com/system/files/alonim/814_67_82.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Summary of the laws of deriving benefit from a miracle</a> page 3 at bottom). However, if someone reads \"עמי\" from their Siddur, they need not be alarmed – they have not committed a sin. For in context, \"with me\" also refers to the supplicant as part of the community of Israel, not as an isolated individual. Additionally, one can interpret \"perform wonders for me\" as \"work wonders upon me so that others may see and be inspired by You, HaShem\" – analogous to David's \"עשה עמי אות לטובה ויראו שונאי ויבושו\" (Ps. 86:17) <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4364/when-can-we-daven-for-a-neis\">judaism.stackexchange.com</a>. Either way, there is no real Tefilat Shav, as we do not dictate to HaSchem how He should help. We ask for His kindness; whether through ordinary means or astonishing miracles, we leave to Him.</p>\n<p>Practical recommendation: In printed siddurim for communal use, it would be desirable to print the plural version to avoid misunderstandings—just as is customary in the table prayer on Chanukah. Anyone who wants to be personally devout (ba’al nefesh) can already adjust the wording for themselves. The main thing, however, is the inner attitude: earnestly ask HaShem for blessing, for help \"from the heavens,\" and trust in Him—but do not expect \"miracles on demand.\" Halacha and Aggadah teach us humility: \"The one to whom a miracle happens often does not recognize it (as such)\" (Ein ba'al ha-nes makir b'niso). Often, miracles work in secret. Therefore, most communities conclude with Birkat Kohanim with the threefold assurance of peace and blessing (Sim Shalom), nothing more is needed. If it is HaSchem's will to show us open miracles, we will thank Him for it—but until then, we walk in grateful humility and ask for \"wonders and consolations\" (niflaot v'nechamot) for the entire people.</p>\n\n\n",

As to the Greeks, there's plenty of problems relying on Greek philosophers including the fact that the Alexandria library burned up circa 48 bc.  Plus there are documents of numerous Greek philosophers (who argued for flat planets such as Anaximander, Anaximenes, Xenophanes, etc.  A number of ancient Chinese philosophers also argued for flat earth.  Isaiah 11:12 appears to corroborate \"the four corners of the earth\" and that's not really a round earth. 1Chronicles 16:30 implies a stationary planet: \"The world stands firm; it cannot be shaken.\" Standing firm is a Flat Earth premise and antithetical to a twirling Globe.  Psalms 104:5 does not support a twirling globe either: \"He established the earth on its foundations\".   What did Hashem say through prophet Isaiah in 45:12? \"My own hands stretched out the heavens...\"   If you've ever pitched a tent you may recall that the ground cloth fabric is laid first and on flat ground not a curve.  What did Hashem tell Isaiah in 40:22?  He seems to have \"spread out\" the planet \"like a tent\".   Point is - Judaic scripture seems to support the Flat Earth Theory and may falsify the Globe Theory.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>An explicit testimony of the Flat Earth approach is demonstrated in the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pesachim.94b?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psachim 94a</a>), between the 3rd and the 5th centuries CE:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>The Jewish Sages say that during the day the sun travels beneath the firmament and is therefore visible, and at night it travels above the firmament</strong>.<br />\nAnd the sages of the nations of the world (the Roman philosophers) say that during the day the sun travels beneath the firmament, and at night it travels beneath the earth and around to the other side of the world.<br />\nRabbi Yehuda HaNasi said: <strong>And the statement of the sages of the nations of the world appears to be more accurate than our statement</strong>.

This is because the name Ehyeh is the mystery of understanding from which the external forces flee. Therefore, as long as there is a hold for uncircumcision and impurity in a person, it is impossible for the soul to rest upon him, and thus, he cannot be called by the name Israel. Therefore, it is customary not to call him by that name until after the circumcision, for once the uncircumcision and impurity have been removed, the mystery of the soul will certainly take effect upon him—meaning, the soul of the lower aspect. In this case, he will be called by the name of an Israelite, like Shimon, Reuben, and the like. Thus, it becomes clear that the reason he is called 'Adam' is through the commandment of circumcision.

I have done my best to not condense it too much, and I welcome questions, and suggest reading up the citations for further study.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Name of Adnut, Lordship, should be taken to mean that Hashem is the absolute Master of nature. He created it and is creating it every moment, from absolute and utter nothingness, and is therefore in complete control. This is true Lordship (see many places, e.g. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58846&st=&pgnum=56\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sefer Maamarim 5659</em> Sukkot Night 2</a>).</p>\n<p>This is why it is sometimes also associated with the aspect of \"<em>din</em>\" (it contains those letters in it - see R' Yosef Chayyim's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aderet_Eliyahu_(Rabbi_Yosef_Chaim)%2C_Shoftim?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Aderet Eliyahu</em> on Parashat Shoftim</a>; See also the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ba%27alei_Brit_Avram%2C_Shoftim?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Baalei Berit Avram</em> on Parashat Shoftim</a>), because \"natural law\" appears to be \"logical\". \"Survival of the fittest\", \"one must earn one's bread with the sweat of one's brow\" etc. Justice is cold, harsh, but fair - but certainly not \"compassionate\". If you combine the Name with \"E-l\", you get the same gematria as \"tzav\", which the Arizal associates with idolatry. In this world, we can look around, and say \"where's the compassion?\" and make a mistake and think that there's no Hashem, and this is the essence of idolatry (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Mitzvotekha%2C_The_commandment_to_slaughter_the_Pesach_sacrifice?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Derech Mitzvotecha</em> Mitzvat Korban Pesach</a>).</p>\n<p>However, there is a famous combination of the Names Adnut and Havaya, which is taken to mean that we restore this seeming schism when we look closely and see that everything actually is Hashem's compassion - Havaya is all there is. Shem Adnut also has the same gematria as \"Heichal\", i.e. the Beit Hamikdash, the seat of Hashem's righteous judges, who issue righteous judgements, and this creates this very combination of the Names, in a \"higher unification\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.2.18?ven=hebrew%7CChomat_Anakh,_Jerusalem_1965&lang=he&with=Chomat%20Anakh&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Chomat Anach</em> on Shoftim 2:18</a> - see what I wrote <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/147792/chomas-anoch-on-shoftim-218\">here</a> for more). Interestingly, the Beit Hamikdash is the one place where we pronounce Hashem's Name, instead of pronouncing it b'Shem Adnut!</p>\n<p>By studying Hashem's Laws (i.e. His righteousness and justice), we see the compassion. It's only right that if I have more money than I need, and someone else has less than they need, that I should give him some of my money. It's fair (tzeddaka = tzedek), but it's also a clear demonstration of how when we follow Hashem's laws, we are producing compassion*. Another example are the laws of slavery, i.e. treat your slave like a mentsch. It's only fair, but it shows the deep compassion we should have for every human being.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58811&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Hemshech Samech Vav</em></a>, especially the later ma'amarim for extensive coverage on this concept of how <em>halacha</em> reveals Hashem. See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likkutei_Torah%2C_Bechukotai.1?lang=he&with=Navigation&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Likkutei Torah</em> of the Alter Rebbe on Parashat Bechukotai</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you want to get specific, and go deeper (as your question and comments indicate), this Name is the name of Malchut of Atzilut. Much of what we said above is very similar to other <em>vertlach</em> about Elokim. I.e. when we see through the \"mask\" of the world, that all is Him, we are \"shown to know, that Hashem is Elokim... Ein Old Milvado\" (Devarim 4:39). So what's the similarity with Elokim and Adnut?</p>\n<p>Well, they both pertain to the obscuring, the \"tzimtzum\" Hashem creates in order for there to be this world. Elokim is His Name of Gevura, which represents His power of restriction and limitation. He uses it in order to restrict His Light so that the world, paradoxically, can be <em>revealed</em>. A nice mashal used is that of the sun. If the earth were inside the sun, we would not be able to see it, as it would be totally outshined by the sun's light. Therefore, the earth is at a distance from the sun, and only lit up by \"rays\" that have left the sun and travelled a long way, and now we can see the earth (see Derech Mitzvotecha Haamanut Elokut 6). This is another way of saying that if we saw just how good and compassionate Hashem is, we would lose our free will in that we would choose Him without a second thought, but because He \"hides behind cold, harsh nature\", we have an opportunity to choose Him from our own free will.</p>\n<p>So, Elokim is like a \"shield\" to Havaya (see <em>Tanya Shaar Hayichud VehaEmuna</em>), restricting our perception so we are not blinded and nullified by Hashem. This is where Shem Adnut comes in.</p>\n<p>Hashem's Malchut is His power of Speech - He speaks the world into creation. In order for there to be a world that is, so to speak, \"separate\" from Him, He needs to use His power of Gevura - as above - and condense His Light and Being into letters, speaking words, as it is written in Sefer Maamarim 5659 Sukkot Night 2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וז״ש כבוד מלכותך כו׳ וגבורתך ידברו, דבכדי שיהיו האותיות דמלכות בבחי׳\nיש, שיוכל להיות מקור להוות עולמות בי״ע, זהו ע״י וגבורתך דוקא, בחי׳\nגבורה דז״א, לצמצם את האור, ועי״ז דוקא נעשו האותיות בבחי׳ יש כו׳</p>\n<p>And this is the meaning of what is written: \"The glory of Your\nkingship... and Your might they will speak.\" For in order that the\nletters of Malchut should be in the category of \"somethingness\", such\nthat they can be the source for the coming into being of the worlds of\nCreation (BiYA), this is specifically through \"Your Might,\" the aspect\nof Gevura of Ze'ir Anpin, to contract the light. And specifically\nthrough this the letters become in the category of \"somethingness\",\netc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why? Well, words are very superficial and external in comparison to the concepts they are representing - like a mashal. They are \"just\" words, and therefore this is a great contraction and restriction of Hashem's Light. It is through these words that He creates the world we live in, i.e. the world of nature that I spoke about above.</p>\n<p>The fact that He is speaking the world into creation is indeed why He is the absolute and utter Master and Lord of the world (it's His story!), hence the Name Adnut.</p>\n<p>For a bit more detail - the power of Malchut is the most external power of Hashem's Being. The world of Atzilut is not a \"mashal\", it is genuinely His very Being, although it has being somewhat restricted and limited by Gevura. What this means is that He identifies with Atzilut, He speaks in the first person. \"My Chochma\", \"My Gevura\", \"My Malchut\". Still, the worlds created by His Malchut are from Him, but He considers them \"external\" to Him - we are separate from Him. Therefore there is a transition point and this happens in Malchut of Atzilut, part of which actually becomes the highest point of the created worlds.</p>\n<p>This is Shem Adnut, and is also referred to as the Shechina, the Kise HaKavod, Mimaaleh Kol Almin, and the <em>parsa</em>/<em>parochet</em>. It is where Hashem \"puts on His mask\" as it were (<em>hester panim</em>; see <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Worldmask.html?id=IrP6oBLjhOgC&redir_esc=y\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Worldmask</em> by R' Tatz</a>), and hides behind nature. We must know though that nature is a perfect mashal of Him (i.e. the words He speaks to create the mashal are all about Him, the Nimshal, authentically), and therefore if we study it through the lens of Torah, and particularly, study His Laws (as we we wrote above), we will see through the mashal, and create <em>gilui panim</em>; this <em>Yichud Elyon</em> cited by <em>Chomat Anach</em> above.</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>tl;dr:</h3>\n<p><strong>Havaya</strong> - Hashem's Name that is utterly beyond. Pertains to \"being\", but also pertains to His lofty goodness and compassion.</p>\n<p><strong>Elokim</strong> - Hashem's power of Gevura - restriction and limitation.</p>\n<p><strong>Adnut</strong> - Hashem's Name that is associated with His power of action and creation (Malchut), where, after He limits Himself by hiding behind nature, His Kingship is <em>revealed</em> as His being utterly in charge of nature - <em>Lording</em> over it.</p>\n<p>Our job is to realise that Hashem's goodness is still here in the world of nature, and is only hidden in order to allow free will. We study His Torah, and realise that the Master of Nature is actually one and the same as Havaya, the Infinite, Transcendent Havaya, Who is Good and Compassionate. Nature only exists due to His immense power of Gevura that gives us this impression, but in truth, He is Elokim, and the Master of Nature - all is One.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For a thoroughly clear, comprehensive treatment of this topic, please see this Torat Chaim by the Mittler Rebbe, of blessed and righteous memory: <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39391&st=&pgnum=146\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בעז״ה תורת אדמו״ר הרב ר׳ דובער פרשה וארא באברוסק שנת תקפ״ד יום א - הוא אהרן ומשה</a>.

Rather, it tells us that Divine Unity is\nsuch that there is no true existence other than G‑d, for all created\nbeings are completely nullified in relation to Him and are united with\nHim. This is not perceived by them nor manifest in them only because\nof the tzimtzum which conceals the Divine life-force that continuously\nbrings about their existence ex nihilo. Being unable to perceive this\nlife-force, they consider themselves to be independently existing\nentities.</p>\n<p>This concealment, of course, applies only to created beings but not to\ntheir Creator. From the Divine perspective, there is no concealment\nwhatsoever, inasmuch as Havayah and Elokim are truly one: the\nconcealment effected by Elokim thus does not act as a concealment for\nHavayah.</p>\n<p>The Alter Rebbe will now explain how the above enables us to\nunderstand the teaching of the Zohar that Shema Yisrael is\n“higher-level Unity” and Baruch shem is “lower-level Unity.”</p>\n<p>Were Divine Unity merely to signify the existence of one G‑d, it would\nbe impossible to speak of higher and lower levels of Unity. According\nto the above explanation, however, that Divine Unity means the nullity\nof created beings and their unity with G‑d, it is indeed possible to\nspeak of two diverse levels of Unity.</p>\n<p>In this sense, “higher-level Unity” refers to the Divine faculty of\ncreative speech (otherwise known as malchut), considered at the stage\nin which it is still found within its source. By way of analogy, the\nseminal letters of a person’s speech are first encapsulated within his\nthought and emotions, which will ultimately be responsible for his\nsubsequent speech. (The Rebbe notes that “this was explained in Part\nI, chs. 20-21.”)</p>\n<p>The same is true Above: When supernal creative speech is at the stage\nin which it is still included within the supernal attributes—which,\nbeing infinite, are too lofty to serve as a source of creation, for it\nis inherently limited to space and time—creation as it exists in its\nsource is united with G‑d at the higher level of Unity. Its manner of\nnullification is then similar to the nullification of the sun’s rays\nas they are found within the sun-globe.</p>\n<p>When, however, the Divine creative power of speech (or malchut), after\nundergoing a process of tzimtzumim, descends to a level at which it is\nable to serve as a source for creation, then the term “lower-level\nUnity” applies. Created beings at this level cannot be said to be\ncompletely and utterly nullified. For inasmuch as this level becomes\nthe actual source of created beings, they must perforce have some\nmeasure of identity in relation to it.</p>\n<p>Although this level, too, is pervaded by the Ein Sof-light which\nunites with the Divine faculty of creative speech, this unification is\nnevertheless one of “lower-level Unity,” wherein created beings are\nseen to have some measure of existence—albeit a nullified form of\nexistence, but existence nonetheless.</p>\n<p>With the above in mind, we may now understand the statement in the\nholy Zohar that the verse Shema Yisrael is yichuda ilaah\n(“higher-level Unity”) and that the verse Baruch shem kvod malchuto\nleolam vaed is yichuda tataah (“lower-level Unity”).</p>\n<p>וּבָזֶה יוּבַן מַה שֶּׁכָּתוּב בַּזֹּהַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ, דְּפָסוּק \"שְׁמַע\nיִשְׂרָאֵל\" – הוּא \"יִחוּדָא עִילָּאָה\", וּ\"בָרוּךְ שֵׁם כְּבוֹד\nמַלְכוּתוֹ לְעוֹלָם וָעֶד\" – הוּא \"יִחוּדָא תַּתָּאָה\",</p>\n<p>The connection between the last mentioned verse and Divine Unity is\nnow explained:</p>\n<p>For1 vaed is equivalent to echad through the substitution of letters.2</p>\n<p>כִּי \"וָעֶד\" הוּא \"אֶחָד\" בְּחִלּוּפֵי אַתְוָון.</p>\n<p>The alef of echad interchanges with the vav of vaed since both letters\nbelong to the same group of letters, viz., alef, hey, vav, yud (which,\nthe Rebbe notes, are known as otiyot hahemshech, the “connective\nletters”). The chet of echad interchanges with the ayin of vaed since\nthey share the same source (motza) in the organs of speech and thus\nboth belong to the category of “guttural letters,” viz., alef, hey,\nchet, ayin. Finally, the large daled of echad transposes into the\nsmall daled of vaed.</p>\n<p>The cause and reason for this tzimtzum and concealment with which the\nHoly One, blessed be He, obscured and hid the life force of the world,\nmaking it appear as an independently existing entity [is as follows]:</p>\n<p>כִּי הִנֵּה, סִיבַּת וְטַעַם הַצִּמְצוּם וְהַהֶסְתֵּר הַזֶּה,\nשֶׁהִסְתִּיר וְהֶעֱלִים הַקָּדוֹשׁ־בָּרוּךְ־הוּא אֶת הַחַיּוּת שֶׁל\nהָעוֹלָם כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּהְיֶה הָעוֹלָם נִרְאֶה דָּבָר נִפְרָד בִּפְנֵי\nעַצְמוֹ,</p>\n<p>I.e., the Alter Rebbe is asking why it is indeed necessary for the\nworld to appear as an independently existing entity. What would be\nlacking if the world would be perceived in its true state—as an entity\nwholly nullified in relation to its source? The reason for this is as\nfollows:</p>\n<p>הִנֵּה הוּא יָדוּעַ לַכֹּל, כִּי תַּכְלִית בְּרִיאַת הָעוֹלָם הוּא\nבִּשְׁבִיל הִתְגַּלּוּת מַלְכוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ,</p>\n<p>for “there is no king without a nation.”3</p>\n<p>דְּ\"אֵין מֶלֶךְ בְּלֹא עָם\",</p>\n<p>The word עָם (“nation”) is related etymologically to the word\nעוֹמְמוֹת (“dimmed, extinguished”), as in the expression גְחָלִים\nעוֹמְמוֹת (Rashi on Judges 5:14), describing coals in which the fire\nis not to be seen. In terms of the relationship of a king and his\nsubjects, the word עָם thus signifies those whose relationship with\nthe king is not readily apparent,</p>\n<p>פֵּירוּשׁ \"עָם\" – מִלְּשׁוֹן \"עוֹמְמוֹת\",</p>\n<p>for they—the subjects who comprise a nation—are separate entities,\ndistinct and distant from the level of the king; only upon them does\nthe king reign as a result of their nullifying themselves to him.</p>\n<p>שֶׁהֵם דְּבָרִים נִפְרָדִים וְזָרִים וּרְחוֹקִים מִמַּעֲלַת הַמֶּלֶךְ,</p>\n<p>For even if he had very many children, the term “kingship” would not\napply to them, inasmuch as the king’s children are part of the king\nhimself,</p>\n<p>כִּי אִילּוּ אֲפִילוּ הָיוּ לוֹ בָּנִים רַבִּים מְאֹד – לֹא שַׁיָּיךְ\nשֵׁם \"מְלוּכָה\" עֲלֵיהֶם,</p>\n<p>nor is it possible for a king to reign even over nobles alone.</p>\n<p>וְכֵן אֲפִילוּ עַל שָׂרִים לְבַדָּם,</p>\n<p>Although they—unlike a king’s children—are not part of him,\nnevertheless, since their position puts them in constant and close\ncontact with him, thereby lending them some of the aspects of\nkingship, the king cannot reign over nobles alone.</p>\n<p>Only “in a numerous nation is the glory of the king.”4</p>\n<p>רַק \"בְּרוֹב עָם\" – דַּוְוקָא – \"הַדְרַת מֶלֶךְ\".</p>\n<p>Only upon strangers can sovereignty apply. The same is true Above: The\nultimate intent of the revelation of Divine Kingship finds expression\nin His reigning over lowly created beings, who perceive themselves as\nexisting independently of Him—so that they, too, should humble and\nnullify themselves before Him.</p>\n<p>The Name that indicates the attribute of G‑d’s malchut (“kingship”) is\nthe Name of Adnut (“Lordship”), for His kingship lies in the fact that\nHe is L-rd of the whole universe.</p>\n<p>וְשֵׁם הַמּוֹרֶה עַל מִדַּת מַלְכוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ, הוּא שֵׁם\nאַדְנוּת, כִּי הוּא אֲדוֹן כָּל הָאָרֶץ.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is this attribute (viz., malchut) and this Name (viz., the\nName of Adnut, signifying lordship) which bring the world into\nexistence and sustain it so that it should be as it is now—</p>\n<p>וְנִמְצָא, כִּי מִדָּה זוֹ וְשֵׁם זֶה – הֵן הַמְּהַוִּין\nוּמְקַיְּימִין הָעוֹלָם, לִהְיוֹת עוֹלָם כְּמוֹת שֶׁהוּא עַכְשָׁיו,</p>\n<p>a completely independent and separate entity, and not absolutely\nnullified,</p>\n<p>יֵשׁ גָּמוּר וְדָבָר נִפְרָד בִּפְנֵי עַצְמוֹ וְאֵינוֹ בָּטֵל\nבִּמְצִיאוּת מַמָּשׁ,</p>\n<p>for with the withdrawal of this attribute and this Name from the\nworld, G‑d forbid, the world would revert to its source in the ‘‘word\nof G‑d” and the “breath of His mouth,” where it would be completely\nnullified, and the name “world” could not be applied to it at all.</p>\n<p>כִּי בְּהִסְתַּלְּקוּת מִדָּה זוֹ וְשֵׁם זֶה חַס וְשָׁלוֹם, הָיָה\nהָעוֹלָם חוֹזֵר לִמְקוֹרוֹ בִּדְבַר ה' וְרוּחַ פִּיו יִתְבָּרֵךְ,\nוּבָטֵל שָׁם בִּמְצִיאוּת מַמָּשׁ, וְלֹא הָיָה שֵׁם \"עוֹלָם\" עָלָיו\nכְּלָל.</p>\n<p>Inherent in the name “world” is being and limitation. However, in the\nstate in which the world finds itself within its source, it would have\nno “being” and would not be limited.</p>\n<p>The term “world” can be applied solely to [that which possesses] the\ndimensions of space and time,</p>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה, גֶּדֶר וּבְחִינַת שֵׁם \"עוֹלָם\" נוֹפֵל עַל בְּחִינַת מָקוֹם\nוּבְחִינַת זְמַן דַּוְקָא.</p>\n<p>“space” referring to east, west, north, and south, upward and\ndownward,</p>\n<p>בְּחִינַת מָקוֹם – הוּא: מִזְרָח וּמַעֲרָב, צָפוֹן, דָּרוֹם, מַעְלָה\nוּמַטָּה.</p>\n<p>and “time” referring to past, present, and future.</p>\n<p>בְּחִינַת זְמַן – עָבָר, הֹוֶה וְעָתִיד.</p>\n<p>Only with regard to entities that are subject to the limitations of\nspace and time can the term “world” be applied.</p>\n<p>All these dimensions of space and time have no relation to the holy\nsupernal attributes of the World of Atzilut because those attributes\nare infinite.</p>\n<p>וְהִנֵּה, כָּל בְּחִינוֹת אֵלּוּ אֵין לָהֶן שַׁיָּיכוּת בַּמִּדּוֹת\nהַקְּדוֹשׁוֹת הָעֶלְיוֹנוֹת,</p>\n<p>As explained earlier, the attribute of chesed is infinite; so, too,\nare the other attributes in the World of Atzilut. Hence, by\ndefinition, they are not at all subject to the limitations of space\nand time.</p>\n<p>Only concerning the attribute of [G‑d’s] malchut is it possible to say\nthat He is King “Above without end and below without limit” and\nlikewise in all four directions.</p>\n<p>כִּי אִם בְּמִדַּת מַלְכוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ לְבַדָּהּ, שַׁיָּיךְ לוֹמַר\nשֶׁהוּא יִתְבָּרֵךְ מֶלֶךְ לְמַעְלָה עַד אֵין קֵץ וּלְמַטָּה עַד אֵין\nתַּכְלִית, וְכֵן לְד' סִטְרִין,</p>\n<p>This means to say that G‑d is King of all creatures, from the very\nhighest to the very lowest. Thus, when speaking of malchut, it is in\norder to use terminology that has some relationship to space, such as\n“higher” and “lower.” This indicates that malchut itself has some\nrelationship to the aspects of time and space.</p>\n<p>The same is true concerning the dimension of time, i.e., that the\nattribute of malchut is in some small measure related to time, as it\nis written:</p>\n<p>וְכֵן בִּבְחִינַת זְמַן –</p>\n<p>“G‑d reigns, G‑d has reigned, G‑d will reign.”5</p>\n<p>\"ה' מֶלֶךְ, ה' מָלָךְ, ה' יִמְלוֹךְ\"</p>\n<p>I.e., G‑d’s reign is related to present, past, and future—the\ndimension of time.</p>\n<p>Thus, the life-force of space, and likewise of time, and their coming\ninto being from nothingness, and their existence as long as they shall\nexist, are from [G‑d’s] attribute of malchut and from the Name of\nAdnut.</p>\n<p>וְנִמְצָא, שֶׁחַיּוּת הַמָּקוֹם וְכֵן חַיּוּת הַזְּמַן,\nוְהִתְהַוּוּתָם מֵאַיִן לְיֵשׁ, וְקִיּוּמָם כָּל זְמַן קִיּוּמָם, הוּא\nמִמִּדַּת מַלְכוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ וְשֵׁם אַדְנוּת בָּרוּךְ־הוּא.</p>\n<p>Now, since [G‑d’s] attribute of malchut is united with His Essence and\nBeing in an absolute union, as will be explained,</p>\n<p>וּלְפִי שֶׁמִּדַּת מַלְכוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ מְיוּחֶדֶת בְּמַהוּתוֹ\nוְעַצְמוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ בְּתַכְלִית הַיִּחוּד, כְּמוֹ שֶׁיִּתְבָּאֵר,</p>\n<p>space and time which are created from malchut are therefore also\ncompletely nullified in relation to [G‑d’s] Essence and Being, just as\nsunlight whilst it is still within the orb of the sun is nullified in\nthe sun.</p>\n<p>הִלְכָּךְ, גַּם בְּחִינַת הַמָּקוֹם וְהַזְּמַן בְּטֵילִים בִּמְצִיאוּת\nמַמָּשׁ לְגַבֵּי מַהוּתוֹ וְעַצְמוּתוֹ יִתְבָּרֵךְ, כְּבִיטּוּל אוֹר\nהַשֶּׁמֶשׁ בַּשֶּׁמֶשׁ.</p>\n<p>This means to say: As long as malchut still exists in a state of\ncomplete union with G‑d’s Essence and Being, space and time—the source\nof worlds—as found within the attribute of malchut are utterly\nnullified relative to G‑d.</p>\n<p>This state is called “higher-level Unity.” It exists only before the\ndescent of malchut through various tzimtzumim in order to vest itself\nin the lower worlds, thereby creating them and providing them with\nlife. It is then that the worlds enjoy the state of “higher-level\nUnity” because from the perspective of the pristine source of malchut\nand Adnut, which brings about their existence, their actual creation\nis as yet inconceivable, inasmuch as malchut and Adnut are still in a\nstate of inclusion within their source. Consequently, space and time\n“exist” there in the same manner as the light of the sun “exists”\nwithin the sun in a state of complete nullity.</p>\n<p>And this is the [meaning of the] alternation of the [letters of the]\nName of Adnut with the [letters of the] Name Havayah.</p>\n<p>וְזֶהוּ שִׁילּוּב שֵׁם אַדְנוּת בְּשֵׁם הֲוָיָ\"ה,</p>\n<p>When the letters of one Divine Name are alternated with the letters of\nanother, the Name whose initial letter appears first is the dominant\none, the second Name being intertwined and encompassed by it. If, for\nexample, the first letter is the initial of the Divine Name that\ndesignates chesed and the second letter is the initial of the Divine\nName that designates gevurah, the revelation of chesed will\npredominate.</p>\n<p>One speaks of “the alternation of the [letters of the] Name of Adnut\nwith the [letters of the] Name Havayah” when referring to malchut and\nAdnut while they are still united with G‑d’s Essence and Being, which\nare too lofty to serve as a source for created beings.</p>\n<p>The eventual source of the existence of created beings is malchut and\nAdnut. Nevertheless, since the Divine Name Havayah is dominant—i.e.,\nsince Adnut is submerged within Havayah—all “existence” is completely\nnullified in relation to G‑d’s Essence and Being, just as sunlight is\ndevoid of all identity within the sun.</p>\n<p>The Name Havayah indicates that He transcends time, that “He was, is,\nand will be—all at the same instant,”</p>\n<p>כִּי שֵׁם הֲוָיָ\"ה מוֹרֶה שֶׁהוּא לְמַעְלָה מִן הַזְּמַן, שֶׁהוּא\nהָיָה הֹוֶה וְיִהְיֶה בְּרֶגַע אֶחָד</p>\n<p>Past, present and future meld into one within the Name Havayah,\nindicating that Havayah transcends time,</p>\n<p>as is stated (6in Raaya Mehemna on Parashat Pinchas),</p>\n<p>כְּמוֹ שֶׁכָּתוּב [בְּרַעְיָא מְהֵימְנָא פָּרָשַׁת פִּנְחָס],</p>\n<p>and likewise, [the Name Havayah] transcends space, for [Havayah]\ncontinuously brings into existence the whole dimension of space, from\nthe uppermost level [of space] to the lowermost level [of space] and\nin the four directions.</p>\n<p>וְכֵן לְמַעְלָה מִבְּחִינַת מָקוֹם, כִּי הוּא מְהַוֶּה תָּמִיד אֶת\nכָּל בְּחִינַת הַמָּקוֹם כּוּלּוֹ מִלְמַעְלָה עַד לְמַטָּה וּלְד'\nסִטְרִין.</p>\n<p>Clearly, the Divine Name Havayah transcends time and space.</p>\n<p>Malchut and Adnut, however, do bear some relation to time and space.\nNevertheless, since the letters of the Name of Adnut are interspaced\nwithin the letters of the Name Havayah, the dimensions of time and\nspace are completely nullified in relation to G‑d.

It is, therefore, written \"over My people and My inheritance, Israel.\" And (Ibid. 19) \"Egypt shall be a wasteland, and Edom, a desolate desert because of the sons of Judah, in whose land they have spilled innocent blood.\" At that time (Ibid. 10) \"Judah will endure forever, and Jerusalem, from generation to generation,\" and (Ibid. 21) \"And absolve them of their blood, I will not absolve them.\" When?

In contrast, the Kabbalistic\napproach did not include the first two names of G‑d, instead, it\nregards them as introductory notes - as the source for the thirteen\nattributes of mercy.</p>\n<p>י-ה-ו-ה / Hashem — compassion before a person sins;</p>\n<p>י-ה-ו-ה / Hashem — compassion after a person has sinned;</p>\n<p>א-ל / G‑d — mighty in compassion, to give all creatures according to\ntheir need;8</p>\n<p>רַחוּם / rachum — merciful, that humankind may not be distressed;</p>\n<p>וְחַנּוּן / ve’chanun — and gracious if humankind is already in\ndistress;</p>\n<p>אֶרֶךְ אַפַּיִם / erech apayim — slow to anger;</p>\n<p>וְרַב-חֶסֶד / ve’rav chesed — and plenteous in kindness;</p>\n<p>וֶאֱמֶת / ve’emet — and truth;</p>\n<p>נֹצֵר חֶסֶד לָאֲלָפִים / notzer chesed laalafim — keeping kindness\nunto thousands;</p>\n<p>נֹשֵׂא עָוֹן / noseh avon — forgiving iniquity;</p>\n<p>וָפֶשַׁע / vafeshah — and transgression;</p>\n<p>וְחַטָּאָה / VeChata'ah — and sin;</p>\n<p>וְנַקֵּה / VeNakeh — and pardoning.</p>\n<p>The consensus amongst the Rabbinic authorities leans towards the\nkabbalistic approach. One of the reasons given for this is because in\nhalachik analysis, when Torah is discussing a matter which has strong\nties to Kabbalah, then the kabbalistic approach is the accepted\nopinion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in the first way, \"long to anger\" is counted twice, once for righteous ppl and once for wicked, and \"for thousands\" is counted as separate for \"he guards kindness\".</p>\n<p>I'm still not sure what the meaning of \"for thousands\" is alone, when counted by itself.</p>\n<p>It references:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li><p>Idra Raba 131b, Etz Chayim - Shaar Erech Anpin Chp.11.

And what is explained in Derech Emes on Zohar I 2a,\nsection 4, in the first opinion, requires further analysis. And were I\nnot afraid, I would say it is not from Rav Chaim Vital, since it is\nthe opposite of what is explicitly explained everywhere in the\nwritings of the Arizal, and it has already been written that several\nnotes from Imrei Binah were mixed in by mistake of printers in Derech\nEmes).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>“El Rachum” (Merciful G-d) — (as in Sefer Chassidim §213; Maharal of Prague in Netivos Olam, Netiv HaTeshuvah chapter 6; and what is cited\nthere as proof from Zohar III and from the Talmud—I have not merited\nto understand, for on the contrary, it proves like the opinion of the\nArizal).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And the decision in matters of esoteric Torah — must follow the ruling\nof the sages of Kabbalah, particularly since they also considered the\nwords of Tosafos, Rabbeinu Gershom, and others. And nevertheless they\nconcluded as above. And already the Chida wrote in his commentary to\nthe Siddur HaShelah there, as follows: “Our master (the Arizal) and\nTosafos in Rosh HaShanah investigated how to count the Thirteen\nAttributes, because in their days the holy Zohar had not yet been\nrevealed. And in the Zohar and in the writings of our master the\nArizal their order and their secret were revealed to us.”</p>\n<p>And according to the revealed Torah one may say it depends on the\ntextual version of the Talmud. For the version of the Rif and the Rosh\nis that the teaching of Rabbi Yochanan—‘a covenant is established with\nthe Thirteen Attributes’—comes immediately after the teaching on\n‘Havayah, Havayah.’ Therefore one can say that this is the beginning\nof the Thirteen Attributes, and this explains the connection of the\nRosh and the Tosafists (whose heads were Rabbenu Tam, etc.). Similarly\nwith the Rif and the Geonim.</p>\n<p>However, according to the version of the Talmud that has spread and\nbeen accepted by us, the teaching of ‘a covenant is established with\nthe Thirteen Attributes’ is preceded in the Talmud with the words E-l,\nRachum, etc. (and so too is the version in the Ein Yaakov). This is\ntherefore a decisive proof that the beginning of the count is E-l, as\nMaharal writes there, and as also brought in Etz Yosef. (And in\nDikdukei Sofrim no change of version was brought here).</p>\n<p>Now, the Rosh asks there: if not according to Rabbenu Tam’s opinion,\nwhy is the custom that when the congregation recites the Thirteen\nAttributes aloud, they begin from the words Havayah, Havayah?</p>\n<p>And the answer is clear according to what is written in the Arizal’s\nworks: these two Names of Havayah are the source of all the Thirteen\nAttributes. And this is also understood according to Chassidus from\nwhat is written in Likkutei Torah, discourse “Vehayah bayom hahu\nyitaka,” and in Torah Or, Parashas Miketz, at the end of the discourse\n“Ki Atah Neri.” And according to this one can also explain simply the\nwords of the Pesikta and Shocher Tov, according to the Arizal. The\nwords of the congregation are thus: “(You) Havayah, Havayah (we\nrequest that You be) E-l Rachum, etc.”</p>\n<p>As for the further question of the Rosh, that “Notzer chesed\nla’alafim” (“preserving kindness for thousands”) should count as one\nattribute—this is already resolved in Tosafos there.</p>\n<p>And this resembles the principle: the halacha follows Rav in\nprohibitions, and Shmuel in civil law (see Rosh, Bava Kama 27b; see\nalso Shulchan Aruch of the Alter Rebbe, Orach Chaim 268, Sefer Shaar\nHaKolel, and his Tehillato).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If doubt in Torah was intentionally made, then why is it moral to sanction the kofer?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I see Rabbi's saying Hashem cannot reveal himself, because then everyone would have emunah, and then there is no room to misbehave. Therefore how is it moral to sanction people for being a Kofer BaTorah? For example, there are cases, that if someone becomes secular, then their family will not speak to them anymore.</p>\n<p>I am not asking why hashem does not make someone explode if they light a match on shabbos, that does take away free will. But simply revealing himself is different, someone can know the truth, have emunah and still choose to violate it, there are people in yeshiva right now who pray 3 times a day put tefillin believe in hashem yet still choose to waste seed. They aren't saying in that moment \"I disbelieve in Hashem\" They are sinning while still believing. Therefore I don't think this argument that hashem cannot reveal himself as that removes free choice is a valid one. There is no downside, it would only make it fair to sanction those who do not follow the laws of Torah as there wouldn't be doubt of torah's divinity yes? And if you are going to say we can't have no doubt of the divinity of the torah then how can a family shame, think bad of and put them in cherem over a maybe I don't get that part.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, evil people can live and receive blessing, which is a curse on the world.</p>\n<p>The Torah only discusses blessing and curse in the context of reward and punishment for good and evil behavior. The only reason the words טוב and רע are (usually) not explicitly written, is because they can be inferred: Hashem clearly wants us to do what’s good, and to avoid what’s evil. When He tells us what to do and avoid, it’s clear that He’s telling us what’s good and evil. Explicitly saying so would be a waste of ink.</p>\n\n\n",

This enables it to perform\nspecific actions, such as drawing, writing, or giving to another.</p>\n<p>For if not for the fingers, even though the full power of action would\nbe present in the hand, it would not be able to bring about any\nspecific effect, since the force of the hand is singular and\nundivided. The fingers are what cause the division into particular\ndetails.</p>\n<p>This parallels the known concept regarding the breath of speech, which\nis divided through the <strong>five articulatory organs</strong>, which likewise\ncorrespond to the five <em>Gevurot</em> that separate the breath. Without\nthese divisions, speech would remain a simple, undifferentiated\nbreath, with no distinct combinations of letters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, this is just an analogy. See what he writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Mitzvotekha%2C_The_commandment_of_the_Omer.1?lang=he&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מצות הקרבת וספירת העומר א׳</a> to help understand the Nimshal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה בחי' דיבורו ית' מתחלק לה' מוצאות שכמו עד\"מ באדם הבל הדבור מתחלק\nבה' מוצאות כן בחי' מל' ורוח פיו ית' הנק' ה' מתחלק לה' מוצאות שהוא ענין\nהתחלקות האור והחיות הכללי למדריגות ובחי' שונות ומובדלות זו מזו וזהו\nענין ד' חיות שבמרכבת יחזקאל הם ד' מחנות שכינה שהם מחנה מיכאל מחנה\nגבריאל כו' שהם בחי' שונות לפי שכל א' מקבל ממוצא מיוחד נבדל מזולתו</p>\n<p>And behold, the aspect of His blessed speech is divided into the five\narticulations (<em>motza'ot</em>), for just as, by way of analogy, in a human\nbeing, the breath of speech is divided into five sources of\narticulation, so too, the aspect of <em>Malchut</em> and the breath of His\nmouth, may He be blessed, which is called the letter <em>Hei</em>, is divided\ninto five articulations.</p>\n<p>This represents the division of the general light and vitality into\ndifferent levels and distinct aspects.</p>\n<p>And this is the concept of the four <em>Chayot</em> in the Chariot of\nEzekiel, which correspond to the four camps of the <em>Shechinah</em>: the\ncamp of Michael, the camp of Gavriel, etc. These represent different\naspects, for each one receives from a distinct and separate\narticulation source.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the way you are trying to correlate the 5 <em>motza'ot</em> to the Sefirot is incorrect. He goes on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אך מה שאינן אלא ד' ולא חמש הוא לפי שמוצא החמישי אינו מכלל המוצאות\nהנמשכות לנבראים כמו ד' מוצאות הנשארים אלא הוא מקור הכוללם יחד שממנו\nיתחלקו אח\"כ בפרט לבחי' שונות הגם שממנו נמצאים אותיות גיכ\"ק והיינו מפני\nשנאמר חכו ממתקים (שה\"ש ה' ט\"ז)</p>\n<p>However, the reason they are only four and not five is because the\nfifth articulation is not part of those that extend to the created\nbeings like the remaining four. Rather, it is the source that\nencompasses them all together, from which they subsequently divide\ninto distinct aspects.</p>\n<p>Even though from it emerge the letters <em>Gimel, Yud, Chaf, Kuf</em>\n(<em>Gichak</em>, letters pronounced in the palate), nevertheless, this is\nbecause it is written: <em>\"His palate is sweetness\"</em> (Song of Songs\n5:16).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain that letters from the palate, <em>Gichak</em>, corresponds to spiritual delight and understanding, <em>Chochma</em> (and <em>Keter</em>), and thus the source of all the letters. <em>Gichak</em> thus encompasses the other four <em>motza'ot</em> beneat it, which create, through combinations of letters listed in Sefer Yetzira, the four \"Camps of the Shechina\", i.e. the four angelic camps listed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.2.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Rabba</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Micha'el (<em>Chesed</em>)</li>\n<li>Gavriel (<em>Gevura</em>)</li>\n<li>Raphael (<em>Tiferet</em>)</li>\n<li>Uriel (<em>Malchut</em>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>and that all camps have many myriads of angels, from which arise all the combinations of the Sefirot that Hashem creates through this articulating His Divine breath; His Divine speech.</p>\n<p>The source of the letters are much higher. To get an introduction to this, study <a href=\"https://he.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5899070\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">להבין מ\"ש באוצ\"ח</a> in the <em>hosafot</em> to the Alter Rebbe's Likkutei Torah. The letters we are currently talking about stem from the lowest aspect of Chochma, representing the waste product of Chochma. Our souls are made of letters, and our Chochma, wherein dwells the Ohr Ein Sof, must crystallise/clump together into letters in order to reveal itself. These letters of <em>machshava</em> become letters of <em>dibbur</em>. Notably, this process happens in higher realms too, all the way to the Ohr Ein Sof Himself, where are hidden the 231 Gates (unordered 2-distinct-letter pairings) in the <em>Tiharu Ila'ah</em>, which are revealed in the <em>Reshimu</em>. These act as \"horses\" to bring their Master - Hashem's Ohr, exalted far beyond the realm of <em>hishtalshelut</em> - into the lower realms, clothed as letters of Torah.</p>\n<p>This of course is just to whet the appetite for those who wish to learn these amazing ma'amarim. All will make a lot more sense and be explained in far more depth and clarity, and makes for a truly beautiful lesson. It will also deepen one's understanding of <em>tzimtzum</em>.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Likkutei_Torah%2C_Shir_HaShirim.26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אני ישנה ולבי ער קול דודי דופק פתחי לי כו׳</a></p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, the verse states: “Whether it is of bird or of animal” (Leviticus 7:26).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara continues and explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מָה עוֹף וּבְהֵמָה מְיוּחָדִין, שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהֶן טוּמְאָה קַלָּה וְטוּמְאָה חֲמוּרָה, וְיֵשׁ בָּהֶן אִיסּוּר וְהֶיתֵּר, וְהֵן מִין בָּשָׂר – אַף כֹּל שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהֶן טוּמְאָה קַלָּה. אוֹצִיא דַּם מְהַלְּכֵי שְׁתַּיִם – שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהֶן טוּמְאָה חֲמוּרָה, וְאֵין בָּהֶן טוּמְאָה קַלָּה. אוֹצִיא דַּם שְׁרָצִים – שֶׁאֵין בָּהֶם טוּמְאָה חֲמוּרָה. אוֹצִיא דַּם בֵּיצִים – שֶׁאֵין מִין בָּשָׂר, <strong>דַּם דָּגִים דַּם חֲגָבִים – שֶׁכּוּלּוֹ הֶיתֵּר</strong></p>\n<p>The baraita explains the derivation from the verse: Just as birds and animals are unique in that they have the capacity for both a light form of ritual impurity, if they become impure after they are slaughtered, in which case they are considered impure food, and a severe form of impurity, if they die without valid ritual slaughter, and they have the possibility of being forbidden or permitted, and they are a type of meat, so too, everything that has the capacity for both a light form of impurity and a severe form of ritual impurity, and has the possibility of being forbidden or permitted, and is a type of meat, is included in the prohibition. I will therefore exclude the blood of bipeds, as they have the capacity for a severe form of ritual impurity, i.e., the impurity of a corpse, but they do not have the capacity for a light form of ritual impurity, since the halakhot of the impurity of food do not apply to the human body. I will likewise exclude the blood of creeping animals, which do not have a severe form of ritual impurity. Impurity transmitted to a person by the carcass of a creeping animal does not render clothing impure, whereas impurity transmitted by the carcass of an animal or bird does render one’s clothing impure. I will also exclude the blood of eggs, as they are not a type of meat, and finally <strong>I will exclude the blood of fish and the blood of grasshoppers, as they are entirely permitted</strong>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Keritot.21b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">as explained on 21b</a>. (William Davidson translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as the second verse you bring from Vayikra 17:14 note the Netziv in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.17.14?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Haamek_Davar_on_Leviticus.17.14.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ha'amek Davar</a> commentary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי נפש כל בשר. היינו של חיה ועוף מה שהוא פראי</p>\n<p>For the soul of all flesh — meaning of wild animals and birds, that which is untamed (wild).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, despite it saying \"the life of all flesh\" - it is still only referring to birds and wild animals.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How come Hebrew/Judaism doesn't have a distinctive noun for God?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Correct me if I'm missing something here, but I wonder why the Holy Language, the heart of a truly monotheistic religion, does not have a unique noun for God. (I don't mean His proper name, YHWH, but a noun like Θεός (Theos) in Greek, or “God” in English.)</p>\n<p>How come אל/אלוהים is used for God (YHWH), god (foreign), angels, divine beings, idols, human kings/judges, and more, and there is no dedicated noun for the only God?</p>\n<p>How did God envision writing a foundational book where it is impossible to distinguish between all of them without sufficient context?</p>\n<p>I’m looking for Rabbinic sources dealing with this conundrum.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Depends what you are talking about. God is just a word that means \"creator and ruler\", and we do call God \"HaBoreh\", and \"Adonai\", both terms in Lashon HaKodesh.</p>\n<p>However, the Rabbis have long taught us that these are just descriptions, similar to \"job\" descriptions. He is beyond all appellation and description, beyond pronouns, language, reference, definition, limitation, category, species or relation. His Essence and Being precede all of those, and therefore there is no \"essential\" description of Him. Therefore, all we have is His Name, and His \"job descriptions\" as provided in the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From the comments, it seems you’re asking this from the perspective that the lack of a <em>unique noun</em> for the One God of monotheism indicates that there was no such concept in the Biblical period.</p>\n<p>This reasoning is deeply flawed:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>English doesn’t have one either. The only way English differentiates between a polytheistic god and a monotheistic God, is through capitalization. In the spoken language, they remain the same word. Despite this, there are plenty of English-speaking monotheists (such as yourself, I presume). Furthermore, almost every English speaker is perfectly capable of determining what any given speaker means when he says “god”, purely from semantic and pragmatic context.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It’s a general rule in colloquial human languages that when a new concept is introduced, people don’t just arbitrarily invent a new noun. Rather, they use a <em>meaningful description</em>, which often (but not always) becomes specialized over time.\n<br />\n<br />\nTo illustrate, when pianos were invented, Italians didn’t name it an arbitrary sequence of sounds like “kuptarol” or something. Instead, they referred to it as “piano-forte” (gentle-strong), referencing its ability to play various degrees of volume. This description later became considered a noun in its own right. Furthermore, even in Italy, the word is occasionally clipped to just “piano”, which still means “gentle”. Obviously, that doesn’t indicate that Italians don’t distinguish between the concepts of gentleness and piano-ness. That would be absurd.\n<br />\n<br />\nThere’s no reason to assume that the Hebrew word for God would be an exception. Rather, the Hebrews used the existing Canaanite word for a powerful being—אל(הים)—as a description of Hashem (cf. the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/116852/32959\">Kuzari</a>. That description became considered a Name, <em>in addition to retaining its older, more general meaning of a powerful and exalted being</em>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In short, there is no “conundrum” to be discussed. The absence of a <em>unique</em> noun for a given concept, can’t be taken to indicate that no such concept exists in the minds of the language’s speakers.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>My understanding is that we can't have a full grasp of understanding H'. That being the case, we can't have a word that fully encapsulates His being. All we can do is refer to him in the ways we comprehend him interacting with us, hence us using what you might call \"borrowed\" words.</p>\n<p>At the same time, note that seeing as H' is the one who created everything, including lashon hakodesh (and any language for that matter), this means that He wants us to call Him as he relates to us. So really we know Him as he chooses to relate to us and in the names He chooses for us to use for Him.</p>\n<p>Since we relate to H' based on how He allows us to perceive His interaction with us, the names we use for Him are, by definition, going to need to have other meanings in order to have that depth.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Who was Rav Abun of Narbonne\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an entry for one of the Rishonim, the sefer \"The Rishonim\" mentioned someone named R' Abun who was the first rosh yeshiva in Narbonne Province. It also mentions that he is the great-great-grandfather of R. Moshe Hadarshan. He sounds like an interesting talmid chochom. If someone knows anything about him, please say something.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Rabbi Abun lived during a murky period in Ashkenazi history, and we have little information regarding the various figures of the time. I don't know which book you're referring, but Raavad (Rabbi Avraham Ibn Daud)'s Sefer Hakabbalah is the main source we have for Rabbi Moshe Ha'Darshan's lineage. There he stated:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והיו בנרבונה חכמים גדולים ראשי ישיבה...הראשון הידוע לנו בקבלותינו ר' יעקב הנביא גאון בר' משה בר' אבון. והרב ר' יהודה בר' משה הנקרא דשא דונזילה וקבל מרבינו גרשום ורבץ תורה בנרבונה והעמיד תלמידים...\"</p>\n<p>\"And there were in Narbonne great sages, heads of yeshivas...the first who is known to us in our traditions is R. Yaakov the Prophet, son of R. Moshe, son of Rabbi Abun. And Rabbi Yehudah, son of R. Moshe who is known as de sa Donçela (of the damsel), and he received from Rabbeinu Gershom and taught Torah in Narbonne and taught students...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So really the first known Rosh Yeshiva of Narbonne was Rabbi Yaakov the Prophet (on this title, see for example <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/120895/20472\">here</a>). It was conjectured by modern historians (e.g., Avraham Grossman, Chananel Mack) that Rabbi Yehudah b. Rabbi Moshe Ha'Darshan refers to Rabbi Moshe Ha'Darshan's son, and that the previous figure, Rabbi Yaakov, is also related to the same family, perhaps being Rabbi Moshe's father. That would make Rabbi Abun Rabbi Moshe Ha'Darshan's great-grandfather.</p>\n<p>Both Grossman and Mack also proposed that this Rabbi Abun may be identified with Rabbi Abun the Great (רבי אבון הגדול), or a descendant of his. Rabbi Abun the Great lived ca. the early 10th century CE, and was a descendant of Rabbi Shimon of Le Mans in France, as well as a member of the Kalonymos family. Helpfully enough, on <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%97%D7%AA_%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrew Wikipedia</a> there's a family tree for the Kalonymos family (an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalonymos_family#Family_members_to_1080\" rel=\"noreferrer\">English version</a> can also be found, but it does not include Rabbi Abun). Per that tree, which is based on a variety of sources, Rabbi Abun was a great-grandson of Rabbi Moshe ben Kalonymos, who is known to have received Kabbalistic teachings from <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95_%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%90\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abu Aharon ben Rav Shmuel the Babylonian</a>. The oldest known ancestor of the family is the ca. 8th century CE Rabbeinu Meshulam.</p>\n<p>Other prominent descendants of Rabbi Abun include: Rabbi Shimon the Great of Mainz (in turn an ancestor of several prominent rabbis, such the family of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_of_London\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe of Londres [London]</a>), and the Chassid family: Rabbi Kalonymos Ha'Chassid, Rabbi Shmuel Ha'Chassid and Rabbi Yehudah Ha'Chassid. It is believed that Rashi may have also been a descendant of Rabbi Abun (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=35389&pgnum=348\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>To my knowledge, no teachings of Rabbi Abun have been preserved, but perhaps some may yet turn up in the future (B\"H new-old materials pop up every now and then).</p>\n<p>To sum up what we know about Rabbi Abun: He came from the prominent Kalonymos family, specifically from a French branch that at one point settled in Le Mans, France. Descendants of his eventually moved to Narbonne (it's not known whether he himself also lived there; considering other descendants lived in Mainz and elsewhere, it doesn't appear necessary to assume this). He had many prominent descendants, among them perhaps Rabbi Moshe Ha'Darshan and perhaps also Rashi.</p>\n<p>For more general information, see for example: Hannanel Mack, <em>The Mystery of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan</em> (Hebrew), Jerusalem 5770/2010, pp. 65-66; Asher Frishman, <em>The Early Ashkenazi Jews: Since Their Settlement in North-West Europe to the First Crusade</em> (Hebrew), Tel Aviv 2008, pp. 121, 405-408.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore he must be strong and courageous of spirit, to fight both from the front and from the back, and he should not set his heart on all the words that people speak — whether before him or behind him. Rather, he should be like a lion and a snake: the lion’s strength is in facing forward, <strong>and the snake’s strength is from behind</strong>. And this is a fitting allusion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So possibly, they were just more savvy to the way of conflict and had an heightened awareness to the mumblings \"behind\" them, and thus the snake reference is the ability to also retaliate from the back.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.16?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.49.16.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דן ידין עמו. זה שמשון שהיה משבט דן והיה שופט ישראל ועל כן הזכיר ידין כי היה שופט לא מלך, כאחד שבטי ישראל כמיוחד שבשבטים זה יהודה שכתוב בו ידך בערף אויביך גם השופט הזה יגבר על אויביו וינצחם</p>\n<p>דן ידין עמו, “Dan will judge his people.” This is a reference to Samson the judge who was a member of the tribe of Dan. The reason Yaakov said ידין “he will judge,” is because Samson was only a judge and not a king. כאחד שבטי ישראל, “uniting the tribes of Israel.” The word כאחד is to be understood as כמיוחד, “like the unique one amongst the tribes,” like Yehudah of whom it is said that his hands were at the nape of his enemies. The judge Samson from the tribe of Dan would display similar strength when vanquishing his enemies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Shimshon like the kings who came from Yehuda were similar in the fact that they were unique in the level of strength they demonstrated when fighting their enemies. Indeed the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Isaiah.14.29.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> notes that the reference of snake in the posuk in Yeshaya that you brought is alluding to a viper, a more harmful serpent rather than a \"regular\" snake.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.49.16?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Tur_HaArokh%2C_Genesis.49.16.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur Ha'Aruch</a> makes a similar assessment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כאחד. פי' כמיוחד שבשבטים דהיינו יהודה. אי נמי פי' ידין עמו כאחד שדן לכל ישראל כאחד ודימה שמשון לנחש <strong>שלא הי' מקבץ חיל לבוא עליהם אלא הוא לבדו יוצא אליהם כמו הצפעוני היוצא ממאורה על הולכי הדרך</strong></p>\n<p>כאחד, “similar to the “one,” i.e. the tribe of Yehudah who normally played the role of saviour of his people. The meaning could also be that Shimshon, from the tribe of Dan, would be the only judge who would rule over the entire people, something that otherwise would be the prerogative of the tribe of Yehudah. Yaakov likened Shimshon the Danite to a snake, <strong>as just like a snake he acted on his own, without the support of an army. He acted aggressively just as certain types of snakes who attack unsuspecting travelers without warning</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Trop for reading Torah on Leil Rosh Hashanah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the Arvit service on Leil Rosh Hashanah, after the sh'ma and the amidah, in <a href=\"https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/resources-ideas/lev-shalem-series/mahzor-lev-shalem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Machzor Lev Shalem</a> (common in Conservative congregations) there's a section called \"Kiddush Hashanah\" for the dedication of the new year. (Mostly piyyutim, and an announcement of the year.)</p>\n<p>In my machzor, this section begins with Torah: B'reishit 1:1–5. (You're not getting out a sefer Torah for a whole torah service here – just reading a few verses from the machzor.) Is it traditional to read these verses, or chant them? If you chant, do you use the special torah trop for high holy days, or the more common one that we use on Shabbat/Monday/Thursday?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is not well-sourced, but based on usual Conservative practice, if you read from the Torah scroll, then you use the appropriate trope for the occasion, and on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, that would be the High Holiday trope or <em>stubentrop</em> as it is traditionally called in <em>minhag ashkenaz</em>.</p>\n<p>If however, you are <em>not</em> performing an actual <em>kriat Torah</em> from the scroll (which you would not be for this little pious interlude in the evening between Aleinu and Kiddush), but are instead just reading Torah verses similar to how one does in <em>birchot ha-shachar</em>, then the congregation or Ba'al/Ba'alat Tefillah has wide latitude in choosing how to intone the verses. They could choose to read it in trope, similar to how many congregations execute Shema, they could choose to read it in English or spoken Hebrew, or they could choose to use any appropriate tune. There is not a set tradition for it, so one must use judgement as to what is appropriate in the setting.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Jewish sources linking Caleb & Rachav to King David",
    "content": "# Jewish sources linking Caleb & Rachav to King David\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The opening of the book of Chronicles is a bit of a muddle, particularly the part around Caleb. He has several sets of descendants and seems to be married to Miriam, Pharaoh's Daughter (midrash). I had \"known\" until now that he was married to Rahav but just discovered that <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.14b.13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilla 14b</a> says Joshua married Rahav.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the Christian Bible's book of Matthew says Rahav married Salmon/Salma (Nachshon's son) and was Boaz's mother.</p>\n<p>In Chronicles, there are two Salmas. One is Nachshon's son, one is Caleb's son (2:51 and 54). This son of Caleb is the \"father of Beit Lehem (Bethlehem?) and the next sentence mentions someone from בֵֽית־רֵכָֽב. (Different spelling from Rahav). One of Caleb's wives is called Efrat, which is also Beit Lehem.</p>\n<p>It would make sense that Rahav is the ancestor of the Messiah to add another questionable woman to Lot's daughters, Tamar, and Batsheva's club. And it would be cool to have David descended from Caleb because he's such an interesting character inserted into the lives of several other prominent characters. Is there a Jewish source for Caleb and Rahav being connected to David?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not aware of a connection between Rachav and David. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tanna_DeBei_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Additions_to_Seder_Eliyahu_Zuta%2C_Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.4?ven=hebrew%7CTanna_deBei_Eliyahu_Zuta&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eliyahu Zuta 22</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ראב\"י אומר למה נקרא שמה רחב משום שהיא נעשית רחבה בזכיות וזכתה שיצאו ממנה (שבעה מלכים) ושמונה נביאים.\"<br />\n\"Rabbi Eliezer ben Yaakov said: Why was she called Rachav? Because she would become wide (Rechava) with merits, and she merited that (seven kings) and eight prophets were descended from her.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other sources name the exact prophets descended from her, all long post-dating David. The section in ellipses appears in the text but many editions put in ellipses because it's thought to be a scribal error.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Kalev is an entire different story. Kalev, particularly in modern Tanach studies (I don't mean academic), is thought to have been, or represented, an ideological and political rival to the royal lineage from the family of Ram (the father of Nachshon). A good essay on the matter is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaaqov_Medan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yaakov Medan</a>'s \"\"<a href=\"https://www.herzog.ac.il/vtc/tvunot/mega4_medan.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nabal said in his heart: There is no God\", \"Ha! He who builds his house with unfairness and his upper chambers with injustice who makes his neighbors work without pay and does not give them their wages\"</a>\" (Hebrew), <em>Megadim</em> 4 (1988/5748), pp. 23-54.</p>\n<p>The gist of the idea is thus: Peretz, Yehudah's eldest from Tamar, had Chetzron, his eldest. Chetzron in his youth<sup>2</sup> had three children: Yerachmeel, Ram and Kalev/Kaluvi. The latter is most likely, from a p'shat perspective, not Kalev ben Yefuneh.<sup>3</sup> Each of the three lines vied for the position of fulfiller of Yaakov's prophecy of \"The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.49.10?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 49:10</a>). Yerachmeel, we are told (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.2.3.7?ven=hebrew%7CThe_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Sanhedrin 2:3</a>), married a foreign woman, and so was essentially cut off from the game. That left two lines: Ram and Kaluvi.</p>\n<p>Various prominent figures were descended from Kaluvi: Chur, one of the assistants of Moshe (along with Aharon and Yehoshua), Betzalel (architect of the tabernacle), Kalev ben Yefuneh (see n. 3 below). Their prominence strengthened Kaluvi's claim to the throne. Another of Kaluvi's descendants was Naval the Carmelite. This is both stated by the sages (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sanhedrin.2.3.8?ven=hebrew%7CThe_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi ibid.</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.25.3?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">held by multiple commentators</a>, and makes sense from a p'shat level (Naval is called \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.25.3?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kalibi</a>\" and the region is called \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.30.14?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Negev of Kalev</a>\"). Naval represents the epitome of disrespecting David (and by extension that of the House of Ram)'s claim to the monarchy. According to the above-linked Yerushalmi, Naval argued that both Yerachmeel and Ram lost their claims to the crown for marrying foreign wives: Yerachmeel married Atarah and Boaz, Ram's descendant, married Ruth the Moabitess. We see in the text in Shmuel that Naval greatly disrespects David - but not out of loyalty to Shaul, as was the case of the Ziphites (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.26.1?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:26:1</a>). It was because he believed he should rule after Shaul, not David.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Medan then noted that by Chazal Miriam is identified with Efrat, as well as with Puah, who was promised to be the matriarch of kings (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.11b.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 11b</a>). Miriam/Efrat seemingly lost out on the blessing by marrying Kalev ben Chur/Yefuneh, who was not the father of the royal lineage, yet the same passage in the Talmud states that David was a descendant of Miriam. Rav Medan also noted the fact that Salma of Beit Lechem, who would have made more sense to be identified with Salmon, whose descendants lived in Beit Lechem, is one of the sons of Kalev and Efrat, and Beit Lechem is called Efrat. He suggests that the solution to these problems would be identifying Salma with Salmon, and not a direct son of Kalev and Efrat, but rather: a male-line descendant of Ram and a female-line descendant of Kalev and Efrat. The joining of these two rival lines brought David. He finds some further basis for this suggestion in the verse stated by David: \"I am a stranger to my brothers, an alien to <strong>my mother's children</strong>\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Psalms.69.10?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 69:9</a>) - relatives from David's mother's side (or perhaps Salma's mother's side) alienated David for being descended from a Moabite woman; Naval, one of these extended relatives, actively disrespected David.</p>\n<p>But, as mentioned above, it was the unity between the two rival lines that brought about David, and thus both lines merited to be ancestors of the Judahite monarchy. Naval died from heartbreak when Avigail chose to recognize David's right to the crown (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.25.36-38?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:25:36-38</a>). That was the end of the male-line Kalebites' attempts of challenging the crown.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I have not seen clarifications on the matter, but my guess would be that even if we take Rachav to have been the ancestor of all of the Ephraimite kings (since Yehoshua was from Ephraim), we would still end up with more than seven, given that Omri and Achav were also ancestors of the Judahites kings, having given daughters to wed them.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> In his old age, Chetzron remarried and one of their descendants was Yair ben Menashe (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.2.21-23?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chronicles 1:2:21-23</a>). Yair was adopted into the tribe of his mother, Menashe, and thus essentially got a get-out-of-jail-free-card from the Judahite political tensions of his siblings and their descendants.</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> The issue was also noted by Rav Medan, but he declined to discuss it further. I don't know what his opinion on the matter is, but personally, I favor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ze%27ev_Yavetz\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ze'ev Yaavetz</a>'s position (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36980&st=&pgnum=195\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Toldot Yisrael vol. 1, p. 195</a>, nn. 1-2) that Kalev ben Yefuneh should be identified with Kalev ben Chur, the latter being, in turn, a son of Kalev ben Chetzron.</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> Rabbi Medan also argued for the possibility that Kilav the son of David from Avigail was actually fathered by Naval, and adopted by David. If correct, this would represent another aspect of the unification of and political truce called between the two lines (Ram and Kaluvi).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What does it mean to be a \"Father\"?",
    "content": "# What does it mean to be a \"Father\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Expanding upon my earlier question about <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/151039/what-does-it-mean-to-be-ones-god\">what it means to be \"God,\"</a> I am interested in better understanding what it means for YHWH to be \"Father\" and for Israel to be His (firstborn) \"son\". I'm especially interested in any theological works that expand upon these titles in a technical way.</p>\n<p>People will often say something like \"God is the Father of all\" in the sense that He is the Creator of all. However, this doesn't seem to be the sense in which scripture uses the term. After all, Israel was not the first people on earth; thus it would not make sense to declare them them the \"firstborn son\" if this was what was meant by YHWH being their \"Father\" - nor would it explain why Israel is declared to be a \"son\" but Egypt is not.</p>\n<p>It is also interesting to note that YHWH declares Israel to be His firstborn son BEFORE he saves them and establishes himself as their God; and they His People.</p>\n<p>My current thought is that the basis for this Father-son relationship is none other than the Abrahamic Covenant and the tradition of circumcision. Circumcision of the flesh - which is symbolic of circumcision of the heart - is what establishes the Father-son relationship, and it proceeds the God-people relationship. This is reflected in the promise of the New Covenant wherein YHWH writing the His Law upon our hearts and mind proceeds Him being Israel's God and they His People.</p>\n<p><strong>Jeremiah 31:33 (Revised JPS, 2023)</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But such is the covenant I will make with the House of Israel after these days—declares GOD: I will put My Teaching into their inmost being and inscribe it upon their hearts. <strong>Then</strong> I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Albeit, the use of \"then\" here may or may not be accurate. Not all translations use it.</p>\n<p>Are there any good resources that explore this Father-son relationship?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Understanding Hashem as our Father means recognizing that our relationship with God is based on a covenantal bond like in a family; Israel is not only a subject of an almighty Creator but a child of the eternal Father; this father-child relationship was established in the covenant with Abraham and sealed through the Brit Mila; every Jew enters this familial relationship with God unconditionally and irrevocably at birth (or entry into the covenant); whether Israel behaves appropriately or not, Hashem continues to call it \"My child\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/162332#:%7E:text=%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%27%20%D7%90,%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%97%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefaria.org</a>), even if He must sometimes correct or punish it; no misconduct can erase the fundamental identity as God's son – bein kach u’bein kach kruyin banim laMakom; this understanding should give people confidence and dignity: we remain children of the King; \"Chamol al Ma’asecha\" – God ultimately has mercy on us \"like a father over sons,\" therefore there is always a way back into His arms through Teshuva.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, the sonship of Israel brings obligations with it. Just as a son honors the father, so we owe God kavod and obedience. \"Banim atem la’Hashem Elokechem\" – precisely because you are children of the Eternal, \"lo titgodedu\" – do not be disloyal or rebellious, but trust Him (Ibn Ezra on Deut. 14:1 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.14.1?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefaria.org</a>). The covenant in the flesh and in the heart demands that we live differently from nations that do not know God – \"lo ta’asu kema’aseihem … ki am kadosh atah\" (Ibn Ezra ibid.). A child of the king must prove worthy of their status. In modern language: Our identity as children of God should be an incentive for moral greatness and holiness. For the Shem haAv (Name of the Father) is upon us – \"banim atem la-Hashem Elokeichem\" is both an honor and an obligation. The Halacha teaches us in every area: From dietary laws to mourning rites – we behave differently \"for we are children of the King\". In practice, this also means that we should see each other as siblings. All Jews – indeed, all people – are ultimately children of ONE Father in heaven; therefore, the Chachamim prohibit excessive resentment or vengeance among brothers, \"lo tisna et achikha bilvavekha\" (Lev. 19:17) – \"do not hate your brother in your heart\" –, for \"ma yomar avikhem shebashamayim?\" – \"what would your Father in heaven say to this?\".</p>\n<p>Finally, the sources strengthen us that the fatherhood of God is a source of hope: Just as a loving father always opens the door to his lost son, so Hashem waits for Israel's return. Prophecy promises that full reconciliation will one day come: \"You will be called sons of the living God\" (Hosea 2:1), without blemish and alienation. In the age of Ge'ulah (redemption), the ideal \"ben yakir\" – \"a dear son\" (Jeremiah 31:20) – will be completely fulfilled. Every Jew and convert who partakes in the covenant can be certain of this love. No other faith has this intimate concept: God, the King of the universe, is also our loving Father, who educates us and never rejects us. This should ignite in us Ahavat Hashem (love of God), but also Yir'at Hashem (awe) not to dishonor the name of our Father. As it says in the Aseret Hadibrot: \"I am the Lord, your God\" – that is the paternal closeness; and at the same time \"You shall have no other gods\" – that is the exclusive loyalty a child owes to his father.</p>\n<p>Pidyon haBen (Redemption of the Firstborn): A notable legal implementation of the idea \"Israel is God's firstborn\" is found in the commandment to \"redeem\" all firstborn sons to the Kohen (God's representative); in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.3.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 3:13</a>, God says, „Kol bekhor bnei Yisrael li hu … li yihyu“ – \"Every firstborn of the children of Israel is Mine... they shall be Mine,\" as a consequence of God sparing the Israelite firstborns in Egypt.</p>\n<p>Human parents vs. God: Our duties towards earthly parents (Kibbud Av waEm) also have a connection to the relationship with God. The Gemara says: \"Shlosha shutafin yesh ba’adam: HaKadosh Baruch Hu, aviv ve’imo\" – \"Three partners are involved in a person: God, his father, and his mother\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.30b.19?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 30b</a>). Whoever honors their parents is considered as if they honor God.</p>\n<p>Prayer and Address: In Tefilla, we often address God as \"Avinu\" (Our Father) – for example, in Avinu Malkenu (Our Father, our King) or in the daily Berachot \"Avinu haAv harachaman\" (Our merciful Father). The Mishna (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Ta%27anit.2.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta’anit 2:2</a>) teaches that on Yom Kippur, the Kohen Gadol pronounced the Shem HaMeforash, and the people prayed: \"Baruch shem kevod malchuto\" etc., because Israel was allowed to plead with God as children. In the \"Prayer for the Peace of the State\", we speak of \"Avinu shebashamayim\" (Our Father in Heaven). These liturgical forms stem from the awareness that we are legitimately allowed to call God 'Father' because He Himself has called it so. The Bracha \"Avinu Malkeinu\" illustrates: God is not only a distant King but also a close Father – there is both reverence (Malchut) and love/intimacy (Av). Judaism allows – unlike some ancient philosophies – a very intimate address to God; yet reverence remains (we do not casually say \"Papa\" to God, but rather \"Avinu\" with a mix of love and reverence).</p>\n<p>Avinu shebashamayim, ten belibeinu bina lehavin u’lehaskil, lishmoa, lilmod u’lelameid, lishmor u’la’asot u’lekayem et kol divrei Talmud Toratekha b’ahavah</p>\n<p>Yehi ratzon shenizkeh kulanu lachush tamid et ahavat Avinu Malkeinu, velashuv biteshuvah shleimah elav, bimherah beyameinu, amen.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Kabbalah/Chassidut, the Father-son relationship is explain to mean that we fulfil Hashem's will in the same way that a child fulfils a father's will:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וביאור הענין בד״פ. הנה בחי׳ הנשמה המלובשת בגוף שנק׳ רגל שנת״ל הטעם מה\nשנק׳ רגל מפני שהיא בחי׳ אחרונה שבנשמה דהיינו הארה לבד שנמשכה להחיות את\nהגוף ומתלבשת בפנימיותו כו׳, הנה עוד זאת מורה שם רגל ע״ו שהוא בבחי׳\nביטול לאלקות, וכמו ביטול הרגל לגבי הראש שהוא בטל בתכלית כנראה לעין כל\nדלכל אשר יחפץ יטנו בתנועה אנה ואנה, ואין לו רצון וחפץ אחר לשנות המעשה\nמצד עצמו כלל כו׳. כמו״כ הוא מה שהנשמה נק׳ רגל והוא בחי׳ יעקב יו״ד עקב\nהוא להורות על הביטול שיש בנשמות לאלקות שבטלים בתכלית וכמא׳ ברא כרעא\nדאבוה, דמה שנק׳ כרעא דאבוה הוא מפני שיש בהבן ביטול גדול אל האב, <strong>וכמו\nשאנו רואין שמה שיעלה ברצון האב יעשה הבן תומ״י בלי שום מניעה ועיכוב\nובלי שום רצון אחר כו׳</strong>. <strong>וכמו״כ בנש״י</strong> שיש להם התקשרות וביטול לאלקות\nלהיות בטל רצונך מפני רצונו ית׳ ולקיים רצה״ע בקיום התו״מ בקעומ״ש לא מצד\nאיזה טעם ושכל, כ״א מצד הביטול שלו שבטל לאלקות בבחי׳ קעומ״ש ה״ה מקיים\nרצונו ית׳ בקיום התומ״צ כו׳. <strong>וביטול הזה אינו בהנה״א לבד, כ״א גם בהגוף\nוהנה״ט של</strong>ו</p>\n<p>And to explain the matter more precisely: the aspect of the soul that\nis enclothed in the body, which is called \"foot\" - as explained above,\nthat it is called \"foot\" because it is the last level of the soul,\nthat is, only a radiance which extends to give life to the body and\nenclothes itself inwardly within it, this too is indicated by the term\n\"foot,\" for the foot is in a state of <em>bitul</em> (self-nullification) to\nthe head. For the nullification of the foot to the head is absolute,\nas is visible to the eye: wherever the head desires, it immediately\ndirects the foot to move, without any will or desire of its own to\nalter the action at all.</p>\n<p>So too is it with the soul being called \"foot\": this is the aspect of\nYaakov i.e. <em>yud ekev</em> (\"heel\"), to indicate the <em>bitul</em> which is in\nsouls, that they are utterly nullified to G-dliness. As it is said, \"a\nson is the leg of his father\", meaning that the son is so called\nbecause of his great <em>bitul</em> to the father. <strong>For as we see, whatever\narises in the father's will, the son does immediately, without delay\nor hindrance, and without any other will of his own.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>So too with Israel</strong>: they have a connection and <em>bitul</em> to G-dliness,\nto nullify their own will before His will, and to fulfil His will in\nthe observance of Torah and mitzvot, and in accepting the yoke of\nHeaven, not because of any reason or intellect, but because of their\n<em>bitul</em>, that by being nullified to G-dliness, they fulfill His will in\nobserving Torah and mitzvot. And <strong>this bitul is not only in the Divine\nsoul, but also in the body and in the animal soul.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I.e. our soul reaches all the way up beyond the creation, right unto Hashem's very essence, higher than angels, but at its \"foot\", it is enclothed in an animal soul and physical body. <strong>Our being Hashem's \"children\" implies that despite the coarseness of the physical body and its lusts, temptations and strong, selfish will, it is still ultimately obedient to the levels above - the Godly levels that are wholly obedient and yearning for Hashem, just like a child is to his father.</strong></p>\n<p>The way to think about it is like this: when someone finds out that someone else is his father, then there is a natural force that comes over him of <em>bitul</em>; a sense of humility, deference, desire to please and serve the father. Israel have this <em>bitul</em> in their souls for Hashem, Torah and mitzvot, and it extends into their very bodies. It doesn't come from logic or convincing, it's just there.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This ma'amar gets a bit more technical. In what way are we higher than angels? <strong>We are made in Hashem's image, which specifically means that we are quite literally His children</strong>. Children are born from their parents, and as such take on their parents likeness, in every sense: they are human, but more than that, they <em>look</em> like their parents, they <em>think</em> like their parents and they have the same general personality and inclinations as their parents.</p>\n<p>In Kabbalah, the child is born from the Chochma (the intellectual sphere) of the parent, and humans (and more specifically, Israel) are born from Hashem's Chochma. Chochma contains within it the entirety of the \"humanity\" of a person, and thus the child inherits the whole spiritual DNA of the parent.</p>\n<p>Angels are not so - they not \"born\" in this way. They are specific - some are created from Hashem's Kindness, some from His Might, some from His Tiferet etc. They are more akin to \"students\" to a teacher: a student doesn't <em>inherit</em> the very essence of the intellect of the teacher, but rather just receives some external intellectual light from the teacher - a specific lesson. So too, angels receive more <em>external</em> light from Hashem, whereas <strong>souls are truly \"born\" from the inwardness of the light, i.e. as we said, similar to how a child doesn't just receive lessons from the father, but actually inherits the fathers very faculty of intellect, and thus all the other traits.</strong></p>\n<p>Deep stuff, but explained exquisitely by the Rebbe Rashab in Hemshech 5656, Rosh Hashana, where the above quote is from.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What does it mean to be one's \"God\"?",
    "content": "# What does it mean to be one's \"God\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Often times, I feel, we use the term \"God\" like a personal identifier for the LORD. This is to be expected since in Judaism there is only one proper \"God\" (although angels and men like Moses have been referred to as God as well). In fact, it appears that out of reverence for God's name, it is even common practice amongst Jews to write \"G-d\" instead of \"God\".</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the scriptures would appear to use the term more properly as a title that reflects the LORD's relationship to Israel. In fact, unless I'm reading the scriptures incorrectly, the LORD was not always \"God\". Rather, the LORD established himself as \"God\" simultaneously when he made Israel his \"people.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Exodus 6:7</strong> [<em>The Contemporary Torah, 2006</em>]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And <strong>I will take you to be My people, and I will be your God</strong>. And you shall know that I, יהוה, am your God who freed you from the labors of the Egyptians.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Leviticus 26:12</strong> [<em>The Contemporary Torah, 2006</em>]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will be ever present in your midst: <strong>I will be your God, and you shall be My people.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Jeremiah 31:33</strong> [<em>The Contemporary Torah, 2006</em>]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But such is the covenant I will make with the House of Israel after these days—declares GOD: I will put My Teaching into their inmost being and inscribe it upon their hearts. <strong>Then I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It would seem, therefore, that the biblical understanding of a \"god\" is one side of a relationship and the other side is the \"people\" who serve and follow that god. Abstractly speaking, the precise nature of this relationship may differ between different \"gods\" and \"peoples\" - but in the case of the LORD he established this relationship via the Covenant(s), Prophets, and the Law. And when people turn away from the LORD, he in turn rejects them and even ceases to serve as their \"God.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Judges 10:13-14</strong> [<em>The Contemporary Torah, 2006</em>]</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet you have forsaken Me and have served other gods. No, I will not deliver you again.<br />\nGo cry to the gods you have chosen; let them deliver you in your time of distress!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am curious about how well defined a concept the term \"god\" is in Judaism and the \"god\"/\"people\" relationship. I expect the focus will be on the LORD and Israel specifically, of course. But I am curious if there are any Jewish Rabbis or works that go into depth on this topic and explore what it means for the LORD to become \"God.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>\"To be 'G-d' in Jewish understanding means not only omnipotence in an abstract sense, but to be G-d for us – a counterpart that loves, demands, protects, and has made a covenant with us; Hashem has linked His identity with the history of Israel through revelation and redemption, which is why He is always invoked in our prayers as 'our G-d and G-d of our fathers'; this divine self-commitment to a specific people is unique, yet it does not make G-d's essence dependent on humans, but rather reveals His grace: He, the Infinite, wants to be 'the G-d' of a finite people to bring ethics and salvation to the world; Israel serves Him as Mamlechet Kohanim (kingdom of priests) and Goj Kadosch (holy nation); thus, rabbinic sources define the G-d–people relationship as an eternal covenant with mutual recognition; the Eternal is our G-d – we are His people; this formula is the essence of Judaism; may Israel always walk in the height of this calling so that 'Hashem Echad u’Schmo Echad' – G-d is recognized as the only King and His name is one in the world through His people (Zechariah 14:9).\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The destiny of Israel to be a \"light for the nations\" (אוֹר לַגּוֹיִם) emphasizes from the beginning an ethical and universal mission; already the prophet Isaiah promises Israel a role as a model and teacher for all peoples, as it is said: \"וְנָתַתִּיךָ לְאוֹר גּוֹיִם לִהְיוֹת יְשׁוּעָתִי עַד קְצֵה הָאָרֶץ\" – \"I will make you a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth\" <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">he.wikipedia.org</a>; this ideal is to be understood ethically-universalistically: Israel's task is to bring God's morality and justice closer to the world, not through coercion, but through exemplary effect; the Torah emphasizes that the nations should recognize Israel's wisdom and legal culture: \"These commandments are your wisdom and insight in the eyes of the nations,\" so that they exclaim: \"Truly, a wise and understanding people!\" (cf. Devarim/Deut 4:6-8); this is connected with the concept of Tikkun Olam (תיקון עולם), the improvement and healing of the world in accordance with the divine order; already in the ancient Hebrew Aleinu prayer, Jews pray for the world to be healed under God's kingship – \"לתקן עולם במלכות שדי\" –, expressing the universal hope that ultimately all people will call upon God's one name <a href=\"https://schechter.ac.il/article/tikun-olam\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">schechter.ac.il.</a></p>\n<p>This universal calling is inseparably linked with high ethical demands. The Talmud even explains that God scattered Israel among the nations \"only so that righteous people from the nations might join them\" – thus gaining Gerim (converts to Judaism) <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=55722#:%7E:text=%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%20%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%20%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8,%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9F%20%D7%95%D7%91%D7%94%D7%90%20%D7%A1%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%9F.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">daf-yomi.com</a>. This makes it clear: Israel is to be a light by inspiring people to find goodness and turn to God. At the same time, rabbinic tradition admonishes absolute integrity in dealing with non-Jews: Rabbi Moshe of Coucy (13th century) emphasizes in Sefer Mitzvot Gadol that the long diaspora should prompt Israel to \"stay away from vain things, hold fast to God's seal – the truth – and deceive neither Jews nor non-Jews.\" For if the Jews behaved dishonestly, \"who would join them?\" <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=55722#:%7E:text=%D7%9C%D7%A9%D7%A7%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C,%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5%20%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%A1%22.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">daf-yomi.com</a>. Only morally exemplary behavior – truthfulness, charity, and justice – makes it possible to truly be a light for the nations. This ideal also corresponds to the kabbalistic idea that Israel, through its Mitzvot, redeems hidden sparks in creation and thus purifies the entire structure of the world – a cosmic Tikkun Olam, from which ultimately all creatures should benefit.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Zohar and later Kabbalists see Israel as the spiritual center of the world: The Jewish soul carries a unique divine spark within it, which helps redeem all creation through the fulfillment of the commandments. The Ari (Rabbi Yitzchak Luria) taught that each mitzvah elevates the scattered sparks of light (ניצוצות) from the material world – ultimately a process from which the whole world spiritually benefits. Chabad Chassidism speaks of Israel being called to \"transform the world's darkness into light\" by filling the surroundings with God-consciousness. Thus, the Lubavitcher Rebbe said: \"As 'a light unto the nations'... it is Israel's duty to lead the whole world to faith in the One God\" <a href=\"https://hechabadorg.clhosting.org/library/article_cdo/aid/396336/jewish/1983.htm#:%7E:text=%D7%91%D7%94%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA%D7%9D%20%27%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%27%2C%20%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%20%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%99%2C%20%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%98%D7%9C%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%91%D7%99%D7%90%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D%20%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%95%20%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%9D.%20%D7%91%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%A8%20%2D%20%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%9C%20%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA%20%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA%20%2D%20%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%95%D7%95%D7%99%20%D7%96%D7%94%2C%20%D7%90%D7%9A%20%D7%94%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90%20%D7%94%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A8%20%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%99%D7%94%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%27%D7%AA%D7%90%20%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%95%D7%9D%27%20%D7%96%D7%94%20%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%A8%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%2D%D7%94%D7%90%D7%93%D7%9D%20%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90%20%D7%90%D7%AA%20%D7%AA%D7%A4%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%93%D7%9D%20%D7%91%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A8%20%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%9D.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hechabadorg.clhosting.org</a>.

However, Maimonides held all of those views. For Maimonides, the Torah is a human document produced by Moses, not God, and God is not involved in the world. Does that make him an Epicurean? Yes, Maimonides is a heretic according to his own law code.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You asked for one quote where Maimonides admits to being an Epicurean… there is no such quote. Maimonides is an esoteric writer, and he does not want to be accused of heresy and does not want to be excommunicated.\nExcommunication was a very severe matter, and there was the obvious fear of even being put to death for it.\n…I repeat that Maimonides is an esoteric writer, as he makes clear in his introduction to the Guide of the Perplexed. Thus, he composed his guide for two audiences, the masses and the intellectuals. However, the hints that he gives to the intellectual elite are oftentimes extremely strong and obvious.\n[…]\nIn [the] opening 4 chapters of the Foundations of Torah the material that he presents as the foundations of Judaism (Torah) is Aristotelian philosophy and science[,] clearly indicating that he is a radical Aristotelian….</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is any of this remotely plausible?</p>\n\n\n",

And all this they did in order to keep the commandment of the Lord, to go wherever He would command. And the Lord could have led them by way of the cities that were around them, but He brought them into this trial, for from it would be known that they would keep His commandments forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ralbag:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>התועלת השביעי הוא להודיע עומק מחשבות השם יתעלה שעם היות ישראל מתאחרים במדבר ארבעים שנה על צד העונש השתמש בזה לתועלת הוא לנסותם אם ישמרו מצות השם יתעלה אם לא כדי לעמוד על העת שיהיו ראויים בו לירושת הארץ ולזאת הסבה גם כן יסרם שם תכף מרותם מה שאינו ממנהג השם יתעלה כי הוא ארך אפים אבל להשגחת כל ישראל עשה זה כדי שישמרו מחטוא לי\"י ולזה גם כן ענם והרעיבם במדבר ארבעים שנה להראות לישראל נפלאות השם יתעלה כדי שיחזקו לשמור מצותיו.</p>\n<p>The seventh benefit is to make known the depth of the thoughts of the Exalted God: that although the Israelites tarried in the wilderness for forty years as a form of punishment, He utilized this for a beneficial purpose — namely, to test them, whether they would keep the commandments of the Exalted God or not, in order to determine the time at which they would be worthy of inheriting the land. For this reason, He also immediately restrained their rebelliousness there — something not in keeping with the usual manner of the Exalted God, for He is slow to anger — but for the sake of His providence over all Israel, He did this so that they would guard themselves from sinning against the Lord. For this reason as well, He afflicted them and caused them to hunger in the wilderness for forty years, to show Israel the wonders of the Exalted God, so that they would be strengthened to keep His commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The forty years in the desert were both punishment and trial. In the language of our sages: \"פורענות ודיסציפלינה גם יחד\" – a punishment that already contained within itself an educational discipline and purification.</p>\n<p>As a punishment, the forty years fulfilled the just verdict over the sinful generation: \"יִשְּׂאוּ אֶת־עֲוֹנֹתֵיכֶם אַרְבָּעִים שָׁנָה\" – \"They should bear their sins for forty years\" <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9942/jewish/Chapter-14.htm#:%7E:text=According%20to%20the%20number%20of%20days%20which%20you%20toured%20the%20Land%20forty%20days%2C%20a%20day%20for%20each%20year%2C%20you%20will%20%5Bthus%5D%20bear%20your%20iniquities%20for%20forty%20years%3B%20thus%20you%20will%20come%20to%20know%20My%20alienation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a>. The generation of the Exodus, which had tested God ten times and ultimately openly rebelled, was not allowed to enter the promised land. This verdict was harsh but necessary to preserve the holiness of the land for a faithful generation.</p>\n<p>As a test and training, the forty years were a conscious transitional period in which HaShem elevated the people to a higher level of faith. \"לְמַעַן עַנֹּתְךָ לְנַסֹּתְךָ\" – \"to humble you and to test you\" <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9972/jewish/Chapter-8.htm#:%7E:text=And%20you%20shall%20remember%20the%20entire%20way%20on%20which%20the%20Lord%2C%20your%20God%2C%20led%20you%20these%20forty%20years%20in%20the%20desert%2C%20in%20order%20to%20afflict%20you%20to%20test%20you%2C%20to%20know%20what%20is%20in%20your%20heart%2C%20whether%20you%20would%20keep%20His%20commandments%20or%20not\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a>: God subjected Israel to challenges in the desert but also unfolded constant miracles, so that the people learned humility, recognized their complete dependence on the heavenly will, and could build a deep trust relationship with HaShem. The test was therefore successful: The succeeding generation – nourished by the manna, guided by the pillar of cloud, taught by Moshe Rabbenu – finally entered the land of Canaan purified and remained faithful to HaShem (as seen in the Book of Joshua).</p>\n<p>There is no contradiction, but rather unity in duality: The punishment itself was conceived as an educational act. Or with a beautiful wordplay of the Chachamim: \"ארבעים שנה במדבר – דור נענש ומתנסה כאחד\" – \"Forty years in the desert – a generation is punished and tested as one.\" Exactly this is expressed in Devarim 8:5: God was Israel's judge and loving educator in the desert, like a father who punishes his child to bring him on the right path <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9972/jewish/Chapter-8.htm#v5:%7E:text=You%20shall%20know%20in%20your%20heart%2C%20that%20just%20as%20a%20man%20chastises%20his%20son%2C%20so%20does%20the%20Lord%2C%20your%20God%2C%20chastise%20you\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chabad.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Both verses are simultaneously true. HaShem punished the generation of the desert wanderings for their lack of Emuna, and through this very wandering, tested, educated, and strengthened the people of Israel for the future. There is no contradiction, but a holistic plan: עונש שהוא נסיון, ונסיון שבא מתוך העונש – \"a punishment that is also a test, and a test that arises from the punishment.\" Thus, we can understand the forty-year period with the words of the prophet Hosea (2:16): „וְנִסְּרְתִּיהָ לִי שָׁם“ – \"I drew her strictly to me there\" – God held Israel accountable in the desert to bind them back to Him.</p>\n\n\n",

A similar example is the name of our forefather Yitzchok. It literally <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.21.6?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">means</a> \"he will laugh\" and begins with a \"yud\" prefix, but after it became his name, it became a proper noun.

Kabbalists use lots of different vowelizations for different purposes. I personally don't know why, but you can see in some Sephardic siddurim different vowelizations for different blessings in Shmoneh Esrei. (They are not pronounced, because instead we say \"Adonoi\").</p>\n\n\n",

In rabbinic literature, the evil inclination is often discussed in contrast to its opposite, the good inclination (yetzer hatov in Hebrew).

An example of this can be found in the Torah’s account of Amalek’s attack on the fledgling Israelite nation, which relates, “He cut off among you all the weaklings … when you were faint and exhausted.” Amalek seeks to cut off the “weaklings,” namely those lacking spiritual strength, by convincing them that they are far from HaShem, and then using their despair to bring them down, chas ve-shalom.

I have seen a verse in the Torah (Numbers 19): ‘If a man dies in a tent…’ But the Torah existed before the world was created. And I see that the world was created before man, for the entire world and all its needs were created before man was created. If so, what is the meaning of this verse?\"\nThe old man replied:\n\"But it is written that the souls of the righteous were created before the world was created, as it says: ‘In the beginning God created…’ And there is no ‘beginning’ except for the soul, as it is said: ‘The soul of man is the lamp of the Lord.’ This refers to the supernal soul of man.\nThere is ‘man’ and there is ‘man’: one is the man of the soul, and one is the man of the body, as it is said: ‘Man is like a breath.’ It is about this latter that it is written: ‘If a man dies in a tent,’ and also: ‘Cursed is the man who trusts…\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Tikkunei Zohar 98b continues):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“…in man and makes flesh his strength.” <strong>This refers to Samael, the worthless man (adam beliya’al), a man of iniquity.</strong> He has two evil female counterparts. About them it is said: ‘He shall not come near any soul, neither his father nor mother shall he defile.'\nThere is no ‘father’ but the Holy One, blessed be He, and no ‘mother’ but the Shekhinah. And is it not said of them: ‘Is not My word like fire?’ says the Lord. Just as fire does not become impure, so too they do not become impure.\nHe said to him: But it is written (Numbers 19): ‘He has defiled the sanctuary of the Lord,’ and this refers to the Shekhinah.\nHe replied: Indeed, the Holy One and His Shekhinah do not become impure. But anyone who defiles the place where She dwells is considered as if he defiled Them. Therefore, it is said: ‘He shall not defile himself for his father or mother.’\nThis is the secret of one who moves from the public domain to the private domain. Therefore it is said: ‘Do not profane My holy name,’ and this refers to Adonai, which is the private domain, which is YKWK, the Unique One of the world. And this is the ‘man.’\nAnd therefore it is said: ‘He shall not defile himself for his father or mother’ — this is the secret of one who enters from the public to the private domain. And thus it is said: <strong>‘If a man dies in a tent’ — this refers to the worthless man (adam beliya’al). From this side, a wicked person is called ‘dead’ even before the world was created.</strong> But it was not said about the man who is from the side of holiness.\nHow foolish are those in the world who say: \"The Holy One, blessed be He, decreed that man should die. This is what is written: ‘If a man dies…’ How can they say that death does not come from Him?\"\nWoe to them! It would have been better had they not been created in the world. For they equate the man called Israel with the <strong>worthless man</strong>, and say: \"As the good man, so the sinner — they are all the same.\" They shall be like chaff before the wind,\" these wicked ones who say such things. The angel of the Lord drive them away.\nThere is a ‘man’ who is Israel, and there is a ‘man’ who is an angel — and this is Metatron. And there is a ‘man’ in the image of the Holy One, blessed be He —this is His emanation (Atzilut). This is the divine name Yod–He–Vav–He (YKWK), and He has no connection to Beriah (Creation), Yetzirah (Formation), or Asiyah (Action), but only to Atzilut (Emanation).\nIn that realm, there is no sin and no death, as it is written: ‘Evil shall not dwell with You.’ <strong>And regarding the worthless man (adam beliya’al), the Holy One, blessed be He, warned not to partake of him, and not to mix him with the good.</strong>\nFor he is like one who <strong>mixes</strong> silver with lead, and this causes confusion in the heavenly hosts. It is like mixing darkness with light—something the Holy One, blessed be He, separated, as it is written: ‘And God <strong>separated</strong> between the light and the darkness.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong>He that rules over his yetzer hara will ride on and rule over men of Belial:</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועם כל דא זכאה נשמתא דשליט עליה ורכיב עליה, כבר נש דרכיב על סוסיא או על חמריה, ווי ליה למאן דחוויא שליט עליה, האי אתקרי רשע גמור, ומאן דאיהו שליט עליה איהו אתקרי צדיק גמור, ועליה אתמר ואתן אדם תחתך, <strong>אדם בליעל איש און</strong>, ולאומים תחת נפשך, דכד בר נש איהו שליט על יצריה, הכי איהו שליט על כל שנאוי, ואם יצריה שליט עליה שנאוי שלטין עליה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And despite all this, fortunate is the soul that rules over and rides upon [the body],\nlike a person who rides upon his horse or donkey.\nWoe to the one over whom the serpent rules—\nthis one is called a complete evildoer (rasha gamur).\nBut the one who rules over [the soul] is called a complete righteous one (tzaddik gamur).\nAnd about him it is said: 'I will give men in exchange for you,\n<strong>a base man, a man of iniquity</strong>, and nations for your soul.'\nFor when a person rules over his inclination (yetzer),\nhe also rules over all that is hateful.\nBut if his inclination rules over him,\nthen all that is hateful rules over him.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Regarding \"what that means legally (e.g., for testimonial capacity,\" -- idk.</p>\n\n\n",

The Novarodekers went from town to building Yeshivas without a dime to their name or any foreseeable way of supporting that Yeshiva gave no thought as to how they will support it. They were confident that their Bitochen alone would take care of all material needs the Yeshiva would have .(as indeed usually happened) On the flip side they did not think that anyone was coming to learn in that Yeshiva based on their bitochen.  The very actively went from town to town recruiting students.  What principle of Bitochen caused them to think that their Bitochen would send them financial supporters but not Talmidim?</p>\n<p>Novaradak may be a more extreme example but the mindset of “we do not need to make hishtadlus for material areas because of bitochen but do need to make hishtadlus so that  external issues that  directly pertain to ruchnuis should work out” seems common among those  who are very into stressing  the power of Bitochen.

If, however, he says to you: I\nhave labored and I have found success, believe him.*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, there is a clear principle here that we only gain success if we put in effort.</p>\n<p>However, the gemara then continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הָנֵי מִילֵּי בְּדִבְרֵי תוֹרָה, אֲבָל בְּמַשָּׂא וּמַתָּן —\nסִיַּיעְתָּא הוּא מִן שְׁמַיָּא</strong>. וּלְדִבְרֵי תוֹרָה לָא אֲמַרַן אֶלָּא\nלְחַדּוֹדֵי, אֲבָל לְאוֹקֹמֵי גִּירְסָא — סִיַּיעְתָּא מִן שְׁמַיָּא\nהִיא.</p>\n<p>The Gemara comments: This applies only to matters of Torah, as\n<strong>success with respect to Torah study is in accordance with the toil and\neffort invested. But with regard to success in business, it all\ndepends upon assistance from Heaven, as there is no correlation\nbetween success and effort.</strong> And even with regard to matters of Torah,\nwe said this only with regard to sharpening one’s understanding of\nTorah, as the more one labors, the deeper the understanding of the\nmaterial he achieves. However, to preserve what one has learned, it is\ndependent upon assistance from Heaven. Not everyone achieves this,\neven with much effort.*</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The previous gemara only applies to Torah study (i.e. <em>ruchnius</em>), but not business (i.e. <em>gashmius</em>). When it comes to <em>ruchnius</em>, we are meant to make as much effort as we can and not strive to do less through increased <em>bitachon</em>.</p>\n<p><sup>* Steinsaltz translation (including inter-commentary)</sup></p>\n\n\n",

However, is this due to fundamental Jewish theology explicitly forbidding such a notion (e.g. a scriptural proof against it, some halachah forbidding it, etc.)? Or is this just the mainstream opinion, and it’s <em>technically possible</em> within Jewish theology for the Torah’s spelling to have changed?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Definitely. The gemara (Qiddushin 30a) concludes, \"ינְהוּ בְּקִיאִי בַּחֲסֵירוֹת וִיתֵרוֹת, אֲנַן לָא בְּקִיאִינַן - they [the Soferim of the early Bayis Sheini era] were experts in full and defective [spellings]; we are not experts.\" And this is their answer why the \"ו\" of \"גחון\" is no longer the middle letter of the Torah. (Nowadays the difference is about 5,000 letters.)</p>\n<p>Then there is the story of how the spelling was reconstructed in the days of Ezra, meaning what the aforementioned Soferim were experts in and Yerushalmi Taanit 20b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שלשה ספרים מצאו בעזרה: ספר \"מעוני\", וספר \"זעטוטי\" \", וספר \"היא\". באחד מצאו כתוב \"מעון א-להי קדש\", ובשנים כתיב (דברים ל״ג:כ״ז) \"מענה א-להי קדם\", וקיימו שנים וביטלו אחד. באחד מצאו כתוב \"וישלח את זעטוטי בני ישראל\", ובשנים כתוב (שמות כ״ד:ה׳) \"וישלח את נערי בני ישראל\", וקיימו שנים וביטלו אחד. באחד מצאו כתוב \"תשע היא\" ובשנים כתיב \"אחד עשר היא\", וקיימו שנים ובטלו אחד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Three scrolls were found in the Temple court: The Me'onei scroll and the Za'atutei scroll and the Hi' scroll. In one they found written \"the eternal God is Me'on\" and in two it was written \"the eternal God is Me'onah (a dwelling place)\", so they adopted the reading of the two scrolls and discarded that of the one scroll. In one they found written \"And he sent the za‘atutei (nobles) of the children of Israel\", and in the other two they found written And he sent na‘arei (the young men of) the children of Israel\", so they retained the reading of the two and abandoned that of the one. In one of the scrolls hi’ was written nine times, but in the other two hi’ was written eleven times, so they adopted the reading of the two and discarded that of the one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Translation from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/120829/1570\">this question</a>, which should be reviewed for more detail.)</p>\n<p>So we now have a Torah unlike any of those they found from the First Beis haMiqdash.</p>\n<p>Also there are spelling differences today. Interestingly, none change the meaning of the pasuq. But Ashkenazic, Sepharadic and Yemenite Sifrei Torah have spelling differences. @DoubleAa lists them in an answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/37107/1570\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>In my humble opinion, and no one else has to agree - this is from logic, not sources: it is like the famous Tanur shel Akhnai story. Hashem wants us to follow the <em>kelalei pesaq</em>, rules of halachic decision making He gave us. The holy text is thus the reconstruction, not the original. Just as we don't listen to voices from heaven, we wouldn't follow a Sefer Torah found by archeologists. Even if it could be proven to be the original that Moshe Rabbeinu put in or next to the Aron. Halakhah is a legal process, not a truth finding one. Or / and, if the halachically mandatory spelling changes, Hashem wanted that change. After all, pesaq comes with siyata diShmaya, assistance from heaven.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.30a.12?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=en&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 30a</a> (<em>Koren-Steinsaltz translation and interpretation</em>) clearly demonstrates that in the Amoraic period, Rabbis' Torah scrolls were way off (e.g., <em>in our scrolls, the Vav of Gachon is off by some 5'000 letters</em>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אמר ליה: ניתי ספר תורה ואימנינהו, מי לא אמר רבה בר בר חנה לא זזו משם עד שהביאו ספר תורה ומנאום? אמר ליה: אינהו בקיאי בחסירות ויתרות, אנן לא בקיאינן.\"\n\"Therefore, because they devoted so much time to the Bible, the first Sages were called soferim (<em>Those who count</em>), because they would count all the letters in the Torah. They would say that the letter vav in the word “belly [gaḥon]” (Leviticus 11:42) is the midpoint of the letters in a Torah scroll...<br />\nRav Yosef raises a dilemma: Does the vav of the word “belly [gaḥon]” belong to this side or to this side? Is it part of the first or second half of the Torah?<br />\nThe Sages said to him: Let us bring a Torah scroll and count the letters. Didn’t Rabba bar bar Ḥana say with regard to a different issue: They did not move from there until they brought a Torah scroll and counted the letters? Therefore, we can do the same. Rav Yosef said to them: <strong>They were experts in the deficient and plene forms of words and therefore could count the letters precisely. We are not experts in this regard, and therefore we would be unable to resolve the question even if we were to count the letters</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna in Sofrim provides another evidence of not having a standard formula:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"R. Simeon b. Laḳish said: Three scrolls of the Torah were found in the Temple court: the Ma‘on scroll, the Za’aṭuṭë scroll, and the Hu’ scroll. In one of these they found the expression of ma‘on, and in the other two it was written, The eternal God is me‘onah (a dwelling place), so they adopted the reading of the two scrolls and discarded that of the one scroll. In another of the scrolls they found it written, And he sent the za‘aṭuṭë (nobles) of the children of Israel, and in the other two they found written And he sent na‘arë (the young men of) the children of Israel, so they retained the reading of the two and abandoned that of the one. In one of the scrolls hu’ was written eleven times, but in the other two hi’ was written eleven times, so they adopted the reading of the two and discarded that of the one.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And <strong>the final, and probably most valid, argument is that the entire Mishna (see Maseches Sofrim) does not mention the importance of precision in the Torah scrolls.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

And so we have learned from the early Sages from the very announcement (the prophecy): in everything, if a prophet says to you, “transgress the words of the Torah,” like Elijah on Mount Carmel, listen to him—except for idolatry; and this matter will be according to the circumstance, like Elijah on Mount Carmel, who brought an offering outside the Temple, and Jerusalem was chosen, and the one who offered outside is liable to kareth (spiritual excision). And because he is a prophet, it is a commandment to listen to him. And also concerning this it is said: “To him you shall listen” (Deuteronomy 18:15). And if they asked Elijah and said to him, “How can we uproot what is written in the Torah: ‘Take heed to yourself that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every place’?” (Deuteronomy 12:13), he would say, “No; only the one who offers outside is always liable to kareth, as Moses commanded; but today I offer outside by the word of the Lord, in order to refute the prophets of Baal.” And in this way, if all the prophets commanded to act according to the circumstance, it is a commandment to listen to them. And if they said that the matter is uprooted forever, their death would be by strangulation, for the Torah says: “To us and to our children forever” (Deuteronomy 29:28).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Outside of several name-references, they seem unremarkable - I don't see any discussion about the name itself or the family in any of the major commentaries. <strong>NOTE:</strong> The pronunciation of the name in all of these verses is \"D'laya,\" not \"Daliah.\"</p>\n<p>If I can offer a creative alternative: The verse you presented is generally perceived as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.11.1?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Isaiah.11.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Messianic in nature</a>, i.e. referring to the Moshiach, who will restore the Davidic line. Moshiach is referred to as the \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sukkah.52a.6?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">son of David</a>,\" or even as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.37.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">David himself</a>, due to this connection. I propose naming your daughter Davida Malka (דוידה מלכה) to honor this connection directly to this verse. Davida is the feminine form of David, and Malka means \"queen.\" The names together sound very similar to \"David Hamelech\" (דוד המלך), \"David the King\" and would connect your daughter to the idea of being a \"shoot from Jesse.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can a frum, charedi woman wear tzitzit privately? What do major poskim say?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I’m asking this question sincerely, from a place of deep yirat Shamayim and a desire to grow closer to Hashem. This is not coming from a liberal or feminist place — chas v’shalom — but from a heart that wants to get closer to Hashem.</p>\n<p>Lately, I’ve been learning about the mitzvah of tzitzit and all the beautiful things Chazal say about it. I was especially moved by what the Chazon Ish said — that wearing tzitzit is like tying a permanent knot with Hashem — and also by the story of the Gaon of Vilna, who longed to stay in this world just to keep doing mitzvot through tzitzit. All of this made me wish I could have something like that too.</p>\n<p>So I wanted to ask:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What do the gedolim— like the Chafetz Chaim, Chazon Ish, Rav Moshe Feinstein, Rav Elyashiv, Rav Chaim Kanievsky, Rav Ovadia Yosef, Rav Ben Tzion Abba Shaul — say about a woman wearing tzitzit privately?</li>\n<li>If she is allowed to wear tzitzit, would it also be considered a mitzvah — or would it just be seen as another garment for her?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I’m not looking to make a statement or change anything. I just want to understand if this is something a woman can quietly do to deepen her avodat Hashem within the framework of halacha.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A story is being brought (see e.g., <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2012/12/women-wearing-tallit/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) regarding R Soloveitchik when asked this same question. I am not suggesting you are like the person described in the story - but it provides an interesting framework to think of your issue.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>R. Soloveitchik believed he had good reason to doubt that greater\nfulfillment of mitsvot motivated many of these women, as illustrated\nin the following story, related to us by R. Yehuda Kelemer, former\nRabbi of the Young Israel of Brookline, Massachusetts.</p>\n<p>During the mid-1970’s, one of R. Kelemer’s woman congregants at the\nYoung Israel of Brookline was interested in wearing a tallit and\ntsitsit during the prayer services. After R. Kelemer had expressed to\nher his hesitations about the matter, she approached R. Soloveitchik —\nwho lived in Brookline — on the matter. The Rav explained that in\nlight of the novelty of the action, it needed to be adopted gradually.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>Accordingly, he suggested that she first try wearing a talit without\ntsitsit</strong> (which is, of course, allowed for women.) The Rav asked the\nwoman to return to him after three months, at which time they would\ndiscuss the matter further.</strong> When the two met once again, she described\nto R. Soloveitchik the magnificent nature of her religious experience\nin wearing the tallit. The Rav pointed out to the woman that wearing a\ntallit without tsitsit lacked any halakhically authentic element of\nmitsvah. It was obvious, therefore, that what generated her sense of\n“religious high” was not an enhanced kiyyum hamitsvah, but something\nelse.</p>\n<p>Under such circumstances, the Rav maintained, wearing a tallit was an\ninappropriate use of the mitsvah. Consequently, the Rav forbade the\nwoman from wearing a tallit with tsitsit. [Rabbi Aryeh A. Frimer &\nRabbi Dov I. Frimer, “Women’s Prayer Services – Theory and Practice I”\nTradition, 32:2, pp. 5-118 (Winter 1998) at page 41.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Why do we say haAres, but not hagAfen?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>הארץ, the definite form of ארץ, is <em>always</em> pronounced <em>hā'āreṣ</em> (your “haAres”). We don’t say <em>hā'<strong>e</strong>reṣ</em> (your “haEres”), because <strong>the word <em>hā'ereṣ</em> doesn’t exist.</strong></p>\n<p><em>The following is taken from the accepted answer <a href=\"https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/51227/\">here</a>, with the addition of background information:</em></p>\n<p>In Biblical times, the word ארץ was pronounced <em>'arṣ</em>. The definite form, הארץ, was pronounced <em>ha''arṣ</em>.</p>\n<p>Eventually, א was no longer allowed to be geminated (which is why it can’t have a Dagesh Chazzak like most letters can). To preserve the prosody of the word, the vowel of the definite article was lengthened; ergo, <em>hā'arṣ</em>.</p>\n<p>According to most linguists, א was later <em>elided</em> between certain vowels in certain situations, including this one. So at some point, the word was pronounced <em>hārṣ</em> (possibly with an extra-long vowel).</p>\n<p>Eventually, the א was added back in formal readings (by analogy with almost everywhere else in Tanakh, where א <em>is</em> pronounced). The <em>ā</em> vowel was perceived as part of the noun; in other words, people parsed הארץ as <em>hā</em> and <em>'ārṣ</em>, the latter with the long vowel.</p>\n<p>Eventually, <em>hāʔārṣ</em> underwent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segolate\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">segolation</a> and became <em>hāʔār<strong>e</strong>ṣ</em>.

    "content": "# What is the meaning of Bitachon for the masses according to the predominant medieval view that severely limits hashgacha pratis?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Per <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/33779/34188\">this</a>, many—if not most—rishonim subscribe to a theory of hashgacha that is extremely limited, with the average man on the street subject to the vagaries of nature.</p>\n<p>Bitachon nowadays is typically defined as the belief that all that happens to all people is directly orchestrated by HaShem and for the best, even if we can't see it in the moment.</p>\n<p>Such a definition seems to be dependent upon the more popular view of hashgacha nowadays that enlarges the scope of hashgacha to include all people and perhaps even more than that.</p>\n<p>How do the majority of the rishonim understand the concept of Bitachon for the average person—if they indeed subscribe to it at all—in light of their view that hashgacha pratis doesn't extend to the masses?</p>\n<p>Is it reduced to a general belief in ultimate reward and punishment in a different realm of existence despite most people being subject to nature's morally agnostic ways in the here and now?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The amount of source material on this is voluminous, and cannot be quoted in this answer. I'd recommend going through all the sources brought by that answer, and seeing them in full.</p>\n<p>The short answer: The idea of השגחה פרטית is that Hashem deals with human beings on an individual level, as opposed to a general level (השגחה כללית). Whereas with animals, Hashem leaves them to the forces of nature, human beings are dealt with based on their actions. If a person is good, Hashem will reward him, and if he is bad, he will be punished. Such a concept can't exist with regards to animals, as they have no free will, and cannot choose good or bad.</p>\n<p>The closer a person is to God (i.e., the better he is), the better he will be treated by God. The further he is from God (i.e., the worse he is), the worse he will be treated by God. That is all that is meant by השגחה פרטית. We are not subject to the laws of nature, we are subject to the consequences of our actions.</p>\n<p>As such, Bitachon is just as applicable to the common man as it is to the Gadol HaDor. A person is judged by his actions, and God responds accordingly. There is no such thing as \"natural law\" with regards to a human being.</p>\n<p>This point is stressed strongly by that Rambam, Ramban, and Sefer HaChinuch quoted in that answer. Once again, I highly recommend looking at all of those sources in detail.</p>\n<p>I will quote just a few lines from the end of that Ramban, as he stresses this point in the clearest way:</p>\n<p>רמב\"ן שמות פרק יג פסוק טז (פרשת בא)\nשאין לאדם חלק בתורת משה רבינו עד שנאמין בכל דברינו ומקרינו שכלם נסים אין בהם טבע ומנהגו של עולם, בין ברבים בין ביחיד, אלא אם יעשה המצות יצליחנו שכרו, ואם יעבור עליהם יכריתנו ענשו, הכל בגזרת עליון כאשר  הזכרתי כבר.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Translation:</strong> A person has no share in the Torah of Moshe Rabbeinu until he believes that all our affairs and experiences are miracles — that there is no such thing as 'nature' or the ordinary course of the world. This applies both to the collective and to the individual. Rather, if one performs the commandments, his reward will bring him success; and if he transgresses them, his punishment will cut him off — all by the decree of the Most High, as I have already mentioned.</em></p>\n\n\n",

See the links for voice recordings of each one.</p>\n<p><em>Uvular</em> means that the sound is pronounced a bit behind the spot where we pronounce G, K, and “ng” in English. If you know how to pronounce ח and soft כ in Modern Hebrew, you are pronouncing the <em>non</em>-voiced uvular trill. The difference between Tiberian ר and Modern Hebrew ח is just like the difference between B and P, or between V and F. In the first one, your voicebox is activated; but in the second one, you’re exhaling silently. (This is how R is pronounced in French at the beginning of a syllable.)</p>\n<p><em>Alveolar</em> means that the sound is pronounced in the same location as T, D, S, and Z—the spot on the roof of your mouth slightly behind your teeth, using the tip of your tongue. From the guides on YouTube, it seems you have to relax your tongue and breathe out while activating your voice, which causes the tip to vibrate.<br/>\nDon’t become frustrated if you don’t get it right away: For children whose first language contains /r/ (e.g. Italian, Arabic, Spanish), it’s often the very last sound they learn to pronounce. I myself still haven’t figured out how to do it.</p>\n<p>Note that in the Tiberian tradition, /r/ was <em>pharyngealized</em>, meaning you would simultaneously pronounce a subtle ע. This is similar to the Tiberian pronunciation of ט and צ.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The rules for when to use one over the other are, once you memorize them, relatively easy to implement:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>/R/ is used by default.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רֶגֶל /ʀe.ɣel/</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>/r/ is used when preceded by a <em>coronal</em> letter (made with the tip of the tongue).

(Note that a maqaf (־) indicates that two words should be pronounced as one, which can affects the pronunciation of ר, as in the final example above.)</p>\n<p>The ר in these environments only becomes /r/ if the two letters are <strong>not</strong> separated by one of the following types of vowels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A long vowel</li>\n<li>Chataf-Kamatz or Chataf-Segol</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If there’s any such vowel <em>between</em> the ר and the coronal letter, and the second letter does <em>not</em> have a silent Shva, then the ר remains /R/ (e.g. נֵרוֹת, /n<strong>ē.ʀ</strong>ōt̠/, רֹנִי /<strong>ʀō</strong>nī, צֳרִי /ṣ<strong>o.ʀ</strong>ī/)</p>\n<p>The long vowels are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>◌ָ Kamatz Gadol (ɔ̄)</li>\n<li>◌ֵ Tsereh (ē)</li>\n<li>‏◌ִי‏/◌ִֽ Chirik Gadol (ī)</li>\n<li>◌ֹ/וֹ Cholam (ō)</li>\n<li>◌ֻֽ/וּ Shuruk/Kubbutz Gadol (ū)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sometimes, the last syllable of a word contains a long vowel (e.g. הַיָּם, אַהֲרֹן,). Regarding the pronunciation of ר, it is treated as a short vowel, even though it’s technically a long vowel. Thus, דּוֹר is /dō<strong>r</strong>/, not /dō<strong>ʀ</strong>/.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here are some more example words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּרֵאשִׁית /be.ʀē.šīt/\n<br />\nצְרוּרָה /ṣe.rū.ʀā/\n<br />\nאַדִּיר /ʔaddīr/\n<br />\nשָׂר /sār/\n<br />\nשִׁיר /šīʀ/\n<br />\nלָרֹעִים /lā.ʀō.ʕīm/\n<br />\nרְנָנָה /re.nā.nā/\n<br />\nחֲרֹנוֹ /ħa.ʀō.nō/</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>(P.S. סָרַרְנוּ is interesting: The second ר is in direct contact with the following נ, and therefore becomes /r/. Now, /r/ shares with נ and ל the property of being a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonorant\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sonorant</a>, and I believe it might affect <em>other</em> surrounding רs the same way as נ and ל. Just a theory; but if I’m right, this word would have been pronounced /sɔ̄.<strong>r</strong>ar.nū/, not /sɔ̄.<strong>ʀ</strong>ar.nū.)</sub></p>\n\n\n",

And from there we see that mourning for something which isn’t really a tragedy can sometimes be a terrible sin.</p>\n<p>But how far do we take that attitude? Every “tragedy” can truly be reframed into something which is good for us in the long run, e.g. a tikkun, a kapparah, or yissurin shel ahava. And I’m not asking about mourning over a death; that’s a mitza to mourn. I’m asking about other things which we commonly perceive as tragedies like divorce, serious medical issues, etc. Should we try to reframe everything in a positive light and not “mourn” over those things? Or should we follow the current psychology theory that excess positivity (“toxic positivity”) is not always emotionally healthy?</p>\n<p>No matter what the right answer is, my gut feeling is that we shouldn’t compound anyone’s suffering by making them feel guilty for not having more faith.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I\"m not so sure the sin there was mourning a tragedy per se, it seems from the language of the פסוקים that it was a lack of Bitachon.</p>\n<p>במדבר פרק יג פסוק לא (פרשת שלח)\nוְהָ֨אֲנָשִׁ֜ים אֲשֶׁר־עָל֤וּ עִמּוֹ֙ אָֽמְר֔וּ לֹ֥א נוּכַ֖ל לַעֲל֣וֹת אֶל־הָעָ֑ם כִּֽי־חָזָ֥ק ה֖וּא מִמֶּֽנּוּ:</p>\n<p>Numbers 13:31: <em>And the men who went up with him said, 'We are not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than us.</em></p>\n<p>רש\"י שם\nחזק הוא ממנו - כביכול כלפי מעלה אמרו:</p>\n<p>Rashi ad loc.: <em>\"He is stronger than us” – as if to say, they spoke against the One Above (God).</em></p>\n<p>It would seem from this the complaint against them was that they literally believed God couldn't save them, and God's response was that their crying was for nothing (i.e. there was no tragedy).</p>\n<p>We generally do have a concept of mourning, (e.g., Shiva, Tisha B'av) even though we could reframe those things in a positive way in the long run. In fact, in those instances, the Halacha <em>commands</em> us to mourn. It's hard to say that mourning a tragedy would be something that you could be punished for in that light.</p>\n\n\n",

In the wandering clan of the patriarchs, large cattle were already smaller than the small cattle segment.

And later on there: \"the wealthy brought their first fruits in baskets of gold, while the poor used baskets of willow branches\" (Bikurim 3:8). And \"there are three elements in first fruits: the first fruits themselves, the additions to the first fruits, and the decorations of the first fruits...\" (Bikurim 3:10). Thus we see just how much it is proper to add on to the body of the mitzva itself in order to beautify it.

Rebbi Ammi said, it will be sacrificed as a <em>shlamim</em> (peace) offering. Rav said, one uses it to occupy the altar, i.e. <em>olah</em> offering <sup>1</sup>. Rebbi Zeïra asked: Does a private person who was lazy and did not come [with the group] bring a goat with its horns covered in silver<sup>2</sup>?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup> קיץ המזבח is used for elevation offerings, which are brought any time the altar would otherwise be empty. It is difficult to find the meaning in the root קיץ “summer”; it might be from a verb parallel Arabic قصّ, أِّقصّ, “to appear pregnant”.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> This is the interpretation of Maimonides who does not quote the statement in his Code. According to Rashba (Responsa 1, #291) it is a prescriptive sentence: “A private person who was lazy and did not come brings a goat with its horns covered in silver.” This agrees with Z. Frankel’s opinion that in the Yerushalmi, בעי does not necessarily imply a question.</p>\n<p>The answers to 3&4 are brought collectively by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Melekhet_Shelomoh_on_Mishnah_Bikkurim.3.3.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melekhes Shlomo on on the Mishna</a>, who also notes a <em>girsa</em> that a bull would go <em>with them</em> (not before them).</p>\n<p>There is an important <em>limud</em> to questions 3 and 4 brought by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Bikkurim_(Lieberman).2.8?ven=hebrew%7CTosefta_Kifshuta._Third_Augmented_Edition,_JTS_2001&lang=bi&with=Tosefta%20Kifshutah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Kifshutah 2:8:13</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ושלמים</strong>... אבל רב אינו חולק על הברייתא כאן, אלא מפרש את המשנה שהשור שהיה הולך לפניהם שהיה בוודאי משל רבים קרב עולה, אבל כל יחיד היה יכול לקנות בהמה בירושלים ולהקריבה שלמים משום שמחה. *עיין בירושלמי פ\"ב ה\"ג, ס\"ה ע\"א, ובר\"מ פ\"ג מה' בכורים הי\"ב. ובירושלמי להלן שם אמרו: יחיד שנתעצל ולא בא (כלומר, עם הרבים) מביא גדי וקרניו מצופות כסף. ושמא לשיטת רב גם גדי זה קרב עולה. ובמשנתנו (פ\"ב מ\"ד) בסתם: \"וטעונין קרבן\", אבל הקרבן אינו מעכב. *עיין בירושלמי הנ\"ל.</p>\n<p>However, Rav is not arguing on the words of baraisa here, rather he explains the mishna: the bull that walks before them is for sure (an indication) that it is a public offering and brought as an <em>olah</em>. However, an individual can buy an animal in Yerushalaim and offer as <em>shlamim</em> because of <em>simchah</em>. ...Further, a person who was lazy and brought a goat - it is also brought as an <em>olah</em>. Finally, although the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bikkurim.2.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishna</a> teaches that bikkurim require an offering, the offering does not interfere with the mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>A deeper answer to Questions 1 & 2 regarding why the horns were covered with gold and why the bull would walk first is quoted in the name of <em>Chiddushei Aggados</em> Maharsha. It is printed at the end the משניות זכר חנוך, vol. 2 edition, p. 467 on Bikkurim 3:3:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Those who bring ... and a bull would walk before them ... and a crown of olives ...</strong> One intends in doing so to express joy in the mitzvah of <em>bikkurim</em> which is the first of the gifts of the land of Israel with things similar to it. That is the bull is the first of all offerings, as it is mentioned first in the verses Vayikra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.17.3?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17:3</a> or <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.22.27?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22:27</a> <em>... a bull, a sheep, or a goat, ...</em>. A small animal is not as fit as an offering as compared to a bull, as it is hinted in the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.17?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 33:17</a>: <em>like a firstling bull in his majesty</em>. That is the bull is beatitiful for the mitzvah of <em>bikkurim</em>, who is also a first-born, and the head of every offering as brought in various <em>drashos</em>. And it says that its horns are plated with gold, which is a hint that Israel made a Golden Calf which is a kind of bull, as in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.106.19-20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 106:19-20</a> <em>They made a calf at Horeb and bowed down to a molten image. They exchanged their glory for the image of a bull that feeds on grass.</em> The verse intends to say that they did not make a bull with horns, rather they made a calf that gets nursed from its mother, who is only like an image of a grown bull, its kind, that feeds with grass. Thus, this bull with horns is still in purity (not soiled by a sin) and it is going to be the first of all offerings. That is why the horns are covered with gold for this mitzvah, since the horns were not present on the Golden Calf when it was made.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It will be great to find where in the Gemara Maharsha gives this <em>drash</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

And it is possible to interpret “cḥazus hakkol” (“the entire vision”) as not referring to a connected vision (i.e., not as a specific prophetic revelation), but rather that “kol” (“all”) means “everyone.” And the explanation is: the prophecy is addressed to all of you — to both your wise and your fools — just like a sealed book.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Similarly, previously laundered items, whether for clothing or whether for arranging a bed with them, <strong>and even cloths for the hands or the table, are forbidden.</strong> [Nevertheless] Our method of laundry is permitted, but the Gihutz (ironing) (Explanation - We pass over the clothes a smooth stone, to smooth it. Aruch) that we do is not. For linen garments, there is no concept of Gihutz, so this is considered \"our method of laundry,\" and permitted. But these words only apply for ironing it and putting it aside until after Tisha B'Av, but it is forbidden to wear it during that week. And the general custom has become to forbid even linen garments, and even with our method of washing, whether to wear [now] or whether to launder and put aside, and one should not be lenient in this matter since this has become the common practice, and even more so since it it possible that it is also forbidden in law, since there are those who who wrote that our method of laundry is call Gihutz of the people of Bavel that does not whiten very well, for their water is soiled, since it is not a land and mountains and valley like to land of Israel, thus it is possible that the method of laundry in other countries is like the laundry of the land of Israel and is prohibited. Furthermore there are those that explain that 'Gihutz' is water and ash or bicarbonate and soap, and laundry means using water only. In these times we never launder with water only, and we find that all laundry in these times is considered Gihutz, and is forbidden by law even for linen garments for wearing them at any time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rema Note: We [Ashkenazim] are accustomed to to be strict about all of this from the beginning of 'Rosh Chodesh' until after the fast</strong>, if it is not for the need of a Mitzvah, like a woman [at a time in her cycle] where she wears whites, and to arrange [the sheets] under her {to sleep on} (Rokach and the Ohr Zaruah), but on Tisha be-Av itself, she should not wear whites, ratehr she should wear a garment which is clean and nice (notes of the Sha-a-rei Doorah). Similarly for the honour of we wear linen garments and we arrange white [cloths] like on other Shabbatot.

Regarding the title <em>Yad HaChazakah</em>, he notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This title seems to have become common in the sixteenth century. In the Venice (Justiniani) ed., 1550, the Code is termed משנה תורה היא ספר היד, and in the Venice 1574 ed., משנה תורה היא ספר היד החזקה, occurs for the\nfirst time. In the Constantinople ed., 1509, the last verse of the Pentateuch ולכל היד החזקה ולכל המורא הגדול אשר עשה משה לעיני כל ישראל decorates\nthe title page in the form of a square. The northern and most conspicuous side of the square contains the words ולכל היד החזקה. <strong>Already\nJoseph ben Todros Halevi, a thirteenth century Spanish scholar, applied\nthis verse to Maimonides when extolling his Code</strong> (קבוצת מכתבים, ed.\nHalberstam, Bamberg, 1875, p. 7). He terms Maimonides the greatest\nscholar since the time of Rabina and R. Ashi. On the title page of the\nVenice ed., 1524, is found the well-known saying op ממשה ועד משה לא קם כמשה. According to Prof. Ginzberg, Joseph Caro refers to the Code as\nהיד הגדולה. The phrase יד החזקה, excerpted from the verse applied to\nMaimonides, became a rival name for the Code it seems, because of\nits conspicuous display on the title page of some early editions, and the\nallusion to the fourteen books in the word יד.</p>\n<p>....Jesse b. Hezekiah (Exilarch of Damascus) refers to the Mishneh\nTorah as the <em>Yad ha-Hazakah</em>, היד החזקה אשר קראו משנה תורה, in a\nletter which he wrote at the end of the thirteenth century,\nexcommunicating all those who are in possession of writings\nantagonistic to Maimonides.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Several reasons given by the medieval authorities show why a religion that believes in revelation must also believe that Hashem rewards and punishes human actions.</p>\n<p>Torah itself links behaviour to consequence</p>\n<p>Reward–punishment expresses divine justice and providence</p>\n<p>Without reward and punishment there is no meaningful free will</p>\n<p>Reward and punishment as a natural outgrowth of the deed</p>\n<p>Belief in reward and punishment is treated as an essential principle not because Judaism wants people to act only for ulterior motives but because it reflects the Torah’s view of a just, providential Hashem. The Tanach repeatedly links obedience to consequences, and medieval philosophers such as Rambam and Albo saw recompense as a necessary corollary of Hashem’s knowledge and revelation. While the Mishnah exhorts us to serve Hashem without making reward our motive, it does not deny that reward and punishment exist; rather, it urges us to internalise the intrinsic value of mitzvot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>To understand why reward and punishment are fundamental to Judaism, we should consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lawrence Cohlberg's stages of moral development</a>.</p>\n<p>As we observe, reward and punishment are fundamental moral principles that underpin how any society operates. This serves as the foundational level of any educational system, typically linked to preschool, and it represents the lowest common moral denominator among all intelligent members of society.</p>\n<p>Since the Torah, as the foundational text in Judaism, conveys a moral message that even children can easily understand (as in Lev 26.3 \"<em>If you follow My laws and faithfully observe My commandments...</em>\"), we can conclude that it communicates on this level. In fact, throughout the book, God threatens to severely punish wrongdoers and promises incredible rewards for obedience, as it states (Ex 20.5),</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<em>For I YHWH, your God, am an impassioned God, visiting the guilt of the parents upon the children, upon the third and upon the fourth generations of those who reject Me, but showing kindness to the thousandth generation of those who love Me and keep My commandments.</em>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Jewish moral thought, this level is called \"Fear\" (יראה). However, <strong>this is not the only level of Biblical morality</strong>, but it is undoubtedly the most prominent one and the one everyone agrees on.</p>\n<p>Note, <strong>\"higher\" levels of understanding divine morality, that can be found in the books of the Prophets and later Rabbinic thought, do NOT nullify Pre-Conventional morality but merely build on it</strong>. Rabbis who attained the \"highest\" levels of Post-Conventional morality (aka \"Fear out of Love\" - \"יראה מאהבה\", acc. to <em>the Lureanic tradition</em>) would agree that reward and punishment exist as fundamental ways of God's providence, it is just that they are not motivated by them.</p>\n<p>The Mishna you quoted, \"<em>Do not be like servants who serve the master in the expectation of receiving a reward, but be like servants who serve the master without the expectation of receiving a reward</em>\" (Avos 1:3), is a good example of Post-Conventional morality one is <em>prescribed</em> to achieve. But which, nevertheless, is not attainable by a significant portion of the population - children and dull/feebleminded individuals.</p>\n<p>As such, you are completely right, assuming that subscription to Pre-Conventional moral principles would be inapplicable to individuals who deeply associate with Post-Conventional ideals.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/C8FlCSrk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/C8FlCSrk.png\" alt=\"Lawrence Cohlberg's stages of moral development\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

He begins by citing a Midrash Rabbah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.47.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shemos Rabbah 47:6)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda bar Naḥman says in the name of Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish: While he was writing with a quill, a bit [of ink] remained. He passed [the quill] over his head and from it the rays of splendor were formed for him, as it is stated: “Moses did not know that the skin of his face was radiant [upon His speaking with him].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Bloch seems to explain that every mitzvah in the Torah contains lessons for how to live life, and there are many situations beyond the actual setting of that mitzvah where those lessons can be applied.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The more a person has absorbed the message of the mitzvah into his being, the more he will be able to aplly the Torah's lessons to life's various situations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I tried looking for the original text from Rav Bloch, but could not find this exact text. Does anyone know what he exactly says and where? Also, what does the \"leftover ink\" has to do with this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Chomer V’Tzurah Rav Bloch reads these Midrashic images as symbols for the two components of every area of Torah and mitzvah – the material (chomer) and the form (tzurah):\n<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_39046_11.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_39046_11.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Transmitted vs. inexpressible Torah: Rav Bloch stresses that when a sage teaches, he can only express the “material” of the wisdom. The “form” – the inner soul of the idea – cannot be conveyed fully in words. Because of his desire to share it, the wisdom “bursts forth through his entire being” and is conveyed through his facial expressions and movements. Only a student who remains close to his teacher, hears his words and “sees his face,” can absorb this spiritual dimension. This is why the students of R. Meir said they attained the Torah not from the explanations themselves but from seeing his appearance or even his finger.\n<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_39046_10.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_39046_10.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Three parts of Torah: Rav Bloch applies this distinction to the Midrash. He explains that the Torah has three “parts”: one was in Moshe’s hand – the revealed Torah that can be grasped rationally; a second was in God’s hand – the ultimate secrets that no person can grasp; the middle portion, represented by the two handbreadths in the middle of the tablets, lies between man and God. Human beings cannot fully comprehend it, but Moshe was allowed to “glimpse its radiance”.</p>\n<p>Leftover ink and the “form” of Torah: According to Rav Bloch, the second Midrashic opinion (“leftover ink”) teaches that Moshe’s radiance did not come from secrets beyond human reach. Instead it came from “that little bit” of the Torah that remained on his quill after he had written down and transmitted all the teachings. Even after he exhausted himself to teach and clarify the Torah, a “form of the wisdom” remained in his heart that no language could express. He “passed it over his head,” meaning he internalised it, and that inner, unarticulated essence burst forth through his face as a radiant light. Hence the Midrash’s phrase “from it the rays were formed” – the light came naturally from his intense desire to convey the Torah’s inner meaning.\n<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_39046_12.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_39046_12.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n",

What did she say? It's not there in the text.</p>\n<p>I would have expected a lacuna like this to attract midrashim, but there's hardly anything in Bereishis Rabbah - only a suggestion that \"קול\" implies weeping; that in fact there were no actual words. That midrash does explain the posuk, but it doesn't seem to be acknowledged by the major commentators, which makes me wonder if I'm missing something.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Gra in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.3.17?lang=he&with=Aderet%20Eliyahu&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aderes Eliyahu</a> on this pasuk says, quite simply, that she told him it was good:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמעת בקול אשתך שאמרה כי טוב הוא בלי טעם האמנת לה יותר ממני לעבור על מצותי והוא מפני שכרוך אתה אחריה בעבור רוב העונג ולא תחסר לך כל</p>\n<p>...You listened to the voice of your wife who said that it was good without any reason because you believed her more than to ignore my commandments, and that's because you're bound up with her because of the abundance of pleasure [you have] and you're lacking nothing...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That doesn't clarify <em>what</em> was good - whether it tasted good, was healthy, or was spiritually or otherwise physically advantageous to eat - but regardless, her comments to Adam were that \"it's good\" and Adam apparently didn't seek to clarify further and on the basis of those comments he ate.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.3.17?lang=he&with=Alshich&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Alshich</a>, on the other hand, says even simpler - she outright told him to eat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמעת לה באומרה לך שתאכל וז\"א כי שמעת לקול אשתך ותאכל על פיה במקום אשר צויתיך לאמר לה לא תאכל ממנו</p>\n<p>...You listened to her when she told you to eat and that's what the pasuk means \"for you listened to the voice of your wife and you ate 'on her mouth' in the place of my commanding you saying to her <em>don't eat from this</em>...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Parenthetically, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.3.17?lang=he&with=Haamek%20Davar&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ha'emek Davar</a> cites this as a reason why Adam didn't die immediately.)</p>\n<p>The Chida in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.3.17?lang=he&with=Chomat%20Anakh&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chomas Anach</a>, however, goes in a completely different direction, interpreting this pasuk <em>not</em> as Chavah having said something in particular but rather as being Adam's fault for not clarifying to Chavah what exactly the parameters of the prohibition were, versus the gedarim he himself added:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אפשר במה שכתבו הרב תורת חיים והרב כלי יקר ז״ל דאדה״ר הזהיר לחוה על הנגיעה לגדר וכך ראוי לעשות גדר ומשמרת למצות ה׳. אך היה לאדה״ר לומר לחוה דהמצוה היא האכילה וצריך לעשות גדר שלא לנגוע. אך אדה״ר אמר סתם דאכילה ונגיעה אסור ובחדא מחתא מחתינהו. וחוה סברה דגם נגיעה היא מצות ה׳ וזה גרם דדחפה הנחש ומזה באה לטעות. ונמצא דאדה״ר הוא היא גרמא דלא פירש הצווי שהוא האכילה לבד ומשום גדר צריך להתרחק מנגיעה. וזהו התוכחה כי שמעת וכו׳ אשר צויתיך לאמר לחוה לא תאכל ממנו ואתה אסרת הנגיעה בסתם וסברה דהנגיעה גם כן ציווי ועי״ז טעתה ואכלה והאכילתו ונמשך זה דלא ביררת הציווי והגדר.</p>\n<p>It's possible that which the Toras Chaim and Kli Yakar wrote - that Adam Harishon warned Chavah about touching, as a safeguard - and it was appropriate to create a safeguard around the mitzvos of Hashem. But Adam was supposed to tell Chavah that the mitzvah was eating and he needed to make a safeguard of not touching. Instead, Adam said outright that eating <em>and</em> touching were prohibited and lumped them together. And Chavah understood that touching was also the commandment of Hashem and this caused [the situation] that when the snake pushed her and she came to make a mistake. And so we find that Adam is the cause for why she didn't clarify that the commandment was eating itself and that physical distancing was just a safeguard. And that's the rebuke he received that \"You listened to your wife... that I commanded you\" to say to Chavah not to eat, but you prohibited touching on its own and  she thought that touching was a commandment and therefore erred and ate and fed him and this was because you didn't clarify the commandment and the safeguard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>She did more than just weep, refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Bereshit_Rabbah.20.8&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 20:8</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּלְאָדָם אָמַר כִּי שָׁמַעְתָּ לְקוֹל אִשְׁתֶּךָ (בראשית ג, יז), רַבִּי שִׂמְלָאי אוֹמֵר <strong>בְּיִשּׁוּב הַדַּעַת בָּאת עָלָיו, אָמְרָה לוֹ, מָה אַתְּ סָבוּר שֶׁאֲנִי מֵתָה וְחַוָּה אַחֶרֶת נִבְרֵאת לָךְ (קהלת א, ט): אֵין כָּל חָדָשׁ תַּחַת הַשָּׁמֶשׁ, מָה אַתְּ סָבוּר שֶׁאֲנִי מֵתָה וְאַתָּה יוֹשֵׁב לְךָ הָטֵלִיס (ישעיה מה, יח):</strong> לֹא תֹהוּ בְרָאָהּ לָשֶׁבֶת יְצָרָהּ. רַבָּנָן אָמְרִין הִתְחִילָה מְיַלֶּלֶת עָלָיו בְּקוֹלָהּ הֲדָא הוּא דִכְתִיב: וּלְאָדָם אָמַר כִּי שָׁמַעְתָּ לְדִבְרֵי אִשְׁתֶּךָ, אֵין כְּתִיב כָּאן, אֶלָּא לְקוֹל אִשְׁתֶּךָ וגו'.</p>\n<p>“And to Adam He said: Because you heeded your wife’s voice, and ate from the tree that I commanded you, saying: You shall not eat from it, the ground is cursed on your account; in suffering you shall eat of it all the days of your life” (Genesis 3:17).\n“And to Adam He said: Because you heeded your wife’s voice” – Rabbi Simlai said: <strong>She approached him persuasively. She said to him: ‘What do you think, that I will die and another Eve will be created for you? “There is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). What do you think, that I will die and you will sit alone? “He did not create it for emptiness; He formed it to be inhabited”’ (Isaiah 45:18).</strong> The Rabbis say: She began sobbing at him with her voice. That is what is written: “And to Adam He said...” “Because you heeded your wife’s words” is not written here, but rather, “your wife’s voice.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This includes two situations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The letter is <strong>after a consonant</strong>. For example, מִדְ<strong>בָּ</strong>ר where the ב is preceded by ד, and עַל־<strong>פְּ</strong>נֵי where the פ is preceded by ל.</li>\n<li>The letter is <strong>at the beginning of a word</strong>, and the previous word ends in a vowel, but is also at a grammatical pause (indicated by disjunctive trope). This grammatical pause separates the vowel from the start of the next word, so if the next word starts in a בגדכפ״ת letter, it takes a <em>dagesh qal</em>. For example, אֶת־אָזְנוֹ <strong>בַּ</strong>מַּרְצֵעַ, where the בּ follows a Cholam, but the phrase את אזנו <em>ends</em> the previous phrase (as indicated by the פשטא trope on אזנו).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Ten verses¹ have a word starting with a בגדכפ״ת letter that takes a <em>dagesh qal</em>, even though it should apparently be <em>rafe</em>. They are listed several Masoretic works. They cannot be predicted, and must simply be memorized.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>A <em>dagesh ħazaq</em>, on the other hand, indicates gemination. There are several types of Gemination in Chumash Hebrew:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Semantic. Some words and affixes are geminated inherently, where affects their meaning. This gemination has the same function as letters and vowels, and is just as important.</li>\n<li>Inflectional. Some grammatical inflections, like <em>pi‘el</em>, involve gemination.</li>\n<li>De-ambiguative. A letter of a certain word can sometimes be geminated in order to differentiate it from a <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homophone\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">homophone</a>.</li>\n<li>Fortative. A letter can be geminated to preserve it, since it’s prone to being <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elision\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elided</a>.</li>\n<li>Compensatory. When a long is shortened due to historical sound changes, the following consonant might be geminated to preserve the word’s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/prosody\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">prosody</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>3 and 4 didn’t develop naturally; they were added by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masoretes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Masoretes</a> reading hyper-deliberately, with extra emphasis on parts that were ambiguous or prone to elision. Therefore, they are not prone to Hebrew <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/phonotactics\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">phonotactics</a>, and there’s no way to predict them with certainty. Still, you can tell that they’re a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em>, because they aren’t in the [list of exceptional <em>dageshīm qalīm</em>] (mentioned above).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, 1, 2, and 5 <em>did</em> develop naturally, and therefore must obey Hebrew phonotactics, which dictate that gemination can only occur on letters <em>between vowels</em>. This means it can’t occur <strong>after a consonant</strong>, and it can’t occur <strong>at the beginning of a clause</strong>.</p>\n<p>There’s a reason why I just wrote “clause” instead of “word”: There is a category of cases, called דְּחִיק and אֲתֵי מֵרֲחִיק, where a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em> can come at the beginning of a word. Basically, under complex conditions, a word that ends in a vowel can cause a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em> in the first letter of the following word, which is otherwise impossible.</p>\n<p>However, this can only occur when the first word is grammatically <em>connected</em> to the next word, with a <em>conjunctive</em> trope. This conjunction connects the vowel to the first letter of the next word, thereby causing that letter to be <em>between two vowels</em>. This makes a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em> possible.</p>\n<p>So be sure to remember about דְּחִיק when dealing with a word-initial Dagesh.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This gives us a convenient rule: <strong>If the letter with dagesh is between two vowels, it’s a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em>. If it’s <em>not</em> between two vowels, it’s a <em>dagesh qal</em>.</strong></p>\n<p>So, using your example, the ב in שַׁבָּת is between two vowels—a preceding Patach a following Kamatz. Therefore, it <em>must</em> be a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em>, and <em>can’t possibly</em> be a <em>dagesh qal</em>.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the Dagesh in בְּרֵאשִׁית comes at the beginning of a word (and isn’t subject to conditions that cause דְּחִיק). Therefore, it <em>must</em> be a <em>dagesh qal</em>, and <em>can’t possibly</em> be a <em>dagesh ħazaq</em>.</p>\n<p>Remember about Fortative and De-Ambiguative <em>dagesh ħazaq</em>, and memorize the short list of words with an exceptional <em>dagesh qal</em>.

    "title": "Usage of non-Jewish segulot (charms)",
    "content": "# Usage of non-Jewish segulot (charms)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>For a side research project I've recently started going through manuscript collections of segulot and amulets (קמעות in Hebrew). I've been struck by many surprising and fascinating details in the various types of segulot (little understanding as I have of the deeper spiritual intricacies behind each detail). One particularly eye-catching detail is the obvious usage in some cases of non-Hebraic or non-Aramaic words. Sometimes they have undergone some form of semiticization, as in writing them in Hebrew characters. But there have been some cases - albeit more rarely - whereby actual Latin characters were used in passages. Perhaps the most shocking example that I came across earlier this week was the following, from the 17th century MS Kaufmann A 247, <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/discover/manuscripts/hebrew-manuscripts/viewerpage?vid=MANUSCRIPTS#d=%5B%5BPNX_MANUSCRIPTS990001914150205171-1,FL38319243%5D%5D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 76</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"beronix לעצור הדם כתוב במצחו השם הכתוב למטה אם הוא איש בירוניס ולנצרים<br />\nberonisa ואם היא אשה כתוב בירוניסה ולנצרים\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A quick search online revealed that the word \"beronix\" was in fact used in certain types of European Christian charms (the non-Jewish equivalent of segulot) for staunching blood (see e.g. <a href=\"https://magicalmedieval.wordpress.com/tag/beronix/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-EE-00001-00015/1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>What's unusual about this case - unlike (perhaps?) most other cases of usages of non-Hebrew words - is that the author seems to have some awareness that he is describing a segulah of non-Jewish origins, by using a clearly non-Hebrew word (the Latin characters are right there in the manuscript) and prescribing the segulah to both Jews and non-Jews.</p>\n<p>I should mention that - though I don't know who the scribe is<sup>1</sup> - where he could, he did explicitly cite his sources - some segulot were copied from other manuscripts or books (\"ספר קדמון אחר\", \"ספר כנפי יונה חלק שני\", etc), and many were attributed to a great number of rabbis, including Ramban, Rabbi Yosef Gikatilla, Rabbi Menachem Chazan of Londres (London), the Ari, Rabbi Yehudah Ha'Chassid, and many others. This one was not attributed to anyone. Perhaps this scribe was not a great talmid chacham and simply copied what came into his possession, but there's no real way to know (the few personal details he mentions have to do with his interactions with other Jews from around the world who informed him of tried-and-tested segulot which he was happy to pass on).</p>\n<p>This brings me to my question: Is there any problem with using segulot of non-Jewish origins that don't seem to have any explicit problematic content, such as Christian figures and the like? Or to put it another way, if we assume that the scribe was not a total ignoramus in terms of halacha, what might have possessed him to feel comfortable with sharing this segulah? Or perhaps this is a wrong assumption, and what the scribe did was indeed problematic?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> On p. 181 appears simply the name משה דאנאטא בן חנה. This may be the scribe's name, or it may be the name of a previous owner of the manuscript. Or it may have been another person's name written there for other purposes.</p>\n\n\n",

They fast more, take vows, observe kashrut and Shabbat more stringently than necessary, dress more modestly than required, etc.  (You may have seen the <a href=\"https://web.stevens.edu/golem/llevine/chumra/chumra_of_the_week.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chumrah of the Week Club</a> joke.)

We start with the words of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Yitro.13.241?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Yisro 13:241</a>, <em>parashas</em> Yisro on the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 19:1</a> \"On the third new month\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yaakov took for himself a period of 2 months - Nisan and Iyar. And it includes the portion of Sivan which has the Zodiacal sign of <em>Twins</em>, meaning that it was intended for both brothers. Eisav took for himself two months Tamuz and Av, and it was not forgotten. However, since Eisav abandoned the way of mitzvos, Elul does not belong to him. Even in Av, Eisav has only nine days and not more. And since Eisav abandoned the way of mitzvos, it was not forgotten, so that the month of Sivan, the portion of \"Twins\" is not his. He separated himself and turned towards impurity, in chaos and desolation, as it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.9.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 9:7</a>: \"The enemy is no more — ruins everlasting; You have torn down their cities; their very names are lost.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>הגם שדברי הזוהר המה ודאי רזין, מכל מקום צריכין להבין אותם גם על פי פשוטה שהיה חלוקה בין יעקב לעשו במנין החדשים. אך קשה, דלמה אתאביד אלול מן עשו אם היה ראוי לחלקו, מאחר שיעקב נטל ג' חדשים ניסן אייר סיון? גם מה נעשה בששה חדשים הנותרים? למי הם שייכים?</p>\n<p>Albeit, the words of Zohar are surely cryptic, nevertheless we must understand them according to simple meaning that there was a division in the months count between Yaakov and Eisav. This is hard to understand! Perhaps Elul was abandoned by Eisav even if it is fitting for his portion, once Yaakov took three months Nissan, Iyar, and Sivan? What about the six remaining months? To whom do these months belong?</p>\n<p>לכן נלע\"ד להבין הכל על נכון בהקדים מה שנתנו הקדמונים סימן בענין הפטרות שאמרו מי\"ז בתמוז ואילך מפטירין ג' דפורענותא ושבעה דנחמתא ותרתי דתיובתא. מאי בעו בזה הסימן? ובזוהר פרשת שמות (ח\"ב יב, א) איתא בפסוק \"ותצפנהו שלשה ירחים\" \"אילין תלת ירחין דדינא קשיא שריא בעלמא ומאי ניהו תמוז אב טבת וכו'\". ויבואר הכל בחדא מחתא, דכבר כתבתנו במסכת ראש השנה אליבא דר' יהושע דאמר בניסן נברא העולם, והכי סתם לן תנא דמתניתין בכמה דוכתי כאשר כתבתי שם, היינו בריאת אדם הראשון היה ביום ו' שהוא ראש חדש ניסן, אבל תחלת הבריאה היה בכ\"ה באדר. וכבר ידוע שיעקב קנה הבכורה מעשו והקב\"ה הסכים על המכירה וקרא לו \"בני בכורי ישראל\". ונמצא בחלוקת החדשים היה מגיע ליעקב שני חלקים, ונטל יעקב ארבעה חדשים ראשונים, דהיינו: אדר – שהוא תחלת בריאת עולם, ניסן, אייר, סיון. ואחר כך לקח עשו בחלקו תרין ירחין אילן תמוז אב. ולכך היה כח לס\"א ס\"מ שר של עשו בתרין ירחין אילין בעונותינו להחריב בית מקדשינו ושארי דברים שאירעו לנו בתרין ירחין אילין.</p>\n<p>Thus, in my humble opinion, to understand it all, it is good to start with the signature that preceding generations made with the choices of the Haftora from the 17th of Tamuz (till the end of the year). We read three <em>haftoras</em> of calamities and seven <em>haftoras</em> of consolation, and two <em>haftoras</em> of repentance. Why do we need this signature? In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Shemot.18.193?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Shemos 18:193</a> on the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.2.2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 2:2</a> \"...she hid him for three months\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the three months in which the world is under the aegis of stern Justice, namely Tammuz, Av, and Tevet. Etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it all comes together (literally in one coal-pan). We already wrote in masekhta <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.11a.2?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 11a</a>, where R' Yehoshua says: \"In Nisan the world was created\" and so for us the mishna teaches in several places, as I wrote there, that Adam haRishon was created on the sixth day, which was Rosh Chodesh Nisan. However, the beginning of Creation was on the 25th of Adar. And so it is known that Yaakov acquired the <em>bekhora</em> (the first-born priviledge) from Eisav and HKBH approved the sale and called <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.4.22?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 4:22</a> \"... Israel is My First-born!\" So we find in the division of the months, Yaakov takes two portions. Thus Yaakov took first four months: Adar, which was beginning of Creation of the World; Nisan; Iyar; and Sivan. Afterwads, Eisav took in his portion two months - that is Tamuz and Av. Therefore, the power of <em>Sitra Achara</em> (impurity) \"the time of duty\" (<em>seder moed</em>) for the angel of Eisav is in these two months. Due to our sins it brought us to the destruction of our Temple and other things that we experienced in these two months.</p>\n<p>ואחר כך המה שני חדשים אלול תשרי שהמה ימי התשובה ועוסקים בכמה מצות ובודאי אילו עשו ישראל תשובה גמורה היה נתבטל כחו של עשו עם שר שלו למעלה לגמרי. אך בעו\"ה אין עושים תשובה גמורה. ועל כל פנים מועיל התשובה ומעשים טובים שעושים בשני חדשים אלו שלא יקח עשו חלק כנגדם. ואחר כך לקח יעקב ב' חדשים חשון כסליו לחלקו. ועשו לקח טבת לחלקו. לכן גם בחדש זה היה כח לס\"א שבו צום העשירי, וכמבואר בזוהר הנ\"ל פרשת שמות.</p>\n<p>And afterwards there are two months Elul and Tishrei, which are days of repentance and we are busy with many mitzvos. For sure, if Jewish people made complete repentance, then the power of Eisav and that of his Angel would be completely nullified. Albeit, in this world we cannot repent completely. And in any case, repentance and good deeds done in these two months are beneficial, so that Eisav does not take a portion in them. Afterwards, Yaakov took two months Cheshvan and Kislev for his portion. And Esau took Tevet for his portion. Therefore, in this month too, there is power for the  <em>Sitra Achara</em> (impurity), so that we fast on the tenth of Tevet, as explained in the aforementioned <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Shemot.18.193?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Shemos 18:193</a>.</p>\n<p>נשאר חודש שבט. מזה מגיע ב' חלקים ליעקב, והואיל שרובו בקדושה נדחה ממנו עשו לגמרי ולא נשאר לו מכל י\"ב ירחים רק ג' והיינו תמוז אב טבת. ‏(כן הוא הגירסא נכונה בזוהר, ולא כמו שהעמידו בגליון \"נ\"א שבט\", דליתא. הגם ידעתי שבזוהר איכא איתא \"טבת ושבט אינון ימי הרעה\" ועיין שם. היינו דסבירא ליה שם דעשו נטיל חלק שליש.)</p>\n<p>The month of Shvat remains. Yaakov took 2 portions in it. Because majority of the month has holiness, Eisav is pushed out of it completely. Thus, from the whole 12 months, only 3 months remain for him, and they are Tamuz, Av, and Tevet. (That is a correct wording in the Zohar and not like \"other wording: Shvat\", which is not correct. I also know that it is written in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar_Chadash%2C_Midrash_HaNe%27elam_Al_Eichah.83?ven=hebrew%7CZohar_Chadash&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Chadash, Midrash haNe'elam al Eikhah 83</a> \"Tevet and Shvat - these are days of evil\" and look there. Meaning, that Eisav took also a third portion.)</p>\n<p>מכל י\"ב ירחים נמצא דיעקב נטיל שמנה חדשים לחלקו וכפי הסדר שכתבתי שמתחיל מן אדר; לקח יעקב ד' חדשים, ואחר כך עשו ב' חדשים, עוד לקח יעקב ד' חדשים ועשו ב' חדשים. אבל לפי סברת הזוהר בפרשת שמות שכתב תלת ירחין דדינא קשיא שדיא בעלמא ודאי המה תמוז אב טבת כמו שמבואר בפני' ולא כמו שכתבו נ\"א בגליון ומטעם שכתבתי דמחודש אלול ותשרי נדחה עשו לגמרי.</p>\n<p>From all twelve months we find that Yaakov took eight months for his portion. According to the order that I described, that he started from Adar and took 4 months. Afterwards, Eisav took 2 months. Then Yaakov took 4 months and Eisav took 2 months. However, according to the opinion of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Shemot.18.193?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Shemos 18:193</a>, who wrote about three months of judgement - a hard difficulty (<em>kush'ya shad'ya</em>) in general - for sure they are Tamuz, Av, and Tevet, as we described before, and not according to the other wording in the \"gilyon*, for the reason that from the months of ELul and Tishrei Eisav is pushed out completely.</p>\n<p>וזה שרמזו הקדמונים בסימן הפטרות: ג' דפורענותא ושבע דנחמתא ותרתי דתיובתא. היינו כנגד י\"ב חדשי השנה. והמשכיל יבין מאליו.</p>\n<p>This is what was hinted in the signature of the Haftoras: three of calamities, seven of consolation, and two of repentance - that is in parallel to the twelve months of the year. An intelligent mind will understand from this.</p>\n<p>ולכך אירע לנו באותן ג' חדשים, תמוז אב טבת, מה שאירע. והמה צום הרביעי וצום החמישי וצום העשירי. וה' ברחמיו יעשה למען שמו להפוך אותם לששון ושמחה במהרה בימינו אמן. ועיין עוד מה שאכתוב בסמוך.</p>\n<p>So whatever occured for us in those three months, Tamuz, Av, and Tevet, - occured. And they are the fast of the fourth month (Tamuz), and the fast of the fifth month (Av), and the fast of the tenth month (Tevet). And Hashem in his mercy will act for His name to turn them to happiness and joy soon in our days. Amein. (And look what is written <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maaseh_Rokeach_on_Mishnah%2C_Seder_Moed%2C_Taanit.32?ven=hebrew%7CMaaseh_Rokeach,_Amsterdam_1740&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">next to it</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>\n<p>Zohar presents two opinions regarding division of months.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first opinion, based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar_Chadash%2C_Midrash_HaNe%27elam_Al_Eichah.83?ven=hebrew%7CZohar_Chadash&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Chadash, Midrash haNe'elam al Eikhah 83</a> implies that Tamuz, Av, Tevet, and Shvat are the months of judgement, which were taken by Eisav. The remaining eight months: Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Elul, Tishrei, Cheshvan, and Adar are moths of mercy and were taken by Yaakov, who as a first-born gets a double portion.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There is a considerable difficulty with understanding the opinion in Zohar proper, since <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Yitro.13.241?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Yisro 13:241</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Shemot.18.193?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar Shemos 18:193</a> imply that only three months are the months of judgement, namely Tamuz, Av, and Tevet, which are taken by Eisav. According to this opinion, the months Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Cheshvan, Kislev, and Adar are the months of mercy taken by Yaakov. The months of Elul and Tishrei are filled with repentance and mitzvos, so Eisav does not have any portion in them. It is possible to resolve the month of Shvat: since Yaakov as firstborn takes two portions in it, majority, Eisav cannot touch it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The last opinion has its parallel in the established count of haftoras that we read from 17th of Tamuz until the end of the year. The three haftoras of calamities parallel the months Tamuz, Av, and Tevet. The seven haftoras of consolation parallel the months Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Cheshvan, Kislev, Shvat, and Adar. The two haftoras of repentance parallel the months Elul and Tishrei. In other words, the last 12 weeks of the year carry the signature of the entire year according to his commentary.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Geshmak!</p>\n\n\n",

Hashem decreed that they should succeed in wronging you.</p>\n<p>In other words, you can and should blame a wrongdoer for <em>acting badly</em>. But you should not blame them for acting badly <em>to you</em>. The former was their own choice; the latter was Hashem’s.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This has always helped me answer this sort of question.</p>\n<p>Who does the book of Job say was responsible for the death of Job’s servants and the theft of his camels?</p>\n<p>A.

And this commandment includes the impurity of a carcass and all of its laws.</p>\n<p>And I will now present a preface that is appropriate that we remember anytime we mention the various types of impurity. And it is that that which we count each type as a positive commandment - its content is not that we are obligated to become impure with a certain impurity, and also not that we are prohibited from becoming impure from it and that it be a negative commandment.</p>\n<p>Rather the Torah said that anyone who touches this type [of object] becomes impure; or that this thing renders one who touches it impure according to this description. And that is the positive commandment - meaning that this law with which we have been commanded is a positive commandment. And that is His saying, whoever touches this according to this description has become impure; and whoever according to that description does not become impure. But the matter itself is optional - if he wants, he becomes impure; if not, he doesn't become impure.</p>\n<p>And the language of the Sifra (Sifra, Shemini, Chapter 4:10) is, \"'And their carcass do not touch' (Leviticus 11:8) - I might think that if one touched a carcass, he receives lashes. [Hence] we learn to say, 'and to these you shall become impure' (Leviticus 11:24). I might [then] think that if one saw a carcass, he should go and become impure from it. [Hence] we learn to say, 'and their carcass do not touch.' How is this? You shall say, it is an option.\"</p>\n<p>And this commandment that has been told to us about this law - that one who touches this become impure; and that he will be impure, such that he will be obligated about everything that impure people are obligated, [such as] to exit from the camp of the Divine Presence, not to eat consecrated food, not to touch it and other things besides this - this is the command. That means to say, one becoming impure from this type when he touches it or was proximate to [it] in such a manner.</p>\n<p>And remember this matter with every one of the types of impurity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to directly answer your questions based on the above Rambam:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What does it mean for those to be a Mitzva?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The</em> mitzvah <em>is for one who comes into contact with a source of impurity to act in accordance with the relevant rules.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Who/what is commanded to perform those Mitzvahs?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>The person who comes into contact with a source of impurity, and possibly anyone else for whom his impurity has an effect.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does \"dead body being impure\" fulfill a Positive Mitzvah?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>It doesn't. The</em> mitzvah <em>is for the one who came into contact with the dead body to follow the rules.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Should one strive to fulfill those mitzvahs by making more dead insects, niddas, or corpses?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>No</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why are there so many of them? Why can't \"being impure\" be one Mitzvah with all those being details (as opposed to \"Love thy neighbor)?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>This is admittedly not directly answered by the piece I quoted, but my sense from Rambam is that since each form of impurity has a different set of rules, it makes sense that each one forms its own</em> mitzvah. <em>(Maybe we can draw an analogy to the separate</em> mitzvot <em>of not doing</em> melachah <em>on</em> shabbat, yom kippur, chag, shemittah, yovel <em>- even thought conceptually you could have one overarching umbrella prohibition of</em> melachah <em>on holy occasions, they are split up into separate prohibitions.)</em></p>\n\n\n",

Even the concept of separation didn't exist yet.  The problem here is that if God had a desire to create, then it must be that the concepts of desire and non-desire already existed, which isn't possible in a perfect unity.</p>\n<p>If God's desire to create was all that there was and there was not even the concept of not desiring, then because God desires, and therefore lacks, how can we say that God is perfect?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You are thinking of desire from a human lens. We desire things external to ourselves - we see something and then we want it. The objects of our desire \"sell themselves\" to us, and we are aroused and want them. This type of desire implies a lack.</p>\n<p>Hashem doesn't desire in this way. His desire comes from His ultimate \"<em>bechira chafshis</em>\", free choice, from His will.</p>\n<p>We have to redefine free will to understand this. Let's start with the basics: what is \"free\" and what is \"will\"?</p>\n<h4>Free</h4>\n<p>Free <em>from influence</em>; no external influence - the decision arises totally from my <em>self</em>, my <em>essence.</em></p>\n<h4>Will</h4>\n<p>What I want. Synonyms/near misses: desire; enjoy; value.</p>\n<h4>What is Free Will?</h4>\n<p>I have the ability to desire whatever I want, based solely on me, without being told what to desire. The \"object\" of His choice in no way influences Him or draws/repels Him in the slightest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, it is possible to desire what you desire based solely on yourself. This is called <em>Ratzon Atzma'i</em>, essential will. This is very hard for humans to wrap our heads around (but Hashem does invite us to become this mature and elevated as well). This type of desire does not express any form of lack, but <em>is</em> a perfection - He chooses \"based on\", so to speak, His own perfection; a choice that is of course, a perfect choice.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>Sources: Rambam Moreh Nevuchim 3:13 (\"Hashem's Essence is identical to His Ratzon\"); and from Chassidus, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likkutei_Torah%2C_Emor.6?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">לקוטי תורה, אמור ו׳</a> (38b); <a href=\"https://he.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5989959\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">החודש הזה לכם, ש\"פ שמיני, פ' החודש, מבה\"ח ניסן, ה'תשל\"ג</a>, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3140357/jewish/page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מאמר יבחר לנו את נחלתינו תשכ\"ג</a>, and finally this essay by Reb Yoel: <a href=\"https://www.toratchabad.com/%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%90%D7%95%D7%95%D7%94-%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%94%D7%99%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9C%D7%95-%D7%93%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%91%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">נתאווה הקב\"ה להיות לו דירה בתחתונים</a>.

Even if the (non-Biblical) custom was to throw it down a cliff, there was no guarantee it would be killed on impact, so there was a definite chance passers-by would find it alive, possibly maimed. Hence the question:</p>\n<p><strong>Did the scapegoat carry a specific amulet, plate, badge, brand or any kind of sign indicating, at least to the children of Israel, it was tabu to touch or eat, even if found alive?</strong></p>\n<p>The motivation for this question is I wish to test the hypothesis that the protocol for Yom-Kippur parallels Gen.4, with Aaron's offering representing Abel's sacrifice, the goat offering representing his murder and the scapegoat representing the curse on Cain. According to this interpretation, there should be a ritual device reminiscent of the mark on Cain.</p>\n<p>My (uneducated) first guess would be a badge bearing a crimson inscription. This is because a Catholic priest once explained to me he understood Psalm 22:6 as alluding to the mark of Cain: an eczema plaque of crimson color, like the dye from the worm.</p>\n<p>I believe the answer must rely on sources outside the Bible.

If it is permitted, is it a good idea?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Moderator note: Regardless of anything you might read here, if this is a matter you are considering practically, we strongly recommend consulting your Rabbi and relevant physical and mental health professionals. Mi Yodeya <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1734\">does not offer</a> personalized professional advice.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is the kind of question which should have been closed because of a rule against asking for practical advice. The reason one should consult your local Orthodox rabbi (LOR) is that he can both give practical advice about how to act; because he can assess individual circumstances to see what is uniquely appropriate for a specific situation; and because he is sensible to see what stands behind the question (like the famous story of the question of whether milk can be use for the four cups at the Seder). Further, random strangers on the Internet who might know nothing or who might misinterpret sources (like Biblical verses or Talmudic stories) should not be trusted for such an important question.</p>\n<p>Putting aside religion for a moment, self-harm such as burning is not healthy for one's psyche. Self-harm is associated with <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S016517811931371X\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">even worse things</a> like suicide attempts. This is not a good path to go down. Going back to religion, there's an idea of וְנִשְׁמַרְתֶּ֥ם מְאֹ֖ד לְנַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם, that one should be exceeding careful when it comes to guarding one's life.</p>\n<p>Also, there is a possibility of channeling mental health issues into a religious expression and thereby giving it legitimacy. For instance, an anorexic can point to Sages who have fasted. There is a phenomenon across religions including Judaism called <a href=\"https://iocdf.org/faith-ocd/what-is-ocd-scrupulosity/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Scrupulosity</a> which is a way of legitimizing Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. Rabbis and therapists dealing with an individual with scrupulosity would even tell them that they need to violate halacha as a way of breaking out of it.</p>\n<p>Therefore, even if other people provide answers which seem to suggest that self-harm like burning oneself (or heating oneself) with a lighter is either allowed or even encouraged, do not listen to them. That is wrong and shortsighted.</p>\n<p>There is a skill of a posek (decider of halacha) in knowing which Talmudic sources should or should not be applied. Sometimes, stories in the Talmud are not meant to be normative halacha, but are to be inspirational of the extent of an idea. Or, these stories made sense for the particular Sage, who had a certain quality, but was not intended for any person off the street.</p>\n<p>For one example of this, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.20a.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 20a</a>. Rav Pappa who asks Abaye why his generation does not merit miracles like prior generations, despite knowing more. Abaye answers that it is because the prior generations were moser nefesh. He relates how Rav Adda bar Ahava I pulled a forbidden garment from a woman he thought was Jewish in the marketplace and was fined for it.</p>\n<p>That kind of extreme behavior was not deemed appropriate even in Abaye and Rav Pappa's generation. He was not really saying that people should take such action, of ripping off women's clothing. And certainly not today.</p>\n<p>My point is that you cannot just point to extreme actions of various Talmudic Sages and claim that it is normative halacha. Don't listen to random people who tell you otherwise, especially if it reinforces potentially harmful behavior. Consult your local Orthodox rabbi.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>Sure, that's exactly what Rabbi Tzaddok did in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.40a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 40a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" Rabbi Tzadok was <strong>enticed by a certain noblewoman to engage in sexual intercourse with her</strong>. He said to her: My heart is weak and I am incapable at present; is there something to eat that can strengthen me? She said to him: There is something non-kosher. He said to her: What difference is there? One who performs such an act eats such food as well.<br />\n<strong>She lit the oven and placed the non-kosher food in it to roast. He climbed and sat in the oven</strong>. She said to him: What is the meaning of this? He said to her: One who performs this act falls into this, i.e., the fires of Gehenna. She said to him: If I had known that the matter was so serious for you, I would not have caused you such anguish.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are additional examples of Rabbis, like Rabbi Elazar ben Dordia (Avodah Zarah 17a), who self-inflicted emotional and physical anguish (weeping until death), leading to immediate and complete atonement.</p>\n<p>While Maimonides (Hilkhot Rotze’ach) rules that one may not injure oneself just like one may not injure others, he refers to \"sinful\" (or meaningless) injury. There are numerous cases where inflicting pain is prescripted, e.g, the fasts ( \"י֧וֹם הַכִּפֻּרִ֣ים ה֗וּא מִֽקְרָא־קֹ֙דֶשׁ֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה לָכֶ֔ם וְעִנִּיתֶ֖ם אֶת־נַפְשֹׁתֵיכֶ֑ם\"), educational beating of children, corporal punishment, forcing other to pay debts, and more.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# From Onkelos to Rashi, was anyone concerned with anthropopathy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>\"Anthropopathy - attribution of human feelings and emotions to non-human beings\".</em></p>\n<p>The Torah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"כִּי ה' אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֵשׁ אֹכְלָה הוּא אֵל קַנָּא׃\"<br />\n\"For YHWH your God is a consuming fire, an impassioned God.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.4.24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut 4.24)</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Onkelos recognizes anthropomorphism and replaces \"God IS fire\" with \"God's WORDS are fire\", but doesn't recognize anthropopathy and leaves \"an impassioned God\" untouched:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אֲרֵי יְיָ אֱלָהָךְ <strong>מֵימְרֵיהּ אֶשָּׁא</strong> אָכְלָא הוּא אֵל קַנָּא:\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For comparison, here are two additional Targums:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אֲרוּם יְיָ אֱלָהָכוֹן מֵימְרֵיהּ אֵישָׁא אָכְלָא אֵישָׁא הוּא אֱלָהָא קַנָאִי וּמִתְפְּרַע בְּקִנְאָה\"<br />\n\"אֲרוּם יְיָ אֱלָהָכוֹן אֶשָׁא דְאָכְלָא אֶשָׁא הוּא אֱלָהָא קִנְאַן וּמִתְפְּרַע בְּקַנָּאִין הוּא:\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, Rashi is fine with \"an impassioned God\".</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אל קנא. מְקַנֵּא לִנְקֹם, אנפר\"מנט בְּלַעַז, מִתְחָרֶה עַל רָגְזוֹ לְהִפָּרַע מֵעוֹבְדֵי עֲ\"זָ:\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before Rambam's transcendentalism, were there commentators who expressed uneasiness regarding Biblical anthropopathy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To answer the OP's question, <strong>R' Saadia Gaon</strong> in <a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300044904/saadia-gaon/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Book of Beliefs and Opinions</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/HaEmunot_veHaDeot%2C_%5BTreatise_II%5D_The_Unity_of_the_Creator.11.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Treatease II, Chapter VIII</a> is also concerned with Anthropopathy (I am using Rosenblatt's translation, so that the relevant points begin in the middle of the chapter):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ואחר כן אדבר על האיכות, והם המקרים, ואומר: שהוא באמת לא יתכן שיקרהו מקרה, כי הוא בורא ‏המקרים כלם. וזה אשר נמצא שאומר שהוא אוהב דבר או שונא דבר, הענין בזה שכל אשר צונו בו ‏קראו אהוב אצלו, כאשר חייבנו לאוהב אותו, באמרו (תהלים ל\"ז כ\"ח) כי י\"י אוהב משפט. (שם י\"א ‏ז') צדיק י\"י צדקות אהב והדומה לזה. וקבץ רבים מהם, ואמר (ירמיה ז' כ\"ג) כי באלה חפצתי נאם ‏י\"י. וכל אשר הזהירנו ממנו שלא נעשהו, קראו שנוא אצלו, מפני שחייבנו לשנאתו, כמו שאמר (משלי ‏ו' ט\"ז) שש הנה שנא י\"י. (ישעיה ס\"א ח') שונא גזל בעולה. וקבץ מהם רבים, ואמר (זכריה ח' י\"ז) כי ‏את כל אלה אשר שנאתי נאם י\"י, ומה שאנו רואים שאומר שהוא רוצה ושהוא כועס, הענין בו, שקצת ‏ברואיו כאשר חייב להם ההצלחה והגמול קורא זה רצון, כאמרו (תהלים קמ\"ז י\"א) רוצה י\"י את ‏יריאיו. (שם פ\"ה ב') רצית י\"י את ארצך. וכאשר יתחייב קצתם הצער והענש, קורא זה כעס, כאמרו ‏‏(שם ל\"ד י\"ז) פני י\"י בעושי רע. ...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I preface my remarks with a general observation, and say (1) that whenever any reference is made in this connection to such matters as substance or accident or the attribute of substance or accident, neither \"much\" nor \"little\" thereof can be applied in the case of the Creator. (2) For it is our firm conviction that He is the Creator of the Universe. There does not, therefore, remain a substance or accident or attribute that was not acquaired or discerned or put together by Him or about which it is not certain that this Creator was its maker. Hence it is out of question and impossible to declare Him to be anything that He has Himself created.</p>\n<p>(3) Consequently for all divine attributes pertaining to either substance or accident that are encountered in the books of prophets it is <em>necessary to find in the Scriptiure <strong>nonanthropomorphic</strong> meanings that would be in keeping with requirements of reason.</em> Whenever then, we the community of believers apply to G-d epithets that have the appearance of automorphisms, this is due to our endeavor to give a proximate and figurative description of deity. They are not to be taken in material sense in which we would apply them to human beings.</p>\n<p>Since, then, these three points ((1), (2), and (3)) have been cleared up by me, thou must no longer be led astray or thrown into uncertainty, Oh thou who studiest this book, by such statements that thou mayest make as \"[G-d] was\" and \"[G-d] wanted\" and \"[G-d] was pleased\" and \"[G-d] was angry\" and other such remarks and similar utterances that occur in Scriptures. For these expressions are used by us only on the basis of the principle previously established by us, to which they must constantly be referred and related. An edifice, let it be noted, is always built from foundations upward, never from top down. Do not, therefore become confused because of some antropomorphic attribute of G-d that thou seest in the Scriptures, or of which thou findest us making common use, with the result that thou wouldst lapse back again, on its account, into doubt.</p>\n<p>(added by ibn Tibbon) But check it against the principle, the true nature of which has already been clarified and firmly established.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saadia Gaon then discusses specific applications of these principles in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/HaEmunot_veHaDeot%2C_%5BTreatise_II%5D_The_Unity_of_the_Creator.9.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter IX</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/HaEmunot_veHaDeot%2C_%5BTreatise_II%5D_The_Unity_of_the_Creator.10.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter X</a> of the treatese to specific examples in the Scripture. Specifically, in chapter IX, regarding the OP's example Devarim 4:24, Saadia Gaon states that it should be translated as <em>He is as punishing as a devouring fire</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Regarding the Targum Onkelos view</strong></p>\n<p>Scholars Israel Drazin and Stanley Wagner discuss this point in the book \"<a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Understanding-Onkelos__p-7672.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Understanding Onkelos</a>\",  Parashas Noach pp. 15-18. They note that while Onkelos frequently omits anthropomorphism and explains what the Torah intends to say, he sometimes does not do so for several reasons:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(1) Replacing every anthropomorphism would alter Scripture too drastically and reduce it to an unrecognizable text because the Torah has so many anthropomorphic statements.</p>\n<p>(2) (Onkelos) might retain the anthropomorphism when the description is included in a metaphorical phrase that he feels is well known and frequently used by his reading audience, like <em>tzelem Elokim</em>.</p>\n<p>(3) (Onkelos) ignores the anthropomorphism when he cannot imagine that a person would accept the word or phrase literally as in Bereshis 2:8, where the verse reads \"The Lord planted a garden...\" No one would think of G-d engaged in an afternoon of planting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Drazin and Wagner, Onkelos' omissions of modifying every anthropomorphism in the Torah are necessary for textual clarity of his translation. Onkelos would not be understanding these anthropomorphisms as the simple reading suggests.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>More on Targum Onkelos</strong></p>\n<p>R' Posen <a href=\"https://www.magnespress.co.il/book/The_Consistency_of_Targum_Onkelos%27_Translation-1753\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Consistency of the Targum Onkelos Translation\"</a>, Perek 1, Section 8 Theology in Targum Onkelos: Research Directions</p>\n<p>R' Posen notes that the approach to change anthropomorphisms has source in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Megillah.3.21?ven=hebrew%7CTosefta_Megillah_-_Machon_Mamre&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Megila</a> 3:21 and also Talmud Bavli <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.49a.11?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 49a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda says: One who translates a verse literally is a liar, since he distorts the meaning of the text, and conversely, one who adds his own translation is tantamount to one who curses and blasphemes God. Rather, to which translation is Rabbi Yehuda referring? He is referring to our accepted translation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Posen then proceeds to say that Saadia Gaon was seemingly the first to deal with this point before it reached Rambam, although later studies of Onkelos took a more balanced view.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Rambam's historical circumstances</strong></p>\n<p>One can also suggest that in part Rambam was addressing the point of Scripture anthropomorphisms because of the Karaite and muslim <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Hazm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibn Hazm</a> attacks on pro-anthropomorphism book <em>Shi'ur Qomah</em>, attributed to R' Yishmael and admired by Sherira and Chai gaons.

It is also taught that much about a person is predetermined before birth—such as whether he will be strong or weak, wise or foolish, rich or poor—\"but not whether he will be righteous or wicked\". These statements suggest an all-encompassing divine determination of all circumstances, except for moral choices.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Torah itself emphatically emphasizes human decision-making freedom. Thus, Moshe Rabbenu declares: \"See, I have set before you today life and good, and death and evil… therefore choose life\". Similarly, the promise to Cain: \"Sin is crouching at the door… but you can rule over it\", implies that humans have the ability to overcome evil.</p>\n<p>How can these teachings be reconciled with the concept of divine omniscience and providence? Does the idea that God determines or at least knows everything in advance contradict human free will?</p>\n\n\n",

First, the commandments are applicable not only in Eretz Israel, but also in the exile:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now I have already written on the meaning of this matter, that these commandments [the T’fillin and the Mezuzah mentioned by Rashi] are personal obligations and, as such, their laws apply in all places just as in the Land! But there is in this Midrash a profound secret, and I have already alluded to it. Now he repeated these commandments about the T’fillin, the study of the words of the Torah, and the Mezuzah, a second time in order to allude to this analogy, that we shall be obligated to observe them after being exiled from the Land of Israel. <em>From these [texts] we learn that all commandments that are personal obligations are binding in all places and that, outside the Land of Israel, we are exempt from duties which apply to ground, such as heave-offering and tithes.</em> So it is interpreted in the Sifre. And the intent of this interpretation is suggested by the fact that he placed the expression therefore shall ye put [these my words in your heart] next to [the verse], and ye shall perish [quickly from off the good Land thus clearly intimating that even after ye shall perish from off the good Land you shall still put these My words in your heart]. But the main reference of the verse [even regarding personal obligations] applies to the Land, as it is written, that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the Land; or it may be that the verse is stating: “that your days may be multiplied, so that you will return [to the Land] and you will prolong your days on it forever.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Second, Ramban states that it is important to teach the commandments to children until they start teaching them to their children <strong>and</strong> also start sharing with you their ideas about the reasons for commandments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In line with the plain meaning of Scripture, it is possible that he comes to add here the expression to speak of them, for there [in the first charge to the individual] he commanded and ‘thou’ shalt speak — you yourself — of them when ‘thou’ sittest in thy house, and here [in the charge to the community he stated that we are to teach the words of Torah to our children until they speak of them always. <em>So also he added here and ye shall ‘teach’ them, for the term v’shinantom [mentioned there] means only that he shall “tell” them the commandments, and here [he added that the obligation extends] until they teach the words of Torah [to their children] <strong>and</strong> they understand them and their reasons [well enough] to discuss them with you at all times.</em> So also he added here as the days of the heavens above the earth which means “for all generations,” or it may refer to the first heaven and earth, and the days of old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It is absolutely a Divine Need that His creations should be perfected.</p>\n<p>So, don't try to be a <em>tzaddik</em> - are you trying to impress Hashem? What difference does it make to Him if you are a <em>tzaddik</em> or not? Just do the Mitzva. <strong>Your service is absolutely essential to Him</strong>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Sources:</strong></p>\n<p>Avodat HaKodesh 3.</p>\n<p>See it explained by the Sfat Emet in Likkutim to Sefer Netzach Yisrael:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בס׳ עבודת הקודש (פ״ג) מה איכפת לו להקב״ה בין שוחט מצואר כו׳, ותמה כי\nהלא עבודה צורך גבוה עיין שם מה שתירץ, ודבריו חסרין תבלין כי בקיצור הוה\nלי׳ למימר כנודע כי ב׳ בחינות יש, שפע לקיום תמידי ושפע להשפיע כמו שכתוב\nבס׳ ובזוה״ק על פסוק שחת לו לא עיין שם פירושו, ואפשר זה כוונתו גם כן\nאבל הנראה מפשטות לשונו הוא רחוק לדעתי כי מה איכפת לקב״ה קאי גם כן על\nבחינה זו שהוא צורך גבוה שהרי מסיים אלא לצרף כו׳, ובגוף הקושיא הי׳ נראה\nלתרץ כי שלימות האדם ודאי צורך גבוה מה שיקיים האדם מצות הש״י ועושה נחת\nרוח ליוצרו ומעלה מיין נוקבין ומקשר העולמות זה בזה על ידי שמעשיו על פי\nהחכמה והשכל ומשפט דעת התורה, ומכל מקום גוף השחיטה אין צורך גבוה רק\nשאדם יאכל כשנשחט דוקא זה שניתן לצרף האדם, וצירוף האדם צורך גבוה, כי\nהמדרש בא לומר שמצות הש״י הוא לצורך שלימות האדם ולא לטובת גבוה אבל\nשלימות האדם ודאי צורך גבוה כן נראה לי נכון, אבל מה שכתבתי מקודם הרא\nהאמת ושניהם כאחד טובים ולשון המחבר מגומגם לענ״ד:</p>\n<p>In Avodat HaKodesh (Chapter 3), [he asks]: “What difference is it to\nthe Holy One, blessed be He, whether one slaughters from the neck [or\nfrom the back of the neck]?” And he expresses wonder at this, for\ndivine service is, ostensibly, a Divine need. See there what he\nanswers.</p>\n<p>But his words are lacking seasoning, for he should have simply said\nwhat is well known, that there are two aspects: one is the flow [of\nDivine influence] for continual sustenance, and one is [the flow] to\nbring forth influence, as is explained in the Zohar and in sifrei\nKabbalah on the verse “He corrupted (shichet) to Him, not [to Him]”;\nsee there his explanation. And perhaps this is also his intent, but\nthe simple reading of his words seems distant to me, because the\nexpression “What difference is it to the Holy One, blessed be He”\nrefers also to that level which is a Divine need, for the Midrash\nconcludes: “[He commanded this] only to refine...”, etc.</p>\n<p>And regarding the core question, it seems possible to answer as\nfollows:</p>\n<p>That the perfection of man is certainly a Divine need, in that man\nfulfills the commandments of the Holy One, blessed be He, and brings\npleasure to his Creator, elevates the Mayin Nukvin, and connects the\nworlds with one another, through actions performed with wisdom,\nintellect, and the judgment of Torah knowledge.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the act of shechita itself is not [intrinsically] a\nDivine need, but rather, that a person should eat only from what was\nslaughtered specifically in the manner prescribed. And this was given\nin order to refine the person, and the refinement of the person is a\nDivine need. For the Midrash comes to teach that the mitzvot of the\nHoly One, blessed be He, are for the purpose of the perfection of man,\nand not for the benefit of the Divine. But that perfection of man is,\nwithout a doubt, a Divine need. This, it seems to me, is the correct\ninterpretation.</p>\n<p>However, what I previously wrote reflects the true perspective, and\nboth explanations are valid and complement one another. Still, in my\nopinion, the author’s wording is unclear and lacking precision.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/4280211/jewish/page.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lo Tih'ye Mishakela 5712</a> by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, who says the same thing (and even quotes OP's Iyov in part 1), and clarifies in part 4 that this need - for His people to be refined - applies to Hashem Himself.

    "content": "# Yehuda Handed Over Samson to the Philistines Because he was a Rodef; but Isn't Battling the Philistines (What Samson did) the Right Thing to do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam (Laws of Foundations of Torah 5:5) states:</p>\n<p>. וְכֵן אִם אָמְרוּ לָהֶם עוֹבְדֵי כּוֹכָבִים תְּנוּ לָנוּ אֶחָד מִכֶּם וְנַהַרְגֶּנּוּ וְאִם לָאו נַהֲרֹג כֻּלְּכֶם. יֵהָרְגוּ כֻּלָּם וְאַל יִמְסְרוּ לָהֶם נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל. וְאִם יִחֲדוּהוּ לָהֶם וְאָמְרוּ תְּנוּ לָנוּ פְּלוֹנִי אוֹ נַהֲרֹג אֶת כֻּלְּכֶם. אִם הָיָה מְחֻיָּב מִיתָה כְּשֶׁבַע בֶּן בִּכְרִי יִתְּנוּ אוֹתוֹ לָהֶם. וְאֵין מוֹרִין לָהֶם כֵּן לְכַתְּחִלָּה. וְאִם אֵינוֹ חַיָּב מִיתָה יֵהָרְגוּ כֻּלָּן וְאַל יִמְסְרוּ לָהֶם נֶפֶשׁ אַחַת מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל:</p>\n<p>Similarly, if gentiles told [a group of Jews]: \"Give us one of you to kill. If not, we will kill all of you,\" they should allow themselves all to be killed rather than give over a single soul to [the gentiles].\nHowever, if [the gentiles] single out [a specific individual] and say: \"Give us so and so or we will kill all of you,\" [different rules apply]: If the person is obligated to die like Sheva ben Bichri, they may give him over to them. Initially, however, this instruction is not conveyed to them. If he is not obligated to die, they should allow themselves all to be killed rather than give over a single soul to [the gentiles].</p>\n<p>The Or Sameach:</p>\n<p>ומה שבשמשון באו אנשי יהודה לאסרך לתתך ביד פלשתים, אף שלא הי' חייב מיתה, נראה משום דמסכן רבים והוי כעוסק בזיופים סימן תכ\"ח בהגה. וזה מה עשית לנו כו'.\nand that regarding Samson, where the men of Judah came to tie you to hand you over to the Philistines, even though he was not liable to die, it appears because he endangered the masses and was tantamount to one who enages in forgery (Choshen Mishpat, section 428 in the Rama glosses) \"and that is \"what have you done to us.\"</p>\n<p><em>But shouldn't Yehuda have waged war to conquer the land as mandated by God? How can they avail themselves of a Rodef analysis? Joining Samson and waging open war and thus willingly endangering themselves was arguably the right thing to so!</em></p>\n\n\n",

As the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.9.2?lang=he&with=Ralbag&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ralbag</a> points out, in Ezra's time, Jewish men had married non-Jewish women who hadn't converted (and had no interest in doing so).</p>\n<p>Ralbag:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ידמה שנשאום בגויתן שאם לא היה כן לא היה אסור בדבר בכל הגוים שזכר כי אם\nכמצרי</p>\n<p>Presumably they married them in a non-Jewish state; otherwise [i.e.\nhad they converted], there would have been no prohibition in all of\nthe nations mentioned here, other than the Egyptians [who require a\ntwo-generation delay].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://%20https://www.sefaria.org/Ezra.9.1?lang=he&with=Malbim&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> basically drives this point home as well -- note the language. \"These Jews are not separate from the locals and their abominations.\" That once the Jewish men married local non-Jewish women, their behavior was no different than the surrounding nations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא נבדלו, פי' שאין הבדל ביניהם ובין עם הארץ, א] במה שהם עושים כתועבותם</p>\n<p>כי נשאו מבנותיהם להם, ואמר מלת כי, באשר מה שנשאו מבנותם הוא הסבה\nשיעשו כתועבותיהם,</p>\n<p>There is no \"separation\", i.e. difference, between the Jewish men and\nthe local nations in their doing the same abominations; their marrying\nnon-Jewish women is the reason that they followed the local\nabominations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The two explanations go hand-in-hand. The women hadn't converted, and were in fact influencing their husbands away from Judaism. That's <em>very</em> different from Deuteronomy's case, of a sincere convert, where our only concern is national lineage -- and the language used is of them joining us.

And the problem was that three hundred men married foreign women (without converting them). It took the Jewish community more than thirty years to address the matter, and as a result, they got a small government rule with the permission of the Persian kings. For what? Because three hundred men married foreign women. And come to think of it, three hundred men out of forty thousand, what percentage is that?

    "content": "# Why is the Midrash criticizing Noach for planting a vineyard?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Jewish tradition views the act of Noach planting a vineyard negatively, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.36.3?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Rabba 36:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Noah, man of the soil, began [vayaḥel]” – he became profaned and unholy [ḥulin]. Why? “And he planted a vineyard.” Should he not have planted something else, that was constructive, a fig tree branch or an olive tree branch? Instead, “he planted a vineyard.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/109624/36610\">this link</a> there is a quote from Ralbag who suggested that perhaps it was not so.</p>\n<p>Indeed, water is the basic need for men. A man cannot survive without water more than 3-7 days (from being fully fit and healthy), compared to much longer times that a man can survive without food. In the ancient world, the most common technology to purify water was to add wine to it. A typical ratio was one measure of wine to 3-4 measures of water. Boiling water was not always possible, especially after the flood, when no dry wood could be found (or in arid areas). Why is the act of Noach perceived negatively from the beginning if it was a good deed necessary for survival?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Thus, in Jewish discourse, Ralbag’s sober observation and the Midrash’s moral rebuke are not necessarily contradictory, but rather illuminate two sides of the same coin.\nJewish tradition often preserves divergent interpretations without contradiction; here, philosophical realism (Ralbag) and ethical admonition (Midrash) together build a fuller picture.</p>\n<p>Ralbag tells us: Noah wanted to produce wine and succeeded – that is a fact.\nRalbag presents the account as a plain statement of events, focusing on human agency and capacity without immediate judgment.</p>\n<p>The Midrash tells us: But it was the wrong decision at that time – that is a value judgment.\nThe Midrash adds a moral frame, interpreting Noah’s choice as flawed due to its timing and spiritual insensitivity.</p>\n<p>Together they teach: In all your actions, consider not only whether you can do it, but whether you should, whether it is appropriate now, and where it might lead.\nThis joined lesson encourages ethical reflection before action – a key principle in Jewish ethics rooted in both ability and discernment.</p>\n<p>Noah was “wise in agriculture,” yet the wisdom of the righteous path only emerged through the critique of his misstep.\nNoah’s technical skill is not denied, but true wisdom — in the eyes of the Torah — is moral wisdom, which becomes visible through the consequences of his actions.</p>\n<p>Thus Noah, the righteous one, becomes a lasting figure of instruction: His story warns us to recognize the boundaries between enjoyment and responsibility.\nDespite his title as a “tzaddik” (righteous man), Noah’s failings are made instructive; his status enhances, rather than diminishes, the significance of the lesson.</p>\n<p>In the words of the Sages: “Beware the passion of wine,” for to Noah it brought a loud “וַי” – Woe! – in multiple forms.\nA play on words from the Torah’s “vayachel” and “vayishkar” leads to the sound “vay” (woe), symbolizing sorrow. The sages warn of wine’s power to bring downfall even to the righteous.</p>\n<p>Had he instead begun with a fig tree, perhaps the Torah would tell a different story – but then we would have learned less about ourselves.\nThis counterfactual highlights that Noah’s mistake serves a didactic function: through his error, readers gain insight into human weakness and the need for restraint.</p>\n<p>Noah’s vineyard is ultimately both encouragement and warning: On the one hand, it shows the pitfalls of human nature (even a righteous man is not immune to temptation), on the other, it reminds us never to lose sight of our divine mission due to worldly enticements.\nHis act stands as both caution and hope — acknowledging human frailty but calling for spiritual vigilance.</p>\n<p>The Torah criticizes Noah so that we may do better: First plant what is necessary and good – then, at the right time and in moderation, wine may also gladden the heart without defiling it.\nThe final teaching is aspirational: the Torah’s critique aims at improvement. When priorities are rightly ordered, even pleasures like wine can be sanctified rather than corrupted.</p>\n\n\n",

In a regular year Adar will have 29 days which means the following Nisan can contain 30 days and the months stay in sync with the lunar cycle.

This scenario seems highly unlikely because the following Nisan must have 30 days. This scenario maintains the 30-29-30-29 sequence for the current year but it disrupts the sequence going into the following year.</p>\n<p>Scenario #2: Adar I and Adar II both contain 29 days.

To me that rung untrue because no one's argument against the Radzyner was \"nignaz.\"</p>\n<p>This whole train of thought led me to wonder - had there been any other attempts throughout history, however unsuccessful, to find the chilazon?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_HaLevi_Herzog\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchak Isaac Halevi Herzog</a> spent much time in attempting to identify the <em>chilazon</em>, writing his <a href=\"https://porphyrology.com/view-doctorate/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PhD thesis</a> on the topic.</p>\n<p>His preferred candidate was, in fact, neither of the two you listed in the question, but rather a different genus of sea snail, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janthina\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>janthina</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Radbaz and others were already with the idea that they could find the chilazon any time. This matches the idea that in the 16th century there was a high messianic fervour, so the restoration of techelet is a necessity and harbinger of the redemption.</p>\n<p>But no formal candidates were ever proposed perhaps because whoever really knew about it mentioned that it was the porphyra, although they might not have been able to precisely gotten their hands on it or try to experiment with it.</p>\n<p>Until the fall of Constantinople, there was a formal ban to use any murex trunculus in the lands of the Byzantine and Holy Roman Empire. As the empire fell you see acharonim all the sudden talking about the chilazon and even identifying it with the porphyra, aka murex trunculus.</p>\n<p>So it could be well that we all knew along which animal was but we did not dare to write it down due to fear of repression or censorship. The Ramban clearly stated that the chilazon was in power of the Melech Goyim and no one would dare to wear it, so it is possible that any open discussion of the identify was frown upon too.</p>\n\n\n",

But it never truly belonged to anyone.</p>\n<p>Meaning you could never sell the land to another forever, the land d was Gods and given to the Hebrews to keep.</p>\n<p>Maybe my understanding is wrong?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>A Covenantal Stewardship Rather than Absolute Ownership</p>\n<p>The Land of Israel was conceived as a unique blend of private stewardship and collective ownership under God. On one hand, each Israelite family received its own portion of land – there was a concept of private property and inheritance. On the other hand, that ownership was never absolute: it was circumscribed by God’s commandments and the community’s welfare. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rav_Hirsch_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.8.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Hirsch’s commentary on Deuteronomy 8:11</a> highlights the spiritual truth behind this arrangement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Through <strong>Birkat Hamazon</strong>, the consciousness should always be kept awake to <strong>whom <em>WE</em> owe the land and its blessings</strong>, under what conditions and for what purpose we receive it, that we remain worthy of the received blessings only as long as we remain mindful of the obligation that renews with every received divine gift, to become a \"blessing\" ourselves, a blessing of God's work, fulfillers of the divine will on earth. Beware lest you forget, for it is precisely the abundance that could make us forget God. (Deuteronomy 8:10-11)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Land of Israel in Jewish law was neither a purely private commodity nor a free-for-all collective in the modern sense, but something higher: a holy inheritance held in trust as we see in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Lech_Lecha.15.144-145?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar I 83a (15:144-145)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The inner meaning of this story is: Had Abram not descended to Egypt and been tested there, his portion would not have been with HaShem. Likewise, his descendants, whom HaShem wanted to make into a unique and perfect nation and bring close: Had they not first descended to Egypt and been tested there, they would not have become HaShem's chosen people. <strong>Similarly, the Holy Land: Had it not first been given to Canaan for dominion, it would not have become the lot and portion of the Holy One, blessed be He.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, each person’s plot was a piece of the national patrimony under God’s domain, with the entire people responsible for each other and for the land itself. The divine rules of ownership ensured that the land’s benefits were shared and sustained collectively – whether through mandatory charity from the harvest, communal rest for the soil, or restrictions on harmful farming practices as we see in Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.7.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kamma 7:7</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One may not raise small domesticated animals, i.e., sheep and goats, in settled areas of Eretz Yisrael, as they graze on people’s crops. But one may raise them in Syria, despite the fact that with regard to many other halakhot Syria is treated like Eretz Yisrael, and in the wilderness of Eretz Yisrael.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Did Napoleon come to Jerusalem and want to rebuild the temple?",
    "content": "# Did Napoleon come to Jerusalem and want to rebuild the temple?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard one Rav said that Napoleon came to Jerusalem and saw us lamenting the destruction of the Temple and wanted to rebuild it, however the rabbis said no.</p>\n<p>Is that reported elsewhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Responding to the title question, Napoleon was not able to reach Jerusalem during his campaign in the Land of Israel. Famously, he laid siege on Acre (Akko) in 1799, but lost, and from there backtracked to Egypt (for a short summary of his time in the Land of Israel, see <a href=\"https://www.shapell.org/historical-perspectives/articles/napoleon-in-the-holy-land/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). So at least that part of the story isn't true.</p>\n<p>However, there were a couple of instances during his reign where he said things that were either explicitly related to the Temple or could be hinted at that. First, he had pre-prepared a <a href=\"https://www.napoleon-series.org/ins/weider/c_jews.html#Appendix%202\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">proclamation</a> to be announced in Jerusalem after he captured it, where he would have proclaimed the Land of Israel (Palestine in his words) a Jewish state. Such autonomy would likely have allowed the Jews to rebuild the Temple. In 1800, Napoleon declared: \"If I governed a nation of Jews, I should reestablish the Temple of Solomon.\" (<a href=\"https://www.napoleon-series.org/ins/weider/c_jews.html#:%7E:text=On%20the%2016th%20of%20August,reestablish%20the%20Temple%20of%20Solomon.%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>; see <a href=\"https://www.nsfarchives.altervista.org/napoleon/forum/archive2002_config.pl@md=read%3Bid=8815.html#:%7E:text=(It%20is%20while,Temple%20de%20Salomon.)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for the full quote and the original French).</p>\n<p>So these are indications that Napoleon at a time was interested in rebuilding the Temple, as he saw that as the best way to gain favor in the eyes of the Jews. Having failed in the Land of Israel, however, he chose a different practical and ideological approach: the French Emancipation of the Jews. There are certain arguments to be made that at some point he shifted more into an ideological direction of attempting to redefine the Jewish belief in the redemption as something surrounding himself (as the messianic figure) and France (as the New Jerusalem), and the Emancipation as the Jewish Redemption (Geulah) (see <a href=\"https://www.napoleon-series.org/ins/weider/c_jews.html#Appendix%202:%7E:text=Temple%20of%20Solomon.%22-,Why%20Did%20Napoleon%20Do%20This%3F,-It%20just%20does\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for info). Thus, for example, he established the Grand Sanhedrin which was mainly intended to give supposed Jewish halachic legitimacy to the emancipation. If you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Sanhedrin#:%7E:text=The%20decisions%20of,or%20Christian.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">look</a> at the topics discussed by the Grand Sanhedrin, you'll see that one of their decisions was announcing that Jews should see their birthplace as their <strong>fatherland</strong>. This was of course important in establishing primacy of French identity over Jewish identity (with the hopes of similar views spreading across Europe during a time when it was believed Napoleon would be able to conquer at least all of the West), solidifying the view that France was the new Jerusalem and the new Land of Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yoḥanan says: Grinding is nothing other than a language of a transgression of sexual intercourse, and so the verse says: “Then let my wife grind unto another man” (Job 31:10).

Not to be confused with King Chiram of Tyre, who was also involved in the building of the Temple.</p>\n<p>Here is how (Pseudo-)Rashi explains his lineage (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%91_%D7%91_%D7%99%D7%92\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei HaYamim 2:13</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואביו איש צורי - יהודי היה יושב בצור דוגמא עובד אדום הגתי (שמואל ב' ו) שהיה יושב בגת ולוי היה ובמלכים (א ז) כתיב ובן אשה אלמנה ממטה נפתלי ואביו איש צורי אלא אמו מדן ואביו מנפתלי ומה צריך לייחס מאיזה שבט היה אביו ואמו זהו שכתוב (בראשית ל') דנני אלהים וגם נפתולי אלהים וגו' (שם) אמרה רחל מעתה עקמתי פתולים עקמומיות עשיתי עד שאני יכולה לדמות עצמי ללאה אחותי אם לאה תתפאר בבצלאל בנה שיעשה המשכן יצטרך להשתתף במלאכתו אחד מבני דן שנאמר ואתו אהליאב בן אחיסמך למטה דן ואם שלמה בן אחותי יבנה ב\"ה צריך להשתתף עמו מבני דן ונפתלי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this Chiram was descended from Dan on his mother's side. And so the (Pseudo-)Rashi you quote surmises that he may have been descended from Shimshon, as an attempt to explain the choice of the name Yachin for the pillar.</p>\n\n\n",

She was scared she would pass away since she ate from it. Since she didn't want him to marry another woman she therefore gave him to eat so if she dies so does he.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is nothing in the verse itself (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.3.6.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit 3:6</a>) that suggests that she gave it to Adam to eat first. That verse reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתֵּ֣רֶא הָֽאִשָּׁ֡ה כִּ֣י טוֹב֩ הָעֵ֨ץ לְמַאֲכָ֜ל וְכִ֧י תַֽאֲוָה־ה֣וּא לָעֵינַ֗יִם וְנֶחְמָ֤ד הָעֵץ֙ לְהַשְׂכִּ֔יל וַתִּקַּ֥ח מִפִּרְי֖וֹ וַתֹּאכַ֑ל וַתִּתֵּ֧ן גַּם־לְאִישָׁ֛הּ עִמָּ֖הּ וַיֹּאכַֽל׃\nWhen the woman saw that the tree was good for eating and a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was desirable as a source of wisdom, she took of its fruit and ate. She also gave some to her husband, and he ate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further, there is nothing in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.3.6.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi's words</a> that would specifically lend an interpretation that runs contrary to that interpretation, that should cause us to revisit that assumption. Rashi wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותתן גם לאישה. שֶׁלֹּא תָמוּת הִיא וְיִחְיֶה הוּא, וְיִשָּׂא אַחֶרֶת:\nותתן גם לאשה AND SHE GAVE ALSO TO HER HUSBAND so that she should not die and he remain alive to take another wife (Genesis Rabbah 19:5).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea could very well be that, after eating, she reflected and decided that she should give to her husband. Such contemplation that she would die is not something that she would do and then, despite that, eat it! It would be after eating and having regrets, now that she realizes the repercussions.</p>\n<p>Indeed, Rashi seldom innovates his own interpretations to Torah. Instead, he \"channels\" existing midrashim. In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.19.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishit Rabba 19:5</a>, this appears as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַתִּקַּח מִפִּרְיוֹ וַתֹּאכַל (בראשית ג, ו), אָמַר רַבִּי אַיְבוּ סָחֲטָה עֲנָבִים וְנָתְנָה לוֹ, רַבִּי שִׂמְלָאי אָמַר בְּיִשּׁוּב הַדַּעַת בָּאת עָלָיו, אָמְרָה לֵיהּ מַה אַתָּה סָבוּר שֶׁאֲנִי מֵתָה וְחַוָּה אַחֶרֶת נִבְרֵאת לְךָ (קהלת א, ט): אֵין כָּל חָדָשׁ תַּחַת הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ, אוֹ שֶׁמָּא אֲנִי מֵתָה וְאַתְּ יוֹשֵׁב לְךָ הַטְלִיס, (ישעיה מה, יח): לֹא תֹהוּ בְרָאָהּ לָשֶׁבֶת יְצָרָהּ, רַבָּנָן אָמְרֵי הִתְחִילָה מְיַלֶּלֶת עָלָיו בְּקוֹלָהּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>She took from its fruit and ate” – Rabbi Aivu said: She squeezed grapes and gave it to him [Adam]. Rabbi Simlai said: She came to him persuasively. She said to him: ‘What, do you think that I will die and another Eve will be created for you? “There is nothing new under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 1:9). Or, perhaps [you think that] I will die and you will sit alone? “He did not create it [the world] for emptiness, He formed it to be inhabited”’ (Isaiah 45:18).\nThe Rabbis say: She began sobbing at him plaintively with her voice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This reads fairly clearly as her already facing death, for having eaten it, and now trying to convince Adam to eat as well.</p>\n\n\n",

For convenience, I grouped several questions in one here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\"<em>And may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah—<br />\nthrough the offspring which the LORD will give you by this young woman</em> -<br />\nThe whole point of Perez's lineage was King David. <strong>What was special about the house of Perez (except for being born \"in sin\") for Oved to be likened backward to?</strong></li>\n<li>\"<em>And the women said to Naomi, 'Blessed be the LORD, who has not withheld a redeemer from you today!'... He will renew your life and sustain your old age; for he is born of your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons.\n\"</em> -<br />\nThe ending glorifies Naomi and presents Boaz's acquisition as Naomi's benefit. <strong>What does she have to do with the move? How does she profit from the deal?</strong></li>\n<li>\"<em>Naomi took the child and held it to her bosom. She became its foster mother, and the women neighbors gave him a name, saying, “A son is born to Naomi!” They named him Obed; he was the father of Jesse, the father of David.</em>\" -<br />\nThe child, Obed, was born to Ruth and Boaz. <strong>What does he have to do with Naomi to be considered her son? Why did the neighbor women give him the name - what kind of practice is this? Why doesn't the text tell how Boaz named his son upon circumcision</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>Maybe a stand-alone question:<br />\n4. \"<em>I am also acquiring Ruth the Moabite, the wife of Mahlon, as my wife, so as to perpetuate the name of the deceased upon his estate, that the name of the deceased may not disappear from among his kinsmen and from the gate of his home town.</em> -<br />\n<strong>Doesn't \"<em>perpetuate the name of the deceased that his name may not disappear</em>\" mean that the child will be called after Mahlon and Elimelech, rather than Boaz? Otherwise, how didn't Mahlon's name disappear?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Someone may say that Boaz was not the father. Some may say that the marriage was invalid. So the Megillah emphasizes all of steps to enforce that they are real and good.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Malbim has a clever reading: there is actual Yibum -- marrying the widow of one's deceased, childless brother -- and then there is quasi-Yibum: in the spirit of the law of Yibum, having other family members marry the widow to carry on the name.</p>\n<p>As Boaz was a cousin, this was in-the-spirt-of Yibum, not actual Yibum.</p>\n<p>In real Yibum, a marriage ceremony is (technically) not required -- they just move in together. (The rabbis later added a for-show ceremony, for obvious reasons.) In a sense, it's that the first brother's marriage never really ended, and just transferred to the living brother.</p>\n<p>So the verse is stressing that this was quasi-Yibum. It required proper marriage (\"he took her\", and <em>then</em> she became his wife) before cohabitation.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>An alternative suggestion -- the narrator notes that by the end of the book, Naomi was walking around with baby Oved, and the townspeople are saying, \"hey look, Naomi's new baby!\".

    "content": "# How does one choose his Rav - Do the Talmidim of Beis Shamai have an obligation to follow Beis Hillel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>TLDR: How does one choose a Rav in the first place? And what does one do if they listen to 2 Rabbeim that contradict one another?</strong></p>\n<p>Apologies for such a large post:</p>\n<p>When the Gemara was compiled, arguably the 2 largest camps of schools of thought were Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel, and the law was decided in favor of Beis Hillel. At that point in time, did the Talmidim of Beis Shamai have an obligation to start holding like Beis Hillel as well, in direct contradiction to what their own Rabbeim told them to do?</p>\n<p>Imagine if today, hypothetically speaking, an Ashkenazi Jew who has an Ashkenazi Rov, is told that the correct approach in life is actually Sefardi. On the one hand, he literally has his own Rebbe that he turns to and follows, and on the other hand, the law has now officially been decided opposite of his Mesorah. Do we now tell him to stop doing things in an Ashkenaz way? Is he liable to punishment for LITERALLY FOLLOWING HIS REBBE? Who has a Mesorah? What happens in that case? Because on the one hand, Mesorah is so important, and on the other hand, so is following the CORRECT Halacha?</p>\n<p>This question deeply bothers me because there are so many differences in Yiddishkeit, so many Rabbanim saying so many things, and it seems impossible (in my humble perspective) for someone to be doing something correctly according to everyone. Ok realistically, I know there are a bunch of things we all agree on, but how is a person supposed to know they're really doing the ratzon Hashem when there are so many different shitos, hashkafos, and minhagim?</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tefillin Rashi versus Rabbeinu Tam</li>\n<li>Tefillin on Chol HaMoed or not</li>\n<li>Techeiles actually being from the Murex snail or not</li>\n<li>The myriad differences between Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel</li>\n<li>Eating Gebrukts or not on Pesach</li>\n<li>Cholov Yisroel</li>\n<li>Pas Yisroel</li>\n<li>Eating cholent on Thursday night or not</li>\n<li>Where the true international dateline is Halachically</li>\n<li>Many more Minhagim some do others don't</li>\n<li>Neitz versus Olos and Shkiah versus Tzeis (GRA vs Magen Avraham)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The point is - what is the correct way of doing something in accordance with what Hashem wants if we have differences in opinion?</p>\n<p><em><strong>How does one choose a Rov?</strong></em></p>\n<p>What if someone has many Rabbis they follow or listen to? My perspective is that why should I \"nail the coffin shut\" and only choose 1 Rav, if A: there is the possibility the Rav might be wrong or B: I'm fostering close mindedness by only following 1 way of Da'as Torah?</p>\n<p>And please do not suggest asking your LOR. This question premises on trying to find which Rov or Rabbanim to follow when he doesn't have anyone that he solidly clings tightly and blindly to.</p>\n\n\n",

Similarly, and Og the king of Bashan, who ‘dwelt’ in Ashtaroth, at Edrei means that it was previously the land of Rephaim [and then it was occupied by the king of the Amorites] as I will explain with the help of G-d. And because Scripture states, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei, it indicates that Ashtaroth is the name of a place in which Edrei is located [as will be explained further]. The text of the Sifre is as follows: “‘B’ashtaroth’ — it was as hard as ashtaroth. ‘B’edrei’ — this was the seat of the government [i.e., the royal city].” Rashi wrote: “Ashtaroth — is an expression denoting rocks and hardness. Ashtaroth is Ashteroth-karnaim where the Rephaim were, as it is said, and they smote the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim. ‘B’edrei’ — this was the name of the kingdom [indicating that the kingdom of Edrei was located in Ashteroth-karnaim]. And so it is written, ‘ashteroth’ of thy sheep, meaning, as Targum [Onkelos] rendered it [‘the flocks of thy sheep’]. And our Rabbis have said: Why is the name ashtaroth given to them [i.e., flocks of sheep]? It is because they ‘enrich’ [from the Hebrew word ashir — rich] their owners and strengthen them like these ashtaroth which are strong rocks.” [This is Rashi’s language].Now the Rabbi [Rashi] incorporated into the word [ashtaroth] two meanings [strength and riches], but we do not know from what source the Rabbi inferred that ashtaroth is a name for rocks and stones. But it is possible for us to say that ashtaroth is a term for flocks of sheep, from the word ashir (rich) as in the words of the Sages [quoted above: “Why is their name ashtaroth? It is because they enrich their owners”]. Ashteroth-karnaim was a place of high mountains upon which there were strongholds of stone, these being likened by Scripture to “the horns of cattle,” just as Scripture likens them to “teeth,” as it says upon ‘the crag’ [literally: “the tooth”] of the rock, and the stronghold. Similarly, upon ‘the horns’ of the altar. So also, ‘b’keren’ ben shamen [literally: “in a fruitful ‘horn'”] which the Targum [Yonathan ben Uziel] renders: “On a high hill, in a fruitful land.” There, [upon these high hills,] the flocks of sheep ascend, the he-goats, the she-goats, and the wild-goats and their like; and therefore the place is called Ashteroth-karnaim [because the flocks which “enrich” their owners (ashtaroth) ascend to the “horns” of the mountain (karnaim)]. So also, and they served Baal and the Ashtaroth — ‘Ashtaroth’ because the idol was made in the form of a sheep in order to protect them [the flocks of sheep], in accordance with their foolish belief. [This is in line with our explanation of the word ashtaroth as a synonym for sheep.] Now at the foot of the mountain they built a city whose name was Edrei, this being intimated in the verse which states, and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, unto battle at Edrei, denoting that he gathered his entire army to the city where the palace of the king and the throne of the kingdom were. And this is the purport of the [following] Midrashic text [which seems to agree with Rashi’s interpretation], wherein the Rabbis, of blessed memory, have stated: “Who dwelt in Ashtaroth, at Edrei. Even if Og himself had not been difficult to defeat but had resided in Ashtaroth, he would have been difficult to defeat, because the city was a difficult one to capture etc.” Therefore they interpreted, Ashtaroth to mean that it was “as hard as Ashtaroth,” [the phrase from which Rashi, quoted above, deduced that the word ashtaroth is defined as “hard”], as if to say that his residence was like the fortified city of Ashteroth-karnaim from which he and his family originated; for at that time he was not residing in Ashtaroth, but was residing in the land of the Amorites. And “the place of the government” [mentioned in the Sifre above] means that the city where he lived was Edrei but Bashan was the name of the land of his kingdom.</p>\n\n\n",

But doesn’t <strong>Rav say: The Heman mentioned in the Bible (I Kings 5:11) is the same person as Moses</strong>? This is proven by the fact that it is written here: “Heman” (Psalms 88:1), which is Aramaic for trusted, and it is written there about Moses: “For he is the trusted one in all My house” (Numbers 12:7). The Gemara answers: There were two Hemans, one of whom was Moses, and the other a Temple singer from among the descendants of Samuel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How is this possible?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>First off, the original text of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.15a.10?vhe=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud</a> does not specify <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.5.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Kings 5:11</a>. That is the interpolated English commentary from Rav Adin Steinsaltz, and based on Rashi ad loc. It might be absolutely correct as an interpretation, but clarity is important. All the Talmud literally says is (translated):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But doesn’t Rav say: Heman is Moses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To expand on Rav's approach to certain Biblical books, I would point to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.1.3?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabba 1:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי סִימוֹן בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי וְרַבִּי חָמָא אֲבוּהָ דְּרַבִּי הוֹשַׁעְיָא בְּשֵׁם רַב, אָמְרֵי, לֹא נִתַּן דִּבְרֵי הַיָּמִים אֶלָּא לִדָּרֵשׁ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Simon, in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, and Rabbi Ḥama father of Rabbi Hoshaya, in the name of Rav, said: Chronicles was given only for expounding...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to show certain absolute contradictions between Divrei Hayamim (Chronicles) and other narratives. The idea seems to be that we should not look to the plain meaning of such verses. Rather, the only purpose of such verses is as coded references, conveying some deep midrashic meaning. As I have argued <a href=\"https://parsha.blogspot.com/2014/06/was-calev-ben-yefuneh-same-person-as.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elsewhere in the past</a>, this idea of לא ניתן אלא / \"it was only given for\" could be understood as that it was only <strong>canonized</strong> in respect to its midrashic meaning. Therefore, we should not be troubled with contradictions with other Biblical books.</p>\n<p>That midrash in Vayikra Rabba, from Rav, goes on to interpret this verse (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.4.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Chronicles 4:18</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“His Judahite wife bore Yered father of Gedor, [Ḥever father of Sokho, and Yekutiel father of Zano'aḥ; these are the sons of Bitya daughter of Pharaoh whom Mered took as a wife]”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>such that many of the names in the verse are actually coded references to Moshe and aspects of his personality.</p>\n<p>Heiman is presumably another instance of Rav interpreting a verse in this way.</p>\n<p>Now, which Heiman verse is being referenced regarding the identification of הֵימָן זֶה מֹשֶׁה? Rav Steinsaltz, following Rashi, says that it is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.5.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&qh=%D7%94%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%9E%D6%B8%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Melachim 5:11</a> that refers to Moshe:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He was wiser than anybody else—including Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Chalkol, and Darda the sons of Mahol.

Even so, I don't think that is predicated on the verse in Melachim but on a different verse in Divrei Hayamim. Again, we can look to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.9.1?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabba 9:1</a>, where I can excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דִכְתִיב (דברי הימים א ב, ו): וּבְנֵי זֶרַח זִמְרִי וְאֵיתָן וְהֵימָן וְכַלְכֹּל [ודרע] [ודרדע] כֻּלָּם חֲמִשָּׁה, זִמְרִי, רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי אָמַר זֶה עָכָן, וְלָמָּה קוֹרְאוֹ זִמְרִי, שֶׁעָשָׂה כְּמַעֲשֵׂה זִמְרִי. וְרַבָּנָן אָמְרֵי שֶׁנִּזַּמְּרוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל עַל יָדוֹ. אֵיתָן זֶה אַבְרָהָם אָבִינוּ עַל שֵׁם (תהלים פט, א): מַשְׂכִּיל לְאֵיתָן הָאֶזְרָחִי. הֵימָן זֶה משֶׁה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (במדבר יב, ז): בְּכָל בֵּיתִי נֶאֱמָן הוּא. רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָן אָמַר זֶה עָכָן, עַל שֵׁם (יהושע ז, כ): אָמְנָה אָנֹכִי חָטָאתִי. כַּלְכֹּל זֶה יוֹסֵף, עַל שֵׁם (בראשית מז, יב): וַיְכַלְכֵּל יוֹסֵף.

Zimri – Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: This is Akhan, as he performed the act of Zimri. The Rabbis say: It is because Israel was pruned [nizmeru] on his account. Eitan – this is Abraham our patriarch, based on: “A contemplation by Eitan the Ezrahite” (Psalms 89:1). Heiman – this is Moses, as it is stated: “In all My household he is trusted [ne’eman]” (Numbers 12:7). Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: This is Akhan, based on: “Indeed [omna], I have sinned” (Joshua 7:20). Kalkol – this is Joseph, based on: “Joseph sustained [vaykhalkel]” (Genesis 47:12). Darda – this is the generation [dor] of the wilderness, which was full of knowledge [de’a].  “All of them were five” – do we not know that all of them were five? Rather, it teaches that even Akhan was with them in the World to Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The verse that mentions כֻּלָּם חֲמִשָּׁה is the one in Divrei Hayamim. Thus, this seems to be the similar approach of interpreting that names that appear in Divrei Hayamim, rather than taking them in the straightforward peshat meaning.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Not sure what's bothering you. Two different people named Heiman.</p>\n<p>The point in Bava Basra is to really expand on King Solomon's wisdom.</p>\n<p>\"He was even wiser than Ethan the Ezrachite, Heiman, Kalkol, and Darda, people of Machol.\"</p>\n<p>If these are just random people from his time who were smart, eh okay. The Midrashic reading, however, is that all of these names are coded references to great leaders before King Solomon, which would therefore make King Solomon sound a whole lot greater:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"He was even wiser than [Abraham], who was <em>mighty</em> [in spreading\nmonotheism] and yet a good <em>citizen</em> [as he showed respect to those\naround him]; and [Moses], <em>the faithful one</em> [as \"meheimna\" is Aramaic\nfor \"faithful\"]; and [Joseph], the <em>sustainer/provider</em> [for the\nancient Middle East during the famine], and the whole <em>generation who\nknew</em> G-d's presence intensely while witnessing miracles in the desert, <em>the people</em> who achieved <em>forgiveness.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So yes, there was a literal Heiman, a Levite Temple chorister; but the verse in Kings is giving a coded reference to Moses. Whether the verse intended <em>both</em> literally the chorister and, if you read between the lines, Moses; or was only intending for Moses ... is a question of whether that homiletic line in the Talmud is intended as <em>the</em> interpretation, or <em>another</em> level of interpretation. (Both approaches are acceptable.)</p>\n\n\n",

For example, the Rema (O\"C 494) cites a custom to adorn the Shul with greenery on Shavuot. The Gra held that it is forbidden to do so because the Goyim similarly decorate their houses of worship (there is discussion about what kinds of greenery were forbidden by the Gra). Some poskim disagree with the Gra on the grounds that if we have our own reason to do something, then it cannot be considered Chukat Hagoyim (see for example Daat Torah O\"C 494). In the case of standing for the Kallah, there has been a reason given, which according to this opinion would then take it out of the category of Chukat Hagoyim:</p>\n<p>The Mishnah relates that when people would come to bring the bikkurim, the people in Jerusalem would stop what they were doing and stand up. Rav Ovadiah Mebartenura explains they did this out of respect for those engaged in a mitzvah. He writes that this principle applies to certain other mitzvot as well, such as carrying a coffin to burial and carrying a baby to the bris milah. <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/27291/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">There are those who suggest</a> that this is the basis for the practice to stand when the Chattan and Kallah walk down the aisle.</p>\n\n\n",

Thus is known the greatness of the virtue of our forefather Abraham, ע\"ה, in his devotion to God, and the strength of his love and desire to do His will, even to perish, and with all his resources, for the glory of God, may He be exalted. And all the days he longed and awaited for whichever test to surrender His soul to perish for the sanctity of His Name. Therefore, in the Story on Akkeidah it is written, \"And Abraham awoke in the morning.\" His intention was to get up early in the morning to hurry and carry out his deed of slaughtering his only son immediately, because he feared that later he would not be able to do so and that his mind would not arise to fulfill this commandment to carry out his deed, and when it's later written, \"do not lay your hand on the boy.\" And so it is written in the Ur of Chaldeans, that God took him out of the Ur of the Chaldeans. The intent to say, because he did not want to come out of the furnace when he saw that he was not burned, and he delayed and walked in it, lest he burn up in honor of the God until the Holy One, blessed be He, brought him out Himself from Ur of Chaldeans. And that is why it's written \"He brought him out of the Ur of Chaldeans\". And his (Abraham's) dedication of the soul and the strength of the love for God stands for his sons after him in every generation to abolish from them all harsh decrees, as it says, \"And he bound Isaac his son,\" that is the good that was to Israel, because he bound all the souls of Israel with him. And this, and \"he placed his son upon the pieces of wood\", means to say, above the test of the tree of knowledge, and this way it was established. \"And Abraham still stood\" that why חז\"ל say <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.48.8?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 48:8</a>, \"For Abraham our father, may God bless him, stands at the entrance of Gehenna, etc.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can a Sotah profit from sinning?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A Sotah is a woman who went into seclusion with someone after her husband warned her not to go into seclusion with that man. This is a sin.</p>\n<p>If a Sotah didn’t do a sexual act while in seclusion, she is rewarded with having children.</p>\n<p>We know there a concept in Gemara that a sinner can’t profit. So how can this lady be rewarded with children as a consequence of sinning by going into seclusion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30969&st=&pgnum=124\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Divrei Cheifetz</a> (end of top paragraph) answering a different but related question, suggests that having children is not a reward per se, but rather a natural consequence of the humiliation the accused woman undergoes during the sotah process. He cites the principle of Chazal that inability to have children is one of the things which depends on mazal, not on merit. When someone undergoes great embarrassment Chazal say that on some level they experience death. If so, he writes, their mazal is automatically reset and the old mazal that was stopping them from having children is removed.</p>\n<p>(If something is a natural consequence rather than a reward, it does not fall into the category of not rewarding the sinner. To illustrate: if someone robs a bank, they may profit from their sin, but it doesn't contradict this principle because they are not being rewarded, the fact that they have the stolen money is just a natural result).</p>\n<p>However, as @Nahum pointed out, this answer will not suffice for the opinion in the Gemara that women who can already have children but with a painful childbirth will now be able to have easier births, etc.</p>\n<p>The Divrei Mussar offers a different approach. He writes that there is a principle in Chazal that Hashem does not hold back reward even for someone steeped in sin. This woman who defied her husband to be together with this man, and yet held herself back from sinning, is deserving of some reward for her great restraint, even in the context of her previous failures. When she undergoes the humiliation of the Sotah process, this atones for the sin of secluding with the man. But the zchus of holding back and not completing her sin is still there to be rewarded.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps it can be explained based off of another comment by Chazal brought in Rashi to Bamidbar 5:12 that if one withholds what should be given to the kohen then he will end up going to the kohen with his sotah wife in tow (as the kohen is the one that administers the process).</p>\n<p>Now, why would someone withhold matnos kehunah? He may not recognize what the kohen is doing for him or doesn't appreciate it enough that he feels the need to support him for it. Or he may be downright miserly and tight-fisted. Whatever the exact reason, these middos, brought over to the home front with regard to his wife, will no doubt have a devastating effect on their relationship. His wife will not feel appreciated, treasured, loved, worthy of her husband spending his money on her and on and on. She will then potentially be open to a more generous and attentive man's attentions.</p>\n<p>It turns out that to some extent the husband is to blame, for through his mistreatment of his wife he is pushing her to do things she would otherwise not consider doing.</p>\n<p>Therefore, if she doesn't actually commit adultery it makes sense that she receives some compensation for being put through the wringer of the sotah ordeal, as she was somewhat responding to her husband's mistreatment.</p>\n<p>(See <a href=\"https://musingsonthetorah.blogspot.com/2023/05/he-made-me-do-it.html?m=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>While it is of course true that she shouldn't have secluded herself especially with a man that her husband specifically cautioned her regarding, however, once she did, with the ostensible purpose of committing adultery, it is also true that during the seclusion she resisted the enormous pull and desire she has for the man, overcoming the strong attraction she feels toward him.</p>\n<p>Although it was certainly wrong of her to seclude herself with him initially and while it was definitely a mess of her own making still and all she did ultimately avoid acting carnally on her feelings and it is for not taking it to the next level that she is rewarded.</p>\n<p>Compare it to say someone that goes to a brothel but at the last minute leaves before committing the sin.</p>\n\n\n",

Is the implication that she had a baby but its father died or divorced her? Or is the passage predicated on a belief that women could nurse children without having first given birth themselves?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The gemara does not say anything about her being embarrassed to be seen nursing. I also don't see that implied in the commentaries. All I see is a very \"diplomatic\" statement that covers all possibilities.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want to get married.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This carries everything:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I have never had a baby so I cannot lactate.</li>\n<li>Even if I could lactate, I don't want to harm my prospects of getting married.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Possibility 2 covers all cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>She already has a baby and that would embarrass her</li>\n<li>It would not embarrass her to reveal she had a baby, but it would otherwise disrupt her prospects of getting married</li>\n<li>They did know how to induce lactation back then</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>So, the excuse the gemara provides for single women is designed to be diplomatic and cover all possibilities without implying any of them, and without causing enmity.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't understand the question. Yes, the Talmud was dealing with reality, and not suggesting something that does not accord with reality. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.26a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">passage</a> in question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סָבַר רַב יוֹסֵף לְמֵימַר: אוֹנוֹקֵי בְּשָׂכָר שְׁרֵי מִשּׁוּם אֵיבָה. אֲמַר לֵיהּ אַבָּיֵי: יָכְלָה לְמֵימַר, אִי פְּנוּיָה הִיא — ״בָּעֵינָא לְאִינְּסוֹבֵי״, אִי אֵשֶׁת אִישׁ הִיא — ״לָא קָא מִזְדַּהַמְנָא בְּאַפֵּי גַּבְרַאי״.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Yosef also thought to say: Nursing the child of a gentile woman in exchange for payment is permitted due to enmity. Abaye said to him: The concern of enmity does not apply, because she can say, if she is unmarried: I wish to get married. And if she is a married woman, she may say: I do not wish to become repulsive to my husband. Since she can provide a reasonable excuse for refusing to nurse a gentile child, the concern of enmity does not apply.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, a woman who can nurse, and perhaps has functioned as a wetnurse in the past, is approached to be employed by a gentile woman. This is targeting women who can nurse, not all women in the world. Abaye explains how there would be no enmity caused by refusal, because of a credible excuse. For those women who are not married, they would say X; for those who are married, they would say Y.</p>\n<p>So yes, we would read the gemara in a way that conforms to reality, that there are some unmarried women who are wetnurses. That could arise due to out-of-wedlock pregnancies, or a woman who was divorced or widowed. Indeed, this newfound singlehood might have not even occurred recently, as a wetnurse who continues in the profession without pause can do so for years. Abaye said this to comprehensively cover all cases, so that there is no enmity in a subset of cases.</p>\n\n\n",

And Samson said to his father: Get her for me; for she is pleasant in my eyes” (Judges 14:3). Therefore, the Philistines gouged out his eyes, as it is stated: “And the Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes” (Judges 16:21).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Thus, Samson is already guilty of following his eyes at the moment he said she was pleasing even though the story has not yet described him as coming to that realization himself.</em></p>\n<p>The Talmud thus finds him guilty of following his eyes from the get-go (the first mention in the Psukim).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִינִי? וְהָכְתִיב: ״וְאָבִיו וְאִמּוֹ לֹא יָדְעוּ כִּי מֵה׳ הִיא״. כִּי אֲזַל מִיהָא — בָּתַר יַשְׁרוּתֵיהּ אֲזַל.<br />\nThe Gemara asks: Is that so? But isn’t it written: “But his father and his mother knew not that it was from the Lord; as he sought a subterfuge against the Philistines” (Judges 14:4), indicating that Samson’s searching for a Philistine wife was due to a Divine mission? The Gemara answers: Although God did plan the punishment of the Philistines, in any event when he went, he followed his inclination and did not act for the sake of Heaven.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why is he characterized as following his eyes before being described as finding her pleasing in his eyes?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why EXACTLY did Moshe make a copper snake?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/torahreading.asp?tdate=7/3/2025\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parshas Chukas, 5th reading</a>, it discusses how Hashem sent snakes on the Jewish people, after they spoke out again Hashem and Moshe, because the snake, who was punished for not being able to speak at all anymore, is taking vengeance on the people who complained with their language etc, as Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6 G-d sent the venomous snakes against the people, and they bit the\npeople, and many Israelites died.     ו וַיְשַׁלַּ֨ח יְהֹוָ֜ה בָּעָ֗ם\nאֵ֚ת הַנְּחָשִׁ֣ים הַשְּׂרָפִ֔ים וַיְנַשְּׁכ֖וּ אֶת־הָעָ֑ם וַיָּ֥מָת\nעַם־רָ֖ב מִיִּשְׂרָאֵֽל: אֵת הַנְּחָשִׁים הַשְּׂרָפִים - The venomous\nsnakes - i.e., that burn (שׂוֹרְפִים) a person with the poison of\ntheir teeth.       אֵת הַנְּחָשִׁים הַשְּׂרָפִים.  שֶׁשּׂוֹרְפִים אֶת\nהָאָדָם בְּאֶרֶס שִׁנֵּיהֶם: וַיְנַשְּׁכוּ אֵת הָעָם - And they bit\nthe people. Let the snake, who was punished for slander, come and\nexact punishment from these people who slander; let the snake, to whom\nall types of food taste the same, come and exact punishment from\nungrateful people for whom one thing (the manna) can have several\nvarying tastes.    וַ יְנַשְּׁכוּ אֵת הָעָם.  יָבֹא נָחָשׁ שֶׁלָּקָה\nעַל הוֹצָאַת דִּבָּה וְיִפָּרַע מִמּוֹצִיאֵי דִּבָּה, יָבֹא נָחָשׁ\nשֶׁכָּל הַמִּינִין נִטְעָמִין לוֹ טַעַם אֶחָד וְיִפָּרַע מִכְּפוּיֵי\nטוֹבָה שֶׁדָּבָר אֶחָד מִשְׁתַּנֶּה לָהֶם לְכַמָּה מַטְעַמִּים\n(תנחומא):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But then, when they're being healed, Hashem told Moshe to make a snake model (without specific the material), and Moshe on his own decided to make it out of copper (נחשת), because \"it's a language falling on a language\" (i.e., it's a submission language to נחש, snake):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>9 Moses made a copper snake and put it on a pole. If a snake had\nbitten a person and he looked toward the copper snake, he lived.      ט\nוַיַּ֤עַשׂ משֶׁה֙ נְחַ֣שׁ נְח֔שֶׁת וַיְשִׂמֵ֖הוּ עַל־הַנֵּ֑ס וְהָיָ֗ה\nאִם־נָשַׁ֤ךְ הַנָּחָשׁ֙ אֶת־אִ֔ישׁ וְהִבִּ֛יט אֶל־נְחַ֥שׁ הַנְּח֖שֶׁת\nוָחָֽי: נְחַשׁ נְחשֶׁת - A copper snake. He was not told to make it\nfrom copper. However, Moses said: “The Holy One, blessed be He, calls\nit נָחָשׁ, and I will make it from copper (נְחֹשֶׁת), since they are\nsimilar words.”    נְחַשׁ נְחשֶׁת.  לֹא נֶאֱמַר לוֹ לַעֲשׂוֹתוֹ שֶׁל\nנְחֹשֶׁת, אֶלָּא אָמַר מֹשֶׁה, הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא קוֹרְאוֹ\nנָחָשׁ וַאֲנִי אֶעֱשֶׂנּוּ שֶׁל נְחֹשֶׁת, לָשׁוֹן נוֹפֵל עַל לָשׁוֹן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I was thinking about the two comments, and it seems it had <em>something</em> to do with fixing the mistake of the Jewish people regarding their language, that somehow through making this copper snake which has a \"language falling on a language\", that could rectify the negative language they spoke.</p>\n<p>But how exactly? What is the explanation for why specifically a copper snake would fix this sin? And why did Moshe decide on his own to make it out of copper, when apparently based only on what Hashem told him, it may have been enough to just use any material for the snake?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.21.9?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban on Bereshis 21:9</a> is not satisfied with Rashi and offers his take. The punchline is the last two paragraphs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND MOSES MADE ‘NECHASH NECHOSHETH’ (A SERPENT OF BRASS). “He was not told to make it of brass. But Moses said: ‘The Holy One, blessed be He, called it a nachash (serpent); therefore I will make it of nechosheth (brass) — since the one word resembles the other [in sound].” This is Rashi’s language, based upon the words of our Rabbis. (Bereshith Rabbah 31:8).</p>\n<p>But I do not understand this, for the Holy One, blessed be He, did not mention to Moses [the word] nachash, but said to him, Make thee ‘saraf’ (a fiery serpent)! (Bamidbar 21:8). But the intention of the Sages is that Moses was guided by the substantive name thereof [which is nachash; and saraf is merely a particular description of a certain kind of serpent — a “fiery” serpent — hence he made the saraf which G-d mentioned to him from nechosheth (brass), corresponding with its substantive name].</p>\n<p>It appears to me that the secret of this matter is that this is one of the ways of the Torah, every deed of which is a miracle within a miracle. Thus [the Torah] removes injury by means of the cause of the injury, and heals illness by means of the cause of the sickness, as the Rabbis have mentioned in connection with [the verse], and the Eternal showed him a tree (Exodus 15:25),  and as occurred with the salt that Elisha [cast] into the water. (II Kings 2:21).</p>\n<p>Now it is a well-known medical principle that all people bitten by poisonous creatures become dangerously ill when they see them, or [even] when they [only] see their likeness, so that if people who have been bitten by a mad dog or other mad animals look into water (“or any mirror.”), they see there the image of the dog or the attacker, and [this] can [cause them to] die, as is written in medical books and mentioned in the Gemara of Tractate Yoma, daf 84a. Similarly doctors protect them from [people] mentioning in their presence the name of the animal that bit them, [and they forbid people] to mention it at all, because their minds cling to this thought and do not turn away from it altogether until it causes their death.</p>\n<p>[The doctors] have already mentioned that it is an empirical fact, amongst the wonders of reproduction, that if the urine of a person bitten by a mad dog is put in a glass receptacle after he has become rabidly sick, there will appear in that urine the likeness of the young of small dogs. And if you pass the liquid through a cloth and filter it, you will not find any trace of them at all; but if you return the liquid to the glass bottle, and it remains there for about an hour, you will again clearly see in it the small dogs. This is a true fact, and of the wonders of the powers of the soul.</p>\n<p>Now in view of all this, it would have been correct that the Israelites, who had been bitten by the fiery serpents, should not look upon a serpent, and should not mention it or bring it to mind at all. But the Holy One, blessed be He, commanded Moses to make for them <strong>the likeness of a fiery serpent, which was [the creature] that killed them. And it is well-known that these fiery serpents have red eyes and wide heads, and their bodies at their necks are like brass</strong>. Therefore Moses could not fulfill His command to make a fiery serpent except by making a serpent of brass, which appears similar to a fiery serpent. For had he made it of any other material, it would have had the likeness of a serpent, but not that of a saraf (a fiery serpent). And the Rabbis (Bereshith Rabbah 31:8) who said [that Moses was to make a brass serpent] because “one word corresponds [in sound] to the other,” [meant to imply] that the mere mention of the name [saraf, which is a particular form of nachash, as explained above] was harmful [for the people who had been bitten, and yet G-d wanted to heal them through it].</p>\n<p>The general intention [of this section, then] is that G-d commanded that they should be healed by the harmful agent whose nature is to kill; therefore they made its likeness in form and name, and when a person concentrated his gaze upon the brass serpent which resembled totally the offending agent, he lived. This was to make them realize that it is G-d [alone] Who sendeth death and maketh alive. (I Samuel 2:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A couple of answers...</p>\n<p>First note the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sforno_on_Numbers.21.9.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> - The copper colour induced remorse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נחש נחשת. אחר שהבין כונת קונו הסכים לעשותו של נחשת ולא של זהב כדי שיזכיר להם עונם מצד מראה החומר ושמו ותבניתו שעשו מעשה הנחש בהבל פיהם בדברם נגד ה' ונגד פעלו ונגד עבדו</p>\n<p>נחש נחושת - After Moshe had understood what G-d had intended with His command, he agreed to make this replica of a snake out of copper and not out of gold. Copper would be more likely to induce thoughts of remorse as they would associate its colour with the sensation of burning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Numbers.21.9.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> - It served a functional purpose i.e.copper when shiny is highly visible</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נחש נחשת לפי שהנחושת מבהיק ומבריק כענין שנאמר ונוצצים כעין נחשת קלל ואע״‎פ שמחנה ישראל היה שלש פרסאות על שלש פרסאות מי שהיה נשוך רואהו ממקומו.</p>\n<p>נחש נחשת -  “A copper snake.” This metal was chosen, as, when polished, it shines and reflects light and therefore is highly visible. We know this from Ezekiel 1,7, where the prophet describes his vision of angels whose hooflike feet were described as sparkling like burnished copper. Even though the area of the Israelites camp was three miles square, anyone who had been bitten by a snake could see the copper snake that Moses had mounted on a pole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I posted a link to the maamar in Likkutei Torah above under a comment to the original question. I will summarize the maamar here to the best of my ability bez’H:</p>\n<p>ויעש משה נחש נחשת To which the alter rebbe first brings the Mishnah from Rosh hashana “was it the snake that gave life or the opposite? Rather, as long as bnei Yisrael looked above and subjugated their hearts to their father in heaven…etc. על זה בזמן שישראל מסתכלין כלפי מעלה ומשעבדין את לבם לאביהם שבשמים כו׳</p>\n<p>The alter rebbe immediately asks two questions on this Mishnah. 1) if bnei Yisrael only needed to look above, why a snake? Seemingly it would have sufficed to just put a sign on a pole that says “look up”. 2) there is a Gemara in yevamos that specifically states when a person davens he should put his eyes towards the eretz and his heart towards shamayim, seemingly contradicting our Mishnah that says they should look <strong>up</strong> and pray.</p>\n<p>The alter rebbe begins by explaining the entire tachlis the neshama descends into a guf is to cleave to Hashem with Ahavah and yirah because this reaches the depths of a person more than machshava dibur or masseh expressed when fulfilling 613 mitzvos (which are considered levushim for the neshama). And we know, tefilah is avodah sheba lev. So therefore it follows the entire purpose of the neshama to come down into this world is for tefilah.</p>\n<p>This answer seemingly doesn’t make sense though because before the neshama descends, it experiences infinitely greater revelation of G-dliness in the higher realms, and therefore the love and awe it feels are also infinitely higher! (Additionally during the times of the first and second Beis Hamikdash there was very little tefilah compared to what we have today-partially due to the fact tefilah is substituting for korbanos during golus). So how did they fulfill the their purpose of descending into this world ?</p>\n<p>To this, the alter rebbe brings a Zohar that says “any person who does not transform the bitter into sweet does not have a portion in olam haba, for this is the entire purpose of creating man”.\nThe alter rebbe explains turning bitter to sweet is “sweetening the dinim at their source”. What does that mean…?</p>\n<p>The alter rebbe first begins by explaining everything’s source is hashem. Even things that appear bad in this world such as suffering or the like (rachmana litzlan) all have their source in hashem. It’s just when they come down through the hishtalshelus the light and goodness becomes concealed and hidden. In this way, our rabbis zl explained the term “meod” in “very good” that was said after the 6 days of creation as the malach hamaves and the yezter hara.\nThe alter rebbe brings the mashal of the zonah hired by the king to tempt the prince. It is only to elevate the prince by revealing his inner qualities and strengths. That’s the entire purpose of a test is to elevate a person to a higher level. And the harlot who is attempting to seduce the prince is actually working for the king! Not only that, but <strong>she also</strong> wants to fail and the prince to succeed knowing how much pleasure this is going to give the king.</p>\n<p>And this is sweetening the judgements: to understand everything that happens is hashgacha pratis and its source is good. Specifically, when a person takes this to heart the judgment itself actually changes. It’s not that the person’s perspective changed and so now the situation is good according to his new view, but the <em>situation itself</em> changes and becomes good.</p>\n<p>This is most famously highlighted with the stories of nachman ish gam zu, who <strong>saw</strong> everything as good. Not that it <em>would</em> be good at some future time, but that it was <strong>currently</strong> good. (“Zu”=“this” denotes something physically in front of the observer that he can point to).  And this in turn actually transformed the current reality (As evidenced by the fact that the dirt in the chest literally changed into the dirt of Avraham etc. see Gemara there)</p>\n<p>So that was the message of the snake, it’s not that the snakes were bad, they were merely a conduit for building a deeper and stronger connection with Hashem. And they were sent from Hashem. And bnei Yisrael needed to <strong>look</strong> and see, <em>this</em> itself was actually good. And once they internalized this, the “bad” literally become the source of “life” and healing.</p>\n<p>As for the reason they were made out of copper, the alter rebbe says from the Gemara regarding the doors of nikanor (see Yoma) “that they were the only thing in the Beis Hamikdash that was not replaced with gold. And some say they shone even more brilliantly than gold.”\nCopper changes color when hit by the sun. So too do our challenges and struggles change from sorrows rachmana litzlan to newfound levels of divine connection and blessings when we connect with The Source.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Not believing in G-d - Jews in the Desert\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am a little bit confused on how to understand the disbelief of the Jews in the desert, and it is somewhat difficult to phrase my question.</p>\n<p>How is it possible to not believe in G-d when the Jews saw all these many miracles in Egypt: the giving of the Torah, the filling of the Mishkan with G-d's Shekhina etc.?</p>\n<p>Trying to answer my question, I could say that they might have believed that the miracles were done by Moshe, Aaron and Miriam. They could not see beyond! However, I would accept that once but not so many times.\nThis rebelliousness prevailed all along.</p>\n<p>How come then it is so \"easy\" to believe in G-d today, when we no longer witness unnatural miracles but back then, when people saw all these miracles and signs and so on, derailed so easily</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A very thoughtful question! The Midrashim go at length to explain how the overwhelming majority of Jews did not participate in the sin of the Golden Calf, and the ones that did still believed in God, they just thought that they needed an intermediary in order to receive His blessings and guidance. Even the Eruv Rav - the Egyptian converts who started the whole matter, believed in God, but they also believed in other gods too.</p>\n<p>The Midrashim, as usual, base on this on a close reading of the verses, rather than mere apologetics, and in this case, it's very easy to see when you know  where to look. In order to see this methodically laid out, I recommend <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7xDCRw7VIo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a> by Rabbi Dovid Gottleib. I will also share a Drasha that I wrote, based on it, for Parashat Ki Tisa, especially because it also deals with Bitachon, one of your tags:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There are two ways to hide a diamond. One is to hide it, and one is to\nbury it among  mundane items, like toy diamonds. In the case of the\nChet HaEgel, the general flow of the story seems like the Jewish\npeople bowed down to an idol, right after Har Sinai, and everyone\nfocuses on that. However, the truth of the story is that only a few\nactually bowed down to the idol, a tiny tiny minority, probably just\nthe Eruv Rav, and the rest of the 3 million Jewish people were doing\nsomething else…, and if we look closely at the pasukim, we can see it,\nwithout needing to look at Drash, Remez or Kabbalah.</p>\n<p>Look at the language carefully: <em>“The people saw that Moshe delayed in\ndescending the mountain, and they gathered around Aaron and said,\n‘Rise up, make for us gods that will go before us, because this man\nMoshe who brought us up from Egypt—we don’t know what happened to\nhim.’”</em> (Shemot 32:1). The problem begins not with a desire to abandon\nHashem, but with confusion and fear over Moshe’s absence. They weren’t\nlooking for a new god—they were looking for guidance, for something\ntangible to take Moshe’s place.</p>\n<p>Even more striking is Aaron’s response. After making the calf, the\npeople say, <em>“These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from\nthe land of Egypt.”</em> (32:4). But Aaron immediately declares,\n<em>“Tomorrow will be a festival for Hashem.”</em> (32:5). If this was outright idol worship, why would Aaron sanctify it in Hashem's name?\nClearly, the calf was never meant to replace Hashem for the vast\nmajority of the 3 million Jews (as only 10,000 total ended up dying\nafterwards)—it was meant to replace Moshe to connect them to Hashem.</p>\n<p>So, everyone thinks that the main message of Ki Tisa is how bad the\nJews were, but that’s not true. The real message is the ending of the\nstory. Hashem said to Moshe וְשָׁלַחְתִּי לְפָנֶיךָ מַלְאָךְ … and\nwhen Moshe told Benei Yisrael this, וַיִּשְׁמַע הָעָם אֶת־הַדָּבָר\nהָרָע הַזֶּה וַיִּתְאַבָּלוּ וְלֹא־שָׁתוּ אִישׁ עֶדְיוֹ עָלָיו. Moshe\nsaid to Hashem אִם־אֵין פָּנֶיךָ הֹלְכִים אַל־תַּעֲלֵנוּ מִזֶּה, and\nthen וַיֹּאמֶר ה' אֶל־מֹשֶׁה גַּם אֶת־הַדָּבָר הַזֶּה\nאֲשֶׁר־דִּבַּרְתָּ אֶעֱשֶׂה כִּי־מָצָאתָ חֵן בְּעֵינַי וָאֵדָעֲךָ\nבְשֵׁם.</p>\n<p>So, what was the sin? The sin was a sin of Bitachon. This one sin is\nsomething even the greatest of the greats failed in – such as Yaakov\npreparing gifts for Esav and bowing to him. It came from a place of\nhumility – we felt we didn’t deserve Hashem. Hashem held that against\nus – nobody wants a friend, or a spouse, who is constantly feeling\nunworthy, not believing your promises to love them and look after\nthem!</p>\n<p>So let’s discuss some halachot about Bitachon for the remainder of the\nDvar Torah, to help us do teshuva for the Chet Ha’egel and bring\nMoshiach!</p>\n<p>People are very confused about Bitachon. There’s always an argument –\nsomeone says “just trust in Hashem” and someone retorts “but you have\nto make a hishtadlut!”, and the first person says “but it’s a mitzva\nto put our trust in Hashem, don’t you know the story of the man who\nsold his donkey and became a millionaire?” and the other person says\n“don’t YOU know the story of the person who’s child was sick, and he\ndidn’t take them to the doctor and they died!”.</p>\n<p>This is actually a battle between someone whose soul is rooted in\nChesed, vs someone whose soul is rooted in Gevura. What is the answer\nto this puzzle? Well, it’s actually quite simple – we have a mitzva to\nmake hishtadlut, but we are also commanded to realise that we are only\ndoing that hishatdlut because Hashem commanded us to, not because we\nbelieve that hishtadlut has any power on its own. It doesn’t – we have\nto keep in mind that the blessing and success comes only from Hashem.\nThis is why the Tzemach Tzeddek in Derech Mitzvotecha says that when\nit comes to hishtadlut, we are not allowed to make even one extra drop\nof effort more than required. If we need £5000 to get through the\nmonth, we must calculate exactly how much effort it takes to earn\nthat, and then do that effort and no more.</p>\n<p>So, why does Hashem want us to make effort? There are many reasons for\nthis, but to cut to the chase, His blessings for us are so lofty, that\nthey mamash do not fit into nature. They descend from the highest of\nheavens down to the level of Gan Eden, but to make the leap to the\nphysical world, they need a vessel to be made by our own efforts. If\nthey were to come any other way, the miracles would disrupt Hashem’s\nplan for a natural world. This is of course possible, but requires a\nhuge zechus. Therefore, we need to partner with Hashem, and through\nour efforts, especially our efforts in tefilla, we enable the\nblessings to come down through non-miraculous means.</p>\n<p>This helps explain another halacha about Bitachon – the more bitachon\nwe have, the less effort we need to put in. This is what Rabbeinu\nOvadia wrote in Etz Anaf Avot – he brought a story from the Chafetz\nChaim, when people were being drafted for the army they came to him to\nask what to do. The Chafetz Chaim reminded them about what it says in\nAvot: whoever accepts upon himself the yoke of Torah, the yoke of\ngovernment will be removed from him. Rav Ovadia asks: how then so many\nyeshiva students are being drafted and he said that the heavenly court\ndeals with people measure for measure – if they dedicated themselves\nto their Torah study with strength and unwavering commitment, without\nbeing interrupted, the yoke of government is removed completely. If\nthey are lazy and undedicated, their acceptance of the yoke of Torah\nis weak and so the removal of the yoke of government is also weak.</p>\n<p>So yes, indeed the greatest tzaddikim do indeed not have to put in any\neffort and can sit back and do nothing and Hashem will bless them,\nalthough this is something only one in a million can achieve. Anyone\nelse who does this will be punished for it. The blessings that Hashem\nsent for them will remain for their soul in Gan Eden, but they will\ncause sorrow down here on earth due to not bringing the blessings down\nto where they were meant to go!</p>\n<p>So, yes, we are all meant to engage in effort. We are meant to take\nout life insurance, go to the doctor when we are sick, teach our\nchildren a trade, and ourselves work, and not sit back and learn Torah\nand hope for the best. We must also make sure to put in all our effort\nto help our friends when they are in need and not lecture them about\nhaving bitachon. However, we must always work on our bitachon, never\nletting our work and efforts overshadow our Torah learning, and always\nremember that it is Hashem who sends the blessings and He can and will\ngive us a good life if only we trust in Him with all our hearts.\nEmunah means everything is ultimately for the good, but bitachon means\nthat we can trust that Hashem will make it good and sweet, and our\nprayers will come true in a way that we can visibly and tangibly see.\nWe must remain optimistic at all times, even in the face of trouble,\nand certainly never panic and rush to a decision like Benei Yisrael\ndid with the Egel!</p>\n<p>The point of bitachon is to give us a life free of worry and anxiety,\na life of tranquillity and peace. Shaar Habitachon says that anyone\ncan have an easy life – one where we don’t have to work very much, and\nhave a tranquil life of peace, serenity, with our families, and have\nour dreams come true – if only we have bitachon! The only thing\nstopping us from having all this is lack of bitachon. This comes from\nlove and fear of Hashem; indeed as we saw with Benei Yisrael, bitachon\nis the essential ingredient for a good relationship,  most of all our\nrelationship with Hashem – He promised to look after us, and bless us,\nand never abandon us – why do we doubt him?! We shouldn’t, we should\nbe glad that He is our God and He is looking after us at all times,\nand love Him for it, and our bitachon will increase and we will not\nneed anyone else, not even a malach.</p>\n<p>We only want You Hashem! Shabbat Shalom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I heard a very beautiful answer that also relates to a well known story in the psychology field called “the marshmallow test”.

That part is nogea to our question here.</p>\n<p>Bnei Yisroel were in mitzrayim for a couple hundred years (210) and were steeped in a culture who worshiped nature. Everything about the Egyptian society and religion was centered around nature being divine (sun god, moon god, river god, wind god, etc). And this is why pharaoh specifically said “וַיֹּאמֶר פַּרְעֹה מִי ה” using the name Havaya (denoting above nature and time [hayah, hoveh, yihyeh]) and they were  so concerned with proving the makos were a “natural” phenomenon (“this is the finger of Elokim”- elokim genatria hateva). This is the society and influence bnei Yisroel were subjected to.</p>\n<p>So what did Hashem do? He sent signs and wonders and miracles to destroy and break this false paradigm. The issue was bnei Yisroel had trust issues due to their abuse over the generations. So Hashem had to show them. And show them again. And again. Like a parent that has to keep reaffirming their support and love and dependability to a damaged child who grew up in an unhealthy environment.</p>\n<p>Just as a side note, we are still in golus and G-d forbid it should last another second, but I think most people (especially myself) still struggle with this. How much importance do we place on “nature” and what is “likely” to occur? How many of us can confidently walk as nachum ish gam zu and declare “gam zu letovah” for everything we encounter in this world? Being “in mitzrayim” is just as much a physical golus as a spiritual golus. And for that, Hashem is constantly and continuously creating miracles for us every second of every day and we still struggle with trust. The story of yetzias mitzrayim is just as relevant today as it was in the year 2448</p>\n\n\n",

Pulling out some of the relevant halachic opinions from it, because it is rather lengthy!</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Opinions against:</h2>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Yehudah He-Hasid</strong> (c. 1150 - 1217) wrote, “In the case of a hymn\ncomposed by a priest for worship in a non-Jewish service, even if a Jew\nconsiders it to be a beautiful form of praise, he should not chant it to God\nin Hebrew.”</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Yehudah Al-Harizi</strong> (c. 1170-1235) wrote of his visit to a Baghdad\nsynagogue in 1220: “The cantors don’t understand the words, and the people\nhave no idea what they are saying. And instead of the holy (k’doshim) songs\nof [King] David, they sing the songs of prostitutes (k’deishim).”</p>\n<p>In the Shulhan arukh, <strong>Rabbi Joseph Caro</strong> (1488-1575) wrote, “If a sh’liah\ntsibbur sings using gentile melodies, you should protest that he should not\ndo such a thing. And if he doesn’t listen, you should remove him.”</p>\n<p>The Italian <strong>Rabbi Samuel ben Elhanan Archivolti</strong> (1515-1611) wrote, “What\ncan we say? How can we justify the actions of a few hazzanim of our day, who\nchant the holy prayers to the tunes of popular secular songs? While reading\nsacred texts they are thinking of obscenities and lewd things.”</p>\n<p>In 1605 <strong>Rabbi Ben Zion Sarfati</strong> (d. 1610) wrote that in his youth in the\nsynagogue of Padua, Italy, his choir “used to sing the whole order of K’dushah\nat the request of [Rabbi Meir]. Certainly it was not worse, indeed better than\nthe those who raised their voices against us, singing [the K’dushah to the\ntunes of] the vulgar songs that are sung outdoors in the streets.”</p>\n<p>In his Shirei y’hudah published in Amsterdam in 1696, <strong>Rabbi Y’hudah\nLeib Zelichower</strong> (d. 1709) wrote,\nBut now, in this generation… they know not, they do not understand,\nthey walk in darkness, they abandon the ancient melodies and toss them\nbehind their backs, they laugh and make fun of them saying, “that’s old\nstuﬀ, and we get no pleasure from them,” and they fabricate new melodies\nto take their place, either [melodies] of their own, or they borrow them from their theaters and bring them into God’s Temple, and they sound\nlike the melodies that go with mixed dancing. And there are even some\nof them who learn melodies from the uncircumcised… and sing them in\nour synagogues. Have you ever heard of such evil? Could God desire this\nkind of song and music?</p>\n<p>In an anonymous pamphlet entitled <strong>Tokhehah m’gulah</strong> (Open Demands),\nwritten in Styria (now Austria) in the seventeenth century, we find several\ncomplaints lodged against hazzanim, including, “If you become used to\nforeign melodies, you will manage to destroy the proper kavvanah. And\nthe listeners are focused on the melodies to such an extent that even Torah\nscholars haven’t a clue how to concentrate and achieve kavvanah. What happens is that people become used to going to the synagogue [merely] to listen\nto pleasant singing.”</p>\n<p><strong>Moshe Vital</strong>, a well-known Sephardic cantor in Jerusalem in the early twentieth century wrote, “For artistic and theological reasons a Sephardic cantor is\nforbidden to introduce secular songs into the synagogue… Sometimes one of\nour cantors works also as a secular singer who entertains others with secular\nsongs, and it is quite common to hear from his mouth the melody of a love\nsong merged with sections of prayers, such as a Kaddish or a K’dushah… But\nhe should allow himself to do this only if the melody is not recognizable to\nthe congregation.”</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Opinions for:</h2>\n<p>Yet not all opinions have been against contrafaction. Some rabbis entertained a more positive view. Some expressed the hope that using melodies\nthat people already knew and loved would encourage greater participation\nin the worship service. Others subscribed to the Kabbalistic idea that there\nis a spark of holiness in even the most degraded objects, and that it is a great mitzvah to rescue these sparks and redeem them into the service of the Holy One.</p>\n<p>In the sixteenth century, <strong>Rabbi Israel Najara</strong> (c. 1555–c. 1625) wrote He-\nbrew sacred lyrics to be sung to melodies of then-popular Arab and Turkish\nsongs. His intention was to distract young people from the secular world,\nallowing them to sing their favorite tunes, but with new, uplifting lyrics. “The mouths of liars and the singing of sensual songs will be blocked, and they will no longer think about love songs when they see [my] songs.”</p>\n<p>Mizrahi (Eastern) Jews, in particular Syrians, continue the practice of\ncontrafaction in their pizmonim. The Syrian payy’tan <strong>Raphael Isaac Antibi</strong>\ndefended this practice, citing the Kabbalistic interpretation.\nA melody is a holy spark. When you play love songs the spark is hidden\nin its shell. Therefore in every new melody that the gentiles compose\nyou must establish words from the scribes, words of holiness, in order to\nextract the spark from the “other side” [i.e. Satan] to the side of holiness.\nAnd this is an obligation no less than preventing sinners from sinning,\ncausing many people to turn from sin, to extract that which is precious\nfrom that which is evil, to choose the sparks of holiness.</p>\n<p><strong>Rabbi Israel Moshe Hazzan</strong> (1808-1862), who served in Jerusalem’s High\nReligious Court, defended the practice of borrowing a beautiful melody that\nhad been used in non-Jewish worship.\nAnd I testify by heaven and earth that when I was in Smyrna, the great\ncity of scholars and mystics, I saw some of the outstanding religious\nauthorities who were also great creators of the science of music, headed\nby the wonderful Rabbi Abraham Ha-Kohein Ariash of blessed memory,\nwho secretly used to go (behind the screen) of the Christian church on\ntheir holy days to learn the special melodies from them and to adapt them\nto the High Holiday prayers which require great humility. And from those\nsame melodies they would arrange the most remarkable blessings and\nholy prayers, and it is clear from this that the tune is not of the essence,\nbut the sacred words.</p>\n<p><strong>Jacob S. Kassin</strong> (1900-1994), Chief Rabbi of the Syrian Community of New\nYork, echoed this sentiment.\n[Borrowing melodies and providing them with new, sacred Hebrew texts\nis done for a] good reason, a reason of fundamental importance, and it\nis correct that it is said about it “that it is good.” This is so because the\nmelody is a holy spark. Because when one plays sensual love songs, the\nspark is submerged in the k’lippot [waste coverings]. It is for this reason\nthat it is necessary to establish a foundation of holy words—drawn from\nthe mouths of scholars and from the mouths of books—for any tune with\na non-Jewish source, in order to lead the spark from the realm of evil to\nthe realm of holiness. This is an obligation in the same way that it is an\nobligation to draw sinners to good, to turn away from iniquity, and to bring\nout the precious from the vile. It is an obligation to make clear the holy sparks. So it is with holy songs. The holy sparks bring light to the just.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Those who say that it is assur to use a tune that is used for avodah zara:</strong></p>\n<p>The Magen Avraham Orach Chaim Siman 53:31 quoting the Sefer Chasidim Siman 238 says any melody that is played in front of idolatry should not be used as a melody for Hashem.\nMishneh Berurah in Chaim Siman 53:82 quoting the Bach Siman 127 says that the issur applies only to those specific melodies that are uniquely designated for avodah zara.\nKaf Hachaim in Orach Chaim Siman 53:115 quotes all the above sources as well.\nShu\"t Yabia Omer Orach Chaim 6:7 in the first few paragraphs implies that it's assur.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%91%D7%9C_%D7%A0%D7%97%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95_%D7%98_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חבל נחלתו ט:ה</a> for a full discussion with many sources.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Bach (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Teshuvot_Bayit_Chadash%2C_HaYeshanot.127.7?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">responsum 127</a>) forbids repurposing a tune that is uniquely associated with idolatry. On the other hand, if it is merely used in an idolatrous ritual, without being identified with idolatry, he permits it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[השמטה: מה שמזמרי' בבתי כנסיות בניגוני' שמזמרי' בהם בבית תפלתם. נראה שאין אוסר אלא דווקא באותן ניגונים שהם מיוחדי' להעכ\"ם מאחר שהוא חוק לע\"ז כמו מצבה שאסורה בכל מקום מפני שעשאוה כנעני' חוק לע\"ז. ואין ראי' להתיר גם את זה מהא דתנן בפ' ד' מיתות מצות הנהרגי' היו מתיזי' כו' ע\"ש ובגמר' תנינא א\"ל ר' יהודא לחכמים אף אני יודע שמיתה מנוולת היא ע\"ש וא\"כ איכא למימר ה\"נ בניגוני' דלאו מינייהו קא גמרי אלא ע\"י חכמת המוסקי' דאין לומר להחמיר כר' יודא דלית ליה סברא זו דהא כבר פסקו הפוסקים הלכה כרבנן מ\"מ נראה דאין ראי' מכאן לפי מ\"ש התוספות וז\"ל תימא דמשמע הכא דאע\"ג דחוקה היא כיון דכתיב ק' כו' ע\"ש אלמא דאפילו כתוב באורייתא לא מהני כשנעשה חוק לע\"ז. כ\"ש באותן ניגוני' אבל אם אינם מיוחדי' נראה דאין בזה איסור דבהא ודאי איכא למימר דלא מינייהו גמרינן:]</p>\n<p>Omission: regarding what is sung in synagogues using the melodies that are sung in their (non-Jewish) house of worship.\nIt appears that the prohibition applies only to those specific melodies that are uniquely designated for the gentiles, since this constitutes a ḥoq (a fixed custom or statute) of idolatry—just as a matzevah (sacred pillar) is forbidden everywhere, because the Canaanites established it as an idolatrous practice.\nAnd there is no proof to permit even these melodies from the case taught in the chapter \"Four Types of Capital Punishment\" [Sanhedrin], regarding the execution method of beheading, where the Mishnah states: “The prescribed method for those executed by the sword was decapitation,” etc. And in the Gemara, Rabbi Yehuda says to the Sages, “I too know that it is a degrading death,” etc.\nThus, one could argue similarly here: that in the case of the melodies, we are not learning from the gentiles themselves, but rather through the musical knowledge of experts.\nAnd one should not claim that we must be stringent in accordance with Rabbi Yehuda’s position, for his reasoning was not accepted—since the halakhic authorities have already ruled that the law follows the Sages.\nNonetheless, there is no proof from that case (of execution) to our issue, in light of what Tosafot writes, and I quote:\n“It is difficult, for it seems from here that even though it is a ḥoq, since it is written in the Torah…” etc. (see there).\nFrom this it emerges that even if something is written in the Torah, it does not help if it has already become an idolatrous custom.\nAll the more so, then, regarding those melodies that are uniquely identified with idolatrous worship.\nHowever, if the melodies are not uniquely associated [with idolatry], then it would seem there is no prohibition.\nFor in that case, one can certainly say that we are not deriving from them (the gentiles).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Hashem allots a certain number of years to each person.</p>\n<p>How can someone’s prayer shorten someone else’s lifespan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I love this story. Most, if not ALL, scholars misunderstand it, focusing on \"Not in heaven\" as the Talmudic Asmachta for breaking out of existing tradition.</p>\n<p>In reality, the whole story is about the respect one should pay to the sages and the heavy price one pays for disrespecting them.</p>\n<p>To take the story of Akhnai in the proper context, one should start with a list of sayings that precede it on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.59a.7?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">59a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Rav Hisda says: All the gates of Heaven are apt to be locked, <strong>except for the gates of prayer for victims of verbal mistreatment</strong>\"<br />\n\"Rabbi Abbahu says: There are three sins before whose transgressors the curtain [hapargod] between the world and the Divine Presence is not locked; their sins reach the Divine Presence. They are: <strong>Verbal mistreatment</strong>, robbery, and idol worship...\"\n\"And Rabbi Ḥelbo says: A person must always be careful about <strong>sustaining the honor of his wife</strong>, as a blessing is found in a person’s house only because of his wife.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And check out the statement that immediately follows the story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\" The Sages taught: One who <strong>verbally mistreats</strong> the convert violates three prohibitions.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> As you can see, our story is set within the discussion of \"verbal mistreatment\"; therefore, we can conclude that R\"G's indirect insult of R\"E through the Herem and his resulting death demonstrate the severity of the disgrace of Talmidey Chachamim.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Rosh_Hashanah.2.9?ven=hebrew%7CTorat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashana Mishna 2.9</a>, we encounter <strong>R\"G's</strong> [somewhat undemocratic] <strong>attempt to establish his political authority over more prominent sages</strong> (R\"Y here). As the Gemmora explicates, that move was mandated, as the survival of the sages and the tradition depended on cooperation and adaptation to the Roman rulership. E.g., it says that the sages can't fix the new year until the Nassi coordinates it with the Roman authorities in Syria.</p>\n<p>Our story is the continuation and escalation of the aforementioned affair. R\"Y clearly acted under the command of R\"G to force R\"E to comply with R\"G's authority and let the latter install practices not supported by the existing tradition. To remind you that R\"E was the only sage who was mentioned as \"*one who never says things he didn't hear from his rabbis\", so he was the one who insisted on sticking to the tradition.</p>\n<p>Here are some textual clues to prove my point:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R\"E won all reasonable arguments</li>\n<li>Nobody claimed the existence of an alternative tradition</li>\n<li>There was NO voting, and \"follow the majority\" was NOT mentioned in this clash</li>\n<li>The divine voice was proven authoritative in the argument of B\"H and B\"S (Eruvin 13b): \"<em>a Divine Voice emerged and proclaimed: Both these and those are the words of the living God. However, the halakha follows the opinion of Beit Hillel</em>.\" Therefore, \"Not following divine voice\" could NOT be an existing practice.</li>\n<li>The divine voice did NOT rule a single case, but claimed that R\"E's traditional opinion should be followed EVERYWHERE!</li>\n<li>To prove his point, R\"Y stood on his feet. This is the sign of authority, not intellect. He personified R\"G's will as the Nasi.</li>\n<li>R\"Y claimed, \"Not in Heaven\". What is it? If it were an existing principle, it would be explained by reference to earlier rabbis. However, in the text, it is apologized for by a later Tanna/Amora, R' Yeremiya. Another evidence that the principle was conceived \"on the spot\".</li>\n<li>As the Gemmora continues, the court was not satisfied with the intellectual discussion, but continues to humiliate R\"E: \"<em>the Sages brought all the ritually pure items deemed pure by the ruling of Rabbi Eliezer concerning the oven and burned them in fire</em>\" - was that really necessary?</li>\n<li>Furthermore, \"... <em>the Sages reached a consensus in his regard and ostracized him</em>\". Why? Was it a Halachic or a political move? Let's see God's reaction: \"<em>[R\"E's] eyes shed tears, and as a result the entire world was afflicted: One-third of its olives were afflicted, and one-third of its wheat, and one-third of its barley. And some say that even dough kneaded in a woman’s hands spoiled. The Sages taught: <strong>There was great anger on that day</strong>, as any place that Rabbi Eliezer fixed his gaze was burned.</em>\"</li>\n<li>Why would there be divine anger if the sages were motivated purely by the desire to fulfill God's will?</li>\n<li>Wait, wasn't God pleased by the fight? Isn't He quoted saying, \"<em>My children have triumphed over Me</em>\"? Let's see who says that. It was brought, again, in the name of a later Tanna, R' Nathan. As one can notice, that later insertion does not fit the divine rage. Clearly, that was an attempt to harmonize the harsh event.</li>\n<li>R\"G knew exactly why God was angry with him when he experienced a storm. He rightfully admitted his involvement in the affair and claimed that it wasn't for his personal gain, but the necessity to revive Judaism. He wished to utilize his political authority to minimize Rabbinic disagreements, even at the price of breaking the tradition.</li>\n<li>Since the sea calmed down, we could infer that the heavens agreed with his approach. So why did he die at the end? I suggest, [probably in his briefing with R\"Y and going as far as banning R\"E], that he crossed the line of mistreating a great sage. As I mentioned above, he was already warned in the story \"Is Maariv mandatory?\". But he didn't listen.</li>\n<li>The story ends with R\"E described as being in great pain and suffering enormous humiliation. So, since the Gemmora has already established that \"<em>the gates of mistreatment are never shut</em>\", once R\"E had an opportunity to pour his soul before Heaven, his distress outweighed R\"G's honor and the latter was \"executed\".</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the moral of this story is simple - if you disrespect and disgrace a renowned sage, God takes it very personally.</p>\n\n\n",

Yellin states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אפי' עני שבישראל</strong>. שמ\"ר פ\"כ מבאן כו' אפי' עני כו' עד שיסב שכבר עשה להם הקב\"ה שנא' ויסב אלהים ומזה ראיה דלא כמ\"ש הגרע\"א בשם ס' ברית שלום לפרש דהאי אפי' עני כו'מוסב על למעלה דלא יאכל עד שתחשך אפי' עני שדרכו לאכול קודם צה\"כ דמהמדרש מוכח אלמטה קאי כמש\"ש מכאן אמרו רבותינו אפי' עני כו' וכפרש\"י והרשב\"ם:</p>\n<p><strong>Even the poor Jewish person.</strong> Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.20.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabba 20:18</a> has a drasha on the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 13:18</a> on words וַיַּסֵּ֨ב אֱלֹהִ֧ים ׀ אֶת־הָעָ֛ם כו - so G-d led the people round about, etc:</p>\n<p>מִכָּאן אָמְרוּ רַבּוֹתֵינוּ אֲפִלּוּ עָנִי שֶׁבְּיִשְׂרָאֵל לֹא יֹאכַל עַד שֶׁיֵּסֵב, שֶׁכָּךְ עָשָׂה לָהֶם הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיַּסֵּב אֱלֹהִים.</p>\n<p>from here our Rabbis said: “Even the poor of Israel may not eat until he reclines [yasev]” (Mishna Pesaḥim 10:1) as that is what the Holy One blessed be He did to them, as it is stated: “G-d led [the people] around [vayasev].”</p>\n<p>From this (midrash) we have a proof that (the <em>girsa</em> in the mishna) is not like suggested by the G\"R Akiva Eiger in the name of Sefer Bris Shalom which explains that the words \"even a poor etc.\" refers to the above that he should not start eating until it gets dark, even the poor who usually eats before <em>tzeis hakokhavim</em> (3 average stars). Because the midrash proves about (using the word שֶׁבְּיִשְׂרָאֵל) above as it states \"from here our Rabbis said: Even the poor, etc.\" and like the comment <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.18?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Chumash</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.99b.1?lang=bi&with=Rashbam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam on Pesachim 99b</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point of R. Yellin is that the halakha of הסיבה - reclining or leaning to the left at the table is derived from the drasha in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.20.18?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabba 20:18</a>, and has to mirror its language. In turn, the reason why the midrash uses the word שֶׁבְּיִשְׂרָאֵל, is because it comments on the verse that uses the word הָעָ֛ם - the nation (with definite article the), which refers to the nation of Israel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>On a personal note, on many occasions I heard the explanation that eating with leaning at the seder represented דרך חרות - way of freedom, which meant that in the <em>olden days free people used to lean while eating</em>. I have never understood this idea, because sitting and leaning to the side regularly can damage one's spine.</p>\n<p>However, the deep point of R' Yellin about sitting with <em>derekh cheirus</em> at the seder is different. At the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Rabban_Gamliel%27s_Three_Things.7?ven=hebrew%7CPesach_Haggadah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">seder</a>,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חַיָּב אָדָם לִרְאוֹת אֶת־עַצְמוֹ כְּאִלּוּ הוּא יָצָא מִמִּצְרַיִם</p>\n<p>each person must see himself as if he himself had come out of Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As the map below suggests, leaving Egypt, going east towards Sinai and leaning to the left means leaning towards Eretz Israel - the eventual destination, from which we are supposed to draw our sustenance. Hence we do so at the seder.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lXSvuc9F.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lXSvuc9F.png\" alt=\"Moses' exodus map\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the simple, literal meaning of \"shor habar\" when moshiach comes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>There's a midrashic statement that's often quoted that says that when Moshiach comes, Hashem will arrange a battle between the Leviasan (giant fish that was created during the 6 days of creation), and the \"Shor HaBar\", usually translated as \"wild ox\", and the Leviasan with slaughter it with its fins etc.</p>\n<p>For some reason, I recall reading somewhere that this Shor HaBar is actually going to be a giant ox, similar to how the Leviasan is a giant fish.</p>\n<p>But what exactly is it (in the simple meaning)? It makes sense that the Leviasan is hidden in the ocean, so we don't see it now even though it's really big, but the Shor HaBar? If it's a land animal that's allegedly really huge, why don't we find it now? What exactly is it, according to commentaries?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>So whilst it is described as \"Shor Habar\" (e.g. by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.40.15?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_Zion_on_Job.40.15.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudos Dovid</a>), it is more prominently related as \"Behemoth\" in several sources.</p>\n<p>I will list the initial context and then as it relates to the battle with the Levyasan - hopefully it will provide more information.</p>\n<p>A good starting point is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.50.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 50:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי־לִ֥י כׇל־חַיְתוֹ־יָ֑עַר <strong>בְּ֝הֵמ֗וֹת בְּהַרְרֵי־אָֽלֶף</strong></p>\n<p>For Mine is every animal of the forest, <strong>the beasts on a thousand mountains</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.50.10?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Psalms.50.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The behemoth of the thousand mountains</strong> - That is (the bull) destined for the future feast [of the righteous], which grazes on a thousand mountains daily, and every day they grow back. Others explain this to mean one thousand mountains or one thousand parasangs (i.e., one mountain that is 1,000 parasangs long, or perhaps it should read: 1,000 bulls. The plural “mountains” indicates that there were many mountains of that type.[Shem Ephraim]) Others explain that this is like (Deut. 7:13): “the litter of your cattle (אלפיך).” i.e., mountains full of cattle, because he says, “I will not take from your household a bull.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see from Rashi that this giant bull/ox is destined to be part of feast for the righteous.</p>\n<p>This is brought famously in the Medrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.13.3?ven=english%7CThe_Sefaria_Midrash_Rabbah,_2022&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra Rabbah 13:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מַר רַבִּי יוּדָן בְּרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן כָּל בְּהֵמוֹת וְלִוְיָתָן הֵן קֶנִיגִין שֶׁל צַדִּיקִים לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא, וְכָל מִי שֶׁלֹּא רָאָה קֶנִיגִין שֶׁל אֻמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה, זוֹכֶה לִרְאוֹתָהּ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, כֵּיצַד הֵם נִשְׁחָטִים, בְּהֵמוֹת נוֹתֵץ לַלִּוְיָתָן בְּקַרְנָיו וְקוֹרְעוֹ, וְלִוְיָתָן נוֹתֵץ לַבְּהֵמוֹת בִּסְנַפִּירָיו וְנוֹחֲרוֹ. וַחֲכָמִים אוֹמְרִים זוֹ שְׁחִיטָה כְּשֵׁרָה הִיא, וְלֹא כָּךְ תָּנִינַן הַכֹּל שׁוֹחֲטִין וּבַכֹּל שׁוֹחֲטִין וּלְעוֹלָם שׁוֹחֲטִין חוּץ מִמַּגַּל קָצִיר, וְהַמְגֵרָה, וְהַשִּׁנַּיִם, מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהֵן חוֹנְקִין. אָמַר רַבִּי אָבִין בַּר כַּהֲנָא אָמַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא (ישעיה נא, ד): תּוֹרָה חֲדָשָׁה מֵאִתִּי תֵצֵא, חִדּוּשׁ תּוֹרָה מֵאִתִּי תֵצֵא. אָמַר רַבִּי בֶּרֶכְיָה בְּשֵׁם רַבִּי יִצְחָק אֲרִיסְטוֹן עָתִיד הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא לַעֲשׂוֹת לַעֲבָדָיו הַצַּדִּיקִים לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא וְכָל מִי שֶׁלֹּא אָכַל נְבֵלוֹת בָּעוֹלָם הַזֶּה זוֹכֶה לִרְאוֹתוֹ לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא, הֲדָא הוּא דִכְתִיב (ויקרא ז, כד): וְחֵלֶב נְבֵלָה וְחֵלֶב טְרֵפָה יֵעָשֶׂה לְכָל מְלָאכָה וְאָכֹל לֹא תֹאכְלֻהוּ, בִּשְׁבִיל שֶׁתֹּאכְלוּ מִמֶּנּוּ לֶעָתִיד לָבוֹא, לְפִיכָךְ משֶׁה מַזְהִיר לְיִשְׂרָאֵל וְאוֹמֵר לָהֶם (ויקרא יא, ב): זֹאת הַחַיָּה אֲשֶׁר תֹּאכֵלוּ.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yudan ben Rabbi Shimon said: The Behemoth and the Leviathan will engage in an animal fight before the righteous in the future. Anyone who was not a spectator at the animal fights of the nations of the world in this world, will merit to see it in the World to Come. How will they be slaughtered? The Behemoth will stab the Leviathan with its horns and tear it open, and the Leviathan will smash the Behemoth with its fins and stab it to death. The Sages say: Is this a valid ritual slaughter? But did we not learn: Everyone slaughters, and one may always slaughter, and one may slaughter with any item, except for the serrated side of the harvest sickle, a saw, the teeth of an animal, and a fingernail, because they strangle? Rabbi Avin bar Kahana said: The Holy One blessed be He said: “For [a new] Torah will emerge from Me” (Isaiah 51:4); a novel Torah ruling will emerge from Me.\nRabbi Berekhya said in the name of Rabbi Yitzḥak: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to make a feast for His righteous servants in the future, and anyone who did not partake of unslaughtered carcasses in this world will be privileged to see it in the World to Come. That is what is written: “And the fat of an unslaughtered carcass and the fat of a mauled animal may be used for all labor; but you shall not eat it [ve’akhol lo tokheluhu]” (Leviticus 7:24). So that you will be able to partake of it in the future, therefore Moses cautions Israel and says to them: “These are the living beings that you may eat” (Leviticus 11:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This battle is also noted in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Shmini.7.1?ven=english%7CTownsend_1989_translation_of_Midrash_Tanhuma,_S._Buber_Recension,_edited_and_supplemented_by_R._Francis_Nataf&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tanchuma on Shemini 7:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהֵיכָן הֵן נִשְׁחָטִין. אֶלָּא זֶה לָזֶה מִזְדַּוְגִין שְׁנֵיהֶם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: אֶחָד בָּאֶחָד יִגָּשׁוּ (איוב מא, ח). בְּהֵמוֹת יִגַּשׁ בַּלִּוְיָתָן וְאוֹחֵז בְּקַרְנָיו וּבוֹקֵעַ. וְלִוְיָתָן הֵפֶךְ יִהְיֶה מִיתָתוֹ, שֶׁמַּכֶּה אוֹתוֹ בִּזְנָבוֹ וְהוֹרְגוֹ, וְהַצַּדִּיקִים הוֹלְכִין וְנוֹטְלִין מָנוֹת מָנוֹת. מִכָּאן שְׁחִיטָה. אֶלָּא בִּשְׁבִיל לִבְדֹּק וּלְצָרֵף אֶת יִשְׂרָאֵל</p>\n<p>And [so] how are they slaughtered?

[Then] the righteous ones go and all take portions. From here [we see] that ritual slaughter was given only to examine and to purify (rt.: tsrp) Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as a greater background, we can begin to answer your questions as to why we don't find it now...</p>\n<p>First note the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.74b.7?lang=bi&with=Rashbam&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 74b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאַף בְּהֵמוֹת בְּהַרְרֵי אֶלֶף – זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם, וְאִלְמָלֵי נִזְקָקִין זֶה לָזֶה מַחֲרִיבִין כָּל הָעוֹלָם כּוּלּוֹ. מָה עָשָׂה הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא? סֵירַס הַזָּכָר, וְצִינֵּן הַנְּקֵבָה וּשְׁמָרָהּ לַצַּדִּיקִים לֶעָתִיד לָבֹא, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״הִנֵּה נָא כֹחוֹ בְמׇתְנָיו״ – זֶה זָכָר, ״וְאוֹנוֹ בִּשְׁרִירֵי בִטְנוֹ״ – זוֹ נְקֵבָה.</p>\n<p>And He created even the beasts on the thousand hills (see Psalms 50:10) male and female. And they were so enormous that if they would have coupled and produced offspring, they would have destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and cooled the sexual desire of the female and preserved it for the righteous in the future.

Reish Lakish said: It is one animal lying on one thousand mountains, and one thousand mountains grow food for it, so it will be food for the righteous, and it eats. What is the source? “The Sharon will be a pasture for flocks” (Isaiah 65:10). The Rabbis say: It is one animal and it is lying on one thousand mountains, and one thousand mountains grow various types of animals for it, and it eats. What is the source? “All the beasts of the field will frolic there” (Job 40:20). Is that possible, that an animal [behema] eats an animal? Rabbi Tanḥuma said: God’s deeds are great, how extraordinary are the deeds of the Holy One blessed be He.\nFrom where does it drink? Rabbi Yoḥanan and Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish, Rabbi Yoḥanan said: Everything that the Jordan takes in over the course of six months, it swallows in one gulp. What is the source? As it is stated: “Behold, it can swallow a river, it need not rush” (Job 40:23). Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Everything that the Jordan takes in over the course of twelve months, it swallows in one gulp. What is the source? “It is secure, even if it draws the Jordan into its mouth” (Job 40:23). It has enough just to wet the mouth. Rav Huna said in the name of Rabbi Yosei: It is not even enough just to wet the mouth. From where, then, does it drink? Rabbi Shimon ben Yoḥai taught: A river emerges from Eden and its name is Yuval, and it drinks from there, as it is stated: “And it shall spread its roots alongside a stream [yuval]” (Jeremiah 17:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Midrash on Korach and the mezuza\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a question about a famous Midrash on Parshat Korach, Midrash Tanchuma, siman 2 on Parshat Korach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּקַח קֹרַח. מַה כְּתִיב לְמַעְלָה מִן הָעִנְיָן, דַּבֵּר אֶל בְּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל וְאָמַרְתָּ אֲלֵיהֶם וְעָשׂוּ לָהֶם צִיצִת (במדבר טו, לח). קָפַץ קֹרַח וְאָמַר לְמֹשֶׁה, אַתָּה אוֹמֵר, וְנָתְנוּ עַל צִיצִת וְגוֹ' (שם). טַלִּית שֶׁכֻּלָּהּ תְּכֵלֶת, מַה הִיא שֶׁיְּהֵא פְּטוּרָה מִן הַצִּיצִית. אָמַר לוֹ מֹשֶׁה, חַיֶּבֶת בְּצִיצִית. אָמַר לוֹ קֹרַח, טַלִּית שֶׁכֻּלָּהּ תְּכֵלֶת אֵינָהּ פּוֹטֶרֶת עַצְמָהּ, וְאַרְבָּעָה חוּטִין פּוֹטֵר אוֹתָהּ. בַּיִת מָלֵא סְפָרִים, מַהוּ שֶׁתְּהֵא פְּטוּרָה מִן הַמְּזוּזָה. אָמַר לוֹ: חַיֶּבֶת בִּמְזוּזָה. אָמַר לוֹ: כָּל הַתּוֹרָה כֻּלָּהּ מָאתַיִם שִׁבְעִים וְחָמֵשׁ פָּרָשִׁיּוֹת שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהּ, כֻּלָּן אֵין פּוֹטְרוֹת אֶת הַבַּיִת, וּשְׁתֵּי פָּרָשִׁיּוֹת שֶׁבַּמְּזוּזָה פּוֹטְרוֹת אֶת הַבַּיִת</p>\n<p>“‘And Korach took'(16:1): What Parsha precedes this episode? – ‘Speak to the Israelites concerning the making of Tzitzit (fringes).'(15:34)</p>\n<p>Korach stepped forward turning to Moses: ‘You say, “Put on the fringe a thread of blue (t’chelet) wool.”(ibid.) What about a garment that is itself a blue colour (t’chelet), would it not be exempt from the blue thread (on the Tzitzit)?’</p>\n<p>Moses replied, ‘It is obligatory to have the blue thread.’</p>\n<p>Said Korach, ‘A garment which is all blue is not exempt and four meagre threads do the trick!?’</p>\n<p>Korach attacked again: ‘A room full of Sifrei Torah, would it need a Mezuza?’</p>\n<p>Moses answered in the affirmative.</p>\n<p>Korach replied, ‘The Torah contains 275 sections and they are not enough to fulfill the house’s obligation to have a Mezuza, but these two sections (written in the Mezuza scroll) will fulfil the obligation for the entire house!</p>\n<p>– Moses, you must be making this stuff up!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first part of this famous Midrash answers the question about what Korach took - since the Torah doesn't say explicitly what he took. The Midrash then answers that he took Tzitzit/Talit since the last section in the previous parsha, Parshat Shlach, is Parshat Tzitzit. But I don't understand the point of the 2nd part of that Midrash with the Mezuza and the room full of Sifrei Torah.</p>\n<p>How does that second part of the Midrash about Mezuza/Sefer Torah answer the question of what Korach took? Does it really answer that question?</p>\n<p>Another question still on that 2nd part: it seems that this Midrash highlights the importance of the figure 275 which is the number of units/paragraphs/Parshyot in the whole Sefer Torah.\nHow is that number relevant and what's the textual connection here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Before giving an answer, it is important to note that we are working exclusively with the text of Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Korach.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Korach 1</a> and not with the general question \"<em>What did Korach take?</em>\" addressed in a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105119/pshat-of-what-did-korach-take\">different post</a>, although one could modify the answer there by additional commentaries, which may bundle different opinions.

The commentary ביאור האמורים by R' Avraham Meir Rosen printed in the Zichron Aharon 4-volume edition of Midrash Tanchuma states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל המפרשים נתחבטו לכוון החשבון הזה ולא יכולו</p>\n<p>All commentators struggled to resolve this number (275) and were not able.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, one needs to take this number 275 as designating a large amount, comparable to the number of Sifrei Torah in the room, or strings of blue <em>tekheles</em> in the hypothetical Korach's <em>tallis</em> made of the <em>tekheles</em>.</p>\n<p>The midrash tells that Korach and his congregation were challenging the leadership of Moshe and Aharon. For example, the four strings of <em>tekheles</em> in the first Korach's dismissal, as the ביאור האמורים explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היינו שני חוטין כפולין שהם ארבעה בכל כנף לדעת רש\"י ותוס', או חוט אחד פשוט לכול כנף לדעת הרמב\"ם, עיין תוס' יו\"ט ריש פרק ד' דמנחות</p>\n<p>They are two double strings that are four in each corner according to the opinion of Rashi and Tosafos, or one string in each corner according to Rambam, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_Yom_Tov_on_Mishnah_Menachot.4.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos Yom Tov beginning of perek 4 in Menachos</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can take these to mean a reference to Moshe and Aharon (the strings of the front two corners) and Aharon's two sons Elazar and Ithamar (the strings of the back two corners). All these people were appointed by Hashem for the work in the <em>Mishkan</em>, just like the strings of tzitzis were commanded by Hashem to be worn in 4-cornerd garments. All the <em>techeles</em> strings of the Korach's <em>tallis</em> were not having any halakhic status at the same time. (By the way, we do encounter a garment of four corners which was fully made of <em>techeles</em>, the Meil of the Kohein Gadol, as <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31972/why-didnt-the-kohanim-wear-tzizis\">discussed here whether it needed tzitzis</a>. It is possible, that this is a source that Korach wanted to be a Kohein Gadol instead of Aharon). Similarly, other Jewish people in the camp were not commanded to serve in the Mishkan.</p>\n<p>The second challenge follows the same pattern, the two parshios written on the <em>mezuzah</em> scroll exempt the room even if it does not have any <em>Sifrei Torah</em> because these parshiyos were commanded to be written by Hashem. This is again a reference to Moshe and Aharon who could enter the Kodesh haKodashim (<strong>the room</strong>). All single \"275\" <em>parshios</em> in all <em>Sifrei Torah</em> do not constitute a <em>mezuzah</em> scroll to exempt a room. Likewise, other Jewish people did not have a priviledge to enter the <em>Kodesh haKodashim</em>.</p>\n<p>(For completeness I could quote the the ביאור האמורים explanation of the Korach's intent, but it seems to be out of scope of the OP's question).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is possible to interpret the number 275 in a way of <em>remez</em>, 275 is gematria of the word רעה - <em>bad</em>. I.e. Korach hinted that the whole Torah of Moshe is bad. The commentary ביאור האמורים by R' Avraham Meir Rosen printed in the Zichron Aharon 4-volume edition of Midrash Tanchuma states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>השאלה זו מבית מלא ספרים לא הוצרך לשום אדם עדיין, שהספר תורה הראשונה לא נכתבה עד סוף ארבעים שנהליציאת מצרים, ואין זה אלא דברי לצנות, כמעשה שספר בשוחר טוב (מזמור א) באלמנה ושתי יתומות שהיה לה שדה. והמעשה הזה לא היה ולא נברא אלא קרח בדאה מלבו כדי להתלוצץ על מושה רבינו ע\"ה ותורתו, והראה העשק וגזל רש הנמצה בתורת מושה.</p>\n<p>...this question regarding a house full of <em>Sifrei Torah</em> had not yet been necessary for anyone, since the first Torah scroll written at the end of forty years after the Exodus from Egypt. This was nothing but words of mockery, like the incident narrated in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.1.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehilim 1:13</a> about a widow and two orphan daughters who had a field. The incident had never been and was only created by a whim of Korach's heart in order to mock Moshe Rabbeinu ע\"ה and falsify his Torah, showing the oppression and plunder of the poor supposedly mentioned in it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.1.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehilim 1:13</a> fully supports the <em>remez</em> regarding 275:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another matter: Fortunate is the man who is not one of the sons of Korah, who did not follow the counsel of their father, as it is said (Numbers 16:26), \"Depart now from the tents of these wicked men.\" And they sinned in the manner of sinners (ibid. 17:3), [which was] the censers of sinners. And in the company of the scorners, [there was] Korah, who mocked Moses and Aaron. What did he do? He assembled the entire congregation, as it is said (ibid. 16:19), \"And Korah gathered against them the entire congregation.\" He began to speak disparagingly and said to them, \"There was once a widow in my neighborhood with two orphaned daughters and she had one field. When she came to plow, Moses said to her (Deuteronomy 22:10), 'You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.' When she came to sow, Moses said to her (Leviticus 19:19), 'Your field shall not be sown with two different kinds of seed.' When she came to reap and make a pile [of sheaves], Moses said to her (Deuteronomy 24:19), 'You shall leave [some stalks] for the poor and the stranger.' When she came to make a threshing floor, he said to her, 'You shall give tithes [of your crop] and [separate] terumah, tithes, first tithe, and second tithe.' The righteous woman accepted [the ruling] and complied. What did she do? She sold the field and bought two lambs to clothe herself with their fleece and to enjoy their fruits. When Aaron's firstborn son was born, he came to her and said, 'Give me the firstborns, as the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to me (Deuteronomy 15:19), \"Every firstborn that is born in your cattle and your flock, the male [belongs to] Him.\"' The righteous woman accepted [the ruling] and complied. When it came time to shear them, he said to her, 'Give me the foreleg, cheeks, and stomach.' She said to him, 'Even though I slaughtered them, I did not escape from your hand. Behold, I am under a ban.' He said to her, 'Give [them to me], as the verse states (Numbers 18:14), \"Every ban among the people of Israel shall be yours.\"' He took [the portions] and went on his way. She left weeping, as did her two daughters. Such is the way of these [men], who taunt [others] and hang [their claims] on the Holy One, Blessed be He. [They have done] so much [harm], yet they still continue [to provoke] the Holy One, Blessed be He.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is an allusion to the 4 camps when Jewish people travelled in the desert under the protective clouds of glory of Shechina, as we see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Bamidbar%2C_Nasso%2C_Beha%27alotcha%2C_Torah_Ohr%2C_Bamidbar.19?ven=hebrew%7CShenei_Luchot_HaBrit,_based_on_Amsterdam,_1698_ed._Part_III&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Shebikhtav, Bamidbar, Nasso, Beha'alotcha, Torah Ohr 19</a> in the name of Rekanati (although other placings of Uriel and Raphael are abound):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It follows that the pictures on the 4 flags which the Israelites had in the desert were of the four חיות that support G–d's throne, that they also hinted at the four camps of the שכינה, namely the four emanations mentioned, and that they also reflected the concept of the four basic elements in our world as well as the four compass directions. The Zohar elaborates on all this. The Rekanati says that the four basic elements are presided over by the four angels מיכאל, גבריאל, אוריאל, and רפאל.</p>\n<p>מיכאל presides over the element water, and establishes a link between the waters in the upper regions, the waters of חסד. He does this in his capacity of \"High Priest” of the Celestial Regions. He atones on behalf of Israel, since the region of atonement is in the domain of חסד. As a result, his position in those regions is on the right of G–d's throne.</p>\n<p>גבריאל presides over the element אש הגדולה \"the great fire,\" hence his position is on the left. His official title is \"Commander in Chief\" of the celestial armies. (i.e. he represents גבורה)</p>\n<p>אוריאל is in front, presiding over the element רוח, the region whence light comes to the world, since it is positioned in the East. The sun rises in the East, of course. (i.e. he represents תפארת)</p>\n<p>רפאל is in the West, presiding over the element עפר, earth. The Rabbis say that he is in charge of the earth that is attached to the throne of G–d, a material known as the חומר הראשון, \"original raw material” (i.e. he represents יסוד)</p>\n<p>(compare <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.2.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 2:10</a>). The Midrash there states that just as G–d had created four compass directions in our lower world, so He has surrounded His Throne with four angels, i.e. מיכאל, גבריאל, אוריאל, רפאל.

With regard to him, the verse states: “Do not let your mouth bring your flesh into guilt” (Ecclesiastes 5:5). The Gemara poses a question: What was it that led him to heresy? <strong>He saw the angel Mitatron, who was granted permission to sit and write the merits of Israel.</strong> He said: There is a tradition that in the world above there is no sitting; no competition; no turning one’s back before Him, i.e., all face the Divine Presence; and no lethargy. Seeing that someone other than God was seated above, he said: Perhaps, the Gemara here interjects, Heaven forbid, there are two authorities, and there is another source of power in control of the world in addition to God. Such thoughts led Aḥer to heresy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since מט\"ט is מֶיטַטְרוֹן, we see that he is responsible for making records of the Jewish people's merits. On Rosh Hashana we pray for a כְּתִיבָה וְחֲתִמה טוׂבָה - good writing and seal, hence we mention the name of the angel.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Minhagim of Western Poland (Posen, Breslau, West Preußen)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Do old eastern Germans Jews (ethnically German or Polish) in Western Poland (Silesia, Posen, W.Preussen) tend to be Hasidic, Non-Hasidic, most probably Minhag Polin (like Berlin, Hamburg)</p>\n<p>How does it compare to “minhag America” and the generic Ashkenazi minhag prevalent nowadays? Is it similar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The border between Minhag Ashkenaz and Minhag Polin was not completely stable over time. In <em>Thesaurus of Hebrew Oriental Melodies, vol. 7, Songs of the South German Jews</em> (1932), A. Z. Idelsohn writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rhineland and Eastern France is considered to be the cradle of the Ashkenazic song. We also know that up to the expulsion of the Jews from France in 1394 the synagogue song in both countries was alike. On the other hand, in the synagogue song in Eastern Europe many variants and changes had developed. With these Jacob Levi (Maharil) was acquainted. The Danube was considered the border between West and East European rites, so that, in Regensburg for example, the eastern rite prevailed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Idelsohn cites, <em>Maharil</em>, Warsaw 1873, p. 47 \"When he (Jacob Mollin) once officiated on the High Holydays in Regensburg as a precentor and sang the prayers according to the Austrian rite, which was traditional in that congregation, it occurred to him that he chanted the Haftara (Prophets) according to the mode traditional in the Rhineland.\"</p>\n<p>This geographical division remained in Southern Germany, however in Eastern Germany (Berlin, Stettin, Poznan, etc.) the situation continued to change. While Idelsohn doesn't draw a second geographic line, I have seen written in other sources that the Elbe River became a rough division between Minhag Ashkenaz and Minhag Polin by the 18th Century. Idelsohn writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Toward the end of the 17th century the East-European Synagogue Song developed its present features. After the excesses of Chmelnitzki (1648-1660) East-European Jews migrated to the West, especially Rabbis and precentors, and within a short time we find them officiating in most German congregations. The East European precentors distinguished themselves at that time by their art and virtuosity and were superior to their German colleagues. They introduced into the German congregations the so-called Polish song, i.e. the Synagogue Song as developed in eastern Europe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a footnote, he adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We here likewise of Polish precentors in Prague, Fürth, Hamburg, and Amsterdam, etc. more details in my <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/jewishmusicinits0000azid\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Jewish Music</em></a>, chaps. IX, XI, and XIV.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On pages 212-213 of <em>Jewish Music in It's Historical Development</em>, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If until the seventeen century Germany had supplied Eastern Europe with rabbis and <em>chazzanim</em>, the one transplanting thither Ashkenazic Jewish learning, and the other Ashkenazic traditional songs and customs, that role was no longer hers after the massacres of Chmelnitzki (1648-60), which caused the Polish and Ukrainian Jews to leave their dwelling place and to migrate westward. In the course of a very short time, the Polish influx colored the character of many a Central European congregation; or, in some instances, separate Polish congregations were established.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While this migration of eastern Jews happened to some extent throughout Germany, (In <em>HOM, vol. 7</em>, Idelsohn gives the counterexamples of Issac Lachmann, born in Dubno  1838, spent his career as cantor in Bavaria, and Fabian Ogutsch, born in Lithuania 1845, cantor in Frankfort, both of whom adapted to the local traditional Minhag Ashkenaz rather than importing Polish melodies), it was in the the cities of the north and east that Minhag Polin made major inroads. One can find the names of many prominent figures that migrated to northern Germany, such as R. Tzvi Ashkenazi, the father of R. Yaacov Emden to Altona, along with many other examples. Eric Werner writes in <em>A Voice Still Heard: The Sacred Songs of the Ashkenazic Jews</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, turned out that the cities were more prone to admit Jewish settlers than the rural environments—a complete reversal of the situation 150 years previously. Toward the end of the seventeen century, the Jews returned to Holland, Denmark, Prussia, and somewhat later to Saxony. In this climate of a devastated Germany, ravaged by the Wars of Religion, a \"new tolerance\" seemed to dawn; and it remains the unforgotten merit of the pietists to have set both example and pace toward a kind of \"friendship\" with a weary and anxiety-ridden Jewry.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yet the communities were beset by the beginnings of a mass reimmigration of Jews from Poland and the Ukraine in consequence of the pogroms that had started in 1648. As usual, cantors were in the vanguard of the refugees. Surprisingly, the German Jews took quickly to the somewhat \"exotic\" type of Polish <em>ḥazanut</em>. Where there was strong resistance, separate congregations for the Jews from Poland were established. In the long run the \"Polish style\" became so popular in Germany that it served as a counterweight against the complete Germanization of <em>minhag ashkenaz</em>. 200 years later, Abraham Baer separated the two traditions in his <em>Ba'al Tefillah</em>, the first serious musical source and compendium of <em>minhag ashkenaz</em>, which has been quoted extensively above.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While there is no guarantee that the musical development of Ashkenaz into two distinct styles that Idelsohn and Werner trace perfectly correlates with the geographical distribution of other differences between Minhag Ashkenaz and Minhag Polin, say what age to start wearing a tallis or which yotzros to include, it can be used as a general proxy for the movement of people and customs.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The Mosaic law and sin in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Please read my question carefully. This is not an off topic question. This question <em>is</em> about Judaism, even if Christianity is mentioned.</strong></p>\n<p>Paul of Tarsus, a 1st century Pharisaical Jew turned Christian, made the following statement about the Mosaic law in his letter to the church in Rome:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now we know that whatever the law says, it says to those who are under\nthe law, <strong>so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world may\nbe held accountable to God</strong>. For no one is declared righteous\nbefore him by the works of the law, <strong>for through the law comes the\nknowledge of sin.</strong> (Romans 3:19-20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, Paul claims that one of the purposes of the Mosaic law was to expose human sin and lawlessness.</p>\n<p>My question is this: is this a novel understanding coming from Paul? Does this idea exist within Judaism at all? Do any rabbis speak of the Mosaic law exposing man's sin and imperfection? Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I see two ideas presented by Paul that you've highlighted. The first one is very much a Jewish idea, as I'll explain:</p>\n<p>Twice daily we recite the Shema. This is a citation of three paragraphs from the Torah, the first of which comes from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9970/jewish/Chapter-6.htm#v4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim (Deuteronomy) 6:4-9</a>, and the second from <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9975/jewish/Chapter-11.htm#v13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim (Deuteronomy) 11:13-21</a>.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.13a.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Brachos 13a</a> discusses why the first paragraph is read first, and the second paragraph is read second:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן קָרְחָה: לָמָּה קָדְמָה פָּרָשַׁת ״שְׁמַע״ לְ״וְהָיָה אִם שָׁמוֹעַ״ — כְּדֵי שֶׁיְּקַבֵּל עָלָיו עוֹל מַלְכוּת שָׁמַיִם תְּחִלָּה, וְאַחַר כָּךְ מְקַבֵּל עָלָיו עוֹל מִצְוֹת.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Korḥa said: Why, in the mitzva of the recitation of Shema, did the portion of Shema precede that of VeHaya im Shamoa? This is so that one will first accept upon himself the yoke of the kingdom of Heaven, the awareness of God and God’s unity, and only then accept upon himself the yoke of the mitzvot, which appears in the paragraph of VeHaya im Shamoa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, recognition of our subservience to G-d is the sine qua non of performance of mitzvos, as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Shabbat.13.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Yerushalmi Shabbos 13:3</a> says on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9928/jewish/Chapter-27.htm#v34\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Vayikra (Leviticus) 27:34</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רִבִּי אִילָא. אֵ֣לֶּה הַמִּצְוֹ֗ת. אִם עֲשִׂיתָן כְּמִצְווֹתָן הֵן מִצְוֹת. וְאִם לָאו אֵינָן מִצְוֹת.</p>\n<p>Rebbi Ila said, these are the commandments. If you did them the way they were commanded they are a good deeds; otherwise they are not good deeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Meir Kahane expands on this idea in his sefer <a href=\"https://www.rabbikahane.co.il/product/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%A2%D7%99%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8-%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%90/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Haraayon</a> in the <a href=\"https://www.rabbikahane.org/books/%d7%90%d7%95%d7%a8%20%d7%94%d7%a8%d7%a2%d7%99%d7%95%d7%9f/%d7%a4%d7%a8%d7%a7%20%d7%94-%20%d7%a7%d7%91%d7%9c%d7%aa%20%d7%a2%d7%95%d7%9c%20%d7%9e%d7%9c%d7%9b%d7%95%d7%aa%20%d7%a9%d7%9e%d7%99%d7%9d/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fifth chapter</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"כ, על אחת כמה וכמה אדם בישראל הכופר במצוות מן השמים רח\"ל, והמקיים \"מצוה\" מן התורה כגון כבוד אב ואם או שנותן צדקה וכדומה, אך לא משום שאלו הן גזרת מלך, צו אלוקי מסיני, אלא רק בגלל ההסכמה \"המוסרית\" שלו, שלא עשה ולא כלום, ואינו מברך או מקדש או מקיים אלא מנאץ.</p>\n<p>If so, all the more so a person of Israel who denies that the commandments are from Heaven, (Heaven hear our prayers) [ed. \"Heaven forbid such a thing\"], and fulfills a \"commandment\" from the Torah like honoring one's father and mother or giving charity or the like, but not because it is a decree of the King but because it agrees with his \"morality\" - he has done nothing [ed. of fulfillment of commandments] and hasn't blessed or made holy or fulfilled, but rather has blasphemed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, inherent in knowledge of the law is the knowledge of our struggle - sometimes success, sometimes failure, or as Paul calls it, \"knowledge of sin\" - to uphold that law. This is not some major innovation on Paul's part, it's the definition of being inherently imperfect as humans. Your interpretation of this line is completely divorced from the words of Paul, but is nonetheless straight out of a verse in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8172/jewish/Chapter-8.htm#v21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis (Genesis) 8:21</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּ֣רַח ה אֶת־רֵ֣יחַ הַנִּיחֹ֒חַ֒ וַיֹּ֨אמֶר ה אֶל־לִבּ֗וֹ לֹ֣א אֹ֠סִ֠ף לְקַלֵּ֨ל ע֤וֹד אֶת־הָֽאֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽעֲב֣וּר הָֽאָדָ֔ם כִּ֠י יֵ֣צֶר לֵ֧ב הָֽאָדָ֛ם רַ֖ע מִנְּעֻרָ֑יו וְלֹֽא־אֹסִ֥ף ע֛וֹד לְהַכּ֥וֹת אֶת־כָּל־חַ֖י כַּֽאֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשִֽׂיתִי:</p>\n<p>And the Lord smelled the pleasant aroma, and the Lord said to Himself, \"I will no longer curse the earth because of man, for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth, and I will no longer smite all living things as I have done.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All this being said, Paul's antinomian theology is purely and utterly nonsensical. To quote <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@ToviaSinger1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Tovia Singer</a>: \"Anything you find in the New Testament of the Christian Bible - if it's true, it isn't new, and if it's new, it isn't true.\"</p>\n\n\n",

R' Yishmael ben Elisha was perhaps born in the year 90 CE<sup>1</sup> but was certainly too young to have ever performed the service on Yom Kippur as he was taken captive as a youth (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Horayot.2.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Horiyot 2:6</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.58a.9-10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Giṭtin 58a</a>).</p>\n<p>However his grandfather, who was also named Yishmael, was a Kohen Gadol and could have performed the service.</p>\n<p>I have not seen any manuscript evidence that the words בֶּן אֱלִישָׁע were interpolated.

This was suggested by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzhak_Baer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yitzchak Baer</a>, '<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23555129\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Service of Sacrifice in Second Temple Times</a>', <em>Zion</em> 40 (1975) pp. 135-136 (in Hebrew).<sup>2</sup> The tanna Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha (he who was supposedly born ca. 90 CE) was probably his descendant. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Klein_(scholar)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Prof. Shmuel Klein</a>, 'Studies in Names and Titles' (לחקר השמות והתוארים), <em>Ha-Soker</em> 5 (1936-1938), p. 10 (in Hebrew) suggested identifying Phebus, one of two envoys sent by Agrippus II to try to disperse the fledgling Jewish rebellion movement (Josephus, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2850/2850-h/2850-h.htm#link22HCH0019:%7E:text=3.%20And%20now%20when,them%20into%20the%20city.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>War of the Jews</em>, 2:19:3</a>), with Rabbi Yishmael ben Piabi. He identified the second envoy, Borceus, with <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9_%D7%9B%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yissachar of Kefar Barkai</a>, another one-time Kohen Gadol. Phebus was slaughtered by the crowd while Borceus, though injured, managed to escape with his life. This might be some kind of alternate version for Rabbi Yishmael's death in the tale of the Ten Martyrs.</p>\n<p>A precursor of this suggestion was brought by Tosfot on Yevamot 104a, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.104a.9?ven=hebrew%7CVilna_Edition&lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Yevamot.104a.9.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s.v. אמר ר' ישמעאל</a>, simply stating that there were two Rabbi Yishmael ben Elishas, one a Kohen Gadol before the destruction, another a tanna after the destruction - without identifying the former with Rabbi Yishmael ben Piabi.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is that during the Bar Kochva Revolt the Temple service was reinstated, and according to some, the Temple was rebuilt in some capacity.<sup>3</sup> Following this proposal, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%A7%D7%91_%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaakov Hakohen Shachi</a>, 'The Construction of the Temple by Bar Kokhba', <em>Yerushalayim</em> 6 (1903), <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=44186&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">p. 307</a> (in Hebrew) suggested that Rabbi Yishmael ben Elisha the Kohen Gadol served in the role in the Bar Kochban Temple.

Why? Should not a simple vow from wine do the trick?</p>\n<p>In fact, per the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chidushei_Agadot_on_Shabbat.139a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha Chidushei Agadot Shabbat 139(a) (.ולקדקד נזיר וגו)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a vow from wine v. being a full Nazir, in essence, accomplish <em>very similar things when it comes to repudiating the evils of indulgences / excesses</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A vow is something you make once and people tend to forget about them or lose interest. Being a nazir is a complete lifestyle change. Once you have the whole \"package\", it's harder to backslide. You have to do it all at once.</p>\n<p>The Gemara isn't giving a command that you should become a nazir, it's saying \"If you're REALLY serious about not getting involved with sotah situations...\" People who are pious about certain mitzvot go above and beyond.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Notwithstanding the Maharsha (both, Nazir and a vow from wine, potentially protect one from the evils of excess and indulgence), a Nazir must, in fact, observe more biblical wine oriented stringencies in order to distance himself from wine. FE, a Nazir may not drink משרת אבנים biblically a la the rabbinical\nאָמְרִין נְזִירָא; סְחוֹר סְחוֹר, לְכַרְמָא לָא תִּקְרַב״.  we say to a nazirite; go around and go around, but do not come near to the vineyard.</p>\n<p>Thus, one who sees a Sota in her state of utter disgrace and demise should be so moved by the experience that the natural thing to do would to become a full Nazir in order to take on ALL of the biblical and rabbinical wine stringencies that prevent any possibility of drinking wine and becoming Sota-like.</p>\n<p>An example of Nazir is given in midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.98.20?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 98:20</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Joseph, on the head of the elect among his brothers” (Genesis 49:26).</strong> ... “On the head of the elect [nezir] among his brothers” – as his brothers distanced him and caused him to be isolated [nazir].  (see, e.g., Leviticus 22:2; Isaiah 1:4), and so too, Joseph was separated from his brothers.  Rabbi Yitzḥak of Migdal said: You are the crown of your brothers. Rabbi Levi said: He was an actual nazirite, as Rabbi Levi said: All twenty-two years that he did not see his brothers, he did not taste the taste of wine. They, too, did not taste wine until they saw him. That is what is written: “They drank and became intoxicated with him” (Genesis 43:34) – with him they drank; without him they did not drink.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yedei_Moshe_on_Bereshit_Rabbah.98.20.2?ven=hebrew%7CMidrash_Rabbah,_Vilna,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yedei Moshe on Midrash Bereshis Rabba 98:20</a> that underscores the idea of complete separation (see his second answer, which I will translate):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>אף הם לא טעמו טעם יין.</strong> ... י\"ל דה\"ק הוא היה נזיר לגמרי עשא\"כ הם לא שתו יין ומ\"מ לא היו נזירים שאסורים בחרצנים וזגים וכו':</p>\n<p>... he (Yosef) was a complete Nazir, (unlike his brothers) who (merely) did not drink wine, and were not prohibited from seeds and skin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, Yosef who lived among promiscuous Egyptian women, such as Potifar's wife, had to be stringent.</p>\n\n\n",

As we find in the statement of our father\nYaakov, peace be upon him, who said to his sons (Genesis 42:2) “Go\ndown there (‘redu shamah’),” and they were delayed in Egypt for the\nnumerical value of “רד\"ו” (Reish-Dalet-Vav), which is 210 years. And\nlikewise the statement of Moshe our teacher, peace be upon him, who\nsaid (Deuteronomy 4:25), “When you beget children and grandchildren\nand have grown old (‘venoshantem’) in the land,” and we dwelled in the\nLand of Israel from the day we entered it until the exile of King\nJehoiachin for the numerical value of “venoshantem,” which is 846\nyears. And so too many similar things.</p>\n<p>And regarding this matter we have received that which Bilaam said\n(Numbers 23:23), “At that time it shall be said to Jacob and to Israel\nwhat has God wrought,” contains a secret: that from that moment, one\nshould count a number equivalent to the number of years from the Six\nDays of Creation until that moment, and then prophecy will return to\nIsrael. And then the prophets will say to them, “What has God\nwrought.” And this prophecy was said in the fortieth year after they\nleft the land of Egypt. And you will find that the beginning of the\ncount until that moment is 2,448 years, the sign being “ב'תפ\"ח גאולים”\n(“in 2448 [come] the redeemed”).</p>\n<p>And according to this correlation and this interpretation, prophecy\nwill return to Israel in the year 4976 from creation. And there is no\ndoubt that the return of prophecy is the forerunner of the coming of\nthe Messiah, as it is said (Joel 3:1), “And your sons and daughters\nshall prophesy.”</p>\n<p>This is truer than any calculation ever stated regarding the end [of\ndays]. And this that we have said is true, even though we have been\nwarned and utterly prohibited from revealing it, so that it should not\nappear to the people as something distant—and yet I have already\ninformed you of it. Blessed is He who knows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.5.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kings_and_Wars.5.1</a>, Rambam defines Milchemet Mitzvah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What is considered a milchemet mitzvah?<br />\n-The war against the seven nations that occupied Eretz Yisrael,<br />\n-The war against Amalek, and<br />\n-a war fought to <strong>assist Israel</strong> from <strong>an enemy which attacks them</strong>\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last concept requires defining three terms: \"Israel\", \"enemy\", and \"attack\"</p>\n<p><strong>1. \"Israel\"</strong></p>\n<p>In my understanding, Rambam's view of the collective \"Israel\" that he uses consistently is somewhat anachronistic, referring to the Jewish absolute monarchy.</p>\n<p>However, \"Israel\" might alternatively mean many things, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a city with a large Jewish population</li>\n<li>a city with a Jewish majority</li>\n<li>a Jewish autonomy</li>\n<li>a democratic secular state with a Jewish majority (aka the State of Israel), with or without the majority of worldwide Jewry</li>\n<li>a Jewish monarchy, with or without the majority of worldwide Jewry</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2. \"Enemy\"</strong></p>\n<p>An enemy who targets Jewish lives could be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a stand-alone terrorist/serial killer</li>\n<li>a local terrorist group</li>\n<li>an international terrorist group</li>\n<li>a sovereign state</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>3. \"Attack\"</strong></p>\n<p>That could also have different meanings, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>threatens to attack</li>\n<li>sabotages resources (roads, electricity, water)</li>\n<li>kills single individuals</li>\n<li>kills a group of Jews</li>\n<li>organizes a pogrom</li>\n<li>launches missiles into Jewish settlements</li>\n<li>launches full-scale war against a Jewish political entity</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A proper definition of a Mandatory war has immense implications, e.g., total mobilization or the permission to exterminate non-combatants.</p>\n<p><strong>How do different commentators define a Defensive war?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How did Eve Knew About Childbirth, Adam Know About Bread and Parents before Anyone Was Born or Anything Baked?",
    "content": "# How did Eve Knew About Childbirth, Adam Know About Bread and Parents before Anyone Was Born or Anything Baked?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Genesis 3, God curses Adam and Eve after their sin. But the language of the curses seems to assume a <strong>level of worldly understanding that Adam and Eve simply couldn’t have had especially if, as many traditional Jewish sources maintain, the sin happened very soon after their creation.</strong></p>\n<p>Let’s break it down:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Eve and Childbirth\n“I will greatly increase your pain in childbearing…” (Genesis 3:16)</strong></p>\n<p>But Eve had never had children. In fact, <strong>she may not even have known that children were a concept</strong>. The Torah gives no indication that she was ever told about reproduction or what childbirth is so how could this curse be meaningful or comprehensible to her?</p>\n<p><strong>2. Adam and Bread\n“By the sweat of your brow shall you eat bread…” (Genesis 3:19)</strong></p>\n<p>But bread is a human <strong>invention</strong>, not something found in the wild. It requires harvesting grain, grinding it, mixing it with water, kneading, and baking. Adam had just been placed in the Garden; who says he even knew to grind anything, let alone complex food processing that probably took a lot of trial and error with a good dose of luck to ultimately come up with the real bread?</p>\n<p><strong>3. \"A Man Shall Leave His Father and Mother\" — Who?\n“Therefore, a man shall leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife…” (Genesis 2:24)</strong></p>\n<p>This verse comes before there were any fathers or mothers. Adam and Eve had no parents, and the concept of family lineage didn’t yet exist. How could this verse describe social behavior based on generations, when they were the first human beings?</p>\n<p>These examples all suggest the Torah is speaking in post-civilizational terms, as if Adam and Eve were familiar with concepts like childbirth, family structure, and processed food despite supposedly living at the very dawn of human existence.</p>\n<p>Obvious Responses I'm Not Asking About:\nI’m aware that some commentators (e.g., Abarbanel) take the story metaphorically that’s not what this question is addressing.</p>\n<p>Some might claim Adam and Eve had prophetic knowledge, but the Torah is very clear when people receive prophecy and we see no mention of that here. All prior instructions to them are simple and concrete (e.g., don’t eat from the tree).</p>\n<p>So there’s no textual basis to assume they somehow understood complex aspects of future human society.</p>\n<p>The Real Question:\nAre there traditional Jewish sources (Rashi, Ramban, Midrashim, etc.) that address these anachronisms?</p>\n<p>Did Adam and Eve truly comprehend these experiences and concepts?</p>\n<p>Or is the Torah describing things for the reader’s understanding, rather than what the characters actually knew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Sanhedrin 38b:</p>\n<p>\"אמר רבי יוחנן בר חנינא: שתים עשרה שעות הוי היום. שעה ראשונה הוצבר עפרו, שניה נעשה גולם, שלישית נמתחו אבריו, רביעית נזרקה בו נשמה, חמישית עמד על רגליו, ששית קרא שמות, שביעית נזדווגה לו חוה, שמינית עלו למטה שנים וירדו ארבעה, תשיעית נצטווה שלא לאכול מן האילן, עשירית סרח, אחת עשרה נידון, שתים עשרה נטרד והלך לו\"</p>\n<p>Which clearly states that Adam and Chavah had children before the sin. Also, rashi to berreishis 4:1 says explicitly that Adam knew Chavah and had already conceived and given birth to Cain <em>prior</em> to the sin.</p>\n<p>The posuk regarding a man leaving his parents to cleave to his wife does not say anywhere that this was specifically said to Adam by Hashem. In fact, rashi says on the verse that Ruach hakodesh said this in order to prohibit immoral relations for bnei Noach</p>\n<p>Regarding the question with the lechem, it says in a Midrash that there were multiple opinions of what pri eitz ha daas was. An esrog, a fig, a grape, and yes, you guessed it, wheat.  Rashi also brings this Medrash on the posuk (Genesis) 2:17, s.v. \"ומעץ הדעת טוב ורע\":\nרבי יהודה אומר: חטה היתה, שאין התינוק יודע לקרוא אבא ואמא עד שיטעום טעם דגן.\nRabbi Yehuda says: It was wheat, because a child does not know how to say “father” and “mother” until he has tasted the taste of grain. And this is very significant to note, that rashi only brings <em>this one opinion</em> from the Midrash on what the eitz hadaas was (later when they make clothing he cites the opinion that it was a fig tree because they “rectified themselves with that which they had degraded themselves”)</p>\n<p>In another source it says that before the sin bread came up from the ground in ready made loaves and will again be so in the times of Moshiach. The mention of bread growing whole and baked (like in Gan Eden) is on Berachos 57a, Rashi s.v. \"pat\".</p>\n<p>Anyway, I think from all these sources it is quite clear according to peshat, Adam and Chavah knew firsthand about these inyonim</p>\n\n\n",

These include the Midianite genocide by Moses, various campaigns of conquest by Joshua (such as Ai, Hazor, Jericho, etc.), or Mordechai's decree calling for the indiscriminate killing of women, the elderly, and children of the so-called \"enemies of the Jews.\"</p>\n<p>I understand that the ultimate justification for all of the above is the concept of Biblical collectivism, applied equally to the Jewish nation (as it says \"פֹּקֵד עֲוֺן אָבֹת עַל־בָּנִים עַל־שִׁלֵּשִׁים וְעַל־רִבֵּעִים לְשֹׂנְאָי\"), where all members of the group are held responsible for the actions of their leaders, ancestors, or random fellows.</p>\n<p>In theory, halachically speaking, does the same approach apply today? For example, given the existential wars in Gaza and Iran, would the label of \"an enemy of the Jews\" apply to all their civilian populations, justifying mass killings?

    "content": "# Halachos on sta”m: specifically mukaf gvil and separating touching letters\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In shulchan aruch siman 32:16 it addresses the laws of writing, specifically when a letter is intercepted by a hole in the klaf. According to Beis Yosef, the reason that a letter with the hole at the bottom is still kosher is because he understands the requirement that the letter be “mukaf gvil” as either</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>the letter cannot be touching any other letter (at the time of writing or after), or</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>that the letter has to actually be written with klaf surrounding the perimeter of the letter all around, but this is only at the time of writing.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And so we see, if a hole formed in a letter after the writing, it satisfies both possibilities (it is not touching another letter and when it was written it was surrounded by klaf since the hole only developed later).</p>\n<p>Now in siman 32:18, the shulchan aruch says that a letter which touches another is able to be scraped apart and there is no concern for “chok tochos” (a separate din stating the letters cannot be formed by scraping off ink) and it does not matter if this happened before the letter was formed or after.</p>\n<p>So my question is this, if a letter touches another <strong>during</strong> it’s writing (a ז written so close to a ד that the Kepel of the zayin touches the kepel of the Dalet) how can this letter be scraped apart after and still be kosher? Seemingly it lacked Beis Yosef’s requirement above that it be mukaf gvil <em>at the time</em> of writing? (According to his second possibility of what it means to be mukaf gvil)</p>\n<p>Also to strengthen my question, Mishnah berurah says regarding a ך that touches the bottom of the klaf that even if it already had its requisite tzurah (meaning it was already a kosher ך before it touched the bottom), the shulchan aruch is coming to add a chidush and tell us all the while the sofer’s hand has not left the letter it is considered “the time of writing” (Mishnah berurah to 32:16 ד״ה רגל)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A hole intercepting a letter and two letters touching are two separate aspects of Mukaf Gevil.</p>\n<p>First to understand what’s behind the Beit Yosef’s reasonings:</p>\n<p>In Menachot 29a it is taught:</p>\n<p>דאמר רב יהודה אמר רב כל אות שאין גויל מוקף לה מארבע רוחותיה פסולה\nRav Yehuda says that Rav says: any letter that does not have parchment surrounding it is invalid.</p>\n<p>Later in 29b it is taught:</p>\n<p>ראמי בר תמרי דהוא חמוה דרמי בר דיקולי איפסיקא ליה כרעא דוי\"ו דויהרג בניקבא אתא לקמיה דרבי זירא א\"ל זיל אייתי ינוקא דלא חכים ולא טפש אי קרי ליה ויהרג כשר אי לא יהרג הוא ופסול\nRami bar Tamrei the father-in-law of Rami bar Dikulei had the vav of ויהרג perforated by a hole and he came before Rabbi Zeira. He [Rabbi Zeira] said to him: go to a child who is neither wise nor stupid. If he reads it ויהרג it is valid. If not, then it’s יהרג and it is invalid.</p>\n<p>The Beit Yosef (32:23) questioned how is it possible to validate a letter that is not surrounded by parchment on all four sides. He brings two lines of reasoning as to how this is possible.</p>\n<p>His first line of reason is that according to Rashi on the statement of Rav Yehuda, this means that two letters are touching each other. Then according to this logic, the only time when a hole would invalidate letter is if it intervenes between two letters. So if a hole only touches one letter, even if it was at the time of writing, then the letter remains valid as long as it does not change its form.</p>\n<p>His second line of reason is that, concerning a hole, the din of mukef g’vil only applies at the time of writing. Should a hole appear after writing was completed and the letter is still recognizable, then the letter remains valid as according to the Rambam Hilchot Tefillin Chapter 1 Halacha 20.</p>\n<p>Concerning Shulchan Aruch 32:18, this falls in line with the first line of reasoning where whenever two letters touch it lacks Mukaf Gevil. Even after writing (Mishnah Berurah 32:78)</p>\n<p>As for why one just needs to separate the letters, it is because each letter was properly written (Shulchan Aruch 32:18). Meaning, the letters are recognizable as separate letters. However there are cases where two letters touching forms a new letter. For example כו to מ or ינ to צ. In those cases the chok tochot would apply.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind there are other opinions (Radak and Rashba) that hold that when two letters touch at the time of writing then the letters are possul due to Ketiva Tama. The Keset Hasofer is stringent and holds that if the touch occurs at the time of writing then it’s possul and the second letter must be erased. (Keset Hasofer 8:15)</p>\n\n\n",

For additional information, please see the published article by Mark S. Goettel, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/rwe/10.1007/978-1-4020-6359-6_944\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Diseases of Grasshoppers and Locusts\"</a>, Encyclopedia of Entomology, 2008, pp. 1229 - 1233.</p>\n<p>As a summary: locusts are herbivorous, they do not prey on humans and animals. Locusts do not bite, even if they nibble they never pierce the skin. Diseases that locusts carry are not harmful to humans. Although they damage crops, they have been used as food throughout human history. These signs and behavior make locusts similar to kosher animals.</p>\n<p><strong>What are locusts</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Locusts, a type of short-horned grasshopper in the Acrididae family, are primarily plant-eaters and do not typically bite humans like mosquitoes or ticks. Locusts differ from regular grasshoppers as they have long wings and can swarm, while grasshoppers' wings are shorter and they do not swarm. The picture below shows same locust appearance in two different phases: solitary phase (non-swarming), gregarious phase (swarming).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A5lV9r8J.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/A5lV9r8J.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Are locusts harmful to humans and animals?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Locusts are not dangerous to people or pets. ... Although locusts are primarily herbivorous, they sometimes exhibit nibbling behavior towards humans without causing severe harm. Locusts do not attack or bite humans in the same manner as mosquitoes or ticks. Their bites, if they occur, are unlikely to break the skin, leading only to mild irritation or itching.</p>\n<p>Individuals with allergies to locusts might experience respiratory symptoms due to swarms... Contact with large swarms can create respiratory issues due to dust particles generated by these insects. Some scientific studies also suggest a potential for allergic reactions in individuals exposed to large swarms.</p>\n<p>Despite their formidable appearance, locusts do not seek out humans or animals as prey, focusing instead on vegetation in their environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Do Grasshoppers carry diseases or parasites?</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Locusts do not pose a direct threat to humans or animals, nor do they transmit diseases harmful to humans. Paranosema (Nosema) locustae, a microsporidian parasite, infects most locust species and is being utilized as a biological control agent. This parasite poses no threat to human health and can consume its weight (approximately 2 grams) in a day. The parasite acidifies locusts' lower guts, inhibiting bacteria that produce swarm-inducing pheromones, leading to fewer pheromones in infected locust droppings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Locusts may pose danger to agriculture</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Locusts themselves are not aggressive towards humans or animals, although their swarming behavior can significantly impact agriculture by stripping vegetation and causing extensive environmental damage. Locust swarms can reach speeds of up to 8 miles per hour and cover distances of 80 miles in a single day, posing severe challenges to farmers by destroying crops. Understanding their behavior, implementing effective control strategies, and advancing predictive technologies are crucial for mitigating their impact on food security, particularly in regions of Africa and Asia where smallholder farmers are most vulnerable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we know, in areas damaged by locusts people have used these locusts as food throughout history.</p>\n<p><strong>Kashrus of Locusts</strong></p>\n<p>According to the article by Zohar Amar, <a href=\"https://halachicadventures.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/TU11_Amar.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Eating of Locusts in Jewish Tradition After the Talmudic Period\"</a>, The Torah u-Madda Journal, 11, 2002-03, pp. 186 - 202:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A reliable tradition was preserved until our own times only regarding the arbeh (locust) and only among the Jews of Yemen and some of the Jews of North Africa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.30.27?ven=hebrew%7CTanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishlei 30:27</a>, <em>arbeh</em> is described as \"The arbeh-locusts have no king, yet they all march forth in formation,\" signifying their ability to organize.

There's no specific prohibition for other Jews to do that, it's just not their obligation)</p>\n<p>Therefore if one can trace one's paternal lineage to a Kohen that servd in the Beis Hamikdash, that's a definite status verification, because the Sanhedrin would not allow anyone who wasn't able to trace their lineage at that time back to Aharon to serve in the Beis Hamikdash (Rambam).</p>\n<p>Similarly, prior to a couple hundred years ago or so, there was no such thing as a \"reform\" or an \"invalid\" conversion, and therefore there was never a doubt as to who was Jewish and who wasn't.</p>\n<p>If one finds a kesuba, for example, between one's maternal ancestors, that's a definite verification, because the Sofer that wrote it definitely wouldn't have done so unless he had other ways of verifying they were Jewish.</p>\n<p>It's assumed that either of one's parents at a certain time kept the laws of the Torah, then either they have an unbroken maternal lineage to the original Jews at Mount Sinai, or am unbroken maternal lineage at least to a convert, and all converts (until recently) were completely Jewish</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/when-to-believe-one-who-claims-to-be-jewish/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a> for this idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The law of a questionable Jew: If one is unsure if his mother is\nJewish, then he is considered a gentile, until proof is found of his\nmother’s Jewish identity.[8] [Thus, there is no such concept as a\nquestionable Jew, if he has question as to whether his mother was\nJewish, as one is considered a gentile until he determines that his\nmother is Jewish.] However, the concept of a questionable Jew does\napply in a case that a person claims to be Jewish [either due to\nhaving a Jewish mother, or due to conversion] but his claim contains\nsuspicion, or requires Halachic proof according to the Poskim. Below\nwe will discuss when we believe a person’s claim of being Jewish and\nwhen we require proof of his claim.</p>\n<p>Marrying a Jew: If a person who was known to be a gentile, claims that\nhe went through a Kosher conversion and became Jewish, he is not\nbelieved to be allowed to marry a Jew unless he supplies witnesses [or\nother proof of his conversion], or reconverts. This applies even if\nthis person now acts like an observant Jew. If, however, the person\nwas always held to be Jewish, and now says that in truth he converted,\nthen he is believed without witnesses.[17] Now, although some\nPoskim[18] argue that even such a person must bring witnesses,\nnevertheless, the custom is like the former opinion.[19] [In Israel,\nthe Rabbanut requires all foreigners to prove their Jewish identity\nand provide authorized conversion papers, in order to be allowed to\nmarry, or make Aliyah.]</p>\n<p>Other matters, such as Tefillin:[20] The above requirement for a\ngentile to bring proof of his conversion even if he is now an\nobservant Jew, only applies with regards to allowing him to marry a\nJew. However, regarding all other matters of Judaism [such as\nTefillin, Minyan etc], if he acts as an observant Jew he is believed\nto have converted even if he does not bring proof of his\nconversion.[21]</p>\n<p>How to verify the claims of a person who says that his mother is\nJewish:[22]</p>\n<p>As explained in B, the custom today is to require proof of Jewishness\nfor people who come from out of the country, from areas where\nassimilation was common, and in any case that there is reasonable\ndoubt. The Batei Dinim have several ways of verifying a person’s claim\nof Jewishness. Some Poskim[23] suggest the following criteria:</p>\n<p>Checking the legal identification cards of the person or his mother,\nand seeing if it says that he or she is Jewish. Verifying the Jewish\nnames of the person and his family. Knowledge of Yiddish, and acting\nlike a Jew or knowledge of Jewish customs. The person in question must\nfulfill at least two of the above three conditions to be considered a\nJew, and there must not be any other reason to cast doubt on his\nJewishness.[24] In today’s times, one also heavily relies on the\nopinion of an investigator who is trained and experienced in verifying\nwhether the person’s claim is true or not. [So is done today in all\nBatei Dinim].</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question is an important one and I'd answer it in a few different ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I would hold Kohanim to a separate standard from the rest of the Jewish community. Due to the importance of that line, the Kohanim end up encompasses a very protected population bubble. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y-chromosomal_Aaron\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>There have even been studies which show Kohanim carry a very unique DNA type which is even separate from the wider common Jewish community genetic subtype.</strong></a> This implies we managed to maintain the purity of the Kohanim line even if we don't have a direct link or evidence back to Aaron, himself.</li>\n<li>While \"in theory\" you could make the argument that every Jewish line going back far enough could be invalid, the fact is we have evidence to the contrary. <a href=\"https://www.israelhayom.com/2024/05/19/are-you-genetically-linked-to-all-other-jews/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>For example, the DNA answer I gave previously also applies to Judaism as a whole.</strong></a> The Jewish people, regardless of their sub-community or location, all generally share the same common ancestral lineage back to Israel.

Rashi explains this as referring to the line that the heavens traverse from one side of the sky to the other, and Radak understands it as a metonym for the structure of the heavens, the metonym deriving from the fact that plumb lines (which is the meaning of קו in multiple verses, such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.21.13?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">II M'lachim 21:13</a>, see Rashi ad loc.) are essential in building structures.<sup>d</sup></p>\n<p>Additionally, the introduction of a new topic (the sun) at the end of verse 5 (and continuing into the following verse) is not atypical in Tanach, and it is not clear why this provoked Erlich's concern.</p>\n<p>Footnote to verse 6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6  Nach Kimchi wäre der Sonnenball mit einem aus der Brautkammer kommenden Bräutigam verglichen, weil er wie dieser sicherlich zum Ausgangspunkt zurückkehrt. Danach ware der zweite Vergleich hinzugefugt, um zu sagen, dass, bei aller Liebe fur das Zelt, der Weg, der zeitweilig davon trennt, dennog freudig unternommen wird.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6 According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Psalms.19.6.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kimchi</a> [the Radak citing his father <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kimhi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R' Yosef Kimchi</a>], the sun's orb would be compared to a bridegroom coming forth from the bridal chamber because it, like the him, surely returns to its starting point. Then, the second comparison would be added in order to say that, with all the love for the tent, the path that temporarily separates him from it is nevertheless joyfully undertaken.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Footnote to verse 7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7  Für מֵחַמָּתוֹ lies מֵחֲמָתוֹ = ejus impetu, d.h. dank ihm oder durch ihn. Das Wort findet sich in diesem Sinne in der Mischna sehr oft, z.B. Baba kamma 8,1. Der Sinn ist also der: der Sonne und ihrem Umlaufe ist es zu verdanken, dass überall Licht ist und nichts im Dunkeln bleibt. Die traditionelle Erklärung scheitert schon daran, das die Hitze eine Plage ist, der Sonnenball aber hier mit einem glücklichen Bräutigam, der, weit entfernt, irgend jemandem ein Leid zuzufügen, jeden freundlich anlächelt. Dazu kommt noch, das Hitze חֹם nicht חַמָּה heisst. Den das poetische חמה = Sonne, welches stets mit לבנה und nie mit ירח gepaart wird, mit Hitze nichts zu tun hat, sondern eigentlich die Dunkle heisst, wie לבנה die Weisse bedeutet. So gefasst, vermittelt auch das dritte Glied gewissermassen den Uebergang zu dem Folgenden, welches sonst ausser allem Zusammenhang ist.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>7  For מֵחַמָּתוֹ, read מֵחֲמָתוֹ = <em>ejus impetu</em> [his impetus], i.e., \"thanks to him\" or \"through him\". The word is found in this sense very often in the Mishnah, e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Bava_Kamma.8.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Baba Kamma 8:1</a>. So the meaning is this: thanks to the sun and its orbit, there is light everywhere and nothing remains in darkness. The traditional interpretation fails on the grounds that heat is a plague, whereas here the sun's orb is depicted as a happy bridegroom who, far from intending to harm anyone, smiles kindly at everyone. Furthermore, the word חֹם is not called חַמָּה. The poetic חמה = sun, which is always paired with לבנה and never with ירח, has nothing to do with heat, but rather means the dark one, just as לבנה means the white one. Understood in this way, the third clause also provides, in a sense, the transition to what follows, which otherwise stands out of all context.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ehrlich's analysis is dubious for multiple reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The sense of \"מחמת\" meaning \"on account of\" is first attested in Mishnaic Hebrew.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Heat is not necessarily a plague, and there are multiple verses describing heat in a positive way (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">I M'lachim 1:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.4.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Koheles 4:11</a>. As such, the beneficially warm sun fits the context of the passage. Incidentally, when spelled חַמָּה, the word refers to the sun and related properties (especially warmth), and negative words that mean fury or venom are spelled differently (the letters are the same, as they are for Ehrlich's proposed מֵחֲמָתוֹ, but those words lack the <em>dagesh forte</em> and have different vowelization).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The traditional pairing of חמה with לבנה does not imply that חמה is etymologically derived from its color, and it seems odd that it would be described as \"the dark one\" considering its characteristic brightness. Indeed, the appellation \"חַמָּה\" is used for the sun in conjunction with its ability to shine light and dispel darkness (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.30.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Iyov 30:28</a>, \"קֹדֵר הִלַּכְתִּי בְּלֹא חַמָּה\").</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>a</sup><sub>The continuation of the footnote reads: \"...Ortsname ist.

An example of intentional artlessness in speech is found in אביעה לכם רוחי (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.1.23?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Proverbs 1:23</a>). But before this can be demonstrated, it must first be noted that the first verse there does not read, 'Turn to my rebuke,' as it is generally rendered, for תשובו is not an imperative, nor does שוב mean to turn to something. תשובו לתוכחתי means, 'You will still return to my rebuke,' i.e., you will still remember it and the one from whom it comes. This is said with reference to the day of trouble, when, according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.1.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">verse 28</a>, the fools are supposed to call on wisdom, but only to be ignored by her. According to this, אביעה לכם רוחי means, 'I will tell you my intention, i.e., what I intend for you, bluntly.' A more striking example is the artless speech resulting from carelessness. This can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.15.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Proverbs 15:2</a>, which correctly translates as follows: 'The tongue of the wise man clothes good sense beautifully, but the mouth of the fool utters bare folly.' That is, the wise man strives to present good sense beautifully, but the fool speaks his folly as his beak suggests, and never considers it worthwhile to make up for what his speech lacks in content with form. On תיטיב, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.9.30?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">2 Kings 9:30</a>. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emil_Friedrich_Kautzsch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kautzsch</a>, who, following Dysernick, changes תיטיב to תַטִּיף and renders יַבִּיעַ as 'bubbles,' parodies the beautiful saying by depriving it of the punch line without which no saying deserves the name. Furthermore, the Old Testament speaks of dripping lips, but never of a dripping tongue, and in this image, the dripped thing is always honeycomb, which can actually be dripped, but not something like דעת, however that may be understood.\"</sub></p>\n<p><sup>Endnote 24</sup><sub> English translation: \"Regarding 19:4. Let us remember once and for all that a large, if not the majority, of the Psalms were written a full six hundred years after Amos, Hosea, and Isaiah, and that a living language, in its development over such a long period of time, must undergo many changes and receive many additions. Therefore, one must be prepared from the outset to find many entirely new words in the Psalter, and many of the old ones used differently than in the writings of the prophets, whose language is closest to poetry. If one considers this, one will find much in our explanations understandable that may seem strange at first glance.\"</sub></p>\n\n\n",

And our teacher Rav Hai Gaon, of blessed memory, wrote that the same applies to any woman who exposes a handbreadth in a normally-covered area of her body: it is prohibited to recite [the Shema] facing her, for “a handbreadth in a woman is [considered] nakedness (ervah).” Similarly, one may not recite [the Shema] while she is singing, for “a woman’s voice is ervah.” However, [reciting] opposite her face, or opposite a place that is not typically covered, or when she is speaking in her usual manner—is permitted. And even when she is singing, if he is able to focus his heart on his prayer in such a way that he does not hear her and does not pay attention to her, it is permitted, and he should not interrupt his recitation. <strong>Likewise, when a handbreadth is exposed, the prohibition applies only when one gazes at it; but seeing it incidentally (i.e., without gazing) is permitted.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Similarly, notice his allowance when hearing a woman's singing voice if one is able to tune it out.)</p>\n\n\n",

If he took the vow on\nthe Sabbath or a festival, he is permitted on that Sabbath or\nfestival. Afterwards, he is forbidden forever.\nThe rationale is that there is a doubt concerning the\nquestion whether the son of David will come on a Sabbath or festival\nor not. Since the matter is an unresolved question, on the day he\ntook the nazirite vow, the nazirite restrictions do not apply to him.\nFor whenever there is a question whether the nazirite restrictions\napply, we rule leniently.<br />\nהָאוֹמֵר 'הֲרֵינִי נָזִיר בְּיוֹם שֶׁבֶּן דָּוִיד בָּא בּוֹ': אִם בַּחֹל נָדַר - הֲרֵי\nזֶה אָסוּר לְעוֹלָם; וְאִם בַּשַּׁבָּת אוֹ בְּיוֹם טוֹב נָדַר -\nאוֹתָהּ שַׁבָּת אוֹ אוֹתוֹ יוֹם טוֹב מֻתָּר, מִכָּאן וְאֵלֵּךְ אָסוּר\nלְעוֹלָם. שֶׁהַדָּבָר סָפֵק אִם יָבוֹא בַּשַּׁבָּת\nוְיוֹם טוֹב אוֹ לֹא יָבוֹא, וְהוֹאִיל וְהוּא סָפֵק, בְּיוֹם שֶׁנָּדַר</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n<li>לֹא חָלָה עָלָיו נְזִירוּת, שֶׁסָּפֵק נְזִירוּת לְהָקֵל. מִכָּאן וְאֵלֵּךְ חָלָה עָלָיו נְזִירוּת.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note 26 elaborates:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam’s ruling is based on Eruvin 43b. The Kessef Mishneh\ninterprets the Rambam’s understanding of that passage as follows:\nThere is a question whether the prohibition against going beyond one’s\nSabbath boundaries (see Hilchot Shabbat, ch. 27) applies ten\nhandbreadths above the ground or not. Thus there is a question whether\nMashiach - who obviously will observe the Sabbath laws - can come on\nthe Sabbath for that will require him descending from heaven and thus\ngoing beyond his Sabbath boundaries. (Kin’at Eliyahu questions the\nentire issue, noting that according to the Rambam, Mashiach will be a\nflesh and blood human being who will “wage the wars of G‑d... build\nthe Temple” (see Hilchot Melachim 11:1). Nowhere does the Rambam make\nmention of him descending from heaven.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, at least according to some opinions, he can't come on the Shabbos itself. But nowhere is it mentioned that he can't come on Friday -\nif that were the case, then that would contradict the halacha here, which says that if one made the vow on Friday (which is during the week), it would be effective.</p>\n<p>If one were to ask, however, whether or not Moshiach will come on shabbos according to all opinions, because this generation is different than the generations of the Rambam and the Gemara, which would require it to be violated, that would be a different question.</p>\n<p>The implication of that question is that nothing that existed in the times of the Gemara or the Rambam, including the nusach of our tefillos (which were composed by the men of the Great Assembly),</p>\n<p>\"speedily send the scion of David\" (moshiach),</p>\n<p>And the bracha to get rid of the heretics and the evil kingdoms of exile (which was composed during the time of the Gemara),</p>\n<p>and the fact that the Rambam says in the end of the laws of kings that one should \"deeply hope\" (מחכה) for him all the time, and the fact that</p>\n<p>\"all of the wise people of Yisroel have hoped for the days of moshiach.. to be free from the kingdoms that don't allow them to engage in the Torah and it's commandments properly\",</p>\n<p>And the fact that the Jewish people even in their times were being scattered all of the world and oppressed (which is why they were forced to write down the Talmud, even though they weren't supposed to, because of the great and pressing needs of the time),</p>\n<p>And the Roman oppression and the crusades and many many other oppressions of the entire Jewish people since the destruction of the second Beis Hamikdash until the time of the Rambam,</p>\n<p>All of that wouldn't apply, since the opinion that said he can't come on shabbos also knew about all of those things, but still said it.</p>\n<p>It's a bit of a dochak to say that nowadays moshiach arriving is such a life threatening emergency, requiring the violation of shabbos, more so than millions of Jews literally being attacked and driven from their homes constantly etc.  in the times of the Gemara/Rambam...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.43b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in Eruvin 43b</a>) says explicitly that although one might think that Mashiach will not come on Erev Shabbat/Yom Tov, that is not the case, and in fact it can happen on Erev  Shabbat/Yom Tov.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קָא סָלְקָא דַּעְתָּךְ מִדְּאֵלִיָּהוּ לָא אֲתָא, מָשִׁיחַ נָמֵי לָא\nאָתֵי, בְּמַעֲלֵי שַׁבְּתָא לִישְׁתְּרֵי! אֵלִיָּהוּ לָא אָתֵי,\nמָשִׁיחַ אָתֵי.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Best Iyun Shiurim in the world\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recognize that \"best\" is a very subjective term, plus, what one person thinks is the \"best\", is probably due to their extremely limited perspective of Iyun Shiurim.\nMy definition of \"best\" is gauged by the Maggid shiur's ability to cut away all the extraneous fancy svaros and whatnot and get to the <strong>intent of the author</strong>. I am someone who believes that just because something \"can be\" true in the Rambam, does not automatically make it true, and a shiur that is just trying to be fancy and not trying to understand what the author meant is not worth listening to. The gauge used for the veracity of a svara (and quality of a shiur) is if it is \"מוכרח\", meaning that the svara MUST be the intent of the author, either because the author says so in other place, or because the other options don't make sense. So far, I have found Rabbi Tzvi Berkowitz and certain shiurim coming out of the Beis Medrash of כסא רחמים, which follows the דרך הלימד of הרב מאיר מאזוז, who wrote a sefer on דרכי העיון. Anyone have any other suggestions? So far I have tried out a bunch of shiurim YuTorah although not Rabbi Werblowsky's shiur, which I hear is quite good.</p>\n\n\n",

Gemera in Avodah Zara 8a says the following:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״תָּנוּ רַבָּנַן: יוֹם שֶׁנִּבְרָא בּוֹ אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן, כֵּיוָן שֶׁשָּׁקְעָה עָלָיו חַמָּה, אָמַר: אוֹי לִי, שֶׁבִּשְׁבִיל שֶׁסָּרַחְתִּי עוֹלָם חָשׁוּךְ בַּעֲדִי, וְיַחְזוֹר עוֹלָם לְתוֹהוּ וָבוֹהוּ, וְזוֹ הִיא מִיתָה שֶׁנִּקְנְסָה עָלַי מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם. הָיָה יוֹשֵׁב בְּתַעֲנִית וּבוֹכֶה כׇּל הַלַּיְלָה, וְחַוָּה בּוֹכָה כְּנֶגְדּוֹ.״</p>\n<p>\"On the day that Adam the first man was created, when the sun set upon him he said: Woe is me, as because I sinned, the world is becoming dark around me, and the world will return to the primordial state of chaos and disorder. And this is the death that was sentenced upon me from Heaven. He spent all night fasting and crying, and Eve was crying opposite him.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although the sun was setting because nighttime was coming, Adam and Chava did not know this and started doing teshuvah for the sin of the eitz hadaat they did, even though the setting of the sun had nothing to do with their sin, but nonetheless it can be considered teshuvah.</p>\n<p><strong>Answer to the contradiction:</strong> The Eitz Yosef in Bamidbar Rabah 13:3 ד״ה אי אפשי answers that the Midrash in Beresheit Rabah, etc are discussing teshuvah he did after not wanting to do teshuvah when asked to by Hashem.</p>\n<p><strong>B.</strong> <strong>Did Hashem forgive Adam for this teshuvah, and why yes or no?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>In Pirkei Derebbi Eliezer 20:9, it says:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״אמר אדם לפני הקב\"ה רבון כל העולמים העבר נא חטאתי מעלי וקבל את תשובתי וילמדו כל הדורות שיש תשובה ואתה מקבל תשובת השבים. מ<strong>ה עשה הקב\"ה פשט יד ימינו והעביר את חטאתו מעליו וקבל את תשובתו</strong> שנאמ' חטאתי אודיעך ועוני לא כסיתי סלה מן העולם הזה וסלה מן העולם הבא.״</p>\n<p>\"Adam said before the Holy One, blessed be He: Sovereign of all worlds ! Remove, I pray Thee, my sins from me and accept my repentance, and all the generations will learn that repentance is a reality. <strong>What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He put forth His right hand, and accepted his repentance, and took away from him his sin</strong>, as it is said, \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord; and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah\" (Ps. 32:5). Selah in this world and Selah in the world to come.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here, we see that at the end of the day, Hashem accepted Adam's teshuvah.</p>\n<p><strong>However, the Gemera in Shabbat 55b says the following:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>״אָמְרוּ מַלְאֲכֵי הַשָּׁרֵת לִפְנֵי הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא: רִבּוֹנוֹ שֶׁל עוֹלָם! מִפְּנֵי מָה קָנַסְתָּ מִיתָה עַל אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן? אָמַר לָהֶם: מִצְוָה קַלָּה צִוִּיתִיו וְעָבַר עָלֶיהָ. אָמְרוּ לוֹ: וַהֲלֹא מֹשֶׁה וְאַהֲרֹן שֶׁקִּיְּמוּ כׇּל הַתּוֹרָה כֻּלָּהּ, וּמֵתוּ! אָמַר לָהֶם: ״מִקְרֶה אֶחָד לַצַּדִּיק וְלָרָשָׁע לַטּוֹב וְגוֹ׳״!״</p>\n<p>\"The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, why did You penalize Adam, the first man, with the death penalty? He said to them: I gave him a simple mitzva, and he violated it. They said to Him: Didn’t Moses and Aaron, who observed the whole Torah in its entirety, nevertheless die? The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to them, citing the verse: “All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wicked etc.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> From this Gemera it seems that he didn't fully accept Adam Harishon's teshuvah?!</p>\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong> In Sefer קשת יהונתן ו,ב, Rebbi Yonatan Eybeschutz explains that Hashem didn't fully accept his teshuvah since its equivalent to the Gemera in Chagigah 15a, of one which ידע רבונו ומרד, knows his master and rebells, and the same applies with Adam Harishon.</p>\n<p><strong>C. With regards to both the Eitz Hadaat and Eitz Hachaim being next to each other in the middle of the garden:</strong></p>\n<p>In Beresheit 2:9 Rabbeinu Bechaye says that since it is impossible for both trees to be precisely in the centre of the garden, we must assume that they had a single trunk and that the two trees branched out at a certain point above the ground, one side becoming the עץ החיים, the other the עץ הדעת. Even according to this peshat I don't understand how you can say that Hashem put a trap or tricked them to eating the eitz hadaat, what is your proof?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.94.345?vhe=hebrew%7CHebrew_Translation&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This Zohar</a> seems to imply that they didn't do Teshuva. Adam didn't even know about Teshuva, and if he had, he would have done it. It's implied that the Teshuva would have led to forgiveness and atonement:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד אמרו כד נפק קין מן קדם ה\"אמר לו אדם ברי מה אתעביד על דינך. אמר לו\nקין אבא כבר אתבשרית דמחל לי קודשא בריך הוא בנוד בלחודוי. אמר לו היאך\nהוא. אמר לו בגין דתבית ואודית קמיה. אמר אדם וכי דין הוא רב ותקיף חילא\nדתשובה ואנא לא ידיעת. שרא לשבחא למריה ולאודאה ליה פתח ואמר, (תהילים\nצ״ב:א׳-ב׳) מזמור שיר ליום השבת טוב להודות לה; כלומר טוב לשבחא ולאתבא\nולאודאה קמיה קודשא בריך הוא. (עד כאן תוספתא)</p>\n<p>And they further said: When Cain went out from before the Lord, Adam\nsaid to him, \"My son, what happened with your judgment?\" Cain replied,\n\"Father, I have already been informed that the Holy One, blessed be\nHe, has forgiven me - through the offering of only one measure of\nconfession.\" Adam said to him, \"How did that happen?\" He replied,\n\"Because I repented and confessed before Him.\" Adam then said, \"Is\nthis how powerful and great the force of repentance is - and I did not\nknow it?\" He then began to praise his Creator and give thanks to Him.\nHe opened [his mouth] and said: (Tehillim 92:1-2) \"A Psalm, a Song for\nthe Shabbat day. It is good to give thanks to the Lord.\" That is, it\nis good to praise, repent, and give thanks before the Holy One,\nblessed be He.</p>\n<p>(End of the supplemental passage)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I read in a sefer by some Ashkenazi gadol (I'm still looking for the source) that Adam didn't do proper teshuva, as he tried to justify his actions. Correct teshuva is simply admitting you're a human that made a mistake and needs mercy, like a son in front of a father. If a son tried to justify why his father should forgive him, it would detract significantly from the apology.</p>\n<p>So Adam did basic teshuva, but not on a high enough level.</p>\n\n\n",

Either way, that's over a year before Sh'lach happens. So why is this story only brought now?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I'm aware that Rashi later (passuk 41) says in the name of Rabbi Moshe Hadarshan that shabbos is put next to the Korban of Avoda Zara and tzitzis because all three are weighed against the entire Torah, however this doesn't answer my question for two reasons: the story could still be brought earlier, and we could talk about shabbos as a general mitzvah here; also, we could in theory leave all three of these parshiyas together, but put them in the correct position chronologically.</p>\n<p>I'm also aware that אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה.

Because \"...heferu Toratekha/they have annulled your Torah.\" What is, \"They have annulled your Torah?\" The Supernal Torah [which is the secret of the Zeir Anpin], for it is nullified if it is not carried out with these repairs of it [which follow]; and this [verse] is said concerning the Atik Yomin/Ancient of Days. One verse states [Deut. 33:29], \"Ashreikha Yisrael, mi khamokha/Fortunate are you, Yisrael; who is like you?\" whereas another verse states [Ex. 15:11], \"Mi khamokha ba'elim Hashem/Who is like You among the mighty, Hashem?\" He called to Rabbi Elazar his son [whose soul was rooted in Chokhmah] and sat him in front of him, and Rabbi Abba [whose soul was rooted in Binah, he seated] from the other side [while R. Shimon's soul was rooted in Daat] and said, \"Anan klala dekhola/We are the embodiment of everything! Ad kan it'taknu kayamin/Up until now the Pillars have been repaired.\" They were silent, heard a sound, and their knees [aRKuVatan] trembled [lit. kissed each other]. What was the sound?

Know that there are pathways of the Torah which contain very profound hitbonenut [contemplation; understanding; insight; discernment]; that it is impossible to come to this hitbonenut except by way of wealth. Just as with the simple teachings of the Torah, \"Im ein kemach ein Torah/If there is no flour, there is no Torah\" [Avot 3] — and in any case a person needs sustenance — so accordingly for this hitbonenut which is extremely great it is necessary for him to have very great riches; to have great hon/wealth without any lack in it whatsoever. For, one needs all the abundance of the world for this hitbonenut.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the children of Yissakhar, who had this hitbonenut, in the aspect of, \"Umibnei Yissakhar yod'ei vinah/And of the children of Yissachar, [people] knowing discernment...\" [I Chron. 12:33], were not privileged to this except by way of wealth, as in, \"Yissakhar chamor garem/Yissakhar is a {bony, strong} ass\" [Gen. 49], and its Targum is: \"rich in property.\" Therefore Moshe and all the prophets had very great riches in order to come thereby to this hitbonenut. And on account of there being this hitbonenut in the Torah therefore the Torah is called hon/wealth [see Eruvin 54b].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And similarly, whoever the Torah passed through their hands ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think Rabbi Nachman is suggesting the Torah of the Zeir Anpin, the anthropomorphism, passing through Rashbi's hands, made him wealthy,  as whoever the Torah passed through his hands became wealthy, as R Ashi who compiled the Gemara etc.\nNew Torah passing through Rabbi Nachman's hands,  per Breslev viewpoint, would imply that made him as well wealthy,  which he was. Point being aderaba they were blessed and <strong>not punished</strong>. However, R Nachman faced tremendous opposition for his teachings and big claims (e.g. the time he sat on the chair the Alter of Teplik the shochet brought him,  and he sits on it and says,  When sitting on the chair,  then one is a Man! cf. Eze. 1. And the time he raised his hands from head upwards..), and did Rashbi? Idk. So maybe <strong>they were punished?</strong> I mean perhaps they suffered biydey Shamayim but not punished like halakhicly.</p>\n\n\n",

However, notifacation cannot override the ringer switch behaviour nor can they override “Do Not Disturb” mode, which means your alarm app may could not even make any sound. Moreover, User may disallow your app to send notificaiton, which make the alarm app just useless.\nNotification cannot wake up the app, it depends on whether user response to the notifacation to bring your alarm app to foreground. moreover, Notification sounds have a maximum duration of 30 seconds. This means that once the 30 seconds is up, no more sound. If user just ignore or failed to reponse before the notification dismissed, the alarm app could not do anything more. No snooze, no sound, which is critical to an alarm app.\nApplications cannot set the volume above or below the devices set volume, nor can it suppress the sounds of other applications.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Apple has always prevented developers from setting their own alarms. Even as of iOS 26, Apple launched a new AlarmKit framework for 3rd party apps to use in order to notify their users without having to rely on notifications. However, that framework only works on simple alarms that will go off everyday at a certain fixed time or at fixed intervals. Z'manim constantly change and therefore need to be recalculated and set for each day. So, we still need to wait until apple allows the developers to set multiple alarms in advanced with AlarmKit.

    "content": "# The sin of the meraglim: slipping in order to awaken a new level of faith\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Satmar Rav (Divrei Yoel Al HaTorah, Parshas Shelach, p. 347) explains that the sin of the spies actually was so that the Jewish people would not enter Eretz Yisroel immediately:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"היתה זו בגזירת שורש — דאף ששלח משרע\"ה מרגלים על פי ה' ולא היתה הוראת שעה בלבד, כי היה הכרח לסבב כן שלא יכנסו ישראל תיכף לארץ — ואין למדין מזה למקום אחר, של נורא עלילה סיבב הדבר כדי שישארו בני הדור ההוא במדבר ולא יכנסו לארץ.\"</p>\n<p>This was by decree of [its] root — for even though Moshe Rabbeinu sent the spies by the word of G-d and it was not merely a temporary directive, there was a necessity to orchestrate it so that Israel would not enter the Land immediately — and no inference may be drawn from this to another case, for He who is awesome in counsel arranged the matter so that the people of that generation would remain in the wilderness and not enter the Land.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why? The Rebbe explains that G-d wanted the people to remain in the midbar, because the Torah was not \"blended into their bodies\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על כן משב הקב\"ה לעכבם במדבר כדי שתבלל התורה בגופן. אכן כדי שתתקיים\nהתורה יתברך הוצרך הקב\"ה לסבב עליהם עילה להתעכב במדבר בבחינת נורא\nעלילה. נסתבב עליהם ענין המרגלים כי הוצרך למען צדקו מחשבתו שבגללה\nיוכרחו ישראל להתעכב ולזכותם.</p>\n<p>וזהו שאמרו חז\"ל אמר הקב\"ה על בני אדם, על כן לטובת גני שתהיה התורה\nנבללת בגופם ולא תסור מלבם לעולם.</p>\n<p>יהיה זה ביאור דברי רש\"י 'חייהם שאני' – נותן להם מקום לטעות בדבריי,\nוכדאמרן – דטעם שעיכבן הקב\"ה במדבר על ידי המרגלים וכו' היה כדי שתבלל\nהתורה בגופם, שבזה תלוי מיישוס של ישראל.</p>\n<p>כי אילו היו נכנסים תיכף לארץ לא היה להם פנאי לעסוק בתורה, זה פונה\nלכרמו וזה פונה לזיתו, וכדי שתהיה לתורה קיום נצחי בקרב ישראל – נתן\nהקב\"ה מקום לטעות לדברי המרגלים.</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, caused them to be delayed in the wilderness so that the Torah would become blended into their very bodies. Indeed, in order for the Torah to be sustained, may He be blessed, G-d had to orchestrate a pretext for them to remain in the wilderness, in the aspect of 'Awesome in counsel.' Thus, the matter of the spies was arranged for them, because it was necessary — for the sake of His righteousness — that Israel be forced to delay, in order to merit them.</p>\n<p>And this is what our Sages said: The Holy One, blessed be He, said\nregarding human beings — therefore, for the benefit of My saplings,\nthat the Torah should be blended into their bodies and never depart\nfrom their hearts, ever.</p>\n<p>This is an explanation of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.13.2?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Edition&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi’s words: ‘By their lives, I shall give\nthem room to err in My words,’</a> as we said — that the reason G-d\ndelayed them in the wilderness through the episode of the spies, etc.,\nwas so that the Torah would become blended into their very flesh, for\nupon this depends the firm establishment of Israel.</p>\n<p>For had they immediately entered the Land, they would not have had the\nleisure to engage in Torah — this one would turn to his vineyard, that\none to his olive grove. And in order for the Torah to have eternal\nendurance within Israel, the Holy One, blessed be He, gave room for\nerror in the words of the spies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have trouble understanding the interpretation of the Satmar Rav. What is the positive outcome of people stumbling in the Torah? And why would G-d want to prevent the people from entering Eretz Yisroel and let them stay in the midbar. Why would this help in \"infusing Torah into their bodies\"?</p>\n<p>Any meforshim on this? The only one I found helpful was that from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Numbers.14.11.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim HaKadosh (Bamidbar 14:11)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their souls would undergo a process of transmigration to be able to emerge as a spiritually stronger nation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources explaining Divine Anthropopathy vs Anthropomorphism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Anthropopathy</strong> is the attribution of <strong>human emotions, feelings, cognitions, or passions</strong> to non-human entities, particularly deities. It is different from <strong>anthropomorphism</strong> that deals with the attribution of human form/body to non-human entities, and does not contradict it.</p>\n<p>Innumerable commentators poured oceans of ink to explain/apologize for Biblical anthropomorphism. But negation of anthropomorphism does not automatically negate anthropopathy.</p>\n<p>I don't recall sources that aim at coherently explaining divine anthropopathy as detached from the question of God's forms. Usually, after anthropomorphism is negated, it is somehow accepted for granted that God's feelings are similarly allegorical. However, I don't see why - I can imagine God as an abstract mind (AI) capable of emotions.</p>\n<p>What Jewish sources deal comprehensively with Biblical anthropopathy (not anthropomorphism in general)?</p>\n<p><sup> If it is not clear, the question asks for sources, not the explanation of the phenomenon.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The OP asked:</p>\n<p>\"What Jewish sources deal comprehensively with Biblical anthropopathy (not anthropomorphism in general)?\"</p>\n<p>\"If it is not clear, the question asks for sources, not the explanation of the phenomenon.\"</p>\n<p>A primary source is the Rambam: Laws of the Foundations of the Torah: 1:12</p>\n<p>IMHO (and based on the previous part of the Rambam which discusses anthropormorphism), the Rambam connects anthropopathy with the failings of a limited body.</p>\n<ol start=\"12\">\n<li>Since this is so, all such descriptions and the like which are related in the Torah and the words of the Prophets — all these are metaphors and imagery. For example, “He who sits in the heavens shall laugh” Psalms 2:4, “They angered Me with their emptiness” Deuteronomy 32:21, and “As God rejoiced” ibid . 28:63. With regard to all such statements, our Sages said: “The Torah speaks in the language of man.” This is borne out by the rhetorical question (Jeremiah 7:19): “Are they enraging Me?”</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Behold, Malachi 3:6 states: “I, God, have not changed.” Now were He at times to be enraged and at times be happy, He would change. Rather, all these matters are found only with regard to the dark and low bodies, those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is dust. In contrast, He, blessed be He, is elevated and exalted above all this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Well, \"אם לא אני לי מי לי\".

Soloveitchik (1903–1993), one of the most influential 20th-century Jewish theologians, reinterprets anthropopathic language in the Torah through the lens of his seminal work, Halakhic Man (1944). His approach bridges philosophy, halakhic thought, and religious psychology, offering a nuanced understanding of how humans relate to God’s \"emotions.\"</p>\n<p>He argues that Cognitive Anthropopathy is necessary for Religious Experience (Human beings must use emotional terms to describe God) to allow for prayer, repentance, and halakhic engagement (e.g., fearing God’s \"anger\" motivates moral behavior)</p>\n<p>On the other hand, he rejects Ontological Anthropopathy - The mistaken belief that God actually possesses human-like emotions or psychological states, which risks anthropomorphizing God, undermining transcendence.</p>\n<p>In Halakhic Man, Rav Soloveitchik describes the ideal religious personality as one who embraces anthropopathy existentially (e.g., feeling God’s \"closeness\" during prayer) while simultaneously rejecting it ontologically (knowing God is beyond human categories).</p>\n\n\n",

May I offer a speculation? Maybe because <strong>with the introduction of the inyan of the Tzaddik</strong> (surely there were tzaddikim before Shimon haTzaddik, but this is the first use of the title in Pirkei Avot), <strong>comes also the introduction of the Kabbalah and hence the change of lashon to <em>kibbel.</em></strong></p>\n<p>But I'm not sure, because it's said (in Breslev tradition) the Way of Truth was brought and renewed in the world only five times by the Tzaddik haEmet, the first being Moshe Rabbeinu, and the second being Rashbi; until Rashbi basically no new teachings were revealed.  I was taught that the concept of the Tzaddik haEmet was first revealed in the holy Idra Rabba.</p>\n<p>But <strong>conceptually, my thesis is correct,</strong> because per Prov. 11:30 Etz haChayim is the Torah, which is the fruit of the Tzadiq:<br>\nל פְּרִי-צַדִּיק, עֵץ חַיִּים; וְלֹקֵחַ נְפָשׁוֹת חָכָם.\n<br>30 The tree of life is the fruit of the Tzadik; and the Chakham takes souls.\nAnd see related <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/130941/11675\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/130941/11675</a></p>\n<p>P.S. Of course there are five \"massar,\" five transmissions, for the five Chumashim. Mi Yodea?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I’ve heard an idea that Torah Sheb’ksav can only be “accepted” once, by Moshe, and then “passed down”, as it is unchanging across generations.</p>\n<p>Torah Shebaal Peh, on the other hand, whose age was ushered in during the time of the Anshei Knesses Hagdolah (specifically by the Purim miracle when they “reaccepted” the Torah), must be reaccepted by every subsequent generation (both because of its “subjective” nature, and because there actually is new Torah Shebaal Peh added in each generation that the next generation must accept).</p>\n<p>[This might also explain why it says that Yosei ben Yoezer and Yosei ben Yochanan “received from <em>them</em>”, despite both (presumably) being students of Antigonos Ish Socho; this is because each generation accepts not just the Torah of the preceding one but of all the preceding generations, in this case Antigonos and Shimon Hatzaddik / Anshei Knesses Hagdolah.]</p>\n\n\n",

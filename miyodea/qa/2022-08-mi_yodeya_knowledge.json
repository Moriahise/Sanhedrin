    "content": "# Tzafenas Paneach and the conversion of Rus\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard in a <em>shiur</em> once that Rus' and her sister Orpa's conversion to Judaism was pending. Meaning, when they married Na'ami's sons, they converted. However, since they converted for marriage, it was dependant on their holding true to their religion. Once their husbands died and Na'ami returned to the land of Israel, Orpa decided to go back to her roots. This undid her conversion. Na'ami and Rus's whole dialogue about conversion (Yevamos 47b) was therefore to see if she'll stick to Judaism or leave it. Since she stuck with it, it was cemented forever. This was apparently the Tsafenas Paneach's understanding of the Rambam.</p>\n<p>I have never been able to find this Tsafenas Paneach. Where does he say it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems to have been written in Tzofenat Pa'aneach by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Trani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef de Trani</a>, AKA the Maharit (not the one by Rabbi Yosef Ruzin), in <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=167818&pagenum=36\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his drush on Ruth Rabbati</a> (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"או תמצי לומר שכבר נכנסה בברית מתחילה:</p>\n<p>ועוד יש לפרש, \"ישלם ה' פעלך\" בעולם הזה \"ותהי משכורתך שלמה\" בעולם הבא, דגמילות חסדים אדם אוכל משכרה בעולם הזה והקרן קיימת לו לעולם הבא. וכי תימא הא כיון דגרים מעונים בעולם הזה ויסורין באים עליהם היאך אתה אומר שיאכלו בעולם הזה, נמצא שאוכלים עולמם בחייהם; לכך נתן טעם ד\"באת לחסות תחת כנפיו\" ואתיא כהא דאמר בהחולץ: \"מפני ששהו עצמן\", וזו לא שהתה, ומייתי לה מהך קרא דכתיב \"אשר באת לחסות\" ופירש רש\"י: \"שמהרת ולא אחרת\".</p>\n<p>\"וקשה דהא ודאי אחרה לבא כל זמן שהיתה נשואה למחלון, שהרי עכשיו היתה באה להתגייר שחמותה היתה דוחה אותה דכתיב: \"שובנה בנותי לכנה וגו'\", ובגמרא: \"מאי אמרה לה, איכא תחום שבת וכו', 'באשר תלכי אלך' וכו'\". <strong>ויש לפרש שבתחילה נתגיירו בשעת נישואין, אלא שלא סמכה דעתה של רות על זה - שמא על דעת הנישואין נתגיירה</strong> כמו שמצינו בשלמה ושמשון כדכתב הרמב\"ם בפרק י\"ב מהלכות מלכים, ו<strong>הרי ערפה הלכה לה אלא שרות דבקה בה; לכך אמר לה בועז, ידעתי כי מתחילתך בואך דהיינו שידעה טיבן של ישראל \"באת לחסות\" לשם שמים ולא לשם דבר אחר</strong>.</p>\n<p>...ויראה דמחלון לא היה לו עוון כי אם שנתייאש מן הגאולה ויצא לחוץ לארץ ונעשה חולין, אבל עוון נישואין לא היה לו <strong>לפי שרות לשם שמים נתגיירה והוכיח סופה על תחילתה</strong> שנקבעה בבית לחם יהודה.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Or you might wish to say that she entered the covenant from the beginning.</p>\n<p>So we must further explanation \"May the LORD reward your deeds\" in this world \"May you have a full recompense\" in the world to come, for in the case of charity, man enjoys its reward in this world, and the he principal remains for him in the world to come. And if you shall say that since converts suffer in this world, and sufferings come upon them, how can you say that they are rewarded in this world, for you would find that they are enjoying their reward during their lifetimes; for this reason he gave the reason of \"under whose wings you have sought refuge\", and he followed the direction of he who said in chapter Hacholetz \"because they waited\" and she didn't wait, and this can be seen from the verse \"you have sought refuge\" and Rashi explained: \"That you hastened and were not late\".</p>\n<p>And this is difficult, for of course she was late, for all of the duration of time that she was married to Machlon, for only now she came to convert, for her mother-in-law tried to dismiss her, as it says: \"Turn back, my daughters go etc\", and in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.47b.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gemara</a>: \"What did she tell her, there's a Shabbat boundary etc\", 'Where you go, I shall go', etc\". <strong>And so we must explain that at first they converted when they married, but Ruth did not put her faith in this, for perhaps it was due to the marriage that she converted</strong>, as we find by Shimshon and Shlomo, as the Rambam wrote in the 12th chapter of Hilchot Melachim, <strong>and after all, Orpah left but Ruth stuck to her; for this Boaz said to her I knew when you first came, meaning, that she knew the nature of Yisrael and \"sought refuge\" for the will of Heaven and not for any other reason.</strong></p>\n<p>...And it may be seen that Machlon did not have any sin but the sin of losing hope in the redemption and his leaving of the land and becoming profane, but he did not have a sin of [illegal] marriage, <strong>for Ruth converted for the will of Heaven, and what she did in the end proved what she did in the beginning</strong>, as she settled in Beit Lechem Yehudah.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Talmudic Methodology - Books\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any books that compare and contrast the various methods of Talmud study?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I do not know if you are looking for this (cannot remember a book that discusses this), however I think this might help you.</p>\n<p>I would strongly recommend reading the chapter <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/What_is_the_Talmud%2C_II_Methodology_of_the_Talmud.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מתודיקת התלמוד</a> by Rabbi Eliezer Berkovitz</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Taragin <a href=\"https://www.etzion.org.il/en/talmud/studies-gemara/talmudic-methodology/introduction-talmudic-methodology\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do not assume that there is one method of learning Torah nor that one style is superior to another.  Such an assertion would be both arrogant and fatuous.  No one would chas ve-shalom minimize the Torah of the Penei Yehoshua or the Maharsha simply because their styles of learning didn't match ours.  To learn Torah is to fully appreciate its quintessential infiniteness.  By the same token, there has been one distinct style which has popularized itself over the last 100 years and which to a greater or lesser degree is studied in most of contemporary yeshivot - an analytic style which in its purest form is labeled the \"Brisker Derekh\".  This analytic style, which recognizes the fundamental essence of a Health as the source for its constituent halakhic particulars, was by and large practiced by the Rishonim.  Indeed, there are different variants of this approach to lamdanut but at their root they all exhibit substantial similarities.  It is the aim of these shiurim to explore this methodology.</p>\n<p>However, there is an additional hazard to the term methodology.  It assumes that within a \"derekh\" there exists one distinct system and technique for analyzing the gemara and arriving at the desired structure.  Such a premise is also erroneous.  The nature of intellectual enterprise is that objective knowledge is acquired in a highly subjective and personal manner.  I might analyze a 'sugya' from a wholly different perspective than you would even though we would arrive at similar conclusions.  There is no specific order or strategy and to adopt one is to stifle the personal initiative which is so vital to true Torah mastery.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One of the מתודיקת of Talmud-study is called the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisker_method\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brisker method</a>\". However:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>While the Brisker method has won acceptance in almost all yeshivas today, it has its opponents. These include Rabbi Avraham Yeshayahu Karelitz (1878–1953) (known as the Chazon Ish), who felt that often the existing approach to a Talmudic portion was sufficient. Additionally, the Brisker method is not widely used in modern yeshivas which stem from the Mirrer Yeshiva (originally from Russia), which instead tend to stress single, unifying themes throughout Talmudic concepts, often focusing on only one Rishon if it is seen as the most \"truthful\" approach to a Talmudic passage</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/320\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Samson writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Natziv had a different way of learning Gemmarah which was based upon clarification of the Rishonim method and is explained simply in his book the \"Haemek Shela\". The Natziv used precise language to clarify if, indeed, this was what the specific Rishon wanted to convey to us. This method is being continued by Yeshivat Mercaz Harav, as prescribed by Rav Tzvi Yehuda Kook zt\"l. Rav Kook instructed that one should learn the methodology of the Rishonim and the principle points of the Achronim and then see how they both intertwine and at what point they complete each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And on Tosfos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In order to teach Tosafot one needs to clarify its structure. The Tosafot is broken up into two parts. The first part involves a question, an explanation and three proofs. The second part consists of two proofs and one more unacceptable proof. Thus, the student realizes exactly what he does not understand, which the first step towards understanding is. If the student does not know how to get through this first stage then it will be difficult for him to figure out exactly what he doesn't understand and it will not be easy for him to learn the Gemmarah. However, if the structure of Tosafot is clear to the student and he is able to define to himself which point in the Gemmarrah needs clarification, then that point that he is missing should not detract from understanding that Gemmarah as a whole. The student will then be on his way to understanding what he is not grasping and will be better able to learn Gemmarrah .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/60530/what-learning-style-do-yekkes-have\">see this discussion</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Responsa/Rabbinic Thought on Israeli Reprisal Operations\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>During the 1950s and 60s, the IDF <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reprisal_operations_(Israel)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">carried</a> out what have become known as \"reprisal operations\" against Arab villages. Some of the operations, especially Operation Kibya, were condemned on the world stage.</p>\n<p>My question is this: did the reprisal operations as a whole, or any specific operations, receive Rabbinic treatment? In other words, are there any responsa discussing the permissibility of these operations? And if there aren't formal responsa, were there vocal Rabbis in support or against the operations as a whole? Given the moral quandaries the operations raised, I wonder if they drew the ire or approval of Rabbinic authority.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaul_Yisraeli\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Shaul Yisraeli</a> wrote a lengthy essay on the subject shortly after Qibiya, published in his book עמוד הימיני, pp. 113-139. He first noted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"מאז נסתיימה המלחמה ה\"רשמית\" של מדינות ערב בישראל ע\"י שביתת הנשק, לא פסקו מקרי הסתננות של כנופיות ערביות לשם מעשי גנבות ושוד מזוין...בחשון תשי\"ד ביצעו הכנופיות הפושעות מעשה רצח ברוטלי של משפחה שלימה בכפר יהוד. נראה הי' הדבר שהכנופיות פועלות בצורה מאורגנת בעידוד ובתמיכה של האוכלוסיא הערבית במקומות הסמוכים לגבול...היישוב שנפגע החליט כי אסור לשבת הלאה בחיבוק ידים עד שיבואו ח\"ו קרבנות נוספים. ובאחד הלילות התקיף בצורה תקיפה את היישוב הערבי קיביה, שידים מוכיחות שהכנופיות הרצחניות באו משם וקיבלו את תמיכת האוכלוסיא...העולם \"הגדול\", אשר עד כה עמד אדיש נוכח מעשי הרצח הבלתי פוסקים של אנשים מישראל, \"זועזע\" עד היסוד למעשה קיביה שלמעשה היתה רק פעולת תגמול...ושונאי ישראל הפיקו את זממם בזה שמדינת ישראל גונתה מעל במת מועצת הביטחון של האו\"ם. אנו יודעים יפה את מדת ה\"יושר\" המציינת את קו מדיניותן של המדינות המגנות. לא מפיהן אנו חיים, ולא מהן נלמוד יושר וצדק. אולם חובה מוטלת עלינו לברר את דרך תגובתו הנאותה לפי התורה...\" (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43775&pgnum=113\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pg. 113, note 4</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"Ever since the \"official\" war of the Arab countries against Israel ended by ceasefire, incidents of Arab gangs infiltrating [Israel] to steal and perform armed robbery have not ceased...in Cheshvan of 5714, one of these criminal gangs brutally murdered a family in the village of Yahud. It appeared that the gangs acted in an organized manner, supported by the Arab population that lived near the border...the village that was hurt decided that they must not sit and do nothing, waiting for the next murders, and one night fiercely attacked the Arab settlement of Qibiya, which was proven that out of that place the murderous gangs came and received support from the local population...the world \"at large\", which until now stood idly by in the face of the never-ending murderous acts against people from Israel, was \"shocked\" to its core from the Qibiya Incident which in actuality, was just a reprisal operation...and the enemies of Israel realized their scheme by [seeing] Israel rebuked from the podium of the UN Security Council. We are well aware of the level of \"integrity\" which symbolizes the general policy of the rebuking countries, and not from their mouths do we live, and not from them will we learn integrity and justice. But it is our obligation to clarify what it the proper reaction to this, according to the Torah...\"</p>\n<p>and then proceeded to analyze the issue, and finally concluded:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והיוצא מכל זה, שיש מקום לפעולות תגמול ונקם נגד צוררי ישראל ופעולה כזאת היא בגדר מלחמת מצוה. וכל\nאסון ופגע שקורה לפורעים ולבעלי בריתם ולילדיהם, הם הם שערבים לזה, והם עונם ישאו. ואין שום חובה להמנע\nמפעולות תגמול מחמת חשש שיפגעו בזה חפים מפשע כי לא אנו הגורמים, כ\"א הם עצמם ואנחנו נקיים.\n'אכן לפגוע לכתחלה בכונה בילדים, כזה לא מציני אלא בחטא ע\"ז. ע\"כ מן הראוי לשמור עצמם מלנגע בהם. וה'\nהטוב יראה בעני עמו וצרר את צורריו ושרשם מארץ חיים. ובנו יקוים מקרא שנאמר: כל כלי יוצר לא יצלח וכל\nלשון תקום אתך למשפט תרשיעי, זאת נחלת עבדי ה' וצדקתם מאתי נאם ה'. (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43775&pgnum=139\" rel=\"noreferrer\">pg. 139</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translate: \"And what may be concluded from all of this, is that there is room for reprisal and revenge operations against the enemies of Israel, and such operations are within the limits of a commanded war (milchemet mitzvah). And any tragedy that befalls the rioters, their allies and their children, they are those who are responsible for one another, and they shall carry the weight of their sins. And there is no obligation to avoid reprisal operations for fear of hurting innocents because we are not the cause [of pain inflicted upon innocents], for they themselves [are the cause] and we are clean. Indeed, however, in the case of hurting children in the first place, we have only found this in the case of the sin of idolatry. Therefore, it is appropriate to try to be careful to not hurt them. And the good LORD will see the fallen state of His nation and will destroy the enemies and remove them from the land of life. And in us will be fulfilled the verse \"No weapon formed against you shall succeed, and every tongue that contends with you at law You shall defeat. Such is the lot of the servants of the LORD, such their triumph through Me—declares the LORD.\"\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Flaws in the Kuzari Argument\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently came across something that challenged my faith. I have believed in Judaism because of the Kuzari Argument. I thought it was a very good argument. But then I came across this article (<a href=\"http://www.talkreason.org/articles/kuzariflaws.cfm#lep\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.talkreason.org/articles/kuzariflaws.cfm#lep</a>). Most of the article I was able to refute because I realized that the person misunderstood the Kuzari Argument. But the part about the Irish history myth (click on leprechauns in contents) seems to be pretty convincing. Is there anybody who can refute this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The guy seems to misunderstand the Kuzari with regard to this point as well. Of course you can rewrite history and get people to believe all sorts of things took place in the history of their country when in fact those things never happened. Particularly when you are dealing with not particularly  educated population to begin with. Because someone reading revisionist history does not have the obvious question of \"why don't I know about it?\" The answer is simple \"you weren't born yet, it never had any reason to came up and now you are being taught by the history  experts\" Ditto when mythology  turns into something people believe. The people have no intrinsic  obvious reason not to believe it.</p>\n<p>What you can't do is convince an entire country that either (1)they themselves saw something  which they didn't see but because they saw it they need to take on many, many practices and obligations and celebrate many commemorations of their seeing it or (2)their ancestors saw something and because  of what they saw they immediately     started  many, many practices and obligations and many  celebrations commemorating  their seeing it happen, when none of those things are actually  in practice. Because then you would never be able to get around the question of \"why didn't I hear about this until now?\". And if  a mythology claims to have  a practical outcome that clearly isn't the case it would perpetually  be recognized as mythology.</p>\n<p>The Kuzari is discussing the latter situation. Belief in leprechauns is the former.</p>\n<p>I've seen other variations of this question. They all involve a parallel situation where there was no obvious question of \"if this  is true then why don't I  know about it  already?\" The parallel events  are like Eliyohu on Har HaKarmel or the Mohn falling. They are also miraculous events believed to have been widely viewed but no  says that belief in those events proves the truth of Judaism.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think that the aspect of directly refuting the leprechauns has been properly dealt with by a previous answer; and I do believe it has been refuted.</p>\n<p>My answer would like to address an equally important factor in answering your question IMHO. I think this is really important and integral to the OP. It is like the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow after you deal with the leprechauns standing in the way. It is that important.</p>\n<p>René Descartes was a famous French philosopher (1596 - 1650), who (among other things of course) investigated questions of what would constitute \"proof\" of a matter?</p>\n<p>For instance, Descartes asked how you know you are not really sleeping right now and everything you are experiencing was just a dream? He grappled with this in order to truthfully understand the concept of real 100% proof.</p>\n<p>So for instance accordingly, \"Cartesian\" proof that there are no dragons would require you to have video footage of every part of the universe in front of you at once showing no dragons anywhere etc.</p>\n<p>That's great for philosophy and it has its place. However, in real life, this will not get you very far.</p>\n<p>For instance, maybe there is a chance that the bus driver is a secret terrorist or the medicine in your prescription was replaced with Jim Jones' koolaid in the middle of the night?</p>\n<p>Do you stop riding buses or stop taking your medicine?</p>\n<p>No, that would be silly. This is because life decisions on a daily basis do not require and should not entertain a need for Cartesian proof of anything, or you will never cross the street.</p>\n<p>The Kuzari principle is a holy philosophy, but it has its limits in the realm of intellect, as does everything.</p>\n<p>The great value of the Kuzari principle is that it A) Makes a lot of sense and B) is not really refuted.</p>\n<p>Is it 100% proof? Has it no weaknesses? Maybe it does have a flaw, SO WHAT??</p>\n<p>When choosing a religion and philosophy, one must choose a practical path which has been shown to be most likely true and much better than alternatives. The Kuzari principle grants that to Judaism on an intellectual level.</p>\n<p>We absolutely do not need the Kuzari to refute every possible scenario in history or every oral tale. It is 99% bulletproof (or even 88% bulletproof would be fine) and it does its job.</p>\n<p>That job is to grant a person the freedom, right, and confidence to go down the path of Judaism knowing that it is the most rational choice and option to investigate as a religion, revelation, and way of life.</p>\n<p>The Kuzari does not have to be 100% irrefutable in every way. You just need to be allowed to be convinced enough that it holds a huge amount of intellectual honesty. Such cannot be said for any other religion on Earth. Thats good enough.</p>\n<p>You never demand 100% from the bus driver, and you do not lock your medicine in a secret vault every night for fear of tampering. So why would you feel the need to demand that your initial religious guidance must deliver 100% irrefutable chances of accuracy?</p>\n<p>The real challenge is no longer the question of \"is Judaism the true path?\" The question now is how to pull off getting yourself to include Judaism in every aspect of your life. How do you pray (Talk with your Creator?) How do you live a better life? That would be a much more important trick than refuting the leprechauns.</p>\n<p>I hope I expressed this correctly. :)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>When you speak of \"The Kuzari Principle\" you are talking about the majority of book I of the Kuzari the way it is usually presented in <em>kiruv</em> contexts or other inspirational programs. Something like this:</p>\n<p>No one could invent a story that alleges all of the target’s audience’s ancestors experienced some miraculous or otherwise special event. It is implausible that a lie could be consistently retold by millions. And, the audience’s reaction would be one of disbelief, “Why does he know all about this event, and we never heard of it before from our grandparents?” Since Judaism uniquely makes claims of national miracles and national revelations, events with audiences of millions who are the ancestors of nearly all of the target audience (excepting <em>geirim</em>) this gives Judaism a unique claim to authenticity. The commonality of the story amongst so many and the acceptance of the story by their descendants is unique. (In contrast, Jesus’s alleged miracles were only said to be witnessed by at most the 500 attendees of the wedding at Cana, and the target audience isn’t primarily the descendants of those guests.)</p>\n<p>However, I do not believe this is the Kuzari’s point. Before I get to what I believe Rabbi Yehudah haLevi really is saying in book 1, this argument is flawed for two reasons:</p>\n<p>First, there are counterexamples, other cultures that had myths about their origins that they all believed. For example, the Theban origins myth. Central American myths about gods who appear and lead whole peoples. I didn't look into it, maybe the Irish myths you mention qualify too.</p>\n<p>Second, and this may explain how the counterexamples emerged, the assumption is made that the claim is made out of the blue, in a single stroke. It doesn’t account for gradual acceptance of a story. Say something starts out as a myth about a subset of the people, and it’s known to be a bed-time story. The next generation it’s “some say”. Over several generations, it can become “official history” about everyone, with no one generation expressing the disbelief that is critical to this argument.</p>\n<p>But the actual reason why I doubt that this is Rav Yehudah haLevi’s intent is because he had the king already approach a philosopher as well as a Christian Scholast, and the king already rejected philosophical proof as unconvincing. The Rabbi provides as a counterpoint to his statement (Kuzari I, par 13):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbi: That which you describe is religion based on speculation and system, the research of thought, but open to many doubts. Now ask the philosophers, and you will find that they do not agree on one action or one principle, since some doctrines can be established by arguments, which are only partially satisfactory, and still much less capable of being proved.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the Rabbi’s basis for belief is not one based on “speculation and system”. It’s not philosophical proof. Reducing his words to an argument of the style described above defeats the whole point Rav Yehudah haLevi is trying to make! As he later writes (par 63), “There is an excuse for the Philosophers. Being Grecians, science and religion did not come to them as inheritances.”</p>\n<p>The Kuzari can be seen as a response to Rav Saadia Gaon’s “Emunos veDei’os”, and on opposition to later such philosophical texts “The Guide for the Perplexed”, “The Ikkarim”. Rav Yehudah haLevi rejected the entire tendency of placing Jewish belief on Greek Philosophical underpinnings.</p>\n<p>Instead, he says that Judaism is unquestionable for the Jew because it is our heritage.</p>\n<p>What is being mistaken for the above proof is the Rabbi’s argument to the king, who didn’t yet accept this heritage as his own, and needs to assess that entire choice. But not the approach advocated for a Jew.</p>\n<p>I see a kindred — but still very different — approach in existential thought.</p>\n<p>One of my signature files, the only one that’s a self-quote, reads, “The mind is a wonderful organ for justifying decisions the heart already reached.” This echoes the King of the Kazar’s objection to the philosopher, that for any philosophical position justified by argument, there are conflicting opinions whose adherents claim equally valid arguments.</p>\n<p>The Kiruv Movement is not founded on philosophical dispute, even if many who teach in that context may think so. The most effective kiruv tool is the experience of a Shabbos. People do not accept the proofs of G-d and the Divine origin of the Torah and <em>halakhah</em> and therefore keep Shabbos. Rather, they experience Shabbos, get first-hand experience of the power of <em>halakhah</em>, and based on that believe in the authenticity of the Torah and its own claims about its origin.</p>\n<p>In addition to the experience of performing <em>mitzvos</em>, Torah study too has this defining characteristic. Torah has an elegance one finds in the most “beautiful” of mathematical proofs despite tackling concepts far less simply defined. A discussion of the laws of theft could explain a seemingly unrelated point in the laws of Shabbos with a single theory (<em>sevarah</em>) uniting both.</p>\n<p>I should be clear that I’m not speaking of the emotional reaction of liking Shabbos. Rather the experience of Shabbos, the first-hand but internal to the mind qualia of Shabbos, that that reaction is based upon. The difference between a mathematician finding a proof to be beautiful and the actual features of the proof that cause that judgement. It is as real and as objective as the experience seeing a ball. And just as I unquestioningly accept that a ball is red if I see that it’s red. I similarly accept the reality of Shabbos.</p>\n<p>To extend this metaphor: What if many of us see the ball as red, but others, perhaps even a far larger group, insist they see it and it’s blue? Would their claims shake my faith in my own group’s perception, or would I trust my own eyes? (Assuming they work in general.) Why would the claims of another faith community (even the community whose faith is agnosticism or atheism) shake my belief in Torah?</p>\n<p>Torah is based on first-hand experience of Torah, not on its “principles of faith”. My belief in those principles is because they explain that which I experience, not the other way around.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Prof. Shalom Carmy (Yeshiva University) posted something similar to Avodah (an email discussion group):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>People who throw around big words on these subjects always seem to take for granted things that I don’t.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The people who keep insisting that it’s necessary to prove things about G-d, including His existence, seem to take it for granted that devising these proofs is identical with knowing G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now if I know a human being personally the last thing I’d do, except as a purely intellectual exercise, is prove his or her existence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R’ Gil Student posted the following quote from Louis Jacobs, We Have Reason to Believe, pp. 25-26, 28-30 on Hirhurim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since Kant, these proofs [of God’s existence] have been heavily assailed…. Many theologians, nowadays, accept the validity of these refutations and admit that there can be no proof of God in the sense that there can be no proof of a mathematical formula… But they go on to remark that we can be convinced of a thing beyond of a shadow of a doubt by means other than that of mathematical proof. There is no such proof, for instance, of the existence of other human beings beside ourselves, yet we are convinced that they do exist… In other words a distinction must be drawn between proof and conviction — proof is one of the ways to conviction but there are other ways, too…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many have arrived at this conviction as the result of a personal experience which convinces them that God exists. These men would rule out of court the very discussion of whether God exists, for, they would say, if a man is truly in love he does not ask himself if he is in love. The experience of God’s Presence is sufficient…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Other thinkers, again, hold that though each of the traditional proofs in itself is unconvincing, taken together they are convincing… Granted that the proofs carry no weight as evidence, they are indications and as such have the power of supplementing each other…</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What it all amounts to is this, that while the existence of God cannot be proved if we start from the beginning, none of us do, in fact, start from the beginning. We are presented with two alternative beliefs about the ultimate reality and we have to choose between them. According to one view God exists–it is He Who created us, Who fashioned our minds and implanted the moral sense within us so that we are capable of recognizing beauty, truth and goodness and fighting ugliness, falsehood and evil. In this view the difficulty is how to account for the existence of evil. According to the other view there is no God… In this view the difficulties are how mind came from matter, how life emerged where there was no life before, how the universe itself came into being, how the good is possible of realisation and how man came to strive for it–how man as a tiny part of the universe came to pass judgment on it?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to answer your question, I cannot refute flaws in the Kuzari proof. I instead ask if you really do rely on this or any other philosophical argument as the foundation of your faith. And if you do -- should you?</p>\n<p>Judaism neither stands on proof nor ought to be about proof. (In this approach. Obviously, R’ Saadia Gaon, the Rambam, et al disagreed.) Rather, it stands on our having a relationship with Hashem and His Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

If it were spelled correctly, it should be (שלום שאול).</p>\n<p>David says to Shlomo, not to work with Yoav in partnership, like he himself had done and not to trust him. But to distance himself from Yoav. And in this way, Yoav would not control him.</p>\n<p>Further, David advises his son to deal with Yoav according to his wisdom and to not allow Yoav to die peacefully on account of Yoav's actions concerning the <em><strong>borrowed peace</strong></em>, but rather to kill him. In other words, it becomes a <strong>Midah Keneged Midah</strong>. And this explanation of the text answers (literally releases) the fifth question that Abarbanel posed at the beginning of this book.</p>\n<p>But what Abarbanel is bringing up after this is the mis-translation of the text that is used by the Christians (meaning the Catholics). They also recognize the defective spelling, but think it is referring to the level of Hell called <em><strong>Sha'olah</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember Abarbanel's commentary in its historical context. Abarbanel was dealing with the persecution by the Catholic court against the Jews in Spain which ultimately led to the expulsion and/or forced conversion of many Spanish Jews. Being one of the leaders from the house of David in Spain, he was called upon by the Spanish Monarch to defend the theology of Judaism against the Catholic doctrine of the time in his famous disputes.</p>\n<p>Abarbanel explains that the Catholics use this type of mis-translation to support the principle that if someone receives their punishment in this world, that they are freed from punishment in the World to Come.</p>\n<p>This is the basis of their argument that Yeshu received all the punishments in this world in order to free everyone else from judgement and Hell in the World to Come. In this context, Peace (שלום), is used in the sense of <em>completion</em> or <em>paying off the debt</em>.</p>\n<p>So the second bolded line is explaining the meaning of <em><strong>their</strong></em> mis-translation.</p>\n<p>And this (means), this one who is venerated here (meaning because he receives no punishment in this world for his transgressions, then he should receive it in Hell. But rather, he), will not descend to the depths of Hell on account of <em><strong>the peace</strong></em> (השלום).</p>\n<p>According to their mis-translation, the word, peace, is now spelled fully with the Vav to indicate true peace. And it is also preceded with the <strong>Indicative letter Heh</strong>, to indicate that special, known <em><strong>Peace</strong></em> or <em><strong>Perfection</strong></em>, known to Christians, namely Yeshu.</p>\n<p>And Abarbanel closes by emphasizing, \"that which I recalled is the correct (explanation).\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Where does the teaching come from that a non-Jew studying for conversion must violate Shabbat?",
    "content": "# Where does the teaching come from that a non-Jew studying for conversion must violate Shabbat?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen the answers <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/13447/is-it-a-discouraged-or-an-unacceptable-practice-for-a-gentile-to-keep-the-sabbat/13448\">here</a> that say a non-Jew may not keep Shabbat, although I would definitely take issue with the green check-marked answer there that uses Sefer Shofetim, Hilkhot Melakhim uMilchamoteihem 10:11-12 for this assertion--the cited text does not even imply such a thing, instead it discusses the idea that a בן-נח who wishes to perform a mitzva for the reward of doing so, should not be prevented.  In Pereq 9, Ramba\"m writes that an <em>idolater</em> (עכו\"ם) should be scourged if he attempts to keep Shabbat or studies Torah, or creates any religious practice, telling him he is liable for death for doing so -- but it doesn't say anything about requiring a גר תושב, nor anyone else, to deliberately <em>violate</em> Shabbat ח\"ו.</p>\n<p>From my understanding, Ramba\"m is concerned that the aku\"m should know that he is liable to punishment from Heaven if he keeps mitzvot, because by doing so he is indicating a desire to be attached to the covenant...his scourging is to prevent him from damaging himself, not to prevent him from improving himself, as Ramba\"m expounds in pereq 9.  No such pronouncement is made against a ger toshab.</p>\n<p>Where does the teaching come from that a non-Jew (a בן נח) should be compelled to violate Shabbat, even in a small way?  Certainly a non-Jew should not say the full berakha for qidush, but a non-Jew not keeping Shabbat completely as a Jew does, is a very different thing from requiring the non-Jew to actively violate Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Edit:  To be very clear here, I see it as a grave error to assert that the non-idolator non-Jew should be compelled to violate Shabbat -- Ramba\"m in Hilkhot Melakhim uMilchamoteihem and Resh Laqish in the gemara of Masekhet Sanhedrin 58b (erroneously referred to as מ\"ש by me in comments below--I was trying to shorten stuff up and was thinking Shabbat instead of Sanhedrin) are almost certainly discussing idolaters who are known to not have Jewish ancestry. The notion of compelling someone who has gone off the derekh, or whose great-great-great grandparents did, to violate Shabbat, is horrifying.  It is the same greatest problem with the notion of the \"shabbos goy\"--you don't know who is and isn't halakhically Jewish.  Just because they don't know they're Jewish doesn't mean you know that they're not Jewish.  By promulgating the teaching that a person who is not known to be a Jew should violate Shabbat, you could very well be compelling an unwitting halakhically Jewish Jew to violate a precept of Torah observance mi-Sinai.  What possible benefit is there in doing so for anyone?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The <em>gemarra</em> you cite in the comments (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.58b.25\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 58b</a>) is the source that a non-Jew is forbidden from observing Shabbos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואר\"ל עובד כוכבים ששבת חייב מיתה שנא' (בראשית ח, כב) ויום ולילה לא ישבותו ואמר מר אזהרה שלהן זו היא מיתתן אמר רבינא אפי' שני בשבת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though you are correct it says עובד כוכבים, an idol worshipper, it is well known that the Talmud when it refers to עכו\"ם it often means any non-Jew, regardless of faith or practice. In truth, the Talmud originally said גוי, non-Jew, and was censored to say עכו\"ם. This is corroborated by the <a href=\"https://bavli.genizah.org/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Friedberg Project for Talmud Bavli Variants</a>. All of their editions of the Talmud say גוי, except for the Vilna Shas (which you and I are using). This includes the <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%22%D7%A1_%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Venice edition of the Talmud</a>.</p>\n<p>The same is true for the Rambam. Although the Vilna edition of the Rambam says עכו\"ם, <a href=\"https://rambam.genizah.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">all other editions</a> on the same website say גוי.</p>\n<p>Now, this addresses the general question of a non-Jew not observing Shabbos. Normally, I would see no reason why this wouldn't include a גר תושב. However, there's a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.48b.6?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Yevamot.48b.6.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi to Yevamos 48b</a> which seems to say that a גר תושב is forbidden <em>in violating</em> Shabbos, obviously showing he could (and should) keep Shabbos. However, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.48b.6?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Yevamot.48b.6.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosafos there</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Keritot.9a.13?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Keritot.9a.13.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in Kerisos</a> disagree, and assume it's equally forbidden for a גר תושב to keep Shabbos, as with any other non-Jew. I believe this latter approach is the predominent one.</p>\n<p>You also seem to be wondering about a non-Jew studying for conversion. This is a matter of dispute. I believe most <em>halachic</em> authorities do not differentiate. However, some do. For example, Rav Asher Weiss, a contemporary and prominent Rabbi, <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=22232&pagenum=83\" rel=\"noreferrer\">rules</a> that someone in the process of conversion need not violate Shabbos. This is based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_Yeshanim_on_Yevamot.48b.2?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosafos Yeshanim to Yevamos 48b</a>, who write:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"ל דזה כיון דדעתו להתגייר מצי לשבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

G-d answers with:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>No, I will not do that</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.15.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 15:9</a>, G-d instructs Avraham to bring five different animals for sacrifice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old she-goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young bird.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the Gemara, citing this pasuk in the Torah, explains that G-d suggested to Abraham that even if his descendants will sin, they will be able to achieve atonement through sacrificing offerings.</p>\n<p>However, what to do when there is no Holy Temple standing in Yerushalayim? That is the question Avraham asks G-d. The Gemara explains as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abraham said before Him: Master of the Universe, this works out well when the Temple is standing and offerings can be brought to achieve atonement, but when the Temple will no longer be standing, what will become of them?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what to do when there is no Holy Temple standing in Yerushalayim?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G-d said to him: I have already established for them the order of offerings, i.e., <strong>the verses of the Torah pertaining to the halakhot of the offerings</strong>. <strong>Whenever they read those portions, I will deem it as if they sacrificed an offering before Me, and I will pardon them for all of their iniquities.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Gemara in for example two places discusses the relationship between Torah study and atonement for sins:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Anyone who engages in Torah study need not bring a burnt offering, nor a sin offering, nor a meal offering, nor a guilt offering (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.110a.12?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos 110a</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<p>The Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.18a.8?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 18a</a>) explains the pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.3.14?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Shmuel 3:14</a> where it says \"Assuredly, I swear concerning the house of Eli that the iniquity of the house of Eli will never be expiated by sacrifice or offering means that through Torah study and acts of kindness, \"the sin of Eli's house\" is atoned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Abaye said: With sacrifice or offering the sin of Eli’s house is not atoned, but it is atoned through Torah study and the performance of acts of kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to all the above. The Gemara explains that through Torah study, especially the sections that are speaking about the offerings, are an atonement for sins. However, Teshuva (repentance) can alse be seen as something that brings atonement for someone.</p>\n<p>Similary, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.6.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hosea</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For I desire goodness, not sacrifice; Obedience to G-d, rather than burnt offerings</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this pasuk, the Avot d'Rabbi Natan <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avot_D%27Rabbi_Natan.4.5?ven=Avot_DeRabbi_Natan,_trans._by_David_Kasher,_2019&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Once, Rabban [our rabbi] Yohanan ben Zakkai, left Jerusalem, and Rabbi Yehoshua followed after him. <strong>And he saw the Holy Temple destroyed</strong>.

Or is this just a case of someone being creative and/or sloppy, and their text being uncritically accepted by others?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You have a sharp eye.</p>\n<p>The origin of the practice of Tu Beshvat Seder is from the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/86706/759\">controversial</a> 17th century work Chemdat Yamim (<a href=\"http://www.toratemetfreeware.com/online/f_01831_part_5.html#HtmpReportNum0131_L2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:4:3:2-3</a>). Let's see how he describes why he's inventing this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומנהג טוב להולכים בתמים להרבות בפירות בעצם היום הזה ולומר דברי שירות ותשבחות עליהן כאשר הנהגתי לכל החברים אשר עמדי, ועם כי בדברי כתבי הרב זלה''ה לא נמצא מנהג זה מכל מקום לדעתי תקון נפלא הוא בנגלה ובנסתר.‏<br />\nכי הנה הובא בירושלמי פרק עשרה יוחסין ז''ל, ישמעו ענוים וישמחו אמר ר' איבון עתיד אדם לתת דין וחשבון על שראה מיני מגדים ולא אכל, רבי אלעזר הוה מצמצם פריטי למיכל בהון מכל מילי חדש ע''כ, וטעם הדבר שכשם שהנהנה מן העולם הזה בלא ברכה נקרא גזלן מפני שעל ידי הברכה גורם להמשיך שפע עליון על ידי כח הברכות והשר הממונה על אותו הפרי הוא מתמלא משפע זה כדי לגדל הפרי שנית...‏<br />\nAnd it is a good custom for those who go simply (?) to maximize fruits on that very day and say songs and praises over them as I have enacted to all the colleagues who are with me, and even though in the writings of The Rabbi [Isaac Luria?] Z\"L this custom does not appear, even so in my opinion it is an excellent fix (?) in revealed and hidden [parts of Torah].<br />\nFor behold it is brought in the Yerushalmi in chapter [four of Kiddushin] thus: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.34.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The humble shall hear and rejoice!</a> R' Ibun said \"In the future man will be judged and accounted for his seeing types of treats and not eating them; Rabbi Elazar would save money to eat with them from every new type.\" ... (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now we know why this statement from the Yerushalmi Kiddushin wound up in many Tu Beshvat Seder collections. There are a number of differences in the text (without trying to find out which variants are older and/or better) which should help answer your questions.</p>\n<p>First note the small change from חדא in our version to חדש in his version. There's your difference from \"every kind, once a year\" to \"new fruits as they came in season\". Indeed some (see Magen Avraham OC 235) bring this teaching specifically in the context of the blessing of Shehechiyanu on new fruits.</p>\n<p>Now note the inclusion of the word מגדים which I've translated as treats. Rashi (Bereishit 24:53) explains that word as meaning fruits though Radak there says it can be any choice or sweet item.</p>\n<p>However, recall the context of the Yerushalmi is a discussion of essential components of a human settlement without which one shouldn't consider it habitable. The previous line (at least in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.4.12.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">our editions</a>, since we can't know what was in his edition) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר ר' יוסי בי ר' בון אף אסור לדור בעיר שאין בה גינוניתא של ירק.‏<br />\nRebbi Yose ben Rebbi Abun said, also it is forbidden to dwell in a city which has no vegetable garden. (Sefaria's translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, in context our statement seems to be praising the importance of plant-based food options.</p>\n<p>Plus if you take the Shehechiyanu-new-fruit approach above, animal products are definitely excluded since they aren't seasonal and don't get a Shehechiyanu.</p>\n<p>In short, while it's hard to definitively exclude delicious meats and cheeses from the statement on purely linguistic grounds, there's no doubt the statement is at least intended to apply to fruit.</p>\n<p>Now did you notice R' Abbun show up twice already? Clearly in the Tu Beshvat Seder liturgy authors drew from the attribution used in the primary source of Tu Beshvat Sedarim; but note also that with the same name appearing one line earlier in the Yerushalmi there's something very suspicious about it showing up in this other variant.</p>\n<p>Finally, you asked about a special pouch. Neither version so far has mentioned that, but there is a small difference in the verb there. Chemdat Yamim's version has מצמצם which means to minimize, in the sense that he saved money by not spending it elsewhere. But our version has מצמת which means to assemble or collect, in the sense of saving money by making a physical collection, plausibly in a pouch. And indeed in a version of this statement quoted by Raavad in Ba'al HaNefesh (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8785&st=&pgnum=139\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'ar HaKedusha</a>) we find explicitly \"היה מצמת פריטין בכיסיה he would collect coins in his pocket\".</p>\n<p>T\"u ViShvat Sameach!</p>\n\n\n",

Do we know which one the descendants of Eli Kohen Gadol and his sons were members of?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The following is only a partial answer. I am not aware of any explicit source that states what mishmar Eli and his descendants were part of. According to the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Taanit.27a.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanit 27a</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Taanit.3.2?vhe=Tosefta_Ta%27anit_--_Machon_Mamre&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Taanit 3:2</a>, there were originally eight mishmarot organized by Moshe, four from Elazar and four from Itamar. According to the gemara, Shmuel doubled them to sixteen, and then David made them into twenty-four. Not much is known about the pre-Davidic mishmarot, so I don't think there's any way to know which mishmar Eli himself was a part of, but evidently he was part of one of the four Itamaric mishmarot, as Eli was a descendent of Itamar (according to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.24.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:24:3</a>, Achimelech, a descendant of Eli, was also a descendant of Itamar). His descendants until the creation of the sixteen mishmarot would have belonged to the same mishmar as he did, and later descendants, until the creation of the twenty-four, would have belonged to one of the new Itamaric mishmarot, though it is unclear how many there were (was the number split evenly between Itamar and Elazar or was it already a case of a 2:1 ratio?).</p>\n<p>Now, about his descendants from the time of the twenty-four: We can minimize the options to the eight mishmarot who were descendants of Itamar. According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.4.2.6?vhe=Mechon-Mamre&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi in Taanit 20a</a>, the second set of eight mishmarot were from Itamar, which gives us (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.24.11-14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:24:11-14</a>):</p>\n<p>ישוע, שכניהו, אלישיב, יקים, חפה, ישבאב, בלגה, אימר</p>\n<p>Yeshua, Sh'chanyahu, Elyashiv, Yakim, Chupah, Yeshve'av, Bilgah, Imer</p>\n<p>Hypothetically, it might be possible to narrow down the list more, if there was a way to connect one of the descendants of Eli mentioned in Talmudic sources to one of the mishmarot somehow. After the destruction of the Temple, the mishmarot escaped to the Galilee and settled in different towns (see <a href=\"https://forum.otzar.org/download/file.php?id=47854&sid=f2fc8214e5ef989f4892efcd313ddcee\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), so maybe, just maybe, if one of the descendants was found to be connected to one of these towns, then perhaps that would signify that he was a member of that mishmar. These are the descendants I'm aware of: Rabbah (bar Nachmani), Abayei, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zevachim.118b.7?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Khaylil</a> (Abayei's father and Rabbah's brother), Rav Bivai bar Abayei, \"the family of Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rosh_Hashanah.18a.9?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 18a</a>), and (some of?) the population of the town of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mamlah</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bereishit_Rabbah.59.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beresheet Rabbah 59:1</a>).</p>\n<p>I found two possibilities for connecting some of the descendants to kohen towns in the Galilee:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%A2%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%92%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaar Hagilgulim, Introduction 38</a>, it is said that the graves of Abayei and Rava are to be found in \"Avenit\", which is identified with <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevanit</a>, the location of Mishmar Imer. Coincidentally (or not), Imer was one of the mishmarot descended from Itamar.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>According to various sources compiled by Rabbi Shmuel Klein (see link about the mishmarot escaping to the Galilee), the population of Mamlah or Mamliach were descendants of Eli. Elsewhere, it says that Chezir settled there. Chezir wasn't a descendant of Itamar. Perhaps the two groups shared the town, though how they came to be connected is unclear (also noted in <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23598596?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%A8&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3D%25D7%2591%25D7%25A0%25D7%2599%2B%25D7%25A2%25D7%259C%25D7%2599%2B%25D7%2590%25D7%2599%25D7%259E%25D7%25A8%26so%3Drel&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_search_gsv2%2Fcontrol&refreqid=fastly-default%3Aba8133fc3b8e38484dd738bdc827c937&seq=6#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this essay</a>, pg. 82, note 40). According to <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%97%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam on Bava Batra 137b</a>, the combination of the town's name and the defects of the descendants of Eli were used to criticize Rav Bivai bar Abayei.<sup>1</sup></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In short, there seems to be a bit of case for maybe connecting Bnei Eli to the mishmar of Imer, but this is based on a lot of conjecture. A bit of a stronger case may be made to connect them to Chezir, but at the same time, it seems that Chezir was a descendant of Elazar, so the connection remains mysterious.</p>\n<p>An entirely different option was suggested by Rabbi Avraham Taub in his commentary on Shmuel, \"Divrei Tova\" (דברי טובה). On the verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וְהָיָה כָּל הַנּוֹתָר בְּבֵיתְךָ יָבוֹא לְהִשְׁתַּחֲו‍ֹת לוֹ לַאֲגוֹרַת כֶּסֶף וְכִכַּר לָחֶם וְאָמַר סְפָחֵנִי נָא אֶל אַחַת הַכְּהֻנּוֹת לֶאֱכֹל פַּת לָחֶם.\"</p>\n<p>\"And all the survivors of your house shall come and bow low to him for the sake of a money fee and a loaf of bread, and shall say, ‘Please, assign me to one of the priestly duties, that I may have a morsel of bread to eat.’”\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Samuel.2.36?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 1:2:36</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>he <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=144283&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=0&fs=108680%2C108674%2C108653%2C108660%3B108680%2C108681%2C108653%2C108660&pagenum=235\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is possible that when David, along with Tzadok the kohen and Achimelech son of Evyatar organized the twenty-four mishmarot kehunah...they did not assign from the sons of Eli any mishmar of kehunah, because the sons of Eli could not be trusted in the service of the kehunah due to the fact that they died young, and we find in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.9.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Hayamim 1:9:22</a> \"All these, who were selected as gatekeepers at the thresholds, were 212. They were selected by genealogies in their villages. David and Samuel the seer established them in <strong>their office of trust</strong>\" - it seems that the basis of the assignments was the trust that this person would serve dutifully, but the sons of Eli could not trust the dutiful continuation of their service, and so there was not a mishmeret of service from the sons of Eli...and Rashi wrote that \"memulai\" - a miserable family, from the House of Eli and the gemara there says this about Rav Bivai bar Abayei that since he came from a memulai family, he said things that were wrong, for the descendants of Eli were a miserable family because they didn't have a tradition for Torah and wisdom because they died young, and for this reason they could not be tasked with forming a mishmeret of kohanim because they could not properly pass on from one another the tradition of the priestly service...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, due to their curse, the sons of Eli were never assigned to a mishmar. This makes some sense in light of views that the kohanim of Anatot were descendants of Evyatar who was removed from service (see <a href=\"https://daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/achronim/kohanim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hatanakh.com/sites/herzog/files/herzog/mega25_gafni.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for example), but on the other hand, none other than his son Achimelech is in charge of setting up the mishmarot - it seems strange that he would not include his own family (i.e., it makes more sense to associate the removal of <em>some of</em> Bnei Eli only to when Shlomo removed Evyatar from service, and not the removal of <em>all</em> of Bnei Eli, already in the time of David).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I came across now an essay by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Demsky\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Aharon Demsky</a> ('Abbaye’s Family Origins: A Study in Rabbinic Genealogy', in: \"Follow the Wise\": Studies in Jewish History and Culture in Honor of Lee I. Levine, pp. 235-240) where he suggested the same conjecture regarding Abayei's family origins and noted the difficulty with Chezir being a descendant of Elazar according to the Yerushalmi but raised the possibility of simply disagreeing with the Yerushalmi's drasha about the name Chezir (=\"returned\", i.e., returned to the Elazar families). There's some logic for his suggestion, as it would put all the Elazar families in one group and the Itamar families wouldn't be pushed in-between. Per his suggestion, Chezir would be the first of the Itamar families (being no. 17 in the list of mishmarot).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Lessons of the mann?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I think it is understood that the מן (\"mann\", manna) has a lot to teach us about Hashem's hashgacha (providence) over us and how he sustains us with parnassah. The Torah even prescribes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16.32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 16:32-34</a>) keeping a jar of the mann in the Holy of Holies, \"that through the ages, they see the bread that I fed you in the wilderness\".<br />\nKind of like a moshul (parable), where parnassah is the nimshal (lesson). Perhaps, the mann is parnassah in a world where Hashem's providence is out in the open, and we live in a world where parnassah comes from Hashem's providence in a more hidden way.<br />\nNow in any moshul and nimshal, there are parts of the story intended to teach, and parts that are incidental and don't apply to the lesson. In Aesop's [The Fox and the Grapes][2], l'havdil, we don't care about the color of the fox. Here, I'd say, we don't care so much that the mann looked like white crackers and shouldn't learn from there to eat crackers all the time, etc.<br />\nQuestion: What are the lessons that we should learn from the mann? What not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There are a few things that the story of the manna teaches me personally:</p>\n<p>The Gemara teaches not to worry about what will happen tomorrow (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.63b.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 63b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not suffer from tomorrow’s trouble, that is, do not worry about problems that might arise in the future, as you do not know what a day will bring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, R. Eliezer Hamodai says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.16.4.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 16:4:2</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whoever has what to eat today and says \"What will I eat tomorrow?\" is lacking in faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, what does the manna teaches me? It teaches me to believe that G-d provides me with everything that I need, even something that I won't recognise by myself as necessary, as the Gemara teaches on \"what is a man with faith?\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.48b.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 48b</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are people who believe in the Holy One, Blessed be He, and place their trust in Him in all their ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chovos Halevavos <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Duties_of_the_Heart%2C_Fourth_Treatise_on_Trust.3.32?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Divine wisdom required the testing of man in the service of G-d or rebellion against Him. Therefore, G-d tests man with what demonstrates his choice in this - needs and lacking for external things such as food</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, for me, there is a connection between the manna in time of Moshe Rabbeinu and Mashiach, since the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kohelet_Rabbah.1.9.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabbah 1:9</a>) tells us that just as the first redeemer (Moshe Rabbeinu) brought down manna from heaven, so too will the last redeemer, e.g. Mashiach do.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as the first redeemer brought down the manna, as it says “Behold! I am going to rain down for you bread from heaven…” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.16.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 16:4</a>) so too the last redeemer will bring down manna, as it says “May there be an abundance of grain in the land…” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.72.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 72:16</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Mekhilta (Beshalach) explains that the Torah was given to be expounded only by \"the eaters of manna\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mekhilta_d%27Rabbi_Yishmael.13.17.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mekhilta d'Rabbi Yishmael 13:17</a>). So, according to this, how can we be \"eaters of manna\"?</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe explains this as follows (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/4032755/jewish/Avot-64-Manna-Eaters.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beyond the Letter of the Law, Avot 6:4 \"Manna Eaters\"</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The challenge for us is that we, too, should be \"eaters of the manna.\" That even as we eat ordinary bread, earned by the sweat of our brow, we recognize that it is G‑d who creates the bread and imbues it with the ability to sustain life. That we recognize that it is the \"utterance of G -d's mouth\" within the bread—that is to say, the divine speech by which G‑d created, and continues to create, all of existence—that nourishes us (1)(Y. Tauber, 2012)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reference list:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Tauber, Y. (2012). Beyond the Letter of the Law: A Chassidic Companion to the Ethics of the Fathers.

So even though descendants of Yishmael are <em>technically</em> his offspring (as we see in the next verse), they do not have the official title of offspring. As such, the promises made to Abraham's offspring in Genesis 17 do not apply to them.</p>\n\n\n",

There is an opinion that the primary practice is to recite this Kaddish after learning Aggadah, the non-legal portions of the Talmud or Midrash. This is based on Sotah 49a, which tells us that since the Temple was destroyed, the world endures because of the recitation of Kedusha in Uva L’Tziyon and the “yehei shmei rabbah” in the Kaddish after Aggadah. Accordingly, the practice has become to recite the Aggadic passage of “Rabbi Chananya…” (Makkos 23b) between a public Torah lecture and Kaddish. Since it is related to Torah study, the Rabbis’ Kaddish includes a passage on behalf of “the Jews, the teachers, their students, their students’ students, and all those who engage in the study of Torah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did Yisro figure out that Hashem is the greatest?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Yisro came to the Jewish nation, he said that now he knows that Hashem is the greatest because \"in the very same thing in which they sinned against them\" (18:11).</p>\n<p>What does this mean and how is this a proof?</p>\n<p>At first sight (and according to Rashi) it is a reference to the Kriyas Yam Suf how it is a punishment of a middah k'neged middah against Pharao decided to throw Jewish children in the Nile.</p>\n<p>Philosophically, if Hashem is able to punish everybody midah k'neged midah, then He must be greater than all other powerful forces in the universe which could exercise power but only in a certain field. But Hashem is ruling over all.</p>\n<p>But this line of reasoning (which seems to be behind this pasuk) is very hard to understand, since there is an obvious alternative explanation: maybe the Jews were indeed saved by the Angel of the Sea (ch\"v), which exercises its power only on the waters, and nothing else.</p>\n<p>Did Yisro make a \"philosophical mistake\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I like <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Exodus.18.11.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a>'s analysis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי בדבר אשר זדו עליהם; Yitro explains what had prompted him to say that he now realises that the G-d of the Israelites is greater than any other deity. <strong>The reason is that when analysing the method by which G-d imposes penalties on the sinners, it becomes evident that the punishment matches the sin committed</strong>. The Egyptians’ crime had been that they drowned the Jewish babies; they had been punished by being drowned themselves. In Nechemya, chapter 9, where when a celebration of the Sukkot festival, after a Day of Atonement on which the people confessed their collective sin in Jerusalem is described in detail, the author also describes the greatness of G-d as being reflected in the manner in which punishment matches the sins committed. (verse 10)(Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see according to Chizkuni, it was a theological realisation about how G-d punishes those that sin, and how it was abundantly clear that the punishment is calculated to the precise level required. It wasn't just a case of middah knegged middah per se, it was a retribution that was equal to the crime.</p>\n<p>This point is brought out equally so by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.18.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.18.11.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim HaKadosh</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עתה ידעתי כי גדול ה׳ מכל האלוקים, \"Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods;\" <strong>Yitro acknowledged that although all other nations have spiritual representatives in the celestial regions, some of whom are very powerful and both protect their protegees and assist them in their wars, they do not exact retribution from the adversaries of their protegees as does G'd. Only G'd operates on the principle of the punishment fitting the crime.</strong> Only the G'd of Israel would drown people who themselves had drowned others, etc. When the celestial representatives of other nations act in defense of their protegees one cannot recognise this as what happens to their adversaries seems totally unrelated to what these people had perpetrated. In the case of the G'd of Israel, every one of the plagues He brought upon Egypt was retribution for a specific wrong committed by that people and their king. (Sefaria translation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, if this does not satisfy you. There are other views that point out that he was impressed about other occurrences and not just krias yam suf.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.116a.21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 116a</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתנאי (שמות יח, א) וישמע יתרו כהן מדין מה שמועה שמע ובא ונתגייר ר' יהושע אומר <strong>מלחמת עמלק שמע</strong> שהרי כתיב בצדו (שמות יז, יג) ויחלש יהושע את עמלק ואת עמו לפי חרבר\"א המודעי אומר <strong>מתן תורה שמע</strong> [ובא] שכשניתנה תורה לישראל היה קולו הולך מסוף העולם ועד סופו וכל [מלכי] עובדי כוכבים אחזתן רעדה בהיכליהן ואמרו שירה שנאמר (תהלים כט, ט) ובהיכלו כולו אומר כבוד</p>\n<p>The Gemara notes that the disagreement between amora’im with regard to when Yitro came to Mount Sinai is like a dispute between tanna’im: The Torah states with regard to Yitro, before he came to Mount Sinai: “Now Yitro, the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel His people, how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt” (Exodus 18:1). What tiding did he hear that he came and converted? Rabbi Yehoshua says: <strong>He heard about the war with Amalek</strong>, as it is written adjacent to the verses that state that Yitro came: “And Joshua weakened Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword” (Exodus 17:13). Rabbi Elazar HaModa’i says: <strong>He heard about the giving of the Torah and came</strong>. As when the Torah was given to the Jewish people, the voice of the Holy One, Blessed be He, went from one end of the world to the other end, and all of the kings of the nations of the world were overcome with trembling in their palaces and recited a song of praise, as it is stated: “The voice of the Lord makes the hinds to calve…and in his palace all say: Glory” (Psalms 29:9), i.e., each king in his own palace recited songs of praise to God. (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So he heard about the war of Amalek and the giving of the Torah which also made a big impression. The former is also brought in the Midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah.27.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos Rabbah 27:6</a> which notes that when Yisro saw that Hashem had destroyed Amalek he regretted his idol worship and repented.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In the meantime I heard an answer I think was addressing my issue in the best way:</p>\n<p>It is not the fact that the Egyptians got struck at the sea, rather that they get their last, final struck, from which there was no rescue. All ten plagues before was only partial, and they were also middah k'neged middah, and corresponded to all the tortures they caused to the Jews.</p>\n<p>But at the Sea they were executed, the same exact way as Pharao wanted to (and did) execute the Jewish boys.</p>\n<p>So from this Yisro could derive that Hashem is indeed greater, and this everything together could not have been possibly performed by any angel.</p>\n\n\n",

Others<sup>2</sup> say it was written by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%90%D7%99_%D7%92%D7%90%D7%95%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Yehudai Gaon</strong></a><sup>3</sup>. Both lived in the 8th century.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: His list is really just an introduction to a work on <em>halacha</em>. He lists all of his <em>mitzvos</em> by name, originally without any punctuation. The names are usually just a quotation of the verse they’re from. As such, it’s hard to determine when one <em>mitzvah</em> starts and when one stops. He doesn’t number them, and one could easily find a different number other than 613 <em>mitzvos</em> in his list. As such, later authorities struggled to divide up his list into 613. They often had to emend the text, or interpret one <em>mitzvah</em> to be really multiple in one, or the vice versa.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: Besides being the first to enumerate the <em>mitzvos</em>, he doesn’t hesitate including <em>DeRabbanans</em> in the list. He divides the <em>mitzvos</em> into 7 categories, instead of the better-known division of 248 positive and 365 negative <em>mitzvos</em>. Instead he lists 71 “<em>Onshim</em>” (ordered from most severe to least severe), 277 negative <em>mitzvos</em> for the individual, 200 positive mitzvos for the individual, and 65 “<em>Parshiyos</em>”. This latter category is a mix of 48 positive and 17 negative <em>mitzvos</em>, understood to be incumbent upon the community instead of the individual.</p>\n<h2>Section 2 – The Azharos (Taryag composed into a poem)</h2>\n<h4>2) <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=10515\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Sa’adiah Gaon</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saadia_Gaon\" rel=\"noreferrer\">c. 892 – 942 CE, Babylonia</a>)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He became the Gaon, or Rosh Yeshiva, of the Yeshiva in Sura, Babylonia, at the age of 36. He wrote a translation of the Torah into Arabic. His most famous work is most likely Emunos V’Deos, a philosophical work originally written in Arabic.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: He wrote two <em>piyutim</em>: one according to the division of the <strong>Bahag</strong> (although with a different order), and one organizing the <em>mitzvos</em> according the Ten Commandments. This latter <em>piyut</em> is referenced by <strong>Rashi</strong><sup>4</sup>. The two versions differ in the exact listing of the <em>Taryag</em>. Both are featured in Rav Sa’adiah Gaon’s <em>Siddur</em>. He doesn’t list dozens of mitzvos which everyone else counted (for example: <em>Bal Tosif</em> and <em>Bal Tigra</em><sup>5</sup>, <em>Ahavas Hashem</em>, <em>Kiddush Hashem</em><sup>6</sup>).</p>\n<h4>3) Ata Hinchalta (identity disputed)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: Some<sup>7</sup> say this <em>piyut</em> was written by <strong>Rav Eliyahu HaZaken</strong> (see below). Others<sup>8</sup> say it was written by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rabbeinu Shimon HaGadol</strong></a> (c. 950 – 1020 CE, France). Others<sup>9</sup> even date this work to the times of <strong>Rav Sa’adiah Gaon</strong>, or even earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: A poem written as an alphabetical acrostic, sometimes going forwards, sometimes backwards. There isn’t a clear order to the mitzvos, and the main commentary on it expresses an inability to discern the order.</p>\n<h4>4) <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=145067\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Eliyahu HaZaken</a> (<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95_%D7%94%D7%96%D7%A7%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">c. 980 – 1060 CE, France</a>)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He was <strong>Rav Hai Gaon</strong>’s brother-in-law. He lived in France and was a student of <strong>Rabbeinu Gershom</strong>. His <em>Azharos</em> are cited by <strong>Tosafos</strong> in a few places<sup>10</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: It’s a poem written mostly as an alphabetical acrostic which goes forwards and backwards. Like the <strong>Bahag</strong>, he divided the <em>mitzvos</em> into unique categories. First the <em>mitzvos aseh</em>, then <em>parshiyos</em>, then <em>onshim</em>, then <em>mitzvos lo sa’aseh</em>.</p>\n<h4>5) <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42063&st=&pgnum=94\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Shlomo ibn Gabirol</a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_ibn_Gabirol\" rel=\"noreferrer\">c. 1021 – 1070 CE</a>)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He was a very popular <em>paytan</em> or poet, and some of our Shabbos <em>zemiros</em> were written by him. Some say<sup>11</sup> he composed the popular song “<em>Anim Zemiros</em>”, and others say<sup>12</sup> he wrote “<em>Adon Olam</em>”. He was also a philosopher. By the age of 25 he had written many poems and a few works on character development.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: Each stanza is written in the same way, with the first three parts sharing a rhyming scheme, with the last part always ending in –im. Each stanza usually includes one or many <em>mitzvos</em>, depending on the interpretation of the commentator.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: Unlike the other <em>Azharos</em>, he divides his <em>piyut</em> into 248 positive <em>mitzvos</em> and 365 negative <em>mitzvos</em>, like the Rambam would later do.</p>\n<h4>6) <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/42063\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Yitzchak ben Reuven Albargaloni</a> (<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%97%D7%A7_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%95%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%94%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%A6%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1043 – ? CE</a>)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: Lived in the same generation as the <strong>Rif</strong>. Albargaloni just means from Barcelona, or in Hebrew HaBartzaloni. He should not be confused with <strong>Rav Yehuda HaBartzaloni</strong> (12th century). Both have been referred to as Ri HaBartzaloni. He was an ancestor to <strong>Ramban</strong> (see below). He was the one who translated <strong>Rav Hai Gaon</strong>’s important work on business <em>halacha</em> “<em>HaMekach VeHamemkar</em>” from Arabic into Hebrew.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: An alphabetical acrostic where each stanza has four lines where the first three start with the same letter. All four lines share the same rhyming scheme, and the last line is a verse in Tanach. Like <strong>Rav Eliyahu HaZaken</strong> (see above), first he lists 200 positive <em>mitzvos</em>, 65 <em>parshiyos</em>, 71 <em>onshim</em>, then 277 negative <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h4>7) <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/14049\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Yereim</a> – <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Eliezer MiMitz</a> (1140 – 1237 CE)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He was one of the Ba’alei HaTosafos, often quoted by <strong>Tosafos</strong> and other Ashkenazi <em>poskim</em>. He was a student of <strong>Rabbeinu Tam</strong>, and the teacher of the <strong>Ra’avya</strong> and the <strong>Rokeach</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: Although not one of the <em>Azharos</em>, he based his <em>sefer</em> on the list of the <strong>Halachos Gedolos</strong>, with many differences. It is unclear if he had a different version of Halachos Gedolos, if this was how he interpreted its vague listing, or he simply disagreed in certain instances. There are only 464 sections in the work, although the author says he grouped together similar <em>mitzvos</em>. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/118777/1739\">Toafos Re'eim attempted</a> to divide them all into 613. In each mitzvah he spells out all of his rulings related to that mitzvah. As such, it’s an often-quoted <em>halacha sefer</em>.</p>\n<h2>Section 3 – The Rambam and those who followed him</h2>\n<h4>8) <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=8933\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> – <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Moshe ben Maimon</a> (c. 1135 – 1204 CE)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: Also known as <strong>Maimonides</strong>. He is arguably the most famous Jewish philosopher of all time, and one of the most influential Torah scholars of his time. He was born in Spain, and eventually came to live in Egypt. He was the first to structurally organize and codify all of the laws scattered throughout the Talmud into clear, delineated topics and sections. He also codified laws that aren’t presently relevant but will be when the Temple is rebuilt. This was all put in his work <strong>Mishneh Torah</strong>. Besides his <strong>Sefer HaMitzvos</strong>, he wrote a commentary on the entire Mishnah, and the philosophical work <strong>Moreh Nevuchim</strong>, or Guide to the Perplexed. All three of these works were originally written in Arabic, and later translated by others into Hebrew. He famously became the Sultan of Egypt’s personal doctor in his later years.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: He prefaces his list with 14 “<em>Shorashim</em>”, which are the rules he created and followed to determine which <em>mitzvos</em> made it into his list. If you read any verse in <em>Chumash</em> and follow his rules, you’ll apparently know if it counts as a <em>mitzvah</em> or not. Every <em>mitzvah</em> he lists, he tells you the verse it came from, a source in <em>Chazal</em> that it’s a <em>mitzvah</em> (if one exists), and where in the <em>gemarra</em> one can learn more about it. He standardized listing the <em>mitzvos</em> as a list of 248 positive <em>mitzvos</em> and 365 negative <em>mitzvos</em><sup>13</sup>.</p>\n<h4>9) <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=8933\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ramban</a> – <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Moshe ben Nachman</a> (1194 – 1270 CE)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: Spent most of his life in Spain. Renowned Jewish scholar, mystic, and doctor. He wrote a commentary on the Torah, Talmud, Rif, and Responsa. He also wrote on many topics.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: He doesn’t explicitly write his list anywhere. Rather, he comments on the <strong>Rambam</strong>’s Sefer HaMitzvos and let’s you know when he disagrees. Silence often implies concurrence. After the Rambam’s list the Ramban tells you the 25 mitzvos that he feels the Rambam “forgot”. However, this list isn’t enough, as reading the whole <em>sefer</em> yields a much greater disagreement between these two giants<sup>14</sup>. At the very end of his commentary the Ramban summarizes every mitzvah he disagrees with, and it’s up to you to figure out how he fills in the gaps.</p>\n<h4>10) <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/40631\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaChinuch</a> (identity disputed)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: Many<sup>15</sup> assume this work was written by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%90%22%D7%94\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Rav Aharon HaLevi</strong></a> of Barcelona (1235 – c. 1290 CE). However, this assumption has been disproven, as the author frequently disagrees explicitly with known rulings of Rav Aharon HaLevi. A convincing argument has been made<sup>16</sup> that the author is really Rav Aharon’s brother, <strong>Rav Pinchas HaLevi</strong>. Either way, we know for a fact the author was a Levi from Barcelona. He seemingly was a student of the <strong>Rashba</strong>, as he frequently agrees with the latter’s rulings.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: His list is exclusively based on the list of the <strong>Rambam</strong><sup>17</sup>. However, he reordered the list according to the weekly <em>parsha</em>. He writes that this way his son (for whom he wrote the book) will know what mitzvos appear in each <em>parsha</em>. Each <em>mitzvah</em> is listed with a title, the verse, a general description of the <em>mitzvah</em>, the “<em>shoresh</em>” of the <em>mitzvah</em> (see next section), a summary of its relevant <em>halachos</em>, and details of its obligation.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: What makes Sefer HaChinuch so unique and enjoyed by many is that he shares what he believes is the reason behind each <em>mitzvah</em>, which he calls the “<em>shoresh</em>” of the <em>mitzvah</em>. He also at the end of each <em>mitzvah</em> tells you who is obligated in it, when, and where. He also lists the punishment for neglecting the <em>mitzvah</em>.</p>\n<h4>11) <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/20520\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Semag – Sefer Mitzvos Gadol</a> - <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Moshe of Kotzi</a> (13th century)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He was one of the Ba’alei HaTosafos and was born in France. He was a student of <strong>Rabbi Yehudah HaChossid</strong>. He writes in the introduction to the work that he consistently received visions in his dreams commanding him to write a two-volume work on the <em>Taryag Mitzvos</em>. He eventually complied.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: His <em>sefer</em> is a work of <em>halacha</em>. He goes through each <em>mitzvah</em> and lists all the halachos related to that mitzvah. Very often he quotes the language of the <em>gemarra</em> and the <strong>Rambam</strong>, although as one of the Ba’alei HaTosafos he also brings the rulings of the Ashkenazi <em>Rishonim</em>. At the beginning of the work he lists all the <em>Taryag Mitzvos</em>, basically making an index for the rest of the work. His list is mostly based on the <strong>Rambam</strong>’s, differing only in 20 <em>mitzvos</em>.</p>\n<h4>12) <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/30766\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Zohar HaRakiah</a> – <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%97_%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9F\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Shimon ben Tzemach</a> (1361 – 1444 CE)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He lived in Algeria. Besides being a major halachic decisor, he was a mathematician, philosopher, and doctor.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: He wrote his work as a “commentary” to <strong>Rav Shlomo ibn Gabirol</strong>’s <em>Azharos</em> (see above). However, it’s not really a commentary, but merely uses the latter’s listing as a springboard to discuss his own listing of the <em>mitzvos</em>. He mostly follows the <strong>Rambam</strong> and <strong>Ramban</strong>, so he rejects most of what Rashbag counts.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: Being one of the later <em>Rishonim</em>, he had access to all of the works that came before him. He uses every opportunity he can to bring the disputes of the Rambam and the Ramban, and to discuss the logic and merits of each. He will often take sides, or come up with his own opinion. In this work he was the first to suggest that when the Rambam says <em>derashos</em> are <em>MiDerabanan</em>, he meant they’re Biblical but were extracted by the Rabbis.</p>\n<h4>13) <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=143568&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=0\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer Charedim</a> – <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%96%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rav Elazar Azikri</a> (1533 – 1600 CE)</h4>\n<p><strong>Life</strong>: He was born and lived in Tzfas. He was a contemporary of <strong>Rav Yosef Caro</strong>, the <strong>Arizal</strong> and <strong>Rav Shlomo Alkabetz</strong>. He was the author of the popular <em>shabbos</em> <em>zemer</em> <em>Yedid Nefesh</em><sup>18</sup>.</p>\n<p><strong>Style</strong>: He only writes <em>mitzvos</em> that apply today yet includes <em>mitzvos</em> <em>MiDivrei Kabbalah</em> and <em>MiDivrei Soferim</em>. To be honest, I don't think his list reaches 613, but I haven't confirmed that yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Unique Characteristics</strong>: He divided the <em>mitzvos</em> into the body parts, so one can always know which <em>mitzvos</em> can be fulfilled with which part of the body. Being one of the last to count the <em>mitzvos</em>, he had the knowledge of all the opinions which preceded him. He lists all the <em>mitzvos</em> which everyone or most agree to in a general way, and will list lone opinions by name.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This isn't an exhaustive list, but I believe these are the main ones. See <strong>Chida</strong>'s <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30595&st=&pgnum=3\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><strong>Shem HaGedolim</strong> II § אזהרות</a> where he lists more <em>azharos</em> which I've never heard of.

The school of Rabbi Sheila says: Shiloh is his name, as it is stated: “Until when Shiloh shall come” (Genesis 49:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Mordecai Kornfeld (Kollel Iyun Hadaf of Yerushalayim) <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/sanhedrin/insites/sn-dt-098.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In particular, the Mashi'ach will incorporate the three Midos of the Avos, Avraham, Yitzchak, and Yakov, which are the Midos of Chesed/Gedulah (Avraham), Yir'ah/Gevurah (Yitzchak), and Emes/Torah (Yakov). The three Tana'im mentioned in the Gemara each had a quality of one of the Avos. Their students were teaching that Mashi'ach will have all of those qualities.\nThe quality represented by the name \"Shilo\" is the Midah of Yakov Avinu. Yakov Avinu succeeded in forging a unique combination of Ahavah and Yir'ah, of Chesed and Gevurah, by combining the traits of his father and grandfather. This is the quality of Torah, in which everyone has a place. This is why Yakov Avinu was blessed by \"a boundless heritage\" (\"Nachalah Bli Metzarim\"; see Shabbos 118b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Radak, in his commentary on Bereishis 49:10 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Genesis.49.10.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שילה; a reference to David’s son, seeing that the meaning of the word is derived from Deuteronomy 28,57 ובשליתה, i.e. “and against her afterbirth, etc.” Onkelos understands the word as referring to the Messiah. He bases himself on the variant spelling here still having the same meaning as שלו, “his.” This is also the way Bereshit Rabbah 99,8 understands the word שילה in our verse. Yaakov would be saying that Yehudah’s preeminence would not be short-lived, but would continue until the coming of the Messiah, the one to whom royalty would belong permanently. The whole blessing to Yehudah could then be compared to a father saying to his son: “accept this token in the meantime until I can give you the real thing!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Shelah (Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Vayeshev, Miketz, Vayigash, Torah Ohr 85) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Vayeshev%2C_Miketz%2C_Vayigash%2C_Torah_Ohr.85?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The משיח בן יוסף, when he comes, does not come in order to establish his own dynasty, rather he comes to help re-establish the Davidic dynasty. He will even sacrifice his life in order to accomplish this. His blood will atone for the sins of the Jewish people. This atonement will take the form of the Davidic dynasty being restored to the Jewish people as an everlasting kingdom. When that stage in history will have been reached, both of Joseph's dreams will have been fulfilled. His two dreams foreshadowed his reign in Egypt, and his reign in the future as the משיח בן יוסף respectively. In both instances his reign preceded or will precede that of the reign of David or the in משיח בן דוד respectively. Both periods of the reign of the kingdom of Joseph were or will be beneficial for the whole Jewish people because in both instances they were or will be designed to pave the way for the permanent kingdom of David.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.1.25b.7?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a>, on the other hand, explains that the gematria of Moshe Rabbeinu and Shiloh are the same, hence Shiloh refers to Moshe Rabbeinu:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another explanation of the phrase: \"plant of the field\" is the first Messiah, (Mashiach ben David) who was not yet on earth, whereas \"herb of the field\" is the second Messiah, (Mashiach ben Yosef) Why? Because Moses was not there with them to serve the Shechinah. Of him, it is written: \"And there was not a man to till the ground.\" The secret is given in the verse: \"The staff shall not depart from Judah...\" (Beresheet 49:10), which refers to Messiah ben David, \"nor the scepter from between his feet,\" which refers to Messiah ben Joseph. \"Until Shiloh come\" is an allusion to Moses, as the numerical value of (Moshe) is the same as that (Shiloh). \"And the obedience of the people be his (Heb. velo yik'hat)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in line what I wrote above, see what the Gemara teaches us (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.5a.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 5a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The term “Shiloh” is understood as a reference to the Messiah, and therefore the verse is interpreted as delineating the authority of Jewish rulers during the exile, before the Messiah comes. “The scepter shall not depart from Judah”; these are the Exilarchs in Babylonia, who are empowered by the government and consequently subjugate the Jewish people as with a scepter. “Nor the ruler’s staff from between his feet”; These are the grandchildren of Hillel the Elder who hold the position of Nasi and teach Torah in public, but do not have authority to actually enforce their judgments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Jewish Mysticism/Kabbalah - Separation of souls from Hashem good, bad, or neither?",
    "content": "# Jewish Mysticism/Kabbalah - Separation of souls from Hashem good, bad, or neither?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is an except from G.K. Chesterton's \"Romance of Orthodoxy\".  Chesterton was a  English writer, philosopher, lay theologian, and argues that Buddhism and the Theosophical concept of one god that detests separation and really wants all souls to unit.  Chesterton asserts that Christianity says that man should learn to love another and G-d rejoices in this division.  Is this what Kabbalah/Zohar teaches?  My understanding is that Hashem's divine sparks are separated and it is up to man to uncover those divine sparks.  Judaism does affirm the clear division of souls, and that Hashem separated us so that we may learn to love Him, correct?  It seems like Chesterton, to me at least, is affirming a concept already present in Jewish mystical thought, if I understand correctly.  I am just trying to share this idea with others and see if I am interpreting correct.  Thank you</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A short time ago Mrs. Besant, in an interesting essay, announced that\nthere was only one religion in the world, that all faiths were only\nversions or perversions of it, and that she was quite prepared to say\nwhat it was. According to Mrs. Besant this universal Church is simply\nthe universal self. It is the doctrine that we are really all one\nperson; that there are no real walls of individuality between man and\nman. If I may put it so, she does not tell us to love our neighbours;\nshe tells us to be our neighbours. That is Mrs. Besant's thoughtful\nand suggestive description of the religion in which all men must find\nthemselves in agreement. And I never heard of any suggestion in my\nlife with which I more violently disagree. <strong>I want to love my neighbour\nnot because he is I, but precisely because he is not I</strong>. I want to\nadore the world, not as one likes a looking-glass, because it is one's\nself, but as one loves a woman, because she is entirely different. If\nsouls are separate love is possible. If souls are united love is\nobviously impossible. A man may be said loosely to love himself, but\nhe can hardly fall in love with himself, or, if he does, it must be a\nmonotonous courtship. If the world is full of real selves, they can be\nreally unselfish selves. But upon <strong>Mrs. Besant's principle the whole\ncosmos is only one enormously selfish person</strong>.</p>\n<p>It is just here that Buddhism is on the side of modern pantheism and\nimmanence. And it is just here that Christianity is on the side of\nhumanity and liberty and love. <strong>Love desires personality; therefore\nlove desires division. It is the instinct of Christianity to be glad\nthat God has broken the universe into little pieces, because they are\nliving pieces. It is her instinct to say \"little children love one\nanother\" rather than to tell one large person to love himself.</strong> This is\nthe intellectual abyss between Buddhism and Christianity; that for the\nBuddhist or Theosophist personality is the fall of man, for the\nChristian it is the purpose of God, the whole point of his cosmic\nidea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The world-soul of the Theosophists asks man to love it only in order\nthat man may throw himself into it. But the divine centre of\nChristianity actually threw man out of it in order that he might love\nit. <strong>The oriental deity is like a giant who should have lost his leg or\nhand and be always seeking to find it; but the Christian power is like\nsome giant who in a strange generosity should cut off his right hand,\nso that it might of its own accord shake hands with him.</strong>... <strong>No\nother philosophy makes God actually rejoice in the separation of the\nuniverse into living souls.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was the general skin color of ancient Israelites?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are various claims regarding the ethnic profile of ancient Israelites, ranging from black, to brown, to white, or even east-asian looking.</p>\n<p>Which claim is accurate? Is there any evidence from Tanakh?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 25)\n\n<p>An important source (post-bibical) is the Mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Negaim.2.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Negaim (2:1)</a> which deals with the signs of leprosy and how they may appear different based on a person's skin color:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The bright spot in a German appears as dull white, and the dull white\nspot in an Ethiopian appears as bright white. Rabbi Ishmael says: the\nchildren of Israel (may I be atonement for them!) are like boxwood,\nneither black nor white but of an intermediate shade.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on the description, it appears that the average Jew was darker than a German - (a Northern European) and lighter than an Ethiopian (a Sub-Saharan African). Thus, Jews were neither 'black' nor 'white' but brown like other Mediterranean people.</p>\n<p>An additional note - the claims you are hearing are based on a mistaken idea that people were thought of as 'black' or 'white' or 'brown' in ancient times, and the skin color was significant. Racial categories didn't exist before the Middle Ages at earliest. So the skin color was not really focused on except in cases (like Leprosy) where it actually mattered.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Just an addition to what Daniel Kagan writes (very interesting though), Rashi, in his commentary on Bamidbar 12:1 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Numbers.12.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האשה הכשית THE CUSHITE WOMAN — This tells us that all agreed as to her beauty just as all agree as to the blackness of an Aethopian (cf. Sifrei Bamidbar 99).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi seems to cite the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Bamidbar.99.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei Bamidbar 99</a>), where it is explained that an Cushite was exceptional in his/her skin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the intent of \"Cushite\"? Just as a Cushite is exceptional in his skin, so Tzipporah was exceptional in her beauty — more so than all the women. Similarly, (Psalms 7:1) \"A Shiggayon of David, which he sang to the L-rd concerning Cush (Saul), a Benjaminite.\" Now was he a Cushite? (The intent is:) Just as a Cushite is exceptional in his skin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.24.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot d'Rabbi Natan</a>, it is explained that Noah blessed Shem that \"made them\" dark but comely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Noah brought his sons and his grandsons, and he blessed them with their (several) settlements, and he gave them as an inheritance all the earth. He especially blessed Shem and his sons, (making them) dark but comely, and he gave them the habitable earth. He blessed Ham and his sons, (making them) dark || like the raven, and he gave them as an inheritance the coast of the sea. He blessed Japheth and his sons, (making) them entirely white, and he gave them for an inheritance the desert and its fields; these (are the inheritances with) which he endowed them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, according to the Avot d'Rabbi Natan, Japheth were entirely white and inherited the desert and its fields. It seems to me that this is somewhat problematic, since the Mishnah in Negaim states \"The bright spot in a German appears as dull white\". The question can be asked if the inhabitants of the Northern Kingdoms (Germany) are from the seed of Japheth?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here is a list of sources I compiled.

The Gemara applies something similair to Daniel, who was able to perceive cryptic visions (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.3a.12?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 3a</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

And ye say: 'Wherein have we despised Thy name?'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here both instances of אני have a pausal form, that is, they are vowelised with a <em>kamatz</em> despite the <em>munach</em> and the <em>telisha ketana,</em> both conjunctive signs. Does it happen because the verse is too long, and there are no more minor disjunctives?

Needless to say, there can be no dichotomy between the two, because it is One Torah, given by One G‑d, to the “one people on earth.”</p>\n<p>Jewish mysticism helps to realize the said purpose of the soul by teaching it how to recognize the spirituality of matter, and that in every physical thing, even in the inanimate, there is a “soul,” which is the creative force that has created it—a being out of non-being—and continuously keeps [it] from reverting back to its former state of non-existence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Good luck with learning Pnimiyut HaTorah, in this case Mysticism. And, as the Rebbe writes (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/letters/default_cdo/aid/1872927/jewish/Learning-Chassidism-Gives-Ability-to-Believe.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Letter from 24th of Marcheshvan, 5720</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Incidentally, let me add that the Vilner Gaon (not only the Baal HaTanya, mind you) writes that those who do not learn Pnimius HaTorah prolong the Golus and delay the Geulo, and that without knowledge of Pnimius HaTorah it is impossible to know properly Nigle of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, the second source I would recommend you is reading the Kuntres Eitz HaChayim, written by the Rebbe Rashab (Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn from Lubavitch). The Kuntres can be viewed online <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144473/jewish/The-Tree-of-Life-Kuntres-Eitz-HaChayim.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/144474/jewish/Overview.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In the overview from this Kuntres</a>, it is explained that this Kuntres included extensive quotes from Kabbalistic texts, such as quotes from the Zohar.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Kuntres Etz HaChayim, employs far more technical wording than many other Chassidic sources. There are extensive quotes from the Zohar, the Etz HaChayim, and other Kabbalistic texts, as well as passages from the Talmud and the Midrash. The Rebbe Rashab begins with an abstract Chassidic concept, proceeds to develop its practical applications, and then, on the basis of these theoretical constructs, gives direct, pointed advice to the students of the yeshivah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You might be interested in the teachings of the Rebbe Simcha Bunim Bonhardt, the second Grand Rebbe of Peshischa. He was a Hassidic leader that was highly critical of the emphasis on mysticism, the miraculous, veneration of leaders, etc. He taught a philosophy emphasizing critical thought, individuality and authenticity in ones relationship with God. There is a pretty good English language book on him, <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/9655240037\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Quest for Authenticity</a>, and here's the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcha_Bunim_of_Peshischa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia page</a>. Though he was somewhat controversial in his day, his teachings are considered foundational to many different Hasidic sects extant today.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I would recommend a central and fundamental book of Hassidut: TANYA.

    "content": "# What was the process for acceptance of midrashim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud tells us that the Sages had long discussions about which books should be included in the Tanach [Bava Batra 14b-15a].  Their decisions were important.  First, the books they excluded do not have to be studied.  Second, they do not have to be included in yeshiva libraries, which caused many to have disappeared completely.  Third, and most importantly, they cannot be used to expound on the meaning of Torah verses.</p>\n<p>But I don't know of a similar process for acceptance of midrashim.  Was there one?  Where?  Is there a list of \"accepted\" midrashim for the three purposes listed above?  Where?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The canonization of holy books bore not spiritual, but purely Halachic implementations, such as ritual impurity of touching, proper disposal, handling, etc (see <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%AA%D7%91%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">טומאת כתבי הקודש</a>).</p>\n<p>Rabbinic literature does not have any of those limitations and therefore does not require canonization or codification.</p>\n<p>In general, unlike some other religions, Judaism doesn't have a centralized Halachic body that institutionalizes edicts once and for all. Therefore, in my understanding,  there's no \"acceptance\" in Judaism, but adoption. Different rabbis/communities adopted different rabbinic sources, for example, some accept \"Likutey Mohara\"N\" or the \"Tany\"A\" and some don't.</p>\n<p>Similarly, with the Midrashic literature, some texts were widely adopted as genuine, some were not, but because of their non-Halachic nature, it does not make any difference.</p>\n\n\n",

At the time the Torah was revealed, these were renewed and elaborated on. At that time the covenant to keep these laws forever was concluded with the Jewish people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.26.5.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on this pasuk says that most of the mitzvot Avraham kept, applied only to the time when Avraham lived in Eretz Yisrael:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, his observance of the Torah applied only in the Land of Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found a commentary from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.2.16.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni on Bereishis 2:16</a> where he links the word ויצו to the establishing of courts and judges in order to deal with disputes and violations of G-ds mitzvot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויצו, a reference to establishing courts and judges to deal with disputes and violations of G-d’s commandments. The Torah refers to this again in Genesis 18,19 when explaining why G-d discusses the imminent destruction of the Sodomites with Avraham.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are a few interesting points that I would like to point out:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Ramban explains that the observance of the Torah (this is the case with Avraham) was sometimes restricted to Eretz Yisrael</li>\n<li>The Rashbam explains that חוקותי ותורותי refer to the universal known laws given prior to Matan Torah, these include laws such as not murdering and not stealing. Thus, the Rashbam explains that חוקותי ותורותי refer to basic moral laws.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Jews left Mitzrayim (from Meitzar מיצר, meaning limitations but also distress as in Tehillim 118:5) and went on a \"spiritual and elevating journey towards the Torah, towards a connection with G-d\". Thus, after receiving the Torah, it makes sense that G-d instructs the Jewish people to establish courts. Because, on the plain level, as the Bartenura explains in his commentary on Avos 3:2 it was in order to make sure the power of the government was \"divided\" or limited.</p>\n<p>The Bartenura explains in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura_on_Pirkei_Avot.3.2.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 3:2</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>so too people, were it not for the fear of the government, each one who is bigger than his fellow would swallow his fellow (Avodah Zarah 54b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is the reason why G-d instructs us to establish courts and judges.</p>\n<p>But, the mitzvah of establishing courts, also has a <strong>deeper meaning</strong>, a spiritual meaning. The Ran (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derashot_HaRan.11.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derashos HaRan 11</a>) explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But they also need judges for an additional reason — <strong>to enforce the laws of the Torah</strong> and to punish those liable to stripes or to judicial death penalties, whether or not their transgression is detrimental to society.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it seems to me this mitzvah only applied when the Jews were living in Eretz Yisrael, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.16.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 16:18</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall appoint magistrates and officials for your tribes, <strong>in all the settlements that the L-RD your G-d is giving you</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it seems also to me that this mitzvah applied only <strong>after the giving of the Torah, since the main goal (see the commentary of the Ran) is to enforce Torah law</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Once Yaakov and his children went to Egypt, they were subject to the Par'o and the court system established in Egypt.

The Bnai Yisrael only needed to set up their own justice system after the Exodus and that was through Moshe.</p>\n<p>That system was set up and running through Moshe and Yisro then gave advice as to a better system.</p>\n\n\n",

Part of the text describes his early years as a Jew. At some point he speaks to an acquaintance from Eretz Yisrael named Justus, who mentions that his brother Avraham had traveled to Sykamina (probably the ancient non-Jewish name of Haifa; see <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23715808\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pp. 23-28) in Eretz Yisrael, where he heard local Jews mention \"that a prophet appeared, coming with the Saracens (Arabs) and he is proclaiming the arrival of the coming Anointed One and Christ.\" And then Avraham went to speak to a \"very scriptural old man\" who may have been a sage, from the description, who commented on these rumors by stating:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"He [the Saracen prophet] is a deceiver. Do prophets come with swords and chariots? Really these are works of disorder set in motion today, and I fear that the Christ who came earlier, whom the Christians worship, was the one sent by God and instead of him we shall accept <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armilus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hermolaos</a>. For Isaiah said that we Jews have a mistaken and hardened heart, until all the land is made a desert. But go forth, Mr. Abraham, and learn about this prophet who is appearing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Keeping in mind that this is a Christian polemical text, it's very likely that the Jews did not truly consider Jesus as the Mashiach simply because of the turn of events in Byzantium and the rise of Islam, but rather these are additions by the author or later scribes. The identity of the old man, who may have been a sage, remains unknown. Notably, though, elsewhere in the text an actual sage is mentioned, though similarly anonymous; a \"great teacher of the law\" from Teverya (<em>μέγας νομοδιδάσκαλος Τιβεριάδος</em> = megas nomodidaskalos Tiberiados), perhaps a Rosh Yeshiva or something similar.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Secrets_of_Rabbi_Simon_ben_Yohai\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nistarot Rabbi Shimon ben Yochai</a> is a likely 8th century (though some believe it to be from the late 7th century) pseudepigraphic work ascribed to Rashbi.

Among those that hold that it does reflect some historic event, there is a debate which event/period. One opinion is that it reflects events that occurred during the Galus Revolt of 351 CE. Another opinion, proposed by Amos Geula in his PhD dissertation <em>Lost Aggadic Works Known Only from Ashkenaz: Midrash Abkir, Midrash Esfa and Devarim Zuta</em> (in Hebrew), Hebrew University 2006, pp. 100-103 is that it reflects the years of the Arab Conquest of the Land of Israel. Specifically, Seir/the Fourth Empire refers to the Byzantines, who were kicked away from city to city since the arrival of the Arabs in the Land of Israel in 634 CE. The reference to Beit Guvrin hints at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Ajnadayn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Battle of Ajnadayn</a>, which was near Beit Guvrin, in summer of 634 CE.

Similarly Isaiah intimated that the coming of the Messiah will occur after the rise of the Madman, in the verse \"A man riding on an ass, a man riding on a camel, and two men riding on horses.\" (21:7). Now \"the man riding on an ass\" is a symbolical reference to the Messiah as is evident from another verse which describes him as \"lowly and riding on an ass\" (Zechariah 9:9). He will follow the \"man riding on the camel\" that is, the Arabic kingdom. The statement \"two men riding on horses\" refers to both empires, the Roman and the Arabian.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also, the Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Iggerot_HaRambam%2C_Iggeret_Teiman.13?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> that the Arabs were the people who, at the time the Rambam lived in, persecuted the Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>persecuted us severely, and passed baneful and discriminatory\nlegislation against us</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.2.17a.1?vhe=New_Torat_Emet_Zohar&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:16b:13- 2:17a:1</a>) explains that the Galut of Yishmael is the hardest one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֵית לָךְ אוּמָא מְכִּיכָא וּקְלִילָא וְנִבְזֵית קָמֵי קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא, כְּוָותַיְיהוּ דְּמִצְרָאֵי, וְיָהִיב לוֹן קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא שֻׁלְטָנוּתָא בְּגִינַיְיהוּ דְּיִשְׂרָאֵל. וְשִׁפְחָה כִּי תִירַשׁ גְּבִירְתָּהּ, דָּא הָגָר, דְּאוֹלִידַת לְיִשְׁמָעֵאל, שֶׁעָשָׂה כַּמָּה רָעוֹת לְיִשְׂרָאֵל, וְשָׁלַט בָּהֶם, וְעִינָּה אוֹתָם בְּכָל מִינֵי עִנּוּיִין, וְגָזַר עֲלֵיהֶם כַּמָּה שְׁמָדוֹת, וְעַד הַיּוֹם הֵם שׁוֹלְטִים עֲלֵיהֶם, וְאֵינָם מַנִּיחִים לָהֶם לַעֲמוֹד בְּדָתָם. וְאֵין לָךְ גָּלוּת קָשָׁה לְיִשְׂרָאֵל כְּמוֹ גָּלוּת יִשְׁמָעֵאל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Despite the heavy persecutions by the Ishmaelites, the Yemenite Jews, the ones Rambam adresses in his Iggeret Teiman, were the one who intensified the observance and preservation of their customs. Rabbi Eliezer Melamed, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Peninei_Halakhah%2C_Women%27s_Prayer.24.2.2?ven=Peninei_Halakhah,_English_ed._Yeshivat_Har_Bracha&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halakhah writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Yemenites, too, claim that their nusaḥ is most precise, for the Jews of Yemen, in all their years of exile, did not wander. Rather, in response to Arab persecution of Yemenite Jews, these communities intensified their dogged and meticulous preservation of their customs. Indeed, Yemenite Torah have been found to be closest in their precision to the Aleppo Codex, the standard of precision for the Torah text.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ran, Rabbi Nissim ben Reuven of Gerona, writes in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derashot_HaRan.1.12?ven=Derashot_HaRan,_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derashos HaRan 1:12</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For when the people of a certain kingdom would oppress them, they would move on to a different land, where they could serve the L-rd as they desired, as is the case in our present-day exile. For when enforced conversion began in the Arab lands, the Jews fled to a different land, and, thence, back to the Arab lands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to the Rambam, Zohar and the Ran, the \"Kingdom of the Arabs\" (Rambam's translation) were oppressing the Jews. However, I think Ishmaelites is a better translation than \"Arabs\", since Rabbi Yosef Albo writes (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaIkkarim%2C_Maamar_4.42.18?ven=Sefer_Ha-ikkarim,_Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America,_1929&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkkarim, Maamar 4:42:18</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and those who adopted the faith of the Mohammedans are called Ishmaelites, because the first converts were descendants of Ishmael.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In other words, how do we know that hassidut has divine roots and presents us with ontological truths?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The first part of your question is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is hassidut based on the canonical Jewish texts (Tanakh, Mishna,\nMidrash, Gemara)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The truth is that question is at the very heart of the debate over the validity of Chassidus that arose shortly after it began. The Misnagdim answered emphatically that no, it is not based on Jewish texts.</p>\n<p>Chassidim, on the other hand, say that it is based on Jewish texts, primarily the Kabbalah. Misnagdim reply that the Chassidim misunderstand these texts. In addition, anything new in Chassidus isn't good, while anything good isn't new.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elyakim_Schlesinger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Elyakim Schlesinger</a> in his book Hador v'Hatekufa (page 32) says that the Brisker Rav told him that once he was asked by a group of Chassidim what he has against Chassidus. He responded, \"You tell me what Chassidus is, and I will tell you why I am against it.\" In the next paragraph, he says that after Rav Menachem Mendel of Kotzk, only two (unnamed) groups of Chassidim were still problematic.</p>\n<p>Obviously, a Chassid would give you a very different answer, but this is the response of the Misnagdim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>My understanding of chassidut is this: the fundamental mechanics of existence are explained in mind numbing detail by authentic kabbalah. It is through this discipline that human intelligence is capable of interfacing with higher intelligence.</p>\n<p>Rabbinic judaism is the tradition of those individuals in the human species who mastered this kabbalistic science. These individuals developed systems for living life based on the knowledge they received from higher intelligence. This body of knowledge was recorded over some time to form the corpus of texts of \"rabbinic judaism.\"</p>\n<p>It is only due to the fact the texts were written down and the Israelites endured a multi-millennia exile that the wifi connection with higher intelligence was temporarily severed, thus the texts themselves took the place of the direct interface with higher intelligence.</p>\n<p>In the broader scheme of things the epistemological ground for true knowledge is not what is written in texts but in the experience of direct reception from higher intelligence.</p>\n<p>It takes an extremely unique kind of mind to be capable of receiving wisdom from higher intelligence. One who is able to do so will experience a profound kind of delight. Not all are gifted with this ability. In essence, chassidut was developed by the people who possessed the knowledge of how to generate the delight to those who were created to received but not generate, the delight. It is true that chassidut does enable reception of wisdom from above but it is incomparable to that received by a master of the kabbalistic wisdom itself.</p>\n<p>Originally all the Children of Israel had received directly from higher intelligence and all possessed a comprehension of this kabbalistic wisdom. When exile occurred and the Children of Israel were dispersed, as I said, the wifi connection with higher intelligence was severed.</p>\n<p>What intuition they had remained with them but dwindled over the course of the millennia - as they had no constant connection with the source to provide sustained nourishment to their intellects.</p>\n<p>There came a time when the sages of the generation saw the plight the Children of Israel were in and decided they would have to do something unprecedented. They developed a new technology, based on the original wisdom of kabbalah which some of them had retained a masterful knowledge of. This technology which became the chassidic tradition, would be capable of supplying the lost intuitive knowing to the children of Israel without their having to master the kabbalah as they had in ages past.</p>\n<p>The purpose of chassidut is this: the intuition itself, even without knowing the wisdom which generates this intuition, serves as a receptacle for the original wisdom. If enough people possess a strong intuition higher intelligence will be able to reveal the wisdom once again like it did on Mount Sinai and the Children of Israel will be restored to their original pure state. An age of unprecedented flourishing will result for all humanity once a certain threshold is met. By the look of things, this process seems to be accelerating in real time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>First of all, I think the sources <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/127944/27180\">I mentioned</a> in your previous question can also answer this question(s).</p>\n<p>You ask, \"is hassidut based on Tanach, Mishnah, Midrash or Gemara\"?

Furthermore, the nature of the Animilatic Soul of a Jew is inherently different than that of a Gentile. A Jew's Animalistic Soul is from the place known in Kabbalistic literature as \"קליפת נוגה\" - \"the Illuminated Shell\" which represents the potential for both Good and Evil and thus has an element of Good within it, it is thus compared to the \"עץ הדעת טוב ורע\" - \"The Tree of Knowledge of <em>Good and Evil</em>.\" A Gentile's animal soul however is seen to stem from a place that is purely evil and thus even the Good found within it is ultimately self-centered, as the Talmud <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.10b.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bava Basra 10b)</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּנְיָא אָמַר לָהֶן רַבָּן יוֹחָנָן בֶּן זַכַּאי לְתַלְמִידָיו בָּנַי מַהוּ שֶׁאָמַר הַכָּתוּב צְדָקָה תְרוֹמֵם גּוֹי  וְחֶסֶד לְאֻמִּים חַטָּאת נַעֲנָה רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר וְאָמַר צְדָקָה תְּרוֹמֵם גּוֹי אֵלּוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל דִּכְתִיב וּמִי כְּעַמְּךָ יִשְׂרָאֵל גּוֹי אֶחָד בָּאָרֶץ וָחָסֶד לְאֻמִּים חַטָּאת כׇּל צְדָקָה וָחֶסֶד שֶׁאוּמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם עוֹשִׂין חֵטְא הוּא לָהֶן שֶׁאֵינָם עוֹשִׂין אֶלָּא לְהִתְגַּדֵּל בּוֹ כְּמוֹ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר דִּי לֶהֱוֹן מְהַקְרְבִין נִיחוֹחִין לֶאֱלָהּ שְׁמַיָּא וּמְצַלַּיִן לְחַיֵּי מַלְכָּא וּבְנוֹהִי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It is taught in a baraita: Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai said to his students: My sons, what is the meaning of that which the verse states: “Righteousness exalts a nation, but the kindness of the peoples is sin” (Proverbs 14:34)? Rabbi Eliezer answered and said: “Righteousness exalts a nation”; these are the people of Israel, as it is written: “And who is like your people Israel, one nation on the earth?” (I Chronicles 17:21). “But the kindness of the peoples is sin,” meaning that all the acts of charity and kindness that the nations of the world perform is counted as a sin for them, since they perform them only to elevate themselves in prestige, as it is stated: “That they may sacrifice offerings of pleasing aroma to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king and of his sons” (Ezra 6:10).

The oil should be poured on his head\nand applied between his eyes in the form of the Greek letter chi,30\nlike this C as [Leviticus 8:12] states: \"And he poured the anointing\noil on Aaron's head and anointed him to sanctify him.\" The kings of\nthe Davidic dynasty are anointed [with the oil] spread as a crown on\ntheir foreheads.31 They should not be anointed on other places [on\ntheir bodies], nor should one use an excessive amount of oil.</p>\n<p>‏כֵּיצַד מוֹשְׁחִין אֶת הַכֹּהֵן. צָק אֶת הַשֶּׁמֶן עַל רֹאשׁוֹ\nוְסָךְ מִמֶּנּוּ עַל גַּבֵּי עֵינָיו כְּמִין כִּי יְוָנִית כָּזֶה X\nשֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ויקרא ח יב) \"וַיִּצֹק מִשֶּׁמֶן הַמִּשְׁחָה עַל רֹאשׁ\nאַהֲרֹן וַיִּמְשַׁח אֹתוֹ לְקַדְּשׁוֹ\". וּמַלְכֵי בֵּית דָּוִד\nמוֹשְׁחִין אוֹתָן כְּמִין נֵזֶר עַל רֹאשׁוֹ. וְלֹא יִמְשַׁח\nבִּמְקוֹמוֹת אֲחֵרוֹת וְלֹא יַרְבֶּה בְּשֶׁמֶן:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of these quotes seem to have a precedent in Tanakh in which Ezekiel has a vision in which people to be spared are marked with a Tau. Since Ezekiel is one of the more priestly prophets it makes sense to use a symbol that the priests would be familiar with and that would have some religious meaning.</p>\n<p>Ezekiel 9:4</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֤אמֶר יְהֹוָה֙ אֵלָ֔ו עֲבֹר֙ בְּת֣וֹךְ הָעִ֔יר בְּת֖וֹךְ\nיְרוּשָׁלָ֑͏ִם וְהִתְוִ֨יתָ <strong>תָּ֜ו</strong> עַל־מִצְח֣וֹת הָאֲנָשִׁ֗ים\nהַנֶּֽאֱנָחִים֙ וְהַנֶּ֣אֱנָקִ֔ים עַ֚ל כׇּל־הַתּ֣וֹעֵב֔וֹת\nהַֽנַּעֲשׂ֖וֹת בְּתוֹכָֽהּ׃ and the LORD said to him, “Pass through\nthe city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark on the foreheads of the\nmen who moan and groan because of all the abominations that are\ncommitted in it.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, marking someone with a Tau doesn't make much sense because we don't see the shape of ת being used anywhere else. And clearly the mark is supposed to have some religious significance. But my argument is that the mark of Tau is actually a Paleo Hebrew Tau that is shaped like an X</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mf5EF.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mf5EF.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>This same X symbol is used to anoint new priests, and the wafer offering. So I believe that once Paleo Hebrew fell out of use the Rabbis started substituting the Greek Chi to describe the X symbol, not realizing we used to have a letter in our Aleph Bet that already had that symbol.</p>\n<p>So to answer your question: Knowledge gets lost, and it's rarely restored. Even when we discover how things used to be we often ignore it and do things the way it makes sense to us now. With that logic in mind it doesn't come as a surprise that when the Gemara wants to describe what the X shape looks like they use a Greek example since most Jews at that time would not know that a Paleo Hebrew Tau (𐤕) looks like an X. Move forward some centuries and Tosefot's convoluted listing of possible examples make even more sense.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Consolidating my comments, the typical European Rishonic rabbi did not usually consult local Christian scholars to understand Jewish sources.

To that I would add this statement from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Eruvin.65a.10.1?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi&p2=Eruvin.65a.10&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on Eruvin 65a</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"\"When distressed, one should not issue decisions\" - I have looked over all of scripture and this is not in any of the texts and perhaps it is found in the Book of Ben Sira.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This verse does not appear in Ben Sira, neither the Greek nor the Hebrew versions (at least not those that we have today), yet the Greek Ben Sirach is part of the Catholic Bible and Rashi could have theoretically checked with local Christians.

    "title": "Is the TorahCalc Molad Calculator accurate?",
    "content": "# Is the TorahCalc Molad Calculator accurate?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been making an excel spreadsheet that calculates molads. I started from the Molad for Tishrei in Year 1 Anno Mundi. Based on various websites (including TorahCalc), the Molad was on Tuesday at 23:11 (11:11pm) and 1 cheilek. I used various \"if\" formulae to continue the series, and begun looking for errors caused by problems in the formulae. After fixing the formulae, I looked again and found something very curious.</p>\n<p>You see, the way to calculate the Molad from one month to the next (apparently) is by adding 1 day, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 1 cheilek. Sounds straigtforward? I thought so.</p>\n<p>According to TorahCalc, the Molad for Iyyar (Year 1) was Thursday, 16:19, 8 chalokim. Sivan was Shabbos, 05:03, 9 chalokim. Tammuz was Sunday, 17:47, 10 chalokim. So far so good. But, Av was Tuesday, 06:31, 12 chalokim. They have added two chalokim, instead of 1. Elul was Wednesday, 19:15, 12 chalokim. This time, they haven't added any chalokim (although this would be where they would have ended up had they added only 1 cheilek to the previous month. This seems to be something that you can observe on the TorahCalc Molad Calculator more than just a few times.</p>\n<p><strong>My question is as follows:</strong> Is the formula of adding 1 day, 12 hours, 44 minutes, and 1 cheilek, a rule that always strictly applies (meaning that TorahCalc is simply wrong) or is there some variation with the chalokim on occasion (meaning that TorahCalc is correct)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<h4>In short</h4>\n<p>It's their algorithm. It appears that they are using an inaccurate constant of 3.3 to back into the number of chalakim from the number of seconds. This constant should instead be 3 + (1/3). Most of the time this is okay, but if the intermediate result aligns just right, an error is introduced that produces the wrong number for the chalakim result.</p>\n<h4>Details</h4>\n<p>Since they are using Javascript to calculate the Molad, it should be pretty simple to reverse-engineer their approach.</p>\n<p>It seems like the code's starting point is at the year 5776, which it ties to the magic number <code>144218565e4</code>. This is the number of milliseconds since 1/1/1970, so some quick math gives us the date Sep 13 2015 19:07:30. In other words, the Molad for Tishrei 5776 was Sep 13 2015, 19:07 and 9 chalakim.</p>\n<p>For years before or after that, the code loops in either direction by quickly calculating the number of months (12 or 13) in each Hebrew year (<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/6377/128\">actually using this</a>), and then multiplying that by the <code>moladInterval</code> which it defines as <code>765433e4 / 3</code>. This number is basically 29 days, 12 hours, and 793 chalakim in milliseconds.</p>\n<p>The code then uses the same interval to adjust for the actual month that it is trying to calculate.</p>\n<p>When outputting the result in text, the code determines the number of chalakim to display by taking the number of seconds, dividing it by 3.3 and then rounding to the nearest integer. Simple math says that this is incorrect - the correct approach would be to divide by 3 + (1/3).</p>\n<p>Why? If there are 1,080 chalakim per minute, then each second = 1080 / 60 / 60 = 0.3 chalakim. So if we want to go from seconds back to chalakim we would divide by 0.3 which is the same as multiplying by 3 + (1/3) which is approximately 3.333333 with the decimals continuing, and not just 3.3.</p>\n<h4>Your Examples</h4>\n<p>I was unable to reproduce the examples you provided (if you provide your operating system and browser version I can further explore whether this might vary by each person's environment). More specifically, when I plug in the examples you gave at <a href=\"https://www.torahcalc.com/molad/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.torahcalc.com/molad/</a>, I obtain:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tammuz, year 1 = Sunday, May 30, -3760, 5:47 pm and 14 chalakim</li>\n<li>Av, year 1 = Tuesday, June 29, -3760, 6:31 am and 15 chalakim</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The good news is that I was able to find other situations where I <em>can</em> reproduce the issue. On my system, one such example occurs in the year 121:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tishrei, year 121 = Thursday, September 1, -3641, 8:49 am and 13 chalakim</li>\n<li>Cheshvan, year 121 = Friday, September 30, -3641, 9:33 pm and 15 chalakim</li>\n<li>Kislev, year 121 = Sunday, October 30, -3641, 10:17 am and 15 chalakim</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For the Cheshvan example, the precise result obtained on my system is -177010863970000.97. When we convert this to a date, we obtain 48 seconds. 48 divided by 3.3 rounds to 15, which is what their code is doing. If we instead divide by 48 by 3 + (1/3) we would round to 14 which would be correct.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Finally, it should certainly be noted that working backwards from a random date using this simplified approach is very much incorrect, for a number of potential reasons. As their own website notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please note that dates before the adoption of the Gregorian calendar in 1752 may be innacurate. TorahCalc does not take into account the advancement of 11 days between 2 September 1752 to 14 September 1752. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_(New_Style)_Act_1750#England_and_Wales\" rel=\"noreferrer\">More info</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(See his responsa for a lengthy treatment of Gittin 37 and it's relevance to this discussion).</p>\n<p>However, many authorities rule that conquests of war are legally of the victor (see <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9D_%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%98_%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam Avadim 9:4</a>, Radvaz 3:533). The Radvaz writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דחוק מלאכים הוא כשלוכדים המדינה בכח המלחמה כל הבתים והשדות והכרמים הם\nשלו וגם העם הם לו למס עובד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the Chasam Sofer (Responsa Vol 2, 12) and Zera Avraham (Siman 24) explain that although it is prohibited (as per Sanhedrin 59), it is still legally effective, and the victor is entitled to the spoils of war.</p>\n<p><strong>Position of the Netziv that murder is not prohibited in war situations</strong></p>\n<p>The Netziv (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.9.5?vhe=Sefer_Torat_Elohim,_Vilna_1879&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hamek Davar, Bereishis 9:5</a>) writes regarding the prohibition of murder given to gentiles (ואך את דמכם לנפשתיכם אדרש מיד כל חיה אדרשנו ומיד האדם מיד איש אחיו אדרש את נפש האדם), that circumstances of war are different:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>מיד איש אחיו.</strong> פירש הקב״ה אימתי האדם נענש בשעה שראוי לנהוג באחוה. <strong>משא״כ\nבשעת מלחמה ועת לשנוא אז עת להרוג ואין עונש ע״ז כלל</strong>. כי כך נוסד העולם.\nוכדאי׳ בשבועות ל״ה מלכותא לקטלא חד משיתא לא מיענש ואפי׳ מלך ישראל מותר\nלעשות מלחמת הרשות אע״ג שכמה מישראל יהרגו עי״ז וע׳ ס׳ דברים כ׳ ח׳:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He writes that deaths incurred during war - even a voluntary war - are fundamentally different to murder.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>What I heard from my Rebbe in the name of the sefer D'var Avraham is that it is clear that the Torah generally does not treat war as murder or theft. The line between them is that war has to be declared by the highest level of government in order to be valid, otherwise it is just theft and murder.</p>\n<p>(I heard this a few years ago, so this is to the best of my recollection.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I am an Italian Noahide.</p>\n<p>My humble opinion is that the question must also be framed in the light of the Noahide precept to establish a legislative and judicial system, which is functional both to ensure compliance with the other Noahide precepts, and the harmonious development of Gentile communities. In this perspective, I believe it is fundamental to evaluate the case in relation to International Law, as codified by the relevant conventions to which most of the Gentile Nations have adhered. On the basis of this law , which I therefore consider to derive from the Noahide precept of \"dinim\", the use of armed violence is lawful only in self-defense against the aggression of a foreign state, or to defend a third country that has been attacked, prior in the last case a specific international mandate (for example by Onu or Nato).</p>\n<p>I repeat that this is my humble personal opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone know where it could be found?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In a different context, the Rambam has a famous theory regarding sacrifices. In the words of <a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/12/5/363/htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reuven Chaim Klein</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Maimonides explains that the Torah’s main objective is to eradicate\nthe viewpoint of paganism. Thus, <strong>to truly understand the Torah’s\noriginal intent, one must be familiar with the philosophies and\npractices of ancient idolaters</strong> [...]</p>\n<p>Taking this idea a step further, Maimonides seemingly assumes that\nritual sacrifices are a sub-optimal form of worship, leading him to\nmaking the bold statement that the Torah instituted its system of\nritual sacrifices to facilitate the rejection of idolatrous practices.\n<strong>> He explains that human nature is that whatever people have accustomed\nthemselves to doing becomes so ingrained in their nature that it\ncannot be easily uprooted. Man cannot successfully transition from one\nextreme to the other without some time to acclimate.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.32.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">More Nevuchim 3:32</a> for the original, here are relevant quotes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is, namely, impossible to go suddenly from one extreme to the\nother: it is therefore according to the nature of man impossible for\nhim suddenly to discontinue everything to which he has been\naccustomed. [...] But the custom which was in those days general among\nall men, and the general mode of worship in which the Israelites were\nbrought up, consisted in sacrificing animals in those temples which\ncontained certain images, to bow down to those images, and to burn\nincense before them; religious and ascetic persons were in those days\nthe persons that were devoted to the service in the temples erected to\nthe stars, as has been explained by us. It was in accordance with the\nwisdom and plan of God, as displayed in the whole Creation, that He\ndid not command us to give up and to discontinue all these manners of\nservice; for to obey such a commandment it would have been contrary to\nthe nature of man, who generally cleaves to that to which he is used\n[...]</p>\n<p>For this reason God allowed these kinds of service to continue; He\ntransferred to His service that which had formerly served as a worship\nof created beings, and of things imaginary and unreal, and commanded\nus to serve Him in the same manner  [...]</p>\n<p>By this Divine plan it was effected that the traces of idolatry were\nblotted out, and the truly great principle of our faith, the Existence\nand Unity of God, was firmly established; this result was thus\nobtained without deterring or confusing the minds of the people by the\nabolition of the service to which they were accustomed and which alone\nwas familiar to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The last  two cases don't seem accurate . You may not kill an enemy nation and must allow those who want to run away the ability to do so (Mechilta in Parshas Masey)You never kill women and children and always allow those who want to accept surrender terms to do so . Even by the Shiva Ammim (see Rambam Hilchos Melochim Chapter six)</p>\n<p>Some people may question how the rest of what the Rambam says there  that fits with their current moral beliefs  but in that context it must be realized that (among other things)  you weren't dealing with people who followed the contemporary rules of war either.</p>\n<p>You won't find the last paragraph in the Rishonim or even  Achronim because they were written before things like the Geneva Convention and the current rules of war. It would only be latter day sources who would have an issue causing them to say it.</p>\n<p>As far as giving  a rape victim the right  to force her rapist to marry her (but not the other way around of course) I'm not sure what the issue with that is even by today's standards.</p>\n<p>As far as slavery is concerned  there are a few sources dating from the mid 1800s who, with some variation, say that the Torah allowed (but did not encourage) slavery because in a situation   where slavery is widespread it would be better even for the\nslave himself   to be owned by someone who has  very strict limitations on how he may treat a slave (and even much stricter limitations on when  he may acquire a slave who had once been a free man) than to be sold to anyone out there.</p>\n<p>To give some perspective from my grandfather z'l who unlike anyone reading this WAS a slave : He never would have survived the six years of pure torture from when Germany invaded Poland until after WWII if not for  two different  few month periods when he was doing slave labor on some German commercial farm. The guy who owned the farm was no Tzadik and certainly did not follow the Torah's rules for  treating an Eved Canaani. Let alone the Midas Chasidus for doing so heavily encouraged  in Gemorah.  But the guy  also didn't kill, beat or starve his slave laborers. That \"respite\" allowed my grandfather the ability to \"recuperate\" and live. It was at that time that he came to realize that when slavery is rampant anyway you aren't doing anyone a favor by forbidding it for a limited group. Better let them have it with strict rules like the Torah does.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I do not know if this helps, but <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Chaim_Ephraim_of_Sudilkov\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Moshe Chaim Ephraim of Sudilkov</a>, the grandson of the Baal Shem Tov writes in his sefer \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Degel_Machaneh_Ephraim%2C_Bereshit.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Degel Machaneh Ephraim, Parshas Bereishis</a>\" that in every generation, the holy scholars (of that generation) are \"making up\" the Torah since the Torah is interpreted according to the needs of that generation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In every generation, the scholars (of that generation) are making up [alternative translation: are finishing, or filling up] the Torah, because the Torah is being interpreted in every generations according to the needs of that generation And according to the source of their souls - so is God enlightening the eyes of the wise people of that generation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kedushat_Levi%2C_Exodus%2C_Yitro.22?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Kedushat Levi writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is a tremendous power that G’d has granted to us, i.e. ‎that the righteous people who will in different generations reveal ‎these “new” aspects of the Torah will become an integral part of ‎the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The following information can be found in great detail in the Sefer: <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncsy-education/Poaching%20Employees%20from%20Rival%20Companies.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Headlines Halachic Debates Of Current Events: Poaching Employees from Rival Companies by Rabbi Dovid Lichtenstein</a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Kiddushin.59a.6.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos</a> on the Gemara in Kiddushin 59a <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/kidushin/tosfos/kd-ts-059.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אם שכר בעה\"ב מלמד אחד, יכול בע\"ה אחר לשכור אותו מלמד עצמו</p>\n<p>However, in the event that Reuven hires a Melamed, Shimon is permitted\nto employ the same Melamed</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav says that a laborer may reconsider and quit his job, even at midday (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.10a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 10a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rava responded: But doesn’t Rav say that a laborer may reconsider and quit his job, even at midday?

And if the poaching results in damage to the livelihood of the competitor (see: משפטי התורה 1:50 by Rav Tzvi Shpitz) <a href=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/ncsy-education/Poaching%20Employees%20from%20Rival%20Companies.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Headlines Halachic Debates Of Current Events: Poaching Employees from Rival Companies, p.7)</a></p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, concluding there are a few interesting points that can be taken from the commentary of the Tosfos and from the work by Rabbi Dovid Lichtenstein:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>According to the Tosfos, poaching is allowed, only if an agency \"really wants\" \"this Melamed\" and \"this Melamed cannot be found elsewhere\".</li>\n<li>According to Ravi Tzvi Shpitz, poaching is not allowed if it would \"damage\" the livelihood of the employee</li>\n<li>As a employee, you are \"free to go\" whenever you want, since you are only \"G-ds'slave\"</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are however, different opinions on this explanation, see for example what <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/weekly-halacha-5761-lechlecha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Doniel Neustadt writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is prohibited for one to offer his services to an employer if he will be taking away another person’s job</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This statement seems to be related to the explanation given by Rabbi Tzvi Shpitz.</p>\n\n\n",

It would not, however, be correct to give the word והתנחלתם the meaning: “leave them as an inheritance to your children”, for if this were intended it should have written: והנחלתם אותם לבניכם (the Hiphil), but והתנחלתם (which is the Hithpael form) is equivalent to והתחזקתם “you may hold them as your possession”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thank you</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Hebrew, the word נחלה means inheritance. If the word would have been written והנחלתם it would mean to pass on the inheritance, or bequeath. Since the verse says והתנחלתם instead, the verb is reflexive and refers to an effect on the one doing the action (hispael in dikduk terms). In this case, the command is to the parents to keep the slaves as a potential inheritance for their children later on.</p>\n\n\n",

The Shelah explains that, when making the original beracha, one’s intention is to have it extend until the end of tefilla regardless of such breaks. Although there is not unanimity on the matter, that seems to be the more accepted practice (Mishna Berura 25:42; Kaf Hachayim 25:77). Therefore, it is not necessary to determine if the tefillin slipped so much to break the fulfillment of the mitzva. This along with the answer to your question allows one to rectify the situation and continue tefilla without fanfare, which is generally best.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also this explanation on <a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Putting_On_and_Removing_Tefillin#:%7E:text=if%20possible.%5B86%5D-,If%20One%20Mistakenly%20Put%20on%20the%20Tefillin%20Shel%20Rosh%20First,yad%2C%20and%20then%20re%2Ddon%20the%20Tefillin%20shel%20rosh.%5B88%5D,-If%20One%20Only\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia</a> which explains that if the Tefillin shel rosh is incorrectly placed, it should be taken off and replaced on the right place.

He declared: Even though the Holy One, blessed be He, has decreed that we should eat unclean food, He did so only to test us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.17.17.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni on Bereishis 17:17</a> seems to be relevant to this explanation given by the Midrash:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the righteous are allowed to carry out their plans, i.e. what is in their hearts, as they are in charge of their hearts</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.1.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Daniel 1:8)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king’s food or the wine he drank</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the Shema, we say \"And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand\"- <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.8?ven=The_Rashi_chumash_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:8</a>.</p>\n<p>On this, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.90.1.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akeidat Yitzchak</a> comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"You shall bind them as a sign,\" <strong>are warnings to observe regulations about forbidden foods</strong>, reminders to limit our social contacts with gentiles. \"They shall be as frontlets between your eyes.\" These are warnings not to be misled by what our eyes behold, to be led astray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, just as Avraham Avinu was tested, so was Daniel tested by G-d, maybe to see if he would observe the regulations concerning forbidden foods, so when Daniel got offered to eat from the King's food, he resolved not to defile himself with it (the King's food). As the Midrash explains (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma_Buber%2C_Vayera.43.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanchuma Buber, Vayera 43:1</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Daniel did not accept it. Instead he said: Although the Holy One has decreed for us to eat unclean bread, he wants to test us. We, however, will do our part; and the Holy One will do his.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>G-d tested Daniel with this test, but Daniel \"passed the test\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma_Buber%2C_Vayera.43.1?lang=bi&with=Daniel&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">because</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They said to him: Yes, because we are of the children of that person who withstood the test of ten trials from G-d.

And so it states with regard to the kindness done for Daniel and his associates: “So the steward took away their food and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.1.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daniel 1:16</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A commentary thereon, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=5989&st=&pgnum=124\" rel=\"noreferrer\">באור כנפי יונה</a> (by Rabbi Jonah Etilzohn), cites the Meor Enayim of Azariah dei Rossi (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38853&st=&pgnum=19&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">חלק אמרי בינה פ' ג</a>) regarding the reason for the destruction of the Galilee: <strong>שמוסב על כיתה הרביעית שהיה נמצא בין היהודים בבית שני</strong> - that it is due to the Fourth Sect, which was found amongst the Jews during the Second Temple Era.</p>\n<p>The Fourth Sect, is a reference to the followers of Judas the Galilean (יהודה בן חזקיה) also known as the Zealots (קנאים). They were an extremist group whose actions, according to Josephus, instigated the war against the Romans which culminated in the destruction of the Second Temple.</p>\n<p>It would seem then, that according to dei Rossi, the reason that the Galilee will be destroyed in the period immediately precipitating the messianic advent is to atone for the fact that Judas the Galilean, and his Zealots who caused the destruction of the Temple, were from the Galilee.</p>\n<p>This tradition foretelling destruction in the Galilee appears to have been taken literally by several figures who lived through periods of destruction in the region. R. Immanuel Hai Richhi in his work Hon Ashir (Sotah, ch. 9) quoted the line והגליל יחרב and continued to describe how Safed and its environs in the Galilee had been subject to destruction but was now seeing many Jews return to the area, and over the span of two years witnessed the building of new homes each day. He understood the destruction to have been fulfilled and accordingly saw the rebuilding as a hopeful sign for the messianic future. Similarly, R. Israel Shklov, who lived through the Safed pogrom of 1834 tied it to the tradition predicting destruction in the Galilee and a sign of the imminence of the messianic era.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Interesting side note: the same tradition is brought down verbatim in the name of Rabi Eliezer haGadol in Sotah 49a-b, in the name of Resh Laqish in Midrash Rabbah, in the name of Rav Avin in Pesiqta Rabbati... there were some others as well that I'm not recalling. Accordingly it would appear that this tradition  concerning the destruction of the Galilee was in wide circulation and is not easily attributed solely to R. Yehudah. I wouldn't be certain that the tradition is based on a pasuq either.</p>\n\n\n",

If we follow the rules I started with, that means they retain their past tense, even though there's a <em>vav</em> before it.</p>\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n<p>Exodus 25:11:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְצִפִּיתָ֤ אֹתוֹ֙ זָהָ֣ב טָה֔וֹר מִבַּ֥יִת וּמִח֖וּץ תְּצַפֶּ֑נּוּ <strong>וְעָשִׂ֧יתָ</strong> עָלָ֛יו זֵ֥ר זָהָ֖ב סָבִֽיב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice וצפית has the accent at the end.</p>\n<p>Exodus 25:12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְיָצַ֣קְתָּ</strong> לּ֗וֹ אַרְבַּע֙ טַבְּעֹ֣ת זָהָ֔ב וְנָ֣תַתָּ֔ה עַ֖ל אַרְבַּ֣ע פַּעֲמֹתָ֑יו וּשְׁתֵּ֣י טַבָּעֹ֗ת עַל־צַלְעוֹ֙ הָֽאֶחָ֔ת וּשְׁתֵּי֙ טַבָּעֹ֔ת עַל־צַלְע֖וֹ הַשֵּׁנִֽית׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Exodus 25:13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְעָשִׂ֥יתָ</strong> בַדֵּ֖י עֲצֵ֣י שִׁטִּ֑ים וְצִפִּיתָ֥ אֹתָ֖ם זָהָֽב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again, וצפית has the accent at the end.</p>\n<p>Exodus 26:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וְעָשִׂ֕יתָ</strong> חֲמִשִּׁ֖ים קַרְסֵ֣י זָהָ֑ב וְחִבַּרְתָּ֨ אֶת־הַיְרִיעֹ֜ת אִשָּׁ֤ה אֶל־אֲחֹתָהּ֙ בַּקְּרָסִ֔ים וְהָיָ֥ה הַמִּשְׁכָּ֖ן אֶחָֽד׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice וחברת has the accent at the end.</p>\n<p>The examples are too numerous to list. What's the reason for this? Either grammatically, or if there's some deeper message here. I once asked a grammar expert and he wasn't sure, so we'll see what you guys come up with.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>These are still \"vav hahipuch\". Joüon & Muraoka's <em>Grammar of Biblical Hebrew</em> (Section 43b) has the following to say about the accent. (I can't display vowels sitting under hyphen, so I've replaced them with words in brackets.) Notably, there's no unified explanation for these, so it seems to be a phonological issue at play here.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In ל״א and ל״ה verbs the stress often does not advance. In this matter one can hardly formulate hard and fast rules. One can nevertheless note that [א preceded by kamats] and [י preceded by ḥiriq] tend to retain the stress more than [א preceded by tsere] and [י preceded by tsere] respectively. Moreover, it is necessary to distinguish between various conjugations, because the Qal conjugation deserves special treatment. Having said this, we can make the following observations<sup>1</sup>:</p>\n<p>ל״א verbs: In Qal, the vowel [kamats] of action verbs and [tsere] of stative\nverbs retain the stress: וּבָ֫אתִי,‎ וְיָצָ֫אתָ, ‎ וְיָרֵ֫יתָ. In the other conjugations [tsere] loses its stress: וּמִלֵּיתָ֫, ‎ וְהֵבֵאתִ֫י,‎ וְהוֹצֵאתִ֫י.</p>\n<p>ל״ה verbs: In Qal, the vowel [י preceded by ḥiriq] retains its stress, e.g. וְעָשִׂ֫יתָ‎ (89 examples), וְעָשִׂ֫יתִי‎ (20 x); וְהָיִ֫יתָ,‎ וְהָיִ֫יתִי. In the other conjugations, [י preceded by ḥiriq] generally retains the stress, but [י preceded by tsere] loses it; thus one finds וְהַעֲל‬ִ֫יתָ in Dt 27.6; Jdg 6.26; Jer 38.10, but וְהַעֲלֵיתָ֫ in Ex 40.4.</p>\n<p>Observation. Before the gutteral א the form tends to be mil'ra (cf. Section 33). Thus instead of וּבָ֫אתָ one finds וּבָאתָ֫ before א, e.g. Zech 6.10; instead of וְהִשְׁקִ֫יתָ Dt 11.10 one finds וְהִשׁקִיתָ֫ את־ Nu 20.8; Jer 35.2.</p>\n<hr>\n<sup>1</sup> When the penultimate is a closed syllable, the stress shifts to the ultima, and the same tendency exists where both the penultimate and the antepenultimate are naturally long. See C.H. Gordon, \"The accentual shift in the perfect with a Waw consecutive,\" JBL 57 (1938) 319-25, and J. Blau, IOS 1 (1971) 15-18. F.R. Blake justly points to a major category of exceptions to Gordon's rule, namely וְהִקְטִ֫ילוּ and וְהִקְטִ֫ילָה: JBL 63 (1944) 285, n. 29. Cf. also E.J. Revell, \"Stress and the 'Waw consecutive' in BH,\" JAOS 104 (1984) 437-44.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Will one fulfill his obligation of hearing the shofar on Rosh Hashanah if it is done via livestream due to Covid reasons?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is an echoing sound so not sure if Rosh Hashanah 3:7 agrees or disagrees.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>During \"normal circumstances\", e.g. non-Covid situations, it seems to be not allowed to hear the Shofar over an internet connection. See for example what the Lubavitcher Rebbe says (Torat Menachem, 5744, vol. 3, Parshat Balak, p. 2124. See: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template_cdo/aid/4853572/jewish/Shofar-Over-the-Internet-During-Elul.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shofar Over the Internet During Elul?</a>). The Rebbe writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Regarding hearing the Torah or the Megillah et al., one does not fulfill their obligation by hearing it through a tape or other device . . . even with respect to the custom of hearing the shofar during the month of Elul, which is done merely to arouse the person to do teshuvah, as the verse states, “Will a shofar be sounded in the city and the people not tremble?” one should not hear it through a recording, since it needs to arouse one’s feelings to teshuvah and it needs to be done similar to “words that come from the heart enter the heart,” which does not apply to hearing through these devices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.27b.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Rosh Hashanah 27b)</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>if he clearly heard the sound of the shofar, he has fulfilled his obligation; but if he heard the sound of an echo, he has not fulfilled his obligation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3376118/jewish/Shulchan-Aruch-Chapter-587-Laws-Relating-to-One-who-Sounds-the-Shofar-in-a-Cistern.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Shulchan Aruch HaRav (Alter Rebbe) (587:1)</a> states also that it is not permitted:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sound of the shofar must be heard without the admixture of any other sound at all. If one heard the sound [of the shofar] together with another sound, he has not fulfilled his obligation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to these sources, the sound of the Shofar needs to be heard by the person in a clear way, thus directly. If you listen to the Shofar via Teams or Zoom, there can be some noise and that makes the sound of the Shofar not clear.</p>\n<p>But what to do during Covid-19?</p>\n<p>On viewing a Livestream on Shabbos, <a href=\"https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/halakhic-guidance-cjls-about-coronavirus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Halakhic Guidance from CJLS about Coronavirus</a> says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our committee has not made a formal ruling on livestreaming on Shabbat and Yom Tov (a copy of the draft proposal is available to RA members by request), but for the current sha’at hadehak, (pressing circumstances) those congregations that are already offering streaming and that are still able to hold services with a minyan, should encourage members whose health may be at risk, or whose presence may be a risk to others, to stay home and make use of this option if the alternative would be to risk their own health or the health of others by attending services. Every attempt should be made to reduce potential violations of shabbat (for example, activating the stream before Shabbat or holiday, or having the stream activated in an unusual way, or by someone who is not of the Jewish faith).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On hearing the Megillah or the Shofar, <a href=\"https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/story/halakhic-guidance-cjls-about-coronavirus#:%7E:text=Some%20poskim%20have,not%20a%20recording.%C2%A0%C2%A0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">they write</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some poskim have expressed concern about whether one fulfills one’s obligation to hear Megillah reading by doing so via amplification or electronic reproduction, declaring it to be similar to shofar, where the mitzvah is to “hear” the shofar, so the actual sound must be heard.  In fact, the Mitzvah of megillah is described in terms of its reading: “mikra megillah.” hearing it is just another form of reading it. Hearing the Megillah being read via telephone or live streaming, is permitted when necessary, so long as the sound is undistorted, live and not a recording.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A source I highly recommend reading is <a href=\"https://collectingthesetimes.org/s/collecting-these-times/item/6428\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פסקי קורונה</a> (Piskei Corona) by Rav Hershel Schachter, a responsa specially made for Covid-19.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>So, concluding: \"Hearing the Megillah being read via telephone or live streaming, is permitted when necessary, so long as the sound is undistorted, live and not a recording.\"- it seems that this also applies to hearing the Shofar, only if the sound is undistorted, live and not a recording (not from 1 hour ago for example).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Corona \"parties\" for children\n\n## Frage\n\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Particularly throughout this present omicron wave, people have floated the idea of having childrens' \"corona parties\". In such a 'party' parents invite previously uninfected children to be in close proximity with a known corona virus carrier in order to infect their child, contract the virus with the eventual goal of developing antibodies. Many people may remember having similar \"chicken pox\" parties when they were younger! This has changed significantly with the recent development of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varicella_vaccine\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Varicella vaccine</a> which protects children against chickenpox.</p>\n<p>The future for corona remains unclear.  Pharmaceutical companies are developing more generic vaccines for corona viruses which hope to cover potential future variants as well. There is a debate surrounding the differences in efficacy of the current vaccine when comparing the different variants and how it affects different parts of the population. There is also emerging data regarding the role of natural immunity in the debate of strategy to handle the pandemic. In Israel (and other places) the vaccinated as well as the recovered (i.e. people with antibodies) receive green passes. It's hard to see where public policy will go. There are many unknowns.</p>\n<p>Despite the unknowns, I am interested in the halachic considerations surrounding the idea of \"corona parties\".</p>\n<h2>Question</h2>\n<p>Are there responsa regarding the halachic acceptability of \"chicken pox parties\" or similar intentional efforts to pick up a contagion on one's own terms? Are there contemporary responsa specifically about the acceptability of \"Corona parties\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Regarding \"corona parties\", one contemporary Rabbi did indeed rule that it is forbidden to purposely get together to infect oneselves. <a href=\"https://tikvahfund.org/faculty/yehoshua-pfeffer/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehoshua Pfeffer</a> is quoted in <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/is-ultra-orthodox-ideological-disobedience-fueling-israels-soaring-virus-rate/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this late 2020 article</a> as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There have been rumors of clandestine Haredi attempts to aim at herd immunity, and of young people trying to get infected to advance this. These rumors are unconfirmed — but it’s clear that some yeshiva students are discussing the possibility of intentional infection for ostensibly pragmatic reasons.</p>\n<p>“In my rabbinic capacity I’ve received questions from bohrim over whether it would be permitted to infect themselves for all sorts of reasons,” said Pfeffer, using the word for yeshiva students. “Some said they want to go into the winter, main study time in yeshivas, without concern of coronavirus.” His response was a clear no.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p>\n<p>In the book <a href=\"https://images.shulcloud.com/562/uploads/ShavuosNightLearning-Risk-in-HalachaShavuos5780.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Headlines: Halachic Debates of Current Events\"</a> the author cites Rav Malkiel Tzvi Tannenbaum of Lomza in Divrei Malkiel 5:35</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] We thus see that it is permissible to place oneself in a situation of possible danger, as long as there is only a remote risk. Elaboration is needed to explain the limits in this regard [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if you read the mentioned article, you'll find out that it is not that easy to define what is \"a remote risk\". Rav Eliezer Waldenberg (Tzitz Eliezer 9:17) applies this to doctors, who, due to their profession, need to help people and therefore can get in a hazardous situation (p. 276).</p>\n<p>So, to this, Rav Elchanan Wasserman (Kovetz Shiurim, Ketubos 136) explains that when one is able to be careful and he is not (careful), he puts himself and his life at risk (p. 275).</p>\n<p><strong>Adapted from <a href=\"https://images.shulcloud.com/562/uploads/ShavuosNightLearning-Risk-in-HalachaShavuos5780.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Headlines: Halachic Debates of Current Events\"</a></strong></p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Rambam <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088927/jewish/Rotzeach-uShmirat-Nefesh-Chapter-Eleven.htm#:%7E:text=Similarly%2C%20it%20is,to%20be%20spilled.%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Rotzeach uShmirat Nefesh, chapter 11:4)</a> explains that it is a positive mitzvah to remove any obstacle that might pose a danger to life:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, it is a positive mitzvah to remove any obstacle that could pose a danger to life, and to be very careful regarding these matters, as Deuteronomy 4:9 states: \"Beware for yourself; and guard your soul.\" If a person leaves a dangerous obstacle and does not remove it, he negates the observance of a positive commandment, and violates the negative commandment: \"Do not cause blood to be spilled.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if you are trying to get infected, for whatever the reason may be, according to Halacha, this is not allowed. The Torah tells us to \"build a roof\", e.g. guard your life and health, why would one breaks down the roof in order to \"fall down the roof\"?</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_Chasidim.673.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Chasidim (Siman 673)</a> writes that if you have a skin-disease, you should not bathe with another person:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפני עור לא תתן מכשול שלא ירחץ אדם שהוא מוכה שחין עם יהודי אחר אלא א\"כ יודיענו שנאמר (ויקרא יט יח) ואהבת לרעך כמוך וכתיב (ויקרא יט טז) ולא תעמוד על דם רעך:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Answering your question</strong></p>\n<p>In your question, you ask:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Are there contemporary responsa specifically about the acceptability of \"Corona parties\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a great work called <a href=\"https://web.colby.edu/coronaguidance/files/2021/11/Tzurba-Halachot-of-the-COVID-19-Era.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Tzurba  M’Rabanan, Special volume: Halachot of the COVID-19 Era\" (2020)</a> by Rav Benzion Algazi, see also the <a href=\"https://www.tzurbaolami.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">website</a>.

Rabbi Chaim instructed that if the doctor wished to pray he must construct barriers around his seat to separate him from his neighbors; he must enter the shul first and leave last (similar to the rules of a tzora’as patient, Negaim, chapter 13:12)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Reference List</strong></p>\n<p>Lichtenstein, D.

It seems like this could be a far larger list though, especially as some cases appear to not actually be tied to the action of ploughing itself (eg. wearing the Choshen) and some seem quite far fetched.</p>\n<p>Some possible other examples: -</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If he kills someone with the plough</li>\n<li>If he is eating pork at the time</li>\n<li>If he is eating on Yom Kippur</li>\n<li>If he is saying lashon hara at the time</li>\n</ul>\n<p>etc etc. - the possible list is almost endless, so the question is why were these specific cases chosen?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Mishnah quoted by the Gemara pretty much asks the question using a different case: someone who wore clothing of <em>sha'atnez</em> while plowing. The Mishna says that is not relevant, as the wearing of sha'atnez is not connected to the plowing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חנניא בן חכינאי אומר אף הלובש כלאים אמרו לו אינו השם אמר להם אף הנזיר לא הוא השם:<br />\nḤananya ben Ḥakhinai says: If he was wearing a garment consisting of diverse kinds of wool and linen while plowing he is also flogged for violating that prohibition. The Sages said to him: That is not a prohibition in the same category as the others, as it is not connected to the act of plowing. Ḥananya ben Ḥakhinai said to them: According to that criterion, the fact that he is a nazirite is also not in the same category, as a nazirite and a priest are not flogged for plowing; rather, they are flogged for contracting impurity imparted by a corpse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last three questions you ask are similar. There too there is no connection between the action of plowing and the aveirah being done.</p>\n<p>As to the first question, theoretically you could kill someone with a plow. But if he did, the rule of קם ליה בדרבה מיניה would apply. Since the action made the perpetrator liable for the death penalty, he would no longer receive makkos. This would defeat the Mishna's purpose, which is to say the maximum number of times a person could become liable for makkos. This is also the reason the Mishnah says the case is plowing on Yom Tov, not Shabbos. Yom Tov is only a לאו, whereas Shabbos is a חיוב מיתה.</p>\n\n\n",

Midrash Shemuel is a later work (first cited by Rashi) which collates earlier rabbinic material (such as Bereshith Rabbah). So really the question ought be on the text as transmitted by the Midrash Shemuel. In the chapter on Midrash Shemuel in Ginze Midrash (by Zvi Meir Rabinowitz) p. 187 fn. 58 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שני בתי המקדש הראשון והשני לא נחרבו ע\"י הפלשתים אבל תולה חורבנם בחטאו\nשל אברהם שכרת ברית עם אבימלך. בב\"ר נד ד עמ' 580 חסרה המלה 'בניו' ומובא\n'כנגדו מחריבין מבניך'</p>\n<p>The First and Second Temples were not destroyed by the Philistines,\nhowever their destruction was contingent upon the sin of Abraham who\nforged a covenant with Abimelekh. In Gen. Rabbah 54 4, p. 580, the\nword \"his sons\" is absent, and brought in its stead are the words\n\"opposite him your sons will be destroyed\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would appear that in earlier iterations, such as in Bereshith Rabbah, it is not suggested that the Philistines are descended from Abimelekh. Rather that the Midrash Shemuel introduced an error in the transmission of this midrash from Bereshith Rabbah, and that the Rashbam merely preserved the text as he received it.</p>\n\n\n",

They included Haggai,\nZekharyah, Malakhi, Daniel, Hananyah, Mishael, Azaryah, Nehemyah ben\nHakliyah, Mordekhai, Zerubavel and many other sages - 120 elders in\nall. The last surviving member of this group was Simon the Just. He\nwas included among the 120 elders and received the Oral Law from all\nof them. He served as the High Priest after Ezra.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Abravanel challenged this (in the intro to Nahalath Avoth):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמנם בעניין אנשי כנסת הגדולה, יקשה גם כן שמנה הרב בכללם דניאל, חנניה,\nמישאל ועזריה. כי הנה אנשי כנסת הגדולה כולם היו בירושלים בזמן בית שני,\nוידוע שלא עלו שמה דניאל וחבריו, ואולי היו כבר מתים באותו הפרק... ולכן\nייראה שכבר היו בעולמם, וגם למאן דאמר שחנניה, מישאל ועזריה אחרי שיצאו\nמכבשן האש עלו לארץ ישראל ולמדו תורה לפני יהושע הכהן הגדול, ושעליהם\nאמרו: \"שמע נא יהושע הכהן הגדול אתה ורעיך היושבים לפניך כי אנשי מופת\nהמה\", לא היו הם מאנשי כנסת הגדולה, כל שכן דניאל שלא עלה שמה</p>\n<p>Concerning the men of the Great Assembly, it is difficult to\nunderstand how the Rambam included among their ranks, Daniel,\nHananyah, Mishael, and Azaryah. For the men of the Great Assembly were\nentirely in Jerusalem during the Second Temple era. And it is known\nthat Daniel and his cohorts did not ascend to there, they may even\nhave been deceased by that time… and if so it would appear that they\nwere already in their world [the World to Come] by that time. And\nfurther, even according to the one whol holds that after Hananyah,\nMishael, and Azaryah emerged from the furnace they ascended to the\nLand of Israel and studied Torah before Joshuah the High Priest, and\nupon whom it is said “Hear now, O Joshua the High Priest, you and your\nfellows that sit before you; for they are men that are a wondrous\nsign” [implying that] they were not of the men of the Great Assembly,\nand all the more so Daniel who did not ascend to there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly it would seem that the view that Daniel was a member of the Great Assembly is not unanimous. Perhaps in defense of those that asserted that he was a member it may be suggested that due to exigent circumstances (הוראת שעה) members outside of the Land of Israel were also permitted, or that Daniel arrived in the Land of Israel later in life (this latter suggestion would obviously not accord with the midrash identifying Daniel with Hathakh).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have no source for this, but it might be possible to reconcile all statements by simply expanding the definition of \"The Second Temple period\" to include also Shivat Tzion in the time of Cyrus.

    "content": "# New Sanhedrin - what will it do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Rambam in Hilchos Mamarim <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 and 2</a>, a Sanhedrin has enormous power. Roughly speaking, it oversees a) oral traditions, b) rabbinical enactments, and c) drashos: derivations using the י\"ג מדות. At least for the drashos, the Rambam holds that the Sanhedrin can override any previous Sanhedrin, <em>even if it was greater</em>.<br />\nAssuming that this list contains pretty much everything we call \"oral Torah\", that should mean that the Sanhedrin can settle any question that isn't governed by a הלכה למשה מסיני, or some kind of תקנה דרבנן.<br />\nAny תיקו (the tradition is to read this homiletically, that Eliyahu will come and settle unanswered questions in the gemara). Certainly any later question in the Rishonim or Achronim.\nMost decisions in the Shulchan Aruch and later are decided by ruling strictly among the Rishonim! The new Sanhedrin could instead just, pick one.<br />\nOr pick minhagim, between Ashkenazim and Sefardim and Yemenites. From now on, this is how we all do it.<br />\nThat's without their power to actually make completely new drashos and simply override what the gemara or tannaim said.<br />\nWhat do we expect them to actually do? They could turn everything upside down! Do we expect them to do that, relitigate every question and essentially make every sefer we have obsolete? Or would they nibble at the edges, leaving most everything alone, respecting tradition, even though literally almost all of it is based on the earlier authorities not having the power to do what the Sanhedrin can do?<br />\nWould that be an <em>abdication</em> of the job that the Torah gave them explicitly (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 17:8-11</a>): to settle questions in a decisive way?<br />\nIs the approach taken by the Amoraim in the Talmudim relevant? The Rambam seemed to treat them as a quasi-Sanhedrin, able to make decisions that were binding on all of Israel - unlike any Beis Din that came after. Nevertheless, the Amoraim considered themselves bound by the ruling of the Tannaim. Is that because they weren't quite a Sanhedrin, or because that is the right approach?<br />\nHave gedolim offered opinions on how this would work?</p>\n<p>Maybe a follow-up question (לולא מסתפני), <em>if</em> we think that they would turn everyone upside down: We might naively have assumed that qualification for the Sanhedrin is similar (with maybe a few additional requirements) to qualification for being a gadol today: great mastery of the Torah literature from the Gemara and onward. So the Sanhedrin would presumably be chosen from our gedolim.<br />\nBut in the new Sanhedrin, is it possible that that skill set would no longer be very useful, since all those sefarim are about to become obsolete? Or would we say that the דעת תורה that this study granted those gedolim, is exactly the characteristic that the New Sanhedrin is going to need as well?</p>\n<p>Update: The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.2.1?lang=bi&p2=Kessef_Mishneh_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.2.1.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kesef Mishnah</a> on the Rambam I brought at the beginning says that even though they do have this power to relitigate drashos, the chachmei hagemara decided never to do it (\"קימו וקיבלו\") for the Mishnah, and later generations decided never to do it for the Talmud. When do they do that, and would it apply to a new Sanhedrin? Does that decision have the status of a \"takanah\", which has higher standards for being overriden (גדול בחכמה ובמנין, see there)? The Rambam seems to say elsewhere that no one after the Talmud was accepted like a Sanhedrin, so a real new Sanhedrin might be different.</p>\n\n\n",

There are many accounts, especially from insular communities, of people changing little details in their dress just to be different from gentiles. But what if a gentile likes the jewish look? I'm not talking about tzitzit but about practices of customary dress. For example, wearing a kippah at all times, a rekel with gartel and black hat, or a kaftan yerushalmi.</p>\n<p>I've seen in this site one explanation for Jews not to sell garments with tzitzit for gentiles because the gentile could be considered a jew and could end up killing a Jew. Well, many Jews today wear tzitzit under another garment, and the examples cited before were all common among gentiles at a time (or a very similar version at least). Would a gentile be liable if he looks like a Jew?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The only way I could see it being prohibited for a gentile to dress or groom themselves like a Jew is if גניבת דעת (lit. \"theft of the mind\", i.e. the prohibition against dishonest misrepresentation or deception) falls under the Seven Laws of Noah as a species of theft.</p>\n<p>R.

The determination hinges on whether the prohibition is to be categorized as rabbinic or biblical. If it is biblical, then it falls under לא תגנובו (thou shalt not steal) and would therefore be part of the Noahide covenant gentiles are bound to uphold. If however the prohibition is rabbinic, then it is not a part of the Noahide laws and a gentile would not be bound to uphold it.</p>\n<p>This is not a robustly developed area of halakhah, and the answer as to whether a gentile may dress or groom as a Jew hinges on whether גניבת דעת is understood to be a rabbinic or biblical prohibition.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# According to 1st century Jewish interpretations of Ecclesiastes, what part of man goes to Sheol?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> this is an adaptation of the question <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/q/74049/38524\">According to Ecclesiastes, what part of man goes to Sheol?</a> which I previously asked on Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange. On that site the question turned out to be quite controversial -- each answer defends a different view. Here, I want to restrict the scope to how 1st century Jews would have answered the question.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Ecclesiastes 3:18-21 (ESV):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>18 I said in my heart with regard to the children of man that God is testing them that they may see that they themselves are but beasts. 19 For what happens to the children of man and what happens to the beasts is the same; as one dies, so dies the other. They all have the same breath, and man has no advantage over the beasts, for all is vanity. 20 <strong>All go to one place. All are from the dust, and to dust all return</strong>. 21 <strong>Who knows whether the spirit of man goes upward</strong> and the spirit of the beast goes down into the earth?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ecclesiastes 9:10 (ESV):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>10 Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might, for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom <strong>in Sheol, to which you are going</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ecclesiastes 12:5-7 (ESV):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>5 they are afraid also of what is high, and terrors are in the way; the almond tree blossoms, the grasshopper drags itself along, and desire fails, <strong>because man is going to his eternal home</strong>, and the mourners go about the streets— 6 before the silver cord is snapped, or the golden bowl is broken, or the pitcher is shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the cistern, 7 <strong>and the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the spirit returns to God who gave it</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ecclesiastes seems to advocate the bipartite nature of man (man = body + spirit) of Genesis 2:7. And when man dies, the body becomes dust and returns to the earth and the spirit returns to God who gave it (Ecclesiastes 3:20, 12:7).</p>\n<p>However, Ecclesiastes 9:10 also tell us that when man dies, he goes to Sheol. And this is when things can get a bit tricky: <strong>What part of man goes to Sheol?</strong></p>\n<p>I see four possible alternatives:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The body goes to Sheol</strong></p>\n<p>If the body goes to Sheol, then what is Sheol to begin with? Is Sheol in the physical realm? Do the molecules of our deceased bodies go there when we die? Does this even make sense?</p>\n<p><strong>2. The spirit goes to Sheol</strong></p>\n<p>If the spirit goes to Sheol, would that mean that Sheol is a spiritual place in the spiritual realm, just as Heaven is? Further, since the spirit returns to God, it would follow that the presence of God is in Sheol or God is in charge of Sheol somehow (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_state\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intermediate state</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>3. Man as a whole goes to Sheol</strong></p>\n<p>This alternative doesn't make much sense to be honest. If body and spirit part ways upon death, it wouldn't make sense to say that \"man as a whole\" goes somewhere, since \"man as a whole\" (body + spirit) no longer exists.</p>\n<p><strong>4. We go nowhere, Ecclesiastes 9:10 is just being metaphorical</strong></p>\n<p>In other words, there is no longer a \"self\" that goes anywhere. Man ceases to exist upon death and Sheol is just a metaphorical term for a state of non-being / non-existence (see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_mortalism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Christian mortalism</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Question</strong></p>\n<p>Which alternative makes more sense and is better supported by Scripture? Are there other alternatives?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Appendix - Pharisees and Sadducees (1st century)</strong></p>\n<p>I am by no means an expert on the afterlife views of 1st century Jews, but at least I understand that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pharisees</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sadducees</a> were two major sects at the time with completely different views on the afterlife.</p>\n<p>For example, the book of Acts (if you let me quote New Testament scripture) includes the account of an interesting incident involving the Apostle Paul and these two groups:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>6 Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial.” 7 And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. 8 <strong>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all</strong>. 9 Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, “We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?” 10 And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</p>\n<p>[Acts 23:6-10 ESV]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it would be interesting to know how 1st century Sadducees and Pharisees would have answered this question, although I'm completely open to other views from that time (if any).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ecclesiastes 12:7</a> describes how the body will \"return to dust\" and the soul will return to G-d.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the dust returns to the ground\nAs it was,\nAnd the lifebreath returns to God\nWho bestowed it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.7?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi, in his commentary</a> to this verse, understands this as a reference to the exile:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the dust returns, etc. They came from Bavel and they returned to Bavel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the spirit returns.

This alludes to the superiority of the soul, its foundation and secret, since it mentions in connection with it the full Divine Name. And the verse says that He breathed into his nostrils the breath of life in order to inform us that the soul did not come to man from the elements, as He intimated concerning the soul of moving things, nor was it an evolvement from the Separate Intelligences. Rather, it was the spirit of the Great G-d: out of his mouth cometh knowledge and discernment. For he who breathes into the nostrils of another person gives into him something from his own soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.12.7?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya%7CQuoting&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Rabbeinu Bahya</a>, in his commentary on Ecclesiastes 12:7 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Torah writes in Genesis 2,7 ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים, “He blew into his nostrils the soul of life,” this is evidence that seeing G’d blew into man’s nostrils, he received something directly from G’d’s spirit. The meaning of that verse is that some of the nobility of “G’d’s life” was infused into man. He imparted to man part of His own essence so that seeing this part emanated in the emanation בינה which is the source of the concept תשובה, return or repentance, we can understand what Solomon had in mind when he spoke about man’s רוח, “spirit” “returning to G’d who had provided it when his body dies” (Kohelet 12,7).

G-d explains to Moshe Rabbeinu that a wicked person who prospers, is not considered a completely wicked person. G-d rewards him for the good deeds he does in this world. This is called, as Maurice explained, a צַדִּיק גָּמוּר Tzadik Gamur.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The righteous person who suffers is one who is not a completely righteous person. Because he does have some transgressions, he is punished in this world so that he will receive a complete reward in the World-to-Come.\nThe wicked person who prospers is one who is not a completely wicked person. God rewards him in this world for the good deeds that he performed, so that he will receive a complete punishment in the World-to-Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein (Darash Moshe al HaTorah, ArtScroll, p. 26) (1) explains that in most of his activities, Noah was a <em>tamim</em>, however, in the other matters, he was a <em>tzaddik</em>.</p>\n<p>The reason why Noah was not completely a tzadik, was due to the fact that he was meant to put the abilities to good use. He was meant to guide the generation (Darash Moshe Al HaTorah, p. 27):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In his private life, Noah was unquestionably a tamim. In public affairs, however, he was required to guide and admonish his generation [...].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, \"Noah walked with G-d\" implies that Noah, being a <em>tamid</em>, would spend all day alone with G-d, not dealing with the outside world, as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ba%27alei_Brit_Avram%2C_Noach.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'alei Brit Avram</a> teaches us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the text says \"complete\" (tamim), for he was not like some of the righteous people who have erred and in the end changed course and turned over (towards righteousness). Rather, he had always been 'complete,' for he had no blemish or perversion. And, if you were to say, \"How is it possible for him to have had this [quality]?\" Then, say that the reason for this is \"Noah walked with God.\" This is to say, that he never had any dealing with a human creature, but he would spend all day alone [i.e., with God].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, the term \"Tamim\" needs a clarification. Was Noah considered a tamim of all generations? Instead, the pasuk is telling us that Noah was a tamim in his own generation, as explained by <a href=\"https://www.koltorah.org/articles/the-making-of-a-tzaddik-by-yitzchak-richmond\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Richmond from Kol Torah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This serves as a basis for the opinion that Noach was Tamim only in respect to his generation, but relative to other Tzaddikim, he was not Tamim</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea is further explained by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ba%27alei_Brit_Avram%2C_Noach.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'alei Brit Avram</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"A righteous man he was in his generations\" is that he was as such in generations when people are not seen as righteous--throughout all of this, as if in all of his generations, <strong>both in the generation of his youth and in the generation of his old age</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.100.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akeidat Yitzchak</a>, in his commentary to Bereishis 6:9 explains that the term <em>halach</em> is used when people, in their lives, are reaching towards a specific goal, coming closer to G-d in this example. When one feels that he is \"distant\", he tries everything he can in order to come closer to G-d. When he did everything in order to come closer to G-d, he is considered as if he \"walked with G-d\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We find the expression halach, he walked, used in connection with most outstanding people, since their lives represented constant progress, movement towards a goal, an objective. \"Enoch walked with the Lord.\" (Genesis 5,22) When one feels distant, one tries to come closer. Finally, when one has reached one's goal of closeness to G'd, we read \"for the Lord took him.\" (ibid) Noach was a similarly motivated person. \"Noach walked with G'd .\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The last commentary, given by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Me%27or_Einayim%2C_Noach.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Me'or Einayim on Parashas Noach</a> explains that Noach was not considered a completely righteouss man, although the Torah says so in Bereishis 6:9. But the intent of this pasuk is that Noach was \"lacking the level of Avraham\". Noach was attached to G-d, since G-d intended this, not through Noach's own efforts. Avraham was doing everything he could in order to spread G-dliness into this world. Noach was not speaking to everyone about G-d, about how wonderful G-d is. In that matter, he was not considered completely a tzaddik.</p>\n<p><strong>Reference list</strong></p>\n<p>(1) Klugman, E. M., Rohr, P. O., & Rosenberg, A. Y. (1994).

However, you shall praise Me both for fortune and for misfortune. Thus David said: I will fill up the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord (Ps. 116:13), whether for good or for evil. <strong>Then said his wife unto him: “Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? Blaspheme God, and die!”</strong> But he said unto her: “Thou speakest as one of the impious women speaketh. What? Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?” (Job. 2:9–10). A man should rejoice over his afflictions more than over his good fortune. Even if man should enjoy good fortune all his life, (this merely indicates that) the sins he committed are not being forgiven. What causes sins to be forgiven? Only suffering. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to the Tanchuma it is a human reaction to curse those that one normally fears when facing hardships and the like, and as such, this is the reason why in this context it is used differently.</p>\n\n\n",

And was something that happened in society at large. It may seem strange to us because society has moved way past this (probably in good part due to the Torah itself).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is completely unrelated to the previous</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thematically this passage comes right after a description of halisa, which in a sense is a ritualized shaming of a man by a woman by means of touching/uncovering. So its kind of just continuing the theme, and saying in this case ok/permitted, in that case prohibited.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it adds \"show no pity\" which is not used even for murder.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See Deut. 19:11-13 where it is used for a murderer:</p>\n<p>וכי-יהיה איש, שונא לריעהו, וארב לו וקם עליו, והכהו נפש ומת; ונס, אל-אחת הערים האל. ושלחו זקני עירו, ולקחו אותו משם; ונתנו אותו, ביד גואל הדם--ומת. <strong>לא-תחוס עינך, עליו</strong>; וביערת דם-הנקי מישראל, וטוב לך.</p>\n<p>Also see the Ramban ad loc. where he mentions two reasons for the use of such language here in our case (25:11):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וקצותה את כפה לא תחוס עינך (להלן כה יב), מפני כי הפתאים יהללו אותה\nבהיותה עוזרת לבעלה, או מפני שהבושת מצוי ואין בו חסרון כיס</p>\n<p>\"you shall cut off her hand; your eye shall not show pity\" and there\nthe prohibition is warranted because foolish people praise her for\naiding her husband, or because causing embarrassment is a common\noffense and does not involve financial loss to the victim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So basically the extra strong language is used to a) rebuff those that would claim that her actions were proper and justified, and therefore undeserving of punishment. Or b) rebuff those that would claim that insofar has her actions incurred no economic damages, she should not be held liable.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As for context: the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.25.11?lang=bi&with=Sforno&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> says the previous verses talk about publicly shaming a man for not marrying his brother's widow. So <em>even though</em> there are times when publicly shaming someone is called for, in the right measure ... we still have to have a sense of dignity. Thus, we would punish someone for embarrassing someone else. (I.e. -- don't let the occasional use of public shaming desensitize you from how hurtful it can be.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Would the kohen place his hands under a woman's hand when she brought bikkurim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Devarim 26 and tractate Bikkurim it describes the bikkurim ritual including the fact that the kohen would place his hands under the hands of the person bringing the bikkurim during the waving of the basket part of the ceremony. Mishna Bikkurim 1:5 indicates that women are obligated to bring bikkurim. I would like to know if when a woman brings bikkurim the kohen would place his hands under hers, thus touching her, during the ceremony.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a dispute among the Rishonim exactly how <em>tenufah</em> was performed. Some understand that the owner placed their hands under the basket and the <em>kohen</em> placed his hands beneath; others understand that the <em>kohen</em> held the underside of the basket and the owner would grip the top of the basket.</p>\n<p>Tosfos (Kiddushin 36b) discusses why the hands of the owner do not constitute a <em>hefsek</em> between the hands of the Kohen and the Bikkurim. The question assumes that the hands of the Kohen and owner are touching. Tosfos in one answer posits that they hold the Bikkurim in two different places:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"ל דלא דמי דהכא היינו טעמא דלא הוי חציצה בכה\"ג לפי\nשהוא גזירת הכתוב דבעינן כהן ובעלים אבל התם גבי שני שותפין חשיב כה\"ג\nחציצה אם אחד מהם מניח ידו תחת יד חבירו לפי שאינה גזירת הכתוב שיהיו\nשניהן מניפים עוד י\"ל דה\"נ לא מיירי שהכהן מניח את ידו תחת יד הבעלים ממש\nדבכה\"ג הוי חציצה <strong>אלא ר\"ל שאוחז הכלי למטה והבעלים אוחזין למעלה</strong> והשתא\nליכא חציצה כלל דה\"נ אשכחן גבי ביכורים שהכהן היה אוחז בשפתיו כלומר בשפת\nהכלי למעלה והבעלים למטה ה\"נ גבי מנחות איפכא שיד הבעלים תהיה למעלה ויד\nהכהן למטה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[It's noteworthy that Tosfos differentiate between the positioning of their hands during Bikkurim and other <em>tenufos</em> - whether the Kohen's hands are underneath and the owner on top, or vice versa. See also Tosfos and Tosfos Shantz (Sotah 19a) and Rashi Sukka 47b (quoted by @kouty in comments).]</p>\n<p>Whether the Kohen touched the hands of the woman during <em>tenufah</em>* depends on the above. According to the positions that the Kohen's hands were placed under the owner, this would involved touching.</p>\n<p>In light of this, the Yerushalmi (quoted by Tosfos Sotah 19a) suggests that they would choose an elderly Kohen, who is less likely to have improper thoughts while engaging with her; the Yerushalmi seems to conclude that for such a temporary touching we allow even a younger Kohen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ירושלמי: וכהן מניח את ידו תחתיה ואין הדבר כיעור מניח מפה ואינו חוצץ\nמביא כהן זקן ואפילו תימא כהן ילד שאין יצר\nהרע מצויה לשעה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>*According to the Mishna (Kiddushin 1:8), women do not perform <em>tenufah</em>. This is certainly the case by <em>shelamim</em> (See Menachos 61). However, by <em>sotah</em> she does perform <em>tenufah</em> (See Sotah 3:1). The questioner asks by <em>bikkurim</em>; according to the Or Sameach (<a href=\"https://wiki.jewishbooks.org.il/mediawiki/wiki/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%97/%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9B%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bikkurim Ch 4</a>), a woman bringing <em>bikkurim</em> will not perform <em>tenufah</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

(Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An even those sources that point out that he was learned in Torah e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.15b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 15b</a> it wasn't heartfelt as he did not truly practise it. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.119.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim/Shocher Tov 119</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סלית כל שוגים מחקיך וגו'. מהו סלית כל שוגים החוטאים בא דואג ולמד את התורה ולא עשה אותה וחלפת אותו. בא אחיתופל מעלה פנים <strong>ולמד את התורה ולא קיימה</strong> וחלפת אותו</p>\n<p>You reject all who stray from Your laws - What does it mean \"You reject\"? i.e. All sinners err. Came Doeg and studied the Torah and did not do it and You passed him. Achitofel came (with elevated face?) <strong>and learnt Torah and did not keep it</strong> and You passed him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, refer to the Midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.18.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 18:17</a> which likens Achitofel to a house full of straw. Initially the house is all plastered nicely, hiding the straw, but over time, the straw begins to emerge out of the holes. As such:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּךְ דּוֹאֵג וַאֲחִיתֹפֶל לֹא הָיוּ בָּהֶן מִצְווֹת מִתְּחִלָּה, אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנַּעֲשׂוּ בְּנֵי תוֹרָה הָיוּ כִּתְחִלָּתָן, הֱוֵי (תהלים נה, טז): כִּי רָעוֹת בִּמְגוּרָם בְּקִרְבָּם</p>\n<p>Just as Doeg and Achitofel did not have mitzvos at the beginning, so too, even though the became Torah scholars they remained as they had been at the start. (This is the meaning of), \"For where they dwell, there evil is\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.49.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Tehillim/ Shocher Tov 49:2</a> encapsulates it best:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יחד עשיר ואביון. עשיר בתורה ואביון בתורה כולן יורדין לגיהנם. עשיר בתורה זה דואג ואחיתופל. לפי שלא שמרו את התורה ירדו לגיהנם אף על פי שהן ראשי סנהדראות. ואביון בתורה כל מי שיש סיפק בידו ללמוד ולא למד</p>\n<p>\"Rich and poor alike\" - rich in Torah and poor in Torah they all descend to hell. \"Rich in Torah\" - this is Doeg and Achitofel since they did not keep the Torah they descended to hell even though they were heads of the Sanhedrin. And \"poor in Torah\" refers to all who have the capacity to learn and don't learn.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>As far as your point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I don't understand here is that he did not agree of David's reign because of the \"sin\" with Batsheva (I believe his grand-daughter if I'm not mistaken) so how did he justify telling Absalom to sleep with all of David's wives when clearly this is a HUGE violation of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.151.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni Shmuel 151</a> notes that he fundamentally erred in his readings of the mazalos (constellation) thinking that he would rightfully become king and that is why he advised Avshalom to act as he did.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בוא אל פלגשי איבך אחיתופל הטעה אותו המזל והיה סבור שהוא מלך והי נותן עיניו באבשלום אמר לו בוא אל פלגשי אביך, א\"ל וכן אתה אומר לי שאענה פלגשי אבי, א\"ל אחיתופל גזירת האלהים היא שאמר לאביך הנני מקים עליך רעה מביתך וגו' ושכב (את) [עם] נשיך, ואחיתופל יעץ לאבשלום שיהרוג לאביו והוא ישב עליו בדין על שעינה נשי אביו ואני הורגו ומולך אני, ולא היה יודע שהמלכות עומדת מבת בנו שנאמר הלא את בת שבע את אליעם, ואליעם בן אחיתופל הגילוני</p>\n<p>Consort with the concubines of your father - Achitofel erred with (his reading of) the constellations into thinking he would be king. Therefore, he fixed his eyes on Avshalom. He (Achitofel) said to him (Avshalom), \"Consort with the concubines of your father\". He responded, \"Is this what you say to me - to ravish the concubines of your father?!\" Answered Achitofel, \"It is a decree of G-d\" - he said to your father \"I will make a calamity rise against you from within your own house\" and he lay with your wife. (Furthermore) Achitofel advised Avshalom to kill his father and he would (eventually) sit in judgement (with regards to Avshalom) for ravishing his father's wives, then he would kill Avshalom and become king. But he did not realise that the kingship would only come through his son's daughter Batsheva, daughter of Eilam, son of Achitofel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see from the Midrash that Achitofel was making a very calculated move in his bid for power, making Avshalom act as he did, so that he could thereby make him guilty and thus remove another contender for the throne.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Achitofel was definitely not righteous. Indeed, he is one of only four commoners who have no share in the World to Come:`</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁלֹשָׁה מְלָכִים וְאַרְבָּעָה הֶדְיוֹטוֹת אֵין לָהֶם חֵלֶק לָעוֹלָם הַבָּא... אַרְבָּעָה הֶדְיוֹטוֹת, בִּלְעָם, וְדוֹאֵג, וַאֲחִיתֹפֶל, וְגֵחֲזִי:<br />\nThree prominent kings mentioned in the Bible and four prominent commoners [who are described in the Bible as men of great wisdom] have no share in the World-to-Come... The four commoners are: Balaam, son of Beor; Doeg the Edomite; Ahithophel; and Gehazi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In order to get to the next part, I must preface that there is a dispute between Rashi and Ramban if concubines were actually legally married or not. Rashi says yes; Ramban says no. Many authorities say that this episode supports the Ramban: if the Jews rallied to Absalom after this, it cannot be that he committed adultery. Others say that it is entirely possible for the Jews to support him despite adultery, and say that they overlooked worse in history. (See Nachalas Shimon Ch. 31)</p>\n<p>As to his suicide, the best resource is the book Nachalas Shimon. In Ch. 47 #18 a range of opinions are brought. Most say one of the reasons he has no share in the\nWorld to Come is for committing suicide.</p>\n<p>As to why he did it, it seems that he knew the rebellion would fail, and would then be condemned to death.</p>\n<p>`</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Questions on a story about Hillel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is always possible to pick on even the most inspirational stories, but hopefully in doing so we end up learning something.  The Talmud relates this story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hillel the Elder worked every day to earn half a dinar, half of which he would give [as tuition] at the study hall… One time he did not find employment… and the guard did not let him enter. He went up to the roof, and sat at the edge of the skylight to hear the words of the living God from the mouths of [Rabbis] Shemaya and Avtalyon.  It was Shabbat eve … Snow fell upon him from the sky… Shemaya and Avtalyon [noticed that less light was entering the study hall], went up, and found him covered with snow three cubits high. They freed him, washed him and smeared oil on him, and sat him opposite the bonfire to warm him. They said: This man is worthy for us to desecrate Shabbat for him. [Yoma 35b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(1) Was Hillel stealing, by listening to lectures without paying?  Why did he not simply ask for permission as a charity case, or ask for a loan?</p>\n<p>(2) The rescuers said: \"This man is worthy for us to desecrate Shabbat for him.\"  Does that mean that for someone deemed less worthy we should not try to save him on Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The second question is posed by the Ein Yakov, who writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דאף שהיה ערב שבת, ועל פי רוב מתגבר הקרירות בערב שבת, ונתנו העולם סימן\n'וקרקר כל בני שת'\nוגם תקופת טבת דרכו להיות גובר הקרירות, ואפילו הכי סיכן עצמו בשביל אהבת\nהתורה, וסמך עצמו אמה דכתיב (קהלת ח, ה) 'שומר מצוה לא ידע דבר רע'.\nוהשתא מדוקדק שאמרו: 'ראוי זה לחלל עליו את השבת', דלכאורה קשה, מאי שנא\nזה מאדם אחר, דהא אפילו משום תינוק בן יומו מחללין עליו את השבת, ומה\nרבותא דידיה דקאמר 'ראוי', אלא ודאי אפשר דבאחר הוי כמאבד עצמו לדעת, שלא\nהיה לו להביא עצמו לידי סכנה כזו שיצטרך לחלל עליו את השבת, רק בזה, שעשה\nהכל לכבוד התורה, ראוי לחלל עליו את השבת אף בכי האי גוונא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Brief summary: In general, we do not desecrate Shabbos to save the life of someone who attempts suicide*. Ein Yackov assumes that one who climbs on a roof on Erev Shabbos in Teves as paramount to suicide, and would therefore not be eligibile for saving. However, since he was doing it for the sake of Torah, he invoked 'שומר מצוה לא ידע דבר רע' and it was permitted to save his life.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*This is not necessarily the accepted Halachah. For further sources about desecrating Shabbos to avert an attempted suicide, see Chochmas Shlomo (R Shlomo Kluger) to OC 329, and Shu\"t Shevus Yackov #16. See also Minchas Chinuch 237:2 and Or Gadol #1). Practically, see Tzitz Eliezer ח\"ח סי' טו קונ' משיבת נפש פ\"ד who rules that one may desecrate Shabbos to save lives even in cases of suicide.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your first question is an interesting question which I haven't seen asked yet. As to the question why he didn't take a loan - perhaps he knew that it was highly unlikely that he would be able to pay back. Nor did he want to take charity as שונא מתנות יחיה. Perhaps the entrance fee was not charged for the right to learn there but to pay towards the heating- and upkeep costs of the learning hall. In that case, listening from the roof would not constitute theft.\nIf you want to get more inspiration from this story, consider the following point made by the late Rav Zalman Rotbarg, the Rosh Yeshiva of Beis Meir in Bne Berak, and nephew (by marriage) of the Chazon Ish. He points to a רבינו יונה in שערי תשובה שער ב סימן כו (here <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52052&st=&pgnum=125\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52052&st=&pgnum=125</a> ) who explains the saying of הלל in אבות that אם אין אני לי מי לי to mean that it is never enough to listen to a lecture and think that you understand it. It requires a lot of thinking and drawing conclusions before it can become part of the person (עיין שם). Now הלל himself, must have been a tremendous listener if he managed to concentrate listening from the roof through a crack in the window (which in winter surely wasn't wide open) not even noticing that it was snowing! Nevertheless he told us that without constant contemplating, revision and stock-taking, anything you hear will not become internalized!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Sefaria, as a resource, conform to Orthodox standards?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sefaria.org has emerged as a very convenient and popular place to find hundreds of important Torah texts in Hebrew and English.</p>\n<p>Many people rely upon the site for study and for the generation of educational materials. Do the texts and translations that Sefaria presents conform to Orthodox pedagogical standards?</p>\n<p>Sefaria often relies on the New Jewish Publication Society of America Tanakh (hereon JPS) for its translations. This translation emerged from the collaborative efforts of an interdenominational team of Jewish scholars and rabbis. At times the translation departs from the literal translation and analyzes the Torah like a work of literature. In so doing, it often gives the reader a very different understanding of the verse.</p>\n<p>Here's an example:</p>\n<p>Genesis 7:1 – The JPS translation that Sefaria presents has “go to the Ark” - however, בא means “come”.</p>\n<p>Another example:</p>\n<p>Genesis 37:8 - על חלמתיו ועל דבריו is rendered as one idea - “for his talk about his dreams” - but traditional commentaries present 2 reasons. That they hate him more for (a) his dreams, and (b) for talking about them. This subtlety is vital to understanding their motive for selling him and for understanding his development over the next couple of Torah portions as a person. Most other translations do this better.</p>\n<p>Any translation is an interpretation. But some translations take more literary license, contrary to the Orthodox approach wherein every word of the Torah has the potential to be instructive. That the slightest details of the biblical text have a meaning that ought not be glossed over for the purpose of literary flow.</p>\n<p>Moreover the classic commentaries only make sense if you know what the text literally (rather than literarily) says. Accordingly, pairing the JPS translation, which is more literary in tact, with Rashi or other traditional commentators adds confusion. Particularly given that the translation of the biblical text they use for the Rashi is different and often doesn't match the JPS translation at all.</p>\n<p>As a second but related question, given that the site's creators are non-Orthodox, do Orthodox rabbis permit Orthodox students and educators to utilize the site?</p>\n<p>Are there any Orthodox sources that discuss these issues? Are there any rabbis that have issued rulings against the use of Sefaria?</p>\n\n\n",

As earlier commentaries explain, the Talmud’s statement that one should let himself be killed rather than kill another, “for why do you think that your blood is redder?” is essentially saying that we cannot fathom the infinite value of a life. Thus, we must refrain from taking action that implies we know how to evaluate one life over another or even many. All we can do is leave it to heaven and follow the Talmudic dictum shev ve’al ta’aseh (“sit and do nothing”), taking a passive tack, for any active killing is forbidden</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there seems to be an exception to this principle. This can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.20.21?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer 2 Shmuel, perek 20:21</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just hand him alone over to us, and I will withdraw from the city.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this is further discussed in the work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Contemporary_Halakhic_Problems%2C_Vol_VI%2C_Chapter_2_Sacrificing_the_Few_to_Save_the_Many.10?ven=Contemporary_halakhic_problems,_by_J._David_Bleich,_1977-2005&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Contemporary Halakhic Problems, Vol VI, Chapter 2 Sacrificing the Few to Save the Many 10\"</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Resh Lakish infers that acquiescence with a demand of such nature can be sanctioned only in instances in which the victim's life is lawfully forfeit, as was the case with regard to Sheba the son of Bichri who is described as being guilty of lèse majesté. However, in instances in which the designated victim is guiltless, all must suffer death rather than become accomplices to murder. R. Yoḥanan maintains that the question of guilt is irrelevant; rather, the crucial factor is the singling out of a specific individual by the oppressor. Members of a group have no right to select one of their number and deliver him to death in order to save their own lives. Since the life of each individual is of inestimable value there is no basis for preferring one life over another. However, once a specific person has been marked for death in any event, either alone if surrendered by his companions or together with the entire group if they refuse to comply, those who deliver him are not to be regarded as accessories. Rambam's ruling is in accordance with the opinion of Resh Lakish. Both opinions are cited by Rema, Shulḥan Arukh, Yoreh De'ah 157:1.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi J. David Bleich explains here that it is not allowed to, if you are a member of a group, to select one of you groupmembers and deliver him to death, in order to save your own life, or the lives of the other people in your group:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Members of a group have no right to select one of their number and deliver him to death in order to save their own lives.

He shall be brought <strong>to the door or the doorpost</strong>, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall then remain his slave for life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The literal reading of the text would imply that one has the option of boring the hole <em>either</em> on the door <em>or</em> on the doorpost, yet Chazal (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.22b.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 22b</a>) clarify that the doorpost is in fact an invalid place to bore the hole, as the Torah itself states (Re'eh, Devarim, 17;15)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְלָקַחְתָּ֣ אֶת־הַמַּרְצֵ֗עַ וְ<strong>נָתַתָּ֤ה בְאׇזְנוֹ֙ וּבַדֶּ֔לֶת</strong> וְהָיָ֥ה לְךָ֖ עֶ֣בֶד עוֹלָ֑ם וְאַ֥ף לַאֲמָתְךָ֖ תַּעֲשֶׂה־כֵּֽן׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>you shall take an awl and <strong>put it through his ear into the door</strong>, and he shall become your slave in perpetuity. Do the same with your female slave.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We must specifically bore the hole on the door alone, the reason that the Torah mentions the doorpost in the verse prior is to teach us that the characteristics of the door must be similar to that of the doorpost, just as the doorpost is perpendicular so too the door must be perpendicular and on its hinges when performing the piercing.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Aderet_Eliyahu%2C_Exodus.21.6.2?lang=bi&p2=Exodus.21&lang2=bi&aliyot2=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aderes Elyahu</a>, the Vilna Gaon comments on that verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פשטא דקרא גם המזוזה כשרה אבל הלכה עוקרת את המקרא וכן ברובה של פרשה זו וכן בכמה פרשיות שבתורה והן מגדולת תורתינו שבע\"פ שהיא הל\"מ והיא מתהפכת כחומר חותם <strong>חוץ המצות שבאו במנצפ\"ך\nשהם מישרים</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The simple reading of the verse implies that one can bore a hole in the ear of the Jewish slave on the doorpost, yet the oral law uproots the textual reading of the verse, This is true for most of this parshah as well as many other parshiyos in the Torah. This is due to the greatness of the Oral Torah which was transmitted by Moshe from Sinai, as it reverses like the mold of a stamp, <strong>except for the commandments that come from Mantzepach which are straight</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gaon is teaching us that the oral Torah and the written Torah are one and the same, the only difference is perspective. The wonderful analogy he uses to describe this phenomenon is the mold of a stamp in respect to its imprint on paper. The mold of the stamp has the lettering backward and is only spelled properly when stamped on paper, so too the written Torah is to us like the mold of the stamp whereas the oral Torah is its imprint. A tremendous parable that enlightens the mind to the relationship of the oral Torah and the written Torah.</p>\n<p>There Vilna Gaon writes that there is an exception, however, as the mitzvos from Mantzepach are straightforward. We know that Mantzepach is an anachronym for the end letters in the Hebrew alphabet as seen from the Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.2b.23?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah, 2b-3a</a>). But what exactly are the mitzvos that are learned from Mantzepach?

It once happened on a stormy day that the Sages did not attend the House of Assembly [i.e. the Academy]. Some children were there and they said, 'Come and let us make a House of Assembly. Why are there written [two different forms when the following letters come in the middle or end of a word respectively] mem [מ] mem [ם], nun [נ] nun [ן], tzadi [צ], tzadi [ץ], pai [פ] pai [ף]? It teaches [that the Torah was transmitted] from utterance [מאמר] to utterance, from Faithful [נאמן] to faithful, from Righteous [צדיק] to righteous, from mouth [פה] to mouth, and from hand [כף] to hand. From utterance to utterance — from the utterance of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the utterance of Moses. From Faithful to faithful— from theAlmighty, who is designated, \"God, faithful King,\" to Moses, who is designated faithful, as it is written, \"He [Moses] is faithful in all My house\" (Numbers 12:7). From Righteous to righteous— from God, who is designated righteous, as it is written, \"The Lord is righteous in all His ways\" (Psalms 145:17), to Moses who is designated righteous, as it is written, \"He executed the righteousness of the Lord\" (Deuteronomy 33:21). From mouth to mouth — from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the mouth of Moses. From hand to hand: from the hand of the Holy One, blessed be He, to the hand of Moses. They completed them and they grew to be great sages in Israel; some say that they were R. Eliezer, R. Joshua and R. Akiba.

Using  e-readers to  display  new screen  views which  are transient in  that they automatically shut off  after  a  few  minutes  of  inactivity would  not be  biblically  prohibited but  would be  banned rabbinically  as  toldat  koteiv  d’rabbanan.

If we know the color of the תרומה that falls in it does not become בטל as he can just eat from the other color of תרומה.

It is not dependent on our knowledge. As long as it is <strong>mixed in</strong> that is enough. My understanding of Rabbi Eliezer who says that even we don't know if what fell in was white or black it does not become בטל perhaps he understands that if the color is separate and what fell in belonged to one group that is not considered a mixture at all. Rabbi Akiva is troubling to me: Why does it matter if he knows which color fell in or not. Whether something becomes בטל should be dependent or our own knowledge? Either it became mixed up or it did not become mixed up? Any thoughts of any more understanding of this Mishnah or certainly welcome.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think the point according to R' Akiva is if you can separate the mixture, it's not mixed.</p>\n<p>Let's say there were 100 black chulin and no white, and one white terumah falls in.

For this reason those were unclean who were engaged in the sacrifice of the heifer or the goats which were burnt, and even their garments were unclean.

As it is stated: “There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets of stone which Moses put there” (I Kings 8:9). What does “there was nothing in the Ark except” mean? This is an example of a restriction following a restriction, as both terms, “nothing” and “except,” indicate that the Ark was empty. And there is a hermeneutical principle that a restriction following a restriction serves only to amplify and include other matters. In this case, it serves to include a Torah scroll that lies in the Ark. The baraita continues: With this explanation you have accounted for the entire length of the Ark; go now and account for the width of the Ark, which was nine handbreadths. How much space did the tablets occupy of the width of the Ark, which was nine handbreadths wide? Six handbreadths; therefore, three handbreadths were left there along the width of the Ark. Deduct a handbreadth from them: One-half a handbreadth for the thickness of this wall and one-half a handbreadth for the thickness of the other wall. Accordingly, two handbreadths were left there. What was their purpose? These were necessary so that the Torah scroll would be able to go in and out without being pressed; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so wrote the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Malbim_on_II_Kings.22.8.1?vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim on Melachim 2:22:8</a>.</p>\n<p>There's also a midrash that Moshe wrote 12 more scrolls before he died and gave each one to each of the tribes, but I am unable to find the midrash right now.</p>\n\n\n",

Not to say that it's ideal to interpret the torah literally, but what you get is a watered-down, one-sided view of the torah and rashi's interpretation according to the   view of the translator which i consider to be a downside. The gutnick chumash has a box with explanations of different passages, terms, or ideas presented in the torah according to various commentators which i think is kind of cool. Both have a running commentary based on the writings of the lubavitcher rebbe. As mentioned in the other answer they're both pretty similar, but kehot is the official publishing house of chabad. If i had to pick one I'd probably pick the gutnick but i would honestly find a different chumash if you wanted a more accurate or less biased translation. Of course all translations are biased but in this case it's very obvious and so fundamental to the translation it's hard to work around.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, the miracle of Purim is celebrated in both months but not the fast. Keep in mind that the actual fast occurred in Nisan not Adar so there is no significance in fasting in both months whereas Purim was in Adar so it is attached to both Adar 1 and Adar 2</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Perhaps every leap year is considered like a \"Safek\" (ספק) of which Adar is the primary Adar. Therefore we will be lenient when it comes to fasting to only fast on that month that we consider in halacha the primary one. This idea can be on a Yerushalmi on why we don't fast 2 days Yom Kippur because of a ספיקא דיומא (see Rem\"a hilchos Yom Kippur siman 624).</p>\n\n\n",

The proper interpretation appears to me to be that man’s original\nnature was such that he did whatever was proper for him to do\nnaturally, just as the heavens and all their hosts do, “faithful\nworkers337 whose work is truth, and who do not change from their\nprescribed course,”338 and in whose deeds there is no love or hatred.\nNow it was the fruit of this tree that gave rise to will and desire,\nthat those who ate it should choose a thing or its opposite, for good\nor for evil. This is why it was called ‘etz hada’ath’ (the tree of the\nknowledge) of good and evil, for da’ath in our language is used to\nexpress will. ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A footnote on that Ramban (appearing in the ArtScroll Ramban al Hatorah) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At first glance, Ramban seems to be asserting tht man had no free\nchoice (the capability to decide between doing what is right and doing\nwhat is wrong) before eating the forbidden fruit. [...] Rav Yerucham\nLevovitz (Daas Chochmah U'Mussar Vol.3 28) explains that Ramban's\nintention is something else entirely: Adam, before the sin, was\ncapable of deciding whether to embrace evil or good; however, he was\ninherently disinclined to choose evil. (He cites this example as an\nillustration: A person is capable of going naked in the street, but he\nis <em>mentally</em> inhibited from doing so).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps what Ramban is saying is that before eating from the tree Adam was still capable of choosing to do the right or the wrong thing (possibly on a rational, intellectual level), but eating from the eitz hadaas added to that capability of choice the passion and desire (will) to act a certain way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>TL;DR: They did have the choice between truth and falsehood. And if you get that wrong, you can end up choosing evil thinking you're choosing good.</p>\n<p>The concept of choice between right and wrong seems to be fundamental to a person’s role in serving his Creator, so it is hard to explain what would have. The Rambam (Hilchos Teshuvah 5:1-4) writes that a person has free will only so that there is value to a good deed. Hashem only values our service because it comes from us, and not from the force of some law of nature. The ability to choose is fundamental to our purpose. But without knowledge of good or evil, how could Adam make a choice?</p>\n<p>In Moreh Nevuchim, the Rambam writes that a person always had free will; this is the meaning of being created “in the image of G-d”. However, before eating the fruit, the challenge in Adam’s existence was to choose between truth and falsehood. The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil reduced him to working within the paradigm of good vs. evil.</p>\n<p>R. Eliyahu Dessler writes (Michtav MeiEliyahu vol. 1, pg. 113 i.e.  Kunterus HaBechirah sec. I, ch. 2) that the difference between before and after humanity’s sin was the internalization of the Evil Inclination. Before eating from the tree, Chavah had to be convinced by a snake to disobey G-d, and Adam in turn had to be convinced by Chavah; neither would have sinned on their own. The snake, identified with the Satan, was instead of their evil inclination.</p>\n<p>These two ideas merge quite beautifully. (Ibid. vol 2 pp. 139-140) Before eating the fruit, a person had no Evil Inclination. He had no motivation to sin. It was only the intervention of an outside force that lead him to sin. It was, therefore, the task of this outsider to convince the person that what is in reality evil, is good. Then, the person’s job would be to ascertain the truth. Before the Fall, he only had a desire to do good, but that does not mean he always knew what good was. This is the Rambam’s model of truth vs.  falsehood.</p>\n<p>The snake did not simply mislead Chavah the same way one who causes the masses today would.  Today the misleader has help, everyone has some internal inclination to do what is wrong. At that time, Chavah did not yet have one.  For this reason, the Torah did not just use the word “<em>hitah</em>” -- “made me err”, or “<em>hechta</em>” -- “made me sin”.

With this idea by the sin of the golden calf, why didn't Moshe accurately take the blame for the sin and say to Hashem: \"It's because of my delay in coming to them that they made the golden calf\"..? This seems to be the greatest response Moshe could have said and he didn't. Why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I bumped into Reb Ginzburg today.

Therefore, Moses who \"was more humble than any man on earth\" (Bemidbar 12:3), would never lie in order to seem what he was not.</p>\n<p>Moses, who was as outraged at the infidelity of Israel as God Himself, <em>could not 'admit' what was not true</em>, namely, that he was himself at fault somehow, since Aaron his brother was the leader of the people while Moses was gone: Moses could not at once attend the people and God. If not so much as a goat was allowed to set foot on the mountain, how is Moses who dictate to those at the bottom? He cannot.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Shmot 32:15</strong> And Moses returned from the mount, carrying the two tables of the testimony in his hand, written on both sides, and made by the work of God: the writing also of God was graven in the tables. And Joshua hearing the noise of the people shouting, said to Moses: The noise of battle is heard in the camp. But he answered: It is not the cry of men encouraging to fight, nor the shout of men compelling to flee: but I hear the voice of singers. And when he came nigh to the camp, he saw the calf, and the dances: and <strong>being very angry,</strong> he <strong>threw the tables out of his hand,</strong> and <strong>broke them</strong> at the foot of the mount: and <strong>laying hold of the calf</strong> which they had made, he <strong>burnt it, and beat it to powder,</strong> which he strowed into water, and <strong>gave thereof to the children of Israel to drink.</strong> And he said to Aaron: <strong>What has this people done</strong> to thee, that <strong>thou</strong> shouldst bring upon them a most heinous sin? And he answered him: Let not my lord be offended: for thou knowest this people, that they are prone to evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can read, Moses and Aaron were both against the idolatry; Aaron was weak and gave into what he ought not to have as a Mosaic leader, and Moses' successor, but Moses was fully against and in no way responsible for what they who were at the bottom of the mount did while he waited at the top for God to write the law on the tablets of stone, and blamed Aaron for his inexcusable indolence or cowardice in the face of apostasy from the only true and living God.</p>\n\n\n",

As long as they get to bear children with their wives, who cares if their wife <em>prostitutes herself</em> to other men who are not her husband? What is the point of the covenant of marriage?</p>\n<p>This is the question you are asking, because God describes His relationship with His people Israel as a relationship between <em>Husband and Wife</em>, <em>Bride and Groom</em>, not between employer and employee merely.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ezekiel 16:8, 26, 32</strong> And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold <strong>thy time was the time of lovers:</strong> and <strong>I spread my garment over thee,</strong> and covered <strong>thy ignominy.</strong> And I <strong>swore</strong> to thee, and I <strong>entered into a covenant</strong> with thee, saith the Lord God: and <strong>thou becamest mine.</strong>  ... And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours ... And as an <strong>adulteress</strong>, that bringeth in strangers <strong>over her husband.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A husband will give his life for his wife, and vice versa. The husband cares for the wellbeing of his wife, and is not merely interested in the satisfaction or wellbeing she brings him. Thus is so with God also. God cares for the wellbeing of souls, and therefore, to worship falsehood, and not truth (that is, to worship idols) can only bear bad fruit, or defective fruit, never good fruit; or, if such accidentally bears some good fruit, it is by way of theft of the author of all good, who is the author of all that is true and good.</p>\n<p>Are we to believe that the commandments reflect <em>arbitrary dictates</em> of God which are divorced (no pun intended) from His love for His people?

This is why He hates idolatry. What father or husband sets a herdle in front of his child or wife on purpose, with a view only to hinder them in fulfilling their fullest potential and happiness?

For example, the word <em>v'tsivanu</em> (from many blessings) is accented <em>v'tsiVAnu</em>, and that's indicated by וְצִוָּֽנוּ. When the meteg isn't present, the accent is on the last syllable. Such is the case for siddurim from Artscroll and Koren, the Authorised Daily Prayer Book (from England), the Sim Shalom siddur (at least the edition I see in images online), and Mishkan T'filah. Surely many others follow suit.</p>\n<p>Another system is used by the siddur Rinat Yisrael: when they want to emphasise the accent, they place a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahpach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mahpach</a> over an accented syllable when it's not the last syllable, and a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarka_(trope)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zarqa</a> over the final syllable when the accent is on the last syllable. Their introduction implies that unmarked might have accent anywhere, and you just have to know.</p>\n<p>For the chumash, the cantillation marks will almost always tell you the syllable to accent. The exceptions are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telisha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">telisha gedola</a> (which is always written before the word), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telisha\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">telisha ketana</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pashta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pashta</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarka_(trope)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zarqa</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segol_(trope)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">segol</a> (which are always written after the word). In most modern chumashim (for example, the Artscroll one you have), these signs are repeated over the syllable they want you to accent (although note that these are editorial decisions — the earliest texts we have don't double these signs, so there are a few cases of disagreements as to the accented syllable). Additionally, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yetiv\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">y'tiv</a> appears only before the word, but since it only appears on a word that is accented on its first syllable, you can essentially ignore this exception. There are more subtleties, like secondary accents, but these rules will hold you in good stead all of Tanakh except for Job, Psalms, and Proverbs, which (mostly) have their own system of cantillation. See more on this <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/66386\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/97778\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Every Koren Siddur, Humash, and Tankah that I am aware of indicates the kamatz katan vs kamatz gadol and the Sheva Nach vs the Sheva Nah. They also contain introductions that discuss pronunciation markers in their texts. As far as stress goes, every Tanakh has Ta'amei HaMikrah, which indicate the part of the word to be stressed. The parts of the Siddur that come from Tanakh have the Ta'amei HaMikra. The parts of the Siddur that are not from Tanakh don't contain stress markers. However, you can simply learn the rules of stress from any Hebrew grammar book and apply them to those sections. The rules are not difficult to learn and apply.</p>\n\n\n",

You shall not have the gods of others in My presence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There are various other instances where \"your God\" is said in reference to the Jewish nation.</p>\n<p><strong>Are there any sources that show Hashem being called the God of any other nation or people?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1132.htm#27\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jeremiah 32:27</a></strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh; is there any thing too hard for Me?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Yes, there is such a passage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Hosea 2:23</strong> ...I will have compassion on her on whom <strong>compassion was not had,</strong> and I will say to a people that was <strong>not my people:</strong> Thou <strong>art my people,</strong> and they: <strong>Thou art my God.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Israel cannot be \"her on whom compassion was not had,\" since God called Abraham from idolatry to be sons of the living God and showered them with mercy above any nation; and from the rest of Scripture we know who \"My People\" refers to, namely, \"Israel:\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>2 Samuel 7:10</strong> And I will appoint a place for <strong>my people Israel,</strong> and will plant them, and they shall dwell therein, and shall not be disturbed any more, neither shall the children of iniquity afflict them any more, as they did before.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that God explicitly says that another people shall Israel shall be called His people, and that, therefore, they will say of Him, \"Thou art my God.\"</p>\n<p>But this isn't so shocking or sandalous, since converts to Judaism from other nations were existent, very much so, and therefore considered as much a part of Israel as anyone else: there was a very real conception of non-Jews by birth being capable of becoming Jews by circumcision, that is, of converts to the Jewish faith.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Judith 14:6</strong> Then Achior seeing the power that the God of Israel had wrought, leaving the religion of the gentiles, he believed God, <strong>and circumcised the flesh of his foreskin,</strong> and <strong>was joined to the people of Israel,</strong> with all the succession of his kindred until this present day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And of course there was the belief among the Maccabees that uncircumcised state of even uncircumcised <em>Jewish</em> children was 'heathenish,' and needed corrected as part of the crusade for restoring the tradition and orthodoxy to the Hellenized Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>1 Maccabees 2:46</strong> And they <strong>circumcised all the children whom they found in the confines of Israel that were uncircumcised:</strong> and they did valiantly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moreover, God selected the Israelite people to be a light to the Gentiles, that is, the leaders and showers of the way, not the sole beneficiaries of the way:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Isaiah 49:6</strong> And he said: It is a small thing that thou shouldst be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to convert the dregs of Israel. Behold, I have given thee to be <strong>the light of the Gentiles,</strong> that thou mayst <strong>be my salvation even to the farthest part of the earth.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God chose Israel, but His sights were to all mankind, with Israel at the helm, showing the way, exemplifying the grace God grants to sinners, and showing the excellence of keeping His law, and the fruits thereof. The salvation and mercy He had on Israel was intended for all men, but He needed to form a people who were fully His first, in order to show that this is possible, admirable, and that in the very act of choosing a people among infinitudes of people, that it was all by the mercy of God: since He didn't choose Israel for its greatness: this is how the mercifulness of God is shown in choosing a special people to be a light to the Gentiles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The haftarah for P' Ki Tisa (excerpted from I Kings 18) concludes (Nusach Ashkenaz) with the the verse</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּרְא֙ כָּל־הָעָ֔ם וַֽיִּפְּל֖וּ עַל־פְּנֵיהֶ֑ם וַיֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ ה֙ ה֣וּא הָאֱלֹהִ֔ים ה֖ ה֥וּא הָאֱלֹהִֽים׃</p>\n<p>And the people saw and fell on their faces and said: Hashem, He is G-d, Hashem, He is G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They don't say ה׳ הוא ﭏקינו (Hashem, he is our G-d) and they only come to the realisation after turning aside to follow false deities (Baal being the one in question in this episode).</p>\n<p>Throughout the prophets, we find references to G-d's universality, perhaps most famously in Zechariah (14:9)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָיָ֧ה ה֛ לְמֶ֖לֶךְ עַל־כׇּל־הָאָ֑רֶץ בַּיּ֣וֹם הַה֗וּא יִהְיֶ֧ה ה֛ אֶחָ֖ד וּשְׁמ֥וֹ אֶחָֽד׃</p>\n<p>And Hashem shall be King over all the earth; In that day Hashem shall be One, and His name one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Closing an oven door on shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>On Shabbos, if an oven contains a pot of fully cooked food, may one open and close the oven door?\nTwo potential issues that I can think of it - 1) similar to the question of opening and closing a refrigerator door, but possibly worse because it is actual aish/havara. 2) potential bishul problems</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Star-K website has a feature on ovens <a href=\"https://www.star-k.org/articles/kashrus-kurrents/476/oven-kashrus-for-shabbos-use/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As previously noted, aside from the prohibition of cooking on Shabbos, there is a prohibition against initiating a fire or causing increased burning. In the case of thermostatically controlled ovens and warming drawers, opening the oven or warming drawer will cause a mechanism to call for increased burning in order to compensate for the heat lost by opening the door or drawer. The resulting effect is a grama of havara, which is not permissible on Shabbos. However, as discussed earlier, where one does not want or intend for an action to take place and has no need for its result, the initial action is prohibited by rabbinic law only. When coupled with the fact that the ensuing melacha is a reaction that was brought about indirectly, initiated through a grama, there is room for leniency and the initial action is permitted. Therefore, food left in the oven or warming drawer from before Shabbos may be removed on Shabbos despite the fact that this action will eventually cause the oven to burn. This is because removing the food results in additional burning that is not wanted or intended. However, this can be said only when all of the food is removed at one time. If some food remains in the oven to be heated, the additional burning caused by opening the door is viewed as intentional and is, therefore, prohibited. Most warming drawers and ovens are thermostatically controlled and would fall into the above category.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also refer to the Fedtech website of the Federation Beis Din of London <a href=\"https://www.federation.org.uk/using-an-oven-without-sabbath-mode/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p>It provides a clear and concise table that illustrates three ways to use an oven on Shabbos if the oven doesn not have an approved 'Sabbath mode'.</p>\n<p>(Note: the two columns coloured green are the halachically preferred approach for use of the oven.

These points must be researched before using any oven on Shabbos or Yom Tov.</li>\n<li>If the oven is working in thermostatic mode and the door opening does not directly affect its operation, the oven may be used for Yom Tov cooking.\nThe oven should be set to the desired temperature on Sabbath mode before Yom Tov.</li>\n<li>No adjustments may be made to the temperature setting over the course of Yom Tov.</li>\n<li>Food may be placed in the oven to cook or heat on Yom Tov and need not be in place from before Yom Tov.</li>\n<li>The door may be opened and closed as is required over the course of cooking.

    "content": "# Death on the battlefield\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Last Shabbat, I was reading a book called היהודים בערב (The Jews in Arabia) by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%9F-%D7%96%D7%90%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Yisrael Ben Ze'ev</a>. In the book, a section was dedicated to a pre-Islamic Arabian Jewish poet named <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samaw%27al_ibn_%27Adiya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel ben Adiyah</a>. A passage from one of his songs reads (pg. 42):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...אנו בני-עם לא ראינו בושת במלחמה. תעבנו למות מיתה לא על שדה קטל. נשפך דמנו על חרבותינו...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"...we are members of a people we do not find shame in war. We hate dying a death that is not upon the battlefield. Our blood has spilled upon our swords...\"</p>\n<p>In terms of the general culture of Arabia at the time (and to a certain extent, to this day), such a passage fits perfectly. However, the author of the book included this section within a chapter in which he attempted to stress that the Jews of Arabia were pious, Hashem-fearing Jews and knowledgeable in the whole spectrum of Torah - halacha, aggadah, etc. This passage seemed to contradict that. The concept of wishing to die upon the battlefield (what the battle was about is not stated (note it is generally accepted that the Arabian Jewish tribes not only fought other Arab tribes but also other Jewish tribes - as was typical in Arabia)) seemed to me to be more in line with radical Jewish sects such as the Zealots - a line of thought that pretty much died out centuries earlier, but certainly wasn't one that our sages agreed with.</p>\n<p>So I was wondering whether there actually are such views in Chazal, the Geonim and/or the Rishonim that speak about the importance of dying on the battlefield, barring cases of Kiddush Hashem, that is (as Shmuel did not mention that this was the reason for the death)?</p>\n\n\n",

In the Introduction, <em>section III. A key to d'veikus - attachment to God</em>, he writes:</p>\n<p><em>B'rachos</em> play a vital role in hallowing the ordinary and mundane by declaring Godliness in relevant to all that we do. ... the text of each and every b'racha is testimony to a purposeful creation in which we are granted the priviledge to play a role.</p>\n<p>Furthermore to ensure that the performance of all the mitzvos, even the study of Torah, is infused with Divine purpose, Chazal prescribed b'rachos that direct the beneficiaries' attention to the fact that we are performing God's mitzvos and that we are learning His Torah. Observance of <em>mitzvos</em> without consciously associating that the observance is a Divine Will is not only unpallatable but ultimately self-defeating. For the goal of Creation is clinging of a man to Godliness. <em>B'rachos</em> are inextricably tied to the <strong>awe and reverence</strong> that a man to experience in his relation to the Creator.</p>\n<p>Failure to say a <em>b'racha</em> on a <em>mitzvah</em> can thus lead to performance of a <em>mitzvah</em> as a mundane matter, with lightheadedness, and lack any desire for <em>d'veikus</em> to God. In the complexity of modern life, one can easily forget lofty spiritual goals. The Talmud, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.85a.23-85b.1?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 85b</a> tells that the First Temple was destroyed because they did not make a blessing on the Torah. Failure to recite blessings turned the Torah study into an academic endeavor, rather than a sacred endeavor.</p>\n<p>In addition, lack of reciting blessings may lead to robbing oneself of the necessary joy and gladness in performing mitzvos. For example, the verse <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.28.47?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 28:47</a> explains reasons for punishments that fell upon the Jewish people: Because you would not serve your God <em>Hashem</em> in <strong>joy and gladness</strong> over the abundance of everything.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As \"מצוות לאו ליהנות נתנו\" - Mitzvot are not given for benefit - it seems this rule would not apply there.</p>\n\n\n",

This indicates that drawing upon Tehillim as an aspect of avodah has roots at least as early as the 2nd Temple. As a function of exile, the avodah is replaced with tefillah. Other than the berakhoth (in the amidah or otherwise) and the biblical obligation of shema, most of our prayers consist of Tehillim. Most of Pesuqe d'Zimra, Ashrei (read thrice daily), Tahanun, Lamnaseah, shir shel yom, most of Qabbalath Shabboth, Hallel, etc. are all comprised of Tehillim. The composition of Tehillim being mainly songs/hymns of praise and affirmation of divine salvation, readily lends itself to such use, whether communally or individually.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Tehillim was written by Dovid Hamelech, with Ru'ach Hakodesh.

No matter how much I read, I continue to come across new terms and wordplays.

The Mishna discusses if the employer or employee is liable to pay the כהן. A commentary, פני משה, on the Jerusalem Talmud explains that the question depends on how we look at the food that is given to an employee by his employer during his work day.</p>\n<p>The two ways of looking at it are as follows: Do we see the food as payment for the work and therefore the food the worker eats is considered the employers food that he sold to them, or do we look at it that without the food the workers would get more money for their work and therefore the food is considered the workers food. (I am as confused as you, see the link below.). I am struggling to understand what exactly is being said. It seems to me weird semantics like is the food being sold to the worker or does the worker have a right to the food and the owner is just being compensated for the loss of food.</p>\n<p>I know it maybe a bit involved and hard to understand. Thanks for your time. Plz let me know if the question is unclear.

    "title": "If the nations' ministers are all appointed by Hashem, why is it idol worship?",
    "content": "# If the nations' ministers are all appointed by Hashem, why is it idol worship?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I apologize if this is a stupid question, but I was pondering it today and I hope you will find it as interesting as I do. Every Rabbinic opinion I've seen, although there are plenty I haven't of course, says that Buddhism for example is idol worship because Buddha was a man and assigning god-like features to a man is idol worship. However, Kabbalah also teaches that some angels come to earth as humans, in human bodies, and also that each nation has a ministering angel appointed to it by G-d. In that case, how do we know the \"men\" that some cultures worship are not actually their ministering angels, appointed by G-d, who incarnated in human form as Buddha and so on?</p>\n<p>Because if all the religious cultures that exist now were not based on their proper \"minister\" that G-d assigned, then why would the majority of their people have been drawn to a religious person/angel different than the one that they can actually connect to? Would the majority at least have gravitated towards their ordained minister? There are obvious precedents for \"no, just look at...\" but I ask it anyway as part of the whole question. And if they were, then couldn't you say in some sense they are the god (lower case) of that nation, the one assigned by G-d to that nation, and the highest form of the energy of Deity/deity that that nation can reach without that intermediary? In which case, so long as the cultures did not attribute the creation of the world to for example Buddha, but rather said he is some spiritual representation of G-d (a minister) but not the Master G-d that created the world out of nothing, would it not be idol worship? Even the Christians don't say that Jesus was the Creator G-d all by himself, although they do say he was part of G-d even from the beginning as far as I know, and they don't treat him as an angel, so you could still call it idol worship for those reasons even if you didn't count the other.</p>\n<p>But that key distinction is a main part of this question. Is it idol worship because they worship Jesus, period, or is it only idol worship because of the Trinity doctrine and so on, whereas if they just worshiped him as their minister, or the aspect of G-d that they have access to, then it would not be?</p>\n<p>That is assuming there is any way to determine that the human man Jesus was an incarnation of the ministering angel for Christians in the first place, which I do not know. One rebuttal to the idea would be if only a different class of angels can enter into human form, not the ministering angels themselves. But considering who the Christians ministering angel is said to be, and how many stories there are of him/it possessing human form, I'm not sure this is the case. So here are the questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Can a ministering angel enter human form?</li>\n<li>Were Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, and others ministering angels in human forms?</li>\n<li>Is it idol worship for a nation to worship their ministering angel? Or</li>\n<li>Is it only idol worship for nation X to worship a human being, but not idol worship to worship their ministering angel? Which would then take us full circle back to question one and the distinctions there.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And 5. I forgot to put, does the large majority of a nation worshiping the same...person/angel/(what they believe is their deity)...for thousands of years prove that that is their appointed minister? Or could they conceivably have been worshiping the wrong minister that whole time?</p>\n<p>Edit: Most responses agree that it's idol worship. If we take that position, we do we reconcile it with this from the Zohar?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whoever curses his Elohim, NAMELY, ONE OF THE SEVENTY MINISTERS, even though it is idolatry, since I appointed them as ministers to guide the world, whoever curses and desecrates them, \"shall bear his sin\" surely. For by My power they exist and guide the people in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the nations can't pray to them because it's idol worship, how do they guide the nations?

[In Sefer HaMitzvot (positive commandment 2), however, he states \"Israel is commanded regarding the unification of God\"; from which it could be inferred that Gentiles need not believe in this concept and can combine their worship of God with other powers.] All authorities agree that such worship is forbidden for Jews\".</p>\n<p>Therefore, according to Rav Touger this type of worship is considered lawful for non-Jews by some Halachic authorities.</p>\n<p>It is not clear to me what poskim Rav Touger is referring to, he does not mention any names. I know the case of Nachmanides (Ramban), who however affirms the sole existence, for all Nations except Israel, of \"malachim\", that is, of \"separate intellects\", appointed by HaShem as His ministers called to govern the Gentiles ; but Nachmanides never considers it lawful for Gentiles to worship such intermediaries even when non-Jews recognize HaShem as Supreme Power, a conduct that Nachmanides still considers idolatry, and therefore forbidden also to Gentiles by Noahide Law.</p>\n<p>In a private conversation by email Rav Dr. David Berger, dean of Yeshiva University's Bernard Revel Graduate School of Jewish Studies,told me that  according to Rav Yaacov Emden, in Sheeilas Yaavetz 1:41,  Jews may not worship God along with lesser intermediaries while\nGentiles may. Even Gentiles may not worship God along with entities believed to be equal to Him.</p>\n<p>Rav Dr Berger himself acknowledges, however, that the exact understanding of Yaavetz's words is problematic, as emerges from his following translation of an excerpt from this responsum, kindly sent to the undersigned:</p>\n<p>“And surely (we have a favorable view) of these (Christians) nations, who are people of religion and law. They believe in the Creator of the world who governs\nit and rewards and punishes, and they affirm appropriate fundamentals..  Even though they sought many gods (a Talmudic term about shittuf), they are not commanded about this, as the sages said, ‘Noahides are not commanded regarding shittuf.’…Still, this requires investigation, because it seems that one who associates (God) with something else [i.e, one who engages in shittuf] is one who leaves the honor of the unitary God intact but places intermediaries between Him and the lower world” and associates them in His\nworship on the assumption that He wants them worshipped since the servant of the king is like the king.  This is what most idolaters did.  Christians [he doesn’t use the term, but the continuation appears to require this understanding], on the other hand,\nbelieve in different “beginnings and separate entities, even though they say that they are unitary.”  Thus it may be that they are not engaging in shittuf, but in worse heresy.  “Nevertheless, it is enough for us that all Israel considers them to be non-idolaters,\nand the Sages said that gentiles outside Israel are not idolaters but are merely following the customs of their ancestors.  Therefore their blood is precious in our eyes, and this would be the case even if we ruled over them and they were conquered under our\ncontrol in our land…”</p>\n<p>I am an amateur on the subject, but it seems difficult to me to be able to base solid halachic arguments on this responsum to support the legitimacy, for the Gentiles, of the worship towards intermediaries between humanity and HaShem. Yaavetz in fact expresses a positive judgment on Christian worship on an ethical level, but as for the monotheistic aspect he is more vague: it is true that he speaks of a shituf lawful for the Gentiles, but then he says that the type of Christian worship of intermediaries is typical of the most of the idolaters.</p>\n<p>If Rav Touger means\nreferring to authorities who have expressed arguments of this kind, I believe that his statement is weak.</p>\n\n\n",

Some slaves could own money, others could own property, and others only had a tax they had to pay. And although it's tempting to think/believe that only the Israelites were slaves in Egypt, the Torah refutes this idea very clearly. The book of Genesis discusses how Joseph's policies caused nearly the entire population to become slaves during the famine and remain so for a long period of time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יד  וַיְלַקֵּט יוֹסֵף, אֶת-כָּל-הַכֶּסֶף הַנִּמְצָא בְאֶרֶץ-מִצְרַיִם\nוּבְאֶרֶץ כְּנַעַן, בַּשֶּׁבֶר, אֲשֶׁר-הֵם שֹׁבְרִים; וַיָּבֵא יוֹסֵף\nאֶת-הַכֶּסֶף, בֵּיתָה פַרְעֹה.    14 And Joseph gathered up all the\nmoney that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan,\nfor the corn which they bought; and Joseph brought the money into\nPharaoh's house. טו  וַיִּתֹּם הַכֶּסֶף, מֵאֶרֶץ מִצְרַיִם וּמֵאֶרֶץ\nכְּנַעַן, וַיָּבֹאוּ כָל-מִצְרַיִם אֶל-יוֹסֵף לֵאמֹר הָבָה-לָּנוּ\nלֶחֶם, וְלָמָּה נָמוּת נֶגְדֶּךָ:  כִּי אָפֵס, כָּסֶף.    15 And when\nthe money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of\nCanaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said: 'Give us bread;\nfor why should we die in thy presence? for our money faileth.' טז\nוַיֹּאמֶר יוֹסֵף הָבוּ מִקְנֵיכֶם, וְאֶתְּנָה לָכֶם\nבְּמִקְנֵיכֶם--אִם-אָפֵס, כָּסֶף.     16 And Joseph said: 'Give your\ncattle, and I will give you [bread] for your cattle, if money fail.'\nיז  וַיָּבִיאוּ אֶת-מִקְנֵיהֶם, אֶל-יוֹסֵף, וַיִּתֵּן לָהֶם יוֹסֵף\nלֶחֶם בַּסּוּסִים וּבְמִקְנֵה הַצֹּאן וּבְמִקְנֵה הַבָּקָר,\nוּבַחֲמֹרִים; וַיְנַהֲלֵם בַּלֶּחֶם בְּכָל-מִקְנֵהֶם, בַּשָּׁנָה\nהַהִוא.   17 And they brought their cattle unto Joseph. And Joseph gave\nthem bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the\nherds, and for the asses; and he fed them with bread in exchange for\nall their cattle for that year. יח  וַתִּתֹּם, הַשָּׁנָה הַהִוא,\nוַיָּבֹאוּ אֵלָיו בַּשָּׁנָה הַשֵּׁנִית וַיֹּאמְרוּ לוֹ לֹא-נְכַחֵד\nמֵאֲדֹנִי, כִּי אִם-תַּם הַכֶּסֶף וּמִקְנֵה הַבְּהֵמָה אֶל-אֲדֹנִי:\nלֹא נִשְׁאַר לִפְנֵי אֲדֹנִי, בִּלְתִּי אִם-גְּוִיָּתֵנוּ\nוְאַדְמָתֵנוּ.    18 And when that year was ended, they came unto him\nthe second year, and said unto him: 'We will not hide from my lord,\nhow that our money is all spent; and the herds of cattle are my\nlord's; there is nought left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies,\nand our lands. יט  לָמָּה נָמוּת לְעֵינֶיךָ, גַּם-אֲנַחְנוּ גַּם\nאַדְמָתֵנוּ--קְנֵה-אֹתָנוּ וְאֶת-אַדְמָתֵנוּ, בַּלָּחֶם; וְנִהְיֶה\nאֲנַחְנוּ וְאַדְמָתֵנוּ, עֲבָדִים לְפַרְעֹה, וְתֶן-זֶרַע וְנִחְיֶה\nוְלֹא נָמוּת, וְהָאֲדָמָה לֹא תֵשָׁם.     19 Wherefore should we die\nbefore thine eyes, both we and our land? buy us and our land for\nbread, and we and our land will be bondmen unto Pharaoh; and give us\nseed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land be not\ndesolate.' כ  וַיִּקֶן יוֹסֵף אֶת-כָּל-אַדְמַת מִצְרַיִם, לְפַרְעֹה,\nכִּי-מָכְרוּ מִצְרַיִם אִישׁ שָׂדֵהוּ, כִּי-חָזַק עֲלֵהֶם הָרָעָב;\nוַתְּהִי הָאָרֶץ, לְפַרְעֹה.  20 So Joseph bought all the land of\nEgypt for Pharaoh; for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because\nthe famine was sore upon them; and the land became Pharaoh's. כא\nוְאֶת-הָעָם--הֶעֱבִיר אֹתוֹ, לֶעָרִים:  מִקְצֵה גְבוּל-מִצְרַיִם,\nוְעַד-קָצֵהוּ.    21 And as for the people, he removed them city by\ncity, from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end\nthereof. כב  רַק אַדְמַת הַכֹּהֲנִים, לֹא קָנָה:  כִּי חֹק לַכֹּהֲנִים\nמֵאֵת פַּרְעֹה, וְאָכְלוּ אֶת-חֻקָּם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן לָהֶם\nפַּרְעֹה--עַל-כֵּן, לֹא מָכְרוּ אֶת-אַדְמָתָם.    22 Only the land of\nthe priests bought he not, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh,\nand did eat their portion which Pharaoh gave them; wherefore they sold\nnot their land. כג  וַיֹּאמֶר יוֹסֵף אֶל-הָעָם, הֵן קָנִיתִי אֶתְכֶם\nהַיּוֹם וְאֶת-אַדְמַתְכֶם לְפַרְעֹה; הֵא-לָכֶם זֶרַע, וּזְרַעְתֶּם\nאֶת-הָאֲדָמָה.    23 Then Joseph said unto the people: 'Behold, I have\nbought you this day and your land for Pharaoh.

And then once the famine was over the Israelites wouldn't be pressured to sell their livestock since food would become available again.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that if most Egyptians are slaves during the book of Exodus like Genesis implies, that means that the Egyptians who gave Israelites silver and gold were also slaves. And just like other Egyptian slaves could have excess gold and silver to give, it's not so surprising that Israelites would have livestock.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Bnai Yisrael were shepherds and had flocks that they maintained during the years of slavery.

For example if Jesse was Jesse's holy name, who I use as the example just because he makes a good example of someone purely holy, what was his name from the kelipot? Meaning even though it never attached to him, what was it in the kelipot? And some figures their unholy name attached to sometimes in their low moments but they overcame it. What was theirs?</p>\n<p>And same question for every person in Tanakh, but if not the name for every person can't be found, since that's a long list, then just the most prominent people. And then for the wicked (or mostly wicked) in Tanakh whose name written there may have already been their \"kelipot-name\" so to speak, what were their holy names (even if they never attained them)? For most figures we're only told one name in Tanakh, so what is the \"other\" one? And for some figures they have many aliases in the midrash but most seem to be aliases of their name from one side or the other, which still doesn't tell us their name from the other side.</p>\n<p>To those answering who have an entire list, of course please post it, but to those answering who do not, I still appreciate just answering whichever ones you know.

If a person while living in this world is able to ascertain and know the name of the kelipa within him, he can thereby know from which level within Adam Bliya’al it was taken. In this way, he can understand his defect and the tikun [rectification process] he requires. This would then make rectification simpler and separation from the kelipa possible during his lifetime, as opposed to after death...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>that part is a mostly direct translation from shar hagilgulim and he nothing to do with chabad.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I don’t think it means a name.

    "content": "# How should one understand the reference to ‘horsemen’, ‘bows’ and ‘arrows’ in the Gog / Magog prophecies?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom.</p>\n<p>I am a bit confused by the reference of ‘horses’ and ‘horsemen’, ‘bows’ and ‘arrows’ in Yechezkel 38 and 39. It certainly would be a greater miracle than the one described if mankind were reduced to using these weapons of war again before the final battle!</p>\n<p>I understand that these may be figures of speech, but why were these terms used instead of other, less confusing, neutral ones (like ‘weapons’ or ‘vehicles’)?</p>\n<p>Many thanks.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The same language can be found in Zechariah 9:10</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And I will cut off the <strong>chariots</strong> from Ephraim, and the <strong>horses</strong> from Jerusalem; and the <strong>bow of war</strong> shall be cut off. And he shall speak peace to the nations, and his rule shall be from the sea to the west and from the river to the ends of the earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As explicitly stated, the bow is a \"bow of war\" and these languages are allegories to the attitude that will be predominant during God and Magog.</p>\n<p>One verse prior to this, in Zechariah 9:9</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Be exceedingly happy, O daughter of Zion; Shout, O daughter of Jerusalem. Behold! Your king shall come to you. He is just and victorious; humble, and <strong>riding a donkey</strong> and a foal, the offspring of [one of] she-donkeys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi comments that the donkey is a \"symbol of humility\".</p>\n<p>I heard from Rabbi Tovia Singer that in terms of war, horses were used to charge into battle, denoting the haughty attitude nations would have to rush into battle to overcome their enemies and demonstrate their greatness. Unlike the Messiah, who will be \"riding on a donkey\", he will have an attitude enveloped with humility in rebuking the nations for their haughtiness.</p>\n<p>The removal of the chariots and horses in Jerusalem is the removal of this behavior from not only the haughty nations, but haughty people. Rashi also comments in Zechariah 9:10 that the chariots will be removed \"for they will not need them\".</p>\n<p>Zephaniah 3:9 expresses the state of the people after Gog and Magog:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For then I will convert the peoples to a pure language that all of them call in the name of the Lord, to worship Him of one accord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These same teachings can be read into Ezekiel's prophecies in chapters 38 and 39.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Man_and_God%2C_Chapter_1_the_Knowledge_of_God.32?ven=Detroit:_Wayne_State_University_Press,_1969&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Man and G-d, Chapter 1, The Knowlegde Of G-d\"</a> Rabbi Eliezer Berkovits writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another passage, dealing also with the theme of Israel’s future redemption tells of the prophetic vision of the feast of G-d on the mountains of Israel. The birds of prey and the beasts of the field are invited to feed on “the flesh of the mighty” and to drink “the blood of the princes.” They are promised that they will be filled at G-d’s table “with horses and horsemen, with mighty men, and with all men of war.”\nThe two passages are rather different in tone. The one draws the idyllic picture of restoration and rebirth, the other speaks of wrath and judgment. The first describes the impact that G-d’s redemptive act on behalf of Israel has on the nations. In the second example, on the other hand, the stress is on the significance for Israel of G-d’s judgment over the nations. G-d’s providential intervention in history is a revelation that He is G-d when the providential act is for the sake of Israel and is viewed by the nations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R' Eliezer Berkovits explains \"horsemen\" as \"the flesh of the mighty\". Similary, this is also taught in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaIkkarim%2C_Maamar_3.24.8?ven=Sefer_Ha-ikkarim,_Jewish_Publication_Society_of_America,_1929&vhe=Sefer_Ha-%27ikkarim&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkkarim (Maamar 3:24:8)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“He delighteth not in the strength of the horse,” alludes to His will, and the meaning is that His will is not in favor of horsemen or of men of stature and strong arm. But “The Lord taketh pleasure in them that fear Him, in those that wait for His mercy;” for G-d saves not with valor and strength.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Between_Yesterday_and_Tomorrow%2C_I%3B_Between_Yesterday_and_Tomorrow.5.11?ven=Oxford:_The_East_and_West_library,_1945&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Eliezer Berkovits</a> explains somewhere else that in \"that day\" there will be a time of trial:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In that terrible time of trial and suspense, while the “horsemen” of the enemy “fly as a vulture that hasteth to devour”, while they “gather captives as the sand”, “scoff at kings and princes”, “deride every stronghold”, in that time the just will live by his faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it seems that \"the horsemen\" are the mighty ones....</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.96a.9?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Sanhedrin 96a)</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>when I compensate Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who ran before Me like horses</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this, <a href=\"https://rabbirudman.wordpress.com/2021/04/02/hashems-chariot-of-fire/#_ftn10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Zave Rudman explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The efforts of the Avos to serve HaShem are compared to the racing of a horse before its master.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Belief-with worship only towards HaShem - in the real existence of intermediaries between the Almighty and the Gentile Nations\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am an Italian Noahide.</p>\n<p>There are several discussions in this forum about shituf, understood as associating other entities with HaShem.</p>\n<p>Unless I am mistaken, it is generally held that on the halachic level worshiping such intermediaries constitutes idolatry even for non-Jews (a possible, though not very clear, exception could be represented by Rav Yaacov Emden in She'eilas Yaavetz 1:41, see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/128318/if-the-nations-ministers-are-all-appointed-by-hashem-why-is-it-idol-worship\">here </a> ).</p>\n<p>A different issue is the status concerning belief in such intermediaries with worship only towards HaShem .</p>\n<p>Two very authoritative codes of the Noahide Law, namely Rav Moshe Weiner's The Divine Code and Rav Oury Cherki's Brit Shalom, state that the belief in question, if not accompanied by worship towards these \"lesser powers\", is lawful for Gentiles, although Rav Weiner adds, so not exactly consistent for me, that if a non-Jew professes this belief he is not a \"pious among the Gentiles\", which determines his non-participation in the World to Come (see Rambam's Mishneh Torah Hilchot Melachim 8: 11; Rav Weiner does not establish such exclusion explicitly, but this  is the logical consequence of his words).</p>\n<p>Rav Oury Cherki says, in the English edition of Brit Shalom:</p>\n<p>\"An individual or nation believing it is being led by some power, whether physical or spiritual – which exists on a lower level than the all-encompassing Creator – is not prohibited as long as no worship is associated with said belief\"</p>\n<p>In support of his ruling,Rav Cherki quotes Rabbeinu Bahya (Rav Bahya ben Asher ibn Halawa), Commentary on Deuteronomy 31:16.</p>\n<p>I report below Rabbeinu Bahya's words in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Devarim.31.16.3?ven=Torah_Commentary_by_Rabbi_Bachya_ben_Asher,_trans._Eliyahu_Munk,_1998.&vhe=Midrash_Rabbeinu_Bachya_%5Bben_Asher%5D._Warsaw,_1878&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> the English translation from Sefaria website</a> :</p>\n<p><em>(...)After the gods of the foreigners of the land.” The Torah tells us that such gods as had been permitted to the Gentile nations were nonetheless “strangers” in the Holy Land as that land was always under the direct supervision of the Lord, and He had never assigned what goes on there to the supervision of any celestial/planetary forces. This land is G-d’s own “inheritance.” This is also what the sages meant when they said אין מזל לישראל, “the Jewish people are not subject to the horoscopic influences we know as mazal.” They meant that the Jewish people, when in the land of Israel and observing the laws of the Torah, are not subject to such influences. This must be so, as we have a clear statement by these same sages that מזלו גורם, that “his mazal was a causative factor in his fate.” (Yevamot 64, et al) Seeing that the planets, stars, and all other celestial phenomena have been created for the sake of the righteous, how could it possibly be that these same righteous people are suddenly subject to these horoscopic constellations? Each of these horoscopic constellations has been assigned to certain nations, such as the constellation known as scorpion which was assigned to the people of Ishmael, the constellation Sagittarius, the archer, to the people of Persia, etc., etc. This was what the Torah referred to in Deut. 4,19-20 “which He assigned to them, whereas He (personally) took you out of the iron crucible, etc.” Clearly, the supervision of the fates of the other nations by celestial forces has been entrusted to agents of the Lord, i.e. the horoscopic forces, whereas that of the Jewish people is not determined by means of intermediaries. It is noteworthy that nowhere in the Torah does G-d accuse the Gentile nations of idolatry or describe them as being punished for relating to these forces as gods. Only the Jewish people have been warned again and again not to turn to any form of intermediary, and they are being held responsible for observing this commandment in the strictest possible sense. The only time Gentile nations are described as being punished for the practice of idolatry is if they did so in the Holy Land, the land which G-d claimed as His share and inheritance''</em></p>\n<p>Now, from reading the aforementioned passage it seems to me that Rabbeinu Bahya supports the real existence of these intermediaries, celestial powers appointed by HaShem as His ministers in charge of governing the Gentile Nations  according to the orders of the Creator,while Israel alone is directly subjected to the rule of HaShem, without the presence of any intermediary</p>\n<p>A similar conception seems to me to belong to another very authoritative master, Nachmanides (Ramban), who often expresses himselfelf in these terms in his Commentary on the Torah, for example when he says, on Leviticus 18.25 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Leviticus.18.25.1?ven=Commentary_on_the_Torah_by_Ramban_(Nachmanides)._Translated_and_annotated_by_Charles_B._Chavel._New_York,_Shilo_Pub._House,_1971-1976&vhe=On_Your_Way_New&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">translation from Sefaria website</a>:</p>\n<p><em>''The Glorious Name created all things and placed the power of the lower creatures in the higher beings, giving upon each nation in their lands, after their nations, some known star or constellation, as it is known by means of astrological speculation. It is in referring to what is said, that the Eternal, your G-d has assigned to all the people, for he has assigned to all nations constellations in the heavens, and higher above them are the angels of the Supreme who has placed as lords on them, as it is written: \"But the prince of the kingdom of Persia resisted me\" (Daniel 10:13), and it is written: \"Behold, the prince of Greece will come\" (Daniel 10:20), and \"there I was left with the kings of Persia\".\nNow the Glorious Name is G-d of gods, and Lord of lords over all the world. But the Land of Israel, which is in the midst of the inhabited earth, is the inheritance of the Eternal designated by His Name. He has not set any of the angels as a leader, observer or ruler, as He has given it as an inheritance to His people who declare the Unity of His Name, the seed of His beloved [ie the patriarchs]. It is in reference to this that he said, and you will be my own treasure among all peoples; for all the earth is Mine, and it is also written, so you will be My people, and I will be your G-d, and you will not be subject to other powers at all.\"</em></p>\n<p>This conception is not without Talmudic foundation : in fact we read in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.156a.12?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> the  Gemara-Shabbat 156a</a>, the following passage:</p>\n<p>\"<em>It was stated that Rabbi Ḥanina says: A constellation makes one wise and a constellation makes one wealthy, and there is a constellation for the Jewish people that influences them. Rabbi Yoḥanan said: There is no constellation for the Jewish people that influences them. The Jewish people are not subject to the influence of astrology. And Rabbi Yoḥanan follows his own reasoning, as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived that there is no constellation for the Jewish people? As it is stated: “Thus said the Lord: Learn not the way of the nations, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the nations are dismayed at them” (Jeremiah 10:2). The nations will be dismayed by them, but not the Jewish people.\nAnd Rav also holds that there is no constellation for the Jewish people, as Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: From where is it derived that there is no constellation for the Jewish people? As it is stated with regard to Abraham: “And He brought him outside, and said: Look now toward heaven, and count the stars, if you are able to count them; and He said unto him: So shall your offspring be” (Genesis 15:5). The Sages derived from this that Abraham said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, “Behold, You have given me no offspring, and one born in my house is to be my heir” (Genesis 15:3). The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to him: No. “And, behold, the word of the Lord came to him, saying: This man shall not be your heir; rather, one that will come forth from your own innards shall be your heir” (Genesis 15:4).\"</em></p>\n<p>Always regarding the belief in the role played by the stars as intermediary authorities between HaShem and humanity , I transcribe below what my famous compatriot RaMHaL (Rav Moshe Chaim Luzzatto) affirms in his work \"Derekh HaShem\" (II, chapter 7- The influence of the stars):</p>\n<p><em>\"There is another function that God assigned to the stars. Every event and situation in the material world is prepared and initiated on high, and then is transmitted via the stars, step by step, finally appearing in the desired physical forms below. For example , life itself, wealth, wisdom, children and so forth all originate on high in the realm of the spiritual Roots, reflected down through Branches of these Roots through the agency of particular stars, so that the different phenomena take form on earth in their desired states. This is the result of particular divisions and combinations of the stars, following their specific cycles. Every event that takes place in the terrestrial world is allocated to a particular star, depending on its specific category. All terrestrial things are bound under their authority Through their systems, all things happen as a result of the influence emanating from the stellar array through its connection with each individual thing.\nEvery human being is also subjugated to this system, and whatever happens to him is a result of this astrological influence. It is also possible, however, that this stellar influence be overridden by a higher power. [Accordingly], our Sages teach us, '[The people of] Israel are not bound by the influences of the horoscope (mazal).' The power of God's decrees and influence is stronger than that of the stars, and what results is therefore dependent on this higher influence rather than on the astrological \".</em></p>\n<p>I point out that several others great Sages of Israel in the Middle Ages, like for example Rav Saadia Gaon (in his commentary on the Book of Creation), Rav Solomon ibn Gabirol (in his Keter Malkhut), Rav Abraham bar Hiyya ha-Nasi and Rav Abraham ibn Ezra considered astrology to be true wisdom and even expressed this belief in their works.Rav Judah Halevi also acknowledges in his magnum opus, Sefer ha-Kuzari, that the celestial bodies have an influence on earthly affairs.</p>\n<p>It seems to me therefore that, on the basis of the teaching by several  very authoritative Rabbis, the belief (I repeat, with worship only towards HaShem) in the real existence of intermediaries between the Creator and the Gentiles (while for Israel there is no intermediary, since HaShem directly governs the Jews) is a conception not only lawful, but also correct since such intermediaries really exist.</p>\n<p>I therefore do not understand on what halachic basis Rav Weiner, in The Divine Code, can affirm that this belief prevents a non-Jew from being a \"pious among the Gentiles\",and that even this belief constitutes idolatry for the Jews, unless I believe that great masters such as Rabbeinu Bahya,Nachmanides, Saadia Gaon,Judah Halevi,RaMHaLetc.etc. are heretics who have spread teachings contrary to the Torah.</p>\n<p>From Rav Moshe Weiner's The Divine Code, Limited Edition vol. 1:</p>\n<p><em>Therefore,a person is also an idol worshiper if he serves God along another entity as an intermediary,even if he says that the Lord is the \"main God\",but he also serves another power. This is so regardless of whether one serves the intermediary alone,for example by bringing a sacrificial offering or bowing down to it,or if he brings a sacrifice and bows down and says that this service is for both God and the intermediary.\nHowever,if a person serves only the Lord,but he also believes there is another power or god under the Lord's command that one should also have faith in and swar by,then he is called a \"believer in an intermediary\".</em>\n<em>\"Great Rabbinical authorities throughout history debated whether the false belief in an intermediary is actually idolatry and therefore prohibited to Gentiles, or if it is not included in the basic Noahide prohibition of idol worship and therefore not forbidden for Gentiles. The majority opinion and practical ruling is that it is not forbidden. But it is unrighteous, i. e. the person is not one of the Pious of the nations of the world\" ( pag. 111).</em></p>\n<p>\"<em>Even though belief in an intermediary in not forbidden to Gentiles,this belief is not true.It is fitting for every person to see the mistake in this idea ,which originated in the mistaken beliefs of Enosh and his generation, and to distance oneself from it, especially since many of the grat Sages determinated that this belief is actually idol worship (see Rambam quoted in footnote 6 above, - my note: about christian worship towards a  divine trinity-)  , and  according to all opinions it is considereded to be idolatry for Jews.\n<em>Even for those Rabbinical opinions maintaining that belief in an intermediary is permitted for a Gentile, this only means that the person should not be considered ad idolater.But a person does not reach the spiritual level of a Pious Gentile as long as he holding such a belief.\"</em> (pages 203/204)</em></p>\n<p>But Rambam considers the worship of intermediaries idolatry, not mere belief in them : <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/912360/jewish/Avodat-Kochavim-Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah -Avodat Kochavim 2:1</a></p>\n<p><em>The essence of the commandment [forbidding] the worship of false gods is not to serve any of the creations, not an angel, a sphere, or a star, none of the four fundamental elements, nor any entity created from them. Even if the person worshiping knows that ‘ה is the [true] God and serves the creation in the manner in which Enosh and the people of his generation worshiped [the stars] originally, he is considered to be an idol worshiper.\nThe Torah warns us about this, saying [Deuteronomy 4:19]: \"Lest you lift your eyes heavenward and see the sun, the moon, and the stars... [and bow down and worship them], the entities which God apportioned to all the nations.\" This implies that you might inquire with \"the eye of the heart\" and it might appear to you that these entities control the world, having been apportioned by God to all the nations to be alive, to exist, and not to cease existence, as is the pattern of [the other creations with] the world. Therefore, you might say that it is worthy to bow down to them and worship them.\nFor this reason, [Deuteronomy 11:16] commands: \"Be very careful that your heart not be tempted [to go astray and worship other gods].\" This implies that the thoughts of your heart should not lead you astray to worship these and make them an intermediary between you and the Creator.</em></p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah-Hilchot Teshuvah chapter three</a>,Rambam himself furthermore describes twenty four categories of individuals who <em>\"do not have a portion in the world to come. Rather, their [souls] are cut off and they are judged for their great wickedness and sins , forever\"</em>.</p>\n<p>In point 3.14 Rambam makes it clear that they are \"cut off\" even if they are Jews, which makes it clear that he is talking about both Jews and Gentiles.</p>\n<p>Well, in point 3.7 Rambam identifies, in the sub-category of \"minim\":</p>\n<p><em>\"one who serves a star, constellation, or other entity so that it will serve as an intermediary between him and the eternal Lord\" <em>(see Avodat Kokhavim 2:1)</em></em></p>\n<p>thus confirming that the exclusion from world to come is, in his statement, about those who worship the intermediaries, not those who believe in their existence but worship only HaShem.</p>\n<p>It is true, Rambam disputes this belief, but he does not consider it an obstacle for non-Jews to achieve the status of \"pious Gentiles\", nor does he claim that it even constitutes idolatry for Jews: if he had issued this last sentence, he would have accused so many great sages of Israel of idolatry!</p>\n<p>The reference to what Rambam says about Christian worship does not seem to me to be relevant to the present case. True, Rambam claims that Christians are idolaters (uncensored version of Mishneh Torah-Avodat Kochavim 9:4; Hilchot Ma'achalot Assurot 11: 7), and this is in accordance with what is established by the Oral Torah (Gemara-Avodah Zarah 6a and 7b); however, Christianity is not a simple set of beliefs, but is a religion based on worship towards a divine trinity, to which Catholics and Eastern churches\n(obviously in the times of Maimonides, and even more so in the Talmudic times, the evangelical churches did not yet exist) add worship towards \"angels\", \"saints\" and Mary, the mother of Jesus the Nazarene, who is also called \"the mother of G-d \"; Catholics and Eastern Christians also make extensive use of cultic statues, in front of which they kneel and perform other service activities: they are all conducts of worship, not mere beliefs.</p>\n<p>It is true that traditional Christian beliefs, according to Rambam, prevent the adherent from participating in the world from coming regardless of the type of worship practiced.\nIn fact, in Mishneh Torah-Hilchot Tesuvah 3:8 Maimonides indicates, among those whose souls are cut off as \"Torah deniers\":</p>\n<p><em>\"one who says that though the Torah came from the Almighty, the Creator has replaced one mitzvah with another one and nullified the original Torah, like the Muslims (literally \"the Hagarites\") and the Christians\"</em> (uncensored version of the passage, attested in the authoritative Yemeni manuscripts of the Mishneh Torah, as I have verified with friends and scholars of \"Mechon Mamre\").</p>\n<p>It is therefore attested in Rambam that certain beliefs in themselves determine the exclusion from participation in the world to come, both for Jews and for Gentiles, positions however to which the simple belief in the existence of intermediaries does not belong, if only HaShem is worshiped and the perpetual validity of the Torah is not contested ((in this direction there are great Sages of the Torah such as the aforementioned Rabbeinu Bahya, Nachmanides, Judah Halevi etc. etc.).</p>\n<p>Therefore I think that Rav Cherki's rule about this point is much more solid, on the halachic plane, than Rav Weiner's rule.</p>\n<p>Are there other rabbis and / or poskim who deliberate on this matter in line with this, in my opinion, highly questionable ruling taken by Rav Moshe Weiner?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I transcribe below the kind response I received on the matter from Rav Dr Michael Schulman, editor of \"The Divine Code\" by Rav Moshe Weiner, as well as executive director of Ask Noah International:</p>\n<p>\"You're specific observation was based on a misunderstanding you have about the definition of \"sheetuf\", so it is worthy to make a clarification about that in the text of The Divine Code.\n\"Belief in a sheetuf\" does not refer to belief that an entity exists, or that it has operational influence in the creation (i.e., that it's operational influence in the creation exists). For example, it is well accepted within halacha that the planets, stars and mazalot, as well as the different angels at their different spiritual levels, play a role in the channeling of sustenance and the course of events into this world, from the spiritual source of that sustenance and those events. The book does not intend to intimate that this is not correct, nor that acceptance of (or \"belief in\") this fact is in any way unrighteous or not pious for either Jews or Gentiles. As I said, see Part II, topic 11:10 and the footnote there, about authentic astrology and Gentiles, and the underlying intent that this applies even for Chasidei Umot Ha'Olam.</p>\n<p>Rather, the correct / accurate meaning of \"belief in a sheetuf\" refers to the person's belief about the nature of the operational influence which an entity has. This can be with the accepted understanding that the entity does have influence (such as the mazalot and the angels). I refer you to the book True Existence, which presents and explains a Chassidic discourse on this subject:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/15721\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">True Existence </a></p>\n<p>Note: If a person believes that an imaginary thing exists in the physical or spiritual realm, and he believes that it has some supra-natural influence in the world, then whether or not that also constitutes \"belief in a sheetuf\" (which would be in addition to being foolish or misinformed for believing that the thing exists) will depend on his belief about the nature of the influence which he imagines that it has.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, even with that clarification about the definition of \"belief in a sheetuf\", a separate clarification (i.e. additional explanation) also needs to be added in the book about how \"belief in a sheetuf\" (which is not forbidden for Gentiles) affects the spiritual standing of a Gentile\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In your question, you confused intermediaries with independent powers. The constellations have no power of their own, not even controlled power. They are like hammers compared to an arm: They are simply the things directly affected by G-D, and everything that happens is a butterfly affect from that. They have no power whatsoever. Serving them is as stupid as talking to a hammer instead of the person using it. Just like a hammer is a special tool of bumpy rock, constellations are special tools of spherical plasma. Neither one is alive, and neither has any power.</p>\n<p>G-D controls the Jews directly, instead of through constellations. This can be related to a person using his own hands instead of a hammer.</p>\n\n\n",

This would mean that Darius, as the son of a Jewish woman, was a Jew. However this is difficult to reconcile with the Talmud's treatment of his actions (vis a vis his intentions in the bringing of sacrifices) through the lens of identifying him as a gentile (RH 3b).</p>\n<p>R. Jacob Hagiz (Halakhoth Qetanoth 2:240) suggests that insofar as he was raised as a gentile, he is treated as a mumar (apostate). And that a mumar, in the Talmud's case here, is treated as a gentile. In which case, though he was as the son of Esther a Jew, he is nevertheless <em>treated as a gentile</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Is he the one who permitted the construction of the Second Temple?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, according to this tradition, it is the same Darius.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Did she have only one son with the king?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not believe there is any known evidence of any additional children.</p>\n\n\n",

Solomon reigned for 40 years and when he died his 41-year-old son Rehoboam became king. Obviously this means Rehoboam was born one year before Solomon's accession. If we accept the Seder Olam figure, this means that Solomon became a father at the age of 11, two years before he had the legal ability to effect a marriage. That a minor cannot effect a marriage is taken as common-knowledge in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.50b.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Aramaic&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Talmud</a>: קטן שקידש הכל יודעין שאין  קידושי קטן  כלום.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question is based on the Talmud's statement that an underage boy cannot affect a marriage. This is correct, but it neglects the fact that a boy's father can affect a marriage on his behalf (<a href=\"https://manuscripts.sefaria.org/kaufman_a_50/ms50-100r-large.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah</a>).

One can understand this to mean that the rules were different then, and in earlier generation  perhaps an 8 or 9 year old could effect a marriage unlike later periods</p>\n\n\n",

Per p'shat Tanach, we do not know what his relationship to them was. The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.91a.13?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 91a</a> however states that he was their uncle (Elimelech's brother). This is important because it means that he most likely wasn't halachically grieving at the time, since Avimelech passed away some time prior (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ruth.1.3-4?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ruth 1:3-4</a>).</p>\n<p>As for the point of his failed marriage - well, the Torah if I remember correctly only brings two possible reasons for divorcing, and that's if a man doesn't like something his wife does (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.24.1?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 24:1</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"When a man taketh a wife, and marrieth her, then it cometh to pass, if she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some unseemly thing in her, that he writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>or he hates her (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.24.3?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibid. 3</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"and the latter husband hateth her, and writeth her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it seems that Ploni didn't really have a good reason not to marry Ruth: He wasn't grieving and though he was divorced, he would have only been all too happy to be rid of his first wife. He should have celebrated the divorce, it being a mitzvah, by making another (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one mitzvah leads to another</a>): Marrying his nephew's wife in a levirate marriage.</p>\n<p>Besides, he was from the Tribe of Yehudah.

I'm a non-Jew (that's why I'm posting this on Shabbat) and I've been learning about Judaism for the last couple of years or so. There isn't much reliable learning material in my native language. So I have to learn everything online. I read the whole Chumash with Rashi's commentary on chabad website (because I couldn't afford the physical book), and Mesilat Yesharim on dafyomireview website. And I've listened to hundreds of hours of shiurim on youtube. And I read every Q&A on torasavigdor website, and I even got involved with kiruv. Then a rabbi gifted me an ArtScroll Stone Ed. Chumash and I'm on page 675 right now.</p>\n<p>My question is this: Right now I'm reading Sefer Vayikra and I'm forcing myself to read it. I don't feel like it's relevant to me. Is it my yetzer hara or should I continue reading it? I mean it's not just the Chumash. Most of Judaism doesn't apply to me, that's for sure. BUT I must say that thanks to all my mussar and hashkafah studies (and thanks to Hashem obviously) I became a much better person (bli ayin hara)😊, I can't deny that . Should I continue learning Torah? I try very hard to find an alternative to Torah but I fail everytime. It's mamash ingrained in my soul. But I feel like most of it is not relevant to me.\nAlso I got no problems with Jews being Am HaNivchar, etc. but it makes me feel weird that I'm not a member of the nation I support...

I and presumably you have red color vision. If a photon of the red wavelength hits our eyes, then we will recognise that as red. If red light hits stained glass windows, we don't just see black since a windows is in the way, rather we see a lot of red coming through the clear glass, some red coming through the red glass, and a bit of light coming through the other colors.</p>\n<p>So, what happens when you put a bottle of non-mevushal wine between Superman's eyes and the x-ray source? The x-ray goes through as if it wasn't there and he doesn't see it. Similarly for Challa, Hashem, Tzitzis, and the exact opposite for the moon. The earth can block x-rays and would therefore hide part of the moon's light.</p>\n<p>Regarding Tzniut, there are several sources that require covering up to the collarbone. That can be problematic when it comes to x-ray vision. However, the solution is \"simple\". Rather than normal people being required to cover themselves with something that block the visual spectrum (ie. normal, non-see-though, clothing), Kryptons will have to wear lead clothing. Similarly with Duchaning, the Talit will have to be made of lead.</p>\n<p>As for the table, that would depend what the table and wall was made of. It it was simple wood, then x-ray vision wouldn't help. If the wall was made of stone, then x-ray vision wouldn't help either. However, if the table was made out of dense material, like stone, but the wall wasn't, then that would mean that he could see that table.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# HALACHICALY Is it ok to download YouTube videos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question has confounded me for some time. On the one hand, from the research I've done, it's definitely against the terms of service which you agree to. On the other, everything I've read on the matter noted that YouTube has expressed no desire yet to penalise this behavior, but does shut down certain 3rd party sites built to do this. Implying from this they are obviously aware that people do this, (if that makes any difference, not sure it does), the question still becomes a more foggy one - is it an act of stealing? You're not depriving anyone of any money, other than the potential funds they <em>would have</em> gotten from your view, but there's no act of stealing. I'm of course talking from complete ignorance, so if anyone could shed some light on the matter, it would be much appreciated!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Question about Joseph the Righteous, Yoshke, and Capture and Enclothing by the Sitra Ahra\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Still aspects unanswered, please see edit at bottom of post if interested.</em></p>\n<p>The book <em>Divine and Demonic in the Poetic Mythology of the Zohar</em> (p. 247) discusses the concept of the \"Other side\" \"capturing\" and \"enclothing\" the \"Holy.\" Some examples it gives are: the rabbinic dictum that \"Tyre was only filled from the ruins of Jerusalem,\" (p. 245, foonoted: <em>Ets Hayim</em>, II, 57b. See Tishby, <em>Torat Ha-Ra</em>, 89), Lilit enclothing the Shechinah (p. 247, footnoted to <em>Kin'at Hashem</em>, 96), and a tradition transmitted by the Talmud that Jeroboam engraved divine names on the mouth of an idol, empowering it to speak (Sotah 47a, Sanhedrin 107b). The author then continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Luzzatto also declares that it was from this sort of dynamic that\nother arch- villains were able to derive their power, like Jesus and\nthe “evil Armilus,” in both of whom the Messiah-son-of-Joseph was\nenclothed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is footnoted to Ramhal's Qin'ath Hashem (p. 104), <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51257&st=&pgnum=102&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51257&st=&pgnum=102&hilite=</a>.\nThe Hebrew is too difficult for me to parse. Can someone please explain the mechanics of this system of thought, and/or translate the relevant passages? Specifically I'm wondering: 1. why did MBJ's soul become enclothed in these arch-villains (i.e., maybe a Divine plan to destroy evil from within, a concept also discussed in <em>Divine and Demonic</em>? Maybe multiple reasons?), and 2. what dictates whether the 'enclothed' or the 'enclother' has agency (i.e. did MBJ's soul have any control over Yoshe's body <em>and</em> soul which \"enclothed\" it, or was it an inoperative prisoner or something in between)?\nThank you. And also big thank you to @Deuteronomy and @Isaac Moses for helping me to edit down the question.</p>\n<p><em>Edit: page 102 was linked by mistake, not 104, however, question seems to be addressed from page 102 to 105.

Why did MBJ's soul become enclothed in these arch-villains?</em></p>\n<p>Ramchal explains that Yerov'am (Jeroboam), being both a descendant of Yosef and Efraim and having a very holy soul, had the potential to be the Mashiach ben Yosef of his generation. The spirit of MBY still hadn't rested upon him, but since a certain  link between the two had already been established, when he sinned - he caused a blemish to appear on the root of the spirit. In order to clean the blemish, it is therefore necessary for this spirit to do what Yerov'am did which caused the blemish in the first place:</p>\n<p>Yerov'am clothed something holy with impure vessels - he wished to worship Hashem with golden calves. So the spirit must now clothe itself with impure bodies - kind of like minus times minus equals plus.</p>\n<p>I gather that eventually the spirit of MBY will have purified itself enough to finally enter the true MBY person, but that person will then have to die - that's the last step of the purification process (and see Ramchal's <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Derekh_HaShem%2C_Part_One%2C_On_Mankind.9?ven=Sefaria_Edition_2019,_Translated_by_Rabbi_Francis_Nataf.&vhe=Handwritten_Manuscript_EH_47_C_32._1896.&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem 1:3:9</a> and onwards) and only then will its true potential be unleashed.</p>\n<p><em>2. What dictates whether the 'enclothed' or the 'enclother' has agency (i.e. did MBJ's soul have any control over Yoshe's body and soul which \"enclothed\" it, or was it an inoperative prisoner or something in between)?</em></p>\n<p>It sounds like the spirit of MBY will be powerless within the body of the impure person. It'll act like a kind of super-battery, giving that person great power to do evil, but won't be able to act of its own accord. As the Ramchal wrote (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"and then it would come and be clothed within the evil Armilus. And from the power that he [Armilus] would receive from this enclothing, he would do wondrous<sup>1</sup> things in the world...and this would have been a great corruption, and would have brought chas v'shalom incomparable anquish to Yisrael.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It does not sound from here that the spirit has any control over Armilus.</p>\n<p>Hope this makes sense.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> From the context, the term seems to refer to \"wondrous\" in a negative way (like managing to kill millions of people in a short time or something like that).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The 'No True Scotsman' Fallacy and Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I don't know if this has been asked before, perhaps with different terminology.</p>\n<p>There is a well-known fallacy, that in the realm of religious debates, comes up often especially with regards to \"The One True Way of [insert religion]\"™, and that is the No True Scotsman Fallacy, which was explained simply thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Person A: \"No Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\"<br />\nPerson B: \"But my uncle Angus is a Scotsman and he puts sugar on his porridge.\"<br />\nPerson A: \"But no <strong>true</strong> Scotsman puts sugar on his porridge.\" (from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, appealing to a higher or greater truth is not a way to dispute other views that rise from within the same group being discussed or debated, because what right do you have to claim the truth for yourself? (I hope I defined it properly).</p>\n<p>With regards to Judaism, there are several different sects and denominations, and within these there are sub-groups as well, all with differing views on halacha, kabbalah, interpreting the Torah, hashkafah, and so forth. It's not uncommon that when speaking to a non-Jewish party about your Jewish beliefs that they'll ask: \"Well, so and so, who's from a different Jewish group, believes X, while you believe Y. How do you know that you're right and he's wrong?\" In such a case, answering: \"So and so doesn't believe in <strong>True</strong> Judaism™\" doesn't work, because who are you to say what \"True Judaism\" is?</p>\n<p>Therefore, I was wondering whether within Orthodoxy there is a way around this fallacy, or should we simply say: Have emunah, wait for the Mashiach (or work to bring him) and in the end the world will know the truth? True, in some cases it's possible to simply point out internal contradictions within other groups, but the same case can be made against Orthodoxy, as well as considering that this doesn't work 100% of the time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Orthodox Judaism and being a true Scotsman aren’t analogous. The latter is a cultural situation that no one can really determine. There are  no “Scotsman principles” that all Scotsman claim to follow.</p>\n<p>Conversely Orthodox Judaism  does have   boundaries that can not be crossed to be considered a member of the group. Someone who says they do not believe that the Torah was given on Har Sinai or that there was a binding  oral Torah  given with it can not claim to be an Orthodox Jew according to any definition of Orthodox Judaism accepted by any group that calls itself  Orthodox. Anyone claiming to say something that denies those beliefs can be told \"this is something an Orthodox Jew would say\" Even if the person/rabbi/group saying it claims to be Orthodox. Those are more broad examples you can narrow it down further.</p>\n<p>In the secular world this is a common concept as well. I’m reading these days   that  Trumps  lawyers (a law professor himself) trying  to advance a legal argument to Trump even after being told by fellow lawyers “You can argue that in a law school classroom but no judge would accept it” borders on the crime of the century . Along with plenty of other sanctions and possible disbarment for other lawyers of his who didn't break any laws but are accused of advancing lawsuits when they \"had no reasonable basis to believe the lawsuits filed were not frivolous\". Is that the Scotsmans fallacy or l'havdil like saying \"there is no basis in Halacha to say such a thing\" , \"you can't rely on Rabbi X because he says things that have no basis in halacha\" etc.?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a totally different question from the \"no true Scotsman\" fallacy. That fallacy is a way for members of a group to disassociate themselves from other members of a group who claim to be acting on the group's behalf. For example, when religious extremists (of any religion) perform violence in the name of their religion, it's a fallacy for other members of the religion to say, \"Those people aren't real members of my religion.\" Traditional Judaism in particular is very unlikely to fall into this fallacy because we tend to believe that there are objective, measurable, and well-known criteria for being considered Jewish.</p>\n<p>The scenario you're describing is totally different. Here, there are two people making conflicting assertions about what \"Judaism\" believes. The real answer to \"How do you know that you're right and he's wrong?\" is simply, \"This is what <em>I</em> believe\". Who is correct and who is wrong is unverifiable.</p>\n\n\n",

Here is a picture I found online, I can't vouch for the colors or anything else on the website but it shows you the correct order the spheres. <a href=\"https://www.learnreligions.com/thmb/9nKbFQO91ttReQHKDml-jAcudck=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kabbalah-tree-of-life-names-56a000e03df78cafda9f8e73.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.learnreligions.com/thmb/9nKbFQO91ttReQHKDml-jAcudck=/768x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/Kabbalah-tree-of-life-names-56a000e03df78cafda9f8e73.jpg</a>. If someone knows a better graphic that is available to post online, I will edit it. Malchut is a feminine (receiving) aspect at the bottom.  Malchut is like a mirror because it has no emanating light of its own, but receives and reflects. See:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On one hand, malchut receives all that it has from the other sefirot\nand is described in Kabbala as \"having nothing of her own\"; thus, the\nZohar compares malchut to the moon which has no light of her own\". <em>Source: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380807/jewish/Malchut.htm.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380807/jewish/Malchut.htm.</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now quoting from the teachings of the Holy Ari:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>G‑d made the two great luminaries - the greater light to rule the day,\nand the smaller light to rule the night. (Gen. 1:16) The sun and the\nmoon are first called \"the two great luminaries,\" implying that they\nwere originally the same size [i.e. they were both equally \"great\"].\nBut, the Sages tell us that the moon immediately protested over having\nto rule jointly with the sun, so G‑d diminished it, leaving \"a greater\nlight to rule the day, and a smaller light to rule the night.\"</p>\n<p>Obviously, the Sages do not mean to tell us that the moon was petty or\njealous in the conventional sense. Rather, what we are witnessing here\nis part of the process through which G‑d established the duality in\nCreation between male/female (or giver/recipient). He intended from\nthe outset that there be a greater and a smaller luminary, <strong>one\nradiating and one reflective.</strong> <em>Source: from Sefer HaLikutim, parashat\nYitro, translated > and adapted by Moshe-Yaakov Wisnefsk, subsequently\npublished in \"Apples From the Orchard, link here\n<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/378724/jewish/Meditation-Prayer.htm:\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/378724/jewish/Meditation-Prayer.htm:</a></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It receives all its light from \"above\" it, and then reflects it, similar to how a woman receives seed from a man. If you think of Hashem like a Projectionist shining light from a projector, then the screen that reflects the light is like a mirror. The physical realm of Malchut is only a reflection of the upper spiritual worlds. \"As above, so below.\"</p>\n<p>The moon also has two \"sides\" from our vantage point, one we can see from earth and one we can't. According to Shaar HaPesukim (Translated and adapted by Moshe-Yaakov Wisnefsky from, subsequently published in \"Apples From the Orchard\"), Jacob's two wives represented the revealed world and the hidden world. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380173/jewish/Two-Names-Two-Wives.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380173/jewish/Two-Names-Two-Wives.htm</a>. That chapter does not make the connection to the two sides of the moon, but I've read it elsewhere. If someone can add a source for this in the comments, as well as Yesod in the sense of the \"astral plane\" discussed in a later paragraph, as well as clarify about Malchut having no light of her own, that would be great, the latter especially seeing as <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/379716/jewish/The-Many-Moons-of-Joseph.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/379716/jewish/The-Many-Moons-of-Joseph.htm</a> says \"malchut [is] the source of the souls of the Jewish people\", which could confuse the matter, although the souls still come from the core of Hashem originally, so not necessarily, and souls are sometimes likened to light but also sometimes distinctions are made, and different Kabbalists define terms differently. I also recall reading elsewhere (can't recall) that the source of Jewish souls is Tipheret, and others still have said Keter, so that could use clarification. My understanding is the Jewish souls originated from the highest aspect before it fell to the lowest, represented here as Malchut, but remembering the specific sources is difficult for me because of my bad memory.</p>\n<p>It's crucial to note are many different Kabbalistic variations within Jewish Kabbalah, and terminology that is 100% correct in one system represents the concepts only vaguely, and with certain contradictions, in other systems. a Now quoting from Shaar HaPesukim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is therefore written, \"And Jacob loved Rachel\", the latter being\nalso termed \"the Revealed World\", as is known. For the revelation of\nlights is from [Zeir Anpin's] chest down, for it is there that yesod\nof Imma ends. Leah's stature, in contrast, is from the chest [of Zeir\nAnpin]up, for there the lights are covered. She is therefore termed\n\"the Hidden World\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The moon is also grey color, and silver is used in mirrors.</p>\n<p>Lastly, a level of interpretation about Yesod, since the moon can correspond to Yesod also. Depending where on the scale from \"macro\" to \"micro\", universal to individual, you can talk about various aspects of the spheres, although all are different levels of the same concept. For example, on a macro level, Yesod corresponds to the world of Yetzirah, the world of the angels (although not all angels). But it corresponds to the tzaddik, and the covenant of circumcision. However in terms of a person's being and consciousness, it can also be representative of... I'm not sure the best word, but a mental plane, an astral plane... people use many different terms in english, some more accurate than others I'm sure. So when Rabbi Nachman says the moon is like a mirror reflecting people's own vanities, he could be referring to the moon as representing the mental/astral plane reflecting back people's thoughts, in this case their vain thoughts, or vain aspects of the aspects of their consciousness/spirit that correspond to Yesod and Yetzirah specifically. He could mean that they are seeing a mental projection of that aspect of themselves reflected back to them from the moon.</p>\n<p>I hope this is helpful. I don't know if this was Rabbi Nachman's meaning of the moon being a mirror or not, but I've come across the concept of the moon being a mirror many times, and always in reference to the concepts here. It could mean something else also, but hopefully this gets you started. Edit. And a warm welcome to the site! Just saw this is your first post.</p>\n\n\n",

But then how can it be that many Jewish sages destined non-Jews for \"hell\"? I picked out a few examples for you:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Sifre Deut. 311): When the Most High gave to the nations their\ninheritance  […He set the borders of the people according to the\nnumber of the children of Israel] (Deut 32:8): When God gave the\npeoples their inheritances, He made Gehinnom their portion … Should\nyou ask, who will possess their wealth and honor?

Rab. 11:2  Also in the time to come, God will cast the nations\nof the world into Gehinnom instead of Israel, as it says: For I am the\nLord your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior; I have given Egypt\nas your ransom Ethiopia and Seba for you  (Isa 43:3).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like God hates Gentiles.</p>\n<p>also, God says: “For I the Lord do not change;...\" Malachi 3:6</p>\n<p>I know Rambam wrote that everyone who keeps the 7 mitzvahs has a share in the world to come. But you never read anything about it, only since Rambam. How did Rambam get the 7 mitzvahs even though God says he doesn't change? How, then, should a non-Jew trust Hashem?</p>\n<p>When I read something like that, I'm afraid that God will damn me forever just because I'm not a Jew. sounds very unfair.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It seems to me that you have an odd amount of facts. And by that I mean, your information seems to be scattered bits of disjointed facts that don't fit together. Judaism like most religions is best learned holistically, which is defined as: \"the idea that things should be studied as a whole and not just as a sum of their parts. An example of holistic is health care that focuses on the health of the entire body and mind and not just parts of the body.\"\nSource:<a href=\"https://www.yourdictionary.com/holistic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.yourdictionary.com/holistic</a></p>\n<p>Your post has a lot of individual sources, but they seem to be lacking any cohesion that puts those sources together. Because of this, it seems like certain conclusions or questions that you have come to only exist because you haven't learned a holistic approach to Judaism.</p>\n<p>Your first line</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is said that Hashem is the god of ALL people. But then how can it\nbe that many Jewish sages destined non-Jews for \"hell\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is just confusing to me and many other Jews.</p>\n<p>An academic scholarly Jew would inform you that the Hebrew Bible doesn't really have a concept of hell and that Gehinnom is a Greek word. This illustrates that hell is not a core Judaic value but is a later development that takes hold in post Biblical Judaism. So some scholarly Jews are not convinced that hell is truly a Jewish idea but rather one that developed in the Babylonian exile or under Greek/Seleucid influence.</p>\n<p>Many Jews who would identify as religious might take offense to your idea that a Jewish sage could \"destine\" anyone to hell. Many spiritually affiliated Jews would not agree with the idea that any Rabbi could send or determine who goes to hell. Only God has the power and the right to decide such things.</p>\n<p>Your post further states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like God hates Gentiles.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But I can certainly tell you every Jew I know would take offense to your idea that God would hate gentiles. Most Jews learn about Judaism in a more holistic way, and so we understand with absolute clarity that God loves gentiles. According to the Bible we are like God's firstborn son, but that doesn't mean in any shape or form that God doesn't love the rest of His children. Our being the firstborn is only because of the covenant we entered into with God, which came with a lot of costs. In contrast, God only asks the 7 Noahide commandments of His other children, whereas he expects us, His firstborn, to keep <em>hundreds</em> of commandments. God so loves His other children that their path to the life to come is much easier than ours. Whereas His expectations of us are so much more demanding, because we are like the firstborn, and because we agreed to do all the extra things He asked of us.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know Rambam said that everyone who keeps the 7 mitzvahs has a share\nin the world to come. But you never read anything about it, only since\nrambam.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an example of you having disjointed facts. The 7 Noahide laws is Talmudic in origin, based on very close interpretations of the Tanakh, which is why Rambam mentions them. The idea that Noahides have a share in the world to come is also Talmudic in origin, but like many things in the Talmud, only through a close analysis of the text do you understand this is what they're saying.</p>\n<p>Joseph Albo, a Sephardic sage of the 15th century posits the afterlife to any pious gentile as being Talmudic in origin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For this reason you will find that the Noachian and the Mosaic laws, though differing in matters of detail, as we shall see, agree in the general matters which come from the giver. They both existed at the same time. While the Mosaic law existed in Israel, all the other nations had the Noachian law, and the difference was due to geographical diversity, Palestine (i.e. \"Eretz Israel\") being different from the other lands, and to national diversity, due to difference in ancestry. And there is no doubt that the other nations attained human happiness through the Noachian law, since it is divine; though they could not reach the same degree of happiness as that attained by Israel through the Torah. The Rabbis say: \"The pious men of the other nations have a share in the world to come\". This shows that there may be two divine laws existing at the same time among different nations, and that each one leads those who live by it to attain human happiness; though there is a difference in the degree of happiness attainable by the two laws. This difference in the laws can not concern fundamental or derivative principles. Therefore the examination of the law itself is always of the same kind. But the examination relating to the messenger may undergo change. At all events the verification must be direct, though the verification of one religion may be different from that of another. The question whether a given divine law may change for the same people in the same land, we shall examine in the Third Book...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source:<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah#Rabbinical_views\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Laws_of_Noah#Rabbinical_views</a></p>\n<p>I believe Rabbi Albo comes to this impression from the following Talmudic debate</p>\n<p>Sanhedrin 105a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehoshua, as it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Eliezer says: It is written: “The wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld, all that nations that forget God” (Psalms 9:18). “The wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld”; these are the sinners of the Jewish people, as only the sinners are sentenced to the netherworld. “All the gentiles that forget God”; these are the sinners of the gentiles. From the fact that it is written: “All the gentiles,” it is apparent that none of the gentiles have a share in the World-to-Come. This is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. Rabbi Yehoshua said to him: But is it stated in the verse that the sinners of the Jewish people will be like all of the gentiles? It is stated only: “All the gentiles that forget God.” Rather, the wicked shall be turned back to the netherworld, and who are they? They are all the gentiles that forget God. <em><strong>Gentiles who fear God do have a share in the World-to-Come.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.105a.11?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.105a.11?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>As you can see, the Talmud is a collection of debate and arguments. If you were only to pick out one verse from this paragraph you might pick out: \"it is apparent that none of the gentiles have a share in the World-to-Come.\" But doing so is incorrect. Because the entire argument was done to reach the final conclusion: \"<em><strong>Gentiles who fear God do have a share in the World-to-Come.</strong></em> \"</p>\n<p>Since you were unaware that the idea of Gentiles going to world to come is Talmudic, highlights how disjointed your facts are. When you learn Judaism with an intellectually honest teacher they should strive to teach you the source of everything you learn so you would never err and think Rambam made up the idea that Gentiles go to the world to come. A teacher who shows you all the sources will fill in the needed context, and such context would make it hard to fathom the idea of God hating gentiles. Especially when you consider the following.</p>\n<p>Out of the 3 major Abrahamic faiths, Judaism is the only one that allows non-believers into the afterlife. Most Christian communities believe only Christians make it to the afterlife, same for Muslims. And not only does Judaism allow non Jewish believers into the afterlife, based on the numbers there will be more gentiles in the afterlife than Jews. What Christian thinks there will be more non Christians than Christians in heaven? What Muslim believes that?</p>\n<p>I think you should take a moment and go back to square one. Find yourself an intellectually honest teacher of Judaism. If you find such a teacher, then one day you will understand why your post and questions remind me of this proverb:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A single coin in an empty chest makes a loud and useless noise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because you will understand that disjointed facts can be like individual golden coins. Each coin is true and valuable, but if you only have a few such coins in a large empty chest then the sounds they make are loud and useless. But once you have more context facts that connect the other facts together then your chest becomes full.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "PTIJ: Did Yaakov wear a shtreimel or not?",
    "content": "# PTIJ: Did Yaakov wear a shtreimel or not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There is a well-known midrash that says (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: How do we know that Yaakov wore a shtreimel?<br />\nA: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.28.10?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">It says</a>: \"And Yaakov left Be'er Sheva\". What, he left without a shtreimel?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, an ancient manuscript of the midrash (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/12bUFET8mWuI11UD9IWVVfsf9OZw0neAr/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MS Hamanovich 82</a>) contains this version (my summary and translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Q: How do we know that Yaakov wore a kippah?<br />\nA: It says: \"And Yaakov left Be'er Sheva\". What, he left without a kippah?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that both cannot be correct. The contradiction cannot simply be explained by saying that under the shtreimel he had a kippah, because how are we to know if he had a kippah under the shtreimel if all we see is the shtreimel? On the other hand, MS Hamanovich utterly ignores the existence of the shtreimel and focuses on the kippah. In terms of the issue of walking around bare-headed, all that is necessary is some form of head-covering. That MS seems to focus on whether or not he had any sort of head-covering at all, and comes to answer that.</p>\n<p>So, therefore, my question is: In light of MS Hamanovich 82, is there any way to know whether or not Yaakov had a shtreimel?</p>\n<hr />\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/797/\">Purim Torah policy</a>.</h1>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The original Midrash is problematic. A streimel is only worn on Shabbos and Yackov would not have travelled on Shabbos. Furthermore, since Yackov was bachur at the time, he would not have had a streimel since the father-in-law is the one that pays for it. Additionally, since he was going to a Yeshiva dorm he was probably wearing a black hat like all Bachurim.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I think that the first midrash has a taus hadafus. It should be on the passuk where Lavan made a big seuda for the wedding, and the answer is “what, he went to the wedding without a streimel?” Once we have this, the answer is simple. The kippa is proven from his leaving Canaan and the streimel is proven from the wedding!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The truth is, that the chassidim forged the Midrash. It originally said How do we know Yakov wore a Black Hat. In matter of fact the contradiction you brought, even proves it was a forgery. Because you wouldn't be able to see his kippa under his striemel. But if you learn he was really wearing a black hat, he could've worn his kippa like some of those yeshivishe fellows that the kippa sticks out from the back.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>He definitely owned some form of head covering. Owing to the fact that his grandfather invented Shacharis - he was already well versed in his daily avoda. And as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.46.1?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe=Maginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 46:1</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשמשים כובע או מצנפת בראשו יברך עוטר ישראל בתפארה</p>\n<p>When he places a hat or turban on his head, he blesses \"Who crowns Israel with glory.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.46.1?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe=Maginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.46.9&ven2=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe2=eu5_text&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah</a> makes it clear that a hat is likewise a form of tznius - modesty, and we know that Yaakov was indeed a very modest person, always conducting himself with a modicum of respect and restraint. We know that he told the shevatim off for making themselves conspicuous (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.1?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 42:1</a>) - so it stands to reason that such a modest individual would indeed own some type of hat.</p>\n\n\n",

Exodus 3:8:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,\nand to bring them up out of that land unto <strong>a good land and a large,\nunto a land flowing with milk and honey</strong>; unto the place of the\nCanaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and\nthe Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yet despite this assurance, the spies were instructed by Moses to assess whether the Land was good. Numbers 13:17-20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto them:\n'Get you up here into the South, and go up into the mountains;and see\nthe land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein, whether\nthey are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;  <strong>and what the\nland is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad</strong>; and what\ncities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in\nstrongholds; and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether\nthere is wood therein, or not.

The Sforno explains that they needed to find out if the ecological conditions, but also the climate in which the people lived favoured successful.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואת העם היושב עליה, to find out if the ecological conditions favoured successful settlement in cities. In other words, if sick people would be referred by their physicians to such cities and to such a climate to help them regain their health. They would judge this by the appearance of the inhabitants of such cities; if they appeared healthy, strong, of good posture, etc. They would also observe if the people were numerous, had large families, or if somehow they were few in numbers. Large numbers of people, and people looking strong and fit, would indicate that the climate was good and favoured large-scale settlement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Numbers.13.18.1?ven=Or_Hachayim,_trans._Eliyahu_Munk&vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Or HaChaim explains</a> that when Moshe Rabbeinu instructed the spies to \"see the country\", they needed to see if the nature of the people, e.g. their health or strenght reflected the land they lived in, e.g. Eretz Yisrael:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וראיתם את הארץ מה היא, \"and you will observe the nature of the land.\" This was a reference to the climate of the land, the topography of the land such as whether it had many natural sources of water, and if such sources of water were pure or contaminated, etc. Moses referred to those aspects of the land which anyone traversing it can determine with ease. When he told the spies to evaluate the people, i.e. ואת העם היושב עליה, he asked them to evaluate if the nature of the people, their health, their strength, etc. reflected that the land they lived on had contributed to these people's being healthy, etc. Moses suggested that the health of its inhabitants was proof of the goodness of the land these people dwelled on. Seeing that it could be argued that if the people were extremely robust this might be due to such factors as healthy living habits, in particular not overindulging in sex, he asked the spies to find out if the people were numerous or relatively few in numbers. If the people were numerous this too would be testimony to the topographical and climatic conditions being favourable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it would seem that the reason the spies were instructed to observe the people and the country, was due to the fact that the Torah mentions Eretz Yisrael as \" a good land and a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey\". Since the country was good, the people surely needed to be on that same level, since they lived in it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Human Validation of [Shemot 3:8] is requested by HaShem (not Moshe) in [Numbers 13:2] | HaShem's request for scouts \"to-explore\" (לָתוּר) the promised land for the Bnei Yisrael is obediently fulfilled by Moshe in [Bamidbar 13:3] \"Moshe sent them\" (יִּשְׁלַח אֹתָם משֶׁה) \"by-[the]-Mouth of YHVH\" (עַל־פִּי יְהֹוָה).</p>\n<p>Trusted witnesses כָּלֵב Kalev & הוֹשֵׁעַ Hoshea would confirm to Bnei Yisrael the validity of the promise from the Mal'ak in [Shemot 3:8] to strengthen the credibility of Moshe's claims regarding HaShem.</p>\n<p>Sadly without instruction from HaShem, Moshe demonstrates favoritism in [Bamidbar 13:16] by blessing only Hoshea's safety in Canaan (through the title Yehoshua) causing possible bias in 1 testimony of HaShem's 12 scouts.</p>\n\n\n",

HaGR\"A) as reported in She'arim Mesuyanim (p.270) suggested that Sanheriv's sons brought the plank of wood with them to Ararat, thus furnishing the opportunity for Parshandatha to obtain it when he was the governor there.</p>\n<p>The Targum Sheni 9:24 contends that despite the biblical injunction against leaving a body hanging over night (Deut. 21:23), Esther maintained (by reference to the hanging of Saul’s sons as precedent) it was appropriate to leave the bodies of Haman and his sons up on the gallows not just for six months, but forever:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מטול דהמן בר המדתא אגגיא מעיקיהון דיהודאי חשיב על יהודאי למגרמא יתהון\nצבע פיסא רמא ערבא וסבתמא לכל עדבא למגרמא יתהון ולמשיצאה יתהון. וכד חזו\nלהמן ולבנוי דצליבן על צליבא יומין סגיאין אמרין למה אסתר עברה על מה\nדכתיב לא תבית נבילתיה על צליבא ענת אסתר ואמרת להון על דקטל שאול מלכא\nלגיורא דגבעונאי הוון בנוי צליבין על צליבא מן שירוי דחצדא דשערין עד\nיומא דנחת מיטרא דהוון שיתא ירחין. וכד הוון דבית ישראל סלקין נתחזון\nבבית מקדשא הוון עממיא אמרין להון למה אילין צליבן ענו דבית ישראל ואמרין\nלהון על דפשט אבוהון ידיה בגיורי דגבעונאי וקטל יתהון. המן רשיעא דבעא\nלשיציא לדבית ישראל על אחת כמה וכמה יהוי הוא ובנוי צליבן על צליבא כל\nיומי עלמא.</p>\n<p>When the royal scribes of Haman saw him and his sons hanging many days\non the gallows, they asked: \"Why does Esther transgress what is\nwritten in the law, ‘Thou shalt not let his body remain all night upon\nthe tree’? Esther answered them: \"Because King Saul had killed the\nproselytes of the Gibeonites, his sons hung upon the gallows from the\nbeginning of barley harvest until the day when rain came down upon\nthem, which lasted six months; and when the Israelites came up to\nappear before the temple, the nations asked them: 'Why do these hang?'\nThe Israelites answered them: 'Because their father has laid his hand\nupon the proselytes of the Gibeonites and killed them.' How much more\ndoes the wicked Haman and his sons, who wanted to destroy all Israel,\ndeserve to hang on the gallows — FOREVER!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, it may be presumed that the gallows stood at least as long as Esther reigned. Furthermore, its use as such may be argued was a perpetuation of the original function for which the wood served. She'arim Mesuyanim (p.270):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יוצא לן מחלוקת האם הזכר עשה לנפלאותיו הוא לזכור הצלת העולם חסדו של\nהקב\"ה או לזכור גבורת השי\"ת שהשחית את העולם ונ\"מ בזה מה שנתלה המן על עץ\nזה. דאם העץ הוא זכר לגבורות השי\"ת במבול שהשחית את הרשעים מסתברא שהמן\nג\"כ נתלה בשביל רשעתה משא\"כ אם הוא זכר לחסדי השי\"ת במבול א\"כ גם תליית\nהמן הוא המשך לנפלאות השי\"ת שהציל את העולם מן המבול וגם הציל בו את\nישראל מגזירת המן</p>\n<p>What emerges from the debate is whether the “remembrance of His\nwonders” is a remembrance of the loving-kindness (hesed) of God [in\nHis abating of the flood], or as a remembrance of the strength\n(gevurah) of God when he destroyed the world. This distinction also\ndetermines how we see the hanging of Haman upon the wood. For if the\nwood was a remembrance of the might (gevurah) of God who destroyed the\nwicked with the flood, it is evident that Haman similarly was hanged\nbecause of his wickedness - which is not the case if it was a\nremembrance of the loving-kindness (hesed) of God. However, if the\nlatter [i.e. that it is a remembrance of the loving-kindness of God]\nis in fact so, then we see that hanging of Haman is also a\ncontinuation of “His wonders” for just as He saved humanity from the\nflood so too did He save the Jewish nation from Haman’s decree.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And while we may not know what happened to the gallows consequent to Esther's reign, it would seem that according to some sources the remainder of the ark continued to serve as a memorial in its original location. Josephus (<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link2HCH0003\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Antiquities of the Jews, Book 1, ch. 3</a>) reported:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the Armenians call this place, 'The Place of Descent'; for the ark\nbeing saved in that place, its remains are shown there by the\ninhabitants to this day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Much of what was already mentioned in the previous answers is also mentioned in The Targum Simcha on Tu B'Shvat.</p>\n<p>The Targum Simcha seems to say that Parshandasa having lived in the region where the rememnets of the ark had laid in ruins, was able to retrieve a beam from the wreckage which his father Haman later intended to use for Mordechai.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4lcGP.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4lcGP.jpg\" alt=\"The Targum Simcha Tu B'Shvat\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mishne Torah Kings and Wars Ch.6\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Hi I am posting my question again because the old post is closed, but I edited my question to avoid problems:</p>\n<p>Mishne Torah,Kings and Wars Ch. 6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"War is not conducted against anyone in the world until they are first offered peace (and refuse it), whether this is a Discretionary War or a War of Mitzvoh, as it says, “when you come close to the city to fight with it, you shall call to it to make peace” (Deut. 20:10). If they make peace and accept the Seven Commandments incumbent upon the Sons of Noah (Gentiles), none of them are killed, but they must pay us tribute, as it says, “and they shall be for you a tributary, and they shall serve you” (Deut. 20:11). If they propose to accept upon themselves the payment of the tribute but not servitude to us or they accept servitude but not the tribute, we ignore their proposal until they accept both. The servitude referred to here is one of disgrace and is demeaning. They are not to raise their heads up to Israel for any reason. They must be subjugated to us and may never be assigned to a Position over us. The tribute they must pay shall be for service of the king, with their bodies and their money, such as the building of the walls and the strengthening of fortresses and the building of the royal palace and similar, as it says, “And this is the account of the levy which King Solomon raised to build the Temple of G-d, and his palace, and Milo, and the wall of Jerusalem…and all the store-cities which Solomon had…the Emorites who remained…and Solomon imposed a head-tax, until this very day. And of the Children of Israel, Solomon made none a bondsman; but they were the soldiers and his servants and his officers and his captains and those in charge of his chariots and his horsemen” (I Kings 9:15-22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why were only the countries mentioned slaves?(the Emorites for example) I don't know what God's thoughts are about the slaves (non-Jewish), but it just seems to me as if he is not interested in these people (slaves)...Is there any source in the torah that does say that a slave was pleasing to God in his eyes (I mean not a slave of God but a slave of a man)? and when I think of the messianic kingdom, the gentiles will probably become slaves as well, BECAUSE, when the Messiah comes, all Non-Jews accept the 7 Mitzwot. and You see in Mishne Toorah Kings and Laws ch. 6 what happens...or am I wrong? But what is that for peace? I don't know but for me the servitude and the tribute don't sound like peace. I'm trying to understand it but I just can't understand it.</p>\n\n\n",

But if you never plan on eating the mezonos, there might not be a reason to cover it. The gingerbread man ain't planning on eating himself, so he wouldn't have to cover himself during kiddush.\nHowever you can cler that he should need to cover himself because he's naked and you can't say a bracha in front of erva. It could be that his skin isn't considered an erva.

Then, something odd struck me: the first letter of the <em>third</em> word in each sentence of that prayer also was larger than the others, and bolded, though not alphabetical from line to line.

The Avatar Spirit is only reborn when the previous Avatar dies. So that means that the next Avatar after Avraham wasn't even someone from the Avot or their children (for Yaakov and Esav weren't yet married at the time) - it was an unknown person who was born when Avraham died. It is possible that Moshe was also an Avatar, but since we don't really know who was in-between or how many Avatars there were, it would be difficult to make any assumptions on problems with the cycle of the elements between Avraham and Moshe.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> In fact, unless we say that Avraham was the first Avatar, it is difficult to see how he was an Avatar at all, considering he lived to see Noach and Noach's children.

    "content": "# What are some criteria that would allow a spouse to file for divorce in secular court?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Halachically, from my understanding, a spouse cannot file for divorce in a secular court without permission from Bais Din.</p>\n<p>Are there any specific reasons spelled out, besides explicit permission from Bais Din, where such a thing would be permitted?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are two things going on here -- the religious divorce (or <em>Gett</em>), and then how they'd choose to split their property.</p>\n<p>Let's deal with the latter one, as it's actually more straightforward. As far as <em>halacha</em> is concerned, it's no different than two partners who are dissolving a joint business and trying to figure out how to split everything up. For them to go to secular courts when they could have gone to Jewish courts is prohibited. <em>However</em>, if they choose to settle on their own -- or go to mediation, and even arbitration -- that's fine. (The point is they're not using a non-Torah system that can force people against their will.)</p>\n<p>Alternatively, if the defendant refuses to use a beis din, refuses to use a beis din deemed acceptable to the plaintiff's beis din, or poses a situation whereby the beis din fears for their own safety, then the plaintiff's beis din can authorize the plaintiff to instead go to courts.</p>\n<p>Here's the very last section of Maimonides' Laws of Sanhedrin (high courts):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַדָּן בְּדַיָּנֵי עַכּוּ''ם וּבְעַרְכָּאוֹת שֶׁלָּהֶן אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהָיוּ דִּינֵיהֶם כְּדִינֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל הֲרֵי זֶה רָשָׁע וּכְאִלּוּ חֵרֵף וְגִדֵּף וְהֵרִים יָד בְּתוֹרַת משֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (שמות כא א) \"וְאֵלֶּה הַמִּשְׁפָּטִים אֲשֶׁר תָּשִׂים לִפְנֵיהֶם\" לִפְנֵיהֶם וְלֹא לִפְנֵי עַכּוּ''ם לִפְנֵיהֶם וְלֹא לִפְנֵי הֶדְיוֹטוֹת. הָיְתָה יַד הָעַכּוּ''ם תַּקִּיפָה וּבַעַל דִּינוֹ אַלָּם וְאֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לְהוֹצִיא מִמֶּנּוּ בְּדַיָּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל יִתְבָּעֶנּוּ לְדַיָּנֵי יִשְׂרָאֵל תְּחִלָּה. אִם לֹא רָצָה לָבוֹא נוֹטֵל רְשׁוּת מִבֵּית דִּין וּמַצִּיל בְּדַיָּנֵי עַכּוּ''ם מִיַּד בַּעַל דִּינוֹ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One who seeks justice through the gentiles' courts, even if their laws were the same as those of the Jews, is wicked, and as if he cursed out the name of God and raised his hand against the Torah of Moses our Teacher. Exodus 21:1 says <em>these are the civil laws you shall place before THEM [the Jews]</em>, implying not the non-Jews. If the non-Jews have power and the defendant is strong and claiming through the Jewish judges will not succeed, then he should first summon him through the Jewish system; if the defendant refuses to come before the Jewish courts, then the plaintiff obtains permission from the Bais Din, and obtains what is his through the non-Jewish courts.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Practically today in the USA, rabbis advise to first handle the Gett when it's clear the marriage is over, and then figure out the rest of the settlement. After handling the Gett, they will say -- <em>halacha says you should not go to court to handle the civil dispute, but we can't force you to use us. We can handle this in a manner that's faster, quieter and cheaper, would you like us to do so? If not, have a nice day.</em> However if a couple first battled it out in court and then went to the Beis Din for a Gett, they will handle the Gett and not stick their noses into the civil dispute.</p>\n<p>As above -- there's no prohibition to settle out-of-court, or agree to any form of mediation or even arbitration. Another exception: the Gemara says if one party insists on going to court and refuses to use Beis Din, then you meet them there -- even if halfway through they get nervous and offer to settle.</p>\n<p>But generally the conversation is supposed to start at the Beis Din, who will authorize going to court when called for. Rabbi Yonah Reiss of the Beth Din of America tells of a case involving settling some inheritance (sure, no problem) where he quickly realized the deceased was likely killed by a Mexican cartel. <em>This was not a job for the Beth Din of America, this is a job for the NYPD or FBI!</em> In the US, the Beis Din functions legally as an arbitration panel -- generally speaking, anything that requires power they don't legally have (e.g. a restraining order, anything criminal at all), they will authorize people to go to courts. But it's supposed to start with the Beis Din giving that authorization.</p>\n<p>As above -- there can be disputes as to what's called a proper Beis Din. In one case the plaintiff said \"you pick a rabbi, I pick a rabbi, the two of them pick a third.\" (That's a time-honored suggestion if they can't agree on which Beis Din to use.) The defendant insisted on a rabbi who also worked as a professional Beis Din litigator on the side. The plaintiff's Beis Din found that unacceptable -- there's at least the appearance of conflict-of-interest -- and when the defendant refused to produce any other names, the plaintiff's Beis Din authorized him to go sue in court.</p>\n<p>Again: it starts with a conversation with the rabbis. Unless people want to settle, or there's a violent crime happening right now. (Someone breaks into your house with a gun, you call the police, not the rabbis.)</p>\n<p>That's just about money. Or even childcare arrangements.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As for the halachic status -- there is nothing a secular court can declare that can turn a halachically-married woman into a single one. Either she needs a halachic Gett, or in very rare cases rabbis may determine that the entire marriage was under massively false pretenses and thus void from the get-go. (Or even easier, if you can show the husband wasn't Jewish.)</p>\n<p>There are complex cases about involving the secular courts to compel the defendant to go through the halachic process, but those also have to start with a conversation with the rabbis. As seen below, this is because if non-Jews force him when halacha wouldn't necessarily call for it, the Gett is ruined. (Practically, state courts in the US don't want to get into questions of religious law, so they will just ask \"Are the rabbis satisfied? We just need a thumbs-up, thumbs-down.\") This does get very complicated; for instance in the State of New York, to obtain a civil divorce you have to sign an affidavit that you've already removed all ethical obstacles from the other person remarrying -- which means giving a Gett. (The argument is that it's not \"compulsion\" unless you're taking something away from someone. Here, the state refuses to grant a new civil divorce until/unless it's done. Even this law is frowned-upon by some serious rabbis.)</p>\n<p>The problem is described at the end of Maimonides' Chapter Two of Laws of Divorce:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. וְכֵן אִם הִכּוּהוּ עַכּוּ''ם וְאָמְרוּ לוֹ עֲשֵׂה מַה\nשֶּׁיִּשְׂרָאֵל אוֹמְרִין לְךָ וְלָחֲצוּ אוֹתוֹ יִשְׂרָאֵל בְּיַד\nהָעַכּוּ''ם עַד שֶׁיְּגָרֵשׁ הֲרֵי זֶה כָּשֵׁר. וְאִם הָעַכּוּ''ם\nמֵעַצְמָן אֲנָסוּהוּ עַד שֶׁכָּתַב הוֹאִיל וְהַדִּין נוֹתֵן\nשֶׁיִּכְתֹּב הֲרֵי זֶה גֵּט פָּסוּל. ...   לֹא הָיָה הַדִּין נוֹתֵן שֶׁכּוֹפִין\nאוֹתוֹ לְגָרֵשׁ וְטָעוּ בֵּית דִּין שֶׁל יִשְׂרָאֵל אוֹ שֶׁהָיוּ\nהֶדְיוֹטוֹת וַאֲנָסוּהוּ עַד שֶׁגֵּרֵשׁ הֲרֵי זֶה גֵּט פָּסוּל הוֹאִיל\nוְיִשְׂרָאֵל אֲנָסוּהוּ יִגְמֹר וִיגָרֵשׁ. וְאִם הָעַכּוּ''ם,\nאֲנָסוּהוּ לְגָרֵשׁ שֶׁלֹּא כַּדִּין אֵינוֹ גֵּט.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the non-Jews hit the recalcitrant husband, saying <em>do what the Jews tell you!</em>, thus the Jews were pressing him via non-Jews until he gives the divorce, that is a valid divorce. However if the non-Jews forced him of their own volition -- if it was in a situation where <em>halacha</em> would call for [the Jews to] force him -- the Gett is flawed [at the rabbinic level]. In a situation where the law would not demand him to give a Gett: if the Beis Din was mistaken or consisted of [ignorant] laypeople and they forced him to give a Gett, the Gett is flawed ... <strong>but if non-Jews forced him in a situation where [Torah] law does not call for compulsion, the Gett is considered completely nonexistent.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly (for good measure), if either party feels that the rabbinic panel involved in the process is not a good fit, there are processes to propose a different panel.</p>\n\n\n",

It actually reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Korach is unfit for the priesthood</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is, after all, the whole resolution of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.16.1-13?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Korach episode</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe there is a nafka minah (practical difference).</p>\n<p>One who is completely bald is a no-go but a bald patch is okay.</p>\n<p>We see this from Haman - refer to the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.13b.18?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=Steinsaltz&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 13b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁמָּא תֹּאמַר, קָרְחָה אֲנִי עוֹשֶׂה בְּמַלְכוּתֶךָ — מְפוּזָּרִין הֵם בֵּין הָעַמִּים.</p>\n<p>Perhaps you will say that I am making a bald spot in your kingdom, (i.e., you fear that if an entire nation is wiped out there will be a desolate area within the kingdom.)

However, is Maharik specifically discouraging the pet name, since he uses the full name 'Eliyahu'; or does he permit taunting one with Eli-Belly, as long as he says 'Eli who is called Belly'? Furthermore, if this leniency stipulates the addition of 'who is called' as part of the pet name formation, do further taunts, such as 'Eli Belly Peanut Butter Jelly' also require this formation?</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

It seems they are not identical to one another. Is there a standardized text for official use in synagogues? Will we find exactly the same edition in all Rabbinic Judaism synagogues around the world? If so, which edition is it? If not, what are the \"acceptable\" editions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Practically, whatever's popular in mass print today for synagogue use. In the United States, figure something printed with an English translation. In Conservative synagogues, it will usually be the Jewish Publication Society translation -- you'd have to research exactly which precise Hebrew text they were using. In Orthodox synagogues, the Soncino Hertz is a bit older, Aryeh Kaplan's Living Torah is certainly acceptable but never became super-popular -- same for the older Koren translation; Artscroll's Stone edition is the 20-ton gorilla that conquered all, and recently Koren released a new one including the late Lord Sacks' translation. Koren is famous for their own research; for the others, you'd have to research precisely which Hebrew they used.</p>\n<p>To be fair, as far as what's used by the masses in the 21st Century, we are talking very, very minor differences here. (At least in the first five books, which is what you'd find in mass print in synagogues.) There's a question of literally one silent letter, and even that has increasingly congealed to \"A is the right way, footnote -- some texts had B.\" More of a question of a handful of vowels (e.g. is the mineral jasper <em>yash-peh</em>, <em>yash-feh</em>, <em>yash-fay</em>, or <em>yash-pay</em>?) and cantillation marks, and a few differences on where to split paragraphs. Only people really obsessed about these things will notice/care. (If the cantor gets up and reads <em>yash-feh</em> for \"jasper\" because that's what's what is in his edition, and someone else had <em>yash-pay</em>, they will compare books for a second, shrug, and move on. A choosy shopper buying a handwritten Scroll of Esther today might be asked -- \"do you want the paragraph splits the common way, or consistent with the Aleppo Codex?\" It would sound exactly the same when read out loud! Again, the rank and file don't really worry about this.)</p>\n<p>Purists will continue to bicker about whether Koren or Breuer reflects the \"best\" text ... again, very, very minor differences.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this correct?</p>\n<p>Can someone please explain what the Noam Elimelech tries to teach us here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And Moshe and Aharon came to the tent of meeting\" - There are many types of tzaddikim (righteous people). There is a great tzaddik named \"Moshe\", and there is a tzaddik who is of the rank of \"Aharon\" and each one according to his level/rank ascends and comes into (a state of) holiness called \"Tent of Meeting\". \"And they went out\" means that they subsequently depart a little from their level, and this is only for the sake of \"and bless the people\". Like we mentioned earlier, this still causes holiness and reverence for all the people, and this is (the meaning of) \"and fear the glory of the Lord to all the people\" and this is (the meaning of) \"Your decrees are indeed enduring etc.\". This is the Gemara that relates that three testify, this one on that one: Hashem, Israel and Shabbos. We find that Israel is called a testimony of Hashem and this is the meaning of \"Your decrees are indeed enduring\",  which can be understood that they are faithful and loving. To whom though? As the verse explains, \"Holiness befits Your house\" i.e. to those beautiful righteous people always in the higher worlds, \"O Hashem, for length of days (i.e. all times)\" - That they cause with their deeds that the sanctity and reverence by it may spread to all Israel Amen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I wanted to know if anybody has any recommendation on which mefarshim on or off the page and seforim to use.</p>\n<p>[2] And does anybody have any good shiurim to listen to? I don't want the shiurim that they have as a refresher course that are given during Shovivim.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>1] There are many excellent mefarshim and seforim on Hilchos Niddah. In terms of those that are most popular, the Chavos Da'as and Sidrei Taharah are very well-known commentaries on Shulchan Aruch, although even those learning be'iyun would probably not be able to learn all of them in order. Many would also say that Aruch Hashulchan is pretty much a \"must read\".</p>\n<p>As for more recent sefarim, there are many, many good ones. On my shelf (not that I've learned through all of them), you can find Badei Hashulchan (which is on Shulchan Aruch), Rabbi Eider's and Rabbi Soblofsky's English books (both of which are impeccably sourced and provide lomdus as well as practical rulings), and quite a few others. If you are interested in Sefardi Psak (and possibly even if you aren't), Rav Ovadia's Taharas Habayis is a must-have.</p>\n<p>2] I would recommend looking for shiurim from Semicha programs. You can find quite a few sets on YUTorah, and I also know that Rabbi Weiner's shiurim (linked <a href=\"http://nermichoel.org/index/shiur/media/both/category/halacha/subcategory/hilchos-niddah/speaker/rabbi-weiner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) are excellent.</p>\n<p>Note: I would also recommend that you speak to your Rav (or sign up for some sort of Semicha program, and speak to a Rav there) who will probably be able to guide you in these matters far better than I can, especially if you are interested in actually paskening these shailos and/or doing shimush in mar'os.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The sefer Mareh Kohen by R' Rubin from Har Nof is very good. (מראה כהן / רבי יצחק מרדכי הכהן) It's short enough to get through the whole thing but it covers many topics and has mekorot (sources) that you can look up. I am not sure where you are located but I haven't been in a shul (beit knesset) here in Eretz Yisroel where there are serious learners that doesn't have it. That seems to say something about it. Good luck.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What Rabbinic interpretations of the Garden of Eden narrative treat \"the serpent\" as more the protagonist, instead of the antagonist?",
    "content": "# What Rabbinic interpretations of the Garden of Eden narrative treat \"the serpent\" as more the protagonist, instead of the antagonist?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Most interpretations of the Garden narrative treat Adam and Even as protagonists, and the serpent as the antagonist. I am interested here in interpretations that flip some roles. As one example, I heard Rabbi Manis Friedman say that Eve actually knew Hashem wanted a dwelling in the lowest world, so when Eve ate the fruit, it was for holy reasons, and she even told Adam beforehand that Hashem wanted them to do this. Otherwise, Rabbi Friedman said Eve would have been named the Mother of death, not Mother of the living.</p>\n<p>However, he didn't give proofs, so I couldn't form an opinion. But akin to that \"counter-intuitive\" interpretation, what are also some positive interpretations about the \"serpent\" (of Bereshit 3)? For example, if the more commonly made correlations within Bereshit are man to Jacob, and the serpent to Esau, I am interested in interpretations where the serpent can instead be correlated to Jacob (or Israel), and the man to Esau. (Verse-dependent, of course). For example, in some commentaries Jacob is called a holy serpent; Jacob grabs Esau's heel (Bereshit 25:26) and the serpent bruises heels (Bereshit 3:15); Jacob is also subtle. I don't want to make the question long so I'll stop there.</p>\n<p>Edit: one comment that was deleted said the Rabbi Friedman interpretation of Eve eating for holy reasons is legitimate, based on a deeper teaching. Does anyone know the source of that teaching as well? (Since it is related, because if Eve's actions can be seen holy, and the serpent motivated her to do that action, then that is one window through which to potentially see the serpent's actions as holy also).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>First, the OP phrased its question: \"What Rabbinic interpretations of the Garden of Eden narrative treat \"the serpent\" as more the protagonist, instead of the antagonist?\"</p>\n<p>The OP's choice of words seems to say that the questioner has already made the conclusion that there must be certain interpretations; and we just need to ask who out there knows of them?</p>\n<p>A Torah scholar seeking truth should rather phrase it:</p>\n<p>Are there any interpretations of the garden etc...\"?</p>\n<p>We should ask in a way that the question shows we are willing to accept the possible fact that no Rabbis ever interpreted the story in that particular way at all.</p>\n<p>Second, if someone wishes to answer that there are no such interpretations by the Rabbis about Adam Eve and the Snake, The OP could then say: Prove It !, And no one could prove it unless they can claim photographic memory of everything every Rabbi ever said and claim the OP's interpretation is not in there.</p>\n<p>So I will respond by saying that I have attended Orthodox Jewish religious schools since I was a boy and have learned quite a lot on that chapter in Bereshis. I am a Rabbi and I am 48 years old. I have not been able to recall having ever seen or heard anything the OP is looking for about the Snake being the protagonist etc.</p>\n<p>In fact, it smacks of a completely non-Torah concept which might be applied to scholarship concerning Greek Mythology, but not the Torah of Israel.</p>\n<p>The Torah teaches moral lessons and when those are taught in a \"story\" form, it is consistent in that the characters of those stories if portrayed as good, are good... and if evil are evil. They do not switch around roles.</p>\n<p>What they could do is be made to show that the good guy is sometimes challenged by evil and the bad guy also has measures of goodness about him. IOW, sometimes characters in the Tanach are 3 dimensional and have aspects to their person that is not always 100% black and white.</p>\n<p>However, this does not mean that a protagonist will flip and become the antagonist etc.</p>\n<p>For instance:</p>\n<p>Cain killed his brother Abel. Cain is the antagonist because he is in fact a foul murderer and Abel is an innocent victim or the protagonist. Thats all. No switching or secret teachings or symbolisms etc.</p>\n<p>However, there is an opinion among the Rabbinic works (Medrash) which explains that Abel was subject to Cain's attack because Abel needlessly caused his brother to be jealous of him.</p>\n<p>But even according to this \"interpretation\", Cain is still a murderer, and still wrong, 100%. The Medrash is simply trying to present a reason why Abel might not have merited protection. Even so, he is still the righteous victim in the story. That cannot change.</p>\n<p>This type of question from the OP, is actually dangerous as well.</p>\n<p>Certain outcast groups in Jewish history thought along these lines. for instance, the Frankists (offshoot followers of Shabatai Tzvi the false Messiah active in the late 16 - 1700's etc.), held a belief that since G-d loves repentance, it is actually a good idea to sin terribly so that you can repent and please G-d.</p>\n<p>Of course that is total insanity, but it is an example of what happens when someone \"flips\" tenets of Judaism just to experiment with mysticism. It is dangerous nonesense.</p>\n<p>Torah and Judaism are not novels open to free interpretation. No one should approach it as if every opinion is valid and respected. Its not so. Only real Torah scholars with real sources may make comment and teach Torah thought. This is especially true when someone raises the banner of \"Kabbalah\" etc.</p>\n<p>Judaism and Torah thought are made to be based upon real tradition and well defined attitudes, so Jews can follow the truth without doubt and without thinking that every whim is another truth.</p>\n<p>It may sound boring but it has integrity. If we were to allow the OP its fullest conclusion, then anyone could identify with Esau or Laban or Pharoah or other evil characters in the Torah, and make them somehow the protagonist. Eventually, that person would not know right from wrong and justify their evil choices in life by saying that they follow some flipped interpretation of a Torah story.</p>\n<p>That would be a disaster. Lets keep things straight and simple... and True. :)</p>\n\n\n",

As opposed to a non jew that converts. Rabbi Yehuda Hachasid explains because he was already destined to convert. Rav Yehuda Hachasid explains that depending on the intents of the parents during relations, that controls the type of soul that comes into a body. If non jews think about repentance or other holy thoughts that can cause a jewish soul to enter the body. That soul would have a leaning towards judiasm and want to convert.</p>\n\n\n",

Noah believed in God, and presumably his sons did as well.</p>\n<p>Rambam in MT Avodat Kochavim 1:1 explains the emergence of idolatry in the generation of Enosh. However he does not mention the flood in that context. Nor does he mention the four seemingly pious couples that remained afterwards (Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives).</p>\n<p>IIRC, after the flood the sons of Noah parted in different directions. Each begot sizable descent, and eventually, we end up with Shem's line full of idol-worshipers. We are also told by the interpreters that Shem and Ever ended up in Israel learning Torah.</p>\n<p>Who reinstated idolatry and how?

They make two versions of the Gur Aryeh, one is just the plain text of the Gur Aryeh with nothing fancy, it's in two volumes (it's the one brought in @pcoz comment). They also make a five volume edition with chumash, Rashi, and Onkelos and the Gur Aryeh on the bottom. The tiferes has very nice print which is very easy to read. The two volume one (and obviously the five volume one, being that it's a normal chumash) also has the parsha, perek and pasuk on the top of each page which makes it very easy to reference.</p>\n<p>If you can manage to find them, there is also the very old printing of the sifrei Maharal (they're brownish/yellowish, thin volumes, and they all just say \"sifrei maharal\" on the spine) which if I remember correctly is also just the plain text of the Gur Aryeh. These are the \"classic\" printing of the sifrei maharal (if you see someone quoting a sefer of the Maharal with a page number (which I know the \"Mesoras HaShas\" Ein Yaakov does), it's probably this printing.)</p>\n<p>I can't say the accuracy of either of these girsa'os is <em>bad</em>, but I can say that Rabbi Hartman's edition from Mechon Yerushalayim certainly has a better one and even brings alternative girsa'os in his footnotes. It's worth mentioning that the ninth volume in Rabbi Hartman's edition (which is the thickest volume) is just a mafte'ach, and you could probably keep it not on your shelf. [Rabbi Hartman's text is the one used in Me'oros Hagedolim/Otzar Meforshei Rashi (the set of chumashim with eleven, yes eleven meforshei Rashi, it is seven volumes, highly recommended).] Another point about this edition, the footnotes are really, really good. They are not just page fillers, they help explain many of the concepts that the Maharal speaks about by bringing his explanations of the same ideas elsewhere. Rabbi Hartman is a tremendous buckey in the sifrei Maharal.</p>\n\n\n",

Obviously, that cannot mean that they had better sources or arguments, otherwise they would not have been a minority.

Even though it is written unqualified in the Torah to follow the majority [אחרי רבים להטות, in Ex 23:2], perhaps this is true specifically when they are equal to each other [in wisdom], which can be supported by the verse [ibid] \"you shall not speak in a disagreement\" [לא תענה על רִב], which is written without a yod [רִב instead of רִיב], meaning when there's wisdom, that is \"rav\" [the letters רב can be read as רַב = rav instead of רִב  = riv], do not follow the majority.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this argument is saying that Beit Shammai have greater wisdom (and for your first question: greater wisdom does not automatically imply more followers), and therefore the halacha does not follow the majority.

He says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'וימותו לפני ה, “as a result they died before the Lord.” We find a dispute recorded in the Torat Kohanim concerning the meaning of this phrase. According to Rabbi Eliezer, they died outside the Tabernacle in an area that the Levites were permitted to enter; he bases himself on the wording in verse five, in which the Torah describes how their bodies were removed from the spot where they died. The Torah describes the sons of Elitzafan, an uncle of Aaron as performing this task, with the words: ויקרבו וישאם בכתנתם אל מחוץ למחנה, ”they approached and lifted them up by their tunics and carried them out of the camp as they had been instructed to do by Moses.” If that is so, why did the Torah write that they died “before the Lord,” i.e. on sacred ground, not accessible to the Levites? This is why Rabbi Akiva disagreed and said that they had actually died inside sacred ground, and that the sons of Elitzafan had to use a long iron spear in order to pull placing that spear in their mouths and dragging their bodies to less sacred ground before they could lift them up, as they were only Levites and not priests. This presents us with a different problem, as in that event the Tabernacle itself would have become ritually impure as it formed a tent over the bodies of Nadav and Avihu, and it would have required purification rites which would last seven days. The Torah does not, however, report that the service in the Tabernacle had been interrupted for that length of time. Our author concludes that the subject needs further study. [Since the ash of the red heifer for cleansing oneself from impurity caused through contact with a dead body was not yet available, this editor does not see where the problem is.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.10.2?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashbam_on_Leviticus.10.2.2&vhe2=Rashbam_on_Leviticus_-_Daat&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashbam</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the time the heavenly fire emanated in order to consume the sacrificial meat on the altar in the courtyard of the Tabernacle, it consumed the two sons of Aaron on its way. This fire had meant to consume only the incense, but seeing that the sons of Aaron had been in its way it consumed them also and they died as a result.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And see the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.10.2?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In this instance, the heavenly fire did not stop there, but travelled beyond the boundary of the Sanctuary to the copper altar in front of the Sanctuary and consumed these two sons of Aaron there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The story goes as follow (paraphrased):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Rebbe Maharash would have personal meetings with Chassidim at night. There would be a line of people waiting to get in. One night, the secretary of the Rebbe Maharash came out and said that yechidus was paused. The Rebbe would take no more visitors for the next few hours.\nThe people waiting were confused and upset. Many had waited a long time to get in and had traveled from far away. But that was the decision. So they waited. A few hours later, the secretary came out and announced that yechidus had resumed.\nOne of the Chassidim later asked the Rebbe Maharash why yechidus had to be paused. The Rebbe related that in order for him to help another person, he needs to find that issue reflected in himself in some way. This time, a young man had come in with a story about a sin that he was doing. The sin was so unusual and extreme that the Rebbe Maharash could not find any part of himself that related to the sin. He spent many hours meditating, trying to find the internal aspect that could allow him to connect to this young man. After a few hours, he found it and was able to help him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does anyone know where this story has been originally told or where this story can be found online?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Thanks to @Menachem for posting the original <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1099/jewish/Yechidut.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> to the source for this amazing story.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A great sadness descended upon the Rebbe. Then he said: “When a chassid enters into yechidut, he reveals to me the inner maladies of his soul, each on his own level, and seeks my assistance to cure his spiritual ills. To help him, I must first find the same failing—be it in the most subtle of forms—within my own self, and strive to correct it. For it is not possible to direct someone else in cleansing and perfecting his character unless one has himself experienced the same problem and undergone the same process of self-refinement. - source: Once Upon A Chassid (Kehot, 1994)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Does God forgive freely?",
    "content": "# Does God forgive freely?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This question is based on a Christian notion I used to always hear, that every sin needs to be \"paid off\".</p>\n<p>They claimed you can pray for forgiveness for doing sin X and God will forgive of course, but sin X still incurs punishment and only after \"paying\" a part of these consequences can God's repentance \"activate\". The example they used to illustrate this idea was their claim that if God required a sin offering for unintentional sins, how much more so do we need to \"offer\" for intentional sins.</p>\n<p><strong>My questions are as follows:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>Is this view accepted in Judaism?</strong></em></li>\n<li><em><strong>Does God forgive freely?</strong></em> By freely, I mean does God forgive without requiring a person to pay up or suffer a particular consequence relating to the sin?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would like answers that touch upon the sacrificial system, middah k'neged middah, and include <em>at least one source</em> from the Tanakh.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The concept of sin in Judaism is not one in which you took something from God, e.g. Job 35.6</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִם חָטָאתָ מַה תִּפְעָל בּוֹ וְרַבּוּ פְשָׁעֶיךָ מַה תַּעֲשֶׂה לּוֹ.</p>\n<p>If you sinned, what effect did you have on God? And if you acted\nblatantly, what have you done to Him?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Subsequently, the classical explanation of punishment in the context of Judaism is that it comes to teach and to rectify. Rb Chaim Shmuelevitz explains this is the reason for the notion of <em>middah keneged middah</em> - \"punishment which is a measure for a measure\". The person can only know what his sin was and how he must rectify it by identifying the way in which he is being punished. Or, as Rb Avraham Grodzensky said, suffering is akin to prophecy.</p>\n<p>Regarding <em>korbanos</em> (sacrifices), and from a more philosophical perspective, when one sins he takes something that does not belong to him and makes this either part of his belongings and / or a part of his persona. In order to repent, the person who sinned must surrender his ill gotten psychological gains to Hashem. From this perspective, the notion of <em>korbanos</em> is that one surrenders himself entirely to God his creator. Since God is the source of all life and being, when one surrenders himself to God, even that which he took wrongly is rectified since it is reabsorbed into God's plan and order for the creation.</p>\n<p>See for example Shoftim (13.20) concerning the angel who came to announce the birth of Shimshon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִי בַעֲלוֹת הַלַּהַב מֵעַל הַמִּזְבֵּחַ הַשָּׁמַיְמָה וַיַּעַל\nמַלְאַךְ יְהוָה בְּלַהַב הַמִּזְבֵּחַ וּמָנוֹחַ וְאִשְׁתּוֹ רֹאִים\nוַיִּפְּלוּ עַל פְּנֵיהֶם אָרְצָה.</p>\n<p>And it was when the flame rose up on the altar heavenwards, and the\nangel of God ascended in the flame of the altar, and Manoach and his\nwife saw and prostrated themselves on the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since Shimshon would in the end offer himself entirely as a sacrifice to God, when he collapsed the Philistine temple onto himself, his birth was heralded by an angel that sacrificed itself to God.</p>\n<p>So in summary</p>\n<ul>\n<li>God does not need to forgive in the sense that we wronged Him, because this is impossible.</li>\n<li>To the extent that we do need forgiveness, however, God does <em>not</em> forgive freely. See for example Bava Kamma 50a - כל האומר הקב\"ה ותרן הוא יותרו חייו - Anyone who says God freely forgives, his life should be freely given away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See further Mesillas Yesharim (<a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://dafyomireview.com/mesilat.php?d=6</a>)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather the general principle is \"whoever says the Holy One blessed be\nHe overlooks things will have his life overlooked\" (Bava Kama 50a).\nLikewise they said: \"if the evil inclination says to you: 'sin and the\nHoly One, blessed be He, will forgive you' - do not listen to him\"\n(Chagiga 16a).</p>\n<p>All this is evident and clear. For G-d is a G-d of truth as Moshe\nRabeinu, peace be unto him, said: \"The Rock, His work is perfect; For\nall His ways are justice: A G-d of faithfulness and without iniquity,\nJust and right is He\" (Deut. 32:4). For since the Holy One blessed be\nHe wants justice, to ignore the bad would be just as much an injustice\nas to ignore the good. Therefore, if it is justice that He wants, then\nHe must pay each man according to his ways and according to the fruits\nof his deeds to absolute exactness, whether for good or for bad. Thus\n\"A G-d of faithfulness and without iniquity, Just and right is He\"\n(Deut. 32:4) which our Sages of blessed memory explained [the dual\nterms]: \"to the righteous and to the wicked\" (Taanis 11a). For this is\nthe trait [of justice]. He judges on every thing. He punishes every\nsin. And there is no escape.</p>\n<p>If you ask: if so, for what does G-d's attribute of mercy exist if He\nmust be absolutely meticulous in judging every thing?</p>\n<p>The answer: The trait of mercy is certainly the pillar of the world.\nFor it could not endure without it at all whatsoever. But\nnevertheless, G-d's attribute of justice is not negated. For according\nto strict justice it would be proper that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the sinner be punished immediately for his sin without any delay whatsoever.</li>\n<li>that the punishment itself be wrathful as befits one who rebels against the word of the Creator, blessed be His Name.</li>\n<li>that there be no possible repair whatsoever for the sin.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For in truth, how can a man rectify what he has made crooked after\ncommitting the sin? If one murdered his fellow or committed adultery?\nHow can he possibly rectify this? Can he undo a deed already done from\nexistence?</p>\n<p>But the attribute of mercy reverses the three aforementioned matters.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it grants that the sinner be given time and not be eradicated from the earth immediately upon sinning.</li>\n<li>that the punishment itself not utterly destroy him.</li>\n<li>that the opportunity of repentance be granted to sinners as a complete kindness, so that the uprooting of the will be counted as the\nuprooting of the deed. Thus when the penitent man recognizes his sin\nand admits it, and reflects on his evil, repents of it and completely\nregrets ever having done it, as he would regret [in annulling] a\ncertain vow, in which case there is complete regret, and he desires\nand longs that this deed had never been committed, and pains himself\nstrongly that the matter was done, and renounces it for the future,\nand flees from it - then the uprooting of the deed from his will is\ncounted to him as the annulment of a vow and he gains atonement for\nit. As scripture says: \"your iniquity is gone and your sin atoned for\"\n(Isaiah 6:7) - that the sin is actually removed from existence, and\nuprooted through his paining himself and regretting in the present\nwhat he had done in the past.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If so, why is it stated in the same verse: “To\nincline after a multitude,” from which it can be understood that the\nmajority is followed in all cases? In order to resolve the apparent\ncontradiction it must be explained: Your inclination after the\nmajority to exonerate is not like your inclination after the majority\nto convict. Your inclination after the majority to exonerate can\nresult in a verdict by a majority of one judge. But your inclination\nafter the majority to convict a transgressor must be by a more\ndecisive majority of at least two.

How would this look in practice? What meals would violate this law? Would oysters be an example, perhaps? If so, they're prohibited even to Gentiles. What about lobsters, which are cooked alive? (I assume this is different but would like to make sure.)</p>\n<p>What meals commonly eaten in the English-speaking world are prohibited for Gentiles?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here is how the Rambam codifies the law (H. Melakhim 9:10-13):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן חייב על אבר מן החי, ועל בשר מן החי בכל שהוא:  שלא ניתנו השיעורין,\nאלא לישראל בלבד.  ומותר הוא בדם מן החי.</p>\n<p>אחד האבר או הבשר, הפורש מן הבהמה או מן החיה; אבל העוף--ייראה לי, שאין\nבן נוח נהרג על אבר מן החי ממנו. השוחט את הבהמה--אפילו שחט בה שני\nהסימנין--כל זמן שהיא מפרכסת, אבר ובשר הפורשין ממנה אסורין לבני נוח\nמשום אבר מן החי.</p>\n<p>כל שאסור על ישראל משום אבר מן החי, אסור על בני נוח.  ויש שבני נוח\nחייבין עליו, ולא ישראל:  שבני נוח אחד בהמה וחיה, בין טהורה בין\nטמאה--חייבין עליה, משום אבר מן החי ומשום בשר מן החי; ואבר ובשר הפורשין\nמן המפרכסת--אף על פי ששחט בה ישראל שני הסימנין, הרי זה אסור לבני נוח\nמשום אבר מן החי</p>\n<p>Similarly, a gentile is liable for violating the prohibition against\neating a limb or flesh from a living creature. This applies regardless\nof the amount involved, for the specification of minimum amounts only\napplies to Jews.  A gentile is permitted blood from a living creature.</p>\n<p>The prohibition applies to a limb or flesh that is separated from\neither a domesticated animal or a beast. However, it appears to me\nthat a gentile is not executed for eating a limb taken from a living\nbird. Though one slaughters an animal, even if one severs the two\nsigns that distinguish it as having been slaughtered in a kosher\nmanner, as long as the animal moves convulsively, the limbs and meat\nwhich are separated from it are forbidden to a gentile because of the\nprohibition against a limb from a living creature.</p>\n<p>All prohibitions that apply to a Jew regarding a limb from a living\ncreature also apply to gentiles. Furthermore, there are instances\nwhere a gentile would be held liable and a Jew will not for a gentile\nis liable for a limb or flesh from a living creature whether from a\ndomesticated animal or a beast, whether from a kosher or non-kosher\nspecies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The law applies to a בהמה or a חיה. There appears to be a consensus that it does not apply to creatures lower down in the Torah's taxonomy, דגים and שרצים  and some debate about whether they apply to עופות. I apologize for not translating these terms, they are not simple to translate to modern taxonomic terms. If pushed I'd roughly say that a חיה/בהמה is a larger land mammal, including ruminants and predators. דגים are aquatic creatures. שרצים are creepy-crawlies (insects, reptiles, rodent-like mammals). עופות are winged creatures such as birds/bats (but not insects).</p>\n<p>As aquatic creatures the law does not apply to oysters, lobsters, etc. and I do not believe there are any foods/meals <em>commonly</em> eaten in the Western world that would entail violation of this law. On the more infrequent side, I believe it is the custom of some American hunters to eat the heart of a fresh kill - depending on the facts of the circumstance, this could be a violation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In [Sanhedrin 59a.6] Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel says B'nei-Noach are prohibited from consuming the blood from a living animal, regarding the mitsvah אַךְ־בָּשָׂר בְּנַפְשׁ֥וֹ דָמוֹ לֹא תֹאכֵלוּ in [Bereshit 9.4].</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chanina ben Gamliel says: \"The blood from a living animal is also prohibited\" as <strong>\"this is a limb from a living animal\"</strong> [Sanhedrin 59a.8]</p>\n<p>If [Sanhedrin 59a.6-8] supports the prohibition of [Bereshit 9.4] to the בְנֵי־נֹחַ Descendants of Noach from consuming blood in flesh then these types of modern cuisines are not allowed :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Verivorst ,</li>\n<li>Bahur ,</li>\n<li>Blodpudding ,</li>\n<li>Krvavice ,</li>\n<li>Morcilla de Burgos ,</li>\n<li>Jelito ,</li>\n<li>Korean Sundae ,</li>\n<li>Kaszanka ,</li>\n<li>Blutwurst ,</li>\n<li>Black pudding.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

The obvious question is that Rabbi Yochanan was alive at the time, so why was he upset? The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47607&st=&pgnum=354\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eitz Yosef ad. loc.</a> explains that since Rabbi Yochanan didn't have any kids, as per the <em>gemarra</em> in Berachos 5b, he was considered like he was dead (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nedarim.64b.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 64b</a>). It would appear then that all of Rabbi Yochanan's children died.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>gemarra</em> in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.71b.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 71b</a> says that Rabbi Yochanan had a daughter that he tried to marry off to his student Zeiri. This would appear to be a contradiction, as we see he had at least one living child. Does anyone point this out? I can think of a few resolutions, but I don't know if they're correct. Perhaps his daughter died as well, and this was before she died, and in the Yevamos story he had no children at all? Or perhaps the concept of being without children being considered dead is referring to male children (I hope not)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Tosafot on the spot in Berachot seems to assume that daughters don’t count, citing the very passage in Kiddushin as proof:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואי משום בנות ר׳ יוחנן נמי הוו ליה בנות בפרק בתרא דקדושין</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In general, it is strange that he wrote on him so, for our Rabbi already wrote in his commentary that he does not [personally] know all of these birds and he translated them as was traditionally accepted in the nation, and these are his words: \"And these twenty birds, though we have translated them as we have received, any detail of them that might come to us we would not know explicitly that this is that [bird], and especially considering that there is with these twenty the subspecies of all of these, as it says \"to its kind\".\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohar_Amar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Zohar Amar</a> discusses this subject in his book מסורת העוף (The Tradition of the Birds), pp. <a href=\"https://beta.otzar.org/#/b/608149/p/270/t/16470.8928894622903512/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c/1648390831098\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">264</a>-<a href=\"https://beta.otzar.org/#/b/608149/p/276/t/16470.8928894622903512/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c/1648390855631\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">270</a>. He brings a number of sources, including Rav Kapach, that show that the Anka was considered a real bird and not mythological, and also presents a number of different identifications.

Like it is written in Sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.15?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemos 14:15</a> on the verse \"Why do you cry out to me?\". And from this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Exodus.14.15.1?vhe=Sefer_Torat_Elohim,_Vilna_1879&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it is proved</a> that this measure/attribute does not need additional influence by blessing on the past. And furthermore <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Deuteronomy.33.26.2?vhe=Sefer_Torat_Elohim,_Vilna_1879&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I wrote</a> about this in Sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.33.26?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 33:26</a> on the verse, \"Through the skies in His majesty\". Therefore, Eliezer who came to him in the way of a concealed miracle accordingly makes a blessing, <strong>whereas conversely, the exodus of Egypt was a revealed miracle</strong> and as such they did not make a blessing until Yisro came and blessed (over the exodus) for that too.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It concludes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גנאי הוא למשה וששים ריבוא שלא אמרו ברוך עד שבא יתרו ואמר ברוך ה</p>\n<p>It is a disgrace for Moses and the six hundred thousand adult men of the children of Israel whom he led out of Egypt that they did not say: Blessed, until Yitro came and said: “Blessed be the Lord.” (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Samuel bar Nahman said, “When the Holy One, blessed be He, created the world, He longed to have an abode below just as He had on high</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is our job to make this world a dwelling place for G-d. In a similair vein, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.26.1?ven=Path_of_the_Just._Trans._Rabbi_Yosef_Sebag&vhe=Shechem_Messilat_Yesharim&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesilat Yesharim</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The matter of holiness is dual. Its beginning is service [of G-d] while its end is reward; its beginning is exertion while its end is a [divine] gift. That is, its beginning is that which a man sanctifies himself, while its end is his being sanctified. This is what our sages, of blessed memory, said: \"if a man sanctifies himself a little, he becomes much sanctified. If he sanctifies himself below, he becomes sanctified from above\" (Yomah 39a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.1.4?ven=Path_of_the_Just._Trans._Rabbi_Yosef_Sebag&vhe=Shechem_Messilat_Yesharim&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesilat Yesharim</a> explains that by doing mitzvot, which G-d commanded us, it serves as a sort of corridor to the world-to-come:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The means that lead a person to this goal are the commandments which the blessed G-d commanded to us. The place of the performance of these commandments is only in this world. Therefore, man was first placed in this world so that through these means prepared for him here, he will be able to reach the place prepared for him, namely, the World to Come, there to be sated with the good which he acquired through these means. This is what our sages of blessed memory said \"today to do them, and tomorrow to receive their reward\" (Eruvin 22:1).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We should fulfill G-ds mitzvot out of love, not because we know that by doing them, we get a reward. As the Rebbe writes <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/6008/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Kislev-18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Hayom Yom, Kislev 18)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Tzemach Tzedek writes: The love expressed in \"Beside You I wish for nothing,\"1 means that one should desire nothing other than G‑d, not even \"Heaven\" or \"earth\" i.e. Higher Gan Eden and Lower Gan Eden, for these were created with a mere yud</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the famous <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/6008/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Kislev-18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">expression</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want nothing at all! I don't want Your gan eden, I don't want Your olam haba... I want nothing but You alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, we come to your question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If man’s existence in olam haba is man’s goal, shouldn’t he wish to die?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I personally do not think that's why we are here in this world, as mentioned above. We need to make this a dwelling place for the shechina. As the Mesilat Yesharim writes \"It's beginning is service of G-d\". Then..... the end is reward, they are both connected through each other.</p>\n<p>As brought by Joel K in the comments, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.17?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 4:17</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He used to say: more precious is one hour in repentance and good deeds in this world, than all the life of the world to come; And more precious is one hour of the tranquility of the world to come, than all the life of this world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this Mishnah, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.17?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=Ikar%20Tosafot%20Yom%20Tov&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ikar Tosafos Yom Tov</a> explains something interesting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The world to come\": The beginning is not a [contradiction] to the end, as this world is for action and the world to come is for payment and enjoyment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This world is for \"action\"- for doing mitzvot, the world-to-come is for the reward of the actions we did in this world.

Rav Naḥman of Breslov emphasized the last one, without discounting the value of the other three.  He preached that, to be close to God, you have to speak to God “as you would with a best friend”, in your own words, in your mother tongue, at least one hour a day; preferably in a natural setting, such as a field or a forest, among the natural works of God's creation, to avoid man-made distractions.  He called it <em>hitbodedut</em>, meaning “self-seclusion”.  It is central to his thinking.  He described it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is very good to pour out your thoughts before God like a child pleading before his father. God calls us His children, as it is written [in the Torah]: \"You are children to God.\" [Deuteronomy 14:1] Therefore, it is good to express your thoughts and troubles to God like a child complaining and pestering his father.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As one commentator described it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>During a session of <em>hitbodedut</em>, the practitioner pours out his heart to God in his own language, describing all his thoughts, feelings, problems and frustrations. Nothing was viewed by Rebbe Naḥman as being too mundane for discussion, including business dealings, conflicting desires and everyday interactions. Even the inability to properly articulate what one wishes to say is viewed as a legitimate subject to discuss with God. One should also use the opportunity to examine his behavior and motivations, correcting the flaws and errors of the past while seeking the proper path for the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why wait eight days to remove the orloh (foreskin) given that it is considered מאוס (repulsive)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Talmud often says that someone with an orloh (foreskin) is disgusting (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.71a.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 71a</a>).

It would seem to me, that if the infant is healthy enough to have the circumcision performed earlier, eliminating this source of disgust (מאוס) should have been preferable. That the parents are now happy because the mother is no longer טמאה (ritually impure), and that the father has to be happy to do a mitsva is not enough of a reason for the child to have to suffer for eight days with something repulsive.</p>\n<p>I should add: The reason that we don't wait for the child to become bar-mitsva age is because we don't want him to remain repulsive for so long, so why is waiting eight days OK?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>In answer to the question to why Abraham did not circumcise himself prior to being commanded to do so by God, the Brisker Rov (R. Isaac Ze'ev Soloveitchik) is reported as suggesting that a <em>shem orlah</em> (designation as an orlah) does not emerge until there is a commandment to circumcise. Accordingly prior to being commanded there is no <em>shem orlah</em> (designation as an orlah) and the orlah would not be deemed repugnant (מאוס) before such time.</p>\n<p>R. Elyaqim Dvorkes (Aliba de-Hilkhetha, vol. 27. P. 46):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מובא בשם הגרי\"ז מבריסק זצ\"ל שחידש דכל זמן שאין שם של ערלה, לא שייך דין\nמילה שהוא הסרת הערלה, רק ע\"י הציווי למול את הערלה קיבלה הערלה שַם\nערלה, זה אמור כלפי אברהם אבינו שלא היה יכול למול עצמו קודם שנצטוה,\nאולם לאחר שנצטוה וכבר יש כאן שַם ערלה אז יש חיוב מילה</p>\n<p>It is brought down in the name of the Gri”z from Brisk of blessed\nmemory that he novelly suggested that any time there isn’t a shem\norlah (designation as an orlah), then a din milah (judgement dictating\ncircumcision) which is the removal of the orlah is irrelevant. It is\nonly by means of the instruction to circumcise the orlah that the\norlah gets its designation as an orlah (shem orlah). And it is that\nwhich is said as regards to Abraham our Patriarch, in explanation to\nwhy he did not circumcise himself prior to being commanded. For it is\nonly after and consequent to him being commanded [to circumcise] that\nthe designation as an orlah arose and thus the obligation to\ncircumcise.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Eliezer Freifeld also quotes the Brisker Rov to such effect (Imre Eliezer, p. 59):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל מה שהערלה הוא <strong>מאוס</strong> הוא רק מחמת הציווי \"והיה תמים\" אבל קודם לא היה\nכאן ערלה כלל ולא שייך בזה מצות מילה</p>\n<p>Everything about an orlah which is <strong>repulsive</strong> is only due to the\ncommandment [to circumcise] and “be thou wholehearted” (Gen. 17:1),\nhowever prior to then there wasn’t an orlah at all and the commandment\nto circumcise was inapplicable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seemingly the same would apply to an infant, about whom it is commanded to circumcise on the eighth day (Gen. 17:12, Lev. 12:3). Prior to the eighth day there is no commandment that the orlah be removed and thus there is no <em>shem orlah</em> (designation as an orlah) and it is therefore not repugnant. It is only once there is a <em>din milah</em> that a <em>shem orlah</em> emerges along with its attendant baggage of being repugnant.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Torah teaches us <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.22.27?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Vayikra 22:27)</a> that from the 8th day, a bullock, sheep or goat is accepted as a offering for G-d:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under its dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire to the Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.29.8?ven=Pirke_de_Rabbi_Eliezer,_trans._Rabbi_Gerald_Friedlander,_London,_1916&vhe=Pirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer, chapter 29)</a> connects this idea to the fact that Isaac was circumcised on the 8th day, thus, says the Midrash:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thou mayest learn that everyone who brings his son for circumcision is as though (he were) a high priest bringing his meal offering and his drink offering upon the top of the altar.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, on Bereishsis 17:13, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.17.13?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bahya</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A Midrashic approach to our verse views the commandment as similar to the offering of a sacrifice. Just as when a person offers a sacrifice on the altar and the blood of the offering achieves atonement for him, so the blood lost by the person being circumcised acts as atonement for him. This is why this rite has to be performed on the eighth day of the baby’s life. Just as an animal sacrifice is not admissible as such until the eighth day of the animal’s life (compare Leviticus 22, 27: ומיום השמיני והלאה ירצה, “and from the eighth day on it will be welcome as a sacrifice for G-d. In connection with the sacrificial offering the Torah writes (Exodus 29,33) ואכלו אותם אשר כפר בהם, “They- who received atonement through them (the offerings)- shall eat them;” so we make a festive meal to celebrate the induction of the circumcised baby into the Jewish community. In fact, the effect of the circumcision is far greater than that of an animal sacrifice. An animal sacrifice represents only a financial sacrifice by the donor whereas the rite of circumcision involves his body. The organ which is cut is one that radiates feelings to all parts of the body of the person concerned. This is why it is called ראש הגויה, “head of the whole body” in Negaim 6,7. This is why this organ was chosen to serve as a demonstration of self-sacrifice and why someone who undergoes circumcision is considered in the eyes of G-d as if he had sacrificed his entire body on G-d’s behalf. This is also why in Psalms 50,5 the psalmist Assaph describes circumcision as “who made a covenant with Me over sacrifice.” G-d Himself describes His pious as having made a covenant with Him by means of circumcising themselves.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to these sources, the reason why we wait 8 days, is because it is considered as if you bring a offering, as the Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer explains.</p>\n<p>See also the explanation given by the Lubavitcher Rebbe <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14926&st=&pgnum=98&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Likkutei Sichos, volume 3, p. 834)</a>.</p>\n<p>You ask, \"This doesnt answer why a child has to be in such a disgusting state for seven days\"-  to this, I would like to add in the commentary of the Rambam in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.49.13?ven=Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_English_Translation,_Friedlander_(1903)&vhe=Moreh_Nevuchim,_translated_by_Ibn_Tibon&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim (3:49)</a> that the reason we wait 8 days, is because it is not safe for the baby to give his bris milah before the 8th day:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The circumcision must take place on the eighth day (Lev. 12:3), because all living beings are after birth, within the first seven days, very weak and exceedingly tender, as if they were still in the womb of their mother; not until the eighth day can they be counted among those that enjoy the light of the world. That this is also the case with beasts may be inferred from the words of Scripture: \"Seven days shall it be under the dam\" (Lev. 22:27), as if it had no vitality before the end of that period. In the same manner man is circumcised after the completion of seven days. The period has been fixed, and has not been left to everybody's judgment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, \"This doesnt answer why a child has to be in such a disgusting state for seven days\"- in this case it seems that the concept of <em>pikuach nefesh</em> is obviously more important. It is not safe to perform the Bris before the eighth day according to the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Though the orla is a weird piece of skin that exudes smeg, it's disgusting on a Jew because is indicates repudiation of Abraham's covenant with God.</p>\n<p>There is no benefit to removing it before the 8 days commanded. Indeed, rushing it to remove before its time for purposes other than the command may invalidate the bris.</p>\n\n\n",

If what he did was tantamount to a crime for which there was a death penalty (כאילו שכב עמה), surely there should have been some major repercussions.</p>\n<p>I Chronicles 5:1-2 states that as a consequence of Reuben's offense, the bekhor (birthright) passed over from Reuben and was granted to the descendants of Joseph:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובני ראובן בכור ישראל כי הוא הבכור ובחללו יצועי אביו נתנה בכרתו לבני\nיוסף בן ישראל ולא להתיחש לבכרה</p>\n<p>And the sons of Reuben the first-born of Israel--for he was the\nfirst-born; but, forasmuch as he defiled his father's couch, his\nbirthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of Israel, yet\nnot so that he was to be reckoned in the genealogy as first-born.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bamidbar Rabbah 6:2 teaches further, that as a part of losing the bekhor, Reuben was also stripped of the malkhuth (monarchy), kehunah (priesthood), and 'avodath haleviim (Levitical class) which otherwise would rightfully have belonged to him and his heirs:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יעקב אומר לראובן (בראשית מט, ג): \"ראובן בכרי אתה כחי וראשית אוני יתר\nשאת ויתר עז\". שאת זו כהונה, כמה דתימא (ויקרא ט, כב): \"וישא אהרן את\nידיו אל העם ויברכם\". עז זו מלכות שנאמר (שמואל א ב,  י): \"ויתן עז\nלמלכו\". שאלולי לא סרח ראובן במעשה בלהה, היה ראוי ליטול כהונה ומלכות,\nלפי שהיה בכור. ומנין אף לעבודת הלוים היו ראויין, שכן את מוצא שנכנסו\nפשוטי הלוים תחת בכורי ישראל, שנאמר (במדבר ג, מא): \"ולקחת את הלוים לי\nאני ה' תחת כל בכר בבני ישראל\"</p>\n<p>Jacob said to Reuben (Gen 49:3): “Reuben, you are my firstborn, my\nstrength and the first of my might. [You should have been] superior in\nrank (יתר שאת) and superior in power (ויתר עז).” שאת refers to the\nPriesthood, such as is said (Lev. 9:22): “And Aaron lifted-up (ישא)\nhis hands toward the people, and blessed them.” עז refers to the\nMonarchy, as it says (I Samuel 2:10): “and He will give strength (עז)\nunto His king, and exalt the horn of His anointed.” For had Reuben not\nsullied himself with the episode of Bilhah, he would have been fit to\ntake the Priesthood and the Monarchy, since he was the firstborn. And\nfrom whence do we know that he even would have been granted the\nLevitical class? For we see that the Levites subrogated the firstborns\nof Israel, as it said (Numbers 3: 41): \"And thou shalt take the\nLevites for Me, even the LORD, instead of all the first-born among the\nchildren of Israel\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sifrei (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.347.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 347:1-2</a>) offers a few other suggestions which would seem to mitigate against the consequences being too major. 1) His brothers banded together and interceded to God that he be forgiven. 2) Reuben sought to save Joseph, so his good deed allayed the consequence of his bad deed 3) Reuben utterly repented of his sin.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יחי ראובן ואל ימות - וכי מה ענין זה לזה? משל למלך שבא אצל בניו לפרקים.\nכשהוא נפטר מבניו - היו בניו וקרוביו מלוים אותו. אמר להם: בני, שמא כלום\nצורך יש לכם, שמא דבר יש לכם? אמרו לו: אבא, אין לנו צורך ואין לנו דבר,\nאלא שתתרצה לאחינו הגדול! אלמלא שבטים לא נתרצה המקום לראובן, לכך נאמר\nיחד שבטי ישראל - יחי ראובן:... ד\"א יחי ראובן במעשה יוסף, ואל ימות במעשה\nבלהה. ר' חנינא בן גמליאל אומר: לעולם אין מחליפים לא זכות בחובה ולא\nחובה בזכות, חוץ משל ראובן ומשל דוד; שנא' (שמואל ב טז) ושמעי הולך בצלע\nההר לעומתו הלך ויקלל ויסקל באבנים לעומתו ועפר בעפר, ואעפ\"כ הר לעומתו:\n(מלכים א י״א:כ״ז) שלמה בנה את בית המילוא סגר את עיר דוד אביו. וחכמים\nאומרים: אין מחליפים לעולם לא זכות בחובה ולא חובה בזכות, אלא נותנים מתן\nשכר על המצות ועונשים על העבירות. ומה ת\"ל יחי ראובן ואל ימות? שעשה\nראובן תשובה. רבן שמעון בן גמליאל אומר: נוצל ראובן מאותו החטא, ולא נזקק\nלאותו מעשה. אפשר שהוא עתיד לעמוד בראש שבטים בהר עיבל, ואומר ארור שוכב\nעם אשת אביו, ונזקק לאותו מעשה? ומה ת\"ל כי עלית משכבי אביך? שתבע עלבונה\nשל אמו</p>\n<p>(Devarim 33:6) \"Reuven shall live and he shall not die\": How is this\nrelated to what precedes [(\"together, the tribes of Israel\")]?

And what existing (by his time) transgression/offense he did commit?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Gemara explains that הִרְהוּרֵי עֲבֵירָה קָשׁוּ מֵעֲבֵירָה - thoughts of trangressions are worse than the transgression itself <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.29a.1?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Yoma 29a)</a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.29a.1?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=Akeidat%20Yitzchak&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akeidat Yitzchak</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Talmud Sukkah 52, states that anyone who is greater than his fellow man also has greater urges than his fellow man, this may well mean that he who deliberates before committing a sin, may well find that eventually the impulses urging him to sin will overpower him. This is also the meaning of the Talmudic statement (Yuma 29) that \"the deliberations leading to sin are worse than the sin itself.\" This is nothing else than saying \"when the sin has become the result of careful deliberation, such sin is especially weighty.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, Reuven did not anything but rearranging the couch/bed. However, it is important to find the reason why he did that action in the first place, and that brings us to the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.35.22?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Daat%20Zkenim&lang2=en&p3=Job.31&ven3=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe3=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang3=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Daat Zkenim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah treats the deed as if Reuben had committed incest with his aunt. Our author points to Job 31,12, [he could have used the entire sequence from verse 1 to there Ed.] as proof that harbouring incestuous thoughts may be considered as if one had carried out what one had fantasized about.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, he did not actually sleep with Bilhah, as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.35.22?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Tur%20HaAroch&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tur HaAroch</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some commentators point to the wording of וישכב את בלהה instead of וישכב עם בלהה, as meaning that all Reuven had done was to put his bed next to that of Bilhah. [the expression את always denotes a lesser degree of intimacy than the expression עם. (compare Genesis 30,16,Samuel II 11,4; ) Ed.] Further proof that Reuven did not actually sleep with Bilhah, is provided by Yaakov himself in Genesis 49,4 when he describes Reuven’s indiscretion with the words: כי עלית משכבי אביך, אז חללת יצועי עלה, “for when you entered your father’s bedroom you desecrated him who ascended the bed that had been made for me.” All Reuven had been guilty of was to disarray the bedclothes, not to lie in them. He spoke about the person lying in the bed in the third person, instead of saying: “you lay in my bed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But it was his Yetzer Hara that got into him and made him move the bed. Instead of controlling himself not to listen to his Yetzer Hara, as we see with Yosef HaTzadik, he actually did and moved the couch. According to the talmudic principle of הִרְהוּרֵי עֲבֵירָה קָשׁוּ מֵעֲבֵירָה - he commited a sin.</p>\n\n\n",

One case in point is the\nHebrew <em>ẓara'at</em> (efflorescens), which actually does not refer to one\nspecific diagnosis but covers a wide variety of infectious and\nnoninfectious skin ailments. The fault lies in the original Septuagint\nversion, which renders ẓara'at throughout as \"leprosy.\" Actually, the\nancients used the term \"leprosy\" not for the disease known by that\nname nowadays, but to denote the condition to which modern medicine\nrefers as \"psoriasis.\" The term <em>ẓara'at</em> can denote many different\nconditions, depending on the combinations in which it is used. Thus\n<em>neg'a ha-ẓara'at</em> is an infectious skin disease—perhaps yaws; <em>zara'at 'or ha-basar</em> (Lev. 13:43; usually rendered as \"leprosy in the skin of the flesh\") is <em>ulcus durum penis</em>; <em>ẓara'at poraḥat</em>\n(Lev. 13:42) is leishmaniasis; <em>ẓara'at noshenet</em> (Lev. 13:11) is\nchronic syphilis (yaws et al.); <em>zara'at ha-rosh</em> is trichophytia;\n<em>ẓara'at mameret ha-beged</em> is a fungus growth that can be transferred to clothing; and <em>ẓara'at ha-bayit</em> is a saprophytic contamination of\ndwellings. <strong>In some instances the term <em>ẓara'at</em> used by itself does\nhave the meaning of \"leprosy.\" Thus, <em>ẓara'at ha-mezaḥ</em> is lepra\nleonina.</strong> It is only natural that in the course of the thousand-year\nperiod covered by biblical medicine certain variants should have been\nintroduced.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you are wondering where this variety of צרעת is referred to, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.26.19?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Chronicles 26:19-20</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Jacob Milgrom in his commentary to Leviticus 13 writes that the greek term lepra doesn't mean leprosy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Biblical ṣāraʿat is difficult to identify. One thing, however, is\ncertain: it is not leprosy (Hansen’s disease), despite Preuss 1978:\n324–26).This was well known in Hellenistic times, for the LXX translates ṣāraʿat consistently by lepra, not by the Greek term for leprosy, elephas or elephantiasis. Indeed, it is most probable that true leprosy was totally unknown in the Near East before the Hellenistic period, and it is surmised that it was first brought into the area by Alexander’s armies when they returned from India. Apparently, the two diseases were not confused until the ninth century C.E., when the Arab physician John of Damascus referred to leprosy by the term lepra (Andersen 1969), and his mistake persists till this day. According to the most recent investigation, the disease that fulfills most of the characteristics of this chapter is psoriasis. But to judge by the quarantine procedures prescribed in this chapter, even this identification is in doubt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your old Chavruta</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Were scrolls ever written on both sides?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Every Hebrew scroll I've ever seen has been written on only one side.  This makes sense both due to the physical properties of velum (the outer side is smooth and easy to write on; the inner side is rough and hard to write on) and because it would be hard while reading a scroll to \"flip it over\" and read on the opposite side.</p>\n<p>But Revelations 5:1 mentions a \"scroll written on the inside and on the back\" (NASB).  I realize that the book of Revelations itself is out-of-scope for this community, but I'm wondering if anyone here can shed light on the historical Jewish context of this passage.  Were Hebrew scrolls really ever written on both sides of the velum?  And if so, were there any special preparations made to the velum to facilitate writing on the rough side?  And under what circumstances would these two-sided scrolls be used?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The Talmud (Shabbat 79b) prescribes specific sides of the hide to be used for writing (depending which parts of the hide are being used) and the majority opinion (YD 271:3) is that writing on the wrong side would be invalid for ritual use.</p>\n<p>That doesn't mean no one ever did such a thing. Indeed, we find the scroll Ezekiel ate was written on both sides (Ezekiel 2:8-3:3).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A mezuzah has a name of God written on the back, which faces outwards when the scroll is rolled.</p>\n<p>Legal documents are also often rolled or folded , sometimes sealed with wax, with a description on the outside, which is the back of the scroll .</p>\n<p>To write on it, buff the roughness out or use a thicker ink.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The archaeological evidence is not easy to interpret.

    "content": "# Obligation to leave through a different gate\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The prophet <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.46.9\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ezekiel (46:9)</a> tells us of an obligation when visiting the Temple.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבְב֨וֹא עַם־הָאָ֜רֶץ לִפְנֵ֣י יְהוָה֮ בַּמּֽוֹעֲדִים֒ הַבָּ֡א דֶּרֶךְ־שַׁ֨עַר צָפ֜וֹן לְהִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֺ֗ת יֵצֵא֙ דֶּרֶךְ־שַׁ֣עַר נֶ֔גֶב וְהַבָּא֙ דֶּרֶךְ־שַׁ֣עַר נֶ֔גֶב יֵצֵ֖א דֶּרֶךְ־שַׁ֣עַר צָפ֑וֹנָה לֹ֣א יָשׁ֗וּב דֶּ֤רֶךְ הַשַּׁ֙עַר֙ אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֣א ב֔וֹ כִּ֥י נִכְח֖וֹ יצאו [יֵצֵֽא׃]</p>\n<p>But on the fixed occasions, when the common people come before the LORD, whoever enters by the north gate to bow low shall leave by the south gate; and whoever enters by the south gate shall leave by the north gate. They shall not go back through the gate by which they came in, but shall go out by the opposite one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see one should leave through a different gate than the one they entered from. Is this an obligation? A nice thing to do? Does the Rambam or others bring it as a <em>halacha</em>? I did see the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ben_Ish_Hai,_Halachot_1st_Year,_Vayikra_9.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ben Ish Chai</a> says it's a <em>mitzvah</em> to do this with a synagogue, but I'm looking for the Temple specifically (first, second, and third).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I recall seeing in the שיחות of Rav Chaim Shmuelivitz זצ\"ל in the name of Rav Yosef (Hachasid) Yaavetz that this is an obligation, as going out through the same entrance creates a familiarity with the Temple area, which, because of its sanctity, must be avoided. But I have neither ספרים at hand to check it. Will try and find it and post it.</p>\n<p>I have finally had a chance to look into it a little bit. In מדות ב-ב it states: כָּל הַנִּכְנָסִין לְהַר הַבַּיִת נִכְנָסִין דֶּרֶךְ יָמִין וּמַקִּיפִין וְיוֹצְאִין דֶּרֶךְ שְׂמֹאל and the רמב\"ם paskens that in הל' בית הבחירה ז-ג. From the ר\"ב it appears (and so understands the תוס יו\"ט the ר\"ב) that he learns that one has to leave through another gate than through the one he entered. As exit gate he (quoting whom?) uses as example שער טדי. The תוי\"ט points out that this can't be true, as the משנה earlier (א-ג) told us that שער טדי served no purpose. He points to the פירוש הרמב\"ם who seems to learn that the שער טדי was only used as an indication which way to walk. As such, it isn't clear whether according to the רמב\"ם one may leave through the same gate or not.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Yes, this is halacha.</p>\n<p>One source is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.151.5?lang=en&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch</a> (Siman 151:5)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the synagogue has two entrances, one should not enter through one to make a path to the second one to shorten your route.

In his Bei'ur Halakha, the Mishna Berura discusses, and ultimately prohibits, using a beit ha-keneset as a shortcut while traveling to perform a mitzva.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of this, however, concerns synagogues and not the Temple.</p>\n<p>The Rambam, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Chosen_Temple.7.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah The Chosen Temple</a> (7:2) does write about this in regards to the Beis Hamikdash:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One should not take a shortcut through the Temple Mount, by entering from one gate, and leaving from the opposite one, in order to shorten the way. Rather, one should walk around from the outside, entering only for the purpose of a mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found that halacha using this <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/31865\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a> by proxy, as they mention a related law (6:14) instead of the one we are interested in (7:2)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someone entering the area where the Beis HaMikdash once stood is chayov kareis, an extremely severe punishment. 1</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These translations are from Google Translate, so if anyone knows Hebrew well, translating the Beit Yosef may give more clarity as to its meaning. But clearly, the Beit Yosef is referencing that verse from Ezekiel.</p>\n\n\n",

If we divided in fourths, the remainder would have been 253 and not been so helpful).</p>\n<p>See the Rambam in hilchot Kiddush hachodesh perek 6 that discusses the breakdown of the calculation in depth.</p>\n<p>It was likely changed to shlishei in more recent texts or editions due to the fact that Yadot does not inherently mean thirds, and it led to confusion among people who increasingly were not aware of the specifics of molad or astronomical calculations.</p>\n\n\n",

The Baraisa resumes.  What is the meaning of the verse which states: From the inner chamber comes the whirlwind - this refers to the south wind, which comes from the innermost region of the world; and from the dispersed parts, the cold - this refers to the north wind, which comes from the open side of the world.  The Baraisa continues with an exposition of the next verse.  By the Breathe of G-d He gives ice - this refers to the west wind; and an expanse of water in a torrent - this refers to the east wind.</p>\n<p>If anyone could possibly provide the Maharal's detailed explanation of this Gemara in Chidushei Aggados and in Be'er Hagolah, Be'er 6, in English, I would appreciate it very much.</p>\n\n\n",

The sages said: \"Whosoever enjoys aught in return of the study of the words of the Torah takes his own life away from the world\" (Pirke Abot, 4.7). They have, moreover, commanded and said: \"Do not make them a garland by which to be considered great nor a <em>qardom lachapor bahen</em> -- a spade to dig with them.\" (Ibid.) Again they have commanded and said: \"Love manual labor and hate rank\". (Pirke Abot, 1.10); whosoever studies the Torah and does not acquire at the same time a manual trade his knowledge of the Torah will be nullified and bring about sin\" (Ibid. 2.2.). The end of this will be that he will rob people for his living.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Notice the Rambam quotes the same mishnah as did the question.)</p>\n<p>The reasoning of Pirqei Avos and the Rambam would seem to apply to someone who uses Torah for business advice.</p>\n<p>BUT...</p>\n<p>Someone who supports Kollel may say we simply do not hold like this Rambam. In our culture, getting paid for learning is indeed common (from YU to Ponovezh, after all). And there are various approaches to this question in which we do both support the idea of getting paid for studying in kollel <em>and</em> hold like this Rambam.</p>\n<p>To my mind, the simplest resolution is that there is a difference between someone who learns in order make a living, akin to someone with a skill in programming computers making his living doing that; and someone who wants to learn, and therefore takes a paycheck to make it possible. This is how I understand the leniency of being allowed to pay someone \"<em>sekhar batala</em> -- pay from being idle [from a job].\" Turning Torah into just another job is problematic. Kollel isn't that, though.</p>\n<p>And I would see the same distinction here. The Ramchal is telling you how to be holy, which includes all of life, including business. In practice, the holy way of doing things \"just happens to be\" pragmatically superior and more successful more often in the long run. But if we take the Ramchal's advice and use it <strong>for</strong> that practical success, you took his words of Torah and made them a \"<em>qardom lachapor bahen</em> -- spade to dig with them\".</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Here's how I am understanding your question, please correct me if I am misreading you:</p>\n<p>Hazal say that we should we should not use the Torah to aggrandize ourselves or materially enrich ourselves (Avoth). On the other hand, the study of Torah has the effect of imparting wisdom. Is it therefore forbidden to utilize said wisdom in one's material pursuits?</p>\n<p>It is my understanding that benefiting directly from Torah (i.e. reveling in rabbinic honors, or accepting money to teach/learn) is what is forbidden (H. Talmud Torah 3:10). However benefiting from the wisdom that an individual has cultivated as a byproduct of their Torah learning is perfectly acceptable. Indeed, it seems to me that the Torah wants us to have a good life led by wisdom and all of the benefits of living a life of wisdom.</p>\n<p>Mishlei 3:13-18</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַשְׁרֵי אָדָם, מָצָא חָכְמָה; וְאָדָם, יָפִיק תְּבוּנָה.  כִּי טוֹב\nסַחְרָהּ, מִסְּחַר-כָּסֶף; וּמֵחָרוּץ, תְּבוּאָתָהּ.  יְקָרָה הִיא,\nמפניים (מִפְּנִינִים); וְכָל-חֲפָצֶיךָ, לֹא יִשְׁווּ-בָהּ. אֹרֶךְ\nיָמִים, בִּימִינָהּ; בִּשְׂמֹאולָהּ, עֹשֶׁר וְכָבוֹד.  דְּרָכֶיהָ\nדַרְכֵי-נֹעַם; וְכָל-נְתִיבוֹתֶיהָ שָׁלוֹם.  עֵץ-חַיִּים הִיא,\nלַמַּחֲזִיקִים בָּהּ; וְתֹמְכֶיהָ מְאֻשָּׁר.</p>\n<p>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that obtaineth\nunderstanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the\nmerchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is\nmore precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are\nnot to be compared unto her. <strong>Length of days is in her right hand; in\nher left hand are riches and honour</strong>. Her ways are ways of pleasantness,\nand all her paths are peace.She is a tree of life to them that lay\nhold upon her, and happy is every one that holdest her fast.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ralbag explains (3:17):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה בימין התורה יהיה אורך ימים ר\"ל השגת החיים הנצחיים כי זהו פריה ולזה\nייחס זה אל ימינה וזה יהיה במה שישיג בה מן החכמה והתבונה והנה על הכוונה\nהשנית ישיג בה עושר וכבוד כי מצד ההשגחה האלהית שתדבק באדם בעבורה ימשכו\nלו ג\"כ טובות גופיות</p>\n<p>Here in the right hand the Torah confers length of days, which is to\nsay the achievement of eternal life, for that is its fruit and thus\ncorresponds to the right hand, and this is what is achieved through\nwisdom and understanding, and the secondary effect is that he achieves\nwealth and honor, for divine providence cleaves to man because of this\nand also bestows upon him the physical good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A life led by Torah wisdom can facilitate both the good of this world and the world to come. To my understanding there is no reason to refrain from implementing wisdom earned through Torah study. Our study has the effect of shaping us, honing our intellects, and aligning us with wisdom. \"Great is study for it leads to action” (Qiddushin 40b) It seems to me that it would be foolish to say that we can somehow compartmentalize our minds and say \"wisdom sits untouched on this shelf over here\" and then proceed to act despite and contrary to it. The Torah wants us to become wise through its study, and there is no reason to artificially restrict its application.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does this verse show that Vespasian will be emperor?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Gittin.56b.1?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the famous story</a> about the meeting between Rabban Yochanan Ben Zakai and Vespasian, RYb\"Z brings an asmachta from a verse to show that Vespasian will become emperor. The verse is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Isaiah.10.34?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yeshayahu 10:34</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>RYb\"Z explains that \"a mighty one\" is a king. My question is: How does this show that Vespasian will be emperor? After all, when news of his imperial status came, Vespasian left Judea in the hands of his son Titus (and this is logical because the emperor couldn't stick around in a rebellious backwater province). This means that the situation was exactly as it was before Vespasian left: A general who is not an emperor leading the assault on Yerushalayim. So either way, the Temple would not have been destroyed by an emperor. So what does the verse prove, or in what manner does it strengthen RYb\"Z's claim?</p>\n\n\n",

For example at nightime (as opposed to the Torah’s daytime) when a chatan celebrates his sheva brachot.</p>\n<p>We learn in Yerushalmi Bikkurim 3:3 that Eisav married Machalat.  It was really Basmat whom he married but she changed her name because he was machul for all of his sins after having married her.  The Gemara uses Eisav as the source to teach that a chatan during his wedding is one occasion in a person’s life during which he receives forgiveness of sins.</p>\n<p>If that is true then this chatan metzorah should have already been forgiven for his sins and would not need the Torah to suspend his visit to the Kohen.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41902&st=&pgnum=169\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pardes Yosef</a> to Leviticus 13:16 brings this question from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryeh_Tzvi_Frumer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Aryeh Tzvi Frumer</a>, a Rosh Yeshiva in Lublin.</p>\n<p>The Pardes Yosef suggests that once a groom is forgiven of all of his sins, he becomes a completely righteous person.

If so, immediately upon becoming married and forgiven, all of the minor sins the person previously committed, which were until now ignored, will now awaken. Even those sins can cause <em>tzaraas</em>. If not for this verse, the Kohen would come and declare him impure. Instead, he's given his week of wedding celebrations.</p>\n<p>If I'm understanding the Pardes Yosef correctly, he's discussing new skin afflictions, not the ones the groom had just before getting married. I'm not sure what he'd say about those. Perhaps those would disappear, or they would have been declared pure?

And some say: A father is also obligated to teach his son to swim. <strong>Rabbi Yehuda says: Any father who does not teach his son a trade teaches him banditry [listut]. The Gemara expresses surprise at this statement: Can it enter your mind that he actually teaches him banditry? Rather, the baraita means that it is as though he teaches him banditry</strong>. Since the son has no profession with which to support himself, he is likely to turn to theft for a livelihood. This baraita accords with Rav Yehuda’s interpretation of the mishna. (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there is an apparent contradiction to this later on in the masechta daf <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.82b.5?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">82b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי נְהוֹרַאי אוֹמֵר מַנִּיחַ אֲנִי כׇּל אוּמָּנוּת וְכוּ' תַּנְיָא <strong>רַבִּי נְהוֹרַאי אוֹמֵר מַנִּיחַ אֲנִי כׇּל אוּמָּנוּת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם וְאֵינִי מְלַמֵּד אֶת בְּנִי אֶלָּא תּוֹרָה</strong> שֶׁכׇּל אוּמָּנוּת שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם אֵין עוֹמֶדֶת לוֹ אֶלָּא בִּימֵי יַלְדוּתוֹ אֲבָל בִּימֵי זִקְנוּתוֹ הֲרֵי הוּא מוּטָּל בָּרָעָב אֲבָל תּוֹרָה אֵינָהּ כֵּן עוֹמֶדֶת לוֹ לָאָדָם בְּעֵת יַלְדוּתוֹ וְנוֹתֶנֶת לוֹ אַחֲרִית וְתִקְוָה בְּעֵת זִקְנוּתוֹ בְּעֵת יַלְדוּתוֹ מַהוּ אוֹמֵר וְקוֹיֵ ה' יַחֲלִיפוּ כֹחַ יַעֲלוּ אֵבֶר כַּנְּשָׁרִים בְּזִקְנוּתוֹ מַהוּ אוֹמֵר עוֹד יְנוּבוּן בְּשֵׂיבָה דְּשֵׁנִים וְרַעֲנַנִּים יִהְיוּ</p>\n<p>The mishna taught that Rabbi Nehorai says: I set aside all the trades and I teach my son only Torah.

But Torah is not like this: It serves a person in the time of his youth and provides him with a future and hope in the time of his old age.

If he was never trained to do anything he will be drawn to robbery. The Me'iri adds, however, that \"nevertheless, one who teaches his son Torah does not need to teach his son any other trade, because once he has Torah, he has 'flour,' and [when the Beraisa lists the obligations of] teaching Torah to one's son and teaching a trade to one's son, it means that one may teach either one [but not that one must teach both, for either one will save one's son from becoming a robber].\"\nAccording to the Me'iri's explanation, the Beraisa earlier (29a) means that one must teach his son a trade only if he does not teach him Torah. The Divrei Shalom points out that Rebbi Meir argues with that Beraisa when he says that \"one should always teach his son\" a trade. Rebbi Meir apparently maintains that one must be concerned for the possibility that one's son will not be drawn towards Torah learning, and therefore one must always teach his son a trade to ensure that his son will not become a robber.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similary, Rabbi Kornfeld quotes <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.2?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 2:2</a> \"Rabban Gamaliel the son of Rabbi Judah Hanasi said: excellent is the study of the Torah when combined with a worldly occupation, for toil in them both keeps sin out of one’s mind; But [study of the] Torah which is not combined with a worldly occupation, in the end comes to be neglected and becomes the cause of sin\" and explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The SEFER HA'MIKNAH explains that both statements apply, but they depend on a person's level of Bitachon. If a person has a high level of trust in Hash-m, he may depend on Hash-m to supply him with all of his needs while he immerses himself totally in the study of Torah. Not everyone, though, is on that level of Bitachon. One who is not on that level must put forth the necessary efforts to earn a living as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In משנה הלכות חלק יו (Mishneh Halachos, by Rabbi Menashe Klein), it is explained that if a person (child) wants to learn in a Yeshiva, and thus that will be his occupation, he is encouraged to do so. <a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/halacha/3761/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">See here, footnote 11</a> (could not find Mishneh Halachos, volume 16).</p>\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.156.1?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe=Maginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(OC 156:1)</a> states that, as Avot 2:2 teaches us, work in combination with Torah is great, but a person should not make his work primary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Afterwards he should go to his work because any Torah that does not have work with it will end up becoming null and will cause sin because the poverty will remove from him knowledge of his Creator.

    "content": "# Why did the Chachamim cite Pirkei Avot 2:9 and not 4:1 in the dialogue with Alexander?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Pirkei Avot, Ben Zoma teaches us in Pirkei Avot 4:1 this oft-cited maxim,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֶּן זוֹמָא אוֹמֵר, אֵיזֶהוּ חָכָם, הַלּוֹמֵד מִכָּל אָדָם, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהלים קיט) מִכָּל מְלַמְּדַי הִשְׂכַּלְתִּי כִּי עֵדְוֹתֶיךָ שִׂיחָה לִּי</p>\n<p>Ben Zoma said:Who is wise? He who learns from every man, as it is said: “From all who taught me have I gained understanding”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if one finds himself in Masechet Tamid (32a), he is met with the incident of Alexander the Great - when he approached and asked of the Chachamim for the definition of a Chacham.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר להם אידין מתקרי חכים אמרו ליה איזהו חכם הרואה את הנולד</p>\n<p>Alexander said to the Elders: <strong>Who is truly worthy of being called wise? They said to him,</strong> citing a tradition (see Avot 2:9): <strong>Who is the wise person? The one who sees and anticipates the consequences of his behavior.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They cited the mishnah found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.2.9?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot 2:9</a>. The Mishnah there asks for the correct \"path\" one should take.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר לָהֶם, צְאוּ וּרְאוּ אֵיזוֹהִי דֶרֶךְ יְשָׁרָה שֶׁיִּדְבַּק בָּהּ הָאָדָם...רַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן אוֹמֵר, הָרוֹאֶה אֶת הַנּוֹלָד.</p>\n<p>He [Rabban Yohanan] said unto them: go forth and observe which is the right way to which a man should cleave?...; Rabbi Shimon said, foresight.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I ask</p>\n<p>a.) Why did the Chachamim choose the definition from Pirkei Avot 2:9 as opposed to 4:1?</p>\n<p>b.) The Mishnah in 2:9 teaches how one should conduct himself  - אֵיזוֹהִי דֶרֶךְ יְשָׁרָה שֶׁיִּדְבַּק בָּהּ הָאָדָם, it did not specify what constitutes a Chacham. How did the Chachamim understand it as the latter?</p>\n<p>Note: I am aware when I use \"definition\" for \"The definition of a Chacham, it's not it's actual definition, rather a chief characteristic of a Chacham.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Chidushei Agados (Maharsha) asks and answers this question.

When Rabbeinu Yonah died, his daughter was pregnant and later gave birth to a boy. Since the custom amongst Sephardim is to name a grandson after his paternal grandfather, even when the grandfather is alive, the baby should have been named Moshe, the first name of Ramban. Ramban, however, advised naming the child Yonah after the maternal grandfather, Rabbeinu Yonah. The explanation he gave for his advice was based on the posuk brought in the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.72b.2?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 72b</a> וְזָרַח הַשֶּׁמֶשׁ וּבָא הַשָּׁמֶשׁ – The sun rises and the sun sets, meaning before the light of one great scholar is extinguished the light of another great scholar begins to rise.

Even the philosophical works of gedolei Yisrael. For it's a severe prohibition to study them (and it's already explained in many holy books the great prohibition of studying them). For such things are not the portion of Jacob (Jer. 10:16, 51:19), and we have nothing at all to do with them. For we are true to His Blessedness in Emunah alone, without any probing, that His Blessedness created the whole entire world and sustains His world and will in future time renew His world, and for this we don't need philosophy. But the way of these books is to ask questions that appear very difficult, while providing very weak answers. And whoever wants to probe deeper and question that answer, he can refute the answer and render it completely useless. Therefore we may not study these works at all. So in truth all their questions themselves are nothing, and they are mere vanity and striving after wind (Eccl. 1:14).\n<br>\nThe fact that we see there are people who are not drawn to the utterly holy and awesome books such as the Zohar and the Ari's books of blessed memory and so forth, even though they have utterly, utterly wondrous novelties that enlighten the eyes and are sweeter than honey (Ps. 19:9,11), but they are drawn specifically after other matters such as philosophy - Know that this is due to their inborn nature, for their their natural character is a bad from birth, that their were born with an evil temperament, that they cannot tolerate a truly holy thing. (B. Rabbah 28; v. Sichot Haran #32). But having been born with this bad temperament, he needs to endure great bitterness to break this evil temperament and nature. Fortunate is the person born in holiness!\n<br>\nIn the [philosophophical] books are questions regarding the order of creation. They may ask why was a star worthy of being a star, or a constellation a constellation, while other things were consigned to lower realms, such as beasts, animals and so forth, why were they not [humans] the other way around? Or they may ask why the head is what it is and not a foot. Questions like these are discussed at length in such books. But it is all vanity and striving after wind. And there's no need to question His Blessedness, for (Lam. 1:18), \"Righteous and upright is He.\"\n<br>\nIn truth, know this! The whole world is a rotating wheel (B\"B 16b) - like a dreidel. Everything turns around and reverses. Man becomes angel, and angel becomes man. Head becomes foot, and foot becomes head. Similarly everything else in the world reverses, alternates, and swaps, from high to low and from low to high.\n<br>\nFor in truth at the root it's all one. For there are transcendental beings namely angels, that are entirely detached from the material, and there are celestial spheres that are the in the aspect of materiality but their \"material\" is extremely refined, and there is the lowest world, which is completely material. But even though all these three are from different realms, nevertheless at the root, there it's but one. Therefore the whole world is the aspect of a rotating wheel and everything turns and reverses. One moment something is in the upper aspect, the aspect of the head, and another thing is in the lower aspect, the aspect of foot. Then the situation is reversed: head becomes foot, and foot becomes head. A man changes to an angel, and an angel becomes a man. Like we find, that our Sages obm teach us that angels were cast down from Heaven to the base world, entered into physical bodies, and were subject to all worldly lusts etc. Other angels were sent on missions to our world and clothed themselves in physical bodies. Conversely we also find cases where human beings literally became angels. For the world is like a rotating wheel, like a dreidel, everything in motion. For in truth at the root it's all one, as mentioned. (We also find the foot of one is also higher than the head of another. Likewise in the spiritual worlds, the lowest level of an upper world is higher than the highest level of a lower one. But in truth everything rotates as mentioned.)\n<br>\nAnd this is the aspect of playing dreidel on Chanukkah, for Chanukkah is an aspect of the Holy Temple (see L\"M II:7). The main concept of the Temple is the abovementioned, the revolving wheel. The Temple represented \"the superior below and the inferior above” (Pesachim 50a; Bava Batra 10b). For H\"Y lowered His Presence into the Mishkan and the Holy Temple - this is the aspect of \"the superior below.\" Conversely the form of the Temple, it's all engraved on high and this is the aspect of \"the inferior above.\" Which, this is the aspect of dreidel, a rotating wheel, that everything revolves and swaps levels as mentioned. For by Charika/philosophy/logic it's an inconceivable thing, that H\"Y, who is above and beyond all etheriality, should constrict His Shekhina into the vessels of the Temple. \"Behold, the Heaven and the Heaven of Heaven cannot contain You; how much less this Temple?\" (I Kings 8:27). Nevertheless H\"Y showed that he is precisely the opposite of their opinion, for in truth H\"Y the root of his Shekhina is in the Mishkan. Similarly it's inconceivable according to Chakira that mortal man who is a lowly being should have an impression on high. Or how a lowly beast they sacrifice it for an offering that it should ascend \"as a sweet savor\" giving pleasure before His Blessedness, as He spoke and His will be done (v. Rashi Zevachim 46b). And how can desire apply to His Blessedness?! But in truth H\"Y showed, opposite to their mind, for in truth H\"Y placed his Shekhina below in the Mishkan and the Holy Temple, and the beast rises as a \"sweet savor\" etc. So this is the aspect of the superior below and the inferior above, the aspect of the revolving wheel, the aspect of dreidel.\n<br>\nAnd behold, the power/potential of Heyuli (Ether) brought in their [philosophical] books, is the aspect of the intermediate between Koach/potential and Poal/actual. For everything initially is potential and then actualitizes. And when it goes from potential before it comes to actual there is the aspect of Heyuli which is the intedaiate between potential and actual, which is the root of all creation. For they all go out from the potential of Heyuli, for they were all intitially in the aspect of the Heyuli's potential, and creations going out from there which are the three abovementioned aspects, which are: transcendental, celestial, and material - they all change places, transcendental to material and material to transcendental and so forth with all of them, for at the root it's all one as mentioned. And this is the aspect of the letters inscribed on the dreidel, which are Hei, Nun, Gimel, Shin, acrostic of Heyuli, Nivdal/transcendental, Galgal/celestial, Shafal/material, which encompass all creation as mentioned, which all turn in cycles, alternating and revolving, one thing becoming another as mentioned. Which, this is hinted in Chanukkah, which is the aspect of dedication of the Holy Temple, where \"the superior is below and the inferior above,\" which is the aspect of dreidel, the aspect of the turning wheel where aspects interchange as mentioned.\n<br>\nAnd this is the aspect of the Redemption, for this is the essence of the Redemption, which will be in this aspect, namely the aforementioned aspect of turning, the aspect of superior below and inferior above that was in the Holy Temple. Therefore when they left Misrayim immediately at the Song at the Sea they said, \"You brought them and planted them on the mount of Your inheritance... the Temple, H', which Your hands established\" (Ex. 15:17). That they heralded the building of the Holy Temple, for the essence of the Redemption was that the Holy Temple be built, where would be the aforementioned aspect of the revolving wheel, the aspect of superior below and inferior above (which is the essential ultimate purpose), for in truth it's all one, for at the root everything is one, as mentioned. This is also the aspect of the aforementioned letters, which are H N G Sh - acrostic \"Gaalta Shevet Nachalatekha Har Tzion - You redeemed the tribe of Your inheritance, Mount Zion\" (Ps. 74:2) - the aspect of \"You brought them and planted them on the mount of Your inheritance,\" the aspect of the Holy Temple, as in that place was the aspect of the turning wheel which this is the essence of the Redemption as mentioned.\n<br>\nAnd see the essay (LM II:7) on Chanukkah that begins, \"And it came to pass at the end\" (Gen. 41:1) and, \"The merciful one will lead them\" (Isa. 49:10). There he explains also the matter of the superior below and the inferior above, as well as the fact that Chanukah commemorates the rededication of the Temple, see there. And this is the aspect of the Maqifin/surrounding powers discussed in this lesson, namely the aspect of the turning wheel, namely the dreidel, is the aspect of surrounding and turning. Study the lesson carefully and understand. (Chokhmah is the aspect of Heyuli).\n<br>\nReturning to our original discussion: We have no need to enter at all into philosophy, which is anyway strongly forbidden. We just need to keep true to H\"Y in Emunah alone, that His Blessedness created all the worlds entirely, sustains all of them, and will in the future renew His world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also Chayey Moharan #407-425 and many other Chazal, Rishonim and Achronim vehemently against the severe prohibition of studying philosophy even \"Jewish philosophy.\"</p>\n\n\n",

It is <strong>based on foundations of great wisdom and utmost rectification of one's deeds</strong>, which befits every wise hearted man to pursue. For only the wise can truly attain it, as our sages stated: \"an unlearned man cannot be pious\" (Avot 2:5). (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So by way of introduction, chassidus is to be regarded as a more elevated level and requires a degree of wisdom and fixing one's ways to truly experience which is why it makes sense that it comes later in the list of Pinchas ben Yair.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derashot_HaRan.5.61?ven=Derashot_HaRan,_by_Rabbi_Shraga_Silverstein&vhe=wikisource&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derashos HaRan 5</a> it writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולפיכך הסכים ר' פינחס בן יאיר שהחסידות גדולה מכולן, כמו שנאמר חסידות מביאה לידי רוח הקדש וכו', ורוח הקדש גדולה מכולן, רוצה לומר שמי שהגיע למדרגת החסידות ראוי לבא מיד לידי רוח הקדש שתשרה עליו שכינה, כמו שהוכיח מן הכתוב (תהילים פ״ט:כ׳) אז דברת בחזון לחסידך. וזה הפך מרבי יונתן שהזכיר למעלה דאין הנבואה שורה אלא על חכם גיבור ועשיר ועניו וכולם במשה, ולא אמר חסיד. ונראה שהוא סובר כר' יהושע בן לוי, שאמרו שם וכו' ופליגא דר' יהושע בן לוי דאמר רבי יהושע בן לוי ענוה גדולה מכולם שנאמר (ישעיהו ס״א:א׳) רוח ה' אלוהים, לבשר חסידים לא נאמר אלא לבשר ענווים, הא למדת שאחר שבעת הינבאו על הגאולה אמר לבשר ענווים, נראה שהם השיגו המעלה היתרה, ולכן תאוות להם הבשורה, כי עם היות שהגאולה תהיה כללית, אין בשורה מוצאת רק לצדיקים, כמו שדרשו בסנהדרין (דף צח) דרש ר' שמלאי מאי דכתיב (עמוס ה׳:י״ח) הוי המתאווים את יום ה' למה זה לכם יום ה' הוא חשך ולא אור, משל לתרנגול ועטלף שהיו מצפים לאורה, אמר לו תרנגול לעטלף אני מצפה את האור, לפי שלי הוא, ואתה אורה למה לך. ולפיכך אמר לבשר ענווים שלחני, כי עיקר הגאולה לטובתם</p>\n<p>Therefore R' Pinchas ben Yair agrees that piety is greater than them all, like it says; (in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Sotah.9.15?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishah Sotah 9:15</a>) \"Piety brings a person to ruach hakodesh...\" and ruach hakodesh is greater than them all. This means to say; whoever has reached the level of piety is fitting to come to Ruach hakodesh as the shechinah (the Divine presence) rests on them. Like we prove from the verse (Tehillim 89:20) \"Then You did speak in a vision to Your pious ones\". And this is the opposite of Rav Yonasan who mentioned above that prophecy only rests on the wise, mighty, rich and humble, and all of these were in Moshe. And it doesn't mention piety there. And it appears that he holds like Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, as it says there: \"And this disagrees with Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, since Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi says that humility is greater than them all as it says (Yeshaya 61:1) “The spirit of the Lord G-d is upon me...\" It doesn't say to bring good tidings to the pious but rather to bring good tidings to the humble. This comes to teach you that after the prophecies about the redemption it says to bring good tidings to the humble as they have achieved a higher level and therefore the desire of theirs is the news (i.e. good tidings) as this is what makes the redemption more fundamental, and such news is only found amongst the righteous, like they expound in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.98b.17?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 98b</a>: \" Rabbi Simlai taught: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Woe to you who desire the day of the Lord. Why would you have this day of the Lord? It is darkness, and not light” (Amos 5:18)? It is comparable to a rooster and a bat who were looking forward to the light of day.The rooster said to the bat: I look forward to light, as light is an indication of my time to be active. But as for you, why do you need light?\" Therefore it says, \"He has sent me as a herald of joy to the humble\" - since fundamentally, the redemption is for their good</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see from the Derashos HaRan that piety is the mechanism through which the shechinah can ultimately rest which could be why it comes lasts in the gemara, and alternatively, if you hold like the view that humility outweighs everything, this is because the level of humility is regarded as a higher state, in which those who have attained this attribute, receive good tidings of the ultimate redemption which is for their own good and conceivably comes after the stage of techiyas hameisim.</p>\n<p>Rav Tzadok HaKohen writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yisrael_Kedoshim.3.3?vhe=R%27_Zadok_--_Yisrael_Kedoshim&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisrael Kedoshim 3:3</a> writes like the first part mention in the Derashos HaRan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותלמודין חשיב רק המדריגות שביד האדם להשיג בהשתדלותו. וזה מה שהשם יתברך נותן הוא שלימות החסידות הגדולה מכולן שזוכין לה בעלי רוח הקודש</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>i.e. the level of Chassidus is regarded as greater as such people are regarded as individuals imbued with ruach hakodesh.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Just a possible addendum (my own thought process), in the subsequent chapter, the Ramchal writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וזה פשוט, כי הקב\"ה מודד מדה כנגד מדה, ומי שמרחם ועושה חסד עם הבריות, גם הוא בדינו ירחמוהו וימחלו לו עונותיו בחסד, שהרי מחילה זו דין הוא, כיון שהיא מדה כנגד מדתו</strong>, והוא מה שאמרו ז\"ל (ר\"ה י\"ז): למי נושא עון למי שעובר על פשע</p>\n<p><strong>This is obvious, for the Holy One, blessed be He, repays measure for measure (Sanhedrin 90a). Thus he who has mercy and does kindness with others, will also be shown mercy when he is judged and pardoned of his sins with kindliness. For such pardoning is justice, since it corresponds measure for measure to his practice</strong>. This is what our sages, of blessed memory, taught: \"who is forgiven iniquity? he who overlooks transgression [committed against himself]\" (Rosh Hashana 17a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Possibly this is why it potentially outweighs techiyas hameisim as it impacts on a person's merits and ensures Hashem elicits a measure-for-measure response.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Sefer Aftarta: does it need to contain them all?",
    "content": "# Sefer Aftarta: does it need to contain them all?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin%2060a:4-6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gittin 60a</a>, the Talmud gives permission to write a <em>sefer aftarta</em>, a scroll containing just the haftarot for the year (and not full <em>sifrei nakh</em>). The reason given is עת לעשות לה׳ הפרו תורתך.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְרַבָּה וְרַב יוֹסֵף דְּאָמְרִי תַּרְוַיְיהוּ הַאי סֵפֶר אַפְטָרָתָא אָסוּר לְמִקְרֵי בֵּיהּ בְּשַׁבָּת מַאי טַעְמָא דְּלֹא נִיתַּן לִיכָּתֵב מָר בַּר רַב אָשֵׁי אָמַר לְטַלְטוֹלֵי נָמֵי אָסוּר מַאי טַעְמָא דְּהָא לָא חֲזֵי לְמִיקְרֵי בֵּיהּ וְלָא הִיא שְׁרֵי לְטַלְטוֹלֵי וּשְׁרֵי לְמִיקְרֵי בֵּיהּ דְּרַבִּי יוֹחָנָן וְרַבִּי שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן לָקִישׁ מְעַיְּינִי בְּסִפְרָא דְאַגַּדְתָּא בְּשַׁבְּתָא וְהָא לֹא נִיתַּן לִיכָּתֵב אֶלָּא כֵּיוָן דְּלָא אֶפְשָׁר עֵת לַעֲשׂוֹת לַיהוה הֵפֵרוּ תּוֹרָתֶךָ הָכָא נָמֵי כֵּיוָן דְּלָא אֶפְשָׁר עֵת לַעֲשׂוֹת לַיהוה הֵפֵרוּ תּוֹרָתֶךָ</p>\n<p>And Rabba and Rav Yosef both say: It is prohibited to publicly read the haftara, the portion from the Prophets that is read after the weekly Torah portion, on Shabbat, from a scroll containing only the haftarot. What is the reason for this? It is because this type of scroll may not be written, as the words of the Prophets must also be written as complete books ... But that is not so; rather, it is permitted to handle such a scroll and it is permitted to read from it ... in the case of a haftara scroll, [since it is not always possible to write complete books of the Bible, due to the expense,] it is permitted to apply the reasoning of “It is time to act for the Lord; they have nullified your Torah.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Every <em>sefer aftarta</em> (admittedly very few) I've seen contains all the haftarot of the year. According to those opinions that prefer a <em>sefer aftarta</em> over a printed text, is this strictly necessary? Is there a difference between reading out of a <em>sefer aftarta</em> that contains all of the haftarot and any <em>klaf</em> written properly that contains the haftarah for that Shabbat? To reduce rolling around holidays, could you make a scroll with just the holiday haftarot and have another one for just the usual Shabbatot? If your synagogue has no <em>sefer aftarta</em>, but you want to read a given haftarah out of a scroll, could you write/commission just that haftarah on a <em>klaf</em> (because the whole thing is too expensive/takes too long)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to those opinions that prefer a sefer aftarta over a printed text, is this strictly necessary?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Certainly there have been <em>some</em> that have taken up that position, consider the following:</p>\n<p>The Pisqei Rid (Gittin 60a) wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כיון דלא אפשר עת לעשות לה' הפרו תורתך שאין כל צבור וצבור יכולין ליכתוב\nכל הנביאים הילכך מותר ללקט כל ההפטרות ולכתבן בספר א'</p>\n<p>Since it isn't possible, [they declared] \"It is time to act for the\nLord; they have nullified your Torah\", for not every congregation is\nable to write all of the Prophets, accordingly they permitted that <strong>all\nof the Haftoroth be written and collated into one <em>sefer</em>.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to strongly imply that a ספר אפטרתא would need to include <strong>all</strong> of the Haftoroth.</p>\n<p>It is also instructive to look at how communities that historically have retained the practice do so. Tefillah keMinhag Q\"Q Ashkenazim (a practical siddur put out by Makhon Moresheth Ashkenaz, an organization dedicated to preserving Yekkish custom, under R. Binyomin Homburger), p. 100 prescribes that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לאחר שגמרו את גלילת ספר תורה מפטירין בנביאים מענין הפרשה את ההפטרה\nקורא העולה לתורה בעצמו מתוך ספר אפטרתא היינו אוסף של פרשיות נביאים\nהשייכות לשבתות השנה והמועדים כתוב בדיו על גבי קלף האזכרות שבו נכתבו\nלשם קדושה ויש בו ניקוד וטעמים קבועים לו שני עמודים בשני צדיו ונגלל\nכספר תורה הוא עטוף במעיל וכרוך במפה ווימפל' כספר תורה מניחים את הספר\nבארון מיוחד לתשמישי מצוה ולא בארון הקודש א</p>\n<p>After gelilath ha-Torah is complete, we are maftir with the Prophets\nfrom a topic within the parashah with the Haftorah. The oleh to the\nTorah reads it himself from a Sefer Aftartha which collates the\nparshiyoth of the the Prophets that appertain to the Sabbaths of the\nyear and the holidays. It is written with ink on qelaf and the holy\nnames are written with intent of sanctification (l’shem qedushah), it\nis also written with niqud and te'amim, it is set with two columns on\ntwo sides and it is rolled like a Sefer Torah. It is enveloped with a\ncovering and is wrapped with a wimpel sash like a Sefer Torah and the\nsefer is set to rest within an Aron designated for implements of\nmiswah and not in the Aron ha-Qodesh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems then that at least in Ashkenaz (i.e. Yekkish communities), the practice of reading from a Sefer Aftartha was not and is not done from loose, individual parshiyoth.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Daniel Langer writes about his interpretation of the Ritva as follows (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51593&hilite=d929c76f-7412-4b49-a2cc-248b9d769a89&st=%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%AA%D7%90&pgnum=683\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nehorai, pp. 669-670</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובריטב\"א כתב וז\"ל, מ\"ט דלא ניתנו ליכתב, והרי הוא כקורא דברים שבכתב על\nפה [ר\"ל כיון שאין עליו תורת ספר, הרי הוא קורא דשב\"כ שלא מן הספר ואסור]\nואסיקנא דשרי למיקרי ביה ולטלטולי דהא ר\"י ור\"ל מעייני בספרא דאגדתא\nבשבתא משום עת לעשות לה' חפרו תורתך, עכ\"ד. ומדבריו משמע דנידון אחד הוא,\nכיון שלא ניתן ליכתב הלכך גם הקריאה אסורה משום דברים שבכתב אא\"ר לע\"פ, ‏\nוהגמ' מתרצת דניתן ליכתב וממילא אין בו איסור דשב\"כ בע\"פ. צ\"ב נהי דהותרה\nהכתיבה, משום עת לעשות, אבל במה הותרה הקריאה הרי מ\"מ אין על כתיבה כזו\nתורת ספר ובמה הותרה איסור הקריאה בע\"פ שלא מן הספר… והנראה מבואר בדעת\nהריטב\"א, שענין עת לעשות לה' בכאן אינו היתר על איסור כתיבת חלק של ספר\nבלא ספר שלם. אלא, קבעו חז\"ל תורת ספר על ספרא דאפטרתא, שדיבורים אלו\nדהפטרות כל השנה בכללותן קובעים דבר שלם לעצמן, וכיון שזוהי הצורה השלימה\nשל דיבורים אלו הלכך הוי ספרא דאפטרתא ספר שלם, וחייל עליה דין כתבי\nהקודש וקדושתן. ואשר ממילא יוצא מזה דשוב אין איסור דשב\"כ בע\"פ, דאדרבא\nהרי קורא מספר כשר... שבאמת קבעו חז\"ל שספרא דאפטרתא בכללותו יש לו\nשלימות של ספר,ושפיר חייל עליה שם כתבי קודש, וצריך לכתבו דוקא בדיני\nכתיבת כתבי קודש...</p>\n<p>And the Ritva z”l wrote, “why wasn’t it fit to be written? For it is\nlike he is reciting Written Scriptures by heart [which is to say that\nit isn’t being recited <em>b’torath sefer</em> accordingly he isn’t reciting\nWritten Scripture from a <em>sefer</em>] so they answered that it is\npermitted to recite from them and to carry them for R. Yohanan and R.\nSimeon b. Laqish used to look through a book of Aggada on the Sabbath\non the basis of ‘It is time to act for the Lord, they have nullified\nyour Torah’.” And from his words it appears that it is one matter,\nsince it initially wasn’t fit to be written it also was accordingly\nforbidden to be recited from since Written Scripture should not be\nrecited by heart, and the Gemara conclusory answers that it was indeed\nfit to be written and evidently a prohibition of reciting Written\nScriptures by heart would be inapplicable.  This requires some\nexplanation, for the grounds on which the writing was permitted was\n“it is a time to act” but on what basis was reciting permitted? For in\nany event, such a writing wouldn’t be b’torath sefer and so on what\nbasis would the prohibition of reading by heart from a portion of a\nsefer that is not complete, be permitted?... and so it appears that\naccording to the Ritva that the matter of “it is a time to act” is not\na license that permits writing a portion of a sefer that is not\ncomplete. Rather, Hazal designated the Sefer d’Aftartha as being\nb’torath sefer, since they collate the matter of the Haftoroth of the\nentire year within it it is thus a complete sefer (<em>sefer shalem</em>)\nunto itself, and since this is the complete form of this matter the\nSefer d’Aftartha is considered a therefore a complete sefer, upon\nwhich devolves the ruling of kithvei qodesh (Holy Scriptures) and the\nsanctity that appertains. And evidently emerges from this that no\nprohibition of reciting Written Scriptures by heart apply, on the\ncontrary – it is one is reading from a proper sefer (<em>sefer kasher</em>)…\nfor in truth, Hazal designated that the Sefer d’Aftartha is altogether\na complete sefer, and it is well that a <em>shem kithvei qodesh</em>\n(designation as a Scripture) devolves upon it, and it ought be written\nprecisely with according to the rules appertaining to <em>kithvei qodesh</em>\n(Holy Scriptures).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In brief, according to R. Langer‘s reading of the Ritva, a Sefer d’Aftartha is a work designated by Hazal that collates all of the Haftoroth, and as a <em>sefer shalem</em> (comprehensive or complete work) unto itself, it achieves the sanctity and status of other <em>kithvei qodesh</em> that would be proper to read from. One would be hard-pressed to explain how an individually written and read Haftorah could qualify as such, in this view.</p>\n<p>The Arukh ha-Shulhan (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%A4%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 284:2</a>) states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמרינן בגיטין (ס'.): דמן הדין היה אסור למקרי בספרא דאפטרתא. כלומר שהיו\nכותבין כל ההפטרות בקלף בכרך אחד - ואסור לקרות כשאין נביא שלם, כמו בספר\nתורה שאין לקרות כשאין הספר תורה שלימה, אך התירו משום 'עת לעשות לד'\nוגו' '. כלומר כיון דלא אפשר לכל ציבור וציבור לכתוב נביאים שלם, ולכן\nהתירו בכתיבת ההפטרות בלבד... והרי עלינו לעשות כמו שעשו חכמי הש\"ס</p>\n<p>They taught in Gittin (60a) that according to the letter of the law it\nwas forbidden to recite from a Sifra d’Aftartha. Which is to say they\nwould write therein all of the Haftaroth on qelaf in one volume – and\nit was forbidden to read therefrom because it was not a complete [book\nof the] Prophets, similar to a Sefer Torah inasmuch as we do not read\ntherefrom if the Sefer Torah is incomplete, so they permitted on the\nbasis of “it is a time to do for the Lord” etc. Which is to say since\nit was not possible for each and every congregation to write complete\n[books of the] Prophets, accordingly they permitted the writing of the\nHaftaroth alone… and it is incumbent upon us to do as the Sages of the\nTalmud did.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to imply that according to R. Yehiel Mikhel Epstein, Hazal understood the term Sifra d'Aftartha to refer to a work containing all of the Haftoroth bound together in one volume and written on qelaf, and that once they permitted that such be used it is incumbent upon us to do the same.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this correct?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is one explanation of one of the Midrashic mashalim that R. Yaaqov Edelstein gives, that similar to weak oxen that are laden with a heavy burden the ox driver might remove the burden from upon the weaker oxen and place it upon the stronger ox that can handle it. So too God may take the suffering that was due to the nation and place it upon a righteous man.</p>\n<p>So your question then emerges:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Abarbanel_on_Isaiah.53.10.1?vhe=Abarbanel,_Tel_Aviv_1960&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel on 53:10</a> explains the use of the word for sickness (cholim) in this pasuk.\nThe Abarbanel explains that the purpose of the suffering is not to destroy or kill them B'nei Yisrael, but to encourage them to be better and merit redemption. Why then does Moshiach needs to \"bear our sickness\"?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If, as the Abravenel says, the purpose of the suffering is to cause the Jewish nation to turn to God, how does it help if the suffering is shifted to the righteous man? What does that change about the nation such that it is thereby being turned to God? Of what efficacy is it that he should suffer when it is the nation that need to undergo some type of transformation?</p>\n<p>I believe the answer is given in R. Yaaqov Edelstein's explanation of the second mashal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המשל השני בא לבאר שלפעמים הייסורים באים לצדיק כדי ללמד את שאר בני\nהאדם איך צריך לעבוד את ה' אפילו מתוך ייסורים ומאותה סיבה מכה בעל הכדים\nעל הכדים כדי להראות ללקוחות כמה הם חזקים ואיך הם יכולים ליפול לארץ ולא\nלהישבר ומהצדיק שקיבל את ייסוריו ולא בעט בהם ולא כפר בה' ילמדו שאר\nהאנשים לעבוד את ה' בכל מצב</p>\n<p><em>The second mashal comes to explain that sometimes suffering comes upon the righteous in order to teach the rest of humanity how to serve\nGod, i.e. even when suffering, and for that reason the forger strikes\nvessel upon vessel, in order to demonstrate and show how strong they\nare and how they are able to fall down to the earth and not shatter,\nand from the righteous that are subject to suffering that it does not\ndiminish from them nor does it cause them to deny/doubt God, they\nteach the rest of humanity how to serve God under any circumstance.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the messiah, or any righteous person, has suffering shifted to them in the stead of the nation, it still has a pedagogical effect intended to turn the nation to God. Instead of them suffering directly and being goaded to return to God, they instead see a stellar example of how one ought to react to suffering. It is through observing the unwavering commitment of the righteous in the face of adversity, that the nation is taught to cleave to God under all circumstances and is thereby (ideally) turned towards God.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's brought in Likutei Moharan II:8 (R' Nachman of Breslev's final lecture) ideally by prayer and \"shining forth of the sun\" healing and forgiveness of sins are attained and neither Yisrael nor the Tzaddiq/Mashiach need suffer.  But if not then one or the other could suffer, God forbid.  Accordingly some (or the main) perushim for example Rashi (Isa. 53:3) comment the \"suffering servant\" is all Yisrael referred to as one man.</p>\n<p>Summary of Ot 6 (Waw): Revelation of God’s glory, like \"the shining forth of the sun,\" leads to healing and forgiveness of sins, for sins are like darkness. All this is attained by prayer, which gets multiplied by adding a \"neighbor\" (Shakhen) to the prayer congregation. But when the prayer is not fit, the Tzaddiq may suffer for the people, God forbid.\n<br> The lesson is further interwoven and Mashiach is mentioned in Ot 10 (Yud).</p>\n<p>Ot 6 full:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this is like healing, for all the aspects mentioned above are like healing. For revelation of the honor mentioned above is like the shining forth of the sun, like (Isa. 60): \"And the glory of Hashem is risen upon you;\" and through the shining forth of the sun comes healing, as our Rabbis of blessed memory said (Baba Batra 16): \"As the day advances, the illness lightens,\" as is written (Mal. 3) \"And unto you who fear My name shall the sun of righteousness and healing shine forth.\" For the spirit of prophecy which spread out via the revelation of the honor, this is like the healing that comes through the shining of the sun, like (Prov. 18): “The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity.\" And the main revelation of the honor is through the prayer mentioned above, which the clouds, which are the Other Side and the husks, are annihilated and go away, and then converts are made, and the honor is revealed as mentioned above.\n<br>And this is like forgiveness of sin, which comes through much prayer, through which the sun shines forth, through which healing comes. For sin is like cloud, which darkens the light of the sun, for the nature of the sins is they are like darkness, as is written (Isa. 29): \"And their works are in the dark;\" and this is like sickness, for the main source of sickness comes from sins, as our Rabbis of blessed memory said (Shabbat 55): \"There is no affliction without there being sin,\" for it is said [Ps. 89:33]: \"Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their iniquity with stripes;\" for the sins are like clouds, which darken the light of the sun, through which the healing is, and through the prayer the sins are atoned, for prayer atones, for it is in place of offering (Berakhot 26b): as is written (Isa. 56): \"I will bring them to my holy mountain, and make them joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their sacrifices.\" And when the sins are atoned, this is like the clouds being annihilated and going away, like (there 44): \" I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, your transgressions, and, as a cloud, your sins\" etc.; and then it is like the shining forth of the sun, from which is the healing, for the main source of illness is the aspect of sin, which is like cloud and darkness, which darkens the light of the sun, which is like healing; and when the sin is forgiven, it is like the clouding being annihilated, and then the sun shines, and then comes healing as mentioned above, and all this comes through prayer, which atones sins as mentioned above.\n<br>And the main way of prayer, through which sin is forgiven and we are saved from the sickness, comes via adding a neighbor [Shakhen] from Israel, for whenever a neighbor is added from Israel, the prayer greatens and grows very much. And this is the aspect of congregation of Israel. For the more the souls of Israel are congregated and increased together, the house of prayer increases much much more, for three stones build six (i.e. 3 x 2 x 1 permutations of) \"houses,\" and four stones build twenty four houses, five stones build 120 houses etc., until the mouth cannot speak and the heart cannot think, as is brought in Sefer Yetzirah. Hence, the more one stone is added, the houses are multiplied very very much more, multiple multiple times as mentioned above. And the souls are like stones, like (Lam 4): Let the holy stones be poured out etc., and the houses are like “For my house shall be called a house of prayer.” Hence the more one soul is add and increased to the congregation of Israel, the house of prayer grows much more, for now, when one more soul gets added to the congregation, very many more other new permutations, double double and many many times over as mentioned above, and therefore when one neighbor is added from Israel, for example in a place Israelites live, when another Israelite neighbor is added, then the prayer is increased and grown very very much, for one soul was added to the congregation as mentioned above, and through increase of the prayer, through this the sin is forgiven, which is the aspect of healing as mentioned above.\n<br>\nAnd this is aspect of (Isa. 33) “And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick;” for via a neighbor being added, through this we are saved from the sickness as mentioned above, for: “the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity,” for through the neighbor the prayer was increased, and then it is the aspect of forgiveness of sin as mentioned above, and through this comes healing, and the sickness is annulled as mentioned above.\n<br>\n[And know, that sometimes it is the aspect of lifting of sins through the congregation as mentioned above, and sometimes it is, God forbid, the aspect of (there 53): \"Surely he has borne our sicknesses;” for when the congregants are not meritorious, then they do not merit to the aspect of lifting of sins, and then the Tzaddiq is forced to accept upon himself afflictions for the sake of Israel, and only the world gets saved from sickness, but not the Tzaddiq, God forbid, for he accepts afflictions for Israel, like: \"Surely our sicknesses\" etc.; but when they merit and their prayer is fit, then it is like: \"The people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity\" [Isa. 33], and then also the Tzaddiq is saved from illness, like: \"And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity,\" as mentioned above.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Likutei_Moharan/II8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Likutei_Moharan/II8</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%98%D7%99_%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A8%22%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%90_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%98%D7%99_%D7%9E%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A8%22%D7%9F_%D7%AA%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%90_%D7%97</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Posting another answer because - the Gemara there isn't necessarily saying Mashiach has to suffer or bear our sickness.  Reading precisely again, Rabbanan only said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורבנן אמרי חיוורא דבי רבי שמו שנאמר (ישעיהו נג, ד) אכן חליינו הוא נשא ומכאובינו סבלם ואנחנו חשבנוהו נגוע מוכה אלהים ומעונה <br>\nRabbanan said, Chiwwara d'bei Rebbi is his name, for it says (Isa. 53:4), \"Indeed he bore our sickness and suffered our pains\" etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First, the simple context.  Question is asked, What's his [Mashiach's] name? Each of the schools of rabbis bring their understanding of Mashiach's name in terms of their teacher['s name].  Yes for Rabbanan's answer Rashi only comments</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חיוורא דבי רבי - מצורע של בית רבי: <br>\nThe Metzora (an affliction) of Beit Rebbi [Yehuda haNasi]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But why the language \"<strong>Chiwwara</strong> d'bei Rebi/ <strong>White</strong> of Beit Rebbi\"? -- Chiwwar is a color, and is not the simple targum of Metzora (which would be Segira closed i.e. outcast or Metzora, untranslated -- see the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%22%D7%92_%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%90_%D7%99%D7%93_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">targums in Tanakh</a>). Why not \"Metzora d'bei Rebi?\"   The simplest meaning is Rebbi suffered much sickness and affliction.</p>\n<p>The explanation of this name goes utterly far and deep, as is the whole discussion there of Mashiach's names. To start to understand and behold the depth one should see the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/14192\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chidushei Agadot haMaharal starting daf 219 here</a>.\nJust to give some context and a few things I've gathered there:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Shilo's school said his name is Shilo - alludes to Yaakob, for whom the whole world was created, so Shilo is his name because the world and everything in it is Shelo - for him.</li>\n<li>Yinon etc. - ruler, referring to Masiach's inconceivably high status - corresponds to Abraham - (Gen. 23:6) \"You are the prince of God..\"</li>\n<li>Chanina etc. - charm and favor from God - corresponding to Yishak who received this tremendous degree of favor\n(up to here, the three Patriarchs; and Mashiach includes all the levels and has many names as does H\"Y who said \"I am H' your God\" - speaking to different types of people according to their degree)</li>\n<li>\"Some say Menachem\" - Maharal notes the \"some say\" - Who? Just as we want Mashiach and don't know him and can't know him, he's far too exalted, so too he comforts us in the exile etc. hence the Menachem/Comforter.</li>\n<li>Chiwara d'bei Rebi - \"Because Mashiach also includes the intellectual levels... We've already explained Tzaraat is a downturn and loss for a man and he's considered like dead, and since the physical natural world is in opposition to the Mashiach, therefore they z\"l said he sits among the poor that suffer sickensses [picking scabs] like we've explained at length above.  And this that's written here, Chiwara d'bei Rebi is is name, is because Tzaraat because of the loss that comes because he's in Beit Rebi; it's not because of his bad state bringing him Tzaraat, rather his whole business is cleaving to the intellectual Torah which the physical world opposes to the extent there's loss to the intellect from the physical world's side, therefore it was common for there to be Tzaraat by someone who was in Beit Rebi clung to the Torah and Chokhmah. ...</li>\n<li>Also Chiwarra refers to the Zohar the bright light, the intellect the superb that Mashiach will be incomprehensible etc.</li>\n<li>Chiwarra - white - a curtain a veil ...</li>\n</ul>\n<p>... much more there...</p>\n\n\n",

(12:31 second commentary) His problem is the geographical scope to envision the entire nation, to actually have <strong>have left</strong> by the 15th day of the month of which we are celebrating yearly.</p>\n<p>A side note, that we can consider leaving by merely leaving the confines of their dwellings although this doesn't seem likely, as it does state\nוַיְהִ֕י בְּעֶ֖צֶם הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֑ה הוֹצִ֨יא יְהֹוָ֜ה אֶת־בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מֵאֶ֥רֶץ מִצְרַ֖יִם עַל־צִבְאֹתָֽם, translating as that exact date the Jewish nation left the land of egypt.</p>\n<p>The Ibn Ezra continues, with a consideration of the land that must be walked to get to the borders of Egypt. Just the distance from the palace of Egypt and Ramses is six parsaot (24 Kilometers, 7.2 hours by walk).</p>\n<p>Pharaoh had to command his servants, or travel himself to Ramses, then in Ramses, the Jews are spread out (according to Ibn Ezra eight parsaot, over 9 hours of walking distance).</p>\n<p>The entire nation was not traveling by horse but, rather with their feet as stated  וְכָ֘כָה֮ תֹּאכְל֣וּ אֹתוֹ֒ מׇתְנֵיכֶ֣ם חֲגֻרִ֔ים נַֽעֲלֵיכֶם֙ בְּרַגְלֵיכֶ֔ם וּמַקֶּלְכֶ֖ם בְּיֶדְכֶ֑ם, This is how you shall eat it: with your belt on your waist, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand.</p>\n<p>Clearly depicting a nation who is walking, also it's logical that leaving with their entire families could not be done by animal alone.</p>\n<p>Then there is the actual leaving of Ramses to the border of Egypt to consider the 15th day, the day of \"Exodus\". Granted it is close to the border, it still had to have been a couple of hours. (per modern day Pi-Ramesses)</p>\n<p>So you have Pharaoh traveling to Ramses, 1 hour by horse, then you must spread the news to the far ends of Ramses, another hour by horse, then you must leave from the far ends of Ramses to the location at the eastern border of Ramses, 9 hours.</p>\n<p>Then you must leave Egypt, 4 hours. 15 hours give or take. Now Pharoah wakes up at midnight, let's say 12:30. Then he or his forces arrive at the corners of all of Ramses at 2:30 with the news. If the Jews only leave at sunset, it will take them 13 or more hours to reach the border of Egypt. From sunrise to sunset in the spring is 12 hours.</p>\n<p>The Ibn Ezra had this difficulty and surmised that the Jews left at dawn and not sunrise, giving them an extra hour or so. And he fixes another difficulty in\nthe verses\nהוציאך י״י אלהיך ממצרים <strong>לילה</strong> (דברים\nט״ז:א׳),\nוכתוב אחר: <strong>היום</strong> אתם יוצאים\nIs it day or night that they left?</p>\n<p>He gets around this by stating that they left at dawn, which is not day according to the Torah. Which means that they left at night and day, each according to their location. The most westerner Ramses Jews had to leave the first to meet the crowd going east. And the most easterner Jews only had to wait till the crowd amassed to leave.</p>\n<p>Another explanation is:</p>\n<p>Dealing with the verse 12:22 לֹ֥א תֵצְא֛וּ אִ֥ישׁ מִפֶּֽתַח־בֵּית֖וֹ עַד־בֹּֽקֶר׃ stating that the Jewish nation is not allowed to leave there dwellings till dawn.</p>\n<p>Another verse (12:41) בְּבַ֤יִת אֶחָד֙ יֵאָכֵ֔ל לֹא־תוֹצִ֧יא מִן־הַבַּ֛יִת מִן־הַבָּשָׂ֖ר ח֑וּצָה וְעֶ֖צֶם לֹ֥א תִשְׁבְּרוּ־בֽוֹ, prohibiting only bringing the meat outside.</p>\n<p>If you say that this verse is only talking about \"the generations\". Then you must say that it was permitted for them to break the bone of the sacrifice. To answer the difficulty, this verse can be explaining the ruling of leaving your house; as only bringing the meat outside.</p>\n<p>A proof to this, is the verse\nוַתֶּחֱזַ֤ק מִצְרַ֙יִם֙ עַל־הָעָ֔ם לְמַהֵ֖ר לְשַׁלְּחָ֣ם מִן־הָאָ֑רֶץ כִּ֥י אָמְר֖וּ כֻּלָּ֥נוּ מֵתִֽים׃ - The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out of the land in haste, for they said, \"We are all dead men.\"</p>\n<p>This verse is seemingly a response of trepidation and fear on the part of the Egyptians following the devastation. This seems an act in the moment and not something done only once the sun rose; hours later.</p>\n<p>Also this verse states the forceful nature of the Egyptians, to a point that the Jews could not wait to have the Bread rise and baked it right away. It is hard to imagine that the Egyptians had this aggression only in the morning and not right after the chaos.</p>\n<p>וַיֹּאפ֨וּ אֶת־הַבָּצֵ֜ק אֲשֶׁ֨ר הוֹצִ֧יאוּ מִמִּצְרַ֛יִם עֻגֹ֥ת מַצּ֖וֹת כִּ֣י לֹ֣א חָמֵ֑ץ כִּֽי־גֹרְשׁ֣וּ מִמִּצְרַ֗יִם וְלֹ֤א יָֽכְלוּ֙ לְהִתְמַהְמֵ֔הַּ וְגַם־צֵדָ֖ה לֹא־עָשׂ֥וּ לָהֶֽם׃ -\nThey baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they prepared for themselves any food.</p>\n<p>And the verse בְּעֶ֙צֶם֙ הַיּ֣וֹם הַזֶּ֔ה יָ֥צְא֛וּ, That \"day\" they went out of Egypt, can be explained by the final Exodus through the borders and not the beginning of the \"leaving\".</p>\n<p>A side note, the Ibn Ezra also states that Moshe and Aaron were dwelling in the city of Pharaoh at the time of Exodus. Pharaoh got up and went to them, and they traveled to Ramses to deliver the news. I think he is motivated by the verse.\nוַיִּקְרָא֩ לְמֹשֶׁ֨ה וּֽלְאַהֲרֹ֜ן לַ֗יְלָה, and he called to Moshe and Aaron.</p>\n<p>This verse also makes the point of Pharaoh giving the command at \"night\".</p>\n\n\n",

This lent support to the belief that the yeshiva's function was to train rabbis, as did the fact that the <em>rosh yeshivah</em> himself ordained rabbis. The more famous the rabbi who granted it the more valuable the ordination certificate; it was only natural that ordination by the <em>rosh yeshivah</em> would be particularly prestigious. Moreover, R. Berlin was known to be very careful about granting ordination; this made his ordination even more valuable, and also enhanced the importance of Volozhin as an institution in which to receive ordination. The following passage, written by a student at Volozhin in the 1880s, reflects this well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There were some young married yeshiva students who rushed off to R. Naftali Tsevi [Berlin] from other places or yeshivas in order to be ordained by him — and this gave them the title of 'religious rabbi' [in contrast to 'government rabbi']. In truth, every rabbi is authorized to ordain others. But each of them wanted his ordination certificate to bear the signature of a famous authority. The best candidates [for ordination] were prepared to be examined by a more scrupulous examiner. Those who were interested knew in advance that R. Yitshak Elhanan [Spektor] of Kovno was more lenient in his examinations... an ordination endorsed by the name of R. Naftali Tsevi was quite different. The candidates stayed in Volozhin for week after week just in order to get a letter of ordination that he had signed. R. Naftali Tsevi used to test the candidates again and again on their knowledge in all branches of talmudic literature, and the ordinations he issued under his signature were very highly respected by Jewish communities.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(p. 95)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To get a better sense of this, one might do an informal check of ספר אהלי שם by ר' שמואל נח גאטליב (published in 1912).

    "content": "# Are there positive meanings in Torah about horses that relate to Jews? Also dogs?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Sorry if this is basic but if I learned it I forgot it. I think what I'm trying to remember was about Joseph the Righteous, but I will ask more broadly, are there any positive affiliations of Jews in Torah, whether the 12 Tribes, the Patriarchs, Matriarchs, righteous Bondmaids, the Prophets, or Moshiach, with the horse? All the associations I remember well are more negative, such as Bereshit 49:17 (negative in the sense that Dan is compared to the serpent, not the horse, and Dan will bite at the heels of the horse causing it to fall backwards), or Pharoah's chariots driven by horses, or the horse being a representation of the animal desires that the rider must harness and control. But what about positive associations? I recall some translations of Devarim 33:17 saying of Joseph, \"his horns are like the horns of unicorns,\" but are there any associations of Joseph, or associations with any holy figures in Torah as opposed to Pharaoh and so on, with a horse?</p>\n<p>Same question for the dog. The dog usually has negative connotation, even one of the cursed animals I believe, but also the connotation of being all heart, and man's best friend. Are any figures in Torah compared to dogs <em>but in a positive way</em>? Either direct references in Torah, or, for example can we associate Benjamin with dogs since dogs are direct descendants of wolves? (Which is similar to the part of this question about Joseph being compared to a unicorn. A unicorn is a horse with a horn, so does that also create an association with a horse by inference? Except with Joseph, Devarim 33:17 explicitly mentions horns, and horses don't have those, whereas that reconciliation issue would not apply to wolves vs dogs, unless maybe wolves divide the spoil but dogs don't, or something along those lines, but I am not an expert in those animals to answer that.</p>\n<p>Note, when I ask about Torah, I mean all of it including commentaries and Kabbalah texts, not limited to the five books of Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Before we look at if people are likened to horses in a positive way, we first need to see what are regarded as the <em>ma'alos</em>, the relative merits of horses.</p>\n<p>Upon initial research, it would seem that horses are generally seen not in the most positive of lights.

How does the Qinyan work when somebody only writes his name and address on an Internet site?</p>\n<p>I also don't understand why a Qinyan is needed to make the Rav a Shaliach.\nIn several Gemarot we see the concept of \"Qanu Miyado\", or \"Qanu Mineh\", e.g. in Sanhedrin, to give the power of a Bet Din which is not regular, or in Baba Batra for Matnat Shchiv Mera. Rashi explains in BB that it's a Qinyan Sudar. The Qinyan Sudar is called Chalipin and we rule that it's made with an Utensil belonging to the purchaser. In the Qetuba, the Chatan makes a Qinyan Sudar for the commitment of the Ketuba.\nIt's not clear to me what is the source that a Qinyan Sudar is needed to appoint a Shaliach, even for Kitvu Utnu Get.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Dovid Grossman was told by R’ Zalman Nechamia Goldberg that although it is preferable, per the Rambam, to make a kinyan sudar when appointing a shaliach, if it is difficult it is not required.</p>\n<p>A Teshuva from\nDayan Yehoshua Grunwald</p>\n<p>March 4, 2021</p>\n<p>Contemporary poskim permit a person to appoint a rav to sell his chametz over the phone. (See Mechiras Chametz Kehilchaso 17:11.) This verbal communication is sufficient to make the rav his shaliach (proxy) to sell the chametz. Since the seller is not selling the chametz directly to the rav, no formal kinyan is absolutely required. The rav can write down the details of the chametz—value, location, etc.—as they were reported to him.</p>\n<p>One concern with phone authorization is that since no shtar harsha’ah (authorization) is signed, there is no proof of the rav’s appointment, which could possibly invalidate the sale. A remedy would be to additionally sign a shtar harsha’ah and send it to the rav by email or otherwise..</p>\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (Shu”t, Even Ha’ezer 1:43) allows authorization of the rav by mail. Doing so online or by email, text message, or the like would seem no different. An electronic communication that leaves a record is superior to a phone call.</p>\n<p>Another concern with phone or online appointment of the rav as a shaliach is the absence of the kinyan sudar. Some have suggested that a kinyan sudar be made between the seller and a third party. R’ Dovid Grossman was told by R’ Zalman Nechamia Goldberg that although it is preferable, per the Rambam, to make a kinyan sudar when appointing a shaliach, if it is difficult it is not required.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://baishavaad.org/qa-from-the-bais-havaad-halacha-hotline-33/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://baishavaad.org/qa-from-the-bais-havaad-halacha-hotline-33/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>There is no online kinyan - sudar, shtar, mamon, hagbaah, meshiva, vichulu - I see no way how you can do a kinyan online.</p>\n\n\n",

Before pekudei d'zmrah, after putting on tefillin, we read two (consecutive) passages from Shemos which identify tefillin as a commemoration of the yetziyah and imply that wearing tefillin is something we should do at Pesach. It says (Shemos 13) that at Pesach we eat matzah for seven days and then it talks about laying tefillin and then it says this is an annual statute from year to year. It looks like it's saying that tefillin is an annual ritual like eating matzah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The makor for the daily (constant actually) obligation of putting on Tefillin was answered thoroughly here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/59165/why-does-one-have-to-put-on-tefillin-every-day\">Why does one have to put on Tefillin every day?</a></p>\n<p>Now, to address specifically you’re point about Pesach Rabbi Akiva in Menachos (36b) answers you’re question:</p>\n<p>דתניא (שמות יג, י) ושמרת את החוקה הזאת למועדה מימים ימימה ימים ולא לילות מימים ולא כל ימים פרט לשבתות וימים טובים דברי רבי יוסי הגלילי ר\"ע אומר לא נאמר חוקה זו אלא לפסח בלבד\nAs it is taught in a baraita with regard to the end of the passage of the Torah that discusses both the mitzvot of the Paschal offering and phylacteries: “And you shall observe this ordinance in its season from year [miyamim] to year” (Exodus 13:10). This indicates that these mitzvot apply during the days [yamim] but not during the nights. Furthermore, the letter mem, meaning from, in the term: “From year [miyamim],” teaches: These mitzvot apply on some days, but not on all days. This excludes Shabbatot and Festivals, on which phylacteries are not worn. This is the statement of Rabbi Yosei HaGelili. Rabbi Akiva says: This verse, mentioning an ordinance, is stated only with regard to the Paschal offering, and it is not referring to phylacteries at all. Evidently, Rabbi Yosei HaGelili, who says that at night one is exempt from the obligation of donning phylacteries, says that on Shabbat one is exempt as well.</p>\n<p>נפקא ליה מהיכא דנפקא ליה לר' עקיבא דתניא ר' עקיבא אומר יכול יניח אדם תפילין בשבתות ובימים טובים ת\"ל (שמות יג, טז) והיה לאות על ידך ולטוטפת בין עיניך מי שצריכין אות יצאו שבתות וימים טובים שהן גופן אות\nThe Gemara answers: Rabba bar Rav Huna derives the exemption from the obligation to don phylacteries on Shabbat from a different source, the source where Rabbi Akiva derives it from, as it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Akiva says: One might have thought that a person should don phylacteries on Shabbatot and Festivals. To counter this, the verse states: “And it shall be for a sign for you on your arm, and for a remembrance between your eyes, so that God’s law shall be in your mouth; for with a strong arm God brought you out of Egypt” (Exodus 13:9). This teaches that the obligation to don phylacteries applies when the Jewish people require a sign to assert their status as God’s nation, i.e., during the week. This serves to exclude Shabbatot and Festivals, as they themselves are signs of the Jewish people’s status as God’s nation and a remembrance of the exodus from Egypt. Consequently, no further sign is required on these days.\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.36b.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.36b.5</a></p>\n<p>Rabbi Akiva says “it doesn’t say chuka zos except for regarding Pesach”.\nר''ע אומר לא נאמרה חוקה זאת אלא לענין פסח בלבד.</p>\n\n\n",

If the father is a cohen or a levi, or if the mother is the daughter of a cohen or a levi, there is no mitzvah of pidyon haben. Since pidyon haben is dependent on the boy being the first-born of his mother, her pedigree is taken into consideration concerning whether there is a requirement to redeem her son (Bechoros 47a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My understanding of the reasoning behind a pidyon haben is that the firstborn were originally supposed to serve with the Kohanim in the Temple, but after the sin of the golden calf they were substituted by the Leviim. We redeem firstborn from the Kohanim to purchase them back.</p>\n<p>Per this understanding though, the first born of a bas Kohen born to an Israelite father should need to be redeemed, as due to his being a first born he should be serving, but due to his being an Israelite he wouldn’t be.</p>\n<p>I see in Bechoros the rabbis use a drash to explain that this is not the case, but it doesn’t fit into my understanding of the ta’am of the mitzvah. So how does the halacha fit into the ta’am?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara Bechoros Daf 4a (Artscoll top of 4a3) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>In Accordance with</strong> the interpretation of <strong>Mar the son of Rav Yosef in the name of Rava, who said:</strong> The verse describes a <em>bechor</em>\n<strong>as <em>one that opens the womb</em><sup>20</sup></strong>. <strong>The Merciful One made</strong> <em>bechor</em> sanctity <strong>dependent on the opening of the\nwomb<sup>21</sup></strong></p>\n<p><sup>20</sup> Scripture often refers to <em>bechoros</em> with this phrase.\nSee for example *<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9931#v12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers\n3:12*</a></p>\n<p><sup>21</sup> Mar the son of Rav Yosef relies on this exposition to\nexplain why the Leviyah's first born is exempt even if she marries a\nYisrael. The obligation of <em>pidyon haben</em> depends on the \"opening of\nthe womb\", so when the womb that is opened is that of a Leviyah, he is\nexempt regardless of his paternal lineage (<em>Rashi</em>; see further,\n<em>Reishis Bikkurim, Dvar Avraham</em> vol. 3 7:8, <em>Chazon Ish</em> 16:6, <em>Yad Binyamin</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara Bechoros daf 47a (Art Scroll 47a2) says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rav Adda bar Ahavah said: If a Leviyah</strong> [i.e. daughter of a Levi] <strong>bore</strong> a firstborn son, <strong>her son is exempt from five selaim</strong> (pidyon haben)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara then continues</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rather</strong> Rav Adda bar Ahavah refers to <strong>where she conceived from a Yisrael</strong>. But then how could he rule the son exempt from redemption?\n<strong>it is written <em>by their families, according to their father's house</em> <sup>17</sup></strong></p>\n<p>This teaches that children of Jewish Parents are tribally identified\nwith their fathers <sup>18</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemarah continues on 47a3:</p>\n<p><strong>Mar the son of Rav Yosef said in the name of Rava: In fact,</strong> Rav Adda bar Ahava refers to <strong>where [the Leviah] conceived from a Yisrael,</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And as for your question that a child's geneology is determine by his\nfather - which renders the child a Yisrael - the answer is that the\nthere, with respect to a <em>bechor</em> for redemption,\n<strong>it is different, for the verse states: <em>one that opens the womb</em>. The Merciful One made</strong> redemption requirement** dependent on the\nopening of the womb** <sup>23</sup></p>\n<p><sup>23</sup> Hence, although the child is in fact a Yisrael, he is\nnevertheless exempt from redemption, for the womb that he opened was\nthat of a Leviah</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we see that a child is subject to Pidyon Haben only if both the father and the mother are from Yisrael. If the father is a kohen or Levi, then of course so is the child. If the father is a Yisrael but the mother's father is a Kohen or Levi, then the special circumstance of the pasuk applies.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does Matzah contribute to simchas yom tov\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always understood the concept/reason to sometimes be lenient, known as מניעת שמחת יום טוב, a lack or decrease in the joy of Yom Tov, to be referring to cases where a significant portion of the meal will be compromised. For example, a large, tasty roast beef, or a large chunk of the meal. If these things would be forbidden, his <em>simchas yom tov</em> will be decreased, so we are sometimes lenient and permit the issue.</p>\n<p>Perhaps my attitude is wrong, but I would be surprised to apply this concept to matzah. Let's say there's a halachic problem with the matzah, I never would have thought to apply the concept of מניעת שמחת יום טוב to permit it, or even bother mentioning it doesn't apply for some other reason. If so, I was surprised by the following comment of the Noda B'Yehudah (Tinyana, Orach Chaim 80), brought by the Shaarei Teshuva to Shulchan Aruch OC 461:6 and Mishnah Berurah ad. loc. 15:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אם גם בקרימה של המצה יש לו ספק אם זה מיחשב קרימה או לא, הא ודאי שזה ספק כרת הוא וחוששין שמא נתחמצה, <strong>ואין אנו משגיחין לא בהפסד מרובה ולא במניעת שמחת יום טוב ואוסרין אותה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I understand he's <em>not</em> applying this principle in this case, but the fact that he even had to mention it means one could have thought it could apply. He didn't mention for example <em>bittul beshishim</em>, as that's obviously not relevant here.</p>\n<p>So what am I missing? Is it enough that he won't be able to have a <em>halachic seudah</em> that I would call this a diminishment of Yom Tov joy? Or that he won't be able to fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em> of eating <em>matzah</em>? As I said, I thought this principle was a physical pleasure for a spiritual purpose, which I thought is the way to fulfill <em>simchas yom tov</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

I suppose my previous assumption had been that the Tetragrammaton would only occur in Biblical texts, and in later texts quoting or discussing those texts—i.e., where its use is ‘forced’ by fidelity to the Scriptures. This is a use of the Tetragrammaton where it doesn't seem to be required.</p>\n<p>(A related question is why the Tetragrammaton is represented with its vocalization only in this case, and whether that is a common practice.)</p>\n<p>So clearly my assumptions about when the Tetragrammaton would be used/written/represented are wrong. Is it the case that the word can be written relatively freely, just not pronounced? What principles restrict its use in non-Biblical literature?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's used in more \"formal\" texts, where the precise wording and spelling is important, such as the Bible and prayer books (although some prayer books use a double י). But in study books, it usually is represented by a symbol, such as 'ה. This is still an accurate quotation, as everyone knows what that symbol represents.</p>\n<p>The reason this is done is that due to the holiness of the Name and the respect with which it must be treated, it is not proper to place it where it will not be treated properly.</p>\n<p>The vocalization is actually the vowels to the word we say in its place: Adonoi.  This was the common practice for when words were pronounced differently than how they were written.</p>\n\n\n",

Has anyone done this before? Do there exist any formal models which could be translated into software fairly easily? If not, why not, what are the key reasons it can't be done? I know this isn't a software SE, but perhaps if you knew of open source software too that would be helpful, but not necessary.

It is also forbidden to bathe with his rabbi, etc. If he is in the bath before his rabbi, then it is permissible... (please correct this translation if necessary. Hebrew is work in progress)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The main point seems to be preventing sexual thoughts. That seems to be the main point behind the above mentioned explanations. So, to be honest. The Halacha here applies to a father, brother, mother's husband, sister's husband etc... but why does the Halacha forbids this? Because it might arouse certain sexual thoughts. Therefore, it seems to me that this can be applied also to a friend. However, I could not find any mefarshim that discusses my view.</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.51a.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Pesachim 51a)</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Two brothers may bathe together, and there is no concern that doing so is immodest or will lead to sinful thoughts. However, the custom was that two brothers do not bathe together in the city of Kabul (see I Kings 9:13). And there was an incident involving Yehuda and Hillel, sons of Rabban Gamliel, who bathed together in Kabul, and the entire city denounced them and said: In all our days we have never seen that type of conduct. Hillel stole away and went out to the outer chamber and did not want to tell them: You are permitted to do so. He preferred to obey the city residents rather than rule it permitted for two brothers to bathe together.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.51a.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Punctuated_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=Meiri&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Meiri</a> on this Gemara.</p>\n<p>The point in Bereishis 9 is not so much that the sons saw Noach naked, but what happened before, as the mefarshim explains. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.22?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=Sforno&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> for example states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וירא חם אבי כנען את ערות אביו, he saw the shameful deed his son כנען had done to his father Noach when he had castrated him. (according to some of our sages in Sanhedrin 70) According to the historian Berussi Hacaldaii, (compare Genesis 6,9) Canaan castrated his grandfather not surgically, but by some means of sorcery. His father Cham watched his son invoke the witchcraft without protesting or trying to stop him. Disgrace, shame, is also called ערוה, “nakedness.” Compare Ezra 4,14 וערות מלכא לא אריך לנא למחזא “it is not right that we should see the king being disgraced.” Also, in Deuteronomy 21,4 the expression ערות דבר does not refer to either literal nakedness, or to sexual licentiousness, or incest, but refers to “a disgraceful thing.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In the Noah narrative Bereshit 9:23 it says:\n\"וַיִּקַּח֩ שֵׁ֨ם וָיֶ֜פֶת אֶת־הַשִּׂמְלָ֗ה וַיָּשִׂ֙ימוּ֙ עַל־שְׁכֶ֣ם שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיֵּֽלְכוּ֙ אֲחֹ֣רַנִּ֔ית וַיְכַסּ֕וּ אֵ֖ת עֶרְוַ֣ת אֲבִיהֶ֑ם וּפְנֵיהֶם֙ אֲחֹ֣רַנִּ֔ית וְעֶרְוַ֥ת אֲבִיהֶ֖ם לֹ֥א רָאֽוּ\"\nBut Shem and Japheth took a cloth, placed it against both their backs and, walking backward, they covered their father’s nakedness; their faces were turned the other way, so that they did not see their father’s nakedness.\nThis implies to me that the disrespect of Ham was not castration but of looking at his father's nakedness.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the specific act that cooks wheat into matzoh (and where does this leave Wondra)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My housemates saw the hechsher on a box of matzoh, and posed a question that I think I know the answer to, but I don't know <strong>why</strong>.  They asked: could Wondra flour ('precooked' flour) be kosher for passover?  There are a handful of reasons that could end up with Wondra flour being non-KLP, and most of them I can explain, but there are a few steps that I cannot explain, and I think the question mostly hinges on: what is the spec for what causes wheat to become matzoh (and, therefore, eligible to become gebrochts, rather than chametz, in the future)?</p>\n<p>To be clear, Wondra flour is, apparently, \"pregelatinized wheat flour\" -- flour that has been pre-cooked (what is 'cooked' here?), and then ground up.  I <em>believe</em> that the cooking process involves giving the wheat a steam bath.  The result of Wondra flour is that it cannot clump (its protein content is low, and so therefore it cannot meaningfully create gluten structures).</p>\n<p>Here are the halachic questions that I have associated with this, and where my understanding ends.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The flour could fail to be KLP due to a lack of rabbinical supervision to begin with.  Let's assume that the input flour to this process is KLP, and has not touched water from harvest to the beginning of this process.</li>\n<li>The next question is: is steam water?  How much steam is water?  If steam is not water, then it doesn't matter: the flour is still flour -- neither chametz nor matzoh, for our purposes.</li>\n<li>Let's assume that steam is water.  The 'cooking' process could take more than 18 minutes from the time the steam first touches it.  If so, then this Wondra product is clearly sunk: it's chametz.</li>\n<li>But what if the cooking process takes less than 18 minutes?  Is the the Wondra considered to be matzah in such a case?  If so, it can then be ground up and freely re-added as gebrochts.  I think this is the core halachic question I have: <strong>what is necessary for wheat and water to be considered matzah?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>My interpolation from my understanding of halacha is probably that this is the point at which the intent and results would come in to play.  The fact that Wondra cannot be used to make cakes is an indication that Wondra probably <em>could</em> be made in a KLP fashion, if it could be made in 18 minutes.</p>\n\n\n",

On the rare occasions when the Rabbi is out of town, he will invite a congregant or a visiting scholar to give a d'var torah in his stead.

However, if the invited speaker is a woman, she instead speaks at the <em>end</em> of Musaf, right before Adon Olam.</p>\n<p>Based on this established practice, I infer that there are some halachic issues with having a woman speak to the congregation specifically at that point in the service -- issues that are obviated by having her speak after the service is over.

Kinda the inverse of why some rabbis intentionally speak before mussaf so as to keep the congregants \"captive audience\" as otherwise if they would speak before adon olam I suspect that the population would greatly decrease in short time due to the fact that the service is mostly over and they are not missing too much of it vs. the idea of having to listen to unsolicited words prior to eating any food yet.

In fact, you would be hard pressed to find a single rishon who was a Young Earth Creationist.</p>\n<p>The Ramban says that Bereishis 1:1 describes creation yeish mei'ayin (ex nihilo; something from nothing), and then untold time goes on before the hyle (substance) gets its current forms. But Bereishis 1:2 onwards tells the story after that time.</p>\n<p>Rashi (1:1, 2:4) says that none of the chapter is about the order of creation.</p>\n<p>The Rambam (Moreh Nevuchim 1:30) says the six \"days\" are logical steps in Creation and not a chronological sequence. Interestingly, the Haqdamah to the Zohar (4b-5a) says something similar, identifying the days with the 6 ketzavos (directions? sefiros of emotion? all of the above?).</p>\n<p>And while the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.1.3.2?ven=Commentary_on_the_Torah_by_Ramban_(Nachmanides)._Translated_and_annotated_by_Charles_B._Chavel._New_York,_Shilo_Pub._House,_1971-1976&vhe=On_Your_Way&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban says</a> the 6 days are literally days, he also says they correspond to the following 6 millennia (and to the 6 emotional sefiros). Rav Eliyahu E. Dessler (“Yemei Bereishis veYemai Olam“, vol II pp 150-154; “Zeman veHishtalshelus”, vol IV, pp 113) shows how the Ramban means that they are actually the same stretch of time. That experiencing time as a line from past to present to future is part of the human condition since eating the Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge and that limitation didn't exist yet. So, we cannot understand how the same stretch of time can be literally one day and also a millennium that seems to be after the day, but that's because of the fruit.</p>\n<p>This is consistent with the Maharal who says that while the pesuqim literally describe the history of creation, we cannot picture what existence during creation was like. So, if you think the literal description is of a single creation event that takes 5 days, you're mistaken. No human understanding, literal or figurative, will be correct.</p>\n<p>While that may not be what the Ramban really meant, R Dessler didn't think it was kefirah to say that the age of the universe is \"only\" 6,000 years in one way of looking at time. He explicitly writes that in terms of history, both 6 days and the scientific findings are correct. Just that the 6 days perspective is more usable for our task in life of spiritual growth, and the scientific one is only good for science -- thinking it is primary shows misplaced priorities.</p>\n<p>And in either case, the missing time thing would still mean the Ramban is consistent with an old earth.</p>\n<p>Similar multiple creation times ideas show up in Bereishis Rabba, which describes Hashem creating worlds before this one and destroying them. Based on which, the Tif’eres Yisrael. He cites an opinion of the tannaim, a central theme amongst the more kabbalistically inclined rishonim, that Hashem created worlds and destroyed them before this one. Dinosaur bones and starlight are legacies of these earlier worlds. The Tif’eres Yisrael did not say anything about evolution, just that this earlier time explains what the fossils are fossils of. In Techeiles Mordechai, R’ Shalom Mordechai Schwadron speaks laudably of the Tif’eres Yisrael’s resolution.</p>\n<p>In Gen 1:1, G-d creates ex nihilo (matter from nothing). Then, before verse 2, these other worlds (in this opinion, epochs) rose and fell. Then, there was “chaos and emptiness” from which our world emerged. The universe as a whole, even the planet, can therefor be older than 5758 years.</p>\n<p>Since current theory is that the world started as a singularity — IOW, not within the purvey of science, it is all a matter of faith if the ex nihilo was with the intent of the Creator or not.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan quotes R’ Yitzchaq meiAkko (a student of the Ramban) who concludes from the Zohar that the first creation was 15.8 billion years ago — the age astronomers and physicists seemed to be converging on in the 1980s and 1990s, given multiple ways of measuring the age. It is unclear that this is truly the intent of R’ Yitzchaq meiAkko, but that’s Rabbi Kaplan’s take. The original lecture to AOJS, which is more complete and persuasive than the mention in his NCSY book, is <a href=\"https://www.lulu.com/en/us/shop/rabbi-aryeh-kaplan/the-age-of-the-universe-a-torah-true-perspective/ebook/product-21407157.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">available for free from the Lulu storefront</a>. This is built on an idea discussed by Rabbeinu Bachya and numerous other kabbalistically inclined rishonim, that of our world being one of a cycle of shemittos, so that there is history and time before our universe.</p>\n<p>In contrast, I couldn't find a single source for Young Earth Creationism written before the late 19th century CE.</p>\n\n\n",

As such you can maintain the plants (e.g., pulling weeds or trimming dead branches) if the goal is to avoid future damage - but not if it is done to strengthen the plants.</p>\n<p>The same ruling applies to plants under an awning or hanging if they are drawing their sustenance from the ground and to indoor plants in perforated pots (according to many).

However, planting in a flowerpot that is fully closed underneath, called an atzitz she’aino nakuv, is forbidden only because of rabbinic injunction and does not involve a Torah-prohibited violation of Shabbos. The same categories usually apply to agricultural mitzvos: plants in a pot with a hole in the bottom are equivalent to being in the ground itself; those whose bottom is completely sealed are included in agricultural mitzvos by rabbinic injunction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see the type of container has bearings on the plants halachic status. When the pot is perforated and placed on the ground the nutrients and water etc. can pass freely to and from the plant and thus should therefore be avoided.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://beithorah.co.il/en/rabbis/hagaon-rav-simcha-eliezer-weiss/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliezer Simcha Weiss</a> has a useful document <a href=\"http://www.rabbiweisz.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/shmita.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which provides a full overview.

However post-Talmudic decisors/interpretors widely did not read it as endorsing such (see Rabbenu Hananel Yoma 18b and Meiri Beth ha-Behira who read the scenario as one wherein sexual intercourse did not take place). There was some notable exception, such as R. Yaaqov b. Sevi Emden (She'eloth Yabes, vol. 2, no. 15), who saw it as evidence of justification for concubinage. Some have questioned whether the Talmudic passage is altogether a later spurious interpolation intended to mock (Hiddushei ha-Riṣad, Zevahim vol. 4, p. 88). Of significant note is that Rabbenu Saadia Gaon, who lived in an Islamic context, stated that such temporary marriages are biblically forbidden as prostitution (Perushei Rasag 'al ha-Torah, p. 180 and Qafih ad loc fn. no. 3).</p>\n<p>Basically, it is questionable whether such marriages were ever permitted, many early post-Talmudic sources seem to have been against it, and in the modern era it is an altogether unknown practice in the Jewish world.</p>\n\n\n",

Why do you always read negative things about Edom?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The \"hatred\" of Edom is in reference to the behavior of the Edomites. In the prophetic context, the identity of Edom is bound up in those of its actions.</p>\n<p>In Numbers 20:14-21 we see that the Edomites would not allow the Israelites safe passage through its territory, it would not allow it water, and came out threatening Israel by its swords. We see that the Edomites continued to have skirmishes with the Israelites for centuries after (as documented in Samuel, Kings and Chronicles). Eventually they went so far as to partake in Nebuchadnezzar's vicious destruction of Jerusalem and the slaughter of its Jews (Obadiah 1:11-14, Psalms 137:7). Obadiah therefore foretells of recompense for the dastardliness of the Edomites (1:15), and so too do the other Prophets (Isaiah 34:5-8, Jeremiah 49:7-22).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What if I'm descended from Esau, does G‑d hate me? Wouldn't that be unfair?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do you identify with the House of Edom? Which is to say, do you dignify its ways which are in opposition to that of God? Do you embrace them as your own? Are you set upon the destruction of the Jewish nation and what it represents? If not, in what meaningful way would be a descendant of Edom? It would indeed seem to be unfair if one were <em>indiscriminately</em> cast in with those one is opposed to. I see nothing to suggest that however is the case.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As you can see, it says that none of the house of Esau will survive.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <em>House</em> of Edom will be destroyed, i.e. its institutions, its ideological/political sway over the world. It does not say that any biological descendant therefrom will be destroyed. On the contrary our Sages have taught that it is only those that perpetuate the ways of Esau to whom the passage applies.</p>\n<p>Avodah Zarah 10b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Once he [Antoninus] asked him [Rebbi]: 'Shall I enter the world to come?' 'Yes!' said Rebbi. 'But,' said Antoninus, 'is it not written, There will be no remnant to the house of Esau?' 'That,' he replied 'applies only to those whose evil deeds are like to those of Esau.' We have learnt likewise: There will be no remnant to the House of Esau, might have been taken to apply to all, therefore Scripture says distinctly — To the <strong>House of Esau</strong>, so as to make it apply only to those who act as Esau did.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I heard that Edom is Christianity <em>today</em>. But I know many Christians who are very nice people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context in which the identification of Christianity with Edom was made is one wherein the Roman Empire and Latin Christianity were inextricably intertwined. As history progressed this entanglement has become somewhat diminished. Insofar as aspects of modern Christiandom or its individuals continue to perpetuate the ways of Esau, the passage in Obadiah would apply. For those that reject the ways of Esau and do not oppose the Jewish nation and what it represents, the passage would be inapplicable.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, how is this done?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First question, \"Is there such a thing as a soul tie between poeple, be it family or otherwise?\":</p>\n<p>In תורת מנחם (Torat Menachem), the Lubavitcher Rebbe explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ties between two people, and certainly those between a husband and wife or between parents and children, are chiefly of a spiritual, not of a material, nature. That means that a bullet, a grenade, or a disease can affect the body, but not the spirit or the soul. The physical bond between two persons can be broken…but not their spiritual relationship.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote can be found in the article <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/3240784/jewish/Chapter-3-Soul-Connection.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Chapter 3: Soul Connection\" from the book \"A Time To Heal\" written by Rabbi Mendel Kalmenson</a>. I unfortunately could not find the original quote from תורת מנחם, might add that in later.</p>\n<p>So, according to this explanation given by the Rebbe, there is a (mainly) spiritual bond between people, and then mainly a husband and wife. Besides this spiritual bond, there is  a physical bond, e.g. a marriage, and that can be broken between two persons. However, there still excists a spiritual bond between those two persons. That bond cannot be broken.</p>\n<p>Similary, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.3.7b.5?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe=New_Torat_Emet_Zohar&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar HaKadosh</a> explains that a male without a wife is called \"half\". Only when the male marries the wife, they are considered \"one body\".  The same is true with the female. Both are considered \"half\" until they marry eachother, then they are \"one\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The following was taught in the section of \"Hear oh Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One\" (Deuteronomy 6:4) What is one? This is Knesset Israel which is unified with the Holy One, blessed be He. As R' Shimon says: the union of male and female is called one. The place where the female dwells, this is called one. What is the reason for this? Because male without female is called half a body, and half is not one. When two halves of the body are connected, they become one body and then they are called one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And, see  <a href=\"https://www.sie.org/templates/sie/article_cdo/aid/2313893/jewish/Part-I-Between-Husband-and-Wife.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"The Jewish Home - Volume 1  Section I: The State of Marriage\nPart I: Between Husband and Wife\"</a> (Sichos in English):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In other words, according to the Zohar, husband and wife are in essence one soul, half of which is clothed in the husband’s body, while the other half is clothed in the wife’s body. Alone, husband or wife merely consists of half a soul. Only “when the two halves — the husband and wife — unite” do they possess one whole and complete soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I will add the original explanation from the Rebbe in Toras Menachem when I find it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>We find a similar term in the Bible:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking to Sha᾽ul, that the soul of Yehonatan was knit with the soul of David, and Yehonatan loved him as his own soul. [Samuel I 18:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However that just seems to be another way of saying that you love someone. Presumably if the people stopped liking each other, no more tie. I'm not aware of any source treating \"soul ties\" as an independent metaphysical \"thing.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# 1Samuel 16,12 on David\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the translation of <em>1Samuel</em> 16:12 of <em>The Koren Jerusalem Bible</em> it translates that David: \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.12?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">was ruddy, with fine eyes, and good lookin</a>\".Some rabbinical comments, however, such as <em>Or Hachayim, Isaiah Horowitz, Rabbenu Bahya, Daat Zkenim</em>, <em>etc</em>. they believe that the Hebrew term admoni does not refer to the color of the hair, but to the cheeks of David.For example, <em>Or Hachaym</em> writes \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.49.5.1?ven=Or_Hachayim,_trans._Eliyahu_Munk&vhe=On_Your_Way_&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">In <em>1Samuel</em> 16:12 the prophet describes David as admoni, red-cheeked, that is, warm-blooded</a>\" (<em>Or Hachayim, <em>Gen</em></em>. 49.5.1). The red color (<em>admoni</em>) therefore does not refer to the hair  (<em>śear</em>) is not actually mentioned as in the specific case of Esau (<em>Gen</em>. 25,25), but to the cheeks, that is to the face (<em>a yin</em>) of David. In the Hebrew text we have: \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wehu admoni im-yepheh einayim wetov ro'i.</a>\" However, I am not sure, and some notes say that the meaning is uncertain and in fact the official translations are conflicting. For example in <em>Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures</em>, he translates as follows: \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.16.12?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">He was ruddy-cheeked, bright-eyed, and handsome</a>\". The question is: according to <em>1 Samuel</em> 16:12 does it refer to the color of the cheeks or of the hair?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemuel_I/16.12#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Shemuel_I/16.12#e0n6</a> goes through a number of commentaries and most of them imply that it is the physical makeup rather than the hair alone. Thus David was ruddy in general make up and showed a physical health and well being in general. This is similar to the way Eisav was considered. Note that Eisav was not circumcised as an infant because they worried that the extreme redness at birth implied that he could not be cut at eight days. Thus Admoni is a ruddiness due to the blood circulating rather than the color of the hair.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The simple answer is that the term is more evocative of his nature and not his physical appearance.</p>\n<p>Whilst the Metzudos Dovid explains somewhat ambiguously that \"אדמוני\" simply means:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מראה אדום</p>\n<p>Of red appearance</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Many commentaries view this redness as being emblematic of his nature, in other words pointing to that fact that he had a streak of red-bloodedness.

He therefore answers that the juxtaposition of writing \"אדמוני\" along with the fact that he was \"bright-eyed and handsome\", illustrates that whilst Dovid  was overcome by this sense of \"redness\" and nature to shed blood, on the other hand, it also shows his good side because he had beautiful eyes and good looks - thus it serves to demonstrate that his natural disposition was one that was sharp-sighted and good-natured - in other words he kept a measure of equilibrium despite his propensity for violence.</p>\n<p>This theme is also explored by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Toldot%2C_Torah_Ohr.54?ven=Shney_Luchot_Habrit_by_Rabbi_Eliyahu_Munk&vhe=Shenei_Luchot_HaBrit,_based_on_Amsterdam,_1698_ed._Part_III&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah Hakadosh, Torah Shebichsav, Toldos, Torah Ohr 54</a> who also notes that same expression used by Esav.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This אדמוני will eventually emerge purified and holy, a reference to the David who is also known as אדמוני. We read in Samuel I 16,12 that David is described as אדמוני עם יפה עינים וטוב ראי, \"ruddy cheeked, bright-eyed and handsome.\" The first person to be described as אדמוני was Esau; it is therefore hardly a compliment to David to be similarly described. The essential difference is that whereas Esau was עין רע, represented all that is negative associated with the eye, David was the reverse, and is therefore described as יפה עינים. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The reason being, because prior to entering the water he was still a non-Jew and could not say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּרוּךְ ... אֲשֶׁר קִדְּשָׁנוּ בְּמִצְוֹתָיו וְצִוָּנוּ עַל הַטְּבִילָה</p>\n<p>Who has commanded us concerning immersion (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Pesachim.7b.12.1?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos s.v. <em>al hatevillah</em> - Pesachim 7b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, so too with the case of seder night, it is only after we complete re-telling the story of the Jewish peoples' liberation from slavery, that we feel like we were personally there and can only make a bracha after this point but not before.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>BH</p>\n<p>In accordance with the minhag hamakom,I will attempt to answer my own question.</p>\n<p>In a Chabad hagadah which has notes from the Rebbe and other Chabad rebbeim (could be the Rebbe's hagadah itself but not entirely sure), at the beginning of maggid it has a note explaining that (can't remember all of the names but I'm pretty sure) that the Rebbe rashab asked his father, the Rebbe maharash, why we don't say a brocho on maggid (for telling over yetzias mitzrayim specifically), and he replied that he didn't know</p>\n<p>Then it says that the Rebbe maharash asked his father the tzemach tzedek, who also said he didn't know, who asked the mittler rebbe, who at first gave the answer of the Rashba, that it's already included in kiddush when we say \"zaicher liyitsias mitzrayim\", but that wasn't a fully satisfying answer since other brochos for mitzvos aren't simply included in other brochos in that way</p>\n<p>Then it says that the mittler rebbe asked the Alter Rebbe who also said he didn't know</p>\n<p>So how could I, or anyone else, possibly answer, if all of these torah giants, who know all commentaries and rishonim etc didn't know?</p>\n<p>What's the one thing that all cases had in common?</p>\n<p>They involved a son asking his father a question on pesach night, of why we do something differently</p>\n<p>Perhaps this is itself the reason that the chochomim didn't institute the same kind of brocho for sipur yitsias mitzrayim: in order for the children to ask why this brocho is different than all other brochos</p>\n\n\n",

In our times, when there is a war, this is exactly what happens. The \"leaders\" will literally lead the people at battlefront, while watching \"from behind\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנכי נצב על ראש הגבעה, “I will position myself on the summit of the hill;” Moses wanted to be able to follow the course of the battle while personally watching, and even more, so that the Israelite fighters could see their leader and be encouraged by this visual contact. We find a verse in Joshua 8,26, where the latter, by that time the leader of the Jewish people, emulated Moses’ example by not lowering his spear until victory in battle had been secured. It is a common practice in war that one of the popular heroes positions himself on a hill or tower, holding aloft a flag in order to serve as encouragement to the troops seeing that the flag is a common symbol. As long as the troops can see their flag being held aloft they derive encouragement from this. If for some reason the troops fail to see the flag being held aloft they become demoralised. Moses’ staff in this instance served as a flag for the Israelites fighting Amalek.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From this it would seem that Moshe Rabbeinu wanted to encourage the men fighting, while being posisitoned on top of a hill, so that everyone could see him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moses’ staff in this instance served as a flag for the Israelites fighting Amalek.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chizkuni sees it this way, but the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.9?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> on the other hand, says something else:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reason that Moses commanded Joshua to fight with Amalek was so that he [Moses] might pray with the raising of hands on the top of the hill.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Instead of \"encouraging the fighting men\", Moshe Rabbeinu ascended the hill/mountain in order to bless them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He went up there so that he might see the Israelites engage in battle and train his sight on them to bring them blessing. They too, upon seeing him with his hands spread heavenward and saying many prayers, would have trust in him, and they would thus be endowed with additional valor and strength.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similair vein to what the Ramban writes, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.17.9?ven=The_Contemporary_Torah,_Jewish_Publication_Society,_2006&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> on this pasuk explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moshe said to Yehoshua. Moshe’s special abilities lay in the realm of the supernatural. For this reason he conducted the wars against Sichon and Og personally, since those wars were openly miraculous. On this occasion, by contrast, Hashem hid His face so that they were required to do battle in a natural manner. Therefore Moshe delegated command to Yehoshua, who had been chosen by Hashem to lead the conquest of Canaan, which was to be accomplished through natural wars accompanied by hidden miracles. Nevertheless, Moshe helped in the battle against Amaleik through prayer and urgings to repentance in order that they would enjoy Divine favor. With the staff of Hashem. The staff was called by this name, rather than “Moshe’s staff,” whenever Hashem performed through it a miracle for which the B’nei Yisrael were not worthy, solely to display His power.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47091&st=&pgnum=270\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Be'er Yosef</strong> (Exodus 18:1)</a> has a creative approach to this question:</p>\n<p>His explanation is based on understanding the true catalyst to the war with Amalek. Hashem caused the war to happen in order to strengthen the foundations of the Jewish people’s faith. They were suspicious that perhaps all the miracles they had experienced in Egypt were all Moshe’s doing. Perhaps he was just a really powerful sorcerer. Or maybe his staff had magical properties.</p>\n<p>To remove all these mistaken ideas, Hashem engineered the nation of Amalek to attack. This wouldn’t be a normal battle, with the nation’s leader at the forefront. He was to literally sit this battle out, as Moshe sat on a high mountain, with the staff in his hand. The people quickly realized that their success in the battle was solely a result of their allegiance to Hashem (See Rashi to Numbers 21:8, quoting Rosh Hashanah 3:8). Moshe wasn’t involved at all. With that, they had no doubt that Hashem was entirely behind their salvation from Egypt.</p>\n<p>Translation taken from a larger piece of mine, <a href=\"https://parshaponders.com/yisro-5779/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In פרשת עמלק, where according to חז\"ל, the word \"רפידם\" hints to a theme replete with the idea of רפיון ידים from Torah or mitzvos, <strong>perhaps the idea is to wean כלל ישראל away from dependence on their leader Moshe and more toward direct reliance on השם</strong>.</p>\n<p>As Rashi mentions at the end of this section, it is hinted that there will come a time where Moshe won't be the leader and Yehoshua will lead them into Israel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ושים באזני יהושע</strong>...כאן נרמז לו למשה שיהושע מכניס את ישראל לארץ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So they shouldn't even depend on special access that יחידי סגולה like Moshe had to השם through use of the שם המפורש.</p>\n<p>The end goal being to show that (as the pasuk says) this a מלחמת השם and if כלל ישראל follows השם with their eyes and most importantly with their hearts, then it will be a מלחמת השם and they of course will be victorious.</p>\n<p>The key line here from חז\"ל is in the mishna in Rosh Hashana 3:8 as a side comment re: the previous mishna (re: כוונת הלב בתקיעת שופר)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והיה כאשר ירים משה ידו וגבר ישראל וגו'</strong>: וכי ידיו של משה עושות מלחמה\nאו שוברות מלחמה? אלא לומר לך: <strong>כל זמן שהיו ישראל מסתכלים כלפי מעלה\nומשעבדין את לבם לאביהם שבשמים, היו מתגברים; ואם לאו, היו נופלין</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

How the Moshiach is Halachicly different from just another Davidic king or from his own status before he started the wars?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam gives us signs by which to identify a proper messianic candidate. If that person performs the enumerated functions (versed in Torah, engages in commandments, enjoins Israel to follow the Torah, fights on our behalf), then it is <em>appropriate</em> to follow their lead, as they are בחזקת משיח (presupposed as the messiah).</p>\n<p>The final determination as to whether that individual is in fact משיח is whether they finish the job (i.e. defeats our enemies, builds the Temple and gathers in the exiles).</p>\n<p>All of the laws (obligations, privileges, etc.) that devolve upon a king, as outlined through the sefer, would not devolve upon such a person unless they were in fact also actually a king (ideally designated so by a court and prophet). Before such time an individual that is בחזקת משיח but that is not also confirmed as a king would have the same rights and privileges as any other member of the Jewish nation. Importantly it is appointment as a king that has an effect on \"halakhic status\" (his privileges/duties and the relationship of others to him).</p>\n<p>Being בחזקת משיח is more of a barometer by which we may collectively measure a man but does not inherently have halakhic import it is only the additional aspect of actual kingship that does. Furthermore, it would seem that there is some subjectivity in determining whether one is properly identified as being בחזקת משיח (i.e. assessing whether they fit the bill), and accordingly R. Shimon b. Yohai denied the candidacy of Bar Kokhba and R. Aqivah affirmed it. It is only once the individual succeeds or fails that the hazaqah (presupposition) can either be refuted or confirmed.</p>\n<p>In terms of applicable law, the משיח (messiah) is no different than any other king. Though it is possible that a future court (may it speedily return) may adjust certain aspects of the functioning of the monarchy. This however is as of yet to be determined.</p>\n\n\n",

He previously recommended taking certain medicines with wine, but since his Muslim readership could not drink wine, he also advocates using this aniseed-distilled drink (in the original Arabic: أنيسون). Here's how Moshe Ibn Tibbon translated it into Hebrew in the 13th century (<em>Samei Hamavet Ve-Harefuot Kenegdam</em>), with an English translation below by Gerrit Bos, a scholar of medieval Jewish medicine:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והרפואות אשר זכרו הרפואים, מהם מה שצוו לשתות ביין והם במים ומהם בחומץ ומהם בחלב. ואני רומז על מי שנשכו מי שלא ידע מינו, שיעיין ענינו... ואם מצא קור חזק, כמו מי שימצא אצל מי שנשכו עקרב, שיבחר מן הרפואות הן, מה שליקח ביין.\nומי שלא יותר לקיחת היין, יקחם ב<strong>תבשיל האניסון</strong>, כי <strong>האניס</strong>, הסכימו כל הרופאים, שהוא מועיל מכל ארסי בעלי חיים</p>\n<p>Some of the remedies mentioned by the physicians should, as they order, be imbibed in wine, some in water, some in vinegar, and some in milk. As for myself, I advise anyone who was bitten or stung by an unknown sort of animal to examine his condition....If he feels a severe cold, as someone feels who was bitten by a scorpion, he should choose from those remedies which are taken in wine. If someone is not allowed to take wine, he should take what he selects from them in an <strong>anise decoction</strong>, because all the physicians agree that <strong>anise</strong> is beneficial against all animal poisons.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the treatise, the Rambam repeatedly use the phrase that \"those who cannot drink wine should use an anise decoction,\" strongly implying an alternative alcoholic drink.</p>\n<p>Since we're already on the subject, in his Treatise on Asthma (<em>Maqāla fī al-rabw</em>), the Rambam equates wine with <em>nabīdh</em>, a general term for intoxicating beverages, which \"fill the head and are harmful to the brain and heat it...to the point of drunkenness.\" Despite these warnings, the Rambam gives a recipe for a <em>nabīdh</em> in his Treatise on Marital Relations (<em>Fī l-jimāʿ</em>), again translated here by Gerrit Bos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>يؤخذ سلجم وجوز وتين و يطبخ طبخا جي ّدا و يص ّفى\nويلقى في ذلك الماء زبيب من ّقى من عجمه ويطبخ طبخا جيّدا ويص ّفى ويلقى في ذلك فانيذ ويترك  حت ّى يغلي و يصير نبيذ و يشرب</p>\n<p>Take turnips, walnuts, and figs; cook them well in water, strain this and throw pitted raisins into the water. Cook this well, strain it and throw <em>fānīdh</em> [a kind of chewy sugar-candy] into it, and leave it on the fire until it boils and turns into <em>nabīdh</em>; drink this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And yet another:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>واعلمأ ّنالأطبّاءإنّمايطلقونشرابالمفرحعلىشرابلسانالثوروحدهوقدجرّبواالمتق ّدمونهذا وهو إن يلقى شيء من لسان الثور في النبيذ و يتركه حت ّي تخرج قوته فيه فيجدوه يز يد في الفرح ج ّدا ويقوّي على الجماع. وإذا أخذ ماء الحديد المعلوم وغلي فيه لسان ثور أربعة دراهم قشر أتر ّج نصف\nأوقية قرنفل مرضوض نصف درهم ومزج بهذا الماء رطلين خمر أو رطل عسل نحل لمن لم يستطيع الخمر وشرب ذلك أ ّولا أ ّولا نفع نفعا كثيرا.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Know that the physicians only apply the name “exhilarating drink” to the drink prepared from borage. The ancient physicians have tried this; that is, if one puts some borage in <em>nabīdh</em> and leaves it there until its strength is extracted, one finds that it greatly increases pleasure and strengthens the lust for sexual intercourse. And if one takes the well-known iron water and boils in it four <em>dirhams</em> of borage, half an ounce of <em>utrujj</em> (citron or lemon) peel, and half a <em>dirham</em> of crushed clove, and mixes with this water two <em>raṭls</em> of wine or one <em>raṭl</em> of bees’ honey for someone who cannot take wine, and drinks this little by little, it will be greatly beneficial.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do these count as examples of distilled alcohol? This might not be the Judaic source you had in mind, but I think it precedes halakhic literature that discusses other kinds of distilled alcohol.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh De’ah, Chapter 123) references <em>aguardiente</em>, a hard liquor distilled from wine. Though its bracha is shehakol, Maran rules it assur (when made by non-Jews) as containing the very essence of stam yayin.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Am I Jewish? How to go about proving this is my Grandmother is deceased?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am sure there are many other questions that have similarities to mine. I apologize ahead of time if this irritates anyone.</p>\n<p>Growing up I always felt a strange kinship with the jewish children in our neighborhood, and as I got older I was consistently fascinated by the culture.</p>\n<p>I was raised Catholic, although I am still recovering. ;) My family would drive three and a half hours every friday night to eat fish with my grandparents as \"good Catholics\" might do. However, other than serve the meal and wait on my grandfather, my grandmother would always be in the kitchen singing strange songs under her breath that were polish, and then not polish, and then polish again. And she would bake beautiful loaves of bread, sometimes for hours. My grandmother married my grandfather in Germany. He was in the US army in Germany after the war, and they moved to America. But she often separated herself from us during holiday events (but not birthdays) and she did these strange things that would irritate my grandfather and make no sense to us. Her maiden name was Pryzbyla.</p>\n<p>I asked my mother and she said her mother never spoke to her of really anything religious, but sometimes spiritual. She died when I was 16 (20 years ago), and none of this dawned on me in time to ask my grandfather, who passed a year later. I am convinced she was Jewish, and I don't know exactly what is needed to serve as proof. I also am unsure if that means I'm Jewish, as my grandmother married my grandfather in a Catholic wedding. My mother says my grandfather never would have even thought to have anything different and it was probably never spoken about. She has suspicions that my grandfather knew something, but thinks if this was what that \"something\" was, that again, they never would have spoken of it. It breaks my heart honestly.</p>\n<p>Any guidance?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Theoretically if your mother's mother was Jewish, so are you. But all the stories you have so far are unfortunately not solid enough to be considered proof -- as odd as they may be.  (For all we know, for example, your grandmother may have been born to a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother -- she'd be raised doing a lot of Jewish stuff, but <em>halacha</em> would not regard her as Jewish.) Rabbi Zylberman from the Beth Din of America has a recorded lecture about using stuff like grave markers or census documents from New York City's Lower East Side in the 1920s. If your grandmother was Polish-born, you'd have to really dig back in Poland --  a whole lot of that stuff's been lost to the war, but you could hunt.</p>\n<p>There's nothing wrong with being a Jew-friendly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noahidism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noahide</a>, by the way.</p>\n<p>You say you're fascinated by the culture -- that's great, but are you prepared to accept the theology too?</p>\n<p>If you really want to be Jewish and accepted as such, then seek out a competent rabbi and explain your situation, and he'll outline a conversion curriculum for you. (Have a look at JudaismConversion.org) Trust me, you won't be the first person they've seen who's had some maybe-Jews in the family tree.</p>\n<p>Good luck wherever this takes you!</p>\n\n\n",

Specifically, it comes from the Kingdom of Judah.</p>\n<p>The names we get from Torah are typically for the people and not for the faith. We were called Hebrews and then we were called Israelites and then we became Jews.</p>\n<p>My question is did Judaism have a name before Judah? Is there a more ancient name which isn't specific to the Jewish people but to the faith system itself?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The notion of a multicultural society where you can choose to check a box with the belief system with which you identify is ... a newer one. (In the Soviet Union, your passport could call you a \"Russian\", a \"Ukrainian\", a \"Georgian\" ... or just a \"Jew.\" Didn't matter what you worshiped or believed.)</p>\n<p>In older times you would identify a person as a \"Hebrew\", or later an \"Israelite\", and their religion was kind of a given -- whether they kept a lot of it or not. Or you would mention the name of the God you worship.</p>\n<p>Moses tells Pharaoh he is speaking in the name of \"God, the Lord of the Hebrews.\" Later, Jonah tells the sailors that he is \"a Hebrew, who fears the God of the Heavens.\" (In both cases, the specific word used for \"God\" probably also helped with identification.)</p>\n<p>When the North Kingdom of \"Israel\" is defeated and all that remains is the South Kingdom of \"Judah\", and then the South Kingdom is defeated and taken into exile, they become known as \"Judeans\" or \"Yehudim.\" The Book of Esther, trying not to offend the sensibilities of the Persian Empire under which it was written, sidesteps \"religion per se\"; it simply says that documents were written \"to every nation and people by their alphabet and language; plus to the Judeans in their alphabet and language.\" (Similarly it doesn't say the Jews \"prayed\", just \"mourned.\")</p>\n<p>In the Mishna, a Jew is called a \"Yisrael.\" A Jew who has taken up another faith is <em>Yisrael she-hemir dato.</em> \"An Israelite who downgraded his dogma.\" It's understood from context that the natural \"dogma\" of the Israelite was what we call Judaism.</p>\n\n\n",

The more concrete the better.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The most concrete evidence that the Rambam knew of Yehuda Halevi is that Yonatan of Lunel, in a letter to him, listed the Kuzari as one of the books Yehuda Ibn Tibbon translated from Judeo-Arabic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הרב ר' יהודה אבן תיבון הספרדי , אשר הועילנו והשכילנו ולימדנו מספרי\nהחכמות , בהעתיקו אלינו ספר האמונות , וספר חובות הלבבות , ומידות הנפש\nומבחר הפנינים , וספר הכוזרי</p>\n<p>The Rabbi Yehuda Ibn Tibbon, the Sephardi, who improved us and educated us and taught us from the books of wisdom by copying for us...the Book of the Kuzari...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In another letter, from the Cairo Geniza (T-S 10 K 8.14), a friend writes to the Rambam about missing him, and quotes poetry from Yehuda Halevi to express it. That poem (אחר גלות סוד מה אטמין) was originally written for another Moshe—that is, Moshe Ibn Ezra—and the letter presupposes the Rambam understanding the reference:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And as God put off the appointed time [for writing back], there came to mind the strophic poem having melody, \"Why continue concealing when my secret is out,\" etc., which contains some of his traits coinciding with my yearning and love for him.</p>\n<p>--- See Joel Kraemer, \"Six Unpublished Maimonides Letters from the Cairo Geniza\" (<em>Maimonidean Studies</em>, 1991)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, scholars have devoted much ink to show how the Rambam's writings critically responds to Halevi's, but much of this is theoretical (and the Rambam never explicitly cited him). But, considering Halevi's documented fame in Egypt during the Rambam's time, and the above references, it's certain that the Rambam was at least familiar with his predecessor's poetic and philosophic work. To what extent, and how that might have affected him, is—for now—speculative.</p>\n\n\n",

That section of Tikunei Zohar speaks of G-d's unity which is the foundation of being a Righteous Gentile. Although there is a general prohibition for non-Jews to study Torah(1), it is a Mitzvah for them to study the details of the 7 commandments of Noah(2). For this reason the Lubavitcher Rebbe<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14948&st=&pgnum=199&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>-<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4599&st=&pgnum=121&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a>-<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4612&st=&pgnum=211&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3</a> encouraged Bnei Noach to learn the second part of Tanya <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/6240/jewish/Shaar-Hayichud-Vehaemunah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shaar Hayichud Vehaemunah)</a>. That treatise actually expounds upon Patach Eliyahu, it being essential in order to adequately understand G-d’s unity.<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4599&st=&pgnum=121&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1</a>-<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=4612&st=&pgnum=211&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2</a></p>\n<p>Being that it speaks of delicate concepts in Kabbalah that are readily misunderstood, he should study it with an observant Jew or a commentary.</p>\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<p>(1) Implication of Sanhedrin 59a and Ran there; See Lechem Mishneh on Rambam Melachim 10:9 who implies the actual prohibition is Biblical, and falls under the seven Noahide laws, although the punishment of death is Rabbinical.\nOther opinions: Some Poskim imply that the prohibition of a gentile learning Torah is only Rabbinical. [See Kesef Mishneh on Rambam ibid that the verse is a mere Asmachta, hence implying that the entire prohibition is only Rabbinical].</p>\n<p>(2) Meiri Sanhedrin 59a; Likkutei Sichos 14:o 38; 27:p246 in footnote.</p>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<p>Elijah opened [his discourse] and said: Master of the worlds, You are One but not in the numerical sense. You are exalted above all the exalted ones, hidden from all the hidden ones; no thought can grasp You at all. You are He who has brought forth ten “garments,” and we call them ten sefirot, through which to direct hidden worlds which are not revealed and revealed worlds; and through them You conceal Yourself from man. You are He who binds them together and unites them; and inasmuch as You are within them, whoever separates one from another of these ten sefirot, it is considered as if he had effected a separation in You. These ten sefirot proceed according to their order: one long, one short, and one intermediate. You are He who directs them, but there is no one who directs You— neither above, nor below, nor from any side. You have made garments for them, from which souls issue forth to man. You have made for them a number of bodies which are called “bodies” in comparison with the garments which cover them; and they are described [anthro­pomorphically] in the following manner: chesed (kindness)—the right arm; gevurah (severity, power)—the left arm; tiferet (beauty)—the torso; netzach (eternity, victory) and hod (splen- dor)—the two thighs; yesod (foundation)—the end of the torso, the sign of the Holy Covenant; malchut (kingship)—the mouth, which we call the Oral Torah; chochmah (wisdom)—the brain, that is, the thought within; binah (understanding)—the heart, by means of which the heart understands; and concerning the latter two [sefirot] it is written, “The secrets belong to the Lord our God”;' supernal keter (crown) is the crown of kingship, concern­ ־”,ing which it is said, “He declares the end from the beginning and it is the skull |upon which the] teftllin [are placed]. Within them is the Name [whose numerical value is] forty-five (spelled thus: יו״ד ה״א וא״ו ה״א) which is the path of atzilut (emanation); and the watering of the Tree [of the sefirot] with its arms and branches just as water irrigates a tree and it grows by that irrigation. Master of the worlds. You are the cause of causes and producer of effects, who waters the Tree through that fountain; and that fountain is as the soul to the body, which is the life of the body. In You, however, there is no similitude or likeness to anything within or without. You have created heaven and earth and brought forth from them the sun, the moon, the stars and the planets; and on earth—the trees, the green herbage, the Garden of Eden, the grasses, the beasts, the cattle, the fowl, the fish, and mankind; in order to make known through them the Supernal Realms, how the higher and lower worlds are conducted, and how the higher worlds may be known from the lower. However, there is none who can know You at all. Without You there is no unity in the higher or lower realms, and You are known as the Cause of all and the Master of all. Each seftrah has a specific Name by which the angels are also designated. You, however, have no specific Name, for You permeate all the Names, and You are the perfection of them all. When You remove Yourself from them, all the Names remain as a body without a soul. You are wise, but not with a knowable attribute of wisdom; You understand, but not with a knowable attribute of understand­ ing; You have no specific place. [You clothed Yourself in the seftrot] only to make known to mankind Your power and strength and to show them how the world is conducted through law and mercy—for there is righteousness and justice which are dispensed according to the deeds of man. Law is gevurah (severity, power); justice is the middle column; righteousness is the holy malchut (kingship); the scales o f righteousness are the two supports o f truth; hin (measure) of righteousness is the sign of the Holy Covenant. All these are to show how the world is conducted, but not that You possess a knowable righteousness—which is law, nor a knowable justice—which is mercy, nor any of these attributes at all.

    "title": "How do berry plants \"die in the winter\" compared to Ha'etz trees?",
    "content": "# How do berry plants \"die in the winter\" compared to Ha'etz trees?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Rema OC 203:2 one of the reasons given why we don't make Ha'etz on berries is because its shoots die during the winter and a new set of shoots and buds grow out from its roots during the summer, thus it is not considered a tree.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והני כיון דכלה עציו לגמרי בחורף והדר פרח משרשיו מברכים עליו בורא פרי\nהאדמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is mostly based on a Geonic responsa and also partly based on the gemara in Brachos 40a.</p>\n<p>But I'm having a hard time figuring out exactly what the geonim mean. It was clearly known to the Rishonim that berry shrubs and plants are not monocarpic (See tosfos ibid.), so when the geonim say that berries are Ha'adama because they die during the winter they clearly do not mean to say that the whole plant (besides for the roots) dies. Rather a more likely explanation is that the old shoots die (or lose their vigor) during the winter, and in the spring a new set of shoots grow on the old shoots which flower buds that eventually bears new fruit. The problem is that apple, pear, plum and all Ha'etz trees work <a href=\"https://extension.umaine.edu/fruit/growing-fruit-trees-in-maine/pruning/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the exact same way</a>! The old shoots grow new shoots and spurs every year or two which flower buds that produce the new fruit.</p>\n<p>So in short what I'm asking is, how do the berry plants and the fruit trees differ in the way they fruit (According to the understanding of the geonim), and why did they consider the berry plants \"dead\" in the winter, more so than a regular fruit tree? As far as my knowledge extends they both grow new shoots and spurs on the old shoots that so called \"die\" during the winter, and on these new shoots they sprout new buds in the spring. Berry plants are not monocarpic and they dont die after their first crop (contrary to what some believe), they usually live between 4-6 years producing many harvests over its lifetime. So why do we make on berries Ha'adama unlike apples and plums according to the geonim and the Rema?</p>\n\n\n",

Water. Wind. Earth. Understand the four elements - and you will better understand others, and yourself. Master their secrets - and you will master your relationships.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim Vital, Rambam, the Gaon of Vilna, the Aruch Hashulchan and the Baal HaTanya are just a few of the many Torah Sages who discuss the four elements that compose all matter - including all of humanity: fire, wind, water and earth. These elements represent different traits that make up our personalities.</p>\n<p>By better understanding these elements, and the way they play out in human behavior, we can better understand ourselves and the people around us. And by achieving that understanding, we can vastly improve our relationships.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Mordechai Weinberger LCSW is a master therapist, acclaimed public speaker, and popular radio show host who has helped thousands of people build better, more satisfying, and happier lives. Using fascinating case studies, and a considerable dose of humor, <strong>Rabbi Weinberger shows us how to identify our own \"elements\" as well as those of others; how to capitalize on our traits so they lead to success and not disaster; how to balance our natures and complement our strengths, making them even more effective; and how to interpret people’s behavior so we can deal properly with them</strong>. He explains how a husband with a \"fiery\" temperament can understand his wife, whose nature is dominated by \"wind.\"Â”A businessman characterized by the traits of \"earth\" will be afraid of risk; perhaps he needs to strengthen his attitude of “\"water\" in order to succeed.</p>\n<p>Yes, it's fun to take Rabbi Weinberger's quizzes and figure out which traits dominate in your personality, and in that of your spouse, your child, your mother-in-law, your boss. And it's fun to read about the various case studies, and see how people can understand, and misunderstand, each other. Indeed, this book is a lot of fun.</p>\n<p>And it's also life-changing. For the better. Much better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It goes through each of the four types of elements/souls and showcases how it exhibited in their characteristics and attributes.

While we are the descendants of Abraham, Issac, and Jacob, <em>you derive from Him through whose word the world was created</em>. As is said by Isaiah: “One shall say, <em>I am the Lord’s</em>, and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob” (Is. 44:5).”</p>\n<p><strong>The Full Letter</strong></p>\n<p>Maimonides, Letter to Ovadia to Convert</p>\n<p>Thus says Moses, the son of Rabbi Maimon, one of the exiles from Jerusalem, who lived in Spain:</p>\n<p>I received the question of the master Obadiah, the wise and learned proselyte, may the Lord reward him for his work, may a perfect recompense be bestowed upon him by the Lord of Israel, under whose wings he has sought cover.</p>\n<p>You ask me if you, too, are allowed to say in the blessings and prayers you offer alone or in the congregation: “Our God” and “God of our fathers,” “You who have sanctified us through Your commandments,” “You who have separated us,” “You who have chosen us,” “You who have inherited us,” “You who have brought us out of the land of Egypt,” “You who have worked miracles to our fathers,” and more of this kind.</p>\n<p>Yes, you may say all this in the prescribed order and not change it in the least. In the same way as every Jew by birth says his blessing and prayer, you, too, shall bless and pray alike, whether you are alone or pray in the congregation. The reason for this is, that Abraham our Father taught the people, opened their minds, and revealed to them the true faith and the unity of God; he rejected the idols and abolished their adoration; he brought many children under the wings of the Divine Presence; he gave them counsel and advice, and ordered his sons and the members of his household after him to keep the ways of the Lord forever, as it is written, “For I have known him to the end that he may command his children and his household after him, that they may keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice” (Gen. 18:19). Ever since then whoever adopts Judaism and confesses the unity of the Divine Name, as it is prescribed in the Torah, is counted among the disciples of Abraham our Father, peace be with him. These men are Abraham’s household, and he it is who converted them to righteousness.</p>\n<p>In the same way as he converted his contemporaries through his words and teaching, he converts future generations through the testament he left to his children and household after him. Thus Abraham our Father, peace be with him, is the father of his pious posterity who keep his ways, and the father of his disciples and of all proselytes who adopt Judaism.</p>\n<p>Therefore you shall pray, “Our God” and “God of our fathers,” because Abraham, peace be with him, is your father. And you shall pray, “You who have taken for his own our fathers,” for the land has been given to Abraham, as it is said, “Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give to you” (Gen. 13:17). As to the words, “You who have brought us out of the land of Egypt” or “You who have done miracles to our fathers” – these you may change, if you will, and say, “You who have brought Israel out of the land of Egypt ” and “You who have done miracles to Israel.” If, however, you do not change them, it is no transgression, because since you have come under the wings of the Divine Presence and confessed the Lord, no difference exists between you and us, and all miracles done to us have been done as it were to us and to you. Thus is it said in the Book of Isaiah, “Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the Lord, speak, saying, ‘The Lord has utterly separated me from His people'” (Is. 56:3). There is no difference whatever between you and us. You shall certainly say the blessing, “Who has chosen us,” “Who has given us,” “Who have taken us for Your own” and “Who has separated us”: for the Creator, may He be extolled, has indeed chosen you and separated you from the nations and given you the Torah. For the Torah has been given to us and to the proselytes, as it is said, “One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and also for the stranger that sojourns with you, an ordinance for ever in your generations; as you are, so shall the stranger be before the Lord” (Num. 15:15). Know that our fathers, when they came out of Egypt, were mostly idolaters; they had mingled with the pagans in Egypt and imitated their way of life, until the Holy One, may He be blessed, sent Moses our Teacher, the master of all prophets, who separated us from the nations and brought us under the wings of the Divine Presence, us and all proselytes, and gave to all of us one Law.</p>\n<p>Do not consider your origin as inferior.

Is this question dealt with by commentators?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Regarding your first question.</p>\n<p>To define an idea as being \"Jewish\", we must be bound by some sort of text. Some of the \"non-jewish\" concepts that they have stood by, are based on Jewish sources. This entire idea of one person, taking the sacrifice for many sins is based on Yeshayahu 53. It is pretty clear and apparent in the reading of the texts that there is a concept of this.</p>\n<p>We must remember that the Christian culture is deeply intertwined with the Jewish one. From its roots and through its history. We might think that their ideas are \"non-jewish\" at their core when in fact they are Jewish just the same.</p>\n<p>The idea of one man bearing the sins of all through pain and suffering is the literal translation of Chapter 54. Probably based off those texts, the entire christian culture built their own. The only critique we can make, is the idea of taking one Chapter and basing an entire religion on it and ignoring the rest of the texts.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of verses to illustrate the point:</p>\n<p>(ו) כֻּלָּ֙נוּ֙ כַּצֹּ֣אן תָּעִ֔ינוּ אִ֥ישׁ לְדַרְכּ֖וֹ פָּנִ֑ינוּ וַיהֹוָה֙ הִפְגִּ֣יעַ בּ֔וֹ אֵ֖ת עֲוֺ֥ן כֻּלָּֽנוּ׃\nAll we like sheep did go astray, We turned every one to his own way; And the Lord hath made to light on him The iniquity of us all.</p>\n<p>(ה) וְהוּא֙ מְחֹלָ֣ל מִפְּשָׁעֵ֔נוּ מְדֻכָּ֖א מֵעֲוֺנֹתֵ֑ינוּ מוּסַ֤ר שְׁלוֹמֵ֙נוּ֙ עָלָ֔יו וּבַחֲבֻרָת֖וֹ נִרְפָּא־לָֽנוּ׃\nBut he was wounded because of our transgressions, He was crushed because of our iniquities: The chastisement of our welfare was upon him, And with his stripes we were healed.</p>\n<p>אָכֵ֤ן חֳלָיֵ֙נוּ֙ ה֣וּא נָשָׂ֔א וּמַכְאֹבֵ֖ינוּ סְבָלָ֑ם וַאֲנַ֣חְנוּ חֲשַׁבְנֻ֔הוּ נָג֛וּעַ מֻכֵּ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים וּמְעֻנֶּֽה׃\nSurely our diseases he did bear, and our pains he carried; Whereas we did esteem him stricken, Smitten of God, and afflicted.</p>\n<p>The texts that are not accounted for are, such as the ones in Yechezkel 18, about each man being responsible for their own sins.</p>\n<p>We can see how living by the concept of an individual taking the role of society, can lead to godifing the individual.</p>\n<p>As stated in the comments, of later Chasidic thought basing the verse in Mishle of \"Tzadik Yisod Olam\" to be quite literal. This is deeply aligned with Isiah 53 and a very Jewish concept. There is an obvious danger with it as made known in many societies.</p>\n<p>David counts the Jewish nation wrongly and thousands of people die. Avraham hopes to find some righteous people to save an entire city. We see the idea of the power of influence in the individual, based on a development of relationship with God.</p>\n<p>I think according to the \"jewish concept\" we must juggle the idea of personal responsibility with the idea of an individual being \"responsible\" for the whole. What makes it \"non-jewish\" is only believing in one of these concepts without the other, in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Regarding your second question, if commentators mean on this concept itself. I saw that Rashi and Ibn Caspi on Yeshayah 53, define the texts as a parable to the entirety of the Jewish nation in relation to the world. It still is a concept but, more global in their approach. Others see it more literal (ramban, ibn ezrah, radak)</p>\n<p>If \"commentators\" mean on the Gemarah you quoted I don't have the answer.</p>\n<p>I don't think Yeshayahu is the earliest source to this but, the most detailed. I mentioned David sinning and causing havoc on the nation. (which means he has the influence of the entire nation for good or bad). And Avraham pleading for the Tzadik to save an entire city.</p>\n\n\n",

Why should lentils be the mourner’s food? Because they are round like a wheel and mourning (sorrow) is a wheel that revolves in the world (it touches everyone sooner or later as a revolving wheel touches every spot in turn) (Bava Batra 16b). And a further reason is: just as lentils have no mouth — (the word mouth פה is used in Hebrew of a serrated edge) — so, too, mourners have no mouth (appear dumb), for speech (greeting others) is forbidden to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the Gemara (Talmud) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.4.9?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=Eruvin&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Eruvin 81a)</a> explains Ezekiel 4:9 as \"However, bread prepared from lentils alone is edible\".</p>\n<p>Lentils, in combination with for example bread, was used as a proof that a certain sale had taken place.

That is, swear by your desire. As the heart contemplates food, the liver swallows. If it were not for the heart, longing and thinking about food, the liver and other organs would not be able to swallow. As Rabbi Yosi said, This is the way of slaves, who do not to eat before their master. Rabbi Yosi said, It is later written, \"Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentils\" (Beresheet 25:34). What are these lentils? They are round as a circle, and as the circle which revolves around the world does not deviate from its path, so man in that time will never deviate from his. Although there will yet be all that is good and precious and perfect, with all that, the worldly habit of eating and drinking will not change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.40a.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 40a</a>, it is said that lentils can prevent diphtheria from afflicting a house.

The latter one was identified with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Samuel_Bonfils\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Tov-Elem</a>. The Spanish one, according to Cassel, is the one we have before us, since it had Hilchot Nazir, just like the one we have. However, our Halachot Gedolot also has later additions to the text, including from the Rif.</p>\n<p>Similarly, he notes, there were two versions - French and Spanish - of the book Seder Tannaim V'Amoraim, with the French one also connected to Rabbi Yosef Tov-Elem. I'll add that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Schechter\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Solomon Schechter</a>, several decades later, discovered that there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avot_of_Rabbi_Natan#The_two_existing_forms_(recensions)_of_Avot_de-Rabbi_Nathan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">two versions of Avot DeRabbi Natan</a>, and the versions differentiate between Spanish/Mizrachi and French/Ashkenaz. And, as @Deuteronomy reminded me, there are two versions of Iggeret Rav Sherirah Gaon, likewise reflecting versions used by Spanish/Mizrachi and Ashkenaz respectively. The two versions were first <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/1374\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">published</a> by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9F_%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%99%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Binyamin Menashe Levin</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This appears to be speaking about the same book in both cases, but the chronology is blurred. Rava, an Amora, is associated around the 4th century CE (300-350).</p>\n<p>The BeHag (הלכות גדולות) was authored by <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9254-kayyara-simeon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon Keyara</a> (רבי שמעון קיירא) during the first half of the 8th century of the common era (700 -750 CE). This places him chronologically at the time of the Gaonim (589-1038 CE). But he didn't live in the Middle East and attend the academies in Sura or Pumbedita. The confusion arises over what Keyara is referring to.</p>\n<p>There are opinions that Keyara is referring to Cairo (Fostat) in Egypt. That Rabbi Shimon lived in Egypt at least for a time. Or possibly Kayyar somewhere in Mesopotamia.</p>\n<p>But linguistically, קיירא is related to קירא meaning <em>wax</em>, whether beeswax or plant or tallow based. This would mean that Rabbi Shimon is from a locale known for wax production. There are actual references to this type of idea in the Talmud, like for example tractate <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.40a.18?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 40a</a> which discusses certain places which manufacture wine barrels coated with wax which minimizes the absorption of wine during storage, thus increasing profit margins.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>GEMARA: The Gemara comments: And the first tanna and Rabbi Yehuda do not disagree with regard to the halakha. Rather, this Sage ruled in accordance with the custom of his locale, and this Sage ruled in accordance with the custom of his locale. In the place of one Sage, i.e., the first tanna, they coat the casks with wax [bekira] and it does not absorb much.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That in the ancient world, wax was a valuable commodity used in waterproofing, cosmetics, shipbuilding, metal casting, embalming and candle making. There are even historical records that Romans used wax for some kind of coinage.</p>\n<p>One of the centers associated with wax production was ancient <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarshish\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tarshish</a>, also known as <a href=\"https://www.spainthenandnow.com/spanish-history/tartessus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tartessos</a> or <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartessos\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tartesus</a>,  which was a city/outpost of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minoan/Philistine/Phoeneacian/Carthaginean civilization</a>. See the following link to an <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1820024?seq=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article from JSTOR pages 1 and 2 of the article, quoting Diodorus</a>. For ancient cultural context and reference, it should be noted from the link to Tartesus above, it associates Tartesos to the Celts. This is not referring to the Celts of ancient Britain, but the <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtiberians\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CeltIberian</a> culture of what would later be called Catalan or Catalonia. This was another very old Jewish settlement area on the Iberian peninsula.</p>\n<p>This ancient civilization was a powerful, seafaring nation in the Mediterranean based on the islands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akrotiri_(prehistoric_city)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akrotiri</a> (also called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Thera\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Thera</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Santorini</a>), <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caphtor\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaphtor</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Crete</a> in the Aegean Sea and with settlements in Phoenicia, Sidon and Tyre in modern Lebanon, Gaza, the home of the Philistines, which was a north-eastern province of ancient Egypt in the Sinai peninsula, Carthage in modern Tunisia on the north-western coast of Africa and Tarshish in Cadiz. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarshish\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tarshish</a> was located on the <a href=\"https://bibleatlas.org/tarshish.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Atlantic coastline of the Iberian peninsula in what would be today, Spain</a>.</p>\n<p>In this context, it would suggest that Rabbi Shimon may have been the fourth of <a href=\"https://www.jewishhistory.org/the-four-captives/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the four famous Jewish Sages who was kidnapped by pirates</a> in the Mediterranean during this period and ransomed to different communities. The story in Jewish history is that all four Sages were sailing on a single vessel, kidnapped together by the pirate, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Rumahis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mohamed Ibn Ruhamis</a> and sold separately. But perhaps the kidnappings occurred multiple times on several vessels. Pirating, slavery and human-trafficking was common at that time and in that culture. It continued into modern history with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Barbary pirates</a> (<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berbers\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berbers</a></em>) who were based in Morocco and Tunis.</p>\n<p>Like it explains in the link about the four Sages above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The names of three of them are known to us:</em> <strong>Rabbi Shmaryahu, Rabbi Chushiel, and Rabbi Moshe.</strong> <em><strong>The fourth man has remained anonymous.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Therefore, in keeping with\nthe purpose of the plagues - which was not only to punish but also to\neducate - the Egyptians were attacked by their very own god. This\ndemonstrated Hashem's mastery over the Egyptian god.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where does Abarbanel say this?</p>\n<p>EDIT: I am specifically looking for where he referred to the “crocodile deity” idea.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The Abarbanel can be found in his commentary on the Torah, in Exodus 7:26, in the name of Rabbeinu Channanel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והותרה בזה השאלה הראשונה שהעירותי בפרשה ואמנם מה המה הב\"ח שקרא הכתוב בכאן צפרדעים כלל המפרשים אמרו שהם הדגים הקטנים הצועקים תמיד באגמים. ורבי חננאל פיר' שהם הב\"ח הגדולי' שבנילוס הנקראים בלשון ערב אל תמסאח ומפרשי התורה לא הודו לו. ובאמת נראים דבריו מדבריהם ויש לנו מהכתוב על זה ראיות מהם אמרו הנה אנכי נוגף את כל גבולך בצפרדעים ולא יאמר לשון נגיפה אלא במכות שיש בהן מיתה וכו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This peshat is also brought down by the Ibn Ezra in his commentary to Exodus 7:27 but the Ibn Ezra says that frogs fits better.</p>\n<p>The part about the plagues being a lesson to the Egyptians who worshipped crocodiles is not in either source.

Pharaoh doubted Hashem. Since the Egyptians were worshipping the Nile, G-d involved the Nile in one of the plagues, just to show that \"their gods\" (e.g. the idols the Egyptians worshipped), cannot control the Nile, G-d can!</p>\n<p>The idea of \"worshipping the Nile\" can also be found in the commentary of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.7.17?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Or_HaChaim_on_Exodus.7.17.1&ven2=Or_Hachayim,_trans._Eliyahu_Munk&vhe2=On_Your_Way&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בזאת תדע כי אני ה׳, \"In this you shall know that I am י־ה־ו־ה.\" The reason G'd used the plague of blood to prove to Pharaoh that He was who He said He was, is understandable when we consider Shemot Rabbah 9,9 according to which the Egyptians looked upon the Nile as a benevolent deity. By striking this deity first and turning it into a source of curse instead of a source of life, G'd demonstrated that He owned the Nile. According to the Zohar volume 3 page 297 the tetragram implies the eternity of G'd. He had preceded the river Nile just as He had preceded every other phenomenon in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea is cited by the Or HaChaim from Shemos Rabbah 9:9, but that does not show up this idea on Sefaria.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Reference List:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://assets.torahtidbits.com/2021/12/28185943/Vaera-1449-ONLINE-small.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Tidbits; ISSUE 1449  JAN 1ST '22; Rabbi Shalom Rosner; p. 26-27</a></p>\n\n\n",

Some are stand- alone stores while others are located in malls.</p>\n<p>Many of these locations profess to sell kosher products under the certification of the cRc or other reliable agencies, and even have signs posted to indicate such. Unfortunately, while they may sell certain products that are kosher certified in their original factory sealed containers, most of the actual stores are not certified kosher. These letters only apply to the un-opened ice cream and yogurt that is listed on the letter of certification, and not necessarily to the store itself. Merely asking the store attendant if an item is kosher is not sufficient, as they may not be aware of specific requirements that may affect the kosher status of an item. One must see the actual product in its original sealed container and be able to ascertain that the product in the container or soft serve machine is the same that you saw in the original factory box and not a “token kosher box”. Regarding soft serve ice cream, one must verify that there is a kosher symbol on the label of the \"bag-in-box\" soft serve mix. If the mix is made in-house, the store must be certified kosher for the soft serve to be acceptable.</p>\n<p>In some cases, the scoop must be first washed clean. Any other products purchased, such as cones, toppings, or any other additives must also be inspected to determine if they are kosher. Items such as cakes and novelty items may be coming in from another outside source, so special care must be taken when purchasing any of these items. Since one may not assume that there were no changes made since the last visit, this all must be done each time you go into the store to make a purchase! There are many kashrus issues that can pop-up at   non-certified stores; these are just a few of the more common concerns.</p>\n<p>As the average person may not be aware of all of the kosher regulations, it is always preferable and recommended to only frequent shops under a reliable kosher supervision. Check with the cRc in the Chicago area, or your local Orthodox Vaad in other areas for the stores under a reliable kosher certification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why are blessings preceded by suffering?",
    "content": "# Why are blessings preceded by suffering?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Torah there are about 6 or 7 people/groups I can think of whose suffering preceded some blessing. The first is Abraham’s prolonged childlessness and his subsequent test to sacrifice his son. The next is Hagar and the suffering she was commanded to endure at the hands of Sarah (who then had her exiled). Next is Jacob’s laboring under Laban and his altercation with the divine being. Then we have Joseph’s enslavement and years-long stay in Pharaoh’s prison. And finally we have the centuries-long enslavement of Israel under Pharaoh, Israel’s exodus, and the tests and trials that ensued in the wilderness.</p>\n<p>All of these instances of suffering ended in significant rewards which I’m sure made each person forget their troubles, and these accounts align with my own experiences really well, but I don’t fully understand yet why they needed to happened.</p>\n<p>Hashem is perfect in all that He does and the beauty and light of His judgment make the sun seem like a dim candle, and so I want to understand His plan here because I’m certain there’s some benefit to it.</p>\n<p>I have a guess that maybe He simply acts in ways that are always balanced, and since it wouldn’t be balanced to reward people extravagantly when they’ve done nothing extravagant, He maybe places them in situations where they can act with incredible zeal for Him?</p>\n<p>I’m fascinated by this angle because there does seem to be a real theme of measure-for-measure outside the jurisprudence received on the way to Eretz Israel. Hashem took the firstborn of Egypt and so demanded every firstborn in Israel; He let loose ten plagues on Egypt and tested Israel with ten trials; He promised to bless Israel more than any nation on earth, but only insofar as Israel keeps the commandments and the laws and the teachings.

Also, in an article <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/midrash/40162\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> the author examines if these ten are related to the ten times Yisrael tried God's patience in the midbar in Ps. 95.</p>\n<p>Really everything is for the sake of Emunah, as at the end of the discussion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.24a.27?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 24</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rather, say: Habakkuk came and established the 613 mitzvot upon one, as it is stated: “But the righteous person shall live by his faith” (Habakkuk 2:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the sefer <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210804153231/https://breslovbooks.com/pdf/english-likutei-etzot.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Etzot</a>, this point mentions suffering in the context of Emunah, personal growth etc.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Emet w'emunah #34. <strong>Faith</strong> is correlated to the <strong>power of growth and the power of sprouting forth</strong>, and this is the aspect of patience. In other words, when faith is complete, one grows and sprouts forth in serving HaShem, no matter what happens, because no confusion or obstacle can confuse him. Rather, <strong>he makes himself patient to suffer</strong> whatever will come upon him, for all the obstacles and confusions in serving HaShem, in which he doesn't draw closer to those who fear HaShem, is all a result of laziness and depression and the heaviness that comes from a lack of faith. Because if his faith in the truth were properly complete, he certainly would run and be very speedy to draw closer to them. Thus, that he does not pray properly is also a result of laziness and heaviness that comes from a lack of faith. Certainly, if he had complete faith and he would believe that HaShem was standing over him and listening to every word by word that comes out of his mouth and heard the sound of his prayer, he would definitely pray properly, with enthusiasm and great desire. Rather, the main confusion of prayer is from a lack of faith and thus, all of the distancing from tzadikim, God-fearers, and from truly serving HaShem - all of it is from a lack of faith through which laziness, depression, and heaviness come upon him. However, when he has complete faith, nothing can hold him back. Rather, he becomes patient to suffer anything, and he grows and sprouts forth in serving HaShem, as it should be. (From Likutei Moharan I, 155)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Faith is the source of blessings</strong>, as written in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan.31.2.5?ven=Likutey_Moharan_Volumes_1-11,_trans._by_Moshe_Mykoff._Breslov_Research_Inst.,_1986-2012&vhe=Likutei_Moharan_-_rabenubook.com&lang=bi&with=Navigation&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Moharan Torah #31</a>.  With faith, as mentioned above, it doesn't have to be suffering, rather a trial and a growth experience.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...\nוֶאֱמוּנָה הִיא מְקוֹר הַבְּרָכוֹת, בִּבְחִינוֹת (משלי כ״ח:כ׳): אִישׁ אֱמוּנוֹת, רַב בְּרָכוֹת, בִּבְחִינוֹת (בראשית ב׳:ג׳): וַיְבָרֶךְ אֱלֹקִים אֶת יוֹם הַשְּׁבִיעִי. וְאֵין שְׁלֵמוּת לְהַבְּרָכוֹת, אֶלָּא עַד שֶׁיְּקַבְּלוּ מִמְּקוֹר הַבְּרָכוֹת, בִּשְׁבִיל זֶה כְּתִיב בָּהֶם שֵׁשׁ בְּרָכוֹת וְאַחַד־עָשָׂר, לְהוֹרוֹת שֶׁאֵין לָהֶם שְׁלֵמוּת.\n<strong>And faith is the source of the blessings. This is as in (Proverbs 28:20), “A man of faith, many are [his] blessings,” and as in (Genesis 2:3), “God blessed the seventh day.”</strong> But the blessings are only complete when he receives it from the source of blessings. Because of this, it is written that there are only six blessings and eleven: to show that they lack perfection.\nוְזֶה שֶׁאָמְרוּ חֲכָמֵינוּ זִכְרוֹנָם לִבְרָכָה (מכות כד): בָּא דָּוִד וְהֶעֱמִידָן עַל אַחַד־עָשָׂר, בָּא יְשַׁעְיָה וְהֶעֱמִידָן עַל שֵׁשׁ, בָּא חֲבַקּוּק וְהֶעֱמִידָן עַל אֱמוּנָה. לְהוֹרוֹת שֶׁאֵין שְׁלֵמוּת לְהַדַּעַת שֶׁהוּא הַתּוֹרָה, וְאֵין שְׁלֵמוּת לַגַּלְגַּלִּים, אֶלָּא עַל יְדֵי אֱמוּנָה:\nThis is as our Sages taught: King David came and based it on eleven, Yeshayahu came and based it on six, Chabakkuk came and based it on faith (Makkot 24a). This is to show that perfection of knowledge, which is the Torah, and the perfection of galgalim, is only through faith.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And see the whole discussion there, many important relevant points, for example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>And know! faith is only lasting because of the concept of brit (the Covenant), as in (Psalms 89:29), “My covenant shall remain faithful to him.” And thus Covenant is associated with Shabbat, as is written (Exodus 31:16,17), “an eternal covenant, between Me and the children of Israel [that… on Shabbat He ceased working and He rested].” And this is (Jeremiah 33:25), “Were it not for My covenant with day and night, the ordinances of heaven and earth I would not have appointed.” For the ordinances of heaven and earth—i.e., the galgalim —are dependent upon the Covenant.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which relates to Yosef who is the archetypal Tzaddik and Shomer haBrit, on which blessings depend as explained. In fact, if you asked Yosef would he say he suffered? If I recall right, Yosef did not complain. (Gen. 50:20) \"And as for you, ye meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.\" He even tells the brothers to not fear, and comforts them! (ibid. :21) \"Now therefore fear ye not; I will sustain you, and your little ones.' And he comforted them, and spoke kindly unto them.\" ... and proceeds to bless them (ibid. :25).</p>\n<p>Yaakob's episodes you mentioned might also relate to the Berit as it's been commented that Gid Hanashe is related to taavot there.</p>\n<p>Finally, the concept of קליפה קדמה לפרי - the husk forms before the fruit inside - whoever wants to eat the fruit has to break through the husk - you can search here:\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%94%20%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%A7%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A4%D7%94%20%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%9C%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance</a></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Halakhic Hours vs Standard Hours\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This is a very \"niche\" question...Obviously, the accepted practice is to calculate halakhic times by שעות זמניות. However, a minority of Rishonim and Acharonim disagree with the whole concept and maintain that שעות שוות should be used. Over time, this opinion has been generally disregarded, except by Komarna Chassidim, who even today follow one of their Rebbes who was adamantly opposed to שעות זמניות. This is the background to my question.\nThe (totally hypothetical) question itself: According to those who would propose the use of שעות שוות for halakhic times instead of שעות זמניות, when exactly would the day begin? When would you start counting the 60 minute hours to determine the deadline for Shema, Tefillah, eating hametz on Erev Pesah, etc.?\nI am assuming that beginning from an arbitrary point in time like 6AM makes no sense at all. And I know that with regard to Erev Pesah, the Terumat HaDeshen says to count two hours backwards from חצות, seemingly implying that we would have use the frame of reference of daylight hours for some things. But how would this be done in a way that is consistent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Yisroel Dovid Harfenes has a summary in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9765&st=&pgnum=83\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yisrael vehaZemanim, vol.

However, as he points out, it's possible that those opinions stem from before clocks became standardized, when 12noon in every place was simply defined as the actual time of noon (when the sun is overhead).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, there are those who say you count backwards from whenever noon is on a particular day.

For example, follow after Rabbi Eliezer to Lod, after Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai to Beror Ḥayil.<br />\nThe Sages taught: If one produces the sound of a millstone in the city called Burni, this is tantamount to announcing: Week of the son, week of the son. If one displays the light of a lamp in the city called Beror Ḥayil, this is tantamount to announcing: There is a wedding feast there, there is a wedding feast there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that this anecdote about Burni and Bror Chayil is brought in relation to RYb\"Z moving to Bror Chayil. However, other than the common place-name, there doesn't seem to be any actual connection between the two: It seems RYb\"Z moved to Bror Chayil after spending some time in Yavneh rebuilding the nation, post-destruction. But adding the anecodte about Bror Chayil seems really random. The braita about Bror Chayil and Burni is compared by pretty much all of the commentators on Sefaria (as well as many other sources that I found) with the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Ketubot.1.5.2?ven=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_translation_and_commentary_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Ketubot 1:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In earlier times they decided on a persecution in Judea...They decreed that her husband should come to her when still in her father’s house; for when she knows that her husband’s fear is on her she is drawn after him...What kind of a sign did they have? The talk of a cook in town: There is a wedding meal, there is a wedding meal; there is light in Beror-Ḥayil: a week for a son, a week for a son. When the persecution ended, the custom did not end. Rebbi Hoshaia’s daughter-in-law was pregnant when she married definitively [according to Pnei Moshe and Korban Ha'edah she arrived at her chuppah already pregnant; Rabbi Hoshayah was one of the last tannaim - this shows the custom lasted at least that long].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Most commentators also point out that that the Bavli, other than mentioning Burni (which the Yerushalmi doesn't), switched the order - in Bror Chayil a light signifies a \"week of a son\" instead of a wedding feast.</p>\n<p>But another parallel is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillat_Taanit%2C_Elul.3-4?ven=Megillat_Taanit,_trans._Solomon_Zeitlin&vhe=Warsaw,_1874&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">17th of Elul in Megillat Taanit</a> where it is stated that the this poem or song originated with the anti-Torah laws from the time of the Greeks, centuries prior to RYb\"Z's time.</p>\n<p>So what does this braita actually have to do with the previous one?</p>\n<p>I think it's possible that the fact that it was placed here hints towards a special situation in Bror Chayil during <em>RYb\"Z's time</em>, and that's why there are differences between the Bavli's poem and the versions in Megillat Taanit and the Yerushalmi. But I haven't been able to figure out what that special situation might be.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know (or can think of an explanation)? Or is there any other way to explain the connection between the Braitot?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rather unexpectedly, I found an answer to my question pretty quickly. The explanation that I found is a bit radical, so critique is of course welcome, to see if the answer holds water.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Kaminka_Aharon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aharon Kaminka</a> in his essay in Hebrew \"<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23547101?seq=4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yohanan Ben Zaccai and his disciples</a>\", p. 73, refers to <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/9506-krauss-samuel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel Krauss</a>'s view in his essay \"Die römischen Besatzungen in Palästina\", pp. 117-123 (<a href=\"https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/2572104\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magazin für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums 20 (1893)</a>) that \"Bror Chayil\" was not a specific place-name but was a Hebraicized term coming from the Greek \"froúrion\" (φρούριυν) which means something like a 'citadel', a 'garrison' or an 'army base'. The froúrion, according to both Krauss and Kaminka, was any civilian locality that had been partially taken over by soldiers, Roman legionnaire units in this case.</p>\n<p>Per this, the two maintain that Bror Chayil was not the name of a Jewish town (!) but actually refers to an area in Judea that had been taken over by Roman soldiers during the Great Revolt or shortly thereafter. This area included none other than the city of Yavneh. So when the gemara tells us that RYb\"Z went to Bror Chayil, it means that RYb\"Z went to the area taken over by the Romans and set up his court there. The court itself was set up in Yavneh, but it was intended to govern the whole of the \"Bror Chayil\"/froúrion territory.</p>\n<p>Of course, one would ask: If that's the case, why is Yavneh itself mentioned in the third braita:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Sages taught: The verse states: “Justice, justice, shall you follow.” This teaches that one should follow the Sages to the academy where they are found. For example, follow after Rabbi Eliezer to Lod, after Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai to Beror Ḥayil, after Rabbi Yehoshua to Peki’in, <strong>after Rabban Gamliel to Yavne</strong>, after Rabbi Akiva to Bnei Brak, after Rabbi Matya to Rome [Romi], after Rabbi Ḥananya ben Teradyon to Sikhnei, after Rabbi Yosei to Tzippori, after Rabbi Yehuda ben Beteira to Netzivin, after Rabbi Yehoshua to the exile [gola], i.e., Babylonia, after Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi to Beit She’arim, and after the Sages in the time of the Temple to the Chamber of Hewn Stone.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To this I would say that by the time Rabban Gamliel became Nasi, Yavneh and the area as a whole was no longer teeming with Roman soldiers and so could no longer be designated as a froúrion.</p>\n<p>There are three main reasons why I think this a good explanation, or at least that it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It appears to explain the variations of the song/poem between the three sources: It occurred to me last night, after reading Kaminka's view (before tracking down and google-translating Krauss's explanation), that the word בורני (Burni) means in Aramaic \"ship\". In other words, while it might be a place-name, it may also be referring to any random ship, much like Bror Chayil refers to any locality taken by Roman soldiers. Krauss, it turns out, opined that Burni comes from the same Greek word from which the word בריון branched out. Both words are yet another reference to soldiers.<br />\nEither way, the meimra makes sense now: We now understand:<br />\na. Why this special situation only happened in two little-known towns - it didn't; it happened in many places.<br />\nb. Why the Yerushalmi refers only to Bror Chayil and a city instead of Burni, and the signs are flipped - both are references to localities. It's possible that the Yerushalmi is referring to a different era of גזירות than the Bavli, or to how things went down in a different area.<br />\nc. Why the version in Megillat Taanit is different than the one in the Bavli - again, either a reference to a different era or a reference to the way things happened in other places.<br />\nd. How this custom spread out to Rabbi Hoshaya's community many decades later - likely because these things happened in places like Caesarea as well.</li>\n<li>It explains why the braita about Bror Chayil and Burni is brought in the Bavli in relation to the braita about RYb\"Z going to Bror Chayil to set up a court: The second braita shows us that the froúrion(s) of Judea was/were going through a difficult time after the destruction of the Temple (as we know from a great many other sources). RYb\"Z came to the area strengthen the Jewish people and to bring law and order to the area. It seems that it was thanks to his efforts that by the time Rabban Gamliel came to Yavneh, it was no longer designated as a froúron.</li>\n<li>If we examine the third braita, we find that not every place is the name of a town or city, besides for Bror Chayil: Lod, Bnei Brak, Peki'in, Tzippori, Beit She'arim, Netzivin, Yavneh and Rome are cities or town, but \"gola\" (the diaspora) and \"the Chamber of Hewn Stone\" are not. So it would not be problematic to say that Bror Chayil also isn't a specific town or city but a certain area. Hence, it is not out of place in this braita.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Occam's Razor explanation is that since this is the only place in the Bavli that that city is mentioned, this is the only place the second b'raisa would fit. (It could have been placed after the next b'raisa in the Gemara, but if fits better here because the first b'raisa ends with one of the cities mentioned in the second b'raisa.)</p>\n<p>Similarly, <em>sugyos mischalfos</em> like the Aruch says is the Occam's Razor approach to the discrepancy, IMHO.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Hashavas Aveida with changing forfeiture status",
    "content": "# Hashavas Aveida with changing forfeiture status\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In an instance in which an object is found prior to forfeiture by despair ( Ye'ush) the finder is obligated to return the item. However, in an instance in which despair is presumed either implicitly or explicitly, the finder can keep the item. What is the Halacha in a case where an item is found with no presumption of forfeiture thereby obligating its return, yet forfeiture from the original owner comes in between the finding of the object and its successful return. Can the finder keep the object? Or since it came to him in a predicament requiring its return, the ultimate forfeiture is irrelevant?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It is implied in many halachos of Hashavas Aveida in Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat סימן רנ\"ט - רע\"א, that only if ייאוש already occurred at the time of finding,  is the finder not obligated to return the item. If at the time of finding the item ייאוש didn't yet occur, the finder is obligated to return the item even if ייאוש occurred prior to the return. The only difference would be the amount of transgressions the finder transgressed if he decides not to return the item. For further information to that point see ש<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Choshen_Mishpat.259.1?vhe=Shulhan_Arukh,_Hoshen_ha-Mishpat,_Lemberg,_1898&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ו\"ע חו\"מ סימן רנ\"ט</a> סעיף א.</p>\n<p>An explicit source to the obligation of returning an item that was found prior ייאוש and ייאוש occurred before the return of the item can be found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.21b.2?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בבא מציעא כ\"א עמוד ב</a>:</p>\n<p>\"בדבר שיש בו סימן כולי עלמא לא פליגי דלא הוי יאוש ואף על גב דשמעיניה דמיאש לסוף לא הוי יאוש דכי אתא לידיה באיסורא הוא דאתא לידיה דלכי ידע דנפל מיניה לא מיאש מימר אמר סימנא אית לי בגויה יהבנא סימנא ושקילנא ליה</p>\n<p>The Gemara limits the scope of the dispute. In the case of an item on which there is a distinguishing mark, everyone agrees that despair that is not conscious is not considered despair. And even though we hear that he ultimately despairs of recovering the item, it is not considered despair, as when the item came into the possession of the finder, it was in a prohibited manner that it came into his possession. It is prohibited because when the owner learns that it fell from his possession, he does not despair of its recovery immediately. Instead, he says: I have a distinguishing mark on the item; I will provide the distinguishing mark to the finder, and I will take it.\"</p>\n<p>We can see from here that if the item came to the the finder in a \"prohibited manner\", which as Rashi explains means before ייאוש, it doesn't matter if the owner ultimately was מתייאש, the finder is still obligated to return the item.</p>\n\n\n",

What is the earliest use of this phrase to relate to Hashem – when did it transition from a generic description of \"unlimited\" to being a way to refer to Hashem?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Makor is in Zohar (the first time the <em>words</em> are found is in Sefer Habair). However, it seems like it wasn’t used as a technical term until later by the early Mekubalim. One <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5746-en-sof\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a> says the term’s first usage by the early Mekubalim is by Rabbi Azriel ben Menachem of Gironda.</p>\n<p>This is from the <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ein-sof\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jewish Virtual Library</a></p>\n<p>EIN-SOF (Heb. אֵין סוֹף; \"The Infinite,\" lit. that which is boundless), name given in Kabbalah to God transcendent, in His pure essence: God in Himself, apart from His relationship to the created world. Since every name which was given to God referred to one of the characteristics or attributes by which He revealed Himself to His creatures, or which they ascribed to Him, there is no name or epithet for God from the point of view of His own being. Consequently, when the kabbalists wanted to be precise in their language they abstained from using names like Elohim, the Tetragrammaton, \"the Holy One, blessed be He,\" and others. These names are all found either in the Written or the Oral Law. The Torah, however, refers only to God's manifestations and not to God's own being which is above and beyond His relationship to the created world. Therefore, neither in the Bible, nor in rabbinic tradition was there a term which could fulfill the need of the kabbalists in their speculations on the nature of God. \"Know that Ein-Sof is not alluded to either in the Pentateuch, the Prophets, or the Hagiographa, nor in the writings of the rabbis. But the mystics had a vague tradition about it\" (Sefer Ma'arekhet ha-Elohut). The term Ein-Sof is found in kabbalistic literature after 1200. However, it was apparently not coined as a technical term since this was not the style in which, in the medieval period, negative terms were coined. Most probably its source is to be found in those phrases stressing God's sublimity which is infinite (ad le-ein sof), or which emphasize the characteristics of the (Divine) thought, comprehension of which \"has no end\" (ad le-ein sof). The use of this epithet in early kabbalistic literature proved without doubt that the term grew out of this kind of expression. It originated, apparently, in the circle of *Isaac the Blind, and his disciples. In the view of some kabbalists, the name Ein-Sof was likewise applicable to the first product of emanation, the Sefirah Keter, because of its completely concealed nature, and this double use of the word gave rise in kabbalistic literature to considerable confusion. There is no doubt that from the beginning the intention was to use the name in order to distinguish the absolute from the Sefirot which emanated from Him. The choice of this particular name may be explained by the emphasis placed on the infinity of God in the books of *Saadiah Gaon which had a great influence on the circle of the Provençal kabbalists. The term also shows that the anthropomorphic language in which the kabbalists spoke of the living God of faith and revelation does not represent the totality of their theosophical theological approach. At first there was no definite article used in conjunction with Ein-Sof, and it was treated as a proper name, but after 1300 there were kabbalists who spoke of \"the Ein-Sof.\" At first, the term was used only rarely (even in the principal part of the *Zohar its occurrence is very rare), but from about 1300 its use became habitual, and later Kabbalah even speaks of several \"kinds of Ein-Sof,\" e.g., the enveloping Ein-Sof, the enveloped Ein-Sof, the upper Ein-Sof.</p>\n<p>BIBLIOGRAPHY:</p>\n<p>G.

    "content": "# How to pronounce Hebrew with the Chassidic pronunciation?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>First of all, I'm not Jewish but I love Judaism and feel a strong connection to the Jewish people and faith.</p>\n<p>My question is regarding the Chassidic way of Hebrew pronunciation when praying and reading Torah. I've managed to teach myself Hebrew and can say many of the prayers in the Siddur. I know that the Hasidim and the various Hasidic dynasties from Europe have different traditions when it comes to how Hebrew should be pronounced. For example, the Hungarian Hasidim like Satmar and Toldos Aharon have their own way of pronouncing Hebrew in prayer and reading Torah. And the Hasidim from Poland, the Ukraine, Romania and Lithuania likewise have their own traditions when it comes to Hebrew pronunciation.</p>\n<p>I'll give a few examples. Most Jews in Israel and around the world when praying say the prayers in a Sephardic or Modern Hebrew pronunciation. Like in the blessing, they say \"Baruch ata\" but the Hasidim pronounce it differently like \"Burich atu\" or \"Boruch ato\". I know some of the vowels are pronounced in a different way than they are in the Modern Hebrew or Sephardic ways of pronunciation. I'd love to know how to pronounce the prayers in a Hasidic pronunciation. I'm especially interested in the Hungarian Hasidic or Polish forms of pronunciation. I've not been able to find this information anywhere else online. If anyone is able to explain to me how the Hasidic pronunciation works and how to pronounce the Hebrew prayers in the Hasidic way I would greatly appreciate it.</p>\n<p>So my question is: How do I pronounce Hebrew in the Hasidic way (in particular in the Hungarian/Polish/Galician styles like the Toldos Aharon, Satmar and Bobov Hasidim do)?</p>\n<p>Thank you everyone. I'm sorry for the long, drawn out way I asked my question :)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As user DoubleAA has pointed out in the comments, the accent you speak of does not originate with Hasidim but rather with the greater Eastern European Jewish community. It became associated with Hasidim as they are the primary users of this accent today. With most Jewish communities being found in the United States or Israel, many Jews whose family came from those areas in Europe adopted a more common accent such as the various American Ashkenazi accents or Israeli Hebrew. This was not the case with various Hasidic sects such as Satmar (one of the largest Hasidic sects in the world).</p>\n<p>You can read about the various differences between Ashkenazi accents <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashkenazi_Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here on Wikipedia</a>.</p>\n<p>I must mention there is no advantage to this accent over any other one, maybe unless one lived in a community where this is the common accent, or it was ones family's original practice. Some people suggest one receive permission from a posek before changing ones Hebrew pronunciation, although many say it is okay to speak Hebrew using any accent provided you and your accent are consistent. For the most part, every legitimate Hebrew accent is valid in its own right.</p>\n<p>I will summarize the accent for you below. This is by no means standard or exhaustive.</p>\n<p>Consonants are the same as in nearly every Ashkenazi accent. Alef and ayin do not make their own sound. There is no difference between the pronunciation of chet and chof. A tav without a degesh is known as a \"sav\" and makes an \"s\" sound.</p>\n<p>Kamatz is \"oo\". Patach is \"ah.\" Tzeireh is \"ai\". Segol is \"eh\". (Segol-Malei, a segol followed by a yud, is \"ey\".) Chirik is \"ee\". Kibutz/Shuruk is \"ee\". Shuruk/Melupem is \"ee\". Sheva is \"ih\".</p>\n<p>Perhaps if you were interested I would make a video or recording of the accent. This accent carries over into Yiddish as well, and even though I use a Northern European (somewhat Litvish) accent for Hebrew, for Yiddish I use the Galician accent.</p>\n<p>Hope this was helpful.</p>\n\n\n",

R. Dimi the son of Hama stated that the Holy One, blessed be He, told Israel: If you accept the Torah, well and good; but if not, your grave will be there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Toras Avigdor by Rav Avigdor Miller (Parashas Yisro, p. 108) it says on the concept of <em>\"na'aseh v'nishma\"</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It means they accepted everything beforehand, before they even knew what would be expected of them. If Hashem would tell them to stand on their heads every morning for ten minutes, they would do it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Saying na'aseh v'nishma, B'nei Yisrael is praised, because we wanted to fulfill G-ds mitzvot even before He told us to do it. However, the teaching of the Gemara and Midrash, that we were coerced, seems to contradict this. First of all, the pasuk never says G-d held the mountain over the heads.  Similary, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.19.17?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&vhe=Miqra_according_to_the_Masorah&lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim</a> teaches us the opposite:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויוצא משה את העם, Moses lead out the people, etc. Perhaps this was necessary because the people had become afraid of the Mountain by now. Moses took them to the edge of the Mountain so that they would accept the Torah while standing there.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara further states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you accept the Torah, excellent, and if not, there will be your burial.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you ask me, if someone was treathing me to do something, and I knew it was a case of life and death, I am sure what I did.

The Tosfos explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Answer (R. Tam): [Both of those] were based on Hash-m's command. It is as if they were coerced. However, in the days of Achashverosh, they willingly accepted [Torah] due to love of the miracle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point is, Matan Torah is such an important date in our history. Why then can it teach us that we accepted G-ds Torah only out of \"fear\" (coercion) and only until Purim out of love?</p>\n<p>See also the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88a.5?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=Rashba&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashba on Shabbos 88a:5</a> which explains (cited by <a href=\"https://steinsaltz.org/daf/shabbat88/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Steinsaltz</a>) that \"holding the mountain above the heads\" alludes to the love G-d showed the people during the exodus out of Mitzrayim, and because of that, they said Naaseh VeNishmah.

Once we did so, Hashem out of love for us, granted us the level of \"servant\" in addition, and coerced us as well (by holding the mountain over our heads etc.). Now we had achieved both the levels of voluntary, and involuntary service.</strong></p>\n<p>This is similar to what is said in the Talmud (Babba Kama 87a):</p>\n<p>תניא אידך ר' יהודה אומר סומא אין לו בושת וכן היה רבי יהודה פוטרו מכל מצות האמורות בתורה אמר רב שישא בריה דרב אידי מאי טעמא דר' יהודה אמר קרא (דברים ו, א) ואלה המצות החקים והמשפטים כל שישנו במשפטים ישנו במצות וחקים וכל שאינו במשפטים אינו במצות וחקים</p>\n<p>The Gemara presents another statement of Rabbi Yehuda. It is taught in another baraita that Rabbi Yehuda says: A blind person does not have, i.e., receive, compensation for humiliation, and so did Rabbi Yehuda exempt a blind person from all mitzvot that are stated in the Torah. Rav Sheisha, son of Rav Idi, said: What is the reasoning of Rabbi Yehuda? The verse states: “And this is the commandment, statutes, and laws” (Deuteronomy 6:1), to teach that anyone who is subject to civil laws is also subject to the commandments and statutes, and anyone who is not subject to civil laws, including a blind person, is also not subject to the commandments and statutes.</p>\n<p>אמר רב יוסף מריש הוה אמינא מאן דאמר הלכה כר' יהודה דאמר סומא פטור מן המצות קא עבדינא יומא טבא לרבנן מ\"ט דלא מפקדינא וקא עבדינא מצות</p>\n<p>Rav Yosef, who was blind, said: At first, I would say: If I hear one who says that the halakha is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, who says: A blind person is exempt from the mitzvot, then I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason? It is that I am not commanded and nevertheless I perform mitzvot.</p>\n<p>והשתא דשמעית להא דר' חנינא דאמר ר' חנינא גדול המצווה ועושה ממי שאינו מצווה ועושה מאן דאמר לי אין הלכה כרבי יהודה עבדינא יומא טבא לרבנן מ\"ט דכי מפקדינא אית לי אגרא טפי:</p>\n<p>Rav Yosef continues. But now that I heard this statement of Rabbi Ḥanina, as Rabbi Ḥanina says: One who is commanded and performs a mitzva is greater than one who is not commanded and performs it, I say: If I hear one who says to me that the halakha is not in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yehuda, then I will host a festive day for the Sages. What is the reason? It is that as I am commanded, I have more reward.</p>\n<p>See also Talmud (Kiddushin 31 a).</p>\n<p><strong>The Rebbe uses this path and says that if the Jews only said \"na'aseh v'nishma\" out of their own love, then we would be missing the greater level of obedience.

In Torah Or the Baal HaTanya explains that G-d revealed such a level of love to the Jewish people that we were “forced” to accept it and said Naaseh Venishma. That’s the deeper meaning behind Hashem holding the mountain over our heads, he “hugged” us with his right hand of loving-kindness.</p>\n<p>I found an interesting answer to the question al derech hapshat in an early Pirush on Rashi, <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/#/book/633930/p/131/t/0.414425759448087351234/fs/0/start/0/end/0/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaGur</a> (דברים ,ע׳ קלא). There by Megillas Ruth he brings in the name of Rabbi Yitzchak Polak, that when Hashem offered the Torah to the Nations there were individuals who did want the Torah but were nullified in the majority. On the other hand by Matan Torah some Jews didn’t want to accept it and were also nullified in the majority. That’s why we find Gerim convert to Judaism and some Jews “convert” away ח״ו; they both come from those minority individuals. The Rov who published the Sefer from Ksav Yad, <a href=\"http://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%A9%D7%A4%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hagaon HaRav Aharon Shapira</a>, suggests this answers Tosafos’ famous question in Maseches Shabbos. How could Sefer HaGur say some Jews didn’t accept the Torah when we find various places where the Pasuk says all (Kol) Jews said Naaseh Venishma? He answers according to the idea that in Halacha (Taz Hilchos Shabbos) Kol is many times defined as “Rubo k’kulo” and perhaps not literally <em>all</em> Jews accepted it but were nevertheless nullified in the majority.

A similar thing happened with the law that 'an Ammonite shall not enter the congregation of God' (Deut. xxiii. 3). With regard to these two points it is said: 'They found written.' (Neh. viii., 4; xiii. 1). This proves that they had lost the knowledge of the law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Upon which the Rabbi answers this by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If this be so we are to-day more learned and erudite than they, since we think we know the Tōrāh. [...] Should we be commanded to bring a sacrifice, would we know how and where to slaughter it, catch its blood, skin and dismember it, and into how many pieces, how to offer it up, how to sprinkle the blood, what to do with its meal and wine offering; with what songs to accompany it; what duties of holiness, purity, anointment, clothing, and demeanour the priests had to observe; how, when and where they should eat the holy meat, and other matters which it would lead us too far to commemorate?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara is teaching us something interesting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.20a.11?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Sukkah 20a)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara notes: And Reish Lakish follows his line of reasoning stated elsewhere, as Reish Lakish said: I am the atonement for Rabbi Ḥiyya and his sons, as initially, when some of the Torah laws were forgotten from the Jewish people in Eretz Yisrael, Ezra ascended from Babylonia and reestablished the forgotten laws. Parts of the Torah were again forgotten in Eretz Yisrael, and Hillel the Babylonian ascended and reestablished the forgotten sections. When parts of the Torah were again forgotten in Eretz Yisrael, Rabbi Ḥiyya and his sons ascended and reestablished the forgotten sections. This expression of deference toward Rabbi Ḥiyya introduces the halakha that Reish Lakish is citing in his name. And so said Rabbi Ḥiyya and his sons: Rabbi Dosa and the Rabbis did not disagree concerning the soft mats of Usha,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, in footnote 16 in the commentary of Rashi to Yehoshua 15:15 (linked to Temurah 16a), it <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Temurah.16a.3?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=Rashi%20on%20Joshua%7CQuoting&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A total of three thousand laws were forgotten during this period. Rav Avahu said, “Nevertheless they were brought back by Osniel, son of Kenaz through his dialectic scholarship, as it is said, “And Osniel, son of Kenaz, conquered it (Kiryas Seifer).” After Caleiv conquered Chevron he approached the scholars in the Beis Midrash who were called יוֹשְׁבֵי דְבִיר, those who sit in Devir, because they sat all day studying דִבְרֵי תוֹרָה, the words of Torah, and challenged them to rediscover the forgotten laws. He announced that the one who would overcome, וּלְכָדָה (conquer) these problems would be worthy to become his son-in-law.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, there were some forgotten laws, but they were \"re-learned\". How? The Einei Shmuel brings the Hafla'ah to the Gemara in Makos 10a and says <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/temurah/insites/tm-dt-016.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(brought by Rabbi Mordecai Kornfeld from Kollel Iyun Hadaf of Yerushalayim)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Hafla'ah explains that every Jew has the ability to bring a unique part of Torah into the world through his learning. When a Rebbi teaches students, he becomes a \"pipeline\" through which this special portion of Torah is passed down to the student and subsequently brought into the world by the student. This gives the Rebbi a special merit, for he has enabled the student to bring this unique portion of Torah into the world. In this way, his own eyes are enlightened and he becomes \"enriched.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also <a href=\"https://steinsaltz.org/daf/temurah-16a-b-forgetting-torah-laws/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p>So, to quote \"When a Rebbi teaches students, he becomes a \"pipeline\" through which this special portion of Torah is passed down to the student and subsequently brought into the world by the student\"- even if there were 3.000 halachos forgotten, they were re-established so to say because of the chain of tradition. When a teacher passes down something unto his student, the chain is strengthened and passed on.. Maybe, as LFE writes in his comment, the chain of Torah was forgotten, but the chain of the tradition was not.

    "content": "# Pardes Torah Commentary\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Are there any Torah commentaries that incorporate a systematic theory of PaRDeS analysis?</p>\n<p>Given the number of commentaries out there, even just the ones from eminent Torah authorities (the numerous conflicting interpretations of Bereshit 1:1 being the classic example) I was wondering if anyone has attempted to compile them, or demonstrate how they form a framework of valid interpretation.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I don't remember the source, but PaRDeS is the general division: within each type of analysis are the same for subtypes, meaning peshat of peshat, remez of peshat, etc.. (hence Rashi can use drash freely while still presenting the peshat, but only if it's required by the literal text). The theory goes that there's one unique interpretation for each Soul at Sinai.</p>\n<p>But regardless, there are a number of conflicting commentaries. And we know from the Gemara that a conflict between two sages can be reconciled at a higher level of interpretation. Meaning a contradiction doesn't always imply an error, but quite often is a \"these and these are the words of Living G-d\" type situation. Applied to commentaries, this would suggest that they are <em>all</em> valid interpretations (the eminent ones, I mean), some higher, some lower, with the \"peshat of peshat of peshat...\" being the most material level, all the way up to the Zohar (assuming that's the sod of sod of...).</p>\n<p>Does anyone know if this approach has been rigorously treated anywhere? By that I mean, gone beyond merely listing competing interpretations and attempting to fit they all into a single (albeit necessarily contradictory) framework? Because the Torah is G-d's Essence emanating down into this material world (Tanya), and therefore shouldn't all commentaries ultimately fold into One?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bechaye</a> wrote a commentary that deals with pshat, medrash, philosophy, and Sod.</p>\n<p>Michtav MeEliyahu by Rav Dessler is known for finding common themes among different midrashic explanations for a verse.</p>\n<p>A full work like you describe would probably take a lifetime to finish one parshah.</p>\n\n\n",

Netanel al Fayyumi says that there was no obligation of Shavuos in the midbar. Although this is a  chiddush, on second consideration, it makes some sense. In Parshas Emor, it seems that the obligation of Shavuos depends on the minchas ha’omer and שתי הלחם, which were only brought once they entered Eretz Yisrael. The Ramban explains that the pasuk specifically obligates Shavuos forever for this reason:</p>\n<p>והוצרך לומר \"חוקת עולם לדורותיכם בכל מושבותיכם\" באיסור החדש (פסוק יד) ובשביתת חג השבועות (פסוק כא) מפני שהוא תלוי בהנפת העומר ובמנחה חדשה לומר שאפילו אחרי גלותנו בחוצה לארץ שאין עומר ומנחה יצוה בהם</p>\n<p>R. Aharon Cohen (Beis Aharon), the late rosh yeshivah of Chevron, also suggested that Shavuos did not apply in the midbar for this reason (although he did not quote the Bustan al Uqul).</p>\n\n\n",

You have no obligation to reveal you are a convert nor is it anyone’s business. Unless: you are joining the type of community that requires you to provide proof you are Jewish (assuming the conversion is kehalacha from a recognized orthodox beis din). Regarding Shidduchim, whether you’re conversion is a full conversion or merely lechumra you don’t have an obligation to mention it until you have met a potential match a couple times (a descendant of anusim is considered a full conversion now a days). This is brought down by poskim based on a Gemara meforeshes Yevamos 45b where Rav answers regarding a son of a non Jew and Jewish mother that he should go to a place where know no one knows them and conceal it. The Rov of Crown Heights, HaGaon HaRav Zalman Shimon Dworkin z”l once officiated a wedding of a convert <em>lechumra</em> and a Cohen being that as the term implies, when there is a Chazaka(1) that the person is Jewish he/she only goes through the process of conversion out of doubt. Even if you are a full convert there’s no obligation for you to explicitly express you are a convert in a resume, that’s up to the other side to find out when making reference calls. Nevertheless, most of the times in Shidduchim it’s better to be upfront about things. When it comes to getting called up to the Torah I heard from a prominent Rov who said that although lechatchila it’s better to use ben Avrohom Avinu, in a case where the person is sensitive you may omit Avinu or even say ben Reb Avrohom. A convert who’s biological or adoptive father is Jewish or another convert in a case of embarrassment or feeling uncomfortable because of Kavod Habrios he may be called up by the name of the person who raised him. In truth there is nothing to be ashamed of in this case but you don’t have to carry the title as a badge. The same Din applies regarding a Baal Teshuva. If a random person asks you if you are a Ger directly and you’re not comfortable with answering, I suggest you somehow cleverly dismiss or ignore the question and change the subject making it clear you don’t want to touch it. Hope this answered you’re question!</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Din might be different when the Giur Lechumra is done because there is an essential Sofek without a Chazaka like in a case of IVF where the egg belonged to a gentile Jewish woman. In such a case I don’t know if the Giores Lechumra may marry a Cohen. See this <a href=\"https://halacha.co/%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%93-%D7%9E%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%A0%D7%9B%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A7%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%AA/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuva</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><a href=\"https://halacha.co/%D7%9B%D7%99%D7%A6%D7%93-%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link</a> <a href=\"https://halacha.co/%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%99%D7%94-%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%92%D7%A8-%D7%91%D7%9F-%D7%92%D7%A8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Link</a> Teshuvos about how a Ger gets called up to the Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A convert is inevitably forced to reveal his past in certain cases. One such case would be a marriage, in which not only is it standard practice for the officiating beis din to require proof of one's Jewish identity, but also where his name will be recorded on the kesubah as \"ben Avrohom Avinu\". Similarly, when called up to the Torah a convert will be revealed for the same reason.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, a convert doesn't have to reveal his status to everyone. Additionally, there is a mitzvah to not embarrass others (based loosely on Vayikra 19:18, 25:17), so if a convert would become embarrassed if his past were revealed, it seems to me that one should not spread the information when not absolutely necessary.</p>\n\n\n",

He adds that if someone had a shofar but didn't know the brachot of מלכויות‎, זכרונות, and שופרות, they should say the bracha לשמוע קול שופר (ie. the three brachot in musaf are like the ברכת המצוה on shofar, and without them, we need to say a specific bracha on shofar).</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the case here? Is this a case where the shofar blasts before musaf were not sounded, and so the first bracha of לשמוע קול שופר wasn't already said? Is this a case before the pre-musaf shofar blasts were even instituted? Did Langeudoc (where Meiri lived) not sound the shofar before musaf? Or perhaps Meiri requires saying the bracha twice, once before the first set and then again before the further blasts? This latter is hard for me to accept, since why would we need to say the same bracha again immediately after the first set?</p>\n\n\n",

I asked him about the documented cases and he wasn't sure.</p>\n<p>I asked him if we could reconcile to 2 things by suggesting that a person who does a past-life-regression isn't seeing their own past-life necessarily (which would require knowing and accessing their own soul's history) but they are accessing someone else's real life memories (which does not require tapping into the \"correct\" soul). This then would be an instance of telepathy, which Rav Dessler says is definitely possible.</p>\n<p>Rav Breitowitz said that that is a possibility, and he added that it would be a type of \"chibbur nishamos\". So that the one doing the past-life-regression, may be connecting with a real character in history, and yet the person's own individual soul history would remain unknown.</p>\n<p>From these 2 rabbonim, I took out that it is permitted (no less than an imaginary story for the sake of therapy) but that it's limits should be recognized.</p>\n<p>The way I understood it is that even if you are connecting to a real past life, it would based on your <strong>current</strong> life (you'd be connecting to someone with a similarity to your current life's challenges and situations etc) and so your past life would remain a mystery.</p>\n<p>If I may add one more point that I took out of this: what happened to you in a past life is irrelevant to your current life. Meaning, even if some things from your past life brought you to your current situation so that you can work on whatever you need to work on, that mission or whatever you want to call it is <strong>here now</strong>, and you have all the information and tools to deal with it, because Hashem gives everyone everything they need to fulfill their task in life. (And I know that past-life-regressors may disagree with me because they'll find current life problems rooted in a past life, but I'll disagree with their conclusion, and I explained above).</p>\n<p>So, in a nutshell: Permitted but do it with a grain of salt.</p>\n\n\n",

I confess that they leave me very perplexed.</p>\n<p>It is true, in Gemara-Yevamot 37b Rav Eliezer ben Yaacov develops an exegesis of Leviticus 19:29,if I remember correctly also used by Rambam in Hilchot Naarah Betulah 2:17, based on the reason on prohibiting sexual promiscuity to prevent the risk of unconscious incest, since if an individual does not know who his father is he could for example one day marry his brother / sister without knowing it; however, at what point of the two Talmudim it would be stated that the punishment of the adulterer or promiscuous individual ex Deuteronomy 23:18 requires the natural fertility of forbidden sexual intercourse?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Non-marital sex (and even prostitution) is permitted for Noahides, by the way. Adultery is not.</p>\n<p>It is true that in Maimonides' list of commandments, his brief comment justifying the prohibition on non-marital sex (for Jews) is \"it can lead to all sorts of unintentional incest.\"</p>\n<p>But from a legal perspective, neither of these prohibitions make exceptions based on either partner's fertility.</p>\n<p>Maimonides did not have the power to say that there was ONE reason for a Torah prohibition, and if you avoid that reason you are therefore allowed to do it. He was giving (on his own) one point to help understand why this was a useful law. (Though ultimately we do it because God said so.)</p>\n<p>Even if we accept \"unintentional incest\" as the \"main\" reason, laws often don't make distinctions. A professional race car driver will still get a speeding ticket for driving double the speed limit, even if they can prove they are perfectly safe at that speed. So it's not \"well THIS particular non-marital liaison will cause a problem\", but \"once we allow any, things will quickly get out of hand.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Demisexual and the Halachic Ramifications therein\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the Cleveland Clinic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Demisexuality is a sexual orientation. People who identify as demisexual only feel sexual attraction to someone after they’ve formed a strong emotional bond with them. Compared to the general population, most people who are demisexual rarely feel sexual attraction. Some have little to no interest in sexual activity.\nMost people in the general population can feel sexual attraction regardless of whether they form an emotional bond with someone. They may feel sexually attracted to strangers or to new people they meet. But people who are demisexual don’t feel this initial sexual attraction.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Has there been any Halachic literature/responsa that's discussed this orientation? How would the laws of Yichud or Shomer Negiah, for instance, be affected by a person having this orientation? Perhaps there is not an <em>issur yichud</em> for such an individual with a single woman a man does not know?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Demisexuality sounds like an advantage in pursuing prishus and tahara but I don't see why it would exempt one from any halachos since we generally don't carve out exemptions for people who feel that they would be exempt from the temptation (see Shabbos 12b for an often-quote non-sexual example).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There is a small limb in a man: if he starves it, it is satisfied; if\nhe satisfies it, it is hungry\" (Sukkah 52b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As Ezra said in the comment to the question, what you are describing sounds like an ideal, and a healthy person by Torah standards. If a person is holy, then they are capable of being in the presence of attractive people and not have uncontrollable arousal.</p>\n<p>As far as I know, the answer to your first part is no, there is no discussion of people who <em>cannot</em> become aroused without an emotional bond. Such a situation bears no halachic significance (there is no halacha that one is required to experience arousal, the closest we will get would be responsa on עונה when one is unable to perform their duty, but presumable this will never be due to demisexuality?), so it wouldn't come up.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is because the laws of <em>yichud</em> and other similar laws of intimacy are based on the idea that <em>yichud</em> and intimacy is an <strong>objective reality, not a subjective feeling</strong>. This is why there is no exception for being secluded with someone that one is not attracted to (See SH EH 22:1), nor is there any prohibition for being secluded with someone of the same gender that one <em>is</em> attracted to (although there is more to say on that latter point in responsa, which is irrelevant here). One cannot make an exception to the laws of <em>shomer negiah</em> even if one doesn't become aroused when one simply shakes the hand of someone of the opposite gender.</p>\n<p>So, it is irrelevant that a demisexual has no subjective feelings of attraction in cases of <em>yichud</em>, <em>shomer negia</em> etc. It is still prohibited.</p>\n\n\n",

The Minchas Yitzchok maintains that even according to the Tzlach it is still not on a level of בשעה שהציבור מתפללין, but nevertheless the tefillah has merit.</p>\n<p>The Mishna Berura in 90:30 writes, based on the Tzlach, as follows :\"ואם מתפלל עמהם בביה\"כ מיקרי תפילת הצבור\" which the Minchas Yitzchak points out, sounds like it is real tefillah betzibur and contradicts the Minchas Yitzchok's understanding in the Tzlach and Magen Avraham.</p>\n<p>Others (Ishay Yisroel 8:14 footnote 38) also interpret the mishna berura to not mean that it is real tefillah betzibur.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where does 'lev melochim beyad hashem' apply\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone was discussing with me siyata dishmaya during the second World War. He spoke about how Churchill came to power and inevitably fought against Hitler. So he quoted Rav Miller from gateshead saying that it was lev melochim beyad hashem.\nIf that is the case, then surely it should apply the other way around, as dark as it sounds, that these despotic horrific leaders too would be in control by hashem.\nAny thoughts, or meforshim would be enlightening.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Chasom Sofer (parsahs V'Yagash) and other meforshim say that Lev melech beYad Hashem   doesn't mean that a king does not have bechira at all because as this question points if that were the case  no king would be accountable for his actions.</p>\n<p>Instead it means  that when  davening to Hashem to change the kings mind for the good  it is easier to have his mind changed that of a regular person. While for regular people Hashem rarely interferes with their bechira he does so more readily and frequently for a king. At the times that Hashem did not do that his bechira holds him accountable for the good and the bad.</p>\n<p>However even if one were to assume that he indeed has no bechira the answer to the question of why is he held accountable isn't so different than the general question of why is <em>anyone</em> held accountable for harming someone else else, didn't Hashem want that person to be injured or it would not have happened ? While some like Rav Saadya Gaon say that Hashem gives  people  the bechira to injure others  even when he doesn't want the other person harmed, those who disagree say that Hashem has many other ways of causing the second person to be injured he had it done through this person because he was anyways guilty of wanting to do so (magaliglim chova al yedey chayiv)</p>\n<p>Similarly a guy like Hitler wasn't this great guy who all the sudden when he found himself the German leader decided to do all sorts of evil. He was always an evil person way before he became the German leader. Being that Hashem wanted these things to happen he made Hitler the German leader. As leader Hashem saw to it that he did not have a change of heart even at times when it may have been beneficial for him to do so. Ditto for Winston Churchill. Because Hashem wanted that outcome he has Winston Churchill elected. Had Chamberlin stuck around he would have done the same things as Churchill but his own actions and way he lived his personal life before getting elected caused him to lose that  zchus</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This week's Toras Avigdor actually mentioned this issue (I think this is a different Rav Miller whom you quoted). He says quite openly that the real blame is on the Jewish nation:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yYiXQ.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/yYiXQ.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://torasavigdor.org/parshas-bechukosai-sin-and-exile/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://torasavigdor.org/parshas-bechukosai-sin-and-exile/</a></p>\n<p>In case you're interested, in other places he says much more than this. I can find it if you want.</p>\n\n\n",

So too, the strip of crimson wool that was tied to the head of the goat that was sent to Azazel did not turn white, and the westernmost lamp of the candelabrum did not burn continually. And the doors of the Sanctuary opened by themselves as a sign that they would soon be opened by enemies, until Rabban Yoḥanan ben Zakkai scolded them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm in a debate with a Christian missionary who seems to think that this proves that his dead man was the Messiah. He sees the 40 years as corresponding with the time of his death. So my question is why did these miracles stop 40 years before the destruction of the Temple? Is there some significance to the 40 years? I thought they may correspond to the 40 years in the desert in some way.</p>\n\n\n",

The following points are pertinent to your question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>(ois alef) One who is doing Shemirah is exempt from krias Shemah and any tefillah. (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.71.3?ven=Sefaria_Community_Translation&vhe=Maginei_Eretz:_Shulchan_Aruch_Orach_Chaim,_Lemberg,_1893&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 71:3</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.341.6?ven=Code_of_Hebrew_Law_by_Chaim_N._Denburg,_Montreal,_1955&vhe=Ashlei_Ravrevei:_Shulchan_Aruch_Yoreh_Deah,_Lemberg,_1888&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 341:6</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.403.9?ven=Code_of_Hebrew_Law_by_Chaim_N._Denburg,_Montreal,_1955&vhe=Ashlei_Ravrevei:_Shulchan_Aruch_Yoreh_Deah,_Lemberg,_1888&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA YD 403:9</a>). Therefore one can arrange, if possible, that there be two shomrim, so that one can guard whilst the other goes and says Shemah and davens. This idea I also saw brought down in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31174&st=&pgnum=51&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">first cheilek of Gesher HaChaim, perek hei</a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>(<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46539&st=&pgnum=89\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ois ches</a>) Even though it is forbidden to to daven and say divrei Torah in front of the deceased, it is permitted to say tehillim. (This idea is also brought in Gesher HaChaim linked above). Even an <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Onen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">onein</a> can say tehillim (this is further elaborated later <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46539&st=&pgnum=133&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (ois gimmel)) as they are doing it to respect the deceased. However others are stringent since an onein by definition is patur (exempt) from doing any mitzvos.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So to answer your questions. General tefillos are avoided unless there is someone else there with you so that you can go and daven elsewhere whilst they guard. And as far as tehillim, one can recite (and I have read elsewhere that it is encouraged) but there is no set standard or formal selection.</p>\n<p>However there is sefer which is cited by both the Nitei Gavriel and Gesher HaChaim entitled <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/14051\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ma'avar Yabok</a> by <a href=\"https://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/20-aaron-berechiah-ben-moses-ben-nehemiah-of-modena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Aharon Berachia of Modina</a> which provides select sections from throughout tanach (incl. Tehillim) that one can work through.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The ten Tehillim of Tikkun haKlali (16 32 41 42 59, 77 90 105 137 150, to be read in that sequence that they occur) are always appropriate and especially at Shemira.

    "content": "# How did Joseph become vizier under Pharaoh, an idol, without violating the prohibition against encouraging others to idol worship? Same Q for Esther\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm definitely not suggesting either Joseph or Esther broke this prohibition (at all, or at worst unless it was necessary to save life or other exceptions granted by the Torah). I have little knowledge of the answer either way but assume the best. I only ask the question as a thought exercise to better understand the distinctions between when it is encouraging idol worship and when it isn't.</p>\n<p>The pharaohs in Egypt considered themselves gods, and many in the population were ignorant, uneducated, poor, and believed it (or just idolatrous by nature regardless of those factors). Joseph became #2 in the nation, and had the attire to go with the position. How did he assume that title of vizier under those circumstances, and embody that position and all that went with it, without encouraging others in the court and the Egyptian citizens to idol worship him?</p>\n<p>Same idea in Persia with Esther. In order to get Achashverosh to want to marry her, she may have had to look attractive and appeal to his physical, egoistic nature. At least, it seems like his type might have not seen her inner beauty most of the time, and that he might have looked at her as more than a trophy, in some sense an idol. He may have idolized her beauty and so on. So if his attention was of an idolatrous nature, then if she ever had to wear nice clothes and so on to keep his interest, did she encourage him to idol worship? (This is definitely not suggesting she did anything to bring any horrible treatment on herself, absolutely not, please do not misconstrue it that way. And everything she did was needed for the Jewish people to be saved. I only mean it as a way to ask the halachah question).</p>\n<p>I also think it's a relevant question to today for anyone who works in the public domain in any type of job that is popular, that people will idolize. If you become the best violinist in the world, and you play publicly, there is going to be 1 out 10,000 or however many who comes to see you play, and is trying to learn themselves, who may come to idolize you (not always the same as idol worship but sometimes), and put pictures of you up all over their room, and make you a hero of their worship in some sense. Have you then encouraged idol worship? And that's not even a profession where the public nature of it has a really big \"brand promotion\" culture. What if you are an entrepreneur in such a business and you are promoting yourself and your \"brand\" via social media in order to build your business, and you sell a luxury lifestyle, and your personality and projecting an attractive image are central to promoting your business model? Have you encouraged idol worship?</p>\n<p>I know there are certain exceptions for certain prohibitions, so I'm presuming that will be part of the answer, and I would also like to get into the distinctions of when being popular or powerful crosses the line into encouraging idol worship even in cases you don't have an exception because of a different category, if that makes sense, as well as into those distinctions and when they do and don't apply in such cases. Thank you/Toda rabah.</p>\n\n\n",

The ika d'amri suggests that actually the \"bo\" is coming to teach a halacha said by R Yehuda amar Rav that it is assur to be mekadesh a woman you haven't seen.</p>\n<p>Tosofos asks:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי איתמר דרב יוסף אסיפא איתמר - ולהכי לא מוקי ארישא וכגון שמכירה משום דהא מנ\"ל דלמא מתני' מיירי בין מכירה ובין אין מכירה <strong>ואפי' איסורא איכא</strong> ומלתא דרב יוסף לא נדע</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm trying to understand pshat in the Tosofos, in particular according to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bach%2C_Even_HaEzer.35.2.1?vhe=Tur_Even_HaEzer,_Vilna,_1923&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bach</a> on the Tur:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכתבו התוספות הא דלא מוקמינן לדרב יוסף ארישא וכגון שמכירה משום דא\"כ קשה מנ\"ל לרב יוסף דבמכירה איכא מצוה בו יותר מבשלוחו דילמא ליכא אפילו מצוה והא דקתני בו ובשלוחו משום דמתניתין מיירי בין מכירה ובין אינה מכירה ותני בו היכא דאין מכירה דאיכא איסורא <strong>וקתני בשלוחו היכא דמכירה דליכא אפילו מצוה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Specifically, why does Tosofos say dilma <em>afilu</em> issur ika, and why does the Bach interpolate that perhaps \"u'b'shlucho\" is coming in a case of makira to teach \"<em>afilu</em> mitzvah leika\"? What lesser chiddush we comparing these suggestions to that it should use the word afilu to refer to them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Without the אפילו one may have thought that though it is not a mitzvah, it would still be a הידור to act oneself, by using the word אפילו Tosfos\\Bach is stressing that it makes absolutely no difference whether בו or whether בשלוחו</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37962&st=&pgnum=415\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">יעב\"ץ</a> on that Tosfos explains that he means to say that from the Reisha we would have said that there is even an issur (even if he knows the girl beforehand) to appoint a shliach and not do it yourself, not only just not having a mitzvah. The only reason the Mishna would of mentioned a shliach is to tell us that in the event that a person did appoint a shliach, even though it was assur, it would still be considered a good kiddushin.</p>\n<p>Knowing this, perhaps, that is what the Bach is trying to argue with. He holds, only in a case where he did not know her would there be an issur (of R' Yehuda) and in a case where he did know her it would be lacking a mitzvah but not assur.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>R. Yosef is saying that there is a general preference to do things yourself, rather than through an agent. Tosafot’s point is that you can’t prove that from the first clause of the Mishnah, because the Mishnah may mean that there is not (merely) a preference to do it yourself here, it is actually forbidden to use an agent (because of R. Yehuda’s concern).</p>\n<p>The Bach is merely elaborating on how to allocate this among the cases of prior recognition of the woman and not prior recognition. In a case where he does already know what she looks like there is no preference at all between marrying her yourself or via an agent. The reason why the Mishnah specifies that he can do it himself is to tell us that in a case where he has not previously seen her, it is not merely a preference — it is outright forbidden to do it any other way. And the reason why the Mishnah specifies an agent is precisely to tell is that if he has already seen her there is not even a preference.</p>\n<p>When Tosofos says \"afilu issur ika\", and the Bach says \"afilu mitzvah leika\", these “afilu”s are contrasting the ends of the spectrum. There are three options: 1. You must do it yourself (שמא תתגנה) 2. it is preferable to do it yourself 3. There is no preference at all. The point of “afilu” is to skip the second option: not only is it not required to do it yourself, it’s not even preferable. And the reverse: not only is it not neutral, it’s actually forbidden to use a shaliach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Kuzari and Samaritanism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I want to know how the kuzari principle can hold in light of the history of Sammaritanism as a religion. By our chronology, the Samaritan population illegitimately converted and were all convinced that they were the original Jews and they were in fact present in Ancient Israel and broke off from mainstream society during the time of Eli to form a distinct group. By the Kuzari principle such a story could not be fabricated for the same reason that the story of matan torah could not be fabricated, so how can this be explained? It's also important to mention that it is the consensus among scientists that Samaritans and modern Jews are genetically related, which one could argue corroborates their beliefs.</p>\n<p>It's very important to me to find an answer for this question because my faith is very contingent on kuzari as a proof, and I want to say that I have rational reasons to believe in torah.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Like most questions on the Kuzari proof this question revolves around a different question. Can people rewrite history? The answer to that is \"yes\". The government, media  and propagandists do it all the time. The Kuzari doesn't suggest otherwise.</p>\n<p>What you <em>can’t</em> do is rewrite history when  that revision  (1)will force  people to make both major personal and societal life changes while (2) you are insisting that  that either you PERSONALLY  saw those events take place or your ancestors  personally saw those events and have ALREADY  been keeping  those personal and societal life changes  even since the story place if  the people you are speaking to never heard about your claims.</p>\n<p>You can also probably  convince people (with major difficulty of course) that a certain custom of unknown /unclear origin  is kept for a made up reason but you would not be able to do so if the custom itself is inherently clear that it   only exists to commemorate something. Which is the case by most of the mitzos that are zecher l’yitzas Mitzrayim.</p>\n<p>Even propagandists and history rewriters have their limits of what they can sell. Such  claims are going past the limits. E.g in today’s times both the stronger opponents and stronger  supporters of  Trump seem very eager to believe all sorts of baloney about him but you could never convince either group that his first inauguration never happened or that his second one did. Everyone  being told that would know that if I did not see or  hear about it already  then it CAN not be true. That is what the Kuzari is saying.</p>\n<p>Such an argument and those criteria do not apply to the Samaritan beliefs.  There is nothing inherently preventing propagandists from retroactively claiming  to have broke off from the main group  during the times of Eli. There were no changes to Samaritan life being demanded by such a claim. What counterevidence would there have been at a much later  time? At the much later date when this claim was being  introduced  anyone questioning “why didn’t I hear about it” would be given  the same claim of superior  knowledge that all propagandists and rewriters of history make.</p>\n<p>As far as DNA is concerned it makes sense that there would be  some shared DNA between Jews and Samaritans and that Samaritans would also have DNA like Jews do . At the time their status was unclear there were probably plenty of intermarriages. There    also probably was a decent sized OTD crowd who became Samaritans. Additionally  I have  seen claims  that the DNA evidence  backs up the Jewish version  of events .</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>R Dovid Gottlieb argues for the Kuzari Principle in his book <a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/reason-to-believe/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reason to Believe</a>, and he responds to the counter arguement from the Samaritans <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiM_rXbEj00FQSOrv9dOqOC-WQphDvyplvIiMgZc7WQ/edit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (on page 25 and 26).</p>\n\n\n",

One of her children is a talented athlete who is on a local community football team.  Since the children's father no longer is living with them, this boy us now the man of the house, so to speak. I have found him to be very mannerly and agreeable when his mom asks him to help around the house and he has also helped me on several occasions. Even though he is only twelve years old, he is big and strong and quite capable and I feel like I would like to reward him.</p>\n<p>Since he is the kicker for his team, as well as fullback and linebacker, and I have seen him in action, I thought that it would be great if I got him a regulation football and a kicking net, so that he could practice kicking at home. What I would include in my gift would probably cost less than two hundred dollars.</p>\n<p>My wife believes that it is inappropriate for me to give him or the other children gifts of any kind, even though the tenants are my neighbors as well as my tenants. She says that these people are none of my business. I say that if I can make a child happy and encourage him to practice a skill that may make him more successful when he might compete to be the kicker on his future high school team, I would like to see that happen. I think this might also be a good lesson for the boy in 'paying it forward' encouraging the boy to look for opportunities in his future life to help others rather than seek to repay me for my gift to him.  I think my wife is wrong to discourage me from involving myself in the lives of my neighbors. What do my Jewish values say about my wanting to help my neighbors? By the way, I let my lady tenant know what I am doing and she approves of it.</p>\n\n\n",

Also interested in other aspects of the verse\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The verse states, \"Behold, with iniquity I was formed, and with sin my mother conceived me. Most the commentaries are not available in english (<a href=\"https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Tehillim/51.6#e1n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Tehillim/51.6#e1n6</a>). Some explain about David ha-melech's mother, and some about his father. Onkelos in the Targum comments, \"Behold, in iniquities my father thought to create me; and in the sin of the evil impulse my mother conceived me.\" If \"father\" refers to Yishai, how can we reconcile that with Shabbat 55b which says Yishai had no sin or flaw of his own? If \"father\" referred to Hashem, how could Hashem create in iniquity, unless it should be read that Hashem of course created with purity, but <em>created David with iniquity in him</em> in order to give him an obstacle to overcome to earn his reward? And similar questions for the mother aspect of the interpretation on any levels it could apply (about Nitzevet, about Eve, and if applicable about the Shechinah, which I'm not saying it is, just that I'd like to learn those interpretations too <em>if</em> they exist).</p>\n<p>Another midrash, google translates as \"Both in my sinful space and in G-d - the tendency to sin and iniquity is natural in man.\" You cannot go off google translations, sometimes they are correct, sometimes they make huge errors that have heretical implications. I would discount any translation that flirted with the idea of sin in G-d as heretical and wrong, but since some texts do flirt with the idea of illicit desire within G-d, I can't know if it's the translation or if this commentary is exploring a similar idea? So I am asking for help to learn the key concepts from the most instructive commentaries on this verse, whether from the ones available in english on altorah or elsewhere. For example they don't have many of the major kabbalists there, but that is not my focus, since if there are non-kabbalists with great interpretations elsewhere, I am just as interested in those. In general I am always searching for the interpretations that mean the most to me and expand my scope of contemplation the most (part of the process of understanding but that is a much longer process). I seem to connect most with the more philosophic and (at first) counter-intuitive interpretations which are often found with the kabbalists, thus my interest, but many times these come from non-kabbalists also, or sometimes I connect to the peshat or pemez more than the derash or sod. It just depends on a case by case basis, which is why I always want to know the full scope of the interpretations, from the most \"simple\" explanations to the most complex.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm not aware of the source of the Targum quoted by Alhatorah. The official Targum quoted in the Hebrew does not mention his father. (Btw, Onkelos only translated the Pentateuch. Yonasan ben Uziel translated Prophets. The Targum to Writings is of uncertain authorship.) However, even if that is a valid Targum, your question is already answered from a different angle:</p>\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://shas.alhatorah.org/Full/Shabbat/55b.3#e0n6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha</a> there who is responding to a similar question from Tosafos:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ארבעה מתו בעטיו של נחש – והא דכתיב (קהלת ז) כי אדם אין צדיק בארץ וגו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>that the verse in Ecclesiastes 7 says explicitly that there is no man without sin.</p>\n<p>He answers that the everyone has some sin, but the Gemara means that the sin of Yishai and the others was not great enough to deserve death, so they only died as a result of the sin of Adam.</p>\n<p>This also answers your question. The sin of Yishai in conceiving David was not enough for him to die. After all, laying with the maidservant was not technically forbidden, and thus while it may have been a failing (the literal translation of חטא means to be missing something) it was not a sin that deserved death.</p>\n\n\n",

And yet according to the opinion that the person expropriated his own property, the consecration is valid. If another person engages in relations with her willfully, he is liable for kerait and if he engages in relations with her inadvertently, he is liable to bring a sin offering.

    "content": "# Are there things we can do in linear time that G-d cannot? (By His design and His design only. There is no limitation of Him unless He would plan it)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Chassidus there is a concept that G-d wanted a dwelling place in the lowest world, and humanity has a unique role of action in this world. However, we see in Torah that when G-d wants to intervene in the lowest world with miracles, He can do that. Of course G-d can do anything in general, but my question is after creating and exiling Israel to the lowest world, and the exile of the Shechinah to the lowest world, if there are any ways in which G-d so to speak locked aspects of Himself out, or aspects of His power out of the lowest world? Are there things now that only we can do, that He left to us to do, that even if He wanted to intervene after the fact, He no longer could because He planned it that way? In other words, from G-d's perspective, it might be something like, \"not only do I want you to do this mission, but I trust you so much, and I've put so much of Myself into you down there with an illusion of separation between you and My essence, that I've made it so that the only way this mission can be completed is if you do it. I am literally locked out from doing it for you. I put Myself and the whole future in your hands. I locked out my ability to come in and save the day if you were to fail. It has all been given to you to do\"? Or no?</p>\n<p>And perhaps the exile of the Shechinah, if you exile part of your power to a state of separateness, or at least not as direct a connection to your essence, then from the perspective of human logic, say if you take an electrical circuit with a perfect connection at the essence, and separate it out through many contractions of the power, it will have less capability in certain respects at the end of the circuit than before. Now of course G-d is infinite so even if something is taken further away from His essence, would He just have infinitely more of it, so there would be no effect? Logically you can think about it from different ways, but I'm interested what the Rabbinic opinions are on this, not my own.</p>\n<p>And the third aspect of this would be, is there any sense where maybe G-d can still intervene with miracles of nature, but something like a cell phone or a computer chip, only humans can make that now? Of course if G-d at the beginning wanted to make a computer chip, He could immediately, I am not implying different, but could that be an example of something locked in only for humans to be able to do now? Maybe because G-d is transcendent, the fact he made us in linear time has some sort of limiting capacity on what He can do during this stage? (Again, <em>it would only be by His design, I am not implying any limitation of G-d whatsoever except if He in His infinite wisdom intended it to be so only under specific circumstances. That is very important</em>). Or do no such concepts exist? Basically I'm not saying G-d is not the one with all the master keys. He is. But I am asking if He put some of the keys to the door of this level of reality inside of the door, with us, and then locked those from outside, not in every respect of course, as seen by His miracles in Torah, but in some, so that there are certain things at this stage He could not do here but we can?</p>\n<p>Edit. There is also a concept in computer science that a program always results in things the programmer did not intend or expect. I would never apply this to G-d on my own, since it creates the danger of taking the question from being about something G-d intended to something He didn't, but I leave it here as a corollary for answers to work off of. Perhaps there are concepts that since G-dliness is part of our souls, that that G-dliness when put under the limitation of this world and linear time yields unique inventions (\"creations\" in some sense) than G-dliness that is not bounded by these limitations, or some other way of understanding the unexpected results of programming-analogy on a theological level that does not contradict with Hashem being all knowing and all powerful. But the question is interested in explanations from either and any (kosher) perspective.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Sanhedrin 59a Prohibition Gentile Torah Study",
    "content": "# Sanhedrin 59a Prohibition Gentile Torah Study\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently watched a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh1CMFIXbDs\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">video</a> of Rabbi Manis Friedman discussing the obligations responsibilities for Noahides. To crudely summarize his argument: roughly speaking Jews are commanded to bring Heaven down to Earth while non-Jews are commanded to elevate Earth, precisely as G-d commanded Adam HaRishon. Within this perspective, Rabbi Friedman explains that the gentile prohibition of Shabbat exists because the willful adoption of this inapplicable Mitzvot removes the gentile from his obligations to toil in the world for the purpose of uplifting it. If he isn't engaging the world because he falsely binds himself to some Mitzvah, then he is supplanting his own will for G-d's.</p>\n<p>I thought I would revisit the Sanhedrin 59a to see if this interpretation is supported by the text (being a relatively unique but insightful opinion, as are most of Rabbi Friedman's). However, I do not know Hebrew, so I was hoping for a little help. According to the Sefaria gloss (also where I sourced the Hebrew and the translation of this Gemara), עוסק means \"one who is self employed.\" Would it be a fair reading of this Gemara to say that the prohibition concerns a \"gentile who employs himself in Torah,\" meaning he adopts Torah as his employment at the expense of his G-d given employment as the descendants of Adam? By contrast, one who sees Torah study as the means to give him strength to carry out his obligations has not rule afoul of the prohibition. He has not employed himself in Torah. This would seem to allow a better understanding of the objection the Gemara cites in the name of Rabbi Meir and it's resolution, that a gentile who is \"self-employed\" in his Sheva Mitzvot is considered to be a High Priest. The title \"High Priest\" seems to be most easily interpreted as indicating the strength of an occupation. Likewise, gentile \"self-employment\" in Torah study is compared to theft and adultery because by doing so, a gentile is attempting steal the occupation of a Jew (bringing Heaven down to Earth) for his own.  Needless to say, I'm wondering is this not the simplest way to read this Gemara?</p>\n<p>Thanks for your help!</p>\n<p>ואמר ר' יוחנן עובד כוכבים שעוסק בתורה חייב מיתה שנאמר (דברים לג, ד) תורה צוה לנו משה מורשה לנו מורשה ולא להם</p>\n<p>And Rabbi Yoḥanan says: A gentile who engages in Torah study is liable to receive the death penalty; as it is stated: “Moses commanded us a law [torah], an inheritance of the congregation of Jacob” (Deuteronomy 33:4), indicating that it is an inheritance for us, and not for them.</p>\n<p>מיתיבי היה ר\"מ אומר מניין שאפילו עובד כוכבים ועוסק בתורה שהוא ככהן גדול שנאמר (ויקרא יח, ה) אשר יעשה אותם האדם וחי בהם כהנים לוים וישראלים לא נאמר אלא האדם הא למדת שאפילו עובד כוכבים ועוסק בתורה הרי הוא ככהן גדול</p>\n<p>The Gemara raises an objection to Rabbi Yoḥanan’s statement from a baraita: Rabbi Meir would say: From where is it derived that even a gentile who engages in Torah study is considered like a High Priest? It is derived from that which is stated: “You shall therefore keep My statutes and My ordinances, which if a man does he shall live by them” (Leviticus 18:5). The phrase: Which if priests, Levites, and Israelites do they shall live by them, is not stated, but rather: “A man,” which indicates mankind in general. You have therefore learned that even a gentile who engages in Torah study is considered like a High Priest.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>עוסק does not mean self-employed. It means busy/involved/engaged with. Sefaria can be very useful, but it is also full of errors, as it is a community project.

I would assume that, all the moreso, one could benefit from a melacha done by a Jew who wasn't asked. Other than the time concern (how close to shabbos) there seem to be no limitations</p>\n<p>But on the second day of Yom Tov in Israel, concerning whether a disapora Jew can ask an Israeli to do melacha for him, <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Second_Day_of_Yom_Tov#cite_note-54\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halachipedia</a> reports</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yalkut Yosef (Kitzur S”A 496:27; Chazon Ovadyah (Yom Tov pg 138)) permits a non-Israeli to ask an Israeli to do melacha for him on Yom Tov Sheni. However, Sh”t Igrot Moshe 3:73 and Sh\"t Shema Shlomo 1:9 forbid. Rav Elyashiv (in Kuntres Teshuvot siman 54) writes that the only concern is Memotzi Chefsecha which is permissible for a dvar mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This doesn't address whether one can benefit from action not done expressly for him or her, but even to the question of asking directly, some opinions absolutely forbid and one imposes limitations.</p>\n<p>Why would there be any difference between the application of the law of \"asking a Jew to do what you cannot do\" in the two cases?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>RAv SZ\"A in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15096&st=&pgnum=186&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Shlomo 1:19;3</a> discusses this exact issue. He explains why it might be different - the reason early shabbos is mutar is because the person only accepted it upon himself because he chose to do so on his own volition. Therefore we say he only accepted things that pertain to him himself but not for the halacha of telling others (levush). On the second day of Y”T it’s not due to the person accepting it upon himself, but rather due to a safek of which day it is, therefore it’s applicable to all halachos both himself and for telling others. Another reason for early shabbos to be mutar is because he had the option not to be mekabel shabbos early and do the melacha himself, therefore he can ask others to do it for him (M\"A). On the second day of Y”T he doesn’t have a choice in the matter.</p>\n<p>He then proceeds to explain that indeed both these reasons do indeed apply on the second day of Y”T as well. The second day is also only a minhag and not miikar hadin, if it would be because of a real safek then those from Chu”l who are in E”Y for Y”T would only keep one day since it is not a safek in EY. By the fact that they keep 2 days in EY as well proves it is a minhag and is something that we accepted on ourselves of our own volition. As far as having an option to decline to accept it like early shabbos, he says that if a person were to decide in middle of Y\"T to live in E\"Y he would become mutar in melacha immediately (a highly debatable point between poskim) so he has the possibility to do the melacha himself just like early shabbos.</p>\n\n\n",

As the verse continues even when Esau was fully satiated he continued to disgrace the value of the birth right so  there was no taking advantage. Yaakov  bought something Esau clearly did not value at the time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>As others have and will doubtless continue to point out, it's very unlikely Esau was on the point of dying. He's clearly exaggerating how tired/hungry he is. So you won't find many people who would agree with you that Jacob extorted Esau.</p>\n<p>Having said that, you are asking if Jacob did right by Esau. And to do right by someone is defined as: \"To do right by means to treat someone in an ethical, moral, or honorable fashion. Do right by implies that one is making up for past wrongs inflicted on that person. Do right by is an idiom, related terms are did right by, does right by and doing right by.\" Based on this standard I can't say Jacob did right by Esau in the story you are discussing.</p>\n<p>Imagine instead of a birthright, we were discussing Esau's car that he got from Isaac since he was the first born/oldest. Imagine Esau is really not responsible with the car, and isn't driving Jacob around like he should have been. Now imagine you're father Isaac and you hear that Esau sold his car to Jacob for a pot of soup. You would be disappointed in Esau for having sold something so valuable for something so trivial. And you would also be disappointed in Jacob for having ripped off his brother by even making such an offer. To do right by someone is to act fairly, which means regardless of what Esau did with the car, Jacob should have offered something of more fair value. But Jacob didn't do that, he offered something of trivial value, knowing how much Esau didn't value the car, and took advantage of the situation. And while this isn't extortion, it's far from treating someone in a fair and just way. And in Genesis 27 Jacob does even worse things to his brother and his father, where he impersonates his brother in order to take a blessing meant for his brother.</p>\n<p>While there are commentators and Rabbi's who justify the actions of Jacob stealing the birthright from Esau in the story you mention, I find their justifications to be hollow. Because all their apologetics boil down to \"Esau didn't value the birthright, so it wasn't so bad that Jacob tried to buy it for an unfair price.\" The justifications for Jacob impersonating Esau also boil down to \"Esau wouldn't have done good things with the blessing and so of course it was better for Jacob to steal it!\" Followed by \"And Isaac gave Jacob another blessing so clearly it was the right thing!\" These apologists seem to forget that Jacob and Rivkah are literally telling their son to go into exile because of what he did. They aren't even trying to stop Esau from taking revenge, because they know that Esau is <em><strong>justified</strong></em> in wanting revenge. And the Torah itself does not appear to view Jacob as the righteous victim, because Jacob is tricked in a similar way by Laban and Leah. Leah under Laban's knowledge impersonated her sister while it was dark and Jacob could not see. It's the exact same situation except the genders are switched.</p>\n<p>But despite all that, and possibly <em><strong>because</strong></em> all that, I argue that Jacob does right by Esau in the end. Not only that, but Esau did right by Jacob by forgiving his brother despite what Jacob did to him as a youth.</p>\n<p>Despite Jacob supposedly \"buying\" the birthright, we see no evidence that the birthright was actually given to Jacob by Isaac in the Torah. Instead we find that Jacob is literally exiled for the entirety of Esau's life, and we hear no mention of a birthright being passed down. What we do see is that while Jacob has made a decent living and built a little family, Esau is wealthy enough to basically have his own army. So either God blessed Esau in wealth way more than Jacob, or Esau actually received financial assistance from Isaac in a way that Jacob did not since Jacob was in exile. Furthermore, while Isaac seems to believe that once a blessing is said it can't be changed or taken away, the Torah doesn't seem to believe that, at least not in an immediate literal way, and Jacob doesn't seem to believe that either.</p>\n<p>Isaac blesses Jacob as follows:</p>\n<p>Genesis 27:29, 27:39</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>יַֽעַבְד֣וּךָ</strong> עַמִּ֗ים (וישתחו) [וְיִֽשְׁתַּחֲו֤וּ] לְךָ֙ לְאֻמִּ֔ים\nהֱוֵ֤ה גְבִיר֙ לְאַחֶ֔יךָ וְיִשְׁתַּחֲו֥וּ לְךָ֖ בְּנֵ֣י אִמֶּ֑ךָ\nאֹרְרֶ֣יךָ אָר֔וּר וּֽמְבָרְכֶ֖יךָ בָּרֽוּךְ׃</p>\n<p>Let peoples serve you, And nations bow to you; Be master over your\nbrothers, And let your mother’s sons bow to you. Cursed be they who\ncurse you, Blessed they who bless you.”</p>\n<p>וַיַּ֨עַן יִצְחָ֜ק וַיֹּ֣אמֶר לְעֵשָׂ֗ו הֵ֣ן גְּבִ֞יר שַׂמְתִּ֥יו\nלָךְ֙ וְאֶת־כׇּל־אֶחָ֗יו נָתַ֤תִּי לוֹ֙ <strong>לַעֲבָדִ֔ים</strong> וְדָגָ֥ן\nוְתִירֹ֖שׁ סְמַכְתִּ֑יו וּלְכָ֣ה אֵפ֔וֹא מָ֥ה אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה בְּנִֽי׃</p>\n<p>Isaac answered, saying to Esau, “But I have made him master over you:\nI have given him all his brothers for servants, and sustained him with\ngrain and wine. What, then, can I still do for you, my son?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Isaac had blessed Jacob saying that his brother(s) would serve him, and it appears Isaac believes this fate cannot be changed. But the Torah shows zero examples of Esau serving Jacob, Esau bowing to Jacob, and Jacob never calls Esau his servant. In fact, Jacob does right by Esau by telling him that he has not accepted the blessing or Esau's servitude, and Jacob is in fact willing to offer his servitude to Esau, hinting that the proper owner of the blessing is Esau.</p>\n<p>Genesis 33:5</p>\n<p>וַיִּשָּׂ֣א אֶת־עֵינָ֗יו וַיַּ֤רְא אֶת־הַנָּשִׁים֙ וְאֶת־הַיְלָדִ֔ים וַיֹּ֖אמֶר מִי־אֵ֣לֶּה לָּ֑ךְ וַיֹּאמַ֕ר הַיְלָדִ֕ים אֲשֶׁר־חָנַ֥ן אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־<strong>עַבְדֶּֽךָ</strong>׃</p>\n<p>Looking about, he [Esau] saw the women and the children. “Who,” he asked, “are these with you?” He [Jacob] answered, “The children with whom God has favored <strong>your servant.</strong>”</p>\n<p>Instead of Jacob being haughty and calling Esau his servant, Jacob calls himself Esau's servant. Not only that, Jacob's entire family bows low to Esau, and Jacob implies that all he has belongs to his brother Esau. And because Jacob is offering his servitude to Esau, a complete reversal of the blessing he stole, Esau tells Jacob to keep everything of his, because Esau has enough.</p>\n<p>Genesis 33:8-9</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֕אמֶר מִ֥י לְךָ֛ כׇּל־הַמַּחֲנֶ֥ה הַזֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר פָּגָ֑שְׁתִּי\nוַיֹּ֕אמֶר לִמְצֹא־חֵ֖ן בְּעֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽי׃</p>\n<p>And he [Esau] asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I\nhave met?” He [Jacob] answered, “To gain my lord’s favor.”</p>\n<p>וַיֹּ֥אמֶר עֵשָׂ֖ו יֶשׁ־לִ֣י רָ֑ב אָחִ֕י יְהִ֥י לְךָ֖ אֲשֶׁר־לָֽךְ׃</p>\n<p>Esau said, “I have enough, my brother; let what you have remain\nyours.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah does not hide the sins of our ancestors. We are meant to learn from imperfect people, because we are all imperfect ourselves. And we learn the great merit of Jacob because after having so much taken from him by his uncle, he understood he had much to apologize and offer to his brother. Only at that point did Jacob do right by his brother, and did his brother do right by him.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Neḥunya’s attendants [gavzei] came and started beating Rabbi Akiva, for they felt that he was acting disrespectfully by highlighting Rabbi Neḥunya’s old age. Rabbi Akiva ran away from them, and he climbed up and sat upon the top of a date palm. From there, he said to Rabbi Neḥunya: My teacher, I have a question about the verse concerning the daily offering that states “one lamb” (Numbers 28:4). If it is stated “lamb” in the singular, why is it also stated “one”; isn’t this superfluous? Upon hearing Rabbi Akiva’s scholarly question, Rabbi Neḥunya said to his attendants: He is clearly a young Torah scholar, let him be. Rabbi Neḥunya then addressed Rabbi Akiva’s questions. With regard to the second question, he said to him: The word “one” teaches that the lamb should be the unique one of its flock, i.e., only the best quality lamb should be used. With regard to the original question, Rabbi Neḥunya said to him: In all my days I never accepted gifts. Nor was I ever inflexible by exacting a measure of retribution against those who wronged me. And I was always openhanded with my money.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And from this it may be slightly understood that R\"N Hagadol is not Rabbi Nechunyah ben Hakanah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How did Rabbi Heiman reach this conclusion? Is it because of the differences between what <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillah.28a.6?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R\"N ben Hakanah said</a> about his longevity?

His arguments have, at least superficially, the appearance of common sense. G-d \"breathed\" a G-dly soul into Adam, the ancestor of all man. Free will is the product of the interplay between the G-dly and animal souls, and the Torah requires non-Jews to have free will, otherwise the concepts of non-Jew reward and punishment make zero sense.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the vast majority of Kabbalists argue that only Jews have a G-dly soul. However, even from my little understanding of Kabbalah, it is explicitly clear that the G-dly soul begins as a point within the animal soul. In order to be entirely manifest, in each of its five \"levels\", it must be developed through proper action, with each completed \"level\" containing the beginning point for the next. Thus the initial point is expanded into a full Nefesh, and the new point within that completed Nefesh is expanded to a full Ruach, etc.. (see <em>Introduction to the Book of the Zohar</em> by the Baal HaShulam).</p>\n<p>Can it be argued (or are we <em>forced</em> to argue) that, while Maimonides discusses the <em>potential</em> for G-dly souls, the Kabbalists are discussing the <em>actuality</em>: that (in their time anyway) most non-Jews had done zero work building their G-dly soul up from its infinitesimal point, and therefore can be considered as having no G-dly soul? And if not, how do Kabbalists counter Maimonides' very sound justifications for the Jewish and non-Jewish equivalence in soul potential?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism have a concept of purgatory and if so what's the evidence?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Purgatory is often dismissed as being nothing more than a Roman Catholic doctrine that most Protestants do not believe, but does Judaism have a concept of purgatory of a state of purgation in which a soul goes to and if so what is the evidence for such a believe within the Jewish faith?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The concept of <em>purgatory</em> appears to be a situation in which a person is punished for his sins but eventually is redeemed after his punishment is over. As an example we see in <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/ask_db/ask_main.php/236/Q3/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kaddish: Eleven or Twelve</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Talmudic Sages teach that the maximum that a very wicked person is\npunished in the afterlife in gehinom is 12 months. The public\nrecitation of kaddish shields the departed soul from this punishment.\nHence, kaddish is recited during the first year after a parent's\npassing.</p>\n<p>However, the custom is to recite kaddish for 11 months only. Saying\nkaddish the entire 12 months would give the impression that the\ndeceased was a very wicked person who needs protection the entire 12\nmonths</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus the Jewish concept of punishment after death appears to be similar to the nonJewish concept of <em>purgatory</em>. The temporary punishment until the sins that a person has committed are atoned for.</p>\n<p>We see in Maseches Rosh Hashana at the bottom of 16B that there are three classes of people. The completely righteous are rewarded at once, the completely wicked are punished at once, and those in an intermediate state are punished for their sins until they have completed their atonement and <em>rise up</em>. Art Scroll Rosh Hashana 17a1 footnote 1 states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>1 I.e. they cry out from the pain for a short period of\ntime and then they leave Gehinnom (<em>Rashi</em>)</p>\n<p>[The purpose of Gehinnom is to rehabilitate a person so that he\ncan merit eternal life in the World To Come. Thus, after the ill\neffects of sin have been cleansed by the appropriate stay in Gehinnom,\nthe person leaves to enter the World To Come]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1443363/jewish/Chibut-Hakever-233.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kabbalistic concept</a> of the \"beating in the grave\" hibbut hakever, חיבוט הקבר.

The soul is the embodiment of our being; it is what makes us...us. The brain however, is the center of all our cognitive functions. It tells us what to do, makes connections, and differentiates between right and wrong. Now if the brain controls our thought process, and the Neshama makes us who we are, then how do they relate to each other? We wouldn't be who we are with just a Neshama, or just a brain. I am me because I think, speak, and act, but that is because of the brain sending messages all around the body. If our brains wouldn't work, we would not be alive. On the flip side, our Neshama is what also causes us to be us. And we know that when our Neshama leaves our body, we die. So the Neshama and brain must work together somehow to create a full human being, with thoughts, feelings, actions, and emotions. But does our Neshama influence the brain's thoughts? Or do our thoughts and actions from the brain influence our Neshama, affecting our spiritual self?</p>\n\n\n",

And when the spirit rested upon them, they spoke in ecstasy,\nbut did not continue.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.25?lang=bi&with=Or%20HaChaim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Or HaChaim HaKadosh</a>, the Ruach HaKodesh that was given to the seventy elders was of the quality of the Ruach HaKodesh from Moshe Rabbeinu himself. It was from the \"same level\". However, that did not impact the level of the Ruach Hakodesh from Moshe Rabbeinu, his Ruach Hakodesh remained intact.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאצל מן הרוח, He took from the spirit, etc. The word ויאצל may have been intended as a clue to the source of this prophetic spirit, i.e. the עולם האצילות, a domain very close to the throne of G'd. מן הרוח אשר עליו, \"from the spirit which was upon him;\" this may describe the quality of that spirit. The source of the spirit which was bestowed on the elders emanated not from Moses but from higher regions. Alternatively, it may mean that after the spirit which imbued Moses was given to the elders, עליו, Moses' own spirit remained fully intact. Bamidbar Rabbah 15 states that when Moses evaluated the level of prophecy the elders attained, it turned out that the 2 elders Eldod and Medod (numbers 71 and 72 respectively) had received a higher degree of prophetic spirit because their portion came from G'd directly, whereas the other seventy elders received their prophetic spirit only from Moses. This was why the seventy elders prophesied only briefly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.25?lang=bi&with=Rabbeinu%20Bahya&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bahya</a>, it was the Ruach Hakodesh from Moshe Rabbeinu that the seventy elders each received:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויהי כנח עליהם הרוח, “it was when the spirit rested upon them, etc.” This refers to the spirit of Moses which they received. Concerning the Holy Spirit received by Eldad and Meidad the Torah writes ותנח עליהם הרוח (verse 26), meaning this spirit came directly from G’d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.11.25?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> seems to explain that it was the Ruach HaKodesh of Moshe Rabbeinu that was \"put\" onto the seventy elders</p>\n<p>So, it seems that \"the Ruach Hakodesh from Moshe was given to the seventy elders\" refers to the level and status of the Ruach Hakodesh that was given to the seventy elders. It resembled the level of the Ruach HaKodesh from Moshe Rabbeinu. It does not mean that it was taken from Moshe, but it was on the same lavel as Moshes'.</p>\n\n\n",

I presume, because this page is partly titled \"Rashi's Commentary\" that Rashi sourced his comment from the rabbis before him.</p>\n<p>Which other candidates did other authorities, whether from the majority or minority opinion, also refer as the one fulfilling the title of the \"righteous\" in Chavakuk 2:4? (For me, for example, I would have thought, the \"righteous\" referred to \"Noach\" as he was thus called \"Righteous\" in Parashat Noach.)</p>\n<p>The Hebrew of this translation, \"but the righteous shall live by his faith\" (Chavakuk 2:4) does not have a definite article in front of the word \"righteous\"; is it correct, therefore, to translate it as if though it has a definite article; not that I know that that would make a difference, does it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are many commentaries and midrashim that specify other people or discuss the righteous person as a broader principle (e.g., Radak and others associate this with Israel, who survived because they didn't worship idolatry).</p>\n<p>But the idea of identifying King Jeconiah to the verse is connected to the first part of the verse. Midrash Tanhuma 4:2 specifically links the first part of the verse (\"his spirit within him is puffed up, not upright\") with Nebuchadnezzar (who, the midrash teaches, despite being puffed up as a king, was embarrassed by his own image because he was not upright and physically misshaped). By contrast, King Jeconiah was released after years in prison once Nebuchadnezzar died, by the successor to the throne, Nebuchadnezzar's son Avel-Marduk (cf. II Melachim  25:27). Considering this conflicting history of kings, Rashi links the Nebuchadnezzar midrash of the first part of the verse with Jeconiah as the \"righteous\" man of the passage, and borrows language from Vayikra Rabba (18:2) to support his comments on Avel-Marduk succeeding him.</p>\n<p>If you're looking for clearer reasoning, see the commentary of R. Yosef Kara (who lived contemporaneously in Troyes with Rashi). For Kara, Jeconiah represents the merit of Israel in returning from Babylonian exile. Kara also understands this and neighboring verses from Chavakuk as referring to the Babylonians, and so Jeconiah is an example of the righteous man who survived--indeed, released from captivity--<em>because</em> of his faith during this time, just as the prophecy declared with all of the Judean exiles :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וצדיק באמונתו יחיה - הוא גלות יכניה שחזרו מגלות בבל. וכן הוא אומר בירמיה \"כה אמר יי' אלהי ישראל כתאינים הטובות האלה כן אכיר את גלות יהודה אשר שלחתי מן המקום הזה ארץ כשדים לטובה. ושמתי עיני עליהם לטובה והשיבותים על הארץ הזאת ובניתים ולא אהרוס ונטעתים ולא אתוש\" (כד , ה - ו). וגם שם , שהיה בגלות , נאמר עליו \"וידבר אתו טובות ויתן את כסאו מעל לכסא המלכים אשר אתו בבבל\" (מ\"ב כה , כח).</p>\n<p><strong>The righteous shall live by his faith</strong>: This refers to the exiles [in the time of] of King Jeconiah, who returned from Babylonian exile. As it is said in Jeremiah (24:5-6): \"Thus said the LORD, the God of Israel: As with these good figs, so will I single out for good the Judean exiles whom I have driven out from this place to the land of the Chaldeans. I will look upon them favorably, and I will bring them back to this land; I will build them and not overthrow them; I will plant them and not uproot them.\" And similarly (II Mel. 25:28) [when Avel-Marduk released Jeconiah from imprisonment]: \"He spoke kindly to him, and gave him a throne above those of other kings who were with him in Babylon.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When did publishers stop asserting a monopoly on printings of books in the common domain?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Usually, when a book is published, it reflects the original creative work of scholars, authors and editors who deserve the benefit of that work. So naturally it’s understood that other parties are not supposed to simply re-print and sell that work as if it were their own, competing unfairly with the parties who did the work and earned the right to the benefit of that work.</p>\n<p>But when the Talmud was first produced on a movable-type printing press, it was accompanied by the assertion that nobody else was to print the Talmud for a certain period. This was not the usual assertion of creators’ right to the benefit of their work. The people asserting the right were not the authors of the Talmud, and they were not trying to prevent others from using their work at all. It was a more general ban on completely independent work that would compete to the detriment of the one asserting the right. It was as if I decided to sell ice cream and announced that nobody else was to sell ice cream, because that competition would make it hard for me to make money.</p>\n<p>I feel that I cannot stress this distinction enough.</p>\n<p>Today, when ArtScroll printed the Ramban’s commentary on the Torah, for example, they did some sort of research to decide upon a “best” Hebrew text of that commentary. They paid a team of translators to produce an English translation. Naturally they expect that nobody else will simply reprint the ArtScroll book and sell it in competition with ArtScroll. But they <em>did not</em> announce that nobody else is allowed to print any other edition of the Ramban’s commentary on the Torah. It seems clear enough that such a ban (on other, independent publications of the commentary) would be advantageous to ArtScroll and help them reap a greater profit on their work. But they just don’t assert such a right.</p>\n<p>My question is, how and when did this type of assertion go out of fashion? Were the original printings of the Talmud the only examples? Do we know of other publishers who sought such authorization from rabbis and were told that they did not have such a right to keep others from competing with them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the days when Rabbinic authority in Europe was far more <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Four_Lands\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">centralized</a>, it was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=BbxnAAAAcAAJ&pg=PP72&lpg=PP72&dq=%D7%A0%D7%97%22%D7%A9%20%D7%91%D7%92%D7%96%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%AA&source=bl&ots=qYe3jmbSIM&sig=ACfU3U3ZCbPB6n5cAX-6kzD3LdcTtld7QQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiM_bzm8an4AhUXoY4IHZSZDV4Q6AF6BAgaEAM#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">common</a> that they would decree under power of <em>cherem</em> that publications of important works would be protected for a certain amount of time, so that the sefer would be spread as far as possible, and its author would recoup his expenses.

If the Great Court did not have a ready answer, it would deliberate and come to a conclusion, and then inform the questioners and the local court (or its agents) that \"such and such is the law!\" They would then all leave and return to their local jurisdictions and knowledge of the law would spread from there and thence.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Sanhedrin 88b also makes it clear that on such occasions where a local court did not know the law, they did not go straight to the Great Court but rather they would first inquire of the courts in the surrounding cities:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הוצרך הדבר לשאול שואלין מבית דין שבעירן אם שמעו אמרו להן ואם לאו באין\nלזה שסמוך לעירן אם שמעו אמרו להם ואם לאו באין לזה שעל פתח הר הבית אם\nשמעו אמרו להם ואם לאו באין לזה שעל פתח העזרה</p>\n<p>If the matter was unclear and it was necessary to ask and clarify it,\nthose uncertain of the halakha would ask the court that is in their\ncity. If the members of the court heard a clear halakhic ruling with\nregard to that matter, they said it to them, and if not, they would\ncome to a court that is adjacent to their city. If the members of the\ncourt heard a clear halakhic ruling with regard to that matter, they\nsaid it to them, and if not, they would come to the court at the\nentrance to the Temple Mount. If the members of the court heard a\nclear halakhic ruling with regard to that matter, they said it to\nthem, and if not, they would come to the court at the entrance to the\nTemple courtyard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is reasonable to assume that after the law was determined by the Great Court, the local court which petitioned it would also inform the courts of those other cities which it had first inquired of as well. In this way knowledge of the law would spread throughout the nation.</p>\n<p>It was the duty of the court to first determine whether the law would take root and properly spread throughout the nation before instituting it (H. Mamrim 2:5). There were times where the law would fail to take root and fail to spread throughout the nation, and on such occasion, the law was nullified in and of itself (H. Mamrim 2:6).</p>\n\n\n",

On the fourteenth day of <em>Nisan</em>, when they had been mandated to bring the <em>Pesach</em> offering, they had been <em>tamei</em>. That is, “they were unclean, having come into contact with a dead body so that they could not keep <em>Pesach</em> on that day”. (<em>Bemidbar</em> 9:6).</p>\n<p>These individuals had wanted, apparently quite passionately, to bring the offering on the appointed day. They thus went to Moshe and Aharon and pleaded their case. Their “petition” was, basically, “Because we were <em>tamei</em> because of a corpse, why must we lose out on bringing the <em>Pesach</em> offering to Hashem?” They asked for a second chance.</p>\n<p>Moshe took their case to Hashem. And Hashem did indeed give them a second opportunity. We thus have <em>Pesach Sheni</em>, celebrated a month after <em>Pesach</em>.</p>\n<p>My question is the following: Why is it only <em>Pesach</em> that is given a “do-over holiday”? For example, surely there were individuals who were <em>tamei</em> at the time of <em>Sukkot</em>. They would thus have been forbidden from bringing a fire offering to Hashem. Why did these persons not ask Moshe for a “second chance”? (We are not told of their having done so, if in fact they did.)</p>\n<p>Why did individuals who were <em>tamei</em> at other appointed times for bringing an offering not ask Moshe and Aharon for the opportunity to do so after they had become <em>tahor</em>? Why is there not a “blanket second chance” a month later for persons who are <em>tamei</em> at the mandated time for an offering?</p>\n<p>I did check the StackExchange archives to see if this question had been asked previously. I did not find such a question. If I missed it, I apologize. I would be very grateful for the link or reference to that previous inquiry. Many thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On pessach the obligations (מצווה חיובית) of every Jewish person is to eat at least a kesayis of a korban pessach. If the individual is Tamei, he/she cannot be מקים that obligation, and thus cannot fully observe all the pessach obligation</p>\n<p>In contrast,. For all other Yamin tovim there is no specific chiyuv to bring and eat a certain korban. On succos, for example, everyone must shake the lulav, which even a tamei person can do. The korban that one would have to bring is an Olas Reiyah (if you were oleh regel to Jerusalem) , which even a tamei person can do by sending it to the bais hamikdash with a shaliach and not entering themselves. Meaning, that being tamei doesn't stand in the way of being מרים all mitzvos that are created by the Yom tov. This is why no second chance is necesssary</p>\n\n\n",

If we look at the Pesikta inside, it gives many different descriptions about the angels coming down with G-d when the Jews received the Torah. The simple understanding of the passages is it's simply to escort G-d, like you quote from other Midrashim. The specific line you're bothered with is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תרתין רבון דאלפי שנאן דמלאכין ירדו עם הקדוש ברוך הוא על הר סיני ליתן תורה לישראל</p>\n<p>Two hundred million angels came down with the Holy One, blessed is He, on Mount Sinai to give the Jews the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if you read the continuation, it again repeats the theme that it was simply for honor, and not to actually contribute anything.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולמה ירדו ר' חייא בר רבא לכבודה של תורה ור' חייא בר יוסי אמר לכבודם של ישראל</p>\n<p>Why did the angels come down? Rabbi Chiya the son of Rava says for the honor of the Torah. Rabbi Chiya the son of Yossi days for the honor of the Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So even according to the source you bring, there's no contradiction.</p>\n<p>I neither need nor want to address Josephus, as according to nobody is he an authority on Jewish theology. Rather, he's simply a useful historian who sometimes quotes correctly Torah sources. All the more so Herod, who in Jewish tradition is looked at as a murderer with lofty goals of expanding the Temple, but definitely not a scholar.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>The \"face to face\" interaction of God is through the angel(s), hence there is no contradiction. It doesn't imply Moses directly saw God, he only saw a little glory of God. The angel of God bears the name of God, and he is God himself. The intimacy and detailed nature of the communication makes it as \"face to face as a friend\". Abraham's interaction was also as direct, however the promise covenant made with Abraham (Gen 15) was unilateral by God alone, which is different from the conditional covenant with Moses as the mediator through angels. Although it can be a midrash intention to choose Angels as the means of the covenant, I believe there has been a tradition that emphasizes that the angels (of God) gave the Torah.</p>\n<p>Ibn Ezra on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Exodus.3.6.2?ven=Ibn_Ezra%27s_commentary_on_the_Pentateuch,_tran._and_annot._by_H._Norman_Strickman_and_Arthur_M._Silver._Menorah_Pub.,_1988-2004&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus 3:6:2</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND MOSES HID HIS FACE.

God answered him, for man shall not see Me and live (v. 20). This is the truth. For the senses only feel that which is transient. Therefore and they saw the God of Israel (Ex. 24:10), I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne (Is. 6:1), and the prophecies of Ezekiel79 were all visions of God. Look, Scripture here states, and thou shalt see My back. It states elsewhere, and the similitude of the Lord doth he80 behold (Num. 12:8). These things require a long explanation. Saadiah Gaon says that face81In My face shall not be seen (v. 24). refers to the face of the light. Let the face of the sun serve as an example.82 The back83 refers to the remaining light that cleaves to a person.84<code>That is, to the back of the divine light, which a person is able to behold (Weiser). See Saadiah Gaon’s Book Of Beliefs And Opinions, 2:11: “God has a special light which He creates and makes manifest to His prophets in order that they may infer therefrom that it is a prophetic communication emanating from God that they hear. When one of them sees this light, he says: “I have seen the glory of the Lord…” However, when they beheld this light, they were unable to look upon it because of its power and brilliance. Indeed, whoever looked upon it incurred the disintegration of his entire makeup and the flight of his spirit from his body. Moses accordingly asked his Master to give him the strength to look upon this light. The latter, however, answered him that the first rays of this light were so powerful that he would be unable to view them clearly with his naked eyes, lest he perish. He would rather cover him up with a cloud or the like until the first rays of this light had passed, because the greatest strength of every radiant body is contained in its initial approach. All of this was implied in the statement of Scripture: And I…will cover thee with My hand until I have passed by. Then when, the first portion of the light had passed, God removed from Moses the thing that had covered him, so that he might be able to look at the back of the light, as Scripture says: And I will take away My hand, and thou shalt see My back” (Saadiah Gaon, The Book Of Beliefs And Opinion. Translated by Samuel Rosenblatt, Yale University Press, 1948, p. 130).</code> There is no need for all of this.85<code>Saadiah’s interpretation of God’s face and back is wrong</code>. However, before I explain this let me say the following: Know that God only spoke to Moses face to face from the third series of forty days86 onward. Moses’ face shone because God passed by his face. Moses’ prophecy at first was through the angel who appeared in the bush.87. Scripture there states, And the Lord said (Ex. 3:7).88<code>Even though it wasn’t actually the Lord</code>. The same is true of And the Lord went before them (Ex. 13:21),89<code>Even though the reference is to the angel of the Lord.</code> for the messenger speaks in place of the one who sent him.90<code>The angel represents the Lord and delivers His message. Hence God’s angel is referred to as the Lord in Scripture.</code></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.biblestudying.net/history-of-judaism5.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Addendum</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As Sommer explains below, this same person of YHWH (the angel of YHWH) is the one who also appeared to and commissioned Moses in Exodus 3.</p>\n<p>A further example of this understanding of mal’akh as a humble and incomplete manifestation of Yhwh is found in another JE passage, Exodus 3-4. There we are initially told that a mal’akh appeared to Moses (3.2), but in the remainder of the chapter, it is Yhwh Himself who converses with the shepherd-turned-prophet. The famous fire in this passage, which burned in the bush without burning the bush, is nothing other than a small-scale manifestation of God. 16 This humble manifestation resembles the larger one that would take place at the same mountain not long thereafter, when the Israelites received law at Sinai. (The letter bet in the words, [Exodus 3.2], is the bet essentiae: These words should thus be translated, “Yhwh’s small-scale manifestation appeared to him as [or: in the form of] a flame of fire from the midst of the bush.] – Benjamin D. Sommer, The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel, p. 41-42</p>\n<p>Throughout the Exodus account, the angel (“malakh”) of YHWH is continually depicted as YHWH God and yet also as distinct from YHWH God.</p>\n<p>An especially revealing case occurs in the J text found in Exodus 33.1-3, which immediately follows the story of the Golden Calf. God, still incensed at the people, announces that He will not accompany the people on the journey, lest He destroy them on the way. Rather, His mal’akh will accompany them. But this mal’akh is not quite independent of God; God uses the first person to describe its activities, not the third (“I shall expel”). The accompanying angel in this passage is the same one JE mentioned in Exodus 23.20-3. There, the people were told they must obey the angel who travels with them because the angel incorporates a manifestation of God’s presence or a hypostasized manifestation of God known as God’s shem (“Name”): “I will now send an angel in front of you…Take care with him and obey him…for My Name is within him”, Exodus 23.20-21). As we shall see in the subsequent chapter, by stating that His name is in the angel Yhwh indicates that the angel carries something of Yhwh’s own essence or self; it is not an entirely separate entity. But it clearly is not fully identical with Yhwh either; after all, the point of the mal’akh in this case is that God will not travel with the people lest the full presence and anger of God destroy them. – Benjamin D. Sommer, The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel, p. 42</p>\n<p>In his works, Brown recites observations made by Jewish biblical scholar Nahum Sarna on the same subject Sommer discusses in the quote above.</p>\n<p>Nahum M. Sarna – Nahum Mattathias Sarna (March 27, 1923–June 23, 2005) (Hebrew: נחום סרנה) was a modern Biblical scholar who is best known for the study of Genesis and Exodus represented in his Understanding Genesis (1966) and in his contributions to the first two volumes of the JPS Torah Commentary (1989/91). He was also part of the translation team for the Kethuvim section of the Jewish Publication Society's translation of the Bible, known as Tanakh: The Holy Scriptures (The New JPS Translation according to the Traditional Hebrew Text)… He was a lecturer at Gratz College in Philadelphia from 1951 to 1957, a librarian and then associate professor of Bible at the Jewish Theological Seminary, respectively, from 1957 to 1963, and from 1963 to 1965. – wikipedia. org</p>\n<ol start=\"19\">\n<li>According to the Jewish biblical scholar Nahum Sarna, “From several texts it is clear that the demarcation between God and his angel is often blurred [citing examples from Gen. 16:7-9, 11; 22:11-12, 15-18; Exod. 3:2, 4; Judg. 6:11-23].

In this, the delegate or ambassador of a god simply spoke in the first person on that god's behalf. The use of agency is only touched on rarely in the broader historical narrative of Genesis–2 Kings, where we sometimes find the Messenger of YHWH speaking about YHWH in the first person. [For a substantial treatment of this concept as it relates to the Messenger of YHWH, see: René A. López, <em>Identifying the \"Angel of the Lord\" in the Book of Judges: A Model for Reconsidering the Referent in Other Old Testament Loci</em>] Two occasions where this agency concept are found most explicitly are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Behold, I send an angel before you to guard you on the way and to bring you to the place that I have prepared. Pay careful attention to him and obey his voice; do not rebel against him, for he will not pardon your transgression, for my name is in him. But if you carefully obey his voice and do all that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries.\" (Exodus 23.20-22, ESV translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>God's name (authority) is in the angel, and when the angel speaks, it is God's words.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, \"I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you...'\" (Judges 2.1, ESV translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The angel speaks, but his words are God's words.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Growing interest in angels</h2>\n<p>Today's critical scholarship generally agrees that the Genesis–2 Kings narrative was compiled and finalized sometime during or shortly after the Babylonian exile. (Second Kings concludes circa 560 BC.) After the exilic period, during the Second Temple era, we find Jewish literature become increasingly interested in heavenly politics and the role of angels.</p>\n<p>This is especially the case in the apocalyptic genre. Whereas the earlier prophets claimed to receive their revelations directly from God ('the word of YHWH came to me', 'thus says YHWH', etc.), the Second Temple literature sees a drastic increase in angelic mediators of these revelations (Zechariah, 1 Enoch, Daniel, to name a few).</p>\n<p>It's possible that sometime during this Second Temple period, the growing view that God delegated everything through his angels was read backward into those 'agency' seeds of thought found in the biblical narrative. In this way, readers <em>inferred</em> that God must have revealed the Law through an angelic mediator.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>The Book of Jubilees</h2>\n<p>One such Second Temple text was the Book of Jubilees, a retelling of the Genesis-Exodus narrative written sometime in the second century BC.</p>\n<p>It is in this book, perhaps, that we find the earliest references to the idea that God gave the Law to Moses through an angelic mediator:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And [God] said to the angel of the presence, \"Write for Moses . . .\" (<a href=\"http://www.pseudepigrapha.com/jubilees/1.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jubilees 1.27</a>)</p>\n<p>And the angel of the presence spoke to Moses according to the word of the Lord, saying, \"Write the complete history of the creation, how in six days the Lord God finished all his works and all that he created, and kept Sabbath on the seventh day and hallowed it for all ages . . .\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Book_of_Jubilees.2.1?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2.1</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Several more times throughout the book, this angel speaks in the first person:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have written in the book of the first law, in that which I have written for you . . .\" (6.22)</p>\n<p>\"For this reason I have written for you in the words of the Law . . .\" (30.12)</p>\n<p>\"All this account I have written for you . . .\" (30.21)</p>\n<p>\"And behold the commandment regarding the Sabbaths — I have written them down for you . . .\" (50.6)</p>\n<p>\". . . as it is written in the tablets, which [God] gave into my hands that I should write out for you the laws of the seasons . . .\" (50.13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

A Hindu coworker was having a funeral and people were writing \"Om Shanti\" as a response. Looking up that phrase, I see it both used as a greeting and as a prayer. The belief is apparently around the word \"Om\" itself having divine capabilities.</p>\n<p>Based on all of this, is it assur to use Hindu greetings?

He was a Lithuanian <em>maskil</em> (i.e. active in promoting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskalah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haskalah</a> attitudes/methods) and served as a proofreader on the Romm Talmud (Vilna) at which time he had the opportunity to contribute to its formation.</p>\n<p>His name is not mentioned in any of the volumes of the Romm Shas, except for the very last volume all the way at the end in a section titled אחרית דבר. This epilogue contains the thanks and gratitude that the Romm publishers had for all those that contributed and helped in the production of their printing of Shas. In a small paragraph, in a smaller font than the rest of the page the following appears:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L7Gik.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/L7Gik.png\" alt=\"NIL scan\" /></a></p>\n<p>[This greatly magnified scan is from the NIL, if one tries to view it on <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14311&st=&pgnum=625\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HebrewBooks</a> the print is so small as to make it illegible  in the scan (bottom left side of the page, second to last paragraph)]</p>\n<p>With great adulatory honorifics prefacing his name, one Rabbi Mordekhai ben Shelomo is identified for his contribution. Notably without his last name Plungian appended, somewhat cloaking his identity but leaving it to those in the know to clearly identify the author of המתרגם.</p>\n<p>He also anonymously authored other works such as the מילואים in which he defends his ancestor R. Mordekhai Yoffe's Levush against the criticisms of the Shakh. The Steipler Gaon reported (קריינא דאגרתא, אגרת רנג, דף רסד) that R. Shemaryahu Yosef Karelitz (father of the Hazon Ish) instructed that the מילואים ought be treated suspiciously as the author's maskilic tendencies are well known to those that recognize him:</p>\n<p>אולי ימצא איזו דבר שלא כהוגן בספר מלואים לא יקשה בעיני הקורא כי ידוע ומפורמם דרכו לכל יודעיו ומכיריו</p>\n<p>It would then seem that R. Plungian published his composition quasi-anonymously in order so that it wouldn't deter traditionalists who were aware of his maskilic reputation, and in modern prints of the Talmud it continues to be published by Orthodox printing houses without naming its author altogether, in order to avoid enhancing the reputation of a maskil.</p>\n\n\n",

He explained to a surprised non-Jew: <em>\"Honestly, you guys didn't say let's build a bathhouse to glorify Aphrodite, you said let's build a bathhouse, and put up an Aphrodite to decorate it.\"</em></p>\n<p>I can't speak for Eastern faiths or practices; but in the English-speaking world, let's assume we're talking about a typical Catholic hospital: \"Saint Joseph's\", \"Good Samaritan\", you get the idea. Yes there will be icons and/or crucifixes. On a good day I would bet that easily half of their patients, and staff, are not practicing Catholics.</p>\n<p>In pages 192--193 of <em>Mesoras Moshe</em> Volume II, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's secretary mentions taking him to Saint Vincent's Hospital for a checkup, and Rabbi Feinstein saying it was okay to call it \"Saint Vincent's.\" He also entered a hospital (same or different, not clear) with a big crucifix in the main lobby. He said it was better if reasonably possible to enter a different way, but ultimately it was allowed -- nobody in their right mind would think you're entering a church.</p>\n<p>It seems it was just a matter-of-fact that the hospital was the hospital.</p>\n<p>As for your supporting their practice ... sooner of later some of my money is going to wind up in the hands of someone who will do something I don't like. The Talmud makes the crucial differentiation between <em>enabling</em> and simply being involved. If I sell a pagan a half-pound of frankincense and am the only shop in town, I'm enabling him to go burn it to his deity. If I sell a hundred pounds of frankincense, wholesale, to a shop, I'm sufficiently removed from <em>their</em> customers. It's thus very hard to argue that me paying my hospital bill is THE thing that's enabling non-monotheistic worship.</p>\n<p>As for \"doing kindness\" being their way of worshiping ... going to be very hard to avoid that. I think we'd also fall back on the involvement-vs.-enabling argument above.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If Exodus 21:22-25 proves the unborn aren't persons, would verses 28-32 imply that slaves aren't persons?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've heard Exodus 21:22-25 used in support of abortion in some cases, at least to protect the life of the mother. The argument is that if the negligent death of the mother is punishable by death while death to the unborn is merely punishable by a fine (if the premature-birth interpretation is false, anyway), then the fetus must not be an actual person.</p>\n<p>Does this reasoning go too far in light of verses 29-32? In this section, if an ox's owner negligently causes someone's death due to not properly addressing the ox's violent tendencies, then the owner can be put to death—but the owner apparently can't be put to death if the ox kills a slave, which instead is punishable by a fine.</p>\n<p>Each passage involves causing someone to die out of negligence, and each case can involve the death penalty for the person who acted negligently—but not if the victim is a fetus/slave (again, unless the premature-birth interpretation is used in verses 22-25, anyway). Therefore, should we conclude that a slave is not a person? If not, then is the parallel reasoning used in verses 22-25 flawed in some way? What if the different penalties merely imply a lesser status on the part of the slave/unborn rather than necessarily disproving personhood?</p>\n<p><strong>Info:</strong> My question is similar to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/101382/exodus-2122-25-relevance-for-the-issue-of-abortion\">Exodus 21:22–25 Relevance for the issue of abortion</a>. However, my question focuses specifically on the reasoning used in the passage and what parallel reasoning would imply in verses 29-32.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Again, we use the interpretation of the Talmud. Negligence to guard a known-to-be-goring ox resulting in a death means \"the owner <em>deserves to be killed</em>\" for such horrible misconduct, but instead pays redemption money. (Elsewhere it makes it very, very clear not to allow someone who truly deserves the death penalty to pay his way out of it.) If the ox kills a slave, then the standard price of a slave is paid instead. So no, that's not a proof.</p>\n<p>If a master chops his slave's head off, Exodus is quite clear that \"there shall be revenge\" and the master can be executed. The 24-hour exemption is basically a form of a defense; \"I was allowed to hit him to make him work, and oops I hit him too hard.\" For that matter, if the courts deem someone deserving of lashes and they mistakenly whip him too hard and he dies -- or even in times when it was normal for an apprentice's master to whip his pupil -- in any case where he was allowed to hit the fellow, but mistakenly hit him too hard (or the fellow getting hit was weaker than we thought), we can't charge the attacker with all-out murder.</p>\n\n\n",

There are two main ways nowadays that it is misunderstood and I think one is presented here.</p>\n<p>Who is a chassid? <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura_on_Pirkei_Avot.5.10.5?vhe=ToratEmet&lang=bi&with=Pirkei%20Avot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Someone who goes beyond the letter of the law</a>. Ramchal, on the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesilat_Yesharim.18.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">trait of Chassidut</a>, starts with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The trait of piety truly requires a great explanation. For there are many practices and ways which circulate among many people as piety but\nwhich are nothing but the shells of piety, lacking in shape, form and\ncorrection.</p>\n<p>This stems from a lack of true in-depth study and thought on the part\nof these practitioners [of the shells of piety]. For they did not toil\nand strain themselves to attain a clear and correct knowledge of the\nway of G-d. But instead, they went and adopted whatever practices\nstruck them as being pious according to first thought, without delving\ndeeply into the matters and weighing them on the scales of wisdom.</p>\n<p>These people have given Piety a repulsive odor in the eyes of most\npeople, including the intelligent among them, leading them to think\nPiety consists of foolish things and is counter to intelligence and\nsound knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The first way it is misunderstood, not applicable here, is it means keeping \"chumras\". This is not the case. Each chumra has to be taken on its own analysis, but generally speaking a chumra is there in order to <em>keep the din better</em>, e.g. only eating foods with a high grade hechsher - someone is really concerned about keeping <em>the din</em> of kashrut! So it's still <em>within din</em>. Other examples of this principle might be doing things \"mehadrin\" like taking an etrog mehudar, which is an explicit commandment (Vayikra 23:40), or using olive oil for chanuka lights, which again is an explicit law to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot%2027a:28\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">beautify our mitzvot</a> (Shemot 15:2).</p>\n<p>The second way it is misunderstood is what is going on here. Some people think that doing things that are not asked, such as washing for fruit, is considered going \"beyond the letter of the law\". Going beyond the letter of the law in this case is considered foolish, if not outright forbidden in many cases. It's not a Jewish thing to innovate practices in this way. Every Jewish law, or fence, or decree, must be rigorously sourced by our sages using the methods of the Oral Law, with proof.</p>\n<p>So what is \"going beyond the letter of the law\"? If someone wants to learn how to be a chassid, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fjI5HSw0k\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">they should learn Avot</a> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.30a.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Kama 30a</a>). What's the connection?</p>\n<p>The law is written for all humans, and therefore it takes into account human shtus (for lack of a better word). An example might be if someone slights you in public, you can take them to beis din and they can impose a penalty on them. This is the law. However, is that really ideal? Is that what Hashem wants? No, Hashem wants us to rise above our natures and become Godly. So going \"beyond the letter of the law\" means forgiving the person who slighted you (Avot 2:10). Going beyond the letter of the law, in this case, means <em>embodying the purpose behind the law</em>, or said differently, <em>becoming</em>, rather than simply <em>behaving</em>. Becoming the type of person the Torah expects you to be, not simply following the laws.</p>\n<p>A deeper insight. What comes <em>lifnei</em> the shura of the din? What comes <em>before</em> the law? The Lawgiver Himself. A chassid is someone who keeps the law, <em>because it's Hashem's law</em>. Because Hashem wants Him to. The Ramchal states (ibid):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The root of piety is what our sages, of blessed memory, stated: \"Fortunate is the man whose toil is in the Torah and gives\ngratification to his Maker\" (Berachot 17a)...</p>\n<p>But he who truly loves the Creator, blessed be He, will not strive and\nintend to discharge himself with the known obligations binding on\nevery Jew. Rather, what will happen to him is the same as that of a\nson who loves his father. Even if his father reveals a slight\nindication of something he desires, already the son will strive\ngreatly, to the best of his ability, to fulfill this thing or service.\nEven though the father merely mentioned it once and only halfway, this\nwill be enough for such a son to understand the direction of his\nfather's intent and to do for him even what he did not say explicitly.\nFor he can deduce on his own that this thing will bring pleasure to\nhis father, and he will not wait until his father commands him more\nexplicitly or tells him another time.</p>\n<p>With our own eyes we can observe this matter occurring at all times\nand in all places between all friends and lovers, between man and\nwife, between father and son.</p>\n<p>The general principle: wherever the love between two is true and\nstrong, one will not say to the other: \"No more was requested of me.\nIt's enough for me to do what I was told explicitly\". Rather through\nwhat one requested, the other will infer the requester's intent and\nwill strive to do what he deems will be pleasing to the other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If one learns Avot with this in mind, one will realise none of it is aimed at people still working on \"keeping the law\" (see my answer to this question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/131781/31534\">here</a> for an in depth example of this). It's all advice to people who are already keeping the law, but want to raise their service up to the level of Chassid.</p>\n<p>I hope this answer helps.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think there might be more reservations about a Chumra which makes a public statement, such as publicly washing every time you eat fruit, and a more private Chumra.</p>\n\n\n",

(This site has accepted questions asking for the Judaic context to certain events in Christian Scripture, but that's different.) But yes, this subject has been debated within classical Jewish sources. Often with different verses; many that you quote are about generic toil. A broader point is that viewing the Torah as something to make money is a blatant disrespect to it.</p>\n<p>The short answer is that in theory, someone able-bodied should be working. An argument has been made that if we left study for the physically weak or part-timers, we wouldn't have enough of it, so some are studying full-time out of communal necessity. Others argued this was especially vital when rebuilding the Jewish community post-Holocaust.</p>\n<p>You will hear such attitudes among many in Israel's \"ultra-Orthodox\" camp today (in which, interestingly, many Hassidic communities are more open to working than their non-Hassidic ultra-Orthodox counterparts). Many will continue to argue that times are still desperate and a full-out effort is needed ... while others may see the numbers differently. I'll leave it there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I write this as someone in favor of working for a living, and who agrees with Shalom's answer, that this has been debated within Jewish sources.</p>\n<p>Your question initially cited Thessalonians, which is in the Christian Bible, and the other citations are from Biblical verses from the Hebrew Bible. However, Jews follow not just the Bible (Tanach) but various sources of Oral Law, such as Mishnah, Talmud, Midrash, and so on. And, it is not just that these are competing sources of law and thought, but the latter informs upon the former, how to interpret these sources. Even within the sources of Oral Law, there are instructions that one shouldn't rule (determine law in practice) based on just the Mishnah, or based on just the Talmud. This is because one needs to know how to read these sources, know later strata of analysis, know where some statement applies or does not apply.</p>\n<p>So, while for Christians, it may be a matter of collecting a series of Biblical verses which have a broad message, for Orthodox Jews, it may not suffice. They will want to know how these verses have been interpreted, and will also assume that Midrash, Talmud, writing of rabbis of later generations have all taken these (and other) Biblical sources as input and arrived at other conclusions, and will therefore look to the later sources. I'll play devil's advocate, to flesh this out.</p>\n<p>To take your first example, you cite Genesis 3:17. This is a explicitly a curse to mankind. One might argue that this is therefore not the ideal situation. Are we certain that a life of hard toil is the ideal? If someone has succeeded early in life, must he still devote his life to labor in the field, rather than e.g. exploring intellectual pursuits? Womankind was cursed with pain of labor in birth. Does that mean that a woman must refuse an epidural during labor?</p>\n<p>Your second example is from the book of Proverbs, Mishlei. This book is taken by Christians to be aphorisms of how to live a good life, but by many Jewish sources as Meshalim, allegories, where there is a literal meaning but an intended allegorical meaning of something else. Rashi, a prominent Biblical commentator, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.13.4?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The soul of the lazy man desires but has nothing</strong> His soul desires all good, but has nothing.\n<strong>but the soul of the diligent shall be sated</strong> The upright who eat from the toil of their hands. This is its meaning according to its simple interpretation. According to its allegorical meaning, in the future he will see the glory of the Torah scholar and long for it, but he will not achieve it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Such that its intended focus is on labors in Torah study. Does the literal meaning, necessary in order to understand the allegory, also have standing as instructions for life? That could be debated.</p>\n<p>I won't go through the remainder of the Biblical sources because the above should suffice to illustrate the idea. I'll just repeat, these sources might indeed imply this, and other sources might also endorse the idea. But mere Biblical verses, cited out of context and without other analysis, is not compelling to those operating in the Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>For one example of many, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.35b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachot 35b</a>, where competing ideas of work vs. Torah study are brought, all based on analysis of Biblical verses.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A simple answer may be that someone who is involved with the holy Torah is neither <em>lazy</em> nor isn't <em>toiling</em> (albeit in Torah). I think that everyone agrees that people should not sit at home and just take benefits. The argument and difference in Hashkafah is only whether one should work for a living or rely on Hashem and go into learning (if I am not mistaken)</p>\n\n\n",

This is based on Deut. 6:17-18:  (1) Keep the commandments, (2) and do what is right and good in the sight of the Lord.  The apparent repetition was understood to mean extra-legal measures.  The Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer ben Ya’akov says: I heard that the court may administer lashes and capital punishment, even when not prescribed by the Torah. It may do so, not with the intention of violating the Torah, but to safeguard it by erecting a fence around it, [so that people will fear sinning]. [Sanhedrin 46a; Yevamot 90b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He gave two examples.  In the first, a man was flogged for having intercourse with his wife in public, which is not forbidden by the Torah.  In the second, a man was stoned to death for riding a horse on Shabbat, which is only prohibited by the rabbis, not by the Torah, and so cannot carry the death penalty.  The justification given was: “Because the hour required it.” In those days, Greek influence was so strong that it pushed Jewish observance to an all-time low, and extra-harshness was deemed necessary to make sure it did not sink even lower.   This practice was later accepted in the Code of Jewish Law [Shulḥan Arukh, Choshen Mishpat 2:1].</p>\n\n\n",

I've tried looking for it online but I haven't found it yet.</p>\n<p>I read that he does not follow the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.23b.18?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara's</a> numbers of 248 positive and 365 negative commandments. Is this true, and does he have a different source for his number?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The introduction to the Halachot Gedolot with the list of mitzvot can be found <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14119&st=&pgnum=6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. It's worth noting that it is not clear whether this list was authored by the author of the Halachot Gedolot (the Behag).</p>\n<p>He doesn't separate the mitzvot into positive and negative, but instead into (1) punishments (ie. mitzvot that get death/karet for not observing them), (2) negative mitzvot that get lashes, (3) positive mitzvot that don't get lashes, (4) parashiyot (ie. communal ordinances, that no one person is punishable for not observing them).</p>\n<p>In terms of the number, the editor of the Hildesheimer edition of Halachot Gedolot wrote that it was not always clear how the author was counting mitzvot, and hence that the numbering given there is not unquestionable (\"לעתים קשה לקבוע הפרש מדוייק בין המצוות... אין לראות את חלוקת המצוות המובאת להלן על ידינו כהחלטית\"). Notably, this means the original author of the list didn't indicate separations between the mitzvot. The Hildesheimer edition counts 73, 282, 199, and 65 mitzvot in the respective four categories. That comes to 619.</p>\n<p>In terms of the author's sources, it seems that the Talmudic aggada was not seen to be the only choice when it came to enumerating the mitzvot. If you look at early azharot (liturgical poems for Shavuot that list mitzvot), many follow the four-fold classification mentioned above, and don't aim to come to 613 (unless you awkwardly force it). See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/106297/4940\">here</a> for a more detailed question as to the source.</p>\n<p>(Much of this information is sourced from the Hildesheimer edition of Halachot Gedolot and Daniel Goldschmidt/Yonah Frankel's Shavuot machzor.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I followed the link, provided by @magicker72, and I see the Bahag clearly does say he is following the list of R' Simlai, and even <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14119&st=&pgnum=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">reiterates</a> that his list adds up to 248 positive commandments:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0sikV.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/0sikV.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Yehuda said it's an actual snake. They came before Rabbi Shimon and he answered them: It's precisely all one.

Precisely in chokhmah, cleverness, did the S-M bring curses into the world, and destroy the first tree that the Holy Blessed One created in the world, and this thing was held by the S-M until the other Holy Tree came along, which is Yaakob, and took from him the blessings, for the S-M above and Esau below, did not retain blessing, for Yaakob was the model of Adam haRishon, (and the beauty) of Yaakob was the beauty of Adam haRishon, and therefore just as the S-M withheld blessings from the first tree, so too did Yaakob who is the tree, the model of Adam, withhold from the S-M blessings above and below, and Yaakob himself acquired everything, and therefore (Gen. 32:25), \"And y'abek (\"struggled\" - got cast down to dust) ish (the S-M, lost the blessings he robbed) by him (Yaakob).\" It's written \"and the serpent was Arum, clever, naked\" – this is the Yetzer haRa, this is the angel of death, and since the serpent which is the angel of death, caused death for all the world, so this is the hint of the scripture (ibid. 6:13), \"Ketz kol-basar ba lefanai/ the end (awakening) of all flesh, comes before me\" – this is the end of all flesh, as the Neshama is taken from all flesh, so that's how it's read.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Zohar I:35b <br>\nRelevant Hashmatot (#34 in some editions)<br>\nהשלמה מההשמטות (סימן ל''ד) <br>\n<strong>The Neshama of a male stems from the male, and the Neshamah of a female stems from the female.

His [R' Shimon's] students asked him, \"How did this deed happen?\"\nHe answered: The wicked S-M make a bond with all the supernal legions to [rebel] against his Master, because the Holy Blessed One said, Have dominion over the fish of the sea [corresponding to the Serpent?] and bird of heaven [corr. to the S-M?]. He said, How can I cause him to err and drive him from before His presence? He came down with all his troops and sought out on earth a partner like him, and appointed the Serpent/snake, and it had the image/form of a camel [was arched].

Before that the practicants had close to zero understanding of what was going on when the mass was in Latin , thus the changes during that time.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You'd have to define your terms slightly more precisely, but let's give this a go: the Talmud talks about including \"ignoramuses\" who didn't speak, or read, Hebrew. (In fact the Talmud says sometimes the Romans installed a high priest who spoke the vernacular (Aramaic) but couldn't understand Hebrew! The experts could still coach the fellow through the rituals, and he'd be okay as long as he listened.)</p>\n<p>Now someone has to be read the prayers and scripture in Hebrew in synagogue, but others can just listen along. I would add that the goal has always been to get more people to learn Hebrew; not to keep people locked out of knowledge.</p>\n<p>While there's been an explosion of translated material out there, serious expertise of the faith will require stronger Hebrew reading ability. The ordination exams at Yeshiva University, for instance, will put the questions in Hebrew and allow the student to write their answers in either Hebrew or English. (Many American rabbis aren't the greatest at generating spoken Hebrew conversationally, but they do just fine.) There was discussion in the early 1900s about translating the entire canon into English to train American rabbis who could pronounce Hebrew but not really understand it; fortunately, enough became sufficiently Hebrew-literate that this wasn't necessary.</p>\n<p>Most broadly, the obligation of Torah study is basically \"to the best of your ability.\" Someone trying to do it at an advanced level is going to need to be able to read Hebrew to get more out of the material -- but that's a broad term.</p>\n<p>In an Orthodox Jewish synagogue that assumes many attending don't have a strong background, they'll use a Hebrew-English prayerbook. Many will frequently announce page numbers, or have a device showing you the page number. There are even transliterated prayer books, for those who want to pronounce everything in Hebrew even if they can't read it.</p>\n<p>Private prayer can, in theory, be done in English. There are only one or two rare rituals that would require an individual to use the original Hebrew -- it means the rabbi would coach them through three lines, phonetically. (The biggest problem that occurs with said coaching, actually, is that those lines include a couple of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_alphabet#Ancient_Hebrew_pronunciation\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">fricative consonants</a> that adult monolingual English speakers have trouble pronouncing -- a story for another time!)</p>\n<p>At the weekly worship, the cantor is up there reading Scripture out of a handwritten Hebrew scroll. If someone can phonetically read two lines of Hebrew, they can be called up to recite the blessing before the cantor reads -- in fact, in a place with lots of neophytes, there will be a card up there with the blessing transliterated into English as well. (On this last point, there was an interesting debate whether you could only participate in the reading ritual if you could make out Hebrew letters. The conclusion, at least among Jews of Central and Eastern European ancestry, is that even that wasn't required.) The cantor reading it, by the way, doesn't necessarily have to know what every word means.</p>\n<p>If someone shows up off the street and says \"rabbi I'm Jewish by birth but never got much Hebrew\", the rabbi will encourage them to show up, say their private prayers either in English or transliterated Hebrew, and maybe step up for fifteen seconds of ritual every so often -- even being given a transliterated card.</p>\n<p>Someone who shows up and asks to convert is given a slightly higher bar -- the rabbi should not sign off on this person until confident they are serious about it, and have a high probability of sticking with it. Practically, most will be expected to learn to pronounce Hebrew -- even if slowly-- and learn a handful of common words. (If someone's sincerely trying but just completely hopeless at foreign languages, that's a reasonable call for the rabbi to make.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>No it is not compulsory for practicing Judaism. Hebrew as a conversational language is something that did not exist for a long period of time. \"Biblical Hebrew\" while it was conversational at one point in time became the language of study and prayer and for most of Jewish history Jews spoke other languages. The modern Hebrew today spoken by Israelis therefore would obviously not be a necessary component of practicing Judaism as this is a recent development and speaking \"Biblical Hebrew\" conversationally would not have been practical after it fell out of practice as many aspects of language would be missing.</p>\n\n\n",

The later often have stiffer shoulder padding and the structure of a suit jacket, but in silk, and of course longer.

Does that make me a kohen or not?\nThank you very much.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You are correct that someone with a non-Jewish father is identified as \"son of\" the Jewish maternal grandfather; (some, alternatively, actually use the mother's name); however tribal identity is patrilineal. It doesn't matter how you choose to name yourself; if your father's not a kohen, neither are you.</p>\n<p>That does leave to an interesting situation. If your mother's father is \"Aaron, the Kohen\"; you should not be calling yourself \"James the son of Aaron-the-Kohen\", because people will misconstrue that as \"James, the son of Aaron, the Kohen.\" So it would just be \"James the son of Aaron.\"</p>\n<p>(The same comes up in a much simpler case: say that Aaron the kohen had a child, Chaim, with a divorcee, Brenda; Aaron then realizes that a kohen should not be married to a divorcee so he divorces her and is now behaving as a proper kohen. Aaron is a kohen, but his son Chaim was born to a kohen-prohibited union -- Chaim is not a kohen. Chaim, son of Aaron-the-kohen, is not a kohen. So he's just \"Chaim the son of Aaron.\")</p>\n\n\n",

Yonah quotes Mishle, this serves merely as a sort of asmakhta. It is not the source of the law (the scope of which is defined above), rather it is scriptural allusion that resonates with the same/similar concept. Accordingly, this ought not be interpreted as an occasion where a passage in Nakh is being used to supercede a Torah prohibition.</p>\n<p>In the comments you write regarding R. Yonah's position that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems as though... he's referring to a case of a one time sin...\nthat would be pretty extreme to categorize him as יצא מכלל עמיתך - for\nthe one sin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Yonah states (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Teshuvah.3.219?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gate 3, sec. 219</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם החוטא איש אשר איננו ירא מלפני האלהים. כמו הפורק מעליו עול מלכות\nשמים. ואינו נזהר מעבירה אחת אשר כל שער עמו יודע כי היא עבירה. מותר\nלהכלימו ולספר בגנותו. כך אמרו רבותינו (ויקרא כ״ה:י״ז) אל תונו איש את\nעמיתו. עם שאתך בתורה ובמצות אל תונהו בדברים. ואשר לא שת לבו אל דבר ה'\nמותר להכלימו במעלליו ולהודיע תועבותיו ולשפוך בוז עליו. ועוד אמרו\nמפרסמין את החנפים מפני חלול השם. אבל אם נכשל בחטא על דרך מקרה. ורוב\nהימים דרכו להשתמר מעונו. אין לגלות על חטאו</p>\n<p>And if the sinner is one who does not fear God, such as one who casts\noff from himself the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, and is not heedful\nof a certain transgression which is known to be a transgression by all\nthe others of his fellow men, it is permitted to humiliate him and to\nspeak degradingly of him. As our Sages have said in relation to the\nverse, \"and ye shall not wrong one another\" - \"If one is with you in\nTorah and miswoth, you shall not wrong him with words.\" If one however\ndoes not apply his heart to the word of God, it is permitted to\nhumiliate him through his deeds, to make known his abominations, and\nto pour shame upon him. And they have said further. \"Hypocrites should\nbe exposed to prevent desecration of the Name\". But if one falls into\nsin by chance, and most of his days is wont to guard himself against\ntransgression, his sin should not be revealed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Making it clear, that in his estimation it is inapplicable to a single fleeting sin, but rather to a specific type of character with an entire disposition of the personality. In order to be open to such criticism, this individual must flagrantly violate a law which is undeniably known by all of his coreligionists, do so as a pattern of behavior, and in a way that demonstrates that he is פורק מעליו עול מלכות שמים (casts off from upon himself the yoke of heaven).</p>\n<p>This type of individual (הפורק עול) is described in greater detail by R. Yonah earlier (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Teshuvah.3.143?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gate 3, sec. 143</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וענין הפורק עול כגון הכופר לאכול נבילות או לאכול חלב ודם או לחלל\nיו\"ט. ואף על פי שאינו עובר על שאר המצות. אחרי אשר הסיר מעליו עול אזהרה\nאחת, כבר מרד בשם יתעלה. אמנם כי גם פעמים הצדיקים נכשלים בחטא אחד אבל\nאין זה בלתי על דרך מקרה. בהתגבר עליו היצר. ונפשו מרה לו על הדבר. ונזהר\nממנו אחרי כן. אבל האומר בלבבו לפרוק מעליו עול אזהרה אחת כל עת אשר\nיתאוה לעבור הוא הנקרא כופר לדבר א'.</p>\n<p>\"Removal of the yoke\" refers to a denial by which one permits to\nhimself such things as eating a carcass, suet, or blood, and\ndesecrating the festivals. Although he does not transgress the other\nmiswoth, still, by having removed from himself the yoke of one of\nexhortation, he has rebelled against the blessed Name. It cannot be\ndenied that the righteous, also, sometimes go astray in respect to a\nparticular sin, but when they do, it is the result of circumstances,\nof their having been overpowered by the evil inclination, and they are\nbitter over what they have done, and keep from doing so again. But one\nwho entertains in his heart the thought of removing from himself the\nyoke of one exhortation whenever he desires to transgress, is called\n\"an unbeliever in respect to one thing.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Talmudic source for it is the statement of R. Yohanan (and R. Yohanan as cited by R. Hiyya b.

R. Hiyya b. Abba said in the name of R.\nYohanan: If one consults nature and washes his hands and puts on\ntefillin and recites the Shema' and says the tefillah, Scripture\naccounts it to him as if he had built an altar and offered a sacrifice\nupon it, as it is written, I will wash my hands in innocence and I\nwill compass Thine altar, O Lord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He specifies that this practice, as performed alongside other miswoth has the effect of cultivating acceptance upon ones self of the yoke of heaven in the most complete manner.</p>\n<p>Insofar as our source for the practice is R. Yohanan, the practice is rabbinic. This is confirmed in many other sources. For example, the Rambam explicitly states (H. Berakhoth 6:2):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל הנוטל ידיו--בין לאכילה, בין לקרית שמע, בין לתפילה--מברך בתחילה, אשר\nקידשנו במצוותיו וציוונו על נטילת ידיים:  ש<strong>זו מצות חכמים</strong> היא\nשנצטווינו בתורה לשמוע מהן, שנאמר \"על פי התורה אשר יורוך\" (דברים\nיז,יא).</p>\n<p>Whenever a person washes his hands - whether before eating, before the\nrecitation of the Shema', or before prayer - he should recite the\nfollowing blessing beforehand: \"[Blessed are You...] who sanctified us\nwith His commandments and commanded us concerning the washing of\nhands.\" <strong>This is a Rabbinic miswah</strong> that we have been commanded by\nthe Torah to follow, as [Deuteronomy 17:11] states: \"[Do not stray...]\nfrom all the laws that they direct you.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Mishneh Torah, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/927679/jewish/Berachot-Chapter-Eleven.htm#v3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos, chapter 11; halacha 3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Similarly, with regard to all the Rabbinic mitzvot - both the mitzvot\nthat the Rabbis established as obligations - e.g., reading the\nmegillah, lighting Shabbat candles, and lighting Chanukah candles -\nand the mitzvot that are not obligations - e.g., an eruv or washing\nhands - one should recite a blessing before performing them, [praising\nGod] \"who has sanctified us with Your commandments and commanded\nus….”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's clear from this paragraph that washing one's hands is rabbinical in nature.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ramban (Nachmanides) writes in his commentary on the pasuk <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"You shall be holy\"</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is with reference to these and similar matters that this general commandment [Ye shall be holy] is concerned, after He had enumerated all individual deeds which are strictly forbidden, so that cleanliness of hands and body, are also included in this precept, just like the Rabbis have said: “And ye shall sanctify yourselves.10 This refers to the washing of hands before meals. And be ye holy. <strong>This refers to the washing of hands after meals [before the reciting of grace].</strong> For I am holy — this alludes to the spiced oil” [with which they used to rub their hands after a meal]. <strong>For although these [washings and perfuming of the hands] are commandments of Rabbinic origin, yet Scripture’s main intention is to warn us of such matters, that we should be [physically] clean and [ritually] pure, and separated from the common people who soil themselves with luxuries and unseemly things.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, see the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.105a.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 105a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>§ Having mentioned the manner of washing hands during a meal, the Gemara discusses another matter concerning washing hands. Rav Idi bar Avin says that Rav Yitzḥak bar Ashyan says: The first waters, i.e., <strong>washing of the hands before eating bread, are a mitzva by rabbinic law</strong>, but the final waters, washing of the hands upon conclusion of the meal and before reciting Grace after Meals, are an obligation, a more stringent requirement.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Enforcing car free Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Personally, I really enjoy in Israel that religious neighbourhoods block car traffic on the Shabbat. (I mean by legal means and road signs as well.) It is much of a relief after the chaos and the traffic jams of the weekdays. Yet, there are always a few guys, who think it is a good idea to drive a car in such zones during the Shabbat, while it is quite evident that they wouldn't be allowed to do that from a religious perspective. Therefore, I was wondering, what could be a halakhically acceptable way to enforce the regulation? Since the ban is only for the Shabbat, one may not hire guards only for the Shabbat (see <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%93_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Orach Chayim 244:1</a>). I'm not sure either how could an automated system work based on the optical recognition of number plates. What could be a feasible solution?</p>\n\n\n",

Chazon Ish 37:11 argues that actually placing the metal sheet on the fire is the forbidden act of Mavir based on Rambam (Shabbat 12:1, 9:6) who says that one who heats metal to mold it violates Mavir. Even though S”A 253:3 writes that on Shabbat day one can put a empty pot on a fire (and then return a pot that was on the fire right before), Chazon Ish explains that S”A is talking about a earthenware pot and not metal. However Nishmat Adam 20:1, Kesot HaShulchan (134 pg 42), Sh”t Shevet Halevi 1:91, Sh”t She’ilat Shaul 29, Chazon Ovadyah (Shabbat 1 pg 55), and Sh”t Tefilah LeMoshe 1:59 (pg 647) argue that in our case the tray won’t become hot as a coal or hot enough to be reshaped and so it should be permitted. Shemirat Shabbat KeHilchata 1:23 and 1:38 permits covering the fire on Shabbat as long as the fire isn’t strong enough to make the tray red-hot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See also this <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/weekly-halacha-5770-kiseitzei/?printversion=1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">article</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What can Torah teach us about if voting makes u responsible for the actions of the elected, or system?What does voting affect in the spiritual worlds?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If a nation has a national election with only so to speak \"bad\" candidates, what teachings from Tanakh, Talmud, Jewish law or Jewish ethics in general, and the mystical teachings of the Torah, can teach us about whether or not voting for the \"lesser of evils\" should be considered giving consent to that candidate's actions once they are elected, or to the system that produced him or her, even in cases where the voters did/do not specifically have any say in that system's creation, continuance, or significant change except for by voting?</p>\n<p>I've come up with a better way than before, I think, to ask the question that gets beneath the surface of \"should I vote or not?\" and to the deeper, much more interesting layers: Say there is some fictional nation. John and Rob decide to run for its presidency. John campaigns that if elected, he will send 100,000 troops to fictional nation B. Rob campaigns he will send 50,000 troops there. The rest of the citizens want no war at all, but those are their only choices, so some vote for Rob so at least less troops will be sent.</p>\n<p>When Rob wins and sends 50,000 troops, can he argue \"they voted me in, therefore they consented to what I did\" even though they had no legitimate choice really because the only other option was even worse, or can he not? Would that argument be correct, or incorrect?</p>\n<p>The question is not \"was it moral or immoral for Rob to send 50,000 troops to that nation,\" the question is, regardless of whether the action was moral or not, can he say they <em>consented</em> to it because they voted for him after he said he would do just that if elected? Or does the fact they never had a \"fair\" or \"real\" choice, or whatever word you would use, mean that they have not in any way consented to anything Rob does as president even though they voted for him, <em>not even the things he told them he would do before they voted for him</em>, due to the fact that they were stuck without a better choice than him? (Please assume for this question that the voters being asked about have no legitimate ability to run for president themselves due to the costs and influence required to become a legitimate candidate).</p>\n<p>In other words, is only Rob responsible, or only Rob and John, or only Rob and John and whatever backers they had that helped ensure they would be the only two options on the ballot, for the actions Rob takes as president, or are the citizens who voted for him, or who voted <em>period</em>, also responsible? And does voting make the voters responsible for supporting the system itself they are voting within, even if they have no way to mass organize a nationwide \"no vote\" action and their individual abstainment from voting for the \"lesser of evils\" will not only fail to change the system, but also possibly be used as justification against them for why they got with the worse candidate? For example, we can all remember people who didn't vote being told \"This is what you get for staying home and not voting!\" after many elections ended with widely unpopular results.</p>\n<p><strong>Main question ends here, next two paragraphs are a modifier, and an idea for how to answer if people are stumped.</strong></p>\n<p>That's the question. This paragraph is just a modifier to it, which is, would the answers change, in the real world, depending on if it were Jewish or non-Jewish voters being asked about, or if it were an Israeli national election or a non-Jewish state's national election?</p>\n<p>Lastly, if the question is stumping people, one idea where an answer might reveal itself is to examine, \"what is the deeper spiritual meaning of <em>voting</em>?\" Voting is something where you are putting your stamp of support to something. What effect might voting have in the higher worlds? You are literally putting your name down in support of another person, or a cause or organization, and it goes without saying how important names are in Torah and especially the mystical teachings of Torah.  And yet, many times you have no good choices for who to support, thus this question. So if we can explore the deeper meanings of the Hebrew word for \"vote,\" and what words are associated with it, especially ones singled out by authoritative sources, that might help us answer this, although there are multiple good ways to answer most questions so please don't feel constrained by this suggestion if you have other ways.</p>\n\n\n",

This time is different. <em>These</em> brothers are finally able to understand. Each of them is special and precious, each has his unique role. No one has any reason to be jealous.<br />\nThis incident needed to happen to show that the family could put this issue behind them. This is the completion of Sefer Bereishis, where jealousy between brothers was a central theme.<br />\nThe next time we'll see this issue, in Sefer Shemos, Hashem will tell Moshe, Don't worry, Moshe! <em>Your brother Aharon will see your elevation and be joyous in his heart.</em> That joy is exactly what will qualify Aharon to be the Cohen Gadol, who carries the names of all the tribes on his heart.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I'll answer your question in the typical rabbinic style of asking another question: why did Hashem write in the Torah many times that the Jews are His chosen people?

    "content": "# How did Moshe carry the Luchot down Mount Sinai?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm trying to understand how Moshe positioned his hands in carrying the Luchot down Mount Sinai (both the first set before he broke them and the second set). Were they under them or grasping the sides? I know that contrary to popular depictions, the luchot were not rounded tablets but each were  6 long x 6 wide x 3 thick tefachim blocks (Although I saw an article mention of sources from the Yerushalmi <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4028081/jewish/What-Shape-Were-the-Luchot-Round-Square-or-Rectangular.htm#footnote2a4028081\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that the width may have actually been 3 tefachim).</p>\n<p>But in either case, does this mean that they were higher vertically or were they flat blocks with a length at least as much as the width? Also, if they were flat, did he carry them stacked or not? I couldn't tell from the Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.14a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 14a</a> because it uses the word \"length\" (Archan) and not \"height\" (Gavo'ah) so I thought it could be read either way.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Moshe descended walking backwards down Har Sinai, facing the cloud of Hashem. The Luchot, which weighed 40 seah, were suspended in the air slightly above each of Moshe's hands. And the two (6x6x3) Luchot were separated from each other by two hand-breadths.</p>\n<p>Moshe only grabbed hold of the Luchot to smash them, after their holiness left due to the sin of the golden calf.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Chananel_on_Exodus.32.15.1?ven=Eliyahu_Munk,_HaChut_Hameshulash&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Chananel, on Shemot 32:15</a></p>\n<p>ויפן וירד משה מן ההר. We learn from this word ויפן, he turned around,\nthat <strong>Moses descended while facing the cloud</strong> just as he had done when\nascending the mountain. In other words, just as he had ascended facing\nthe cloud, he now descended keeping his face toward the cloud, walking\nbackwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Deuteronomy.9.17.1?ven=Or_Hachayim,_trans._Eliyahu_Munk&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">The Or HaChaim, on Devarim 9:17</a></p>\n<p>ואתפש בשני הלחות ואשלכם, \"and I took hold of the two Tablets and I\nflung them, etc.\" Why did Moses have to mention that \"he took hold\" of\nsomething which was already in his hands? Perhaps as long as the\nIsraelites had not yet been guilty of sin <strong>the Tablets were suspended\nin the air slightly above Moses' hands so that he could not actually\ntouch them.</strong> This may be what is meant when we were told in verse 16:\n\"and the two Tablets of the covenant \"were above my two hands.\" Moses\nhad not said that the two Tablets were \"in his hands.\" They seemed to\ncarry themselves. Once Moses espied the golden calf, the Tablets lost\ntheir holiness so that Moses had to \"take hold of them\" with his\nhands.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.4.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Talmud Yerushalmi, Taanit 4:5:2</a></p>\n<p>Rebbi Samuel bar Naḥman in the name of Rebbi Jonathan: T<strong>he tablets\nwere six hand-breadths long and three wide.

That is what the\nverse praises him at the end and says, and all the strong hand, peace\nshall be on the hand which had the better on mine. Rebbi Joḥanan in\nthe name of Rebbi Yose ben Abbai: the tablets wanted to fly off but\nMoses held them, [as is written,] <em>I grabbed the two tablets</em>.

Rebbi Ezra in the name of Rebbi Jehudah ben Rebbi Simon: <strong>The tablets were a load of forty seah but the writing was carrying them.</strong> When the writing flew off they were too heavy for Moses’s hands, they fell, and broke.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What rights does a husband have over his wife?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I just wish to know the opinions of the Sages or what the Halacha is.</p>\n<p>What are the rights a man has over his wife?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><strong>LOVE YOUR FELLOW LIKE YOURSELF</strong> starts at home. Each spouse has to apply that to the other. Each spouse is obligated to care for the other. Judaism speaks in terms of obligations, not rights.</p>\n<p>Maimonides writes that \"she should treat him like a king\" ... but that he should \"honor her more than himself\" ... so I guess that's kind of a wash?</p>\n<p>Of course, the marriage itself is him saying \"you are dedicated to me\", so she can't be intimate with any other man. Kind of a no-brainer. And yes, until 1000 years ago he was allowed to take a second wife, but with all kinds of conditions that couldn't impinge on the first wife ... that's a discussion for another question.</p>\n<p>The Torah does grant the husband the right to cancel his wife's vows, within a day of learning about them, if they would afflict her or affect him. That's really the only other inviolable right I can think of.</p>\n<p>Marital rape is not allowed. If a woman says she has a powerful revulsion reaction to all intimacy with her husband ... obviously try therapy ... but if all else fails, divorce is better than asking her to continue with him (or asking him to be celibate). But she can demand a divorce if he refuses to be intimate with her, too. Obviously, whichever spouse had an intimacy problem will be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis the financial settlement, but that's not about anyone's \"rights\" over the other.</p>\n<p>It should go without saying that abuse, God forbid, is prohibited.</p>\n<p>The default arrangement would be that she should take on his community's customs, but again, that's not his rights over her. Rabbi Feinstein had caveats to that rule of thumb, and even then, only applied that situation <em>ceteris paribus</em>, e.g. he's Yemenite and has a massive Yemenite congregation half a mile north of here, she's Lubavitch and has a thriving Lubavitch community half a mile south. If there's one dominant set of practices in the family/community, they use that, whichever side it is.</p>\n<p>He's not allowed to feed her non-kosher, or vice versa. If either one has a drastic change in religious observance, or starts messing up the other one's observance, that's grounds for divorce -- but not because of his \"rights\" over her. (It is true that women have an obligation to use the mikvah and men don't. Thus, there are couples who started off equally observant and then one has a crisis of faith. If he goes off and eats pork outside the house, she can choose to stay with him, and in fact some do. If she eats pork outside the house, again they can stick together if they feel that's best. But if she stops using the mikvah, now you're asking him to either violate halacha or be celibate, at which point a divorce is probably the least-bad option.)</p>\n<p>Financially, there are the default arrangements set up in the Talmud, which also say clearly that she has the right to change. In the Talmud's default arrangement, the husband was the primary money person; he was obligated to support her, so if she had a hobby that made a few bucks, he was entitled to those earnings. (Same if she found $20 on the street.) Any property she brought into the marriage: she could either say \"here's a field, you can use it normally, and I get it back as-is at the end of the marriage\"; or she can say \"this field is worth $1,000; I get back $1,000 from the estate no matter what happens to it.\") The Talmud also lays out the default expectations of her contribution to the family -- baking, spinning, nursing his baby (even if it's not hers, e.g. a blended family). But again, those are the defaults, and subject to change.</p>\n<p>However if she out-earns him, or just wants financial independence, the Talmud says explicitly she can opt to put something in writing that says -- <em>I don't want your financial support, and I'd rather have my own earnings</em> -- and that's fine too. (The default dependence relationship was instituted assuming that would be helpful for most women; if she feels it isn't, that's her call to make.)</p>\n\n\n",

The chance of returning from the exile depends on the death of [the high-priest], the most honoured of men, and the friend of all Israel. By his death the relative of the slain person becomes reconciled (ibid. ver. 25); for it is a natural phenomenon that we find consolation in our misfortune when the same misfortune or a greater one has befallen another person.

This leads to two corollaries:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Kabbalah does not contradict Judaism in any fundamental ways.</li>\n<li>Only one who has mastered the \"revealed\" part of Judaism is qualified to study it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Because Kabbalah deals with matters that are by definition intangible, it must borrow terms such as \"world\", \"light\", \"flow\", etc. to simulate concepts  that are beyond our perception. In truth it is highly abstract, and many people struggle with the books written by non-Kabbalists to explain these matters a little bit. This has also meant that people without the correct background misunderstand Kabbalah and thus see it as heretical (I saw the answer on the Christianity SE that is a classic of that \"genre.\")</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the vacuum of understanding has created attempts by many to \"explain\" Kabbalah without the proper background. Some people are well meaning, but some are outright charlatans trying to get rich off people's naivete.</p>\n<p>The false Messiah <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbatai_Zevi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabsai Tzvi</a> misused Kabbalistic concepts to justify his fake claims and flagrantly transgress the Torah. That created a strong backlash to teaching Kabbalah to the masses that persists to this day.</p>\n<p>Anyone who opens a \"Kabbalah Center\" or claims to teach Kabbalah to the masses is outside mainstream Judaism and not to be trusted. Especially anyone who attempts to use Kabbalah to raise money.</p>\n<p>Anyone who treats Kabbalah as a separate religion from Judaism is not legitimate. Anyone who says that Kabbalah denies the existence of Satan or sin is flat-out wrong as wrong can be. (Although the Jewish -and therefore Kabbalistic- view of Satan is very different from the Christian/pagan dualist view.)</p>\n<p>One last detail: Originally, Kabbalah was transmitted by word of mouth, as was the rest of the <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/explore_judaism/ask_the_rabbi/ask_the_rabbi/8087\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Oral Torah</a>. Some parts of the Written Torah also contain Kabbalistic concepts, such as the visions opening the book of Ezekiel. As the Oral Torah began to be written down, so was the Kabbalah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are Kohanim of a mishmar REQUIRED to work, or can they opt not to?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Background: Mishna Yevamos 100. The mishna discusses a Kohen of uncertain lineage citing an example of someone who may be the son of two different men, both of whom are Kohanim. We KNOW for certain then that this individual is a Kohen, but we don't know which mishmar they are part of.\nIn this case the person of uncertain parentage will work for two mishmaros but they do not get any of the kodshim because the members of each mishmar will say they are not really entitled because hamotzy mechaveiro alav ha'raya.</p>\n<p>Question:  Essentially this takes a month out of a person's year for the avodah, but there is no financial support for this time worked. Well and good if the kohen is wealthy. But if they are not, and they have a chiyuv to work this could be difficult. Or perhaps, the avodah is not a chiyuv on the individual but a reshus for them. In which case, the Kohen in question could work if he is able to, but if he is not able to support himself he is not required to.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Gemara on this Mishna, in Yevamos 101A clearly states that the wording of the Mishnah is meant to imply that he can be forced to serve both weeks in the Bais Hamikdash.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְעוֹלֶה בְּמִשְׁמָרוֹ וְכוּ׳. וְכִי מֵאַחַר דְּאֵינוֹ חוֹלֵק, לָמָּה עוֹלֶה? לָמָּה עוֹלֶה?! הָאָמַר: בָּעֵינָא דְּנֶיעְבֵּיד מִצְוָה! אֶלָּא: ״עָלָה״ לָא קָתָנֵי, אֶלָּא ״עוֹלֶה״ — בְּעַל כׇּרְחוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is stated in the mishna: And he ascends to the Temple service with the priestly watch of both uncertain fathers. However, he does not receive a share of the offerings of either watch. The Gemara asks: Since he does not receive a share, why does he ascend? The Gemara is puzzled by this question: Why does he ascend? Doesn’t he naturally say: I wish to perform a mitzva by serving as a priest? The Gemara explains: However, note that the mishna does not state: If he ascended, but rather: He ascends, in the present tense. Apparently he is obligated to ascend, even against his will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Yevamot.101a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ritv”a</a> on this explains that the non participation in the matanos is a reason not to work:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולהכי מתמיהי' היאך כופי' אותו לעלות משום מצוה <strong>הואיל ואינו חולק</strong> ואין ידוע משמרו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I found in the Mosad Rav Kook Ritv”a in footnote 352 on this piece, (these footnotes were written by R  Avraham Yaffin) that he explains that the Ritv”a means to address your exact question! He says, since we know that the matanos of a korban are “in lieu of your work” (words of the passuk) so since he doesn’t get the matanos he shouldn’t work. According to the Ritv”a, the Gemara is answering, that nonetheless he still has to work to avoid family shame, regardless of how he makes it happen.</p>\n\n\n",

This would seem to indicate that Tadir makes a mitzvah more important in a sense, to be on equal footing with a more holy mitzvah which we understand gives more importance.</p>\n<p>Perhaps, the importance of Tadir can be explained with a Medrash brought in the Hakdama of Ein Yakov and in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netivot_Olam%2C_Netiv_Ahavat_Reia.1.4?vhe=OYW&lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharal in Nesivos Olam</a> that discusses which one passuk of the Torah encaspulates the entire Torah best. The Medrash concludes that it is the passuk of Ben Pazi who says it is the passuk of the Korban Hatamid that includes everything in one passuk. The explanation given by many (I heard it from quite a few, most recently from Rabbi Frand) is that the point of a Jew is to serve Hashem like a servant. The hardest part of that service, is the day in day out routine, to not get bored, to keep up the enthusiasm and never fail to do the mitzvohs, even for one day. (It is not the daf, it is the Yomi).</p>\n<p>With this, perhaps, we can understand why Tadir is more important. Conventional wisdom says that something that is rare is more important. It is more exciting. Eating matzah on the first night of Pesach is more exciting than putting on tefillin on Erev Pesach. However, the Torah looks at things differently. The point is the Tadir, the daily service without fail. That is why Tadir is more important.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Let me attempt an explanation from first principles. (So I will try to document those principles, as a compromise with your closing request.)</p>\n<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> the more frequent mitzvah is more frequent because it is something we need to work on more. Therefore, we give it priority.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Say the purpose of halakhah is to provide a discipline for becoming a better person. (What \"better person\" means is a bit further off topic, not for this answer.) Then, why would one activity be recommended more often than another?</p>\n<p>A comparatively famous ruling of the Rambam. He says <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.9?p2=Rambam_on_Pirkei_Avot.3.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on Avos 3:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold this thing is agreed upon by the philosophers as well: That habituation of the virtues - when it comes before [acquisition of] wisdom to the point that it is a strong possession, and he studies wisdom afterwards such that it will give him alacrity for those goods - will add joy and love to his wisdom and industriousness to increase upon it; since [wisdom] stimulates him to [do] that to which he is [already] accustomed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this, he writes a little later <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.15?p2=Rambam_on_Pirkei_Avot.3.15\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>mishnah</em> 15</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the virtues do not come to a man according to the quantity of the greatness of the deed, but rather according to the great number of good deeds. And this is that indeed the virtues arrive by repetition of the good deeds many times. And with this does a strong acquisition come - not when a man does one great deed from the good deeds; as from this alone, a strong acquisition will not come to him. And the parable with this is that when a man gives a thousand gold coins at one time to one man to whom it is fitting and he does not give anything to another man; the trait of generosity will not come into his hand with this great act, as [much as] it will come to one who donates a thousand gold pieces a thousand times and gives each one of them out of generosity. [This is] because this one repeated the act of generosity a thousand times and a strong acquisition of it came to him [in this way]. But [the other] only aroused his soul with a great arousal towards a good act, and afterwards it ceased from him. And so [too] with Torah, the reward of the one who redeems one captive with a hundred dinar or [gives] charity to a poor person with a hundred dinar which is enough for what he lacks is not like the one who redeems ten captives or fills the lack of ten poor people - each one with ten dinar. And in this comparison and this matter is that which he said, \"וְהַכֹּל לְפִי רֹב הַמַּעֲשֶׂה - in accordance to the majority of the deed\", and not in accordance to the greatness of the deed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it would seem that a mitzvah we do more often, the <em>tadir</em>, is something we need more practice at, more habituation.  As the Rambam said, regardless of the magnitude of the deed itself. The mitzvah that is <em>tadir</em> must be the one that is central to our <em>avodas Hashem</em> (worship of Hashem or doing Hashem's Work).</p>\n<p>So, shouldn't it get priority?</p>\n<p>(Note: I didn't bother quoting the Rambam in Hebrew because he wrote his commentary to the <em>mishnah</em> in Judeo-Arabic anyway.)</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I believe this is also why \"גָּדוֹל מְצֻוֶּוה וְעוֹשֶׂה יוֹתֵר מִמִּי שֶׁאֵינוֹ מְצֻוֶּוה וְעוֹשֶׂה -- םמק one who is commanded [to be obligated in a mitzvah] and does it is greater than one who is not commanded and does it.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.31a.12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Qiddushin 31a</a>)</p>\n<p>Yes, the usual explanation is that the person who was commanded and does, <em>metzuveh ve'oseh</em>, has a greater <em>yeitzer hara</em> (evil inclination) to overcome simple because it was commanded. So the act is greater. But what does it mean to have a greater <em>yeitzer hara</em> for something? And was Hashem's choice of who to command arbitrary?</p>\n<p>So, I would again suggest, the <em>metzuveh ve'oseh</em> is commanded because they need the mitzvah more to become the person Hashem made them to be. Which would explain why they have a greater internal hurdle to do it -- this is the areas that needs work! And since it is more central to the discipline needed to refine one's soul into a more accurate \"image\" of the Divine, the mitzvah has more value.</p>\n\n\n",

Even if the car is insured it's always a loss of thousands of Shekels.</p>\n<p>What are Halachic guidlines (with sources) about a situation where fixing a car can save a couple of thousands of Shekels, whith a high probability that another Jew was indirectly harmed in the process?</p>\n<p><em>NB: taking vehicles to garages over the border is forbidden by the Israeli law.</em></p>\n\n\n",

Habshush and/or Y. Kapach having influence from \"Joseph Halévy, a French-trained Jewish Orientalist, and Eduard Glaser, an Austrian-Jewish astronomer and Arabist\" - however when I searched the latter names in M. Antelman's \"To Eliminate the Opiate\" which is concerned largely with the Maskilim and its roots and offshoots, I don't find those names.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately I've lost contact with the person who mentioned this claim to me, and I'm not versed in Teimani history, so any information clarifying, documenting, or limiting this claim is appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>So it turns out that naturally, it's a bit of a machloket.</p>\n<p>Khabshush himself testified that there were groups of pro-Kabbalists and anti-Kabbalists or \"Baalei P'shat\" way before Halévy ever came to Yemen. As he wrote in his book <a href=\"https://ybz.org.il/_Uploads/dbsArticles/Goitein.Travels.in.Yemen.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מסעות חבשוש: חזיון תימן</a> (translated by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shelomo_Dov_Goitein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">S. D. Goitein</a>), p. 66:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"ובעת שהיינו שם, הגישו המחמירים שבהם, והם ההולכים אחרי ספרי הקבלה, את תלונותיהם לפני מורי יוסף (הלוי), שידון ביניהם ובין אחיהם בעלי הפשט...המחמירים טענו...כפי שמתבאר מספר הזהר הקדוש שהם אומרים עליו שהוא מזמן קדמונינו...ובעלי הפשט השיבו להם ואמרו: מנהג אבותינו תורה, ולא נשנה ממה שירשנו מקדמונינו...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And while we were there, the most stringent among them, and those that followed the Kabbalistic works, presented their complaints before Mori Yosef (Halévy), that he should judge between them and their brethren, followers of the p'shat...those that were stringent claimed...as is evident from the holy Zohar which they say...is from the time of our ancient forefathers...and the followers of p'shat replied and said: Our forefathers' tradition is the Torah, and we will not change from what we received from our forefathers...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Goitein noted in a footnote there that the contrasting views of the different groups came about decades before the rise of the Dor Deah group.</p>\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehudah Nini</a> in his essay \"מיוסף הלוי ושליחותו לגילוי כתובות שבאיות ועד מחלוקת \"עקשים ודרדעים\" בשנת תרע\"ד\", in the book יהדות תימן, argued that the two factions - pro-Kabbalists and anti-Kabbalists - did not deny one another's right to existence. They simply disagreed on what the proper way to pass halachic rulings was - based on Kabbalah as well as other works, or no Kabbalah. In his essay \"פולמוס מעניין ווכוח עקר על חכמת הקבלה בין חכמי תימן בראשית המאה\", Michael 14, p. 219, he wrote that Khabshush, Rabbi Kafich and <a href=\"https://teman.org.il/content/7082\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Sa'id Arusi</a> wanted to impress Halévy, whom they believed to be an important rabbi from Yerushalayim, so they took him on a night-time tour of the Sana'a shuls. Upon entering one of the shuls and seeing all of the Jews studying the Zohar, Halévy said \"ברוך דיין האמת\" and proceeded to rant off against the study of Kabbalah. The three guides were greatly embarrassed - here was (supposedly) a rabbi from Yerushalayim, and he was calling Kabbalah nonsense. The three stuck to him and were greatly influenced by him. In a sense, they became the first three Temani maskilim.</p>\n<p>Later on Glaser also came to Yemen and was in contact with at least Rabbi Kafich and Khabshush. To Rabbi Kafich he gave various scholarly works, as well as possibly three anti-Kabbalistic works written by some of the Acharonim. The most well-known of three is probably ארי נוהם by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_of_Modena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehuda Aryeh de Modena</a>. And with Khabshush, he tutored him on the subject that they had a common interest in: Ancient Yemenite inscriptions.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Kafich</a>, in ספונות ב, p. 281, footnote 219, where he wrote the account of the tour of the shul based on what he heard from his grandfather, seems to agree with Nini: The fact that Halévy seemed like a rabbi from Eretz-Yisrael, coupled with the way he played his derision of Kabbalah was enough to sow doubt in the hearts of these men. He concludes his description and short commentary on this story by noting:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"אפשר לומר שכל אותה מחלוקת שהיתה בתימן באה בסיבתו של הלוי.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"It may be said that all of that dispute [about Kabbalah] that was in Yemen came because of Halévy.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%94_%D7%92%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moshe Gavra</a> in his book תולדות עם ישראל בגלות תימן, p. 208, backpedals from this a bit. He says that while it's true that the fierce no-Kabbalah stance started with these three and strengthened greatly with the creation of Dor Deah, the movement to minimize the usage of Kabbalah started some decades prior (similar to what Goitein said). Rabbis such as <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93_%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%A7%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi David Mashriki</a> pushed for more usage of the Shulchan Aruch and other Acharonim, and less usage of Kabbalistic works. Similarly, <a href=\"https://library.osu.edu/projects/hebrew-lexicon/02491.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishael Kaspi</a> in his essay \"בתי הכנסת כמקור להבנת המבנה החברתי של הקהילה היהודית בצנעא\" in \"חברה וקהילה\", p. 59, points out that it is unlikely that one statement by Halévy was enough to sow doubt in the hearts of these three. More likely, they were already influenced by ideas and movements that had been gaining popularity in Yemen in the previous years.</p>\n\n\n",

This heightened awareness stems from a unique acuity that only women are blessed with known as בינה יתירה – literally, ‘additional understanding’. (Refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.45b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 45b</a><sup>1</sup>)</p>\n<p>HaRav Tzadok HaKohen of Lublin זצ\"ל adds that this female trait is rooted in the heart, whilst חכמה, wisdom, belongs to the male consciousness and stems from the brain.</p>\n<p>Quoting the Zohar<sup>2</sup> he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חכמה ובינה הם אבא ואימא</p>\n<p>Wisdom and understanding – they are the father (i.e. wisdom) and the mother (i.e. understanding)<sup>3</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What this means to say is that essentially, women have an intuitive and holistic understanding of the world around them. As their understanding originates from the heart, they are in tune with their emotions and have an extra sensory perception that males lack. Thus, Rav Tzadok comments that this trait of בינה is something that is a \"דבר ברור\" – “a precise matter”.<sup>4</sup>  In short, women can assess a situation with a heightened degree of clarity, a trait that plays a huge role within the home. It is with this attribute that they are able to judge the family balance noting which areas require greater care and attention.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Maharal writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Chayim.1.5.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Chaim on Pirkei Avos 1:5</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האשה יסוד מציאות הבית ויש ללכת אחר עצתה</p>\n<p>The woman is the foundation, (and is thus) the reality of the home, and one should resultantly follow her advice</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we see from this episode how a righteous woman was able to use her innate understanding of a situation which helped save her husband.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מלמד שנתן הקב\"ה בינה יתירה באשה יותר מבאיש</p>\n<p>This teaches that Hashem provides an additional understanding with women, more so than with men</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Zohar Parshas Yisro 5:1</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9619&st=&pgnum=43&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Refer to Dover Tzedek p.43</a> (last paragraph on page)</p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9619&st=&pgnum=48&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Refer to Dover Tzedek p.48</a></p>\n\n\n",

If this is the law with regard to an Eved Kena'ani -- who undergoes Tevilah in a Mikvah and is commanded to observe non-time-bound positive Mitzvos like a Jewish woman, then how much more so this law applies to an ordinary Nochri. For this reason, a number of Acharonim reject the Be'er Sheva's question, and there seem to be no authorities that take his approach (which the Be'er Sheva himself did not sanction in practice) (emphasis mine).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Concerning the seven mitzvos, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380332/jewish/The-Mitzvot-of-Non-Jews.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The authority of these laws derives from the verse, \"And the Lord G‑d commanded it upon the man…\" (Gen. 2:16).

The preceding events couldn't possibly have taken place in less than 6 months.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As I mentioned earlier, this verse is messy. It's missing Saul's age at accession.

I believe the Chazon Ish would not say the word \"Dog\" (people used this deragatorily by calling others a \"dog\"). Instead the Chazon Ish would say \"four legged one\" (in Yiddish).

The second mention of 20 years (which is supposed to be 20-40 years) in Genesis 31:41 mentions that Leah and Rachel were part of that set. The story up until now makes it sound that the first reason Jacob even worked for Laban was specifically for Rachel in the first 20 years of being there. I see this as a contradiction.</p>\n<p>2). The first set of twenty years: Genesis 31:38 \"Already twenty years have I been with you, and your ewes and she goats have not aborted, neither have I eaten the rams of your flocks.\" These verses are Jaacob's declaration that he didn't steal etc... Does that mean he is only making this claim on first 20 years, but not the second? This would be very odd in my humble opinion.</p>\n<p>3). The later verse Genesis 31:41 (mentioned in point 1) seems to include the whole story. The wife switching and working for animals. Why was he there for an additional 20 years?</p>\n<p>In Judaism we have another way of making Jacob's lifetime workout, we have a tradition that he spent some time learning Torah in the house of Shem and Eiver (the descendants of Noah) before going to Haran. There are a number of reasons why this is given, but I have not heard the opinion that he worked 40 years for Laban.</p>\n<p>I have found some translation of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8223/showrashi/true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi from Genesis 28:9</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since it says, “the daughter of Ishmael,” do I not know that she was\nthe sister of Nebaioth? But this teaches us that Ishmael died after he\nhad betrothed her to Esau, before her marriage, and her brother\nNebaioth gave her hand in marriage. This also teaches us that Jacob\nwas sixty-three years old at that time, for Ishmael was seventy-four\nyears old when Jacob was born. Ishmael was fourteen years older than\nIsaac, and Isaac was sixty years old when they were born, hence\n[Ishmael was] seventy-four. He lived one hundred and thirty seven\nyears, as it is stated (above 25:17): “and these are the years of the\nlife of Ishmael,” etc. Consequently, Jacob was sixty-three at\nIshmael’s death. We learn from here that he hid for fourteen years in\nthe house of Eber and afterwards went to Haran. [This can be deduced\nfrom the fact that] he stayed in Laban’s house before Joseph’s birth\nonly fourteen years, as it is said (below 31:41): “I worked for you\nfourteen years for your two daughters and six years for your sheep,”\nand the payment for the sheep took place after Joseph was born, as it\nis said (below 30:25): “And it came to pass when Rachel had given\nbirth to Joseph, etc.,” and Joseph was thirty years old when he became\nruler, and from then until Jacob descended to Egypt were nine years:\nseven of plenty and two of famine. And Jacob said to Pharaoh (below\n47:9): “The days of the years of my sojournings are one hundred and\nthirty years.” Go forth and figure 14 years before Joseph was born,\nplus the 30 years of Joseph’s age, plus the 9 years from the time he\nbecame ruler until Jacob came. The total is 53. And when he [Jacob]\nleft his father, he was 63, totaling 116. Yet he said [to Pharaoh, “I\nam] one hundred and thirty years old.” Hence, there are fourteen years\nmissing. Thus, you learn that after he had received the blessings, he\nhid in the house of Eber for fourteen years. [From Meg. 17:a.]\n(However, he was not punished [for these fourteen years] because of\nthe merit [of having studied] Torah, for Joseph was separated from his\nfather only twenty-two years, i.e., from age seventeen until age\nthirty-nine, corresponding to the twenty-two years that Jacob was\nseparated from his father [when] he did not honor him. These are the\ntwenty years in Laban’s house, plus the two years that he spent\ntraveling [home], as it is written (below 33:17): “And he built\nhimself a house, and for his cattle he made booths.” Our Rabbis of\nBlessed Memory inferred from this verse that he spent eighteen months\non the road, for the house was for the rainy season, and the booths\nwere for the summer. And, according to the calculation of the verses,\nwhich we calculated above, from the time he left his father until he\nwent down to Egypt, at the age of one hundred and thirty, we find an\nadditional fourteen years, therefore, it is certain that he hid in the\nhouse of Eber to learn Torah while on his way to the house of Laban.\nAnd because of the merit of the Torah, he was not punished for them\n[those fourteen years], and Joseph was separated from him for only\ntwenty-two years-measure for measure. The above is from an old Rashi\ntext).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

These people encountered by Israel in the desert some 700 years later were understandably viewed as \"sons of G-d\" by dint of their genealogy. \"When G-d saw that the evil perpetrated by man on the earth was great, and that all his thought processes were evil all day long, He regretted that He had made man\" (Genesis 6,5-6). Philosophers distinguish between evil as merely an act, and evil which had been both planned and executed. The person who commits the former can reform easily, since his thought processes have remained unaffected and can be employed to help control his actions. Not so when the evil is the product of one's thought processes. What counterweight is there then for such a person to achieve rehabilitation?

The words: \"The same were mighty men\" (Ibid.) INDICATE THAT ONLY THEY WERE THE MIGHTY MEN AND NOT THE ORIGINAL NEFILIM. There were only 60 of them by supernal reckoning, AS COMPARED WITH THE SIX DIRECTIONS - NAMELY CHESED, GVURAH, TIFERET, NETZACH, HOD AND YESOD OF ZEIR ANPIN. WE CAN DRAW ANALOGY FROM THE VERSES. Here in the scripture, it is written: \"The same were mighty men\" and there - IN RELATION TO KING SOLOMON, WHO IS ZEIR ANPIN - it is written, \"Sixty valiant men are round about it\" (Shir Hashirim 3:7). JUST AS THEY ARE 60 THERE, SO HERE THEY ARE 60, YET THE FIRST ONES ARE DRAWN FROM ABOVE, FROM SIX SIDES OF ZEIR ANPIN. Rabbi Yosi continued by saying: \"The same were the mighty men of old (lit. 'from the world')\" and this is written precisely TO DISTINGUISH THEM FROM THE FIRST NEFILIM, AZA AND AZAEL, WHO ORIGINATED IN THE WORLD ABOVE. THE WORLD IS THE FEMALE PRINCIPLE OF ZEIR ANPIN AND THE TEXT TEACHES US THAT THOSE MIGHTY MEN WERE INTENDED TO BECOME A CHARIOT FOR THE MALE AND FEMALE PRINCIPLES, AND THUS A PART OF THE FEMALE CALLED THE WORLD. HE ASKS: To which name does the text refer when it is written: \"Men of renown (lit. 'name')\" (Beresheet 6:4)? This is the world we have mentioned, WHICH IS THE FEMALE PRINCIPLE. The phrase \"men of name\" is precise. IT TEACHES US THROUGH AN ANALOGY BY STATING THAT it is written here: \"men of name\" and in another place: \"when he blasphemes the name\" (Vayikra 24:16). It is written: \"And the son of the Yisraelite woman blasphemed the name\" (Ibid. 11).

I understand there's a concern for the pain that the cows are going through, but why would that permit benefitting from the milk, which was extracted through <em>melacha</em>?</p>\n\n\n",

This formula, which states that the entire debt owed due to his transgressions has not been collected, raises the possibility that further payment will be exacted from him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַב יוֹסֵף: מַאי קְרָאָה — שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״כִּמְעַט כִּסְדוֹם הָיִינוּ״, מַאי אַהֲדַר לְהוּ נָבִיא — ״שִׁמְעוּ דְבַר ה׳ קְצִינֵי סְדוֹם״.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And Rav Yosef said: What is the verse from which it is derived? As it is stated: “We should have almost been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:9), after which what did the prophet reply to them? “Hear the word of the Lord, rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, people of Gomorrah” (Isaiah 1:10).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in Moed Kattan 18A (mentioned in a different answer) has a similar statement, although with a different language;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּאָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: מִנַּיִן שֶׁבְּרִית כְּרוּתָה לַשְּׂפָתַיִם — שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״וַיֹּאמֶר אַבְרָהָם אֶל נְעָרָיו שְׁבוּ לָכֶם פֹּה עִם הַחֲמוֹר וַאֲנִי וְהַנַּעַר נֵלְכָה עַד כֹּה וְנִשְׁתַּחֲוֶה וְנָשׁוּבָה אֲלֵיכֶם״, וְאִיסְתַּיְּיעָא מִלְּתָא דַּהֲדוּר תַּרְוַיְיהוּ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is as Rabbi Yoḥanan said: From where is it derived that a covenant is made with the lips, and that one’s speech has the power to change events? For it is stated: “And Abraham said to his young men: Stay here with the donkey, and I and the lad will go onward; and we will worship, and we will come back to you” (Genesis 22:5). Abraham said this even though he thought that he was going to sacrifice his son as an offering and that Isaac would not be returning, yet this had an influence and they both came back</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosfos on that Gemara questions why it brings a proof from a case of something good happening, to a case of something bad happening, he asks that it would be more appropriate to bring the proof as the Gemara in Berachos;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואיסתייעא מילתא דהדור. תימה דלמא מדה טובה מרובה והוה ליה לאתויי הא דאמר עולא בעלמא (ברכות דף יט. ע\"ש) לעולם אל יפתח אדם פיו לשטן שנאמר שמעו דבר ה' קציני סדום כו' (ישעיהו א׳:י׳)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharsha answers that the difference is whether the words are being spoken about yourself or others, he further explains the rationale behind the fact that words can cause disaster, as being related to the fact that it is like the person is saying testimony on himself that he deserves such and such;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנראה ליישב את זה דההיא דאל יפתח פיו לשטן איירי כשהאומר כלל את עצמו באותו פורענות ורעה כדמוכחי הענינים דהתם והטעם בו כמ\"ש בע\"י שלא יתן פתחון פה לשטן לקטרג ולומר הודאת בעל דין כמאה עדים דמי ולא נשאר מקום למדת הרחמים להאריך אפים כו' ע\"ש וליכא לדמויי לההיא דהכא איירי בשגגה היוצא מדברי האומר ברעת פורעניות או בטובת זולתו כדמוכח הענין פנחס לשמואל והטעם בו כאומרם ניבא ואינו יודע מה ניבא וכפרש\"י בחומש ונשובה נתנבא שישובו שניהם עכ\"ל והשתא אין סברא לחלק בין מידה טובה למדה רעה בנבואה היוצאת מדברי האומר בשגגה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chinuch in Mitzvah 231 explains the reason for the prohibition of cursing people to be related to the power of speech to affect outcomes;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שאין בנו כח לדעת באי זה ענין תנוח הקללה במקלל ואי זה כח בדבור להביאה עליו, ידענו דרך כלל מכל בני העולם שחוששין לקללות, בין ישראל בין שאר האמות, ויאמרו שקללת בני אדם גם קללת הדיוט תעשה רשם במקלל ותדביק בו המארה והצער. ואחר דעתנו דבר זה מפי הבריות נאמר כי משרשי המצוה, שמנענו השם מהזיק בפינו לזולתנו כמו שמנענו מהזיק להם במעשה, וכעין ענין זה אמרו זכרונם לברכה (מו''ק יח א) ברית כרותה לשפתים. כלומר, שיש כח בדברי פי אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even though we do not have the power to know in which way a curse impacts upon the one cursed, and with what power within speech there is to bring [that impact] upon him, we know more generally that people are concerned about curses - whether Israel or other nations - and say that curses of people, and even curses of commoners, have an impact on the one cursed and attaches malediction and distress to him. And since we know this thing from the mouth of the creatures, we will say that it is from the roots of the commandment that God prevented us from injuring others with our mouths, [just] like he prevented us from injuring them with action. And similar to this did they, may their memory be blessed, say (Moed Katan 18a), \"A covenant is made with the lips\" - meaning to say that there is power in the words of a person's mouth</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואפשר לנו לומר, לפי עניות דעתנו, כי בהיות הנפש המדברת שבאדם חלק עליוני, וכמו שכתוב (בראשית ב ז) ויפח באפיו נשמת חיים. ותרגם לרוח ממללא, נתן בה כח רב לפעל אפילו במה שהוא חוץ ממנה, ועל כן ידענו ונראה תמיד כי לפי חשיבות נפש האדם ודבקותה בעליונים כנפש הצדיקים והחסידים ימהרו דבריהם לפעל בכל מה שידברו עליו, וזה דבר ידוע ומפרסם בין יודעי דעת ומביני מדע</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And it is possible for us to stay - according to the paucity of our intelligence - that since the speaking soul in man is the elevated part, and as it is written (Genesis 2:7), \"He blew into his nostrils the breath of life,\" and it is translated (by Onkelos) as \"a speaking spirit\"; He gave it great power to impact even on that which is external to it. And hence we have known and it is always seen that to the extent of the importance of a man's soul and its clinging to the elevated things - like [is the case with] the souls of the righteous and the pious - will their words be quick to impact upon all that they speak about</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&st=&pgnum=169\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashba in 1:408</a> explains that words can effect an outcome is a known fact and proven in Gemara but the reason is above our understanding.</p>\n<p>Another passage that is similar is derived from the Passuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.10.5?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Koheles 10:5</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יֵ֣שׁ רָעָ֔ה רָאִ֖יתִי תַּ֣חַת הַשָּׁ֑מֶשׁ כִּשְׁגָגָ֕ה שֶׁיֹּצָ֖א מִלִּפְנֵ֥י הַשַּׁלִּֽיט׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here is an evil I have seen under the sun as great as an error committed by a ruler</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.23a?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kesubos 23A</a> explains this as the reason for the daughters of Shmuel becoming captives, and on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.62b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">62B</a> it is the reason for the son in law of Rav Yannai to pass away, In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.68a.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 88A</a> explains it as the reason for the death of Ameimar.

For example, there are five (and possibly more) kevarim that are believed by local Jews in the following regions to be the tomb of Daniel. Two in the Khuzestan region of Iran, one in the city of Kirkuk in Iraq, one in Samarkand in Uzbekistan, and one in Jorf El-Yhoudi in Morocco. Or for another example, many historians find it doubtful as to whether or not Esther and Mordechai are truly buried at their purported location in Hamadan given that the edifice is believed to have been built in the twelfth century.\nIn cases like these where one can be doubtful if not highly suspicious of the historicity of these locations, is there any point to visit and daven at these sights anyway?</p>\n\n\n",

If an opinion is altered or retracted before the completion of the Mishnah, the Mishnah will hint to it.

Therefore, If there is a 3rd opinion without the above conditions it is a contemporary opinion. Furthermore, it is hard to imagine a 3rd opinion not being a contemporary if a בת קול states the Halacha is like Beis Hillel.

    "content": "# Can a lake or river be used as a kosher Mikva?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question is regarding the mikvah. Can a river or lake (like somewhere out in the forest or wilderness or wherever) be used as a mikvah? I know and have heard of many pious and holy Jews (even many great Kabbalists and Hasidic masters) throughout history (and indeed, even in the Bible) using natural bodies of water such as oceans, lakes and rivers as a mikvah when needed and for ritual purity. So, if I’m outside walking somewhere in the forest for example, and I require the use of a mikvah, and by chance encounter I come upon a river or a little lake... can I use it as a mikvah? My question is more concerning the use of a mikvah for men than for women. I’d also appreciate some information about some of the kabbalistic aspects and customs regarding the mikvah. Thank you very much.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simple answer is - Yes, it is allowed (although I would advise discussing it with your LOR).</p>\n<p>With regards to rivers though, it is not clear-cut, the Shulchan Aruch in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.201.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 201:2</a> indicates that there is a machlokes (dispute) which is dependent on the nature of the body of water. The Rema provides a meikel (lenient) approach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי מעיין מטהרין אף בזוחלין (פירוש זוחלין נמשכים והולכים ואינן מכונסים) מי גשמים אין מטהרין אלא באשבורן (פירוש מקום עמוק שמתכנסים בו המים ונקרא אשבורן) (אבל על ידי זחילה פסולין מן התורה (ב\"י בשם מהרי\"ק שורש קט\"ו ות\"ה סימן רכ\"ד) אם הם לחוד בלא מעיין) היו הזוחלין מן המעיין מתערבי' עם הנוטפי' שהם מי גשמים הרי הכל כמעיין לכל דבר ואם רבו הנוטפים על הזוחלין וכן אם רבו מי גשמים על מי הנהר אינם מטהרים בזוחלין אלא באשבורן לפיכך צריך להקיף מפץ (פי' כעין מחצלת) וכיוצא בו באותו הנהר המעורב עד שיקוו המים ויטבול בהם: הגה וכן נכון להורות ולהחמיר (מהרי\"ק ות\"ה שם ושאר אחרוני' כתבו ויש להחמיר כשטת הר\"ם ורא\"ש וסייעתם) <strong>אבל יש מתירים לטבול בנהרות כל השנה אף בשעת הגשמים והפשרת שלגים ורבו הנוטפים על הזוחלין משום דעיקר גידול הנהר הוא ממקום מקורו (טור בשם ר\"ת וב\"י בשם רש\"י וסה\"ת וסמ\"ג) וכן נהגו ברוב המקומות במקום שאין מקוה ואין למחות ביד הנוהגין להקל כי יש להם על מי שיסמוכו (מהרי\"ק ובת\"ה שם ומהרי\"ו סימן ע' וב\"ז סימן קנ\"ד) מיהו יש ליזהר מלטבול בנהר המתהוה לגמרי ע\"י גשמים וכשאין גשמים פוסק לגמרי</strong> אף על פי ששאר נהרות שופכים לתוכו בשעת הגשמים ומתהוה על ידן מ\"מ הואיל ופוסק לגמרי בשעה שאין גשמים אסור לטבול בו דרך זחילתו עד שיקוו המים שבתוכו (שם במהרי\"ק) אבל בנהר שאינו פוסק אע\"פ שבשעת הגשמים מתרחב ומתפשט על כל גדותיו מותר לטבול בו בכל מקום (ב\"י לדעת המרדכי והאשיר\"י והתוספ') לפי סברת המקילין ולפי מה שנהגו</p>\n<p>Spring water purifies even when it is flowing. Rain water only purifies when in a still body, but when it is flowing, it is Biblically invalid, if it is detached from a spring. If the flowing water from a spring mixed with downflow which derives from rain, then the whole mixture has the status of the spring for all purposes. But if the downflow is greater than the spring flow, or similarly if rain water makes up the majority of the water in a river, they do not purify while flowing but only while still. Therefore one must set up a barrier or something like it in the mixed river, until the water gathers together and one can immerse in it. [Comment of Rema: And thus it is correct to teach and to be stringent. <strong>But some permit immersion in rivers all year round, even during rain and snowmelt season, when the downflow is greater than the spring flow, because the essence of the river's size is from its source location. This is the practice in most places where there is no mikveh, and we should not reprimand those who have the custom to be lenient, because they have authorities to rely on. However, one must be careful not to immerse in a river that appears entirely through rain, and when there is no rain it stops completely.</strong> Even if other rivers pour into it during the rainy season and it appears through them, in any case, since it stops entirely during the season when there is no rain, it is forbidden to immerse in it while it is flowing, until the waters are gathered together. But a river that does not stop, even even if during the rain it swells and and expands over its banks, it is permissible to immerse in it in any case, according to the lenient opinions and the common practice.] (Sefaria translation, emphasis mine.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that the Rema concludes that it is preferable to follow the Shulchan Aruch’s opinion, but one should not admonish those who do immerse in rivers.</p>\n<p>Indeed the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.201.42?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aruch HaShulchan</a> notes similar to the Rema that there were those who lived far from proper mikvaos and would thus rely on rivers.</p>\n<p>One other area to be conscious of if you are interested in taking a dip in the great outdoors is to be aware of the tznius (modesty) ramifications. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.198.34?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 198:34</a> writes expressly that one should avoid using such places if one's modesty will be compromised.</p>\n\n\n",

The blurb there read as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Geonic period from about the late sixth to mid-eleventh centuries is of crucial importance in the history of Judaism. The Geonim, for whom this era is named, were the heads of the ancient talmudic academies of Babylonia. They gained ascendancy over the older Palestinian center of Judaism and were recognized as the leading religious and spiritual authorities by most of the world’s Jewish population. The Geonim and their circles enshrined the Babylonian Talmud as the central canonical work of rabbinic literature and the leading guide to religious practice, and it was a predominantly Babylonian version of Judaism that was transplanted to newer centers of Judaism in North Africa and Europe. Robert Brody’s book―the first survey in English of the Geonic period in almost a century―focuses on the cultural milieu of the Geonim and on their intellectual and literary creativity.</p>\n<p>Brody describes the cultural spheres in which the Geonim were active and the historical and cultural settings within which they functioned. He emphasizes the challenges presented by other Jewish institutions and individuals, ranging from those within the Babylonian Jewish setting―especially the political leadership represented by the Exilarch―to the competing Palestinian Jewish center and to sectarian movements and freethinkers who rejected rabbinic authority altogether. He also describes the variety of ways in which the development of Geonic tradition was affected by the surrounding non-Jewish cultures, both Muslim and Christian</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, you might want to try Rabbi Berel Wein's <em><strong><a href=\"https://www.shopeichlers.com/products/herald-of-destiny/2960\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Herald of Destiny</a></strong></em> - on his website <a href=\"https://www.rabbiwein.com/Herald-of-DestinybrBook-P6.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> it lays out the structure of the book and in the first section he spends much time look at the Geonim from their rise till the end of the period.</p>\n<p>As far as exploring their responsa, Louis Ginzberg's <em><strong>Geonica</strong></em> is available in its entirety on <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/64815\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrewbooks</a></p>\n\n\n",

So why do we thank G-d for giving us knowledge if he didn’t really give it to us, but rather we took it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>It seems that Adam Harishon was a smart man and had a lot of wisdom even before the Eitz Hadaat, and the Eitz Hadaat gave him very specific knowledge (as I will explain below):</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sources that Adam Harishon had a lot of wisdom:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Gemera in Senhedrin 38b says Adam spoke Aramaic. The Ben Yehoyada over there says Adam HaRishon for sure knew 70 languages.</li>\n<li>Beresheit 2:9 mentions that Adam Harishon named animals. In Beresheit Rabah  17:4 it says that when Hashem decided to create man, He consulted the angels, saying, \"Let us make man.\" The angels questioned man's nature, and Hashem responded that man's wisdom would surpass theirs. To demonstrate this, Hashem brought animals before the angels, who could not name them, but Adam named them accurately (and we know the naming happened before Adam ate from the Eitz Hadaat).</li>\n<li>Ritva in Avodah Zara 8a says that Adam Harishon was, מלא חכמה כמלאך אלוקים, he was filled with wisdom like a Malach Elokim.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>In Da'at Tevunot Chapter 2 Part 5 in the Feldeim Version by Rabbi Mordechai Rose (page 68) it says:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>, ואמנם אדה\"ר באמת חכם גדול היה, והיה לו לחקור בחכמתו על זה כראוי; וגם כבר היה יודע אמתתו של דבר מצד חכמתו, שכל מה שרואה מנגד מה שהודיע לו יתב' מן אמתת התיקון - אינו אלא שקר מדומה, מכלל הרע שברא הוא ית\"ש להודיע אמתת יחודו, ולנסות בו את האדם עצמו לתת לו זכות</p>\n<p>Indeed, Adam was truly a wise person and should have investigated this matter properly with his wisdom (to eating from the Eitz Hadaat). Moreover, he already knew the truth of the matter through his wisdom that anything he observed opposed the truth that Hashem had revealed to him about the perfection of creation was nothing more than an illusory falsehood. This falsehood was part of the evil that Hashem created to demonstrate the truth of His unity and to test humanity itself, thereby granting them merit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>He then continues and says:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל אדם הראשון נתפתה בתחלה אחר התאוה והתשוקה שלו, ואז חזר וחשב סברות רעות כדי להקל לעצמו. והרי זה כעין מה שאמרו רז\"ל (סנהדרין סג ע\"ב), \"לא עבדו ישראל עבודה זרה אלא להתיר להם עריות בפרהסיא\"; ואמרו רז\"ל (סנהדרין לח ע\"א), \"אדם הראשון מין היה\". והנה, אז הוצרך להראות לו במופת מה שלא רצה להשיג מצד הידיעה, והיינו להראות לו מהו הרע באמת; ואיך, אף על פי שמניחים לו מקום כל כך גדול, סוף סוף צריך לבא הכל לממשלת הטוב היחידית; והוא דרך קושי העוה\"ז שנגזר עליו, כדי שסוף סוף יבא לידי האמונה שלא רצה לעמוד בה מתחלה, אלא שיתברר לו במופת בפרט מה שהיה יכול להשיג מתחלה, ולהתברר לו הכל בבת אחת</p>\n<p>\"But the first man was enticed by desire and his lust, and then he returned and thought up bad logical arguments in order to make it easier for himself. And therefore this is like that which our Rabbis of blessed memory said (Sanhedrin 63b), \"Israel did not worship Idol worship other than to permit themselves illicit relations in public\"; and the Rabbis of blessed memory said (Sanhedrin 38a), \"The first man was a heretic\". And here, then it was necessary to show him through wonder what he did not want to grasp from the aspect of knowledge, and this was to show him what negativity is truly; and how, even though he is given such a large space, in the end everything has to come to the rulership of the singular good; and this is the difficult path of this world that was decreed upon him, in order that in the end he come to the faith that he did not want to stand by from the beginning, rather that it will be made clear to him through wonder in detail, that which he could have grasped from the beginning, and to make clear to hime everything in one moment.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see from the Ramchal that Adam Harishon eating from the eitz hadaat only allowed Adam to actually internalize what bad or evil really is. Before the sin he knew \"bad or evil\" existed but he didn't know what it actually was.</p>\n<p>As an aside when it says in Beresheit 3:7 וַתִּפָּקַ֙חְנָה֙ עֵינֵ֣י שְׁנֵיהֶ֔ם וַיֵּ֣דְע֔וּ כִּ֥י עֵֽירֻמִּ֖ם הֵ֑ם וַֽיִּתְפְּרוּ֙ עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה וַיַּעֲשׂ֥וּ לָהֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת׃, \"Then the eyes of both of them were opened and they perceived that they were naked; and they sewed together fig leaves and made themselves loincloths.\" Rashi quoting Bereshit Rabah 19:6 explains that Hashem just gave them a specific wisdom or realization that they had one job entrusted to them and they now knew they had stripped (\"naked\") from it. They realized they messed up and it was bad.</p>\n<p><strong>Therefore, we can thank Hashem for the wisdom, understanding, and knowledge that He has bestowed upon us without forcing it upon ourselves.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Simply entering the country was enough to cause even the greatest tzadikkim to be in danger of spiritual harm. The Torah tells us that when Avraham Avinu entered Mitzrayim, he became aware of Sarah's external beauty for the first time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Chaim Dov Stark then goes on to bring an Arizal, as quoted by the author of Nesivos Hamishpat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Arizal, as quoted by the Nesivos Hamishpat, states that Avraham Avinu was on such a lofty level of kedushah that, under normal circumstances, he was incapable of even seeing Sarah's external appearance. Once he entered Mitzrayim, however, the impurity of the land itself lowered his level of kedushah to the extent that he was able to perceive her phyiscal beauty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the footnotes in Yesod HaBayis (p. 53, footnote 4) it explains this idea further. It is in Hebrew, so I tried to translate it. It basically says that Avraham Avinu was like Adam HaRishon, before the \"original sin\", where Adam and Chava noticed each others nakedness. Avraham Avinu was on that same level as Adam. But, when Avraham Avinu entered Mitzrayim, he was lowered from this level, and was now able to see the physical beauty of his wife Sarah.</p>\n<p>Rabbi David Hanania Pinto explains in <a href=\"https://hevratpinto.org/Livres/english_books/01_Bereshit.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat David (p. 181)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Even in their private life, they refrained from immoderation, according to their high spiritual level, and denied themselves any overindulgence of the senses. This is why Avraham was not overly familiar with his wife’s beauty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This seems to accept the idea that before entering Mitzrayim, Avraham Avinu had such a high spiritual level, that he never looked at Sarah the way he did when entering Mitzrayim.</p>\n<p>My own chiddush is that Avraham Avinu \"went down to Mitzrayim\". Going down often symbolizes going the other way from G-d, further away from G-d. That's why G-d said to Avraham: Lech lecha, meaning to come closer to G-d.

Namely, the ashes of the red heifer are sprinkled upon an impure person. Upon receiving said sprinkling, they become pure, and the one doing the sprinkling becomes impure.</p>\n<p>Now, this does seem to be what the Torah says in Numbers 19:21:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָיְתָ֥ה לָהֶ֖ם לְחֻקַּ֣ת עוֹלָ֑ם וּמַזֵּ֤ה מֵֽי־הַנִּדָּה֙ יְכַבֵּ֣ס בְּגָדָ֔יו וְהַנֹּגֵ֙עַ֙ בְּמֵ֣י הַנִּדָּ֔ה יִטְמָ֖א עַד־הָעָֽרֶב׃</p>\n<p>That shall be for them a law for all time. Further, the one who sprinkled the water of lustration shall wash those clothes; and whoever touches the water of lustration shall be impure until evening.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, I guess I didn't read Rashi carefully, as he brings there from Yoma 14a and Niddah 9a that the word \"מזה\", or the one who sprinkled, isn't to be read literally. There, it means someone who <em>carries</em> the purifying waters, not for the sake of sprinkling (see Tosafos <em>Niddah</em>), becomes impure. However, the sprinkler remains pure.</p>\n<p>While this also is a paradox, I was wondering if anyone (Tannaim, Rishonim, Achronim) actually reads the verse literally. I did see Rabbi Akiva in that <em>gemarra</em> disagrees with the Sages, but says a different paradox: If person who was sprinkled upon was impure, he will become pure. However, if they were already pure, they'll become impure. This is brought by Rabbeinu Bachaye, Numbers 19:19. However, this is different than the literal reading of the verse which I brought.</p>\n\n\n",

Or perhaps, she transfers an asset into her name, without him knowing.</p>\n<p>Or in another case, she misleads him into an investment that causes him a significant loss but benefits her or her parents.</p>\n<p>What halachic recourse does the husband have?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A great question, one is not allowed to steal from a spouse.</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>A Husband cannot take a wife's personal property without her consent (קיצור ש׳׳ע ס׳י קפ׳׳ב סע׳י י׳׳א). Each spouse can have their \"personal property\", especially property brought in before the marriage.</p>\n<p>Assuming a spouse took another spouse's property the legal solution (though not ideal) would be to go to court or have a Rabbi determine what can be done. For example in Igros Moshe (אה׳׳ע ח׳׳א סי׳ י׳׳ב) Rav Moshe determines that a charity foundation should return the $2000 dollars to the wife because she had taken it incorrectly from the Husband.</p>\n<p>I think in regard to misleading with an investment, this is hard to argue. Although it might be wrong and self-serving and Hashem will punish a person, the Husband though \"manipulated\" did take a \"gamble\" as the nature of any investment. Unless there was outright fraud. It is hard to argue an investment will 100% remain the principle whilst gaining profit (such investments don't usually exist). In fact there might be an issue of Ribbis (prohibited like usury) if the principle is secure, but mostly every investment has some likely loss or it might be ribbis. So I can't imagine a court returning the money from a 3rd party to the Husband unless there was fraud. He simply knew when he gave his money he may no longer see it again as the nature of investments. Unless like I said there was something illegal done with money. For example the 3rd party bought a home for the wife's parents and there never was an investment.</p>\n<p>I would also say that usually spouses share accounts and so many times this question doesn't or can't come up since the money is either not gone yet, or it is in a 3rd party's hands, which makes it very difficult to reclaim.</p>\n<p>Also see שו\"ת הרשב\"ש (סימן צ\"א) where there is a complicated case where a husband leaves to a remote location and his wife rents their rental home (rented for a year) to a 3rd party after the husband left. He comes home and demands this 3rd person leave and that his wife was not entitled to do this. There the רשב\"ש answers that it is well known that woman rent and sell without permission of their husbands, and it is normal for a wife to do this. And how much moreso in this case where she was poor and a Husband is responsible for supporting his wife. He rules that the Husband cannot kick this individual out of their house.</p>\n\n\n",

If they were not conceived in sanctity and only their birth was in sanctity, they do not perform ḥalitza or levirate marriage, but they are liable for engaging in intercourse with a brother’s wife.

Teshubha 2:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם לא שב אלא בימי זקנותו, ובעת שאי אפשר לו לעשות מה שהיה עושה--אף על\nפי שאינה תשובה מעולה, מועלת היא לו ובעל תשובה הוא</p>\n<p>If he does not repent until his old age, at a time when he is\nincapable of doing what he did before, even though this is not a high\nlevel of repentance, he is a Baal-Teshubhah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if one does not face the same circumstances or is even physically incapable of perpetrating the same transgression, their teshubhah is of avail and effective.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>doesn’t Teshuva in its most basic performance require admission (Viduy) of your sins. How would one confess their specific sins in the moment before death?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It sounds like you are asking about a scenario where one is physically incapacitated and cannot move their lips and thereby perform widui. More important than the lips moving however is the internal transformation. So much so that without the internal transformation, the widui is pointless (comparable to immersing in the miqwa while holding a sheres, see 2:3-4). I would venture to say that where one is on their deathbed and physically incapable of moving their lips, the principle of אונס רחמנא פטריה (the Merciful One exempts) would apply and the thoughts would be sufficient. We see elsewhere that the mere possibility of the existence of a thought of teshubha can effectuate qiddushin (Qiddushin 49b). I would expect that all the more so, where one is actually doing the internal heavy lifting, and simply cant physically articulate it, that it would be of avail.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Each Gemara deserves its own answer individually (feel free to ask a more specific question). For example an act of self-sacrifice might be like overriding the exact sin they had done - though not the exact situation.</p>\n<p>When we say that someone must be in the same situation, presumably if it is equivalent where the person would have sinned previously, but post tshuva does not or would not do that same sin, that is logically like being in the same situation. And so when someone is willing to give up their life (for example) in many ways that shows a self control that is very powerful and demonstrates they would not have sinned.</p>\n<p>We also say that Hashem sometimes considers intentions for a good deed like the action was done. This is specifically when the person would do the action if not for something stopping him.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב אסי אפי׳ חשב אדם לעשות מצוה ונאנס ולא עשאה מעלה עליו הכתוב כאילו עשאה (קידושין מ.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based off of this principle perhaps he is considered to have said Vidui and done Tshuva.</p>\n<p>Finally, there is a Gemara on Chagiga 5a that if someone regrets a sin they are forgiven immediately.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א״ר חנינא בר פפא כל העושה דבר ומתחרט בו מוחלין לו מיד שנאמר ולא יראוני הא יראוני מוחלין להם מיד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I would argue that you can see that someone might be forgiven, but perhaps it might not be considered like Tshuva where the act is erased from having ever been performed or considered like a Mitzvah. And so there are different levels of forgiveness, tshuvah etc...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is no actual requirement to be in the same situation again and resist doing the sin. There isn't even a requirement for the teshuvah to last -- if a person on Yom Kippur is in the right place, they get credit for that regardless of any later backsliding.</p>\n<p>The Rambam, Hilkhos Teshuvah 2:2 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּמַה הִיא הַתְּשׁוּבָה. הוּא שֶׁיַּעֲזֹב הַחוֹטֵא חֶטְאוֹ וִיסִירוֹ מִמַּחֲשַׁבְתּוֹ וְיִגְמֹר בְּלִבּוֹ שֶׁלֹּא יַעֲשֵׂהוּ עוֹד שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ישעיה נה ז) \"יַעֲזֹב רָשָׁע דַּרְכּוֹ\" וְגוֹ'. וְכֵן יִתְנַחֵם עַל שֶׁעָבַר שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (ירמיה לא יט) \"כִּי אַחֲרֵי שׁוּבִי נִחַמְתִּי\". וְיָעִיד עָלָיו יוֹדֵעַ תַּעֲלוּמוֹת שֶׁלֹּא יָשׁוּב לְזֶה הַחֵטְא לְעוֹלָם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (הושע יד ד) \"וְלֹא נֹאמַר עוֹד אֱלֹהֵינוּ לְמַעֲשֵׂה יָדֵינוּ\" וְגוֹ'. וְצָרִיךְ לְהִתְוַדּוֹת בִּשְׂפָתָיו וְלוֹמַר עִנְיָנוֹת אֵלּוּ שֶׁגָּמַר בְּלִבּוֹ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And what is Teshuvah? It is:<br/>1a. That the sinner leaves the sin,<br/>1b. take it out of his thoughts,<br/>2a. conclude in his heart that he will not do it again ...<br/>2b. similarly, he should be reconciled with his past ... <em>[Does this mean regret? To work out the historical source of the prediliction, like psychoanalysis? -mb]</em><br/>3. and the One Who Knows secrets would testify about him that he wouldn't return to this sin forever. And<br/>4. he must confess with his lips and say these [three or five] things which he concluded in his heart.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notice how the Rambam refers to G-d in what I labeled 3. Not \"the One Who Knows the future\", but the \"One Who knows secrets\". So, there is no need for the situation to actually come up. Rather, the Rambam is defining teshuvah as changing the state of our thoughts and emotions. To the point that Hashem, Who Knows what is in our minds (both consciously and unconsciously), would Know that the mind in its current state couldn't repeat the sin.</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, we are careful to only use certain names and there is an order to those names.

My intuition is that formal prayer allows us to use words to direct our mind/heart (Beis Elokim Chapter 3), perhaps your own personal prayer allows for your mind/heart to express itself into words. They are both very powerful and serve different purposes.</p>\n<p>I would say continue but continuously learn the rules of prayer so that you can try not to break any rules in a pursuit of coming closer to Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The verse says \"G-d is close...to all those who call him with truth [sincerely]\".

Though there is a disagreement on this point, it appears he holds that dying hair is inherently feminine and general custom can't change this.

This would require Daas Torah not a survey.</p>\n<p>Also the Halacha in 182 seems to allow a man dying his black hair white according to a number of Poskim there (Taz etc...).

Below is background as per chabad.org (dont know if its necessary to include.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Judaism, Even a small trace of a non-kosher substance—as little as\n1/60th (1.66 percent) of the food’s volume, and in certain cases, even\nless than that—will render an otherwise kosher food not kosher. By the\nsame token, utensils that come in contact with hot food will absorb\nits “taste” and subsequently impart it to other food.</p>\n<p>Even the slightest residue or “taste” of a non-kosher substance will\nrender a food not kosher. So it’s not enough to buy only kosher food.\nThe kitchen, too, must be “kosher,” meaning that all cooking utensils\nand food preparation surfaces are used exclusively for kosher food,\nand that separate stoves, pots, cutlery, dishes, counter surfaces and\ntable coverings are used for meat and dairy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The laws of Kashrut are quite complex. In fact some things might technically be okay even Halachically but women/men have been stringent and this became the custom.</p>\n<p>In regard to your question although one could in theory clean a pot and wait 24 hours so that there is no unkosher taste (it becomes פגום). This is Rabbinically prohibited for fear one might accidentally not wait the appropriate time. In addition perhaps one cooks a sharp food that rejuvenates the taste. Similarly Nullifying is not straightforward, first of all it should not be done intentionally ש׳׳ע יורה דעה צט, סע׳ ה.(ie: used as a loophole only as a leniency if done accidentally). See  ש׳׳ך יורה דעה, צט, ס\"ק ז who says it is rabbinically prohibited - though some others hold it is prohibited by the Torah.</p>\n<p>And so going back to the example of a clean pot cooked after 24 hours, if it was deliberate. Pri Megadim (M.Z. OC 451:2) penalizes him and forbids him to eat the food. Igros Moshe (YD 2:41) disagrees, and although it is forbidden to do this there is no penalty and the food may be eaten.</p>\n<p>Similarly it might become very difficult to determine how much of the permitted food is necessary to nullify the pot. For instance when only a kzayis (olive) of milk was used in a clean pot, then it can be nullified with 60x a kazayis. However if you regularly use the pot for milk the day before (without knowledge of the amount) then the whole pot must be nullified see יורה דעה צח:ד. Now if that milk pot had a some meat cooked in it, the pot is now prohibited (due to absorbing milk and meat). No longer can it be nullified against 60x the meat, but instead must be nullified against the 60x the milk and meat, which in this case is the pot once again. This last part is a disagreement see יורה דעה צח:ו and also the ט׳׳ז there. So although 60x can cause nullification it is not always so straightforward and simple.</p>\n<p>So it is Rabbinically prohibited so that you not accidentally not clean the pot (mixing actually food stuff), or in case you don't wait the appropriate time (mixing taste), and that intentional nullification of a prohibition is not allowed. Finally even if all these issues were moot, it is not straightforward to nullify things and a Rabbi should be consulted.</p>\n\n\n",

Nachmanides (Chavel edition page 115) – as distinct from the Midrash Rabbah quoted by Rashi – does not see in this a directive to be separate, to refrain from incest, etc., but understands it to mean that people who qualify for the description קדושים, holy, are the ones who have sanctified themselves not by abstaining from what is forbidden, but by abstaining from what is permitted, each person according to his individual urges. Our sages (Yevamot 20a) have called this process קדש עצמך במותר לך, \"sanctify yourself by denying yourself something you are entitled to!\" From the above we learn that to a certain extent every single person has his own Torah. Assuming that every person had the same natural tendencies, and that every day or hour of the year would be identical to each other [that there would not be a predisposition to seek warmth in the winter and a cooling breeze in the summer, for instance. Ed.], the Torah, when legislating what may or may not be eaten would simply write that: \"a certain quantity of certain foods may be consumed, everything else is prohibited.\" The Torah would express itself in similar terms concerning with whom and how frequently one is allowed to have sexual intercourse. The Torah would find a way to phrase prohibitions of permitted speech and thought in a similar way. As it is impossible to state these prohibitions in such a detailed manner, the Torah has to allow for the differences in the nature of different people. It therefore contents itself with a general directive: \"Strive to become holy!\" The meaning of the directive of the Talmud to sanctify oneself by means of denying oneself enjoyment of things which are permitted in principle, is that a person must be mature enough to know what is permissible in accordance with his particular station in life and his particular natural tendencies. When a person feels himself to have attained a particular spiritual level he considers certain matters as forbidden to him though they may formerly have been perfectly permissible, and though they may still be perfectly permissible for others not on his spiritual level.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ohr_Sameach_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Torah_Study.1.2.1?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Sameach</a> writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ונראה לי לבאר דבאמת כל המצוות המה שווים לפחות שבפחותים, ולמשה רבינו ע\"ה. דתורה אחת יהיה לכם כתיב,</strong> וחיוב המצוה גבול יש לה כמו נטילת אתרוג בנינוע בעלמא יצא. רק המדקדקים נושאין אותו כל היום וכיו\"ב ולכך לא כתבה התורה מדות רק ברמז, דלמשל מדת הנקמה, כל ת\"ח שאינו נוקם ונוטר, ומלך שמחל כו' ולכך אין זה חוק בפרט, שווה לכלל הישראלי, רק כל אחד לפי ערכו, רק נקימה דממון זה שווה לכולם, וכן בגאוה וכי\"ב וכן לפנים משורת הדין ובקור חולים וקבורה וכו' והדברים ארוכים בספרי המחקר. ונמצא מצוות ת\"ת אשר בוודאי אם יבקש האדם טרף ומזון, בכ\"ז אינו נחשב למפריע מצוות ת\"ת ואספת דגנך כתיב, וכן למשל אדם חלוש המזג, וכן כל אחד לפי ההכרחיות שלפי הרגלו, וכן לפי טוהר נפשו של אדם, כי אינו דומה בחיוב ת\"ת האיש אשר נפשו מרגשת בשכלה הזך ונקשרה בעבותות אהבה לתלמוד תורה, לאיש אשר כוחות נפשו נרפים ועצלים, לכן איך היה מחוק הבורא לחוק חיוב ת\"ת לכל ישראל ונתן תורת כ\"א בידו, ואין לאל יד האנושי ליתן המדה האמיתית לזה, לכן באו חכמים ופירשו לנו גדר מרכזן האמיתי של ת\"ת, ק\"ש בשחרית, ק\"ש בערבית קיים והגית בה יומם ולילה, כיון שלומד קבלת המצווה ואזהרתה בשחרית ובערבית, כבר קיים מצוותה, אולם יתר מזה, הוא בכללי המצוות אשר נבדלו ונפרדו בזה, כל איש לפי ערכו ומהותו והיא כמו הסר מן המדות המגונות אשר נפרדו זה מזה, ובוודאי צריך להתעצם בה האדם בכל יכלתו, כי כפלה התורה הרבה פעמים ענין למודה, וצריך האדם להלהיב נפשו לשקוד על דלתותיה כאשר הרבו לדבר בזה הספרים הקדושים, ולכן אמר והזהרת אתהם את החוקים ואת התורות ודבר השווה לכולם והודעת כו' ילכו בה ואת כו' אשר יעשון שבזה אינו שוה רק כל אחד לפי מה שהוא אדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically, all Mitzvos apply equally to everyone.

Our job therefore, is to match this intensity like for like, by becoming <em>unreasonably good.</em> Going beyond the letter of the law. This is going <em>above</em> reason, rather than below reason.</p>\n<h4><strong>Definitions for loving Hashem</strong></h4>\n<ul>\n<li>With all (i.e. both) of your hearts = with your good inclination and with your evil inclination</li>\n<li>With all your soul = with your whole life, including giving it up literally if necessary <em>ch'v</em></li>\n<li>With all your extreme = with the power you have to be unreasonably loving</li>\n</ul>\n<h4><strong>What is unreasonable loving?</strong></h4>\n<p>Even loving with all of one's life, i.e <em>mesirat nefesh</em>,. involves a rational decision. When a person decides to give his life to something, or decides to give up his life <em>ch'v</em>, it can be because of rational reasons. Something being worth giving one's entire will and soul to, or something <em>ch'v</em> one cannot live without.</p>\n<p>Loving with one's extreme (<em>me'od</em> means \"a lot\"; a <em>step up</em> from the \"normal\") isn't to do with reason. The Jew is so connected to Hashem that there's no rational thought involved, or reason or rational motivation. As the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/6008/jewish/Hayom-Yom-Kislev-18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alter Rebbe said</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I want nothing at all! I don't want Your gan eden, I don't want Your olam haba... I want nothing but You alone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is called going \"above reason\", which is what is needed to match the <em>tumah</em> of irrational evil. This perfect, <em>beyond reason</em> closeness produces love and loyalty and a sincere desire to do what He wants for His sake, and His honour, and His pleasure alone, rather for the sake of the reward, or any other \"sphere of intellect\" matter.</p>\n<h4><strong>Why is unreasonable loving left out of the second paragraph?</strong></h4>\n<p><strong>This level of loving is available to a <em>tzaddik</em>, which the first paragraph is talking about.</strong> Specifically, the highest level of Tzaddik, referred to as a Ben Aliya in Ch. 10 of Tanya i.e. a Tzaddik whose driving force is <em>tzorech Gvoha</em>, i.e. doing it purely because Hashem needs this from him, and not selfishly.</p>\n<p><strong>The second paragraph is referring to everyone else, and thus only requires loving Hashem with our <em>yeitzers</em> and <em>b'mesirat nefesh</em>.</strong></p>\n<hr />\n<hr />\n<h3><strong>Is that the end of the story?</strong></h3>\n<p>No, and it's important to not leave the lesson unfinished.</p>\n<p>The Frierdiker Rebbe writes (and the Rebbe in other places) that that used to be true, but today because of the <em>galut</em>, everyone needs to serve Hashem <em>b'chol me'odecha</em>, because <em>we can't do the others!</em> We just can't get our yeitzer hara to be good, and we don't want to give up our lives...</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/YGFutGJXmHg?t=914\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Manis Friedman gives a way of looking at it</a>. Once upon a time, we had many reasons to do mitzvot. If we were in the land, the open miracles and neviim, the tangible holiness that they brought, the tangible fear and love of Hashem... The further back we go in history, the more reasons we have. Even in the previous generations, the close-knit Jewish community gave plenty of good reason to be holy.</p>\n<p>So, once upon a time, if you could find an opportunity to do a <em>mitzva</em> without an ulterior motive, you were a <em>tzaddik</em>. Nowadays, where we are at our lowest according to the Rebbe, why <em>else</em> would we do a mitzva?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The take away that I get from this is that <strong>nowadays we can find it in ourselves, if we look (and cultivate), the desire to do the <em>mitzvot</em> purely because it is necessary <em>to Him</em> that we do it, and <em>He</em> is important enough to us.</strong> This love is also meant for each other as well, and it is <em>me'od</em> and causes us to find others' flaws as tolerable as our own.</p>\n<p>In so doing, we will invoke a love for us from Him, which will see past all our flaws* and thus usher in that great and happy day we all pray for every day, may it come speedly.</p>\n<p><sup>* see Derech Mitzvotecha Issur Sinat Yisrael, Mitzvat Ahavat Yisrael </sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>See Rabbi Shimʕon Ben Yoħai’s opinion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Brachot%2035bph\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bᵊrakhoth 35b</a>.

Such a person obviously has some attachment to his belongings; therefore, HASHEM rewards him for what he <em>does</em> do, with extra possessions.<br />\nHowever—according to this interpretation of Rashbi’s reasoning—one who serves HASHEM with both his person and his possessions, as enumerated in the first paragraph of Shema, is rewarded in some other manner; one that doesn’t necessitate his working a field, and which allows him to continue studying Torah constantly.</p>\n\n\n",

While by a gazlan who robs someone's field, there's no hava amina that the land would in some way be his (since surely the rightful owner will not have given over his rights to the gazlan), by the sikrikon we could have thought that since the field's original owner did in some way give over the land - nevertheless, like the Bartenura goes on and explains (ibid):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואע״ג דיהיב ליה לפי שעה לא מחיל ליה דסבר האידנא לשקול ולמחר תבענא ליה בדינא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And even though he (the landowner) gives it to him (the sikrikon) for now, he doesn't relinquish his ownership since he thinks that while today he (the sikrikon) takes the field, tomorrow I'll sue him in beis din.</p>\n\n\n",

God says doing idol worship is worshipping gods that did not bring them out of Egypt nor did they have covenant with this foreign god.</p>\n<p>But this covenant was not applicable with the non proselyte foreigners.</p>\n<p>So could this be applicable for non proselyte gentiles residing in Israel for temporary or permanent basis.</p>\n<p>Also if we see the Scripture Deuteronomy 13:12-17 below :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you hear it said about one of the towns the Lord your God is giving\nyou to live in 13 that troublemakers(W) have arisen among you and have\nled the people of their town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship\nother gods” (gods you have not known), 14 then you must inquire, probe\nand investigate it thoroughly.(X) And if it is true and it has been\nproved that this detestable thing has been done among you,(Y) 15 you\nmust certainly put to the sword all who live in that town.

Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger,(AE) will\nshow you mercy,(AF) and will have compassion(AG) on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above Scriptures says the entire town was to be burnt if trouble makers (meaning a group of people) we're doing idol worship in the land. No one was to be spared. So, that here looks like even if it were non proselyte Israelites who stayed there for temporary or permanent basis were to follow this law but again God speaks of violation of covenant which was not applicable for non proselyte foreigners.</p>\n<p>Also, if you see the below two Scriptures these both are covenant based laws but it seems to apply to anyone who resided on Israel for temporary or permanent basis:</p>\n<p>Exodus 31:15</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Six days shall work be done, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of\nsolemn rest, holy to the Lord.

Some commands look like it's for covenant people only meaning for Israelites only but if a non Proselyte was staying in the land they were to abide by the law, however, if they left the land, they did not have to, unlike The Israelites who were to keep these laws whether in covenant land or anywhere else.</p>\n<p>Thanks & Much Regards</p>\n<p>PS: you can also refer to this thread for more insight on the question:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/130166/which-mosaic-laws-did-nehan-foreigners-immigrants-that-were-not-proselytes-had\">Which Mosaic laws did Nehan foreigners (immigrants that were not proselytes) had to follow while staying in Israel (long or short term)</a></p>\n<p>I would like to add: if you feel uncomfortable with the radicalness of those verses, please don't reply.

I say this as an introduction that you might need to find an expert in \"Noahide\" laws - those laws that apply to non-Jews.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless the verse you quoted:</p>\n<p>in Leviticus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any Israelite or any foreigner residing in Israel</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ironically this verse implies that if a foreigner is not included explicitly in the command then it does not apply to them. If a verse saying \"any man\" applied to non-Jews or those in Israel, why did this verse require them explicitly mentioned. The reason is that in general non-Jews are not included whether they are or are not in Israel unless mentioned or included.</p>\n<p>Though that rule is not always straightforward due to how Torah law works because sometimes when it say  (man man) איש איש, it comes to include a non Jew as well (חגיגה). This is because it repeats the word man.</p>\n<p>Also Rambam Kings for a few laws about non-Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַל שִׁשָּׁה דְּבָרִים נִצְטַוָּה אָדָם הָרִאשׁוֹן. עַל עֲבוֹדָה\nזָרָה. וְעַל בִּרְכַּת הַשֵּׁם. וְעַל שְׁפִיכוּת דָּמִים. וְעַל\nגִּלּוּי עֲרָיוֹת. וְעַל הַגֵּזֶל. וְעַל הַדִּינִים. אַף עַל פִּי\nשֶׁכֻּלָּן הֵן קַבָּלָה בְּיָדֵינוּ מִמּשֶׁה רַבֵּנוּ. וְהַדַּעַת\nנוֹטָה לָהֶן. מִכְּלַל דִּבְרֵי תּוֹרָה יֵרָאֶה שֶׁעַל אֵלּוּ\nנִצְטַוָּה. הוֹסִיף לְנֹחַ אֵבֶר מִן הַחַי שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (בראשית ט, ד)\n\"אַךְ בָּשָׂר בְּנַפְשׁוֹ דָמוֹ לֹא תֹאכֵלוּ\". נִמְצְאוּ שֶׁבַע\nמִצְוֹת</p>\n<p>six commandments were given to the Adam (first man): 1) idolatry,\n2) cursing G-d, 3) murder, 4)\nillicit sexual relations, 5) thievery and, 6) establishing a system of\njustice. Even though all of these have been received as a Tradition\nfrom Moses our Teacher and we logically lean towards them,\nnevertheless, from the Torah we see\nthat they were commanded. Noah had a seventh commandment forbidding the eating\nof a limb torn from a live animal, as it says,\n“Even flesh, life is in the blood, do not eat of it” (Genesis 9:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also a גר (sojourner - like what you quoted in Leviticus) mentioned in a verse, might be a גר תושב, someone who explicitly accepts all 7 laws of Noah - see שולחן ערוך יורה דעה קכד ב. I believe this is understood to be in front of a Jewish court of 3 men. So those verses do not necessarily apply to any non-Jew who happens to travel or stay in Israel - actually a specific non-Jew.</p>\n<p>Perhaps see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_toshav\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ger_toshav</a> for more information</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'll summarize my conclusions from all of above verses and if anyone feels my conclusions are not Scripturally well divided, please let me know.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>God covenanted people of Israel but even the land Canaan became Holy & Covenanted with God when He had it purged from its heinous crimes of sacrificing babies to Molech etc. So the land itself was covenanted along with the people whom covenanted to Himself</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Leviticus 18:28</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And if you defile the land, it will vomit you out as it vomited out\nthe nations that were before you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>God asked children of Israel to clear the land of any idols, images & graven images and from high places.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Numbers 33:52</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>you must drive out before you all the inhabitants of the land, destroy\nall their carved images and cast idols, and demolish all their high\nplaces.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leviticus 26:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not make idols or set up an image or a sacred stone for yourselves,\nand do not place a carved stone in <strong>your</strong> <strong>land</strong> to bow down\nbefore it. I am the LORD your God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above two verse makes clear that God was clearing the lands of these things and then second they were not to make any idols, graven images, images, high places in any public places in the land (an Israelite could not make & worship images & idols even in their own private properties either).</p>\n<p>As seen in the above verses, there were laws God intended for anyone staying in the land - for Israelites and non proselyte sojourners alike, like, the laws that abolished what were an abomination to The Lord and laws that abolished detestable practices in the land. Also just one outward law (unlike inward moral laws) that the non proselyte sojourners were to keep, was the law of keeping Sabbath. And in such laws, God explicitly mentions that the laws were to be kept by Israelites and non proselyte sojourners equally.</p>\n<p>However, forming covenant with God was a matter of heart. God brought Israel out of Egypt, He was their deliverer now and not just their Creator. But the non proselyte sojourner had no such experience with God. God always delivers and gives non stop 24 7 company to non proselytes when He wants them for Himself, then His kindness leads them to repentance and a sanctified life. However unless this personal experience happens for someone they have formed no covenant with The Living God and so God doesn't force a non proselyte to not idol worship.</p>\n<p>That makes me reach the conclusion that a non proselyte sojourner could worship idols in their own homes, even with their other non proselyte friends.</p>\n<p>However, God drew the margin strict by not allowing them to sacrifice to another gods in His land (private or public property)</p>\n<p>Leviticus 17:1-8</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, 2 “Speak to Aaron and his sons\nand to all the people of Israel and say to them, This is the thing\nthat the Lord has commanded. 3 If any one of the house of\nIsrael (A)kills an ox or a lamb or a goat in the camp, or kills it\noutside the camp, 4 and (B)does not bring it to the entrance of the\ntent of meeting to offer it as a gift to the Lord in front of the\ntabernacle of the Lord, bloodguilt shall be imputed to that man. He\nhas shed blood, and that man (C)shall be cut off from among his\npeople. 5 This is to the end that the people of Israel may bring their\nsacrifices that they sacrifice (D)in the open field, that they may\nbring them to the Lord, to the priest at the entrance of the tent of\nmeeting, and sacrifice them (E)as sacrifices of peace offerings to\nthe Lord. 6 And the priest shall (F)throw the blood on the altar of\nthe Lord at the entrance of the tent of meeting and burn the\nfat (G)for a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 7 So they shall no more\nsacrifice their sacrifices to goat demons, after whom they (H)whore.\nThis shall be a statute forever for them throughout their generations.</p>\n<p>8 “And you shall say to them, Any one of the house of Israel, or of\nthe strangers who sojourn among them, who (I)offers a burnt offering\nor sacrifice 9 and (J)does not bring it to the entrance of the tent of\nmeeting to offer it to the Lord, (K)that man shall be cut off from his\npeople.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the second margin He drew was that if anyone (Israelite Or non proselyte sojourner) lead any Israelite to worship any idol or images or to sacrifice anywhere except for where God appointed sacrifices (which meant it was a sacrifice to other gods, one could not sacrifice to God except in place He ordained), then such a person trespassed.</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 13: 12-17</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you hear it said about one of the towns the Lord your God is giving\nyou to live in 13 that troublemakers(W) have arisen among you and have\nled the people of their town astray, saying, “Let us go and worship\nother gods” (gods you have not known), 14 then you must inquire, probe\nand investigate it thoroughly.(X) And if it is true and it has been\nproved that this detestable thing has been done among you,(Y) 15 you\nmust certainly put to the sword all who live in that town. You must\ndestroy it completely,b both its people and its\nlivestock.(AA) 16 You are to gather all the plunder of the town into\nthe middle of the public square and completely burn the town(AB) and\nall its plunder as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your\nGod.(AC) That town is to remain a ruin(AD) forever, never to be\nrebuilt, 17 and none of the condemned things[c] are to be found in\nyour hands. Then the Lord will turn from his fierce anger,(AE) will\nshow you mercy,(AF) and will have compassion(AG) on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Deuteronomy 17:2-7</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a man or woman living among you in one of the towns the Lord gives\nyou is found doing evil in the eyes of the Lord your God in violation\nof his covenant,(D) 3 and contrary to my command(E) has worshiped\nother gods,(F) bowing down to them or to the sun(G) or the moon or the\nstars in the sky,(H) 4 and this has been brought to your attention,\nthen you must investigate it thoroughly. If it is true(I) and it has\nbeen proved that this detestable thing has been done in\nIsrael,(J) 5 take the man or woman who has done this evil deed to your\ncity gate and stone that person to death.(K) 6 On the testimony of two\nor three witnesses a person is to be put to death, but no one is to be\nput to death on the testimony of only one witness.(L) 7 The hands of\nthe witnesses must be the first in putting that person to\ndeath,(M) and then the hands of all the people.(N) You must purge the\nevil(O) from among you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the third margin being - which was equal for a proselyte sojourner and an Israelite was that they could not build idols, images, graven images in public places as pointed above with Scripture reference. Additionally, covenanted people, Israelites could not worship idols, images even in their private property while the sojourner non proselyte could worship idols and images in their own private property.</p>\n<p>So a non proselyte sojourner too could not sacrifice to any gods in the land except to God of Israel and in the place He chooses for sacrifice. Non proselytes too could not insult God.Non proselytes too had to keep the Sabbath to give the land rest. Non proselytes too could not lure an Israelites to worship or sacrifice to other gods. There were few laws which were not covenant based but were abomination and detestable to Lord God and He banned even the non proselytes from doing those things in the land. However, a non proselyte sojourner could worship to their idols in their homes except they could not sacrifice to their gods in the land (public or private property land) and they could not build images, idols, graven images in public property, however, they could in their own private property but again they could nit sacrifice to their gods even in their own private property.</p>\n<p>These are the conclusions I have reached with all the verses above.</p>\n<p>Please correct me if and where i am wrong. Adding Scriptural references will really be helpful.</p>\n<p>Thankyou.</p>\n\n\n",

To eat a limb torn from a live animal is unspeakably cruel.</p>\n<p>There are numerous diagnosis tools for any medical condition, all partially specific and reliable. Most of the time several tests are used and it is their consistency of results which help to approach a final diagnosis. In some areas of medicine, cancers for example, doctors focus heavily -close to blackmailing- on biopsies of living tissues of the body -in ambulatory, pre-op care- as a gate opener to treatment, surgery and other. I am not thinking of biopsies carried out during an operation on the sick organ being removed.\nWould I be justified on moral ground (conscience objection) based on Torah, to reject any detachment of a piece of limb like a biopsy, and claim my right to diagnosis and treatment, and even pushing carers to search for more relevant non-invasive tools of disease management indirectly ?<br />\nAnybody has a halachic knowledge of this situation, and anybody has the practical experience of doing that ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Genesis 9:4 called \"Eiver min Hachai\" is only prohibited for eating, but I understand that one can enjoy benefit from this limb see: תלמוד בבלי, מסכת פסחים, דף כ\"ב, עמוד ב.</p>\n<p>The idea of the law according to the Sefer HaChinuch is that it is too cruel to remove a limb from a live animal and eat it. Though I suppose removing a limb for another purpose while the animal is alive might similarly be cruel it is not technically prohibited under this Mitzvah as far as I understand.</p>\n<p>There is a prohibition to not cause distress to an animal (צר בעלי חיים). Presumably this would apply to humans. If they are doing it for your medical care that would require a lot more thought, since they are trying to help. Although they should be determining a balance of the least painful and most effective procedure. Perhaps you can try another question, about medical ethics in Judaism about how to balance pain and damages with whether they are necessary for treatment?</p>\n\n\n",

The first clause: \"You shall strike the inhabitants of that city with the sword\" does not state that ALL of the inhabitants should be killed. Thus our mesorah teaches the system by means of which we separate out the transgressors from the righteous and subject them to sentencing. The second clause: \"destroying it utterly, and all that is therein and the cattle thereof, by the sword\" refers to the city itself and its property. That is entirely eliminated, and not even the property of the sadiqim (righteous) escape this fate as you note.</p>\n<p>To add to that, there is an explicit Tannaitic source for differentiating between the wicked and the righteous of the 'Ir ha-Nidahath.

When it says to use the last letter of your name, is that the last letter of your last name or of your first name? Also is it our Aliyah name that we base it off of?</p>\n<p>TLDR: my name is יעקב. Do I use yud and bet for my pasuk, or since I’m יעקב בן שמואל do I use yud and lamed. Or since my last name in Hebrew ends with a tzaddik, do I used yud and tzaddik?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You definitely use only the first and last letters of your <em>given name</em>, no father's name and no last name. In some siddurim you can see explicitly that they list pesukim for each given name; some have the name in the pasuk, but other pesukim just begin/end with the first and last letters of the name.</p>\n<p>As for what to do if you have two names, there are different opinions. My father was taught to only say one pasuk for the first name, but, for example, the \"Siddur Bais Aharon V'Yisrael,\" which includes the minhagim of the Stolin community, says to say two (or more) pesukim, one for each given name.</p>\n\n\n",

He only mentions LH in the 3rd case (PUBLIC defamation w/o the person present) and doesn't bring a passuk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה אם יזכיר אדם לחבירו <strong>בינו לבין עצמו</strong> מעשה אבותיו הרעים. הנה הוא עובר על מה שכתוב בתורה (<a href=\"/Leviticus.25.17\">ויקרא כ״ה:י״ז</a>) לא תונו איש את עמיתו. באונאת דברים דבר הכתוב כמו שהקדמנו. ונאמר (יחזקאל י״ח:כ׳) בן לא ישא בעון האב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For further context in ST211 re: מוציא שם רע he (seems to) bring a passuk (לא תשא שמע שוא), and in ST222 re: Rechilus brings the passuk לא תלך רכיל בעמך.

He uses it as an umbrella term for separate aveiros with their own pesukim, where as we tend to use it for what he calls \"rechilus\": spreading gossip about people. So the \"lomdus\" is the same, but the difference is in terminology.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The third gate of Sha'arei Teshuva begins with a list of mitzvot by order of severity, and ends with a description of the four groups that don't receive the divine presence. The first part is very much anchored in verses from the Torah, while the last part doesn't carefully cite its sources in the Torah and has an aggadic source. He compares scoffers, liars, flatterers and slanderers, which are not exactly names used by the Torah to denote specific prohibitions; instead he makes conceptual distinctions not tied to specific verses. So for sources in the Torah we should rather look in the first part of the third gate, where we do in fact find them.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=R._Yonah_Shaarei_Teshuvah_3:55\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:55</a> Rabbeinu Yona specifically says that מוציא שם רע is included in the prohibition of rechilut (לא תלך רכיל). What he means by this is that the prohibition of לא תלך רכיל includes lashon hara, which I demonstrate as follows: In <a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=R._Yonah_Shaarei_Teshuvah_3:111\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:111</a> Rabbeinu Yona uses the term מוציא שם רע to refer to speaking evil of someone (as a synonym of מוציא דיבה), not necessarily something false. Similarly in <a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=R._Yonah_Shaarei_Teshuvah_3:211\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:211</a> when speaking of slandering someone falsely, he <em>doesn't</em> use the term מוציא שם רע. So clearly he isn't using the terminology of the Rambam (<a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=Rambam_Hilkhot_Deiot_7:2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">De'ot 7:2</a>) who uses מוציא שם רע specifically to mean falsely slandering someone; instead he uses this term to refer to any negative speech, whether true or false. And so, although he uses a different terminology than the Rambam, he agrees with him in substance that the prohibition of lashon hara derives from that of rechilut.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://library.alhatorah.org/?r1=R._Yonah_Shaarei_Teshuvah_3:214\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">3:214</a> Rabbeinu Yona distinguishes three types of (true) lashon hara: (1) speaking bad of a person in private; (2) speaking bad of a person in his presence and the presence of others; and (3) speaking bad of a person not in his presence. The first is explicitly labeled ona'at devarim, the others are not. According to the Chafetz Chayyim (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14233&st=&pgnum=26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">lavin 13</a>), 2 is ona'at devarim (specifically on the authority of Rabbeinu Yona here) and 3 is not (not based on any named authority).</p>\n<p>The source for the prohibition of case 3 (speaking bad of a person not in his presence) is ambiguous in most places and could be interpreted either way.<sup>1</sup> However, the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49924&pgnum=195\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aliyyot</a> quoted in the question (when considered in context) appears to clearly demonstrate that he considers case 3 to be a violation of ona'at devarim. Since I can think of no other way to explain this,<sup>2</sup> I have to posit that he holds speaking bad of a person not in his presence is a violation of the Torah prohibition of ona'at devarim as well as rechilut.<sup>3</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <sub>Ona'a is discussed at 3:24 and 3:49, where he doesn't specifically state whether it applies when the person spoken of isn't present. 3:219 (218 in some editions) is type 2 and therefore not a proof to type 3. Indeed he very likely is permitting speaking specifically in the person's presence (type 2), because as explained in 3:228, by speaking bad of someone in public, even when permitted, people are going to think you're doing something wrong by not rebuking the person to his face.</sub></p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <sub><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/130432/1569\">Your suggestion</a> that ona'at devarim provides the <em>definition</em> of what lashon hara is, but isn't the same prohibition, doesn't seem to me to be correct. This isn't what the Netivot Chayyim (lavin n. 42) you're relying on says. He suggests (against the Chafetz Chayyim) that maybe lashon hara and ona'at devarim don't overlap, i.e. if it's one then it's automatically not the other. He doesn't say that ona'at devarim provides the definition of lashon hara, because why should it? There is no reason at all to say that as a random rule, <em>unless</em> ona'at devarim is in fact a source of the prohibition of lashon hara, as I'm suggesting.</sub></p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <sub>This idea actually contradicts the Chafetz Chayyim's opinion (mentioned above, not specifically attributed to Rabbeinu Yona) that ona'at devarim only applies in the person's presence. The critical words (שאסור מן התורה לספר במעשים הראשונים שעושה חברו, כדתניא לא תונו איש את עמיתו...‏) are from the first complete edition of the work, which was printed recently, and don't appear in the version the Chafetz Chayyim had access to (from Shitta Mekubbetzet, which he reprinted in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14233&pgnum=250\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his book</a>). So although Rabbeinu Yona's view was ambiguous at the time, it no longer seems to be.</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I saw in the נתיבות חיים sefer on Chofetz Chaim (re: לאוין יג) that he says that something which is אונאת דברים when said privately is LH when said to others.  With this, I'm thinking that RY started the section talking about LH with אונאת דברים for this very reason - as you need to understand this connection to אונאת דברים.  As such in ST219  and עליות דר\"י when explaining why it's permitted to speak PUBLICLY about a פורק עול מלכות שמים b/c they are excluded from אונאת דברים - b/c LH is an extension of it - no אונאת דברים no LH.  However, RY goes further and in ST216 says that there are actually 2 components of LH - the harm, pain, etc caused (that he had discussed, i.e. אונאת דברים component) but also a separate component for simply choosing to find flaws in others (which would seem to apply - as the CC understands it - even if not harm, etc is caused).  As such, it would seem that this is not derived from אונאת דברים.  Although he quotes a passuk in Mishlei אוילים יליץ אשם- I doubt that it is his source.  So I've shifted the Q from אונאת דברים to מליץ אשם</p>\n\n\n",

There, the Maharal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Devarim.3.23.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh</a> explains the following to answer how Moshe could enter the land of Gad :</p>\n<p>ומה שבא משה אל ארץ סיחון ועוג, אף על גב שגם היא בכלל הארץ אשר נתן הקדוש ברוך הוא לאברהם, היינו טעמא, שעדיין לא שאלו בני ראובן ובני גד הארץ לחלקם, ואם לא [היו] מבקשים את ארץ סיחון ועוג – לא היו יורשים בני ישראל הארץ, כמו שכתב הרמב\"ן בפרשת חקת (במדבר כא, כא), וכן הארכנו בפרשת מטות (במדבר פל\"ב אות יב), עיין שם, אלא היתה הארץ נשארת חריבה מאין יושב, והיו מניחין אותה כך, והולכין להם. לכך לא יקרא בזה \"לא תביאו את הקהל אל הארץ אשר נשבעתי לאבותם\" (ר' במדבר כ, יב), כיון שלא היה כבוש הראשון לנחול הארץ ולישב בה</p>\n<p>He explains that since if Gad did not ask for this land, it would not be part of Israel, as he quotes from the Ramban. Hence it was not included when Hashem told Moshe that he would not enter the land promised to his forefathers, as this was not included in that oath, as it would not necessarily become part of Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

Getting physical, before a real relationship has developed, greatly diminishes the odds of such a relationship ever developing.</p>\n<p>Casual sex also cheapens the sex act into something transactional, which in the long run, hinders a person from being able to enter into long term relationships that are not built solely on lustful attraction.</p>\n<p>Therefore, while occasional premarital sex might take care of your immediate sexual urges, for now, nevertheless it’s only a temporary fix.</p>\n<p>You need to look with maturity at the bigger picture, which includes learning life skills, in preparation for married life. One very important life skill; is learning a trade, through which you can provide for yourself and your family. Other life skills include becoming a better person through character development, and learning how to get along with people, in all types of life situations.</p>\n<p>If you work on this, people will notice how you stand out and excel in these areas, which overall, will make you into a more desirable marriage prospect.</p>\n\n\n",

See the Tur in the very end of siman צב (that would be in Yoreh Deah) who quotes the Rosh saying that in a situation with two pots, one meat and the other milk and they are on top of one another, the steam from the bottom pot can become absorbed into the top pot thereby treifing up that pot. There is a machlokes achronim in how to understand this Rosh. The Bach (teshuvos hachdashos siman 21?, maybe 26? check it out for yourself, he talks about this issue as well as basar shnisalem min ha'ayin), holds that the situation is limited to when the pots are in a very concealed area (for instance, that lip of the bottom pot is sealed to the bottom of the top pot), only in this situation will the steam be able to asur the pot. The Trumas Hadeshen (psakim uksavim siman 103) holds that the factor making it asur is not the distance between the two pots, rather it is the tempurature of the steam as it touches the other pot. Both the Bach and the T\"H (Trumas Hadeshen) use these explanations to matir a certain minhag (ע\"ש). Now, that means that the main difference between these two shitos is when the steam is hot but not in a concealed area.</p>\n<p>Now, back to the case in question. Okay. According to the T\"H, the steam coming up from the cup of coffee may be yad soledes bo (very, very hot, hide your babies, ע\"ש) and therefore the dairy-ness goes into the spout (and if you say that the steam is not hot enough at that point, if the spout is hot enough it also asurs it according to many poskim, see R' Akiva eiger on shulchan aruch, the pri megadim there, the beis yosef, the Toras Chatas and the levush) once someone else uses the pot for their meaty soup mix, the flavor may go into the soup from the pot. However, according to the Bach, the pashtus is that any area where you would be making this coffee would be too open of an area. okay.\nHowever, see the aruch hashulchan in (Y\"D 92:55-56) who asks an amazing question on the T\"H, which is that the Rosh himself in the teshuva says that if the upper pot is full of hot water then it would be too hot to accept to bliyos (absorbtions) and the upper pot would remain mutar, yet that is davka where the T\"H asurs! And you should really see the T\"H inside because he admits on his own that he didn't have this Rosh, he only knew about it from the question, and this makes the Aruch Hashulchan's question quite a bit stronger. Not to mention that the Bach himself says that we should be machmir for the T\"H, ע\"ש!!!</p>\n<p>But we're not done yet, not by a longshot, okay. Because, as i mentioned (albeit in not the clearest way) many many very choshuv poskim hold like this T\"H. TBH i don't know what to do with that information. See the Chidushei Hagahos on the Beis Yosef הנ\"ל.</p>\n<p>Another tzad lehakel could be that the kli containing this hot water may not be a kli rishon even if there is a heating element inside. I once asked a very prominent Rosh Yeshiva in E\"Y about this and he answered based off the rather famous Tos' in shabbos (40b) that if the walls of the pot are not the medium through which the water is being heated then it is not a kli rishon but rather a kli sheini (the water might still be kli rishon water given that the heating element is directly heating it - as is the case in public hot water urns which are expected to keep a lot of water hot for a long time and to quickly heat up incoming water, but the walls which are being heated by the water may only have the status of a kli sheini) and kli sheini does not take in bliyos (absorbtions).</p>\n<p>However, this may be difficult to rely on lechatchila given that the mechaber/rama in siman 104(?) say that we are noheg to be choshesh for bliyos even in a kli sheini lechatchilah. Furthermore, this chidush of the Rosh Yeshiva seems to be contradicted lehedya in shulchan aruch, who pasken that a kli that was left inside kli rishon water attains that status of a kli rishon (nafka minah, serving soup with a metal ladel, ודו\"ק), while we says just now that it does not attain such a status. Now, I asked this exact question to this Rosh Yeshiva and he responded al regel achas that you could be mechalek, okay, because in the case of the ladel, the kli is fully submerged in the hot water, whereas the walls of this urn are not fully submerged but only touch the water on one side. (discuss the svara for this amongst yourselves. okay.)</p>\n<p>Another potential issue to worry about in terms of the transfer of ta'am (flavor) into the upper pot would be nitzok, now, that means a stream of flowing liquid connecting two bodies of liquid. Although, so far as I have seen, pretty much every major posek in yoreh de'ah says that if the upper source is hot then it cannot recieve ta'am from the lower source. I apologize but I forget which siman these poskim can be found in.</p>\n<p>Assuming that flavor could in fact become absorbed, like the majority of poskim would seem to say, and assuming that both meat and milk flavor could get in there, there would probably be no more that an issur derabanan of bishul basar bechalav (it would be derabanan if anything at all because it's not derech bishul, see the Pri megadim's hakdama to hilchos basar bechalav right before siman 87).</p>\n<p>Regarding whether the flavor would ever become pagum (nasty, and therby having no negative ramifications in kashrus, ואכמ\"ל), I recall seing a Shach who says that if the ta'am is ta'am heter, then even if there is a heat source reapplied to the ta'am within 24 hours it will still become pagum, okay, whereas if it is ta'am isur (like basar b'chalav) then it would continue to be good (dehaynu, not disgusting. it's still asur though) flavor until 24 hours pass without any reawakening of the flavor through heat.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ribiat has a little on this topic in Migdal Dovid footnotes 320 and onwards for a bit in meleches bishul, ע\"ש and in the english part of the sefer where he is extremely machmir.</p>\n<p>However, given the Aruch Hashulchan's kashya on the T\"H, it would seem to be a pliyah atzumah (great flabergastation) to be machmir to such an extent. I've asked a number of very prominent Rabbanim and poskim in E\"Y who all have an unbelievable mesorah in psak and they were all matir lechatchila (one told me in his characteristic way \"there's no such thing as ze'ah (steam)!\". Another told me in his own very characteristic way \"Now, there's no ze'ah unless it's in a very enclosed space like an oven. Whoever told you that [there is a reason to be concerned for an isur] doesn't know the aleph beis of Yoreh Deah!\")</p>\n<p>Now, the Torah is not as pashut as people want to think it is, okay.\nSof kol sof, I hope this was helpful, but you should still ask your local orthodox Rabbi, assuming he knows his aleph beis.</p>\n\n\n",

Our sages learn that in Vayikra Perek 19 the pasuk says אִ֣ישׁ אִמּ֤וֹ וְאָבִיו֙ תִּירָ֔אוּ וְאֶת־שַׁבְּתֹתַ֖י תִּשְׁמֹ֑רוּ. This poses the question why are Shabbat and respecting your parents in the same pasuk? The answer is that if you’re parents tell you to go as far as breaking Shabbat (or doing anything assur at that), there is no obligation to listen to them (so basically if they tell you to break Shabbat you are forbidden to even though they’re your parents). So kal v’chomer if your parent is a murderer or a child molester there is certainly no prohibition to testifying against them because what they’re doing is assur</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Menashe Klien in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1888&st=&pgnum=164\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishne Halachos 16:58</a> brings from Rav Elyashiv, Rav Waldenberg, and Rav Shlomo Zalman that molesting has a halacha of a rodef.</p>\n<p>Therefore, there is a difference if the action was already done and it just a question of getting punished, or if there is an active suspicion that the act is still ongoing or will continue in the future.</p>\n<p>If the action was done and the issue is simply a punishment, then Beis Din would be the only recourse.</p>\n<p>If there is an active possibility of it continuing then they would be considered a Rodef and it would be permitted for someone to report them to the authorities.

And we only call four people Matriarchs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi's comments are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין קורין אבות – לישראל:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jews only use the term <em><strong>Patriachs</strong></em>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא לשלשה – אברהם יצחק ויעקב לאפוקי שבטים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>in regard to three, <strong>Avraham, Yitzchok and Yaacov</strong>, <em>as it relates to the development of the tribes (of Israel)</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלא לארבע – שרה רבקה רחל ולאה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>And Jews only use the term <strong>Matriarchs</strong></em> in regard to four, <strong>Sarah Rivkah, Rachel and Leah</strong>.</p>\n<p>Concerning the deeper meaning behind the names of the Matriarchs, both their names and those of the Patriarchs pertain to one of the inner intentions of reciting the Shema and the second paragraph (ואהבת גו׳) of the Shema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.5-9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:5-9</a>).</p>\n<p>That the opening lines of the Shema (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.6.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 6:4</a>) teach us that G-d, who transcends both time and space (the name represented by יהוה), is for the Jewish people also the G-d of the entire natural universe (the name represented by אלהים).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל יְהֹוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יְהֹוָ֥ה ׀ אֶחָֽד׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the primary teachings we received from the Patriarchs and the Matriarchs.</p>\n<p>That the format of this paragraph is traditionally arranged as 7 rows of 6 words each, for a total of 42 words. This alludes to the 42 letter name of G-d which indicates and delineates the various stages of ascent in the daily prayer service. The small sum gematria of the names of the Matriarchs (שרה, רבקה, לאה, רחל) is also 42. (For a more detailed discussion of the 42 letter name, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pardes_Rimmonim.21.12.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pardes Rimonim by Rabbi Moshe Kordevero, beginning at Gate 21:12:1</a>.)</p>\n<p>This 42 letter name is traditionally formatted in 7 rows of 6 letters each, with the 6 letters of each row divided into 3 letter roots (<em>an allusion to the 3 Patriarchs</em>). This forms 2 columns from the entire 42 letter name, alluding to the Matriarchs and the Patriarchs, who together are the root of the one nation, Israel (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.7.23?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Shmuel 7:23</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37:22</a>).</p>\n<p>When combining the small sum gematria of the Patriarchs (אברהם,יצחק יעקב), which is 44, with that of the Matriarchs (42), the complete sum is 86 which is the gematria of the name אלהים.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Make a neder to forbid from oneself reward in the World to Come\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I always understood that a <em>neder</em> is forbidding physical pleasure or benefit from oneself. I believe this is the common understanding. However, I saw a surprising statement of the Maharal in his Tiferes Yisroel Chapter 6.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאמרו במקומות הרבה 'מצות התורה לאו ליהנות נתנו', אלא בשביל גזירות נתנו...והטעם בכולם, מפני שמצות התורה לא נתנו ליהנות, רק לעול על האדם. ואל תאמר כי פירוש 'לאו ליהנות' בעולם הזה, רק לטוב לנו לעולם הבא. דאם היה תחלת נתינת המצוה לישראל להטיב להם בעולם הבא, אם כן מצות ליהנות נתנו.</p>\n<p>They said in many places '<em>mitzvos</em> were not given for pleasure/benefit'. Rather, they were given as decrees...the reason for all these instances is because the Torah wasn't given for pleasure, rather just as a yoke on a person. And don't tell me that 'not for pleasure/benefit' is meant for in <em>this</em> world, but [the Torah] was given for good in the next world. For if the whole point of giving the <em>mitzvos</em> to the Jews was for their benefit in the World to Come, then <em>mitzvos</em> <em><strong>were</strong></em> given for pleasure/benefit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I understood his words properly, he's saying that had the purpose of the Torah and <em>mitzvos</em> been to give us reward in the World to Come, that would be called הנאה, pleasure/benefit. If so, I would infer that a <em>neder</em> would be effective.</p>\n<p>Consequently, I'm wondering if the natural consequence of this would be (according to him), that one could make a <em>neder</em>, forbidding oneself from benefitting from the reward in the World to Come? Is this is a correct conclusion? Does anyone discuss this possibility (with or without mentioning the Maharal). I do admit I'm not sure how this would play out practically.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>In case someone wants to say the reward is לא בא לעולם, I would respond that according to the Nefesh HaChaim 1:12, the reward one creates with their <em>mitzvos</em> <em>is</em> בעולם, but we just don't have access to it yet.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Four witnesses on ketubah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>So my fiancé and I trying to have a more feminist orthodox wedding, and one thing we’ve heard is that (among other things) we can be more inclusive on the ketubah by having 2 halachic male signatures below the Aramaic and two additional female witness signatures below the English “translation”. However, when we asked a friend, she asked her rabbi (who is on the more yeshivish side) if this was okay for her to do, and he said any additional signatures beyond the main 2 would invalidate the whole ketubah. I was curious about this especially since even in modern orthodox circles it’s becoming customary for brides, grooms, and rabbis to sign the ketubah in addition to the two halachic witnesses.\nIs there any difference between bride/groom signatures and those of additional witnesses?

If you arrive late but there are two whole loaves (loaf is defined as one complete bread, a pita, a roti, a challah, etc) then this is the ideal and you must use those.</p>\n<p>If you come to a dinner and the bread has already been broken then you can rely on the following. You <em><strong>must</strong></em> make hammotzi on two pieces of bread that are intact from the moment you happen upon them <em>if</em> there are two pieces when you arrive. So if two challot have had some slices taken off of them by the time you arrive, but you didn't slice anything off of them, then you can use those two challot for hammotzi. You may even use two slices of bread as long as they were sliced by someone else before you arrived. You may also make hammotzi on one piece of bread if it's the only bread left when you arrive.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A deficiency in the completeness of the loaf of more than 1/48 will\ndisqualify the loaf for use as lechem mishna. <strong>In the event that one\ndoes not have two complete loaves then even any two pieces of bread\nwill suffice in an emergency.[7] In fact, it is said that Rav Itchele\nof Volozhin would provide guests who arrived late to his Shabbat meal\nwith two slices of bread to use a lechem mishna.</strong> It is explained that\nsince the latecomer was not present when the original loaf was sliced,\nthe two slices he is now presented with can be deemed as \"whole\" for\nthe purpose of lechem mishna.[8] So too, one who only has one whole\nloaf, may combine a matza, a piece of cake which is whole (i.e. a\nrugelach)[9] or even a frozen loaf from the freezer in order to meet\nthe lechem mishna requirement.[10] In an emergency, a broken loaf may\nbe used for lechem mishna if it can be reattached by means of a\ntoothpick or the like, in order that it at least appears to be\nwhole.[11]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/36245/#_ftn7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://outorah.org/p/36245/#_ftn7</a></p>\n\n\n",

This is possible because a king could be (and there have been many kings who have been) crazy and mad.</p>\n<p>There is also the proof from the survival of the Jewish people and from the nevuah in the Torah. My question on that is that since we were scattered around different countries all over the world from the moment we were exiled (zoranstiran empire) it would be very hard to destroy us even though we were heavily persecuted.</p>\n<p>And finally, the proof from the fact that we returned to Eretz Yisrael and the nevuah that it would happen in Parshas Nitzavim. Here I have less of a formulation of an argument but it could be that after a certain point it would be likely that we would return because we survived everything and suffered so much and the world would feel bad for us or a merciful king would let us return as when Cyrus the Great let us return. In addition to that I have some questions about Galus and the return ; Why did Cryus let us go back and why wouldn't it be a fair possibility that another king would let us return? What prevented us from returning throughout Galus? What prevented nations in general from returning to their homeland countries? Why would nations not be inclined to let us return after all our suffering?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><em>My main question is in the event that the king over israel decides to use the army to implant and force the parents to teach their children the Sinai story etc.</em></p>\n<p>Speculative \"what if\" scenarios like this   can be used to join the conspiracy theorists about everything but to answer this particular question look at how unsuccessful Stalin and his henchmen were at getting the people in the Soviet Union to adopt mass belief in thier version of history (this is about history not communism) to understand  how untenable such a proposal would be.</p>\n<p>Yes, I know that in county X they believe Y because they were told... end of the day  the failure of the Soviet Union to create mass belief in their rewritten national history should give you an idea of how difficult it is to do such a thing by force.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>since we were scattered around different countries all over the world it would be very hard to destroy us even though we were heavily persecuted.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Assuming that we only survived in countries where (1)we weren't persecuted and (2) in those countries there were no strong  assimilist   movements saying that they had proven once and for all that whatever is believed by the intelligentsia  of that county is that absolute truth blah, blah, blah   that would a good question.

Do other dispersed groups ultimately return to where they started from? The world feels bad for us? I  never noticed that one...</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In order for your first argument to work, the king would have to be able to enforce his law over multiple generations, which would be extremely unlikely. It would necessitate multiple generations of kings enforcing this rule.</p>\n<p>In addition, we have a direct tradition covering the period of the Kings. So the king would have also have to have created a false and yet detailed history. There are examples of people creating false histories of themselves and their own achievements, but how many claimed to falsify a nation's entire history? And do so without taking any personal credit? The largest examples of mass brainwashing are the Communist countries, and they all built personality cults around their \"Glorious Leaders,\" something this supposed king did not do.</p>\n<p>To say someone was mad is not enough. Mad people who have lost touch with reality are not effective, and people who are just mad with power still have a method to their madness. Creating a false history and leaving oneself out of it does not fit the MO at all.</p>\n<p>As for your second argument, the point isn't that we physically survived, but that we kept our identity. Many highly successful nations disappeared with no persecution, yet we were repeatedly targeted for genocide, and still survived and practice Judaism to this day.</p>\n<p>The returning in the days of Cyrus had been prophesied by Isaiah (Ch. 45) long before the first Temple was destroyed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In 1 Chronicles 27:25, what is the difference between a storehouse and a treasury?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The same word, אוֹצָר seems to be translated both ways.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.27.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Chronicles 27:25</a>\nAnd over the <strong>treasuries</strong> of the king was Azmaveth the son of Adiel, and over the <strong>storehouses</strong> in the fields, in the cities, in the villages, and in the towers was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Elsewhere it seems to be translated \"store\" and even \"wine cellar.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>It looks like it is just context. אוצר just means storage. In contexts of fields etc. it would refer to grain. In context to a king's storage, it would mean his treasury. So the translator just used the specific English words for each kind of storage, whereas the original relied on context.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As @JoelK said it depends on context.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.27.25?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_I_Chronicles.27.25.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rashi</strong></a> explains the context which helps gives an understanding for the choice of translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל אוצרות המלך. <strong>אוצרות כסף וזהב</strong>, כל זה הולך ומספר לגדולת דוד ואפילו מי שהיה ממונה על האתונות שלו:</p>\n<p>And over the treasuries of the king <strong>the treasuries of silver and gold</strong>. All this he proceeds to relate for David’s greatness, and even the one who was appointed over his she-donkeys.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל האוצרות בשדה. <strong>ועל מה שגדל בשדה, תבואות יין ושמן וכל מיני אוכלין ומשקין</strong></p>\n<p>and over the storehouses in the field <strong>and over what grew in the field: grains, wine, and oil, and all kinds of foods and drinks</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So since the first time is a reference to silver and gold, translating it as treasury makes more sense, whereas the second instance is on the produce of the field and so storehouses is the appropriate translation.</p>\n<p>Similarly, <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.27.25?lang=bi&p2=Radak_on_I_Chronicles.27.25.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a></strong> makes the distinction:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל אצרות המלך. עתה ספר פקידיו וגזבריו על מלאכתו ועל אוצרותיו בבית ובשדה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Is there any benefit to try learning Torah on your own without help, when you can learn Torah through asking others and looking things up (which is a much faster route)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You can work hard and ask others for help.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Once the Alter Rebbe called the\n  Tzemach Tzedek\n  and offered to grant him a gift – a blessing for\n  an understanding of Torah. The\n  Tzemach Tzedek\n  declined the offer, saying that he wanted to\n  acquire Torah through toil. He later regretted\n  this, for whatever levels of Torah he could have\n  received as a gift from the Alter Rebbe, there\n  would always be additional levels to toil for.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>For more information about toiling while learning Torah, see\n<a href=\"http://www.lmaanyishmeu.com/pdf/195%20-%20Toiling%20in%20Torah%20-2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.lmaanyishmeu.com/pdf/195%20-%20Toiling%20in%20Torah%20-2.pdf</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Pirkei avos 5:25,26 </p>\n\n<p>Ben Bag Bag says: \"turn in it, turn in it for everything is in it. Reflect in it, grow old in it, don't turn from it for there is no greater measure than it\".</p>\n\n<p>Ben Hai Hai says: \"according to the toil is the reward\".</p>\n\n<p>You can never learn enough. And the more energy you put in to understanding and exploring torah, the more rewarding the experience will be.</p>\n\n<p>I doubt that these Rabbis encouraged learning only on one's own. That contradicts a main theme of the mesorah, outlined throughout Pirkei Avos. Learn from others when you can (\"Make for yourself a rav\", ibid 1:6, \"Who is wise, one who learns from every man\" 4:1, \"have your house be a place for sages, sit in the dust of their feet drink their words with thirst\" 1:4). Think over what they say, toil in it. When you cant learn from others, learn still and work to understand torah.</p>\n\n<p>Learn however you can, as much as you can is the message, I think.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara in Brachos 6b says \"Agra Dishmita Svara\"- The reward for learning is in \"svara\"=reasoning meaning the greatest type of limud hatorah in schar wise in merit in learning something that is more intellectually challenging.</p>\n\n<p>as for the second half of the question, generally you will get better understanding when learning with a group than by yourself. this is true for most disciplines, secular or religious.</p>\n\n\n",

Why did he apparently deviate from his normal rule of psak?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The source is a zohar in Shir Hashirim Chapter 8. When I looked it up it seemed to me that he wasn't recording normative practice but innovating based on his contemporary the Arizal. That would also explain why so many ashkenazim don't wear tefillin on chol hamoed but litvaks and yekkes who were less influenced by chassidus and hence by the Arizal still do.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>He writes explicitly in the introduction to his Beis Yosef, which the shulchan aruch epitomizes, that he will quote the Zohar in a few instances:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נמצא שמי שיהיה ספר זה לפניו סדורים לפניו דברי התלמוד עם פרש״י והתוספות והר״ן ופסקי הרי״ף והרא״ש והמרדכי והרמב״ם והגהותיו ומגיד משנה ורבינו ירוחם וספר התרומה ושבלי הלקט והרוקח ושערי דורא וספר התשב״ץ וספר העיטור ונמקי יוסף וסמ״ג וסמ״ק וארחות חיים ותורת הבית והגהות אשירי וספר המנהיג והאגור וספר בעלי הנפש להראב״ד ותשובות הרא״ש והרשב״א והר״י בר ששת וה״ר שמעון בר צמח ומהר״י קולון ותרומת הדשן, כל דבריהם מבוארים היטב <strong>ובקצת מקומות מאמרי הזוהר.</strong></p>\n<p>It emerges, then, that whoever has this book before him will have arranged before him the words of the Talmud together with Rashi and Tosafot and the RaN, and the legal rulings of the Rif and the Rosh and the Mordekhai and the Rambam along with his glosses, as well as the Maggid Mishneh, Rabbeinu Yeruḥam, Sefer ha-Terumah, Shibbolei ha-Leqet, the Rokeach, Sha'arei Dura, Sefer ha-Tashbeẓ, Sefer ha-ʿItur, the Nemukei Yosef, the Sefer Mitzvot Gadol (SeMaG), the Sefer Mitzvot Katan (SeMaK), Orḥot Ḥayyim, Torat ha-Bayit, the glosses of the Haggahot Asheri, Sefer ha-Manhig, the Agur, Sefer Baʿalei ha-Nefesh by the Raavad, responsa of the Rosh, Rashba, R. Yitzḥak bar Sheshet, R. Shimon bar Tzemach, Mahari Kolon, and the Terumat ha-Deshen—all of their words clearly explained, <strong>and in some places, passages from the Zohar.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later on in Beis Yosef, 31:2, after a thorough discussion of tefilin on chol hamoed, he ends as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומאחר שבתלמודא דידן לא נתבאר דין זה בפירוש מי יערב לבו לגשת לעבור בקום עשה על דברי רשב״י המפליג כל כך באיסור הנחתם</p>\n<p>And since this law is not explicitly clarified in our Talmud, who would presume in his heart to dare to act affirmatively in violation of the words of Rabbi Shimon bar Yoḥai, who so greatly emphasizes the severity of the prohibition regarding their placement?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is in accord with his opinion (BY 141:3) that the Zohar—which R Karo believed to be authored by a Tanna—is followed when it doesn't directly contradict the Talmud, even if it conflicts with the Rishonim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכיון דלדברי הזוהר אסור לקרות אלא אחד לבד ועכשיו שנהגו שש\"ץ הוא הקורא העולה אסור לקרות אף על פי שלדברי הפוסקים צריך לקרות ואם לא יקרא כתבו דהוי ברכה לבטלה מאחר שלא נזכר זה בתלמוד בהדיא לא שבקינן דברי הזוהר מפני דברי הפוסקים</p>\n<p>And since, according to the Zohar, it is forbidden for more than one person to read [the Torah portion], and now the custom is that the shaliach tzibbur is the one who reads on behalf of the one who goes up [to the Torah], it is forbidden for the one called up to read—even though according to the halakhic authorities (poskim) he is required to read, and if he does not read, they have written that it constitutes a blessing in vain (berachah levatalah). Nonetheless, since this [requirement for the one called up to read] is not explicitly mentioned in the Talmud, we do not abandon the words of the Zohar on account of the words of the poskim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>He deviates from the normal rule because it was the established practice before his time, with a basis in Rishonim and in Kabbalah. Established practice is not over-ruled by the harmonizing of the three main opinions in Halacha.</p>\n\n<p>But regardless the Kesef Mishna (by the same author as the S\"A) understands the Rambam to mean that wearing Tefilin on Chol Hamoed is not to be done (see <a href=\"http://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Chol_HaMoed#cite_ref-146\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> footnote 146).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the difference between (for example) \"notein\" and \"hanotein\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was looking through the <em>brachot</em> this morning. Many are structured as identifying <em>hashem</em> as \"one who <strong>__</strong>\" such as \"<em>matir assurim</em>\" or \"<em>oteir yisro'el btif'arah</em>.\" But the final three add in the letter <em>hei</em> before the verb to say \"THE one who <strong>__</strong>\" (\"<em>hanotein</em>,\" \"<em>hama'avir</em>\" and \"<em>hagomeil</em>\").</p>\n\n<p><em>Baruch she'amar</em> ends with \"<em>melech mehulal</em>\" but <em>yishtabach</em> ends with \"<em>habocheir b'shirei...\"</em></p>\n\n<p>After <em>borchu</em>, we say \"<em>oseh shalom</em>\" and \"<em>yotzer</em>\" but before <em>shma</em> we say \"<em>habocheir</em>.\" [in <em>ma'ariv</em> we say \"<em>hama'ariv</em>\" but then \"<em>oheiv</em>\"]</p>\n\n<p>Is there any consistent rule which would help me understand why a <em>bracha</em> might or might not include the letter <em>hei</em>? This is potentially just explainable through a ruling of Hebrew grammar but I sense that there is (should be?) a theological difference between the words.</p>\n\n<p>NOTE -- As source material I used the texts of the Siddur Tefilla Hashaleim (Askenaz and Sefard) - Greenwald, The Siddur Margalit Tovah (Ashkenaz, Eshkol Publishing), The Siddur Chazon Ovadia and some Artscrolls. The Artscrolls have \"gomeil\" not \"hagomeil\" and some texts have \"asher heichin\" instead of \"hameichin.\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think that grammar is a major part of the answer and can lead to a theological insight. It is pretty clear to me that even without the <em>hey</em> (called the <em>hey ha'yediah</em>), the phrases should be translated and understood as \"THE ...\"\nAs a simple example without getting bogged down with too much grammar, think about the very familiar text, <em>Baruch atah Hashem, Elokeinu - <strong>Melech Ha'olam</em></strong> \nOf course, this doesn't mean \"one who is King of the world,\" but rather \"THE King of the world.\"\nIn case you are interested, this is a function of the way adjectives work in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>On to the d'var torah - One way to understand the difference is like this:\nWithout the <em>hey</em>, we are almost giving Hashem a title. Just like He is <em>Melech Ha'olam</em>, he is <em>Yotzer Ha'meorot</em> - The Creator of the Heavenly Bodies. One way to relate to Hashem is to see His actions as revealing truths about His absolute essence - He IS  etc. Each of these titles, just like His names, reflect a different aspect of Him.  </p>\n\n<p>The second way (the brachot with a <em>hey</em>) to relate to Hashem is to try to understand Him through seeing and appreciating his many different actions on their own, knowing that we can never truly know Him entirely. For example - <em>Baruch ata...Hamevareich et amo Yisrael Ba'shalom</em> - Blessed are you Hashem...the King of the World, Who blesses his nation Yisrael with peace. We are focusing on God's actions, not on his Being. </p>\n\n<p>These are two very different but very deep and essential approaches to Avodat Hashem which we get to experience every day!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The 'hei' is the equivalent of saying 'asher' or 'that'</p>\n\n\n",

In <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1003.htm#16\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Isaiah 3:16</a> the prophet states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moreover the LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched-forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Commenting on the words \"the daughters of Zion are haughty\", <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Abarbanel\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Isaac Abarbanel</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהיו בעלות גאוה או שהיו מגביהות גופן למעלה ע\"י נעלים גדולים</p>\n<p>That they were haughty, or that they would raise their bodies higher by means of big shoes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abarbanel is apparently noting that the Hebrew phrase גבהו בנות ישראל in the verse is somewhat ambiguous. While it could mean that they raised themselves up with haughtiness, it can also mean that they physically raised themselves up by wearing shoes that made them look higher/taller. If this is the meaning of the verse, then this is what the prophet was strongly criticizing.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Wearing high heels is not inherently immodest according to halacha, as long as the rest of the outfit meets tzniut requirements and the overall presentation does not aim to attract undue attention in a provocative way.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps that would also require a minyan, however, Rav Mordechai Eliyahu ztzl in his notes there brings the Kaf haChaim 591:26, who is lenient on the Aramaic passages.\nAshkenazim however do not seem to say those passages at all during the hoshanah rabbah additions.\nThe Yemenite and Spanish and Portuguese custom is to say the 13 middot of rachamim on hoshanah rabbah, which are not to be said without a minyan in the form of prayer (see previously quoted Kitzur), but according to some authorities can be said with the normal tune of reading (see Ben Ish Chai Ki Tissah 9 first year).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there kabbala is a Ascetic or Sufi style group in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shalom, my question is \"Is there any shrines and sufi style religious groups in Judaism, are the Kabbala peoples sufis ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This is a difficult question to answer (especially because I'm not quite clear on what you're asking). I'll offer a few observations (sorry for the length! summary at the bottom):</p>\n\n<p>First, with regards to the Qabbala and Sufism — they are separate systems, and each have many different varieties and interpretations depending on time and place. With that said, there are many similarities between them. Some are due to their nature as 'esoteric' or 'mystical' paths within a religious faith (one of my teachers prefers to talk about \"a concern with transformation\" rather than \"mysticism\"). Others are due to actual historical contact and conversation between Qabbalists and Sufis. </p>\n\n<p>In different places there were groups of what might be called \"Jewish Sufis\" or \"Judeo-Sufis\" — Jews who performed some limited degree of Sufi practice while living within Jewish communities. We know of these groups in medieval Egypt (Paul Fenton has written on this fairly extensively, see his essays <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=KBjtygnlBtEC&pg=PA201\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=i-82PgsJJDIC&pg=PA301\">here</a>; Nathan Hofer also has a chapter in <a href=\"https://etd.library.emory.edu/view/record/pid/emory:91jft\">his dissertation</a> on this topic, and Loubet's article <a href=\"http://bcrfj.revues.org/2312\">here</a> is interesting), as well as in medieval Spain, where the Jewish-Sufi had an deep effect on Jewish philosophy and poetry (see Diana Lobel's work on <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=V8DbnUcf6QUC\">Yehuda haLevi</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=Q_UGgSxZlw4C\">Bahya ibn Paquda</a>, and Paul Fenton's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=373XAAAAMAAJ\">work on Abraham Maimonides</a>). </p>\n\n<p>There also appear to have been Judeo-Sufi groups in other places, e.g. Persia both medieval (Rumi certainly had Jewish disciples) and modern (Raphael Patai has <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=ryQFkvzgmCcC&pg=PA41\">a chapter on this</a> in his book on Mashhadi Jews, and see <a href=\"http://kavvanah.wordpress.com/2013/08/24/jewish-sufi-dervishes-1922/\">here</a> from Sarshar's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=cR5WAAAAYAAJ\">Esther's Children</a>), and the Balkans (see <a href=\"http://www.islamicpluralism.org/1188/the-last-jewish-sufi\">this</a> fascinating article; I have also heard that there is research being done on the relationship between Balkan Sufism and the origins of the Hassidic movement).</p>\n\n<p>However, it appears that the Judeo-Sufi movement for the most part either died out or was absorbed into the different streams of Qabbalistic movements that evolved after it. Bahya ibn Paquda's work, for example, became very important in certain streams of Qabbala and even in Hassidut as well, even though in its own context it is neither Qabbalistic nor Hassidic. </p>\n\n<p>In modern times practitioners or students of Qabbala may have some contact with Sufi groups but I don't think Qabbalistic movements share the same kinds of organizational structure with Sufi brotherhoods today; and (at least in my observation) there are many more <em>students</em> of Qabbala than <em>practitioners</em> of it, while Sufism might even be the reverse (although there are obviously many excellent scholars of Sufism, for sure). Anecdotally, I have met several people who are attempting to revive some kind of Judeo-Sufi practice, at least in their own lives, but so far it's just scattered individuals without any centralized leadership or organization.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, a brief (I promise!) note about shrines in Judaism: again, historically it was much more prevalent than today. The definitive works on this in the North African context are Issachar Ben-Ami's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=Hk9wCuiT7bEC\">Saint Veneration Among the Jews of Morocco</a>, the work of <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=pH3Tb_qYoSAC&pg=PA89\">Yoram Bilu</a> and <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=WPpsbqSf1-EC\">Alex Weingrod</a> on Moroccan saint veneration in Israel, and Sharon Vance's <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=5eE0QbtrTAgC\">work</a> on the Moroccan Jewish saint Solika the Pious (and check out the various works listed in their excellent bibliographies). Unfortunately I don't know how much work has been done on shrine/saint veneration in other Jewish groups. Susan Starr Sered touches on the importance of saints for the Kurdish Jewish community <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=ntxH771eydkC&pg=PA18\">in her book</a>, and <a href=\"http://books.google.ca/books?id=CJ8_4Kt0XUgC\">this book</a> on medieval saint veneration among Levantine Jews looks interesting.</p>\n\n<p>So the <strong>short answer</strong> is, \"Qabbalists are not Sufis, although there is a relationship between their movements and some Qabbalist groups might even be 'Sufi-style'; there were once Jewish Sufis but they have mostly disappeared. Shrines were also once important in Jewish practice and are still venerated by some Jews in Israel today, but not by all.\"</p>\n\n<p>Hope that answers your question!</p>\n\n\n",

For the same reason, I won't discuss here a case in which someone did a prohibited act <em>without</em> knowing that what he was doing was wrong. (The rules are somewhat different in such a case.) Thus, <strong>caveat lector</strong>: the below is about cases in which the <em>Shabas</em>-violator knew he was violating <em>Shabas</em>.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If something is cooked by a Jew on <em>Shabas</em> the cooked food cannot be eaten on that <em>Shabas</em>, and is forbidden <em>to him</em> forever. (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em> 318:1.) The commentators note that the same is true for other prohibitions, not just cooking.</p>\n\n<p>But <em>Beur Halacha</em> (\"אחת משאר מלאכות\", quoting <em>Chaye Adam</em>) says that if a forbidden act done on an object did not physically change the object in any way (e.g. something was <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hotzaa-carrying-reshuyot\">carried</a>), then it's prohibited only until the close of <em>Shabas</em>, even for the violator. He (still quoting <em>Chaye Adam</em>) adds that if the forbidden act, though it didn't physically change the object, was a divine prohibition then one should not allow himself that lessening of the restrictions, but should consider the object prohibited as per the general rule above.</p>\n\n<p>But buying clothes on <em>Shabas</em> is <strong>usually</strong> not a divine prohibition. (It can be in some circumstances.) So in most cases, you would not be allowed to use the garment on <em>Shabas</em>, but it would be permitted afterward. Even if a divine prohibition were violated, the garment would be permitted to everyone but the violator.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is a general discussion based on <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> and others.

When the Torah was given, the day was given over also. In fact, the purpose of Shabbat is also to remember יציאת מצרים (see the 4th Commandment <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A7%D7%98%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%94:%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in Devarim</a>), so that can be considered the date that is being remembered. As long as a community of Jews was keeping Shabbat, the day would not have been messed up. </p>\n\n<p>Note that according to Rabbi Menachem Kasher's unusual position on the Dateline, the day for Shabbat just follows the community (cited <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/12760/implications-of-samoa-skipping-a-friday#comment20421_12763\">here</a>).

Just because there's a more \"convenient\" format doesn't mean we're free to change how we perform public worship.

In the Midrash \"Pirkei Rebbi Eliezer\" it says that from the beginning of creation nobody became ill, but instead a person would sneeze and his soul would exit from his nostrils, until Yaakov came along and asked Hashem for mercy - that He shouldn't take his soul until he has time to command his offspring how to conduct themselves after he is dead. Hashem accepted his request, as it says <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0148.htm#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishis 48,1</a> \"And it was after these things that Yosef was told: Behold!

What is the underlying reason behind this difference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The difference of minhagim is already mentioned in the Remah himself, see <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=yd_x5542\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Rabbi Wosner in Shiurei Shevet Levi mentions that Yemenites wait 7 days.</p>\n\n<p>The reason for waiting before doing a hefsek taharah is because there is a halacha that a woman who discharges live semen is considered tameh (just like any man who emits semen) and that such a tumah disrupts her counting of seven clean days. Therefore, since any semen that is older than three days is not considered viable, a woman must wait at least three days before beginning to count her seven clean days. This is true even if she did not have relations with her husband before becoming a Niddah (and even if he was out of town and couldn't have relations with her, but if he was forbidden to her, then some hold that those days of abstinence can count for these three days). In order to ensure that there were three full days (i.e. three periods of twenty-four hours, not calendar days), we make her wait four days according to the Shulchan Aruch. The Remah adds that since if they had relations during bein hashmashos one might make a mistake in counting the three days, one should be stringent and wait five days before counting the seven clean days (unless she became a niddah through virginal defloration, in which case even the Remah agrees she could wait a mere four days).</p>\n\n<p>I hope I made this clear enough.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Reb Chaim HaQoton's answer is a very good explanation, but I would like to add a couple of details. As he says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The reason for waiting before doing a hefsek taharah is because there is a halacha that a woman who discharges live semen is considered tameh (just like any man who emits semen) and that such a tumah disrupts her counting of seven clean days. Therefore, since any semen that is older than three days is not considered viable, a woman must wait at least three days before beginning to count her seven clean days. ... In order to ensure that there were three full days (i.e. three periods of twenty-four hours, not calendar days), we make her wait four days according to the Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What this means is that a woman who has marital relations, and then has her period start, must wait 72 hours (three 24-hour days) from the time she had relations so that any semen that drips out from her is no longer viable, and then if she makes hefsek tahorah, she can start counting her seven clean days from the following night. These three 24-hour periods are called \"four days,\" because they always comprise parts of 4 different calendar days: the day she had relations plus 3 calendar days following that. Only after those 4 days can she start counting seven clean days.</p>\n\n<p>Reb Chaim HaQoton then goes on to write:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is true even if she did not have relations with her husband before becoming a Niddah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That's not strictly true. The Mechaber allows one to count 4 days including the day of her last martial relations, exactly as I have written above. (R' Ovadia Yosef is one contemporary posek who poskins l'halacaha that Sepharadim can count this way.)</p>\n\n<p>The Rema brings a stringency: in order that women should have a uniform way of counting, the 4 (actually 5, as I'll explain below) days should start from the day that she first saw her period. I believe that all Ashkenazic poskim rule this way, as well as many contemporary Sephardic poskim (e.g. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu, Rav Ben Tzion Abba Shaul, and the poskim of the American Syrian community). It's this opinion that Reb Chaim HaQoton's answer reflects.</p>\n\n<p>Reb Chaim HaQoton then writes a separate stringent custom that the Rema holds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Remah adds that since if they had relations during bein hashmashos one might make a mistake in counting the three days, one should be stringent and wait five days before counting the seven clean days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's this stringency which is why (some) Sepharadim keep 4 days, and Askhenazim keep 5 days. It should be noted that many Sephardic poskim poskin by this opinion as well, and hold that one should keep 5 days. (e.g. Rav Mordechai Eliyahu, Rav Ben Tzion Abba Shaul, and the poskim of the American Syrian community.)</p>\n\n<p>Of the Sephardic poskim I've seen and listed so far in this question, they either hold by both stringencies of the Rema, or they don't old by either. There is one other contemporary Sephardi posek who I've seen who holds by only one of these stringencies: The author of HaBayit HaYehudi holds that one can count 4 days, but they start from the day the woman sees her period.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>All of this only matters if the woman stops bleeding before those 4 or 5 days up. If she bleeds for longer than that, then she can't start counting 7 clean days before she stops bleeding anyway anyway (though it's worth asking she'ilot about questionable bedikot after those 4 or 5 days, even if you're inclined to look at them and be stringent about the color). I was told by my rav (a talmid of R' Ovadia Yosef) that practically speaking I probably wasn't going to run into a situation where my wife could make hefsek tahorah on the 4th day.</p>\n\n<p>Both the halacha that the seven days have to start after the woman stops bleeding, and the halacha of semen (requiring a minimum of 4 or 5 days before hefsek tahorah) have been adopted into hilchot niddah from the biblical requirements for a zavah. (A question that I see you've asked elsewhere on this site in a couple of different forms.) The reason for this is that it's difficult to distinguish between zavah and niddah bleeding.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>If you're interested in great detail about the biblical sources of everything, Gemaras, and the opinions of the Rishonim and Acharonim, I recommend <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1592643256\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Laws and Concepts of Niddah by Rabbi Zvi Sobolofsky</a>, a Rosh Yeshiva at Yeshiva University.

When he did, he came out saying that he\n  could not understand what all the interest was about the sanctuary,\n  when it was only an empty room.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Okay, I am confused here. This Pompey is an enemy of Hashem. He came to holies of holies where many high priests have died entering. Yet he doesn't die. So many Roman soldiers would desecrate the Temple and remove all its gold. Yet those soldiers didn't die. Why?</p>\n\n<p>So many westerners blaspheme God on daily basis, God didn't strike any single one of them, and yet Uzzah who only tried to help was smitten.</p>\n\n<p>Why is there this double standard?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think this answers it. see Yetzer Enticement #19 of the Chovos Halevavos <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=383#ch5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Gate 5 ch.5</a> regarding not considering yourself better than a seemingly bad person.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And even if his appearance is bad, it is possible that the reason is\n  because he is ignorant of his obligations to the Creator.

In fact, there was no ark in the second temple (it was \"an empty room\"), so the Romans could not have been harmed from touching it. </p>\n\n<p>The question is really variant of the general issue of theodicy and why bad things happen to good people and vice versa. An opinion in the Talmud (Kiddushin 39b) states \"שכר מצוה בהאי עלמא ליכא\", \"There isn't reward for Mitzvah in  this World\". This would mean one cannot expect deeds to be rewarded and punished in this world, which means the Romans may have done evil and not suffered here for it. However, the Talmud (Gittin 56b) does recount that after Titus destroyed the Second Temple a bug entered his head and gnawed away his brain for many years. So it seems to hold there can be punishment in this world for the wicked. </p>\n\n<p>In short, Uzzah was exceptional case in different era who touched the ark itself.

The Gemara poses a question: Where did that wind go? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: It went to conquer the entire world under the wicked Nebuchadnezzar. And why was all of this necessary? Why was it necessary that the entire world be subjected to his dominion? So that the nations of the world would not say: The Holy One, Blessed be He, delivered His children into the hands of a lowly nation. Since it was already decreed that the kingdom of Israel would fall into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, God made him into a great conqueror, so that Israel would not be ashamed of being defeated by him.

The reason given for having lost the praise \"HaGibor\", \"The Mighty One\" is because Hashem let the Temple get destroyed, so it appeared, chas veshalom, that He wasn't mighty. How did the Men of the Great Assembly restore it? By arguing for Hashem's Might from another angle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲתוֹ אִינְהוּ וְאָמְרוּ: אַדְּרַבָּה, זוֹ הִיא (גְּבוּרַת)\nגְּבוּרָתוֹ: שֶׁכּוֹבֵשׁ אֶת יִצְרוֹ — שֶׁנּוֹתֵן אֶרֶךְ אַפַּיִם\nלָרְשָׁעִים</p>\n<p>The members of the Great Assembly came and said: On the contrary, this\nis the might of His might, [i.e., this is the fullest expression of\nit], that He conquers His inclination in that He exercises patience\ntoward the wicked.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Steinsaltz:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>God’s anger is flared by the gentile nations’ enslavement of His\npeople, yet He expresses tremendous might by suppressing His anger and\nholding back from punishing them immediately. Therefore, it is still\nappropriate to refer to God as mighty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Hashem's infinite wisdom, delaying the punishment of the wicked in this case is the best course of action, but in order to do so, Hashem has to, so to speak, go against His nature.</p>\n<p>The gemara continues and explains that part of the reason for this is in order to <em>preserve</em> the Jewish nation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֵלּוּ הֵן נוֹרְאוֹתָיו — שֶׁאִלְמָלֵא מוֹרָאוֹ שֶׁל הַקָּדוֹשׁ\nבָּרוּךְ הוּא הֵיאַךְ אוּמָּה אַחַת יְכוֹלָה לְהִתְקַיֵּים בֵּין\nהָאוּמּוֹת?</p>\n<p>And these acts also express His awesomeness: Were it not for the\nawesomeness of the Holy One, Blessed be He, how could one people,\nsurvive among the nations?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This destruction somehow preserved us. The most common explanation is so that our sins can be forgiven, as sin is the true cause of suffering and death (e.g. Berachot 5a). There may be deeper explanations too.</p>\n\n\n",

The philosopher claimed that he could change a cat and make him act like a person. Maimonides said this was impossible. They agreed to make a contest. When the day of the contest came, the philosopher brought a cat that he had trained to be a waiter. The cat served an entire meal, and the audience was amazed. Just as they stared and assumed that Maimonides had been proven wrong, Maimonides took out a container from his pocket. He opened it up and a mouse ran by. The cat saw the mouse, dropped the tray of dishes that he was holding, breaking them all, and ran after the mouse. Maimonides was proven right, and everyone agreed that no matter what, a cat is a cat. As much as he may be trained to act in a particular way, he is still inherently a cat and must be treated as such.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yissocher_Frand\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Yissocher Frand</a> attributes the story <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5768/chayeisarah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simcha_Zissel_Ziv\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Simcha Zissel</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I find this story difficult to believe, given the claim of extremely high-level animal training that the Rambam's disputant was able to achieve. I find it hard to even picture a cat with the physical, much less mental, ability to serve a meal as a waiter would. It's particularly jarring to hear a story about the Rambam, in particular, that features apparently supernatural feats performed by random philosophers, given his own rationalist bent.</p>\n\n<p>In addition, the punchline of this story is identical to that of a similar story in the ancient Greek story teller <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aesop</a>'s Fables called \"<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20120202140432/ancienthistory.about.com/library/bl/bl_aesop_cat_venus.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Cat and Venus</a>,\" which <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mouse_Turned_into_a_Maid#Venus_and_the_Cat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">has been</a> adapted in many forms in Western culture.

In the 19th century, the French folklorist Emmanuel Georges Cosquin conducted a wide survey on the story's dissemination; in addition to classic Greek tales of animal transformation (i.e., Aesop's fables, Zeus tales), Cosquin traces the story of the cat's inherent nature to medieval accounts in Latin (<em>Cat and the Candle</em>), English (<em>Salomon and Marcolf</em>), and later French (Jean de la Fontaine's fables). The story became popular in Ottoman territories, leading to the Sephardic version with Maimonides as the hero. </p>\n\n<p>Cosquin even points to versions of the story found in India, Sri-Lanka, Tibet, and Vietnam. In his commentary on the story, Dov Noy discusses the patterns of the Jewish renditions, which usually center on a young Jewish woman outwitting a Christian adversary. These Jewish folktales have spread from Poland to Morocco, and are recorded in the Israel Folktale Archives. Noy notes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In Jewish traditions, particularly as represented by the tales in IFA [Israel Folktale Archives], the heroine acts as a helper to her troubled father, fulfilling not only the role of the clever girl but also that of the good father. In other versions, a rabbi is the leading Jew who outsmarts the Christian or Muslim opponent. In the IFA, the rabbis are Maimonides (1135-1204), Jonathan Eyebeshutz (1690/95-1764), and Israel Ba'al Shem Tov (the Besht) (1700-1760). </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Like other folktales, the cat story went through many manifestations before its appropriation in Jewish communities. </p>\n\n\n",

Why do we need to know about the four rivers?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Malbim <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40102&st&pgnum=47\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in his commentary to Bereishis 2:10 and following pesukim</a> seems to adress this question. He says that history has proven that mankind tended to dwell on riverbanks (hence the account of Adam when cast out of Eden would fit later). And also the description of the rivers would indicate that God prepared good conditions for Man to disperse over various places each one of them different and influencing its people accordingly. The description of the four rivers allegorize this by saying some traits that mankind would be divided: </p>\n\n<p>1) Pishon represents the ones who strive after enrichment and treasures under the sky. The posuk 11 exempifies this by mentioning the land of Havilah, \"where there is gold\".</p>\n\n<p>2) Guihón, alludes to the ones who strive after the satisfaction of sexual desire, that's why Ezekiel 23:20 describes the inhabitants of the land of Kush as the ones \"whose phallus were like those of donkeys\".</p>\n\n<p>3) Tigris (Hidékel) represent the ones who strive after power and provoke war. The Kings of Ashur are exemples of that.</p>\n\n<p>4) and the last one, the Euphrates (connected to eretz yisroel, Shevuot 47b) represents the uniqunesse of those who raise great sages. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Slightly similar to the Malbim brought in @RenatoGrun's answer, Rabbi Philip Biberfeld wrote in \"Universal Jewish History\", vol. 2, pg. 184-185:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"There has been much guesswork about the meaning of these rivers and their probable sites. The tradition identifies them with the Indus, the Nile, the Tigris, and the Euphrates. It is, of course, hard to conceive how these well-known rivers can be visualized as branching out from the same original source. Besides, the parts into which a river is divided can hardly be called \"heads\" or \"beginnings\". They rather would be \"arms\" or \"branches\".</p>\n<p>Not much attention has been paid, however, to the fact that the description of the rivers is given in connection with the \"Tree of Knowledge.\" It should naturally have preceded in the portrayal of the vegetation of the trees. Instead, the reference to the rivers interrupts the story of the \"Tree of Knowledge\" to which the narrative afterwards returns. It seems therefore, that what is actually described is not the physical appearance of the rivers but the \"beginnings\" of human civilizations which, originating from one common source, developed along the banks of the four great rivers. This, indeed, is an exact portrayal of what actually happened in early human history. The first great civilizations came into existence in the fertile valleys of the Nile, the Tigris, the Euphrates, and the Indus systems. Though differing from one another in some details, all these civilizations exhibit certain common features.</p>\n<p>The Biblical outline is even more remarkable when one considers that the conditions to which it refers had already ceased to exist by the end of the third millennium. At that time Indian civilization seems to have been completely extinguished to be rediscovered only in our time. In Egypt and Mesopotamia eras of prosperity were succeeded by Dark Ages. These fundamental changes reflect the aftermath of the Flood which took place at this time.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There has been great discussion about the difference between the creation of Man in chapter 1 and the creation of Man in chapter 2. One of the most well-known explanations is that chapter 1 describes things in general while chapter two gets into the details. These chapter distinctions are, of course, a Christian invention. It seems that according to Rabbi Biberfeld, it would make more sense to include within the generalized description of the early days of Man and mankind the first 14 verses of chapter 2. The verses about the Tree of Knowledge and the rivers come to tell us that once Man became knowledgeable enough, he was able to set out into the world and start creating the great civilizations he is known for.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.16.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis Rabba 16:4</a> takes a particuar note that these rivers are not called <em>rivers</em> but <em>heads</em>. Thus, these rivers not only represent ways to leave Gan Eden (Eretz Israel), but also four leading empires that have dominated us during our history.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Tanḥum said in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi: In the future, the Holy One blessed be He will give the nations to drink from the cup of terror, (Drinking from the cup of terror is a metaphor for divine punishment (Isaiah 51:17, 51:22)) from the place from which justice [hadin] emerges. What is the source? “A river emerged from Eden [eden] to water the garden; and from there it parted” – “and became four rivers” is not written here, but rather, “and became four headwaters [rashim]” (<strong>Rashim can also mean rulers</strong>). – these are the four kingdoms, (That would ultimately subjugate Israel , see Daniel chapters 2 and 7). They are: Babylon, Persia-Media, Greece, and Rome-Edom. which correspond to the four headwaters.</p>\n<p>“The name of the one is Pishon” – this refers to Babylon, after: “Its horsemen come from afar [pashu]” (Habakkuk 1:8). “It is that which encircles the entire land of Ḥavila” – as it [Babylon] rose and encircled the entire Land of Israel, in whose regard it is written: “Have hope [hoḥili] in God, for I will yet thank Him” (Psalms 42:6). “Where the gold is” – this refers to the words of Torah, which “are more desirable than gold, than quantities of fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). “And the gold of that land is good” – this teaches that there is no Torah like the Torah of the Land of Israel, and no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel. “Bdellium is there, and onyx stone…” – [referring to] Bible, Mishna, Talmud, Tosefta, and agadda. (All these branches of Torah wisdom are to be found in the Land of Israel.)</p>\n<p>“And the name of the second river is Giḥon” – this refers to Media, as Haman would decimate its people like a serpent, after: “Upon your belly [geḥonekha] you shall go” (Genesis 3:14).</p>\n<p>“Tigris [Ḥidekel] [it is that which goes east of Ashur]” – this refers to Greece, which was quick [kala] and harsh [ḥada] in its edicts, as it would say to Israel: ‘Write for yourselves on the horn of an ox that you have no share in the God of Israel.’ Rav Huna said: In three areas, the kingdom of Greece takes precedence over [they surpass] the Evil Empire: (i.e. Rome). This is expounding on “it is that which goes east [kidmat] of Ashur,” which can also mean “it is that which takes precedence over Ashur.” Ashur here refers to Rome, as the Midrash goes on to explain. In its legal system, in its script, and in its language. Rav Huna said in the name of Rav Aḥa: All the kingdoms may be called after Ashur (See Isaiah 27:13, Zechariah 10:10) because they enrich themselves [mitasherot] through Israel. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: All the kingdoms may be called after Nineveh (See Nahum 1:1). The prophecy in that chapter is relevant to all the nations, not just Nineveh. because they adorn themselves [mitnaot] through Israel. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥalafta said: All the nations are called after Egypt [Mitzrayim] (See Isaiah 27:13) because they distress [metzirot] Israel.</p>\n<p>“The fourth river is Euphrates [Perat]” – this refers to Edom. Perat – because it voided [hefera] (It voided the treaty between the brothers, Jacob and Esau. The Romans are considered the descendants of Esau-Edom) and distressed his [Jacob’s] descendants. Perat – because it brings fertility [para] and abundance, due to the blessing of the elder [Isaac]. (Isaac gave Esau (Edom) a blessing of fertility for the land (Genesis 27:39)). Perat  – because in the future I will exact retribution [lehipara] against it. Perat – after its demise: “I alone have trodden the winepress [pura]…” (Isaiah 63:3).

That is what is written: “A river emerged from Eden to water [the garden, and from there it parted and became four streams]” (Genesis 2:10). Rabbi Tanḥuma, and some say Rabbi Menaḥama in the name of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi, said: The Holy One blessed be He is destined to give the nations of the world to drink from the cup of bewilderment in the future. “A river emerged from Eden,” the place from which justice [din] emerges. “From there it parted and became four streams” (Genesis 2:10), these are the four rivers.</p>\n<p>“The name of the first is Pishon” (Genesis 2:11), this is Babylon, as in: “Its horsemen will spread [ufashu]” (Habakkuk 1:8). “It is the one that encircles the entire land of Ḥavila” (Genesis 2:11), this is the wicked Nebuchadnezzar, who ascended and encircled the entire land of Israel, which longs [meyaḥelet] for the Holy One blessed be He. That is what is written: “Yearn [hoḥili] for God” (Psalms 42:6). “Where the gold is” (Genesis 2:11), these are words of Torah, as it is stated: “They are more desirable than gold, than much fine gold” (Psalms 19:11). “The gold of that land is good” (Psalms 19:12) – this teaches that there is no Torah like the Torah of the Land of Israel, and there is no wisdom like the wisdom of the Land of Israel. “There is the bdellium and the onyx stone” (Genesis 2:12) – Bible, Mishna, Talmud, halakhot, and agadda. (The different parts of Torah are compared to the varieties of jewels mentioned in the verse (Etz Yosef).)</p>\n<p>“The name of the second river is Giḥon” (Genesis 2:13), this is Media, which produced the wicked Haman, who beat the dough like a serpent, as in, “on your belly you shall go” (Genesis 3:14) (I.e. He attacked Israel as mercilessly as one beats and kneads dough, until Israel was as lowly as the serpent, to whom God said, “on your belly you shall go.”). “It is that which encircles the entire land of Kush” (Genesis 2:13), as it is stated: “From India to Kush” (Esther 1:1).</p>\n<p>“The name of the third river is Ḥidekel” (Genesis 2:14), this is Greece, which is sharp [ḥada] and swift [vekala] in their edicts against Israel, and says to them: ‘Write on the horn of the ox: Israel has no portion in the God of Israel.’ “It is that which flows east of Assyria” (Genesis 2:14) – Rav Huna said: All the kingdoms are called Assyria, as they bolstered [me’ashrin] themselves at Israel’s expense. Rabbi Yosei ben Rabbi Ḥanina said: All the kingdoms are called  Egypt [Mitzrayim] because they would torment [metzeirim] Israel.</p>\n<p>“The fourth river is Euphrates [Perat]” (Genesis 2:14), this is Edom, which flourished [sheparat] and multiplied through the prayer of the elder. (Isaac’s blessing to Esau, who is considered the progenitor of Edom.) Alternatively, which flourished and multiplied and tormented Israel’s world. Alternatively, which flourished and multiplied and tormented His son. (Israel is referred to as God’s son (see, e.g., Exodus 4:22)). Alternatively, which flourished and multiplied and tormented His house. (The Temple. Rome, which destroyed the second Temple, is considered to have descended from Edom). Alternatively, Perat, after its end, as it is stated: “I have trodden a winepress alone” (Isaiah 63:3).(The chapter begins: “Who is this coming from Edom?” (Isaiah 63:1), and refers to the ultimate destruction of Edom.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Midrash continues at demonstrating that Avraham, Moshe, and Daniel saw visions of these exiles.</p>\n\n\n",

(This applies to all Mikvaot, not just for Keilim (dishes).)</p>\n\n<p>According to the Sifra on Vayikra 11:36 and Zevachim 25b, if you have two pools, one filled with <em>kosher</em> water (eg, rainwater), and another filled with <em>pasul</em> water (eg. tap water), if they are connected by a pipe such that the waters connect, the <em>pasul</em> water becomes <em>kosher.</em>  This is known as <strong>השקה.</strong>  (See illustration <strong>1</strong> below.)  It is preferable that the pipe be made from a material that cannot become <em>tameh.</em></p>\n\n<p>There is a related concept called <strong>זריעה,</strong> which states that if you have two connected pools (as above), one empty, and one filled with <em>kosher</em> water, you can fill the empty pool by adding <em>pasul</em> water to the <em>kosher</em> pool, causing it to overflow.

    "content": "# Why are bread and wine important?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the first Rashi of the sixth chapter of Mesechet Brachos, Rashi writes that wine (and bread) have their own Brachas because they are important. What does Rashi base this statement off of? Where does he see their importance?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.torahplace.com/whats-so-special-about-bread/\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article by Rabbi Shlomo Riskin</a>, Rav Soloveitchik explained the special nature of bread as relating to the degree of human involvement required to turn G-d's creation (stalks of wheat) into edible bread. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Soloveitchik explained as follows: Concerning the Seven Species,\n  the partnership between G-d and humans is limited, with the humans\n  performing a largely custodial task...   In contrast, bread’s extraordinary journey from the field to the mouth requires a series of specific procedures.   According to the Mishna’s categorization of the 39 forbidden activities on the Sabbath, eleven are devoted to the preparation of bread: “Sowing, ploughing, reaping, binding sheaves, threshing, winnowing, selecting, grinding, sifting, kneading, baking….” (B.T. Shabbat 74b)...\n  Rav Soloveitchik suggests that the greater the degree of human input, the greater  the degree of sanctity. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>We may also compare the midrash (Tanchuma Tazria 5) which describes the conversation between Rabbi Akiva and Turnus Rufus, in which the human involvement of making bread is compared to circumcision. It shows how the world was created with the intent that it be completed by man.</p>\n\n<p>As for wine, the same principle could apply. Grapes can be eaten right from the vine, but the human involvement of pressing and fermenting elevates the sanctity of the product.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Initially, I thought it had to do with the centrality of the 5 grains, but that would then demand that ALL grain products have a special bracha. I found <a href=\"http://koltorah.org/ravj/14-2%20Pat%20Akum%201.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> discussion of Pat akum which discusses why bread is important enough to be covered by such an edict, and in it the author writes</p>\n\n<p>\"The Rif (Avoda Zara 14b) and Tosafot (Avoda Zara 35b s.v. Michlal) record the Jerusalem Talmud (Avoda Zara 2:8) that states that Chazal also rescinded the Pat Akum decree because of the difficulty for most people to abide by it, as bread is \"Chayei Nefesh\" (one's life depends on it). We should clarify that in pre-modern times and even today in many cultures, bread is the main component of the meal (see Tehillim 104:15). Our affluent North American society in which bread does not serve such a function is an exception. Certainly, in the time of the Gemara, bread was a centerpiece of a meal (see Sukkah 27a regarding Agrippas' assistant).\"</p>\n\n<p>Though I have no specific source, I would assume that wine's importance is through its sacramental position or centrality to simcha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This may come from Genesis 14:18:</p>\n\n<p>וּמַלְכִּי-צֶדֶק מֶלֶךְ שָׁלֵם, הוֹצִיא לֶחֶם וָיָיִן; וְהוּא כֹהֵן, לְאֵל עֶלְיוֹן.</p>\n\n<p>And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; now he was a priest of God Most High.</p>\n\n\n",

But there is no recital in order to honor or bless the husband or father of the family.</p>\n\n<p>I know that in less traditional homes there are some who recite a psalm or something in honor of the husband, probably perceiving the lack of such a reading as an omission.</p>\n\n<p>Why is there no such blessing included in the the traditional order? Is it unnecessary or inappropriate, and if so, why?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>First, some background information</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>You are correct that the recitation of <em>Esheth Hayil</em> was instituted - in fairly recent history by some latter-day Qabbalists - in order to praise the <em>Shekhinah</em>. This is also true with regard to the popularized \"Shalom Alekhem\" <em>piyut</em> which was composed to praise the spiritual beings which supposedly escort men home from the synagogue on <em>Lel Shabboth</em> (I say \"supposedly\" since both the concept of the \"two angels\" and being escorted by them are interpreted metaphorically by early authorities). Either way, these practices are not mentioned at all in the halakhic literature of Hazal and the actual <em>halakhah</em> is to come home on <em>Lel Shabboth</em> and begin immediately with <em>Qidhush</em>.</p>\n\n<p>While it is certainly true that <em>Mishlei</em> 31 has been, since ancient times, been associated with <em>nashim ssidqaniyoth</em> (\"righteous women\") of the <em>Tanakh</em> (as found in <em>Midrash HaGadhol</em>, <em>Midrash Tanhuma</em>, and various geniza fragments - to list a few examples), there was never a practice to recite it on <em>Lel Shabboth</em> until the popularization of the <em>Qabbalah</em> in recent centuries.</p>\n\n<p>The same holds true for the practice giving of <em>berakhoth</em> to one's children on <em>Lel Shabboth</em>; the custom is mentioned by Ashkenazi <em>aharonim</em> (like the Ya`avetz and the Gra, as well as the disciples of Arizal) and is given justification from the <em>Qabbalah</em>. Again, the practice is fairly recent and is not included in the <em>halakhah</em> (e.g. the Rambam, et al). </p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, to answer your question</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The reason that there is not a \"blessing of the father or head of the family\" is because there was <strong><em>never</em></strong> a concerted effort to create blessings or honorable mention for each member of the family on Friday night. Like I mentioned, the actual <em>halakhah</em> is to come home on Friday night and make <em>Qidhush</em> and begin the <em>se`udhah</em> immediately. The Qabbalists, however, seizing upon various mystical interpretations of <em>Shabbath</em> (e.g. the Sabbath Queen, the blessing of the Sabbath during the days of creation, etc.), decided to institute these practices which did not exist prior.</p>\n\n<p>The blessings and recitations of <em>Shabboth</em> were originally <strong><em>only</em></strong> for the Creator of the world, and many authorities - who refrained from saying <em>Esheth Hayil</em>, singing <em>Shalom Alekhem</em>, and even from giving <em>berakhoth</em> to their children - felt that it should really have stayed the way it was originally.</p>\n\n\n",

There the Torah specifies that the Torah specifies that seven pairs of each animal that is <em>tehorah</em> (clean) should be taken and only two pairs of those who are <em>not tehorah</em>. Usually, the opposite of <em>tehorah</em> is <em>temayah</em> (unclean), a term avoided by the verse. After a lengthy discussion, Netziv concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the essential meaning of <em>tehorah</em> and <em>not tehorah</em> in the Noach story refers to the fittest (<em>temimim</em>) as against the unfit (<em>ba'alei mum</em>)...And there is a variant reading in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zevachim.116a.9?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zevachim 116a</a> that states: And were there pure and impure species at that time, during the period of Noah? Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani says that Rabbi Yonatan says: The pure animals that Noah took were from those that had not been used in the performance of sin.

    "content": "# Why do we pray for G-d to smash down our fellow Jews?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My question refers to the twelfth blessing of the Amida, which seems to contravene the Biblical mitzva of ahavas yisroel*:</p>\n\n<p>\"And for the slanderers let there be no hope; and may all wickedness perish in an instant; and may Your enemies be cut down speedily. The wanton sinners -- may You speedily uproot, smash, cast down, and humble speedily in our days. Blessed are You, HaShem, Who breaks enemies and humbles wanton sinners.\"</p>\n\n<p>According to my siddur (Artscroll), this originally referred to \"heretical Jewish sects\" such as the Sadducees, and also refers to heretical influences today. I may not know my history, but to me, the Sadducees seem no \"worse\" than karaites; and in any case, does it really matter? We are supposed to love our fellow Jews regardless of their faults, perceived bad influences, and differences with our opinion, then and now, no?</p>\n\n<p>So how does praying directly to G-d to have them \"broken,\" \"smashed,\" \"cast down,\" \"cut down,\" etc., fit together with this essential concept? </p>\n\n<p>(*Relevant mitzvot and sources: #26, and possibly #34, on the list <a href=\"http://www.jewfaq.org/613.htm#Love\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>A medrash Tehillim on perek 118 cites the explanation of Beruria that the verse says \"yitamu chataim min ha'aretz\" - not that the sinners should be destroyed, but sin should be destroyed - we do not pray for the destruction of the evildoers.  The wording of this blessing echoes that sentiment - kol harisha means the evil, not the evildoers.  We never pray for them to be destroyed - that is only for \"oyvecha\" - Your enemies. Nonetheless, we want the evildoers to cease being evildoers.  If that requires them to be cast down and broken, the result is that they be humbled, which is the point of misfortune and tragedy (See R' Dessler in Michtav Me'eliyahu about 5 levels of belief).  In the end of the day, it is out of love for them that we want them to fail in order that they reconsider their actions and their path.</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal in Be'er HaGolah Be'er Sh'vi'i explains this <em>beracha</em> along these lines (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42915&st=&pgnum=424&hilite=.\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> in the R' Hartman edition, p. 419-421).</p>\n\n<p>The Maharal explains how each clause of the <em>beracha</em> is directed towards the nature of the evildoer, but not towards the evildoer himself:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>״ולמשומדים אל תהא תקוה\", שלא יהיה תקוה להם שיהיו עוד המשומדים במציאות, רק יסורו מן\n   העולם. ורצו לומר שלא יהיו עוד אנשים כאלו בעולם, רק יחזרו מן מעשיהם</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Let there be no hope for the <em>meshumadim</em>\" - that they should not have any hope of there being <em>meshumadim</em> in existence, but they should depart from the world.  Which means to say that there should not be any people like that in the world, just that they should turn away from their actions.</p>\n  \n  <p>״וכל המינים כרגע יאבדו״, שלא תהיה דעת מינות בעולם, ואז יהיו נאבדים המינים מן העולם</p>\n  \n  <p>\"And all the heretics should be lost in a moment\" - that there should not be any more <em>mindset</em> of heresy, and then the heretics will be lost from the world.</p>\n  \n  <p>ואילו היה מתפלל ׳וכל המינים כרגע ימותו׳, היה משמע כי מתפלל על מפלתן. אבל לא אמר רק ״וכל המינים כרגע יאבדו״, היינו כי לא תהיה עוד דעת מינות בעולם</p>\n  \n  <p>Were it that we prayed \"all the heretics should die\" it would imply that we pray for their downfall.  But we just say \"they should be lost,\" meaning that there should not be any more heresy in the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Maharal continues line by line through the rest of the <em>beracha</em> with this approach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>The commandment of Ahavas Yisroel has its limits:</strong></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et0513.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 13</a>:7-12 discusses a 'enticer' who tries to lead you\naway from belief in Gd and Judaism.

[<strong>I took that to mean</strong> that Ahab wasn't just ignorant or mistaken. He was actively leading Israel astray, despite warning after warning from Elijah and others. This would seemingly qualify him as an 'enticer', which as we explained above, places him in a category outside of the love and brotherhood of Israel as a whole.]</p>\n\n<p><strong>So when we pray for the doom of the wicked</strong>, we are specifically referring to those who persistently reject the Torah, and who seek to lead others away from our precious lifeblood and connection with our Creator.</p>\n\n<p><strong>I would also stress</strong> the wording in the blessing: \"and may all <em>wickedness</em> perish in an instant\", which occurs before we use any language of smashing enemies.

    "content": "# Can a woman ever wear a prayer shawl?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've seen prayer shawls for girls available on the internet e.g. for Bat Mitzvah.  I'm not sure what to think of it or if I'm comfortable with it.  Can a woman wear a prayer shawl, and if so under what circumstances?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Torah commands to attach tassels (or \"fringes\") to the edges of any four-cornered garments we must wear; however this only applies during the day, not night. This makes it a \"yes-do\" command that's limited in time. The rule of thumb for this category of commandments (which also includes shofar, lulav, and the like) is that women aren't obligated in them; however it would be meritorious for them to choose to do so. Sephardic women do not recite a blessing on such actions, Ashkenazic women do.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to prayer shawls, however, there was one opinion from the Talmudic era that because it's an item of clothing, it inherently becomes \"a man's garb\" and prohibited for women to wear. (The Torah prohibits cross-dressing.) We generally don't follow that opinion, but it is a cautionary note. Many are of the opinion, however, that the standard black-and-white model may be problematic as \"men's garb\", so something more feminine-looking is preferable.</p>\n\n<p>The biggest issues are what we'd call the \"meta\" concerns. Is a woman wearing this saying \"G-d I'm not actually obligated to do this, but I like doing something extra\", as part of a well-balanced range of religious activities, or is this a big political statement to show everyone else that there are no differences between men and women?</p>\n\n<p>In short, if a woman wants to wear a prayer shawl:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don't make a blessing on it if you're Sephardic.</li>\n<li>A feminine-looking shawl is better than the standard kind.</li>\n<li>Think about how it fits into your general religious life.</li>\n<li>Wearing it in private is probably best; you won't ruffle any feathers that way, and it will challenge you to ask yourself to what extent you're doing this for the sake of being seen by others.</li>\n<li>It would be best to stipulate \"I am not pledging to do this on an ongoing basis.\" (If I establish a regular pattern of meritorious activity, that could be construed as pledging to G-d to continue it, unless I specify otherwise.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Good luck!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I've shared your reaction in the past.  Interestingly enough, it seems that Posekim in the last century (who disapproved of women wearing one at all) preferred that <em>if a woman were to wear one</em>, she wear one that is distinctively feminine in its design.</p>\n\n<p>I cannot pull all the necessary sources at the moment, but the basics are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Shulchan_Aruch/Orach_Chaim/17\">Shulhan 'Aruch writes</a> that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Women and slaves are exempt [from wearing tzitzit] because it is a time-dependent commandment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The RaM\"A adds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And if they wish to wrap [in tzitzit] and say the blessing on them it is up to them to do so as with all time-dependent commandments (Tosafot and the Rosh and the Ran, Chapter 2, Rosh Hashanah, First Chapter of Kiddushin). Unless they are doing it to appear more observant than others in which case they may not wear them since they are not required as men are (Agur Section 27).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This point about false piety is taken very seriously by R' Moshe Feinstein, who stated that there are clearly multiple issues at play.  Since women are exempt, their decision to adopt the Mitzvah needs to be done for the sake of the Mitzvah, not for the sake of being like a man.  In a similar vein, since women are exempt, the very nature of the act of donning a garment for a Mitzvah in which only men are obligated kinda makes that garment a masculine garment by definition.  As such, a truly pious woman, who decides to do the Mitzvah for the sake of Heaven, ought to wear only a garment that is clearly feminine in its design.</p>\n\n<p>RM\"F comes down strongly against women doing it at all, since most women who did so, by and large, were part of movements pushing women's egalitarianism, while at the same time pushing aside most Torah observance that was actually required; today, I personally still think he would oppose women's performance of the Mitzvah (except, perhaps, in exceedingly rare instances), even among women who keep Halachah, since, again, most women who want to do it are doing so in an effort to push egalitarianism much more than for the sake of the Mitzvah.  But, again, if a woman were to do it, he'd require her to wear a feminine-looking garment.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Minhagim, are not halachos, but there are as strict and well guarded as halachos and laws. It's been the minhag for ages for women not to wear tzitzis or talisim, so I and many others cling to the idea that women should not wear talisim. It is not discriminating women. Women have a more special connection with Hashem, and so by wearing tzitzis a women is almost denying her special connection. Women have many other obligations. Hope this helps, -Ezra</p>\n\n\n",

Which would you recommend and why specifically? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mishna Berura Oz WeHadar that it is split into many volumes has these features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Biurim – explanation of the words of the Shulhan Aruch, Rama, and Mishna Berura including the relevant sources from the Gemara and Rishonim.</li>\n<li>Biurei HaHalacha – explanation of the words of the Biurei Halacha including the relevant sources from the Gemara and Rishonim.</li>\n<li>Tsiyunim Vehearot – notes and comments and some Pilpul in the Poskim</li>\n<li>Mishnat Shaar Hasiyon – clarifying the opinions in the Shaar Hasiyun</li>\n<li>Kisur Biur Halacha – summary of the Biur Halacha</li>\n<li>Likute Poskim – Pesakim from the Shulhan Aruch HaRav and Hazon Ish</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The Mishna Berura Dirshu will bring explanation and comments on the Daf of Mishna Berura but it is not at all an in depth explanation like the Mishna Berura Oz WeHadar. So if you have the money and are interested in a real limud in the Mishna Berura take the Oz Wehadar. If you just one want to learn Mishna Berura regularly (which isn't Has Weshalom bad) with a few nice notes from the later Aharonim and the bringing of the places where the Mishna Berura writes \"Ayen Sham\" take the Dirshu.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Besides the points made in the other answer here, there's a major difference in focus between the two.\nDirshu's set out to create an updated version of the Mishnah Berurah. The Mishna Berurah wrote that the work is meant to help people learn halacha even if they cannot look up primary sources. Just by learning Mishna Berurah they should know what to do.</p>\n<p>Dirshu set out for this purpose as well. Therefore they raise modern day issues which are not discussed in the Mishnah Berurah and bring contemporary pskei halacha. It's geared so that while you are learning the Mishnah Berurah, you can follow their notes and learn how the mishna berurah's rulings are applied practical today.</p>\n<p>For example, when the Mishna berurah discusses cooking on Shabbos, Dirshu will bring down the contemporary issues about gas ovens and stovetops, hot plates etc. On the discussion of opening up barrels on Shabbos, Dirshu will bring in the issue of modern day packaging.</p>\n<p>As a corollary, they also only bring down the poskim who they feel represent the main halacha. Generally speaking, the piskei halacha are from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chazon Ish</li>\n<li>Rav Moshe Feinstein zatza\"l</li>\n<li>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach zatza\"l</li>\n<li>Rav Yosef Shalom Elyashiv zatza\"l</li>\n<li>Rav Nissim Karelitz zatza\"l</li>\n<li>Rav Shmuel Wosner zatza\"l</li>\n<li>For sefardi psak they usually bring Rav Benzion Abba Shaul zatza\"l</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This accounts for the vast majority of their psakim. They only occasionally will bring other poskim, and that's usually when the issue is not mentioned among the above mentioned.</p>\n<p>All of the above is based on my experience with Dirshu, as well as from having conversations with some of the rabbonim who worked on the commentary.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Oz v'Hadar is coming to give a complete picture on the mishna berurah. That includes explaining and expounding the mishna berura, as well as mentioning who argues with him. I remember, while learning the Oz vHadar version, coming across pesakim from the Maharsham, Avnei Nezer, Aruch Hashulchan and more who disagreed with the Mishna Berurah.</p>\n<p>It's a sefer for someone who wants learn the mishna berura in depth.</p>\n\n\n",

It notes that this is a shame, since it leads people to sin when they don't see sins punished. However, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3109.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">9:1</a> is a brief intermission:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כִּי אֶת כָּל זֶה נָתַתִּי אֶל לִבִּי וְלָבוּר אֶת כָּל זֶה אֲשֶׁר הַצַּדִּיקִים וְהַחֲכָמִים וַעֲבָדֵיהֶם בְּיַד הָאֱלֹהִים גַּם אַהֲבָה גַם שִׂנְאָה אֵין יוֹדֵעַ הָאָדָם הַכֹּל לִפְנֵיהֶם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This says that what people do is in God's hands. (I'm using <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%93%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow\">the מצודות</a> for my understanding of קהלת, and my understanding of the verses follows their explanation.)</p>\n\n<p>What does this have to do with the surrounding verses? (Indeed, if anything, it seems to contradict them: if our actions are not our own choice, then our sins would not be reduced by seeing others' sins punished.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Metzudos (Dovid) on 9:1 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי את כל זה. האמור למעלה שמתי אל לבי, ולברר ממנו את כל זה אשר הצדיקים והחכמים עצמם ומעשיהם אשר יעשו הכל המה ביד האלהים, והם אינם שולטים לא בעצמם ולא במעשיהם: גם אהבה. אפילו האהבה שאוהבים את מי, גם השנאה ששונאים את מי, אין האדם יודע מהו הסיבה: הכל לפניהם. כל אלה נגזר מן השמים לפני בואם:</p>\n<p>”For all of this” which was said above I placed on my heart, to clarify from it all of this, that the righteous and wise themselves and their actions they do - all of it is from the Hand of G-d, and they don’t rule not over themselves nor over their actions. “Also love” - even the love, that they love someone; “also the hate” that they hate someone, a person doesn’t know the reason. “Everything is before them” - all of these are decreed from Heaven before they came.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words: 9:1 makes a great segue between the end of chapter 8 and the beginning of chapter 9, in that the observations at the end of chapter 8 led Shlomo HaMelech to conclude that everything comes from Hashem, the righteous end up like the wicked (9:2), and ultimately to the line you reference in the OP, that people are almost <em>encouraged</em> to sin when they see that it goes unpunished (9:3).</p>\n\n\n",

(Rabbeinu Chaim Paltiel also adopts this approach.)  Also, see R. Hirsch who comments similarly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכיחס \"לשון\" ל\"שפה\" - בהוראה המוחשית - כן גם בהוראה המופשטת. <strong>השפה היתה אחת, אך הלשונות היו שונות</strong>, הוה אומר: הם דיברו שפה אחת בדיאלקטים שונים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would love to check various translations, but I do not have many available to me at this point.

    "content": "# What is the shitah of the Rambam regarding mevarekh mossi havero [מברך מוציא חברו]?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>Before asking the question, I need to give some background information</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam in Hilkhoth Berakhoth 1:11 says,</p>\n\n<p>כָּל הַשּׁוֹמֵעַ בְּרָכָה מִן הַבְּרָכוֹת מִתְּחִלָּתָהּ וְעַד סוֹפָהּ, וְנִתְכַּוַּן לָצֵאת בָּהּ יְדֵי חוֹבָתוֹ--יָצָא, וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁלֹּא עָנָה אָמֵן</p>\n\n<p>Translation:</p>\n\n<p>\"Everyone who hears a <em>berakhah</em> from [any of the categories] of <em>berakhoth</em> from its beginning to its end, and intends thereby to fulfill his own obligation, has fulfilled his obligation, and [it is so] even if he did not answer <em>Amen</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>It is apparently assumed that the Rambam is of the opinion, expressed in the Shulhan Arukh (cf. Orah Hayyim 213:3), that in order for the listener to be <em>yossei yedhei hovatho</em> he must not only hear every word of the <em>berakhah</em> being recited, but the one reciting it (the <em>mevarekh</em>) must also have the specific intention of being <em>mossi yedhei hovatho</em>. Basically implying that both the <em>mevarekh</em> and the one listening to him (the <em>shomea</em>) must have made some sort of agreement beforehand that each would have the other in mind. However, from the plain reading of the Mishneh Torah, it would seem that Rambam holds that the intention to fulfill one's obligation is only required on the part of the one who hears. Further, no mention is made of the <em>mevarekh</em> and the <em>shomea</em> making prior arrangements to have each other in mind. </p>\n\n<p>Anyone who is familiar with the style of the Rambam knows the he says what says and what he doesn't say he doesn't say. In other words, if the Rambam makes no mention of the requirement of intention on the part of <em>mevarekh</em>, then it would seem that he does not hold it to be necessary for the <em>shomea</em> to fulfill his obligation. This is the general rule, with the exception of some cases - such as <em>natilath yadhoyim</em> where the entirety of <em>halakhoth</em> regarding it are found in Hilkhoth Berakhoth 6, with the exception of the <em>halakhah</em> of being <em>meshafshef</em> ones hands, which is found all the way toward the end of the Mishneh Torah in Hilkhoth Miqwa'oth 11:2(3). So, if anyone knows of another place in the Rambam which speaks about this halakhic subject, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>In researching this halakhah in the Rambam, I have read the available <em>nosei kelim</em> (which are the Kesef Mishneh and the Migdal Oz in this case), the <em>pirush</em> by Rav Yohai Maqbili shlit\"a, the <em>pirush</em> of Mori Yusef (Rav Yosef Kapah) z\"l, the Shu\"T HaRambam, the Shu\"T Rav Yehoshua HaNagidh, and the various Shu\"Tim of Rav Ratzon Arusi shlit\"a. In all of this I found that NONE of them discussed this question at all, with the exception of Rav Arussi who did not bring any textual support from the Rambam for the requirement of intention on the part of the <em>mevarekh</em> to be <em>mossi</em> the <em>shomea</em>, rather he said that <em>le-aniyuth da`ato</em> he held that it was required. Other than this, I have not found anyone who expresses an answer making an argument from the text of the Mishneh Torah itself.</p>\n\n<p>One further piece of information: In Hil. Berakhoth 1:15 the Rambam states that we do not answer \"Amen\" after a child who is merely reciting <em>berakhoth</em> while learning. He then states  וְהָעוֹנֶה אַחֲרֵיהֶן אָמֵן, לֹא יָצָא יְדֵי חוֹבָתוֹ (\"And the one who does answer <em>Amen</em> [after the <em>berakhah</em> of a child reciting <em>berakhoth</em> for the sake of learning them] <strong><em>does not fulfill his obligation</em></strong>\"). It would seem from this statement that the Rambam is dealing with a <em>hava mina</em> (assumption; pre-conceived notion) that intention is required only on the part of the <em>shomea</em> to fulfill his obligation but not on the part of the <em>mevarekh</em> since it is clear that a <em>tinoq shel beth rabban</em> (schoolchild) does not have the <em>da`ath</em> required to be <em>mossi yedhei hovatho</em>. It seems as if the Rambam is answering this <em>hava mina</em> by saying, \"Your assumption is correct that intention is only required by the <em>shomea</em>, but this principle will not work in this particular case.\"</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Does the Rambam hold that both the one who recites a <em>berakhah</em> and the one who listens BOTH need to have the other in mind in order for the one listening to fulfill his obligation thereby? Sources are greatly appreciated!</p>\n\n\n",

Listen carefully the next time you or someone else tries it. If it were a different consonant at the end, e.g. a Resh or a Samech, there would be no problem pronouncing the tzeirei, but a difficult guttural like a Heh triggers a weakening into a segol.

If you don't pronounce the Heh, you sound like other Jews, and one could argue that the meaning is perfectly clear while the standardization legitimizes the 'incorrect' pronunciation.

Rather, the difficulty stems from the fact that the first languages of most Ashkenazim do not allow /h/ at the end of a syllable. Ashkenazim, and other speakers of most European languages, are only used to pronouncing /h/ when it’s followed by a vowel.</p>\n<p>The solution is to take a step back and practice saying the word slowly: “she-mey-<em>puff</em>”. After enough practice, anyone should be able to pronounce the word as “shemeyh”.</p>\n<p>(The ideal solution might be to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/98372/32959\">re-adopt</a> the ancient pronunciations of liturgical texts; but let’s take this one step at a time).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<h1>1</h1>\n<p>Indeed, it is phonologically difficult to have a tzeirei leading into a guttural in a closed syllable, such as is found at the end of a word.

Aramaic regularly solved this problem  for other gutturals in a different way than patach ganuv, often by changing the preceding vowel to a patach.</p>\n<p>In Aramaic, there certainly are plenty of examples of tzeirei mapik heh, so they pronounced it. Maybe they even had enough practice (and other phonological context) that they even pronounced it as a full tzeirei. If this is so, then my question still stands, since the question is how and whether Ashkenazim can accurately produce these sounds within their consistent phonological system; whether we medakdekim are really accomplishing anything by our strange pronunciation; and whether a different course might then be in order.</p>\n<h1>2</h1>\n<p>But maybe pronunciation of identical nikkud marks in different phonological context is OK. Chassidim in my shteible pronounce segol in different ways: in the word melech, the first open stressed syllable as \"a\" in \"hay\" and the second as \"e\" as in \"egg\". So too kamatz, in an open syllable as \"oo\" in \"food\" and as \"o\" in \"brother\" in closed syllables. And listen to most Ashkenazim as they pronounce a chirik, whether officially malei or chaser. Certain phonological contexts trigger an \"i\" sound as in \"trigger\".</p>\n<p>So what does it matter if the Tzereh before a mapik heh tends to become like a Segol?</p>\n<p>Indeed, this sort of organic natural development is what likely led to phenomena such as patach ganuv.

There never was or is a \"split\" between Ashkenazim and Sepharadim. They are two different regional \"flavors\" of Judaism, and don't (or shouldn't) have emnity or difference in basic Jewish belief. </p>\n\n<p>Not to mention that the terms \"Ashkenazi\" and \"Sepharadi\" are extremely broad - with the term Ashkenazi you could be speaking of German, Polish-Hungarian, Lithuanian, Ukrainian-Russian, and Italian Jewry, and with Sepharadi you could be speaking of Spanish-Portuguese or North African \"flavors\". Plus, far-eastern groups don't fit in either category, such as the Yemenites and Iraqi Jews, who would fall in the category of \"Mizrahi\". </p>\n\n<p>If you look back in the times of Hazal, you'll see that there were different \"flavors\" of Judaism back then. Consider the differences between the communities in Judea versus Galilee, Rome, etc. Or if you go back even farther, consider how each tribe of Israel had a different \"flavor\" of Judaism. </p>\n\n<p>So there has never been a \"split\", it's just that different practices have formed with Jews being spread out over the  face of the globe. Ashkenazim don't find it strange at all to pray with shoes on, because royalty was greeted with shoes on in Europe, but some Sepharadim and Mizrahim might take their shoes off!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is way below my usual standard, but I asked around and heard that people seem to think that <a href=\"http://mg.alhatorah.org/Full/Bemidbar/24.5#e0n7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 24:5</a>, מה טבו אהליך יעקב, can also be taken as a slight curse, and that in the future there will be many tents in Kelal Yisrael (a minimum of 2), and that refers to this split.  While I don't personally feel that this is a biblical prediction of such a split, it could be that this is what the person that told you was thinking of/referring to.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>In my humble and purely theoretical understanding, a <strong>real diametrical split</strong> would be between <strong>the Litvaks and the Hassidim</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>They represent two ways of serving Hashem, representing, respectively, \"סור מרע\" and \"עשה טוב\". In other terms, it is Din and Hessed, mind and body, brains and soul, Shabbos and weekdays etc respectively.</p>\n\n<p>This differentiation can be traced back to the first Hassidim (\"חסידים ראשונים\" as in Mishna) that spent 9 hours a day in prayers (as described in Brochos), up to a point when the Gemmorah wonders \"how do they learn Torah at all?\". An interesting observation is naming convention of the Gdoylim in both communities: <strong>Litvakes calling them \"Geoynim\"</strong>, putting the weight on the brains, while <strong>Hassidim call them \"Kadosh\"</strong> (כבוד קדושת), emphasizing the purity of the soul. This can be clearly seen in Brochos (34b) on the difference between R' Yochanan Ben Zakay and R' Haninah Ben Dosah \"אלא הוא דומה כעבד לפני המלך, ואני דומה כשר לפני המלך\".</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, I conclude that those two approaches are intrinsic to Judaism. To Sefardim, on the other hand, being attracted mainly to leveling between the two, I would address <strong>the middle line which is Tifferes</strong>.</p>\n\n\n",

According to these opinions, it does not apply to insects, and likely not to rodents.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>...and concludes that there it is permitted to experiment on animals, given the inherent gain to humans, however with several understandable caveats:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>limit the number of animals used, and minimize pain (including using lower species).

By the times of the Talmud the recommendation had become \"she must be grown-up enough to agree to marry the fellow.\"</p>\n\n<p>Yes, a previously-married woman is considered more \"on her own\" than the first time around. See for instance <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=4&CHAPTER=30\" rel=\"nofollow\">Numbers 30:10</a>; a twelve-year-old girl was considered sufficiently tied to her father that he had the power to cancel out her vows -- but not if she was previously married. </p>\n\n<p>(See Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan's footnotes in the linked texts for more sources.)</p>\n\n<p>However this whole thing was very much tied to a time when most women were married right around their twelfth birthdays. Once a woman reaches twelve-and-a-half, she's completely independent. Her father can't marry her off, cancel her vows, sell her, or the like. (Though it's generally recommended for children of any age and gender to involve their parents somewhat in the process of finding a spouse.)</p>\n\n<p>So there may be some cultural baggage behind the \"father walking his daughter down the aisle\", but you'd really have to squint and read things sideways to connect that directly to Jewish law. In most Jewish weddings today, the bride is escorted down the aisle by both her parents (just as the groom is escorted by his). Actually, in many ultra-Orthodox weddings, the bride is escorted by her mother and mother-in-law-elect, and the groom by his father and father-in-law-elect.

    "content": "# Is the name of God simply a third person form of to be?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>This article <a href=\"http://www.eliyah.com/yahweh.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.eliyah.com/yahweh.html</a> claims that Yahweh is simply a third person form of Hayah (to be). The first form is Ehyeh. Just like the word \"be\" in English is rarely used and become am, are, and is if the subject is first, second, or third person, so is the word hayah in hebrew, according to that article.</p>\n\n<p>According to the article, God doesn't really have a name. Yahweh simply means \"He is\".</p>\n\n<p>Is this true?</p>\n\n<p>However, that would be strange.</p>\n\n<p>If Yahweh simply means \"He is\" what's the point of hiding the sacred name given that I am sure everyone must have been saying it all the time in natural conversation like \"He is cooking. He is swimming. He is running\" etc.</p>\n\n<p>What's Judaism's perspective on this?</p>\n\n<p>Am I understanding this correctly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The claim is incorrect. The infinitive of ''to be'' in Hebrew is להיות. The present tense form of the verb, which not usually used, is הֹוֶּה. The causative form of the verb is מְהַוֶּה, meaning ''causes to be''. The name of God is not the third person form of ''being'', it is the third person form of ''causing to be'' or ''causing to exist''. It is much more powerful than ''he is'', it means ''He causes existence to exist''.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The root of the name seems to be the same as the verb \"to be\", but it doesn't match any Hebrew conjugation pattern.  Really, it seems to be a combination of the 3rd person future, present, and past tenses. This kind of describes God as eternal (as in \"being\" applies to him in the future, present, and past).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The actual literal translation of יְ-הֹ-וֶ-ה would be \"he will be now\" - the word הוה means now (even more <a href=\"http://www.bing.com/translator/?ref=TThis&from=he&to=en&text=%D7%96%D7%9E%D7%9F%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">zman hoveh - זמן הוה - means \"time present\"</a> i.e. present tense) <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yodh#Significance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">and as for yud</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>As a prefix, it designates the third person singular (or plural, with\n  a Vav as a suffix) in the future tense.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>which (as I see it) can be freely translated as either:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>\"he will be as he is now\" - g-d doesn't ever incur a change, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2700.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אתה הוא קודם שנברא העולם ואתה הוא אחר שנברא העולם</a> it's possible that \"I am\" fits into this group</li>\n<li>\"he will always be\" - he will never stop existing</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>which both basically mean <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/self-subsisting\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">self-subsisting</a> (some other similar translations are \"the eternal living one\", or \"he is eternal\").</p>\n\n<p>However it is very important to note that we don't read it, and there are other ways it can be read as well to mean things like \"he keeps (re)creating\" or \"He Causes to Become\" (both <code>יֵ-הַ-וֶ-ה</code>), and in qabalah often the order of the letters are switched around as well (הוה ,היה, and יהיה).</p>\n\n<p>For further reading <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">see here</a>.

    "content": "# How early in the cycle can a woman who is undergoing IVF go to mikvah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How absolutely early can a woman undergoing IVF (in vitro fertilization) go to mikvah: is there a limit to the 7 deoraita days or is it even earlier like after five or six days, when she would still be in her deoraita nida days?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Questions like this certainly need discussion with an expert. And please contact the wonderful people at www.yoatzot.org, who will be happy to help you. But for theory's sake:</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Feinstein (d. 1986) is of the opinion that there is no issue of having an IVF implanted, or even being artificially inseminated, during the nida period. The nida period only prohibits conventional relations.</p>\n\n<p>His contemporary Yoel Teitelbaum, the Grand Rabbi of Satmar, vehemently disagreed and felt that neither a fertilized zygote (IVF) nor sperm (artificial insemination) could be implanted in a woman who hadn't get gone to the mikvah. (As heard from a Rabbi Rakeffet mp3. <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=M0RVimtxsLEC&pg=PA30&lpg=PA30&dq=breitowitz%20fertility&source=bl&ots=WhMTJFKLtd&sig=7bXliEtgjo4DiBL95Nuy4T-aRSo&hl=en&sa=X&ei=dURXUq7iI6j94AOwx4GwBA&ved=0CG4Q6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q=teitelbaum&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's Rabbi Breitowitz</a> writing about the related question of donor sperm -- for artificial insemination or IVF -- as it relates to <em>mamzerut</em>, referencing <em>HaMaor</em> 15(9) for Teitelbaum's opinion, and <em>Igros Moshe</em> EH1:71 etc. for Feinstein's opinion otherwise. (It's said that Rabbi Feinstein got a brick through his window and disturbing phone calls from followers of Satmar because of his lenient view.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz, who has published on fertility methods in halacha, has observed that you could draw the line between artificial insemination (which is closer to normal relations) and IVF, allowing the latter but not the former during nida days, but interestingly enough Feinstein allows both and Teitelbaum prohibits both.</p>\n\n<p>Let me also clarify, because your question implies some confusion: </p>\n\n<p><em>Normal period, original Biblical law</em>: She begins her period on Sunday. That's Day 1. Saturday is Day 7. She is absolutely and completely a nida during this time no matter what happens. If she's confirmed that the bleeding is done by Saturday afternoon, she could go to mikvah Saturday night.</p>\n\n<p><em>Biblical law on abnormal period, effectively what's done today in all cases</em>: She waits five days or until her period ends, whichever is longer, and then counts seven clean days. </p>\n\n<p>This means that going to the mikvah any earlier than 7 days from the start of a period accomplishes absolutely nothing whatsoever, from the perspective of halacha. Not at a rabbinic level, Biblical level, nothing.</p>\n\n<p>Thus: according to Rabbi Feinstein, a woman undergoing IVF <em>never</em> goes to mikvah any earlier than she otherwise would (i.e. at least 12 days from the start of a period).</p>\n\n<p>There are some contemporary rabbis in Israel who seek to accommodate Teitelbaum's opinion on some level, which would raise discussions of going to mikvah between days 7 and 12 solely for the purposes of IVF, but that would be discussed invididually.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Celebrating Thanksgiving and Hanukkah together\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As far as the permissibility of celebrating Thanksgiving with a formal meal, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/4120/thanksgiving-meal-allowed\">that has been discussed in another question</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This year (2013), Thanksgiving coincides with Hanukkah. Some people have noted this and promote <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/christinebyrne/thanksgivukkah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">combining the two observances in entertaining ways</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming for the sake of this question that it is permitted to celebrate Thanksgiving in the conventional way, does the convergence of Hanukkah and Thanksgiving complicate matters? Is it permissible to incorporate common Thanksgiving themes into Hanukkah observances, and vice versa? Furthermore, even if it is technically permitted, is it in bad taste or disrespectful to do so? Or does intermingling the two holidays add to rather than take away from the value of both?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This all strikes me just as a matter of taste more than law, but nonetheless here's my two cents:</p>\n\n<p>Many rabbis feel that having a celebratory meal on Thanksgiving has nothing to do with anything pagan and is permissible, or even obvious. (Rabbi Joseph Dov Soloveichik was noted as moving his lecture earlier on Thanksgiving morning so he could catch the plane back to Boston for Thanksgiving dinner at his sister's house.) Other than Shearith Israel of New York City, however, I don't think most Jews treat it as of particularly religious significance. (I did see one synagogue at the very liberal end of the spectrum skip <em>Tachanun</em> that day -- convenient as it's always long-Tachanun Thursday -- but that's quite a stretch.)</p>\n\n<p>It is considered appropriate on Chanukah to have joyous meals, especially as that would enable you to recite <em>al hinisim</em> afterwards. So if you had family over, lit Hanukah candles (or even better, oil-and-wicks), then said \"happy Thanksgiving\", ate, and said the blessings afterwards commemorating Hanukah, okay fine everyone wins.</p>\n\n<p>To whatever extent you felt like blending the holidays' \"traditional\" food items with a sense of humor -- pumpkin latkes or whatever -- well, fine. The traditions behind chanukah foods aren't all that strong anyhow, so it's not that big of a deal.</p>\n\n<p>What bothers me most is the degree to which Chanukah has already been turned into yet another bland commercialized piece of Americana and lost its Jewish identity. This could make it worse. <code>\"Hooray Hanukah, Pilgrims Maccabees whatever yay, now turn on the ball game, touchdown! Beer commercial! Minyan shminyan, stampede at Black Friday @5AM for hanukah presents!\"</code> Something's lost in the message there.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Isaac Hutner, who had studied philosophy in Berlin, writes about Judaism's resilience in its tolerance to a great diversity of other ideas and cultures (this is called <em>hod</em>.) Extend a spring within its <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_limit\" rel=\"nofollow\">elastic limit</a>, and it will return to its proper shape. (Thus in Hebrew we find <em>hod ve-hadar</em>, where <em>hadar</em> is Aramaic for \"return.\") Pull it too far, however, and it distorts and fails. Thus Daniel's vision of the Greek era talks about <em>hodi nehpach alai lemashchit</em>, \"my openness to other wisdoms became destructive.\" Which is what happened when Jews got so much into \"Greekness\" that it came at the cost of Jewish observance.</p>\n\n<p>While <a href=\"http://www.tfdixie.com/special/thanksg.htm#A06\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hutner himself opposed observing Thanksgiving</a>, I'd be inclined towards extrapolating from his Hannukah essay to conclude: can we celebrate both Hanukah as American Jews and Thanksgiving as Jewish Americans? Sure. But if we blur the line altogether, we're heading someplace dangerous.</p>\n\n\n",

My question is what is wrong with asking angels to bless us? Yaakov does exactly that when he struggled with the angel of Eisav.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Angels can only do what they're programmed to do, they don't work for us. Hence it's questionable if I have any business asking angels to do anything.</p>\n\n<p>I would assume that if Yaakov is minding his own business and is suddenly attacked by an angel, the angel is now running a program called <code>interact_with_Yaakov</code>. Somehow Yaakov reasoned that the  <code>interact_with_Yaakov</code> program included something like <code>if (must_bless == True) then bless_Yaakov</code>. Hence he asked for it. But the angel won't give Yaakov his name as it's of no use -- once the sun comes up and the angel flies away, <code>interact_with_Yaakov</code> is no longer running and thus the angel no longer has a job interacting with Yaakov, hence Yaakov can't summon it or make any requests.</p>\n\n<p>As for how Yaakov deduces that the angel has a <code>bless_Yaakov</code> routine, the approach of the Sforno and others is that Yaakov realizes that G-d is sending him this struggle so he can learn a message of hope -- either that he's personally stronger than he thinks, or that his offspring will overcome adversity. Either way, the message isn't truly complete until he can force his adversary to bless him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First of all, according to Rambam and Ralbag the incident with Yaakov and the angel didn't actually happen. It was a prophetic vision.</p>\n<p><strong>Guide for the Perplexed 2:42</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The same, I hold, is the case when it is said in reference to Jacob,\n\"And a man wrestled with him\" (Gen. xxxii. 25); this took place in a\nprophetic vision, since it is expressly stated in the end (ver. 31)\nthat it was an angel.</p>\n<p>(<a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp129.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Ralbag Genesis 32:25</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונראה לו בנבואה מלאך ה' כאילו הוא איש</p>\n<p>And an angel of Hashem appeared to him in a prophetic vision as if he\nwere a man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/23391/dreaming-of-doing-a-sin\">I am assuming that if someone does something wrong in a dream it does not count as doing something wrong.</a>)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, when Ralbag discusses the blessings that Yitzchak gave to Yaakov, he states that a blessing can only be one of two things – a prophecy, or a prayer.</p>\n<p><strong>Ralbag Genesis 28:9</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזה כי כבר יסופק על ענין זאת הברכה אם היא הודעת מה שעתיד להיות או היא\nכמו תפלה ובקשה מהשם יתעלה שיברך זה המתברך כי בזולת אלו השני פנים לא\nיהיה תועלת בברכת הנביא</p>\n<p>And this is because we are already uncertain as to the nature of this\nblessing, whether it was a revelation of what would be in the future\nor if it was like a prayer and request from\nHashem-He-Should-be-Exalted that he should bless this person that was\nblessed. For besides these two choices there cannot be any benefit in\nthe blessing of a prophet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you look at what the angel responded to Yaakov, all he said was that Yaakov's name will no longer be Yaakov, but instead it will be Yisrael. That does not sound like much more than a prophecy, which would not be problematic as the whole issue with angelic blessings is that it ascribes power to someone other than God. If the angel is simply stating that something will happen there would be no issue, and in fact throughout Tanach angels tell people that things will happen.</p>\n<p>Also, R. Yaakov Emden (Siddur Rabbi Yaakov Emden Vol. I p. 565) actually lists nine potential objections to Shalom Aleichem and the accompanying prayers, and the one about praying to angels is possibly the least significant.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He never saw his father recite these, and they are not mentioned in any of the writings of the Arizal.</li>\n<li>It is forbidden to make \"requests\" on Shabbos, to the point that the Sages even removed all the \"request berachos\" from Shemonah Esrei on Shabbos despite it being an institution of the Anshei K'neses Hagedolah.</li>\n<li>One will read the text by the light of the candle, especially the parts with lengthy unfamiliar text, especially the first times that one recites them.</li>\n<li>Prayers to angels are inappropriate. However, he states that this issue is somewhat mitigated by what he wrote about prayers to angels in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7920&st=&pgnum=9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary to the Tur O.C. siman 3</a> (that as long as one acknowledges in the prayer that the angels are merely agents of God it is not really a problem).</li>\n<li>How can we innovate something that our ancestors/Sages never set? Why should we be \"wiser\" and more \"righteous\" than them?</li>\n<li>It is perhaps a violation of Bal Tosif (do not add to the mitzvos).</li>\n<li>There are grammatical issues, such as the \"ב\" in בבואכם and בצאתכם.</li>\n<li>The phrase ממלך מלכי המלכים (with the מ in the beginning) makes no sense.</li>\n<li>Why would you ask the angels to leave?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>He concludes by stating that his personal custom is to simply say the following one line:</p>\n<p>שלום עליכם מלאכי השרת מלאכי עליון מלך מלכי המלכים הקדוש ברוך הוא</p>\n\n\n",

Why would we use that as part of our selichot (where we ask for forgiveness for sins committed while we were already under the obligation to follow mitzvot) when it wasn't spoken about us and our being brought close? Are there no pesukim which point to a Jew's being brought to the Beit Hamikdash?</p>\n\n<p>Is it that, homiletically, we are calling ourselves converts?

He quotes the Minchat Chinukh (no. 464) and Chazon Ish (Sanhedrin 24:11) as asking the same question. </p>\n\n<p>He then explains that according to the Rambam, the sinners on their own must constitute a \"city\" on their own--because even though עיר הנדחת is determined by the majority of the city, we do not look at the non-sinners as if they have sinned, so the sinners on their own must fulfill the population requirements of the city. </p>\n\n<p>[I just came across an interesting Rogachover on this topic, צפנת פענח, תניינא, הל' עבודה זרה פ\"ד ה\"ב: </p>\n\n<p>שם. ויהיו המודחים ממאה ועד כו'. הנה רבינו שינה מלשון הגמרא דבגמרא בסנהדרין דט\"ו ע\"ב מבואר דפליגי כמה יהא בעיר לא כמה יהיו הנדחים וא\"כ אם העיר היתה מאה או היתה רובו של שבט אף שלא נדחה כל כך אז הוי זה הדין, ורבינו נקט שיהיו הנדחים כך. והנה לפשטות הגמ' דמאה ר\"ל כל העיר, וקיי\"ל בעירובין דף נ\"ט גבי עיר דצריך נ' דיורים, ע\"ש בדף ס' דשם גם נשי' וטף מצטרפי' וכאן גבי עיר הנדחת אי מצטרפין נשי' וטף ע' בירו' ובספרי ובתוספ', וא\"כ אי הוי פחות מנ', וא\"כ אי הוי פחות מנ' לא הוו נקרא יושבי עירם ולכך צריך ק'. ואם יהי' מחצה על מחצה בעיר הנדחת אין בש\"ס הכרעה, ועי' סנהדר' דקי\"א ע\"ב במשנה עד שיודח רובו כו' או שהודח מיעוטו כו' אבל מחצה ע\"מ אין הכרעה איך הוא הדין והוי בגדר ספק, עי' פסחים ד\"ז וחולין דכ\"ח וכ\"מ בזה. ובירוש' סנהד' מבו' דסדום הוה בגדר עיר הנדחת וראי' מלוט שנאבדו הנכסים שלו וזהו מה ששאל אאע\"ה אם יש בעיר חמישים צדיקים דאז יהיה בגדר מחע\"מ, ואמר השופט כל הארץ לא יעשה משפט, ולא א' כמשפט, כי שאל מדוע אין בכל התורה פסק דין ברור למע\"מ, ועיי' בירושלמי פ\"י הל' ז' ובדברי הראב\"ד בהשגות בהלכות מגילה עי\"ש. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Demons can wreak havoc on Tuesday and Friday nights? Why those nights specifically?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Pesachim 112b relates a story about demons.  The queen of demons (with a large army) used to be permitted to wreak havoc at will (which is a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/31570/472\">separate question</a>), until one day when she encountered R. Chanina b. Dosa.  She told him that they spoke of him in heaven and told her of his learning, so she was not allowed to take action against him.  He availed himself of this opportunity to forbid her to travel through settled areas, but when she pled for mercy he relented and said she could come out on two nights, Tuesday night and Shabbat (Friday night).</p>\n\n<p>Why those particular nights?  Shabbat in particular seems like a peculiar choice to me; it seems like a time that we would want to minimize, not maximize risk, since it is a social evening.  And Tuesday night just seems random.  Furthermore, it seems rather odd that he would give her two nights, and not just one, or even that he would relent at all.  <strong>Is there something we're supposed to learn about those nights from this episode?</strong></p>\n\n\n",

What is their purpose?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Bavli records in many places the existence of demons, and answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/729/472\">this question</a> cite rishonim and acharonim who take this seriously.  Pesachim 112b relates a <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/31567/472\">story</a> in which  demons are (initially) allowed to wreak havoc in the world at any time.  (They are later limited to specific times.)</p>\n\n<p>What is the purpose of these demons and their havoc-wreaking?  Humans have free will and can thus act badly, but demons are not humans and I understand that only humans have free will.  Demons are also not natural occurrences; earthquakes, tornados, etc. also wreak havoc, but that's built into the fabric of the universe that God created.  And as far as I can tell (I may be wrong on this) demons are not acting on specific divine orders the way ha-satan does.</p>\n\n<p>So what purpose do they serve?  Why did God create them and allow them to act in the world?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Ramchal in Da'as Tevunos in the section בריאת הרע וגדריו, starting with siman 96 and particularly in siman 114 and 118, explains how demons came into existence. </p>\n\n<p>114:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>כשאנו אומרים שהקב\"ה ברא העולם הזה, ודאי נבין בתחילה בריאת הכלל, ואחר כך הפרטים, פירוש, בתחילה הטבע עצמו, ואחר כך אישיו. והנה כשרצה האדון ב\"ה לחדש הטבע בטוב ורע, הנה ודאי הוא שבאה השפעה ממנו לחדש מציאות הטבע, וזהו הטוב; וזאת ההשפעת עצמה - קצת ממנה נעדרה, היינו, ההכנות הטובות שהיו בה, ותנאי השלמות שלה שהיו עושים הטבע בתכונתו טוב. והנה מציאות ההעדר הזה הוא שחידש בטבע הפסדי המציאות הטוב, שהם הם כלל הרע.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>118:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך בני האדם הם פחותים מן המלאכים וחסרים מהם, והחסרון בהם גבר כל כך שיש בהם מה שהוא רע, כי יש בהם יצר הרע, חולאים ומיתה. בעלי החיים יש בהם חסרון יותר, שאין להם לא שכל ולא דיבור, והם מזוהמים ומטונפים. ויש המזיקים ומלאכי חבלה ורוחות הטומאה שהם רע ממש, והם ההפך ממש לטוב ולשלמות, אותם שהשם העליון ב\"ה מתעלם מהם העלם גמור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>They are, in short, a natural outcome of the degeneration of the world into evil.  It is hard to sum up, but the basic idea is as follows: the world was created in two stages, first with a general construct of all the structure of creation, and then the specific entities that were created, both spiritual and physical.  The original construct defines what exists, and the subsequent \"supply\" gives the degree of perfection of that existence.  When Hashem \"hides His presence\" as a result of our actions and misdeeds, this construct still exists, but without perfection.  When the \"hiding\" reaches a certain threshold, things that are evil manifest result.  That is where demons and destructive forces come from.  Their existence is built into the framework of creation to allow \"destruction\" to exist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Tanakh is silent on the matter in great measure. The two sole exceptions are the incident of the evil spirit which came upon Saul and the satan who is allowed to tempt Job.  These give feeble clues as to the purpose of evil spirits. Saul deserved his punishment; Job did not.  He was allowed his experience as a test.\nI Chronicles 21:1 (compare 2 Samuel 24:1) may be added to those two texts. They read respectively: 'Satan rose up against Israel and incited David to take a census of Israel.' 'And again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he moved David against them to say, Go, number Israel and Judah.'  We see how what is in the first instance attributed to Satan is attributed to the LORD in the second. The LORD used Satan to punish Israel because he was angry.</p>\n\n\n",

Isaiah 27:1 describes it as a \"tortuous serpent\" that G-d will \"punish.\" The Gemara in Bava Basra 74b says that G-d will serve the meat of the leviathan to the righteous.

There are many opinions that the meal served to the righteous will be a physical meal, so we are talking about a unique kind of fish that would not normally be seen.</p>\n\n<p>The Baal HaTanya <a href=\"http://www.chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/lkutey/6/18b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">describes the idea</a> of the Leviathan (and the Shor HaBar) metaphorically. The Leviathan represents the righteous, like Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai and the Arizal (those are the two examples that he brings) that serve G-d primarily in their intentions and connection to the underlying spirituality, and thus with less emphasis on accomplishing physical Mitzvos. So Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai didn't fulfill many physical Mitzvos 13 years in the cave, but was still accomplishing his purpose - kind of like an angel but actually in the world instead of above it - so a \"fish out of water\" so to speak.</p>\n\n<p>The other type of service of the righteous is the Shor HaBar [that has an English term for it, but I don't remember what it is]. There the emphasis in actual fulfillment of Mitzvos in the world.

Even 18:10 which discusses the impermissibility of sorcerers says that A sorcerer should not be found among you. This doesn't mean that you must have more than one at a time for it to be OK. The use of the singular is to make a general case, not an exclusive moment.

Here the same term for \"arise/raise\" is used.</p>\n\n<p>Clearly, there were many false prophets, so obviously the verse is <strong>not</strong> talking about a singular definitive false prophet. It stands to reason that the early verses are also not exclusive to a single prophet. Indeed, these verses are the source for the commandment to listen to the words of a true prophet. Obviously, this commandment refers to all true prophets through history. For details of this commandment see Maimonide's Sefer HaMitzvot, Positive Command #172. The Chabad website provides a full English translation.</p>\n\n<p>The significance of the phrase \"God raise up\" can be seen by reading Maimonides' explanation of prophecy in his Guide For The Perplexed, part II, chapter 32. He states that there are three opinions of how one achieves prophecy. The first opinion is that God chooses anyone He desires to be a prophet, even if that individual is a fool and not particularly pious. The second opinion is that anyone who studies and perfects his faculties will necessarily prophesize. Maimonides rejects both these opinions and maintains that only an individual who has prepared himself for prophecy <strong>and</strong> whom God chooses to inspire will prophesize. (That's it in a rather crude nutshell- please consult the Guide for the full treatment.) So the verse is telling us that not every wise and righteous individual will necessarily prophesize, it's only one who \"God raises up\" who shall deliver prophecy.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Jawbone UP on Shabbat\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I recently received a new gadget: The Jawbone UP band. Look it up on Google, but the basic idea is it is a bracelet you wear 24/7 that measures all kind of things while you move around. </p>\n\n<p>Should it be removed on Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>TL;DR: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\"><strong><em>Please</em></strong></a> do <a href=\"http://meta.judaism.stackexchange.com/a/594/883\">CYLOR</a>, but one should probably remove it. I would not try to argue that it is clearly forbidden or not, though I would assert that the issues below make this complex enough that one should avoid it until they can consult with a competent halachic authority.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>There are three major issues, that I can see, with wearing one of these bands, like the Jawbone UP or the Fitbit Flex: Carrying outdoors, Measuring, and Electricity (as @trying mentioned, Writing is often discussed too). Each of these things are generally forbidden on Shabbos, with some exceptions.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Carrying<br>\nIn order to allow wearing one of these outdoors, one would have to argue that they are considered a \"garment,\" (or for women, an \"adornment\"). This is not insurmountable, and one could argue that it's similar to a watch, which many authorities allow. CYLOR</p></li>\n<li><p>Measuring<br>\nThe sages forbade any acts of measuring (where not essential for health or food), on Shabbos. These bands measure and record one's physical activity, and could certainly run up against this issue. CYLOR</p></li>\n<li><p>Writing (because why not?)<br>\nCould be an issue, although the fact there is only an electrical recording, and nothing visible (even on a microscopic scale), may make this a non-issue. Then again, it may not. CYLOR.</p></li>\n<li><p>Electricity<br>\nEssentially, these activity wristbands contain electrical sensors to measure things like movement and vibration. They then record the measurements, again, electrically. CYLOR</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>There are some factors that may allow one to be lenient in specific cases. For example, <em>indirect</em> usage can be used as <em>a</em> mitigating factor. @trying gives the example of opening a refrigerator, which could indirectly cause the compressor to turn on by lowering the temperature. Some authorities allow this, usually provided the effect is not immediate. <em>It seems to me that activity bands cannot make use of this leniency,</em> since there is no indirectness in one's activation of the sensors. They <em>directly</em> sense and record any movement by the wearer.</p>\n\n<p>Another possibility alluded to by @trying, is the idea of \"psik reisha,\" unintended results that were unavoidably caused by one's actions. Cases where the unintended result is <em>also</em> undesired are called \"psik reisha d'lo nicha lei,\" and can be combined with other mitigating factors to allow certain activities. This is less clear, and I can see some arguing whether walking/moving/sleeping while wearing these bands would be activating the sensors \"unintentionally.\" That seems unlikely to me: one is wearing the band for the express purpose of recording movement! Additionally, it would be difficult to argue that the resulting measurements are \"lo nicha\" (unwanted).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. Gil Student <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2017/03/fitbit-on-shabbos-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> quotes R Yisrael Rozen of <a href=\"http://www.zomet.org.il/eng/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzomet</a> (an Israeli institute dedicated to seamlessly merging Halachic Judaism with Modern Life) regarding a Fitbit with all displays turned off during Shabbat. R Rozen rules that</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if you normally wear the FitBit so that it has nothing changing on its\n  screen due to human movement and no alarms or alerts, then <strong>technically\n  you may wear it on Shabbos</strong>. You are wearing it the normal way and it\n  does not do anything observable nor cause anything you desire to\n  occur. He compares this to using water that is measured by a water\n  meter. When using the water, you are not directly doing anything\n  forbidden nor causing anything observable to occur.</p>\n  \n  <p>However, Rav Rozen adds that <strong>as a matter of public policy, people\n  should avoid these types of things absent a serious medical need</strong>.\n  There is a slippery slope of using electronic devices improperly. This\n  device can also be considered a debasement of Shabbos or an\n  interference with the Shabbos atmosphere.

Otherwise, the motor will be caused to go on sooner by the increase in temperature indirectly caused by the flow of heat from the outside. Most refrigerators and freezers automatically set the motor to turn on and blow cold air whenever the thermometer registers a temperature that is too high to keep the food cold. However, Auerbach and most authorities permit opening the door because this result is indirect, and because there are additional grounds to be lenient.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>and</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While most rabbis have ruled that the example of intentionally letting cold air into the room to operate the thermostat constitutes a violation of Shabbat, if the person opens the window for some other, legitimate, reason, and the cold air enters as a side effect, no violation has occurred. Additionally, most agree that if a person who has no intention to operate the thermostat does something which happens to operate it, no violation has occurred.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However regarding the issue of writing, all I can say is <strong>Making a mark (even with a fingernail) for a significant purpose is considered kosev midrabanan.</strong> but I'm not a rav, so I won't try to make something up.</p>\n\n\n",

Dessler. If I remember correctly, Rav Dessler says that someone who took action to raise or lower his spiritual level (thereby changing some behavior from free will to habit) is punished or rewarded each time he does the action for having made the change to his spiritual level.</p>\n\n<p>More concretely, if someone was not shomer Shabbat, and raises his spiritual level to the point where he wouldn't even entertain the notion of breaking Shabbat, then according to Rav Dessler, Shabbat is not something he has free will over anymore. In such a situation, each time the person keeps Shabbat, he is rewarded for having raised his spiritual level to the point where keeping Shabbat is a given.</p>\n\n<p>When is a person not rewarded for keeping Shabbat? Rav Dessler says that he's not rewarded when he was raised keeping Shabbat, and keeping Shabbat was always a given in his life, and there was never a time when he would entertain not keeping Shabbat. (If this sounds implausible, read his essay in Michtav me'Eliyahu or Strive for Truth, because a scriptural example of this situation is actually his point of departure for introducing the entire idea that I've described here.)</p>\n\n\n",

For an example of the former, see Sukkah 3:9 where R' Akiva learns information about the recitation of Hallel through observing Rabban Gamliel and R' Yehoshua; for an example of the latter, see Peah 2:5-6.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to legislation that is given a reason, the reason is always scriptural. This is unlike the Talmud, in which reasons might be scientific (ie: based on observation, be it medical or astronomical, etc), or rooted in a popular expression. But just because the Mishna applies a scriptural source to something, that by no means implies that the information is learnt from that actual source. In some instances, the source is merely being brought in order to buttress that opinion (\"to add... solidity\", as you phrased it), which the Talmud refers to as an <em>asmakhta</em> (אסמכתא). Literally, this means \"a support\" - something on which the legislation can \"lean\".</p>\n\n<p>The process of manipulating and applying a text in order to either derive halakhic information (what in English would be called exegesis) or in order to rest information upon it (eisegesis in English) is a process that the rabbis referred to as <em>midrash</em>. In actual fact, midrash can refer not only to the process but to the outcomes of the process as well, and it is not always clear whether those outcomes denote a proof or a support. An example of a midrash that unambiguously denotes a support would be drash in Sukkah 28a-b that derives from Leviticus 23:42 that women are not obligated in the mitzvah of dwelling in the sukkah (a halakha that we really learn out directly from the Mishna, Sukkah 2:8). For an unambiguous example of a proof text, see the drash of R' Elazar ben Matyah in Yevamot 10:3.</p>\n\n<p>(If you are interested, examples of dinim that some people believed had a proof text and others believed were halakhot from Moshe on Sinai, consider the issue of the <em>techum shabbat</em> in Sotah 5:3, 30b and that of <em>tosefet shevi'it</em> in Sheviit 1:4 and Moed Qatan 4a.)</p>\n\n<p>As for your primary question, which concerns the illogicality of some of those arguments that constitute proofs, be aware that the manner in which the chachamim conducted the process of midrash was anything but arbitrary. On the contrary, while their logic may not align with the manner in which you or I more naturally read a text, they employed a system no less consistent than our own, and one that they took the time to carefully delineate and expound. This is a system of <em>middot</em>, which in Biblical Hebrew means \"measurements\" but which also possesses a more metaphysical meaning in the language of the rabbis (\"qualities\", perhaps).</p>\n\n<p>According to some texts (such as Tosefta Sanhedrin 7:5 and Yerushalmi Pesachim 6:1), the progenitor of these middot was Hillel the Elder, and they are seven in number. According to other texts (such as a baraita recorded at the beginning of Sifra), they are thirteen in number and were developed by R' Ishmael. One formulation has them being thirty-two in number and attributed to R' Eliezer ben R' Yose haGelili, which is no longer found in its original source (a baraita), but which is alluded to by later commentators.</p>\n\n<p>For an English-language description of these middot and how they function, with examples, see Strack and Stemberger, <em>An Introduction to the Talmud and Midrash</em> (2nd ed; Fortress Press, 1996), 15-22. You may also find some useful information in the Wikipedia entry for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmudic_hermeneutics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Talmudic Hermeneutics</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In the Chumash העמק דבר , introduction to the Sefer Vayikro, the Netziv says </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“there are many droshos and halochos which Chazal did not learn in the\n  Sifro through some difficulty in the biblical text but because of the\n  traditions that they had from the Oral law” and this occurs frequently\n  in Vayikro.

    "content": "# How does Judaism views Secularism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In present day world, most of the democratic countries follow Secularism, i.e. separating state and religion. What is the opinion of Judaism on Secularism: Should a state following Halacha endorse Secularism? Should such a state keep religious matters separate from government?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>First of all, it cannot be emphasized enough that Judaism does not, and certainly since the days of the Sanhedrin, has not had, an official spokesman. Accordingly, it is essentially impossible to answer what Judaism thinks about this; only what individual Jewish scholars, basing themselves off, among other things, Jewish teachings, have held.</p>\n<p>That said, below are a couple of rabbbis' views on the relative merits of a secular democratic state, in which religious institutions are not granted authority over the masses, vs. a theocratic state.</p>\n<p>Here is what R. Shakh wrote about democracy (Mikhtavim u-Ma’amarim, vol. 5, p. 124):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בל נחשוב, שהשיטה הנקראת \"דמוקרטיה\" היא דבר חיובי . . . האמת היא שהיא אסון לעולם. היא נותנת הרגשה מדומה של \"חופש\" בו בזמן שלאמיתו של דבר היא רק הפקר, ותו לא . . . הדמוקרטיה היא דבר טרף, וכל כוונתם לעקור דרכה של עם ישראל ולהרסו</p>\n<p>That is: Do not think that the system called \"democracy\" is a positive thing... The truth is it a disaster to the world. It gives a false sense of \"freedom\" which while in fact it is just anarchy, nothing more. . . Democracy is something non-kosher, and their whole intention is to uproot to the path of the people of Israel and destroy it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On p. 127 he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואנו תפילה להרבונו של עולם, אנא פטור אותנו מקללת הדמוקרטיה החדשה שנשלחה לעולם, שהיא ממש כמו מחלת הסרטן שנשלחה לעולם. כי רק התורה הקדושה היא הדמוקרטיה האמיתית.</p>\n<p>And we pray to the Creator of the world, please rid us of the curse of the new democracy that was sent into the world, which is just like cancer which has been sent to the world. For only the Holy Torah is true democracy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>here is a passage, from R. Yissachar Meir, that appeared in an official Degel ha-Torah publication, Ve-Zarah ha-Shemesh (Bnei Brak, 1990), p. 630:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טעות אחת טעו מנהיגיה הראשונים של המדינה, הם חוקקו חוק הנקרא \"דמוקרטיה\". כל אחד יודע דמוקרטיה זו מהי, על פי השיכורים הנמצאים במדינה – שלוש מאות אלף מסוממים חיים במדינה – ועל פי זקנים מסוידים וכו' נקבע השלטון. כמו כן בכל מיני שוחד, ודרכי כפיה, נקבע ע\"י מה שנקרא \"בחירות\", איך תנהג המדינה בכל הנושאים העולים על הפרק. על פי דרך התורה, גדולי התורה הם הקובעים את המנהיגות.</p>\n<p>One wrong mistake the first leaders of the country, they passed a law called \"democracy\". Anyone know what the democracy is, according to the drunks who are in the country - three hundred thousand drug addicts live in - and according to old painted sheet set rule. Also all kinds of bribery and coercion methods, determined by the so-called \"elections\", how the state will handle all matters arising on the agenda. According to the way of the Torah, the Torah sages take precedence leadership.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Elhanan Wasserman writes in his Ikveta di-Meshiha, par. 2, published on the eve of the Holocaust.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגיע כבר העת שתבינו, כי בלעדי אין מושיע. אבל העם מסרבים להבין. עוד נאחזים בשולי הדמוקרטיה הגוססת. אף היא לא תועיל, בדומה לעבודות הזרות הקודמות.</p>\n<p>It's already time to understand that without me (God) there is no savior. But people refuse to understand. More cling to the edges of the dying democracy. Although it will not help, just like the former idolatries.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>All of the above quotes are found <a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2012/06/future-of-israeli-haredi-society-can.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.

This is significant since a communist state would be equipped to impose religious (or any other standards) on its citizens. This also demonstrates the degree of possible divergence of views within \"Judaism\".</p>\n<p>Although rabbis Shakh and Wasserman, et al were opposed to Secularism, R. Schlesinger decided to set up his own system. This system he outlined his book Kollel HaIvirim. He explains his system would be democratic. He explains that the Torah requires one to follow the majority. This is so, even when a Godol or the like holds different views. He proves this by pointing to the system of the Sanhedrin. There, they did not just go with greatest Rabbi on the Sanhedrin, rather, they started polling the views of the lowest one. (<a href=\"http://seforim.blogspot.com/2006_09_01_archive.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n<p>This system seems much more democratic, and thus closer to secularism.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Hirschensohn\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Hayyim Hirschenson</a> had positive feelings about democracy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Whatever secularism we endorse is due to some temporary benefit of this over its alternative. For example, if a secular Muslim is less dangerous than a religious one, we will endorse that. It all depends on the situation.</p>\n\n<p>The roots of evil such as jealousy, lust, and honor (avot 4:28) are not cured by secularism so we cannot give a general rule here of what's better than what. History shows all the philosophies out there <a href=\"http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/Why_Do_People_Hate_The_Jews.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">eventually lead to anti-semitism</a> anyways, so we have to play it by ear.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, the Jewish view is to endorse only the torah way as we say three times a day in our prayers (Aleinu)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore we put our hope in You, Adonai our God, to soon see the\n  glory of Your strength, to remove all idols from the Earth, and to\n  completely cut off all false gods; to repair the world to the Kingdom of God.

Even if we assume that this person has not fulfilled the obligation to sleep inside of a sukkah, because the majority of his body is not inside a single sukkah, he has not eaten outside of a sukkah either.

Through the Akeida, Hashem elevated Yitzchak and ultimately, Yitzchak's offspring to a Korban-status and dedicated them to Hashem.

Yosef Karo's uncle, R. Yitzchak Karo, the Sephardic practice prior to the Zohar was like the Rosh, to wear tefilin with a bracha (quoted in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1838&st=&pgnum=404\" rel=\"noreferrer\">שו\"ת בית יוסף, תש\"כ, עמ' שפה</a>). The Beit Yosef (או\"ח סי' לא) cites the Rashba in addition to the Zohar, as the source for the change in Sephardic practice. It isn't clear what Sephardic practice was prior to the Rosh, however it seems likely that it was not to wear. The Otzar ha-Geonim (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38272&st=&pgnum=81\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eruvin 192-193</a>) forbids tefilin. The BeHaG cites R. Yaakov ben Haviv as prohibiting (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20341&st=&pgnum=545\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hildesheimer ed., pp. 482-483</a>). The Sefer ha-Ittim also prohibits wearing tefilin (cited by the Rosh, Halakhot ketanot, tefilin 16). The Meiri cites the Sephardic practice as not to wear tefilin (Moed katan 18b). </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the sources to wear tefilin are Ashkenazi. The Sefer haTerumah proves from the fact that one can write tefilin on chol hamoed that it is a zman tefilin (hilkhot tefilin 213). The Hagaot Maimoniot says וכן הנהיגו כל רבותינו להניח תפילין בחול המועד. The Raavad (תמים דעים מ) says one is not obligated but if you want to wear, you should do so without a bracha. The Semak says to wear without a bracha (mitzva 150). The Rosh cites the Maharam as making a bracha. </p>\n\n<p>All these sources are from Jacob Katz's article about the topic in הלכה וקבלה. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The Ba'al Halochos Gedolos (a Gaon) is quoted as being of the opinion that Tefilin should not be worn on Chol Hamoed (I don't know off hand if that is found in the surviving versions of Halachos Gedolos, but it is quoted in Tosfos, referenced in the comments). So clearly (according to Tosphos) it is a practice that goes back to that time, different in different communities.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.aishdas.org/articles/tefillinChM.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for some further discussion on why they couldn't just look at the previous generation's practice and determine what the Halacha was. The upshot is that the author proposes that wearing Tefilin in past generations was more fluid, ideally worn all day, but with different circumstances requiring their removal. So seeing someone without Tefillin at a given time didn't settle the matter.</p>\n\n\n",

But if they're attracted to Halloween for other reasons, this might work for you.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Maybe what you're looking for is a way to communicate the idea in Deut 18:9-15... that the Israelites should be different from the other nations and stay away from magical/idolatrous obsessions or attempts at power that bypass God. In the spiritual realm Jews have only one, very special, relationship. Even so, God would give a better replacement for those things (v. 15).</p>\n\n<p>Like Monica mentioned in her comment, there are lots of reasons why kids might find it hard to hear that message. If it's candy and costumes then Judaism isn't lacking, but if it's the spookiness they like or the desire to fit in with other kids on that day it is harder. Somehow, if you want to get the real reason across, I think you would need to find an appropriate way to touch on the pagan associations that are involved and how Hashem taught the Israelites not to delve into that kind of thing (even just for fun) like other nations did. And then the focus has got to be all on the holiness, beauty, value, and life that happens in Yiddishkeit when that commandment of God is really honoured! The best way might be with stories... maybe they will be inspired by stories of people and communities who cared about holiness instead of being interested by foreign spirituality. Maybe you could encourage them to have a special emphasis that week on the value of set-apartness and how special the Jewish traditions are, e.g. families (or you as a group) prepare an extra special Shabbos meal or make some kind of film together along the lines of \"it is a tree of life to those who grasp it...\" and how that fits into our lives. Maybe you could even look at how Jews in many cultures express their Judaism in both similar and different ways from each other, and stir up appreciation for the value of what makes them different from the cultures around (even while communicating appreciation for the positive things in other nations too).</p>\n\n<p>I don't really know how to make that appeal to this age group, but if the aesthetic and the inspiration of this concept can drown out the aesthetic and peer pressure of Halloween, then you will be sharing something special that you really believe is the reason. As long as they see real depth, intricacy, worth, and enjoyment in their own heritage then they won't feel like the command to stay away from pagan things (in order to protect the unique relationship with God) makes them miss out. It's giving up a small and hollow thing in order to get a real treasure, which is worthwhile in ways that can appeal to everyone because it's that big and good.</p>\n\n<p>Probably helps to get older teens who feel the same way you do in on it as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>BS\"D</p>\n\n<p>Raised as a Christian, at points in my life according to a protestant Christian tradition in which we also did NOT celebrate Halloween, I made Teshuva as an adult (who has not yet been blessed with marriage and children...may this soon change, if Hashem so wills it ~ IYH, Inshallah).</p>\n\n<p>As an adult Baalat Teshuva, I do not celebrate Halloween, according to Halakha, nor do I encourage those within my family who are non-observant to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Based upon my own past experiences, I agree with those above who identify the two major concerns that children have about not celebrating a non-Jewish, secular holiday with pagan (and idolatrous!) roots such as Halloween (as well as JCmas, as celebrated):  (1) feeling deprived of the joys and \"fun\" of the experience ~ dressing up, sweets, celebrations, and (2)  feeling \"left out\" or \"apart from the others\".</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that (1) alternative joyful experiences can always be created within the home, among family and/or fellow members of one's community, in a manner that does not validate that which is contrary to our tradition in any way, and that (2) it is a very important lesson in life for a child to CHOOSE early on that who he or she is, and his or her relationship with Hashem, is cherished, and to be defended in the face of pressure to \"follow everyone else\".</p>\n\n<p>Though younger children are incapable of understanding Torah foundations more deeply, older children certainly are, with the help of an adult (especially a parent) willing to take the time and care to discuss with them...      </p>\n\n\n",

The fact that someone wants you to write to them at Pesach time doesn't mean they don't know what date you will celebrate it. The fact that people weren't keeping the Shabbat day doesn't mean no one knew about it. Sending people plain instructions about celebrating Pesach doesn't mean they couldn't access the information anywhere else, any more than when synagogues send out the same information in their email newsletters. And so on.</p>\n\n<p>You can't know for sure from historical evidence if one person did write the Torah. What kind of evidence could you expect to survive for that? The only way to know it is if you decide that the Jewish testimony is valid and trustworthy about their own beliefs, and this kind of thing in particular.</p>\n\n<p>(Edit:)\nWe can also learn from the way this is discussed in the Talmud, in Baba Batra 15a:</p>\n\n<p>\"The Master has said: Joshua wrote the book which bears his name and the last eight verses of the Pentateuch. This statement is in agreement with the authority who says that eight verses in the Torah were written by Joshua, as it has been taught: [It is written], So Moses the servant of the Lord died there. Now is it possible that Moses being dead could have written the words, 'Moses died there'? The truth is, however, that up to this point Moses wrote, from this point Joshua wrote. This is the opinion of R. Judah, or, according to others, of R. Nehemiah. Said R. Simeon to him: Can [we imagine the] scroll of the Law being short of one word, and is it not written, Take this book of the Law? No; what we must say is that up to this point the Holy One, blessed be He, dictated and Moses repeated and wrote, and from this point God dictated and Moses wrote with tears...\"</p>\n\n<p>So- can you see how even the rabbis debated about part of this question? I'm no expert in this, but here is my understanding. The people who said Moses wrote the whole thing did so on the basis of their general understanding of Judaism, Torah and truth. If they were wrong about this minor detail it doesn't destroy Judaism at all. but many Jews agree with the authority of this speculation and go by it.</p>\n\n<p>(Keep in mind that some historical ideas seem to have been speculation/opinions, while other things are believed to be real things remembered through history... such as the giving of the Torah.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hints and thoroughness in Talmudic referencing of Tanach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are times when the Talmud uses references to Tanach that do not seem to be proofs per se. They may not follow the middot and are more like hints. This has been discussed in answers to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31622/seemingly-weak-proof-texts-from-tanach\">another</a> question I asked.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I was reading theories in the Talmud about the relationship between Ktav Ivri and Ktav Ashuri in the historical writing of sacred texts, eg. the Torah scroll. One of the places where it's mentioned is in Sanhedrin <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_21.html#PARTb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">21b</a> (the end) and <a href=\"http://www.halakhah.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_22.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">22a</a>. You can see how \"the mishnah of this Torah\" was read so as to imply a changed script. And the other references to Ezra ascending from Babylon, the writing Daniel saw on the wall, \"that which was foretold would change,\" and \"I have set God before me always\"... They aren't plain readings and so seem more like hints for already-formed historical speculations and/or traditions rather than proofs.</p>\n\n<p>One answer mentioned how in the Chumash העמק דבר , introduction to the Sefer Vayikro, the Netziv says:</p>\n\n<p>“there are many droshos and halochos which Chazal did not learn in the Sifro through some difficulty in the biblical text but because of the traditions that they had from the Oral law” and this occurs frequently in Vayikro. He further says, “there is no tradition that is not hinted at in the biblical text” and “if these laws were not authorised from the Oral Law, they would not have been derived from the biblical text.” Even though this is about law, I guess it would also apply to history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So I'd like to know...</strong></p>\n\n<p>1) How could he know that “there is no tradition that is not hinted at in the biblical text”? And would you agree that a high level of significance was placed in the hints? Even though they are only being used as anchors rather than proofs, the fact that they exist does seem to have a lot of resonance to the rabbis here. That gives me a foreign feeling and I want to understand how they really thought.</p>\n\n<p>2) Maybe on top of just an interest in hints, they used seemingly random verses due to a desire to be thorough or find intricate connectedness. To take every theory and talk about whether it indeed could harmonise with all of the verses that had come to be seen as somehow relevant to the topic. For example, certain verses may have been part of the discussion for one reason or another, and then each opinion would talk about their interpretation of such verses... <em>not as necessarily relevant to their own</em>, not always as proof of anything (when they knew they weren't bringing the plain meaning), but just in the desire to show that their possible answer was engaging with every little place of the discussion in a unified way. Would this be considered a fair idea about their intentions, or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a name for this. It is called an \"asmachta\"</p>\n\n<p>Due to some grammatical and theological issues, the statement by the Netziv is misleading as translated.</p>\n\n<p>When he writes:  \"“there is no tradition that is not hinted at in the biblical text” What he means is the following.</p>\n\n<p>For every oral tradition that was not based on the text of the Torah, there is a pasuk which has been assigned to that oral tradition, as an aide to memory. (Rambam, intro to the Mishna)</p>\n\n<p>Normally, if I am not mistaken, the first hint that something is an asmachta and not a proof text, is the fact that the verse is from Neviim or Ketuvim,and not a pasuk from the Torah.  But sometimes pasuks from the Torah are used as an ashmachta as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Like Avi said, this is called an Asmachta (אסמכתא), usually translated as \"hints.\"  The Talmud uses these is many cases, both for laws which are DeOraita (mentioned in the Torah) and DeRabbannan (rabbinic).  For the DeOraita, the hint is used a memory device to remember the law.  For the DeRabbannan, the are several opinions why the rabbis did this.  Some say it was to lend weight and authority to the law, so that people would consider it to be as strong as a DeOraita.  Others say it these Torah itself was hinting to these laws in these verses, and that it was divine will that these rabbinic enactments come to pass.  Yet others hold that it was not the Torah that was hinting, but the rabbis, who somehow understood that this is what the verse was supposed to mean. </p>\n\n<p>There were later rabbis who argued on these hints, and claimed that it the hint clearly went against the meaning of the verse, then it wasn't an authentic hint.  (This did not appear to have any affect on the effectiveness of the rabbinic law in question.)</p>\n\n<p>[ Source: אנציקלופדיה תלמודית Encyclopedia Talmudit ]</p>\n\n<p>I have not read the Netziv, and will not comment on issue #1.  Regarding issue #2:\nI think this would be a \"fair\" idea, although I'm very unsure it's what they were doing.  Your interpretation, with its holistic \"intricate connectedness\" has a very modern feel to it.  But, as they say, there are 70 faces to Torah, so maybe.</p>\n\n\n",

An event such as a huge mass revelation from God would not have been accepted if it was just made up by someone generations later. All Jews who have believed this, unless they were converts, believed that their parents also knew about it.</p></li>\n<li><p>We know that the probability of a false religion being made up about individual revelation is high, because it has happened many times in history. But since there has only been one claim of the national revelation, it cannot be explained as a probable simply-natural event.</p></li>\n<li><p>The survival of the Jewish people is extraordinary, in situations where they should have assimilated or been wiped out, throughout history, according to the nature of what happens with other nations. In the first Temple period, they were at a crossroads of military traffic and cultural influence, and yet 'uniquely unique' aspects of believing only in the creator God, not attributing a form to Him, keeping Jewish ritual law, and such were preserved and revived throughout that time. After that, the periods of persecution and at times immense scattering and attempts to wipe them out, traditional Judaism still preserved the Jewish people. This does not usually happen at all with nations that are scattered or under pressure in a similar way. This shows that an agent controlling history probably has a personal interest in the Jews and, because the likelihood of it happening for natural reasons is low</p></li>\n<li><p>There’s a recognisable connection between the felt-to-be-good values of Judaism, the beautiful qualities of Torah-observant families, the clarity of Jewish worship of God, and the historical fact of Jewish continuity.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I bring these four points because they are the strongest to me out of the logical, verbalised points I have heard, and yet I feel they are lacking as well. <strong>I'll write their weaknesses, as I see them, here. I would love to know if anyone has read or thought of any answers to points below, or found any other good perspectives to catch your attention on an objective level.</strong></p>\n\n<p>To 1.: I never hear the idea addressed that it may not have been one person or institution that made the story from scratch, but rather a gradual development. People may already have been practising Torah laws and attributed them to Moses and some kind of divine authority, with a reality based-story of escaping from Egypt. Then, the idea of the whole nation hearing a revelation directly from God could have been added into the story later, and it would not have seemed unfamiliar or unlikely to the hearers.</p>\n\n<p>To 2 and 3.: Everyone knows that the Jews are unique. What made them so unique is another question, but it's sure that there are aspects of tradition, paradigms, and ritual that do make the religion a naturally surviving one. Laws about kosher, intermarriage, and a strong loyalty to the creator of the all at this. How do we know that without supernatural intervention, the survival even in such normally-unlikely contexts <em>would</em> have been highly improbable, because of these unique circumstances? It is almost untestable. And how do we know that it wasn't this unique circumstance that also allowed the claim of national revelation to emerge just once? It is very uncommon, but does that make it more likely to be supernatural or simply another uncommon natural event?</p>\n\n<p>To 4.: A lot of this perception may be subjective, based on upbringing... Even though that can't be ignored. We just have to be careful with it.</p>\n\n<p>(None of this in itself makes Judaism seem unlikely to me. The opposite; there are some very good points that matter a lot to consider. I'm just pointing out issues with these arguments, and <strong>hoping to hear some good insights to fill in the gaps</strong>.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>(Caveat: Arguments 1-3 are fully addressed and fleshed out in R' Lawrence Kelemen's booklet, <em>Permission to receive</em>, and R' Dr Dovid Gottlieb's book, <em>Reason to believe</em>.</p>\n<p>This is a layperson's understanding of the answers to some of your points.)</p>\n<p>Regarding 1:</p>\n<p>To begin with, any such \"gradual development\" needs to have occurred in the window between the alleged Sinai revelation and the dead sea scrolls.</p>\n<p>Secondly, any tradition, especially a nationally-accepted one, has significant weight in terms of knowledge of truth. For example, the reason we know that in 1776, the United States of America declared independence from Great Britain is not because (in the most case) we have studied contemporary accounts, made archealogical discoveries, or in any other way come to the knowledge of this event <em>independently</em>. Instead, we rely on what we have been taught (again, for the most part), with the understanding that for what we have been taught to be false, would require a <em>significant conspiracy of mass deceit</em>. (Obviously, the events of 1776 are far more verifiable than events over 3 millenia ago. But regardless, the weight of tradition has an automatic assumption of truth, and the onus is on the skeptic to prove any conjectured alternative.)</p>\n<p>In general, the assumption that changes occured to the Sinai narrative over time have no corroboration or alignment with any independent contemporary account or archealogical evidence, so the text, as it stands, should be accepted as truth, in the presence of such tradition, and in the absence of meaningful disproof (proof of forgery or amendation). I guess it depends on what you mean by \"show high probability\".</p>\n<p>Regarding 2:</p>\n<p>I don't understand your counterargument. The point is simple: Take event X. If event X occurs once every decade, or even once every generation, then X can be ascribed to natural conditions (natural = within nature). if X has occured <em><strong>once</strong></em> in human history, then either the natural conditions that cause such an event are exceptionally rare, OR they aren't natural. Statistically speaking, one of those 2 interpretations is more likely - regardless of how scientific it is.</p>\n<p>I don't have a defence of point 3 at the moment, but the books I mention are worth a look - I'm sure they address your point.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In a related point I once made a little list, of the most convincing proofs or quasi-proofs (proofs that wouldnt pass scientific muster, but that nearly everyone could agree are more than remarkable) it included some of your 4 points and some additional points.<br />\nI wonder if anyone can add to my list?</p>\n<p>The Torah commanding Aliyah leregel leaving all lands defenceless 3 times a yr on a prearranged calendar date, ripe for invasion must be with the protection of God.\nThe Torah commanding shmitta and yovel demanding cessation of livelihoods with a corresponding promise of brocho for those years.\nThe Torah being the only such type of document that openly shares the failures of it heroes?\nThe kiddush hashem of our gedolim both past and present, pictures of simplicity humility and shouldering the burden of the nation.

Folklorist Haim Schwarzbaum claims that versions of this story stretch back to Aesopic tradition, and in the Jewish world, to Berechiah ben Natronai's (13th c.) fable of the Fox and the Crane (cf. Schwarzbaum's <em>Studies in Jewish and World Folklore</em>). In Berechiah's story, the Crane punishes the greedy Fox by inviting him to a meal; the food is stuck deep in a tree that requires a long beak, leaving the Fox starving (the tale can be read in the translated <em>Fables of a Jewish Aesop</em>).</p>\n\n<p><strong>However</strong>, if you're looking for the first printed source that attributes the story to R. Haim visiting heaven and hell, then that source is a Hebrew anthology of Jewish humor called <em>Sefer habedichah vehachidud</em> [The Book of Jokes and Riddles] collected by the Lithuanian writer and researcher Alter Druyanov (1870-1938). The anthology was first published in 1935, and the original story in question appears in the second volume under the section titled \"<em>bein adam l'chavero</em>\" [between man and fellow]. It goes like this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>: רבי חיים רומשישקר דרש ברבים וסיפר</p>\n  \n  <p>פעם אחת עליתי לשמים ונכנסתי לגיהנום.  נסתכלתי וראיתי: זקנים וצעירים יושבים שורות־שורות לפני שולחנות מלאים כל־טוב, ובידו של כל אחד ואחד קשורה כף ארוכה, ולהגיעה לפיו אינו יכול מחמת אורכה.  וכך היו יושבים כולם שורה כנגד שורה ונפשם יבישה וצער גדול כבוש בפניהם.  ניגשתי לאחד מהם ואמרתי לו: ״שוטה שבעולם ! עד שעיניך רואות כל טוב וכלות, שלח את הכף הקשורה בידך ופרנס את חברך היושב ממולך ויחזור הוא ויפרנס אותך בכף הקשורה בידו״ </p>\n  \n  <p>: הציץ עלי האיש בעיניים זעומות והחזיר לי</p>\n  \n  <p>״מוטב, שתהיינה עיני רואות וכלות כל היום משאראה אותו נהנה ושבע שעה\n   אחת״. נבהלתי לשמוע ופתחתי פי לצעוק צעקה גדולה והקיצותי</p>\n  \n  <p>Rabbi Haim Romshishker publicly expounded and told the following:</p>\n  \n  <p>Once, I went up into the sky and also entered hell. I looked around and saw: old and young men sitting rows upon rows in front of tables that were full of all the best things, each holding a long spoon in hand. And when one reached for his mouth, he wouldn't be able to because of the spoon's length. And so they all sat row against row with their souls dry and a great sorrow rested on their faces. I went over to one of them and said to him: \"A fool in the world! Rather your eyes seeing all this goodness and craving, send the spoon that is attached to your hand and support your friend who sits opposite you. And he will, in turn, support you with the spoon attached to his hand.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>The man looked at me with meager eyes and replied:</p>\n  \n  <p>\"It would better for my eyes to see and crave all day long than for me to see him enjoy and be satiated. \n  \" I was alarmed to hear this, so I opened my mouth to scream a loud\n  scream and woke up.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This can be found in two back-to-back verses in Genesis, Gen. 25:5 and 6.  The translation of the first is “And Abraham gave everything he possessed to Issac.”  The very next sentence is “And to the sons of Abraham’s concubines, Abraham gave gifts, and he sent them away… eastward, to the land of the East.”  The obvious question, of course, is “If Abraham gave everything he possessed to Issac, what gifts did he have left to give to the sons of his concubines?”  The answer is gifts of knowledge.  (“Gifts” here is also spelled strangely to indicate that there is something unusual about them.)   A short while (100-200 years) after they were sent out eastward to the land of the East, the Brahmins entered India from the northwest (traveling eastward).  The name of BRaHMa is the same as aBRaHaM.  The name of Brahma’s consort is Sara, as Abraham’s wife.  (She is commonly called Sarasvati, but the suffix -svati is an honorific – the name itself is Sara.)   Furthermore, the names of some cities in the northeast of India, where the Brahmins entered, are similar to some of the names of Abraham’s sons.</p>\n\n<p>ADDITION: Rav Yaakov Weinberg zt\"l makes this assertion, not with the same level of historical analysis but he definitely says that Avraham's children who went to the East became the roots of Eastern religion. He explains that their focus on pure Being and a Oneness of Existence is predicated on the Middah of Chessed, without ever taking it further to Din as Yitzchak did.

Sometime later he told over what he had done to a Rov who informed him that he shouldn't have done this. However the question is now, what should be done?</p>\n\n<p>Should he,\n1) Leave the straps where they are on the Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin\n2) Put them back on the original Rashi Tefillin that he had them on to begin with\n3) Take them off and put them in geniza</p>\n\n<p>I'll raise a few points (unorganized) for why some of the reasons would be better over the others. Number 3 is the easy eitzah since it removes all problems. However there is a Taz in OC Siman 154 that says if one can't be \"raise up\" a certain object to a higher kedusha he should use it for what he can, rather than put it in genizah. Therefore that could be the reason for number 1. Or as well because he was already \"m'kadesh\" the ratzuos to the R\"T tefillin and shouldn't move them now to Rashi -- according to those (al pi kabballah) that one shouldn't change from Rabbeinu Tam to Rashi (and perhaps no reason to put them in genizah then as well.) The reason to put them back on Rashi is to raise them in kedusha and put them back in their proper place (since really the \"hekdesh\" was b'to'es - done as a mistake.) </p>\n\n<p>These are just some thoughts and possibilities to consider. I'm looking for a clear proof in halacha for one way or another. And of course what any poskim said about such a question.</p>\n\n<p>(BTW the Rov involved in the story told him to do the 3rd option with a twist. He decided he would use the ratzuos for a pair of tefillin that he was putting together for an older bal teshuva getting his first pair of tefillin. However his proof or reasoning I unfortunately didn't hear, that's why I'm bringing the question here now.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Opinion that nusach Ashkenaz and Sefard are the same",
    "content": "# Opinion that nusach Ashkenaz and Sefard are the same\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I remember hearing an opinion somewhere that nusach Ashkenaz and nusach Sefard (but not real nusach Sfaradi/Edot Hamizrach!) are both basically the same nusach, since they are structurally very similar. I think this would mean that a chazan in an Ashkenazic kehillah could use either nusach without worrying about lo tisgodedu. Is this a real opinion, and if so, who brought it down?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are many differences between Nusach Ashkenaz, the traditional German and Lithuanian nusach, and Nusach Sefard, the Chassidishe nusach. One way they are different is in the way the prayers are ordered. I've included the order of Pesukei D'zimrah for weekdays for both nusachim:</p>\n\n<p><strong>נוסח אשכנז פסוקי דזמרה לחול</strong></p>\n\n<p>תהילים ל,\nקדיש יתום,\nהריני מזמן...בשם כל ישראל,\nברוך שאמר,\nהודו,\nתהילים ק,\nיהי כבוד,\nאשרי,\nתהילים קמו,\nתהילים קמז,\nתהילים קמח,\nתהילים קמט,\nתהילים קנ,\nברוך ה' לעולם אמן ואמן...אמן ואמן,\nויברך,\nוכרות, \nויושע,\nאז-ישיר-משה,\nישתבח,\nחצי קדיש</p>\n\n<p><strong>נוסח ספרד פסוקי דזמרה לחול</strong></p>\n\n<p>הודו,\nתהילים ל,\nה' מלך...ושמו אחד,\nהושיענו...קה, הללוקה,\nתהילים סז,\nהריני מזמן...בשם כל ישראל,\nברוך שאמר,\nתהילים ק,\nיהי כבוד,\nאשרי,\nתהילים קמו,\nתהילים קמז,\nתהילים קמח,\nתהילים קמט,\nתהילים קנ,\nברוך ה' לעולם אמן ואמן...אמן ואמן,\nויברך,\nוכרות,\nויושע,\nאז-ישיר-משה,\nישתבח,\nחצי קדיש</p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the order of the prayers differs between the two nusachim. But there's more than just order that makes them different. A few textual differences (there are many between the two, here are just some examples):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Mourner's Kaddish is included after Psalm 30 in Nusach Ashkenaz, but in Nusach Sefard it is not there.</p></li>\n<li><p>Boruch She'omar differs slightly between them. Here's how Nusach Ashkenaz begins Boruch She'omar:</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ברוך שאמר והיה העולם, ברוך הוא. ברוך עשה בראשית, ברוך אומר ועשה, ברוך גוזר ומקים, ברוך מרחם על הארץ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And here's how Nusach Sefard begins it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ברוך שאמר והיה העולם, ברוך הוא. ברוך אומר ועשה, ברוך גוזר ומקים, ברוך עשה בראשית, ברוך מרחם על הארץ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There's clearly some differences here.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Yishtabach differs majorly between the two. Here's how Nusach Ashkenaz renders it:</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישתבח שמך לעד מלכנו, הקל המלך הגדול והקדוש, בשמים ובארץ. כי לך נאה, ה' אלקינו ואלקי אבותינו, שיר ושבחה, הלל וזמרה, עז וממשלה, נצח, גדלה וגבורה, תהילה ותפארת, קדשה ומלכות, ברכות והודאות מעתה ועד עולם. ברוך אתה ה', קל מלך גדול בתשבחות, קל ההודאות, אדון הנפלאות, הבוחר בשירי זמרה, מלך, קל, חי העולמים.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And here's how Nusach Sefard renders it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ישתבח שמך לעד מלכנו, הקל המלך הגדול והקדוש, בשמים ובארץ. כי לך נאה, ה' אלקינו ואלקי אבותינו, שיר ושבחה, הלל וזמרה, עז וממשלה, נצח גדלה וגבורה, תהילה ותפארת, קדשה ומלכות, ברכות והודאות לשמך הגדול והקדוש, ומעולם ועד עולם אתה קל. ברוך אתה ה', קל מלך גדול ומהלל בתשבחות, קל ההודאות, אדון הנפלאות, בורא כל הנשמות, רבון כל המעשים, הבוחר בשירי זמרה, מלך יחיד קל חי העולמים. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>LOTS OF DIFFERENCE. And this is just in Pesukei D'zimrah for weekdays. Some other differences in the Shacharis for Shabbos include the inclusion of L'chai Olamim, even though most Nusach Sefard congregations don't recite it aloud, and more. One big difference is right here:</p>\n\n<p>Nusach Ashkenaz</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוכן עד מרום וקדוש שמו. וכתוב: רננו צדיקים בה', לישרים נאוה תהילה:\n  בפי ישרים תתהלל, ובדברי צדיקים תתברך, ובלשון חסידים תתרומם, ובקרב קדושים תתקדש.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nusach Sefard</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שוכן עד מרום וקדוש שמו: וכתוב: רננו צדיקים בה', לישרים נאוה תהילה: בפי ישרים תתרומם, ובשפתי צדיקים תתברך, ובלשון חסידים תתקדש, ובקרב קדושים תתהלל.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Clearly different as well.</p>\n\n<p>As for Shemoneh Esrei, some people have informed me that the ArtScroll Nusach Ashkenaz and Nusach Sefard differ in this regard. However, I've davened from both and haven't found any differences. If anyone would like to show me the differences IN AN ARTSCROLL SIDDUR (I'm sure the Shemoneh Esrei is different in other Nusach Sefard publications), I would really like to see them. To my knowledge, since ArtScroll-Mesorah is a primarily Litvish publishing company, their Shemoneh Esrei doesn't change between the nusachim. </p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps. And a lot of the portions I've listed are recited by the chazzan, so a person who davens Nusach Sefard might have a hard time following in a shul that uses Nusach Ashkenaz or vice versa. </p>\n\n<p>By the way, I've used סדור תפארת צבי for the Nusach Ashkenaz, and סדור תפארת יעקב for the Nusach Sefard. Both are printed by ArtScroll and are both all-Hebrew editions.)</p>\n\n\n",

The Ammonites came and seized it from Hadrimon the son of Tabrimon. Jehoshaphat came and seized it from the Ammonites, and it remained so until Ahaz, when Sennacherib came and took it from Ahaz. Then Hezekiah came and took it from Sennacherib, and it remained thus until Zedekiah, when the Babylonians [Chaldeans] came and seized it from Zedekiah. The Persians came and took it from the Chaldeans; the Greeks came and took it from the Persians . the Romans came and took it from the Greeks, and it is still lying in Rome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Two things strike me in this passage.  First, this great pile of wealth wasn't subdivided and distributed; according to the g'mara it's all in a pile in Rome.  And second, this is all the wealth of the world.</p>\n\n<p>But we have material wealth now, and we know that other conquests throughout history have involved redistribution of captured property.

The result of succeeding as the Torah nation would be the fact that we would have subjugated even worldly power for the pursuit of good instead of evil. Solomon achieved close to perfection in this regard for Israel. The next generations could have increasingly brought this ideology to the whole world. However, his son Rechavam floundered in the national Torah mandate, so the \"wealth of Egypt\" returned so to speak to its worldly address. The Jews lost out on their higher mission to get the whole world to recognize that power should be used for good only.</p>\n\n<p>Kings Assa, Jehoshaphat, and Hezekiah, were all righteous. So, in their times, Israel got another chance to re-establish the level of control over worldly influence. Alas, Israel let the mandate slip again under succeeding mistakes and evil leaders. The great prize of worldly potential for goodness then rolled on through the exiles awaiting the full return of the Jewish people out of exile mentality. When this will be realized, Moshiach will turn the power of the world towards goodness permanently.</p>\n\n\n",

This motivation made their desire for a king contemptible (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=24&daf=20b&format=text\"><em>Sanhedrin</em> 20b</a>; <em>Sh'muel</em> I, 8:7-8; cf. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0517.htm\"><em>D'varim</em> 17:14-15</a>), despite the fact that, according to some opinions, there is a biblical obligation to appoint a king (see the dispute in <em>Sanhedrin</em> 20b; <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?sefer=14&hilchos=83&perek=1&hilite=\">Rambam <em>Hil. M'lachim</em> 1:1</a> follows the view that it is an obligation). </p>\n\n<p>The Ramban comments (<em>D'varim</em> 17:14) that although the verses in <em>D'varim</em> indicate a command to appoint a king, the verse merely predicts that the people would want to be like the other nations. Such a desire is not part of the command to appoint a king, nor is it praiseworthy. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (ibid.) notes that the passage in <em>Sh'muel</em> I indicates competing motives in asking for a king; the elders properly requested a powerful authority figure to replace Sh'muel and judge the people after Sh'muel's own sons proved unworthy (8:5), while the masses (whom the Talmud calls \"ignoramuses\") erred in wanting a king to judge them and lead them in battle so that they would be more like the other nations (8:19-20).* </p>\n\n<p>The general question of why a king might have been considered more suitable than a <em>shofeit</em> (loosely translated as \"judge\") for waging war is a good one. See the Abarbanel's <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14367&pgnum=94\">introduction to <em>Shoftim</em></a>, where he enumerates five similarities (perhaps not all undisputed) between a king and a <em>shofeit</em>, including their leadership roles in battle and their command authority over all Jews. This question deserves an extensive treatment. Briefly, I think one approach is that judges did not always have the practical ability to unite all the tribes behind them in war. Two examples of this are Devorah (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0705.htm\"><em>Shoftim</em> 5:14-18</a>) and Gid'on (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0707.htm\">ibid. 7:23</a>). An annointed central figure would have undisputed authority among all Israel, and would thus be better suited to organizing the entire nation's efforts in battle.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>*<sub>According to this approach, the phrasing of the elders \"שִׂימָה לָּנוּ מֶלֶךְ לְשָׁפְטֵנוּ כְּכָל הַגּוֹיִם\" may be taken as explanatory, while the phrasing of the masses \"וְהָיִינוּ גַם אֲנַחְנוּ כְּכָל הַגּוֹיִם... וְנִלְחַם אֶת מִלְחֲמֹתֵנוּ\" suggests a desire to imitate the other nations as well as a lack of faith in the Almighty's ability to lead them to military victory. Alternatively, as perhaps suggested by the negative response to the original request, the first request \"שִׂימָה לָּנוּ מֶלֶךְ לְשָׁפְטֵנוּ כְּכָל הַגּוֹיִם\" may have come from the people as well as from the elders, and the elders might not have been the ones who stated any comparison with other nations.</sub></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Doors and Doorways in Parshat Vayeira\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In this week's parsha of Vayeira, I counted 6 references to the words דלת and פתח, all in the story of Lot and Sodom. I don't believe this is a coincidence, since it's all about standing in the door, opening the door, closing the door, all of which is irrelevant information. It must be teaching something.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Genesis 19: 6-11</p>\n<p>ו  וַיֵּצֵא אֲלֵהֶם לוֹט, <strong>הַפֶּתְחָה</strong>; <strong>וְהַדֶּלֶת</strong>, סָגַר אַחֲרָיו.\n6 And Lot went out unto them to the <strong>door</strong>, and shut the <strong>door</strong> after him.</p>\n<p>ט  וַיֹּאמְרוּ גֶּשׁ-הָלְאָה, וַיֹּאמְרוּ הָאֶחָד בָּא-לָגוּר\nוַיִּשְׁפֹּט שָׁפוֹט--עַתָּה, נָרַע לְךָ מֵהֶם; וַיִּפְצְרוּ בָאִישׁ\nבְּלוֹט מְאֹד, וַיִּגְּשׁוּ לִשְׁבֹּר <strong>הַדָּלֶת</strong>.   9 And they said:\n'Stand back.' And they said: 'This one fellow came in to sojourn, and\nhe will needs play the judge; now will we deal worse with thee, than\nwith them.' And they pressed sore upon the man, even Lot, and drew\nnear to break the <strong>door</strong>.</p>\n<p>י  וַיִּשְׁלְחוּ הָאֲנָשִׁים אֶת-יָדָם, וַיָּבִיאוּ אֶת-לוֹט אֲלֵיהֶם\nהַבָּיְתָה; וְאֶת-<strong>הַדֶּלֶת</strong>, סָגָרוּ.  10 But the men put forth their\nhand, and brought Lot into the house to them, and the <strong>door</strong> they shut.</p>\n<p>יא  וְאֶת-הָאֲנָשִׁים אֲשֶׁר-<strong>פֶּתַח</strong> הַבַּיִת, הִכּוּ בַּסַּנְוֵרִים,\nמִקָּטֹן, וְעַד-גָּדוֹל; וַיִּלְאוּ, לִמְצֹא <strong>הַפָּתַח</strong>.    11 And they\nsmote the men that were at the <strong>door</strong> of the house with blindness, both\nsmall and great; so that they wearied themselves to find the <strong>door</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An even bigger mystery is the corresponding haftarah in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt09b04.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2 Kings Chapter 4</a> made 5 references to the words דלת, פתח, (in reference to closing a door:) סגור.</p>\n<p>What is the significance of this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Firstly, yasher kochacho on a really good observation!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mizrachi.org/speaker/rabbi-yosef-zvi-rimon/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Yosef Tzvi Rimon</a> makes an interesting analysis <a href=\"https://www1.biu.ac.il/indexE.php?id=19368&pt=1&pid=14327&level=0&cPath=43,14206,14211,14327,19368#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>He notes that there are interesting parallels with the story of Sodom and Pesach which is highlighted by this constant repetition of \"door\".</p>\n<p>On the pasuk in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 19:3</a> -\nוַיִּפְצַר־בָּ֣ם מְאֹ֔ד וַיָּסֻ֣רוּ אֵלָ֔יו וַיָּבֹ֖אוּ אֶל־בֵּית֑וֹ וַיַּ֤עַשׂ לָהֶם֙ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה <strong>וּמַצּ֥וֹת אָפָ֖ה</strong> וַיֹּאכֵֽלוּ׃ -\n<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.3?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.19.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> clearly states that he was baking these matzos as it was Pesach (referencing <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.48.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 48:12</a>).</p>\n<p>What follows is Lot is stuck in house with the malachim guarding him, then rescuing him and overturning Sodom. A close examination on the pasukim shows incredible similarities between what happened in Sodom and the Bnei Yisroel's salvation from Egypt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4jmrb.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4jmrb.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Rav Rimon asserts:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>The parallels attest to an amazing similarity between the two events: a closed house, a Destroyer, angels that destroy the wicked and save the good, departing from a certain place in the wake of a command (“Up, get out”), not delaying (Lot, unlike the Israelites, delayed and the angels had to drag him out themselves), and events that take place throughout the night.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the first raft of \"door\" emphasis mirrors the experience in Mitzrayim where the Jews painted blood on the door frame and lintel so that the Malach Hamoveis would 'pass over' their door and target only the Egyptians. Equally, here the place of Sodom had been decreed to be destroyed through a heavenly force (i.e. angels) and Lot was safe on the other side of the door. Indeed (l'fi ani da'ati) this tallies with the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.9?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.19.9.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak's</a> definition of door on 19:9 -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>הדלת</strong>. הִיא הַסּוֹבֶבֶת לִנְעֹל וְלִפְתֹּחַ - הדלת</p>\n<p><strong>THE DOOR</strong> — This term דלת signifies the wooden frame-work which swings round on hinges to close and open the entrance (cf. Verse 11).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A second parallel Rav Rimon notes is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Both called for performing an act that endangered the one who did it, thus attesting that the person had rejected the ways of his environment: Lot took a risk by taking in guests and thus demonstrated his rejection of the society of Sodom; the Israelites slaughtered a lamb, an Egyptian deity, thus showing their severance from Egypt.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, (again my analysis) the repetition of \"door\" helps bring this out. Sodom stood for being anti-hospitable, i.e. this meant not opening up your homes to guests. Yet, this mindset was antithetical to Lot who grew up in the house of Avraham and was regularly used to an 'open door' policy.</p>\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>As far as why there has to be this connection with Pesach, I would posit that possibly because the whole message of Matzah (i.e. poor man's bread) is on Pesach to remember that we are now free<sup>1</sup> - we were saved and were zoche to a miraculous redemption. So perhaps in much the same way, we focus on it being Pesach by Lot because he too experienced a miraculous redemption - and the repetition of 'doors' helps to draw parallels.</p>\n<p>Using this a baseline, perhaps it is this connection which ties in with the Haftarah. In the same way Lot was afforded Divine intervention similar to that of the Pesach story through agents of Hashem, we likewise have two instances where both a widow and the Isha Shunamis are sent a heavenly salvation through a shaliach i.e. Eliyahu HaNavi. The repetition of door helps to demonstrate as it was the channel through which these miracles were wrought. Indeed <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.4.4?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_II_Kings.4.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> on Melachim II 4:4 writes that the reason why the door had to be closed was because it afforded respect to the ensuing miracle if it comes about in secret - i.e. it was a personal redemption that required a degree of modesty and privacy for the recipient.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1 Refer to Rav Yaakov Ettlinger, author of the Aruch LaNer in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Ani_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Ha_Lachma_Anya.3.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Ani</a> on the Haggada who writes; <em>\"The Seder opens with a declaration that we are about to eat “the bread of affliction.” We also invite those who are hungry and needy to join us in telling the story of the Exodus. There are two sides to matzah both literally and figuratively: <strong>it represents slavery and freedom, oppression and liberation</strong>.\"</em></sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The following is my understanding based on things I've read, but I can't give any sources at present.</p>\n\n<p>On a physical level, a doorway or a gateway is the dividing line between one domain and another. If there is a door, opening it allows people or things to go from one domain to the other, and closing it effects the opposite. (And bolting the door adds another layer of disallowing).</p>\n\n<p>On a spiritual level the doorway also represents a separation of two domains, and closing the door to the outside prevents the entry of (possibly) bad spiritual influence.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that this why we need the protection of the mezuzah on our doorways and gateways, and also why specifically the name of Hashem, Shadd-ai is put on the outside, because this name signifies limiting - the name means that G-d said די (enough).</p>\n\n<p>This is also why the job of opening and closing of the doors in the Beis Hamikdash was assigned to certain Levi'im, because it was not just a janitorial task but a very spiritual action.</p>\n\n<p>If you read this parsha and the haftorah with this understanding in mind the various mentions of doors will make more sense.</p>\n\n<p>I do know that one place which partially addresses this topic is the Arvei Nachal on parshas Vayeilech with reference to the entrance of the Tent of meeting, see <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Arvei-Nachal/Vayeilech.html#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think in the Sdom story, it serves to emphasize that there's an angry, dangerous crowd outside and it's just barely safe inside.</p>\n\n<p>In the Haftorah, Malbim and others point out that if we're asking G-d for a miracle, we attempt to make it as non-disruptive as possible, thus the fewer people who observe it the better. Hence miracles are done behind closed doors.</p>\n\n\n",

I've heard it is toasting, and in that case the rabbi i spoke to said it would not be a problem of bishul goyim or pat goyim. I personally do not see the difference between baking and toasting. Can anyone point out the difference for me? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In commercial cereal production today, the actual cooking process is usually done through <a href=\"http://www.bakerperkins.com/cereal/equipment/traditional-cereal-equipment/cookmaster-rotary-cereal-cooker\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rotary steaming</a>, not baking. After the fully cooked grain or corn is crimped, shredded and cut, it is then passed through a <a href=\"http://www.bakerperkins.com/cereal/equipment/traditional-cereal-equipment/thermoglide2-toaster\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">toasting machine</a>, which uses  lower heat than in baking to remove moisture after the cooking has already been completed. It is a finishing process, not to cook. Depending upon how low the temperature is in the toasting process, it may actually fall into the definition of cold smoking. This low temperature toasting preserves the nutritional value of the food. Even in the cases where a commercial convection oven is used (actual baking), it is a finishing process to remove moisture, not to cook.</p>\n\n<p>For a detailed discussion of the different types of processes used for the different cereal types, see this link to <a href=\"http://www.bakerperkins.com/cereal/processes/traditional-cereals\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Baker Perkins</a> who manufactures commercial cereal machines.</p>\n\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/playing-with-fire/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explanation from the OU</a>, there are several  different considerations in regard to commercial cereal production that are relevant to the question of Bishul Akum and Pat Akum.</p>\n\n<p>The first is that according to many today, cereal is excluded from the restrictions of Bishul Akum because it is not a food which would <em>be found on a royal table</em>. The OU emphasizes that which foods fall into this status varies from one generation to the next. And so that detail needs reconsideration from time to time.</p>\n\n<p>The second consideration is that the process of steam cooking does not, according to many, fall under the domain of Bishul Akum at all.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The issue of bishul akum for a steam process is disputed by the Zer Zahav and Shem Aryeh, quoted in Darkei Teshuva 113:16. Some rabbinic authorities rule leniently in this matter even without other mitigating factors. See, for example, responsa of Yabia Orner, Vol. 5, 9, and responsa of Seridai Aish, Vol. 2, 138. Rabbi Weiss, however, relies on the lenient position only in a factory situation, where there is an issue of anonymity as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The third consideration that is relevant pertains to the position of Rabbi Moshe Feinstein that in the case of specialized commercial cooking equipment, Bishul Akum does not apply. This is because such specialized, large scale equipment, removes the reason behind the prohibition of Bishul Akum/Pat Akum in the first place. The social mixing of Jews and non-Jews. The commercial factory makes the actual baker anonymous.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rav Moshe, zt”l emphasized that if the cooking equipment in the factory is simply larger than the standard kitchen pots and pans, this does not constitute a unique situation. Rather, they must be totally different in structure and design, which is often the case in a factory.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the basis for what is called Pat Palter, commercially produced bread.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Pas palter is defined as any product baked by a gentile on which one recites hamotzi, either normally, or when there is kvias seudah (a full meal is eaten). See Taz, Yoreh Daya, 112:6, and Pri Chodosh, Yoreh Daya 112. One recites hamotzi on pas haba bikisnin whenever there is kvias seudah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The fourth consideration relates to the comment made above pertaining to the low temperature used in the toasting process. As mentioned above, if low enough, it may cause the toasting/finishing process to fall under the definition of cold smoking which is also excluded from the definition of Bishul Akum as discussed in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9146&st=&pgnum=10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch, Yoreh Deah 113:13</a>.</p>\n\n<p>והמעושן אינו כמבושל</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore a person is exceedingly close to Hashem in this blessing, and you bow to the King when you are in front of Him.  We are acknowledging that Hashem is the source of everything, the G-d over the beginning itself.  By bowing, we acknowledge that Hashem is the only existence and we nullify ourselves to Him.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן בסוף אותה ברכה, כי הברכה הזאת\n   היא השתלשלות העולם מן השם יתברך כי האבות\n   הם השתלשלות והתחלת העולם כמו שהתבאר.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize:</p>\n\n<p>So to at the end [of the first blessing], because the Avos are the beginning, as has been explained.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן במודים, וזה כי כשם שברכה ראשונה שהיא\n   אבות הוא השתלשלות המציאות מן השם יתברך.\n   וכן ברכת מודים הוראה על שכל המציאות הוא\n   אליו.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize:</p>\n\n<p>Same with Modim, we acknowledge that all existence is Hashem's (as we say, our lives which are given into your hands etc.).</p>\n\n<p>As to why it is at the beginning and end of those blessings, that is because:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ולפיכך כאשר בא אל הזכרת שמו יתברך כורע\n   ומוסר נפשו אל השם יתברך כי מציאותו של\n   אדם אינו נחשב אצל השם יתברך, וזוקף כאשר\n   מזכיר שמו מפני כי מן השם יתברך הכל והוא\n   מעמיד וזוקף הכל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To summarize:</p>\n\n<p>When we come to mention of Hashem's name, we bow before it to show that our existence is nothing in context of Hashem's existence.  When we reach Hashem, we straighten up because His existence gives us reality.</p>\n\n<p>The idea of our bowing is to show that we are nullified to Hashem and His existence is the only real existence, as above.  Hashem's name is at the beginning and end of each of those two blessings, so we bow there.</p>\n\n<p>I recommend seeing the whole piece inside to understand how everything connects (plus really appetizing extensions of the idea).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=215&seriesid=6#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yearos Devash</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>One should bow on 'baruch'.

Following\nthis, the verses to the end of the chapter go on to record several\ngenerations of Yechonya’s descendants, presumably down to the time of\nthe writing of Chronicles.

This crisis revolves\naround the failure of Zerubavel to emerge as the Mashiach. The first\nsix Perakim of Sefer Ezra speak of the years that Zerubavel served as\ngovernor of Eretz Yisrael on behalf of the Persian Empire. It seems\nthat the Jews had great expectations of Zerubavel. First, it is\nimportant to note that Zerubavel was the great grandson of Yehoyachin\n(Yechanya), the last king of Judea during the period of Bayit Rishon\n(Divrei Hayamim 3:16-19). Thus, the Persians empowered a Jew who was\npart of the Davidic line (and thus potentially the Mashiach) to govern\nEretz Yisrael. This presumably raised the hopes among Jews that the\nglory days of Bayit Rishon could be restored and even improved upon.</p>\n<p>Second, both Chaggai (2:21-23) and Zechariah (6:12-15) seem to\nprophesize that Zerubavel had the potential to become Mashiach, or at\nleast to restore Jewish sovereignty over Eretz Yisrael. Unfortunately,\nthese promises did not materialize (their fulfillment was delayed\nuntil the time of Hasmoneans and beyond) and must have left the Jews\nin Eretz Yisrael profoundly demoralized. Indeed, a sense of crisis is\nexpressed in Nechemia 9:37 (see the broader context), where it is\nstated, “UVeTzarah Gedolah Anachnu,” “We are in great distress.” Also\nsee Ezra 9:8-9 where similar emotions are expressed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abarbanel on Zechariah 6:12 says that the crown of the kingdom belongs to Zerubavel and his descendants, but he himself will not be crowned as he is a \"shoot\", not yet grown. Metzudas David says that the Mashiach will be descended from Zerubavel. Similarly on Chagai 2:23</p>\n<p>There is a web site that discusses the lines of descent from Zerubavel through the ages.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.davidicdynasty.org/descendants-of-zerubavel/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Descendants of Zerubavel Rashei Galut (Exilarchs), Gaonim and Rabbis.</a>\nThe page is too big to copy here, so just follow the link.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>According to the Zohar (Shelach 173b), the Messiah will descend from Hefzibah, the wife of Nathan (son of King David). Philo understands that Joash was a descendant of Nathan, son of David and the Messiah will descend from him and not from King Solomon. But Chronicles I 3:11 says that Joash was from the line directly descending from Kin Solomon. In some places, Maimonides writes that the Messiah will be a descendant of King David and King Solomon, but in other places he writes just King David, not King Solomon. Midrash Tanchuma (Toldos) says that the Messiah will be a descendant of Zerubabel.</p>\n\n\n",

What the different opinions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There's no earliest point in the order of the morning to lay tefillin (as long as it's daylight out) because the time for wearing tefillin is all day.</p>\n\n<p>But, nowadays, the common practice is not to walk around wearing tefillin but just to aim to fulfill the especially-important obligation of having then on during the time of reading the Shma and praying the Amidah (see <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/2304n.htm#26\" rel=\"nofollow\">הלכות תפילין פרק ד הלכה כו</a>).</p>\n\n<p>It is problematic to interrupt Shaharit anytime from Barukh She-Amar onwards (<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%A0%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow\">שולחן ערוך אורח חיים נא סעיף ד</a>), so to have tefillin on during Kriat Shma and the Amidah, it seems necessary to lay them prior to beginning Barukh She-Amar (this is just my logical assumption, I don't have a source). Seder Avodat Yisrael places the laying of tefillin right <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=42807&st=&pgnum=75&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">there</a>, immediately before Barukh She-Amar.</p>\n\n<p>In some nusha'ot, communal prayer can start before Barukh She-Amar. For example, to follow the Lurianic custom of reciting Kaddish De-Rabbanan after Korbanot, communal prayer needs to begin with the recitation of Korbanot, or at least some portion of the mishnayot and baraitot in it, to justify recitation of the Kaddish. It then makes sense to lay tefillin before then, so you can continue on without interruption afterwards with Hodu.</p>\n\n<p>I think one very prevalent way of doing things is simply to lay tefillin when you arrive at shul, so that when prayer starts, you're ready to go. But where each shul starts prayer will vary.</p>\n\n\n",

He further quotes the AriZal that a person should visualize the Tetragrammaton with the vowelization of the word יִרְאָה as a means of fulfilling the verse \"שויתי ה' לנגדי תמיד\" (\"I set HaShem before me constantly\", T'hillim 16:8).</p>\n\n<p>As far as achieving the trait of <em>d'veikus hamachshava</em> in its quintessence, the remainder of this answer will be confined to the approach of the <em>M'silas Y'sharim</em> as discussed in the <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20110224051625/http://www.shechem.org/torah/mesyesh/26.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">chapter on <em>k'dusha</em></a> (\"holiness\"). To fully achieve constant <em>d'veikus hamachshava</em> in its perfect form, one must first obtain the prerequisite traits of watchfulness from obvious sins, zeal to perform good deeds, cleanliness from any trace of sin, separation from unnecessary worldly indulgences or social involvement, purity of motivation in all spiritual thoughts, speech, and deeds, saintly fulfillment of all <em>mitzvos</em> to the maximum extent possible in every imaginable regard (beyond that which is strictly necessary to fulfill one's obligations), total humility in thought, speech, and deed, and an ever-present sense of awe of the Almighty and revulsion towards the possibility of violating His will. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If, after having undergone all these preparations, he steadfastly pursues with strong love and great fear, the contemplation of the greatness of the Blessed One and the might of His majesty, he will separate himself little by little from earthy considerations and in all his actions and movements will direct his heart to the intimacies of true communion until there is conferred upon him a spirit from on high and the Blessed One causes His Name to dwell with him as He does with all of His Holy ones. He will then be in actuality like an angel of G-d, and all of his actions, even the lowly, physical ones, will be accounted as sacrifices and Divine service.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>To reach this level of <em>k'dusha</em>, which as described by the Ramchal is essentially the same as having constant <em>d'veikus hamachshava</em> and making all of one's thoughts, speech, and deeds (even those related to otherwise mundane activities) totally <em>l'shem shamayim</em>, a person must strive for this goal to the best of his ability, and then:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the end, the Holy One Blessed be He leads him upon the path that he desires to follow, causes His Holiness to rest upon him, and sanctifies him, thus enabling him to maintain a constant intimacy with Him, the Blessed One. Where his nature hinders him, the Blessed One will aid and assist him, as it is stated (Psalms 84:12), \"He does not withhold good from those who walk in purity.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Ramchal provides some specific advice on beginning the process of striving for holiness:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>It is to be seen that the means of acquiring this trait are much separation, intense contemplation of the secrets of Divine governance and the mysteries of creation, and understanding of the majesty of the Blessed One and His excellence, to the point where one cleaves closely to Him and is capable of performing physical activities with the same motivation with which it befits the Priest to slaughter the sacrificial animal, receive its blood, and sprinkle it in order to receive from the Blessed One the blessing of life and peace. Without the above orientation one will find it impossible to attain Holiness, and regardless of what level he may have reached, he will nonetheless remain earthy and physical, like all other men.</p>\n  \n  <p>What assists one towards the acquisition of this trait is much solitude and separation, which, by eliminating the claims upon a person, allows his soul to grow in strength and to unite itself with the Creator. The deterrents to Holiness are a lack of true understanding and much association with people; for earthiness finds its counterpart and takes on new strength, and the soul remains trapped within it, unable to escape. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Although a person who has not yet fully achieved the prerequisite levels of spiritual development will never be able to fully or perfectly achieve <em>d'veikus hamachshava</em> in it's absolute form, he should still strive for whatever degree of <em>d'veikus hamachshava</em> he can achieve, as per <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/31784\">Ray's answer</a> and the beginning of this answer.

The way to achieve this is both through intention to be connected to Hashem, and performing the mitzvos.  Additionally, the verses of Torah recited during learning or davening serve as vessels to connect to Hashem, which can help a person increase his mental attachment and awareness that \"Ain Od Milvado\" - there is nothing but Him.  The more one contemplates that Hashem is above all description and that the universe, while a magnificant creation, is completely null and void compared to the Supreme King of Kings, HaKadosh Baruch Hu, the more one can stand in complete awe and reverence to his Creator.  This is another take on the concepts posted previously, but I just wanted to add another dimension.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Kaganoff goes into detail on this. His opinion is that we do not go back as one is not supposed to repeat the parts that he actually said. However, this leads to a somewhat complicated method of \"fixing\" the shmonah esrai that he then explains in detail.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://rabbikaganoff.com/?s=tikanta+shabbos\" rel=\"nofollow\">This Shabbos Is Rosh Chodesh: What If I Goofed And Said Tikanta Shabbos By Mistake?</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I once edited an article in which the author quoted several\n  anthologies, each of which ruled that someone who realizes he is\n  saying Tikanta Shabbos on Shabbos Rosh Chodesh should immediately stop\n  where he is, and go to the beginning of Atah Yatzarta, and recite the\n  entire bracha. However, I believe that this ruling is in error. I will\n  explain shortly why I believe that this answer is erroneous.  But\n  first… </p>\n  \n  <p>I attempted to trace the sources quoted in the article to see if\n  perhaps I was missing some logic or information that I would clarify\n  in the course of my research.</p>\n  \n  <p>What I did discover was that each source was simply quoting a\n  previous one, and that they all traced to one obscure 19th century\n  work, which did not explain at all the reason for the ruling.</p>\n  \n  <p>I will now explain why I believe this ruling is in error, and what\n  one should do. My major concern is that the approach that these works\n  advocate results in repeating many parts of the shemoneh esrei, and\n  that this repetition constitutes a forbidden interruption in the\n  tefillah. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge, there is no\n  essential requirement to recite this middle bracha of the shemoneh\n  esrei precisely in order. </p>\n  \n  <p>Obviously, one should maintain the order as is, but there is ample\n  evidence from major halachic authorities that, in general, mistakenly\n  rearranging the order of a bracha is not calamitous (see, for example,\n  Rosh, Taanis 1:1; Shu”t Igros Moshe, Orach Chayim 4:18 and 4:70:14).\n  Thus, when left with the choice of rearranging the order of a bracha\n  to avoid repetition, or repeating parts of the bracha and ignoring\n  what was already said, one should follow the first approach.</p>\n  \n  <p>Subsequently, I realized that the position I have followed, is indeed\n  that of Rav Moshe Feinstein. However, it appears that, in general,\n  there are other halachic authorities who feel that the text of a\n  brocha should indeed be kept intact even when repetition will result\n  (see, for example, Mateh Efrayim 582:10; Mishnah Berurah 582:16; Biur\n  Halacha 127:2 s.v. Aval).</p>\n  \n  <p>Based on my opinion, it appears that someone who discovers that\n  he/she began reciting Tikanta Shabbos rather than Atah Yatzarta should\n  mention only those parts of the bracha that he/she has as yet not\n  recited, but not repeat any theme or part of the bracha that one has\n  already said. Although fulfilling this may be confusing to someone\n  unfamiliar with the bracha, this should provide us with a valid reason\n  to pay more attention to the details of this bracha and understand its\n  different parts.</p>\n  \n  <p>In order to explain how one does this correctly, brachos of Atah\n  Yatzarta and Tikanta Shabbos into their constituent parts, so that we\n  can identify which parts we should not repeat. We can divide these\n  brachos into the following seven sections.</p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  1. The introduction – from the words Atah Yatzarta until and including the words shenishtalcha (some recite the text hashelucha)\n  bemikdashecha.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  1. The introduction – from the words Tikanta Shabbos until and including the word kara’ui.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  2. The prayer for our return – beginning with the words Yehi Ratzon – until (and including) the word kehilchasam.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  2. The prayer for our return – beginning with the words Yehi Ratzon – until (and including) the word kehilchasam.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  3. The sentence that introduces the mention of the pesukim of the Musaf – Ve’es Musafei Yom HaShabbos Hazeh veyom Rosh Hachodesh… until\n  (and including) the word ka’amur.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  3. The sentence that introduces the mention of the pesukim of the Musaf – Ve’es Musaf Yom HaShabbos Hazeh… until (and including) the\n  word ka’amur.    </p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  4. Mention of the pesukim of the korban Musaf of Shabbos.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  4. Mention of the pesukim of the korban Musaf of Shabbos.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  5. Mention of the pasuk of the korban Musaf of Rosh Chodesh and the passage Uminchasam… until (and including) the word kehilchasam.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  5. No equivalent  </p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  6. The paragraph Yismechu Vemalchusecha that concludes with the words zeicher lemaasei vereishis.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  6. The paragraph Yismechu Vemalchusecha that concludes with the words zeicher lemaasei vereishis.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Shabbos Rosh Chodesh<br>\n  7. The closing of the bracha -- Elokeinu Veilokei Avoseinu.<br>\n  Regular Shabbos<br>\n  7. The closing of the bracha -- Elokeinu Veilokei Avoseinu.  </p>\n  \n  <p>We should note that the closings of these middle brachos of Musaf\n  shemoneh esrei are very different. On Shabbos Rosh Chodesh we recite a\n  version that is almost identical to what we recite on a weekday Rosh\n  Chodesh, but we insert three passages to include Shabbos.</p>\n  \n  <p>Parts 2, 4 and 6 of the two brachos are identical, whether it is\n  Shabbos or Shabbos Rosh Chodesh. Therefore, one should not repeat\n  these sections if one has said them already.</p>\n  \n  <p>Part 1 on Shabbos Rosh Chodesh, Atah Yatzarta, is very different from\n  what we usually recite on a regular Shabbos. Therefore, someone still\n  in the middle of this bracha should recite this passage again.</p>\n  \n  <p>If someone missed part 5, mention of the pesukim of Rosh Chodesh, and\n  is still in the middle of this bracha, he/she should recite it and\n  introduce it with the section 3 above, which introduces the korbanos\n  of the Musaf. However, if he/she already recited the pesukim of\n  Shabbos korban Musaf (#4) above, he should omit the reference to\n  Shabbos in this piece and only mention Rosh Chodesh. In the latter\n  case, one should change the plural Musafei to a singular Musaf since\n  he/she now is only mentioning the Rosh Chodesh Musaf.</p>\n  \n  <p>Having explained the rules governing these halachos, I will now\n  present the conclusions in a hopefully clearer way, depending on when\n  you discover your mistake:</p>\n  \n  <p>A. If you were still reciting the beginning of Tikanta Shabbos, and\n  had not yet reached Yehi Ratzon: Return to Atah Yatzarta and recite it\n  in order without any changes.</p>\n  \n  <p>B. If you had already begun the Yehi Ratzon, but are before Ve’es\n  Musaf Yom HaShabbos Hazeh: Complete the Yehi Ratzon until Ve’es Musaf;\n  then recite Atah Yatzarta until the words Yehi Ratzon, then resume\n  from the words Ve’es Musafei Yom HaShabbos Hazeh Veyom Rosh Hachodesh\n  from the Shabbos Rosh Chodesh Musaf and continue through the rest of\n  the tefillah.</p>\n  \n  <p>C. If you had just begun Ve’es Musaf Yom HaShabbos Hazeh: Add the\n  words Ve’es Musaf Yom Rosh Hachodesh Hazeh, and then continue in the\n  Shabbos Rosh Chodesh Musaf until Yismechu Vemalchusecha. Immediately\n  prior to saying Yismechu Vemalchusecha insert the words from Atah\n  Yatzarta until the words shenishtalcha bemikdashecha. Then return to\n  Yismechu Vemalchusecha and recite the rest of the tefillah in order.</p>\n  \n  <p>D. If you are already in the middle of Ve’es Musaf Yom HaShabbos\n  Hazeh: Recite Uveyom Hashabbas… until Veniskah. Then insert the words\n  from Atah Yatzarta until the words shenishtalcha bemikdashecha. Then\n  return to the words Ve’es Musaf but say the following: Ve’es Musaf Yom\n  Rosh Hachodesh Hazeh until the word ka’amur. Then say Uverashei\n  Chadsheichem in the Shabbos Rosh Chodesh section and continue in\n  order.</p>\n  \n  <p>E. If you are in the middle of Yismechu Vemalchusecha, complete it\n  until Zeicher lemaasei vereishis, and then insert the words from Atah\n  Yatzarta until the words shenishtalcha bemikdashecha. Then return to\n  the words Ve’es Musaf but say the following: Ve’es Musaf Yom Rosh\n  Hachodesh Hazeh until the word ka’amur. Then say Uverashei\n  Chadsheichem in the Shabbos Rosh Chodesh section. Then go to Elokeinu\n  Veilokei Avoseinu (after Yismechu Vemalchusecha) and finish the end of\n  the bracha and the davening.</p>\n  \n  <p>F. If you are already in the middle of the closing part of the bracha\n  (Elokeinu Veilokei Avoseinu) complete the clause that you are saying,\n  and then insert the words from Atah Yatzarta until the words\n  shenishtalcha bemikdashecha. Then return to the words Ve’es Musaf but\n  say Ve’es Musaf Yom Rosh Hachodesh Hazeh until the word ka’amur. Then\n  say Uverashei Chadsheichem in the Shabbos Rosh Chodesh section. Then\n  return to chadeish aleinu beyom hashabbos hazeh es hachodesh hazeh and\n  finish the end of the bracha in the Shabbos Rosh Chodesh section.</p>\n  \n  <p>If you completed the entire bracha of Tikanta Shabbos, but mentioned\n  in the middle of the bracha some reference to the korban Musaf of Rosh\n  Chodesh, you have fulfilled the requirements of this prayer and you\n  should continue Retzei (see Mishnah Berurah 423:6). If you completed\n  the bracha of Tikanta Shabbos but did not yet begin Retzeih, you\n  should say “vena’aseh lefanecha korban Rosh Chodesh hazeh” – “and we\n  shall do before You this Rosh Chodesh offering” and then continue with\n  Retzei (ibid.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Order of Masechtos in Seder Moed\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to the standard Shas print (Vilna Bavli), the order of Masechtas is Pesachim-Shekalim-Rosh Hashana-Yoma-Sukka-Beitza. This makes (some) sense as this is the order of holidays.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Bavli Daf Yomi schedule is Pesachim-Shekalim-Yoma-Sukkah-Beitza-Rosh Hashana-Taanis. I note Daf Yomi was instituted after the Vilna print.</p>\n\n<p>Why is there a discrepancy in the order?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't think  @Shimon bM's comment that order doesn't matter is justified. The Rishonim speak at length about the reasons for the order of the Masechtos (see Tosfos beginning of Bava Metzia and Avodah Zarah for example, and the Rambam's intro to the Mishnah etc. etc.). The Gemara even discusses whether the order bears Halachic repercussions (Bava Kama 102a, Avodah Zarah 7a).</p>\n<p>@DoubleAA is correct that the real question is why the printers of the Shas changed the order, since it is clear that the 'true' order is the order of the Mishnah (& Tosefta and Rambam etc.). His suggestion that it had to do with size considerations is hard to swallow. RH and Beitzah have the same number of Dapim, why should printers have preferred grouping Yoma-Sukkah-Beitzah to grouping Rosh Hashanah-Yoma-Sukkah? It seems more likely that the theme of Tishrei Chagim seemed more logical for them (and for those who want to study the current holiday and will find it easier to find all of Tishrei in a single vol.)</p>\n<p>The big question is still what determined the 'true' order of the Masechtos, and why Beitzah precedes Rosh Hashanah. I saw a fascinating reference regarding the 'true' order (i.e. which is more correct) of Masechtos at <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/yo-in-biblio.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/yo-in-biblio.htm</a> . (It is worth becoming familiar with that site - there are answers and information there for everything related to Talmud and Mishnah.) In brief, they cite Rav R. Margoliyos (Yesod ha'Mishnah va'Arichasah) who points out that in every Seder, the order of the Masechtos is from larger to smaller - not in number of Dapim, but in number of Perakim. If so, it follows that the 'true' order must be Yoma, Sukah, Beitzah, RH (8,5,5,4 Perakim)!</p>\n<p>This theme follows through the entire Shas with a single exception - the beginning of Zeraim (where the Masechtos reduce in size from Berachos to PEah to Demai (9,8,7), but jump up with Kilayim Shevi'is Terumos (9,10,11) before returning to the normal pattern with Ma'asros etc. (5,4,4,3,3). Since no simple answer has yet been suggested for that anomaly, the Rambam is justified in suggested his (sometimes forced) reasons for why each Maseches follows the previous one!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Mikvah with three additional chambers\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was looking at documentation of a mikvah being constructed, and it confused me. In addition to the immersion pool, this mikvah had three additional chambers. From what I have gathered, they appear to be 1) a bor hashakah, 2) a bor zeriah, and 3) a bor tachton. </p>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, the purpose of each of these chambers is the same: to provide a way for the tap water to be considered kosher for the mikvah. What I don't understand is why three different kinds are present in one mikvah.</p>\n\n<p>How common is it for a modern mikvah to have all three chambers as this one did? What is the most common scenario? Is it necessary to have all three, or what is the benefit in doing so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In short, there are two ways to make \"drawn water\" (as in tap water) kosher.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Hashaka - If tap water touches \"kosher\" water, it becomes kosher. This is a classic \"side by side\" construction.</li>\n<li>Zeriya - If one \"plants\" \"non-kosher\" water into \"kosher\" water, it becomes kosher.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The problem with these two methods is that there are some opinions which say that the kosher water doesn't stay kosher forever (it doesn't become kosher, it just is considered attached to the main bucket). Therefore, if the \"kosher\" water looses it's status, the mikva becomes Pasul.</p>\n\n<p>Since the water is side by side, the water mixes, causing sooner or later the rain-water reservoir to loose its rain water. According to some, the Mikva then becomes pasul.</p>\n\n<p>The advantage of the \"Bor Al Gabey Bor\" is that since the bottom water (the rainwater reservoir) is cold (there is no heater there) and the top water is hot, the waters don't mix. In such a setup, the Mikva stays kosher for much longer.</p>\n\n<p>Some don't approve of this construction, however, since there was one opinion (The Divrei Chaim of Zanz) who said that one cannot connect a not-kosher mikva to a kosher one through a \"pipe\" - in other words - any change in elevation. To allow people who worry about this Chumra, they build the other two \"boros\".</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/chasidim/mkvh/7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://chabadlibrary.org/books/chasidim/mkvh/7.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

Shulchan Aruch discusses different levels of bans, some of which would mean the individual can't even count for a minyan.

    "content": "# Tzeit HaKokhavim According To The Gr\"a & Geonim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have been investigating the various <em>shitoth</em> regarding <em>sheqiah</em> (\"sunset\") and <em>sseth ha-kokhavim</em> (\"<em>tzeit ha-kokhavim</em>\" or, when three stars are visible) and cannot find certain info regarding the <em>shitah</em> of the Gr\"a (and the Geonim) regarding the time it takes to walk 3/4 mil (i.e. how long it takes after <em>Sheqi`ath HaHamah</em> to become <em>laylah</em>/ <em>sseth ha-kokhavim</em>). </p>\n\n<p>What I have found is that according to the Gr\"a - assuming an 18 minute mil - 13.5 minutes after sunset is definite night. Others use the same shitah of calculation, but have a different definition for <em>halikhath mil</em> (\"[the time it takes to] walk a talmudic mile\"), ranging from 16 minutes to 24 minutes after sunset. However, unless it is just less possible due to street lights, etc. I have a hard time believing that 14 minutes after sunset in Wisconsin would truly be night with three stars visible. I have also heard that this amount of time was only a reality in Bavel and Eress Yisrael.</p>\n\n<p>So, my question is: What would the <em>shitah</em> of the Gra/the Geonim be in various places in the world? What would the calculation be? When would <em>sseth ha-kokhavim</em> be - according to the Gr\"a - in Wisconsin for instance?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>When the sun sets, the light decreases in accordance with the sun moving lower and lower than the horizon (of course not the sun is moving but rather the earth is moving). The decreasing of the light is what gradually enables us to see more and more stars, until we reach complete darkness (no light from the sun) and we can see all the visible stars.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when we want to calculate tzet hakochavim, we are really calculating a certain level of darkness, which is measured today in the degrees the sun is below the horizon. This tells us the level of darkness and how many stars we can see.</p>\n\n<p>However, the time it takes to reach that level of darkness flactuates based on two major factors:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Your location</p></li>\n<li><p>The time of year</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Generally speaking, the closer you are to the equator, the shorter the time will be, while the farther you are from the equator, the longer the time will be.\nSecondly, around the equinox (when the days and nights are equal) in the spring and autumm the time is shorter, while both in the winter and in the summer the time becomes longer (in the summer even more than the winter).</p>\n\n<p>For an in depth explanation of why this is so I recommend reading the book Zemanim Bahalacha of Rav Chaim Banish. For a short explanation please see the following teshuva of Eretz Hemdah:\n<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43791&st=&pgnum=6&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43791&st=&pgnum=6&hilite=</a></p>\n\n<p>In light of this, how could Chazal have given a time in minutes at all, if this time fluctuates from place to place and from season to season?</p>\n\n<p>The Gra answers that the times Chazal gave apply to Eretz Yisrael and Bavel (which approximately are the same distance from the equator) and for the equinox days (\"yemei nissan vetishrei\") when the days and nights are equal. These times become longer even in Eretz Yisrael and Bavel during the summer and winter (and not shorter in the winter as some mistakenly have stated, for although the days become shorter, the time until tzet hakochavim becomes longer - see in the above sources for the reason why). And they also become longer in countries which are northern to Eretz Yisrael and Bavel. </p>\n\n<p>The way to calculate this properly is to check the degrees the sun is below the horizon in Eretz Yisrael 3/4 of a mil after sunset on the equinox, and to use that to calculate tzet hakochavim for any place in the world. For example, if one follows mil being 24 minutes and thus tzet hakochavim 18 minutes, that comes out to approximately 4.9 degrees below the horizon, and this can be calculated (using astronomical calculations) for any place in the world for any date. By zman Motzaei Shabbat in Israel the custom is to be more stringent and to wait until 8.5 degrees, and so on.</p>\n\n\n",

One day his father asked him to explain to him what it was they were learning in yeshiva.  So, the son sat down to learn a page of Gemara with his father.  When they completed an entire daf, the father told his son that he wanted to have a siyum.  The son said \"you can't have a siyum for just a single daf; you have a siyum for learning an entire mesechta of Gemara, but not a daf\".  The father told his son to ask Rav Moshe whether it could be done and, to the son's surprise, the Rav said that not only could it be done, he wanted to be invited. Soon thereafter the father died and Rav Moshe came to the funeral and told the story of the siyum, stating that by learning even a single daf of Gemara, the father had not only merited a siyum, he had earned a place in the World to Come.  </p>\n\n<p>When Rabbi Anemer told this story at siyums for the local daf yomi, he acknowledged that these men who work long days often fell asleep during the shiur, but nevertheless, they had earned a place in the World to Come because of their efforts to learn.  Also, knowing that fact (that some of us lost consciousness during numerous sugyas), Rabbi Anemer still celebrated the siyumim with us all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Expanding upon my answer from <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/12300/5\">here</a>:</p>\n\n<p>I once wanted to learn a Masechta for the purpose of making a Siyum, and I learned it on mp3 and made a Siyum with the approval of a prominent Rav.</p>\n\n<p>The primary objective, I believe, is to learn to the best of your ability. If you cannot understand a single word and you refuse to use \"tricks\" to make it easier to understand (eg., dictionaries, translated texts, etc.), then I would humbly suggest that you are wasting your time.  If, however, you expended as much effort as you can reasonably be expected to put forth, given your resources and time constraints, I think it is fair to participate.</p>\n\n<p>After all, we have a rule that if one misses the time for reading Shema', he (or she) still gains from reciting it on the basis of learning Torah (and, while I could be wrong, I don't think it means that the person needs to recite it with Rashi).</p>\n\n\n",

Hashem is, as we say in the Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur prayers, השוה ומשוה קטן וגדול - the One to whom small and great are equal, because He is infinitely greater than all of them. So the tiny details of mitzvos are no less part of His purview than the big things - and by our paying attention to those tiny details, we demonstrate our belief in this idea.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>This is a great question. With all due respect to the previous valuable answers, I once came across another great answer to this question (I believe from Rabbi Dr. Akiva Tatz).</p>\n\n<p>Torah is the blueprint of the world. Before something is built, a blueprint is designed to record every detail of the future edifice, and then the blueprint is used to direct its construction. So too, the Torah contained the design of the entire creation. When Hashem created the universe, He followed the plan recorded in the Torah. This is what the Zohar (Shemos 161a) means when it writes that Hashem looked into the Torah and created the world. Similarly, Bereishis Rabbah §1:1 states in regards to the creation of the world that the Torah was the tool of Hashem’s craft. Thus, the physical universe is a manifestation of the Torah. </p>\n\n<p><strong>This explains why the Torah is so complex - it parallels the universe's complexity.</strong> Crack open any textbook: biology, chemistry, physics, math, psychology, ecology, economics, astronomy etc. The world has a lot of details in it!

    "content": "# Are Rabbinic decrees binding forever, or can they be rescinded?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Regarding the rabbinic decrees instructed in the Talmud, how can one know that a particular rabbinic commandment is binding to all future generations and may not be rescinded or amended ever?  .</p>\n\n<p>Regarding customs which have gained the status of law, e.g. should a woman still leave the house about twice a month (as per Rambam, Shulchan Aruch, etc.) and make sure that she is completely modestly dressed even when totally alone at home, how might it be proven that the custom need no longer be observed stringently? .</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>This is a fairly broad question, but basically it takes a good deal of scholarship. (And people who like to pick whatever snippets from Jewish sources that suits them, and post them online in all caps, aren't often so good at this.)</p>\n\n<p>We do not have the power to overturn rabbinic law that was codified into the Talmud, however we can clarify the nature of those laws; sometimes a case that was an unusual loophole 1500 years ago is the one that we usually encounter today. (It reminds me very much of a first-aid book I'd read: \"we used to recommend using meat tenderizer to treat certain animal stings, we no longer do. Medically it was sound advice, but the meat tenderizer you buy in the store today has different ingredients than the one sold a few decades ago.\" Or there was someone shouting \"the Chofetz Chaim says it's prohibited to use an electric shaver!\" Yes, but the electric shaver he prohibited was a device that employed a razor blade. That's not today's \"electric shaver.\") And some of what's in the Talmud isn't formalized rabbinic law, either.</p>\n\n<p>When we get to something like Rambam's code, you have to dig into the commentaries to realize what Rambam is doing. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is he Doctor Rambam, giving medical advice? (If so, check if it fits within today's conventional medicine.)</li>\n<li>Is he Halachist Rambam, codifying a law in the Talmud? (If so it's binding, though check if other medieval authorities interpreted the Talmud that same way; and again make sure that whatever cases he was describing in the year 1200 are the ones we're describing today.) </li>\n<li>Or is he Preacher Rambam, giving practical applications of moral values, tailored to twelfth-century Egypt? The moral value is \"modesty for women is good.\" Still applies. And you know what? \"If you live in a massive estate in Alexandria in the year 1180 with extended family and you grow your own food within the estate, and the only reason you'd need to leave is to pay social calls, then maybe your social calls should be in moderation.\"  Fine. But that doesn't address the applications that we normally encounter today. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(For that matter, there are instances 50 years ago where Rabbi Moshe Feinstein wrote \"I think doing XYZ is listening to the yetzer hara\", which was his social commentary -- \"I think doing XYZ is heading in a bad direction.\" But his situations then may not be our situations today, either. For instance, \"merging two small Orthodox synagogues is listening to the yetzer hara as people will expect a microphone in the big synagogue.\" And fifty years ago in America, they certainly did! Does that cover today's situations? Ask an Orthodox rabbi who is local to you in time, space, and sociology.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Chalav Yisrael milk: stringency or binding?",
    "content": "# Chalav Yisrael milk: stringency or binding?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In a time where we know with enough certainty (when compared with other kashrut principles) that cow’s milk sold in most countries where we live is indeed cow’s milk, how do we know whether the laws about chalav Yisrael still have a purpose? I'd like to know the arguments on both sides: those who say it is now not contextually relevant, or those who say it is still a binding law, at least until overturned by a Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n<p>If it's only an added stringency, I don't know if I would keep it (I'm just in the conversion process) since it causes such complications in the community. Then again, if it was intended to matter and remain necessary across circumstances, I see very much why Talmudic agreements/decisions like this must be followed. Or even just because of the way cultural customs in the Jewish community do carry attributes of real value to following generations, and it's hard to separate them.</p>\n\n<p>I am curious about how much the original intention vs. the literal detail should be known and followed when it comes to this particular law.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>Short answer, for a newcomer to Orthodox Judaism: if you go to synagogue affiliated with the Orthodox Union or Young Israel, mainstream American mass-produced milk will almost always be seen as kosher, and old-fashioned, Jew-watched-the-milking <em>chalav yisrael</em> will be seen as a stringency. If your community is Hassidic, including Lubavitch, <em>chalav yisrael</em> is the norm.</p>\n<p>But let's back up and clarify terms, as I think some are missing the point of this question.</p>\n<p>Let's take a product like apple juice. The Talmud never talks about the laws of kosher apple juice, so today kosher certifiers will go into an apple juice factory, figure out what are the odds that the equipment or ingredients have anything non-kosher in them, and certify accordingly. Easy enough. If you bought uncertified apple juice but were somehow able to send it to a lab and absolutely verify it's 100% apple juice, it's kosher! (A hundred years ago in Lithuania, the Aruch HaShulchan actually had this question as there were concerns their olive oil was adulterated. The local pharmacists were able to determine that while it was not 100% olive oil, it was 100% plant material. Which was good enough, kosher-wise.)</p>\n<p>The problem here is that the Talmud indicates there was a formal rabbinic ban issued on \"milk bought from a non-Jew, unless a Jew was more-or-less present during the milking.\" 500 years ago if you bought mystery milk from a non-Jewish farmer it was automatically non-kosher. Even if you then were able to manually churn it into butter (pig milk doesn't manually churn), i.e. chemically verify its identity, it doesn't work because of the rabbinic ban. If there was a formal rabbinic ban, we can look for loopholes built within it, but we don't have the rabbinic firepower to actually overturn the ban.</p>\n<p>Those who are strict today will insist all milk is covered by this rabbinic ban. (Just as kosher cheese must be made by Jews, even though we're certain this cheese has vegetarian rennet.)</p>\n<p>Rabbi Feinstein and others, however, work around this by clarifying the nature of the ban. The ban was not \"a Jew must have his eyeballs on the milk at all time\", as the kosher supervisor is allowed to step in and out of the barn every so often. Rather, the law was \"a Jew must ascertain at the time of milking that it's all kosher.\" And we ascertain it today via economics and regulation. (Or to take it a step further -- the ban was \"don't buy <em>mystery milk</em> from a non-Jew\", or better yet, \"don't trust a non-Jew with mystery milk.\" Today's commercially-produced milk in most first-world countries is not \"mystery milk\", and therefore was not covered by the ban.)</p>\n<p>Really halacha only recognizes two categories of milk: \"chalav akum\", \"non-Jewish milk\", which was prohibited by rabbinic ban; and \"chalav yisrael\", \"milk that a Jew oversaw.\" Rabbi Feinstein argues that \"chalav yisrael\" is defined as \"milk that a Jew ascertained\", therefore commercial milk <em>is</em> \"chalav yisrael.\" Those to the right argue no, it's \"chalav akum.\" Today we speak of \"chalav ha-companies\", or \"chalav stam\", which means: \"milk whose status is viewed as chalav yisrael by some, and chalav akum by others.\"</p>\n<p>Those who are lenient could still find room for stringency (as Rabbi Feinstein recommended for elementary-level yeshivas in New York City) as the Talmud mentions that if a piece of meat required a judgment call from a learned scholar about its kashrut, some pious people wouldn't eat it. It's not about \"oh what if it's not really kosher?\" It's \"I don't want to delve into nitty-gritty loopholes to justify my actions.\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>It is not quite correct for everyone to be quoting Rav Moshe, as though the permissibility of drinking USFDA milk originated with his responsa on the subject. Rather, most American Jews were drinking what he called chalav hacompanies well before RMF arrived in the US. They had rabbanim who had already ruled it was permissible, such as R' Dov Revel, R' Yisrael Avraham Abba Krieger, (among other greats of early 20th century American Judaism whom time has forgotten because the post-War immigrants never met them) R' Breuer, R' Moshe Soloveitchik and his son R' JB Soloveitchik. In the early days of Lakewoodthey served regular milk and Breakstone cottage cheese. Yes, that stopped when CY became more readily available, but obviously the yeshiva wouldn't have served it had R' Aharon Kotler believed CY was mandatory. (They could have sent someone to a nearby farm -- Lakewood was near farmland back then.)</p>\n\n<p>Then there were those who didn't permit USFDA inspected milk. Those who immigrated in that same post-war wave were therefore confused which to do. RMF sided with those who permit, giving the version of the justification he found valid. But the leniency doesn't entirely rest on his shoulders.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it's clear Rav Moshe's language shifted as chalav Yisrael (CY) became more available, in the earliest responsum treating CY as a stringency above the baseline (Irgros Moshe YD 1:47-49), the middle more equivocal (2:31,35) and the latest (4:5) more like not insisting on CY being a leniency. However,  Rebbetzin Feinstein did not observe chalav yisrael, and it is well known in their community that Rav Dovid Feinstein to this day drinks what his father zt\"l labeled \"chalav ha-companies\" (company milk, USFDA approved). So I wouldn't read that much into the change in language, if it didn't impact what he told his own family! In practice, he treated CY as a personal stringency, even to his last day.</p>\n\n<p>The basic conceptual division is in how we understand CY:</p>\n\n<p>According to the Peri Chadash (Yoreh Deah 115:6, based on the Radbaz), the risk of consuming milk adulterated with non-kosher milk is like any other kashrus risk. The rabbis identified it, and told you to avoid the risk by drinking CY. But if you could take care of the kashrus risk some other way, that would be just as good. And so milk subject to government agency rules, like the USFDA, would be kosher.</p>\n\n<p>The Chasam Sofer (responsa, Yoreh Deah 107) rejects the Peri Chadash's position, believing that CY is a distinct rabbinic legislation.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe's position is conceptually based on the Chasam Sofer, but ends up closer to the Peri Chadash in implementation. He writes that there is indeed a rabbinic law requiring a Jewish observer, but \"observation\" boils down to knowledge. And Rav Moshe brings other examples where the law uses the term \"sight\" but knowing in other ways is sufficient. Therefore, as long as one knows for sure (or sure enough) that the milk isn't adulterated, the rabbinic law of Chalav Yisrael is being obeyed.</p>\n\n<p>In the Arukh haShulchan's analysis (YD 115:1-17) we have both issues:</p>\n\n<p>1- Eliminating the risk of drinking milk that is adulterated with something that isn't kosher.</p>\n\n<p>2- A piece of rabbinic legislation that requires some kind of Jewish observation during milking. The legislation may have been motivated by #1, it is still legislation that would require a greater Sanhedrin to overturn (115:16). And we don't have what it takes to make any Sanhedrin. (And besides, the AhS adds, for every reason given for an enactment, there are numerous unstated reasons.)</p>\n\n<p>If the farmer doesn't own any non-kosher animals, and adulterating with non-kosher milk would make the milk more expensive instead of less; or the farm is focused on butter production and adulterating would also make no sense -- we took care of #1, but the Arukh haShulchan (and those who obligate CY in general) would still require Jewish observation. (115:9-10)</p>\n\n<p>However, in such a case where the risk of non-kosher is ignorable, this observation could be minimal. He could come in during the milking of the last cow of the run and all would still be kosher. This is not the random spot check inspection (yotzei venichnas) of kashrus, but meeting a separate requirement.</p>\n\n<p>And the Arukh haShulchan considers utensils used for cooking non-CY milk to also be non-kosher. (115:11) But he is lenient on butter (115:20 onward), noting that the gemara only mentions milk and cheese, not milk products in general. He therefore would presumably permit the vast majority of manufactured products as well, as it is far more common to use milk powder than actual milk.</p>\n\n<p>Note that the AhS is known for representing accepted practice in Lithuania. However, the Polish government didn't offer consumer protection of the sort the USFDA (or parallel contemporary government entities) provides. The specific question Rav Moshe Feinstein discussed was purely theoretical. Still, I am not sure there is room for Rav Moshe's leniency in the Arukh haShulchan's formulation, despite the fact that both are understandings of the Chasam Sofer's position, and both have similar background in terms of accepted practice and custom.</p>\n\n<p>I just want to provide a balanced presentation, rather than looking at one side to the exclusion of the other.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This exact question--whether the prohibition exists independently of the concern about non-kosher milk--is the subject of a famous dispute between the Peri Chadash (Yoreh Deah 115:6) and the Chatam Sofer (Teshuvot, Yoreh Deah 107). The Peri Chadash, basing himself on an earlier teshuvah of Radvaz (4:75), argues that the Sanhedrin never prohibited unsupervised milk; rather, the prohibition is entirely based on a concern for non-kosher milk. If there are no non-kosher animals in the location, all milk would be permitted. Chatam Sofer argues and maintains (based on his understanding of Rashi in Avodah Zarah 35a) that there is a rabbinic prohibition independent of the concern for admixture of forbidden milk. The Chazon Ish (Yoreh Deah 41:4) rejected Chatam Sofer's understanding of Rashi and maintains that the Peri Chadash is correct. </p>\n\n\n",

A sleeved blanket is a four-cornered blanket with sleeves, similar to a backwards bathrobe. It can be made of anything blankets are made of.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/1701/do-blankets-need-tzitzis\">this question</a> explains why a blanket does not normally need tzitzis. But the presence of sleeves raises some questions. </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Is the presence of sleeves enough to constitute wearing it in the manner of clothing (derech levisha)?</li>\n<li>Does the arrangement of the four corners not being on all four sides of the body still render it exempt even when sleeves are present?</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>(In a practical situation, CYLOR of course.) </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>If it's made of synthetic material (and it probably is):</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>R' Moshe Feinstein (Igrot Moshe vol 2 #1) rules that it does not require tzitzit.</li>\n<li>The Tzitz Eliezer (vol 7 #3) and R' Ben Tzion Abba Shaul (Ohr l'Tziyon vol 2 2:3) rule that it does (because of a safek d'oraita l'chumra), but that you don't make the beracha (because of safek berachot l'hakel).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If it has 4 corners, it needs tzitzis. A blanket would also need, if worn as a garment. However, based on the pictures, it looks like the Snuggie has two corners instead of four. So it won't need Tzitzis. </p>\n\n\n",

Today, snakes are not commonly found and the Matei Yehonoson 116:1 says there is a heter to drink from uncovered vessels if no snakes are around, adding that one may be lenient because at the time of the\nhalacha it was only made in a place where snakes were common.  Nevertheless, I know people who continue to be stringent on this practice, even covering their water glass between sips.  While I understand that poskim are stringent with regard to water left out overnight (see, e.g., Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 33:5), why should anyone need to be stringent during the course of a meal, when a snake would not likely crawl into a water goblet on a Shabbos table without notice?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1086&st=&pgnum=43\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rivevos Ephraim 5:11</a> writes that in Sefer Halichos V'Hanahagos page 59 (Rav Eliyashiv) was Makpid to cover drinks.

His name was Jordan and the question now has arisen as to what name to put on the tombstone (matzaveh).

However there is some debate as to whether the name should be written anywhere on the curtain to the Aron Kodesh or in the shul itself as it's not a \"Hebrew\" name.

According to this explanation, why was the Kaf selected to be the small letter and not the Lamed, the Bais, the Taf, or the Hai? Is there a reason the Kaf was selected over the word's other letters?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=32454&st=&pgnum=123&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chasdei Dovid</a> explains per Rashi that says Bas Kuf K'Bas Chaf L'Yofi that Sara was as beautiful at 100 as a 20 year old.

He says that she died at the same time as Sara. Without the Chaf the remaining letters spell U'Lbita and for his daughter, as Avraham came to mourn both his wife and his daughter at the same time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>See the תורה שלמה:</p>\n\n<p>ולבכתה, כ׳ קטנה כל מי שאינו בוכה על אדם כשורה [כשר] כ״ף וכ״ף וכ״ף פורעין לו </p>\n\n<p><em>(מדרש אותיות קטנות)</em></p>\n\n<p>In the footnote he writes:</p>\n\n<p>ובהערות המו״ל בדפוס פריז מעיר אולי ר״ל מי שאינו מכה כף על כף.

For if it to be explained as my teachers have explained it that it refers to the reading in the synagogue in the morning as we do, why does [the talmud] say ''with the community''? It should say ''finish the פרשה with the translation''. But it definitely means as I said, literally with the community. Furthermore, what is the point? They will fulfill their obligation when they hear the reading in the synagogue. Even so, our practice is <em>the</em> practice, as sometimes he will lose concentration in the synagogue and fulfills his obligation with his previous reading.

It may be a wasted use of G-d's name, but it's not \"blasphemy\" per se. (Many people today might actually intend \"this G-ddamned hammer\", i.e. \"I assume G-d has already cursed this hammer\", which means you're not cursing anything with your statement. Just like calling something \"G-dforsaken.\")</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/b/l/l4407.htm\">Sanhedrin 56a</a>) explains that the only form of true \"blasphemy\", as described in <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=3&CHAPTER=24#C2665\">Leviticus 24:15</a>, would then be to curse G-d in a biblical sense, i.e. to say \"may Joe strike Joe\" (or \"may Joe damn Joe\", for that matter), substituting \"G-d\" for Joe. (Which is a bit strange, if someone doesn't believe in G-d, why they're calling on Him to smite anything, but never mind.) Maimonides, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1402.htm\">Laws of Foreign Worship 2:7</a> discusses the severity of punishment may depend on exactly which name of G-d is used, but in conclusion:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"<em>G-ddamn it</em>\", \"this <em>G-ddamn hammer</em>\", and the like are wasteful uses of G-d's name and should be avoided, but are not \"cursing G-d\" or \"blasphemy.\"</li>\n<li>Do not direct a \"<em>G-ddamn you</em>\" towards any person; especially not towards your parent; and definitely not towards G-d.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Would it matter whether he knew what its effect would be or not?</li>\n<li>And finally, if the answer to the above two is no, would he still be liable in the world to come (דיני שמים)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rambam, Laws of one who Injures or Damages, 2:7:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ז  המבעית את חברו--אף על פי שחלה מן הפחד, הרי זה פטור מדיני אדם; וחייב בדיני שמיים:  והוא שלא נגע בו, אלא כגון שצעק מאחוריו או נתראה לו באפילה וכיוצא בזה.  וכן אם צעק באוזנו, וחירשו--פטור מדיני אדם; וחייב בדיני שמיים.  אחזו, ותקע באוזנו וחירשו, או שנגע בו, ודחפו בעת שהבעיתו, או שאחז בבגדיו וכיוצא בדברים אלו--חייב בתשלומין.</p>\n<p>If one startles his fellow, even sickening him by fright: he is exempted from man's justice, but liable to Heaven. This assumes he never touched the person; rather, he yelled from behind him or suddenly appeared out of the darkness or the like. Similarly if he yelled in his ear and that deafened him, he is exempted from man's justice but liable to Heaven's accounting. If he grabbed him and yelled in his ear, deafening him; or touched him and pushed him when surprising him, or grabbed his clothing -- he would be obligated to pay restitution.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Throughout the discussion of damages in <em>Halacha</em>, courts can generally only punish for actions, not words. (Giving false testimony in court is the major exception.) The Talmud's examples of liability for \"embarrassment\" are spitting on someone, slapping them, or tearing off their clothes in public, not saying mean things to them. The Torah absolutely prohibits vicious speech as words can absolutely cut someone down, but we say that God will deal with such a person; it's not in the hands of our justice system.</p>\n<p>If running up and yelling <em>BOO!</em> at someone, giving them a heart attack, is \"guilty as far as God is concerned but not in our hands to punish\", I'd strongly assume that delivering shockingly bad news is in the same category. Now God only knows what I was or wasn't thinking or intending when delivering the bad news; but it's not in the place of our courts to deal with such an act.</p>\n<p>There is also discussion of whether killing someone by metaphysical means, e.g. calling out to God to strike them dead -- is considered murder vis-a-vis our courts. (For instance, the Midrashim that Moses killed the Egyptian assailant by invoking the name of God.) See section III of Rabbi JD Bleich's <a href=\"http://traditionarchive.org/news/_pdfs/0067-0086.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Liability for Harm Caused by Metaphysical Forces\"</a>, <em>Tradition</em> 46:1.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One of the baalei mussar was brought into shul by the Nazis and was told at gun-point to tear a sefer torah.

Who was included in the \"us\"?  What does Judaism believe with the \"Genesis plurals\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>According to Judaism God is indisputably one, not several beings in one (nor a member of a pantheon of gods).  So what does the use of first-person plural mean?  The predominant explanation is that God is addressing other (non-godly) beings, though some say God is speaking with himself (like one does when considering both sides of a dilemma).</p>\n\n<p>In B'reishit Rabbah (an early midrash collection) 8:3 Rabbis Yehoshua ben Levi and Shimon ben Nachman say that God is consulting the rest of creation, like a king who consults advisors.  R. Ammi says God is consulting his own heart.  On 8:4 R. Berekiah seems to say that God refers to mercy personified (God infuses man with mercy as part of creation, he says).  It's worth noting that the rabbis personify various attributes and inanimate objects quite a bit in the midrash; R. Berekiah isn't doing anything unusual here.</p>\n\n<p>In 8:5 R. Shimon reports an argument among the ministering angels about whether man should be created.  The Babylonian Talmud, Sanhedrin 38b, also addresses this idea; R. Yehudah said in the name of Rav that when God wanted to create man, he first created a company of ministering angels and then said to them \"is it your desire that we make man in our image?\".</p>\n\n<p>Why would God consult anyone?  B'reishit Rabbah 8:8 offers this (quoted from the Soncino translation):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Samuel b. Nahman said in R. Jonathan's name: When Moses was engaged in writing the Torah, he had to write the work of each day. When he came to the verse, AND GOD SAID: LET US MAKE MAN, etc., he said: ‘Sovereign of the Universe! Why dost Thou furnish an excuse to heretics?’ ‘Write,’ replied He; ' Whoever wishes to err may err.’ ' Moses,’ said the Lord to him, ‘this man that I have created -- do I not cause men both great and small to spring from Him? Now if a great man comes to obtain permission [for a proposed action] from one that is less than he, he may say, \" Why should I ask permission from my inferior!\" Then they will answer him, \" Learn from thy Creator, who created all that is above and below, yet when He came to create man He took counsel with the ministering angels.’\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Conclusion: God created all things and is the sole ruler of the universe.  But that doesn't mean that God didn't create and interact with divine beings (a heavenly court), just like he would later interact with earthly beings, and according to R. Shmuel he had an intentional educational purpose in doing so.</p>\n\n<p>Further reading: In compiling this answer I made significant use of <em>Sefer Ha-Aggadah</em> (English: <em>The Book of Legends</em>), compiled by Hayim Nachman Bialek and Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky, along with the sources I cited previously.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Saadiah Gaon to bereishis (1:26) says that \"let us make\" has the meaning of  singular even though it is in the plural because it is the \"majestatic way to speak\".

Does it claim the Bible is corrupted?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The context of that passage does not refer to Biblical corruption. The general chapter in Jeremiah concerns God's expressed frustration at the people for not listening to Jeremiah's prophesies. It is in this context that the scriptural passage appears, which is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אֵיכָה תֹאמְרוּ חֲכָמִים אֲנַחְנוּ וְתוֹרַת יְהֹוָה אִתָּנוּ אָכֵן הִנֵּה לַשֶּׁקֶר עָשָׂה עֵט שֶׁקֶר סֹפְרִים</p>\n  \n  <p>How can you say, \"We are wise, and we possess the Instruction of the Lord\"? Assuredly, for naught has the pen labored, for naught the scribes! [NJPS translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Obviously, the passage shouldn't be read on its own, and reading chapters 7 and 8 clarifies the subject as rebuking the people's stubbornness for not listening to the word of God. There are many Jewish commentators on this chapter, but here is one example, from the Radak:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אם תורת ה' אתכם מה תועיל אם לא תקיימו אותה מי שעשה הקולמוס לכתוב אותה לחנם עשה אותו וכן שקר סופרים הסופרים כתבו אותה לחנם כי אחרי שאין אתם מקיימין אותה הרי היא כאילו אינה כתובה לשקר לחנם כמו אך לשקר שמרתי</p>\n  \n  <p>If the Law of the Lord is with you what good is it if you do not fulfill it [the laws]? The same person who made the quill to write it did it in vain. And that is the meaning of the false scribes: the scribes wrote it for naught because afterward you didn't fulfill it. So it is as if it wasn't written but to lie in vain, as if to lie [and not the Law] is what I possess. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In summary, this has nothing to with a corrupt Bible but with a corrupt people who do not follow the Bible.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are there so few Jews if God promised Abraham his children would number like the stars?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>God promises Abraham a number of times that he would father a great nation whose numbers would be like the stars in the sky or the sand on the beach.</p>\n\n<p>However today there are less than 14 million Jews, hardly close the amount of stars visible with a mediocre telescope, while of course nowhere near the billions of stars in existence.</p>\n\n<p>How do you explain this unfulfilled promise?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Being as numerous as the stars nowadays would in fact be <em>inconsistent</em> with our current state, as in exile we now bear the burden of the terrible curses in Deuteronomy, one of which foretells our nation's size being very few, rather than numerous as the stars. See <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0528.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deut 28:62</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְנִשְׁאַרְתֶּם, בִּמְתֵי מְעָט, תַּחַת אֲשֶׁר הֱיִיתֶם, כְּכוֹכְבֵי הַשָּׁמַיִם לָרֹב:  כִּי-לֹא שָׁמַעְתָּ, בְּקוֹל יְהוָה אֱלֹהֶיךָ.</p>\n<p><sup>And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of heaven for multitude; because thou didst not hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is imagery. The promise was not that there would be exactly as many Israelites as stars. It was that this man without a child would have 'many, many' descendants, as has already been the case in history, and anyway, who knows how many Jews will yet exist in future as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The above blessing does not refer to numbers in one generation but to permanence for all time. Chinese are here today but who knows about tomorow. while the promise to avraham is that the Jews will be here forever and ever. This is something only God can guarantee. </p>\n\n<p>Related to this, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mark Twain</a> observed.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>”...If statistics are right, the Jews constitute but one percent of\n  the human race. It suggests a nebulous dim puff of stardust lost in\n  the blaze of the Milky way. properly, the Jew ought hardly to be heard\n  of, but he is heard of, has always been heard of. He is as prominent\n  on the planet as any other people, and his commercial importance is\n  extravagantly out of proportion to the smallness of his bulk. His\n  contributions to the world’s list of great names in literature,\n  science, art, music, finance, medicine, and abstruse learning are also\n  away out of proportion to the weakness of his numbers. He has made a\n  marvelous fight in this world, in all the ages; and had done it with\n  his hands tied behind him. He could be vain of himself, and be excused\n  for it.</p>\n  \n  <p>The Egyptian, the Babylonian, and the Persian rose, filled the planet\n  with sound and splendor, then faded to dream-stuff and passed away;\n  the Greek and the Roman followed; and made a vast noise, and they are\n  gone; other people have sprung up and held their torch high for a\n  time, but it burned out, and they sit in twilight now, or have\n  vanished. The Jew saw them all, beat them all, and is now what he\n  always was, exhibiting no decadence, no infirmities of age, no\n  weakening of his parts, no slowing of his energies, no dulling of his\n  alert and aggressive mind. All things are mortal but the Jew; all\n  other forces pass, but he remains. What is the secret of his\n  immortality?” </p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Mark Twain (“Concerning The Jews,” Harper’s Magazine, 1899)</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There is no such thing as \"technically Shabbos\" since it is either before or after <em>Sseth HaKokhavim</em> - which is itself <strong>the</strong> factor which determines which day it is, NOT the <em>havdalah</em> service. Thus, before <em>sseth</em> it is <em>Shabbath waddai</em> (\"Shabbos indeed\"), and if it is after <em>sseth</em> then it is <em>eino Shabbath</em> (\"not Shabbos\").</p>\n\n<p>However, it <strong><em>is</em></strong> <strong><em>assur le-khatehilah mi-de-rabbanan</em></strong> to do <em>melakhah</em> before one is <em>mavdil</em> either <em>be-tefillath aravith</em> or <em>`al ha-kos</em> (i.e. recites <em>havdalah</em> either in the evening prayer or over a cup).</p>\n\n<p>So, to directly answer your question: Yes, there is a problem with doing <em>melakhah</em> (or presumably making <em>hakhanoth</em> for the following day) before one recites <em>havdalah</em>. It is not, however, a problem because of the <em>issur</em> of <em>hakhanoth</em> on <em>Shabbath</em> for a weekday since it is no longer <em>Shabbath,</em> but falls under the general rabbinic prohibition of resuming <em>melakhah</em> before the <em>havdalah</em> is recited.</p>\n\n<p>However, if you have already recited <em>ha-Mavdil ben qodhesh le-hol</em> in your <em>tefillath `aravith</em>, then you are allowed to do <em>melakhah</em>, as long as you do not eat or drink (with the exception of water) until you also recite <em>havdalah</em> on a <em>kos</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>See</strong> - <em>Mishneh Torah, Hilkhoth Shabbath 29:5-7; Arokh HaShulhan OH 299:19</em></p>\n\n\n",

And what does Pshat mean, exactly?</p>\n<p>On the first, I would compare it to the introduction to Ein Yaakov from Rabbi Avraham Ben HaRambam where he says <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Ein_Yaakov/Introduction\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there are 5 levels to drash</a> similarly to Pshat, there are different levels to it (I'm not saying that they correspond to those 5 levels - I'm just illustrating the concept).</p>\n<p>So what is Pshat? As I heard from Rabbi Elimelech Zwiebel, Pshat means the understand that comes from the text without adding concepts that are not required by the text - but the totality of the text, not just a specific verse in isolation.</p>\n<p>So according to all of that, sometimes the plain text stands on its own. Sometimes, however, the plain text doesn't work on its own. It poses unanswered questions. This is the plain text telling you you need to add a level of hagada that is in harmony with the plain text, but isn't what the plain text (פשוטו של מקרא) tells you. So Rashi adds ולאגדה המיישבת דברי המקרא.</p>\n<p>However, there are entire areas of אגדה which would be completely unrelated to pshat. For example, Berishis Rabba describes the beginning of Vayerah as Avraham sitting in front of Gehennom (like the heat of the day) keeping all those with a Bris out. That has no relationship to what is intrinsically understood from the text, and thus has no place in Pshat.</p>\n<p>Sometimes such an Aggada would explain problems in the text, but it is still <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/31404/is-rashi-teasing-us/31436#31436\">too far away from Pshat</a> for Rashi to include it, although he may allude to it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe himself pointed out that Rashi in the <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=15778#p=p13\" rel=\"nofollow\">first (edited) Rashi Sicha (Likutei Sichot Vol 5, pg 13, footnote 2)</a>, and he said that there are a few levels of \"Pshat\".</p>\n\n<p>He said that one cannot explain this to mean that Rashi will quote Medrash here and there, since there are times when Rashi says \"I don't know the meaning of this verse\" when there are explicit Midrashim which explain them (sometimes partly quoted by Rashi!).</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, there are times when Rashi says \"I don't know\" when he himself explained it in his peirush on Gemara.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>On Chayei Sarah from Likkutei Sichot 15 p.135ff, the Rebbe gives an analysis of a difficult Rashi, and explains his approach there. To summarise:</p>\n<p>Rashi is here to explain the pshat. Therefore, Rashi rarely cites sources, even if they are from the teachings of Chazal, because he assumes that Chazal are only coming to explain the simple meaning of the verse. This applies even if he is quoting midrash, because in those cases, the midrash is indeed coming to teach the pshat. This answers how \"aggada\" can be involved in his commentary - \"aggada\" and \"midrash\" (despite the name) aren't always <em>drash</em>!</p>\n<p>However, Rashi <em>sometimes</em> will quote a drash, especially when there is a problem figuring out the pshat. <strong>See what the Rebbe says in Likkutei Sichot 15 p.27, footnote 2, on Bereshit 3:8</strong> to answer your question. In these cases he will preface with \"Our Sages darshend...\". Except when he doesn't (hence the <em>sicha</em> on a Rashi that the Rebbe finds problematic for this approach - there are exceptions to every rule).</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Minhag of married women shaving during marriage",
    "content": "# Minhag of married women shaving during marriage\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The custom for married women to shave their heads is, evidently, a fairly widespread custom that exists at least amongst (certain) <em>Hasidim</em>. I have heard a variety of supposed, non-authoritative explanations for this practice, but, hitherto, I have been unable to find an explicit, written source. It would be greatly appreciated if some light were shed on this subject matter, particularly the following questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What is the source/origin of this <em>minhag</em>? What is the underlying reasoning behind it? Is it primarily <em>halakhic</em>? Kabbalistic? Cultural? Historically speaking, how old is it? </li>\n<li>Sociologically speaking, who abides by this custom? For instance, some (e.g. Satmar) clearly do adhere to this practice whilst others (e.g. Sepharadim) clearly do not. My understanding had been that this was an exclusively hasidic minhag. Is this truly so? Are there non-<em>Hasidim/Misnagdim</em> who hold this way? If so, who? Conversely, are there <em>Hasidim</em> who <strong>don't</strong> practice this? If so, who, and why?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>Rav Herschel Schachter told me that the reason they do it is because they are afraid that a hair will be left out of the mikveh when they do tevila. To avoid this problem they shave their heads. I have also heard that they suspect that there will be tangles, which are חציצה for the tevila, so they shave their heads. Neither of these reasons would really justify literally shaving all the hair off, just cutting it short. In terms of an esoteric reason, I have heard that it is an extra ''dose'' of צניעות, modesty, to combat a growing פריצות, immodesty. Sociologically, I have never heard of anyone but chassidim practicing this, which would lead me to assume that it was not practiced before the Advent of chassidus. (This is not exactly מוכרח, as it could be that the places that became hotspots of chassidim were already doing this.) </p>\n\n<p>The גמרא in Nedarim says that a man can undo his wife's נזירות, as it\n is considered a ''matter that comes between them'' (דברים שבינו\n לבינה), as he can claim that ''I can't stand a woman with a shaved\n head'' (אי אפשי באשה מגולחת), as a נזיר must shave his/ her head once\n he/she is done with the נזירות. It seems fairly evident that head-shaving was not normative practice (at least in the times of the גמרא) and that it is so extreme that it can be called ''something that comes between them''. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>These are vey good questions and I do not have all the answers, but one thing I wish to clarify as this misconception is quite widespread: <strong>this custom was not invented by Hassidim. In fact, this custom predates chassidus and possibly dates back to the days of the rishonim.</strong> See for example Shut tashbatz part 3, 299, where he mentions a custom of קציצת הפיאות כמשפט הבנות on the day the girls get married. However, this could simply be interpreted as a reference to a practical haircut that newlyweds used to get, and not a complete shave. But if it is indeed a reference to the shaving custom, then it is probably the earliest source to mention this (unless we count the Zohar which is unlikely to have been followed at that point).</p>\n\n<p>(The passage in the Rambam cited by Robert S. Barnes forbidding Jewish women to shave can further be interpreted as a polemic against his fellow Sephardic Jews who followed this custom. In fact the Rambam himself demurs to a similar custom in Egypt, where the bride would dress like a male and dance with a sword under the chuppa in front of the men. This letter has been cited in full in the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/13419\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefer Maaseh Rokeach</a>. The shaving custom if followed by Sephardim in the days of the Rambam may well be linked to this <em>cross dressing</em> theme/ritual observed by Egyptian Jews as the Rambam's letter attests to.)</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward a few hundred years we find the Chasam sofer mentioning this same custom in his responsa YD (siman 195) in which he discusses the problems that arise from it in relation to tevila/immersion. The Netziv mentions this custom in his sefer Haamek Shaala part 12, 95 (responsa) as well, and calls it a custom that was \"instituted by the Rabbis\" suggesting that this custom is quite old. There he also discusses why this custom was not followed in the times of the Mishna. This custom is also briefly mentioned in the sefer keli chemda. </p>\n\n<p><strong>By now it should be clear that this custom is not exclusive to chassidim (chasam sofer and netziv were not chassidim I assure you), and that it predates the establishment of chassidus.</strong> For some reason (most likely because it smacks of superstition) this custom was completely forsaken by the majority of Jewish kehilot, and was only preserved by a handful of Chassidim and by some yekki communities, but as I have shown, this picture does not do justice to the reality in the old European communities where this custom was widespread.</p>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menashe_Klein\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Menashe Klein</a> (in <a href=\"http://www.tshuvos.com/showSefer.asp?sefer=Beis_Shearim_Yore_Dea_1&name=%E1%E9%FA%20%F9%F2%F8%E9%ED%20%E9%E5%F8%E4%20%E3%F2%E4%20%E7%EC%F7%20%E0&min=1&max=283&seperator=no&numCode=276\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishneh halachos</a> my main source here) this custom was instituted by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Four_Lands\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Council of Four Lands</a>. However this does not necessarily preclude an earlier date for this custom, as they may have merely been the ones who standardized it, but the custom may have been around well before it became widespread in Europe. You can read <a href=\"http://www.tshuvos.com/showSefer.asp?sefer=Beis_Shearim_Yore_Dea_1&name=%E1%E9%FA%20%F9%F2%F8%E9%ED%20%E9%E5%F8%E4%20%E3%F2%E4%20%E7%EC%F7%20%E0&min=1&max=283&seperator=no&numCode=276\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for more on this, and the reasons behind this bizarre custom. </p>\n\n<p>The most likely origin for this custom is the Zohar. In two places (Parshas Naso and Pinchas) the Zohar encourages women (particularly menstruating) to shave. In one place the niddah is encouraged to burn her hair because the hair is contaminated and dangerous. In another place the niddah is encouraged to shave before she immerses in the mikveh, in order to make her more pure and fit for her husband. So the origin is most probably kabbalistic.   </p>\n\n<p>Before I close this discussion I would like to note that this custom is also found by the ancient people of Sparta; they had a similar custom of shaving off the head of the bride that was about to marry, and like the Egyptian Jewish brides, mentioned earlier, they dressed like men on the day of the wedding as well, see <a href=\"http://www.legendsandchronicles.com/ancient-civilizations/ancient-sparta/spartan-women/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>sorry for my english: from the Torah you see that married women did not shave there hairs.Starting with the captive women, the wife of one ben peleg, the sota ceremony etc etc...Opposite you will see that shaving the hairs means humiliating ( sota, captive women etc..) not talking about the women that help the nazi during the war. I heard that the origin of shaving women hairs was in the midle age in order for the jewish new kala to escape ( not being desirable ) the droit de seigneur.</p>\n\n\n",

Hence, the fact that tzitzis aren't in the list of clothing is not a problem; they aren't commanded in wearing an extra garment to put on tzitzis, just as no Jew is obligated (strictly speaking) to do so. </p>\n\n<p>However, the kohanim actually should be obligated in tzitzis, because they might have been  wearing a four-cornered garment: the me'il. However, this depends on what the me'il actually looked like (there are four different opinions). The <strong>real</strong> question is, if the Meil had four corners, did the kohanim put tzitzis on the me'il, and if not, why not?</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Radvaz</strong> in his commentary to the Rambam (Hilchos Klei Hamikdash 9:3) asks this question on the Rambam, and answers that despite the fact that the garment technically had four corners, these were all attached towards the top, and so the meil wasn't really a four cornered garment (this has significant halakhic importance). </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>Minchas Chinuch</strong> (Mitzvah 99, by R. Yosef Babad) writes that the garments of the kohanim didn't require tzitzis because they belonged to <em>hekdesh</em>, and they weren't the property of the kohanim (a borrowed garment doesn't require tzitzis). After all, the Gemara in Kiddushin 54a states: that a kohen cannot use his garment to affect kiddushin, which requires ownership of the object used for betrothal. However, the question of whether or not kohanim own their garments isn't necessarily so clear-cut.</p>\n\n<p><strong>R. Gershon Chanoch Henoch Leiner</strong>, in his book \"Ein HaTecheilis\" argues on the Minchas Chinuch and explains that the reason for the exemption from tzitzis is merely a 'gezairas hakasuv'. In other words, Hashem told Moshe to make a Meil, and the description doesn't include tzitzis, end of story. </p>\n\n<p>He also quotes a Zohar that explains this '<em>geziras hakasuv</em>' by saying that the bells and pomegranates that were on the bottom of the Meil served the same purpose as the tzitzis serve on a regular garment. </p>\n\n<p>(All of these opinions are quoted and discussed by R. Menachem Mendel Kasher in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51492&st=&pgnum=183\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Shelaima, vol. 23 pg 177</a>) </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The commentaries on the Rambam discuss it, with regards to the Me'il (which appears to have had four corners). If there were fringes attached, it's missing from any documentation we have about them! </p>\n\n<p><em>Minchas Mordechai al haTorah</em> discusses this question and several proposed answers, but the strongest one appears to be that when the Torah says \"put fringes on the your four-cornered garments\", that applies only to personally-owned garments. The Kohen Gadol's garments were considered Temple property and not personally-owned.</p>\n\n<p>At any point the Kohen was wearing non-personally-owned garments, he wasn't expected to have fringes on them. When his shift was over and changed out of them into his personal clothes (which in ancient times, usually had four corners), those would have had tzitzis. </p>\n\n<p>We don't want to be people who \"avoid\" a mitzva, and thus today we wear four-cornered garments so we can put fringes on them. However, if someone found themselves in a situation where for legitimate reasons they couldn't wear a personally-owned four-cornered garment today, it's not that they failed their obligation \"though shalt wear a fringed four-cornered garment\"; it's that they didn't get a chance to connect to G-d via \"if you wear a four-cornered garment, put fringes on it.\" So if the kohen gadol had a particularly busy day in the Temple and couldn't wear personally-owned clothes at any time from dawn till dusk, I doubt he'd be taken to task for it.</p>\n\n<p>(Nor could a kohen on-duty wear a personally-owned <em>tzitzis</em> garment in addition to his standard uniform. While serving in the Temple, they have to wear the listed clothes, no more no less.)</p>\n\n<p>A similar question comes up with regards to Tefilin. Rambam explains that there was room below the turban to wear <em>Tefilin shel rosh</em>; however there was no way to wear the <em>shal yad</em> -- both the tefilin and the <em>ketonet</em>'s sleeve must be worn directly on the skin of the arm -- they're not mutually compatible!

The case hasn't been made that Reform or Conservative Judaism is idolatry, and even if it <em>were</em> made, it must surely be less so than Christianity, which elevates a human to divine status -- so if you can go into the church basement to vote, why not the synagogue basement to take the SAT?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Dov Lior of Kiryat Arba instructs Orthodox Jews to steer clear of participating in any events held by Reform Jews and prohibits entering their synagogues.</p>\n\n\n",

There had been a situation previously that the daughter had been calling this boy because she thought maybe they'd get married one day (this girl unfortunately has emotional problems, depression, etc -- of course due to the unfortunate situation that her Father passed away when she was a little girl.) The boy saw the mother and daughter were in his house and pretty much told them to \"get out\" in a not such nice way. They immediately left feeling completely ashamed, embarrassed, broken, etc. The mother hasn't stepped foot into the house since this incident. Not having neighbors to go to has left them even more broken -- especially since these neighbors were so inviting. The daughter said she forgives him, however the Mother is still quite upset about what happened to her and as well that her daughter was insulted (since this incident the emotional problems and depression have worsen.) In any case the right thing to do now is obviously that this boy should apologize AT LEAST to the Mother.

    "content": "# Why is Moshiach a “fundamental belief” (iqar)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In what sense is belief in the eventual coming of Moshiach fundamental to Judaism? Rambam famously includes it as the twelfth in his list of <em>iqarim</em>, but why?</p>\n\n<p>Considering the other <em>iqarim</em>, Judaism would be very different without them—non-existent or nonsensical without some. But it seems to me that if we had been promised something else in place of a restoration of the Davidic monarchy (a generic “Messianic Age”, or a Torah republic, <em>etc.</em>) there wouldn’t be much difference in Jewish practice or thought.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I’m <strong><em>not</em></strong> asking whether belief in Moshiach is required; I’m assuming that since Moshiach is prophesied, belief in the eventual redemption and restoration of the Davidic monarchy is a necessary consequence of belief in <em>nevu’ah</em>. I’m also <strong><em>not</em></strong> asking why a <em>melekh hamoshiach</em> is needed (rather than the alternatives I mentioned above). I’m <strong><em>only</em></strong> asking why (or, in what sense) this belief is part of Judaism’s foundations rather than being one of its consequences.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It is part of the fundamental principle of yichud Hashem - that not only is there only one God, but God alone has full control of the the world and His will reigns supreme. The Ramchal starts off <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51283&st=&pgnum=45&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">klach pitchei chachma</a> discussing this. (See also Daat Tevunot). </p>\n\n<p>There he explains that everything in the world, (even what a human being does with free will such as sinning) must be authorized by God. Even when a person commits a sin, it must first be authorized by Him and He considers how it will fit in His divine plan of total rectification in the end. This rectification will be accomplished through either repentance or punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Without this fundamental belief, the Ramchal explains, one can assert that the Jews sinned against God and \"ruined\" His plan, and are therefore eternally damned (as some Christians believe). </p>\n\n<p>Hence, the belief in Messiah is the belief that history is not a chain of events going nowhere, but there is a plan for creation and that God has exclusive control of that plan and history is inevitably moving towards this goal.</p>\n\n<p>(this last statement by an <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/audio/m04-3_flaws_of_man_and_role_of_jews.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow\">audio</a> from Rabbi Uziel Milevsky zt'l)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the Hattam Soffer (Responsa vol II YD 356) it is not, to use the OP's words \"part of Judaism’s foundations\", but rather, is \"one of its consequences\":</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך א\"א לי בשום אופן להאמין שיהי' גאולתינו א' מעיקרי הדת ושאם יפול היסוד תפול החומה חלילה ושנאמר אלו הי' ח\"ו חטאנו גורמים שיגרש אותנו גירוש עולם וכדס\"ל לר\"ע בעשרת השבטים שהם נדחים לעולם המפני זה רשאים הם לפרוק עול מלכות השמים או לשנות קוצו של יו\"ד /י'/ אפי' מדברי רבנן חלילה אנחנו לא נעבוד ה' לאכול פרי הארץ ולשבוע מטוב' לעשות רצונך אלקי חפצתי ועכ\"פ ועל כל אופן עבדי ד' אנחנו יעשה עמנו כרצונו וחפצו ואין זה עיקר ולא יסוד לבנות עליו שום בנין </p>\n  \n  <p>However, I cannot believe that our redemption would be one of the principles of our faith, and that if this pillar  would fall, then the wall would fall, heaven fore-fend, and that if heaven fore-fend, our sins would cause that He expel us eternally - and as R. Akiva reckoned regarding the ten tribes; that they are eternally rejected. Would this be grounds to reject the yolk of heaven,  or to change the dot of an i of even a rabbinic matter. Heaven fore-fend! We will not serve God to eat the fruit of the land and to sate ourselves from its goodness; it is to do your will, my God that I have desired! And in every way and circumstance, we are servants of God, he will do with us according to his will and desire. And this is not a pillar nor a foundation upon which to build any structure. (trans. my own).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Instead, he asserts that its importance stems from the fact that this is a prophecy:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אך כיון שעיקר יסוד הכל להאמין בתורה ובנביאים ושם נאמר גאולתינו האחרונה בפ' נצבים ובפ' האזינו כמ\"ש רמב\"ן שם והרבה מזה בדברי נביאים אם כן מי שמפקפק על הגאולה הלז הרי כופר בעיקר האמנת התורה והנביאים.</p>\n  \n  <p>Nevertheless, since the ultimate principle of everything is to believe in the Torah and Prophets, and our final redemption is stated there, in the Parsha of Nizavim, as Ramban stated there, and the words of the prophets include much of this, therefore, one who casts doubt on the redemption denies the principle of belief in the Torah and Prophets. (trans. my own.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is a fascinating alternative understanding.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question assumes that the Ikkar is independent of a generic Messianic age. Rather the Ikkar is about it being fundamental to believe in a Messianic age. The Ikkar is:</p>\n\n<p>1) That the complete fulfillment of Torah and Mitzvos is the purpose of the world.\n2) That G-d will ultimately make that happen through Moshiach.\n3) To want that to happen.</p>\n\n<p>If someone doesn't think that about Torah and Mitzvos, then they are fundamentally missing something, not really different than someone fully keeping Torah and Mitzvos but not really believing reward and punishment - it takes it that they are of no real consequence.</p>\n\n<p>This is from an article from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoel_Kahn\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi Yoel Kahn</a> in one of his articles from the series called Macheves HaChassidus which was printed regularly in Kfar Chabad Magazine over 20 years ago. I have a binding of a bunch of those articles that was made as a special printing back in the day, and the one I'm referring to is titled למה האמונה בביאת המשיח היא יסוד בדת? on page 132. Part of this book was re-typeset and reprinted in 2001 and is available <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/31639\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, but that is only volume one, which does not cover this article. Perhaps a volume 2 exists or is coming out (the Rabbi is still alive and actively writing).</p>\n\n<p>On the specific question of why Moshiach and not without a king, that is a detail, not unlike why believing in Chabakkuk is a necessary part of the Ikkarim, even though Chabakkuk on his own isn't fundamental to Judaism. Similarly, although Moshiach as a king of specified linage is a specific detail of Messianic Redemption, it is the general concept he is tied to that makes it fundamental. </p>\n\n<p>That last paragraph is not in the article I mentioned. However, he does explore the difference between what is fundamental and what is not. What is not fundamental, if someone mistakenly believes something (in my example above, it would be that there was no such prophet as Chabakkuk) out of ignorance, that is just ignorance, not a lacking in his faith. But if he doesn't believe in an Ikkar, then his faith is bad. (If memory serves, that distinction is from Rav Chaim Brisker).</p>\n\n\n",

Since Scripture wrote: “Isaac the son of\n  Abraham,” it had to say: “Abraham begot Isaac,” <strong>because the scorners\n  of the generation were saying that Sarah had conceived from Abimelech,\n  for she had lived with Abraham for many years and had not conceived\n  from him.</strong> What did the Holy One, blessed be He, do? He shaped the\n  features of Isaac’s face to resemble Abraham’s, and everyone attested\n  that Abraham had begotten Isaac. This is the meaning of what is\n  written here: “Isaac, the son of Abraham,” because here is proof that\n  “Abraham begot Isaac.” - [From Midrash Tanchuma, Toledoth 1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why would the scorners think that? I suppose it was well known that Avraham already had a son (Yishmael) from Hagar - so wouldn't that fact make it clear that it was Sarah that was barren?</p>\n\n<p>So then I thought: 'Well, that's why they are <em>scorners</em> - they don't need to be logical'</p>\n\n<p>But then, why would Hashem  pay attention to illogical nonsense?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <em>K'li Yakar</em> suggests that later scorners would argue additionally that one of Yitzchak's sons was evil, so the great Avraham could not be Yitzchak's father. (This is why, says the <em>K'li Yakar</em>, the next verse points out that Rivka's brother was the wicked Lavan, and it was from her family that Esav inherited his nature). To preempt this, Yitzchak's appearance was made to resemble Avraham.</p>\n\n<p>As far as your final question, I heard somewhere (if someone could find a source it would be much appreciated) that the nature of scoffery is that it is contagious, yet impervious to logic. Therefore, the only way to undermine the nonsensical slander was with a clear sign that would be visible to everyone - the resemblance between Avraham and Yitzchak (see also <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=22&daf=87&format=text\"><em>Bava M'tzia'</em> 87a</a>, היו כל אומות העולם מרננים ואומרים ראיתם זקן וזקנה שהביאו אסופי מן השוק... ועדיין היו מרננים ואומרים אם שרה הבת תשעים שנה תלד אברהם בן מאה שנה יוליד מיד נהפך קלסתר פנים של יצחק ונדמה לאברהם פתחו כולם ואמרו אברהם הוליד את יצחק ; <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=21&daf=97b&format=text\"><em>Bava Kamma</em> 97b</a>, ואיזהו מטבע של אברהם אבינו זקן וזקינה מצד אחד ובחור ובתולה מצד אחר).</p>\n\n\n",

The printing aspect is hugely important; before that any Jewish work (any work in general) was competing for scribal time & effort. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<h2><strong>RISHONIM</strong></h2>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://seforimcenter.com/Seder-HaDorot/Seder-HaDorot-HaKatzar---Rabbi-Shlomo-Benizri__p-789-3876.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Seder HaDoros HaKotzair</a> by Rabbi Shlomo Benizri (starting p.135) he dates the period of Rishonim from 1040-1515 and writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לאחר שקיעת הגאונים בבבל, גלגלה ההשגחה שגדולי התורה יעברו למקומות נוספים בעולם ששם לא היו גדולי תורה בעלי שעור קומה שיוכלו לפתח את התורה ביתר שאת</p>\n<p>הגאונים שחיו אז בבבל סבלו רבות מהפרסים שנטלו את ממונם ובטלום מלימודם. חלק מהם יצאו בספינות אל ארצות שונות לערוך מגביות עבור הכנסת כלה וכדומה</p>\n<p>בשנת 4723 (962 לספה\"נ) מספר גאונים מבבל, הפליגו להם בספינה אחת למטרת הכנסת כלה כשבראשם היה רבי משה בר חנוך. ספינה זו נפלה בידי שודדים שלקחו את השבויים והציגום בפני קהילות ישראל במקומות שוניםם, במטרה שיפדו אותם</p>\n<p>After the fall of the Geonim in Babylon, providence beckoned that the Torah greats would move to other places in the world where there were no Torah greats of equal stature who could develop the Torah even more.</p>\n<p>The Geonim who lived then in Babylon suffered a lot from the Persians who took away their money and deprived them of their studies.

The period of the Rishonim began after the fall of the Geonim in Babylon (actually with the death of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hai_ben_Sherira\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Hai Gaon</a>), and the transfer of Torah centres to the rest of the world and especially to Spain.</p>\n<p>The first were scattered in all the lands of the Diaspora.

But I will do my best to cite some of the \"theories\" explaining what is essentially a sociological observation: by some time in history, rabbinic authors imagined themselves as belonging to a different historical era than that of their predecessors although the nature of this perception is itself complex (see the Havlin article listed below). Your questions asks about the Rishonim/Acharonim divide, but I will just throw out this podcast about the Savoraim/Geonim/Rishonim divide, because a lot of the sources and discussion there is also relevant here: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/6gkACSbNSDpb0RN38NO8dW?si=4b4034bfff294ff3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Rishonim Podcast Episode 2</a>.</p>\n<p>So first, here are two rabbinic theories I've sees as to how/why this split occurred:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>R. Elchanan Wasserman</strong> quotes his teacher <strong>R. Yisrael ha-Kohen (the \"Chofetz Chaim\")</strong>, who says that even though every generation decreases in greatness, sometimes there is a discontinuity in the flow of generational decline. He adds that this would be something evident to all the living rabbis of the time, when a particular person passes away who towers over his contemporaries so completely that all who remain recognize that an epoch has passed. He says that this occurred with the death of R. Hai Gaon to end the time of the Geonim, and \"Rabbi Akiva Eiger said about the Vilna Gaon\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>R. Yaakov Kamanetsky</strong> (<em>Emes L'Yaakov Bamidbar Ch 9, cf also Shemos Ch 24</em> and <em>Emes L'Yaakov Avos 1:1</em>) writes sort of similarly, saying that the last member of the \"era\" is the greatest, but puts the emphasis on codification, saying that the end of an era comes when this great rabbi will compile all the teachings of the previous generations into a code of some kind to signify the era's conclusion. Both of these sources are available on the above-linked <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kLWjTHPxmD1NDESzpElZlS88TUbFxJYGN7CRLyzekLs/edit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">podcast sourcesheet, here</a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Among academics, I believe that the predominant historical theory for this phenomenon (<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/7968712/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%91%D7%9C_%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%95%D7%90%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D_Antiqui_et_Moderni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">detailed in an article available here</a>) is that 'periodization' occurs due to some crisis within a society that creates the perception that the post-crisis society cannot recreate the conditions that existed previously. It has been variously proposed that this could be applied to the \"end of the Rishonim\" due to either (1) the Rindtfliesh massacres (around 1300AD) and other associated persecutions up to and including those in the wake of the Black Death (a few decades later) in Central Europe, (2) the century of Spanish persecution leading up to the Inquisition (1391-1492), or (3) the social upheaval precipitated by the rise of printing (or some combination thereof). This complicated theory would mean that the \"end of the Rishonim\" did not occur all at once and likely occurred in different places at different times (i.e., there were still \"Rishonim\" living in Spain in the 15th century, while the rabbis of Poland thought that the last Rishonim were the Rosh and his sons). In fact, the 1972 Encyclopedia Judaica article on \"halakha\" by Louis Jacobs states that the Rishonim ended in the 16th century with the printing of the Shulhan Aruch, while the article on \"Rishonim\" by Yisrael Ta-Shema says that it ended a century earlier with the deaths of the Maharil and Terumas haDeshen.</p>\n<p>There is so <em><strong>so</strong></em> much nuance here (like, did you know the Ramban thought of the Rif as the last Rishon and himself/the Rambam as \"Acharonim,\" and R. Saadiah ibn Danan thinks that the Rambam is the last \"Rishon,\" and the Hagahos Maimonios implies that his teacher Maharam of Rothenburg is the \"last of the great ones\", etc. etc.) and so I encourage you to keep poking at it.

Are there any sources saying that it is a Halachic problem pronouncing the cholam like a tzeirei?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It's generally accepted that traditional pronunciation schemes for Hebrew are always halachically acceptable. The basic mekor for this is that the Gemara (e.g. Megillah 24b, brought down by the Shulchan Aruch) implies that there are halachic problems with pronouncing ayin as aleph. Numerous mefarshim qualify that this does not apply in a place where the common pronunciation merges these sounds; the problem is only if this is an uncommon or distracting pronunciation in the locale where it is being used (see the mefarshim on the Shulchan Aruch which brings the previous Gemara down, c.f. <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=919&st=&pgnum=299&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">Igros Moshe OC 3:5</a>).</p>\n\n<p>While the sources generally refer to pronunciation differences in general, there are a few specific references to the Litvish pronunciation. Aruch Hashulchan OC 62:2 specifically states that it is acceptable that many Litvaks pronounce cholam as /ej/, and both sin and shin as /s/ (the infamous \"Sabosdiker losn\"), although he mentions that a person who is careful to pronounce the words \"avodah\" and \"aveidah\" differently will be rewarded greatly (since the word \"aveidah\" has highly negative connotations). I also remember a source poking fun at Litvaks for pronouncing \"kavod va'oz\" as \"kaveid va'eiz\" (\"liver and goat\"), although at the moment I can't seem to find it.</p>\n\n\n",

But, according to a summary of the issue <a href=\"http://jewishworker.blogspot.com/2005/06/when-is.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> indicates that the gemara's view was that tzeis was a mathematical construct, not a function of simple visibility so regardless of the lighting, tzeis would be reckoned the same way. To wit:</p>\n\n<p>\"In Shabbos (34) R' Yehuda says that from suntil until צאת הכוכבים is 3/4 of a mil (we will define how long a mil is later).

Would he have a solid understanding of Jewish law and Jewish thought?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>From the Rambam's introduction to the Mishna Torah:</p>\n\n<p>ומפני זה נערתי חצני, אני משה ברבי מיימון הספרדי, ונשענתי על הצור ברוך הוא, ובינותי בכל אֵלו הספרים, וראיתי לחבר דברים המתבררים מכל אֵלו החיבורין בענין האסור והמותר, והטמא והטהור, עם שאר דיני התורה, כולן בלשון ברורה ודרך קצרה, עד שתהא תורה שבעל פה כולה סדורה בפי הכל בלא קושיא ולא פירוק. לא זה אומר בכה וזה אומר בכה, אלא דברים ברורים, קרובים נכונים, על פי המשפט אשר יתבאר מכל אלו החיבורין והפירושין הנמצאים מימות רבינו הקדוש ועד עכשיו.\n עד שיהיו כל הדינים גלוים לקטן ולגדול, בדין כל מצוה ומצוה, ובדין כל הדברים שתיקנו חכמים ונביאים. כללו של דבר: <strong>כדי שלא יהא אדם צריך לחיבור אחר בעולם בדין מדיני ישראל, אלא יהא חיבור זה מְקַבֵּץ לתורה שבעל פה כולה</strong>, עם התקנות והמנהגות והגזירות שנעשו מימות משה רבינו ועד חיבור התלמוד, וכמו שפירשו לנו הגאונים בכל חיבוריהן שחיברו אחר התלמוד. <strong>לפיכך קראתי שם חיבור זה \"משנה תורה\", לפי שאדם קורא בתורה שבכתב תחילה, ואחר כך קורא בזה ויודע ממנו תורה שבעל פה כולה, ואינו צריך לקרות ספר אחר ביניהם</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>He writes that he has done all the heavy work having studied all of Halacha and distilled and organized them into a single work so that one has no need to repeat the hard work and simply refer to the finished product.</p>\n\n<p>Did he succeed? Open up any classic version of the Mishneh Torah and you will see countless commentaries both debating and explaining the Rambam. We still learn the Talmud, and we still refer to later codes such as the Tur and Shulchan Aruch.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the Mishneh Torah was the last comprehensive code to cover all areas of Halacha. The only exception I can think of would be the Aruch HaShulchan/Aruch HaShulchan HaAtid. (Of course, today we have the Encyclopedia Talmudit which will be the next comprehensive and well organized summary of all of Halacha. But that's the work of several teams of rabbis, spanning generations.) Anyone who studies practical halacha will willy-nilly refer to the Rambam. Even one who opens a Mishnah Brura is indirectly leaning on the Rambam, since the MB is based on the Shulchan Aruch/Yosef Karo who in turn based his decisions on the Rambam, Rif and Rosh. On that level, the Rambam did succeed in writing a final and comprehensive code.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, while the Mishneh Torah may not be the final or only sefer required, it's one of the very few that are (implictly) indispensable for all practical halachic study and decision making.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishna already wrote in his hakdama that if you don't know the appropriate seder of shas before learning those sefarim of the Rambam then you simply won't understand what he's saying. So it would seem to me that it is impossible to \"know what you need to know\" by simply reading the Rambam. If you learn later works like the Mishna Berura who fill in a lot of information then you may come out knowing what to do, but that is only because the Mishna Berura learned the sugya extremely thoroughly beforehand in order to figure out what the Rambam/Shulchan Aruch etc. meant by what they said. The Rambam bases every halacha on multiple different ma'amarei chazal and with his own intricate and genius way of learning them up, which can sometimes be not like the pashtus. Take the sugya of \"Shvuas Rav Huna\" for example (Bava Metzia 34b) where every sefer you'll ever read for the rest of your life has their own pshat in the Rambam for what the \"ikar shvuah\" is. And there is no shortage of sugyos like this.</p>\n\n\n",

One part of this, Verses 27 - 28, comprises a short, three-sentence response by Lavan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כז. וַיֹּאמֶר אֵלָיו לָבָן אִם נָא מָצָאתִי חֵן בְּעֵינֶיךָ נִחַשְׁתִּי וַיְבָרֲכֵנִי יְהֹוָה בִּגְלָלֶךָ‏‏‏‏</p>\n<p>כח. וַיֹּאמַר נָקְבָה שְׂכָרְךָ עָלַי וְאֶתֵּנָה</p>\n<p><strong>27</strong> And Laban said to him, \"If only I have now found favor in your eyes! I have divined, and the Lord has blessed me for your sake.\"</p>\n<p><strong>28</strong> Then he said, \"Specify your wages for me, and I will give [them].\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Oddly, the break between the fourth and fifth readings of the parasha is between these two verses. There's no paragraph break here, and there's nothing particularly sad in the surrounding text. Two nearby places that this break could possibly have been without breaking up an individual's speeach are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Between Verses 24 and 25, dividing between the sequence of Ya'akov's children being born (and ending with an explicit prayer to God) and Ya'akov's negotiation with Lavan.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Between Verses 30:43 and 31:1, dividing between Ya'akov becoming wealthy and the sequence leading up to his departure from Lavan's area.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why isn't the split in one of those places, rather than where it breaks up a two-verse speech and a ten-verse dialogue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to the interpretation of these verses in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow\">R' Samson Raphael Hirsch</a>'s <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0910818126\" rel=\"nofollow\">commentary</a>, perhaps this break serves to underscore something that the text already tells us with the repeated \"and he said\" - that Lavan paused after Verse 24, hoping for a response from Ya'akov, and continued only after he saw that Ya'akov wasn't going to respond.</p>\n\n<p>According to R' Hirsch, Lavan was trying to get Ya'akov to want to keep working without pay by flattering him. Here's how R' Hirsch expands on Lavan's words in Verse 24:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"I do not like to let you go, no real reason for it, but I have a נחוש about you, have a superstitious idea that \"'ה\", the God Whom you serve, has brought me luck, blessed me because you are such a pious man. That is why I do not like to let such a pious man go away from me\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Ya'akov apparently met this appeal with silence, as the next verse has Lavan talking again, introduced with a new \"and he said.\" So, Lavan felt compelled to bring up the subject of wages.</p>\n\n<p>So, perhaps we break the Torah reading here to add emphasis to Lavan's expectant pause and Ya'akov's silence in the face of Lavan's false piety.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If there was a paragraph break in the scroll, I'd have a bigger problem, but there isn't.</p>\n\n<p>I presume it's due to the rule of the Yerushalmi Megillah (Perek Benei HaIr 7) quoted in OC 139:1, \"This fellow who gets up to read from the Torah needs to begin [his portion] with a good thing & seal it with a good thing.\" Lavan's acknowledgement that Yaakov has brought him blessing is a \"good thing\" with which the previous <em>oleh</em> can finish, and Lavan's offer of better wages is a \"good thing\" with which the next <em>oleh</em> may begin.  </p>\n\n<p>So why not stop after Yosef's birth as a \"good thing\"? Perhaps Rachel's dissatisfaction (Yosef = \"G-d should add another son to me!\") or Yaakov's restlessness (\"please send me back to my place...\").</p>\n\n<p>Why not stop at the end of the Chapter? Perhaps starting the next reading with Lavan's sons grumbling that \"Yaakov has taken all that is our father's!\" is not a \"good thing\".</p>\n\n\n",

But this is not a rule, the only thing that can be said about the way to use tallit in retirement is the absence of rules and individual freedom. However, as the use as a shawl is more traditional, it is the most used.</p>\n<p>There are some synagogues, such as Temple Emanu-El in New York, in which the rabbis and chazzans wear ceremonial robes with a narrow tallit that actually resemble Protestant or Catholic officiants with priestly stoles, but in the same way as every Jew resembles a Christian bishop wearing skullcaps on the head.</p>\n<p>The use of specific clothing by the chazzan during services in the synagogue is something very traditional in Judaism that has disappeared in the Orthodox world today (with the exception of some Sephardic synagogues in America, England and Holland), but which is still maintained in some Reform synagogues. And the fact that it resembles Christian adornments is due to the simple fact that Christianity is a religion that was born from Judaism and that, naturally, shares some elements.</p>\n<p>These photos below are of Sephardic rabbis from the orthodox shaarei sion congregation, NY, and as you can see, they used tallit in this way.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BOXinwtz.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Rabbi Rephael Elnadav Z'L\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/BOXinwtz.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbi Raphael Elnadav Z'l\" title=\"Rabbi Rephael Elnadav Z'L\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7oJSCRGe.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Rabbi Jacob Kassin Z'L\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/7oJSCRGe.jpg\" alt=\"Rabbi Jacob Kassin Z'l\" title=\"Rabbi Jacob Kassin Z'L\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lGCIUsw9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" title=\"Rabbi Baruch b.

The most likely origin of the Ashkenazi Reform/Conservative way of wearing it as a scarf is the imitation of the Christian <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stole_%28vestment%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Stole</a>. The Reform synagogue, in an effort to assimilate, copied many of the features of Protestant Church. Rabbis would, and still do in many synagogues, wear <a href=\"https://www.faithandleadership.com/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/field/image/geneva-robe_tp_0.jpg?itok=gtFKfRWG\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clerical Robes</a> and fold their tallith to resemble a stole so they could closer resemble a Protestant Minister. Add in a choir, organ, and vernacular services, and superficially, an early reform service would have been hard to differentiate from a German Protestant church service. My best guess for why it became widespread is that congregants would see their rabbis wearing the tallith in such a manner, and copy it.</p>\n\n\n",

Since yarmulkas and talleisim are probably normally beged ish, and pink/purple frilly clothes are generally beged isha, are these garments both beged ish and beged isha, and thus assur for everyone to wear? Similarly, are there other articles of clothing that one might encounter that are both beged ish and beged isha and assur for everyone to wear?</p>\n\n<p>I'm not referring to unisex clothing which is permitted for everyone; rather, I'm referring to clothing which bears conflicting aspects which each explicitly mark it as being for a single gender. That is to say, something like black reading glasses might be allowed for everyone because there is nothing \"masculine\" or \"feminine\" about them, but what about a frilly pink yarmulka which has both \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" aspects?</p>\n\n<p>(I would have liked to dub such clothing <em>beged androginus</em>, but I realized that the mishnah in bikurim says that androginusim wear male clothing.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>no b/c that is a contradiction of terms. something which is a man's garment is not a women's garment and something which is a woman's garment is not a man's garment. Your example of a pink yarmulke isn't a contradiction because wearing a certain color isn't necessarily masculine or feminine and a yarmulke and tallis are specifically worn by men. Rashi on the pasuk of lo silbash (Devarim 22,5) says that a woman cannot carry a weapon because it's a man's job to go to warfare. If he carried a pink gun it still would be considered a weapon it's the essence that counts not the color.</p>\n\n<p>There are garments however like a coat which are neutral and not designated specifically for man or woman and therefore can be worn by both, as demonstrated in gemoro nedorim (40b) that rabbi Yehuda bar Iloi shared his coat with his wife and therefore could not go out at the same time.</p>\n\n\n",

Even with such resources (and, no, sorry, I don't know of any), there'll be ambiguity. Should commentaries on <em>Mishne Tora</em> be among the commentaries on <em>shas</em>, since they're studied with <em>g'mara</em>, or should they be with <em>halacha</em> books, since they're commentaries on a <em>halacha</em> book? <em>T'rumas Hadeshen</em>, though written as if it were <em>sh'elos us'shuvos</em>, is usually studied when tracing the history of <em>halacha</em> (unlike modern <em>sh'elos us'shuvos</em> books, which are studied when determining modern <em>halacha</em>), so should it be shelved with <em>halacha</em> books rather than with <em>sh'elos us'shuvos</em> books? Should <em>Sefer Hamitzvos</em> of the <em>Rambam</em> be shelved with his <em>Mishne Tora</em>, which it serves as an introduction to, or with <em>Chinuch</em>, since both are <em>mone hamitzvos</em>? Should <em>Aruch</em> be with dictionaries or with commentaries on <em>g'mara</em>? Etc., etc., etc. I do not think a categorization scheme exists that allow <em>all</em> your users to find <em>everything</em> in the place they first expect it; if your library is big enough, consider a card catalogue.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I emailed R' Jeremy Meyerowitz, a Public Services Librarian at the <a href=\"http://www.jtsa.edu/library\" rel=\"noreferrer\">JTS Library</a>, and he provided the following information (edited for format and link styling):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would recommend the website of the <a href=\"http://www.jewishlibraries.org\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Association of Jewish Libraries (AJL)</a>.

There is also information on many other areas that concern synagogue libraries, such as policies, fundraising, cataloging, and circulation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is a bit of a side point, but I think it really is a crucial aspect of organizing a useful shul library.</p>\n\n<p>If you want the library to have lasting value, you need to have a system in place for <em>maintaining</em> its order. If there is no such system, then people's use of the library (hopefully robust!) will result in increasing disorder over time, eliminating a great deal of the value of whatever system of organization you started with.</p>\n\n<p>For example, when I was at <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeshivat_Kerem_B%27Yavneh\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh</a>, there was a system called \"toranut sefarim\" (\"book [-ordering] rotation\") wherein one night each week, a small team of students was tasked with sweeping through the Study Hall, collecting all books that belonged on shelves and were sitting out, and carting them to their correct locations on the shelves. (I may have some of the details wrong, but I have the basic idea.) This process was aided by the fact that the books had colored tape on them to visually indicate which section they belonged in. With this system in place to regularly restore order, it was guaranteed that the book collection would never get unmanageably out of order.</p>\n\n<p>So, I recommend establishing some sort of regular order-restoration from the beginning, preferably with the burden spread out over a large base of helpers. The more people involved, the less work each has to do. In the extreme, if one person ends up shouldering the entire burden, there's a strong potential for eventual burn-out or for disorder to set in if that person goes on vacation, moves away, or loses interest. Another benefit of getting many people involved is that anyone who has to help with restoring order is more likely to, as a user, put books back where they belong in the first place, and a culture of people doing that makes the task of the order-restorers even lighter.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, many Lubavitchers avoid and discourage sending unmarried people to university campuses, though I'm not so sure that it's directly caused from Shachter, and I've never heard of a ban.

However, yes, shluchim must be married, or when they are single they never go out somewhere by themselves. Shlichus must not be done alone. Not only this, but a big aspect of the success that shulchim have is be inviting people to their house to give their guests a glimpse of the beauty of a chassidishe family who are happy to keep Mitzvas and be close with the Rebbe and how chassidus permeates everything they do with a refinement not often seen in the secular world. Also another important point to be made is when bocherim go on shluchis they don't go as individuals but they at least as a pair. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# why are there so few great gedolim today\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Given that there are far more people learning torah full time today than the past few centuries, why are there so few Gedolim coming out of the yeshivot compared to previous generations? (By \"Gedolim\" I refer to torah scholars who know the shas and poskim in depth and have it at their fingertips. Many of them also had ruach hakodesh and powers to \"change things\" with their berachas, as can be seen for example from reading artscroll biographies of them or from numerous first hand accounts of people involved.)</p>\n\n<p>I once heard from Rabbi Nachman Bulman zt'l \"when I was a boy in NYC, in every shietble you went to there were baal batim that were great lamdanim in kol shas kulo\" (i.e. great talmudic scholars everywhere). What is going on here?</p>\n\n<p>Please provide a source and no lashon hara.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>You ask two questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Learned Baalei Battim - I think we have many more now than we used to. Volozhin (one of the largest Yeshivas in Europe had ... <a href=\"http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/volozhin/vol112.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>400</em></a> students. Many of those were the Rabbonim. Who were the Baalei Battim? Some had time to learn, some were unable to read. Artscroll, Yeshiva trained Baalei Battim (all those post-high-school yeshivas)? Few to not existent. No one could afford to go. Now you see programs like Dirshu or Mifal HaShas who have hundreds of people who know (or at least learned through <strong>and got tested</strong> on) Shas.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rabbonim - Due to the above, a lot of current Yeshiva graduates aren't what they used to be, which is fine. All that happened was that Mir grew from being under a hundred students to close to <em>8,000 students</em>. Most of those aren't the cream of the crop, simply because we can afford to send every guy to Yeshiva. If Mir+Lakewood+Chevron+(All of Tomchei Tmimims around the word) would shrink to around 1000 of the best students, they would probably be the same geniuses who are Boki BeShas.</p>\n<p>Another possibility is that nowadays many (in America) go through dual-track High schools. Unlike the Yeshiva of Europe (where all those who learned Limmudei Chol did it under the table or at least outside of class), one frequently has around 5 hours of Limudei Kodesh a day (and summer vacations, etc.) They only start learning seriously by Zal age (18 or so), and then they learn Iyun. As a result, by 25 (that's Post high school Yisraeli yeshiva -> \"Big American Yeshiva\"),  they only had some 7 years of serious learning (without much of a chance to learn Girsa/BeKiyus). If then they enter the \"Smicha\" track, they spend the next few years learning Yoreh Deah (with Gemara BeIyun in the morning). Now you have a guy who spent 10-12 years of serious learning who never learned through Maseches Shabbos.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>saw this over shabbat from a parsha sheet.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the Nefesh Shimshon writes: The key to success is constant [thrust].\n  When they first wanted to build a spaceship to fly to outer space,\n  they calculated how much fuel was needed. But due to the great\n  distances, the amount of fuel needed seemed enormous, way beyond the\n  capacity of any spaceship to possibly carry. However, afterwards they\n  realized that the difficulty is only in the first stage - when the\n  spaceship is still close to the earth's atmosphere, where the force of\n  gravity still binds it to the earth. But when it breaks out\n  sufficiently far from the pull of gravity, it will be able to continue\n  towards the moon. Until the heavens! This patent exists also in\n  Judaism. A person desires to reach the Ribono shel Olam (G-d), and\n  people jump and jump, 80 years they jump, but they remain on the\n  ground. They do not succeed in soaring. Why? Because \"to learn one\n  hour and stop, one hour and stop upholds nothing\" (Chazon Ish). Hence\n  they jump and jump but remain in the same place. The advice is to make\n  a powerful leap, to apply oneself to his learning with all of his\n  might. Until when? Until he feels that he is freeing himself from the\n  pull of gravity. The pull which draws one towards the childish, the\n  foolishness and vanities. True, the first effort is extremely\n  difficult. But the foundation is to break out of the force of gravity,\n  the pull towards life attached to the earth, because all the time one\n  remains on the ground, it is impossible to soar. One learns and\n  learns, but in effect he paces around the same place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>maybe this answers it, in that perhaps today people dont have enough mental strength to apply themselves far beyond the \"comfort zone\" for much time.</p>\n\n\n",

As it is written: “Blow a shofar at the New Moon, at the covered time for our Festival day” (Psalms 81:4). Which is the Festival day\non which the moon is covered, i.e., hidden? You must say that this is Rosh HaShana, which is the only Festival that occurs at the beginning of a month, when the moon cannot be seen.

(Not yet seen it officially in a source). I know people who have the custom to have them on erev Yom Kippur, Hoshanah Rabba and Purim. I imagine possibly with the first two instances; it may well lie with the fact that we are all undergoing an intense judgement period that only G-d knows the outcome of. Yom Kippur being the day in which our judgement is sealed and Hoshanah Rabbah when it is \"posted\" and thus there are those who eat Kreplach as nod to this concealed and hidden nature of the day.

This is a principle that appears several times in the Gemara.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in Kritot 19a, there is an argument between R. Eliezer and Yehoshua about a person's liability in various transgressions. The Gemara teaches that R. Eliezer always finds the person accountable, where as R. Yehoshua responds:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר לו רבי יהושע: הרי הוא אומר אשר חטא בה, עד שיודע לו במה חטא. ורבי אליעזר האי בה מאי עביד ליה? מיבעי ליה: פרט למתעסק.</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Yehoshua replied: It says \"Wherein he has sinned\" [as previously discussed, the word wherein - <em>asher</em> -  from Lev. 4:23 alludes to the intention of an action]. <strong>It must be known to him wherein he sinned.</strong> And for what does R. Eliezer employ the word \"wherein\"? - To exclude unpurposed action. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Gemara continues discussing the possible exceptions to this rule, where a person acting without knowledge of the sin is still liable because one receives pleasure from the sin (i.e., eating helev, committing incest). There is also a discussion about whether violating Shabbat would also be an exception of holding one liable, even if done unintentionally. </p>\n\n<p>So the answer depends on what exactly this old man did (he must be in pretty good shape if he passes Moshe Rabbeinu's age!). If the sin didn't involve an enjoyment of bodily pleasure and it didn't involve violating Shabbat, then it appears that he will not be held liable for what he did. </p>\n\n\n",

Therefore for shacharit you should say all aloud with the chazzan and not say amens, including for kedushah, but for Mincha you should say amen to exclude yourself and then repeat from the beginning of the avot blessing.</p>\n\n\n",

[<em>insert name of activity here</em>].</p>\n\n<p>This is all well and good when the activity can either be found explicitly in the Torah (eg: blowing a shofar) or can be inferred from the Torah (eg: waving the four species), but what about those things for which there is nothing in the Torah at all?</p>\n\n<p>By way of an example, washing one's hands before eating bread, or lighting candles on erev Shabbat. Both of these are <em>rabbinic</em> enactments; they have no basis whatsoever within the actual written Torah. I know that it is necessary to make the above blessing when performing them (\"Blessed are <em>you</em>, O God, etc, who commanded us concerning the washing of the hands, etc\") - my question is <em>why</em>? It was not God, strictly speaking, who \"commanded\" us in this regard, but the rabbonim.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge, we do not make this blessing when writing a prozbul, yet that is no less rabbinic in nature.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>1) See <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%9B%D7%92_%D7%90\">Shabbat 23a</a>, which discusses Menorah on Chanukah:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מברך אשר קדשנו במצותיו וצונו להדליק נר של חנוכה והיכן צונו רב אויא\n  אמר  מ<a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%99%D7%90\">לא תסור</a> רב נחמיה אמר <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%99%D7%96_%D7%99%D7%90\">שאל אביך ויגדך זקניך ויאמרו לך</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_23.html\">Soncino translation</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>What benediction is uttered? — This: Who sanctified us by His\n  commandments and commanded us to kindle the light of Hanukkah.

R.\n  Nehemiah quoted: Ask thy father, and he will shew thee; Thine elders,\n  and they will tell thee.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>2) I don't think the prozbul is technically a mitzvah- it's a תקנה- a rabbinic decree designed to improve the general welfare of society. (Also note that according to the Rambam (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/7709.htm\">שמיטה ויובל ט:טו</a>), the prozbul is only effective when the Sabbatical year is only observed on the rabbinic level. When the Sabbatical year returns to a biblical obligation, the prozbul enactment will be void.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Maharal, in <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/vl/bhg/bhg1.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">באר הגולה באר ראשו</a>ן, explains the idea of Rabbinical mitzvos.  He is addressing why these mitzvos do not \"split\" the Torah from its singular unity, and at the end he adds that it is also the reason we make the blessing:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Rabbinical mitzvos are all designed to straighten a person out to do all the actions he should be doing and avoid all the actions he shouldn't be doing.  In this way, the Rabbinical mitzvos are in line with the Torah, and not an unrelated addition.</p></li>\n<li><p>Hashem set up the world such that there are things which are directly from Hashem, and there are things which come about through \"nature.\" Nonetheless, those which are physical and come about through \"natural\" causes are no less arranged by Hashem.  So too, the Rabbinical mitzvos are not \"Divine intellect\" and are not \"directly\" from Hashem, but the system which produced them was arranged by Hashem (through the commandments of לא תסור and שאל אביך ויגדך), and therefore can be accurately described as coming from Hashem.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This applies to the mitzvos of the Rabbis, which were decreed in order to perfect a person (Maharal's words - ועל ידי שניהם התורה היא שלימות האדם).  Something which is for utilitarian purposes, such as the writing of a prozbol, would not be included.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is Jewish theology Panentheistic by definition?",
    "content": "# Is Jewish theology Panentheistic by definition?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Is the Jewish view that everything in creation is a hidden manifestation of God, i.e. that God is enclothed so to speak, in every element of creation, similar to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panentheism\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Panentheism</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Or is God \"outside\" of His creations, so to speak, guiding them from His \"place\".</p>\n\n<p>Or perhaps a third possibility?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It depends on how you define Panentheism. You can take the word at face value, and then put anything into it that can fit that definition. That is what Wikipedia does, and it strikes me as very suspect. Certainly <a href=\"http://atheism.about.com/library/FAQs/religion/blrel_theism_panen.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the inventor of the word</a> didn't mean it that way - he meant to strike out a different religious philosophy different from Pantheism.</p>\n<p>If you take the word at face value, it <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/panentheism/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">means</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pan - all</li>\n<li>En - in</li>\n<li>Theism - G-d.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is distinct from Pantheism where All is G-d - in other words G-d is the sum of the universe and nothing else, which is more reminiscent of those that worship the dust of their feet that <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=4&showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi speaks about</a>.</p>\n<p>That idea of Panentheism (that it means what the word roots say) maps with the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33196/does-judaism-believe-in-a-form-of-panentheism#comment84056_33196\">Medrash</a> that Yahu explores <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/876/hashem-is-here-and-there-and-everywhere/1153#1153\">here</a>, using that expanded definition (as defined by Wikipedia).</p>\n<p>However, that isn't what Panentheism really means. Panentheism, as Miriam-Webster so succinctly <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/panentheism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">defines</a> means:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the doctrine that God includes the world as a part though not the whole of his being</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That violates many doctrines of Judaism, including non-corporeality, G-d's Oneness, creation ex-nilo, etc.</p>\n<p>However, to discuss the larger Wikipedia definition of Panentheism in a Jewish context, you could say that everyone that says <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/709/what-is-the-machlokes-between-the-gra-and-baal-hatanya/8816#8816\">the Tzimtzum is not literal</a> (which emphatically includes the Ba'al HaTanya, but others as well - in fact some deny the Gr\"a ever held differently, so they clearly don't hold that way, whatever the Gr\"a held), which means that G-d <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendence_%28religion%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">transcends</a> the world, and there is no place in the world where He is not present.</p>\n<p>If you want to call that Panentheism, I guess you can, but it really bears no relationship to the philosophical/religious ideas that actively identify themselves with the word. Those ideas, from what I read (and see the links in this post) seem to all be about how the world is part of G-d, G-d is changed by the creation of the world, so in some way (apparently much like the Rambam describes the evolution of Avodah Zarah, each one comes along with a new twist) the world is part of an interactive system within G-d.</p>\n<p>In the Tanya, the whole <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7993/jewish/Chapter-7.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">argument</a> that G-d transcends the world is that G-d is unchanging and unchanged:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועל כרחך אין ידיעתו אותם מוסיפה בו ריבוי וחידוש, מפני שיודע הכל בידיעת עצמו</p>\n<p>and perforce His knowledge of them does not add plurality and innovation to Him, for He knows all by knowing Himself.</p>\n<p>Were G‑d’s knowledge of created beings not to come from knowing Himself then it would be correct to say that this knowledge adds plurality and innovation to Him; previously He did not know them and now he does. However, since plurality and innovation cannot possibly apply to G‑d, He must perforce know them through His knowledge of Himself.</p>\n<p>הרי כביכול מהותו ועצמותו ודעתו הכל אחד</p>\n<p>Thus, as it were, His Essence and Being and His Knowledge of created beings are all one.</p>\n<p>Since G‑d’s knowledge and Providence extend to this world, and since His knowledge is one with Him, it follows that G‑d Himself is to be found within this physical world. Unlike the king who sits in his palace and gazes beyond its walls, the King Himself is to be found wherever His Providence and knowledge are found.</p>\n<p>True enough, it is only through divine service that this world may be transformed into a place in which G‑d is revealed. Nonetheless, G‑d is present in this lowly corporeal world, which feels itself to exist independently of Him, to the same degree as He is present within the higher spiritual worlds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The third principle of Jewish Faith as codified by the <em>Ramba\"m</em> states explicitly that the Creator \"has no physical body and is not a force which resides within a physical body\"\n(אינו גוף ולא כח בגוף). This statement precludes the basic tenet of Panentheism, i.e. that God resides actually within everything that exists.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the <em>Rasa\"g</em> (<em>Rav Sa'adya Gaon</em>) in his well-known work <em>Emunoth Wa-Dhe`oth</em> discusses ideas of how God created the universe as postulated by the various religions and philosophical schools. One of the twelve theories of creation discussed is Emanationism (i.e. the idea that God emanated his own essence into the lower forms of the creation). </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>The third theory is that of him that asserts that the Creator of physical bodies has created them out of His own essence...</em> (<em>Ma'amar Rishon</em>, III)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>He then goes on to refute this theory with 13 refutations. Emanationism requires a belief in Panentheism.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism has always championed the belief in <em>creatio ex nihilo</em> (Creation from nothing) by a completely transcendent and non-physical God whom is completely removed from His creation.</p>\n\n<p>Panentheism, although championed by many as the true view of the Torah, is certainly a mistake and an aberration.</p>\n\n<p>There is much more which could be said on this subject, but this should be sufficient to answer your basic question.</p>\n\n<p><em>Kol tuv</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The way it was explained to me by R' Moshe Zeldman at Yeshivat Aish HaTorah is that the Creation is <em>akin</em> to a dream in HaShem's \"mind\". (No, HaShem does not have a physical mind and no He does not dream in a physical sense). As long as HaShem \"dreams\" (i.e. \"desires\") the Creation to exist it does. IIRC He made this statement in the name of HaRaMHa\"L.</p>\n\n<p>The crude analogy R' Zeldman gave us was to close our eyes and imagine a field with a boy in it. He then asked us if that boy continues to exist when we stop thinking about him (obviously not).</p>\n\n<p>So too, R' Zeldman explained, HaShem is constantly \"propping up\" the Creation by desiring for it to continue. The crude analogy he gave was of holding up a cup. As long as a person holds up a cup, it stays elevated. As soon as the person lets go of the cup, the cup falls to the ground (obviously assuming gravity is at play).</p>\n\n<p>Taking these ideas and crude analogies together, R' Zeldman explained that HaShem's Will comprises all of Creation (much like every blade of grass in the field/boy example above is \"composed\" of the dreamer's thoughts). Granted this leaves entirely unanswered the question of Free Will.</p>\n\n<p>Seen in this light, one could technically say that all of Creation is \"composed\" of HaShem / HaShem's Will. But, that's obviously a very loose terminology since even in the human example, one would be hard-pressed to say the field/boy (see above) are \"composed\" of the dreamer. How much more so when discussing HaShem's \"essence\".</p>\n\n<p>I hope this helps. It sat well with me.</p>\n\n\n",

This is only permitted, however, if the need cannot be\n  fulfilled in a permissible manner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As such, the same author writes in <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0899066119\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Children in Halacha</a>, p. 110</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a child has a rash or other skin problem that causes him\n  discomfort, the child is considered a <em>choleh she'ein bo sakana</em>.\n  Therefore, one may tell a gentile to do a <em>melacha</em> forbidden by the\n  Torah in order to relieve his discomfort (open hot water or boil up\n  water).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So a child bath for convenience is forbidden on Shabbat and a bath for a child that suffers from a skin issue is equally permitted on both Shabbat and Yom Tov.</p>\n\n<p>The reason the Sulchan Aruch in OC 511 discusses bathing on Yom Tov is that it is permitted to heat up water on Yom Tov for cooking, and once a <em>melacha</em> is permitted for cooking it also becomes permitted for other uses if it is <em>shaveh lekol nefesh</em> (important to most people). This is the case of washing hands, face and feet, but not all of one's body.</p>\n\n<p>In case of children, it is permitted to bathe them when the water has been heated on Yom Tov for a permitted purpose but not to ask a non-Jew to do it for bathing only.

We should also clarify that the children who get the din of <em>choleh she'ein bo sakana</em> are children less than 3 years old in all cases and those between 3 and 9 when they are \"relatively weak\" (<a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9780899068800.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The sanctity of Shabbos</a>, p. 52).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If a hand is 4×4, why not when rain bounces off of it? (שבת ה ע״א)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=132\" rel=\"nofollow\">The <em>Bavli</em>, <em>Shabas</em> 5, <em>amud</em> 1</a>, indicates that a hand is considered to be a physically large enough location that <em>akira</em> (lifting something from its place to transport the object) and <em>hanacha</em> (resting the transported object upon arrival) can be done on it, even though it's not actually large enough: the usual minimum is four <em>tefach</em> squared.</p>\n\n<p>Later on the same page, we have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א״ר אבין א״ר יוחנן הכניס ידו לתוך חצר חבירו וקיבל מי גשמים והוציא חייב מתקיף לה ר׳ זירא מה לי הטעינו חבירו מה לי הטעינו שמים איהו לא עביד עקירה לא תימא קיבל אלא קלט והא בעינן עקירה מעל גבי מקום ד׳ וליכא</p>\n  \n  <ul>\n  <li>Rabbi <em>Avin</em> said that Rabbi <em>Yochanan</em> said: \"If he brought his hand into his fellow's courtyard, caught rainwater, and took it out [to a public thoroughfare], he's liable.\"</li>\n  <li>Rabbi <em>Zera</em> fumed at that: \"What's the difference whether his fellow loaded him up [where the one whose hand is loaded up is not liable because his fellow did <em>akira</em>] or the sky did? He didn't do <em>akira</em>!\"</li>\n  <li>Rather, say not \"caught\" but \"incorporated\" [that the descending flow hit his one hand and he caught it in the other —<em>Rashi</em>].</li>\n  <li>But [that can't be:] we need <em>akira</em> from a four-<em>tefach</em> surface and don't have it!</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why not? We said a hand is large enough for <em>akira</em> and <em>hanacha</em>, further up the same page. (<em>M'iri</em> mentions this question but doesn't answer it except to say that considering this case <em>akira</em> and <em>hanacha</em> would mean any passage from hand to hand would count as <em>akira</em> and <em>hanacha</em> also, which is impossible. But I don't see why that's impossible. It seems to fit exactly with the passage further up the page.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question of the גמרא is based on the assumption that if something is moving, it is already נעקר, or in a state of עקירה. Therefore, if something fell out of the air into one's hand, even though we have the כלל that ידו של אדם חשובה לו כד׳ על ד, he still has not done the עקירה.</p>\n<p>The source for this can be found on .דף ג, where the גמרא says (depending on the גירסא) that ידו לא נייח, גופו נייח, i.e. your hand is not stationary, therefore we cannot say that when someone put something in your hand while you are outside and your hand is inside, and then you take it out, that you did עקירה והנחה. The other גירסא is ידו בתר גופו גרירא. Most ראשונים explain that the two גירסות mean the same thing, but רש׳׳י does not. There is not enough room here to explain this entire מחלוקת. Be that as it may, the answer to your question is to be found on .דף ג.</p>\n<p>The גמרא then attempts to answer that he plucked it out of the air, which would theoretically answer the עקירה question, but leaves open another problem: you still plucked it out of the air, which does not have ד׳ על ד׳, and therefore should not constitute an עקירה. In order to explain this question we need to look at a גמרא on :דף ז, which says explicitly that one does not need a מקום ד׳ על ד׳ in רשות היחיד to be חייב. The רשב׳׳א answers this סתירה with the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והא דאמרינן גבי הכניס ידו לחצר חבירו וקלט מי גשמים והא בעינן עקירה מעל גבי מקום ארבעה, לאו דוקא מקום ארבעה אלא הכי קאמר והא בעינן עקירה מעל גבי מקום וליכא, ותדע לך דהתם לאו משום שיעור מקום אתינן אלא משום דבעינן מקום לאפוקי קולט</p>\n<p>...[after explaining that we don't really need ד׳ על ד׳ in רשות היחיד, he says] And that which we said in the case which he stuck his hand into his fellow's yard and pulled rainwater out of the air, and the גמרא asks ''but do we not need an area four by four?'' it does not mean literally an area four by four, but the following: we need עקירה from an area and we don't have it [i.e. pulling rainwater out of the air is like pulling it out of nowhere, and you need a ''where'' to do עקירה from.-moses]. Know that this is true, because we come not from the size, but from an ''area'', as opposed to ''grabbing'' [his proof is from the fact that you don't actually need to mention the size of the area to disprove the attempted answer that you grabbed it out of the air, you only need to mention that the air is not actually a place. it must be that the mention of the size of the area is not meant literally.-moses]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer lies in Tosafos \"Mai Taama Yado Lo Naich.\" There is a big difference between putting it into a hand that belongs to someone in the same domain and a hand whose host is in another domain. In the former, putting it on the hand is a complete landing in that domain, and it is as if it is on the ground. But in the latter, the hand is on its own and therefore it was placed in the air. </p>\n\n<p>What Rava says in Daf 5, that a person's hand is as substantial as a four by four, is to satisfy the other requirement — of a Makom Chashuv. But whether or not it was at all placed in a final spot depends on the above criteria.</p>\n\n\n",

That leaves 98 lbs. of flour. I tithe the remaining flour (9.8 lbs); that's called <em>Maaser Rishon</em>, and it's given to the Levites. (Rambam laws of Maaser 1:1). The Levite then tithes what <em>he</em> gets, i.e. 0.98 lbs of flour, and gives that to the Kohen. (That's what you're seeing in BaMidbar 18:26.)</p>\n\n<p>Of my remaining 88.2 lbs of flour, I'm supposed to tithe it once more (~8.8 lbs of flour). This second tithing is called, logically, <em>Ma'aser Sheni.</em> Usually I'm supposed to take it to Jerusalem and eat it myself. (Rambam laws of Maaser Sheni 1:1). <em>However</em>, Devarim 14:28 is saying that every three years, it instead belongs \"in my local cities\" (i.e. not Jerusalem); and 14:29 continues that it belongs to \"the foreigner, the orphan, the widow\" -- i.e. the poor. Thus, some years I give my Maaser Sheni to the local poor, and other years I take it to Jerusalem and eat it.</p>\n\n<p>That brings us to Devarim 12:17-18, which is telling the people that G-d would pick a centralized location for sacrifices in the future (this turned out to be Jerusalem), and they have to respect that. (In fact, several times in Jewish history people sadly attempted to make a pseudo-Jerusalem elsewhere.) It's saying that anything that is supposed to be eaten in Jerusalem must be eaten in Jerusalem, and you're in trouble if you eat it elsewhere:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>You many not eat in your local cities [i.e. not-Jerusalem] your firstborn animals, your tithes, or the sacrifices you've pledged.

    "content": "# Was chicken originally considered pareve? If so, when and why was this changed?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I heard that chicken was originally considered pareve in the Bible, because it is a type of fowl (i.e. like fish it is pareve, as it is not 'meat'), and that only later was it changed to be meat because it was too confusing. When did it change to be considered meat? Which rabbi wrote a responsum or takkana making this change, and what was the legal reasoning?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>Babylonian Talmud, Hullin, 116a:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוף איכא בינייהו ר' עקיבא סבר חיה ועוף אינן מן התורה הא מדרבנן אסירי ור' יוסי הגלילי סבר עוף אפילו מדרבנן נמי לא אסיר תניא נמי הכי במקומו של רבי אליעזר היו כורתין עצים לעשות פחמין לעשות ברזל במקומו של רבי יוסי הגלילי היו אוכלין בשר עוף בחלב לוי איקלע לבי יוסף רישבא אייתו לקמיה רישא דטיוסא בחלבא ולא אמר להו ולא מידי כי אתא לקמיה דרבי אמר ליה אמאי לא תשמתינהו אמר ליה אתריה דרבי יהודה בן בתירא הוא ואמינא דרש להו כרבי יוסי הגלילי דאמר יצא עוף שאין לו חלב אם</p>\n<p>Poultry [in milk] is the subject of dispute. Rabbi Akiva opines that it is prohibited rabbinically, but Rabbi Jose of Galilee opines that poultry isn't even rabbinically prohibited. A <em>Braisa</em> [compiled around the year 200] says this as well: \"In Rabbi Eliezer's town, they would ... [follow his opinion that if a circumcision should be done on Shabbat, you can do any necessary precursors on Shabbat too -- e.g. forge a scalpel]. In Rabbi Jose of Galilee's town, they would eat poultry [cooked] in milk.\" Levi came to the town of Rabbi Yosef Rishba, where they served poultry head cooked in milk, he said nothing. When [Levi] returned to [his mentor], Rabbi Judah the Prince, he said -- \"why don't you excommunicate them?!\" \"That is the town of Rabbi Judah ben Beteira\", he replied, \"who follows Rabbi Jose the Galilean's opinion, that poultry is not prohibited.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Talmud is quoting a dispute between Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Jose of Galilee whether chicken-in-milk is rabbinically prohibited. Both those sages lived in the early 100s. The next story, of Levi and Rabbi Judah the Prince, occurs around the year 200. Clearly by that point the majority practice has become that it's prohibited, but a few towns still follow the minority practice. By the time the Babylonian Talmud is complete in the year 500 or so, the minority practice lives only in the books.</p>\n<p>As to the reasoning: some of it may be \"we're afraid you'll mistake poultry for beef\", but Maimonides actually explains it somewhat differently. \"It's easier to tell people <em>no milk and meat together, ever</em>; if you get into the minutiae of what kind of meat, people will start playing games and figuring it only means an animal's meat in its actual mother's milk, which our oral tradition says is false.\"</p>\n<p>As to \"which rabbi wrote a responsum\", let me backtrack for a moment here to clear this up. Since the Talmud was completed around the year 500, rabbis have not had the power to create new laws out of the blue of the form \"don't do X because you may do Y.\" They may, however, make rules deemed good for the wellbeing of the local Jewish population, e.g. \"in our town people are impoverishing themselves with wedding expenses, so we hereby decree that no one may spend more than X on a wedding in this city.\" (We have lots of these in the history books.) Or a more famous example: \"we, the rabbinic leadership of France and Germany, have determined that polygamy is causing familial strife as well as giving the Jewish community a black eye, so we ban it.\" The role of a responsum is to determine which Talmudic laws, or occasionally later social enactments, apply to the situation at hand.</p>\n<p>Note that the rabbis in the 200s still had a formal <em>Sanhedrin</em> that could actually create new laws, we don't anymore. Minority opinions were recorded in the Talmud out of respect, but the ruling followed the majority. So to answer your question -- a majority of rabbis around the year 100 felt it was rabbinically prohibited, and it's likely that prohibition -- like most rabbinic prohibitions -- had arisen over the century or two before that. (There's another opinion in the 100s that it's <em>biblically</em> prohibited, which means clearly some hadn't been doing it at that point!)</p>\n\n\n",

One of the major issues in studying Tanach is trying to understand things from the POV of the writers and their original audience (we, later readers, are a secondary audience). In other words, since the writers (typically prophets) lived in a certain time period and were directing their words at certain people, there were naturally things left unsaid, or at least, not clearly emphasized, because all of these people already knew all of these things. There are things that were accepted as social conventions, and therefore there was no need to state them.</p>\n<p>For example, there is a thesis in Hebrew that I have read part of, called \"Reconstruction of the Chronicle Used by the Author of the Book of Kings in Light of the Mesopotamian Chronicles\", by Dr. Yosi Baruchi. The thesis attempts to reconstruct some of the bibliography that the author of Sefer Melachim may have based himself on. Post-reconstruction of the sources, Dr. Baruchi attempted to reconstruct the chronology of the list of kings. As he himself stated, the differences between the MT (Masoretic Text) and the LXX point to (somewhat) bad attempts by the LXX translator(s) to correct the perceived chronological issues in the book (p. 151 and n. 1). However, in order to properly understand the MT's chronology, there are a few assumptions that must be accepted:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The years of the kings, both of Yisrael and of Yehudah were not counted from the start of the reign but from Rosh Hashanah [La'melachim] (the New Year [of the Kings])<sup>1</sup>.</li>\n<li>Rosh Hashanah in the two kingdoms was not at the same time: For the kings of Yehudah it was in the spring while for the kings of Yisrael it was in the fall.</li>\n<li>Another key difference between the two kingdoms: The time that passed between the crowning of a king of Yehudah until the first Rosh Hashanah was counted as part of the reign of the <em>previous king</em>, while in the kingdom of Yisrael it was counted as part of the reign of the <em>new king</em>. (pp. 151-152 and related notes)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are rules that have been concluded from analyzing the lists in their entirety, as well as perhaps other portions of this book (consider, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Kings.12.32-33?ven=Tanakh:_The_Holy_Scriptures,_published_by_JPS&vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim 1:12:32-33</a> which shows that Yerov'am changed the calendar of the kingdom of Yisrael).</p>\n<p>Even if these rules are incorrect or not entirely correct, I believe they give us the understanding that there <em>were</em> rules, and very likely there were different rules in each kingdom, and whoever lived at the time likely knew these rules and did not need to have them included in the book. We find, therefore, that behind the term \"מָלַךְ\" were all of these different factors that defined the length of the reign, but since it was <em>obvious</em> that were differences between reigns depending on various factors, there was no need to write anything other than \"מָלַךְ\".</p>\n<p>I hope that clarifies things.</p>\n<p>As a side-note, I found today in the library an edition of פירוש רבנו מיוחס ב\"ר אליהו on Chronicles and there he states (at least once; I haven't gone through the entire commentary yet, short as it may be) on Chronicles 2:16:1 (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"שלשים ושש למלכות אסא. אי אפשר לומר כן שהרי בעשא מת בשנת עשרים ושש לאסא כמו שמפורש במלכים <strong>ולא נכתב אלא לדורשה</strong>. וכן דרשו רבותינו כנגד שלושים ושש שנה שנתחתן שלמה לבת פרעה כנגדן נגזרה גזירה על מלכות בית דוד לבטל ועוד תחזור להם וכנגדן שלשים ושש שנה שנגזרה על מלכות ארם שתמשול בישראל ועוד תפול ביד בית דוד.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, in his view, whenever there is a chronological discrepancy, that means that the number was not intended to be understood simply but as something symbolic. Perhaps other commentators state this as well. I have yet to check.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> He only refers to it as Rosh Hashanah, but I added \"La'melachim\" to differentiate between it and the \"regular\" Rosh Hashanah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If necessary I would respond to all issues about the Kings' chronology.

    "content": "# How do we define the word 'עולם'?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the standard beracha 'formula' we use the phrase 'מלך העולם'. But what does the word עולם refer to in this context: Earth/world or universe? It may seem obvious that מלך העולם is referring to Hashem being King over everything i.e. the universe. The Midrash <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/midrashraba/breshit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishit Rabbah</a> speaks of עולמות preceding 'our' one that were destroyed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>א\"ר אבהו מכאן שהקדוש ברוך הוא היה בורא עולמות ומחריבן בורא עולמות ומחריבן עד שברא את אלו אמר דין הניין לי יתהון לא הניין לי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, some understand the 'preceding worlds' as linked to extinct animals and it seems (in that context) to mean Earth/world rather than universe. For instance the Netziv in HaEmek Davar (Genesis 7:23):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The diggers of the earth find the bones of creatures that do not exist in the world today. from this, many have determined that there was another world before this creation where there were other creatures; and in truth there is such an explanation in Bereishit Rabbah... to my mind it is difficult to say this, for it is explained in Shemot Rabbah (1:2)... that He created worlds and looked at them, and they were not endearing to Him, and He returned them to chaos and emptiness. And if so, no vestige or trace remained from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Tiferet Yisrael in Derush Ohr HaChaim (translation by Aryeh Kaplan \"<a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=aryeh%20kaplan%20immortality%20resurrection%20and%20the%20age%20of%20the%20universe%20a%20kabbalistic%20view&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e8eCUtX4MoSqhAfa74CQDQ&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">Immortality, Ressurection and the Age of the Universe</a>\"):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>From all this, we can see that all that the Kabbalists have told us\n  for so many years about the repeated destruction and renewal of the\n  earth has found clear confirmation in our time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Is there a universal way of understanding the word עולם in these contexts?</p>\n\n<p>(Incidentally... the word 'עולם' occurs around 60 times in Torah (after quickly scouring <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/t/t0.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechon Mamre</a>). The term 'חוק עולם' occupies most of the usage of this word. In the Mechon Mamre translation it is consistently translated as pertaining to time e.g. 'everlasting', 'eternal', etc (as do other translations). It is interesting that the use of this word in the Torah is primarily (and perhaps solely) used to describe eternity in terms of time).</p>\n\n\n",

Rather by hitting the child, thus doing something that has a foreseeable consequence of motivating him to do an aveira, he violates Lifnei Iver. This seems to me to be directly analogous to a woman dressing untznius to be noticed. To clarify, I am speaking here about the fact that the untznius draws attention, so that would mean that not all levels of untznius draw attention (or cause hirrur) (e.g. a married woman with uncovered hair being the classic example), so that would limit the statement of when it is lifnei iver.

It is forbidden to take a case to a secular court of law, which will judge the case based on secular law. The Shulchan Aruch does not address the question of being a judge, which was presumably not relevant in his times, but if it is forbidden to take a case to a secular court, it stands to reason that it is likewise forbidden to judge a case based on secular law, and doing so appears to involve two problems.</p>\n\n<p>One problem is that one gives legitimacy to the secular law, which is distinct from Torah Law, as if to state that their law is superior to ours. The second problem is that for civil cases this can involve gezel, “theft” from one party to the other.</p>\n\n<p>However, outside Israel, where the vast majority of people who use the courts are not Jewish, the secular court is of course a perfectly legitimate institution, and involves a mitzvah (for non-Jews). It appears that there is no problem here to be part of the court, for as noted it involves a mitzvah for non-Jews, and for a Jew to be part of a non-Jewish mitzvah is also fine. There is no declaration that non-Jewish laws are superior, because in a non-Jewish court there is of course no expectation that the rulings will be based on Jewish law. There is also no issue of gezel, because litigants are non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>A problem can arise when both litigants are Jewish, and one has to rule in favor of one based on non-Jewish law. Because this case is the exception and not the rule, it appears that this will not prohibit the job. There is no “lifnei iver,” because another judge will issue the same ruling based on secular law, and the problem of mesaye’a can also be overcome (see our article on the topic for more details).</p>\n\n<p>In Israel, the problem seems more severe, because a Jewish court (in a Jewish state, for a majority of Jewish people) should be issuing rulings based on Torah law, and to be part of a system that declares the superiority of an alternative legal system will appear prohibited. The gezel issue also comes to the fore in Israel, where litigants are Jewish (though as noted, this might be resolvable on a formal level).</p>\n\n<p>However, there might be broader issues in Israel (such as making the system more orientated towards Torah law, and issuing rulings that come closer to Torah law), and these considerations (among others) might have been applied concerning a number of observant Jews who were judges in Israel (Justice Kister is said to have received permission from the Chazon Ish to serve on the Israeli secular court; I do not know if this is true).</p>\n\n<p>It is worth adding that there is a fundamental distinction between civil and criminal law. In criminal law Torah law will agree that there is a need for making criminal laws in order to ensure the safety of citizens, and administering this law will also be permitted. Although the law of evidence is different, this will not constitute a problem, because for purposes of takanas ha-medinah we can follow alternative laws of evidence, as the Ran (Derush 11) and the Rashba (Vol. 3 no. 393) explain. In civil law, however, the matter is more problematic.</p>\n\n<p>A person considering entering the profession, certainly in Israel, should therefore first consult with his rabbi.</p>\n\n\n",

A few years ago he asked his students how they felt about \"spouse swapping\", and they assumed that if no one was hurt and all were in agreement, what was the problem? Rabbi Lookstein therefore retooled his course to put more stress on the concept of sanctity and things beyond ourselves.</p>\n<p>Sadly, this is not a new phenomenon.

(Kiddushin 2a-2b)</p>\n\n<p>BTW, It is not a coincidence that the talmud uses the term Hekdesh. There are strong parallels between marital relations and temple service.

This is why a woman must first immerse from impurity before she can have relations with her husband, just like the Kohen must be pure before entering the temple. Both carry the same penalty of Karet, and likewise, idolatry is compared to adultery all over the Tanach. Ex. \"..for with their idols they have committed adultery\" (Yechezkel 23:37).

It seems that modern Cheder/day schools almost uniformly follow this kind of system, with characteristics like different teachers per student year, students divided by age groups, centralized curriculum, dictation and memorization focus, written tests and grading and similar characteristics. My observation is that this is true even in schools that do not teach any secular subjects.</p>\n\n<p>Some religious schools branch out into other secular education ideas, such as <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Montessori</a>, etc., again following the lead of the school and class structure of the secular world.  A distinctively Jewish approach (chavrusa, zal, etc.) to learning doesn't seem to emerge until high school age or later.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Talmud seems to describe a different system, focused on single teachers that last with the students for many years, and the <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/910974/jewish/Chapter-Two.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> (who even describes specific parameters of a school day and a school year differently than the current practice) seems to indicate the same thing.</p>\n\n<p>Does anyone discuss this, and how appropriate the current system is vis-a-vis traditional practice and Halacha?</p>\n\n<p>Has anyone tried to establish a school more modeled on how it \"used to be done\" (to however they understand it) before the general Prussian influence and establishment of secular public education?</p>\n\n<p>[That may seem like two questions, but the second one is really to help the first - if someone tries such a thing, they will state their agenda and reasons behind it.]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I don't have any documented sources for this, but as my family has been involved in Chinuch for generations, in Lita, the US, and Eretz Yisrael, I do have an oral tradition of how our system evolved. </p>\n\n<p>Until the enlightenment, most of gentile Europe was fairly unschooled and ignorant. However, with the enlightenment came this idea that the one people that believed in equal opportunity education all along, was somewhat backwards in its approach to educational systems and methodology. </p>\n\n<p>Another historical factor that brought change is the industrial revolution. The new automatic assembly line method for manufacturing affected our collective psyche to the point that we stopped relating to things on terms of what we invest and became increasingly utilitarian. Unfortunately, this transferred to our beliefs about educating our children as well. </p>\n\n<p>The big cities were always the first to incorporate the new ideas because economics demanded larger schools.

    "content": "# How does the kohein gadol's substitute wife work?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The first mishna of Yoma<sup>1</sup> explains that before Yom Kippur, a substitute wife is prepared for the kohein gadol lest his wife die -- because the torah says he makes atonement for himself and \"his house\", and \"his house\" means his wife.  But he has to be married to exactly one woman on that day because it says \"house\", not \"houses\".</p>\n\n<p>The g'mara on 13a-b describes a system of conditional gittim (bills of divorce), but I'm having trouble understanding how this actually works.  Do I understand correctly that he takes an additional wife before Yom Kippur, with gittim written such that he will be married to exactly one woman when he performs the avodah?  If so, does it have to be a different wife each year because of the laws of divorce and kohanim?</p>\n\n<p>Since he could (in an unfortunate turn of events) end up married to the substitute, it seems like everyone involved would want to take as much care with this match as with any other.  Yet, finding a good (and different) shidduch every year seems challenging, perhaps burdensome, especially as each must be a <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0321.htm#13\" rel=\"noreferrer\">betulah</a>.

Finally, it sounds a lot like the <em>gemara</em> a few <em>dapim</em> later (Yoma 18b; see also Yevamot 37b) where a temporary, formal marriage was created for a compelling need, without an extensive preliminary courtship.</p>\n\n\n",

(Sources)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>This very question is dealt with in chapter 43 of the second volume of אלה הם מועדי by Rabbi <a href=\"http://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95_%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%96%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%A8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eliyahu Schlesinger</a> of Gilo, Jerusalem.</p>\n\n<p>He cites <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Zalman_Auerbach\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shlomo Zalman Auerbach</a> who holds that one does recite Al HaNisim in Mincha after lighting the Menorah. (See הליכות שלמה- מועדים,יז:ז)\nHe explains that despite that it's still the 24th of Kislev; it's considered already Chanuka for one who lit. In other words, it's not that it becomes nighttime for him- after all he still is able to light Shabbos candles after the menorah- rather it become the time of הודאה (=acknowledging God for the miracles/victory/salvation of Chanuka) for him and he thus must recite Al HaNisim.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Schlesinger then cites שלמי תודה on the similar question as to whether one recites Al HaNisim in Birchat HaMazon if he lights menorah and eats while it's still daytime. The author of that volume reports that he asked <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Leib_Shteinman\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Aryeh Leib Shteinman</a> and Rabbi <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissim_Karelitz\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Nissim Karelitz</a> and they didn't provide a conclusive answer. (ונשארו בצ\"ע)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Schlesinger cites another source (חוברת מבקשי תורה-חנוכה ג, עמוד עו) that quotes <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Elyashiv\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliashiv</a> who writes that one should not recite Al HaNisim during such a Mincha. The reason is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שההדלקה וימי החנוכה הם שני דברים נפרדים, יש דין וזמן של הדלקת נר\n  חנוכה, ויש דין מתי מתחילים ימי החנוכה לגבי החיוב של להודות ולהלל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"Lighting the menorah and the days of chanuka are separate concepts. There's a law and time regarding lighting the menorah, and there's a law when the day of Chanuka begins in regards to acknowledging and praise.\"</p>\n\n<p>In other words, the obligation to recite Al HaNisim and Halel is separate from the obligation of lighting the menorah. One who is unable for whatever reason to light the menorah would still be obligated to recite Al HaNisim and Halel. There is no concept of adding to the day of Chanuka- as there is for Shabbat. (i.e. one can accept Shabbat early- in the late afternoon after one and a quarter hours before sundown- and it will be Shabbat for him. However, one can't accept Chanuka early.)</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Schlesinger concludes that he finds Rabbi Eliashiv's reasoning more convincing and thus one does not have to recite Al HaNisim in such a situation. He adds that he also asked <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaim_Kanievsky\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky</a> who also agrees to this position.</p>\n\n<p>Note: I have left out the overwhelming majority of the detail and logic of Rabbi Schlesinger's responsum. Please study his volume to get the full picture.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is difficult to prove a negative, but I cannot find evidence that the lighting of the menora “brings in” Chanukah. It does not. (This could be seen to be supported by the need for the lights of the menora to last until 30 minutes after the stars come out on Friday night. (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14166&st=&pgnum=296\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O Ch 679 (1) MB[2]</a>)). Therefore, there would seem to be no reason to say Al HaNisim at Mincha for Erev Shabbos.</p>\n<p>I think your question arises from the custom that for women, the lighting of the <strong>Shabbos</strong> candles does normally bring in Shabbos, (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14171&st=&pgnum=75\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">O Ch 263 (10) MB[42]</a>) whereas for men there is no such custom (although it is better for a man to light with the condition in mind that he is not accepting the Shabbos at that time). FYI, MB[43] points out that a woman should daven mincha before lighting and if she has not done that she cannot daven mincha afterwards. Instead she should daven maariv twice, using the second maariv to make up for the missed mincha.</p>\n<p>Added later:\nI just found <a href=\"http://torah.org/advanced/weekly-halacha/5764/vayeishev.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in Weekly Halacha by Rabbi Doniel Neustadt</a>, the following (references to footnotes in italics):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If possible, one should daven Minchah on Friday before lighting\nChanukah candles.(<em>1</em>) There are two reasons for davening Minchah\nfirst:  1) The afternoon Tamid sacrifice, which corresponds to our\nMinchah service, was always brought before the lighting of the Menorah\nin the Beis ha-Mikdash(<em>2</em>)  2) Davening Minchah after lighting\nChanukah candles appears contradictory, since Minchah \"belongs\" to\nFriday, while the Chanukah candles \"belong\" to Shabbos.(<em>3</em>). But if\nno early minyan is available, then it is better to light first and\ndaven with a minyan afterwards.(<em>4</em>) The oil or candles should be able\nto burn for at least one hour and forty-five minutes.(<em>5</em>) If the oil\nand candles cannot possibly burn that long, one does not fulfill the\nmitzvah even b'diavad, according to some opinions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>FOOTNOTES:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>1</em> Mishnah Berurah 679:2. Many working people, though, are not particular about this practice, since it is difficult to arrange for a minyan on such a short day.</p>\n<p><em>2</em> Sha'arei Teshuvah 679:1, quoting Birkei Yosef.</p>\n<p><em>3</em> Sha'ar ha-Tziyun 679:7, quoting Pri Megadim.</p>\n<p><em>4</em> Birkei Yosef 679:2; Yechaveh Da'as 1:74.</p>\n<p><em>5</em> See Beiur Halachah 672:1. The breakdown [in this case] is as follows: 20 minutes before sunset, 50 minutes till the stars are out, and an additional half hour for the candles to burn at night. Those who wait 72 minutes between sunset and tzeis ha-kochavim should put in oil to last for an additional 22 minutes at least.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Neustadt does not mention saying Al HaNisim in mincha. The contradiction he mentions is that \"Minchah \"belongs\" to Friday, while the Chanukah candles \"belong\" to Shabbos\" and not to do with Al HaNisim.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How similar is orthodoxy practiced today to ancient times?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As an orthodox Ashkanazi Jew, I hear all the time that the way we practice is the same as we've been doing it for thousands of years (albeit with influences by the Ba'al Shem Tov, the mussar movement, a new devotion to gemorah learning, etc) - the way we daven, learning styles and amount of learning, a sometimes overly intellectual and cold perspective, hashgafa, strict adherence and focus on halacha, etc. </p>\n\n<p>However, I read a book called <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1556434448\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magic of the Ordinary</a>, and I'm now wondering how similar our current practices are to ancient Judaism. The book claims ancient Judaism was somewhat aligned with Native American culture/practice (obviously without the avoda zara), and that the term Judeo-Christian values is completely off.</p>\n\n<p>He writes that we had a close relationship with the earth, trees, and nature, and that neviim even utilized bird feathers, incantations, and holy symbols in the dirt to reach HaShem. He also writes that the rabbaim, in the face of witch hunts and the inquisition, decided to make Judaism appear to align more with Catholicism to appease the Church and witch hunters, so the connection with the earth and \"magic\" or mysticism was downplayed heavily.</p>\n\n<p>So, can anyone recommend any sefarim or Torah sources that compare the rites and dogmas of ancient Judaism to modern Orthodox Judaism? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>I would toss the book away. It sounds like pseudo-scholarship. Look at the end of the book and note the relative paucity of footnotes. </p>\n\n<p>Is Winkler credible? While he had some sort of Orthodox education, he also studied with Schater-Shalomi and now declares himself \"non-denominational\". A brief review of his career indicates he aligns himself with various new-age types such as Andrew Weil and Deepak Chopra.  I don't see any academic credentials- where did he study? Where did he get his PhD? Has he published anything in a respected peer-reviewed journal? I searched \"Google Scholar\" and came up with ZERO articles written by him!</p>\n\n<p>This forum is not the place for editorializing, so I have done my best to limit my critique to the above questions. But the bottom line is, that it's not up to me to prove Winkler a fraud- it's up to him to prove his theories with real scholarship- especially when his ideas are extremely radical. </p>\n\n<p>You write that Winkler claims that mysticism was downplayed in the wake of the inquisition and witch hunts. This is a bizarre claim. The most important event in the development of Jewish mysticism was the publication of the Zohar which occurred after the Inquisition had started. Note that Maimonides, the quintessential non-mystic was living far from the influences from Christianity and was completely opposed to all forms of magic and even denied that such powers actually exist. Maimonides did not reject magic due to some artificial pressure. While he may have been influenced by Greek philosophy- as famously claimed by the Vilna Gaon, that was just his skepticism of magical powers. The antipathy against magic, whether effective of not, goes way back to the Talmud and Bible- it's not a reaction that suddenly (or even gradually) popped up in the Medieval period. The fact is that mysticism does have a place in Jewish life, and has not been \"downplayed heavily\".   </p>\n\n<p>In the book, Winkler makes claim after claim and provides no source of proof whatsoever.</p>\n\n<p>Some examples:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The custom of naming children after family members is \"probably\nbecause of... insecurity.. It feels safer to just attach a name that\nhas already been proven by its having worn successfully for so many\ncenturies by so many others.\" (page 65) </li>\n<li>Leaving crumbs for birds on\nShabbat Shira (when the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_the_sea\" rel=\"nofollow\">Az Yashir</a> is read in synagogues) is\nbecause \"of the songs they teach us.\" (page 69) </li>\n<li>Ritual slaughter requires \"spiritual consciousness\". (page 166) </li>\n<li>\"The word <em>kosher</em> in fact means \"prepare\", as in preparing the spirit [of the animal] for release\" (page 166) </li>\n<li>Most of today's kosher meat is probably not \"actually kosher since it's highly unlikely that such mass slaughter can be performed... with little of no discomfort to the creatures...\" (page 168) </li>\n<li>\"Many of the twelve tribes.. carried specific animal\npowers\" (page 171)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These are just a few of the many claims that Winkler presents as facts without any evidence. Until he writes likes a scholar and provides sources, and avoids speculation, I see no reason why anyone should take anything he writes seriously. </p>\n\n<p>I regret that I haven't answered your question as to which books <strong>are</strong> recommendable. But I think it's just as important to avoid wasting time with phony scholarship.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How similar is orthodoxy practiced today to ancient times?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><strong>Very different.</strong>  Judaism nowadays is based on the teachings of the Rabbis (the Mishna and Talmud), and is not practiced as described in Tanach. Why?  Well, many things happened in history that required our religion to change or become irrelevant.  A quick list:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Destruction of the Temple - No more sacrifices</li>\n<li>End of Prophecy - No longer do we have a direct Word of God instructing us</li>\n<li>Exile from Israel - Cannot perform <em>mitzvot</em> relating to the Land</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>As such, the Rabbis made many changes, such as instituting prayer in place of sacrifices, and changing the nature of the <em>Shalosh Regalim</em> from agricultural and national holidays to purely religious holidays (ex. <em>Chag haKatzir</em> => <em>Chag Matan Torah</em>).</p>\n\n<p>In addition, Jews in Biblical times faced the temptation of idolatry, and tended to give in to that temptation.  This idolatrous culture even affected the worship of Judaism: Some ancient Jews believed that God was anthropomorphic, and\\or He had a wife (<em>Asherah</em>), and\\or that He needed to be fed and kept pleased with sacrifices. These ideas and practices are no longer entertained or practiced.</p>\n\n\n",

It couldn't have been just for expressing his opinion, since the Mishnah is full of dissenting minority opinions. Was there something special about the nature of this dispute that warranted this sentence?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<h2>Pshat</h2>\n\n<p>At the simplest level, he was acting in a manner akin to the <em>zaken mamre</em> or \"rebellious elder\" (<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=17#C4103\">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>). As the Gemara in Sanhedrin explains, a member of the <em>Sanhedrin</em> is allowed, and encouraged, to express a dissenting opinion. However, once the Sanhedrin votes and his opinion is determined to be the minority, he <strong>may</strong> still:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Personally follow his minority opinion</li>\n<li>Lecture to the public on the subject and conclude \"so I'd say the sources look like my position is correct, however for practical ruling please consult the majority opinion.\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>He <strong>may not</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Give others practical ruling in according with his minority opinion.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer wasn't excommunicated for saying \"I think the oven is <em>tahor</em>\", he was excommunicated because he couldn't acknowledge that he was outvoted here, and would have insisted on continuing to practically tell anyone who asked him that the oven is <em>tahor</em>. The oven happened to be what brought up the broader question of the halachic process. Keep in mind this was a tumultuous period in Jewish history, with all sorts of splinter groups and a great deal of confusion after the Second Temple was destroyed. Rabbinic Judaism was spared the split that you'd see between, say, Shiite and Sunni Islam, because minority views were acknowledged (and respected) but then for our faith to remain cohesive we picked the majority view and went on from there.</p>\n\n<p>Personally I find this reading strong enough as is. </p>\n\n<h2>Drash</h2>\n\n<p><em>However</em>, Rabbi Yosef Eliyahu Henkin z'l did in fact feel that this \"oven\" discussion was code for something larger, i.e.:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the oven comes apart into pieces, Raban Gamliel felt it's still \"whole\", but Rabbi Eliezer insisted that it's \"broken.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meant:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The Second Judean Commonwealth had come apart in the year 70. Raban Gamliel felt it could easily be reconnected, by taking up arms against the Romans; Rabbi Eliezer felt it had been fundamentally broken, and fighting the Romans was ill-advised.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>His grandson, Rabbi Yehuda Herzl Hekin shlit'a, questions this interpretation as conventional history has Raban Gamliel (and the general majority) accepting Roman rule, with those who would take arms (e.g. Bar Kochba) to be in the minority. Rabbi YH Henkin therefore suggests a slightly different interpretation. He starts by observing Rabbi Eliezer's opinion in <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Mishnah/Seder_Moed/Tractate_Pesachim/Chapter_9/2\">Pesachim 9:2</a>: if you are <em>one step</em> outside the Temple, halacha deems you \"on a distant path.\" We therefore have:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If the oven comes apart into pieces, Raban Gamliel felt it's still \"whole\", but Rabbi Eliezer insisted that it's \"broken.\" </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Meant:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If a Jew messes up and finds himself alienated from the mainstream, Raban Gamliel felt that he is still part of a whole that can be easily reconnected. Rabbi Eliezer says he's been fundamentally broken away. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This works nicely as we follow Raban Gamliel's more forgiving opinion. (Similar to R' Tzadok HaKohen's interpretation of the hagada's response to the wicked son: \"the time for filtering out the Jewish population was the Exodus. But guess what? You <em>were</em> redeemed. So you're a part of us now, whether you identify with it or not.\")</p>\n\n<p>(Rabbi YH Henkin's interpretation, and that of his grandfather, are found on an mp3 of his on yutorah.org)</p>\n\n\n",

I am told by my local grocer that many large distributors of produce coat them with a substance that is mostly beeswax. This is done to make the food more appealing. </p>\n\n<p>I would like to know if there is any halachic problem with eating food coated with beeswax.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Beeswax itself does not pose any inherent <em>kashrus</em> problem. From the <a href=\"http://www.ou.org/shabbat/5766/kosher/kitisa66.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">OU website</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Beeswax is a substance secreted from glands in bees’ abdomen. Bees use this wax to create the honeycombs in which they store honey. Beeswax is used in foods as a coating to fruits to extend their shelf life, to give a shine to round candies such as chocolates, jelly beans and candy corns and as the base for a flavoring, beeswax extract.</p>\n<p>At first glance, it would appear that neither of the Gemara’s two reasons to permit honey would apply to beeswax because beeswax is a secretion of the bee and isn’t honey. However, many contemporary Poskim have ruled that it is permitted, and the primary reason given is that since beeswax is an inedible non-food item, it is viewed as being pirshah (an animal’s waste material) which isn’t subject to the issur of yotzeh min hatamei. This position is supported by many ancillary proofs from earlier Poskim that beeswax is in fact kosher. One of those proofs is <a href=\"http://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x1583\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 321:16</a> who rules that one should use beeswax candles for bedikas chametz rather than animal fat candles, so as to guarantee that no non-kosher fat drips onto one’s dishes. The Magen Avraham implies that drippings from a beeswax candle pose no kashrus concern.</p>\n<p>Thus, it is generally accepted that beeswax is in fact kosher.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-Do-Bee-Don%27t-Bee.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Star-K website</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Used to form the honeycomb in the hive, beeswax is secreted from wax glands located on the underside of the abdomen.  Bees grow from larvae into mature bees in the cells of the honeycomb.  They also store various other products besides honey.</p>\n<p>In its original state, beeswax is used in non-food grade applications since the human body cannot adequately digest this material.  It is commonly used in candles, lipstick, shoe and floor polish, as well as buffing wax for surfboards.  Since it is not a \"ma'achal,\" a food, its status as a yotzei min hatamei (an actual product that is secreted from the bees) does not make it non-kosher (See <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14676&st=&pgnum=31\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Igros Moshe, Y.D. 2:24 – V’gam</a>.

Or perhaps now it would become nullified.</p>\n\n<p>What is the Halacha and what is proof for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>If the fly is still intact and there's no way of locating it e.g the soup had loads of poppy seeds floating around, then Shulchan oruch Yoreh Dea siman 100 would apply: Seif 1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בריה דהיינו כגון נמלה או עוף טמא וגיד הנשה ואבר מן החי וביצה שיש בה אפרוח וכיוצא בהם  אפילו באלף לא בטלה<br />\na whole creature like an ant, or a non kosher bird, or a \"Gid hanasheh,\" or a limb from a live animal, or an egg with a chick inside, even in a mixture a thousand time its size it can not be nullified.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Seif 3: (exactly your question)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>:קדרה של מרק שנפל שם בריה ונאבדה אסור הכל:<br />\nA soup in which a berie (an entire creature which cannot be nullified e.g fly) falls into and gets lost forbids the entire soup.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even If you separate the soup by mistake (by doing so on purpose all the soup would forbidden see SA YD 101) into 1000 bowls in front of you, the soup is remains ossur (forbidden) as long as the fly is intact and you  havn't checked any of the bowls. However every bowl that you check and make sure that there is no fly, is permitted. And the fly doesn't forbid any part of the soup through absorbing issur as it is Nosein taam liphgam. All this is indicated in the Sheilos utshuvos Rashba quoted by Bais Yosef lehalacha in yore dea 101:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תשובות הרשב\"א בסימן ק\"א שאלת קדרה של מרק שנפל בה יתוש ולא נמצא אם פירש מהמרק בכף או בקערה וראה שאינו שם אע\"פ שהמרק שבקדרה אסור שאין ביטול לבריה מה שבכף או בקערה מותר או אסור ואת\"ל מותר נידון בו להתיר את הקדרה עצמה אע\"פ שבלועה מאותו מרק או לא: תשובה ברור הוא שאין הבריה אוסרת בכל מה שהוא מחמת פליטתה אלא מחמת ממשה והוא שתהיה שלימה ושלא נפסדה צורתה הא אם נחתך ממנה אבר או אפילו היא שלימה ונתרסקה ונפסדה צורתה אבד שמה והוי כשאר איסורין ובטלה ומעתה מה שנבדק מן המרק ובידוע שאין בו גוף הבריה כמו שנפל שם מותר ואין כאן משום ספק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the fly disintegrates after falling in the soup where its not a <em>berie</em> (entire creature which cannot be nullified) and is <em>Nosein taam lifgam</em> (gives a foul taste) so is permissible in a mixture of even more than a 60th (S.A,Y.D. 103,1)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל דבר שטעמו פגום אינו אוסר תערובתו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conclusion: when you separate the soup without checking each bowl the fly which is intact is not nullified.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

These are the two commandments that are associated with the blessing \"... Who performed miracles for our ancestors on those days, in this season.\" Given that these two commandments share a goal (though they might each have other goals), I am wondering why they seem to take very different approaches to that goal, each with its own apparent strengths and weaknesses with respect to accomplishing it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Lighting candles is a purely symbolic act that seems to mean nothing to someone who doesn't know the story, while reading the Megila explicitly tells the story.

Thus, Purim and Pesach, which commemorate our rescue for physical annihilation and slavery, need not be shared with non-Jews since they are well cognizant that Jews like any other human beings will fight ferociously for their physical survival.</p>\n<p>On Chanukah, however, the Jews' spiritual survival and not their physical survival was at stake. The message which we wish to convey to non-Jews is that Jews are willing and able to fight for their spiritual survival as well as their physical well-being, and that the Jews returned from the brink of total assimilation and adopted the Torah, and reestablished their unique relationship with G-d.</p>\n<p>The message of Chanukah is more of a sensation to non-Jews than is the message of Purim and Pesach, and thus, the pirsumei nissa conveyed by the Chanukah lights is directed at non-Jews as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The following is based on my limited understanding of a <em>machshavah shiur</em> from <strong>Rav Moshe Shapira</strong> <em>zt”l</em> for <em>parshas Mikeitz</em> 5768. It's part of a <em>devar Torah</em> <a href=\"https://parshaponders.com/chanukah-5779\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I wrote up in 5779</a>.</p>\n<p>Hashem told Moshe: “…I will give you the stone tablets, and the Torah and the Mitzvah…”<sup>1</sup>. The stone tablets contained the Ten Commandments. The Torah is the Torah Scroll which we have today<sup>2</sup>. What does “the Mitzvah” refer to? We are taught that it refers to the explanation of the Torah<sup>3</sup>. How does the word “Mitzvah”<sup>4</sup>, which is usually translated as “commandment”, connote an explanation? What is an explanation? It’s a revelation of the true intent or meaning of something. So too a Mitzvah. Mitzvos reveal the Divine Will that is laden within the Torah<sup>5</sup>. In that sense, a Mitzvah is an explanation of the Torah.</p>\n<p>We are taught<sup>6</sup> that when Malachi, the last prophet, died, Alexander began his conquest<sup>7</sup>. A main difference between the time of the prophets and afterwards is the ability to describe something’s essence. A prophet is able to relate <em>something</em>, whereas the Greeks and those that followed them can only relate <em>about</em> something. The Greeks and the scientists are great at providing descriptions of something, but that they can never discuss its essence. That requires Divine knowledge, of which only the prophets have. Since the story of Chanukah occurred after the cessation of prophecy, we can no longer describe the essence of the miracle that took place. Any public recitation or communal storytelling wouldn’t do the miracle justice.</p>\n<p>However, reciting from the Torah or the <em>Megillah</em> is different, as they were written by prophets. Miracles that are described in those books aren’t just descriptions about the miracle, they convey the essence of the miracle. We are then able to publicize the miracle in the utmost way. So too when we perform a <em>mitzvah</em>. Since a <em>mitzvah</em> is a revelation of the Divine Will, it’s an explanation of the Torah, by lighting the menorah we <em>are</em> publicizing the miracle<sup>8</sup>. We aren’t simply describing it, we are revealing its essence<sup>9</sup>.</p>\n<p>I admit this doesn't address why we read the <em>Megillah</em> in <em>shul</em> and not in public. I hope however that this is the start of an answer.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> <strong>Exodus</strong> 24:12</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> <strong>Berachos</strong> 5a</p>\n<p><sup>3</sup> <strong>Rambam</strong>’s *Hakdamah *to <strong>Mishneh Torah</strong>, based on <strong>Berachos</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> <em>Cf.</em> <strong>Rashi</strong> <em>ad. loc.</em> who seems to explain that it refers to the 613 <em>mitzvos</em></p>\n<p><sup>4</sup> <strong>Rav Moshe Shapira</strong> pointed out that the word מצוה is a very strange word. It sounds tangential but I believe it was essential for his presentation. Unfortunately, I only understood it enough to leave it as a footnote. What he says is really, the word should be ציווי, which means commandment. Why is the word referred to instead as “Mitzvah”? There are certain roots which can take on different forms, and one form is a combination of them all. For example, the word שופט is a judge, and the נשפט is the one who was judged, the defendant, and the שפיטה is the judgement. משפט is usually the word which ties them all together. It represents the judge ruling a judgement towards or against the defendant. We find a similar case with a loan. A מַלוה is the lender, the לוה is the borrower, and the הלוואה is the loan. All together they can be summarized with the word מִלוה, which connotes a lender giving a loan to the borrower. So too the word Mitzvah. There’s the מְצוֶה, the commander, who commands the מְצוּוֶה, the commanded, the ציווי, the commandment. All of this is summarized with the word מצוה</p>\n<p><sup>5</sup> The <em>meforshim</em> (such as <strong>Tzafenas Paneach</strong> <em>Chatimah to Seder Zeraim</em>, <strong>Tikkunei Zohar</strong> p. 73a, brought by the <strong>Shela</strong> <em>Yoma Chapter Derech Chaim Tochechas Mussar</em> 16) point out that if you take the first two letters of מצוה, and perform the א\"ת ב\"ש conversion, you get י and ה, which are the first two letters of Hashem’s name, combined with the last two letters of מצוה to get the last two letters of Hashem’s name. This name is known as the שם המפורש, literally the explained name. The <strong>Rosh</strong> (<strong>Yoma</strong> 8:19) says that this name includes every other name of Hashem. Really, the entire Torah is made up of Hashem’s names (<strong>Ramban</strong>’s <em>Introduction to Chumash</em>)</p>\n<p><sup>6</sup> <strong>Rav Moshe Shapira</strong> got this from <strong>Seder Olam Rabbah</strong> Chapter 30</p>\n<p><sup>7</sup> It is also when the <em>yetzer hara</em> for idol worship ceased, leaving only a <em>yetzer hara</em> for heresy and lust, which were well-abused by the Greeks</p>\n<p><sup>8</sup> Even though the <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the Menorah was enacted after the cessation of prophecy, we can still say that it reflects the Divine Will. I’d say that this is so because the concept of Chanukah is alluded to in the Torah (see <strong>Ramban</strong> to <strong>Numbers</strong> 8:1). However, I believe <strong>Rav Moshe Shapira</strong> addressed this directly. <strong>Seder Olam Rabbah</strong> <em>loc. cit.</em> says that once there was a cessation to prophecy, go and listen to the Sages. <strong>Rav Moshe Shapira</strong> explained that this is because they still have some element of <em>ruach hakodesh</em>. Since the Sages were the ones to institute Chanukah, their <em>ruach hakodesh</em> can still be accessed through performing the <em>mitzvah</em> of lighting the menorah</p>\n<p><sup>9</sup> <strong>Rav Moshe Shapira</strong> added that the same is so with the <em>mitzvos</em> of Pesach. Eating <em>matzah</em> and <em>marror</em> not only are fulfilling Hashem’s commands, they reveal the essence of the miracles of Pesach</p>\n\n\n",

This ridiculous anecdote\nhas even been attributed (comment #46 to <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/shas-leader-conservative-jews-don-t-practice-real-judaism-1.299953\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a>) to, of all\npeople, Rambam (!)...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a comment on that post, a reader suggests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the \"Rabbitstotle\" legend of the great philosopher being\ncaught devouring a live rabbit,has been confused with the well\ndocumented story of Nevuchadnetzar being caught by Tzikiyahu Hamelech\ndoing the same type of act. See: Nedarim (65a), Midrash Tanchuma\n(Va'eschanan, 1), Ben Sira (II).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=33967&st=&pgnum=37&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abraham Epstein writes</a> that the ארנבת was sacred in Greek culture because it was associated with Aphrodite or Venus, and he cites Pliny as writing that one who eats its meat for seven days will acquire beauty. Looking at Pliny's Natural History, I found the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cato thought that to take hare as food is soporific, and a popular\nbelief is that it also adds charm to the person for nine days, a\nflippant pun, but so strong a belief must have some justification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_and_hares_in_art\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> provides some context:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Herodotus, Aristotle, Pliny and Claudius Aelianus all described the rabbit as one of the most fertile of animals. It thus became a symbol of vitality, sexual desire and fertility. The hare served as an attribute of Aphrodite and as a gift between lovers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In fact, the source for the quote \"Does a professor of mathematics need to be a triangle?\" actually seems to be the eclectic scholar Jacob Taubes, responding to the question of whether the non-Jewish scholar Peter Schafer was an appropriate hire for a position in Jewish studies. See Jerry Muller, <em>Professor of Apocalypse</em>, p. 401.</p>\n\n\n",

In the mid-1700’s, he sought to create a new religion that would incorporate both Judaism and Christianity, leading to the formation of the Frankist sect, centered in Poland.</p>\n<p>In 5519 (1759), the bishop of Lvov arranged for a debate between the Frankists and three prominent Jewish leaders: R. Israel of Mezhibuzh (the Baal Shem Tov), R. Chaim Rappaport, and R. Yitzchak Dovber Margulies. The four-day debate ended with a resounding victory for the rabbis, and the date was instituted as a day of rejoicing, celebrating the successful halt of the Frankists’ evil influence. (Hatamim, pp. 550, 558.

It was just a standard middle age story of Jewish renegades going to the church and telling them that the Talmud says…so therefore…with an ensuing forced debate afterwards.</p>\n<p>The Frankists had already denied all belief in Gemora at the time. They claimed to only believe in the Zohar as the authoritative Jewish book of law. They  told  that to  the Catholic Bishop of Kamenetz-Podolsk. They also made the claim  to  him  that the Zohar accepts  the Trinity Doctrine  with the messiah being one of the three (but of course neglected to say that he and they had a very different belief as to who the messiah was…)  The bishop forced the Jewish community (represented by the seven  rabbis and nineteen layleaders the church choose) to engage in debate with the Frankists.</p>\n<p>The Frankists came with nine arguments ostensibly against the Gemara  but in reality they were all very similar to the standard  Xtian  Tanach based arguments  that the Xtians believe vindicates their religion. The ones I  recall revolved around how to translate certain Hebrew words and the exact wording of a posuk. The Franists were apparently basing their arguments on Xtian translations of Tanach as opposed to the original Loshon Kodosh version.  That put the Rabbis in a bind because they couldn’t speak too strongly against Xtianity  when participating in a forced debate under the auspices of the bishop. They therefore answered  in general terms.</p>\n<p>As expected the ruling was in favor of the Frankists. The bishop ordered the Jewish community  to pay a fine to the Frankists , and to burn all copies of the Gemara  in Podolia.</p>\n<p>With that background  other than the main points there probably wasn’t anything of major ideological substance being said at that debate anyway. Therefore probably  no one felt the need to record  the actual debate in detail. Reb Dov Ber from Buchilov in the sefer Divrei Bina writes his account of what he saw transpire but as far as what I saw quoted (I never saw his actual sefer)   did not include what was actually said at the debate.</p>\n\n\n",

But has its own charm when you get used to it.\nIncludes several commentaries: Efodi, Shem Tov, Crescas, Abarbanel.

A very useful appendix is a cleaned-up edition of ibn Tibbon's glossary of foreign words. There's also a very useful section of the introduction on peculiarities of ibn Tibbon's hebrew. Published in one volume by Mossad HaRav Kook.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Even Shmuel/Kaufman's Edition of ibn Tibbon Plus Commentary</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Four volumes from Mossad HaRav Kook.

The Hebrew is Rabbinic, sometimes strange to read. Like ibn Tibbon, R Kafih aimed for literalness. Enlightening notes on choices he made when translating. I feel you miss out, though, in not getting exposed to the ibn Tibbon terminology, which became basic in hebrew philosophical writing for centuries. Published in one volume by Mossad HaRav Kook.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Michael Schwartz Translation</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Very recent translation published by Tel Aviv University Press. Unlike others, this is in Israeli Hebrew and also, unlike others, the notes draw on academic scholarship. Flows and reads much more easily than others.</p>\n\n<p>If you are comfortable in Israeli Hebrew, I think the Schwartz translation is the most likely to seem understandable and clear.</p>\n\n\n",

The only positive command applicable to non-Jews is that of setting up a justice system- a command which is unlikely to conflict with human dignity. Thus, there would never be a situation in which the dignity of a non-Jew would come into conflict with either a Rabbinic prohibition or a Biblical law applicable to them.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that כבוד הבריות does not refer to human dignity <em>per se</em>, but human dignity when in conflict with halacha.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is the Ramchal's sefer Derech Hashem based on any particular Rishon?",
    "content": "# Is the Ramchal's sefer Derech Hashem based on any particular Rishon?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Many books written by (early) Achronim are based on a particular shittah usually sourced in one or more of the Rishonim. This can be true both with regards to actual halachos or lists of mitzvos and of hashkofah books. Did the Ramchal have a particular shittah that he subscribed to which could be seen as a source for his book Derech Hashem?\nAlso, can the Ramchal be said to have generally subscribed to a particular shittah in the Rishonim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I was a bit confused by your question because 'shitah' is usually a term used in learning halakhah but Derekh Hashem isn't a book of halakhah, i.e., what to do, but rather a presentation of a conceptual framework for understanding religion and the world. As far as the sources of the ideas: they come in large part out the Ramhal's engagement with the writings of the Ari and his working out a way of understanding them. The Ramhal took the writings of the Ari to be metaphorical and sought to penetrate to inner meanings, concerning the workings of providence and the processes of spiritual life. He works out these metaphorical interpretations in his other books, like 'Klalim Rishonim', 'Kla\"h Pithey Hokhmah', and 'Adir Ba-Marom'. Then, in Derekh Hashem, the Ramhal presents just the conclusions of his interpretative enterprise, without reference to the original language of the Ari and without explicitly using any kabbalistic terminology at all. So the content comes out of the Kabbalah of the Ari, but it's a personal understanding or re-interpretation of that body of teachings, and is stripped of its original terminology.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>While the influence of Lurianic Kabbala is certainly there, a lot of the ideas in Derech Hashem can be traced back to R' Saadia Gaon's \"Emunot v'Deot\"  \"Emunot v'Deot\" was the first attempt to present Jewish thought in a systematic framework, which is exactly what \"Derech Hashem\" does.  Moreover, some of the actual content of Emunot v'Deot and Derech Hashem agree.  I highly recommend the Hacket publishing version of \"Emunot v'Deot\" as a starting point to compare the two works, since the Hacket version presents selections from R' Saadia Gaon's philosophy.</p>\n\n\n",

Why should we assume that the very first plants grew by photosynthesis in the same way that plants do now?  Or if we do, why not assume that the primordial light created on the first day was enough to produce this effect?</p>\n\n<p>But setting all that aside, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8166#showrashi=true&v=5\">Bereishit 2:5</a> presents us with a related question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Now no tree of the field was yet on the earth, neither did any herb of the field yet grow, because the Lord God had not brought rain upon the earth, and there was no man to work the soil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It's not clear when this text refers to; it falls after vay'chulu and and before the (second) creation of Adam.  This verse seems to say that plants depended on man being available to work the soil.  But chapter 1 says we got plants on day 3, so how do we resolve this?  Rashi offers the following interpretation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>neither did any herb of the field yet grow:</strong> [I.e.,] had not yet grown. And on the third [day], where it is written: “Let the earth bring forth,” they [the plants] had not yet emerged, but they stood at the entrance of the ground until the sixth day. And why?</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Because… not caused it to rain:</strong> Because there was no man to work the soil, and no one recognized the benefit of rain, but when man came and understood that they were essential to the world, he prayed for them, and they fell, and the trees and the herbs sprouted. — [from Chul. 60b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rashi, when God created the plants, trees, and grasses on day three, they didn't actually start growing -- they were, essentially, \"queued up\" underground, waiting for rain, which in turn waited for a man to recognize the <em>need</em> for rain and pray for it.</p>\n\n<p>With Rashi's interpretation, the sun, moon, and stars were well-established before the need for photosynthesis arose.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Ralbag has two explanations of the order of creation that can address this. The first explanation is that everything existed at once. The sequence delineated in Genesis is just the order in which they were revealed. This is likened to someone who plants various seeds at the same time but some sprout before others. The second explanation is that existence is attributed to some things before others in order to show their priority in essence and cause (i.e. the sequence is not meant chronologically).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>והנה המשילו החכמים הגלות ההויה בקצת הדברים קודם קצת במעשה בראשית למי\n  שזרע זרעים חלוקים יחד בארץ ויצמחו קצתם קודם קצת וכן אמרו שהיה הענין\n  בהוית העולם שהכל נתהוה יחד מהשם יתע' ונגלה קצתו קודם קצת או נאמר שכבר\n  נתיחסה ההויה לקצת הדברים קודם קצת להעיר על היותם קודמים בעצם ובסבה כי\n  כונת התורה היא להעמידנו על חכמת הנמצאות בזה הספור הבפלא כמו שקדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(See also his similar discussion in Wars of the Lord ('מלחמות ה) Book VI Part 2 Chapter 8.)</p>\n\n<p>R.

If you make Tcheles by the opinion of Rambam you can buy a Tcheles of Raavad (same price) and split it to two sets of Rambam. I personally made it number of times. The idea is that in set of Raavad one whole string is colored, while in Rambam you need only half string to be colored. So, you buy one set of Raavad and another simple set of white strings.

Dissolving a sauce which is customary to each in a congealed state, such as fish sauce, is also permitted.</p>\n\n<p>Since the above all talk about placing on top of a pot and not directly on the fire, you would need to using an inverted pan (or even a pot!) underneath any food that you are warming.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, regarding Ezras Nashim (women) and Ezras Israel:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The court of women is holier (than <em>chel</em> - rampart), for a tevul yom may not enter it, though he is not obligated a <em>hatat</em> (sin offering) for doing so. The court of the Israelites is holier, for a man who has not yet offered his obligatory sacrifices may not enter it, and if he enters he is liable for a <em>hatat</em> (sin offering).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding restictions for Ezras Nashim, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.1.8?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Ovadia m'Bertinoro</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאין טבול יום נכנס לשם – Jehoshaphat and his legal court decreed (see Tractate Yevamot 7a and Tractate Pesahim 92a) on the one who immersed that day/טבול יום (but a Kohen who had just immersed following a period of impurity cannot partake of heave-offering/Terumah until after nightfall; see Tractate Berakhot, Chapter 1, Mishnah 1) that he/she should not enter into the Women’s Courtyard. As it is written (II Chronicles 20:5): “Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem in the House of the LORD at the front of the new court.” And they stated in the Gemara (see above): “What is the new court?” That they renewed things in it and stated, that a person who has just immersed following a period of impurity/טבול יום cannot enter into the Levite camp, but not in all of the Levite camp, but rather only [not] in the Women’s Court alone. And they decreed on the person who has just immersed following a period of impurity but did not make a decree on someone lacking atonement/מחוסר כפורים, because a person who has just immersed following a period of impurity is prohibited to [partake of] heave-offering/Terumah, but someone lacking atonement (i.e., a sacrifice) is permitted to [partake of] heave-offering/Terumah (if that individual is a Kohen or married to one). And all whose defilement is more serious than that of his fellow, his banishment/exile is more severe than that of his fellow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By comparison, restrictions on Ezras Israel are much stronger, which explains its smaller size:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאין מחוסר כפורים נכנס לשם – and the same law applies that it (i.e., the Mishnah) is able to teach that a ritually pure person is not able to enter there until he immerses [in a Mikveh], for this is taught [in the Mishnah] in the chapter \"אמר להם הממונה\"/The supervisor said to them [Tractate Yoma, Chapter 3, Mishnah 3]: “No pure person enters the Temple courtyard until he immerses [in a Mikveh” [Talmud Yoma 30a].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, everyone, who entered Ezras Nashim would stand in line to go to a mikveh, then enter Ezras Israel to proceed bringing the offering and then leave.

He also describes how to discern a prophet who appears to meet the qualifications, but still is shown to not be an authentic prophet. Among <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904992/jewish/Chapter-Eight.htm\">them</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Therefore, if a prophet arises and attempts to dispute Moses' prophecy by performing great signs and wonders, we should not listen to him.

Such a contradiction would render a prophet a false prophet. For instance, who was bound by Abraham? Was it Ishmael or Isaac?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Now to examine each of these in turn, in greater detail.</p>\n\n<p><h1>1</h1> According to Midrash Tanchuma, prophecy was explicitly removed from the gentiles in the time of Bilaam. The other gentile prophets, including Iyov, lived about the same time.</p>\n\n<p>This midrash reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכל גדולה שנטלו ישראל, את מוצא שנטלו האומות כיוצא בה. \n  העמיד משה לישראל שהיה מדבר עמו כל זמן שירצה. \n  העמיד להם בלעם, מדבר עמו כל זמן שירצה. </p>\n  \n  <p>ראה מה בין נביאי ישראל לנביאי האומות. \n  נביאי ישראל מזהירין את האומות על העבירות. \n  וכן הוא אומר: נביא לגוים נתתיך. \n  ונביאים שהעמיד מן האומות, נותנים פרצה לאבד את הבריות מן העולם הבא. </p>\n  \n  <p>ולא עוד, אלא כל הנביאים היו במידת רחמים על ישראל ועל אומות העולם.\n  שכן ישעיה אומר: על כן מעי למואב ככנור יהמו וגו' (ישע' טז יא). \n  וכן יחזקאל אומר: בן אדם שא על צור קינה (יחז' כז ב). \n  ונביאי אומות העולם, היו במידת אכזריות, שזה עמד לעקור אומה שלמה חנם על לא דבר. לכך נכתבה פרשת בלעם, להודיע למה סלק הקדוש ברוך הוא רוח הקדש מאומות העולם, שזה עמד מהם, וראה מה עשה: </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My translation:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And every greatness you find that Israel took, the nations took likewise. He established Moshe for Israel, who spoke with him any time he wished. And He established for them [the gentiles] Bilaam, who spoke with him any time he wished.</p>\n  \n  <p>See the difference between the prophets of Israel and the gentile prophets. The Israelite prophets warn the gentile nations about sins. And so is said [regarding Jeremiah] 'I have set you as a prophet for the nations. And the prophets He established from the gentile nations, they placed a breach to remove people from the world to come.</p>\n  \n  <p>And not only that, but all the [Israelite] prophets worked via the trait of mercy upon both Israel and the nations of the world, for so Isaiah says, 'therefore my bowels for Moav vibrate like a harp, etc.' (Isaiah 16:11) And the nations of the world acted with a trait of cruelty, for this one [Bilaam] arose to uproot an entire nation for absolutely nothing. </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Therefore the parasha of Bilaam was written [in the Torah], to inform why the Holy One, Blessed Be He removed the holy spirit [prophecy] from the nations of the world, for this one arose from them, and see what he did!</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><h1>2</h1> Muhammad, like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miniver_Cheevy\">Minever Cheevy</a>, was born too late. According the the Talmud (Sotah 48b), at a specific point in time, prophecy was removed from the Israelites.</p>\n\n<p>In Sotah 48b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Our Rabbis have taught: When Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi died, the Holy Spirit10  departed from Israel; nevertheless they made use of the Bath Kol.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>One can draw a <em>kal vachomer</em> (a fortiori), that if it was removed from Israel, surely it was removed from outside Israel.</p>\n\n<p>In Bava Batra 12b, this is stated about prophets in general:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Johanan said: Since the Temple was destroyed, prophecy has been taken from prophets and given to fools and children. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><h1>3</h1> The list of gentile prophets appears to be a closed set of a maximum of seven. These were all people in the generation of Bilaam. From Bava Batra 15b:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Seven prophets prophesied to the heathen, namely, Balaam and his father, Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, Zophar the Naamathite, and Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bilaam and his father (Beor) lived approximately the same time, and the other characters are from the book of Job, who is chronologically often placed at the same time at Bilaam. The Talmud continues to specify that many some of these were not gentiles, but just had prophesied <strong>toward</strong> the gentiles. This includes Job, which strips one of your two examples from your list. Another rabbinic position is that the entire book of Job is fictional wisdom literature. While Job the person, and his righteousness, were historical, the events depicted in the book of Job did not occur.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/olam_hatanah/mefaresh.asp?book=3&mefaresh=raba&perek=1\">Vayikra Rabba 1:13</a> also lists many restrictions on gentile prophecy, in terms of its status. And one such restriction is that it ended with the erection of the Tabernacle (Mishkan):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אמר רבי יצחק: \n  עד שלא הוקם המשכן היתה נבואה מצויה באומות העולם. משהוקם המשכן נסתלקה מביניהם, שנאמר: (שיר ג)אחזתיו ולא ארפנו. \n  אמרו לו: הרי בלעם מתנבא?! \n  אמר להן: לטובתן של ישראל נתנבא. \n  (במדבר כג) מי מנה עפר יעקב. \n  (שם ) לא הביט און ביעקב. \n  (שם) כי לא נחש ביעקב מה טובו אוהליך יעקב. \n  (שם כד) דרך כוכב מיעקב. \n  (שם) וירד מיעקב.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Bilaam seems a counterexample but it explains why he was the exception, that he prophesied for the benefit of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>The general trend and assumption of Rabbinic sources then seems to be that even in their days, gentile prophecy no longer existed.</p>\n\n<h1>4</h1>\n\n<p>Muhammad founded a religion which differs greatly in theology and matters of Biblical history from that established by the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>Such a contradiction would render a prophet a false prophet. Indeed, some Biblical books, by Israelite authors, were going to be tossed out of the Biblical canon for contradicting the Torah. For <a href=\"http://www.islamic-awareness.org/Quran/Contrad/MusTrad/sacrifice.html\">instance</a>, the Qur'an has Abraham binding Ishmael rather than Isaac:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In the tale of binding (surah 37:99-110) Muhammad identified the son who was to be sacrificed as Ishmael and, indeed, the opinion of the traditionalists were also divided on this subject. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is not the place to debate differences between Jewish and Muslim theology, and between Biblical and Quranic history. But there is certainly enough for one to argue that they differ.</p>\n\n<p>For all these four reasons, at least, Jews would not have believed that Muhammad was a true prophet.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>Coming in late to the party, so this just comes to reinforce Yishai's answer, but I feel  compelled to mention the Rambam's \"Iggeret Teyman\".</p>\n\n<p>Background: The <a href=\"http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Epistle_to_Yemen\">\"Epistle to Yemen\"</a> was written by Maimonides back in 1172, specifically to answer the rabbis of the Jewish community in Yemen who were being forced to convert to Islam.  There was apparently a self-proclaimed \"prophet\" who had converted recently Islam and was claiming to be the messiah.  The confusion in the community had prompted them to write the Rambam for an answer.  The Rambam carefully explains why we do not not accept Islam (or Muhammad as a prophet), and declares this convert to be mad.</p>\n\n<p>The whole Iggeret is worth reading, but Here are some choice quotes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"Our disbelief in the prophecy of Omar and Zeid is <strong>not due to the\n  fact that they are non-Jews,</strong> as the unlettered folk imagine, and in\n  consequence of which they are compelled to justify their standpoint by\n  the Biblical statement \"from thy midst, out of thy brethren.\" For Job,\n  Zophar, Bildad, Eliphaz, and Elihu are all considered prophets and are\n  non-Jews.\"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"Any prophet, therefore, no matter what his pedigree is, be he priest,\n  Levite, or Amalekite, is perfidious even if he asserts that only one\n  of the precepts of the Torah is void, in view of the Mosaic\n  pronouncement \"unto us and unto our children forever.\" Such a one we\n  would declare a false prophet and would execute him if we had\n  jurisdiction over him. \"</p>\n  \n  <p>\"If a Jewish or Gentile prophet urges and encourages people to follow\n  the religion of Moses without adding thereto or diminishing therefrom,\n  like Isaiah, Jeremiah, and the others, we demand a miracle from\n  him....   ...However, if the would-be-prophet teaches tenets that\n  negate the doctrines of Moses, then we must repudiate him. \"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, as soon as Muhammad claimed that the texts of the Torah are no longer relevant, he is automatically considered by Judaism to be (at best) a deluded individual.  At worst, his is a False Prophet, with all the negativity that implies.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, as soon as a woman was married, having relations with any other man would automatically be \"adultery.\" However a married man could in theory run off and marry some other woman in addition to his first wife; we'd call this \"polygamy\", not \"adultery.\" So even if there was no marriage between them, we couldn't call it \"adultery\" because there was no rule of \"no other women\" on this man.</p>\n\n<p><em>Clearly</em>, if a married woman has consensual relations with a man who's not her husband, <strong>both</strong> of them are deemed equally guilty and have equal punishment.</p>\n\n<p>Now today Judaism has banned polygamy, and a couple goes in with the understanding that it's just one man and one woman in this marriage.

Usually these bans are put in place by Israeli Charedi Rabbis. To my knowledge most of these bans are either due to the author not adhering to the banning rabbis' view of Chazal's knowledge of science or due to the stories told about famous rabbinic personalities. </p>\n\n<p>My question is as follows: when a ban is placed on a book does it become \"assur\" (forbidden) to read/own that book? If so, what is the nature of the issur? (i.e. what is the issur exactly?)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>One of the most prominent bans in the time period referenced was that of several books written by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natan_Slifkin\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R.

Joseph Ibn Aknin (in his commentary to the Song of Songs), R. Hai Gaon (939-1038), 'the last and greatest of the Geonim,' did not hesitate to use Arabic sources, including Arabic love songs, to prove a Talmudic point; in addition, he quotes the Koran and Hadith (the sayings and doings of Muhammed). (page 22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In rabbinic sources after the rise of Islam? Certainly, there was a cross-pollination of ideas. It may not be that a given rabbi was reading the Hadith per se, it may have been that they heard something from someone and said \"wow, that's powerful.\" They may have known it was recorded as Hadith; or that it was loosely based on Islamic thought; or not at all. The \"non-attribution\" thing isn't such a big deal; there were points in time when the scholarly style was \"I will say my thing, and you can figure out for yourself what sources this is drawing on.\" (Rabbi Pelkovitz points this out about the Sforno.)</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bdld.info/2013/09/17/judaism-on-jihad/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here's a blog</a> on the quotation found in both <em>Chovot HaLevavot</em> (and then later rabbinic sources) and the Hadith about a victorious army returning home -- \"you've won the easy war; now comes the hard war [i.e. how to live in peacetime with justice and a sense of purpose].\" He quotes material about the noted overlap between <em>Chovot HaLevavot</em> and the Hadith.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, there have been rabbis who were unimpressed by scholars who could quote a great number of sources but couldn't think critically about them. The description used was -- \"it's like a donkey carrying a giant load of books.\" It's said this colorful put-down also originated in Islamic thought.</p>\n\n<p>Look, the Talmud says (Sanhedrin 38b) that the sage Rabbi Meir (who lived around the year 100) would teach Proverbs with all sorts of stories about foxes. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop%27s_Fables\" rel=\"nofollow\">Doesn't that sound like somebody else?</a> That's okay!</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why identify personalities in midrash?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/26136\">noted</a> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/26335\">previously</a> on this site (quoting <a href=\"http://www.ottmall.com/mj_ht_arch/v46/mj_v46i55.html#CQZ\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mail-Jewish</a>), there's a general tendency in <em>midrashim</em> to claim two persons in <em>Tanach</em> are the same. This is familiar to anyone who has studied <em>Rashi</em>'s commentary on <em>Chumash</em>: for example, <em>Lot</em> is not only <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175#v=31\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Avraham</em>'s nephew</a> but <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8175#showrashi=true&v=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">also his brother-in-law</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8209#showrashi=true&v=13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the man who told <em>Avraham</em> of his capture</a> <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9967#v=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">later reigned in <em>Bashan</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p>While there is doubtless a good reason for this every time it's done, I'm trying to understand the reason for the general tendency. Why do <em>midrashim</em> tend to identify people? What philosophical or religious or textual or rhetorical or other ideal does it further?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>R' Tzvi Hirsch Chayos in <em>Mavo HaTalmud</em> writes about various midrashic methodologies employed by Chazal in the <em>Gemara</em> and <em>Midrash</em>. In the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=22101&st=&pgnum=46&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">twenty-first chapter</a>, he discusses this tendency to identify a person mentioned in Tanach with someone else in Tanach, or to equate two names as belonging to the same person (e.g. \"הוא מלאכי הוא עזרא\").</p>\n\n<p>Chayos treats this as a subcategory of the more general genre of attributing righteous actions to <em>tzaddikim</em> even with only slight prompts from the text and/or mitigating what seems to be their negative actions or qualities even when they are explicit (think, for example, of Chazal's treatment of David and Bathsheva). This works in the reverse as well; Chazal tend to attribute bad deeds to otherwise known <em>resha-im</em> and to downplay their \"seemingly\" redemptive qualities. He discusses examples of this and the reasons for these exegetical methods in the previous (twentieth) chapter.</p>\n\n<p>Based on this, Chayos writes, Chazal often equated two people as the same individual for the purpose of bringing out their similar qualities or specific similarity. They may identify a certain personality as \"identical\" to another to emphasize the (good or bad) quality in the former that is apparent and known in the latter. This way, in the case of a righteous individual, they are heaping upon them praise by associating them with another righteous individual with additional great qualities. The same is true in the reverse (for the unrighteous).</p>\n\n<p>Another approach is seemingly taken by more modern <em>parshanim</em>. (I can't seem to find a good source for it, but Josh Waxman over at ParshaBlog uses it from time to time.) That is the \"closed canon\" approach of the Midrash, as opposed to the \"open canon\" approach. The closed canon approach holds that everything necessary for the interpretation of Tanach is included somehow in the Tanach itself. There is nothing that cannot be understood without reference to external sources. What seems to follow from this is that if we are introduced to a figure in Tanach without background on who s/he is, we must be able to identify them as someone who is mentioned elsewhere whose background is given. The \"open canon\" approach, on the other hand, would hold that this is just a reference to someone who we do not otherwise have any information about.</p>\n\n<p>The particulars of the above distinction seem ambiguous and may not be considered constant. What is considered enough information about a person for them to be considered \"known\" in Tanach, versus the references to \"unknown\" people that need to be identified? I'm not sure that rigid boundaries for something like this necessarily exist.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Chazal in many places say something like \"the real name of x is y\", followed by the question \"so why was he called x?\" - \"to teach you something important about him that cannot be learned from his given name\".</p>\n\n<p>The explanation of all this is that a person's given name is supposed to reflect his essential being, but some people do not 'live up to their name' and so their essential being is better expressed by an alternative name (or names).</p>\n\n<p>And some people do live up to their names but their given names are not sufficient to fully describe what they achieved in their life. So, for example both Moshe and Yisro had many names, each one describing a different aspect of who he really was.</p>\n\n\n",

This being the case, let me rephrase the question somewhat: Is the common Sephardic custom of repeating the penultimate verse of Song of Songs based on the same considerations that motivate the repetition of the penultimate verses of YTQQ? According to <a href=\"//he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%91%D7%9F_%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joseph Ben Naim (1882-1960)</a>, it is (see <em>Nohg Bhkma: Oasr Blum Sl Mnhgim ʿl D. Hlqe HSuʿ Snhgu Bkl Qhilot Ysrel Bmzrh Ubmʿrb</em>, 247, also quoted in Spiegel linked below). This is also <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Kugel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">James Kugel</a>'s position (see <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=tbwzCwAAQBAJ&v=snippet&q=begone&f=false#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Great Shift: Encountering God in Biblical Times</em>, 299-300</a>). On the other hand, Prof. Y.S. Spiegel of Bar Ilan argues that this is actually based on the once-popular custom of introducing and concluding biblical readings with a thematically appropriate verse (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/he/book/book.php?book=158877&width=0&scroll=0&udid=0&pagenum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a>). I might add that none of the older Sephardic siddurim I have checked mention anything about verse-repetition after Song of Songs. It seems that this custom only begins to be included in Sephardic Siddurim printed after WWII.      </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are we required to light Chanukah lights only for about half an hour?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Since the miracle of the oil of Chanukah was that from one flask of oil they miraculously had enough oil for the menorah to burn all night for eight days, why did Chazal require us to light only for about half an hour, and not the whole night?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>My understanding the reason chanukah candles are not required to burn the entire night is tied to the difference between chanukah candles and shabbos candles.  Shabbos candles are to provide light and one would expect them to burn a long time (the whole night), but chanukah candles are specifically not to provide light, but to remind us of the miracle that occurred.  That is why we have a shammas, so if we do inadvertantly use the chanukah candles for light, we can say we are just using the shammas for that.  By only requiring the candles to burn for 30 minutes, that reinforces that the we are not using the candles to provide light.</p>\n\n<p>Referencing an article in the latest \"Torah To-Go\" published by Yeshiva University for Chanukah 5774, Rabbi David Palmer writes in his article \"Let There be Points of Light\", he states, \"According to the Rosh, the Chanuka candles are not meant for illumination, but to be points of light for us to notice them. Since candles typically function as sources of illumination, the Chanuka candles are apt to be misconstrued as lights, which they aren't supposed to be; rather, they are supposed to be markers, or indicators, or signs. The Chanuka candles are intended to advertise the miracles of Chanuka. We view the Chanuka candles the way we view yizkor candles or yahrtzeit candles: as objects that we take note of, that remind us of something. This only works when the significance of the candles is evident. But when they are seen as lights, as illumination, then they fail as reminders.\"</p>\n\n<p>As to the specific timing, I was always taught that in ancient times, passers by would still be returning home during the first 30 minutes after dark, but after that, there would not be as many people to whom you would advertise the miracle.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Admor Meostrovtze offers a fascinating explanation as to why Chazal decided that we should light Chanuka candles for specifically half an hour.</p>\n\n<p>Each Chanuka a person lights 36 candles in total (excluding the Shamoshim). If we light each candle for half an hour, there is a total of 18 hours of Chanuka candles burning each year. Since a person’s lifespan is seventy years (as it says in Tehillim:ימי שנותינו בהם שבעים שנהם) one lives through 1260 hours of candles burning (18 X 70 = 1260). This corresponds exactly to the amount of hours the miracle occurred during the original Chanuka:</p>\n\n<p>It is known that one of the candles in the (the \"Ner Maaravi\") would always burn miraculously throughout the day, after the other six candles had burned out. To calculate the amount of time the Chanuka miracle happened we need to exclude the daytime burning of the Ner Maaravi since that would always experience a miracle and is not unique to Chanuka. Therefore the calculation is as follows: </p>\n\n<p>The other six candles burned for 24 hours a day for eight days, a total of 1152 hours (6 X 24 X 8 = 1152). The Chanuka miracle with the middle candle occurred only during the night. According to the opinion that is from צאת הכוכבים till שקיעת החמה is one and a half hours, the length of the night is 13 ½ hours. Thus the miracle of for the middle candle during the entire Chanuka lasted 108 hours (13.5 X 8). If we add that to the 1152 hours the other six candles burned for, the total amount of time for the miracle of Chanuka was 1260 hours (1152 + 108), exactly the same amount as the amount of hours one lights Chanuka candles throughout his life!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The sefer מאיר עיני חכמים answers this question as follows:</p>\n\n<p>First we have to answer a different question - why did Chazal establish this festival of Chanukah with praise and thanksgiving because of the open miracle which they experienced at that time, that one day’s worth of oil miraculously lasted for eight days? Surely they saw such a miracle on a daily basis with the Ner Ma’aravi, which only had enough oil to last the whole night like all the other lamps but nevertheless miraculously burned the whole day! How was the miracle of the oil of Chanukah different from the miracle that they were accustomed to witness every day?</p>\n\n<p>To answer this question we first need to remember that every day the Kohanim had to put enough oil in each lamp so that they would burn the whole night until the morning. And because there is a question as to whether the period of bein hashmoshos (twilight) is day or night, they needed to light the menorah before this time, and Chazal calculated that the total amount needed was half a log of oil, and so this was the amount which they placed in all the lamps (including the Ner Ma’aravi) each day before bein hashmoshos.\nThus, the amount of time that the Ner Ma’aravi miraculously burned during the day was a whole day (12 hours) minus the length of bein hashmoshos.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to our original question, if Chazal had wanted to establish the festival of\nChanukah because of the miracle that the oil burned all night for eight days, they certainly would have commanded us to light the whole night as a remembrance of the\nmiracle. But if they had done so it would not have been very clear that we are celebrating the special miracle of Chanukah, since part of this time period - 12 hours minus bein hashmoshos - was a miracle they saw every day with the Ner Ma’aravi.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Chazal instead wisely established the lighting of Chanukah lights for\nthe amount of time that the miracle of the oil of Chanukah exceeded the miracle of\nthe Ner Ma’arvi. This works out to be twice the time period of bein hashmoshos, because the Ner Ma'aravi miraculously stayed alight for 12 hours minus the period of bein hashmoshos, but during the eight days of Chanukah the lamps miraculously stayed alight for 12 hours plus the period of bein hashmoshos. Thus it is now clear why Chazal commanded us to light the Chanukah lights for a period twice that of bein hashmoshos, which is approximately half an hour.</p>\n\n<p>The full text in English can be found <a href=\"http://shlomokluger.com/Other-Books/Meir-Einei-Chachamim/Chanukah.html#1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, and it is well worth a look because he goes on to explain how the three opinions as to the amount of time we are required to light the Chanukah lights are precisely in accordance with the three opinions as to the length of bein hashmoshos.</p>\n\n\n",

Now, after one hears someone else say a \"harachaman\" in Birkat Hamazon it is proper to respond \"amen\" (see Mishnah Berurah 189:5), but I had assumed that one is supposed to recite the harachamans himself as well if he is bentching.

But that means, in an atheistic sense those beings are gods. The Israelites think they are gods. So why does G-d call them demons?</p>\n\n<p>They should be just nonsense gods that exist only in believers' minds. G-d is apparently atheistic, so to speak, when it comes to other gods.</p>\n\n<p>Another way to interpret this is to see that 1, 2, and 3 are describing real beings. So, 1 are demons that Israelites think are gods. Number 2 and 3 are gods that Israelites think are gods. G-D thinks the Israelites are stupid not for worshiping non-existent gods but for worshiping gods that <em>they had never known</em> and <em>that had come recently</em></p>\n\n<p>So we do have other gods, namely <em>demons</em> and those that \"<em>they had never known</em> and <em>that they had come to know recently</em>.\"</p>\n\n<p>Another explanation is that when people believe in other gods, those other gods are actually demons.

We have virtually no description of what any Biblical character looked like, unless it occasionally serves to drive the plot (\"Joseph was very good looking ... and then his master's wife said...\").</p>\n\n<p>On a different level, the written format forces us to do the hard work of thinking about the meaning of things, and how to interpret them. Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz has compared this to the difference between baking a cake <em>for</em> your 4-year-old child, vs. baking a cake <em>with</em> your 4-year-old child. The latter is a lot more work, but it shows a lot more love.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question mirrors Rabbi Levi Yitzchak Bardishov's <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sichos-in-english/3/20.htm#n255\" rel=\"nofollow\">famous complaint</a> that Gan Eden and Gehinom are written in books, but the pleasures of this world are readily seen and experienced. If we could experience Gan Eden and Gehinom and only find the pleasures of this world in a book, things would be very different.</p>\n\n<p>There is a lot written and spoken about this fundamental problem. For example, you will find online many videos of Rabbi Mannis Friedman associating this with Modesty. Not seeing something visually allows you to work on knowing it, which is a much more profound connection, whereas seeing removes the desire for the intellectual connection and replaces it with a visceral one.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>there are many reasons for this. one reason is that if that were the case, it would be the end of free will, noone could deny the authenticity of the torah, and this would defeat the purpose of creation as brought down in the beginning of the book Derech Hashem by Rabbi Luzzato. (assuming it could not be claimed to be fake)</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the text version allows for many allusions in permutations of letters, gematrias, comparison to other words - basically a whole world of hidden layers of information and meanings which can only be analyzed in text format.</p>\n\n<p>For example, The text of parsha Haazinu <a href=\"http://revach.net/article.php?id=4755\" rel=\"nofollow\">is said</a> to allude to everything that will happen in the creation until the time of moshiach.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason, thoughts of wisdom are best transmitted by the written word - not by video. Video is best for documenting visual events.</p>\n\n\n",

If the traveler's wife will be lighting for him in his house, the custom of the Sefardim (see Beis Yosef there) would be for the guest not to light at all. Many - but not all - Ashkenazi poskim say that the guest should still light (or join the host) where he is, so the Mishnah Berurah (677:15) writes that it's better for him to listen to someone else make the bracha, but if that's not possible, to light with a bracha. </p>\n\n<p>In the case where one has a host who will be lighting, the guest should give some money to the host in order to 'acquire' some of the oil being lit by his guest (Ran Shabbos daf 10, Magen Avraham 677:1). The Mishnah Berurah (s.k. 7) writes that it is better for a guest to light his own candles, but R. Eliyahu Shlesinger (Ner Ish UVeito, p. 368) and R. Hershel Schachter has told this to me as well.</p>\n\n<p>If one is sleeping at home, but eating elsewhere, he still lights at home (Taz 677:2)</p>\n\n<p>However, if one is eating <strong>and</strong> sleeping somewhere other than his house, and these are in two different places, then the Shulchan Aruch writes, (677:2) based on the Tur, that one should light in his place of sleeping, but the Rama notes there that the Ashkenizic custom (based on the Rashba) is to light where one eats. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I was scheduled to eat at another family's house this year on Friday night of Chanuka, and I asked my rabbi what to do.

Jews do not pray to the Torah. That is akin to idol worship. They might pray in the direction of the Temple but they do not pray to any physical object. You must be asking non-religious Jews or Jews who are culturally Jewish, not necessarily practicing. Perhaps you could help them learn more about Judaism :)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Will editing genome of embryo having Jewish parents diminish Jewish status of later child?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a dreadful genetic illness known as Tay-Sachs requiring two\ncarriers to activate the fatal effects in a child.</p>\n\n<p>Probably, in reaction to the 20th century eugenics movement and its\nterrible results, I seems most poskim would be \nagainst any alteration of the human genome for any reason, and\nprobably forbid it for their communities, in the name of the\nsanctity of human life.</p>\n\n<p>There will come a time when humanity develops the technology to\nedit a child's genome, and to also completely identify the key\ngenes responsible for full-blown Tay-Sachs.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming two Jewish parents desired to conceive a child using \nIVF from which the Tay-Sachs had been edited out along the way, \nwould this still be forbidden?</p>\n\n<p>If so, would only the parents suffer the moral consequences?\nOr would any Jewish child whose genome had been edited in any\nmanner even for therapeutic purposes, no longer be considered\nfully Jewish (i.e. mamzer or karet) as a deterrent against \nsuch an action?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There's a great deal of speculation to this question, but here goes:</p>\n\n<p>Therapeutic genetic engineering is not necessarily a problem for Jews. Here's a note from the late Kabbalist and physicist Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan about <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=30#C573\" rel=\"nofollow\">genetic alteration</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Jacob was able to direct spiritual energy and actually to change the genetic structure of the sheep (Bereshith Rabbah 73; Midrash Tehillim 8:6; Tanchuma B 24; Midrash HaGadol). Kabbalistic sources note that at this time, Jacob was manipulating some of the highest spiritual forces that exist (Zohar 161a, 163a; Etz Chaim, Shaar HaAkudim)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My understanding is that with today's technology, all discussions of modifying an organism's genes have been via a massive dose of virus, and that therapeutic genetic engineering has not as of yet been worth its risks to the patient.</p>\n\n<p>Practically, when IVF is done <strong>today</strong>, the doctors have a few embryos to choose from (in preparation for the process, the mother-to-be is given drugs to increase her ovulation), and will do whatever tests they can to choose and implant two or so that are believed not to carry any disease. That is normal operating procedures right now.</p>\n\n<p>I would very much like to believe that by the point in the future that genetic engineering technology reaches the capability you describe (if it ever does), Ashkenazic Jews will have <em>long ago</em> all gotten in the habit of being screened for Tay-Sachs carrier status and therefore not have two carriers marry each other. This technology (and recommendation) has been around for a few decades.</p>\n\n<p>As for <em>mamzer</em>: Rabbi Moshe Feinstein's position was that the only way a child can become a <em>mamzer</em> is if it was produced by a prohibited sexual act. (E.g. if a married Jewish woman was artificially inseminated by a Jewish man who wasn't her husband, the offspring still wouldn't be a <em>mamzer.</em>) So I can't see this as relevant here. Note that blame has nothing to do with who the law deems a <em>mamzer</em>: the Torah makes it crystal-clear that we do not blame the victim of a rape (<a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=22\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deut. 22:26</a>), but if a married Jewish woman is raped by a Jew other than her husband, the offspring would still be a <em>mamzer</em>.</p>\n\n<p>As for communal sanctions, \"shunning\", excommunications, or whatever -- I can't fathom a situation in which the community would be privy to this sort of incredibly private information, let alone why it would be any of their business. To draw an analogy from today's technology: if a couple somehow found out they were carrying a Tay-Sachs baby, G-d forbid, Rabbi Eliezer Waldenberg of Jerusalem felt they were allowed to abort it in early stages, while Rabbi Moshe Feinstein of New York emphatically wrote that it was prohibited. Yet I could not even begin to imagine that any community would have the disgusting nerve -- no, hubris -- to think they could understand the stresses that a couple in such a hellish predicament has gone through and stand in judgment after-the-fact (not \"I feel that a couple in such a situation should do otherwise\", but \"those people are evil for what they did\") and play judge, jury, hangman. (Yes there are some tightly-knit Hassidic communities where it's very much \"our way or the highway\" on a whole host of issues, but I really doubt you'd find a family in that community that would follow the grand rabbi's say-so on for whom to vote and what brand of nylons women can wear, yet on bioethical questions of life-and-death would just do their own thing.)</p>\n\n\n",

Do Jews consider people who deny the existence of God dangerous?</p>\n\n<p>The second part of the prayer which speaks about destroying those <code>\"who act as informers against Jews\"</code> also raises confusion. Why would Jews ask God to destroy \"informers\" in particular. If we assume that Jewish people do everything right then there should be nothing to inform anyone about, thus no need for the informers to be destroyed. Asking God to destroy informers seems like admitting guilt and trying to cover something up so no one will know about it.</p>\n\n<p>The part of the prayer that speaks about slander is the only logical reason in this prayer as to why one might ask God to do something as rash as to \"destroy\" someone.</p>\n\n<p>A heretic, as explained on this Wikipedia article: <a href=\"http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heretic</a></p>\n\n<p>Is someone who has ideas that are different from the ideas that a certain religious group teaches.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously everyone who is not Jewish will have ideas that are different then those of Jews. This is somewhat contradictory and hypocritical because I am sure that Jewish people have different ideas then that of other religions as well.</p>\n\n<p>Please understand that I am not posting this out of hate. I simply do not understand why we must ask God to punish those who do not agree with Judaism, it seems unnecessary and hypocritical.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>This blessing was instituted in the days of Raban Gamliel when the <strong>Jewish</strong> heretics (saducees, etc.) of the time posed a direct threat to the nation, the blessing was instituted as an anti-missionary move.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ou.org/torah/taryag/shemoneh_esrei_12\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ou.org/torah/taryag/shemoneh_esrei_12</a></p>\n\n\n",

Over the years I have tried to learn the mainstream Sefardi pronunciations (probably the way Rav Ovadia Yosef would pronounce them), but I just can't seem to get it right. Everyone I ask has different opinions. There doesn't seem to be any sort of standard.</p>\n\n<p>For example:\nIs the tzerei pronounced as eh or ay?\nIs the komatz an ah or an oh?\nWhat happens when a the tzerei follows a yud?\nIs the reish gutteral like the het and the ayin?</p>\n\n<p>I'm seeking not exact answers to the above subquestions but rather a resource for answering them and other similar questions: Is there a reliable resource I can consult to brush up on my Sefardi pronunciations?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The issue is, as you may know, that there is not one 'standard' Sephardi pronunciation. There were a variety of traditional dialects for different 'edot — Moroccan, Baghdadi, Yemenite, Persian, etc... Then there's the generalized 'Sephardi' accent of modern Israeli Hebrew (à la Ovadia Yosef) and even general Israeli Hebrew which retains some 'Sephardi' features.</p>\n\n<p>So first choose what kind of Hebrew you would like to adopt, then find something to practice! I find what works best for me is listening to recordings of people speaking or singing that I first follow along, then practice speaking with them, then I practice it on my own... Eventually I'm able to internalize the pronunciation and replicate it in other contexts.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you wanted Moroccan-style pronunciation, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/darkeabotenou\" rel=\"nofollow\">Darké Abotenou</a> has a lot of videos of Moroccan prayers and piyyutim (I learnt a beautiful Moroccan <em>sheva' berakhot</em> from one of their videos).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.piyut.org.il/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hazmana laPiyut</a>, though, is by far the most tremendous resource. You can search for a particular piyut (Deror Yiqra, for example, or Yedid Nefesh), and it will pull up a list of recordings organized by 'edah: Morocco, Tunisia, Libya, Turkey, Iraq, Yemen, etc... They are either vintage recordings of hazzanim from those countries, modern recordings of elderly immigrants from those countries, or contemporary arrangements by Israeli piyyut groups, but they are usually very faithful to each particular tradition. So listening to the Yemenite piyyut recordings will definitely be the best place to hear authentic Yemenite pronunciation.</p>\n\n<p>Hope that helps!

Therefore, Hashem had to redeem them immediately. And because they did not complete the number of years which they were supposed to be subjugated to Egypt, they now had to be suffer further subjugation to the four kingdoms of Bavel (Babylon), Modai (Media and Persia), Yavan (Greece) and Edom (Rome). And the subjugation to Bavel was started by the destruction of the first temple, and to Rome by the destruction of the second temple.</p>\n\n<p>Now, the reason why they lasted 210 years before descending to the 49th level of impurity was because the 22 years of suffering that the brothers of Yosef had experienced since they had sold Yosef served as a merit to protect Yisrael from falling too far during their years in Egypt. And if this period of suffering would have lasted longer, then Yisrael would have had enough ancestral merit to protect them for the full 400 years.</p>\n\n<p>But Yosef knew that the time had come to reveal himself to his brothers and to end their suffering. Thus, he knew that as a result there was insufficient merit to fully protect Yisrael, and therefore they would to have to suffer further exiles which included the destruction of the two temples.</p>\n\n<p>Hence, since only at that precise moment was the destruction of the temples now destined to happen, Yosef cried for them at that time.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is the Rambam so famous?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone were to take a survey asking people to list Jewish 'Sages' I would venture to guess that the Rambam (Maimonides) would top that list. Even within the Jewish (religious) world there seems to be a disproportionate amount of shiurim, biographies and overall interest in who the Rambam was and what he held, more so than any other Rishon (even this site has a Rambam tag, and although it also has a Rashi tag I think there are no other tags for other Rishonim). My question is why all the interest n the Rambam specifically?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To understand Rambam's fame, we must first understand the context of which he lived. He was one of the first rishonim, following from the end of the geonim and their period. The academic highlight of Babylonia had died out and the Jews were quickly starting to leave the Iberian peninsula as the Christian rulers made their way into the area. I'd argue that Judaism had a mini crisis during this time period because academia was misplaced once again and the guidance started to disappear. </p>\n\n<p>I can go on about Rambam's philosophical triumphs with his <a href=\"http://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>The Guide for the Perplexed</em></a> and his success as a physician; however, his most important contribution had to be his <em><a href=\"http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudMap/Maimonides.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mishneh Torah</a></em>. Now the reason why the MT was such a revolutionary work and why it granted Rambam such fame is because of the mission it had. Until then, practical halacha was very difficult to derive. In order to know the halacha, an individual had to most likely had to either sift through the complicated Gemara, the commentary on the Mishnah, or follow a rabbi's instructions, who in return had to sift through the Gemara and its many commentaries. If Judaism was to maintain its consistency across the Nation of Israel and its many communities, there needed to be a work that compiled all the Laws of the Covenant into a simple, easy to understand set of books that explained what the law is for the Jews. This is similar to the Mishnah, <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/talmud_&_mishna.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">because Yehudah HaNasi wrote and compiled the Oral Law down into his work in order to make sure that Jews did not lose the law in the process of the chaos that ensued after the falling of the Second Temple.</a> The Mishneh Torah plainly listed every single halacha (even those that do not apply anymore) and gave an extensive explanation of it all.</p>\n\n<p>Not only did it compile the halacha, but it did so in a way that avoided personal interpretation. <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/901656/jewish/Introduction-to-Mishneh-Torah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rather, instead he worked his compilation of the halachot off of a mesorah presented in the Babylonian Talmud</a>. This was revolutionary for its time and would inspire other gedolim afterwards to compile their own works on halacha. Imagine, now one would not need to be a master on the Talmud to know the halacha. Anyone Jew could now learn the halacha that he is obligated to keep, especially since it was written in Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>This is why Rambam is so famous. He created a revolutionary work, that simplified halacha and made it practical for the masses. He used the mesorah as presented in Gemara as the basis for his work and wrote it in Hebrew so that all Jews could learn from it. Rambam was the Yehudah HaNasi of his day. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I remember Rabbi Berel Wein shlit\"a saying that if the Rambam had written any one of his Peirush Hamishnah, Mishneh Torah, Moreh Nevuchim - he would have been one of the great sages of our history. Each of them revolutionized its area of the Torah, and is from the most important resources even today. That he wrote all three is beyond belief.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>I think it is because Rambam was a big rationalist and probably because Maimonides was a great thinker, perhaps Judaism's greatest thinker in the league of greatest Jewish geniuses such as Albert Einstein. Just as Einstein is the renowned authority of science, so, too, Rambam is considered the most authoritative of Halakhah (Mishneh Torah) and rational thought (Guide).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Effects of Paternity Fraud on Husband\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A Jewish woman had an affair before her marriage. She later married another man. At her wedding she was pregnant from the previous liaison but it was not noticeable. When the baby was born, the husband assumed it was his own child. A few years later, he found out through a DNA test that the child was not his. </p>\n\n<p>Can he now divorce his wife on the grounds of what happened before the marriage?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The whole virginity thing is mostly a red herring.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud actually says a woman is supposed to wait a few months between marriages, so we won't have these paternity confusions!</p>\n\n<p>The whole marriage could be considered \"an act under severely faulty premises\" and therefore null and void (theoretically, no divorce ceremony is needed but we'd strive to obtain one anyhow for appearance's sake) from the get-go if one side had some condition that any reasonable Jewish person would consider a deal-breaker. (E.g. s/he presented themselves as Jewish-born and Jewish-identifying, but actually had secretly gone off and gotten baptized and has been going to church for the last six months.) As we'd said about about the waiting a few months, plenty of men seem to have been okay marrying a woman who was openly carrying an ex-husband's child, but fooling someone about carrying another man's child could likely be called a dealbreaker.</p>\n\n<p>As for \"grounds for divorce\" -- look, if a couple comes to the rabbi and says that everything is going fine, but they want a divorce because they're bored and they feel like it, the rabbi should advise them to reconsider, but at the end of the day there's nothing stopping them from going through a divorce ceremony. (Usually it would be their local pastoral rabbi doing the counseling; divorces are handled by specialist rabbis whose job is generally to just process what they're given.) The financial settlement, however, comes into play. In Talmudic times the rule of thumb was that he always gave her a lump sum of one year's support (the <em>ketubah</em>) unless it was considered \"her fault\"; and the cases in the Talmud's book of <em>Ketubot</em> make it fairly clear that her hiding something big coming into the marriage could qualify.  </p>\n\n<p>Practically, a pastoral rabbi should first assess the relationship and all involved, the healthiest thing may be for them to try and work it out. But if they both want to call it off, the rabbis would certainly process their ritual divorce. <em>After</em> the ritual divorce, the couple is supposed to let a rabbinic panel handle the financial settlement, and I suspect it would quite strongly favor the husband in such a case. (If the couple would rather give all their money to the lawyers and spend years being dragged through mud and go to the courts instead, they're not supposed to do so but the divorce rabbis can't/won't stop them.) If the husband demands a divorce but she wants to stay, the rabbis would likely -- depending on the details of the circumstances -- make every effort to convince her to go through with the divorce ritual, and if that still fails, leave a divorce document in escrow for her.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# I am not Jewish but would like to visit a MO synagogue to pray occasionally on Shabbat. What is the best course?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have studied Judaism for five years privately but also with the assistance of friends.  There isn't a shul in the city where I live so most Shabbats I pray at home.  Occasionally I have driven into a near by city about 35 minutes away to pray at a Conservative Synagogue.  I would like to visit a Modern Orthodox synagogue and perhaps pray there regularly when I can go.  What is the best course of action when visiting a MO shul?  Naturally people have questions when a new person shows up out of no where; I am not Jewish, I would have to drive, etc.  Should I contact the Rabbi first to explain?  Would it go over well to just show up? If it matters, I am a man.</p>\n\n<p>I'll go ahead and answer some obvious questions up front.  To be clear, I realize I am not Jewish, and I do not have delusions that I am a member.  Simply put I wish to join alongside Israel and worship the one Creator and G-d of all, if I could meet a few nice people along the way who are willing to tolerate my presence that would be great as well. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 20)\n\n<p>I'm not <em>widely</em> traveled, but I've been to a bunch of different synagogues of all the major flavors, often as one-offs, including C and MO, so I'm answering on the basis of that experience.</p>\n\n<h2>First visit</h2>\n\n<p>You can just show up.</p>\n\n<p>Many of the factors that affect you are the same between Conservative and Modern Orthodox synagogues.  The Conservative synagogue you've been going to might or might not be egalitarian, which would make more of a difference if you were a woman.</p>\n\n<p>In either, as a man you would count for the minyan if you were Jewish, so take a look around when you get there.  If there are more than about a dozen men you probably don't need to worry (I'm fudging that number because, hey, you might not be the only non-Jew there).  If the number is close, look around for the gabbai, the person who seems to be coordinating logistics like handing out aliyot, and tell him you don't count.  Since you're new he may approach you first; if he offers you any honor, like an aliyah, decline.  If he inquires, just tell him you aren't Jewish and that will take care of it.  Optionally you can also tell him that you've been going to such-and-such Conservative shul (if it's near enough that people would know it), which tells him that you aren't a complete newbie (you don't need to have the service explained to you).</p>\n\n<p>At the kiddush, if wine has been put out for everybody it will probably be in individual cups.  If so you can freely take one.  If there's a bottle and people are pouring their own, you should skip it or wait to be offered a filled cup.  It's <em>probably</em> mevushal, meaning that being touched by a gentile won't be a problem, but you never know.  There are wines that can be made ritually invalid if handled by gentiles.  (Sorry about that.)</p>\n\n<p>In my experience any newcomer at any type of synagogue gets asked \"new in town?\" or the like.  You can say you're just visiting; you might be asked who you're visiting as people try to play \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_geography\">Jewish geography</a>\".  You can say you're shul shopping (if you are).  Most people won't want to know details of your personal status.</p>\n\n<p>When mingling with people (like at the kiddush), don't offer handshakes to women.  More generally, take your social cues from the other men there.</p>\n\n<p>As a non-Jew you are not forbidden to drive on Shabbat, but it will be less awkward for you if you park a block or so away instead of right in front of the building.</p>\n\n<h2>Recurring visits</h2>\n\n<p>If you decide to go to this synagogue on a regular basis, it's a good idea to talk with the rabbi.  (Call during the week and make an appointment; don't try to do it at the kiddush.)  Explain your intentions (I can't tell if you're considering conversion, for example) and ask him if he has any problem with you coming there.  Not only is this polite -- if you're going to join a community it's good to introduce yourself -- but he may be able to connect you with others, e.g. for meals.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Regarding driving to Shul on Shabbos: Do it. Every time.</p>\n\n<p>Not only are you not required to keep Shabbos, because you are not Jewish, but you are also forbidden to keep Shabbos, for the same reason.</p>\n\n<p>Also, keep in mind that unlike most Conservative temples, most Orthodox shuls have services every day of the week.  If you really want to get a feel for things, go every day.</p>\n\n<p>If you do go during the week, you will notice people putting on Tefillin. Some might even offer to let you use theirs. You should decline, and optionally explain that you're not Jewish.</p>\n\n<p>Hope this helps.</p>\n\n\n",

What sort of being nullified or canceled (I guess, since those are its usual meanings) is this? What does בטל mean here?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The best translation in the context here is:</p>\n\n<p>A)...and is nullified (loses its identity) with respect to a public domain or a private domain, and so transfer between the public or private domain is permitted.</p>\n\n<p>B)...and is nullified even with respect to a public domain.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Great question! There are a number of places where Rashi uses terminology like this in <em>Maseches Eiruvin</em>. Before bringing those examples and explaining them, it's important to realize that there is more than one type of ביטול.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bitul b'rov (ביטול ברוב): in which something is insignificant when <em>compared to something else</em>. This is what we refer to when discussing a drop of milk falling into meat, or any other תערובת. If you had a drop of milk in a cup, you would be unable to ignore it, since it obviously exists. It's only when it's thrown into a clash with a contrasting substance that you say it's insignificant.</li>\n<li>Bitul b'miut (בטל במיעוטו): in which something is <em>inherently insignificant</em>. Examples of this are things like the minority opinion in the Sanhedrin, the <50% of <em>shechita</em> once most of the <em>shechita</em> is done, and the like. It's not a matter of comparison - it's just that all you need is 51% of <em>shechita</em>, and everything else is irrelevant.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See also חידושי רב חיים הלוי על הגמרא, on Bava Kama 27b.</p>\n<p>This is what Rashi says in Eiruvin 33a</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקום פטור הוא. דכל פחות מרוחב ד' קי\"ל ביציאות השבת דלא הוי רשות בפני עצמו <strong>ובטל אצל רה\"ר ואצל רה\"י אם עומד ביניהן</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, on 9a Rashi again says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מקום שאין בו ד' על ד'. עומד בין רשות הרבים לרשות היחיד הואיל <strong>וליכא מקום חשוב לאו רשות באנפי נפשיה הוא ובטיל להכא ולהכא והיינו מקום פטור</strong>: ... מצא. כרמלית שבין לחיים שלא היה בו שיעור כרמלית: את מינו. שחוצה לו: וניעור. נתחזק על ידי מינו <strong>וניעור משנתו שהיה בתחלה בטל אצל שאינו מינו</strong> ודוגמתו בבכורות (ד' כב.) טומאה שבטלה וחזרה וניעורה: אבל פתוח לרשות הרבים. <strong>שלא זה מינו ולא זה מינו ולכאן וכאן בטלה:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note also that in this case, the Gemara itself treats the מקום פטור as if it's בטל until it \"finds itself\" near a כרמלית.</p>\n<p>See also Eiruvin 77a Rashi s.v. מעלין, and 88a Rashi s.v. התם רשויות דאורייתא.</p>\n<p>In essence, Rashi says that since a מקום פטור cannot be defined as a \"מקום\" in any sense, removing an item to it, or from it, cannot be called \"moving it to a new place\". If you move an item from רשות היחיד to מקום פטור, it's not a new place, since it's insignificant. Same for רשות הרבים to מקום פטור. I think this is Rashi's consistent opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

They tell us in other agadot, that the Torah is written in the language of man, and thus we can presume, that not every letter of the Torah is imbued with special meaning.   However, these two principles, though sometimes in conflict, should influence the way we read and study Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So, when it appears obvious to us that a certain section of the Torah appears to be redundant, or 'useless' to the modern reader it is a good opportunity to pay closer attention to what is written in that section of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>Here, in regards to the census, is a careful analysis of the numbers.</p>\n\n<p>While, I can not explain the significance of every detail to be learned, I will point out the areas of the text which should lead one to further study.</p>\n\n<p>A few things stand out here. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Most of the numbers are rounded off to the nearest 100, however in one tribe , the number is rounded off to 50 (gad in bamidbar), or 30 (Reuven in Pinchas). Where the numbers rounded off? Why?</li>\n<li>The numbers in the census, take a few months apart are exactly the same. How can this be? Didn't some people have a birthday?</li>\n<li>The numbers of First born males, within the population given of the census, and the number of Leviim given within the census, do not match up to logic. How could there be 1 first born for every 30 males?</li>\n<li>All of the summations of numbers are accurate, except for one. The Leviim.  The Torah tells us there were 22,000 total, but doing the math by hand reveals 22,300 total.  Why did the Torah give the wrong sum? Why does the Torah give us a total, when earlier it says not to count the Leviim?</li>\n<li>Why do the Levvim get counted differently than all the other tribes? And why is their number, despite having a larger range of ages to count, so much smaller?</li>\n<li>Why do most of the tribes keep the same number of people from census to census, but a few tribes, Shimon, Manesahe, and Ephraim to be exact, have such large differences?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regardless of the details to the answers to all those questions, I would posit 3 things.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>The numbers in the Torah are not \"trivial facts\".  In reality, they may not be \"facts\" at all.  By comparing the Torah to logic and life as we know it, as well as comparing one part of the Torah to another part of the Torah, insights are derived.  In addition, the Torah is not trying to give us pure historical facts, but rather is giving us a \"general feeling\" for what we need to know. Because of precision in one area, but not others, the Torah makes clear to us, that precision is not always the most important part of what we are being told.</li>\n<li>The Torah can not be understood, pasuk by pasuk.  The Torah needs to be read and understood by looking at all parts of the Torah together.  If you only read pasuk by pasuk, you will miss crucial lessons in the Torah.  In this case, the crucial lesson seems to be, the non-precise nature of the numbers in what otherwise sounds like a \"historical account\"</li>\n<li>The Numbers the Torah provides us with are important, and not coincidence.  Meaning, we can learn from the values themselves.  If the Torah was being 100% accurate regarding the numbers, and was just giving us over pure, trivial facts, then we would not know to learn from these details.  However, since the details are obviously not precise, we know, and perhaps are even forced, to learn insights from the specific numbers.  Why 603,550/601,730 and not 600,00 as the Torah reports in Beshlach?   (The Baal Haturim does a reverse gematria with the numbers, and says that the number tells us that each and every member of Israel, every single one of them, was counted in the census. \"bene yisra'el kol rosh\" )  Because of this, we can also ask, why are some tribes so much larger than others? What is the Torah trying to tell us?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The amount of Torah lessons we can gain from the Census, in multiple places in the Torah is immense, and to answer every lesson we gain would be beyond the scope of this question.</p>\n\n\n",

In other words,\n  baby showers in the mid-twentieth century not only served an economic\n  function by providing the mother-to-be and her home with material\n  goods that lessened the financial burden of infant care, but purchased\n  “things” also emerged as the principle whereby women make themselves\n  into mothers. The commodities associated with pregnancy and birth\n  served to construct the identity of the fetus as a social being (and\n  often become treasured objects of many women who lose their baby).\n  Rituals of the modern baby shower include “showering” the mother-to-be\n  with presents, making shopping trips organized around the baby-to-be,\n  establishing a playful atmosphere at the shower, and placing the\n  mother-to-be on a chair for her to sit on as she opens her gifts and\n  passes them around for her guests to view (Clarke 2004).</p>\n  \n  <p>The shower, in many senses, serves to indoctrinate the woman into the\n  special behaviors associated with her new role in society.\n  Paradoxically, though, the cute games played at the shower tend to\n  infantilize the woman and return her to innocence--and the central\n  chair, often decorated, also gestures toward a symbolic return to the\n  virginal, nonsexual state associated with Mother Mary, Queen of the\n  World. The modern baby shower, then, supports the themes regarding the\n  woman’s transition to a more dependent, but pure state while also\n  creating and reinforcing the personal relationships which form the\n  community (Crouch and Manderson 1993).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, Jewish custom has evolved, so that preparations for a baby are not made until 40 days after conception.  This is when the soul traditionally enters the fetus.  The main concern is the \"evil eye\", and for some good reason.</p>\n\n<p>From our very early beginings, the Jewish people have had a hard time giving birth.  All of our Matriarchs were barren, and from what I have heard, Jews tend to have a higher than 30% rate of miscarriage that is normally quoted as the norm.</p>\n\n<p>As can be seen from the history of Baby Showers, it's also not a very Jewish value.  It would be interesting to learn why the Baby Shower in European and American society moved from being the day after the birth, to sometime before the birth.  I suspect it has to do with an increase in medical technology to deal with premature babies.</p>\n\n\n",

I'll present a few here. In this case, though, I believe that the answers are not necessarily mutually exclusive: at the end of the day, everyone would agree to some extent that all of the following are noble motivations. As the Ben Ish Hai says in the beginning of Parshas Naso (2nd year), the one who learns \"lishmah\" has his heart directed towards Heaven.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>To study Torah merely because it was a command</strong> may be the simplest understanding of \"Torah Lishmah\". This is indicated by the Gemara Sotah 22b and Rashi and Tosfos' commentary there. See Maharsha to Nedarim 62 where he states that the highest form of learning is that which is done \"to fulfill the mitzvah, out of love for the one who gave the command\". See below (third paragraph)</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Learning for the purpose of knowing how to observe the mitzvos</strong> appears to me in my (admittedly limited) studies to be the opinion that appears to have the most support. One can bring support for this idea from the Gemara Berachos 17a, which states that the purpose of wisdom is תשובה ומעשים טובים, repentance and good deeds, and the Maharsha there assumes that this is referring to Torah wisdom as its being learned לשמה. Without being explicit, this is also indicated by the Yerushalmi there (Berachos 1:2, especially when compared with Kallah Rabasi 5:1) and the Sifra on the first verse in Bechukosai. Such a definition is assumed by Tosfos to Pesachim 50b and probably the Rosh there as well. This is also how the Tosfos Yom Tov explains the Mishnah in Avos 4:5 as well as the position of the Kesef Mishna (to Hil. Talmud Torah 3:10) and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/43691/the-vilna-gaons-definition-of-torah-lishmah/43696#43696\">appears to be the opinion</a> of the Vilna Gaon (tikkunei zohar vilna ed. pg 4). Another source is the Radak to Yirmiyahu 2:8</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Studying Torah for the sake of better knowing or loving God</strong> is unquestionably a good thing. This appears to be the definition of the Meiri to Pesachim 50b who indicates that the only 'lishmah' is for the sake of the love of God. Similarly, the Baal HaTanya writes in Likutei Amarim ch. 5 that learning \"lishmah\" means for the sake of attaching one's soul to Hashem. </p>\n\n<p>The Rambam has a similar understanding, in that he believes that true learning \"lishmah\", like all mitzvos (see intro to Perek Cheilek), is doing so with no ulterior motive whatsoever, but is done an expression of love of God (Hilchos Teshuvah 10:1, Commentary to Makkos 3:16)</p></li>\n<li><p>Nefesh Hachayim (4:3) says that <strong>studying for the love of learning, to increase one's knowledge and discover the intellectual depth of the Torah</strong> is the highest goal of learning \"lishmah\".

This may not contradict the opinion of the Rambam, who besides for stating that learning should be done out of love of God, one should also do/study \"what's true simply because it's true\". Additionally, the son of the Rambam writes in a teshuvah (no. 82) that those who learn Torah lishma are those who do so \"to find the truth\".</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Torah L'shma is learning Torah for the sake of learning torah, to learn the Truth. And not, in contrast, to learning Torah in order to be exalted above creation, or to become like a powerful river, or in order to have all the secrets revealed. ;)</p>\n\n<p>The irony is lost on many.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe in Hilchos Talmud Torah (<a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/sh/sh5/6/4/3.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">4:3</a>) defines Lishma as learning LeShem Shamayim - for the sake of heaven. In other words, to do what G-d wants, and not to receive a reward in this world or the next, or because of fear of punishment in this world or the next. Certainly not to be a \"Gadol\" or any other such intention to use the Torah, or to win arguments, etc. He goes on there to elaborate that Lishma includes learning in order to keep and do Mitzvos properly.</p>\n\n<p>That definition is most significant in its negative - it defines that all these other reasons that would not be lishma, leaving Torah study just because it is a Mitzvah as the Lishma. This is the Halachic definition of Lishma (according to the Alter Rebbe).</p>\n\n<p>In Tanya, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7884/jewish/Chapter-5.htm#footnoteRef4a7884\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chapter 5</a> describes the Kabbalistic definition of Lishma as understanding Torah according to one's ability in order to connect his soul to G-d through that understanding. So learning Torah Lishma is then learning in order to be more of a G-dly person.</p>\n\n<p>In Likkutei Torah (Shlach p. 47:3) the Alter Rebbe speaks of an even higher level in Torah Lishma, which is \"for the sake of the Torah itself\" to reveal G-d in the Torah above.</p>\n\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe (as summarized in the sefer ביאורים לפרקי אבות) explains that Pirkei Avos is about matters of piousness, above the letter of the law, but in this Braisa it is speaking about \"<strong>All</strong> who learn Torah Lishma\" thus this Braisa is about being Osek - working hard - in Torah for Torah's own sake, not for what he gets out of it in terms of knowing Halacha or in terms of his connection to Hashem, but not necessarily as high an appreciation as what it speaks of in Likkutei Torah.</p>\n\n<p>The only reward he gets is the connection with G-d through Torah. But this leaves a person to wonder what will be with his service of G-d if he is absorbed in learning. The answer is the things listed in the Braisa - he becomes worthy and gains the ability to more easily earn the things listed in the Mishna. Some still require additional effort directed towards them (like things where it says מכשרתו להיות) but less effort, and others come automatically (those things which have to do with wordly matters), and others are part and parcel of the effort in learning, such as being revealed the secrets of the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>So in other words, the point of the Braysa is that by learning Torah Lishma, Hashem makes other matters easier or just takes care of them automatically, leaving one free to focus on learning.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Allowing unmarried/homosexual couples into a hotel\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Recently there has been a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-25119158\">high profile case in the UK</a> concerning a religious christian couple who own a hotel. Due to their personal religious beliefs their policy was to refuse a room to couples who were not married. They refused a 'married' homosexual couple a room on the grounds that they were not of the same 'orientation', which went against their religious values. They said that it would feel wrong to allow it and that they would feel more trepidation answering to God than the justice system.</p>\n\n<p>According to halacha would you be considered an 'accomplice' to the aveirot that are committed under your premises (be it unmarried or homosexual couples who are 'looking to hire a room')? Or would it be permitted to rent out a room to anyone i.e. once hired out it is no longer any of your business or jurisdiction and you cannot be held accountable?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Our sources discussed this concept long ago. See Shulchan Aruch Yoreh Deah 151:1, e.g. the Talmud discussed whether I may sell frankincense to pagans knowing that they will use it for idolatrous worship.</p>\n\n<p>There is a key distinction between <em>enabling</em> a sin (i.e. it would be impossible or incredibly difficult for the sinner to sin without you, or you are actively enticing or misleading them into the sin) -- which is a very serious problem (and would come up, potentially, for a same-sex couple of any religion, or an unmarried Jewish couple); vs. simply <em>assisting</em> a sin (i.e. they could sin with or without you).</p>\n\n<p>In virtually all cases that come up today, these are questions of <em>assisting</em> rather than <em>enabling</em>. Do I really think this couple will sin any less if I refuse them the room? Generally, for non-Jews or non-observant Jews, we say it's best to avoid assisting if reasonably possible, but the letter of the law is that it's permissible. (I.e. you shouldn't get yourself sued over it.) </p>\n\n<p>We could even debate whether furnishing a room is called \"assisting\" a sin -- Rabbi Moshe Feinstein writes that one is allowed to rent an apartment to someone who will violate the Sabbath within it. \"Assistance\" only pertains to the act of the sin directly (e.g. the caterer who rents out his hall to Jews on a day that we're not allowed to have weddings).</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Michael Broyde has observed that evangelical Christians don't accept this distinction of assisting vs. enabling; we have a very old, nuanced, and profound religion, and we do.</p>\n\n\n",

At that point, Adam and Eve began to die and would return to dust.

    "content": "# The Abolition of Vidui Ma'aser\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0526.htm#12\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deuteronomy 26:12-15</a> details a confession that must be recited on the final yontef of Pesach, both on the fourth and on the seventh years of the agricultural cycle, at such a time as there is a temple in Jerusalem. The nature of the confession is detailed in the Mishna, Ma'aser Sheni 5:10-14, where various stipulations are enumerated, the absence of any of which renders one unable to make the necessary declaration. One of these stipulations is that one has given one's first tithe to the levites.</p>\n\n<p>The mitzva of reciting the Vidui Ma'aser (the \"confession of the tithe\", as it is known) is found as a positive mitzvah in Rambam's Sefer haMitzvot #131, as well as in Sefer haChinukh #607. In Sefer haChinukh, the author concludes by noting, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועובר על זה ולא התודה וידוי זה של מעשרות בזמנו בזמן הבית ביטל עשה זה</p>\n  \n  <p>Whoever transgresses this and does not make this confession over\n  tithes in its time, at such a time as there is a temple, nullifies\n  this positive mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That said, both Ma'aser Sheni 5:15 and Sotah 9:10 record the tradition that Yochanan Kohen Gadol abolished this practice altogether! The phrase in question merely reads that יוחנן כהן גדול העביר הודית המעשר (Yochanan Kohen Gadol abolished the confession [lit. the thanksgiving] of the tithe), but fails to provide a reason. The gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=14&daf=86b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yevamot 86b</a> explains this tradition as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>מפני מה קנסו לוים במעשר פליגי בה רבי יונתן וסביא חד אמר שלא עלו בימי\n  עזרא וח\"א כדי שיסמכו כהנים עליו בימי טומאתן</p>\n  \n  <p>Why were the levites fined as regards [their] tithe? Rabbi Yonatan and\n  the elders disagreed. One said that it was because they didn't ascend\n  [ie: return] with Ezra and one said [that it wasn't a fine, but in\n  order] that the kohanim could rely upon it [ie: have something to eat]\n  during the days of their impurity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Rashi (s.v. מפני מה), this question presupposes that the levites in the days of Yochanan Kohen Gadol were not being given their tithe - either as the result of a fine instituted by Ezra or as a measure designed to ensure that the kohanim always have something to eat. Once we appreciate that the levites were not being given their tithe in the time of Yochanan Kohen Gadol, we can understand why he needed to abolish the Vidui Ma'aser. As the Bartenura explains:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לפי שעזרא קנס את הלוים שלא יתנו להם מעשר, כשעלה מן הגולה ובני לוי לא\n  עלו עמו, וצוה שיתנו המעשר לכהנים. ויוחנן כהן גדול בטל הוידוי, כיון\n  שאינו יכול לומר וגם נתתיו ללוי</p>\n  \n  <p>Ezra fined the levites that one should not give them [their]\n  tithe, since he ascended from the diaspora and the levites did not go\n  up with him, so he commanded that one should give the tithe to kohanim\n  [instead]. So Yochanan Kohen Gadol nullified the confession, since one\n  is no longer able to say, \"And I gave it to the levite\" (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0526.htm#13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Deuteronomy 26:13</a>).</p>\n  \n  <p>-\n  Bartenura, Ma'aser Sheni 5:15, s.v. העביר (≈ Sotah 9:10, s.v. הודיית מעשר)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Consider as well what the Rambam writes in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/7401.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Hilkhot Ma'aser 1:4</a>. The relevant part reads as follows:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועזרא קנס את הליום בזמנו שלא יתנו להן מעשר ראשון אלא ינתן לכהנים לפי\n  שלא עלו עמו לירושלם</p>\n  \n  <p>Ezra fined the levites of his day, that one should not give them the\n  first tithe, but rather give it to the kohanim, since they [the\n  levites] did not ascend with him to Jerusalem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here, the Rambam only says that Ezra fined the levites \"of his day\" (בזמנו). One of the earliest manuscripts of the Mishne Torah, MS Kaufmann A77 (produced in Northern France, 1296), omits the word בזמנו - thus possibly testifying to the opinion that Ezra had instituted this punishment for all time and not just for his own. This alternative nusach can be found in the ילקוט שנויי נוסחאות appended to the Fraenkel edition of the Mishne Torah. In the actual manuscript, it is to be found in fol. II.142v, and can be viewed <a href=\"http://kaufmann.mtak.hu/en/ms77-large/ms77-142v-large.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> in the ninth line of the leftmost column.</p>\n\n<p>This all raises two questions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>If Ezra's enactment remained in effect until the time of Yochanan Kohen Gadol, then why was it necessary for him to also enact legislation that enabled people to purchase produce from somebody suspected of <em>not</em> giving tithes to levites (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=18&daf=48&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sotah 48a</a>)? If Ezra's enactment did not remain in effect until the time of Yochanan Kohen Gadol, how can it be used as a reason (as per Rashi and the Bartenura) for his abolishing the Vidui Ma'aser?</p></li>\n<li><p>If Ezra's enactment remained in effect until the time of Yochanan Kohen Gadol, then what was it that gave Ezra the right to do something that would lead to abolishing an explicit Torah mitzvah? A prophet is allowed to encourage people to <strong>temporarily</strong> violate a Torah mitzvah, but if he has them violate it perpetually he is liable to death by strangulation (cf: Rambam, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1109.htm#3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yesodei haTorah 9:3</a>).</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The sefer <a href=\"http://download.hebrewbooks.org/downloadhandler.ashx?req=21937\" rel=\"nofollow\">Tal Oros Vol. 3, Chapter 18</a> discusses this issue in great detail, and the following is a summary of his main points:</p>\n\n<p>The Kesef Mishnah comments on the Rambam that the fine that Ezra instituted \"in his time\" was not to give the Ma'aser Rishon to the Levi'im at all, only to the Kohanim. But in the generations after Ezra they instituted that it could be given to either Kohanim or Levi'im, making the fine more lenient but not abolishing it completely. He further comments that even when they were allowed to give it also to the Levi'im, this was still considered not keeping the law of the Torah, because the law of Torah is that it must be given <strong>only</strong> to Levi'im.</p>\n\n<p>On this explanation of the Kesef Mishnah the Tal Oros asks in amazement: How could it be that only in the time of Yochanan Kohen Gadol, a period of several hundred years from the time of Ezra, did they abolish the saying of the Vidui Ma'aser, even though they were not able to recite it already from the time of Ezra?!</p>\n\n<p>He answers that the return to Eretz Yisrael at the time of Ezra was incredibly difficult for a number of reasons, and so although the Levi'im were wrong in not returning when Ezra called for them to do so, nevertheless, he judged them favorably that only due to the tremendous difficulties did they refuse to return, but later they would do so. Therefore, he instituted the fine only \"בזמנו\" - temporarily. And the when they Levi'im did not return in the ensuing generations they extended the fine, albeit more leniently, but still as a temporary measure with the hope that when the hardships decreased the Levi'im would return. Therefore, they did not abolish the Vidui Ma'aser during this time since they expected that the fine to be rescinded at a later date.</p>\n\n<p>However, after many generations the situation in Eretz Yisrael changed drastically and the Jews began to flourish there and no longer suffered the original hardships, and so Jews from abroad began to return in their tens of thousands. Yet still most of the Levi'im refused to return. When Yochanan Kohen Gadol and his Beis Din saw this they realized that there was no longer any reason to judge the Levi'im favorably, and decided that the fine against them should be made permanent. And therefore the time had also come to officially abolish the saying of the Vidui Ma'aser.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is Hashem 'involved' in everything that happens?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The view in current Haredi thought seems to be that Hashem actively runs the world down to the most minute occurrences. I have seen discussions allude to the fact that there are many Rishonim who did not hold of this view. I would like to know which Rishonim did not hold of universal personal providence over every event? </p>\n\n<p>(I know that when discussing such a topic as this the words used must be carefully weighed since the ideas are extremely nuanced and sensitive. Nevertheless, I worded my question in the most general way possible in an attempt to get my point across and not to be precise about the ideas themselves).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p><em><strong>First, some background information</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>The way in which the Creator runs the world is termed in classical Jewish sources as <em>hashgaha</em> (השגחה) which means \"supervision.\" The concept of \"supervision\" is subdivided into the categories of <em>hashgahah p'rattith</em> (השגחה פרטית), \"direct (or, specific) supervision,\" and <em>hashgahah k'lalith</em> (השגחה כללית), \"indirect (or, general) supervision.\" The former being a direct intervention by HaShem into the events of the world, and the latter being that HaShem has pre-programmed the world - and its various components - to function a certain way and thus they continue in their created path. </p>\n\n<p>It is important to understand that <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em> does not indicate \"[something] within God's control/knowledge/domain\" and <em>hashgaha k'lalith</em> does not indicate \"[something] outside of God's control/knowlege/domain\" (has wa-shalom). Rather, the entire world is under HaShem's <em>hashgaha</em> - some things being directly effected and/or managed and others being effected and/or managed indirectly, or it is possible to say \"actively\" and \"passively.\" However, these are terms used by us in order to facilitate understanding and cannot in their fullness apply to the One Transcendent Creator.</p>\n\n<p>Some common examples of <em>hashgaha k'lalith</em> would be leaves falling from trees, spiders catching flies, bigger fish eating smaller fish, et al. While the Creator is aware of these events and designed the nature inherent in each of them, He does not actively determine which leaf will fall or where it will land, which fly will be caught by which spider, or which fish will be swallowed by another. These are natural events that are a part of the world which He has designed to function in this way. Inherent also in <em>hashgaha k'lalith</em> is the idea of \"chance\" - which is essentially nature taking its course with the scientific variables being too far beyond conscious human perception for us to know with certainty what will happen next. This concept is expressed by Hazal where it states: \"<em>Olam k'minhagho nohegh - the world continues on it's natural course</em>\" (b. Avodha Zara 54b).</p>\n\n<p>The cognate to this is when the Creator specifically intervenes in the lives of certain humans, \"bending\" the course of the natural world to accommodate them in various ways according to His will. The condition for this type of <em>hashgaha</em> is that the individual draw close to HaShem's will in thought, word, and deed. To the extent that a person trusts in and aligns himself with the Creator at any given moment, he is able to \"draw\" - as it were - the Creator's specific supervising influence into the events of his life. A common example of this is the life of <em>Yosef haSsadiq</em> in the <em>Tora</em>.</p>\n\n<p>The writings on these concepts are vast and intricate, but this should suffice as an introduction which will enable you to understand the following answer.</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>Now, to answer your question</em></strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Most <em>Rishonim</em> - if not <strong>all</strong> - limit the scope of <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em> in some way. And according to the majority of those do, the world and the various creatures which it contains, are governed mainly by <em>hashgaha k'lalith</em> and that <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em> is limited in scope to human beings - specifically the righteous among the Jewish nation. This view is expressed by the <strong>Rambam</strong> (Maimonides, <em>More Nevukhim</em>, III:17-18), <strong>Ralbag</strong> (Gersonides, <em>Sefer Milhamoth HaShem</em>, IV), <strong>Rihal</strong> (cf. <em>Sefer Kuzari</em> 1:109), <strong>Ramban</strong> (Nahmanides, <em>Pirush Al HaTora</em> - <em>Shemoth</em> 13:15), and those <em>Rishonim</em>  who are essentially Maimonidean in their philosophical orientation (i.e. <strong>RaDaQ</strong>, <strong>Ibn Tibon</strong>, <strong>Sforno</strong>, <strong>Me'iri</strong>, et al). </p>\n\n<p>In fact, the <em>Sefer HaHinukh</em> (attributed to the Spanish Rishon, Rav Aharon Lewi HaBartziloni) states this limitation quite succinctly:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שיש כתות בני אדם יחשבו כי השגחת הש״י על כל ענייני העולם בין בעלי חיים או כל שאר הדברים כלומר שלא יתנועע דבר אחד קטן בעולם הזה רק בחפצו ב״ה ובגזרתו עד שיחשבו כי בנפול עלה אחד מן האילן הוא גזר עליו שיפול וא״א שיתאחר או יקדם זמן נפילתה אפי׳ רגע וזה דעת רחוק הרבה מן השכל</p>\n  \n  <p><em><strong>Translation</em></strong>: <em>\"There are sects of people who think that the hashgaha of HaShem Yithborakh is upon all matters of the world, whether animals or other things, that is to say that not even one small thing in the world moves except by His will, blessed be He, and by His decree, to the point that they think that with regard to the falling of one leaf from a tree that it is [Divinely] decreed upon it that it should fall and that it is impossible that it could have fallen either earlier or later than the [Divinely decreed] time of its falling even by a single moment. <strong>Such an understanding is very far from intelligent</strong>.\"</em> (Parashath Tazria, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46943&st=&pgnum=68\">Misswah 169</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The idea commonly espoused in the Jewish world today (expressed above as incorrect by the <em>Sefer HaHinukh</em>), namely that everything in the world and everything which happens in the world is a subject to and governed by <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em>, was virtually unknown until the preaching of the Baal Shem Tov. The adage [apparently] spoken by him varies depending on the source retelling it; at times he said to have attributed <em>hashgaha p'rattith</em> to a turning leaf, a blade of grass in the wind, or to grains of sand falling into a hole. In his estimation, the concept of <em>hashgaha k'lalith</em> either did not exist or was an illusion.\n<em>L'aniyuth da`ati</em> - in my humble opinion - such a stance is in stark contradiction to centuries, if not millenia, of consistent Tora teaching on the subject (not to mention that such a view leads inevitably to the attribution of absurdity - has wa-shalom - to the Creator, may He be blessed, and a host of other philosophical errors). Therefore, it is to be rejected (cf. Devarim 12-13).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=15875&st=&pgnum=201&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">letter</a> written in 1943, The Lubavitcher Rebbe (before he became Rebbe) discusses this issue, from the various points of view.</p>\n\n<p>The most restrictive view on the question is the Rambam, who holds that Divine Providence is limited to according to a person's connection to G-d.

However, probably at a time later than that of the Amoraim, that is, during the period of the Rabban Savorai and the Gaonim, due to the difficult yoke of their exile, their increased dispersion and increased suffering, they became physically very weak, and so the concern of having an unclean body with regard to the wearing of tefillin became a regular concern, and from then on they were not able to wear tefillin all day.</p>\n<p>However, in order not to abandon the tradition of wearing tefillin all day they made for themselves two pairs of tefillin. One pair was made according to the laws and holiness of tefillin which they wore once per day, during the morning prayers, and another they made as an amulet which were made and ordered not in accordance with halachah, and thus were not sanctified with the holiness of tefillin. These tefillin they wore all day as an amulet like the custom of the time of the gemara to make an amulet in the form of tefillin. The main difference between these two pairs of tefillin was that those which they wore for the mitzvah of tefillin they ordered the four parshas in accordance with the laws of tefillin, whereas those which they wore as an amulet they ordered the parshas not in accordance with these laws, and thus they did not have the holiness of tefillin and were merely an amulet.</p>\n<p>Therefore, when subsequently there came along a period of one or two generations during which, due to the decrees of apostasy, they were not able to wear tefillin at all, after the decrees were abolished they found that the tefillin of their forefathers consisted of two types: one type had their parshas ordered like the opinion of Rashi, and another had their parshas ordered like the opinion of Rabbeinu Tam. And they forgot which were the real tefillin and which were amulets.</p>\n<p>From this came about the dispute of the early authorities, with Rashi holding that those that were ordered according to his opinion were the genuine tefillin and the others were amulets, and Rabbeinu Tam holding the opposite. And each one supported his opinion with logical proofs, proving that only those which were ordered according to their opinion had been worn for the mitzvah of tefillin. This was the basis upon which the early authorites founded their differing opinions, and each one thought that the truth was on his side.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51450&pgnum=284\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">suggests</a> that at the biblical level, any order is kosher; at some later point there was a formal enactment of a \"right\" order, which led to this dispute.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why was the side door to the hechal unlocked so oddly?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The <em>hechal</em> (central room) of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Temple\"><em>bes hamikdash</em></a> had its main entrance on its eastern end. To either side of that entrance were cubicles, and the main-floor cubicles on each side had a door to the east also. Thus, the eastern exterior wall of the <em>hechal</em> had three entranceways visible. The northernmost of these, which entered into a cubicle, was unlocked and opened every morning before the <em>korban tamid</em> (morning sacrificial offering) could be brought. <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mishnah\">Mishnayos</a> Tamid</em> <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Tamid.3.7?lang=he-en&layout=heLeft&sidebarLang=all\">chapter 3</a> mentions that fact, and mentions, also, that door's means of opening. While commentators differ on what is meant there — the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obadiah_ben_Abraham\"><em>Rav</em></a> says (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Tamid.3.7.1?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\">ibid.</a>) that one had to reach through a hole in the wall to unlock the door from the inside, while the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Strashun\"><em>Rashash</em></a> says that one merely had to bend over to use a keyhole near the floor — it was by all accounts an awkward way to unlock a door. I haven't seen anyone, however, explain <em>why</em> that door had such an awkward means of unlocking from the outside, especially in light of the fact that the door was unlocked daily from that side. Why did it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rav (see Rav mishna 2 also) explains that there were two locks on this door,there was a lock on the inside toward the bottom of the door and one on the outside, facing the person entering. The inside lock would be opened by sticking your arm through the hole and reaching downward to insert the key and the outside lock was unlocked with another key easily. </p>\n\n<p>Why two locks, one on each side? Why specifically was there a lock also on the inside as was asked?</p>\n\n<p>I would guess that the idea is to make it as difficult as possible for someone to pick the locks and open the door without the actual key. Because even if you could pick the lock on the inside, which would be difficult on it's own and this would be one measure of security, you would have an even harder time to hold the pins of the inner lock in place while picking the lock on the outside.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam (Mishna 2) also explains that there were two keyholes, presumably on the outside, one at the natural height so a person can just reach out to insert the key and the second near the floor so that it should not be easy to unlock. This too can be explained as a method to make it quite difficult to pick the locks.</p>\n\n<p>I am understanding locks in those days did not have a key that you can turn to unlock and then remove the key with it remaining unlocked, rather the key would be inserted pushing pins allowing you to move the bolt that is locking the door. </p>\n\n<p>Similar to this link: <a href=\"https://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/hsc09b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.smith.edu/hsc/museum/ancient_inventions/hsc09b.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>I found a similar idea in this book:\n<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=OtOhypZz_pEC&pg=PA399&lpg=PA399&dq=king%20and%20stager%20locks%20and%20keys%20in%20the%20ancient%20world&source=bl&ots=k1Tkvj8oet&sig=qPe-kE_daY--8KEIcHuW6adX9Is&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi67fvw09PQAhVL0FQKHWjpAh0Q6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&q=locks%20and%20keys%20&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Google Books-Life in biblical Israel (pages 31 and 32)</a></p>\n\n\n",

The answer, unfortunately, is not quite clear to me yet. </p>\n\n<p>Dunash ben Labrat (the author of this piyyut, 10th century Moroccan educated in Baghdad) is using the Biblical text of Isaiah 63:1-3, which speaks of Botzra and Edom.</p>\n\n<p>Mahzor Vitri (11th century French liturgical manuscript) has Edom (and this is also the version on <a href=\"http://www.piyut.org.il/articles/341.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">piyut.org</a>). <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_13062_115.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Elizer Weisfish suggests</a> that Edom is the original version, but points out that in rabbinic literature Edom and Bavel are sometimes interchangeable terms for 'the enemies of Israel' in general. </p>\n\n<p>However, R. David Yitzhaqi, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_26472_108.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tzefunot 6</a>, points out that in the metre of Andalusi Hebrew poetry, <em>Edom</em> is a short-long foot (because of the <em>hataf-segol</em>), where the metre in this line calls for a long-long foot (like <em>Ba-vel</em>). In lay terms, Edom doesn't actually fit the metre of the poem but Bavel does, so it seems that Bavel is the original version. In my opinion, semantically Bavel also makes sense because of the '<em>vegam</em>' [\"and also\"] connecting the two halves, which makes more sense if the first half is Edom/Botzrah, and the second half is Bavel. Unless Dunash is punning on the name of Basra, in Iraq, in which case saying \"Botzra (i.e. Babylonia) and also Edom\" makes more sense.</p>\n\n<p>Whoever wrote this <a href=\"http://www.tapuz.co.il/forums2008/viewmsg.aspx?forumid=1086&messageid=48260867#48502579\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> noted that Iraqi Jews sing \"Edom\" and not \"Bavel\", and the version on the Iraqi <a href=\"http://area.co.il/view.php?siteid=936&jet=page&menuid=4265&postid=1163057773656285133\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Beit Knesset Eliyahu website</a> also has \"Edom\".</p>\n\n<p>So the short answer is, without going to the library, I can't seem to find a definitive answer. It seems probable (certainly possible!) to me that Bavel was the original version, as you said, and it was changed in some places to Edom. However, the opposite is also possible! The fact remains that there are variant versions, and the preference of one over the other likely has to do with censorship of some sort, whether it's Edom replacing Bavel or vice versa.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do sefardim pronounce the tzerei?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How do sefardim pronounce the tzerei?\nIs it \"eh\" as in elephant or \"ay\" as in play?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>A little phonetics background is needed to answer this question. Phoneticians usually transcribe sounds in languages using a set of symbols known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> (IPA). Phonetic transcriptions in the IPA are written in between square brackets [], so for example the word \"beds\" is transcribed in IPA as [bɛdz].</p>\n<p>As you can see from the previous example, the \"eh\" sound is written in IPA as [ɛ]. It's also useful to know that the \"y\" sound is written in IPA as [j], so for example the word \"yes\" is transcribed as [jɛs].</p>\n<p>Now what about the vowel sound in the word \"plays\"? Well, if you think about it, the shape of your mouth changes as you pronounce the \"ay\" vowel in this word -- over time, it constricts more and becomes closer to the sound [j]. However, there are languages (e.g. French) which have a vowel sound similar to \"ay\" but more \"pure\", in that the shape of the mouth doesn't change over time -- this sound is written [e] in the IPA, and you can listen to a recording of it <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6c/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. For example, the French word \"été\" is pronounced [ete] with a \"pure\" \"ay\" sound for both vowels. By contrast, the English word \"plays\" is pronounced as [plejz], where the vowel starts as an [e] vowel but shifts to a [j] over a short period of time. (This is what is known as a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">diphthong</a>.)</p>\n<p>Now, there are also languages that have a vowel that is intermediate between the vowels [ɛ] and [e]; this is sometimes written as [e̞]. For example, Modern Hebrew uses the vowel [e̞] for both tzere and segol. For more information on these three vowels, and to listen to recordings of them being pronounced, see the Wikipedia articles on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[ɛ]</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[e]</a>, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_front_unrounded_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[e̞]</a>.</p>\n<p>Two other vowel sounds that we will need to know: The vowel in the English word \"bit\" is written as [ɪ] and the vowel sound in the English word \"beet\" is written as [i], so these two words are transcribed as [bɪt] and [bit], respectively. For more information and recordings, see the Wikipedia articles on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[ɪ]</a> and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">[i]</a>.</p>\n<p>Now that we understand the phonetics behind these vowels, we can understand their realizations in Sephardic Hebrew. The following quote is from S. Morag, \"Pronunciations of Hebrew\", Encyclopaedia Judaica XII:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>ṢERE AND SEGOL</strong></p>\n<p>All the communities which follow the Sephardi pronunciation have one realization for both ṣere and segol (see above). This realization is a front higher-mid or lower-mid vowel, [e] or [ε]. In some North African communities no distinction is made between the realizations of ṣere (and segol) and that of ḥireq. This applies also, to some extent, to the Iraqi community.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Morag, both segol and tzeirei are pronounced identically in the Sephardic pronunciation, and depending on the variety of Sephardic Hebrew are both pronounced as [ɛ], [e], or [e̞]. My own speculation is that this depends on whether the local language of the area those Jews lived in used [ɛ], [e], or [e̞], and that there has been a shift to [e̞] among Sephardic Jews living in Israel due to the influence of Israeli Hebrew. Also, when Morag refers to some communities that merge tzere/segol and hiriq, I infer that the pronunciation of this merged vowel is [ɪ] or [i] – as you can hear in <a href=\"http://www.piyut.org.il/tradition/630.html?currPerformance=2447\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this recording of Adon Olam sung in Tunisian Hebrew</a>.</p>\n<p>In summary, the possible Sephardic pronunciations of tzere are  [ɛ], [e], [e̞], and [ɪ] or [i]. A caveat: These vowel sounds are not really discrete categories; rather, there is a continuum of vowel sounds stretching from [ɛ] to [i], and the separation into five categories is something of a convenient fiction.</p>\n\n\n",

Is that a general principle?  I am particularly asking about the \"once in your life\" mitzvot, not the things you do regularly so there will be plenty more opportunities later.</p>\n\n<p>Suppose a minor writes a <em>sefer torah</em> (by donating money he earned to help pay for one), and this is the only time in his life that he does so.  Or, suppose that minor fathers two children before bar mitzvah and no more.  Are these people <em>yotzei</em>?  Does an action performed before you were obligated filfill what you will later be obligated in?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogatchover_Gaon\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ragatchover</a> writes <sup>[citation needed]</sup> that a positive Mitzvah can have three aspects to it.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The obligation to do it.</li>\n<li>The continued fulfillment of it</li>\n<li>The prohibition of stopping it</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Most Mitzvos have one or two of those aspects, but Circumcision has all three, which we can see from the following examples</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Someone born circumcised has to have a drop of blood taken. This fulfills the obligation \"to do it.\"</li>\n<li>There is a Medrash which says that Dovid HaMelech was standing in the bathhouse [unclothed] and he thought to himself that he has no Mitzvos, then he remembered that he has his Bris, and this comforted him. So just having it is itself part of the Mitzvah</li>\n<li>It is forbidden to have surgery to make it cosmetically look like the circumcision never happened.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><sup>That is what I remember from the Ragatchover. The rest of this answer is my own association.</sup></p>\n\n<p>Other Mitzvos can be different. For example, with Lulav, before saying the blessing, the Esrog is left on the table or held upside down so that one does not fulfill the obligation before being able to say the blessing. Once the Lulav is held properly, the blessing can no longer be said, because it really only has the aspect #1, not #2.</p>\n\n<p>Succah, by contrast, the Halacha is that if someone forgot to say the blessing before eating a meal and remembers after he is finished, but still sitting in the Succah, he can say a blessing at that point, because Succah has aspect #2. However, it lacks aspect #3 - there is no prohibition in leaving the Succah afterwards. [The first night of Succos has #1 for sure, I don't know if the rest of the time does or not].</p>\n\n<p>With <em>p'ru ur'vu</em> it lacks #1 (in other words attempts to fulfill it more constitute a Hechser Mitzvah - preparation for a Mitzvah), therefore children conceived before Bar Mitzvah still count. As the Lubavitcher Rebbe once said, it is a Mitzvah you can choose not to do, but it is not a Mitzvah you can choose to do. With regards to a Ger, this is a Machlokes, but it could be that this a question of if the children have to be related to the person or not, rather than a question of if the Mitzvah has an aspect of #1. Arguably it also has #3, in that if someone's children cannot themselves have children or they die before having children, the Mitzvah is unfulfilled, but it is hard to make a practical example of #3 in this case. Perhaps you could bring the fact that castration is forbidden as evidence for #3 in this case.</p>\n\n\n",

How could their understanding of <em>halakha</em> be so different? Further, how could the <em>Gemara</em> and other literature be viewed so differently by them?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The disconnect I'm most familiar with is that between the Geonim and the Ashkenazi Rishonim. Since much of early Ashkenazi history is clouded, we don't have any definite explanations, but there are currently two main theories for why - to put it bluntly - the Ashkenazim turned their backs on the Geonim.</p>\n<p>The first theory suggests that Ashkenazi law and tradition are mainly rooted in the customs of Eretz Yisrael, which in many respects differ significantly from those of the Babylonian Geonim. This theory was first proposed by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Judah_Loeb_Rapoport\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shlomo Yehudah Rapoport</a> (ShI\"R) in his book <em>Toldot Gedolei Yisrael</em>, vol. 1, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/toladotkerakh1el12rapo/page/n249/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pp. 245-246</a>, and further developed by later scholars.

Some suggest that we must differentiate between early Ashkenazi Jewry and later Ashkenazi Jewry. Much of the ways of the former were lost during the Crusades and Ashkenazi Jewry gradually turned to follow more of Babylonian custom, together with the development of local Ashkenazi customs. See for example Prof. Yisrael Ta-Shema <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/24164932\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and the above-cited articles by Grossman.</p>\n<p>The second theory is mainly held by Prof. Chaim Soloveitchik, who, in a series of studies, proposed that Ashkenazi customs differ from Babylonian ones because Ashkenazi Jews mainly follow the teachings of a third Babylonian Yeshiva. The Geonim of Babylon were the sages of the two main yeshivot, Sura and Pumbedita. But during the time of the Amoraim there were more yeshivas in Babylon. Soloveitchik proposes that one of these yeshivas refused to bow down to the halachic hegemony of Sura and Pumbedita, and students from that yeshiva eventually became the first Ashkenazi sages, or at least taught those first sages. To strengthen his proposal, Soloveitchik noted:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned above, few copies of the Yerushalmi were known throughout Ashkenaz and the Yerushalmi wasn't cited very often. On the other hand, Ashkanzi Jews held great reverence for the Bavli.</li>\n<li>To survive among the non-Jews, Ashkenazi Jews had to develop many leniences regarding trading with non-Jews. This explains the minimalization of Tractate Avodah Zarah in the Ashkenazi curriculum (this assumption is based on A\"Z missing from a list of tractates mentioned in Genizah fragment Ms. Alder 2639.46-47, published by Avraham Marmorstein <a href=\"https://sammlungen.ub.uni-frankfurt.de/cm/periodical/titleinfo/2829918\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pp. 134-135).</li>\n<li>Reverence for the Bavli but lack of reverence for the Babylonian Geonim - as displayed, e.g., in the responsum by Rabbeinu Gershom mentioned above - can only be explained by a \"rebellious\" third Babylonian Yeshiva.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, this theory also has its flaws and detractors. Prof. Robert Brody, in his essay '<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26661657\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">On the Dissemination of the Babylonian Talmud and the Origins of Ashkenazi Jewry</a>', <em>Jewish Quarterly Review</em> 109 (2019), dedicated entirely to refuting Solovetichik's theory, noted, for example (p. 270) that Ashkenazi disagreement with the Geonim remain respectful and within legitimate boundaries of halachic discourse. For Soloveitchik's response to Brody's article, see <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26661658\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Another potential flaw in the theory is that a few years ago Prof. Simcha Emanuel (one of the most active proponents of the \"<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%96%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genizat Europa</a>\" project) discovered an Italin copy of an Eretz-Yisrael work called <em>Ma'ayn Ha'sheiltot</em> which shows that ca. the 9th century CE (in the midst of the Geonic period), the Jews of Eretz Yisrael were greatly influenced by the laws and customs of the Babylonian Jews. That this work was copied in Italy may potentially demonstrate its influence upon the customs of Ashkenazi Jewry - i.e., directly tying them to the two main Babylonian communities/yeshivas - Sura and Pumbedita. See <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/126400074/The_Third_Yeshivah_of_Bavel_Origins_Description_and_Implications\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a Hebrew summary of Soloveitchik's arguments and those of (some of) his detractors.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>R. Yitzchak Aizik Halevi (<a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/reader/reader.aspx?sfid=20282#p=292\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Doros Harishonim, vol. 6, pp. 144a ff</a>) attributes this to the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/111839/jewish/The-Four-Captives.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Four Captives</a>, of whom Raavad I in his Seder Hakabbalah states that they had sailed from Bari in southern Italy (and R. Halevi forcefully argues that this is correct, as against other historians who argued that they were from Babylonia). In Italy, and in general in Christian Europe, the Jews had less frequent contact with the Geonim, and so developed their own independent approaches to the Gemara, which the Four Captives then transmitted to their adopted communities around the Mediterranean basin. Further on (pp. 147b-148a) he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההתחברות הגדולה שהיתה‏ למדינות ארצות המערב עם גאוני בבל היתה מצד אחד טובה מאד כי השפיעו עליהם שפע חכמתם,‏ אבל מצד אחר היו סמוכים יותר מדי על שולחן אחרים,‏ ולא הורגלו‏ בחתוך ההלכות,‏ והעמידה על רגלי עצמן... לא כן גדולי חכמי ארץ איטאליא בימים הראשונים שהם לא הי׳ להם קשור גדול עם הגאונים,‏ והוכרחו בכל ספיקתיהם לעמוד על רגלי עצמם,‏ על כן הורגלו גדולי חכמיהם ללון בעומקה של הלכה ולהביא לבב חכמה מתוך הש״ס,‏ לעמוד בכל דבר על יסוד הדבר מדברי הש״ס,‏ ולהכריע כל דבר ודבר משם...</p>\n<p>ולא עברו ימים מועטים והננו רואים לפנינו בספרד וארצות המערב כי חדשה נהיתה,‏ שני הדרכים התנגשו יחד,‏ ויולידו את הממוצעת,‏ היא דרך חיקור הלכה עם ידיעת קבלת הגאונים,‏ ובכל הספקות הנופלים לבלי להשען על הכרעת הגאונים לבד,‏ כי אם לשוב אל המעין ולברר הדבר מסוגיות הש״ס,‏ אז קם דור‏ חדש של רב שמואל הנגיד ורבנו חננאל,‏ של רב אלפס והרי״ץ גאות,‏ ויקומו הבונים החדשים ויראו נפלאות מתורתם,‏ והיכל התורה נבנה לתלפיות,‏ והתורה נשתכללה נתבררה בכל מקצועותיה,‏ וזו באמת נפלאות מתורת ההשגחה אשר נתן לכל אחת מהדרכים מקומה ללכת דרכה עד אשר התלכדו יחד...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a nutshell, that in Spain and North Africa, since they had close contacts with the Geonim, they tended to rely more on the latter's analyses rather than developing their own, while in Italy they were forced to be more independent. Then, not long after the episode of the captives, we find, in Spain and North Africa, a blended approach: careful analysis of the Gemara together with the Geonic traditions, and in cases of doubt, to look at the Gemara itself and decide accordingly. \"There then arose a new generation, of R. Shmuel Hanagid and Rabbeinu Chananel, of the Rif and R. Yitzchak ibn Ghayyath. These new architects arose and displayed wonders of their Torah, so that the edifice of Torah was built as a beacon, and the Torah was built up and clarified in all its aspects. This is, in truth, one of the wonders of G-d's Providence, that He gave each of these approaches time to develop in its own way until they meshed together...\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Holes in walls above ten tefach",
    "content": "# Holes in walls above ten tefach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=137\" rel=\"nofollow\">The <em>Bavli</em>, <em>Shabas</em> 7 <em>amud</em> 2</a>, has a discussion about holes in walls, where things might land if thrown. Holes on the <em>r'shus-hayachid</em>-facing side of a wall are deemed <em>r'shus hayachid</em>, so tossing something into one from within the <em>r'shus hayachid</em> is permissible. The question arises, though, what holes on a <em>r'shus-harabim</em>-facing side of a wall are considered: <em>r'shus harabim</em> or not.</p>\n\n<p>The next four paragraphs (five including this one) provide detail about the <em>g'mara</em> and basis for my question: skip down to the horizontal rule if you're familiar with the <em>g'mara</em> and <em>Rashi</em> or simply wish to get to the gist of my question.</p>\n\n<p><em>Rashi</em> (ד״ה לאו כרשות הרבים דמו) says that in the second alternative — that such holes are not <em>r'shus harabim</em> — they'd be considered a separate <em>r'shus</em>: thus (he continues), if they are four <em>tefach</em> square they're a <em>karm'lis</em> and otherwise they're a <em>m'kom p'tur</em>. Note that a four-<em>tefach</em>-square area would normally be a <em>karm'lis</em> only less than ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground: more than ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground, such an area would normally be a <em>r'shua hayachid</em>. This is the first indication (to me) that these holes in walls under halachic discussion may be <em>only</em> those less than ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground.</p>\n\n<p>Let's continue — excusing, if you please, my quasi-stream-of-consciousness post.</p>\n\n<p>The <em>g'mara</em> goes on to cite a <em>mishna</em> that says if you throw something at a wall four <em>amos</em> away, more ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground, you're exempt; but lower than that, you're liable as if the thrown object had landed on the ground. <em>Rabi Yochanan</em>'s interpretation of this is given: that the thrown object stuck to the wall. That <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> didn't offer the simpler explanation, that the object landed in a hole in the wall, indicates, the <em>g'mara</em> says, that had it landed in such a hole, lower than ten <em>tefach</em>, the thrower would be exempt — proof that holes in the wall are not considered <em>r'shus harabim</em>. The <em>g'mara</em> counters that the wall in question has no holes, and that that's the reason <em>Rabi Yochanan</em> didn't say that the object landed in a hole in the wall. How do we know it has no holes? Well, from the first case of the <em>mishna</em>: that the object reached the wall above ten <em>tefach</em>. If the wall had holes and the thrown object landed in one, the thrower would be liable, even above ten <em>tefach</em>!</p>\n\n<p>Now, wait a second. (This is me speaking now, not the <em>g'mara</em>.) <em>Why</em> would the thrower be liable then? I'd think that, since the hole is considered <em>r'shus harabim</em> (the hypothesis of this whole series of arguments in the <em>g'mara</em>), he'd be liable for throwing something four <em>amos</em> in a <em>r'shus harabim</em>. Not so, says <em>Rashi</em>: he'd be liable because \"הא ה״ל מרה״ר לרה״י דהוה ליה גבוה י׳ ורשות לעצמו‎ / it's [a throw] from <em>r'shus harabim</em> to <em>r'shus hayachid</em>, for [the hole] is ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground and its own <em>r'shus</em>\". This explanation is my second indication that the halachic discussion of whether holes in walls are considered <em>r'shus harabim</em> applies <em>only</em> to those less than ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground — and this one's a strong indication in my opinion. Moreover, <em>Rashi</em>'s explanation is necessitated by the next step in the <em>g'mara</em>, which also indicates as much — but I'll stop here.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So <em>Rashi</em> and even the <em>g'mara</em> seem to indicate that the holes in walls that may be considered <em>r'shus harabim</em> are only those that are less than ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is this explicit anywhere? I inferred it from the argument of the <em>g'mara</em> and the wording of <em>Rashi</em>, but it seems like an important point to omit. (Moreover, maybe I'm wrong, and the holes in walls that may be considered <em>r'shus harabim</em> are even those more than ten <em>tefach</em> up. If so, that'd make a good answer to this subquestion (and then ignore my second subquestion).)</li>\n<li>Does this apply only to the <em>r'shus-harabim</em> side, or are holes on the <em>r'shus-hayachid</em> side of a wall, also, considered <em>r'shus hayachid</em> only up to ten <em>tefach</em> off the ground? I suspect (strongly) that the <em>r'shus-hayachid</em> side may be different, since, generally, <em>r'shus-harabim</em> airspace is not considered <em>r'shus harabim</em> higher than ten <em>tefach</em>, which is not true of <em>r'shus hayachid</em>; but just as I have no explicit source to say the <em>r'shus-harabim</em>-side holes in walls are (possibly) <em>r'shus harabim</em> only up to ten <em>tefach</em>, so do I have no explicit source to say the <em>r'shus-hayachid</em>-side holes in walls are <em>r'shus hayachid</em> even higher than ten <em>tefach</em>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The only case ever of Reshus Harabim above 10 Tephachim is on the shoulders, like the B'nei Levi. The Gemara is discussing if the the hole being open to the area renders it as a part of the domain it is open to. We know without any doubt that Reshus Harabim is only up to ten Tephachim. Therefore, there never was any question that the hole being discussed here (facing Reshus Harabim) is within the ten Tephachim.</p>\n\n<p>As for Reshus Hayachis, it is as you said, Reshus Hayachid Oleh Ad Harakiah, it goes all the way up.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>One ought to just have fixed the hole in the wall in the first place, which also helps you avoid the issue of whether you have to search it for <em>chametz</em> come Passover and worry whether your gentile neighbors who share the wall will think you're casting spells and come harm you, or fear that you might get stung by a scorpion. (Pesachim P1 8a / Steinsaltz v6 p39). Also, your mother is hollering at you for throwing things at the wall. </p>\n\n<p>Glibness aside. :) As a contributing note Pesachim discusses holes in walls in the context of searching for chametz, and determining which holes you are required to search and not required to search. It hints at the same issue you are investigating, which is the boundary between usefulness/accessibility and that which is inconvenient or dangerous enough that you are not liable for it. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The gemara answers: The apparent contradiction between the first ruling with regard to holes and the second ruling with regard to holes is not difficult. This baraita, which rules that one need not search them, is referring to upper and lower holes, which are difficult to use. And that baraita, which rules that one is required to search them, is referring to intermediate holes, whose use is convenient. (Steinsaltz Bavli Pesachim PI d8a / v6 p38)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, the Mordechai in chapter eight of Yevamot cites the רא\"ם that descendants of royalty were not mixed up by Sanherib.

Additionally, multiple genizah manuscripts of this section refer to two brachot.</p>\n<p>To go one further step with א<sup>א</sup>: Wieder says that the manuscript itself has evidence of a correction. Namely, the scribe started copying the text with two brachot that was in front of him, and then erased his work (but not well enough to cover his tracks!) and changed it to the text we have in the printed edition. Wieder mentions a similar \"correction\" in a manuscript of Seder Rav Amram Gaon (but there, instead of erasing, the scribe added: \"the halacha is not like this, we don't say two brachot\").</p>\n<p>It seems that all the evidence points to the original text of the siddur containing two brachot for tefillin: להניח on the של יד and במצות on the של ראש.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is it ever a Chillul Hashem to discuss Torah principles?",
    "content": "# Is it ever a Chillul Hashem to discuss Torah principles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam explains one type of Chillul Hashem as follows (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/1105.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מיי' הל' יסודי התורה פ\"ה הי\"ד</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש דברים אחרים שהם בכלל חילול השם, והוא שיעשה אדם גדול בתורה ומפורסם בחסידות, דברים שהברייות מרננים אחריו בשבילן, ואף על פי שאינם עבירות--הרי זה מחלל את השם:  כגון שלוקח ואינו נותן דמי הלקח לאלתר, והוא שיש לו, ונמצאו המוכרין תובעין אותו, והוא מקיפן; או שירבה בשחוק, או באכילה ושתייה אצל עמי הארץ וביניהן; או שאין דיבורו בנחת עם הברייות, ואינו מקבילן בסבר פנים יפות, אלא בעל קטטה וכעס; וכיוצא בדברים האלו.  הכול לפי גודלו של חכם--צריך שידקדק על עצמו, ויעשה לפנים משורת הדין.</p>\n<p>There are some other things included in Chillul Hashem [besides those involving overtly breaking mitzvos]. This is when a person who is learned in Torah and famous for his piety performs actions that cause others to denigrate him; despite the fact that they are not technically <em>aveiros</em>, this is Chillul Hashem. For example, if a person buys an item and does not pay immediately despite the fact that he has money on him, and the seller demands it from him and he takes the item on credit. Or, if he is excessively merry, or eats or drinks excessively among simpletons. Or, if he does not speak gently to others, and does not receive them kindly, but is often angry and argumentative. All of these sort of things are Chillul Hashem. A wise man must be scrupulous in his behavior and go beyond the letter of the law, according to his greatness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When I was in yeshiva an incident occured where a student in the IDF refused to attend a military concert where women were singing and lost his position. Our shiur was discussing the halacha of the situation afterwards, and our Rebbe vehemtly disagreed with the suggestion that the student's action might have been a Chillul Hashem. This Rebbe said that when one is doing a mitzvah, it is not considered a Chillul Hashem if other people are offended by that mitzvah itself. What I took from this was that the Rambam means that in regards to <em>non-mitzvah-related actions</em>, one must act in a way that will not garner disapproval from others, but if one is doing an <em>actual mitzvah</em>, then if others disapprove it is their own fault that they don't appreciate the mitzvah, and therefore it is not considered Chillul Hashem. I don't know exactly what our Rebbe's source for this was, but I think the Chinuch agrees with him (see <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34302&st=&pgnum=277\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מצווה תכא: להניח תפלין על היד</a> from \"והמחמירים בקדושת המצוה\" on, where he brings an opinion that it is a Chillul Hashem to wear tefillin when one's actions are not befitting, and argues on it).</p>\n<p>Now here is my question: I was wondering whether this applies in the case where one is discussing or explaining Torah principles. There are certain halachos and hashkafic principles that are not \"politically correct,\" and kiruv Rabbis and other Orthodox Jews who regularly interact with non-Orthodox Jews often avoid talking about them or whitewash them. (Examples: the issur to teach gentiles Torah, the laws of apikorsus, many gemaras discussing women, etc.) Now I understand that <em>pragmatically</em> it may be a bad idea to tell the non-Orthodox and gentiles about these details, since it might make it less likely that they will reach a higher level of avodas Hashem<sup>1</sup>. The question, though, is whether it is a <em>Chillul Hashem</em> to tell them about these things. Perhaps it is similar to the case of the incident I mentioned above, but this case is a little different since one is not actually <em>performing</em> a mitzvah. Would the Rambam say that one must \"speak gently\" and not reveal these things –slash– frame them in an overly positive way, or would he say that in the case of talking about Torah principles this law doesn't apply?</p>\n<p><sup>1</sup>(For example, the Rambam says on Avos 2:14 that דע מה להשיב לאפיקורס doesn't apply if the heretic is a Jew, since he may become more entrenched in his ways if you try to argue with him.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>We have laws that some things can not be taught to certain people. Teaching those people laws that you are not allowed to teach, especially if doing so makes Gd look bad, is certainly a Chilul Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>Because of the public nature of this forum, I do not want to list what things you are not allowed to teach to which people.  But as you brought up in your question, \"the issur to teach gentiles Torah\". Another commonly known one is that you can not teach Ma'eseh Bereshit in front of more then one or two students.</p>\n\n<p>You mentioned in your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Perhaps it is similar to the case of the incident I\n  mentioned above, but this case is a little different since one is not\n  actually <em>performing</em> a mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Incorrect, teaching Torah is a Mitzvah. When one is allowed to teach Torah. Talmud Torah is mainly about teaching.  See here:  <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/rambam/talmudtorah/tt1.1.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rambam on the Mitzvah of Talmud Torah</a> </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Would the Rambam say that one must\n  \"speak gently\" and not reveal these things / frame them in an\n  overly positive way, or would he say that in the case of talking about\n  Torah principles this law doesn't apply?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As you stated in your question, the only time this does not apply is when one is doing a mitzvah.  Since in the situations you mentioned, you are most likely not doing a mitzvah, and are likely in fact teaching someone who you are not supposed to teach (though not technically violating any of the negative commandments), then doing so is obviously a Chilul Hashem.</p>\n\n<p>This is made explicitly clear by the Rambam in your question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>This is when a person who is learned in Torah and famous for his\n  piety performs actions that cause others to denigrate him; despite the\n  fact that they are not technically aveiros, this is Chillul Hashem.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If what you are doing is not technically an aveirah, and what you are doing is not technically a mitzvah, then everything that Rambam says about Chillul Hashem applies.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I mentioned above, but this case is a little different since one is\n  not actually performing a mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to clarify the difference if I may. The boy who refused to listen to a woman sing is refraining from a sin. Chillul Hashem is an aveirah when one has a choice, on the other hand when one is commanded by g-d not to do something there is no aveirah of chillul hashem whether or not it causes someone to think bad things about g-d or his torah. G-d knows that not everyone will understand his mitzvos and he commanded them anyways. On the other hand to discuss the laws of the torah that are hard to understand with someone who is skeptical and will ridicule them is not something we are commanded to do so we do not have the above logic. Also we must keep in mind that much of the time we do not understand g-ds laws well enough to clearly explain it to someone who is skeptical so the chances of teaching it incorrectly are great enough that it may result in a chillul hashem by teaching it incorrectly. Meaning that to do this needs a very strong purpose and a very knowledgeable person.</p>\n\n\n",

This seems to imply that the correct niqqud should be חַיּוֹת <em>hayoth</em> (a word which can refer to angels). On the other hand, when I encountered the name I had always blindly assumed that it was חִיּוּת (\"vitality\"), and the same spelling could also be חַיּוּת (\"vitality\"). Are any of these vocalizations correct? Alternatively, is his original last name a non-Hebrew word pronounced /χajəs/ (in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet\" rel=\"nofollow\">IPA</a>) that was identified with a Hebrew word with niqqud just a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_etymology\" rel=\"nofollow\">folk etymology</a>, and therefore it might not have a \"correct\" vocalization? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>\"Chajes\" is not the English version of the name, but the German version, which would point to a pronunciation of \"חַיֶס\". In Hebrew, though, there's a <em>vav</em>, which it seems was pronounced as a <em>cholam</em>. But I can't find any explicit evidence for this.</p>\n\n<p>If you look at his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26820&st=&pgnum=2\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><em>Iggeres Bikores</em> republished in 1853 by Jacob Brull</a>, you'll see the German version \"Chajes\" on the cover page. (He was still alive at that time and even wrote a short preface to this edition.) More interesting, though, is the sentence in Brull's preface in which he makes a play on Chajes's name. He writes: \"ולי מה יקרו אמרות איש בריתי, חיו״ת הנה\", in which he's clearly referencing Shemos 1:19, which has the <em>nikkud</em>: חָיוֹת. Now, being a <em>play</em> on the name, it needs to be taken with a grain of salt, but we can assume that that was at least <em>similar</em> to what his name sounded like.</p>\n\n<p>Besides for that, I can't seem to find any source that has explicit vowelization for his name or would make it clear what the correct pronunciation was. As a side point, I'm pretty sure his grandson Tzvi Peretz Chajes pronounced his name \"Chayot\", but now that I look into that, I can't find a good source for that either. If I find anything else, I'll update this post.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I have usually heard the name pronounced as stated in the Wikipedia article, especially in academic settings.

One source that I can link to is an article on name from [The Jewish Quarterly Review vol. 10][1], where the theory is proposed that it comes from the woman's name 'Chaya'. Regardless of the theory though, the author was confident that this is the proper way to pronounce this Eastern European surname.</p>\n\n<p>[1]  <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=c1kpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA531&vq=Chajes&dq=pronunciation+chajes&output=html_text&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://books.google.com/books?id=c1kpAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA531&vq=Chajes&dq=pronunciation+chajes&output=html_text&source=gbs_search_r&cad=1</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I heard Rabbi Yitzhak Yosef and his father Rav Ovadia z'l pronounce it \"Maharatz Hauyt\"</p>\n\n\n",

As is described in that Wikipedia article, an \"open syllable\" is a syllable which ends in a vowel and a closed syllable is one that ends in a consonant, e.g. in \"pronunciation\" the open syllables are \"pro\", \"ci\" and \"a\", while the closed syllables are \"nun\" and \"tion\".</p>\n<p>Also recall that in English and Hebrew words have what is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28linguistics%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">stress</a> on one of the syllables. For example, the English word \"contest\" in the sentence \"I won the contest\" has the stress on the first syllable (<em>CON-test</em>), while the word \"contest\" in the sentence \"I want to contest that ruling\" has the stress on the second syllable (<em>con-TEST</em>). In Hebrew the stress is most often on the last syllable (e.g. מָכַר <em>ma-KHAR</em>), but is sometimes on the second-to-last syllable (e.g. מֶכֶר <em>ME-kher</em>). In the Tanakh the <em>ta'ame hamiqra</em> are placed on the stressed syllable, but in general one must just know which syllable is stressed by being familiar with Hebrew. A few texts mark the stress with a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">meteg</a> (e.g. the Artscroll siddur when the stress is not on the last syllable), or with an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ole_%28cantillation%29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ole</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Qamas Qatan and Gadol</strong></p>\n<p>Now, most Sephardim have two ways to pronounce the qamas vowel. It is sometimes pronounced <em>a</em> (e.g. חָפַר) and sometimes <em>o</em> (e.g. חָפְשִׁי). When it is pronounced <em>a</em> it is called a qamas gadol, and when it is pronounced <em>o</em> it is called a qamas qatan. The general rule is that a qamas is always a qamas gadol unless it is in an <em>unstressed, closed syllable</em>.</p>\n<p>Examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>חָפְשִׁי  = <em>hof-SHI</em>: The syllable <em>khof</em> is unstressed and closed and therefore has a qamas qatan.</li>\n<li>חָפַר = <em>ha-FAR</em>: The syllable <em>kha</em> is unstressed, but it is not closed (it is open), so it has a qamas gadol.</li>\n<li>עוֹלָם = <em>ʿo-LAM</em>: The syllable <em>LAM</em> is stressed, so it has a qamas gadol.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, there are a few complications, and I'd like to mention two specifically. Firstly, one must remember that a consonant with dagesh hazaq (i.e. dagesh on a letter other than one of the letters בגדכפ\"ת) is pronounced as doubly long, and this affects syllabification. For example, in חָנֵּנִי  = <em>hon-NE-ni</em> the first nun is doubled, so the first syllable is closed and unstressed, and therefore has a qamas qatan. Secondly, the word כָּל is almost always pronounced as <em>kol</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>Shewa Naʿ and Nah</strong></p>\n<p>The details of exactly when a shewa is naʿ (i.e. pronounced as <em>e</em>) and when it is nah (i.e. silent) are complicated, but here are the basic rules. There are five rules that you can remember by the siman אבגד\"ה:</p>\n<p>(א) A shewa is always naʿ at the beginning (א׳) of a word. Example: קְרִיאָה = <em>q<strong>e</strong>ria</em></p>\n<p>(ב) A shewa following two (ב׳) consecutive consonants is always naʿ. In other words, when two consonants are written next to each other and both have a shewa, the second shewa is naʿ. Example: אֶשְׁמְרָה = <em>eshm<strong>e</strong>ra</em> (Both שְׁ and מְ have a shewa and are next to each other.)</p>\n<p>(ג) A shewa under a letter that follows a <em>tenuʿa gedola</em> (ג׳ for גדולה), a long vowel, is always naʿ. The following vowels are the <em>tenuʿot gedolot</em>: אָ when it is qamas gadol, אֵ ,אִי ,אֹ ,אוֹ, and אוּ. (Note: this does <em>not</em> include אִ‎, אָ when it is qamas qatan, or אֻ). Example: שוֹמְרִים = <em>shom<strong>e</strong>rim</em>.</p>\n<p>(ד) A shewa under a letter with dagesh (ד׳) hazaq is always naʿ. Example: אֲכַפְּרָה = <em>akhapp<strong>e</strong>ra</em>.</p>\n<p>(ה) A shewa is always naʿ between two identical (ה׳ for הַדּוֹמִים) consonants written with separate letters (rather than dagesh hazaq). Example: וּלְלֵאָה = <em>ul<strong>e</strong>lea</em>.</p>\n<p>The most complicated rule is definitely ה׳, and there are some seeming exceptions, but אין כאן מקום להאריך. I do think it's worth noticing when qamas is followed by sheva in an unstressed syllable, as in the word שָמְרָה, there are two possibilities -- either the first qamas is qamas gadol and the shewa is naʿ (so <em>sham<strong>e</strong>ra</em>), or the first qamas is qamas qatan and the shewa is nah (so <em>shomra</em>). These are words with different meanings, so with a basic siddur, you would need to use context to figure out which is correct each time one shows up.</p>\n<p><strong>For more information</strong></p>\n<p>I believe the Radak discusses all of this in his Sefer HaMichlol. Tiqqunim also often have a section in the back about diqduq that covers these topics and more.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is it Nivul Peh to ask if a phrase is Nivul Peh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Suppose that one is not sure whether a certain phrase is considered Nivul Peh or not. Could it be Nivul Peh to ask a Rov if that phrase is Nivul Peh (using the phrase)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I was just reading Pesachim the other day and it discussed the issues of euphemism and dignified language. I would interpret the examples to mean that yes, it is nivul peh to directly use the phrase to ask if it is prohibited, although you do want to balance these concerns with the need for brevity. </p>\n\n<p>Pesachim I opens with a mishna in which Yehuda HaNasi uses \"or\" (light) as a euphemism for darkness / night, and true to Talmud form, there are about 8 pages of exegesis on whether and why \"or\" is to be taken literally or as a euphemism.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>…a baraita was taught in the school of Rabbi Yishmael: A person should always converse euphemistically… And it says in another verse: \"And you choose the language of the crafty\" (Job 15:5), meaning that one should be clever when speaking and avoid inappropriate phrases. And it says in another verse: \"My words shall utter the uprightness of my heart; and that which my lips know they shall speak sincerely\" (Job 33:3). (Steinsaltz Talmud v6, <em>Pesachim I</em>, PI 3A / pg 13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Steinsaltz notes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Some sages distinguish between [euphemism and dignified language]. One should go out of his way to speak euphemistically, so as to avoid using a crude phrase. Dignified language, however, is used not to avoid despicable language, but rather to avoid language that includes a slight trace of the derogatory or which bears a negative connotation, e.g. the direct mention of the night. One need not avoid <em>that type</em> of speech at the expense of brevity. (Steinsaltz v6 Pesachim I, p 13)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>There are more examples that try to establish the balance between brevity and dignity of language, which seem to favor dignity e.g. this interpretation from Steinsaltz about one of the examples:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The student who used the word <em>impure</em> spoke in a more concise manner, which the Gemara stated is appropriate for a teacher to his students. Nevertheless, a student may speak at slightly greater length in a more refined manner, in deference to his teacher. Furthermore, the use of the term <em>impure</em> is actually imprecise in this context, as there is no obligation to collect olives while ritually impure; rather one is simply not obligated to be in a state of ritual purity when collecting olives. (Steinsaltz vol6 Pesachim I, p 14)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So you should be both euphemistic and brief in asking such a question, but favoring dignity and not using a crude term. Like, suppose you were asking about whether the word \"pig\" were nivul peh. You could start by phrasing \"Rav, I wanted to know if a certain term is nivul peh,\" to indicate that your inquiry is in the spirit of knowledge and you're not trying to be crude. Then you say \"the term is the p-word,\" and use as euphemistic a term as possible to avoid speaking crudely. If the Rav doesn't know what you mean you provide a little more detail until the term is clarified.</p>\n\n\n",

You'll notice that the language is different even within the Shulchan Aruch between OC240 (\"how to be a very holy person\") and EH25 (\"how to treat your wife.\") Rabbi Henkin's essay goes through some of the frustrations in trying to determine what laws on this subject were codified how and where. There are contemporary opinions that run the gamut from \"everything in OC240 is absolute halacha, plus a bunch more things are assur too\" to \"these reflect a certain set of minhagim that may be recommended in some situations, and occasionally an ascetic philosophy that is not the right one for our time.\"</p>\n\n<p>Personally? I recommend chasanim <strong>not</strong> read OC240. We decry how damaging inappropriate videos are to marital relationships because their focus is \"whatever makes me feel good, I don't have to think of the woman as a person with her own feelings, wants, and needs\"; as the Steipler letter points out, some of the ascetic material in our rabbinic literature (which as Rabbi Lichtenstein points out, leaves us perplexed where it came from) seems to say: \"just do whatever gives you least pleasure so you can be holy\", ignoring that there's another human being in the room with their own feelings, wants, and needs. A martyrdom attitude -- \"I will try to totally ignore my wants whatsoever and only do what I think is good for the other person\" -- tends not to work in normal relationships either. This has to be about two people who respect each other and work together.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rabbi Eliezer Melamed has a sefer on this topic in his Peninei Halacha Series called \"שמחת הבית וברכתו\".

The first three are introductory to the concept of kedusha, prishus, taava. Then he goes through the halachos in OC240, speaking out the practical halacha and practical guidance with them in a very tzanua way. </p>\n\n<p>One of his unique points is discussing conflict in these areas. i.e. if the Shulchan aruch says a certain thing is assur/discouraged, but a wife desires it, when do we say that the chiyuv onah- providing pleasure to one's wife- overrides the issur aspect? </p>\n\n<p>It's a great combination of hashkafa and halachic guidelines, especially for someone who has already studied these halachos inside the Mishna berurah.</p>\n\n<p>His last class there addresses the issues of why not teach these halachos more publicly, and when yes to share these etc.</p>\n\n<p>I don't think these are published online (especially in light of that last point!) but these classes are possible to obtain, especially if you know talmidim of his.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8209#v=18\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bereishit 14:18</a>) Rashi brings the rabbinic tradition that Malki-Tzedek was Shem, the son of Noah.

So it's very likely that the Shem's altar was on the holy mountain rather than on the plain (I think it is not a coincidence that he lived in Jerusalem). But we read nothing about Shem/Malki-Tzedek helping Avraham in building his altar on the very same mountain where we expect to see the altar of king/priest of Hashem. And it is strange to build your altar on the holy place on the very same place where king/priest is living, to whom you just gave tithes.</p>\n\n<p>I'm just curious if any of the sages comment on that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You are correct. Midrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.31.8?ven=Pirke_de_Rabbi_Eliezer,_trans._Rabbi_Gerald_Friedlander,_London,_1916&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei D'Rabbi Eliezer 31</a> notes this specific point.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Simeon said: The Holy One, blessed be He, pointed out the altar with a finger to Abraham our father, and said to him: This is the altar. That was the altar whereon Cain and Abel sacrificed; it was the same altar whereon Noah and his sons sacrificed, as it is said, \"And Abraham built <strong>the altar</strong> there\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshis 22:9</a>). \"And Abraham built <em>an</em> altar there\" is not written here, but \"And Abraham built <em>the</em> altar there.\" That was the altar whereon the first ones (of old) had sacrificed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is likely that Shem, who was a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.14.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohen</a> used the altar as well if it was there.</p>\n<p>How should one understand the midrash? It is possible that the altar stayed intact for so many years. For example, there still exists an <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/joshuas-altar-on-mount-ebal-israels-holy-site-before-shiloh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">altar on Mt. Eval</a> going to the times of Yehoshua. Then why does the text state that Abraham built it? Most likely prepared it for service.</p>\n<p>The commentaries on the Midrash (HaRaDa\"L, MaHaRZ\"O) do not use the word \"like\" the altar built before. However, in another instance of the donkey that Moshe rode, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.31.4?vhe=Pirkei_Derabi_Eliezer&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei d\"Rabbi Eliezer 31</a> also used the same terminology - the donkey that Abraham saddled. Since no donkey can survive for such a long time, it can be explained as a hint to <em>physicality</em> encapsulated in the word חׂמֶר, same root as חֵמׂר/donkey. I.e. Moshe, just like Abraham, mobilized all his physical forces for the task at hand.</p>\n<p>Based on such a comparison, one can also read the midrash as Avraham built the <em>mizbeach</em>/altar anew in accordance with the rules used by his predecessors, or with the same intent as they did.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Waiting Between Meat & Dairy According To The Geonim\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems as though the <em>Geonim</em> - although disparate and diverse in their opinions on many issues - are united in their understanding of the <em>Gemara</em> regarding of waiting after meat before dairy. According to the <em>Halakhoth Gedholoth</em> of <em>Rav Shimon Qayara</em> and the <em>Halakhoth P'suqoth</em> of <em>Rav Ahai Gaon</em>—and even <em>Rasa\"g</em>, as quoted in a now lost portion of his siddur found in an anonymous commentator from Yemen on the <em>Ri\"f</em>—one need only wash his hands (<em>n'tillath yadhayim/hidaha</em>) and cleanse the palate (<em>qinuaħ ha-pe</em>) before eating dairy after eating meat. They do not require waiting unless one decided not to wash or cleanse their palate. I have found no <em>Gaon</em> who argues on this point.</p>\n<p><strong>My question is this</strong>: If the Geonic tradition is clear on this point, why did some <em>Rishonim</em> require one to wait no matter what?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>According to  <a href=\"https://seforimblog.com/2015/08/waiting-six-hours-for-dairy-rabbanite/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> on the Seforimblog, it was as a reaction to Karaites who were lax in regards to meat, interpreting \"in its mother’s milk\" as referring only to the milk of its mother.</p>\n<p>To very briefly summarize the main points, originally, Karaites forbade meat consumption entirely (theoretically allowing only the consumption of sacrifices.  In the tenth century, the trend shifted and Karaites began to eat meat, thus making their interpretation of \"a kid in its mothers milk\" practically relevant.</p>\n<p>It was shortly thereafter, in the early 11th century that we find the first reference to mandatory wait between meat and milk (in Rabbenu Chananel).</p>\n<p>He notes that this explanation of R. Chananel is presented by no less that Rabbenu Tam who writes in Sefer HaYashar (ch. 472):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ספר הישר לרבינו תם סימן תעב. כל הבשר. אמ' רב נחמן לא שנו ...פירש רב יהודאי בשאלתות שנשאלו לפניו... אבל בין בשר בהמה לגבינה בעי קינוח והדחה. והא דאמר מר עוקבא להא מילתא (חלא) בר חמרא אנא כו' היינו גבי שיהוי בלא קינוח. דהא בעי ר' יוחנן כמה ישהא כו' היינו היכא דלא קינח אבל אי קינח לא בעי שיהוי. (ובין) גבינה לבשר לא בעי קינוח כלל....ובין בשר לגבינה בעי קינוח או שיהוי... וכן מוכיח בהלכות גדולות של ברכות.... וכן עיקר. <strong>ואע\"ג דר' חנינא פליג אהאי פיסקא לאו דסמכא. דהא דאורי שאינן בני דאורייתא. ובקעה מצא וגדר בה גדר</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, in ruling that one must wait, R. Chananel was making a fence against those who dont follow halacha.</p>\n<p>('R. Chanina' is a typo. It should say R. Chananel).</p>\n<p>This explanation of Rabbenu Tam is  quoted by the Sefer HaManhig (12th century) as well (note that he has 'Chananel', not 'Chanina'):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואע\"פ שרבינו חננאל פליג אהאי פיסקא וכן הרב אלפאסי לאו דסמכא נינהו ולמקום שאינן בני תורה חששו ובקעא מצאו וגדרו בה גדר וכן עיקר ... כפר\"ת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article cites several other examples of stringencies to combat the Karaite heresy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Regarding your main question:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>My question is: If the Geonic tradition is clear on this point, why\n  did some Rishonim require one to wait no matter what?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>When there was a shift from one era to another, they were accompanied by major shifts in the world as well.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main differences between Geonim and Rishonim is the shift towards logical \"systems\".  Meaning, it was not enough to have a collection of rules and principles, but you also needed more \"standardization\".  (I'm putting these words in quotes, because they are modern terms which we use, but were not used by the rishonim)</p>\n\n<p>As you stated in your question: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>They do not require waiting unless one decided not to wash or cleanse\n  their palate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The key point in the phrase there is \"unless\".  \"Unless\" becomes complicated, and it becomes hard to \"systemize\".  Better to just remove the \"unless\".</p>\n\n<p>One of the interesting changes during the time of the Rishonim, was a fixation with specific times in minutes and hours, rather than generic activities such as walking a certain distance, or cooking a fish.</p>\n\n<p>I speculate, that another cultural change that might have happened, was less rigorous washing in general.</p>\n\n<p>You can see how cultural attitudes, change people's understanding of laws, but the way that <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/17516/why-not-determine-how-long-to-wait-between-meat-and-milk-using-science?rq=1\">this question</a> is worded or even <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18530/time-dilation-and-waiting-between-meat-and-milk?rq=1\">this question</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Rabeinu Tam, and the Tosofot are noted exceptions here on this topic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Geonim mostly lived in the Middle East, while the Rishonim mostly lived in Europe. So it seems likely that their opinions reflect different local customs. If your local custom is stricter than the established halacha, you can keep it while still recognizing the intellectual authority of those whose halachic ruling is more lenient.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# End Time For Sacrificial Offerings\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The verse states, in Exodus 12:10, regarding the eating of the Paschal Offering:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וְלֹֽא־תוֹתִ֥ירוּ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ עַד־בֹּ֑קֶר וְהַנֹּתָ֥ר מִמֶּ֛נּוּ עַד־בֹּ֖קֶר בָּאֵ֥שׁ תִּשְׂרֹֽפוּ׃</p>\n  \n  <p>Do not leave any of it over until morning. Anything that is left over until morning must be burned in fire.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=52201&st=&pgnum=163\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mekhilta</a> on this verse (Parshas Bo (Maseches d-Pesach) Parsha 6, Paragraph 37), explains the double use of the word \"בֹּקֶר\" (\"morning\"), to be that the verse is prescribing the end time for what is considered \"night\" in regards to the eating of the Paschal Ofering. In this case, the double usage teaches us that instead of the time ending at Netz Hachama, it ends at Alos Hashachar. The Mekhilta then goes on to state that this verse teaches that night ends at Alos with regards to all other sacrificial offerings and things of that sort that the Torah prescribes as ending with the termination of night.</p>\n\n<p>Why does the Mekhilta extend this possuk to all other sacrifices? It would seem simpler and clearer that the Torah has a specific rule <em>only</em> for the Paschal Offering, and not for other offerings, especially given the fact that Netz is generally seen as the end of night bound Mitzvos, (see note 15 in the \"Yisron Ha'Ohr\" section of the commentary on the Mekhilta that is cited).</p>\n\n\n",

The Chayei Adam explicitly says that this is the case even if the Shem Hashem is repeated.</p>\n<p>The Tzitz Eliezer concluded that the prevalent  custom is that if a mistake was made after the shem hashem was said, the pasuk is completed and only then repeated.

The reason is that it is almost impossible to not come in contact or be under the same roof with a dead body.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstiens opinion and some interesting backround can be found in <a href=\"http://download.yutorah.org/1988/1053/735713.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">this article</a> of the RJJ Journal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A number of years ago, a certain kuntress (pamphlet) was published on\n  this question and came to the attention of Rav Shimon Schwab of\n  Washington Heights, who sent it to Rav Moshe Feinstein for comment.\n  Rav Feinstein at first refused to read it, vehemently rejecting the\n  very premise of the kuntress that medical training for a kohen might\n  be permissible. 50 His immediate reaction was that it is so obviously\n  forbidden that .even were the greatest rabbis in the world to try to\n  permit it, we would not consider their opinion. He compared it to a\n  passage in the Gemara (Yevamot 104) which declares that even if the\n  Prophet Elijah himself appears and expounds a law contrary to our\n  prevailing custom, we are not to listen to him. At first, Rav\n  Feinstein was under the impression that the author's thesis was that\n  since all]ews nowadays are considered to be unavoidably Tameh anyway,\n  there is no reason not to increase their Tl-lmeah; this premise he\n  dismissed as totally unaceeptable. However, finally he acceded to the\n  request to respond to the specifics of the kuntress. Rav Feinstein\n  notes that the author attempts a lenient ruling based on the argument\n  of pikuach nefesh - that the kohen-doctor would be able to save lives.\n  This reasoning, too, he rejects as \"emptiness and nonsense\" . One is\n  only obligated to heal the sick if he knows how; there is no\n  requirement for any person to go out and study medicine so that he\n  will be able to practice it! In the same way, one is not obligated to\n  go out and earn money to become rich so that he will have what to give\n  a poor man; rather, if he has money when a beggar asks, then he must\n  give him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However, there have been Rabbis that permitted it. Most notably Rabbi Shlomo Goren who came up with a novel approach to mitigate the issue of Tumaas Meis.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Goren has a questionable קולא About Metal Watches:</p>\n\n<p>We generally assume like the רמב\"ם (not like the ראב\"ד) that מוסיף טומאה על טומאתו only means that a כהן who is physically touching one thing that is טמא מת may touch another thing that is טמא מת , against רבינו תם and the ראב\"ד . We Also hold that מעיקר הדין a piece of metal that was in contact with טומאת מת becomes טומאת מת itself, even though for some reason the רמ\"א was מקיל with regard to such metal. Based on these two ,דינים Rav Goren claimed that if a כהן wants to come into contact with a מת , all he has to do is put on a watch that is טמא מת , which the רמ\"א says is מותר , and then even according to the רמב\"ם one could come into contact with a מת.</p>\n\n<p>(This is highly questionable. First of all, the רמב\"ם may have only meant that there is no אסור דאורייתא for a כהן in contact with one מת to touch another, not that it is completely מותר. Also, the דין of מוסיף טומאה על טומאתו is learned from the word \" להחלו ,\" which is interpreted as excluding anyone who is already מחולל ועומד . One could argue that a person is only considered מחולל ועומד when he is in contact with something that is אסור for him to come into contact with or something that is actually מטמא him. Only then is there already a חלל that coming into contact with another מת cannot worsen. It seems like somewhat of a תרתי דסתרי to paskin that one can touch the watch and then consider himself מחולל ועומד after doing so.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://hods.org/pdf/Rabbi%20Moshe%20Feinstein%27s%20Inf.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rav Moshe Feinstein, p58</a> does not allow it and </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>“strongly rejects the permissive rulings of some rabbis …”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Then the king answered and said, “Give the living child to the first woman,\n  and by no means put him to death; she is his mother.” And all Israel\n  heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in\n  awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in\n  him to do justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If sex outside of marriage was illegal, why did those criminals openly come to King Solomon?

Asexuals may or may not be interested in romantic relationships, but are not physically drawn towards sexual activity. They may choose to live celibately, or to participate in sexual activity for practical considerations, so asexuality and celibacy are two very different things.</p>\n\n<p>Is an asexual person obligated in the mitzvah of Pru Urvu despite not experiencing sexual attraction at all? On the one hand mitzvot are normally obligatory even when one does not want to perform them. On the other hand, perhaps the psychological damage that would be incurred by forcing this person to have children would exempt them. Furthermore, perhaps the commandment is contingent on the presence of sexual attraction in the first place, as suggested by an anonymous source <a href=\"http://frumgaygirl.blogspot.com/2013/11/the-good-rav-chassidic-talmud-chacham.html\">here</a> (the key claim is that \"If a person’s psychological infrastructure was such that it didn’t attract him to women, he is not obliged to steel himself and live in a marital relationship in order to have children.\").</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<ol>\n<li>I would have thought that every Jewish adult is required to keep the mitzvah of pru urevu.

Similarly, when seriously dating s/he should make clear to a prospective spouse what to expect in this relationship. People can work out all sorts of things. (Maybe he can find a similarly asexual woman and their marriage isn't about physical attraction.)</p>\n\n<p>The rule of thumb is that a person is exempt from a \"yes-do\" mitzva if it would cost him/her 25% of his/her assets. (E.g. is no woman in the world will marry me unless I pay $100k, and my total net worth is $200k, I'm not expected to get married.) There may be people out there for whom no fulfilling marriage can be found whatsoever, and the psychological toll of an unfulfilling marriage would be equivalent to losing 25% of one's assets, which would prompt this question. I can't make a blanket rule for every individual. It's all a question of how to apply that concept here.</p>\n\n<p>I do think that if such a person spends some time contemplating what they seek in a relationship, finds an appropriate partner, and is open about their expectations, that they could likely make a marriage work without taking a huge toll on themselves (it may even be beneficial) -- that's my guesstimate for most cases.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it possible for Elohim to mean that G-d has two images, a male and a female image? Thanks!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>It is important to keep in mind that the effectively universal opinion<sup>1</sup> in Orthodox Judaism is that Gd takes no image. So when Gd is described as anthropomorphic in any Jewish literature, in order to understand that description, we must think in an abstract, metaphorical way.</p>\n\n<p>This view is codified explicitly in Maimonides' 13 Principles of faith, which he outlines in his commentary on the mishnah ,(<strong>Sanh. 10:1</strong>). It is based on verses in the Bible, <strong>Deuteronomy 4:15</strong>, to name one. This stance is also evident from Tanaaic times, through <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=megilah&daf=3a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Onkelos the Convert's</a> translation of the bible into aramaic, where he goes out of his way to describe human-like attributes of Gd in conceptual ways, (one of many, many examples can be seen in <strong>Genesis 29:32</strong>). </p>\n\n<p>Equally important is the concept of the oneness of Gd, discussed by Maimonides in the same place, and based on <strong>Deuteronomy 6:4</strong>. Maimonides puts it best:</p>\n\n<p><em>\"... not like one in a pair and not like one in a species and not like a single man that splits in to many individuals and not like one simple body that can be split up endlessly, rather He... is one in oneness, that there is none like it in oneness...\"</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>So Gd having two literal images, or being of two genders, or having gender at all, or being two things contradicts fundamental Jewish belief.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>All of that being said</strong>, we do see both genders relating to Gd. Generally, Gd is referred to as a male, whether He is referred to with the name Elokim, (<strong>Gen. 1:27</strong>), the ineffable name, (<strong>Gen 2:5</strong>), or the name of Adonut, (<strong>Gen. 18:30</strong>).</p>\n\n<p>The only female word we find in relation to Gd is the <em>Shechina</em>, the dwelling or resting [of G-d's presence]. This name is alluded to in <strong>Ex. 25:8</strong>, and mentioned explicitly many times throughout rabbinic literature, for example by Onkelos in <strong>Gen 9:27</strong>, in <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=megilah&daf=29a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 29a</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=bava_basra&daf=58a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Basra 58b</a>. The <em>Shechina</em> is even referred to metaphorically as a niddah, a woman who is impure from her menses, in the extremely esoteric passage of קם רבי שמעון Which is from the Tikkunei Zohar, (see Artscroll Yom Kippur Machzor Hayim Yehezkel p. 56).</p>\n\n<p>One way of understanding gender relating Gd is through the roles of men and women, seen most clearly and simply through the act of procreation. The male acts upon the female, who receives that action and nurtures it, creating new life.</p>\n\n<p>Based on the above metaphor, one can easily see Gd as a male, for everything comes from Him, and He controls the world and acts upon it. </p>\n\n<p>I have come across two understandings of the female role of the Shechina. The first is alluded to in <strong>Exodus 25:8</strong>, <em>\"And they shall make for Me a holy place, and I shall dwell amongst them\"</em>. Notice that Gd dwells amongst us only after we make a holy place for Him. In order to have a realization and appreciation of Gd's presence in our lives and from our perspective we must preform an action which He responds to, cultivating it into a human realization of His Presence, as the female cultivates the actions of the male.</p>\n\n<p>The second understanding is based on the final <em>'Heh'</em> in the ineffable four letter Name, (I think I saw this in <em>Jewish Meditation</em>, written by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, z\"l). Basically, the letters of the name describe Gd's conveying effects of His will from Himself unto us. The final <em>Heh</em>, the <em>Shechinah</em> represents His receiving His presence unto us, allowing us to be aware of and recognize Him. In accepting His presence from Himself unto us, His Shechina playing the role of the female in the metaphor, (<strong><em>Bear in mind the Oneness Principle</em></strong>).</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1. I asked <a href=\"http://www.aish.com/authors/48865682.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Ahron Lopiansky</a> about <a href=\"http://www.hashkafacircle.com/journal/R3_DS_Taku.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Corporealist Rishonim</a>. He said that there are only two that we know of who even mention it as a possibility. One is the Ravad, who mentions corporealism as a mistake that some made. The other is Rav Moshe Taku, who discusses corporealism, but whose extant work is too fragmented to surmise any clear opinion or stance from. First and foremost it is a polemic against rationalism, esotericism, and any other processes of analysis that he felt \"watered down\" the simple meaning of the Bible and the Sages. Any mention of corporealism would then just be an argumentative counter claim to show the holes in such claims.</sup></p>\n\n\n",

Is it the kavanot that the viewer ascribes that is important or is it inherent in a 2D image of a face? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>A photograph can be considered an idol if there's someone who's worshipped it as one, same as most anything else. If it was made by a (halachically non-Jewish) religionist as an idol of his religion's, it's considered such even before it's worshipped (<em>Shulchan Aruch</em>, <em>YD</em> 139:1). Therefore, certain pictures should be assumed to be idols absent knowledge to the contrary (<em>SA</em> 141:1–3); which pictures that rule applies to depends on the time and place (<em>Shach</em> 141:17, <em>Beur Hag'ra</em> :18). But there's nothing inherent in photographs of people that makes them all into idols. As always, for practical questions, contact your rabbi rather than relying on what you read here.</p>\n\n\n",

Another reason may be that it's a readily accessible large square cloth that doesn't look inappropriate.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to Rav Binyomin Shlomo Hamburger Shlit\"a in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3Iz4zDCu2ZASmZSNm5MTVo4WW8/view\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur</a> (45:06), several Rishonim bring the fact that Mitzvas Tzitzis is written right before the words \"When you take a new wife\", as a proof that the marriage is supposed to be done with a Tallis, i.e. the Chuppas Tallis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The chupah is symbolic of the cloud that covered Mount Sinai when Hashem made a covenant with the twelve tribes of Israel. What happened that day was a marriage ceremony in which Hashem married Israel. Torah was the ketubah, the marital agreement, between Hashem and His bride. </p>\n\n<p>In the years that followed this marital covenant, Hashem often accused His Bride of spiritual adultery because Israel was drawn after other gods. Eventually, Hashem divorced the northern ten tribes (Israel) because of this (see Hosea chapter 1). Though He severely disciplined Judah, He spared them from divorce.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, a Hebrew wedding ceremony is symbolic of the ultimate, eternal marriage of Hashem with His people Israel. </p>\n\n<p>Part of the reason a tallit is often used as a covering is the fringes, the tsitsis. In Numbers 15 Hashem tells Israel to make \"fringes\" on the edges of their garments. These fringes symbolize the edges of the cloud of glory over Mount Sinai and they way the light of Hashem would flash through. Psalm 119 equates Torah of Moses with light. This implies that the flashing beams of sunlight coming through the fringes are the light of Hashem that comes into our lives as we obey Him and keep His Torah. Numbers 15:39 say that these fringes are to remind the Israelites of their marriage covenant that we call Torah. Therefore, the tallit and its fringes remind the couple that they are part of a greater, eternal covenant and that they should keep Torah from their hearts all the days of their lives.</p>\n\n\n",

Kol Hator states that Metatron is Yosef.</p>\n\n<p>edit2:</p>\n\n<p>Here's a quote from Rabbi Bakst, who quotes Rav Hillel of Shklov in Kol Hator</p>\n\n<p>The Twin Messiahs are the two pulsating currents of divine  energy  —  din  (or  gevurah)/constriction  and hesed/expansion  —  manifesting  within  the  historical space-time  of  each  and  every  generation.  Although  each messianic  current  is  a  distinct  force  field  of  energy  that appears  to  repulse  the  other,  it  is  the  very  tension  they generate  that, when  channeled  and  directed,  becomes  the most  powerful  force  for  personal,  national,  and  planetary change that has ever existed. Their paradoxical natures are continually present  in  every  thought  and  action,  and  they are waiting to be channeled. </p>\n\n<p>R. Hillel explains</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nA  fundamental  rule  is  that  during  the  performance  of every mitzvah  and  every  tefilah,  one  should  contemplate the unification [of the Trein M’shechin] and bind oneself to the  \"Two  Armies  of  God\" —  [these  being  the  two  divine names]  E-lohim  Tzevaot  (God  of  Armies)  and  Y-HVH Tzevaot  (Lord  of  Armies),  din  (constriction)  and  hesed (expansion). One must [then] calculate the line of balance between their two numerical values — 499½ from the left side and 499½ from the right side.* </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each  of  the  two  messianic  polarities  has  within itself a number of sub-currents  that  interact  together  in a cacophony of pulsating social, political, and religious events </p>\n\n<p>to  generate  the  ever-rising  threshold  of Formula 999.  In a divinely  orchestrated  fashion  they  all  act  according  to specific laws contained within the 156 Aspects of Mashiach ben  Yoseph.  It  is  they  who make  up  the members  of  the Two  Armies  of God.  In Kol HaTor's Messianic Conspiracy, they are the Appointed Agents of God. </p>\n\n<p>R. Hillel writes</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nThe thrice-woven cord of \"Signs,\" \"Designated Times,\" and \"Appointed  Agents\"  appears  simultaneously  in  a  three-pronged  campaign. The \"agents\"  react  to  the  \"signs\"  and thus accelerate the arrival of the \"designated times.\" This is alluded to in the verse, \"The blossoms have appeared in the land; the time of singing has arrived, and kol hator — the call of the turtledove — is heard in the land\" (Song of Songs 2:12).  \"The blossoms have  appeared\" —  these are the  signs;  \"the  time  of  singing has  arrived\" —  these  are the designated times; \"the call of the turtledove  is heard\" — these are the appointed agents.* </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These  agents  are  vehicles  for  the  different  aspects, or  mini-personalities  which,  like  pieces  in  a  puzzle,  only when  they  are  fit  together  constitute  the  totality  of Mashiach ben Yoseph.43 They  include,  for example, names like  Ephraim  ben  Yoseph,  Shirya  ben  Dan,44  Eliyahu HaNavi  (Elijah  the  Prophet),  the  archangels  Gabriel, Sandalfon,  and  <strong>Metatron</strong>,  Neriya,  Menachem,  Ezra  and Nehemiah,  <strong>Yehoshua  ben  Nun</strong>,  Sasson  and  Simcha. (Sasson and Simcha are explained in Chapter 4, Metatron.)  </p>\n\n<p>There  is,  however,  one  all  encompassing Mashiach ben  Yoseph  archetype  that  we  must  mention  briefly. Initially  it  appears  to  confuse  an  already  overly  complex pantheon  of messianic  archetypes,  yet  it  is  precisely  here where all the various aspects of Mashiach ben Yoseph come together. This is the climatic evolution of Formula 999  into the Great Thousand. This is the cosmic image of Moses our Teacher together with the Two Messiahs.  </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\nMy words:\nSo I guess I'm saying that Metatron and Yehoshua Ben Nun are both agents of the Messianic Redemption, and that some of those agents have aspects of the others in them. Hanoch became Metatron, if I'm not mistaken. Maybe Yehoshua Saar Ha-Panim refers to the Metatronic aspect of Yehoshua Ben Nun.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is possibly an allusion to none other than Jesus!

Ovadiyah Yosef quotes this and others who oppose the mention for related reasons in his Yabia Omer (vol. 1 OH 36:18) including R.

Stern opposes saying it, and emphasises the dubious nature of this character, and its absence from any classicla Jewish literature, I don't see him say explicitly that it refers to Jesus.</p>\n\n\n",

Just as this has significance in nature (according to Munk, this refers to the medical view at the time that 7 days was a turning point in illnesses), it is significant for the Torah, because the Torah corresponds to and perfects nature.

Do we force her to marital duties? Is there a base for divorce?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Well, here's Rambam Laws of Husbandhood Ch. 14:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יד,י  [ח] האישה שמנעה בעלה מתשמיש המיטה--היא הנקראת מורדת, ושואלין אותה מפני מה מרדה:  אם אמרה, מאסתיהו ואיני יכולה להיבעל לו מדעתי--כופין אותו להוציא לשעתו, לפי שאינה בשביה שתיבעל לשנוי לה; ותצא בלא כתובה כלל, ותיטול בליותיה הקיימין, בין מנכסים שהכניסה לבעלה ונתחייב באחריותן, בין מנכסים שלא נתחייב באחריותן.  ואינה נוטלת משל בעל כלום; ואפילו מנעל שברגליה ומטפחת שבראשה שלקחן לה, פושטת ונותנת לו.  וכן כל שנתן לה מתנה, מחזרת אותן, שלא נתן לה, על מנת שתיטול ותצא.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>If a woman says: \"my husband is a good man, doesn't beat me, practices perfect hygiene, all of that -- but physically I just find myself convulsing when I get close to him, for no particular reason\", she can demand a divorce (though she wouldn't get her <em>ketubah</em> payment) -- we don't demand celibacy of those who didn't go into the marriage on those terms, and we can't ask her to do something on a regular basis that feels traumatic.</p>\n\n<p>Obviously each couple is going to be different. In some situations, therapy may help. In some, they can determine some arrangement that works well enough for both of them. But if either side absolutely demanded out, a <em>beit din</em> would respect that. If they're asking their pastoral rabbi what to do, he'd assess the particulars of their situation before making a recommendation.</p>\n\n<p>Keep in mind that when it comes to Jewish divorce law, sometimes there's \"what is legal\" and then there is \"what would a good person do in this situation?\" E.g. if she gets sick and her medical bills are high -- by the letter of the law he could figure out how much he would owe her upon divorce, pay that, and throw her to the curb. Ask any rabbi (or the Shulchan Aruch) what the right thing to do is? Don't be a savage. You take care of your wife.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there really a distinct \"Jewish soul\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard many times about Jews having a \"special soul\" or a \"Jewish soul\" - a soul which is either lacking and/or fundamentally different than that of non-Jews.</p>\n\n<p>However, the sources which are pointed to in support of this claim are all later (i.e. more recent) sources which bring no support from Hazal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>My question is:</strong> Is there really a special \"Jewish soul\"? And if so, where is this idea found in the texts of Hazal?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>My knowledge and expertise are certainly not profound enough to answer this question as a real scholar would do. However, let me answer with an in-your-face provocative counter-question:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Is there a distinct \"Amalekite\" soul?</strong> So to say: is a soul bound by its alleged nature to a destiny? Is the free will shadowed by a predestined nature of our soul which we will follow anyway?</p>\n\n<p>The mystical discussion about the soul's essence is interesting. It can, however, become a rather dangerous terrain. To state that there is a distinct Jewish soul bound and attracted by its nature to the Torah's righteous wisdom implies that there must also be the counterpart of such entity, i.e. a soul who is destinated to contrast the divine values and those who represent them. An extreme conclusion of such a scenery would be that there is no right nor wrong. No matter how righteous or wicked you are, no ultimate justice is needed since you ultimately only follow the ways of your soul in a cruel play dictated by a higher entity. I would have no desire to be part of such world. </p>\n\n<p>What if a so-called Jewish soul feels the need to explore other spiritual paths or if such a soul turns against its own \"soul group\" and begins to contrast the Jewish values? What if a soul that follows the ways of Amaleq comes to realise how futile this uphill battle is and begins to explore the paths of righteousness?</p>\n\n<p>The mystical thought elaborates largely the idea of a Jewish soul vs. a gentile soul reaching ideas that can be described with the r-word; many of these ideas have brought really bad reputation to the Jewish theology. Take for example the end part of the 1st chapter of <em>Likutei Amarim</em> in <strong>Tanya</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>כי בישראל נפש זו דקליפה היא מקליפת נוגה, שיש בה גם כן טוב... מה שאין כן נפשות אומות העולם הן משאר קליפות טמאות שאין בהן טוב כלל... כמו שכתוב בעץ חיים שער מ״ט פרק ג׳: וכל טיבו דעבדין האומות לגרמייהו עבדין</p>\n\n<p>(For in Israel the soul <em>k'lipah</em> comes from the k'lipah called <em>nogah</em>, which also contains good...The souls of the nations come from the unclean kelipot which have <strong>no good in them whatever</strong>...as is written in Etz Chayim, Portal 49, ch. 3: <em>and all the good that the nations do is out of selfish motives</em>.)</p>\n\n<p>This daily Tanya lesson can be found [here][1] on Chabad.org</p>\n\n<p>As long as the path of the Torah is seen as The Truth with a specific soul type bound to it by nature the division between Jewish and non-Jewish souls would imply that there is no freedom of choice, no progress, no justice/injustice, only a predestinated play where you are born, live and die as a helpless puppet driven by an uncontrollable instinct. Such a scenery would mean an endless downfall and finally to be condemned to Gehinnom for an unsuccessful \"Jewish soul\" who cannot fulfil the Torah's requirements he's bound and that he/she cannot get rid of. Such a scenery would mean for the other souls that the \"Torah is indeed beoynd the ocean and I cannot do anything to reach it\".</p>\n\n<p>The Tanya, aside from describing the animal soul (mentioned above), which albeit different is common to all humans, discusses a godly soul that only Jews have. A large part of Tanya is the discussion of the conflict and battle between those two souls in a Jew.</p>\n\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"http://m.chabad.org/dailystudy/tanya.asp?tDate=11/28/201\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://m.chabad.org/dailystudy/tanya.asp?tDate=11/28/201</a> 3 </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This question has been discussed extensively by many great Rabbis throughout Jewish history with the majority saying that there really is a <em>distinct</em> \"Jewish soul\". </p>\n\n<p>I suggest you learn the original sources yourself.</p>\n\n<p>To get you started here is the Ramchal:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואמנם כיוון שיש בהם בחינה אנושיית, אף על פי שהיא שפלה, רצה הקב\"ה\n  שיהיה להם מעין מה שראוי לאנושיות האמיתית, והיינו שיהיה להם נשמה כעין\n  נשמות בני ישראל, <strong>אף על פי שאין מדרגתה מדרגת נשמות ישראל אלא שפלה מהם\n  הרבה</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>However since these nations (Gentiles) still have the human aspect, blemished though it may be, so G-d desired that they should at least have a part of what was actually appropriate for the true mankind. He therefore granted them a divine soul somewhat like that of the Jew, even though it is not on the same level as Jewish souls are, but on a much lower level. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why do the Samaritans perform the Passover sacrifice while Jews do not?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Most of the sacrifices which are commanded in the Torah are connected with the Temple, which no longer exists.  Based on the Talmud, we therefore do not make sacrifices.  Instead, we recite prayers with the intention that the words can take the place of the sacrifices.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Paschal sacrifice was given in the Sinai wilderness, before the Temple stood, and the details of the sacrifice do not involve the Temple.  Granted, the Torah commands that all sacrifices be performed on the Temple mount.  But other than this, there is no written connection between the Paschal sacrifice and the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>One reason for the Jews inability to perform the Passover sacrifice throughout the years is the political impossibility of gaining access to the Temple mount for such purposes.  After all, the site has been one of the holiest spots of Islam for more than a millennium.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, it would appear that the Samaritans have continually performed the Paschal sacrifice each year on Mount Gerizim, which was the site of the Temple in the Northern kingdom.  This site, as far as I know, is not a holy site to Muslims, and therefore would have been easier to access over the last millennium or so.  The Samaritans perform the Paschal sacrifice, but not others, because it is the only one which is not associated with the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>Is the reason for this difference in observance between Jews and Samaritans due to accessibility of the Temple mount, or is it something else?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/8876/21\">was discussed previously</a>, <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy Chapter 11</a> makes clear that in the desert, the Jews could do sacrifices wherever. However, once they were firmly settled in the land, G-d would pick one exclusive central point for sacrifices -- which we believe to be the Temple in Jerusalem.

But in connection with Yosef marrying his daughter the Torah emphasizes his being the priest of On, to teach that Pharaoh elevated Yosef so much that he was able to marry a daughter of one of the priests of Egypt, someone who very great in wealth and honor.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In ancient Egyptian society, the role of priest was very important.  Religion guided every aspect of Egyptian life.  Even though ancient Egyptian religion was based on polytheism, the people believed that the gods lived in the temples.  Only priest were allowed to enter the sacred areas and approach statues representing the god or goddess.  </p>\n\n<p>The city of On (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_%28ancient%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">Heliopolis</a>) was one of the oldest cities of ancient Egypt and the capital of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Egypt\" rel=\"nofollow\">13th lower Egyptian nome</a>.  Its name means, \"City of the Sun\" or \"Eye of the Sun\".  Putting that in perspective of the fact that Egypt's primary cult was the cult of Ra and the High Priest of Ra was stationed there.  The High Priest of Ra was known as wr-mꜢw, which is translated as \"Greatest of Seers.\" (Elizabeth Frood, John Baines, Biographical texts from Ramessid Egypt).  </p>\n\n<p>The writer of Genesis may have felt that it was important to know the influential status that Poti-phera had.  Having his daughter (Asenath) taken as a wife, would have suggested how respected Yosef  / Joseph / Zaphenath-paneah became.  This fact illustrates the story of Joseph.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I came across an interesting answer by Rabbi Moshe Ben-Chaim.  The answer presumes Photiphera is the same as Potiphar.  He writes: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>...Pharaoh was in his position - not without intelligence. Upon\n  summoning Joseph from prison to interpret his dreams, Pharaoh was\n  cognizant of the future political problems faced with elevating an\n  imprisoned Jew to viceroy status. More to the point, Pharaoh was\n  appointing one accused of rape. This would not wash well with his\n  subjects, or his country. How would Pharaoh deal with this?   I\n  believe with the following answer, we unveil insight into Pharaoh’s\n  wisdom.   Pharaoh attempted to dispel any rumors of Joseph’s ill\n  repute by giving him this specific woman for a wife. Who in their\n  right minds would believe that Joseph attempted rape of a woman, the\n  wife of Poti-Phera, and then marries her very daughter? Pharaoh caused\n  Egypt to believe that the rape accusation was not true. Further,\n  Poti-Phera’s wife would no longer accuse Joseph, as any accusation\n  would bring shame to her daughter, and to herself. In addition to\n  silencing the wife of Poti-Phera, Pharaoh sought to silence Poti-Phera\n  himself about Joseph’s alleged rape attempt. What do people desire\n  more than anything else? More than money? Power. Pharaoh again\n  displayed his cunning by granting a status of priest to Poti-Phera, in\n  exchange for his silence. At first, Poti-Phera was not referred to in\n  the verses as a “priest”. This is changed afterwards to silence him.\n  Finally, Pharaoh’s changing of Joseph’s name was an attempt to\n  transform his Hebrew slave reputation, into an Egyptian icon. One’s\n  name creates a perceived status.   We now see how these ideas are all\n  connected, and why God desired them to be in one passage. All of the\n  elements in this passage aim towards Pharaoh’s one goal of denying\n  Joseph’s alleged wrongdoings. But what about “Joseph going out on\n  Egypt”? What is the Torah’s lesson of placing it here? I believe it is\n  to show that regardless of Pharaoh’s success in rendering Joseph into\n  a leader acceptable by the Egyptians, Joseph never shed his identity\n  as “Joseph the Righteous”. It was still “Joseph” who went out upon\n  Egypt, and not the fabricated, Egyptian veneer “Zaphnas Paneach”\n  created by Pharaoh...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Most marriages have some unspoken assumptions, but if the couple goes in with this clear understanding, I really don't see the issue. Rambam writes \"you may not marry a woman with plans to soon divorce her, <em>unless she's aware of the plan and okay with it.</em>\" Similarly there's a Gemara about a Kohen who married a woman (actually, several) simply to enable her to eat <em>Terumah</em>. If both sides go in to the marriage with eyes wide open, well, that's what it is.</p>\n\n<p>As for mikvah, we generally recommend that a married woman stay as <em>tahor</em> as reasonably possible, but it's not an all-out requirement. (E.g. if he's on a three-week business trip, the kabbalistically-inclined will say she should wait to dunk until he's almost home; a more cut-and-dry halachist would say she certainly <em>can</em> dunk early if she would like to.) Here's a heartbreaking question to Yoatztot.org, <a href=\"http://www.yoatzot.org/question.php?id=6179\">a couple that's called it quits but won't officially divorce</a> till the kids are married. It's recommended that she continue going to mikvah, but not required. Keep in mind there are other laws besides touching that come into play if she doesn't dunk, e.g. passing objects or even eating at a table for two! Assuming an asexual person still appreciates some sort of non-sexual physical contact (e.g. a back rub), going to mikvah is a good idea. </p>\n\n<p>What's more, Chazon Ish's opinion is that (at least generally speaking) if a newlywed couple had time to consummate their marriage and didn't do so, and then she becomes a <em>nida</em>, the couple is not allowed to sleep alone in the same room -- even in separate beds -- whenever she's a nida, until they consummate their marriage.  I don't know how that opinion would play out in situations like these. (Many other rabbis disagree on this point, e.g. Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef zt\"l.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How is gender halachically determined?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I apologize if this is a sensitive topic, but it seems that this question is foundational to some of the discussions that appear here. I hope that my wording is appropriate.</p>\n\n<p>If I understand correctly, halacha identifies four gender categories (זכר, נקבה, אנדרוגינוס, and טומטום). This status has substantial bearing on practical application of Torah.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect that modern discoveries such as chromosomes and internal imaging are not directly relevant in determining gender according to halacha. So what then is the halachic definition? Is one's sex then determined solely by the visible presence of reproductive organs or other bodily features? If so:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Do internal organs play a role, or only external ones?</li>\n<li>Does one's halachic gender change if one's organs change (either naturally, accidentally, or artificially)?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>The Tzitz Eliezer has a famous responsum (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14509&st=%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%92%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A1&pgnum=176&hilite=\">שו\"ת ציץ אליעזר ח\"י סי’ כ\"ה פרק כ\"ו קטע ו</a>) where he states that we go by the external organs in determining gender, and sex changes are effective in changing one's halachic gender. However, there are other opinions that sex changes do not change halachic gender; I assume that according to these opinions, gender is determined by the genetalia a person is born with, but not by the genetalia a person currently has (see <a href=\"http://www.medethics.org.il/articles/JMEM.6.11.1.pdf\">אנציקלופדיה הלכתית רפואית: נתוח הפיכת מין</a>, especially note 14). Either way, the categories of <em>tumtum</em> and <em>adroginus</em> are still relevant to halacha, since the external organs are a key part of how we determine halachic gender.</p>\n\n<p>For more information, see Rabbi Alfred Cohen's article <a href=\"http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/english/journal/cohen-1.htm\">\"Tumtum And Androgynous\", Journal of Halacha & Contemporary Society XXXVIII; Fall 1999 - Sukkot 5760</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Bigtan and Teresh want to kill the king?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am very puzzled by the whole episode with Bigtan and Teresh (Esther 2:21-23). What exactly made them so mad that they wanted to kill the king? The gemarah (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%92_%D7%91\" rel=\"noreferrer\">megillah 13b</a>) says they were complaining of not getting any sleep because the king was sleeping with Esther every night. Which I assume means their job was to guard the door? So on a night that the king didn't sleep with the queen they weren't guarding the door? Do they not get to sleep during the day? And if their job was to guard the door how were they planning on poisoning the king? Wouldn't the king summon some other servant to bring him food and drink? see Pirkei D'Rebbi Eliezer 50 for full description of their plot. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>The basic answer is that because the king was sleeping with Esther so often he became thirsty very often so they were constantly having to bring him water and then later bring him his lavatory. See <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%92%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94_%D7%99%D7%92_%D7%91#.D7.A8.D7.A9.22.D7.99\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashi's comments on Megillah 13b</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It was their job to both guard the door and supply any of his needs during the night. When he wasn't sleeping with Esther they just guarded the door, but now that he was sleeping with her their workload increased significantly. Since their job was to both guard the door and provide for the kings nighttime needs they were able to have one person slip off to get poison while the other did double duty. See the Ben Yehoyada on the above cited gemarah who goes into great detail of the problem and how the plot was detected. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39923&st=&pgnum=50\" rel=\"nofollow\">Targum to Esther 2:21 says</a> that Bigtan and Teresh were jealous of the many honors given Mordechai by Esther, and worried that they would be replaced by him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>A Chassidic Perspective on Bigtan and Teresh</p>\n<p>The Chassidic Perspective: What’s Really Happening Here?\nChassidus teaches us that every story in the Megillah is more than political drama—it’s a reflection of deeper spiritual dynamics. In this story:</p>\n<p>Achashverosh symbolizes HaKadosh Baruch Hu—the King of all kings.</p>\n<p>Esther represents the Jewish people, particularly in galus, when Hashem’s presence is concealed (hester panim).</p>\n<p>Bigtan and Teresh, the guards of the threshold, symbolize the klipos—forces of spiritual obstruction that try to block or poison our connection to G-d.</p>\n<p>So what’s really happening?</p>\n<p>As the king begins favoring Esther, the relationship between Hashem and Am Yisrael begins to warm. Even in a time of exile and darkness, the inner bond is still alive. And what happens when divine closeness begins to emerge? The klipos panic. They sense that their dominion over concealment is slipping.</p>\n<p>Their loss of \"sleep\" is symbolic—when Hashem begins to “wake up” and connect with Esther, the forces of concealment lose their grip. Klipos cannot “rest” when divine light begins to shine. So they react. They seek to “poison” the king—not physically, but spiritually: to interfere, to inject bitterness or separation between the King and His beloved.</p>\n<p>Mordechai at the Gate: The Power of Daas\nEnter Mordechai. The tzaddik. He sits b’sha’ar hamelech, at the king’s gate—the boundary between concealment and revelation.</p>\n<p>Chassidus teaches that Mordechai represents daas—holy awareness. The Jew who stands alert, even in exile, listening carefully, discerning spiritual threats.</p>\n<p>It is Mordechai who sees through the klipos and reveals their plot. He doesn’t fight with swords—he brings clarity. He brings emes. And through Esther, he channels this truth back to the King.</p>\n<p>A Lesson for Us\nWe all have our inner \"Bigtan and Teresh\"—the voices or energies that whisper bitterness, jealousy, resentment. They thrive when we feel disconnected from Hashem—when we are spiritually asleep.</p>\n<p>But the moment we begin reconnecting—through tefillah, Torah, or a single sincere mitzvah—they stir. They try to pull us back, to poison our sense of closeness. You don’t deserve this connection, they say. It’s not real. You’re not worthy.</p>\n<p>At that moment, we must be like Mordechai. Sit at the gate. Be aware. Uncover the plot. Tell our soul—our inner Esther—that the King still loves us, still wants us near. That’s how we silence the klipos and restore the bond.</p>\n<p>Conclusion\nThe episode of Bigtan and Teresh isn’t a side plot. It’s the battle of exile in miniature. The forces of concealment try to block divine closeness—but the Jew, armed with awareness and loyalty, prevails.</p>\n<p>In our own lives, let us stay awake. Stay close to the gate. And when we sense disruption—when the Bigtans and Tereshes within rise up—let us channel our inner Mordechai and remind ourselves:</p>\n<p>The King still desires Esther.\nHashem still desires a relationship with every Jew.\nAnd no force in the world can stop that love from shining.</p>\n\n\n",

Now I am aware that there is a discussion of cases where lustful pleasure is highly unlikely, e.g. shaking hands in a business setting. However, it seems to be the common practice that men and women will casually touch members of the same sex, since it is assumed that they cannot be attracted to each other at all. What about the case where one or both of the parties has a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality\" rel=\"noreferrer\">homosexual</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisexuality\" rel=\"noreferrer\">bisexual</a>, or <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexuality\" rel=\"noreferrer\">asexual</a> orientation?  How will this change the categories of people that may be touched?</p>\n<p>For clarity, here are two examples to illustrate this question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>May an asexual man touch a woman?

See Tur and SA EH <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.24.1?lang=bi&with=Tur\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bach%2C_Even_HaEzer.24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chelkat_Mechokek.24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ChM</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beit_Shmuel.24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BSh</a> there, as well as Chochmas Adam <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14718&st=&pgnum=338\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">126:14</a>; Aruch HaShulchan EH <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Arukh_HaShulchan%2C_Even_HaEzer.24.6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">24:6</a>; Shu\"T Daas Kohen (Kuk) <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20315&pgnum=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">YD 3</a>. If one knows himself to have homosexual tendencies then indeed he must not be alone with another male, especially if the other male also has such tendencies.\nRegarding an asexual or homosexual man being alone with a woman, it would appear that indeed since he is physically capable of sexual intercourse all Halachos of Yichud would apply. All literature on the issue discuss whether or not one who is physically incapable of sexual intercourse may be lenient regarding Yichud- and even then it's not simple... </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What was Rabbi Judah ben Samuel's method for predicting the Beginning of Messianic Times?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>John Hagee said this on a recent program and in his book <em>The 4 Blood Moons</em> (chapter 16):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Rabbi Judah heHasid – “In the ninth jubilee Jerusalem will once again\n  come back into the possession of the Jewish nation – which will\n  signify the beginning of the Messianic end time.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I (a non-Jewish Christian), recently heard about this incredible Rabbi of the 12th Century who correctly interpreted (or prophesied--I'm not sure which) the rise and fall of the Ottomon Empire, which lasted 400 years. Keep in mind that he predicted both its rise and fall.</p>\n\n<p>First of all, is this quotation accurate?</p>\n\n<p>My main question regards his hermeneutic: in interpreting Jubilees, is he using Gemetria, citing some source I'm not aware of, or is this pure prophecy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First, I think there is a misunderstanding in the question. The Book of Jubilees is not recognized at all in Rabbinic Judaism (although Wikipedia records some speculation that as late as the 12th century some authors of Medrashim had access to it), rather the reference, if it exists, is to the concept of a Jubiliee year (meaning a 49 or 50 year period of time).</p>\n\n<p>Second, the 12th century Rabbi Yehuda HaChasid himself writes in his work Sefer HaChassidim (<a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41862&st=&pgnum=156&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">206</a>) that anyone who prophesies a specific time of Moshiach is, at best, using Kabbalistic* techniques which will yield him the wrong answer and embarrass him and all who follow him. Although this may have been in reaction to a specific astrologer that he didn't want to name so that no one would think that he credits him in any area, this is still a fairly strong indication that prophecy was not involved.</p>\n\n<p>If the quote is accurate, it is probably in a book written by a student of his, quoting his teachings, called Sefer Gematriot, which as the title indicates is a book about Gematria. I don't have access to it to check.</p>\n\n<p><sub>* Today we would call that Kabbalistic, although it is a bit anachronistic in this context, I'm using the word for clarity, it literally means using G-d's name to communicate with angels. He says the angels will deliberately mislead.</sub></p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This story originated and was first publicized by the Jewish Christian and long time Christian Missionary to the Jews, Ludwig Schneider, on page 18 in the March 2008 edition of Israel Today Magazine. <a href=\"http://issuu.com/ryaninzion/docs/israel_today_march_2008\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is the link.</p>\n\n<p>He states clearly that this is found in Sefer HaGematriyot of Rabbi Yehuda HaChassid (Yehudah ben Shmuel).</p>\n\n<p>I have the sefer and to date have been unsuccessful in locating the citation he refers to. When I have questioned anyone, Jew or otherwise, as to the precise citation, no one seems to be able to produce an exact page or parsha. The book is long and the gematriot and other tzerufim are numerous. I will, bli neder, continue to go through the sefer and if and when I find the citation, will report back.</p>\n\n<p>To complete the report on this citation, it does not exist in Sefer HaGematriot of Rabbi Yehuda HaChasid. So the report from Ludwig Schneider is false.</p>\n\n<p>The actual source for this concept is from the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14252&st=&pgnum=178\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Volume 2, parshat VaEra, page 32a</a> beginning with the words <strong>ות״ח, ארבע מאה שנין</strong>. It is a statement of Rabbi Yossi said in the name of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai. It explains that the 400 years which are derived from the 8 Yovelot correspond to the reward due to Yishmael for the fact that he was circumcised by Avraham. The normal time for circumcision (Milah) is on the 8th day after birth. Since Yishmael was already 13 years old, he isn't credited with proper fulfillment.</p>\n\n<p>Schneider says this is a calculation relating to a 400 year empire that would rule over Jerusalem. The Ottoman Turkish Empire, which was formed by Osman I in 1299, didn't exist at the time of Yehudah HaChassid's death in 1217. Osman I lived from 1258-1326. So whatever reference Rabbi Yehudah HaChassid might have made is not about the Turkish Empire. It would be generic. If the citation is accurate, the association to the Turkish Empire is speculation by Schneider.</p>\n\n<p>For the time being, the time line stated by Schneider is the following:</p>\n\n<p>He says, Allenby conquered Jerusalem from the Ottoman Turkish empire on the first day of Hanukkah, December 9, 1917 (24 Kislev 5678). He counts back 400 years which he says corresponds to 8 Yovelot (Jubilees). There is a Torah sourced basis for this 50 years per Yovel calculation. That places the year at 1517 (15 Kislev 5278) which corresponds with the approximate time frame that Selim I of the Ottoman Empire conquered the area  of the Middle East which included Jerusalem from Shah Ismail of the Safavid Persian Empire.</p>\n\n<p>The significance of the removal of control of Jerusalem from the Muslims, the Ottoman Turkish empire is based upon Yechezkel 46:17.</p>\n\n<p>וכי־יתן מתנה מנחלתו לאחד מעבדיו והיתה לו עד־שנת הדרור ושבת לנשיא אך נחלתו בניו להם תהיה</p>\n\n<p>\"But if he gives a gift from His inheritance (meaning Yerushalayim, the undivided Capital of the land of Israel) to one of His servants, it shall be his until the year of liberty; then it shall return to the prince. His inheritance shall be only his sons'; it shall belong to them.\"</p>\n\n<p>The 'Prince' (Nasi) being referred to here is an abbreviation of 'Nitzutz Shel Yaacov Avinu\". It means the entire Jewish people as a single entity, the idea of 'Tzibbur'. And so Yovel (Shnat HaDror) starts to be counted either when the 'possession' begins to be removed from the servant (the Islamic Caliphate), which would be 1917 or when it actually comes into the possession of the the nation of Israel (the children), which would be 1967.</p>\n\n<p>Schneider points out that from 1917 until 1967, another Yovel of 50 years, Jerusalem was like a \"no mans land\" with control shifting between Britain and Jordan. During that time period, the modern state of Israel was established on May 14, 1948 (5 Iyar 5708). And then, on June 7, 1967 (28 Iyar 5727), Jerusalem was reunited under the Jewish state's control during the Six Day War with Rabbi Shlomo Goren actually ascending the Temple Mount and blowing shofar from the Dome of the Rock.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.vilnagaon.org/mount/goren_history.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.vilnagaon.org/mount/goren_history.html</a></p>\n\n<p>To complete this picture, Christians also try to connect this with the blood moon prophecies found in Yoel 3:3-4, 4:1-15. These particular prophecies speak to days of judgement for the nations of the world. Yoel 3:3 in particular is classically associated with the beginning of the first of three wars that comprise the Wars of Gog u'Magog. (See Sefer Avkat Rochel by Rabbeinu Makir ben Abba Mori, Book 1, Signs 1 through 5. It seems to be associated with the detonation of the two Atomic bombs at Hiroshima and Nagasaki which began on August 6, 1945 (27 Av 5705). The \"Date Palm trees of smoke\" corresponding with the \"Mushroom Clouds\". The shape is the same.</p>\n\n<p>As is known, following shortly on the heels of the reestablishment of the modern state of Israel, a blood moon cycle started on April 13, 1949 (14 Nisan 5709). This also happened again just before the reunification of Jerusalem on April 24, 1967 (14 Nisan 5727).</p>\n\n<p>As is common knowledge, we just completed another blood moon cycle this last Sukkot, September 28, 2015 (15 Tishrei 5776).</p>\n\n<p>It is worth pointing out that the conclusion of this section of Zohar quoted above says that following this period where the Bnai Yishmael merit to occupy the land of Israel during its desolation, they will precipitate three very harsh wars in the world. One is <em>by Sea</em>, and one is <em>by Dry Land</em> and the third is about <em>Support of Jerusalem</em>. And it says Israel will not be delivered into the hands of the <em>Bnai Edom</em> in these conflicts.</p>\n\n<p>These first three conflicts appear to be associated with what are called the Gulf War (<em>by Sea</em>), August 1990-February 1991, and Desert Storm (<em>by Dry Land</em>), January 1991-February 1991. The third element of this conflict resulted from the attacks on Jerusalem by Saddam Hussein by firing Scud missiles. This emboldened the Palestinians and Hezbollah to continue rocket and missile type attacks against Israel. This third stage continues to this day.</p>\n\n<p>The Zohar continues and says that during this time period, one nation from the ends of the earth will make a war against Rome (<em>the capital of Edom</em>) which will cause all the Bnai Edom from the whole world to come and fight them. It says this conflict is associated with the posuk from Isaiah 34:6 which says HaShem makes a sacrifice of Basra. It says at the conclusion of this conflict all of Bnai Yishmael will be removed from the land of Israel by HaShem.</p>\n\n<p>This additional conflict coincides with the Afghanistan War (September 11, 2001 to the present) and the second Iraq War (March 2003 to the present). The Afghanistan War started with the attacks on both New York City, <em>the financial capital</em> of the United States and Washington DC, <em>the political capital</em> of the United States. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Basra_(2008)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">city of Basra</a> in Iraq has been an ongoing center of conflict since the second Iraq War broke out through the influence of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_Companies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Mahdi Army</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can the promise to repay through a credit card be considered a guarantee for a loan to a Gemach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Money Gemachs typically insist on at least one guarantor before they make a loan. \nSomeone needing a loan, suggests to the Gemach that his guarantor will be his credit card. He is using the Gemach to avoid using the credit card. If when the loan to the Gemach needs to be repaid, he does not have the funds, he says that he will repay it by taking out a credit card loan. </p>\n\n<p>Assuming that the Gemach accepts that he can be trusted to do this, is it permitted to make him a loan?  Do we say that by delaying the point at which he has to pay interest, the Gemach has served a useful purpose or do we say that by accepting the credit card as a guarantor, we are going against part of the idea of a Gemach? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Mitzva of lending a person money is based on the pasuk \"Im Kesef Talveh Ess Ami\" (You Shall Lend Money To My People) (Shemos 22:24)</p>\n\n<p>However the lender has a right to demand proper collateral for his loan to guarantee that it will be paid back in a timely manner. If the lender is <em>not satisfied</em> with the guarantees provided, he has no obligation to lend, even if the borrower is a poor person.</p>\n\n<p>So if the Money Gemach is satisfied with the persons promise there is no reason to deny him the loan. (I am assuming that the rules that govern the Money Gemach allow for such a dispensation and don't require a another person to sign as a third-party guarantor)</p>\n\n<p>The Chafetz Chaim writes in Ahavas Chessed that even if the person requesting the loan is wealthy and by lending him money you prevent him from incurring a loss it's mitzvah to lend them money <em>(Ahavas Chessed \"Introduction to the attribute of Chesed - Siman 3 + footnote 5)</em></p>\n\n<p>So by lending the person money even if ultimately he will need to take a credit card loan with interest to pay it back, but by giving him the loan you have pushed off that event, the Mitzvah of Gemach has still been performed.</p>\n\n<p>I hope this addresses your questions.</p>\n\n<p>Sources:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.torah.org/advanced/business-halacha/5757/vol1no10.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.torah.org/advanced/business-halacha/5757/vol1no10.html</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01815.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01815.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

This refers to the angelic minister who represents the Egyptian nation in the Heavens. On the other hand, when the Torah refers to Pharaoh or Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim, this refers to the human king of the Egyptians. Following this approach, the Zohar explains that when the Torah reports “…and Melech Mitzrayim died…” (Exodus 2:23), this does not refer to the death of the earthly King of Egypt, but to the removal of the Egyptians’ Heavenly minister from its prominence. Only once G-d demoted the Egyptians’ Heavenly representative did He begin to listen to the Jews’ prayers for redemption.</li>\n  <li>Rav Chaim Kanievsky offers a comprehensive discussion about the three different ways in which the Bible refers to the Pharaoh. He explains that when the Pharaoh was acting on behalf of national interests, then he is referred to as Melech Mitzrayim. In contrast, when Pharaoh’s actions are motivated by his own, selfish interests (be that his self-aggrandizement or simply his pathological stubbornness), then he is called Pharaoh. When both of these factors played a role, then the king is known as Pharaoh Melech Mitzrayim.</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>the author does not cite the location of R' Kanievsky's comments</p>\n\n\n",

If they are, how should indivisible assets be dealt with? Is there a specific \"tax year\"? What expenses are allowed? How is capital investment to be dealt with? How are charities defined, and is there an order of priorities in the matter?

    "content": "# The Fourth Exile, Persia or Rome?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When Avraham experiences a vision of 'fear, darkness, great, descending upon him', (Gen 15:12), the Midrash says that these four words refer to the 4 exiles. Fear is Babylon, darkness is Medea, great is Greece, and descending is Rome, (Gen rabah 44:17).</p>\n\n<p>Both of the Targumim that expound upon this verse designate Persia as the 4th exile, corresponding to 'descending', (Gen 15:12).</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the reason for this discrepancy?</strong> Did the Targumim not know about the Roman exile? </p>\n\n<p>I suppose it is possible that this passage was composed before the Roman exile, meaning that up until the Roman exile, the persian exile was identified as the fourth exile, as it could have very well been the final exile. Once the second temple was destroyed, however, the Roman exile replaced it, and the Persian exile was clumped together with the Medean, hence the generally used term Persian-Medean exile, (hearsay, source needed). I have no source for this answer other than my own thoughts. Has anyone encountered sources that address this directly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Roman exile is fitting for Jews living in Europe, in the Christian culture adopted by the Roman empire. At the same time, many Jews resided in Bavel, which was a part of the Persian Empires, such a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Partian</a> and then <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sasanian_Empire\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sasanian</a>. That's where the gemara was written and many midrashim got edited, and many generations of sages lived including the geonim.</p>\n<p>Due to constant wars with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">East Roman / Bysantine empire</a>, both Sasanians and in part Bysantines got to the point when they did not have enough soldiers to hold weapons and both started training the Arabs to continue the wars. At the end the Arabs united and destroyed the Sasanian empire and took over vast territories of the Bysantine empire. Even after adopting Islam as their main religion, Persian scientists and philosophers such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avicenna\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avicenna</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferdowsi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ferdowsi</a> and others, had tremendous impact on Islamic culture, troughout centuries.

Based on these considerations, one can accept the words Targum Jonathan and Targum Jerusalem, that the forth exile is the Persia.</p>\n\n\n",

He cites the wife of Rabbi Elazar Brebi Shimon's wife, B. Metz 84b, who inspected her dead husband's hair regularly. Obviously both Abraham and Sarah are dead during this story. It would seem that There is some sort of interaction or connection between a couple after death.</p>\n\n<p>The Ben Jehoaida, writes that the whole experience was a dream to be interpreted allegorically, and that it refers to how Abram's name was changed to Abraham by way of a <em>heh</em> that was taken from the <em>yud</em> at the end of Sarah's name, and how that <em>heh</em> interacts with the <em>aleph</em> of Abraham's name.

Rather, it is the \"act of death\" that ends the connection.  Therefore, Eliyahu who did not have an \"act of death\" is still connected to his wife.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did Levi see Moshe and Aaron?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow\">Exodus 6:16</a> states that Levi lived for 137 years. The Targum Yonatan, (ibid) says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ואלין שמהת בנוי דלוי לייחוסיהון גרשון קהת ומררי ושני חיוי דלוי מאה ותלתין ושבע שנין <strong><em>חייא עד דחמא ית משה וית אהרון פריקייא דישראל</em></strong>.‏</p>\n  \n  <p><em>... he lived until he saw Moses and Aaron the saviors of Israel.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Moses was 80 the year that the Israelites left Egypt and aaron was 83. Out of the 210 year exile, (Start from Isaac who had Jacob at 60, Jacob was 130 when he arrived in Egypt = 190. Gd told Abraham 400 years of exile, 400-190 = 210). This means that Moses was born in the 130th year of exile, and Aaron was born the 127th year of exile. (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9868#showrashi=true&v=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ex 7:7</a>, see also <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9863#showrashi=true&v=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rashi Ex 2:1</a> and <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8210#showrashi=true&v=13\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen 15:13</a>). </p>\n\n<p>In order for Levi to have seen Moses, he would have had to be 7 or younger when he arrived with Jacob in Egypt. That is not possible though, because We know that Levi was older than Josef, (See <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0129.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen 29</a> -30, ), who was 30 when appointed by Pharaoh as viceroy, (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0141.htm#46\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen 41:46</a>), and 39 when his father arrived, counting 7 years of plenty and 2 years of famine ,(ibid 45:6).</p>\n\n<p>Levi would then have had to be older than 169, (Joseph was 39 + 130 years until Moses' birth).</p>\n\n<p><strong>How is this reconciled?</strong> Is it possible that The verse ennumerates Levi's years from when he arrived in Egypt? Is there a different understanding of the 400 count told to Abraham, and consequently the 210 years in Egypt, which could allow for this?</p>\n\n<p>The Ramban, (Ex 12:42) offers alternative counts, resulting in 240, or 220ish years of exile in Egypt, but that only exacerbates the problem, requiring Levi to be at least 199, or at least 179.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks for any ideas!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Perush Yonason asks this question and does not give an answer.

Hochman understands the <em>Targum</em> to be saying the the longevity of Levi, Kehat and Amram was evidence of they're being of those <em>Benei Aliyah</em>, and through their excellence they were able to spiritually see the souls of Mosheh and Aharon, Pinchas (Eliyahu), and the sons of Rechavyah( mentioned in the <em>Targum [Pseudo-]Yonatan</em> on v. 20) respectively, years before the latter were even born.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Notice that the verses stating Levi's, Kehath's, and Amram's years don't mention death<sup>1</sup>, so one  could argue that the years listed do not account for all of their years, but only for a portion of them. Also notice that in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">this listing</a> of individuals, they are the only people whose years are mentioned, which causes these years to stand out, open to interpretation.

He explains that the additional years are not considered a part of Levi's life because only years lived predominately by way of a person's granted strength are attributed to them. The additional years, since they came from elsewhere, (a purely supernatural endowment?), and went above and beyond Levi's natural lifespan, are not attributed to him<sup>3</sup>. The author uses the Talmud in Erachin as a source for this concept, (exact source needed). This concept is only applied to Levi by the author, and not to Kehath or Amram, explicitly.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>1.</strong> <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0206.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ex 6:16,18,20</a>.

It has big-name rabbis and a good number of other speakers, loosely (and sometimes not so loosely) on one theme; while the theme is never 'pure' Torah study, it is always Torah-based, and the speeches include Torah thoughts. The main speeches are Thursday night and Saturday night; a number of people go only for one or both of those nights. There are also <em>shiurim</em>, 'pure' Torah classes. It takes place somewhere in the general vicinity of New York City (i.e., within driving distance). Audiorecordings of all non-<i>Shabas</i> events are available soon after each year's convention from AIA (I think from its Reshet Shiurei Torah / Torah Projects Commission): +1-212-797-9000.

    "content": "# Making a Bracha on pleasurable things\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A couple lines up from the bottom of the first daf of Keitzad Mevarchin, the Gemarah gives its reason for making Brachas. Its answer (my translation) is \"It is forbidden for a person to get pleasure from this world without a Bracha\". With this in mind, suppose I get a lot of pleasure from playing hockey. Why don't I make a Bracha? (Hockey is just used as a possible example)</p>\n\n<p>As always, please cite your sources.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Rashi - Berachos 35b s.v. אזוקי מזיק</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>דגבי ברכה ואכלת כתיב</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that the reason you do not make a blessing on drinking oil is that it is not considered an act of eating, and the paradigm of blessings on which Chazal based their creation is associated with eating.</p>\n\n<p>This Rashi would explain the lack of extension to other pleasures, but does not explain why smells have blessings.  I would conjecture that maybe Chazal created blessings in things <em>like</em> eating, where there is ingestion - smelling is the olfactory absorption of follicles of the object being smelled.  This would exclude all other pleasures.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Tosefos - Pesachim 53b s.v. אין מברכין</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הקשה הר\"ר יוסף למה אין מברכין בכל שעה שנהנה ממנו, דאסור ליהנות מן העוה\"ז בלא ברכה, ותירץ דה\"מ כשגופו נהנה אבל שאר הנאה לא</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Tos' explains that you do not make a blessing on enjoying the light of a flame because the prohibition to enjoy is only on pleasures that the body gets a tangible pleasure from.   This would rule out playing or watching sports and the like, but would still not explain something like a hot shower. </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>בית יוסף סימן ריז סעיף ג</strong> echoes this idea of Tosefos, but his parameters allow a more flexible application.  In explaining the opinion of the Rambam that you do not make a blessing on a ריח שאין לו עיקר:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אינו צורך הגוף כל כך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"It is not such a need of the body\" - only bodily needs that meet a certain critical point of enjoyment are included, such as strong smells and foods.</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>גליוני הש\"ס</strong> to Berachos 35a discusses that there should be a blessing on marital relations, and concludes that Birkas Ha'erusin accomplishes that.  It would seem he held this concept can extend to other pleasures, although this could still be in the realm of \"a need of the body.\"</p>\n\n<p>The <strong>מגיד תעלומות</strong> in his commentary to the Rif in Berachos 35a, partially quoting his father in law, says that really there should have been blessings on a number of pleasures, but for technical reasons they were not made.  He gives the example of marital relations, which he says are not meant to be for pleasure but rather for the mitzvah, and therefore even when it is for pleasure it would be inappropriate to establish a blessing for it as that would imply condoning the involvement for the sake of pleasure.  However, he does conclude that it would be appropriate to make a Shehakol on something else before engaging in relations, and that would \"cover\" the other pleasures as well.  This could be the source for the idea mentioned in a comment above that one should make a Shehakol on something before taking a shower.  However, it is difficult to extend this to non-bodily pleasures, as above.  On the other hand, there doesn't seem to be any reason why not to do it.</p>\n\n\n",

While digs have not turned up much Jewish sculpture, archeologists have discovered much fine art on coins, for example.  Also, depictions of the menorah on coins and lanterns were very common.  However, the idea that it is forbidden for Jews to make artistic renditions of people or things in nature gets seriously undermined once you look at the artistic works left behind at the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dura-Europos_synagogue\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dura Europos synagogue</a> (Syria, 3d century CE), or the 6th century CE <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beth_Alpha\" rel=\"nofollow\">Beit Alpha</a> synagogue, located not far from Beit Shaan, or the 4th-5th century CE synagogue in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susiya\" rel=\"nofollow\">Susiya</a> (near Hebron).

Similarly, the Hand of G-d appears in mosaics in Susiya and Beit Alpha.</p>\n\n<p>The Beit Alpha synagogue also has a depiction of the Zodiac -- something I saw in a late-19th century or early 20th century Orthodox synagogue in Toronto.</p>\n\n<p>BTW, I've been to Susiya and it is usually open for guided tours during chol hamoed of major festivals.

Also, no art-making on shabbat, right? That's hard for me--I love to write.

    "content": "# What parts of the Septuagint are and are not reliable?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>As noted in this Mi Yodeya <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18819/translation-to-greek\">discussion</a>, the Greek translation of the Torah was done by 70 rabbis who each separately took identical precautions to avoid giving idolators and minim a chance to misuse the Torah for their own purposes.  Christians seem to believe that the rest of the Tanach was translated into Greek by the same scholars. Is that true?  </p>\n\n<p>If not, who did the translations of the Kesuvim and N'viim?  </p>\n\n<p>Is the Septuagint used today by the Greek Orthodox Church considered a reliable translation? </p>\n\n<p>If parts are not reliable (an accurate translation from a Jewish perspective), what parts and why? </p>\n\n<p>For example:  As I understand it, at Isaiah 7:14 the Septuagint uses the Greek word <em>parthenos</em> for the Hebrew word עלמה and Christian readers assume that both words mean \"virgin\" (when neither is that specific).  But, I also understand that the Septuagint used the same word to describe Dinah <em>after</em> she was raped, accordingly, it cannot mean \"virgin.\"  Is this a correct understanding, or were the translators who created the Septuagint versions of N'viim and Kesuvim actually Christians with their own agenda?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>I'll try to answer this question by quoting from Tov, E. (2001). <em>Textual criticism of the Hebrew Bible</em>. (2nd ed.). Minneapolis: Augsberg Fortress. In Tov's words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>The Septuagint is a Jewish translation which was made mainly in Alexandria.</strong></em> Its Hebrew source differed greatly from the other textual witnesses (the Masoretic text, the Targumim, the Peshitta, the Vulgate, and many of the Qumran texts)... [It] is important as a source for early exegesis, and this translation also forms the basis for many elements in the New Testament. (p. 134)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Tov, the Septuagint (or at least the core part) was a Jewish translation, though the text it was based on differed from the Masoretic text in some places. It was later used by the Christians for their own agendas, but this does not mean that it had a non-Jewish agenda originally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Septuagint is known in various languages as the translation of the seventy (two elders). Its traditional name reflects the tradition that seventy two elders translated the Torah into Greek... In the first centuries CE this tradition was expanded to include all of the translated biblical books, and finally it encompassed all of the Jewish-Greek scriptures...</p>\n<p>According to the generally accepted explanation of the testimony of the Epistle of Aristea, <strong>a translation of the Torah was carried out in the third century BCE</strong>... The translation of the books of the Prophets, Hagiographa, and apocryphal books came after that of the Torah, for most of these translations use its vocabulary, and quotations from the translation of the Torah appear in the Greek translations of the Latter Prophets, Psalms, Ben Sira, etc. Since the Prophets and several of the books of the Hagiographa were known in their Greek version to the grandson of Ben Sira at the end of the second century BCE, we may infer that <strong>most of the books of the Prophets and Hagiographa were translated in the beginning of [the second century BCE] or somewhat earlier...</strong></p>\n<p>[The Septuagint] also contains revisions (recensions) of original translations. <strong>These revisions were made from the first century BCE onwards until the beginning of the second century CE.</strong> (pp. 136–137)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the later sections of the Septuagint did indeed have different authors from the original translation of the Torah, but they were all authored before the advent of Christianity, and apparently used by Jews. Later on some versions of the Septuagint were revised, and some of these revisions were after Christianity was born. Tov explains elsewhere that some of these revisions were clearly Jewish; for example, the revision of Aquila (who might have been the famous Onkelos) was used in synagogues until the sixth century CE. Other recensions were authored by Christians, e.g. that of Lucian of Antioch in 312 CE.</p>\n<p>What can we say about the versions of the Septuagint used today? There exist academic editions known as <em>critical</em> editions which try to reconstruct the original text free of the influence of later recensions; I infer that these are unlikely to contain Christian influence, since the pre-revision text of the Septuagint was Jewish. As for the version used by the Greek Orthodox Church, I am not sure to what extent it is affected by Christian recensions, or whether they would contain any objectionable ideological intrusions in the first place. In any case, it seems to me that if one wanted to consider the Septuagint in a Jewish context, it would be most appropriate to use a critical edition so as to avoid foreign influence.</p>\n<p>As to whether the translation is \"reliable\" -- I'm not sure what that term means or how to evaluate it, besides knowing that the Septuagint was originally written and used by Jews. It does seem natural that Jews became less comfortable with it after it was appropriated by the Christians. As Tov explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The first Christians quite naturally chose the Septuagint as their Holy Writ and as the source for additional writings since Greek was their language. As a result, [it] influenced them not only by the content of the translation in general, but also by its terminology. The frequent use of the Septuagint by the Christians caused the Jews to dissociate themselves from it and to initiate new translations. (p. 143)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, there are texts such as Ben Sira that were written by Jews in the pre-Christian era that we do not accept as canon, so perhaps the Septuagint should have a similar status: interesting and potentially valuable, but not infallible. Also, keep in mind that we do often use the Targum Yerushalmi, despite the fact that it has plenty of \"translations\" which clash with the other traditional sources. But in any case, my speculation about how we should view the Septuagint is just that -- speculation.</p>\n<p>In summary, I don't see a reason to be suspicious of the Septuagint itself, as long as one reads it in a Jewish context without the \"baggage\" that Christians come to the table with, and uses a critical edition or the recension of Aquilas (or some other Jewish recension). However, I can't say how much regard it should be given either.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The original Septuagint, translated by rabbis more than 22 centuries ago, was of the Pentateuch alone, and not the Books of the Prophets, such as Isaiah. </p>\n\n<p>The Talmud states this explicitly in Tractate Megillah (9a). </p>\n\n<p>Josephus as well, in his preface to Antiquities of the Jews, affirms that the Septuagint was a translation only of the Law of Moses.</p>\n\n<p>This is also indicated in the \"Letter of Aristeas\", which is the earliest attestation to the existence of the Septuagint.</p>\n\n<p>In his preface to the Book of Chronicles, the Church father Jerome, who was the primary translator of the Vulgate, concedes that in his day there were at least THREE VARIANT Greek translations of the Bible: the edition of the third century Christian theologian Origen, as well as the Egyptian recension of Hesychius and the Syrian recension of Lucian.</p>\n\n<p>Another red flag to those inquiring into the Jewishness of the Septuagint, is the fact that additional books known as the Apocrypha, not reckoned as canonical by the Jews anywhere, but are uniquely sacred to the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Church, are found in the Septuagint.</p>\n\n<p><strong><em>Is the Septuagint used today by the Greek Orthodox Church considered a reliable translation?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong><em>If parts are not reliable (an accurate translation from a Jewish perspective), what parts and why?</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>We have no idea exactly when the remaining texts of the Bible were translated into Greek, and who were the translators, and were they reliable? Most importantly, we have no proof that the text of LXX promulgated today is precisely the same as when it was produced.</p>\n\n<p>Given the above, that today's version of the Septuagint seems to have been tampered with, \nthen there's <strong>nothing</strong> in it that can be considered reliable. It is recognized as a <strong>CORRUPT</strong> text. Its integrity has been impugned, making it largely irrelevant in Jewish circles.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>For the views of Christians concerning the Septuagint, consult 'Septuagint Version' in <em>Catholic Encyclopedia</em> (online), <em>International\nStandard Bible Encyclopedia</em> (online), <em>The Anchor Bible Dictionary</em>, <em>The New Interpreter's Bible Dictionary</em>, and <em>The Oxford Companion to the Bible</em>. For a scholarly Jewish viewpoint, consult <em>Encyclopedia Judaica</em> and <em>Jewish Encyclopedia</em> (online). \nAll of these sources make clear that only the first five books were the original Septuagint and that the term came later to signify all of the books in the current version.</p>\n\n<p>The Septuagint is considered inspired by Eastern Orthodox Christianity, but not by Roman Catholics and Protestants, who both have used the Massoretic Text for their translations.</p>\n\n<p>The LXX's translation of Hebrew Isaiah 7:14 is a principal difference from Jewish translations.  <em>Ha-'almah</em> means 'the young woman', not 'the virgin', <em>pace</em> Matthew 1:22-23. The New American Bible, Revised Edition (2011) states at Isaiah 7:14:. 'The Septuagint translated the Hebrew term [<em>'almah</em>] as <em>parthenos</em>, which normally does mean virgin, and this translation underlies Mt 1:23.' </p>\n\n<p>The LXX also has seven more books than the Hebrew Bible which are considered inspired: <em>I</em> and <em>II Maccabees</em>, <em>Tobit</em>, <em>Judith</em>, and <em>Ecclesiasticus/Ben Sira</em>, <em>The Book of Wisdom</em> and <em>Baruch</em>. And <em>Daniel</em> and <em>Esther</em> are longer than the versions in the Hebrew Bible; <em>Jeremiah</em> is shorter.</p>\n\n<p>See NETS - Electronic Edition.com for the recent major translation of the Septuagint published by Oxford University Press. 'This electronic edition contains the masters of the second printing of A New English Translation of the Septuagint, as published by Oxford University Press in 2009, including corrections and emendations made in the second printing (2009) and corrections and emendations made in June 2014.'</p>\n\n<p><strong>In sum, every part of the LXX which does not agree with the Massoretic Text is unreliable. To demonstrate that fully would take a book to answer.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Why does Rashi tell us this bit of seemingly trivial information? To answer our question:</p>\n\n<p>Hashem allowed Noach and everything in the ark to escape the waters of destruction, but it appears that it wasn't enough that they were protected by the ark, they had to actually escape the destructive sphere of the waters, which was until the top of the mountains. The waters above that level were not destructive because above the mountains there was nothing left to destroy.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Hashem continued with the deluge until the ark was raised above this sphere. And since we know from Chazal that the domain of a person extends four amos in each direction, Noach and the ark had to be four amos above the sphere of destruction, that is, four amos above the mountains. And since, as Rashi proves, the ark was submerged in the water 11 amos, the total height of the waters needed for Noach to escape was 15 amos. So it seems to me.</p>\n\n\n",

He said that if looking for a source, the <a href=\"http://halakhah.com/shabbath/shabbath_33.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud in Shabbos 33a</a> was pertinent. He never acknowledged this as a definitive source, though:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>Said R. Hanan b. Rabbah: All know for what purpose a bride enters the bridal canopy, yet against whomsoever who speaks obscenely [thereof], even if a sentence of seventy years' happiness had been sealed for him,  it is reversed for evil.</em> </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Alex's accepted answer to <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/14635/what-is-the-conceptual-definition-of-tzniut\">this question</a> about tzniut, modesty, mentions the idea that what is private should remain private, citing biblical verses, and the Talmud.</p>\n\n<p>I think the delicate nature of certain topics, namely sexuality, is evidenced further in <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=nedarim&daf=20a\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 20a-b</a>, where Ima Shalom describes the reverent practices of her husband, R' Eliezer, during marital relations, as a reason for her children's beauty. A saying of R' Yohanan in <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=succah&daf=52b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 52b</a> bears mentioning as well: </p>\n\n<p><em>\"A person has a small organ. If he starves it, it is  satisfied. If he feeds it, it is hungry\"</em></p>\n\n<p>The idea seems to be that approach to a person's sexuality a dangerous thing, because indulgence only increases, rather than sating, one's desire. So one must be very careful when it comes to this area.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Rabbi Lopiansky has dismissed the following as the wrong source, as this pertains specfically to matters of kiddushin, jewish marriage, and not to specific activities in a non-forbidden context:</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah on <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=chagiga&daf=11b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagiga 11b</a>, (cited by Double AA in the comments on the question), states that one may not expound upon forbidden sexual relationships before three pupils. Rashi explains that this refers to forbidden sexual relationships that are not clearly mentioned in the verses, but are derived from them. He cites <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=sanhedrin&daf=75a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 75a</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In the gemarah, the reason given is that while the rabbi is speaking with one of the students, the other two students will be able to talk amongst themselves, rather than listen to the rabbi, and due to the underlying bias of perpetual sexual desire, they may arrive at the permission of something that is prohibited.</p>\n\n<p>In a broader sense, it would seem that in the absence of a rabbinic authority, discussing topics of sexuality may lead to forbidden sexual activity.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What sin did Jesus do?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I know Christians believe that Jesus is God and that's kind of a no-no in Judaism. The thing is, Jesus himself did not say he is God.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Well, there are esoteric things. For example, he said that, \"I and the father are one\". Well, Kabbalah also says that Israel, God and Torah are one.</p>\n\n<p>He declared that sin is forgiven. Then he claimed that \"son of man\" can indeed forgive sin. This seems to \"imply\" that he claims that he is God. But not necessarily. \"Son of man\" may be someone else. Forgiving sin may be something many angels can do. You can check more <a href=\"http://www.josh.org/resources/study-research/answers-to-skeptics-questions/did-jesus-claim-to-be-god/\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>: the site tries to convince people that Jesus did claim to be God, but even the strongest claim are vague.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, Jesus' claim that he is God is always very circumstantial. It's never direct and can have many meaning. On the other hand, <a href=\"http://userwww.service.emory.edu/~cmadd01/jcsaygod.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">this site</a> argues that Jesus simply tried to convey that he is a prophet or God's representative.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Then there is this son-of-God thing. Nephilim are also called sons of God. It could mean many things.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Jesus said to love your enemy which differ from rabbinical teaching. Perhaps he means that we should have mercy even for mass murderers, rapists, etc. which we did. He probably think that it's what Torah really means. There is something in Torah about helping cows of your enemies. Perhaps small gestures of kindness are good even for enemies, but not too much.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>So if we don't take into account that Christians think that Jesus is God's Avatar, is Jesus himself a really bad guy? I mean, it's not like he killed, robbed or raped anyone. Could he really be a rabbi or prophet? After all, rabbis and prophets often have different opinions than mainstream.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>First, it is hard to really know what Jesus said or thought. Modern theories are all over the place as to the historicity of the documents, how and when they went through redaction, etc. So, the first point must be one of uncertainty.</p>\n\n<p>Second, as someone with Christian Testament credentials I can say that there is more than enough \"proof\" that Jesus, according to the Christian texts that are canonical, did claim divinity. A few subpoints: a) when he said \"I am\" he used a specific form that stated \"I. I am\" that apparent in the Greek but not in translation. b) He is called <em>kurios (kyrios)</em> which was a title for \"Lord\" lifted directly from the Septuagint translation of Tanakh and used to denote the Name.</p>\n\n<p>Third, as far as your interpretation of the few texts you cited, you are fine. There are many ways to interpret many of Jesus' words, and the vast majority do not seem to claim divinity, whereas most seem to posit that G-d alone has authority and power (ie. Jesus claimed lack of knowledge about the Last Days and said only G-d had that).</p>\n\n<p>Fourth, the title \"Son of G-d\" is not all that difficult, as you note. It is the later Christian title \"G-d the Son\" (not in the Christian Testament) that poses issues. an interesting look at another title, \"Son of Man,\" that the canonical Jesus uses to refer to himself, does however reveal that he is at least portrayed as one thinking he is Messiah (read <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1595588787\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> book to see some great research into this title).</p>\n\n<p>Lastly, the canonical Jesus does teach an impenetrable love for one's enemy as one's neighbor. He does intend that one approach things from a merciful and forgiving point of view, and proposes an ideal forgiveness with no limit to how many times one should be forgiven. He could not have been a prophet by Jewish standards, but he most certainly was a teacher/rabbi, even if he did not garnish much of a following from the primary leaders of the day. Instead, as the Gospels do attest, the canonical Jesus was the teacher of the poor, a man who focused on social justice and a unique interpreter of Torah who, while taking much of his foundational thought from Rabbi Hillel (see <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805242813\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> for a treatment of Jesus and Hillel), went in his own direction that might have actually resembled the way many Galileans and \"border town Jews\" viewed Torah (my first book rec above elaborates on this extensively).</p>\n\n<p>So, was Jesus a good guy or a bad guy? <strong>There is no definitive answer to this subjective question, but many would agree with your premise and, if hypothetically he was the teacher he is portrayed to be minus the claims to divinity, he would certainly stand as a teacher whose ideas need reevaluation.</strong> This is not to say he does not depart from the Jewish tradition (esp. Oral Law, which he probably did not know too well), but he still stands as one of history's most interesting and captivating teachers, whatever he thought he was.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>the verse in Deuteronomy 4:2 says</p>\n\n<p>\"You shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither shall you take away from it\"</p>\n\n<p>He came to change/detract from the torah and for that he was rejected and branded a dangerous heretic.</p>\n\n<p>This was unlike Rabbinical enactments which come to safeguard the existing commandments.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What does Isaiah 9:5 mean?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.9.5?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 9:5</a> is a famous verse used by Christians.\n<a href=\"http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">A Christian translation</a> is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For to us a child is born. To us a son is given; and the government\nwill be on his shoulders. His name will be called Wonderful,\nCounselor, <strong>Mighty God, Everlasting Father</strong>, Prince of Peace.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The English translation uses present tense. So I do not know whether this child is something that has been born or is being born.</p>\n<p>The curious fact is that two of the names for the child seems to imply divinity.</p>\n<p>Of course this is not the only time Tanakh have references to \"Bene Elohim\" or son of god and it could mean many things. In this passage, what does it mean? Why would a born child be called mighty God, everlasting father?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Note: I cross-asked this in <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/7788\">https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/7788</a></p>\n<p>The English editions of Christian Bibles have the following footnote: \"In Hebrew texts 9:1 is numbered 8:23, and 9:2-21 is numbered 9:1-20.\" Therefore, the Hebrew verse Isaiah 9:5 is translated as Isaiah 9:6.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>Rashi (and similarly other Jewish commentaries) explains the meaning of this verse very differently from the Christian translation from which you ask your question, and hence your question does not begin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and… called his name: The Holy One, blessed be He, Who gives wondrous counsel, is a mighty God and an everlasting Father, called Hezekiah’s name, “the prince of peace,” since peace and truth will be in his days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus according to Rashi and others, the correct translation of the verse is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For a child has been born to us, a son given to us, and the authority is upon his shoulder, and the wondrous adviser, the mighty God, the everlasting Father, called his name, \"the prince of peace.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation of the verse and Rashi are quoted from <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15940#showrashi=true&v=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>added by barlop</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rcXMz.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rcXMz.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The translation that rashi gives(which isn't used by the JPS), is that the hebrew is written using verb, subject, object.   Rather like <code>and god called/named light 'day'</code> is not  <code>and he called god ..</code>   So vayikra shmoh tony, could be \"and he called his name tony\", or it could be \"and tony called his name\". So vayikra is not always translated 'and he called' it can be that the subject comes one or two words later.</p>\n<p>So to put it another way, the translation that rashi gives, is structured like this. Verb subject object, which is very common in hebrew.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oDtWv.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oDtWv.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>The NET (New English Translation) is a christian translation but is academic and has lots of translation notes that discuss both translations re structure, and also re tense of \"born\".</p>\n<p>For tense, the JPS has \"a child is born\".  e.g. <a href=\"https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1009.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1009.htm</a> \" For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us; and the government is upon his shoulder; and his name is called Pele-joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom;\"</p>\n<p>The NET has \"a child has been born\" (i.e. past tense), and the word is past tense. Though the NET also notes, that \"The Hebrew perfect (translated “has been born” and “has been given”) is used here as the prophet takes a rhetorical stance in the future. See the note at 9:1.\" So the NET commentary is saying that as in 9:1 a prophet can use the past tense as a rhetorical device. We do that in English, if somebody can see their impending death, they might say \"we are dead\", when they're not dead yet.  In the mind of a prophet, the future has already happened. So there is such a thing as the \"prophetic perfect\". A word written in the \"perfect\" as in, completed, but that hasn't happened yet.</p>\n<p>The word Vayikra is translated by the JPS 1917 in the present \"and his name is called\" and JPS 1985, in the past \"and he has been named\".  The NET says \"is called\", and notes that  \"vav consecutive are used with the same rhetorical sense as the perfects\".   There doesn't seem to be such a term as prophetic imperfect but I guess that's what the the NET translation is effectively saying it is.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KaF2N.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/KaF2N.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>NET translation notes state-</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is great debate over the syntactical structure of the verse. No\nsubject is indicated for the verb “he called.” If all the titles that\nfollow are ones given to the king, then the subject of the verb must\nbe indefinite, “one calls.” However, some have suggested that one to\nthree of the titles that follow refer to God, not the king.

You were beguiled by him because you have not considered the pre-eminence of the Messiah, the manner and place of his appearance, and the marks whereby he is to be identified.<br><br>\nThe Messiah, indeed, ranks after Moses in eminence and distinction, and God has bestowed some gifts upon him which he did not bestow upon Moses, as may be gathered from the following verses: \"His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord.\" (Isaiah 11:3). \"The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him.\" (11:2). \"And Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins.\" (11:5). Six appellations were divinely conferred upon him as the following passage indicates: \"For a child is born unto us, and a son is given unto us, and the government is upon his shoulder, and he is called Pele, Yoetz, el, Gibbor, Abiad, Sar-Shalom.\" (Isaiah 9:5).

See page 15, specifically, which brings <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/IbnEzra.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Abraham Ibn Ezra's</a> interpretation of the verse, consistent with this answer, which expounds upon Hezekiah's given names, based on events that occurred during his reign:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פלא יועץ‏ - <em>“Wondrous”</em> alludes to wonders God performed in his day, such as the \n  wonder of the sun going backwards when Hezekiah was miraculously cured \n  of his illness (Isaiah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1038.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">38:8</a>).  In fact, Hezekiah's recovery, in itself, was \n  considered a wonder. <em>“Adviser”</em> refers to the root word יעץ‏ is used when \n  Hezekiah decided to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem and invite the \n  people of the Northern Kingdom to join in the celebration, (ChronII <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b30.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">30:2</a>). As the siege of Jerusalem by Sanheriv drew near, the text describes how Hezekiah and his staff came up with a plan of defense, (ChronII <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b32.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">32:3</a>).</p>\n  \n  <p>אל גבור‏ - <em>“Mighty Hero”</em> alludes to the fact that, even though Sanheriv approached \n  Hezekiah with a large army, Hezekiah did not surrender in defeat.  Instead, \n  he defied Sanheriv's threats and blasphemy, and he (and Isaiah) prayed for \n  God's intervention and help, and God’s mighty hand destroyed the threat, (ChronII <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b32.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">32:20-22</a>).</p>\n  \n  <p>אבי עד‏ - <em>“Eternal Patron”</em> alludes to the fact that, in Hezekiah’s merit, the Davidic dynasty was prolonged, and has been preserved for the eternal future.  King \n  Hezekiah was one of the most extraordinary personalities among the Jewish \n  kings, about whom some Sages said that he was worthy to be the Messiah, (Sanh <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_94.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">94a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_98.html#PARTb\" rel=\"noreferrer\">98b</a>, <a href=\"http://www.come-and-hear.com/sanhedrin/sanhedrin_99.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">99a</a>).</p>\n  \n  <p>שר שלום‏ - <em>“Ruler of Peace”</em> alludes to the fact that there was a prolonged period of peace in the Land of Israel during the reign of King Hezekiah.  This peaceful \n  span was highlighted by his invitation to the remnant of the Jews who lived in \n  the Northern Kingdom of Israel to participate in the celebration of the \n  Passover (ChronII <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25b30.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">30</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>I have some research on this and made some observations that might be helpful toward formulating an answer.  IT was just too much to share in comments.</p>\n\n<p>Observations:\nHebrews often name their babies in praise to some attribute of God at work in their life.  Thus, <a href=\"http://hebrewname.org/category/hebrew-names-containing-the-word-god-or-gods\" rel=\"noreferrer\">names contain El, or Yah</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>Some seem to indicate relationship to God, like, <em>Elichai</em>, meaning <strong><em>my</strong> God alive.</em></p>\n\n<p>Others do not indicate relationship, like <em>Elead</em>, meaning, <em>God eternal</em>.  </p>\n\n<p>Doubtless, neither Elead's mom nor anyone else thought that she was saying this baby was God eternal or we would have heard a lot more about it!</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, the prophecy given by Isaiah earlier in chapter 7, that a young woman would conceive and bear a child and his name would be called <em>Immanuel</em>, meaning <em>God with us</em> does not mean the child was God with them. We know that God told Israel, when a prophet spoke, the way they would know if a thing were from God, or if a prophet spoke presumptuously, was if that thing came to pass (Deuteronomy 18:22).  Isaiah is telling Israel they will be invaded and overtaken by the Assyrians; but, he also offers words of hope that a government will arise.  The only way people would know if what he said was certainly from God, is if what he fortold came true.  What comfort is hope if one is not certain it is true or from God.  The only way that Israel would know if these words of hope were certain and true, was if something he spoke already transpired as he said.  He prophecies that a child will be born, his name will be called Immanuel, and before he is old enough to discern between good and evil, the Assyrians will invade and remove them from their land.  While, to my knowledge, we do not hear anything more about the child, Immanuel, we do know <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Siege_of_Jerusalem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the Assyrians did indeed invade as foretold</a>, and logically we assume the baby was born first as prophesied and all this happened before he was old enough to discer between good or evil.  (IF it did not come true then Isaiah would not be regarded to this day as a prophet)  Israel would have known from these events that also the promised hope would come just as surely.  It is not illogical to assume that in that day, no one thought that baby Emmanuel was actually God with them.  The child's name was only prophetic to assure Israel God was with them though things looked bleak and that the rest of the prophecy spoken of in chapter 9 would also occur, that a Governor would come.  </p>\n\n<p>So, it seems that we cannot always take a Hebrew name and say it says the child himself is those things the name says; sometimes the child's name serves as a memorial of Gods attributes and even promise, in the community.  </p>\n\n<p>Now, looking at this long name in chapter 9, Its elements are not logically congruous.  One element is <em>Almighty God</em> and another is <em>Prince of Peace</em>. One cannot be Almighty and Prince simultaneously for a prince would be, by definition, subordinate to the Almighty.  Could it be that this name, like the Hebrew name, Elichai, show a relationship between two people?</p>\n\n<p>Observe now that one of the words, translated by some \"comforter\" is actually a verb.  I am no Hebrew scholar, just relying on libronx ESV interlinear which shows \"counselor\" to be \"verb, qal, active, pure noun participle, singular, masculine, normal.\" If I understand correctly, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participle\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a noun participle</a> acts like an adjective, in this case the verb is to advise/counsel.  Could it be that this name shows the activity of God in relationship to the other.</p>\n\n<p>It is not illogical that this prophecy speaks of a hope that there would be a Prince of Peace who would come in the wonderful counsel of Almighty God and Everlasting Father.</p>\n\n<p>Isaac Leeser translates it accordingly:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Wonderful, counsellor of the mighty  God, of the everlasting Father,\n  the prince of  peace.*\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However the Shulchan Aruch doesn't say this, the question is why did he say it by tzitzis and not by arba minim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would venture the following: It's unnecessary to mandate checking Arba Minim.</p>\n\n<p>Why do we need to check our <strong>tzitzis</strong>?</p>\n\n<p>Casually glancing at your tzitzis will not reveal their Kosher status - there's no visible difference between 6 and 8 strings to the casual observer.</p>\n\n<p>Tzitzis are worn all day - and are mostly out of sight. When they become pasul you wouldn't know about it; the missing string doesn't leave a trail.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't check your tzitzis regularly you'd never notice they were becoming untied and strings are missing.</p>\n\n<p>You don't hold the strings when you make the Bracha or put them and over time you'd forget about them if you didn't inspect them. And when you collect them before Shma you're (1) concentrating on getting ready for Shma and (2) you have no easy way to tell if you're holding 32 or 30 strings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Arba Minim</strong> - when left alone - don't usually become Pasul.</p>\n\n<p>Before you make the bracha you are holding them in your hands after carefully picking them up.</p>\n\n<p>What would make them Pasul?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Most of their leave falling off? You'd notice the pile of leaves when you pick it up/unwrap it. You'd also notice the bare stem.</p></li>\n<li><p>The tips being cut off? How did that happen without you noticing it?

(See Artscroll on Ezra, among others; Medrash Esther Rabba; etc.) The building process was halted by royal edict in the middle of the construction. The exact timeline is discussed in depth by the commentaries on Ezra, where the text itself gives many details of the sequence of events.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, one could correctly say that the story of Purim took place after the [start of the] building of the 2nd Beis HaMikdash, before the [end of the] building of the 2nd Beis HaMikdash, or during the building of the 2nd Beis HaMikdash. It's just a matter of semantics.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Did Moshe know beforehand that there would be 10 plagues?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I was wondering whether, before the first time Moshe went to Pharaoh, he knew that there would be 10 plagues, and what they would be.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I once heard a Shiur where the Rabbi said that originally there were not going to be 10 plagues, Just the threat of death of Egyptian firstborns should Pharaoh not listen. It was only once Pharaoh denied knowledge of G-d that G-d said there would be 10 plagues, so that the whole of Egypt would know who G-d is.</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9865#showrashi=true&v=21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 4:21</a>-23, G-d says to tell Pharaoh that if he does not let His firstborns go (i.e. the Jews), G-d will kill his firstborn sons. G-d mentions nothing about the other plagues. (note that the wonders mentioned in Shemot 4:21 do not refer to the plagues, at least according to Rashi).</p>\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9866#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 5:2</a> Pharaoh says he does not know G-d. and then, in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9868#showrashi=true&v=2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 7:2</a>-5 G-d tells Moshe that He will increase His signs and wonders, but Pharaoh will not listen because G-d will harden his heart, <strong><em>\"And the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I stretch forth My hand over Egypt, and I will take the children of Israel out of their midst.\"</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>This is also emphasized during the different plagues, where G-d tells Moshe to tell Pharaoh that the plague of mixed animalas will be <em>\"in order that you know that I am the Lord in the midst of the earth.\"</em> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9869#showrashi=true&v=18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 8:18</a>). The plague of hail, <em>\"in order that you know that there is none like Me in the entire earth.\"</em> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9870#showrashi=true&v=14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 9:14</a>), and even more so, <em>\"in order to declare My name all over the earth.\"</em> (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9870#showrashi=true&v=16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 9:16</a>)</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This is from the Ohr Hachayim (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/52791/603\">here</a>). I'm not sure how this explanation fits with <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9864#showrashi=true&v=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 3:19</a>-20, which seems to have G-d telling Moshe about the plagues before Moshe even goes to see Pharaoh for the first time.</p>\n\n<p>Also, it seems a little bit difficult to say Rashi understood it this way.</p>\n\n\n",

Each halacha has a unique URL ending in a number, with the first halacha starting with the number 1. Each URL increases by one from the previous URL. Thus, <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?rid=15024\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the URL of the very last halacha</a> in Mishneh Torah contains the total number of halachot. In this case we can see that it comes out to 15,024 halachot.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yosef_Qafih\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Yosef Qafih</a> already noted in the introduction to his edition of Mishneh Torah, there are differences in the numbering of the halachot between different versions:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הנוסח הוא על פי כתבי היד וכך גם חלוקת ההלכות נעשתה על פי רוב כתבי היד\n  וקטעי כתבי היד שברשותי והואיל והספרות התורתית העולמית מציינים בספריהם\n  מספרי ההלכות כפי שמופיע בדפוסים לא יכולתי להתעלם מהם לגמרי כדי שלא\n  להקשות על המעיין למצוא דברי חפץ לפיכך עשיתי את המספרים אשר על פי כתבי\n  היד תוך סוגרים מרובעים [ב] ומספר ההלכות על פי הדפוסים תוך סוגרים\n  עגולים (א) ובכך נראה לי שיצאנו ידי חובת הכל </p>\n  \n  <p>Just as the text is presented according to the manuscripts, the\n  division of the halachot is presented according to the majority of the\n  manuscripts and fragments of manuscripts in my possession. Since Torah\n  literature around the world quotes from the previously printed texts,\n  I could not ignore them entirely, so that the reader can find what he\n  is looking for without difficulty. Therefore I placed the section\n  numbers from the manuscripts in brackets and the section numbers from\n  the printed texts in parentheses, in an effort to oblige everyone. (<a href=\"https://www.mhcny.org/pdf/Introduction%20to%20Mishneh%20Torah.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bohnen translation</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As such, there is not necessarily one precise answer to how many halachot there are; the number might vary based on edition/manuscript. Indeed, the number presented here is different from the number presented in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/83382/13438\">the other answer</a> which used a different (probably more faithful to the original) source.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the breakdown by Sefer:</p>\n\n<h2>Hamada</h2>\n\n<p>1-457 </p>\n\n<p>Total: 457 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Ahavah</h2>\n\n<p>458-1154 </p>\n\n<p>Total: 697 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Zemanim</h2>\n\n<p>1155-2852 </p>\n\n<p>Total: 1,698 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Nashim</h2>\n\n<p>2853-4037</p>\n\n<p>Total: 1,185 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Kedusha</h2>\n\n<p>4038-5254</p>\n\n<p>Total: 1,217 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Hafla'ah</h2>\n\n<p>5255-6062</p>\n\n<p>Total: 808 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Zeraim</h2>\n\n<p>6063-7656</p>\n\n<p>Total: 1,594 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Avodah</h2>\n\n<p>7657-9188</p>\n\n<p>Total: 1,532 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Hakorbanot</h2>\n\n<p>9189-9697</p>\n\n<p>Total: 508 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Tahara</h2>\n\n<p>9698-11505</p>\n\n<p>Total: 1,808 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Nezikin</h2>\n\n<p>11506-12446</p>\n\n<p>Total: 941 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Kinyan</h2>\n\n<p>12445-13430 </p>\n\n<p>Total: 985</p>\n\n<h2>Mishpatim</h2>\n\n<p>13431-14219</p>\n\n<p>Total: 789 halachot</p>\n\n<h2>Shoftim</h2>\n\n<p>14220-15024</p>\n\n<p>Total: 805 halachot</p>\n\n\n",

God, being outside of time, see future events as if it already happens and hence use perfect/past tenses.

Decision-makers have approached the problem in two ways.\n  Orthodox Judaism</p>\n  \n  <p>The principal approach in Orthodox Judaism <strong>is to require strict\n  evidentiary standards for mamzer status, sufficiently strict that\n  proof of the existence of mamzer status is hard to develop and\n  generally does not arise.</strong> Typically it is impossible to prove either\n  that a prior marriage ever existed, or that a child was born of\n  relations outside that marriage. Rabbis always allow the suspect child\n  the benefit of the doubt in this matter. This usually leads to the\n  conclusion that at the time of a person's birth, their parents were\n  married or that the person is the son of a man who was married to his\n  mother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Nowadays, there is no way a mamzer can't be found out. We got paternity tests. However, elaborate \"rules\" are created to make it almost impossible for anyone to be declared a mamzer. In one hand, the reason why this is done is very reasonable, and in fact, that's where the problem is, it's too reasonable. On the other hand, this is an obvious case where political expediency pretty much thrump explicit commandment.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The category of mamzer has no role in Reform Judaism or\n  Reconstructionist Judaism, as these more liberal branches regard it as\n  an archaism inconsistent with contemporary ethical behaviour.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Looks like Mitvah that's too politically incorrect will just be gone for \"some reason\".</p>\n\n<p>Another sample is proof in court. Torah requires people to be condemned if and only if 2 or more witnesses come up. I am sure jews and pretty much the rest of the world rely more on forensic evidences instead of 2 witnesses nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>I am not saying that it's a bad thing. But to say that it's what the Torah means seems to be quite contrived. Either Torah is bad, or Torah is super good but jews don't do it anymore. One thing for sure is, some mitvahs are simply not done.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I will try to answer specific things you say one at a time -- that doesn't mean that they are connected or make for a good question, but here I go (apologies in advance for the lack of formatting -- anyone better equipped is invited to edit this and make it presentable an help me figure out why, even though in my text, I have numbered the OP points sequentially, in the preview, they are all numbered \"1\"):</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>As we know many mitvah are no longer done.

Before the Sanhedrin can enact a death penalty, a warning is needed. The laws of the warning are complex and not every action requires this particular warning before any penalty can be exacted.

We got paternity tests. However, elaborate \"rules\" are created to make it almost impossible for anyone to be declared a mamzer. </p>\n\n<p>5a. Ignoring the reference to Reform Jewish practice as it is irrelevant to a discussion of the applicability of divine Torah-sourced law, you miss another part of the quote, \"Typically it is impossible to prove either that a prior marriage ever existed, or that a child was born of relations outside that marriage. Rabbis always allow the suspect child the benefit of the doubt in this matter.\" The laws of mamzeirut are confusing because they require an investigation into certain issues of parentage -- they are not a simple matter of who the father is. If you reduce Jewish law to a single statement then it seems that we are avoiding its application. If you study it in all its glory over 20 years then you understand that it is a dynamic and complex construct based in specific logic and source material and flowing and shifting within certain bounds.</p></li>\n<li><p>I am sure jews and pretty much the rest of the world rely more on forensic evidences instead of 2 witnesses nowadays.</p>\n\n<p>6a. What you are sure of and what constitutes acceptable proof within the bounds of a religious court are clearly 2 different things. Your sensibility does not drive halacha any more than mine does.</p></li>\n<li><p>But to say that it's what the Torah means seems to be quite contrived. Either Torah is bad, or Torah is super good but jews don't do it anymore. </p>\n\n<p>7a. To say that something is what the torah means indicates deep study and existence within a tradition, not that anything is contrived (which would indicate a complete and baseless innovation). Your next dichotomy is a false one. The torah is, I guess, \"super good\" and Jews DO do it nowadays. It is just something different from what you understand. Instead of assuming that your view defines torah and its observance, and you are the arbiter, maybe you should admit a bit of ignorance and assume that those WITHIN the system have a better sense of what it means to observe it. </p></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Objectively\nexamined, what binds us together as a separate entity is our full\ncommitment to the Torah tradition — and our openness, at the same time,\nto the wider culture of the world about us.  To use the two dreadfully\ninadequate words which normally describe us as a distinct group, we\nare both \"modern\" and \"orthodox.\" I shall be using these terms only\nwith the greatest hesitation. \"Orthodox\" is almost a pejorative; it\nimplies a stifling and unthinking narrow-mindedness.

For every one for whom we find articulating a more or less coherent ideology we find another who appeals to realities of contemporary life to rationalize a moderation of convenience (and note that both quotes associate the adjective \"modern\" with its \"contemporary\" connotation, in opposition to some of the assertions made here) and given the historical realities of Orthodoxy in America it is hard not to assume the latter preceded the former.

Modern Orthodoxy is actually defined by R' Joseph B.  Soloveitchik, and the slogan, \"Torah U'Madah\". (Although R' Soloveitchik did not actually create this label in his writings, nor did he coin the term.)</p>\n<p>There are three works of R' Soloveitchik which define Modern Orthodoxy:  <em>Halakhic Man,</em> The Lonely Man of Faith, and <em>The Halakhic Mind</em>.  In <em>Halakhic Man</em>, R' Soloveitchik expresses the 4 amot of halacha, and how it is very down to earth, this world endeavor.  A sort of spirituality through legalism.    In Lonely Man of Faith, R' Soloveitchik  compares the \"two stories\" of Bereshit, comparing and contrasting Adam I and Adam II, and explains how we need to emulate both. Adam I and Adam II can be seen as a parable for Torah (Adam II) and Mada (Adam I).  Lastly in <em>The Halakhic Mind</em>, R' Soloveitchik describes the historical relationship between strict science and philosophy, and how that same relationship can be applied to halacha.</p>\n<p>The phrase \"Torah U'Madah\" generally captures the definition of Modern Orthodoxy. Where secular studies, and world sciences, (i.e. G-d's creation) becomes a spiritual uplifting influence on the harsh legalism that is pure Halacha.</p>\n<p>The other culturally defining aspects of Modern Orthodoxy such as Zionism, and women studying Talmud are outgrowths of the central core, which is \"Torah U'Madah\".</p>\n<p>R' Joseph B. Soloveitchik was the \"Rosh Yeshiva\" of YU (Yeshiva University).  YU, as a school, has the slogan of \"Torah U'Madah\" and with that phrase they have defined Modern Orthodoxy. The phrase was first coined by Bernard Revel, president of Yeshiva College, which is the undergraduate school of Yeshiva University.  Before R' Soloveitchik, the precise meaning of Torah U'Madah was unclear, but with his teachings, it gained its definition.</p>\n<p>R' Lamm, president of YU, once rebranded Modern Orthodoxy as Centrist Orthodoxy. But he later regretted it, as he was quoted in 2010:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I quickly saw that it was totally misunderstood. “Centrist” does not\nmean that you have Conservative and Reform Judaism on one side and\n“real Judaism” on the other and we are somewhere in the center. That\nis nonsense. Rather, it means that we are the center within the\nOrthodoxy community. I now try very much to discourage the use of the\nword “Centrist,” because it has been misunderstood.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And he later explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some sociologists distinguish between “Modern” and “Centrist”\nOrthodoxy – which is <em>narishkayt</em> (foolishness). Of course there are\nvarieties within Modern Orthodoxy, just as there are varieties within\nCharedi Judaism; none of us is monolithic. But there is absolutely no\nessential difference between these titles in terms of the group they\ndescribe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, today because of Open \"Orthodoxy\", who also claim to be Modern Orthodox, yet do not come from YU, and are more social justice oriented, YU and Lamm prefer the term Centrist Orthodox.</p>\n<p>The Rav and his teachings however, are still the main defining element of Modern Orthodoxy, despite the fact that many people do not live up to the standard.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is no answer to this question.

    "content": "# Did Rashbi Write the Zohar?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my experience, many religious Jews think that Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai wrote the book we have today called the Zohar.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8818-joseph-de-avila\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar</a> is a Jewish work of mysticism that was published in the 13th century. It was said at the time to have been written by Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai in the second century, while he hid in a cave from the Romans with his son Eliezer. The manuscript then disappeared from history only to resurface without explanation a millennium later in the hands of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses_de_Le%C3%B3n\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R Moses ben Shem-Tov de Leon</a>. However, during and ever since its publication there has been controversy over this works authenticity, both scholarly and anecdotal, including statements by the publisher, Moses ben Shem-Tov de Leon's wife as noted in the following excerpt from <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8818-joseph-de-avila\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Jewish Encyclopedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a rich man of Avila, named Joseph, offered [de Leon's] widow, who had been\nleft without means, a large sum of money for the original from which\nher husband had made the copy; and she then confessed that her husband\nhimself was the author of the work. She had asked him several times,\nshe said, why he had chosen to credit his own teachings to another,\nand he had always answered that doctrines put into the mouth of the\nmiracle-working Simeon ben Yohai would be a rich source of profit.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, included in the Zohar there seem to be references to historical events (such as the Crusades in Zohar II, 32a and III, 212b), Hebrew orthographic conventions (eg. Zohar I 24b, III 65a), Spanish words (eg. Esnoga), and names of rabbis (eg. Rav Hamnuna Sava, Rav Yeva Sava, R' Hezkiah bar Rav, etc) which all appear to post-date Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai.</p>\n<p>What are the detailed historical arguments supporting or denying Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's authorship of the Zohar?</p>\n<p>(Note: this question does not seek names of authorities or non-authorities who personally support or deny Rabbi Shimon Bar Yochai's authorship. It seeks detailed historical arguments.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The traditional argument is explored and defended at length <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380410/jewish/The-Zohars-Mysterious-Origins.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and the subsequent links in the series. No one claims that the entirety of the Zohar as we have it was written by Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai (and no one says that he actually wrote as opposed to taught orally any of it).</p>\n\n<p>It would seem rather repetitive to restate all the arguments there, but the real bottom line is that its authenticity is attested to not due to a clear chain of custody of the text (of which there is no single such chain) but due to the Kabbalists contemporary to its dissemination attesting to the authorship claims (for reasons unknown due to the writings on the question being lost) and their analyzing its contents and finding them acceptable. The rest consists of refuting the arguments to the contrary.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There are many arguments denying Rashbi's authorship of the Zohar, several of which were listed in the comments to the question, and as such I will not include these in my answer. On the other hand, most of those that argue in support of Rashbi's authorship don't actually argue in favor of specifically Rashbi. Rather, they present arguments that demonstrate the possibility or even high likelihood that the Zohar is an ancient Tannaitic-period document. These arguments strengthen the likelihood that a Tanna composed the Zohar, but don't necessarily point to Rashbi specifically as the author. Such arguments include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuben_Margolies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Reuven Margolies</a>'s essay on the existence of an ancient Galilean Lod in the general area of where Rashbi and Rabbi Elazar's cave was, together with an argument in favor of an Eretz-Yisraeli Cappadocia (קפוטקיא); both are sites mentioned in the Zohar (הרב ראובן מרגליות, 'שאלות בבקורת הזהר מתוך ידיעותיו על ארץ ישראל', סיני ט [תש\"א], עמ' רלז-רמ = הנ\"ל, פנינים ומרגליות, ירושלים תשס\"ז, עמ' ריב-רטז), further strengthened by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%94%D7%9B%D7%94%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Hakohen</a> (הרב מרדכי הכהן, '\"שאלות בבקורת הזהר מתוך ידיעותיו על ארץ ישראל\", בתוך: הנ\"ל, ליד המעיין, ירושלים תש\"ן, עמ' 64-62) (all can be found on Otzar Hachochmah).</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2_%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%91%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehoshua Inbal</a>'s point that several sources attest to the finding of ancient Jewish documents from ca. the 2nd Temple period during the medieval and early modern periods (הרב יהושע ענבל, '<a href=\"https://www.machonso.org/hamaayan/?gilayon=61&id=1812\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עוד על חיבור ספר הזהר</a>', המעין סא [תשפ\"א]).</li>\n<li>The antiquity of various Kabbalistic concepts presented in the Zohar, as discussed at length by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Benamozegh\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliyahu Benamozegh</a> in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/22067\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta'am Leshad</a>, for example.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A different approach was taken in an essay by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%9F_%D7%A7%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A7%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aharon Kaminka</a> (אהרן קמינקא, 'הרעיונות הסודיים של ר' שמעון בן יוחאי', בתוך: ספר קלוזנר, תל אביב תרצ\"ז, עמ' 180-171).<sup>1</sup> He argued that several deep concepts presented by Rashbi in Chazalic sources appear also in the Zohar, and these concepts are rooted (at least somewhat) in the writings of both Jewish and non-Jewish contemporaries or near-contemporaries (i.e., people who lived in the Roman period). For simplicity's sake, I've only included comparisons to Philo (when he made such comparisons) and not other ancient sources, and concepts that appear (also) in the Zohar (he also listed comparisons between Philo and statements by Rashbi that don't have a direct or similar parallel in the Zohar):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The concept of the degradation of Hashem through man's sin (רעיון הפגם באלהות על יד חטא האדם). This idea was discussed by Rashbi in a baraita brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.74a.10?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a>. This concept was previously discussed by Philo in <a href=\"https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book29.html#:%7E:text=The%20name%20of,ten%20thousand%20deaths%2C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Special Laws</em>, III:83</a>. This same concept appears in the Zohar both in the name of Rashbi and his son, Rabbi Elazar: \"חייבא עבדין פגימותא לעילא\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zohar%2C_Achrei_Mot.67.396?vhe=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zohar%2C_Achrei_Mot.28.180?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en#:%7E:text=%D7%90%D6%B6%D7%9C%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%90%20%D7%90%D6%B8%D7%9E%D6%B7%D7%A8%20%D7%A8%D6%B4%D7%91%D6%BC%D6%B4%D7%99%20%D7%90%D6%B6%D7%9C%D6%B0%D7%A2%D6%B8%D7%96%D6%B8%D7%A8%2C%20%D7%94%D6%B8%D7%90%20%D7%AA%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%A0%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%A0%D6%B8%D7%9F%2C%20%D7%97%D6%B7%D7%99%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%99%D7%91%D6%B7%D7%99%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%90%20%D7%A2%D6%B7%D7%91%D6%B0%D7%93%D6%BC%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%A4%D6%BC%D6%B0%D7%92%D6%B4%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%AA%D6%B8%D7%90%20%D7%9C%D6%B0%D7%A2%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%9C%D6%BC%D6%B8%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>; and the phrase appears elsewhere in the Zohar as well).</li>\n<li>The concept of the \"few spiritual giants\" and the true man (רעיון \"בני עלייה המעטים\" והאדם האמתי). These are two ideas mentioned by Rashbi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sukkah.45b.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%99%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sukkah 45b</a> (=<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.97b.12?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%99%D7%AA%D7%99%20%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A2%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%99%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 97b</a>): \"ראיתי בני עלייה והן מועטין\" and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.60b.20-61a.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 60b-61a</a>: \"אתם קרויין אדם\". These two ideas form a concept that proposes that a small number of very spiritual, righteous men save the entire world. The idea of a chosen holy few appears prior in Philo, <a href=\"https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book27.html#:%7E:text=LVI.%20(303)%20But%2C%20nevertheless%2C%20he%20selected%20out%20of%20the%20whole%20race%20of%20mankind%20those%20who%20were%20really%20men%20for%20their%20superior%20excellence%3B%20and%20he%20elected%20them%20and%20thought%20them%20worthy%20of%20the%20highest%20possible%20honour%2C%20calling%20them%20to%20the%20service%20of%20himself\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>The Special Laws</em>, I:303</a>.</li>\n<li>The concept of a Godly match (זיווג אלוהי). This is mentioned by Rabbi Yochanan (who Kaminka believed receieved this in the name of Rashbi, like several other mystical teachings explicitly brought by Rabbi Yochanan in the name of Rashbi) in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Niddah.31a.22?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&qh=%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%91%20%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 31a</a> and appears also anonymously in the Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zohar%2C_Vayetzei.23.197?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&qh=%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9B%D7%91%20%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%94%20%D7%91%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%94%20%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>). A similar notion appears in Philo, <a href=\"https://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/text/philo/book5.html#:%7E:text=And%20she%20having,her%20other%20Suitors.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>On the Cherubs</em>, 43</a>.</li>\n<li>Maximizing the worth of every commandment to every single person and to the whole world (הפלגת ערך המצוות לכל נפש יחידה ולכללות העולם). This concept is brought by Rashbi in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.37b.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&qh=%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%9F%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%9A%20%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 37b</a> and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.38a.8-38b.3?ven=hebrew%7CWilliam_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 38a-b</a> and a similar notion of the importance of mitzvot appears in the Zohar (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Zohar%2C_Terumah.73.722?ven=hebrew%7CVocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Though not stated explicitly, presumably Kaminka's rationale is that only Rashbi, or someone closely affiliated with him would have been able to so perfectly embed the Zohar with ancient mystical concepts presented by Rashbi during his lifetime, that happen to be rooted in even older mystical concepts from Rashbi's precursors (whose writings were not very well-known by most Jews until the modern period).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> A shorter version appeared previously in German.

That question is hardly unique to the Zohar. It would also be true about many things written at that time and earlier.  The last Mishna in Sotah explicitly says it talking about after Rav Yehuda Hanosi died , there are other mishnayos that were clearly written after his death yet no one questions how he could have been the author of the Mishna.</p>\n<p>The Gemora itself asks this question about the authorship of various nevi'im. See Bava Basra 15B where the Gemora says   יְהוֹשֻׁעַ כָּתַב סִפְרוֹ. וְהָכְתִיב: ״וַיָּמׇת יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בִּן נוּן עֶבֶד ה׳״! דְּאַסְּקֵיהּ\nאֶלְעָזָר. וְהָכְתִיב: ״וְאֶלְעָזָר בֶּן אַהֲרֹן מֵת״! דְּאַסְּקֵיהּ פִּנְחָס\nשְׁמוּאֵל כָּתַב סִפְרוֹ. וְהָכְתִיב: ״וּשְׁמוּאֵל מֵת״! דְּאַסְּקֵיהּ גָּד הַחוֹזָה וְנָתָן\nהַנָּבִיא.</p>\n<p>The Gemora is asking how certain seforim of Tanach can be attributed to their authors when it mentions their deaths. It answers that others finished them. In one case it was finished by two people in subsequent times. Even so it remains attributed to the principal author. The answer with respect to the Zohar is the same.</p>\n\n\n",

He says (in Hebrew!) \"your God can't save you, He's worthless against Assyria!\", and the people hearing him tear their clothing as someone has cursed out the name of God.</p>\n<p>The Talmud Sanhedrin 60a discusses this regarding the obligation to tear one's clothing when hearing someone curse the name of God. The context is when the courts are trying someone for the crime of cursing God, at least once in the process, one witness must actually say exactly what he heard -- or else we'd be executing someone without certainty of guilt! Upon hearing the witness' testimony, the judges must rend their garments.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל השומע אזכרה מפי <העובד כוכבים> {הגוי} אינו חייב לקרוע וא\"ת רבשקה ישראל מומר היה ואמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל אין קורעין אלא על שם המיוחד בלבד לאפוקי כינוי דלא ופליגי דרבי חייא בתרוייהו דאמר רבי חייא השומע אזכרה בזמן הזה אינו חייב לקרוע שאם אי אתה אומר כן נתמלא כל הבגד קרעים ממאן אילימא מישראל מי פקירי כולי האי אלא פשיטא <מעובד כוכבים> {מגוי} ואי שם המיוחד מי גמירי אלא לאו בכינוי ושמע מינה בזמן הזה הוא דלא הא מעיקרא חייב שמע מינה:</p>\n<p>Said Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Shmuel: if one hears a non-Jew cursing out the name of God, he needs not tear his clothing. What about Ravshake [in the book of Kings]? He was a renegade Jew. And said Rabbi Yehuda in the name of Shmuel, we only tear if hearing the explicit name of God cursed, not any nickname for it [such as \"Almighty\"]. This argues with Rabbi Chiya, as he said: \"one who hears a cursing of the name of God today is not obligated to tear, as otherwise, your clothing would be full of tears!\" --Wait, who would be doing the cursing in Rabbi Chiya's quote -- Jews? Do they curse God's name on a regular basis? [No!] Rather, non-Jews. And what name are they using? The explicit name? They don't know it! Rather, a nickname for God. Thus Rabbi Chiya is saying that <em>today</em>, we don't tear clothing upon hearing a non-Jew curse God using a nickname, but long ago we would have.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How to choose 'your' rebbi?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>When a person is choosing who they will learn from as their rebbi, are there any guidelines or rules that govern the decision making process? </p>\n\n<p>First a definition of what a rebbi is (for the purposes of this question). I am talking about someone who will teach you how to access what the Torah is saying and what value judgments are to be made where. In addition, there is an assumption that although you might end up disagreeing on certain specific points you will adhere to the general hashkaffah and values that the rebbi holds.</p>\n\n<p>According to this understanding my question really is: how can you decide what values and general outlook you should subscribe to (which rabbi should be your rebbi) when the tools necessary for that decision will (seemingly) only be attained after learning Torah, which is greatly influenced by the person who taught you how to learn? Is there some pre-Torah mind value that is to be used?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.sichosinenglish.org/books/sichos-in-english/35/01.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lubavitcher Rebbe</a> said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is one of the reasons for the recent stress on the Mishnah's statement, \"Make for yourself a Rav.\" Since the Rav is neutral and uninvolved, he will certainly be able to give sound advice.</p>\n<p>Even with this advice, however, a person might complain that he's unsure whether or not he chose a proper Rav. Here again, the Torah provides guidance, in a verse which also speaks of the pre-Messianic era (Malachi, 2:7), \"...seek Torah from his mouth, because he is an angel of G-d.\" The Talmud explains, \"If he resembles an angel of G-d, then `seek Torah from his mouth,' and if he does not, then don't.\"</p>\n<p>But how can one tell if the Rav resembles an angel of G-d; one never even saw an angel of G-d! Here again, the Torah provides guidance, in the works of the Rambam, where he describes the lives of angels: \"there is no eating or drinking...no jealousy, hatred or enmity.\"</p>\n<p>Therefore, in order to tell whether or not someone is fit to be a Rav, one must see if he fits this description. Is his spiritual life governed without influence of physical factors (corresponding to \"no eating or drinking\")? Is he free of jealousy, hatred, etc.?</p>\n<p>Of course, as always the Evil Inclination comes along with another objection – and one \"according to the Torah\" (since it likes to conceal its true motives in the holy garb of a \"silk kapote\"). \"Isn't one of the signs of a true talmid chacham,\" claims the Evil Inclination, \"that he is `vengeful like a serpent'?\" According to this reasoning, peaceful behavior would not be a correct way of identifying a qualified \"Rav\"!</p>\n<p>Fortunately, the Torah also answers this clearly. When is it proper for a talmid chacham to behave in this way? Only when someone has shamed him publicly, and a general insult to the Torah is involved. However, should he be insulted in private, the Torah requires the exact opposite response. In the words of the Rambam, the way of talmidei chachamim is to \"listen to insult without answering back; and furthermore to forgive the person who uttered the insult.\"</p>\n<p>Aside from these signs of a Rav, there is an obvious prerequisite: that the person has the signs indicative of a Jew in general. As the Talmud says, \"This nation has three signs: they are merciful, bashful, and kind.\" Since these are called \"signs,\" it is impossible that a person practice them only in private. To be considered a sign, the person must actually behave in these ways.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also on <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/therebbe/livingtorah/player_cdo/aid/522096/jewish/Who-Can-Be-My-Mentor.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">video</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I have picked and unpicked Rabbis based on the following criteria.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is he nice to other people and strangers? </li>\n<li>Is he willing to teach without demanding payment?</li>\n<li>Does he, or is he willing to know you as the individual that you are?</li>\n<li>Is he able to explain things to you so that they make sense the first time? Or do you have to keep asking for clarifications?</li>\n<li>Does he refrain from speaking lashon harah in front of you while teaching?</li>\n<li>Does he seem to know what he is talking about?</li>\n<li>Does he delay or do research before answering a question?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>A chaver (friend) of mine once said, when confronted with a question as to what do: \"Ask yourself if this is going to make you a better Eved HaShem or not?\"  Acquiring a rebbi could be a similar question: \"Ask yourself if cleaving to this person will make you a better Eved HaShem or not?\"  Honesty and frankness are key here.</p>\n\n<p>A rebbi should be a teacher, a moreh derech, and an inspiration to you to grow.  Not knowing a lot of Torah doesn't mean that a person can't find a rebbi - it just means that the search might take more time, and might take more twists and turns than a kid growing up in a yeshiva system.  If the seeker of a rebbi keeps the above question in mind, finding a rebbi, while not easy, is an attainable goal.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What are all the different koshers for/about?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I found out recently that what I had been thinking of as a \"food copyright symbol\", (U), is actually a statement of kosherness. Now that I know what this is, I'm starting to see different symbols like (K) and K inside a star, that I'm assuming are also kosherness marks.</p>\n\n<p>Why are there different koshers (if that's what these are)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>These different symbols belong to different certification agencies. Some are regional agencies for example, the Chicago Rabbinical Council.  The CRC will certify food produced in or distributed through the Chicago area.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://vaadinfo.qwestoffice.net/cRc.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://vaadinfo.qwestoffice.net/cRc.jpg</a></p>\n\n<p>In the very abstruse laws of kosher, there are permitted leniencies for industrial scale food production. Some of these agencies may have slightly different sets of rules and some people (who think they know what they are doing) do not accept certification from every agency. In Israel is is not uncommon to find food certified by several agencies.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>\"Kosher\" is a series of laws. But how do we know that a food product complies with these laws? So there are many companies that will go in and certify a food product as complying with the kosher laws. (They'll inspect the factory and ingredients, for example.) <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/agencies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here is a list of some of them</a>.</p>\n\n<p>So a circle-U means that the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America certified this product as kosher. The Star-K means it was certified by a group of rabbis headquartered in Baltimore.  Each certifying organization (or individual) has its own symbol.</p>\n\n<p>Some of these certifiers have different standards (often based on different rabbis' interpretations of the kosher laws), and thus some people prefer products with certain certifications. For example, just about any plain-old cow's milk in America could be certified by the OU or cRc, but the Star-K will only certify it if a Jew is regularly observing the milking. </p>\n\n<p>In America there are the \"big five\" organizations: Star-K, OU, cRc, OK, Kof-K -- who account for a great deal of the kosher market. As one food ingredient goes into another food, they work together and compare standards.</p>\n\n<p>A plain \"K\" on a product simply means \"manufacturer says it's kosher.\" It could be \"we have a reputable certifier checking this but we're not putting their symbol on it\"; it could be \"this is something so obviously kosher (e.g. plain water) that we don't feel like getting external certification\"; or it could be they're using a more-controversial definition of the kosher laws.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>1)  Different cities or areas historically set up Kashrus organisations for their areas. </p>\n\n<p>2)  In the same area, a different (typically a stricter) standard was required and a second Kashrus organisation was set up to provide this. </p>\n\n<p>3)  I believe there have been less elevated reasons for setting up other Kashrus organisations.</p>\n\n<p>For a list of agencies see <a href=\"http://www.kashrut.com/agencies/\" rel=\"nofollow\">kashrut.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Genesis.46.10.1?vhe=Pentateuch_with_Rashi%27s_commentary_by_M._Rosenbaum_and_A.M._Silbermann,_1929-1934&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> ad loc)</li>\n<li>He is the son of an actual Canaanite woman whom Shimon married. He is being branded as such because marrying women from Canaan has been a big no-no since the says of Avraham (Ibn Ezra ad loc.)</li>\n<li>He is Zimri the eventual prince of Shevet Shimon (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.82b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 82b</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The problem I have with each of these explanations is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why would the pasuk go out of its way to refer to Dina in this way? We seem to be insulting her because she was raped? Furthermore, does this imply that all other sons of Shimon were from another woman?</li>\n<li>Now we seem to be insulting Shimon! Why would he have married a Canaanite woman if it was such a big no-no? Furthermore, why didn't his kids die as Yehuda's did for the same infraction (see continuation of Ibn Ezra ad loc). And, similar to above, why is this title only applied to one of the sons and not the others?</li>\n<li>This would imply that Zimri was at least 250 years old when he took Kozbi, this seems hard to imagine. Furthermore, Zimri is never referred to as the son of Shimon. Lastly, why would we bring up Zimri's eventual infraction here in the listing of the sons of the tribes? It seems conceptually out of place and intentionally confusing</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Hence, I would like to know there are either other explanations for who שָׁאוּל, בֶּן-הַכְּנַעֲנִית was or if there is a commentator who addresses any of these problems?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>To address some of the points that you raised:</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.10?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.46.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> explains that since Avraham had commanded Eliezer not to take a wife for Yitzchok from the Canaanites, all the sons of Yaakov were also careful not to do so. (My understanding is that they themselves were not forbidden to do so, but they understood that it was something they should also not do). Shimon himself was also careful about this, but after he married his first wife and had children from her, he married a second, Canaanite women who gave birth to Shaul. Therefore, the Torah publicised it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The sefer Ohel Yosef explains that the reason why Er and Onan died and not their brother Shelah was because they were wicked in and of themselves, whereas Shaul and Shelah were not even though they were the offspring of Canaanite women. (Since he appears to be defending the Ibn Ezra there, I think he means that Er and Onan died because of the two factors together - that they were the offspring of a Canaanite woman and they also were wicked. And from this we can understand a little why Avraham was careful about this matter when he took a wife for Yitzchok).</p>\n<p>(This information was taken from footnotes in the sefer חוקקי יהודח <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39937&st=&pgnum=556\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

We hope this is a theoretical question; however, Judaism covers the difficult cases too.</p>\n\n<p>First off, this isn't pleasant to bring up, but not all forms of rape would be of halachic consequence to the question at hand; but we'll assume here that this was conventional full penetration, which would present an issue.</p>\n\n<p>The Kohen Gadol issue isn't so relevant at the moment; as you'd indicated, if the rapist was a non-Jew or a close relative, she may not marry a Kohen. (And if the rapist is not identified, we'd generally assume it was a non-Jew.) Most shadchanim simply have a checkbox -- \"are you ineligible to marry a Kohen?\" The lady can simply check this -- or say \"sorry no Kohanim\" without giving another drop of detail. Could be her father wasn't Jewish, could be she had a non-Jewish boyfriend, could be rape, could be all sorts of things -- none of it is the shadchan's business.</p>\n\n<p>(If the rapist was a Jew who was not closely related to the victim, she may still marry a Kohen.) (Source below.)</p>\n\n<p>The important thing for this young woman would be (well hopefully all criminal and medical issues have been resolved first) to spend some time with a mental-health professional to make sure she is healing properly and can look forward to a life of positive sexual experiences within the framework of marriage. Please don't think \"oh I'll get married and then all my problems will disappear\" -- it's not fair to you or your spouse.</p>\n\n<p>Provided she is emotionally okay, this is quite frankly none of a young man's business on a first date or two. She does not have to walk around at a singles event with a sign on her hat saying <em>HI MY NAME IS JUDY; I WAS RAPED</em>. Rabbi Moshe Feinstein ruled that a young widow could remove her hair covering, see if she could meet someone, and then explain her past to a suitor at some point in the dating process if things are looking like they are headed quite seriously. (Depending on your culture, this is probably sometime around the 3rd date or so.) I think the same would apply here; <em>assuming whatever trauma issues have been resolved</em>, first go find someone with whom things look promising, then explain the situation before any serious decisions are made. (And if a man meets a woman and likes everything about her for several dates, then suddenly would drop her because of something in her past that's of no halachic or psychological consequence, then phooey to him. Rabbi Ovadya Yosef has, in his written responsa, a question from a woman who had given up for adoption an out-of-wedlock child years earlier and never told her current husband.)</p>\n\n<p>As for the wording in the <em>ketubah</em> -- \"betultah\" simply means \"kohen eligible.\" If this woman is not kohen-eligible, the preferred wording is \"it'ta\" (simply Aramaic for \"woman.\") If she chooses to go this route, only a small handful of people need to know this; this is none of the crowd's business, and they can instruct whoever's reading the ketubah so say \"betulta\" out-loud instead.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/i/5118.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam, Laws of Prohibitions on Relations, Ch. 18</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <blockquote>\n    <p>א  מפי השמועה למדו שה\"זונה\" (ויקרא כא,ז; ויקרא כא,יד) האמורה בתורה--היא כל שאינה בת ישראל, או בת ישראל שנבעלה לאדם שהיא אסורה\n    להינשא לו איסור השווה בכול, או שנבעלה לחלל אף על פי שהיא מותרת להינשא\n    לו.</p>\n  </blockquote>\n  \n  <p>ב  לפיכך הנרבעת לבהמה--אף על פי שהיא בסקילה--לא נעשת זונה, ולא נפסלה\n  לכהונה:  שהרי לא נבעלה לאדם.  והבא על הנידה--אף על פי שהיא בכרת--לא\n  נעשת זונה, ולא נפסלה לכהונה:  שהרי אינה אסורה להינשא לו.

[ח] אשת ישראל שנאנסה--אף על פי שהיא מותרת לבעלה, הרי זו אסורה\n  לכהונה.</p>\n  \n  <p>Our tradition has it that the \"strayed woman\" (Lev. 21:7) who the\n  Torah prohibited to a kohen -- is a non-Jewish woman, or a Jewish\n  woman who had relations with a man to whom she could not marry (where\n  that prohibition applies to all Jews) ...</p>\n  \n  <p>Therefore, if a Jewish man has relations with a single Jewish woman --\n  even if she is a prostitute who is open to all [Jewish men], even\n  though this deserves punishment of lashes -- she is not a \"strayed\n  woman\" as she was not prohibited from marrying this fellow.</p>\n  \n  <p>However if she had relations with someone from whom she is prohibited\n  universally, not a kohen-specific prohibition or a \"yes-do\"\n  commandment; or certainly an <em>erva</em> prohibition [e.g. a first-degree\n  relative], or a non-Jew, as she could not marry him -- she is a\n  \"strayed woman.\" ... </p>\n  \n  <p>We thus see that the status of <em>zonah</em> [strayed woman] is not tied to\n  the relation being prohibited! A <em>nida</em> and a prostitute may not have\n  relations with a man, and a woman may not have relations with an\n  animal, but none of these render here a <em>zonah.</em>  ... And a woman who\n  married a <em>chalal</em>, which is permissible, renders her ineligible. It's\n  simply a matter of disqualification.</p>\n  \n  <p>Any woman who had relations with someone who would render her a\n  <em>zonah</em> -- whether it was rape or willingly, knowing it was prohibited or not, vaginal or anal -- upon penetration she is disqualified.  So\n  long as she was at least three years old and he was at least nine\n  years old at the time.</p>\n  \n  <hr>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From a Biblical standpoint (ie, in the times of Tanach, but not necessarily today), the rapist was required to marry the girl he raped, should she wish to do so.</p>\n\n<p>Deuteronomy 22</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>28 If a man comes upon a virgin who is not engaged and he seizes her and lies with her, and they are discovered, 29 the man who lay with her shall pay the girl’s father fifty [shekels of] silver, and she shall be his wife. Because he has violated her, he can never have the right to divorce her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Why would she wish to marry him?  Ancient peoples placed great emphasis on purity and virginity, and the victim would be considered defiled and disgraced (in addition to no longer being a virgin.)  As such, her marriage prospects were very slim, and she might choose to marry her attacker rather than face the prospect of never getting married.  This unfortunate situation (ie, that rape is viewed as shameful for the victim, not the attacker) is still prevalent in many places today, such as rural India.</p>\n\n\n",

So if your community lets women go to the mikvah then (many Lubavitch communities have this practice) and you feel it would help you, then fine; otherwise, it's really best to find some other thing to focus on towards your recovery.</p>\n<p>If you'll pardon my editorializing, I spoke with a psychologist whose primary work is with severe religious guilt. He said he's seen too many instances where \"I need a mikvah to atone for my guilt\" has led to obsessive-compulsive behavior. (I realize what you're discussing isn't guilt, G-d forbid!, but a need for a break with the past, but it illustrates the concern of when we try to turn mikvah into something it's not.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think that this would be a good question to ask a Rabbi. See the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">many different reasons</a> why this is important, especially when it comes to situations outside of the norm.</p>\n\n<p>However, it would be understandable for a person to want to keep this kind of thing private, even from a Rabbi that they have \"made for themselves\" and are close to, (Avos 1:6). I have had questions for Rabbis that have made me uncomfortable, though they came nowhere near being this personal. What I do for these questions is state them generally and in the third person. So here, one could ask, </p>\n\n<p><em>\"Can any exceptions be made for the general disallowing of an unmarried women's using the mikveh, like for example if she was raped and would like to use the mikveh to represent a 'new start' as part of her recovery process?\"</em></p>\n\n<p>No introduction or spilling of guts or unwanted pity, just question and answer and done.</p>\n\n<p>Another measure that could be taken is to have someone who is already close to the person and knows about this event ask the Rabbi, in the same way as above. The purpose of this would be to add another layer of interference to make the person more comfortable, like if the person was worried that their body language would give themselves away.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know how relevant this source would be, but I think it adds to Shalom's eloquent remarks about <em>\"the concern of when we try to turn mikvah into something it's not\"</em>. <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=shabbos&daf=14a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 14a</a> discusses a Rabbinic decree that drawn water causes impurity because people started to think that the bathing they did after immersion in caves where the water was unpleasant was part of the purity process. </p>\n\n<p>So the Rabbis made you go to the mikveh again if you bathed after the first immersion, just so you would be clear about what  exactly makes you pure. They clearly felt that it was important for this process not to be misconstrued. I'm not saying that no exception whatsoever could be made, particularly in a one-time case where it could aid in a person's process of psychological healing. But I thought it was worth mentioning, again because rape is not something that requires ritual immersion for any halachic reason.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There's no halachic reason to go to the Mikva after rape unless it renders the woman nidda after she's already been married  this would apply only if she is a besulah or has only had relations few enough times that relation that they still render her nidda</p>\n\n\n",

It was within that framework, (where the concept of deities was undisputed), that he logically presented monotheism. This is his argument, seen in <a href=\"http://www.tsel.org/torah/midrashraba/noach.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gen Rabah 38:13</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נסביה ומסריה לנמרוד א\"ל נסגוד לנורא א\"ל אברהם ונסגוד למיא דמטפין נורא א\"ל נמרוד נסגוד למיא א\"ל אם כן נסגוד לעננא דטעין מיא א\"ל נסגוד לעננא א\"ל אם כן נסגוד לרוחא דמבדר עננא א\"ל נסגוד לרוחא א\"ל ונסגוד לבר אינשא דסביל רוחא א\"ל מילין את משתעי אני איני משתחוה אלא לאור הרי אני משליכך בתוכו ויבא אלוה שאתה משתחוה לו ויצילך הימנו\n  ‏ </p>\n  \n  <p><sup>... He took him and gave him to Nimrod. He said to him, <em>\"Let us bow to fire.\"</em> Abraham said to him, <em>\"Rather we should bow to water that puts out fire.\"</em> Nimrod said to him, <em>\"Let us bow to water.\"</em> He said to him, <em>\"If so lets us bow to clouds that hold water.\"</em> He said to him, <em>\"Let us bow to clouds.\"</em> He said to him, <em>\"If so let us bow to wind that disperses clouds.\"</em> He said to him, <em>\"Let us bow to wind.\"</em> He said, <em>\"Rather we should bow to man that holds wind.\"</em> He said to him, <em>\"You are speaking words. I only bow to fire, see I will throw you into it and let the Gd that you bow to come and save you from it!\"</em></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The <strong>עץ יוסף</strong>‏ says that Nimrod's protest of <em>\"You are speaking words\"</em> was that Abraham was making a cyclical argument, and according to him, no local aspect of creation could be worshiped.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, Nimrod's decree to kill Abraham  in fire completes the cycle. <em>Fire</em> beats <em>man</em> beats <em>wind</em> beats <em>clouds</em> beats <em>water</em> beats <strong><em>fire</em></strong>! So Abraham couldn't accept any of these gods, because each one was inferior to the other in an endless loop, (and this concept could be applied universally in creation, either through one big circle, or many smaller ones with shared aspects, if enough time was spent). </p>\n\n<p>In addition, Abraham was perhaps met with another problem. How could all of these factors exist with one another in the same creation? As soon as the fire god, the water god, the cloud god, the wind god, and man came together, they would simultaneously destroy one  another and cease to exist! </p>\n\n<p>The <strong>עץ יוסף</strong>‏ also says that Nimrod refused to step outside of the physical plane that he could see and hear and smell and touch to consider something more. </p>\n\n<p>Abraham, on the other hand, stepped outside of this endless cycle. He concluded that only <em>One</em> Gd, who controlled all of these conflicting aspects and was subject to none of them, could have woven them together harmoniously in to the creation that he saw.</p>\n\n<h2>A Logical process from Duties of the Heart:</h2>\n\n<p>A possible breakdown of Abraham's argument is presented in <strong>The Gate of Unity</strong> in <em>Duties of the Heart</em>, (translated and explained in exhaustive detail <a href=\"http://dafyomireview.com/article.php?docid=398\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>, thank you <strong>ray</strong>!). It is much more exhaustive and detailed than the above source, and it seems to encompass the Midrashic argument of Abraham in its scope. I will attempt a cogent paraphrase, but the reader should bear in mind that it is just that and maybe not address everything that the original work does.</p>\n\n<p>It is important also to bear in mind that logic, being a human construct, is always subject to the limits of humanity. This is why A person's faith is so important. A perfect argument certainly exists for Gd, but we may not have yet grasped it or codified it. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Regardless of arguments and logic, one must know Gd as a fact. Otherwise logic, being human-made, can lead a person astray<sup>6</sup>.</strong> </p>\n\n<p>The Translator himself says, in his remarks: <em>\"This approach is not an attempt to answer what must be but rather to escape into endless and inconclusive speculation as to what might otherwise be.\"</em></p>\n\n<p>The proof begins with three premises that once logically proven assert that the universe has a Creator that created it from nothing:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>A thing cannot make itself:</strong> If something exists, when before it did not, either it must have created itself, or been created. If it created itself, it must have done so before it existed, in which case it was <em>absolutely nothing</em><sup>1</sup>, or after it existed, in which case it did nothing. Both of these concepts are impossible. Thus it must have been created.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Beginnings are limited in number:</strong> Whatever has an end must have a beginning, because something which has no beginning (i.e. existed eternally) has no end (i.e. is indestructible). Given  the finite nature of all of the world's causes, there must have been an absolute starting point<sup>2 3 4</sup>. </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Anything composite, (made up of components or parts), Must have been created:</strong> It cannot consequently be eternal. Anything composite is composed of more than one thing, and these things which it is composed of must precede it by nature. Likewise, whatever assembled the compound must also precede it by nature and by time<sup>5 6</sup>. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>The work proceeds to formally establish the existence of a Creator by way of the above premises. The union of conflicting elements into a coherent harmonious creation is mentioned, which seems to touch on Abraham's argument as understood above:</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>We do not have the capability to join the four elements, in the natural way we find them compounded in nature because they are different or even repel each other, and if we attempt to artificially combine them, the result rapidly changes and disintegrates, while the synthesis brought about through nature is complete and endures until the (appointed) time of its end...</em></p>\n  \n  <p><em>Since all existing things that we find are from the elements, and composed of them, and we know that they were not combined on their own, and by their inherent nature do not join together because of their repelling characteristics, it is clear to us that something else must have joined them and bound them, and fused them together against their nature, by force - this is their Creator, who joined them and established their union.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>1.</strong> With regard to virtual transient particles, which appear and disappear for extremely short periods of time in vacuum space and are claimed by Atheists to allow for something from nothing: 'The virtual particles \"borrow\" for a very short amount of time the ground energy that is already available from time/energy uncertainty principles and converts that to virtual particle with E=mc2. This does not violate the conservation laws because the kinetic energy plus mass of the initial decaying particle and the final decay products is equal. Furthermore, a space-time vacuum governed by quantum mechanics is still something. It is not nothing. We would need <em>absolute nothingness</em> here, as stipulated by the Author'. </sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>2.</strong> Also, anything which has parts must have a whole, since a whole is merely the sum of parts. Something infinite can't be comprised of parts, because a part is an amount separated from another amount. Something which is infinite and has a part taken from it, will be less than what it was before. If it is still infinite, then one infinite will be greater than another infinite, which is impossible. Alternatively, if it is now finite, and we put back the part that was taken, then the whole will be finite, but it was originally infinite. The same thing being finite and infinite is a contradiction and impossible. If we take out a part of all things that have ever existed, the total number of individual things of this part is finite, therefore the whole together is also finite. if you have something non-eternal in the present, you cannot explain its existence by saying that it was the effect of something else non-eternal (its \"cause\"), etc. endlessly, in an infinite regress, because this is an attempt to get something from nothing, that depends ultimately upon the nonexistent. </sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>3.</strong> Something that is infinite <em>in actuality</em> doesn't have quantity because infinity is not a number, it is a description. In mathematics it is possible for an infinity to be comprised of a set of units. This is possible in the realm of mathematics, but is nevertheless impossible in reality. This is because mathematics is pure human logic, which is merely a tool which we use to investigate topics, but anything it has to say on the subject is from premises which we supply. Even in mathematics, you can sometimes run into trouble if you treat infinity as a number. </sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>4.</strong> A rock can exist forever in the past and still not be infinite, theoretically, but at some point it must have not existed as a rock since a rock cannot make itself, therefore something else caused its existence, such as energy, which also cannot make itself, etc. until you reach something of infinite nature, without beginning. </sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>5.</strong> elementary subatomic particles can be converted to radiation whose energy can be combined and divided, and are thus composite. (Also, in kabala anything physical is viewed as a composite of physical and spiritual forces). </sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>6.</strong> The limitations of human logic and still present attacks of these premises are addressed in the article. </sup></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>(This portion of my answer is somewhat peripheral to the topic at hand as it does not deal with the existence of Gd directly, but rather with Unity of His existence).</h2>\n\n<p>The work then brings seven arguments for Gd's unity<sup>7</sup>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Causes are always fewer than their effects</strong>, namely, the higher up one ascends into the chain of causes, the fewer the number of causes, and the more and more one ascends this chain, the fewer and fewer will be their number until eventually one reaches one Cause, which is the Cause of causes. </li>\n<li><strong>We find the world's roots and foundations to be similar in their derivatives and equal in their parts</strong>, and the signs of wisdom manifested in the smallest of the creatures as well as the biggest testify that they are the work of one Wisdom. It is also interdependent for its maintenance and welfare, like links in a coat of armor. If this world had more than one Creator, the form of wisdom would be incongruous in the different parts of the world, and change in its general nature and parts. </li>\n<li><strong>It is impossible for the existence of the world without at least one Creator.</strong> And if it were possible to conceive that the world could exist with less than one Creator, we would consider this. But since we cannot conceive that something less than one can bring anything into existence, we conclude that the Creator must be one. In the case of things which were established through logical proofs, and the proof of their existence is impossible to deny, we do not need to assume more than what is necessary to account for the phenomena which the proof demonstrates.</li>\n<li><strong>Multiple creators</strong> must either be of one essence, in which case they are one being and are one, or of different essences, in which case there is some distinction between them due to their difference and non-similarity. If so, whatever is distinct is limited/bound. And whatever is limited/bound is finite. And whatever is finite is composite, and anything composite was brought into existence, and anything brought into existence must have a Creator. </li>\n<li><strong>The idea of plurality is that of a sum of unities.</strong> Plurality therefore cannot precede unity of which it has been formed. If we discover something plural whether intellectually or through our senses, we will know with certainty that unity preceded it just like when counting things, the number one precedes the rest of the numbers. And whoever thinks the Creator is more than one, should nevertheless concede that there was a preceding unity, just as the number one precedes all of the other numbers, and just like the notion of unity precedes that of plurality. Therefore, the Creator is absolutely One, and Eternal.</li>\n<li><strong>The Creator made essence and incident</strong>. Plurality is an incidental property ascribed to the essence, and comes under the category of quantity. Since He is the Creator of essence and incident, none of these attributes can be ascribed to Him. When it is clear through scripture and reason that the Creator is above and beyond all comparison with, and similarity to, any of His creations, plurality cannot be fittingly ascribed to the Creator. If He cannot be described as plural, He must certainly be One because there is nothing in between the two possibilities.</li>\n<li><strong>If the Creator were more than one</strong>, then either each one of these supposed creators is capable of creating the world by itself, in which case the other Creator is superfluous, since the first is capable without him and does not need of the other, (and since he is not needed, and there is no evidence for more than one Creator, why should we be in doubt or be concerned for his existence?), or each is not capable without the help of the other, in which case each one of them is not all-capable and omnipotent since each lacks the necessary power and ability and was weak. And whatever is weak has a limit to his strength and power, and anything which is limited is bound, and anything which is bound is composite, and anything composite is brought into existence, and anything brought into existence has a Creator.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Lastly the works distinguishes between incidental unity and true unity and ascribes the Latter to the Creator<sup>7</sup>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Incidental unity</strong> occurs in two ways. <strong>In one of them</strong> the character of plurality is apparent in it, such as one genus which includes many species or like one species which includes many individuals, and like one man which is comprised of many parts or one army which includes many men. <strong>The second way</strong> is the unity attributed to a single individual thing which does not appear to be plural, and is not a collection of several things, but it is essentially plural from the perspective of its being composed of matter and form, essence and incident, it is susceptible to \"creation\" and \"destruction\", division and combination, separation and association, change and variation.</li>\n<li><strong>True unity</strong> also has two kinds. <strong>Conceptual true unity</strong> is numerical, the symbol and representation for a beginning with no previous beginning. this is an idea, not a reality. <strong>Actual true unity</strong> exists. It is neither plural nor susceptible to change or variation, is not described by any corporeal traits, nor subject to creation, nor subject to destruction or limitation, nor motion, is not comparable to anything nor can anything be comparable to it, cannot be associated with anything. True unity and the root of everything plural and thus it foils all perspectives and perceptions, since as we demonstrated unity is the cause of plurality. </li>\n<li><strong>In essence</strong>, unity precedes plurality, just like the number one precedes the rest of the numbers, thus the First cause of everything that is plural, which was at the head of all beginnings is itself not plural. Since causes must reach a limit at their beginning, and it is not possible for a thing to make itself, it is not possible for the cause of unity and plurality to itself be of unity and plurality like them. And since the First Cause of the creations cannot itself be plural nor a combination of plurality and unity, it must necessarily be that the Cause is a true (absolute) unity<sup>7</sup>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>7.</strong> See the article for more detailed explanations, as well as questions and answers.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This answer is taken mostly from this shiur by <a href=\"http://vbm-torah.org/archive/midrash/01bira.doc\" rel=\"nofollow\">R. Ezra Bick</a> from VBM</p>\n\n<p>I just want to point out that this Midrash is not saying what Mideval logicians used to argue about Gd's existence.\nWhile the argument here is similar to the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmaker_analogy\" rel=\"nofollow\">watchmaker argument</a> it is also very different.</p>\n\n<p>But first, we need to quote the entire Midrash, not just a small part of it:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויאמר ה' אל אברם לך לך מארצך וגו' ר' יצחק פתח (תהלים מה) שמעי בת וראי\n  והטי אזנך ושכחי עמך ובית אביך אמר רבי יצחק משל לאחד שהיה עובר ממקום\n  למקום וראה בירה אחת דולקת אמר תאמר שהבירה זו בלא מנהיג הציץ עליו בעל\n  הבירה אמר לו אני הוא בעל הבירה כך לפי שהיה אבינו אברהם אומר תאמר\n  שהעולם הזה בלא מנהיג הציץ עליו הקב\"ה ואמר לו אני הוא בעל העולם (שם)\n  ויתאו המלך יפיך כי הוא אדוניך ויתאו המלך יפיך ליפותיך בעולם והשתחוי לו\n  הוי ויאמר ה' אל אברם:‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Full Translation is as follows: (<a href=\"http://adderabbi.blogspot.co.il/2008/11/burning-house-reading-of-bereishit.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">taken from here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>(Midrash Rabba 39,1) God spoke to Avraham: Go you from your land ….</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Yitzchak began:</p>\n  \n  <p>“Listen, O daughter, and look, and incline your ear; and forget you\n  nation and your father's house” (Tehillim 45:11)</p>\n  \n  <p>R. Yitzchak said:</p>\n  \n  <p>This may be compared to one who was traveling from place to place, and\n  he saw a burning mansion. He said: Is it possible that this mansion is\n  without someone responsible? The owner of the mansion looked out at\n  him and said: I am the owner of the mansion.</p>\n  \n  <p>So, too, our father Avraham said: Is it possible that the world is\n  without someone responsible? God looked out at him and said: I am the\n  master of the world. </p>\n  \n  <p>So the king shall desire your beauty, for he is your lord… (Ibid 12)</p>\n  \n  <p>So the king shall desire your beauty – to beautify you in the world.</p>\n  \n  <p>…and bow to him – that is, “and God spoke to Avraham”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Firstly a note about the translation. The word \"דולקת\" can mean either \"burning\" or \"illuminated\", so depending on how you translate this word the midrash can mean two opposite things.   The proper translation is \"burning\", but that doesn't make sense to people who view this as the watchmaker argument, and so they try to translate it as \"illuminated\" instead.  I believe this is an incorrect translation, because of the references to Tehilim, but perhaps the writers of the Midrash did intend for both readings.</p>\n\n<p>Avraham traveled \"the world\", moving from place to place. In every place he went he found the world \"burning\". He saw disorder, injustice, a dissaray of purposes and goals manifested in idolatry.</p>\n\n<p>The response of avraham to a burning world was a cry out, searching for the owner.  Surely there is an owner of the \"building\"(world) who will put out the fire, who cares that the world is on fire, and is the master of the world.  The Midrash tells us that indeed, Gd called out to Avraham and said \"I am the master of the master of the world.\"  And So Gd calls out to Avraham, and tells him to leave his past, his place , his family, and to strike out to Cannan (an immoral place) and to build a new society which is Just, and build on good moral principles, and to stop the World from burning.</p>\n\n<p>The Alternative meaning is that he saw a well built world, after traveling from place to place, and saw that \"someone was home\", (the lights were on) and assumed there must be an owner. The argument from design, or the watchmaker analogy.   (My rest is my own reading, not from R. Bick) However, this interpretation does not explain the quotes from Tehilim, which ask the Daughter of king to leave her home for the right king to be annointed.  If the world was built well and not burning, there would be no need to leave. She could stay where she is, but if her home is on fire, and the false kings reign, then it would be best for her to leave and find the true king.</p>\n\n<p>The last reference to Tehilim tells us that Gd told Avraham to go out to the world and beautify it.  Gd is the master of the world, but it is our responsibility to fix it, based on Gd's instruction.  </p>\n\n<p>I highly recommend reading R. Bick's article, as it goes on many other tangents and makes many good explanations about Midrash and how to read midrash, including the midrash about Abraham and Nimrod regarding the power of the elements.  (but is not in the scope of this question)</p>\n\n<p>So to sum up. The process that Avraham took was the opposite of the \"question of evil\".  Avraham saw what was wrong with the world, and recognized that such a world must have an owner.

If they are thickly glazed they may be koshered through not using them for at least 12 months. Unglazed ones cannot be koshered at all. The same should apply when changing the kosher typology (basari to parve, for example). <a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/practices/Ritual/Kashrut_Dietary_Laws/Keeping_Kosher/Kashering_Making_Kosher_/Dishes.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kashering dishes - Chinaware</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Ceramic is not generally treated as \"kasher-able\". However, \"low-carbon steel with glass coating\" does not sound like ceramic and generally speaking, both metal and glass can be kashered. There is an Ashkenazi custom not to change the \"genders\" of kosher pots (e.g. between milchig and fleishig) even when kashering is an option (e.g. if the pot had become treif).  However, one loophole I've heard of is kashering for Pesach which is still traditionally allowed and would leave the option of \"gender-change\" open.  Though halacha l'maaseh queries are supposed to be left to your rabbi (who might have an issue with the use of a ha'arama - deceptive loophole manipulation).</p>\n\n\n",

Their name implies that they knew how to count letters in the scrolls. Their work lasted from the time of Ezra until the time of Shimon haTzadik (the Just).

In another of the scrolls they found it written, And he sent the za‘aṭuṭë (nobles) of the children of Israel, and in the other two they found written And he sent na‘arë (the young men of) the children of Israel, so they retained the reading of the two and abandoned that of the one.

It has origins in the periods of <em>tannaim</em> and afterwards <em>amoraim</em>, which immediately followed the era of the Soferim. Many <em>midrashim</em> have been developed over time from late antiquity into the Middle ages. Midrash is not just a literature, but also a methodology to interpret and preserve a canonized Biblical text. The book \"<a href=\"https://www.urimpublications.com/learning-to-read-midrash.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Learning to Read Midrash</a>\" by Peters shows that midrashic commentary presents examples of sophisticated textual analysis, reconciling the contradictions, filling the missing historical and halachic data, and providing a Torah-oriented philosophy. Midrash provides rules for textual interpretation, grammar, and many other matters which Ben Bag Bag coined in Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.22?ven=Mishnah_Yomit_by_Dr._Joshua_Kulp&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 5.22</a>: <em>Turn it over, and [again] turn it over, for all is therein.</em></p>\n<p>Due to their large volume, classical collections of midrashim are usually printed separately from the texts of Torah, Prophests and Writings. Many midrashim are often quoted by Torah commentators as a traditional support for understanding of the Biblical text. Many midrashic formulations can be found in the text of <a href=\"https://www.gefenpublishing.com/product.asp?productid=788\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Targum Onkelos</a>. Rashi quotes midrashic explanations when simple meaning of the verse is not clear (see \"<a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1568712340\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Patterns in Rashi</a>\" by Hersczeg). A formidable attempt to include many midrashim together with the Torah text was made by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Kasher\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. M.-M. Kasher</a> in his monumental <em>Torah Shelemah</em>, which has not been complete to date: 45 bulky volumes cover first four books of the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Bull and calf are kind of related.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>One answer I learned, heavily steeped in aggadah, was that there was no intent to build a calf. One of the things thrown into the molten gold was something that had the words \"aleh shor\" written on it, which was previously used to raise Joseph's bones from the Nile (as Joseph was referred to as an ox, or compared to, I forget) so a cow form arose. That is why Aaron in Ex 32:24 says that the calf emerged, not that it was designed as a calf.</p>\n\n<p>For more on this explanation, read <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07514.html\">http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0007_0_07514.html</a> and scroll down to \"In the Aggadah.\"</p>\n\n<p>I also learned that the calf was used because it was reminiscent of the Egyptian deity-form so the people would accept it.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi (in addition to citing the above Aggadah), on 32:4 says that Egyptian sorcerers created the shape through sorcery:</p>\n\n<p>As soon as they had cast it into the fire of the crucible, the sorcerers of the mixed multitude who had gone up with them from Egypt came and made it with sorcery. [See commentary on Exod. 12:38.] Others say that Micah was there, who had emerged from the layer of the building where he had been crushed in Egypt. (Sanh. 101b). In his hand was a plate upon which Moses had inscribed “Ascend, O ox; ascend, O ox,” to [miraculously] bring up Joseph’s coffin from the Nile. They cast it [the plate] into the crucible, and the calf emerged. -[from Midrash Tanchuma 19]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>For starters: anything about idol worship is going to sound a bit weird to us today.</p>\n\n<p>There are a couple of conjectures out there; the simplest is that cattle were a sign of prosperity (you use them to work, and they give you food), so an idol of that form was very popular. (I'm told we also find it in archeological digs.) Note that 500 years later, King Jeroboam wanted to make his own pseudo-Temple to keep people away from Jerusalem, and thought \"hm, how do I make this more popular? I know! I'll put in a golden calf! Hey better yet, why not two?\" And a calf, being young, means a promise of future prosperity. Note that <a href=\"http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=5&CHAPTER=21\">if there's an unsolved murder</a>, we take a young calf and publicly kill it -- showing how all that potential promise of someone's life was suddenly ended.</p>\n\n<p>The kabbalistically-inclined Nachmanides observes that in Ezekiel Ch. 1, he sees angels surrounding God, and the one on the north side looks something like a calf; the Hebrews in the desert were particularly concerned of a dangerous hot north wind, so that was believed to help.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>According to the Midrash, and some texts of the Kabbalah, ( I don't remember the exact sources), when the Jewish people are described as \"seeing Gd's feet\", what they saw, was the Merkava (chariot) from Ezekiel.</p>\n\n<p>On one of the sides of the Chariot is a bull.  That bull represents Mercy. And since they believed Moshe to have died, they were hoping for the Gd of Israel to be full of Mercy, since they would now be lost.</p>\n\n<p>Another idea that I have heard from year to year, is that the Calf represented a new leadership from the Tribe of Yoseph. (Yoseph is compared to a Bull, so Ephraim and Menashe would be calves)  This \"battle\" of Yoseph(Ephraim or Menashe), vs Yehudah, vs Levi plays out throughout tanach, from Bereshit, until Chronicles and the later Prophets.  As to why at that point in time they would prefer the style of leadership that Yoseph granted, it is because Yoseph was known for relieving people of burdens, and helping them through touch economic times. It was a more worldly sort of leadership, based on certain type of equality.  (Going through all the points for this would be beyond the scope of this answer)</p>\n\n\n",

That minyan will have bircas kohanim m'd'oraisa, however the kohan if he goes to the minyan with no kohanim will only perform the mitzvah on a d'rabbanan level, perhaps better then to go to the other minyan and perform it on a d'oraisa level. This is different than the first case because even if he doesn't go to the minyan with 2 kohanim, they will still have bircas kohanim on the level of a d'oraisa, however he won't.

That isn't quite true..\nWhat the Halacha does say is that if there is only one Kohen, then the Chazan isn't supposed to call out 'Kohanim', though if he mistakenly did (as often happens), the Kohen hasn't transgressed a Biblical Mitzva if he doesn't go up.</p>\n\n<p>See, for example: <a href=\"http://www.ateret4u.com/online/f_01355_part_7.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">קיצור ש''ע ילקוט יוסף קכח:א</a></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>'ואפילו אם אין שם כהן אלא כהן אחד, אם קראו כהנים ולא עלה, הרי זה עובר בעשה כנז'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This doesn't necessarily make the 'Birkas Kohanim' done by one Kohen any different.</p>\n\n<p>As it is a 'מצוה דאורייתא' either way, it would make more sense to go Daven where there is no other Kohen, as this way you are enabling everyone to receive the ברכה when they wouldn't otherwise.</p>\n\n\n",

You'll find references to fringe groups who believed in \"שתי רשויות\", \"two domains\"; effectively, one deity in charge of good things, and a different one in charge of bad things. That's why the mishna says that a chazan whose text is \"Modim, Modim\" should be immediately removed: if you lived in the Middle East around the year 150, that was a good sign you believed in two different deities to thank. </p>\n\n<p>Isaiah writes that God \"fashions light and creates dark, makes peace and creates <em>evil.</em>\" This dichotomy features heavily in Zoroastrianism, and thus in response our prayer texts say instead: \"makes peace and creates <em>all</em>\", stressing that everything comes from one God.</p>\n\n<p>Quite frankly I would assume that we would treat it as <em>avoda zara</em>, at least from our standpoint (e.g. something used in their worship would be prohibited from our benefit). It was very common in the times of the mishna yet we don't find the mishna offering any distinction between flavors of non-Jewish worship at the time; what's more the mishna Shabbos 2:5 speaks of heathens who won't let you have your shabbos candles lit; R' Ovadya miBartenura comments: \"because of idolaters -- there were Persians who, on their religious holidays, would ban all flames unless lit within their temples.\" I'm told that was the Zoroastrians. (Or at least early ancestors.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Although originally a question, I turned this into an answer because I think it is more useful here.</p>\n<p>Zoroaster, the prophet said there was One G-d, Ahura Mazdah—in Greek, the Wise Lord. Zoroastrianism felt that there was only one god. Yet some Parsis feel that the Wise Lord's twin brother Ahriman, who is evil, exists. They were both created simultaneously.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of creation, there was only infinite time but the Wise Lord set a trap by creating the time of the long dominion within infinite time. The human timeline is encased within the time of the long dominion. When this ends the Wise Lord will defeat his twin and light will burn away the darkness. They say the Wise Lord had no choice in the matter. Thus, they answered that eventually, the Wise Lord will overwhelm evil, and all souls will be as one.</p>\n<p>Thus, it seems that Zoroastrianism is closer to dualism than monotheism, in my view. There was a notion of a dual deity, however, many Zoroastrians insist that they are really monotheists.</p>\n\n\n",

Yehudah the Maccabee fell in battle, as did his brother Yonason after him. But Shimon, the last remaining brother, after another thirty years of fighting finally defeated the Greeks, and for the first time in a very long time Yisrael achieved independence form the Greeks.</p>\n<p>But even then the defeated enemy did not give up hope of reclaiming their dominion, and with bribes and trickery they managed to get the brother-in-law of Shimon, Ptolmous ben Chaviv, on their side. He persuaded Shimon to come with some of his family to a family feast, and whilst he was there Ptolmous murdered him. He immediately sent a message to the King of Syria to send an army to recapture Jerusalem, and at the same time sent some people to kill Shimon's son, Yochanan. But Yochanan heard about it, and managed to reach Jerusalem first. (See the Book of the Chasmanoim 67 and the sefer Kadmoniyos by Yosef Flavius, 18,7). By another great miracle they manage to again defeat the enemy, but this time the defeat was total, and the governance of Israel passed into the hands of Yochanan the Chashmonai, and Israel once again became very successful, independent country.</p>\n<p>With this background he goes on to explain that from the days of the return to Israel in the time of Ezra they were subservient to different nations, first Persia, then Egypt and then Greece, and had to pay heavy taxes to these kingdoms. Thus they lived in great poverty and distress, and for this reason the last of the prophets instituted that the Levi'im should say Psalm 44 \"Wake up, why do You sleep, Hashem?\". This prayer was very fitting to their miserable situation at that time, and they were not concerned that people might ask \"Does Hashem sleep?\", because they all understood that they were saying it as a supplication and a prayer. As the gemara in Sotah 48a says: When Yisrael were living in misery and the nations were living comfortably and in peace, they said \"Wake up, why do You sleep, Hashem?\".</p>\n<p>But during the period of Yochanan the Chashmonai, when Yisrael were \"living comfortably and in peace\" and their situation was one of prosperity, and thus they no longer agonized about their plight, the words \"Wake up, why do You sleep, Hashem?\" lost their significance as a prayer and a supplication, and instead caused people to wonder \"Does Hashem sleep?\". Because of this the decision was taken to annul the reciting of this Psalm by the Levi'im.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95_%D7%9B%D7%A5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Eliyahu Katz</a> wrote an essay called \"מי היה יוחנן כהן גדול שתיקן תקנות נועזות?\" - \"Who was Yochanan Kohen Gadol who made risky laws?\" that deals with your questions.</p>\n<p>On your first question, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"והנה מבלי להכנס בפרטים הנ\"ל חושבני שהפתרון צריך להיות מרומז במשנה עצמה, וע\"י התקנות שתיקן ומעשים שעשה, נוכל למצוא השערה נכונה מי היה יוחנן כהן גדול זה ומתי היה. ראשית ידועים לנו דברי חז\"ל שעזרא הסופר הוא בעל תקנות גדולות, ואיך זה לא תיקן תקנה ההודיות? אך אפשר כי מאחר שהיו בימיו כהנים גדולים שהיו אחראים על סדרי בית המקדש הבין שמגיע להם שהם יתקנו את התקנות ששייכים בתוך ביהמ\"ק וירושלים וכן הקשורים עם הכהנים ועובדי ומשרתי ביהמ\"ק. ואם אנחנו נעבור על חמש התקנות שמתייחסות ליוחנן כהן גדול, נראה שכולן שייכות למסגרת הכהן הגדול שתחת פיקוחו ביהמ\"ק והכהנים, ולא במסגרת התקנות של עזרא. אכן את הלוויים הוא קנס על שלא עלו, ואולם בנוגע לאמירת הווידוי השאיר זאת להכהן הגדול שמשרת בקודש וסדרי ביהמ\"ק נחתכים על ידו ובמילא גם הודיית המעשר...וזו היא התקנה שתיקן וביטל את המעוררין...דבר זה מובן כמו כן שבשנים הראשונות של שבי ציון בעת שהיו בלחץ ודוחק גדול מהשומרונים שכתבו עליהם שיטנות והפסיקו את עבודת ביהמ\"ק, אין חידוש שבזמנים כאלה הלוויים רצו להיות מעוררין נגדם, אך הכה\"ג שבימים ההם יצא בתוקף נגד הנהגה כזאת וביטל את המעוררין. כי איך אפשר לומר \"עורה למה תישן\" כשזיכה אותם ה' אחר שבעים שנה לשוב לארץ מולדתם, לבנות את עיר הקודש ולהקים מקדשו.\"</p>\n<p>\"And here, without getting into the above details, I think that the solution must be hinted in the mishnah itself, and on the rulings he passed and the things he did, we may find a sensible hypothesis on who was Yochanan Kohen Gadol and when he lived. First of all, we are aware of what Chazal said that Ezra authored great rulings, and how coould it be that he didn't pass the ruling of the Hodayot? However, it's possible that because in his time there were KGs who were in charge of the orderly running of the Temple, he understood that it is due to them to pass rulings that relate to the internal structure of the Temple and Yerushalayim and also those that relate to the kohanim and workers and servers of the Temple. And if we go over the five rulings that arre attributed to Yochanan Kohen Gadol, we shall see that they are all related to the framework of the KG that under his supervision is the Temple and the kohanim, and not part of the frame of the rulings of Ezra. Indeed, he taxed the leviim for not making aliyah, but with regards to saying vidui he left that to the KG who served in the Holy and the organization of the Temple is decided by him, and therefore, also the Hodayot of the tithes...and this was a ruling that he passed and canceled the \"wakers\"...this too is understandable for in the early years of Shavei Tzion they were under enormous pressure from the Samaritans who wrote against them accusations and they stopped the service of the Temple, it's not surprsing that in times like that the leviim wanted to wake against them, but the KH in those days went against them in full-force and canceled the \"wakers\". For how could one say \"wake, why do you sleep\" when Hashem granted after seventy years the ability to return to their Land of Birth, to build the Holy City and build His Temple.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On your second question, he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...גם הרמב\"ם מתכוין לשלול דבר מהצדוקי שהי' בזמן החשמונאים ולפי הנוסחא שבידינו הוא כותב שהיה אחרי שמעון הצדיק. לא נתרחק איפוא מן האמת אם נרשה לעצמנו השערה מתקבלת על הדעת ונאמר שהיה כתוב בכת\"י הרמב\"ם בראשי תיבות שיוחנן כהן גדול זה היה \"אחרי ש\"צ\", ומשמעותן של ר\"ת אלו היא \"שבי ציון\" ולא שמעון הצדיק וע\"י זה היינו יכולים לפתור את הבעיא מי הוא זה ומתי חי.\"</p>\n<p>\"And the Rambam also meant to negate this from being of that Sadducee who was in the time of Chashmonaim, and according to the version we have in our hands he wrote that he was after Shimon Hatzaddik. It wouldn't be far from the truth if we allow ourselves the sensible hypothesis and say that written in the handwriting of the Rambam in an acronym that Yochanan Kohen Gadol was \"after Sh\"Tz\", and the meaning of that acronym is \"Shavei Tzion\" and not Shimon Hatzaddik, and per this we can solve the problem of who he was and when he lived.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, he says that Yochanan Kohen Gadol was most likely Yochanan ben Elyashiv, one of the KGs from the time of Ezra and Nechemiah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If I recall correctly, he abolished the custom because people were claiming that HaShem actually sleeps, ח\"ו. He was able to do so because the custom wasn't a real halakha, so since he was one of the gedolei hador that was enough to allow him to change it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How do I repair a damaged friendship?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am seeking specifically-<em>Jewish</em> wisdom on the following question.  Our rabbis have something to say on just about every aspect of life, but I'm not sure where I should be looking (or even what keywords, really) for this one.</p>\n\n<p>There's someone I used to have a decent friendship with, but over time things degenerated and we both did things we'd now prefer we hadn't done.  (I think more of that came from the other person, but of course perspectives are weird.)  Recently this person did something I found very hurtful and I made myself scarce.  The person has now (unprompted by me) expressed regret, apologized, and said that if we can't be friends yet can we at least not be enemies?  I don't want to be enemies either, and responded by saying that (and accepting the apology).</p>\n\n<p>My question is: what can <em>I</em> do to improve this relationship?  I can't just pretend that all the hurt didn't happen; it did, a fair bit of it remains unaddressed, trust has been damaged, and I'm human.  So I'm concerned about being hurt further, but I'd like to be able to improve on where we are now.</p>\n\n<p>What interpersonal or spiritual practices should I be trying to apply?  Is there recommended reading in this area?</p>\n\n<p>In case it matters, the other person is not Jewish (and so is not bound by any halacha that might otherwise apply).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In Pirkei Avot, Chapter 1 Mishna 12, we are told:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hillel and Shammai received the transmission from them. Hillel said: Be of the students\n  of Aaron, loving peace and pursuing peace, loving people and bringing\n  them closer to Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In Pirkei Avot d'Rabbi Natan, what it means to be like Aaron is expanded:\n(<a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/pirkei-avos/chapter1-12.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">taken from this website</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if Aaron would observe two people quarreling, he would afterwards\n  approach one of them with the following: \"I just saw the other fellow\n  besides himself with grief. He's sitting there saying it's all his\n  fault and how can he possibly face you again.\" Aaron then promptly\n  went to the other fellow with the exact same story. ;-) Needless to\n  say, the next time the people met they were tearfully hugging each\n  other, the life-or-death issues they had been arguing about long\n  forgotten.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Basically, this is teaching us two things.  1. It's ok to lie in order to restore a friendship*.  2. The remorse of the other person should be enough to cause you to forgive them, apologize as well, and wish for the return of the friendship.  However, you have to want that friendship to return.</p>\n\n<p>When I was reading your question, I thought to myself, the answer is simple, \"apologize, forgive the other person and ask for forgiveness.\"  I was a bit taken aback when you said that your ex-friend had already done that!  That is what you were supposed to do!</p>\n\n<p>*Perhaps even to yourself, or especially to yourself!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First decide if you really want to mend the relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The way to do this, is to apply the conditions of repentance to this person.

Then just forget what happened, and start over with a clean slate, yom kipur style.</p>\n\n<p>If not, then you might want to reconsider since you might just be setting yourself up for more hurt.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Just having a go.

You may find it applicable to extrapolate from that, that perhaps there has been a shortcoming in communication between the interested parties. He quotes (with the emphasis mine):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>R. Aha b. R. Hanina said: Never did a favourable word go forth from the mouth of the Holy One, blessed be He, of which He retracted for evil, except the following, where it is written, “And the Lord said unto him, Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the midst thereof” (source). The Holy One, blessed be He, said to Gabriel, “Go and set a mark of ink on the foreheads of the righteous, that the destroying angels may have no power over them; and a mark of blood upon the foreheads of the wicked, that the destroying angels may have power over them.” Said the Attribute of Justice before the Holy One, blessed be He, “Sovereign of the Universe! How are these different from those?” “Those are completely righteous men, while these are completely wicked,” He replied. “Sovereign of the Universe!” said Justice, “they had the power to protest but did not.” Said God, “It was fully known to them that had they protested they would not have heeded them.” <b>“Sovereign of the Universe!” said Justice, “If it was revealed to You, was it revealed to them?” </b> Hence it is written, “[Slay] the old man, the young and the maiden, and little children and women; but do not come near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my Sanctuary [mikdashi]. Then they began at the elders which were before the house.” R. Joseph said, “Read not mikdashi but mekuddashay [My sanctified ones]: this refers to the people who fulfilled the Torah from alef to tav.” (Shabbat 55a)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What if the tafel comes to hand first?",
    "content": "# What if the tafel comes to hand first?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Although there are varying opinions among the <em>acharonim</em>, the common practice is that only one <em>b'racha rishona</em> is said before eating a mixture of two items that normally require different <em>b'rachos</em>, where the mixture is such that each spoonful or forkful will include both items. (Sources: Rabbi Yisroel Pinchos Bodner, <em>The Halachos of Brochos</em>, chapter 4, section C; Rabbi Binyomin Forst, <em>The Laws of B'rachos</em>, chapter 7, section Ⅰ.A.)</p>\n\n<p>Suppose one's about to eat such a mixture, takes a spoonful, is about to say the <em>b'racha</em> required, and notices that his spoonful happens to contain only food items whose normal <em>b'racha</em> is not the mixture's. What should he do?</p>\n\n<p>To clarify, I'll pick a specific example, though my question is about the general case. Suppose someone's about to eat a mixture of very small pieces of pineapple (<em>haadama</em>) and apple (<em>haetz</em>). He takes a spoonful and is about to say the <em>haetz</em> required (because, for whatever reason, the apple is considered primary in this case), but realizes his spoon has only pineapple on it. What should he do?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Say <em>haetz</em> on the spoonful even though it's pineapple? (Seems odd, but I seem to recall hearing that when a primary food's <em>b'racha</em> covers a secondary food, the latter is deemed by some to become a food that actually requires the former's <em>b'racha</em>. In that case, perhaps here one says <em>haetz</em> on the pineapple even if eaten alone first.)</li>\n<li>Say <em>haadama</em> on the spoonful and <em>haetz</em> on the next spoonful (if it contains apple)? (Seems odd also, but it would seem the ideal according to the <em>acharonim</em>, alluded to above, who don't hold only one <em>b'racha</em> is made on the mixture. Note that my question includes the case in which the primary ingredient requires <em>haadama</em> and the other requires <em>haetz</em> (the reverse of the example I gave), which may affect the appropriateness of this option.)</li>\n<li>Put the spoonful back and take another that contains apple so he can say <em>haetz</em>? (Seems like it should be valid, but I wonder whether it's required.)</li>\n<li>Something else?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer to your question depends on a \"chakira\" in how primary and secondary works.</p>\n\n<p>The standard approach is that the blessing on the primary covers the secondary.  You make the blessing on the main food and it extends to the other food.  This may be because the other food is seen as having become part of the main food, or nullified to it, as your first option suggests.  This is the simple understanding, and many poskim are explicit like this (Chazon Ish and others).  The Rema in O.C. 212:1 writes that the blessing on the primary only covers the secondary when they are eaten together or the primary is first, but if the secondary is eaten before the primary, it needs a blessing, and the Mishna Berura (212:9) explains that the blessing that you will make afterwords on the primary cannot retroactively cover the secondary, and it would be considered eating without a blessing.  However, the Rema concludes that the blessing you would make on the secondary food is Shehakol, and not its normal blessing, as it is merely a secondary food and has lost its ideal blessing.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אבל אם אוכל הטפל תחילה... מברך על האכל תחלה אף על פי שהוא טפל לשתיה. ואינו מברך אליו רק שהכל הואיל והוא טפל לדבר אחר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to this school of thought, you would make a shehakol on the pineapple in your example.</p>\n\n<p>The more novel approach is that a food that is secondary is not significant enough to require a blessing at all!  (Rashba citing the Ba'al HaMeor in Berachos 41b s.v. Amar Rav Papa) According to this approach, the blessing on the primary is not covering the secondary, but rather the secondary does not need a blessing because it is not a significant part of this meal.  If that is the case, your spoonfull of pineapple would not get a blessing at all, as it is not significant enough to merit a blessing of its own.</p>\n\n<p>Normative halacha seems to go like the first approach, although there is a <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=555\" rel=\"nofollow\">Magen Avraham (168:30)</a> that cites a Maharshal which implies the second understanding - He discusses dipping meat into wine during a meal.  Since the meat is \"tafel\" to the bread, and the wine is \"tafel\" to the meat, you do not make a blessing on the wine, even though he holds that a drink in a meal needs a blessing.  The Magen Avraham himself disagrees with the latter point, but has no issue with the internal logic of the Maharshal.  This only makes sense if the \"tafel\" does not need a blessing - if the \"tafel\" is covered by the blessing of the \"ikar,\" the tafel cannot be nullified or become part of the ikar, as they are not being eaten together at all, and wine is not covered as \"part of the meal\" with bread the way meat is!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכן נמי\n   כשנותנין היין בקערה עם\n   המלח(שלצ״א בלעז) כדי\n   לטבל בו הבשר א״צ\n   לבר׳ דה״ל בשר עיקר\n   והבשר כבר נפטר בברכ' המוצי' עכ\"ל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The book וזאת הברכה by אלכסנדר אריה מנדלבוים (Jerusalem 5762), chapter 11, pages 93–94, cites <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Zalman_Auerbach\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rabbi <em>Sh'lomo Zalman</em> Auerbach</a> as having said that one should, in the spoonful of mixture over which he's saying the blessing, have food representing both <em>b'rachos</em>, but most of it should be food representing the <em>b'racha</em> he will recite.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I would recommend putting the spoon back and getting a mixture.  Because in a different case, you could be eating only the pineapples out of the mixture, and thus you would only say the bracha on the pineapples. The other option is to say the bracha on the pineapples, and then only take out apples, and then say the bracha on the apples. And then continue to eat as normal.  But since I assume you have a mixture because you actually want a mixture, make sure you eat the mixture.</p>\n\n<p>However, your best option is to say the bracha before you take out any food, and then you can eat whatever you get on your spoon, kzayit or not, since your bracha is covering everything, and not what is on your spoon and you are about to eat.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand, it is difficult to understand R' Danzig as saying that merely speaking to the dead with no requests and no intention or expectation of a response is \"likely\" a violation of <em>doreish el hameisim</em>, as it is hard to square this with the context of the prohibition described by the <em>Chochmas Adam</em> at the beginning of the halacha (see fn. 1). </sub></p>\n\n<p><sub>See Responsa <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshe_Schick\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Maharam Shik</em></a> (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1494&pgnum=206\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC §293</a>, h/t <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/users/8775/mevaqesh\">@mevaqesh</a>), who says that the <em>Chochmas Adam</em> categorizes as <em>doreish el hameisim</em> people who implore the dead to intercede on their behalf.

    "content": "# Biblical versus rabbinic transgressions\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Does the distinction between biblical versus rabbinic transgressions have implications \nor consequences today?</p>\n\n<p>In the past, the punishment for them was different I believe.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n\n<p>The most basic - and presumably most practically important - distinction between laws of Scriptural and Rabbinic origin is what to do in case of a doubt.  </p>\n\n<p>The general principle is: S'feika D'Oraisa l'Chumra, S'feika D'Rabbanan l'Kula - when confronted with a doubt in a law of Scriptural origin, take the stricter position; on a doubt in Rabbinic law, take the more lenient.</p>\n\n<p>This impacts halachic decision-making on a daily basis, right down to the most mundane concerns of (for example) whether or not to eat a food cooked in a pot whose kosher status is in question, to make a blessing when you've forgotten whether you already have.</p>\n\n<p>It is not necessarily the case that we'd say that a Scriptural transgression is \"worse\" than a Rabbinic transgression, if only for the fact that it's Torah itself that enjoins us to follow the teachings of the Sages - so that it's a Scriptural injunction to observe Rabbinic law, putting the two elements of Torah law on equal footing in the final analysis.  </p>\n\n<p>Even more so, however, the Talmud says, Chamur Divrei Sofrim mei'Divrei Torah - the words of the Sages should be observed (even) more strictly than the words of the Torah itself, for it is Rabbinic law that actually serves to protect the Scriptural; securing the Mitzvos from even accidental breach by setting the fence further away.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You're correct about the punishment. If someone carried in a \"public thoroughfare\" on shabbos (a biblical violation) because they thought it was Tuesday, they had to bring a sacrifice for atonement. If someone carried in a deserted forest (a rabbinic violation) thinking it was Tuesday, no sacrifice would be brought.</p>\n\n<p>If done intentionally, warned, and witnessed, (plus a bunch of other caveats), biblical prohibitions could carry all sorts of punishments. Rabbinic ones generally (barring extreme circumstances) would be \"whip him until he says he's sorry.\" That's how things were a long time ago.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Today, we generally say that a biblical violation is worse than a rabbinic one; and that mistakenly violating a biblical violation requires repentance (regret, confession to God, resolve to do better), whereas mistakenly violating a rabbinic one doesn't (but please educate yourself better, or buy a big calendar or whatever it takes to prevent the problem from happening again).</p>\n\n<p>There are many other distinctions in the law between rabbinic and biblical prohibitions as they pertain to \"may I do X\", not \"what if I did X\"; for instance there are many (not all, it's complicated, please consult a rabbi) rabbinic prohibitions that had built-in exceptions for non-life-threatening medical or military situations. (If it's life-threatening, don't call your rabbi. Do like Tuesday and call 911 right now. Or go shoot the bad guys, or whatever.) For instance: \"It's Shabbos and I have a really awful migraine and I'm in bed the whole day because of it.\" May I light a fire to make myself more comfortable? Biblical prohibition, no. May I take an aspirin? Rabbinic prohibition, they left an exemption for the seriously-in-pain, so yes.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p><a href=\"/users/5323/shokhet\">Shokhet</a> <a href=\"/a/50459\">cites</a> <em>Sh'miras Shabas K'hilchasah</em> as saying that, to save a life on <em>Shabas</em>,</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>if there is no difference in speed or quality of care, that one should choose to do a rabbinically prohibited action, instead of one that is Biblically prohibited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(Note the \"if there is no difference\". Otherwise, saving a life takes priority.)</p>\n\n<p>Note that, as <a href=\"/users/1713/daniel\">Daniel</a> pointed out in a comment on this answer:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I would imagine that it's probably the case that if for some reason it becomes impossible to avoid doing a prohibited action, a rabbinic prohibition is preferable to a biblical prohibition even not on <em>Shabbat</em> and possibly even not to safe a life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But I have no source for that at the moment.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not sure how my wife will react to raising this issue. Any ideas how to present this or avoid the issue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 19)\n\n<p>First things first, You're human. You can't help being attracted to women, Gd made you that way. Only the whens and wheres are your responsibility. Also remember that this area is a very difficult one to conquer, so don't get down on yourself if you fail to climb Everest the first few, or dozen, or hundred times. </p>\n\n<p>Getting a warning beforehand helps, so you can get your game face on, but that may not always pan out.</p>\n\n<p>Learning Torah out loud works wonders, whether you're in the same room as the women or somewhere else. It puts you on in a different mindset, working with your brain instead of your body. The Talmud <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=kiddushin&daf=30b&go=Go\" rel=\"noreferrer\">discusses this</a> as a first line of defense against sin. For back up in case you can't find a sefer or don't have one, learn something small by heart; A mishnah or passuk, (preferably mishnah), that resonates with you to recite, or think to yourself if you are self-conscious.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=brachos&daf=29a\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Brachos 29a</a> Gives more valuable advice. Never trust yourself. Assume, <em>know</em>, that at the first opportunity you will stare, flirt, etc. Act accordingly. Look at them once, warmly. Give them a big ol' smile, welcome them, and that's the extent of your job as the host here. They aren't here to see you and if they are you have other problems. Don't look at them again, you know what will happen if you do, don't rationalize. If they address you directly, glance at them to indicate that you heard them, then look at your toes while you answer. The gift of bad vision can help here as well as attractive women can become hazy blobs by removing glasses. If you're really having a tough time, look at your beautiful wife, and appreciate what she's doing for you here. She's your lifeline!</p>\n\n<p>One more thing that has helped me is to get to know husbands. Talking about Torah with them for even 5 minutes will bring you closer. Then, only think of these women in the context of their husbands, your friends who you respect and care about. For example I have my friend Ploni's wife's number in my phone. Her name is  Rena, (translates roughly in to Joy). I've known them both since high school and I care about both of them very much. Her name in my phone is \"Ploni's Joy\". </p>\n\n<p>Taking this one step farther, at the risk of sounding like a chauvinist, try thinking of all women as vital parts of their current, or future husbands, instead of just as women which in your mind will almost always lead to sexual objectification without you even realizing it. This intellectual exercise can stave off the thoughts and feelings that are often invoked by attractive women. </p>\n\n<p>I wish you much success in this. We can't ever beat our Yezer Harah completely, the important thing to remember is to remain vigilant and never give up. To quote Mickey Goldbell, there's always \"One more round!\"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 12)\n\n<p>The commandment to avoid negative reactions is on you, not your wife nor her friends.  Of course they shouldn't be deliberately provocative, but if, for example, a normal conversation held in one part of your house bothers you in another part because of <em>kol isha</em>, or if the visitor is dressed appropriately and you are still distracted, this is largely a problem for you to solve.  That's not meant to be unsympathetic; I'm just saying there's a limit to what you can ask your wife or her friends to do on your account before you have done everything you can at your end.</p>\n<p>It's not unusual for one member of a couple to have friends independently of the other.  In that situation there's nothing wrong with saying \"hello\" and then retiring to some other part of the house (or they retire instead).  Unless you have a tiny apartment you should be able to separate yourselves without raising eyebrows -- they visit in the dining room while you study in the living room, or they visit in the living room while you go to your office to do stuff online, or whatever.  Unless you're dealing with frequent surprise visits, you should be able to discuss plans with your wife to work out something that works for both of you.</p>\n<p>I don't care to spend time with all of my husband's friends (and vice-versa).  Our conversation usually goes something like this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A: I'd like to visit with so-and-so this week sometime.  Is there a time that would be particularly good for you?</p>\n<p>B: I have a class on Tuesday so I'll be out of the house then; would that work?</p>\n<p>A: I'll ask.  If not, do you mind if we do Wednesday during your World of Warcraft game?</p>\n<p>B: Yeah, I'd totally ignore you then.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key is to <em>talk with your spouse</em> about the visit beforehand.  You both want what's best -- she wants to visit with her friend, you don't want to be uncomfortable, and she doesn't want you to be uncomfortable either.</p>\n<p>For drop-in visits you can exchange basic pleasantries and then retire with something like \"I'm sorry to not stick around, but I really have to (do something)\" or \"...I was in the middle of (something) and need to get back to it\" or the like.</p>\n<p>Yes, this may sometimes be inconvenient for you, and that's unfortunate.

You don't want this to turn into a situation like an amusement park admission sign saying 'you must be this unattractive to enter.' And can you imagine if the women started picking up on this? Imagine the catty insult 'Oh, she is still allowed to go visit. Ha ha ha.' Ok this is all an exaggeration but that's the gist of it.</p>\n\n\n",

Ramban simply states that anything that has moved 4 Amot has changed domain. Baal HaMaor connects this to the 4 Amah area that acquires objects for a person, a connection that bears much thought. Ran does not even mention 4 Amot; he says simply that anything that has been forcibly removed from its previous location can be denoted as having changed domain.</p>\n\n<p>In terms of the other cases you mentioned, such as receiving and accepting in the same domain, there is no prohibition at all. The only prohibitions are moving from one domain to the other (מרה״י לרה״ר או להיפך), and moving an object 4 Amot in a public domain (ד׳ אמות ברה״ר).</p>\n\n\n",

The optimal timing of feminizing genitoplasty has not been determined. \n  Undervirilized males typically have hypospadias requiring surgical reconstruction.

Hypothetically, would Harry Potter receive this punishment, assuming he had been warned and proper judicial procedure was followed? Why or why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 13)\n\n<p>There are several factors to be considered to determine whether or not Harry Potter would be liable to prosecution under the witchcraft clause.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Is he Jewish?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Regarding his Jewishness, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34485/would-harry-potter-be-killed-as-a-sorcerer#comment89147_34485\">as noted</a> <a href=\"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Christianity\" rel=\"noreferrer\">the evidence</a> suggests he is Christian, although this does not preclude him from theoretically being descended from Jews (especially given Rowling's <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jk-rowling-confirms-jewish-character-758725\" rel=\"noreferrer\">statement</a> that Jewish wizards attend Hogwarts), so as per the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34485/would-harry-potter-be-killed-as-a-sorcerer#comment89147_34485\">OP’s request</a>, both possibilities will be taken into account, beginning with the assumption that he is a non-Jew.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Are non-Jews forbidden from performing witchcraft?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_bar_Yochai\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Shimon</a> (Sanhedrin 56b) they are forbidden, but according to those Tannaim who only include 7 <em>mitzvot</em> for <em>bnei noach</em>, they are permitted to perform witchcraft. (cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Meiri\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Meiri</a> there).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam</a> does not mention a prohibition for non-Jews to perform witchcraft implying that that they are permitted. This is also the implication of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahmanides\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ramban</a> (Responsa attributed to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_ben_Aderet\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashba</a>: 283 cited in Bet Yosef YD 179) and the ruling <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F_%D7%92%D7%A9%D7%98%D7%98%D7%A0%D7%A8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. Natan Geshtetner</a> (Le - Horot Natan, VI:78).</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_David\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Raavad</a>, however, implies that non-Jews are barred from performing witchcraft. (Strictures to Hilchot Avodah Zara 11:4).</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, it is unclear whether even if Harry is a non-Jew he would be permitted to perform sorcery under normal circumstances.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Which activities are considered witchcraft?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>A wide range of activities are generally forbidden and many of them are performed by Harry. These include communing with the dead (cf. SHM negative mitzvah #38)[note 1] which Harry perform in book VII (in invoking his dead relatives by dint of a magic ring). And recitation of magic spells (ibid 35) which Harry does on a regular basis. And magic in general (ibid 34). And acting on the basis of predictions (ibid 32), which Harry does by taking the prophecy from book V into account. [note 2]</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, his general activities would be forbidden to a Jew. Even if he were a non-Jew, according to the view that they too are proscribed from performing magic presumably his activities would qualify (as I have not found evidence that the parameters would be different).</p>\n\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>Is there room for exceptions?</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is a remaining consideration. As the OP stated “These students, including the eponymous hero Harry Potter, must cultivate their magical abilities in order to defeat the evil wizard<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34485/would-harry-potter-be-killed-as-a-sorcerer#comment89137_34485\"> [yemach shemo]</a>”\nHarry repeatedly saves his life, and the lives of others from certain death, using magic. Prohibitions are generally waived when danger is present, so seemingly, it ought to be permitted.</p>\n\n<p>However, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_ben_Solomon_ibn_Abi_Zimra\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Radvaz</a> writes that one may not perform magic even to save a life, as it is conceptually related to idolatry (Responsa I:485, cf. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_ha-Chinuch\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chinuch</a> 512).</p>\n\n<p>However, this does not seem to be a universal view, as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tosafot\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosafot</a> hold that it is obviously permissible in order to save a life (Karetot 3b). Some infer this from Rambam as well [note 3].</p>\n\n<p>Thus if he is Jewish, it would be permitted by dint of danger to life. If he is not Jewish, (then even if there is a general prohibition of sorcery), it is even likelier that it would be permitted, as in the event of danger to life as even idolatry is permissible for non-Jews, if the alternative is death, according to one view. (Cf. II Kings 5:18, and Sanhedrin 74-5).</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Luria\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Maharshal</a> (Responsa: 3 and Yam Shel Shelomo Chullin 8:13) cites an influential responsm of Rabbenu Menachem Katz that it is permissible to study and practice magic for the purpose of counteracting other magicians. This includes cases where lives are not threatened. . This is in turn cited by many authorities including the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sirkis\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bach</a> (YD 179), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Falk\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Derisha</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5481-eilenburg-issachar-baer-ben-israel-leyser\" rel=\"noreferrer\">B'er Sheva</a> (Sanhedrin 91a), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliezer_Waldenberg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tzitz ELiezer</a> (IV: 17: Kuntres Refua B'Shabbat ch. 3).</p>\n\n<p>Maharshal's wording (in Yam Shel Shelomo) is:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ומ\"מ לפעמים יראה להתיר אפי' דברים שאין בו סכנת נפש, אלא סכנת אבר ... כי לא אסרה תורה אלא לשאול בהן ולרדוף אחריהן, ולהאמין בהם, שיש ממש בעניניהם, וראייה קצת לדבר, שהסנהדרין היו לומדים כישוף (סנהדרין י\"ז ע\"א) כדי לבטל כישוף של המחוייבים מיתה, וכה\"ג מצאתי בתשו' מהר\"ר מנחם מ\"צ ...ומצאתי לו און מהאי סוגיא דלעיל, דאמרה איהי מילתא ואסרתא לארבא, אמרו אינהו מילתא ושריוה, אלמא דשרי לבטל כישוף, אעפ\"י שלא היה שם שום סכנה, וכ\"ש ע\"י גוי דשרי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Accordingly, all study and practice of defense against the dark arts would be permissible.</p>\n\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Execution of Execution:</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Lastly, it should be noted that the Chinuch (62) writes that witches are only killed in Israel, so even if Harry would be liable he would not be killed. However, this would presumably only apply if he is Jewish, since non-Jewish courts can impose punishments anywhere, and the prohibition still seems to apply (cf. Chinuch 511).</p>\n\n<p><strong>In summary</strong>: Harry would most likely not be prosecuted under the witchcraft clause, as there are many reasons why his activities would be permitted. He is almost certainly not Jewish, and therefore probably not forbidden to practice witchcraft. Many of his activities (although by no means all) are necessary to save lives. Even those which are not necessary to save lives, most of his acts are devoted directly or indirectly to defeat of the dark arts of yemach shemo and others, which would also possibly be permitted.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>[note 1] Although Rambam believes that there’s no such thing as magic, successful magic would seem to remain forbidden in some or all cases. More significantly, were he to realize that magic is real, he would presumably revise his opinion, and conclude that actual magic is prohibited. Additionally, many Talmudic opinions, and later authorities assume that the prohibition against witchcraft refers to actual magic.</p>\n\n<p>[note 2] Although it is possible that this only includes astrological predictions, it seems to include all predictions.</p>\n\n<p>[note 3] See <em>Assiah</em> 75-6 5765 pp. 7-32.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I am certain @mevaqesh answer is correct, but I think it misses the fundamental point.</p>\n\n<p>I am a Christian, so although I treat the Jewish Bible (what we call the Old Testament) quite seriously, I know just a little about the post-Biblical Jewish commentaries. I guess I miss quite a number of issues.</p>\n\n<p>In order to evaluate this question correctly, I guess we need to consider that the Harry Potter universe is the alternative to the one we actually live in, where the difference is that some people (witches and wizards) actually do have special inborn powers, we (muggles) don’t have. Without this alternative universe this whole discussion doesn’t make much sense, I am afraid.</p>\n\n<p>From the point of view of this alternative universe, it seems to me all injunctions in the Bible (especially, I guess, Exodus 22) are meant to us, muggles, trying to do something which has not been given to them. In the Harry Potter books there is actually a person of the school caretaker Argus Filch, who is a squib (a person born to magical parents who doesn’t have any magic himself) and is being mocked for it. As a way to overcome his lack of magic he buys a commercial course called Kwikspell, which promises (most likely falsely) to “learn” magic even squibs.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the injunctions of Exodus 22 would then apply to those who want to use powers which were not given to them, which leads back to our normal (muggle) world, where all magic (or occult) are our muggle attempts to do things which were not given to us. The question whether such false magic is just pure fraud or whether there some sinister spiritual forces is not relevant for this discussion and I don’t want to indulge in it.</p>\n\n\n",

You can't find this in the wilderness, so why did you not bring it from home? </p>\n\n<p>But he did not ask about the knife because that is something which is not found in the wilderness and therefore it was understandable why he brought it with him from home.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, Avraham had to answer: \"Hashem will provide for Himself the lamb\", miraculously, and if not \"for a burnt offering, my son\" - you will be an unblemished offering to Hashem.

Examples I can think of off the top of my head include the kabbalistic benifits that some ascribe to long peyot and unshaven beards, the Nazirite's uncut hair, and a midrash I remember seeing that discussed the personality traits of redheads (I'd have to look it up again to find the source, but I remember it said that red hair is a sign of either complete righteousness or complete wickedness, bringing David HaMelech and Eisav as examples). In fact, <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380701/jewish/Kabbalistic-Hair-Styles.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">according to chabad.org</a> the Zohar states that \"…from the hair of a person you can know who he is.\" (Zohar, Naso, Idra Rabba 129a)</p>\n\n<p>In constrast to this, I haven't seen much discussing baldness. Are there any sources that discuss what spiritual traits baldness reflects, whether positive or negative?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Alter Rebbe <a href=\"http://chabadlibrary.org/books/adhaz/lkutey/19/54a.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">describes</a> (Start with the ד there and continue) the difference between the Leviim who were completely shaved to prepare for their service in the Mishkan, vs. the Kohanim who kept their hair and beard when anointed.</p>\n\n<p>In very short, baldness represents the level of סובב, transcendence where the highest of spiritual levels and lowest of existence is equal before G-d. Hair shows drawing down such high spiritual levels into levels which are internal and appreciable.</p>\n\n<p>To give an analogy (which is referenced in that location, but appears in various places in Likkutei Torah at length), doing Mitzvos in this world connects to סובב - transcendence - or higher, but is not appreciable. Gan Eden is where we can appreciate the spirituality, but it is therefore much more limited, so that it doesn't overwhelm us. This is why the Mishna says <a href=\"http://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%93_%D7%99%D7%96\" rel=\"nofollow\">יפה שעה אחת</a>, it is better to have one hour of Teshuva and Good Deeds in this world than the whole World to Come, even though it says that this world is only a preparation for the World to Come, because in this world doing Mitzvos connects to a level unattainable if it is appreciated, and more can be spiritually accomplished here.</p>\n\n<p>Baldness represents that transcendence, whereas the hair represents the idea of revealing that spirituality in the world. The hair is very distant from the life of the body, as represented by the fact that it can be cut off without pain, similarly the spirituality drawn into this world is very distant and much lower than its source.</p>\n\n<p>Korach's failing was that he didn't recognize that his spiritual station was to elevate things into the spiritual (Gevurot - strength, the idea of song, which is what the Leviim did in the Mishkan) and connect with the transcendent and instead wanted to use his spiritual connection to draw down such high levels into the world, which would have been destructive - causing excessive judgement - when the world is not in a state to be able to take such revelation.</p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/1584699/jewish/On-To-Elisha-325.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> towards the end where he speaks to the same thing, and explains Elisha's baldness in this context as representing the good aspect of what Korach was trying to accomplish. Footnote 6 there is basically speaking around the same concepts as above.</p>\n\n\n",

Can anyone recommend something online for this?</p>\n\n<p>UPDATE: to clarify, looking for pshat type analysis, like the malbim on tanach</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"http://store.kehotonline.com/index.php?stocknumber=EP-SIBC\" rel=\"nofollow\">new Kehot siddur</a> has a good starting point for those who need an English translation that focuses on being conversational, with enough of an explanation to provide some depth. On the online sample at the link, they have the first page of Shemonei Esrei (both the Hebrew side, and the english translation side) so you can see specifically if it is what you are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>For those who already comfortable with Hebrew, for depth there is nothing I have seen like the <a href=\"http://www.seforimsets.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=1240\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siddur Shai Lamora</a> (although the online sample at that link is only about the first blessing of the morning). There are couple of caveats with it though, which may be good or bad, depending on what you are looking for. It is very wide-ranging, exploring kabbalistic and simple meanings. So the simple meaning is there, it just isn't the only thing on the page. Second is that it relies on what was said previously. So if you skip straight to Shemona Esrei, you won't get everything it said, for example, about the structure of a blessing in general and what it means, or what Hashem's name means, things like that.</p>\n\n<p>A more intermediate alternative there is a siddur printed by Kehot (at least it had the Kehot logo on it) where it printed the Siddur with an interlinear hebrew elucidation. I can't find that one online (it was probably printed by their Israel division), but a local book store that carries Chabad items may have it.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would recommend <a href=\"http://www.feldheim.com/pathway-to-prayer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pathway To Prayer</a>\n It's an in depth explanation to the Shmone Esreh as well as many suggestions to concentrate on Tefilla. There are many different versions depending on your Nusach and for which Shmone Esreh you want, It's fantastic and has really made my Shmone Esreh better. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Leff has a book - \"Shemoneh Esrei: The depth and beauty of our daily tefillah\" which does a lot of explaining phrases and ideas.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you are willing to go with Hebrew, the siddur Ishei Yisrael has the commentary of the Gra\"h and the Siach Yitzchak, both of which are very good.  Otzar Hatefillos has the etz yosef and iyun tefillah, also very good.</p>\n\n\n",

A consequence of this argument was Beit Hillel ruling certain children resulting from the ruling of Beit Shamai mamzerim, (individuals who could not marry regular jews), and Beit Shamai ruling certain children of Beit Hillel's ruling inelligible to marry Priests. It also mentions the many arguments they had about ritual impurity. </p>\n\n<p>The Mishnah says that Beit Shamai and Beit Hillel would still intermarry with one another, and they would still borrow utensils from one another. The Talmud, (<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=yevamos&daf=14a&go=Go\" rel=\"noreferrer\">14a</a>), explains that they each was aware of the other's opinion and they would be sure to let one another know of any discrepancies in a person's category of marriageability or a vessel's state of purity. The Talmud <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=yevamos&daf=14b\" rel=\"noreferrer\">further explains</a> that this is meant to teach us that there was camaraderie and friendship between them, despite these arguments, and more that the Talmud mentions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Raban Gamliel and Rabbi Joshua:</strong> Raban Gamliel, the Nasi, or president of the Post-destruction Sanhedrin in Yavneh would frequently discipline Rabbi Joshua, the Av Beit Din, or Head of the Court, for ruling against him, because he felt that it was very important for there to be a united halachic authority in the diaspora, to avoid schism. He was amicable toward him, even during these disagreements, showing affection and declaring Rabbi Joshua his superior in intellect, (Rosh Hashana <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=rosh_hashana&daf=25a\" rel=\"noreferrer\">25a</a>). </p>\n\n<p>After multiple instances of this public reprimanding, the people, feeling that Raban Gamliel was being too zealous and strict with Rabbi Joshua, had Raban Gamliel deposed and replaced by Rabbi Elazar ben Azaria.</p>\n\n<p>The Talmud states that Raban Gamliel himself didn't keep himself from the place of learning, out of bitterness or shame, for one moment. He and Rabbi Joshua got in to an argument about allowing a reputed Amonite convert to marry full-fledged Jews. There was a back and forth, resulting in Rabbi Joshua's being right. </p>\n\n<p>Raban Gamliel, realizing Rabbi Joshua's authority, concluded that he must apologize for his behavior. He went to Rabbi Joshua's house and attempted to open a dialogue with him by observing from the pitch on his walls that he was in the business of charcoal, or a blacksmith. He was not aware that the walls were black because of Rabbi Joshua's poverty. Rabbi Joshua admonished him, saying that he was not a good leader of this generation, because he did not know of the difficulties Sages must go through to feed and sustain themselves, (Raban Gamliel was very rich and Rabbi Joshua was very poor, see <a href=\"http://www.torah.org/learning/ravfrand/5768/bamidbar.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">4th to last paragraph</a>). </p>\n\n<p>Raban Gamliel accepted this admonishment and asked Rabbi Joshua to forgive his austerity. Rabbi Joshua, again utilizing a teachable moment, did not respond, until Raban Gamliel showed humility by requesting forgiveness not for his honor, but for the honor of his father. Rabbi Joshua accepted his apology and sent someone to request that Raban Gamliel be restored to the position of president. When the messenger was ignored, Rabbi Joshua went himself to sue for Raban Gamliel's pardoning and reinstatement. He succeeded, (Brachos <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=brachos&daf=27b&go=Go\" rel=\"noreferrer\">27b</a> - <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=brachos&daf=28a&go=Go\" rel=\"noreferrer\">28a</a>).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>Rabbi Avraham Yitzchak Kook and Rabbi Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld were practically polar opposites in terms of hashkafa (for example, in response to Rabbi Kook setting up the Eretz Yisrael Chief Rabbinate, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%93%D7%94_%D7%94%D7%97%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%99%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Sonnenfeld set up the Edah Hacharedit</a>, refusing to follow the Chief Rabbinate) but greatly respected one another, nonetheless, and were even friends.</p>\n<p>Several anecdotes can be found <a href=\"https://www.bhol.co.il/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=2716234&whichpage=#R_1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, such as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וב\"יחידי סגולה\" של הרב איסר פרנקל מובא בפרק על הרב זוננפלד שבתשובה לשאלת אנשיו מדוע הוא מדבר עם הרב קוק בדברי תורה בפגישותיהם ברחוב, ענה: \"הרב קוק הוא צדיק גמור, אך דרכינו נפרדות!\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"And in \"Yechidei Segulah\" of Rabbi Issar Frankel, it is brought in the chapter on Rabbi Sonnenfeld that as an answer to being questioned by his men why he spoke with Rabbi Kook in issues of Torah when they met on the street, he answered: \"Rabbi Kook is a completely righteous person, but our paths differ!\"\"</p>\n<p>Another one:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגאון הרב מנחם יהודה אושפיזאי זצ\"ל ליווה בבוקר אחד מחגי השבועות את הרב קוק בדרכו לכותל לאחר תפילת ותיקין בבית מדרשו, בית המדרש של ישיבת \"מרכז הרב\" בזמנו. בסמטה שליד הכותל נפגשו ברב זוננפלד שחזר מתפילת ותיקין בכותל, ובירך הרב זוננפלד את הרב קוק שיזכה להיות כהן גדול בבית המקדש.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: The great Rabbi Menachem Yehudah Ushpizai zt\"l escorted one Shavuot morning Rabbi Kook on his way to the Kotel after Vatikin prayer at his Beit Midrash, the Beit Midrash of Yeshivat Merkaz Harav, at the time.

Does this fit in with a normal chasidic system? Is this a new thing? I just want clarification because I am a chussid, have a rebbe and I follow one chassidus or I learn from other chassidusen (whatever my rebbe thinks is appropriate for me).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>As far as I know, these people aren't coalesced <em>per se</em> into one group but are comprised of individuals in various communities coming from various backgrounds who have either been drawn to <em>chassidus</em> from other paths of Judaism or see themselves as returning to their (albeit recent in historical context) roots.</p>\n\n<p>To use myself as an example: we descend from <em>chassidic</em> stock on both sides of my family - my father's father <em>A\"H</em> came from a family of Satmar (previously Sighet) Chassidim whereas the rest of my grandparents came from Vizhnitz. All four were from the same area of Hungary-Romania and grew up or studied in the same vicinity. After the upheaval of WWII they emigrated with my folks to the States and while they maintained their Judaism they by and large left the external trappings of <em>chassidus</em> behind, although many of our family <em>minhagim</em> are rooted in <em>chassidic</em> traditions. My father went as far as to incorporate a <em>gartel</em> into his regular prayer ensemble and has worn a <em>tish bekishe</em> at Shabbos meals, but nothing much beyond that.</p>\n\n<p>I myself was looking for more than that, having been reared in primarily Lithuanian-style <em>yeshivot</em> and emerging very much dissatisfied with that <em>weltanschauung</em>. I was drawn to <em>chassidus</em> initially by the stores of mysticism and miracle makers, which gelled very nicely with my background of sci-fi and fantasy, et al. The stories and teachings of Elie Wiesel and Shlomo Carelbach brought me in much deeper until I knew that I had to continue my study much more seriously. I briefly explored my roots (e.g. Satmar, Vizhnitz and other Hungarian courts) but did not find very much appeal there. While I began to delve deeply into (early) Chabad and Breslov torah I also recognized that there were aspects of both that I couldn't make peace with. I have yet to affiliate myself with any particular strain of <em>chassidus</em>, nor do I only focus exclusively on <em>chassidus</em> either. I have identified individuals who I would love to study from and possibly follow but distance makes that difficult.</p>\n\n<p>At this time I consider myself a \"Ronin\" and I have met others like me. That doesn't mean that we're not searching but we haven't found \"the one\" yet.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are some communities such as that of Congregation Aish Kodesh in Woodmere, NY that is also comprised of disparate types from various backgrounds; a common factor is a search for deeper meaning in their <em>avodah</em> and their Rav, Rabbi Moshe Weinberger is a dynamic personality.

What do the rabbis teach us?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The collective term for Jewish Laws is called \"Halacha\" (litterally, \"The walking\", or \"the path\", or \"the way\")\nHalacha includes the misphatim, chukim, Mitzvot, Torot, etc.</p>\n\n<p>\"Walking in the way of Hashem\", normally means doing good deeds, visiting the sick, clothing the naked, taking care of the poor, burrying the dead, and other good acts that the Torah describes Gd as doing for individual people.(Talmud Bavli, Sota 14a and Shabbat 133b)</p>\n\n<p>The hebrew term \"Holech\", can mean both \"walk\", but also \"go\".  So an alternative translation might be,  \"Go in the way of Hashem\".  Act how he does towards others (the pleasant ways, not the harsh punishing ways.. as it says \"Her ways are ways of pleasantness\" (Proverbs 3:17)) and follow the Mitzvot, and other teachings which we call \"Halachot\" (Or \"walkings\")</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the talmud shabbat 133b on the verse in parsha beshalach \"Zeh keli v'anveyhu.\" Abba Shaul states that \"V'anveyhu\" teaches us to emulate Hashem: \"Ma hu rachum v'chanun, af ata rachum v'chanun - Just as Hashem is merciful and compassionate, so too, you [i.e., man] should be merciful and compassionate.\" (Shabbos 133b). This is how we \"beautify\" Hashem - by emulating His attributes.</p>\n\n<p>the reason it is called \"walking\" in his ways is because it requires training until it becomes second habit, like walking. in fact the hebrew word for foot \"regel\" has the same root as \"ragil\" (habit) see Rambam hilchos deot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>My own way of understanding this, is that:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>All paths that walk toward G-d, lead to G-d.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That is, not all paths walk toward G-d!  But all that do, will lead to G-d.  Judaism never says that only Torah leads a person to G-d.  The seven Noahide laws are provided as a way for gentiles to get to G-d.  </p>\n\n<p>But even Talmud says \"It is not in Heaven.\"  That is, G-d has given us so much information, and now we must use it the best we can, and make the most of it.  If we are honestly doing what we can to walk a righteous path toward G-d, we will indeed get there.</p>\n\n<p>There is no single path.  Even the most traditional rabbi will agree, that if the tradition in one village is slightly different than in another, it is not because one is more right than the other!  The system allows for many branches over all time.  It is what keeps Judaism alive.</p>\n\n<p>The answer to your question is that the path is a metaphor, but even more than that.  As a metaphor, imagine G-d is the top of the mountain, and the various paths up are difficult and require hard work and often a guide. Some paths are easier as they are warn smooth by many followers.  Some are treacherous, and untested.  Still, as long as you keep working with the goal in mind, you will get there.  But if you turn around and take the easy way downhill, you are going the wrong direction.  You must climb the path toward G-d to get up to the top, to G-d.  That is the way.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason for this is to combine the themes of destruction of Amalek present in both (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.30a.18?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Megillah.30a.18.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on 30a</a>).</p>\n\n<p>However the original obligation didn't have a specific time attached to it (see Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Positive_Commandments.189.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaMitzvos: Assei 189</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.5.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil.

(<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.15.1-35?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Samuel ch. 15</a>).  This was definitely not a regular scheduled event.

May one attend but not eat the food, for example, or must one not attend?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To sum up what's been said, there are three concerns involved of what people might think when seeing you in a non-kosher restaurant:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>\"If Moshe eats there, it must be kosher.\" (This is especially a problem with a \"kosher-style\" restaurant, or one with a very questionable hechsher.)</li>\n<li>\"I know it's prohibited, but if Moshe eats there, it must be one of those prohibitions that nobody really keeps anyways.\" </li>\n<li>\"Uch, Moshe is a disgusting bum! He eats non-kosher!\"</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The OU did a few lectures a few years ago called \"keeping kosher in and out of the workplace.\" As Fred indicated, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein felt that entering a non-kosher restaurant was a serious problem, but would be lenient if someone needed to use the restroom. Whether to apply that same logic to family ties, I don't know.</p>\n\n<p>Many OU poskim have indicated that today, when keeping kosher is not unpopular, they felt if a yarmulka-wearing Jew is seen in a non-kosher restaurant in a big business district, with a bunch of colleagues, all professionally dressed, at 12:30PM on a Wednesday, with binders and briefcases all over the table, that a reasonable person would conclude he just had to attend this business lunch, not that he's eating. (And he could even order a kosher soda in a clean glass.) The same OU poskim also stressed that this was for business purposes, it doesn't mean \"go hang out with your buddies on a Saturday night at a non-kosher restaurant, but just drink the soda.\"</p>\n\n<p>The question of whether the same leniencies applied to a business lunch extend to a family event is one that a rabbi would have to determine on an individual basis, depending on the particulars of the situation. (Additional concerns here, assuming the relatives are Jewish -- we don't recommend hanging out when Jews are eating non-kosher, and your presence shouldn't be seen as validation of what they're doing.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question seems to concern balancing considerations of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marit_ayin\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>mar'is ayin</em></a> and <em>shalom bayis</em> (family harmony). One source you might consider is the ruling of R' Moshe Feinstein (<em>Igros Moshe</em> OC 2:40) regarding entering a non-kosher restaurant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And therefore, there is even reason to prohibit entering to eat items that are known to definitely be kosher (e.g. prepackaged items with kosher certification -Fred) due to <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=920&pgnum=168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>mar'is ayin</em> and <em>chashad</em></a>. But if he is really distressed, and there's nowhere else to go to eat, he may enter to eat food that is known to be kosher, but he must do this surreptitiously. For in circumstances of distress or loss, the rabbis did not decree prohibitions.</p>\n<p>This is provided that nobody outside recognizes him (possibly this includes Jewish people outside that don't know him but can tell by his clothing that he is Jewish -Fred). As far as the people inside the restaurant, they will be able to see that he is only ordering known kosher items. But if there are people outside who could recognize him, he must tell them that he is really distressed and that he is therefore entering to eat items that are known to be permitted. But if he is not very distressed, he should not enter at all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For a definitive answer on how <em>shalom bayis</em> considerations would affect the halacha in your situation, please <a href=\"http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/CYLOR\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CYLOR</a>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Based on R' Moshe, it would seem that there is actually a difference as to the location of this restaurant. If you'd go in and others would recognise you, then it's an issue of 'chashad' which is far worse than 'maris ayin' (mideoraisa vs. miderabanan).\nR' Moshe said that providing that everyone who's there recognises that you're not actually eating there and no-one else recognises you going in (thereby avoiding any 'chashad'), you can eat there if absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>See: <a href=\"http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/eating-in-non-kosher-restaurant.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://doseofhalacha.blogspot.co.uk/2014/05/eating-in-non-kosher-restaurant.html</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna (Shekalim 3:2) writes that there is an issur derabanan to do certain acts which will give others the impression – maris ayin - that prohibited acts are permitted. R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 4:82) writes that there is a similar prohibition, chashad, which is giving others the impression that one is performing an averah. This would be prohibited mideoraisa.</p>\n<p>R’ Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC 2:40) writes that one shouldn’t eat even obviously Kosher food in a non-Kosher restaurant, as others will either assume that the restaurant is Kosher (maris ayin), or assume that they are eating non-Kosher food (chashad). Only under extenuating circumstances would one be allowed to eat there. This would include either missing out on an important deal or being really hungry and having nowhere else to eat. Likewise, if one needed to use the facilities there and had nowhere else to go, they could enter. One should go in an inconspicuous manner and ensure that no one outside recognises them without knowing why they’re entering.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If it refers only to <em>Trei Asar</em>, then reversing direction at the end of the <em>haftarah</em> of <em>Hadavar</em>, which is from the book of <em>Yirmiyahu</em>, does not present any problem.</p>\n  \n  <p>The authorities dispute which interpretation of the <em>beraisa</em> is correct. The <em>Kesef Mishneh</em>, indeed, rules that <em>ein medalgin lemafrei’a</em> applies only to <em>Trei Asar</em> and nowhere else. However, the <em>Magen Avraham</em> disagrees and understands that <em>ein medalgin lemafrei’a</em> applies to the works of any of the prophets. It is possible that our custom of skipping backwards when reading <em>Hadavar</em> is based on the <em>Kesef Mishneh</em>’s understanding of the <em>Gemara</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n \n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>[T]he <em>Terumas Hadeshen</em> contends, those who explain that <em>Chazal</em> prohibited switching prophets in mid-<em>haftarah</em> because of <em>tircha detzibura</em> will conclude that this is permitted when the <em>haftarah</em> is in book form ... Based on this approach of the <em>Terumas Hadeshen</em>, we may be able to permit going back to two earlier <em>pesukim</em> to conclude the <em>haftarah</em> of <em>Hadavar</em>, if we assume that the prohibition of <em>ein medalgin lemafrei’a</em> is because of <em>tircha detzibura</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n \n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Other authorities provide a different reason to permit reading <em>Sos Asis</em> after a <em>haftarah</em> from a different <em>navi</em>. They explain that these verses are not considered part of the <em>haftarah</em> but a concluding song after the <em>haftarah</em> (<em>Beis Yosef, Orach Chayim</em> 144, quoting <em>Nemukei Yosef</em>; <em>Levush</em> ad loc. 144:2) ... [A]dding some verses for a pleasant conclusion is not considered part of the <em>haftarah</em>, and therefore does not violate the <em>takkanas chachamim</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is followed by several posukim dealing with the dialogue between Hashem and Avraham concerning S’dom, and then it says in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8213#v=22\" rel=\"nofollow\">posuk 22</a> “and the men turned from there and went to S’dom, and Avraham was still standing before Hashem”. From this we see that initially they did not actually go to S’dom but merely looked upon it, and only later did they turn from there and go to S’dom.</p>\n\n<p>Why was this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The sefer אמרי שפר <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31411&st=&pgnum=14&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> writes that his father explained that it is well known that the reason for the mitzvah of accompanying someone at the beginning of their journey is in order that the merit of the one escorting should affect the escortee. We see this with Naomi that when she told Ruth to go down to the threshing-floor where Boaz was, she said (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16455#showrashi=true&v=3\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ruth 3,3</a>) “and I will go down to the threshing floor” instead of saying \"you will go down\", because, as Rashi explains, she was saying \"my merit will go down with you\" - and so you should not be afraid that something bad will happen on the way.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, we find in the Torah in the section dealing with the Eglah Arufah that the elders of the nearest city had to stand next to the corpse and announce (<a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9985#showrashi=true&v=7\" rel=\"nofollow\">Devarim 21,7</a>) “our hands did not spill this blood”. Rashi comments: Would it enter one’s mind that the elders of the court are murderers? Rather, what they were saying was that they did not see him and let him depart without food and without an escort. The implication is that if they had sent him away without an escort they would have caused his death and been like murderers, because if they had accompanied him their merit would have gone with him and so his murder would not have happened.</p>\n\n<p>From all this it is clear that the merit of the one escorting influences the escortee in his journey, and for this reason Chazal commanded us in the mitzvah of escorting.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when the angels wanted to go to S’dom to destroy it they had a problem, because Avraham was escorting them to send them on their way and he was a man of Chesed (loving kindness). Thus his escorting would influence them with Chesed so that they would not be able to destroy S’dom. Because of this “the men arose from there and looked upon S’dom”, but they did not yet go there because Avraham went with them. Instead, they waited until Hashem came to speak with Avraham about S’dom, and then they had the opportunity to go to S’dom because “Avraham was still standing before Hashem”.</p>\n\n\n",

The Maharam Schick (Orach Chaim 31) thus writes against the practice of repeating words even for an individual (see also Yabia Omer Vol. 6, Orach Chaim 7:4).</p>\n  \n  <p>There is therefore a virtue of having proper and full intent the first time, and not repeating words.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Some of these methods may present serious halachic issues. Today whey is retrieved also from Swiss cheese and Mozzarella cheese productions. The milk curd in Swiss cheese productions is cooked in temperatures exceeding yad soledes, 120 F. That means that the whey has absorbed the taam, taste, of the non kosher Swiss cheese.</p>\n<p>In order to give elasticity to mozzarella cheese, the cheese curd undergoes a second process. The cheese curds are cooked and stretched in a hot water stretcher (140 F-160 F). This gives mozzarella its elasticity. Although smaller mozzarella cheese companies discard the cook water, larger companies recognizing whey's value have started to retrieve the whey out of the mozzarella cook water. In these cases, where whey is retrieved from hot curd or hot cheese cook water productions, the whey has absorbed the taste from non-kosher cheese and would possibly be subject to the restrictions of gevinas akum.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there are potential leniencies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Interestingly, other Rabbinic authorities postulate a more liberal position regarding whey produced from cheese \"cooked\" at a temperature that had exceeded yad soledes, 120 F. They maintain that in the U.S., cheese is produced using all kosher ingredients. The government maintains strict restrictions and imposes stiff penalties if manufacturers deviate from using cows' milk. The rennet used is largely microbial and even if non-kosher rennet was used, it has undergone so many processes that it is no longer fit for human consumption, eino ra'uy l'achilas kelev. Since the milk and other ingredients were never prohibited, the whey, a milk by-product that was separated from the cheese, has absorbed taste from kosher ingredients and would be permissible. The gezaira d'rabonon for gevinas akum only addresses the cheese curds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That last step in the leniency is definitely the most controversial. It is saying that <em>gevinas akum</em> doesn't forbid what it cooks in. I don't know of many who would pasken that way, even for cheese made from microbial rennet. (Check with your own Rabbi).</p>\n<p>Cholov Yisroel may still be required here, depending on if you say that cheese has to be made from Cholov Yisroel milk, which the Star-K article takes as obvious that it doesn't, but that is not universal (in fact Star-K's <a href=\"http://www.star-k.org/kashrus/kk-EatingHerCurds%E2%80%A6NoWay.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">own policy</a> is to require the milk to be Cholov Yisroel for its cheese).</p>\n<p>So given all of the above it would be a good idea to only drink such Vodka with certification. If it has such certification, I would expect it to be dairy. The CRC <a href=\"http://www.crcweb.org/LiquorList.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Unflavored vodka is acceptable unless the label states that it is produced from grapes, wine, milk, lactose, or whey.

Flavored vodka requires certification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So you can expect to be labeled appropriately if it has a problematic source of alcohol, and according to them that can be relied upon.</p>\n<p>A kosher whey based Vodka <a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=smFVSUWXTbkC&pg=PA485&lpg=PA485#v=onepage&q&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">would be dairy</a> vis-a-vis <em>basar bchalav</em>. Whey is מי חלב and only מי מי חלב is Pareve. I don't know if it is even possible to make alcohol out of that. On the one hand the lactose remaining is minimal, on the other hand, it is hard to dismiss the ingenuity of modern food processing.</p>\n<p>I see you added a comment about it being specifically about non-commercial milk. I mentioned above that this is a matter of disagreement if whey in principle needs to be Cholov Yisroel, but the result is dairy at least.</p>\n\n\n",

The question is asking about somebody with Money which is the meaning of בכל מאודך, and asking why should that be mentioned. And 'Yes' he claimed. There ARE people who will give their life up for money. He had known a personal friend, a Chusid, with a family, a diamond dealer, who committed suicide in the 2001 crisis. </p>\n\n<p>It seems your question is not of that sort.

So it means that he is CONNECTED to our world.</p>\n\n<p>I was not able to find his source, יכולת is not mentioned in the holy scriptures or the Rambam (according to Snunit). </p>\n\n<p>Looking further into the שולחן ערוך I found that they are <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">similar words to the Tur's</a> but slightly different, with a source to his words:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ויכוין בברכותיו פרוש המילות שמוציא מפיו...<br />\n    \"ובהזכירו ..., יכוין שהוא תקיף, אמיץ, אשר לו היכולת בעליונים ובתחתונים; כי \"אֵל\" <br />\n    \"לשון כח וחוזק הוא, כמו: \"ואת אילי הארץ לקח<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Beit Yossef responds: מבואר הוא - it is self-explanatory!!</p>\n\n<p>So Takif, Amitz, Koach, and Khozek - according to them (I find large differences in the biblical meanings between these... but that's not the issue) are all the same. It seems that according to the Tur, the יכולת is only a repetition expanding on the \"power\", adding to it the locations where it can be used בעליונים ובתחתונים in the uppers and lowers (or: above and below). </p>\n\n<p>The Yerushalmi mentions Elyonim (the upper ones) and Tachtonim (the lower ones) only in conjunction with fields that get water first. But in בבא בתרא the Bavli brings the story of Rabbi Yoseph son of Rabbi Yehoshua, (this whole discussion in English is quite awkward...) who saw the mirror image in the under-world, where Elyonim were below and Tachtonim above. Or in other words, in accordance with the spherical shape of the globe, known since Erotostenes and Ptolmey and even earilier at least since 3460 cw, approximately 400 years before Rabbi Yoseph's story took place.</p>\n\n<p>The Tur <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow\">repeats the saying יכולת בעליונים ובתחתונים in section 625 about the Succah</a> saying that the exodus is the proof of Hashem's power in the uppers and lowers. </p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, looking up at Grimoar.cz \"The online Kabalah website\" the exact wording בעל יכולת בעליונים ובתחתונים is repeated in many books: שושן סודות, שערי אורה, ספר הבהיר, דעת תבונות, ברית מנוחה some of which were probably available to the Tur. At least Sefer Habahir is said to have been \"published\" about 100 years before the Tur. </p>\n\n<p>Sefer Habahir reads (I need more that 10 reputation points to post more than two links, so:  grimoar dot cz slash anonym slash sefer_ha-bahir dot htm): </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>פז. כתיב (תחילת קהלת) ולא תמלא אזן משמוע, וכתיב (שם) ולא תשבע עין לראות,<br />\n  מלמד ששניהם שואבים מן המחשבה, <br />\n  ומאי מחשבה? מלך שצריכים לו כל מה שנברא העולם בעליונים ובתחתונים <br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>\"The eye cannot be filled with sight, and the ear cannot be filled with hearing\"\nteaches us that both come from \"thought\" (or: the mind)\nand what is \"thought\"? A king, that everything created above (in the uppers) and below (in the lower) need him.</p>\n\n<p>So we are left with בעל הכחות כולם - Owner of all the powers (which means the unity, and obviously is the פשט simple and literal meaning of אלוקים meaning Gods in the plural. And as the Tur explained אל to mean power - the name means Powers in the plural. And as Moshe Rabeinu tells us: You were shown that <em>the name</em> is the-powers - and none other except him!</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אַתָּה הָרְאֵתָ לָדַעַת כִּי ד' הוּא הָאֱלֹקִים אֵין עוֹד מִלְבַדּוֹ </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li>I changed the names in accordance with the European Jewish custom and in particular those of my ancestors, and teachers, may their memory be blessed.  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In the Bavli, the saying, as written, appears only once, and is in the sad context of a woman giving birth to a child due to rape.  But in the singular: In במדבר Moshe Rabeinu prays to Hashem: <br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ועתה יגדל נא כח ד<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And in דברים You should remember <em>the name</em> your powers, for he is the one who GIVES YOU POWER to collect (meaning: to Succeed).</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וזכרת את ד אלקיך כי הוא הנותן לך כח לעשות חיל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interestingly, in פירוש הראב\"ד לספר יצירה which has been proven to have been written by Rabbi Yoseph Haaroch, who lived at the same time as the Tur, Rabbi Yaakov Ben HaRosh, wrote the following (again, can't link, so: hebrew dot grimoar dot cz slash jecira slash raavad_jecira dot htm):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ע\"ד משל כצורת הבנין בבנאי כי הוא הוא הפועל והוא הוא הצורה והוא הוא התכלית. <br />\n  לפיכך נקראות כל הכחות המצוירות בחכמתו בשם אלהים <br />\n  שנאמר בראשית ברא אלהים <br />\n  כי בו נצטיירו כל הכחות... שלשים ושנים כמספר הקו הסובב לאלכסון עשרה בקרוב.<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As an example like the shape of a building (plan) in the hands of a builder: It is what will be implemented and it itself (recursively) is the shape of the building, and at the same time the goal of the project. <br />\nTherefor ALL THE POWERS possibly drawn in his wisdom are called אלקים (The Powers)<br />\nLike it is written: In the beginning and The Powers created...<br />\n- because in him were ALL THE POWERS... 32 counted approximately like the number of the circumference for a diameter of 10. </p>\n\n<p>So back to the original question:<br /></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>תקיף - He is powerful: which is similar to the belief in any other god<br />\n  בעל היכולת - can (or does) actually apply this power, as opposed to some philosophies of inaction. <br />\n  בעל הכחות כולם - And these powers are in all fields (and not limited to a certain field)<br /></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Hope this helped, I think I did my \"most\"<br /> \nMoshe</p>\n\n<p>--- Edited ---</p>\n\n<p>After explaining what Snunit is, I realized that I had not searched the Medrash literature. עליונים ותחתונים are mentioned about Moshe Rabeinu changing them (within a list of changes in nature by various prophets and biblical figures:</p>\n\n<p>I shoud have remembered it from the recent study of the Daf Yomi in Suca two weeks ago (Hehalil)...

    "content": "# Cooking in a day old pot on purpose\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Generally (setting aside cases of a \"davar charif\" -- spicy thing) if one cooks in a pot that is not \"ben yoma\" (i.e. they cooked milk in a pot that was used for cooking meat more than a day ago) and is clean then the food is permissible b'dieved (after the fact) since we say the taste inside of the pot that will come out is already \"nosain tam lifgam\" (gives a bad taste) and won't make the food not kosher.</p>\n\n<p>This is all of the person unknowingly cooked the food in such a pot. However what about if the person knowingly cooked the food in such a pot. Normally we say don't cook in such a pot because of a decree lest you come to cook in a pot that is \"ben yoma\" and will prohibit the food. However if someone purposely took a clean pot that was cooked in it meat over a day ago and now cooked in it milk, what's the halacha? Do we say that since the taste is no longer good then we'll still permit the food. Or perhaps there will be some sort of \"kanas\" (fine) for doing this and we'll still prohibit the food.</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking this question after having been inspired by the following. There is a Taz in YD Siman 122 who brings from the Darchei Moshe that brings from the Hagos Sharei Durah that if a Jew doesn't know if his cli is ben yoma or aino ben yoma then we give him a kanas and consider the cli as if it's ben yoma (there is much discussion on this Taz including those that argue.) Perhaps this case is much different however it's still that of some sort of \"kanas\" (fine) being imposed even when there might not be any taste in the pot that could ossur.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rav Ovadia Yosef discusses this extensively in a responsum on precisely this topic (Yabia Omer YD 8:14). He cites opinions on both sides, concluding in accordance with the opinions that the food would be prohibited.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See Igros Moshe YD 2:41. That such food is prohibited: This section is taken from <a href=\"http://www.kosherveyosher.com/factory-clean.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.kosherveyosher.com/factory-clean.html</a>\nwhere the entire teshuvah is translated. </p>\n\n<p>Although our Sages enacted a decree prohibiting \"Eino Ben YoMo\", the prohibition bans USING the vessels. It does not, as we just explained, prohibit the foods cooked in them. Our Sages did impose a penalty banning the consumption of the food but only by those who deliberately violated the rule, those who deliberately cooked in such a vessel. The penalty also applies to those for whom the food was cooked. Thus, any Jew, other than those who cooked it and those for whom it was cooked may eat food that was knowingly cooked in a non-Kosher Eino Ben YoMo pot.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>The laws of Baaser V'Chalav are very complex and each question can have various factors that change the outcome of the answer.

We see later on in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9942#v=4\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bamidbar (14,4)</a> that even when they were far away they nevertheless said “let us appoint a leader and return to Egypt” when they heard about the giants that they had to conquer in Eretz Yisrael!

See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/34589/why-did-the-angels-not-go-straight-to-sdom/34590#34590\">this answer</a> on a previous post for more background.</p>\n\n<p>And just as the merit of a righteous person affects in a positive way the person whom he accompanies, so too the wickedness of a wicked person affects negatively the person whom he escorts. Therefore, when Yisrael went out from Egypt and Pharaoh accompanied them on their way (as the Zohar teaches), his intention was to harm them through his escorting by inclining their hearts to want to return to Egypt. But he thought that they would go by the way of the Philistines since this was the closest route, and thus since his intention was that they should go that way, if they had gone that way they would have been strongly influenced by his wickedness and would have been very much inclined to return to Egypt. Therefore, Hashem led them on a different, circuitous route in the wilderness in order that Pharaoh’s negative influence would be severely weakened since this was not the route that he had in mind.</p>\n\n<p>This is what the posuk means: “And it was when Pharaoh sent the people”, that is, when he accompanied them, Hashem “did not lead them by way of the Philistines, because it was near”, and because it was near it was to this route that Pharaoh had channeled his negative influence, and therefore Hashem was concerned “lest the people reconsider when they see war and return to Egypt”. Therefore Hashem made them go around the wilderness so that Pharaoh’s negative influence was weakened, and thus even though we see later on that they still had an inclination to return, it was not so strong and so Moshe was able to stop them. </p>\n\n\n",

It would not be self-criticism to cite these verses. These verses would presumably not be targeting the new nation within the new covenant.</p>\n\n<p>Thus, in <a href=\"http://kodesh.snunit.k12.il//b/l/l2210_101a.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eruvin 101a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1807.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Michah 7:4</a> reads טוֹבָם כְּחֵדֶק, יָשָׁר מִמְּסוּכָה; יוֹם מְצַפֶּיךָ פְּקֻדָּתְךָ בָאָה, עַתָּה תִהְיֶה מְבוּכָתָם, \"The best of them is as a brier; the most upright is worse than a thorn hedge; the day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.\" That only the prophet, who is כְּאָסְפֵּי קַיִץ, \"the last of the summer fruits\", is righteous. But among the people, even the \"best\" is really a briar. Rabbi Yehoshua reverses the ascribed meaning, such that the righteous do exist and their merits protect us. Or alternatively (and this is polemics, mind you) they send the other nations of the world to Gehinnom.</p>\n\n<p>And in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=6&daf=57&format=text\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yoma 56b</a>, it is all about sin and rejection by God. The verse in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt3201.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eicha 1:9</a> reads, טֻמְאָתָהּ בְּשׁוּלֶיהָ, לֹא זָכְרָה אַחֲרִיתָהּ, וַתֵּרֶד פְּלָאִים, אֵין מְנַחֵם לָהּ; רְאֵה יה אֶת-עָנְיִי, כִּי הִגְדִּיל אוֹיֵב, \"Her filthiness was in her skirts, she was not mindful of her end; therefore is she come down wonderfully, she hath no comforter. 'Behold, O LORD, my affliction, for the enemy hath magnified himself.\" This is a reference to the sending of the Judeans into exile. The Christian says השתא ברי טמאים אתון, you are surely impure. As Rashi explains, the intent is  ודאי טמאים אתון ואין שכינה ביניכם שורה בטומאה, you are certainly impure and the Shechina does not dwell amongst you to dwell in impurity. In other words, this is a rejection of God among the Jews. The response of Rabbi Chanina is that God dwells amongst them even though they are impure. Thus, אמר ליה תא חזי מה כתיב בהו השוכן אתם בתוך טומאתם אפילו בזמן שהן טמאין שכינה שרויה ביניהן. He said to him, go see what is written about Him (in <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0316.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Vayikra 16:16</a>), השוכן אתם בתוך טומאתם, Who Dwells with them amidst their impurity.

He taught that \"<em>one should be <strong>like</strong> a servant who serves the master withoutexpecting a reward...</em>\"</p>\n\n<p>Somewhere along the chain of oral transmission<sup>1</sup>, Antigonus' teaching was misinterpreted to be saying that we don't get a reward in the afterlife, for there is no afterlife<sup>2</sup>. The students broke into two sects, stemming from their respective teachers. Their beliefs seem to be uniform.</p>\n\n<p>Notice that the end of his saying has a phrase in AdR\"N that is not present in <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/2165/jewish/Chapter-One.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Avos 1:3</a>, </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><em>...

Both of the verses that Sadduccees cite in your question are not from the Five Books of Moses. They are from Lamentations and Michah, respectively, neither of which were accepted by the Sadduccees as binding as a source for Law or tradition.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So it would seem that</strong> the Sadduccees were citing verses that did not reflect badly on themselves, but only on the Pharisees,  who use the 19 books of Nach to derive many traditional practices. They were essentially saying that if the books of Nach are binding and authoritative, Like the Five Books of Moses, than you must be impure, and you must be at best thorns, etc.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup><strong>1.</strong> The commentator in the left column of the page I cited from AdR\"N argues with R' Obadia of Bar Tenura about whether this was Zadok and Boethus themselves or their students.</sup> </p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>2.</strong> Evidently the saying was misconstrued to be a statement of fact (we <em>are</em> servants who serve Gd without reward), rather than a motto (we should <em>be like</em>).</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Dr. Lawrence Shiffman, the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls were themselves a Sadducce group.</p>\n\n<p>The Scrolls literature gives us a great deal of insight into how the Dead Sea Sect viewed themselves.</p>\n\n<p>For example, in the Damascus Document, CD, the sect refers to their own founding as God's establishment of a \"faithful house in Israel\" - the earliest Hebrew form of the phrase, \"Bayit ne'eman b'yisrael.\"\n(See: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_Document\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_Document</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, from 4QMMT, Miqsa'at Ma'aseh HaTorah, also known as the halakhic letter, it is clear that they view themselves in direct continuity with the laws of Moses, the prophets, and they exhort the other Jews to follow in the example of the righteous Kings of Israel.</p>\n\n<p>(See: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_Document\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_Document</a>)</p>\n\n<p>From this it is clear that the Sadduccees thought of themselves as Jewish, and of their opponents as Jewish. However, they saw themselves as in possession of the truest expression of God's will, exemplified in their adherence to the Solar Calendar of the Book of Jubilees.</p>\n\n<p>That means they were very similar to other Jews - they thought they were right, and that other groups were wrong.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could the time of when the Azazel red strip turns to white be imprecise?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Yoma on 67a, in the middle, it talks about the where the strip of red wool should be tied before sending the goat off the side of the mountain.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I understand (and with the help of the Artscroll's commentary), it is saying that half of the strip should be tied to the rock and half to the goat's horns.</p>\n\n<p>This appears to be because \"when the strip turns white, the designee may be satisfied that atonement has been achieved, and he may neglect to push the Azazel goat off the cliff.\" (Rashi + Artscroll)</p>\n\n<p>My question is: How could such an instance possibly happen? Isn't the change of color of the wool a miraculous occurrence? It is not like it is a \"natural\" function of atonement that wool should turn from red to white. And if it is something miraculous, we understand that it is beyond nature and certainly something that Hashem would not let happen a second too early or a second too late. So, how could the Gemara even consider the possibility that the strip would change color before the person with the goat has finished his duty?</p>\n\n<p>And, I suppose a second, related question is: If the strip <em>did</em> turn white before he pushes the goat, then what purpose need he continue to do the Azazel service? It seems like atonement has been achieved.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> (<a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=yoma&daf=67a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">ibid</a>) clearly distinguishes between the whitening of sin and the commandment of the goat. This strongly implies that while the two may be correlated, they are ultimately independent and one does not necessarily cause the other.</p>\n\n<p>In other words, The whitening of sin was not necessarily always the direct result of the goat's death. Likewise, the commandment of the goat was not dependent on the goat's death causing the whitening of sin.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Maimonides</strong> in his explanation of the Mishnah mentions the Talmud's question. He explains that the cloth is not all tied on the cliff because \"<em>maybe it will whiten before the pushing of the goat, and they will think that the sins are atoned for before the pushing of the goat</em>\". They will think in this instance implies that they err in their thought. This suggests that even once the sins are shown to be atoned for by way of the cloth's color, there is still more that must be done. I have come across two possible understandings of this:</p>\n\n<p><strong>1.</strong> See Zevahim <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=zevachim&daf=6a&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">6a</a> and <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=zevachim&daf=7b&go=Go\" rel=\"nofollow\">7b</a>, concerning <em>'floating atonement'</em>,\n   (as opposed to full atonement). I have done some research in the past\n   on this concept. It seems that a floating atonement provides such,\n   but is not desired, so to speak, to the extent that one would\n   fulfill and obligation to bring a sacrifice. </p>\n\n<p>So perhaps the bringing of\n   the goat to the desert provided the essential atonement, however the\n   full on atonement and obligation would not be entirely met until\n   the goat was pushed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> See also Zevahim 7b, where the elevation offering is said to be a\n   <em>'gift'</em>. Rabbi Simeon explains that it is generally brought after the sin offering, because the sin offering is like the defender that\n   sues for pardon. Once the pardon is achieved the elevation offering\n   follows as a gift. </p>\n\n<p>I take this to mean that even once a person has attained forgiveness in judgment, and will no longer be punished, there may still be an emotional blemish in the relationship; a lack of trust or the like. There may also still be a flaw within the offender, from the poisonous act they committed. The elevation offering serves to restore a person to their original state of favor before Gd, and to remove the blemish of one's sin. </p>\n\n<p>So perhaps the bringing of the goat to the desert serves as a sin offering would, while the throwing of it over the cliff acts as the elevation offering, which does not formally atone, but still does much in the way of repairing our bond with Gd!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Look further the gemara:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>בראשונה היו קושרין לשון של זהורית על פתח אולם מבפנים וכיון שהגיע שעיר\n  למדבר היה מלבין וידעו שנעשית מצותו </p>\n  \n  <p>Originally they used to tie the thread of crimson wool to the\n  entrance of the Ulam within, and as soon as the he-goat reached the\n  wilderness, it turned white. Then they knew that the commandment\n  concerning it had been fulfilled, (<em>Translation: Soncino</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In earlier times, the thread would change color, before the goat was pushed off the cliff. See also Rabbeinu Elyakim who writes that the commandment was fulfilled when the goat reached the cliff:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>וידעו  שנעשת מצותו,</strong>  שהגיע לצוק</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>See also the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naftali_Zvi_Yehuda_Berlin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Netziv</a> in his <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40995&pgNum=108\" rel=\"nofollow\">מרומי שדה</a> who says something similar:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p><strong>היו קושרין לשון של זהורית כו'</strong> וכיון שהגיע שעיר למדבר היה מלבין וידעו שנעשית מצותו. ואף על גב שעדיין יש להגיע לעזאזל, מכל מקום בזה כבר\n  נעשה המצוה...\n  דא״צ רק שיגיע למדבר שהיא עיקר המצוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The Netziv proves his point from Rashi on 68b. There Rashi writes the כהן may not start another duty until the goat reaches the wilderness.

A bare reading of these and the other accounts in the tractate would seem to suggest a vast proliferation of the death penalty.

Moshe Feinshtein's leniency allowing industrially produced milk to not be watched by a Jew during the milking. His basic argument is that the Ramo says in Shulchan Aruch (Y.D. 115) that if a Jew walks in after the milking started, since nowadays non-Kosher milk isn't found at all, it can be permitted. The Shach and the Taz take it even further, that this only applies if the cow belongs to the Jew.</p>\n\n<p>So his question (nicely restated) seems to be: If a non-Jewish worker, working for a Jew and for the Jew's milk with the Jew's cow, still needs to be actually watched at least most of the time even though he has no financial incentive to improve the milk supply, how is that different than industrial milk production that we should say that a Jew doesn't need to see it at all? Even the Ramo seems to require some direct supervision, even if he is allowing the cow to be owned by the non-Jew.</p>\n\n<p>I'm wondering what answers are proposed to that question?</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1 - A very controversial book in its time (1973). The purpose of it was to argue with R. Moshe Feinshtein's Teshuvos which were, in the author's opinion, too lenient. The author uses very nasty language (lies, ignorant words, etc.) against its target, and thus while it's content is viewed as making some good points, its language against its antagonist was regarded as unacceptable and thus the book widely ignored.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I do not think every question requires an answer. however this author obviously did not pay attention to Harav Moshe Zatzal's reasoning. The simple reason why HaRav Moshe allowed this was due to the severe financial penalties a company would incur if they lied and passed off something else as cows milk. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Hirhurim, quoting the OU (<a href=\"http://torahmusings.com/2010/12/update-on-cholov-stam/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://torahmusings.com/2010/12/update-on-cholov-stam/</a>) the milk itself is tested before it can be packaged and marketed.  </p>\n\n<p>\"Even one pail of milk from other species intermingled in a silo sample of cow milk would show up in the results and indicate that the milk is not pure cow milk.\"  </p>\n\n<p>Additionally, milk in each tanker can be traced back to the farms it came from, by samples and a paper trail.</p>\n\n<p>In effect, the milk in the milk supply is certified by multiple competent professionals, with additional proof.

Moshe holds, not like the Pri Chodosh and others, that Cholov Yisroel is a Takkanah and the estimation of there being no treif animals milked, it just isn't economical, etc. doesn't create a heter.</p>\n\n<p>2) That R. Moshe has an opinion (he called this R. Moshe's own Chiddush) that witnesses don't have to see something, they have to know it (עדי ידעה ולא עדי ראיה). As distinguished from deducing it. With the exception of capital cases. This doesn't apply to just Cholov Yisroel, but in general. </p>\n\n<p>So he answers that here in S\"A, the case is one of deduction. There are no non-Kosher animals as far as we know, so we deduce that he isn't hiding one somewhere, or hiding other milk somewhere, so by being there we know. However, if no Jew shows up at the milking, it is only a deduction, not knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>However, in the case of government inspection, it creates, according to R. Moshe, a knowledge, not merely a deduction.</p>\n\n<p>I won't pretend to understand where and how you make that distinction (and Rav Reisman doesn't really elaborate much on how you apply such a determination here, rather he just says that R. Moshe says it), but it answers the question that this is the distinction being made.</p>\n\n\n",

And, it does seem accurate that Don Yitzkak Abarbanel thought either we should not, or at least that we don't have to.  I am not conversant enough in Hebrew to read the linked article about Don Yitzkhak's views, but R'Yehuda Nachshoni (trans., Shmuel Himelstein, Studies in the Weekly Parashah) writes:</p>\n\n<p>\"Abarbanel... Holds that Shmuel's opposition [to appointing a king] was the correct course to be followed, and there is no obligation to appoint a king.  Abarbanel answers all the attempts to show the contrary, and also shows how the words of Chazal can be in keeping with his view.\" (p. 1294; on Parasha Shoftim).</p>\n\n<p>R'Nachshoni's writing on this topic presents a lot of the arguments, and Don Yitzkhak's responses.  It is under the heading \"The Regime of the King and the Regime of the People\" in the Art Scroll edition.</p>\n\n<p>The OP's statement that \"Because by praying you becoming a slave to whatever you pray to. But anarchism (except of some small branches) do not support master-slave relationships.\" is also not, I think, a valid objection.  The central aspect of anarchism is lack of a coercive relationsip among humans.  I don't think most anarchic schools of thought would call a \"voluntary\" decision to submit yourself to HaShem as a master-slave relationship.</p>\n\n<p>The question of whether the mitzvah to set up courts is necessarily violated by anarchy is a more difficult question.  But, one can again imagine an anarchist allowing voluntary submission to beis din.</p>\n\n<p>Anarchy doesn't actually mean everyone just do what they want.  This is a major misunderstanding.  What it really means is lack of coercion and lack of hierarchy.  Most anarchists imagine a world of voluntary association and mutual aid, and that seems to me to be very consistent with the Jewish worldview.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi J. Sacks has an essay in his haggadah called \"Building a Society of Freedom.\"  Judaism, R' Sacks argues, holds dearly the idea that we are all equal; we all have tzelem Elokim (I'm not sure R'Sacks explicitly makes that connection, but it seem obvious).  He approvingly quotes Paul Johnson: \"The Jews had this gift.  To them we owe the idea of equality before the law, both divine and human.\"  </p>\n\n<p>But, he also argues that freedom is another central aspect of Judaism.  We see this in Shabbos, Shmitta, and Yovel, where we see freedom in time; we also see it in the Torah's general concern for the poor.  \"A society in which the few have wealth\" (and, I would add, in which the few have power) \"and many are on the verge of starvation is not free by the standards of the Hebrew Bible.\"</p>\n\n<p>I'm not saying that any of this proves that it is halachically acceptable to be an anarchist.   Certainly the existing schools of anarchic thought -- and, more importantly, the society that has grown up around them -- may not fit in a Torah lifestyle.  But, I think that one could imagine an anarchy that would be consistent with Torah.  And, it very well may be that that is the preferred system.</p>\n\n\n",

Not really knowing what to expect, I found the following in The Woman’s Dictionary of Symbols and Sacred Objects (p. 482):</p>\n<p>The braided bread loaves of Germanic tradition were invented by the women of Teutonic tribes, who used to make offerings of their own hair to their Goddess. Eventually they learned to preserve their braids by substituting the imitative loaf, which was called Berchisbrod or Perchisbrod, bread offered to the Goddess Berchta, or Perchta. The name of the braided Sabbath loaf among German Jews, Berches or Barches, was copied from this tradition.</p>\n<p>Could it be that those nice braids that my wife makes when she bakes ḥallah really have their source in pagan goddess worship? The linguist Paul Wexler thinks that the original name was actually the German Holle which was the name of a pagan Germanic goddess to whom braided bread was once given in offering. [The German] Holle was replaced at a later date-under the pressure of Judaization-by the [Hebrew] ḥallah, which bore formal and semantic similarity. (See his book The Non-Jewish Origins of the Sephardic Jews, pp. 68-69 and numerous other places in his writings.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along the same lines:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joshua Trachtenberg, in his book, Jewish Magic and Superstition, claims that Ashkenazic Jews in German lands as early as the 10th century adopted the practice of braiding their ritual loaves from their neighbors who worshipped the goddess/spirit Perchta, or Holda, or Holle. According to Trachtenberg, these German women worshiped the goddess by offering their braided hair! The tradition of the times was braiding loaves of bread, called Perchisbrod, as an acknowledgement of this pagan custom. The Jews of German speaking lands may have embraced this local custom, removing from it any hint of its pagan origins!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more on the religious significance of bread-braiding in antiquity, see: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretzel</a></p>\n<p>For those who prefer a less polytheistic origin for the tradition, see: <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/480266/jewish/Why-Is-Challah-Braided.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/480266/jewish/Why-Is-Challah-Braided.htm</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps the braiding of the challah, which is eaten at the Shabbat table, also represents this idea of unity: how we tie everything together, bringing all the diversity in our lives together for a peaceful harmony and unity that only the Shabbat can achieve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Although this article <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/480266/jewish/Why-Is-Challah-Braided.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/480266/jewish/Why-Is-Challah-Braided.htm</a> doesn't give a date, it offers an interesting insight: \"Most challahs are braided with either three or six strands of dough.

The commentaries there (I think it's the Ran off the top of my head?) say that obviously this would be the case if fasting would threaten the life of the mother; and practically, if it would threaten her pregnancy that would threaten the mother as well (as it's more dangerous to deliver a stillborn than a live baby); but even if we knew the mother would be 100% fine, we would still violate Yom Kippur to save the unborn fetus alone, because it is a \"potential life\" that we want to allow to develop into a full life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In cases of total brain stem death lack of blood flow and oxygen to the brain leads to its swelling and disintegration.  Patients diagnosed as brain dead using rigid criteria will systemically die within a matter of hours or days. However, with “Extended somatic support” which includes special medical efforts, some bodily function can be maintained for much longer periods of time, and a brain dead pregnant woman can often be kept \"alive\" until the fetus is viable for C-section (30 weeks). </p>\n\n<p>Shalom is correct that (at least after 40 days) a fetus is considered a nefesh in Halachah and we are Michallel Shabbat to save a fetus in danger even if it is not yet viable. We violate and suspend all Torah law (save the three cardinal sins) to save the life of a fetus. If brain death is considered Halachik death, we must do all we can to save the fetus, including giving the mother extended somatic care, until the fetus is viable and can be safely extracted via a Caesarean section. </p>\n\n<p>According to the opinions that brain death is insufficient to determine death, such a patient is considered a Goses (or safek goses). We may not move the patient, let alone perform a C-section. While the general rule is that we attempt every measure to prolong life, we don’t initiate new treatments that will only extend life for a relatively short period of time and cause additional suffering. it’s not necessarily obligatory (nor recommended) to initiate any extended somatic support to prolong the life of a terminal patient in the process of dying. </p>\n\n<p>Since the child will not reach viability nor be delivered naturally, we don't even take measures to prolong gestation of a fetus that will never be delivered.  </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, in this particular case, many would rule that while life support should not be withdrawn, we don’t try to keep the mother alive to save the fetus. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# The order of words in the Shemoneh Esrei vs. the order in the prayer of the gabbai\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In the first blessing of the Shemoneh Esrei we say that G-d is עוזר ומושיע ומגן - Helper, Savior and Shield, but before the reading of the Torah on Shabbos morning the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbai\" rel=\"nofollow\">gabbai</a> recites a prayer which starts ויעזור ויגן ויושיע.</p>\n\n<p>Why is the order different in these two places?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Since the first blessing of the Shemoneh Esrei relates the praises of Hashem, these three expressions עוזר ומושיע ומגן follow an ascending order of praise of the way Hashem saves us.</p>\n\n<p>There are several explanations what these terms mean, but I will bring just one of them from the sefer אבני אליהו as brought by the sefer רנת יצחק <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=51878&st=&pgnum=194\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> to illustrate this order:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There are three ways to show one's trust in Hashem when one needs help, and correspondingly there are three ways in which Hashem saves him: </p>\n  \n  <p>1) To do something (make some effort), in which case Hashem is עוזר - helps him by blessing his action with success.</p>\n  \n  <p>2) To do nothing, in which case Hashem is מושיע - saves him without the need for the person to do anything towards his salvation.</p>\n  \n  <p>3) To do something which goes against what is intelligent and for the sake of Hashem put himself in danger, in which case Hashem is מגן - shields all who trust in Him.</p>\n  \n  <p>(And since Avraham trusted in Hashem to the utmost and put himself in danger many times for the sake of Hashem's honor, Hashem said to him: I will be a shield for you, and thus we conclude the first blessing \"Blessed are You, Hashem, the shield of Avraham\".  Similarly, since King David also trusted in Hashem to the utmost, we conclude the third blessing after the reading of the Haftorah \"Blessed are You, Hashem, the shield of David\").</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>But the prayer that the gabbai recites is different because, as the sefer Rokeach and the Machzor Vitri explain, it is a continuation of the אב הרחמן prayer which contains a further six expressions of Hashem's salvation: הוא ירחם...ויזכור...ויציל...ויגער...ויחן...וימלא, making a total of nine expressions of redemption corresponding to our nine exiles. Thus, the order of the words presumably corresponds to the particular aspect of redemption that was needed for each exile.</p>\n\n<p>I don't know which list of exiles they are referring to, but there is however a well known story about Reb Chaim from Volozhin in which he relates that there were a total of ten exiles - Babylon, North Africa, Egypt, Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Poland, Lithuania, and finally America. (Artscroll Biography of Reb Chaim of Volozhin, p.208)</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the order of the last three expressions - the ones mentioned in the question - are the same as the order in the blessing between Krias Shema and the Shemonah Esrei of Shacharis, which talks about Hashem's saving us from Egypt, the archetypical exile:</p>\n\n<p><strong>עזרת</strong> אבותינו אתה הוא מעולם, <strong>מגו ומושיע</strong> לבניהם אחריהם.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are a few examples:</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Bavli, Avodah Zarah 17a</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>And does not one die on renouncing sins other [than idolatry]? Surely\n  it has been taught: It was said of R. Eleazar b. Dordia that he did\n  not leave out any harlot in the world without coming to her. Once, on\n  hearing that there was a certain harlot in one of the towns by the sea\n  who accepted a purse of denarii for her hire, he took a purse of\n  denarii and crossed seven rivers for her sake. As he was with her, she\n  blew forth breath and said: As this blown breath will not return to\n  its place, so will Eleazar b. Dordia never be received in repentance.\n  He thereupon went, sat between two hills and mountains and exclaimed:\n  O, ye hills and mountains, plead for mercy for me! They replied: How\n  shall we pray for thee? We stand in need of it ourselves, for it is\n  said, For the mountains shall depart and the hills be removed!24  So\n  he exclaimed: Heaven and earth, plead ye for mercy for me! They, too,\n  replied: How shall we pray for thee? We stand in need of it ourselves,\n  for it is said, For the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the\n  earth shall wax old like a garment.25  He then exclaimed: Sun and\n  moon, plead ye for mercy for me! But they also replied: How shall we\n  pray for thee? We stand in need of it ourselves, for it is said, Then\n  the moon shall be confounded and the sun ashamed.26  He exclaimed: Ye\n  stars and constellations, plead ye for mercy for me! Said they: How\n  shall we pray for thee? We stand in need of it ourselves, for it is\n  said, And all the hosts of heaven shall moulder away.27  Said he: The\n  matter then depends upon me alone! Having placed his head between his\n  knees, he wept aloud until his soul departed. Then a bath-kol28  was\n  heard proclaiming: 'Rabbi Eleazar b. Dordai is destined for the life\n  of the world to come!' Now, here was a case of a sin [other than\n  minuth] and yet he did die! — In that case, too, since he was so much\n  addicted to immorality it is as [if he had been guilty of] minuth.\n  Rabbi [on hearing of it] wept and said:29  One may acquire eternal\n  life after many years, another in one hour! Rabbi also said:\n  Repentants are not alone accepted, they are even called 'Rabbi'!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Another famous example is \"<a href=\"http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5685-elisha-ben-abuyah\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acher, or Elisha Ben Avuya</a>\"  Who became a complete heretic, even while he kept close relationship with his teacher R. Meir.</p>\n\n<p>And then there is my favorite story of a Rabbi who was kicked out of Yeshiva for asking a question.</p>\n\n<p>Talmud Bavli, Bava Bathra 23b):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A baby pigeon that is found within fifty cubits of a coop belongs to \n  the coop’s owner [the assumption is that it came\n  from the coop].  If it is found outside the fifty cubits, then it\n  belongs to the finder [the assumption being that it came from the\n  wild].  Rabbi Yirmiyah asked:  If one foot of the pigeon is within the\n  fifty cubits and one foot is outside, to whom does it belong?...It was\n  for this that they expelled Rabbi Yirmiyah from the academy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And there is also a stroy about Rabbi Yeshua who insisted that Yom Kippur was on a day other than the court ruled.

In response to a request to visit I've heard responses as direct as \"we don't have a conversion program and can't assist you in your journey\", to the more polite \"any JEW is welcome to come to our synagogue\".  I fully understand protecting the community and wanting to keep the creepers out but at the same time it's a mainstream belief of Judaism that benai Noach have a place in the world to come, therefore Gentiles have no need to convert.

For example, when I was in college, I went to services at the nearby synagogue and found that attending services was a pastor from a local church who, after services and outside, did try to \"preach to the Jews.\"  In Denver (some 20 years ago, I'd guess), a husband-wife Christian missionary team were specially trained to infiltrate a modern Orthodox synagogue under the guise of being willing converts to Judaism.  Their goal was to fraudulently obtain conversion documents so they could make aliyah and set up a church in Israel aimed at missionizing Jews.  </p>\n\n<p>Sometimes at a synagogue I attended in Washington, D.C., we'd get groups of high school kids, either from churches or from reform synagogues, who came to sight-see the Orthodox Jews, like we were animals in a zoo.</p>\n\n<p>But, when the non-Jewish members of my family, and other families of converts, have visited my current synagogue for special occassions, the congregation has gone out of their way to make them feel welcome.</p>\n\n<p>A better experience was at the bar mitzvah of an Israeli officer studying at the U.S. National War College.  He invited his non-American classmates, which included a Syrian Army officer who was surprised about how many prayers there are in the Jewish prayerbook that ask for peace.  He even reported this inforamtion back to his country.</p>\n\n<p>Jews are human; we sometimes know what to do, and often do not.  And when we are struggling to decide an appropriate response to new people, we can fall short on proper etiquette. </p>\n\n<p>I would suggest that non-Jews make their first visit to a synagogue with a Jewish friend, especially someone from that congregation.  Otherwise, non-Jewish visitors should introduce themselves after services (or just before), to anyone and everyone, and let them know why you are visiting, what you hope your visit accomplishes, and what questions you have.  That will break a lot of ice.</p>\n\n<p>Still, any specific synagogue may not be the one for you.  They all have different personalities as decided by their membership.  Since, as a non-Jew, you can travel on the Sabbath, you can look around for the best answer for your place of prayer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In answer to part 2, there are places of worship of B'nei Noach.

However, that does not mean that a non-Jew is a Jew.  There are some communities that have ceased the practice of accepting converts at all for various reasons, but many synagogues are willing to accept to their services those interested in converting.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Jewish communities certainly exist who would welcome your attendance without any intention of conversion.  You need to find one that will, but that may require some persistence.  The trial-and-error process might be frustrating, and you could be hampered by what communities are in your area, but I know of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox communities that are welcoming to non-Jews.  Just don't expect a welcoming attitude in ALL communities or you will be disappointed.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Best way to learn Hebrew to read Torah\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I didn't have the opportunity growing up to learn Hebrew. My goal is to be able to sight-read the Hebrew in Torah.  I have taken several classes in grammar and syntax, and my vocabulary is moderate.  What is the best way to take what I've learned and actually learn to sight-read?  Any approach will involve much practice and devotion, obviously.  That said, what is the best approach?</p>\n<p>I'm also interested to know how many out there can actually do this.  Setting aside the learning one does specific to their bar mitzvah portion, how does one become a successful today reader?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>As a Torah reader for about 25 years, my advice may sound somewhat unconventional, so accept this as my own method that worked for me. It may or may not work for you.</p>\n\n<p>First, learning Hebrew vocabulary and grammar is certainly a good and important start. But, you should also learn Biblical Hebrew, as its grammar is markedly different from \"Modern\" Hebrew. Most notably, the Torah uses \"Vav Hahipuch\" which is a method of adding a vav to the beginning of a verb that \"flips\" a future verb to past and past tense to future. This is one of a few examples where Biblical grammar may be different from modern Hebrew.</p>\n\n<p>It is not necessary to know the meanings of every word in the Torah, but a fairly strong command of grammatical rules will help tremendously in Torah reading. It's not necessary, but it is a big help. It's not 100% required as you could read a Torah portion without knowing the meaning of any words - just by memorizing what to read. But, if you know the meaning, it will help with the verse's grammar. The trope (notes) is primarily for grammatical purposes - not just to sing them. </p>\n\n<p>(When I read, I'm sometimes unsure of the trope. But, since I understand, mostly, what I'm reading, I can tell that if I group certain words with the wrong trope, the sentence meaning may change, or it won't make sense at all. Certain notes have pauses, similar to a comma in a sentence. If you pause (comma) in the wrong place, you change the sentence's meaning or it doesn't make sense.)</p>\n\n<p>It is essential that you practice recognizing Torah script - the shape of the letters in the Torah is significantly different from standard Hebrew font. This may sound trivial, but in my shul, I have a majority of people that have no problem at all reading from a siddur or Chumash, but only about 5 people can read Torah lettering. Along with that, it also helps to have a good vocabulary of most common Hebrew words and know how to read them without vowels. This second skill is not 100% necessary for Torah reading, but it will ease the challenge.</p>\n\n<p>Next, is trope. I've seen almost every Bar Mitzvah teacher teach the names of the trope and how they sound, prior to combining the trope with the actual Torah words. Unless the Bar Mitzvah boy will become a continuous Torah reader, this is a waste of time, IMO. In your case, however, this skill is valuable, but also not 100% necessary.</p>\n\n<p>OK, HOW do you learn trope?</p>\n\n<p>I learned in a pre-computer era. I sat in shul and listened carefully to the Torah reader and followed the notes in the Chumash with listening carefully to the reader. I would focus on a few notes each week until I felt comfortable, then I would focus on another group of notes.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, when I got all the notes and sounds down, I used a Tikkun - which is a book used for studying the Torah reading. Each page has 2 columns - the right side having the font and verses as they appear in the Chumash (in \"regular\" Hebrew) and the left column with how it looks in the Torah scroll. From there, it's memorizing. Do a few verses at a time - start with the normal type column and \"test\" yourself reading from the Torah column. Of course, the more often you practice, the easier it becomes. Keep in mind, that after all these years, I have pretty much memorized the entire Torah.</p>\n\n<p>There are, now, several good computer Torah reading programs available. One of the best ones is called Trope Trainer. I use it, mainly, to print the weekly parsha sheets and I study the parsha during my daily commute. However, I think it is a great disk for a new learner. You can adjust the speed and pitch \"level\" (tenor / baritone / bass, etc.) to your liking. There are even several \"accent\" options (Israeli , various Hassidic styles, etc.) I also like that it has an option that lets you click just one word at a time so you can hear it sung with the note, or go a whole verse or an entire section at a time. This is excellent for reviewing. The disc also has separate tutorials that practice just notes and note \"groups\" (certain notes commonly appear together).</p>\n\n<p><strong>Supp:</strong> See @Shokhet's comment, below this answer. I should have researched this linked answer, myself (too much pre-Shabbat soup made me lazy :-) There's much good practical advice there!</p>\n\n<p>I know I gave a lengthy answer, and, again, my method has several ideas that, hopefully, will work for you. If you can find a Torah reader or some other similar mentor to help you, that would be wonderful. And, remember that the mentor can be online as well. Skype works quite well!</p>\n\n<p>I commend your efforts and wish you success. The population of good precise professional Torah readers, I think, is diminishing these days.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There is a mitzvah to review the parsha that will be read on the following Shabbos twice in Hebrew and once in “Targum”.

It seems fair to say that the classical rabbinic understanding is that the Aramaic translation of the Torah, known as Targum Onqelos, was given to Moses on Sinai. For example, BT Megillah 3b introduces the targum as having been \"composed by Onqelos haGer\" but then clarifies that what it means is that he restored the targum which was given at Sinai but had been forgotten. Rashi adopts this position explicitly in his comment on Qiddushin 49a, s.v. <em>harei ze meharef</em>.\nOn the other hand, of course, contemporary academic scholarship assumes that Onqelos, like other targumim, is a compilation of (anonymous) oral Aramaic renderings of Torah reading, beginning in the Second Temple period and evolving well into the rabbinic period.</p>\n\n<p>So, the question: are there Orthodox* scholars who would agree with some version of the academic understanding of Onqelos' origin? In other words, do you know of any Orthodox scholars who deny the divinity of the targum? (For example, my friend reports that Aryeh Kaplan writes in the bibliography of <em>The Living Torah</em> that \"the Septuagint is the oldest translation of the TaNaKh,\" implying that Onqelos is not from Sinai, but I haven't been able to check that). </p>\n\n<p>Or is this topic as verboten as TaNaKh source criticism?</p>\n\n<p>*I am using the term 'Orthodox' here with some hesitation. I know there are self-identified Orthodox scholars who (attempt to) reconcile their religious beliefs with an acceptance of modern Biblical criticism, e.g. those involved with <a href=\"http://thetorah.com/Authors/\" rel=\"nofollow\">the TABS project</a>. <em>Qal wahomer</em> I assume those people would be on board with a historical approach to Onqelos.

I have also often heard quoted an idea that \"angels have free will, but it is just so clear to them that they should make the right decision that they almost never make the wrong decision.\"  Can anyone provide sources predating the 20th century (the earlier the better) which support this idea?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There's a responsa quoted in <a href=\"http://noahbickart.fastmail.fm/Critical_Editions/Otzar%20HaGeonim/Otzar%20Hageonim_vol.2%28%D7%A9%D7%91%D7%AA%29.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">Otzar Hageonim (vol. 1 pg. 6)</a> about praying to angels, where he quotes several Gemaras and Midrashim that angels have free will. Several commentators, among them Rashi (19:22), discuss this in the story of Sedom where Chazal indicate that the angels may have sinned at various points. Ohr Hachayim there (19:20) takes this a step further and actually says that it was in the hands of the angels to decide who to kill and destroy, once they were given permission to descend (a very literal interpretation of כיון שנתנה רשות למשחית).  </p>\n\n<p>Radak to Beraishis 19:21 states (I'll quote it since it isn't online as far as I know):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נראה מזה כי כשהקב\"ה שולח מלאך נותן להם רשות להוסיף או לגרוע מעט משליחותם כפי אשר יראו ויבינו כי בעלי שכל הם - When God sends an angel he gives them permission to add or subtract slightly as they see fit because they are intelligent beings</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Bachya also writes that though angels <em>don't have free will</em>, they can still make mistakes. See his comments to Beraishis 3:6 (שאע\"פ שאין בהם יצה\"ר הרי הם נוטים לפעמים מן הדרך הראוי) as well as 19:13. As @YEZ pointed out, though, these commentators (Radak, Rabbeinu Bachya, and Ohr Hachayim) probably understand that these angels were mistaken in their judgement, but because they misjudged the situation, not because they have a will to violate God's command or act immorally (as explained by the Ramchal, in Daas Tevunos 2:31).</p>\n\n<p>Returning to the original question, then, we have the letter from the Geonim which strongly implies (I believe) that angels have actual moral free will. I thought the Rambam also believed that angels could theoretically have free will, as he seems to state in Moreh Nevuchim (2:7): \"they have will and choice... though they will always choose the good\". I should point out though that in his introduction to Cheilek, in the fifth foundation, he states unequivocally that angels are not free agents </p>\n\n<p>R. Yonasan Eibshutz also states (Yaaros Devash 1:2, <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pagefeed/hebrewbooks_org_14492_170.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">second column here</a>) that the Torah was given to man who has free will as opposed to angels, but if the angels were on earth, they too would have free will (and do evil). This very idea is actually found much earlier, in Yalkut Shimoni Beraishis 6:44. Both of these ideas sound like the opinion referenced in the question, 'they <em>can</em> choose to do evil but do not because the truth is clear to them'. Such an idea is popular, I think, among contemporary thinkers (such as R. Moshe Feinstein in Derash Moshe, Shemos 1:1)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>this issue is clearly addressed by rebbi yonoson eibeshitz yaros devash vol 1 drush 2</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Eliyahu Lopian citing the 'Sabba' of Kelm in the fomer's work Lev Eliyahu (Wisdom and Ethics, section 1 page 297) states without attribution that angels have free will but are so overpowered by their holiness (closeness to God?) they they choose not to sin. </p>\n\n<p>The author of Shevet Mussar in his work Aggadat Eliyahu (expounding on Yerushalmi Brachot 1:7)  explains that when angels are sent into the physical world they are substantively changed so as to be able to exist in our world which in turn gives them the ability to \"have slight free will\". </p>\n\n<p>In Yaaros Devash (section 1 derush 15) he cites the Zohar 1:117a which explains that God had to take the Jews out of Egypt himself because Egypt was such a place of impurity that if an angel had entered it would have become ensconced in impurity (implying angels have an ability to sin, hence free will).</p>\n\n<p>Ramchal in Daat Tevunos (Chelek Bet, see also Ginzei Ramchal sections 30-34) explains that angels can err without having free will per se, basically through lack of complete comprehension of the divine will.

Proof of His existence would <em>force</em> us to be religious. Something forced can't be considered a \"duty*\". Only when we are not forced, are we <em>able to be</em> <strong>commanded</strong> to use our free will to enjoin Hashem in a relationship, to commit to His ways, and to serve Him. Only when we are not forced are we able to receive reward and punishment. See part 1 of Derech Hashem to walk through the full reasoning of this.</p>\n<p>Let me ask the opposite - why didn't Hashem make it impossible to believe in Him? The answer, which <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=chCzWp1wxak\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">is taught</a> as the meaning of His Name \"El Shaddai\", is the same: in order to be able to give reward**, He has to perfectly \"calibrate\" how hard it is for us to believe in Him, until He is hidden \"enough\". As many answers here have pointed out, there is much going for believing in Him, arguably more than there is for not believing in Him.</p>\n<p>Either way, this is the only range of \"hiddenness\" <em>available</em> for reward and punishment, and we trust He is Just in His judgements on how much <em>emunah</em> we had vs how much <em>emunah</em> it was expected we should have. Indeed, it can be so challenging in this generation because, as many <em>gedolim</em> have pointed out, this is a generation of <em>tinokei shenishba</em> - children raised in captivity. We are so far from Sinai, and in such darkness that we are much less culpable, if at all, for our low <em>emuna</em>. See The Tinok Shenishbah written by Rabbi Chaim Rapoport for the London Beth Din in 5757 on this point.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* i.e. a <em>mitzva</em><br />\n** and punishment, although basic reasoning as well as fundamental Jewish belief is that the <strong>reward</strong> is the <em>point</em></sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Your question is based on your opinion of '(if not most) Jews on this site' which is not relevant to the question of what God expects from us if he seems to be unknowable empirically. It's good that you \"personally disagree with this\", because in order to follow something (like belief in God) you'd better be able to verify the truth for yourself; at least to the level of \"this is compelling enough, compared with other possibilities\".</p>\n\n<p>There are less objective proofs like mathematical proofs of a God (e.g. Kalaam/Cosmological arguments) which base their proofs on mathematical logic - but are basically 'first cause' arguments. This is, perhaps, the closest we can get to an objective 'knowing'. Once a rational belief in God is accepted; naturally more subjective arguments follow about belief in the God as perceived by the Jews.</p>\n\n<p>For this you begin to get into arguments that hinge on Kuzari/revelation type arguments then there is a more subjective nature to this.</p>\n\n<p>I think, for all these arguments on this forum, we needn't set an unprecedentedly high standard for absolute proofs with respect to rationalising God - which people seem to think is really needed. The minimal standard should be \"is this better than any other option\" and then \"how now shall i act\"? </p>\n\n<p>I agree with the suggestion in your question that we should really rationalise the belief in God to ourselves, otherwise whats the point in practicing anything? However, having said this, probably the majority of Jews in the world have not come to a rational belief in the Jewish God. Atheists make this point all the time: \"the likelihood is that you're born into the religion of your parents - how likely is it that you are therefore correct? Inheriting a religious status from your ancestors does nothing towards telling you whether that belief system is true\".</p>\n\n<p>I think its imperative to come to a rational basis for believing in God, otherwise, I agree, \"whats the point\"?</p>\n\n\n",

This would prevent possible conception which might deprive the young child of the breast feeding of his mother.\"</p>\n<p>Now, the reason Onan was spilling his seed on the ground is that he didn't want to father a child with Tamar (38:9).  In other words, he performed <em>yibum</em> but then denied the <em>purpose</em> of <em>yibum</em> -- he sabotaged it to Er's and Tamar's detriment.  It would have been better for him to refuse the marriage in that case.  So we could say that he was punished for this.  The sequence, in any case, is: decide not to fulfill the purpose of <em>yibum</em> -> spill his seed during the act -> punishment.</p>\n\n\n",

However:</p>\n\n<p>I was reading <a href=\"http://dafyomi.co.il/yevamos/insites/ye-dt-034.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Insights to the Daf for Yevamos 34</a>, and in response to a question that implies a Misnha on 33b contradicts a Gemara that says that a woman cannot get pregnant the first time she has relations (which at least today is not the case, but regardless), Tosfos HaRosh seems to say that the case of the Misnhah is where the girl was married before age 3 and had relations then, and therefore the Misnhah still considers the first intercourse after age 3 to be the first time, yet then she is capable of getting pregnant.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The TOSFOS HA'ROSH answers that according to the Girsa of Tosfos (see previous Insight) the answer is obvious. Tosfos explains that the Mishnah refers to a case in which the women became married before they were three years old. Any act of relations performed prior to that age did not constitute relations and the girls are not considered Be'ulos (since their Besulim return until the age of three). Consequently, the act of relations with their husbands after they reach the age of three is considered \"Bi'ah Rishonah.\" (See also RASHASH.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now, I don't totally follow what he's saying, since the Misnhah in question says that minors cannot get pregnant, so it implies that the women getting married must be adults for them to get pregnant. Does it mean that they got married before age 3, had relations, got divorced, and this is their second marrage when they're adults?</p>\n\n<p>Again I think I'm probably just tired and misreading something. But if I'm not, is Tosfos HaRosh really saying that the Misnhah is saying that girls <em>under</em> three years of age used to get married and have sex (be it in the time of the Mishnah or in the time of Tosfos HaRosh)?

Then the scribes\n  and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they\n  had set her in the midst, they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman was\n  caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded\n  us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?” This they said,\n  testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him.\n  But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as\n  though He did not hear. So when they continued asking Him, He raised\n  Himself up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him\n  throw a stone at her first.” And again He stooped down and wrote on\n  the ground. Then those who heard it, being convicted by their\n  conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the\n  last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst.\n  When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said\n  to her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one\n  condemned you?” She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her,\n  “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>According to Christian tradition, this story would take place around 30-32 CE. Since Israel was under Roman empire, the Roman way of capital punishment was crucifixion, but I don't think they would crucify adulterous women. I also read from internet sources that stoning is never practiced these days. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Was stoning still practiced in Jerusalem around 30-32 CE?</li>\n<li>When was the last time in history that stoning was carried out by a Jewish court in accordance with Jewish law?</li>\n<li>Do Jewish sources discuss whether the Roman government would interfere in Jewish capital punishments, such as stoning?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 12)\n\n<h2>Was Stoning Still Officially Practiced?</h2>\n\n<p>As the previous answers have already said, no, it appears that stoning was abolished around the time of Jesus' birth.</p>\n\n<h2>Did It Still Happen Anyway?</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes, but the best attested case took place under special circumstances.</p>\n\n<p>The historian Josephus writes of an instance in which stonings occurred, probably around the year 62 CE.  The short version is as follows:  </p>\n\n<p>The Roman prefect of Judæa, a man named Porcius Festus, died in office.  This being the Ancient Roman Empire, it took a while for word of the death to reach the capital, and an equal amount of time for the new prefect, whose name was Albinus, to arrive in the region.  The high priest at the time was Ananus, or Hanan.  He had had problems with a few people in Jerusalem, including Jesus' brother, James.  Josephus tells us that Ananus now exploited the temporary power vacuum, and had the alleged troublemakers stoned to death.  The people of Jerusalem were outraged by this abuse of power, and immediately complained to Albinus, before he had even reached Judæa.</p>\n\n<p>Here is Josephus' account:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>CONCERNING ALBINUS UNDER WHOSE PROCURATORSHIP JAMES WAS SLAIN; AS ALSO WHAT EDIFICES WERE BUILT BY AGRIPPA.</p>\n  \n  <p>AND now Caesar, upon hearing the death of Festus, sent Albinus into Judea, as procurator. But the king deprived Joseph of the high priesthood, and bestowed the succession to that dignity on the son of Ananus, who was also himself called Ananus. Now the report goes that this eldest Ananus proved a most fortunate man; for he had five sons who had all performed the office of a high priest to God, and who had himself enjoyed that dignity a long time formerly, which had never happened to any other of our high priests. But this younger Ananus, who, as we have told you already, took the high priesthood, was a bold man in his temper, and very insolent; he was also of the sect of the Sadducees, who are very rigid in judging offenders, above all the rest of the Jews, as we have already observed; when, therefore, Ananus was of this disposition, he thought he had now a proper opportunity [to exercise his authority].  Festus was now dead, and Albinus was but upon the road; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges, and brought before them the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, whose name was James, and some others, and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law, he delivered them to be stoned: but as for those who seemed the most equitable of the citizens, and such as were the most uneasy at the breach of the laws, they disliked what was done; they also sent to the king [Agrippa], desiring him to send to Ananus that he should act so no more, for that what he had already done was not to be justified; nay, some of them went also to meet Albinus, as he was upon his journey from Alexandria, and informed him that it was not lawful for Ananus to assemble a sanhedrin without his consent.  Whereupon Albinus complied with what they said, and wrote in anger to Ananus, and threatened that he would bring him to punishment for what he had done; on which king Agrippa took the high priesthood from him, when he had ruled but three months, and made Jesus, the son of Damneus, high priest.<br>\n  - <a href=\"https://ia700401.us.archive.org/17/items/completeworksofj02jose/completeworksofj02jose.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Flavius Josephus, <em>Antiquities of the Jews</em>, Book XX, Chapter 9</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Josephus explicitly states that it was illegal for the high priest to assemble a Sanhedrin without the consent of the prefect.  If we assume that a stoning could not take place without the permission of a Sanhedrin, and if no Sanhedrin could be held without the consent of the prefect, it would appear that stonings could not take place without the approval, direct or indirect, of the Roman authorities. This agrees with the account provided by Josephus:  it is plainly the case that Ananus wasn't deposed simply because he stoned someone;  he was deposed because he stoned someone <strong>without the imprimatur of the Roman prefect</strong>.   This makes it fairly clear that, regardless of whether stoning was still officially condoned by the Jewish authorities, it was still legally possible, but only if the Roman prefect had already given his consent.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>This idea is further supported by the historical evidence:  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The right of exercising capital punishment autonomously, even over their own countrymen, was withdrawn from the Jews by the Romans in the first... century [of the Common Era]. The precise date is controversial, but the limits are clear. E. R. Goodenough notes that the Greeks in Cyrene were allowed by Augustus, in a decree of 6 B.C., full judicial rights in everything short of the death penalty - this was reserved to the Roman governor, according to the customary provincial administrative pattern. Many scholars therefore maintain, with widespread Roman precedent, that <strong>the Jews lost the right of inflicting capital punishment in A.D. 6, when Palestine became a Roman province. Others believe that Jewish courts were allowed exceptional privilege in this matter until the Jewish revolt was crushed and the Temple destroyed in A.D. 70.</strong>     </p>\n  \n  <p>There seems no good reason to doubt either the intense dislike which the Rabbis felt towards death sentences under any circumstances, or their sincere desire to minimize the physical sufferings involved. </p>\n  \n  <p>A man condemned to stoning was sometimes hurled over a precipice first, to abridge his suiferings. This was obviously the intention of the Nazarenes against Jesus in Luke 4: 29, whereas Stephen was judicially stoned on ground level in Acts 7. This certainly proves that such things happened under Roman rule by direct Jewish action - it neither proves not disproves their legality from a Roman viewpoint. <strong>John 8: 5 raises a question of principle, not of civic competence...</strong></p>\n  \n  <p><strong>It would follow historical precedents if the Jews lost the <em>ius gladii</em></strong> [literally, \"the right of the sword\", i.e., the legal right of a group of people to exercise capital punishment] <strong>in A.D. 6, when their land became a Roman province</strong>. Josephus describes the first Roman procurator Coponius as invested with the power of life and death by Caesar...  But <strong>Josephus nowhere lays claim to any such Jewish authority in this period - indeed he blames the High Priest Ananus for overstepping his prerogatives by ordering on his own authority the stoning of James the brother of Jesus [and others]</strong>.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The Jerusalem Talmud clearly states that Jews lost the power of capital punishment forty years before the destruction of the Herodian Temple, and the Babylonian Talmud echoes this<sup>1</sup>.  Forty could be a round number, translatable into sixty-four</strong>. Newman believes that the Great Sanhedrin left the Hall of Hewn Stones in the Temple about A.D. 30, for reasons internal to Judaism, and that <strong>this fact, not Roman interference, caused the cessation of the death penalty. Roman practice does support the simple, factual understanding of John 18: 31: \"We possess no civic power to impose a judicial death sentence at all.\"</strong> This was the interpretation of Schiirer, Mommsen, Bernard, Jeremias, Rosenblatt, and a host of other scholars.</p>\n  \n  <p>Others insist that the Romans permitted [Jews] to exercise the death penalty, against Jews only and in matters exclusively religious, until A.D. 70. Jean Juster argues this with immense learning, scant respect for Gospel historicity, and a propensity to read into Josephus what suits him - that the High Priest's προστασία [\"aegis\", \"auspices\"] includes <em>ius gladii</em> is gratuitous assumption. T. A. Burkill reaches the same conclusion from the Temple inscription in Greek, warning Gentiles not to proceed beyond their court on pain of death<sup>2</sup>. Deissmann, however, attributes both inscription and penal procedure to Roman authority, which would invalidate Burkill's argument entirely.  </p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The fact that many Jews were, like Stephen, judicially killed by their compatriots in many parts of the Roman Empire between A.D. 6 and 70 is not disputed</strong>. Goodenough demonstrates considerable laxity in the Alexandria of Philo, provided this <strong>lynch law was confined to Jews on religious charges who were not Roman citizens</strong>, and Origen reveals a similar situation much later.  </p>\n  \n  <p>Ulpian states that the power of Caesar's deputy may be either \"pure\" or \"mixed.\" The first includes the right of inflicting the death penalty, the second stops short of this. This is further clarified by another passage, which assigns capital jurisdiction to those who rule over entire provinces.  Ulpian makes it clear that with such rulers the power of death sentence is entirely personal, and under no circumstances transferable to another - yet responsible officials may not indiscriminately set at liberty accused men whose cases they cannot hear in person.</p>\n  \n  <p><strong>Allowing for abuses, it would seem that in her provinces Rome kept the <em>ius gladii</em> jealously within the hands of her appointed officials, regulating even their lawful use of it somewhat carefully. It seems almost inconceivable that the Sanhedrin alone could have executed [people] legally</strong>.<br>\n  -  <a href=\"http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/eq/1975-2_094.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Roy A.

It is written in Koine Greek, and reads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ΕΝΤΟΣ ΤΟΥ ΠΕΡΙ ΤΟ ΙΕΡΟΝ ΤΡΥΦΑΚΤΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΠΕΡΙΒΟΛΟΥ ΟΣ Δ ΑΝ ΛΗΦΘΗ ΕΑΥΤΩΙ ΑΙΤΙΟΣ ΕΣΤΑΙ ΔΙΑ ΤΟ ΕΞΑΚΟΛΟΥΘΕΙΝ ΘΑΝΑΤΟΝ</p>\n  \n  <p>\"No foreigner may enter within the balustrade around the sanctuary and the enclosure.

Capital punishment in any case had been made virtually impossible according Jewish law, which required that the two witnesses see each other, that the witnesses warn the perpetrator, etc. — all making it almost impossible that that Jews would have wanted to actually go through with an execution.  Under Roman rule, Jews themselves, without [the Roman prefect], without the Romans, would never have been permitted to carry on capital punishment of anybody.<br>\n  -  <a href=\"http://lawrenceschiffman.com/research/jesus/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Prof. Lawrence Schiffman, New York University</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As Stewart and Schiffman have shown, it seems almost certain that the Jews of Judæa lost the right to conduct executions around the turn of the century, and that the Sanhedrin had, around the same time, voluntarily surrendered their authority to conduct executions.  The only ways a person could be executed were to obtain the imprimatur of the Roman prefect (the legal method) or gather up a lynch mob and do it yourself (the illegal method). </p>\n\n<p>Obviously, the passage from John which you have quoted above falls under the second category<sup>1</sup>:  no authorities, whether Roman or Jewish, are involved in this sequence of events.  Rather, a mob is attempting to stone this woman of their own volition.  Obviously, this means that the question of legal authority to exercise capital punishment is irrelevant;  unruly mobs are, by definition, unconcerned with legal niceties.  As Stewart argues, it is widely agreed that such killings did take place, and the issue of legality is not relevant to the point.  It should go without saying that people have always killed one another, despite the widespread existence of laws prohibiting extrajudicial executions.</p>\n\n<h1>Your specific questions:</h1>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li>Was stoning still practiced in Jerusalem around 30-32 CE?</li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Probably not very often in Jerusalem itself, because the Romans had a significant presence in the city, and it was most likely illegal under Roman law by this point.  Outside of Jerusalem, in the countryside of Judæa and Galilee, where the Roman presence was negligible or nonexistent, stonings definitely still happened from time to time, but it was illegal under Roman law from some time around the first decade of the first century CE.  In most cases, these stonings were probably the work of mob justice, not a legitimate judicial process.  It is very difficult to ascertain with any certainty, primarily because of the dearth of historical records of events in the rural areas of the region.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"2\">\n  <li>When was the last time in history that stoning was carried out by a Jewish court in accordance with Jewish law?   </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It is difficult to say with any certainty.  Was the stoning of James carried out in accordance with Jewish law?  Maybe, but it was obviously illegal under Roman law.  If we can take at face value the claim that the Sanhedrin and other Jewish authorities surrendered the right to try capital offenses of their own volition, and that this policy was not reversed at a later date, then the stoning of James was illegal under Roman law <strong>and</strong> Jewish law.  </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol start=\"3\">\n  <li>Do Jewish sources discuss whether the Roman government would interfere in Jewish capital punishments, such as stoning?    </li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>As shown above, yes, the Romans absolutely interfered with the Jewish authorities' right to try capital offenses and conduct executions.  </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup>1</sup> <em>It isn't strictly in accordance with the intended scope of this site, so I will add this as a footnote:  Among critical scholars, it is widely accepted that the Gospel of John is entirely unreliable and inaccurate.  As such, the passage you have quoted is almost certainly a description of events that never took place.  John is quite clearly a fairly rabid anti-Semite, and this passage, like many others in his gospel, is at least partially motivated by a desire to demonize the Jews.  If you want an in depth explanation of why this is the case, it would probably be best to consult Biblical Hermeneutics.SE or a similar source for exegesis and historical criticism.</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 10)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0004_0_03929.html\">this article</a>, 40 years before the destruction of the Temple:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Instructive though this is, it is merely an academic discussion, the right of imposing capital punishment having been taken from the Sanhedrin by the Romans a century before, \"40 years before the Destruction of the Temple\" (Sanh. 41a; TJ, Sanh. 1:18a).

    "content": "# Why is it called \"safek berachos lehakel\" to make a more inclusive beracha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one is unsure which blessing a food gets, you make the more inclusive blessing, defaulting to the most inclusive she'hakol if nothing else is inclusive enough to cover all of your bases (Shulchan Aruch in several places, example O.C. 204:13).  This is called \"safek berachos lehakel\" (see Shulchan Aruch 168:13 glosses and many many many other places) which means we are lenient in blessings.  Why is it called being lenient to make the more inclusive blessing?  The implication is that were one to be stringent one would make the less inclusive blessing, even though it may not be the accurate blessing.  Why would the \"stringency\" be to make the least inclusive blessing?</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, several poskim (See Even Ha'Ozer about bean stalks in O.C. 204 and Ta\"z O.C. 202:13) assume the \"leniency\" is in light of the prohibition to make a blessing in vain, not because of the requirement to make a correct blessing (i.e. were the blessing in vain not applicable, one would not apply the rule of \"safek berachos lehakel\" in order to insure fulfilling the requirement to make a blessing).  Why do I not have an objective desire to make the most accurate blessing, and am willing to dispense of the surety of an accurate blessing in exchange for a more precise blessing which may not even be applicable to this food? I.e. you have a mystery fruit, could be ha'etz or adama, and you happen to have an apple. You make a ha'etz on the apple and do not make any blessing on the mystery fruit (that is basically the case of the Ta\"z). Since there is no concern of an in vain blessing to make the less inclusive blessing, you do so and then don't worry about the possibility of not having made the correct blessing on the mystery fruit.  Why am I not concerned for the accuracy of my blessing and what gives the other blessing preference?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <strong>ערוך השלחן</strong> in 202:12 writes the following:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>לכתחלה קבעו\n   עליהן ברכה מבוררת יותר מפני חשיבותן שכל\n   החשוב יותר ברכתו מבוררת יותר וליתן שבח\n   להקב״ה שברא דבר חשוב כזה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Roughly translated:\n[The Rabbis] established a more precise blessing on them because of their significance, as everything that is more significant has a more precise blessing <strong>to give praise to Hakadosh Baruch Hu that he created such a significant thing as this</strong>.</p>\n\n<p>According to the ערוך השלחן, a more specific blessing has the accomplishment of praising Hashem for a more significant or special creation.  By making the more specialized blessing we are being \"stringent\" on making sure to properly praise Hashem for the creation of this food.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, the hierarchy would be as follows:\n1. The prohibition of G-d's name in vain.  Avoid a blessing in vain - if there is doubt as to the validity of a blessing, do not say it.\n2. The praise that comes from the blessing.  Say as accurate a blessing as possible in order to express the maximum level of praise.  If one can justify saying a more precise, higher praise blessing by taking another food item which undoubtedly deserves that blessing, do so.\n3. Saying a correct blessing.  If there is a question as to which blessing is appropriate for this food, say the more inclusive one.  (This level would essentially always be covered by #1, but still exists as per the <a href=\"http://images.e-daf.com/DafImg.asp?ID=67&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Gemara</a> that prohibits enjoying this world without making a blessing)</p>\n\n<p>In a nutshell, ספק ברכות להקל would mean being lenient on the praise to Hashem that comes from the blessing due to the concern of the prohibition of taking G-d's name in vain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>רבינו יונה</strong> in his commentary to the רי\"ף in Berachos, 28b in the pages of the רי\"ף, in discussing why one makes a בורא פרי האדמה before a שהכל, says that the former is מעולה, higher level, because it is פרטית, specific.  It seems that the advantage of a more specific blessing is that itself - that it is more specific.  Perhaps this is similar to the requirement of רבי יהודה, because of ברוך ה' יום יום (See <a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=77&size=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Berachos 40a</a>) that we have a responsibility to give Hashem specific praise (as opposed to higher level praise).  This being the case, the \"stringency\" of making the accurate blessing is being stringent on the requirement to make a precise blessing.</p>\n\n<p>The ט\"ז himself actually makes this point very clearly, in <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9729&st=&pgnum=649\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 202 Sif Katan 4</a> - in discussing the blessing on jam and pulverized fruit, he explains that even though the Terumas Hadeshen says to make a Shehakol, one can a priori make a Ha'etz since (as he concludes) it is the \"main\" opinion, and <strong>יש לה מעלה על ברכת שהכל כיון שהיא ברכה מבוררת</strong> - it has an advantage over Shehakol since it is a more select blessing.</p>\n\n<p>(It should be noted that this is not a contradiction to the ט\"ז cited in the question, who said to bring a different fruit which is definitively Ha'etz, as opposed to here where he recommends to even make a Ha'etz on the food item in question itself, as in 202:13 he was discussing a situation in which there was one preferred opinion among many existing opinions, whereas in this case he is suggesting the possibility that there really is no conflicting opinion.)</p>\n\n<p>R' Sheinberg ZT\"L in <strong>משמרת חיים</strong> חלק א שאלה ח writes a similar thing, that the reason Chazal made a beracha of Ha'etz or Ha'adama is because of the need to make a specific blessing, i.e. that specificity is in itself a value.  (His idea is difficult, because he is using this approach to answer a question on the Mishna Berura, but the Be'ur Halacha writes explicitly in the <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=49624&st=&pgnum=205\" rel=\"nofollow\">beginning of Siman 202</a> that the blessing of Ha'etz is because of its חשיבות, significance, like the Aruch Hashulchan above.)</p>\n\n\n",

Should one dwell on such things or is מדה כנגד מדה a device that is used in understanding events of the past? i.e. if something happens to me (for the good or bad), is there any way of being certain that I will come to a correct conclusion?</p>\n\n<p>I know there is a concept of 'searching your deeds' (or חשבון הנפש) when something negative happens but is the point to come to a definite conclusion (i.e. 'this' caused 'this') or just general reflection leading to positive action?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=5&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">berachos 5a</a> discusses a person who has yesurin (suffering) and says he should investigate his actions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...אמר רבא ואיתימא רב חסדא אם רואה אדם שיסורין באין עליו יפשפש במעשיו</p>\n<p>...פשפש ולא מצא יתלה בביטול תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It says if he \"doesn't find anything\" he should assume it is because of bittul Torah.  Rashi on \"doesn't find anything\" says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא מצא עבירה בידו שבשבילה ראוין יסורין הללו לבא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"he doesn't find any sin for which <em>this</em> (emphasis mine) suffering should have come.\"  The gemara indicates that the proper response to suffering is introspection into ones actions, and, evidently, one can figure out what sins he did to cause a certain suffering.</p>\n<p>There is a famous story (famous because I have heard it) about R' Isar Zalman Meltzer that goes as follows:\nA man came to visit R' Meltzer.  While they were talking, a noise came from the kitchen and R' Meltzer's wife cried out.  He ran into the kitchen, there was some quiet discussion, and then they both left the house, leaving this man waiting.  When he came back, he said \"where were we\" but the man asked for an explanation of what had happened.  R' Meltzer told him that a pot of milk in the kitchen had boiled over and spilled. He and his wife had a discussion to figure out why such a thing would happen, and then she realized that they had not paid the milkman.  They ran out to find the milkman, and when they paid him, he informed them that he had not known how he was going to buy food for dinner that night.</p>\n<p>It doesn't always work out that smoothly, but at least R' Isar Zalman Meltzer felt it was worthwhile to try to figure it out.</p>\n\n\n",

The sages added boundaries and stringencies but the source is from the Torah. </p>\n\n<p>There are explanations given behind Kashrut, although the Torah does not explain them, nor are they dependent on the explanations.</p>\n\n<p>For one explanation, Rabbi S. R. Hirsch, in Horeb (Chukim ch. 68 paragraph 464) says that the laws of Kashrut are because \"you are what you eat,\" i.e. imbibing something symbolizes and in a certain respect creates an internalization of that thing.  Therefore, vicious animals are prohibited to ingest because it internalizes viciousness.  Rather, kosher animals are gentle - split hooves cannot be used as predatory, and chewing cud gives a certain nature of contentment with very little.  Similar ideas are explained for all the types of non-Kosher (fish, creepy crawly things, etc.).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Torah definitely talks about Kashrus. The Torah tells us which animals, fowl, fish are permitted and forbidden. Not to mix meat and dairy. Not to eat any bugs. There are additional Rabbinic prohibitions that were added for assorted reasons. For example Yayin Nesech, Bishul Yisrael, etc. The Torah does not give reasons for these prohibitions, however some of the earlier commentaries do attempt to explain why some things were forbidden. However all the Rabbinic add ons are clearly explained.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First, a big YES to YEZ's answer!  All I can do is supplement it with additional info...</p>\n\n<p>1) The only open reason given in the Bible for keeping kosher is to be holy, just as G-d is Holy (Lev. 11:44. See also 11:45, 20:25-26, Ex. 22:30, Deut. 14:1-4)  The final citation adds that since you're Chosen to be My children, be holy & don't eat these things. MESSAGE: \"If you want a relationship with Me, we need to have Holiness in common, so be holy. This includes not ingesting foods I consider unholy.\"</p>\n\n<p>2) Besides Leviticus 11, the main kosher lists are repeated with a few new details in Deuteronomy 14.</p>\n\n<p>3) The Rabbis had additional traditions as to which animals and birds were not kosher. For example, any bird with an additional talon is considered a bird of prey & thereby non-kosher. Also, any animals that trample other animals (not in self-defense) are automatically non-kosher.</p>\n\n<p>4) If the idea of kosher was to battle trichinosis, more cooking would suffice. Still, this would only explain one of hundreds of kosher laws.</p>\n\n<p>5) Many, many other kosher laws are listed individually throughout the Torah. For example, not to eat animals that died of their own accord (Deut. 14:21), not to eat animals that had been killed by other animals (Exodus 22:30), to slaughter animals by a pre-determined method (Deut. 12:21), to remove the lifeblood & not consume it (Lev. 17:10-14) - which we do by soaking & salting, not to eat meat cooked with milk (Ex. 23:19 & 34:26, Deut. 14:21), not to cook in non-kosher utensils until they're kosherized (Numbers 31:23), Kosher for Passover (Ex. 12:20), etc.</p>\n\n<p>6) There are other kosher laws of which you may be unaware, but which must be considered by Kashruth organizations such as OU, OK, Kof-K, Star-K & CRC in their supervisory capacity. For example, not to eat produce of Israel until it's been properly tithed, not to eat the first 3 years of fruits a tree or vine produces (Lev. 19:23-25), not to graft different fruits or animals together, not to eat the new year's produce until after the first day of Passover has passed, etc.</p>\n\n<p>(If you have any interest in kosherizing your home, or make a move towards greater kosher awareness, call your local Chabad or Orthodox Rabbi. Almost all will be glad to help & guide!)</p>\n\n\n",

She doesn't practice, and she says she is not a believer. We are French and live in Paris. This may or may not be useful information, but at least, it will explain why my English might not be very colloquial.</p>\n\n<p>We plan to have a single baby (for several reasons). If we have a boy, she wants for him to be circumcised when he is 8 days old. As a humanist, I strongly believe that any irreversible body alteration done without medical necessity and without consent is just wrong. I oppose the circumcision at this age and asks that he is allowed to decide for himself when he can consent.</p>\n\n<p>I <em>might</em> give in, and let it happen, but only if not doing it would cause very serious bad consequences for my son. I have researched the Internet (both English- and French-language), and my understanding so far is that postponing the circumcision, while understandably shocking to my wife, would <em>not</em> have dire consequences for my son. That he would still be Jewish. That he would still be welcome in the community, at least later in his life, when he decides to get circumcised by himself. So my question is: is my understanding correct?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>On a very practical level:</p>\n\n<p>Infant circumcision by a competent mohel is minimally painful and soon forgotten. The medical clamp procedure is more painful, but equally forgotten. No lasting effects on the literally millions that have had it. It is not a zero risk procedure, but having the baby driven around in a car is going to represent greater risk in life.</p>\n\n<p>Adult circumcision is fraught with many more complications, anesthetic which complicates things, much more pain that is long remembered, possibly including full anesthetic which is downright dangerous - much more so than the side effects of infant circumcision.</p>\n\n<p>On a Jewish religious level, Judaism believes in repentance. As such, it can be \"made up\" later. However, that assumes he gets there and decides that then. It is a big impediment later, especially for someone who has a more casual relationship with his Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>Your wife isn't particularly religious (obviously) but has a basic Jewish identity which is important to her, and she is very concerned that this will be a hurdle to establishing that later.</p>\n\n<p>There is one other point: If he is circumcised as an infant, he will grow up and ask why. When he gets an answer, he will see that a Jewish identity was important to his mother. If he isn't, and learns about his mother's Jewish identity, he will get the message that it really wasn't that important.

He just has to know all of the laws, which is possible without being titled \"Rabbi.\"  However, as a general rule, today those who would qualify as having the prerequisite knowledge are Rabbis.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>In a nutshell: in U.S. state laws, a couple is \"married\" by a clergyman. (Alternatively, they could go to a justice of the peace or the like.) The laws vary from state to state as to what's called a clergyman; for instance, in New York City the congregation would sign a letter stating that he is \"a pastor or associate pastor.\"</p>\n\n<p>From the perspective of Jewish law (Orthodox), the marriage happens when he gives her something valuable that he owns (usually a ring) in front of two \"kosher\" witnesses. The witnesses need to be Orthodox-observant men, so often at a wedding with few Orthodox attendees, the rabbi is also one of the witnesses. </p>\n\n<p>About a thousand years ago people were making all sorts of mistakes regarding weddings (e.g. using a borrowed ring, or related witnesses), so a policy was enacted to have a local rabbi present -- just to make sure everything is being done by the book. Thus the practice today to have an Orthodox rabbi \"officiating\" -- just making sure everything is done correctly. If a couple got it all right and no formal rabbi was there, the wedding would still be valid. (Though from a US state perspective, they'd have to go to a judge -- or a formal rabbi -- to sign their papers afterwards.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I've attended many Orthodox weddings where, though rabbis may or may not have been present, they did not conduct the service.</p>\n\n<p>I've personally never heard of a wedding requiring anything but any one of the following with two kosher witnesses present:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>exchange of an article of estimable monetary worth</li>\n<li>exchange of a contract</li>\n<li>some time alone for the bride and groom</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In a Jewish context, the officiant doesn't \"marry\" the bride and groom - the groom \"buys\" the bride and the bride accepts.  Two witnesses also sign a document stating that they saw it happen.  Then the bride and groom go off to the yichud room to spend some time alone -- their aloneness witnessed, usually, by two different witnesses.</p>\n\n\n",

It proceeds to list seven different Northern Kings.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi explains that the Kings of Judah aren't mentioned, because they were in the days of the Kings of Israel and are considered like one court.</p>\n\n<p>I examined <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et09a01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Kings</a> and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25a01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Chronicles</a>, and it seems that up until Hezekiah, when Assyria exiled the Northern Kingdom, there were 7 rulers of Judah whose reigns could have contained idol worship: <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25b12.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rehoboam</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et09a15.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Abijam</a>, Jehoram and Ahaziah (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et09b08.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">v.16 & 25</a>), <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et09b11.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Athalia</a> (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25b22.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">v.3</a>), Jehoash (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25b24.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">v.17</a>), and <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25b28.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ahaz</a>. The numbers work out <em>pretty</em><sup>1</sup> well, but the Kingdom of Judah wasn't destroyed by Assyria. In fact, one of our most righteous kings, Hezekiah <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et09b18.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">was in power</a> during and after the last King of Israel's reign, and the Kingdom of Judah itself wasn't destroyed for over a century<sup>2</sup>!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, the <a href=\"http://www.brill.com/aggadat-bereshit\" rel=\"nofollow\">Midrash Aggadath Breishith</a> says <a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=26872&st=&pgnum=148&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow\">in ch.48</a> that there were 7 wicked kings in Judah: Jehoram, Ahaz, Joash, Menashe, Ammon, Jehoiakim, and Zedekiah. This completely contradicts my reasoning above, and further complicates Rashi, because <em>four</em> of the seven wicked kings of Judah reign <em>after</em> the Assyrian exile!</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why does Rashi include the Kings of Judah in the Talmud's saying?</strong> </p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><sup> <strong>1.</strong> Amaziah was rebelled against by the people when he turned to idols (<a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25b25.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">v.27</a>), so I didn't count him, as he may not have been able to establish a court. Alternatively, you could count Amaziah but exclude Athalia, who may have had the same court as her grandson Ahaziah, as she pushed him toward idolatry in the first place (see citation above). I counted Abijam as separate from Rehoboam his father, because he <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et25b13.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">seems to have</a> a period of righteousness in his reign (see also Seder Olam Rabba 16: Rhoboam <em>and his sons</em> were righteous for 3 years, rebelling on the fourth). Athalia used Ahazia's reign to seize power for herself, so I assumed she made her own court too, and I separated Jehoram and Ahazia.</sup></p>\n\n<p><sup><strong>2.</strong> Based on <em>Kings II</em>. Hezekiah's rule began in the 3rd year of Hoseah's. Hoseah reigned for 9 years total, So of Hezekiah's 29 years, 23 of them were after the exile of Samaria. Menasseh- 55 yrs. Ammon - 2 yrs. Josiah - 31 yrs. Jehoahaz - 3 mnths. Jehoiakim - 11 years. Jehoiachin - 3 mnths. Zedekiah - 11 yrs. Gedaliah - less than 2 mnths. 23+55+2+31+11+11+JJ&G= roughly 133.</sup></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hosea's removing the roadblocks to Jerusalem made more of an accusation against Northerners still clinging to idolatry and sacrificing to it rather than bringing sacrifice to the Temple.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/e/et/et3005.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">chapter 5</a> of Canticles, Rashi interprets verse 3 as us giving up and resigning ourselves to our ways of evil, despite Gd's so to speak heartfelt pleas for us to open up the doors of our hearts to him. We gave up on ourselves and our our love with our Beloved.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi then explains verses 4-6. He says that Gd finally began to punish Judah in the times of Ahaz. We at long last repented during the generation of Hezekiah, (and to an extent under Josiah), but He did not rescinde His decree against us (Rashi says even Jeremiah's encouraging words merely sought to lessen the inevitable punishment of our exile). The Nebuchadnezar came and destroyed the Temple.</p>\n\n<p>Rashi's explanation here makes it quite clear that the decree against Judah occurred, in his view, during the reign of Ahaz and his contemporary, Hosea son of Elah, last king of Israel.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Thus Rashi's explanation of the Talmud is consistent with his opinion of when Judah's hope was lost and its fate sealed</strong>, even though the destruction proper did not come upon Judah as abruptly as it did upon Samaria. </p>\n\n<p>As far as the number of kings goes, one could potentially count around seven, as I did in my question, however I am inclined to follow the midrash, instead of my own mind, and say that Rashi was wondering why three of the seven, Jehoram, Joash, and Ahaz weren't mentioned alongside the Northern Kings.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone know a source for this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This idea does indeed come from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomo_Kluger\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Shlomo Kluger</a>. The explanation is that Rachel being buried separately was a punishment for disgracing her relationship with Yaakov by selling her marital rights to Leah for the <em>dudaim</em> that Reuven had gathered. However, since that disgrace was just for one night, her punishment of being buried separately was also only for one night, after which she was transferred to <em>Me'aras Hamachpelah</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Chochmas HaTorah, Vayishlach p. 571</strong></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>היא מצבת קבורת רחל עד היום. יש לדייק על אמרו היא מצבת קבורת רחל מה ענין הקבורה לכאן והוי ליה לומר היא מצבת רחל עד היום אך נראה הכונה דהנה מה שלא נקברה רחל עמו הוי מטעם שאמרו חז\"ל ב\"ר כיון שביזתה שכיבתו של צדיק שאמרה לכן ישכב עמך הלילה דעמך הוא דמיך עמי לית הוא דמיך יע\"ש ולפי זה כיון דאמרה לכן ישכב עמך הלילה א\"כ לא ביזתה שכבו רק לילה אחת לכך נענשה מדה כנגד מדה שלילה אחת לא תהיה נקברת במערת המכפלה אבל אח\"כ נקברה במערת המכפלה ומי קבר את משה הוא ית' לבדו כן י\"ל גבי רחל דתחילת הקבורה נקברה ע\"י יעקב שם בבית לחם אבל אח\"כ נטלוהו מלאכי השרת וקברוה במערת המכפלה או אחר מיתת יעקב אז לילה אחת אחר שנקבר יעקב הובאה גם רחל ונקברה שם ולפ\"ז העד היום לא הוי המצבה לציון על רחל ממש רק על הקבר שהקבר הוא משל רחל אך אין רחל עצמה שם וז\"ש ויצב יעקב מצבת אבן על קבורתה היא מצבת קבורת רחל שאינו מצבת רחל עד היום הזה רק מצבת קבורת רחל דהקבר ישנו שם עד היום הזה אבל אין רחל שם עד היום הזה         </p>\n  \n  <p>\"It is the monument of the burial of Rachel until today.\" We can analyze the statement, \"it is the monument of the burial of Rachel\" —  what does burial have to do with anything here? It should have said \"it is the monument of Rachel until today\". </p>\n  \n  <p>But it appears that the intent is that the fact that Rachel was not buried with him was for the reason the sages said in Bereishis Rabbah, that she disgraced the lying of the righteous man for she said \"therefore he will lie with you tonight\" — with you he will lie in the grave but with me he will not lie in the grave.</p>\n  \n  <p>And according to this, since she said \"therefore he will lie with you tonight\" she therefore only disgraced his lying for one night. Therefore she was punished measure for measure that for one night she would not be buried in <em>Me'aras Hamachpelah</em>, but afterwards she was buried in <em>Me'aras Hamachpelah</em>. And who buried Moshe? God alone. So too we can say regarding Rachel that the beginning of her burial was done by Yaakov there in Bethlehem, but afterwards the ministering angels took her and buried her in <em>Me'aras Hamachpelah</em>. Or after the death of Yaakov then one night after Yaakov was buried Rachel was also brought and buried there. </p>\n  \n  <p>According to this, the \"until today\" is not a monument that is a reference to Rachel in actuality; it is just on the grave, because the grave was from Rachel, but Rachel herself is not there. And that which it says \"and Yaakov erected a monument of stone on her grave\", it is a monument to the burial of Rachel since the monument to Rachel until today is only a monument to the burial of Rachel as the grave is still there until today, but Rachel is not there until today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was Yosef sold at age seventeen?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>While the start of <em>Vayeshev</em> (the start of <a href=\"http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0137.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Genesis 37</a>) sounds as though the events all take place at one time, so that <em>Yosef</em> was sold (verse 28) at age seventeen (as mentioned in verse 2), it's not clear in that regard, and certainly can be read otherwise. Indeed, arguably it's less reasonable to read the verses that way, since quite a bit is mentioned in the passage: the relaying of gossip, the making of a shirt, the first dream, the second, the brothers' travel, and <em>Yosef</em>'s.</p>\n\n<p>I do know that the <em>g'mara</em> (<a href=\"http://e-daf.com/index.asp?ID=1445\" rel=\"nofollow\"><em>M'gila</em> 17</a>) says he was sold at age seventeen, but commentators on <em>Tanach</em> often explain it differently from the way <em>Chazal</em> do.</p>\n\n<p>Are there any Jewish commentaries that claim <em>Yosef</em> was sold at an age other than seventeen? What commentary, what age, and what (if any) reason does it give for saying so?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Actually, it's harder to understand how yosef was <em>already</em> seventeen when he was sold:</p>\n<p>After Yosef was sold, we are told (B'reishis 38) that Yehuda proceeded to get married, and have three sons,from separate pregnancies (as is evident in Pessukim 3-5, where the word ותהר is used before the birth of each kid). Since pregnancy takes 6-9 months, at least 18 months have passed by the time Shela is born (and more likely closer to 27. This is all assuming there was <em>no break</em> between each kid being born).</p>\n<p>We further know that Er and Onan both married Tamar, and at least Onan died because he refused to impregnate her (Pessukim 6-10), and Tamar waited until Shela was old enough for marriage before tricking Yehuda (Passuk 14). This presumably means when Shela was 13 years old, but I'll be as conservative as possible and follow the Gemara's opinion that a man can have a kid by age nine (for example Berachot 24a, and Rashi there. But this is also seen many times throughout Shas), which brings our total to <em>at least</em> 10.5 years.</p>\n<p>Tamar then tricks Yehuda, and gets pregnant, and gives birth to twins: Peretz and Zerach (Pessukim 14-30). This is another 6 months at the very least, bringing us to 11 years after Yosef's sale.</p>\n<p>Later, (46:12) we are told that Peretz had two sons by the time Bnei Yisrael went to Egypt. Even assuming they were twins, and were born after six months, and Peretz got married and impregnated his wife at 9 years old, and they were born just as they left for Egypt, that still adds 9.5 years, bringing our total to 20.5 years.</p>\n<p>So, by this math, Yosef had to be <em>at least</em> 37.5 years old by the time Bnei Yisrael joined him in Egypt (even assuming he was 17 at the time he was sold).</p>\n<p>Coming from the other side, Yosef was 30 when he became second-in-command (41:46), after which followed 7 years of plenty, and two years of famine before Yosef revealed himself to his brothers (45:11) and sends them to get Yaakov. Even if it takes Yaakov a year from then to get to Egypt, Yosef was at most 40 years old when Bnei Yisrael joined him (more likely 39, if we only count 2 years, as the Passuk implies, and as the midrash states).</p>\n<p><strong>So in essence</strong>, our most generous math only gives us a 2.5 year (and seemingly only a 1.5 year) gap during which we could claim the story with the dreams happened, before Yosef was sold. Therefore I would say it's unlikely, and almost absurd to claim that Yosef was over 17 when the dreams happened (especially since the 'extra' 1.5-2.5 years are needed to alleviate some of the most problematic liberties I took in shortening the years of Yehuda's family tree, as noted above and below), and it's extremely unlikely that any commentary would do so.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As mentioned above, this all works only if we assume that all marriages were at 9, not minimum thirteen [which would add at least 8 years - Shela's theoretical marriage age and Peretz's], and that all babies were born without breaks, starting at the marriage, and pregnancies lasted 6 months [if they were 9 months each, that would add over a year, for 5 births; if they weren't consecutive, that could add years], and that Peretz's kids were twins [otherwise we add at least half a year].</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is one allowed to light a candle which has oil on top and water underneath on Erev Shabbos?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=47b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 47b</a> says that even on Erev Shabbos one may not place a vessel with water in it under a candle in order that any sparks emitted by the flame should fall into the water, because it is a form of extinguishing a fire. Yet many homes put water underneath the oil in their Shabbos candles, using either fixed wicks as in the picture below or floating wicks, even though we see that when the oil is nearly finished the flame sputters and goes out, and so clearly the water is extinguishing the flame. Why is this permitted?</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xyafl.jpg\" alt=\"A glass, mostly filled with water, with some oil floating on top.

From what I understand the Gemara is talking about placing a bowl of water under the candle where it would be prohibited even from Erev Shabbos, however oil with water in a glass is no issue.</p>\n\n<p>Orach Chaim 265:4 says that so long one has no intention that it is being done to extinguish the flame sooner it is permitted. The Rama cites authorities who allow adding water even if it is being done with the intention of having the fire extinguish sooner, since it is being done  indirectly. <a href=\"http://www.dailyhalacha.com/m/halacha.aspx?id=2402\">From DailyHalacha.com</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This issue is discussed at length in Maseches Beitzah (22a, see Tos. s.v. hamistapek and the Rosh there).  The bottom line is that if the water is there before Shabbos, it is not a problem, and the case of the bowl of water (of the gemara you referenced) is where the bowl was placed next to the candle to catch the sparks so that they not cause burns, and Chazal were worried you would lift the bowl up to catch the sparks faster which would be causing extinguishing on Shabbos itself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Tosfos on the quoted gemara addresses this question, and explains that the difference is in the person's intention:</p>\n\n<p>In the case of the gemara the person's intention is that the sparks from the flame be extinguished, and therefore Chazal prohibited the action even on Erev Shabbos as a safeguard against actively extinguishing the sparks with water on Shabbos since this is in line with his intention. But in the case of placing water underneath the oil the person's intention is to raise up the level of the oil, and therefore there is no reason to disallow it on Erev Shabbos as a safeguard against extinguishing on Shabbos, since this is not the person's intention.</p>\n\n\n",

Once Israel saw them with standards they began to desire standards. They said 'if only we be made into standards like them... Gd  said to them 'How you desire to make standards! By your lives that I will fulfill your request, as it says (Psalms 20) 'Gd will fulfill all of your requests...' Immediately Gd told them to Israel and said to Moses 'Go.

Gd said to Moses 'Make them standard in My Name, insomuch as they are my children', as it says (Deuteronomy 14) 'You are children of Hashem your Gd...', 'and they are my legions', as it says (Exodus 7) 'And I shall bring forth My Legions, My nation the children of Israel, from the land of Egypt', and so it says 'The standard of the camp of Judah to the south of their legions', 'And since they are My legions I will make them in to standards for My name'.</sup></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So Gd commanded that the standards be made, and even told Israel what they were in 2:3, מיד הודיע הקב\"ה אותם לישראל‏ <em>Immediately G-d told them to Israel</em>, seems like he's telling them their standards.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14129&st=&pgnum=89&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rabbeinu Becahya says</strong></a> that their banners were based on the Heavenly Banners that they saw at Sinai, which appeared as flames of varying shapes and colors. He also describes the layout and organization of the Tribes as being based on the 'Upper Tribes' of the Shehina. The Camp of Judah, of which Issachar and Zebulun were a part, Represented the Camp of Gabriel on high, which consisted of Gabriel Azrael and Shemayel , and also the face of the lion on the <em>Merkabah</em> chariot. So we see that they weren't making up these signs on their own, and they had a profound significance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>So it seems that</strong> since the banners were made at Gd's behest, and they represented real parallels between the Upper and Lower Camps (not just the human imagination) they  superseded the general rule.

It seems to be very straightforward - for a regular palace, a king would only move in after the house was properly lit up and perfumed.  It has nothing to do with whether or not we see Hashem being <strong>unable</strong> to dwell there beforehand.  That which you said from Chizkuni, that </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"...In the mishkan too, <strong>G-d could not, so to speak, dwell there until there</strong> was perfume and light.\n  Therefore these materials were <strong>essential</strong> to the construction of the mishkan. <strong>Without them G-d could not have, so to speak, dwelt there.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>is your personal interpretation, as well as the basis for your issue that this idea is not mentioned elsewhere. Chizkuni actually says:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שמן למאר – כל עניני הפרשה מתקוני הבנין <strong>שאין דרך למלך לבא אל ביתו עד שיתקנו בו אורה</strong>, ומאותו שמן עצמו יקחו לצורך המשחה לקדש בו כל הבנין.\n  בשמים – בלולים בשמן המשחה. <strong>דרך מלכים לבשם להם הבית קודם שיכנסו בו</strong>.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Maybe it would help to recast the Chizkuni's analogy in contemporary terms:</p>\n\n<p>Suppose a flesh-and-blood man who lives like a king (as we all B\"H do nowadays, compared to people in the Dark Ages the Chizkuni lived in) buys a house. Would he consider the house ready to move into if the electricity, water, and heat are not turned on? No. Even though every single piece of fixed infrastructure is there, without ready flows of these essential consumables, the house is not a habitable structure yet (for spoiled 21st-century people, at least).</p>\n\n<p>Maybe more to the point, if you built a house for, say, your parents, as an expression of respect and desire for them to live near you, would you invite them to move in before the utilities are turned on? No. Beside the practical problems, this would feel neither respectful nor a sincere expression of wanting them to be close.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, if we consider light and perfume to be necessary elements of high-class living, we wouldn't present a house as a representation of our desire to be close to God's Presence (as it were) without them in place.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemora  in Bovo Kama 22a says: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ul>\n  <li>אשו משום חציו<br>\n  The damages from his fire is liable under the category of his arrows thrown/launched which are human inflicted damages,</li>\n  </ul>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rashi explains </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>משום חציו. חייבו הכתוב לאיהו קעביד דהוי כזורק חץ - The passuk makes liable one who started the fire as if he threw arrows.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So we see the liability of making a fire is due because of Directly incurring damage (he should know the fire would go out of control) as if he aimed an arrow and launched it at the article/being. </p>\n\n<p>Here as well a golem or ox is like a fire because he formed it without controlling it just like a fire. </p>\n\n<p>He would therefore be chayav(liable) for all 5 things with regards to nizkei adam(i.e if a person was inflicted by the golem/ox): nezek (loss of a limb) tzaar(pain) ripui(healing) sheves(work loss incapacitation) and boshes(embarrassment). </p>\n\n<p>He would also be Chayav Nezek shaleim (Full damage value)if this golem/ox would inflict damage on an animal or article(tzaar ripui sheves and boshes doesn't apply to animals).</p>\n\n<p>A normal ox however, the Gemoro Kesubos 41a-b concludes is Becheskas shimur -guarding itself (i.e a calm temperament). This is because it was born through the natural sequence of events which Hashem runs the world with, and though it is in the ownership of a man who should have responsibility and therefore Chayav Chatzi Nezek (see kesubos 41a), the ox is NOT \"manmade\" like a fire or golem/ox which he contrived from scratch. Therefore he is not chayav the 4 damages of Tzaar, Ripui, Sheves and Boshes</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The L'Horos Nassan 11:11:6 actually addresses this question . He answers with regards to an animal created from sefer yetzira that from the Rambam Nizekei Mamon 10:2 that animals that kill get stoned.  Rav Gestetner explains that maybe thos applies to regular animals that are born normally ,but not to abnormal creations. However, he notes that although one might not find a reason to kill the animal based off shor haniskal, one can still find the animal guilty of stoning based off the idea of \"getting rid of the bad amongst your midst\" which applies to anything that causes damage.(this seems to fit with what the Ravaad says). </p>\n\n<p>However ,the Rav Hamagid writes that according to the Rambam the word ובערת is not written only with regards to a man not an animal. So it seems that this creation may not be guilty of stoning . </p>\n\n<p>He writes at end of whole teshuva that this needs further investigation ,and only brings these answers to make one aware of the tzadim.</p>\n\n<p>[This teshuva has many ideas about things created from sefer yetzira, so if you ever wondered about it ,he probably discusses it.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The laws of damage are not restricted to an ox. The gemara in bava Kama extends them to several other animals explicitly and to all animals (and objects) based on certain commonalities, such as intention to harm or normalcy to harm. (Unlike the laws of kashrus which may depend on the biological source or nature of an animal.) So if this sefer yetzira ox has the temperament of all other oxen, it would be the same. And if not, it would change according to those rules.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Custom of Rov speaking before Krias HaTorah on Shabbos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been in a number of shuls where the Rov of the shul will get up before Krias HaTorah on Shabbos and say some sort of \"drasha\". Sometimes it was connected to the parsha or inyunei d'yoma (i.e. before a yom tov, etc.) Or sometimes to \"strengthen\" the kehillah with words of \"chizzuk\" or mussar.</p>\n\n<p>Where does this come from that the Rov should speak at this time? Perhaps it was only because of convenience that usually everyone was together and also it's not disrupting a particular part of the tefillah.</p>\n\n<p>Many often find this bothersome that they are being forced to listen to a drasha at such a time and rather not make the tefillah any longer than it already is.</p>\n\n<p>I'm asking to see if there is any source for this \"minhag\" in earlier seforim or sources.</p>\n\n<p>An additional point, I once heard that it says one shouldn't speak before Krias HaTorah as it's not kavod for the Torah to speak (even Divrei Torah) right before the Torah itself is supposed to be read from. Is there a makor to this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=1&daf=28b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">says</a> that Rav Yosef would give a Drasha before Musaf on Shabbos. Apparently when people weren't eating, or weren't eating much anyway. From Rashi it sounds like they would finish Shachris and Krias HaTorah, go to the Beis Medrash to hear the drasha, and then go to the Beis HaKenesses to daven Musaf.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding saying the Drasha after Krias HaTorah rather than before, there is a letter from the Lubavitcher Rebbe to that effect. I'm not sure where to find it, though. However, shortly after the Lubavitcher Rebbe passed away they started saying a Drasha in 770 (his shul) before Krias HaTorah, and then publicly corrected it to do it after when the letter was pointed out, so I'm confident it exists.</p>\n\n<p>(Regarding what to do about the kaddish before Musaf, the practice on Rosh Chodesh is to say a chapter of Tehilim first, because of the interruption of removing Tefillin - especially those that put on Rabbeinu Tam Tefillin at that time. It may be a good idea to do that in the case of a Drasha after Krias HaTorah as well, but it is not clear that the situation is exactly the same).</p>\n\n<p>However there are those, especially those who strictly follow the Mishna Brurah, who argue to specifically not interrupt between Ashrei and the Kaddish before Musaf.</p>\n\n<p>So the bottom line is that there is no perfect place for a Drasha according to all opinions that will still keep the crowd, but today's reality is that this is likely the only opportunity to make one in many Shuls, and that is taking precedence.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A possible answer to this question is that the Drasha does not present itself as a hefsek during Tefilla.  Recall that the various Megillot (Shir HaShirim, Ruth and Kohelet) are read prior to Kriat HaTorah.</p>\n\n<p>In many shuls, the Drasha is said after the Sefer Torah is returned to the ark, just prior to Mussaf.  The issue with that arrangement is that the Kaddish right before Mussaf therefore has no basis, since the Ashrei, Mizmor LeDavid and concluding pesukim U'Vnocho Yomar were said prior to the Drasha.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>So then, the most acceptable place to do have the Drasha, and we do this a few times is to say it immediately after the Haftorah on every Shabbos and Yom Tov, before the Sefer Torah(s) are returned.  In fact we do it when it's Yizkor or Tekiat Shofar (since there can not be a hefsek once the Tekiahs have started.)  </p>\n\n<p>The only problem is that the Sifrei Torahs have to be lying flat and covered with a Tallis during the Drasha and not being held by the Maghbia on the bench.</p>\n\n\n",

It mentions that a Catholic charity has \"helped Jewish parents adopt a baby, too\" but I don't know if this is meant to limit donations to that one particular, unnamed charity or to say that all Catholic charities are acceptable.</p>\n\n<p>As I walked out of the store today, there was a table manned by representatives of the \"Mission Life\" church. That might not actually be the name but it was something like that. Their sign said that donations would help save a child's life but I don't know the scope of that -- are they saving his soul through Christian education? Are they providing actual medical help? But if I don't donate, would that appear as a chilul hashem as I am ignoring people in need?</p>\n\n<p>What about donating my clothes to the Salvation Army -- their name makes clear one of the aspects of their charity, \"Salvation.\" And if Santa is standing outside the store in mid-December, am I allowed to donate even though he is collecting money which might be used for something akin to missionizing?</p>\n\n<p>In short: <strong>Is it at all acceptable to donate to a Christian charity if I don't know whether or not the money will go towards missionizing and the like?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I can't speak for Jewish law, but even without religious concerns, I would recommend that you spend your money wisely in terms of giving to charity.  I wasn't able to find any information about a charity called \"Mission Life\", but the name alone is probably grounds for concern.  </p>\n\n<p>There are a large number of Christian charities that genuinely do help people around the world, but the vast majority of them also do missionary work.  While it is obviously a commendable thing to provide education to children in undeveloped countries, and a lot of the education is very useful (teaching kids to read and write, do mathematics, etc), there is usually a religious aspect to the schools, including proselytism and evangelical agendas.</p>\n\n<p>The site <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"Charity Navigator\"</a> is an invaluable resource for finding out exactly what your donations will be spent on.  It also provides some insight into the motivation, and possible religious agenda, of each of the charities listed.  The site rates the charities based on how many cents of each dollar donated actually benefits the people who need it.  It tells you how much, if anything, the CEOs and other administrative personnel are paid, and who controls the spending and relief work.  </p>\n\n<p>There are some absolutely fantastic charities that have no ulterior motives, no religious agenda, and a total commitment to helping the people who need it while taking little or nothing for themselves.</p>\n\n<p>My personal favorite charities are <a href=\"http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=12548#.VdfrHUr3arU\" rel=\"nofollow\">Water</a>, which is devoted to providing clean, sanitary drinking water to people who otherwise wouldn't have access to it, and the participants in the <a href=\"http://www.microcreditsummit.org/commitment-makers.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Microcredit Summit Campaign</a>.  The philosophy behind the Microcredit Summit Campaign is based on solid research.  Basically, the idea is to provide small loans to women in underdeveloped countries.  The loan is spent on setting up a small business, and the recipient of the loan eventually pays it back (without interest).  The loan payment is not returned to the donor, but is instead put back into the system;  every time a loan is repaid, it funds the next loan.  </p>\n\n<p>In this way, the focus is shifted from giving a handout to giving an opportunity for the recipient to support themselves in the future.  Not only is the recipient enabled to help themselves, but they actually get the opportunity to help other needy people.  As a result, each donation turns into an endless cycle of loans, and the charity expands with every new recipient, and a minimum amount of input of donations.  </p>\n\n<p>In short, whether or not it is acceptable under Jewish law, donating to Christian charities isn't the best option.  You can find the charity that best suits your wishes on Charity Navigator.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Their sign said that donations would help save a child's life but <strong>I don't know the scope</strong> of that …<br />\nIs it at all acceptable to donate to a … charity if <strong>I don't know whether</strong> or not the money will go towards …</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You've answered your own question right there.</p>\n<p>People (of any religion) are not required to give money to everyone that asks for it.\nIf they were, we'd all be broke except for some very rich scammers.</p>\n<p>If you are really concerned about it, ask them for their brochure and look up what they do when you get home.

    "content": "# Is there a penalty or measure of restitution for geneivas daas?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>With the crime of stealing (geneiva), the Torah is very specific about how the theif must pay as a penalty for his crime (e.g. depending on the circumstances, the thief could be liable for double the value of the stolen object, or as much as four or five times its value -- see Ex. 21:33-22:14).  Based on the concept expressed in the commandment קדֹשים תהיּּו (Lev. 19:2) -- that we should seek to be holy -- our sages understood the sin of theft to include גניבת דעת -- literally “stealing of the mind,” which includes various forms of misrepresenting oneself and misleading others. Chullin 94a.  The concept of גניבת דעת has been applied to such relatively simple concepts as holding a <a href=\"http://www.jabe.org/marketing-and-morality-breaking-the-barrier.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">\"closing sale\" when you have no intent of closing</a>, or cheating on the Regents exam (Igros Moshe (HM 11:30).  In theory, it could apply to under-reporting income on your tax returns, or election fraud, however I can't find authorities who speak to either topic specifically.  Some authorities consider גניבת דעת a Torah prohibition (see, e.g., the Ritva (Chullin 94a) and the Semag (154)) while others see it as Rabbinic when not involving commerce (e.g. the Shulchan Arukh Ha-Rav). My question is that since what is stolen in this case is a person's trust, is there a way to measure restitution or penalty, and would the measure of restitution/penalty be similar to other types of theft?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The poskim discuss the idea that gezel akum, as opposed to ta'us akum, is prohibited.  The two reasons that are given are because it moves into the normal realm of gezel, or because it is geneivas da'as.  The Sha'ar Hamishpat (<a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8664&pgnum=336\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siman 348 sif katan 2</a>) says that the practical difference between the two is restitution, because geneivas da'as has no restitution.  He seems to assume it is obvious that geneivas da'as has no monetary restitution.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, the Pischei Choshen (Hilchos Geneiva V'Ona'ah Ch. 15 #38) in discussing the prohibitions in C.M. 228 of artificially enhancing the appearance of a product, through fluffing or otherwise, comments that they are all only assur lechatchila, but they are just geneivas da'as and therefore do not have any monetary ramifications.</p>\n\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein in his above referenced discussion of cheating on the regents only gets into the monetary aspect when it has left the realm of geneivas da'as and became actual geneiva, since money is being taken unjustly.</p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, learning Derech Hashem before Mesilas Yesharim can be very hard, since you don't have the foundation (Mesillas Yesharim) of which to build upon.

Again, consult your rabbi for specific questions as they apply to you.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>\"Shifting one's personal clock\" and the like -- the example you gave was someone who finds himself in the wilderness and has no sense of what day it is -- the Talmud says he should start some sort of calendar and work with it. That's not applicable to the situation at hand, in which everyone agrees that it's now Friday January 31st 2014 and that sunset is at 6pm (or whatnot). So that's when shabbat begins for everyone on the boat, no matter what they're up to.</p>\n\n<p>If it's necessary for someone to stand watch, then they are obligated to do so -- protecting lives trumps any obligations of shabbat -- but it's still shabbat. This is basically the same as the doctor who gets called in to perform emergency surgery on shabbat -- it's still shabbat, but he is obligated to save a life even if that means driving, cutting, writing, whatever. As far as taking the shift to begin with, this has long been discussed (e.g. doctors' call schedules) and relates to the question of: \"if a life-and-death situation arises, I violate shabbat. How hard must I try to avoid getting put into such a situation to begin with?\" But let's assume that the shifts have already been assigned.</p>\n\n<p>At that point the question is just \"if I'm busy doing life-saving work and can't pray, what do I pray afterwards?\". For instance, if someone's shift goes from 3pm to 11pm on Friday, sunset is sometime during that stretch, and he cannot recite any prayers while on shift, then he can simply do all the prayers and kiddush at 11pm. If he was occupied from sunset till dawn, then he should recite Shabbat morning prayers but repeat the <em>amida</em> to make up the missed one from last night, then recite the full Friday-night kiddush before eating breakfast on Saturday morning. Similarly, someone who was occupied from dawn till noon on Saturday should recite <em>amida</em> at Mincha twice, to make up for the missed prayer. Someone on shift 11am-7pm Saturday (let's assume sunset is 5pm) had missed Mincha (afternoon prayers), so he would do the Saturday-night prayers and recite its Amida twice, the second time making up for missing Saturday afternoon. (The exact same concept would hold if you couldn't pray on a Tuesday afternoon, for that matter.)</p>\n\n\n",

And does this mean that one does not need to write this on this Ketubah? </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Firstly, Judaism makes it quite clear that we do not blame the victim of a rape: \"as for the young woman [who was raped], don't do anything to her. This crime is just like if if one man jumped up and murdered another [you wouldn't blame the victim] -- [we assume] the woman screamed out, but no one was there to save her.\" (Deut. 22:25) Thus the appropriate process is healing, not <em>teshuva</em>. The rape victim did nothing wrong as far as G-d is concerned. (And yes, occasionally there are victims of rape or abuse who experienced whatever anatomic reactions during the process that would normally be associated with pleasurable sensations and sadly blame themselves for this. Again, Judaism does not blame the victim.) Nor do we demand that a victim forgive his/her tormentor. If the victim still feels guilt, she would be encouraged to discuss that with a competent mental-health professional, but the guilt serves no religious purpose.</p>\n\n<p>As has been discussed in similar questions here, the first steps are making sure that justice is served and that the victim can recover, physically and emotionally. This is the sort of thing that a prospective spouse should be informed of at some point during the dating process. As for the ketubah, Rabbi Moshe Feinstein rules that <em>betulta</em> can be written if the husband is okay with it (he accepts the same obligations that would apply to a <em>betulta</em>), <em>and</em> the rapist/abuser was a Jew who was not a very close relative. If the rapist/abuser was not Jewish, or G-d forbid a parent or sibling, then the ketubah would read <em>it'ta</em> (simply \"a woman\"), still with the sum of 200 zuz. Note the only people who need to see this are the couple and two witnesses. (And for the all the witnesses know, <em>it'ta</em> could simply mean she once had a non-Jewish boyfriend. There are no statements of judgement in a ketubah, only technical legal categories.) Meanwhile, if desired, a dummy ketubah with the word \"betulta\" can be read out-loud  (and/or displayed on the living room wall, if you like) -- quite frankly this is none of the business of the hundreds of people attending.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If the kesuba does not contain the word besula I doubt she could claim 200. If she was not a virgin then unlike the previous answer she cannot write besula. If the husband though agrees I dont know.\nIs a woman allowed to trick her husband to give him the impression she is a besula when she isnt.\nThe minchas yitschak says she is not allowed to. The Klausenberger rebbe says she is. Although the shaala was about one of his relatives and that may have played a part in his tshuva. \nI tend to approve of the minchas yitschak.</p>\n\n\n",

They even discuss why Og and the Reim (giant sea creature) didn't die, and conclude that they survived by being physically attached to the ark. The rabbis of the Talmud additionally opine that animals were killed because they engaged in unnatural sexual acts, but the fish did not.</p>\n\n<p>So it seems to me that the Talmud does not dispute in the least that everyone outside the ark died. That is to say, there is no tradition that seems to suggest Genesis 6-11 were not literal, and that people were left alive outside the ark.</p>\n\n<p>According to Jewish Tradition, the Flood happened in the Traditional Hebrew Year 1656, which corresponds (within some error margin) to the year 2104 BC. Ussher's chronology, based not on Hebrew Tradition but based on a literal reading of Genesis finds the flood having occurred at 2348 BC.</p>\n\n<p>However, the above situation does not seem to fit at all with what we find in science, history, and archaeology. For an overview of the problems, you can see this: <a href=\"http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html\">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/faq-noahs-ark.html</a></p>\n\n<p>Here is a list of major problems:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Archaeology and history. The Egyptian Old Kingdom seems to transition smoothly into the Egyptian Middle Kingdom, as we can see from language, economy, knowhow, etc. The Pyramid of Cheops, the Pyramid of Djoser, etc. were built prior to 2500BC, whereas Senusret II and III pyramids were built after 1900BC. It seems obvious from the Egyptians were not wiped out by the flood. The closest hint I can even find is a tiny erosion in the sphinx: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_water_erosion_hypothesis\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_water_erosion_hypothesis</a></p></li>\n<li><p>Genetics. Regardless of when the flood happened in the last 10,000 years, we would have a genetic bottleneck in all humans and animals. Humans for example would all come from one father who lived in the last 10,000 years. This is testable, but in fact no bottleneck is found.

The Kengaroos, Koalas and other marsupials that live there should have genomes that diverged around that time (To be fair, I know little about genome sequencing of marsupials but there seems to be a major discrepancy because molecular genome estimates say Marsupials diverged no earlier than 60 million years ago:  <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000436\">http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1000436</a> whereas other sources conveniently claim 160M years ago <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7361/full/nature10291.html%3FWT.ec_id%3DNATURE-20110825\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v476/n7361/full/nature10291.html%3FWT.ec_id%3DNATURE-20110825</a>). In any case, genetic drift of isolated populations on different continents should show up as divergence in the genomes with their cousins on other continents.

This one contradicts \"flood geology\" by Creationist scientists which claims that the sediments were laid down by the flood. TalkOrigins puts it very well:</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Creationists, on the other hand, must explain to us how sediment and rock laid down in a mere year can yield such fantastic, orderly differences in radiometric ages. This poses a fatal problem whether one believes in the accuracy of radiometric dating or not! One would think that the flood sediments (gathered from the four corners of the old antediluvian world) and their associated igneous rock (formed during the flood) would all register very little radiometric age. At the very least we would expect random fluctuations if the radiometric methods were totally at sea. Why should the percentage of lead to uranium in zircon crystals (the key to ordinary uranium-lead, radiometric dating) depend on which geologic period they are found in? If most of the geologic column were created during Noah's flood, would it really matter whether a zircon crystal was found in Cambrian strata or Cretaceous strata, in Jurassic strata or Tertiary strata? Noah's flood might just as easily deposit the same crystal in one place as another. <a href=\"http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/howgood-gc.html\">http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/hovind/howgood-gc.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In short, the flood had to be universal (even if local) because of Jewish theological considerations, and a universal flood contradicts a lot of known history, biology, geology etc.</p>\n\n<p>The main problem is that these sciences are independently able to arrive at a consistent picture of the world. Perhaps one or two techniques by themselves would be wrong. Perhaps they could be off when extrapolating into the millions of years. But we are talking about ALL of them being wrong, and about the last 10,000 years. How to reconcile the two views?</p>\n\n<p>Finally, here is my biggest worry. Doesn't Bayes' Theorem in that case disprove Judaism:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P(A) = P(B) * P(A given B) / P(B given A)\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If A is Judaism and B is the universal flood, we have:</p>\n\n<pre><code>P(A given B) = I'll be generous and say 99%, meaning Christianity, Islam etc get 1% combined\n\nP(B given A) = Theological considerations above would suggest 90%,\nbut I will be generous and say Judaism only 20% insists on a universal flood\n\nP(B) = Probability of a universal flood is super super low, like 0.1%\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Multiplying seems to disprove Judaism to me. That combined with all the other stories like the exodus of 3 million Jews etc.</p>\n\n<p>So how do I reconcile the two worldviews?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 16)\n\n<p>At the core of your question is the assumption that the flood and its fallout was natural, and was subject merely to the laws of nature as we see them today. For the purposes of this answer I will not accept that premise, however I think that one can still reconcile the evidence we see nowadays with the flood in a cogent way that draws upon the natural sciences we accept. I will attempt to address each of your points in this vein.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Concerning Egypt's uninterrupted society, see Gen 8:22. Based on the phrase \"<em>Further, all the days</em>...\", I would argue that Gd is saying that He will facillitate the reestablishment of civilizations, which would consequently overwrite any societal evidence of a near-extinction of humanity. The world needed to be repopulated and Gd didn't waste any time. He blessed Noah and his sons to be fruitful and multiply and fill the land. This blessing allowed for them to reproduce at an accelerated pace, so much so that the names of their children are the names we have for the seventy nations, because they very rapidly grew in number, diversified, and reestablished civilization. <strong>So there is no evidence of interruption in ancient Egypt, because their effectively was none.</strong> Gd kept the Egyptian structures and civilizations in tact throughout the flood, repopulated the region very rapidly, and provided its inhabitant with all the knowledge they needed to resume Egyptian history.</li>\n<li>Concerning a genetic bottleneck, again I am arguing that the blessing from Gen 9:1 caused unnatural fecundity which led to a very rapid diversification of humanity. Gd may have also used <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyploid\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">polyploidy</a> to cause more genetic diversity so that the nations would become more distinct from one another and adopt their own identities and cultures. Again, Gd wanted us to fill the land, and He helped us to adapt and diversify at an unnatural speed so that there wouldn't be a period where the creation was desolate and empty. It was meant to be teeming with life and Gd didn't let the trivial interruption of the flood stop Him from bringing things back to where they were beforehand. He never intended to sacrifice the progress that He had facillitated in Creation, just those who had corrupted Creation.</li>\n<li>Concerning plants, I would argue that they weren't killed in the flood, as many who are <em>far</em> greater than me <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10815/4682\">have</a>.</li>\n<li>Concerning the diversity of animals, see Gen 8:17 and my second counterpoint. It is also possible that the man varied species of animals were all taken, two by two in to the ark. In other words, the species already existed in their current forms, so they were already genetically distinct from the past.</li>\n<li>Concerning the sediments, again you are assuming that the water of the flood was just water, and that this was a 'natural disaster'. The Talmud <a href=\"http://www.dafyomi.org/index.php?masechta=sanhedrin&daf=108b\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">describes</a> the waters as being like semen, and Rashi adds that they were scalding and thick. I would argue that water here is meant only to suggest liquidity. In reality the flood was made up of something else. If you prefer new earth creationism, you could say that it was made up of corrosive and radioactive compounds that Gd arranged in sedimentary layers to fall in line with His desired continuum in 8:22. If you prefer Old Earth, which from your comment above about adam amongst hominids you seem to, I would argue that the make up of the water is irrelevant, as the sedimentary layers were already there. The only thing that Gd did was prevent the floodwaters from corrupting the sediments, again so as not to undermine the tremendous progress His creation had undergone.</li>\n<li>Lastly, concerning Baye's theorem, I would argue that, as there was supernatural intervention by Gd, who is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/10051/4682\">outside of the realm of probability</a>, the whole point is irrelevant.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>In conclusion</strong>, the flood, by natural standards, should have evidence that supports it... but it wasn't natural. Gd was not going to compromise eons of genetic diversity and forward progress for the sake of the sins of lowly man. So He used the flood to destroy man and the parts of creation he had corrupted, and then He promptly reset the progress that Creation had made.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>I don't expect to have this marked as the correct answer, because my ability to recall and quote sources is abysmal.   How many other people accept what I write as theologically sound is going to depend on the assumptions you are working with.  We are always too happy to call other strains of thought as being heretical.</p>\n\n<p>I think the main problem that you are presenting is a question about what exactly is the point and purpose of the Torah?  The common understanding of the Torah is that it basically presents us with different types of material.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Gd's role in the creation of the world</li>\n<li>Gd's role in the history of human development</li>\n<li>Mans' role in the history of human development</li>\n<li>History about the founding of the Jewish people</li>\n<li>Laws for Jewish society</li>\n<li>Laws for worshiping Gd.</li>\n<li>Stories about the activities of the Jewish people from the Exodus until entering the land of Israel.</li>\n<li>Stories about specific instances in which the law developed or changed during the 40 year period.</li>\n<li>A summary of those laws and stories with a shift in focus</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The rest of tanach tends to go in the same direction. History mixed with laws, mixed with guidelines for worshiping Gd and for running Jewish society, either told as stories/history or given as direct prophecies or rulings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>But again, what is the point or purpose?</strong></p>\n\n<p>Another direction for the question. The Torah is called the Torah (instructions,laws,teachings) it is not called the Korot or Toldot(History, though the translation is a bit faulty). And yet the main way to learn about actual instructions, laws, and teachings, is from the Torah shebal peh. The Talmuds and related material.  It would seem at first glance, that the Torah is not fulfilling it's purpose well.</p>\n\n<p>To summarize.  Based on the name, we would expect the Torah to be mainly about laws and teachings. But in actuality, most of the text is focused on stories or history.  We would expect to learn the laws and teachings from the Torah text, but in actuality we learn most of them from baal peh.</p>\n\n<p>I believe this problem is a modern problem, caused by our new understanding and purpose of things such as History and Scientific but non-technological pursuits.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the list above, I would reword the list as follows:<br>\nThe Torah contains the following:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Life lessons about the creative process.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about man's relationship to the environment.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about about the base needs and desires of people.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about building a family with a purpose.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about how to live within a greater society.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about how to give society a direction and purpose.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about the pitfalls and mistakes that are made while trying to build society.</li>\n<li>Life lessons about how to adapt those pitfalls into success.</li>\n<li>A summary of those life lessons with a shift of focus into a society that is already built.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The rest of tanach, then continues in this manner. We get life lessons about kingdoms, and personal battles, life lessons about how to treat various members of society, what happens when we don't, life lessons about society when it loses it's larger goal and focus, and how to get it back etc.</p>\n\n<p>The Torah, is now composed of teaching (life lessons), and the Oral Torah is now free to focus on the small details, of how we follow the law and live our daily life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Now to get back to your main question.</strong></p>\n\n<p>Once we recognize that the Torah is Literature, teaching us life lessons, and is not a book of knowledge about science and history, we shift our attention regarding the details.  Our list of questions, regarding the stories should shift focus.  For example, here are the questions I ask while reading the Tanach.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>What lesson do the numbers in the story convey?</li>\n<li>What lesson is gained by the name or location of a place?</li>\n<li>What lesson is learned from this detail?</li>\n<li>What lessons do we learn by looking at the larger structure of phrases.</li>\n<li>Etc.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>There is a general problem to this approach, of learning lessons from stories however.  People can write great stories that never happened and place into those stories, lessons for others to learn through osmosis.  However, if there is no truth to the stories, can we really trust the lessons?  It is for this reason, that we as a society, ask everyone else in society to believe the stories we tell.  Beginning with Bereshit, each piece of the Torah tells us information that is both True, but also, contains many details which are not accurate descriptions of how things might have happened.  I believe there are two reasons for this. </p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Torah needs to be read and understood by every generation, from the beginning of the conquest of Israel, until the end of time.  This is strictly speaking, impossible. Word connotations change, societal understanding and values change.  The only way to get the Jewish people to read the Torah and to gain from it in the generation the live in, is to have statements that are not what we today would call absolutely true. From the beginning the Torah hits us in the face with literally untrue statements, so that we can be aware of the context of the words, and learn from them appropriately.  Today for example, there is a big push to understand the words as the original receivers of the Torah understood them. This desire can only be fulfilled because of other outside of Torah knowledge that we can gain from the past.  If the Torah however did not contain any obviously untrue statements, even the most liberal Jews would likely be ignoring that outside information as something which can impact Jewish understanding.</p></li>\n<li><p>No knowledge is perfect, save Gd's. We can never know every detail, every objective fact. We can only know the best of what we can know.  Life requires the ability to move forward and make decisions even when given a certain amount of doubt.  We must also know the difference between knowledge that is relevant and useful and knowledge that is not.  Was the flood global, or is the word \"world\" only meant in the more limited sense of the society that I participate in, and thus the flood was local?  But more importantly.. Does it matter? What difference does it make in your life if the flood covered Australia, or if the flood only covered a small section of Northwestern Iraq?  What difference did it make in Noah's life?  What difference does it make if all of Humanity descends from Noah, or if all of humanity descends from a single micro-organism?</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You indicated in your main question, or the bounty, however that this is a big issue of faith or trustworthiness.  <strong>If some details of the Torah are not 100% true and verifiable, then why should one trust any of it?</strong></p>\n\n<p>My perspective to that question is to take a different route. The Torah makes promises in general.  And Tanach says things about the Jewish people. Tanach also focuses on a small patch of land, within the entire world, and it uses History to teach life lessons.</p>\n\n<p>So let us look at history, and look at ourselves and Gd's world and decide if the Torah is true.  Are the Jewish people unique in the world? Are the Jewish people living in Israel after long exiles? Where the Jewish people scattered around the world and hated?  Did the land of Israel flourish while the Jewish people were exiled? Is Israel the focus of world attention while the Jewish people are living here?  Do the Jewish people still exist?  Do the teachings of the Torah lead to a better quality of life in the world? Do societies function better when they are based on the culture and teachings of Tanach?</p>\n\n<p>To me, those are the important question regarding the Torah's Truth and question if our religion is just one of humanities many coping mechanisms, or if it is based on reality.  The Torah is full of false or misleading information if one read the Torah for scientific accuracy, and this has been true since recorded history. (I believe it is the Greeks in the Talmud bring similar questions to the Rabbis)  But that is one of the lessons of the Torah, to keep focus on what is actually important.  If you are unable to discern truth and reality from fiction, you will be unable to gain Wisdom. But how can you discern such things, if you have no examples of each?</p>\n\n<p>To address predicted objection here.  No, Gd is not tricking us. He is giving us access to different levels of understanding, based on the level of knowledge gained in the world. The stories in their essence are true, but only where it matters.  As we gain a greater understanding of how the human mind works, and how stories affect human cognition, how emotions become as important a feature to understanding as cold facts and logic, we will gain a greater understanding of how to understand the stories of the Torah.  While education on these matters remain low, then understanding of the Torah will also need to be done in such a way as to reflect that.  i.e. Grade school level of knowledge of the world requires a grade school level of knowledge of Torah. PHD level of knowledge of the world, requires a PHD level of knowledge of Torah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I see no reason for not assuming that parshas Noach is a mashal. Natan Slifkin has already shown that many commentators (most notably Rav Hirsch in collected writings) view Bereishis as a mashal. The Meiri in the beginning of his hakdamah to Avos assumes that the Dor Haflagah was a mashal. \nWhy not just say that the first two parshiyos were parables. The literal story of the Torah begins with Lech Lecha.\nGranted, no commentator that I know of posits such a thing, but that may be simply because the questions about the Flood are more recent. The story of the Tower in the Dor Haflagah was untenable even in the times of the Meiri. After Darwin, classic  Ma'aseh Bereishis seemed to need to be reworked to fit with science. Now, with our scientific knowledge, we have to do the same thing to the story of the Mabul. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Halacha for a lending library dealing with publishers' stipulations\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I operate a free book-lending library which is funded by donations of money and of books.  Somebody donated some books to the library that state inside that it is not permissible for libraries to lend these books out without the publisher's permission.  I called the publisher of one of the books and he said that since this book is out of print for quite a few years it is not a problem, but all books that they publish that are still in print are not allowed to be loaned out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is the Halacha on this concept? Can a publisher prevent a lending library from lending out books that it published?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This would not be prohibited through the laws of the land, since the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine\" rel=\"nofollow\">First Sale Doctrine</a> (17 United States code section 109(a))exhausts copyright lending laws at the point of sale.</p>\n\n<p>Normal copyright laws in halacha cover the profits from something, not the use of the object itself (Chasam Sofer Choshen Mishpat 49).  Therefore, if you aren't profiting, it wouldn't be a problem.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Shoel Umeishiv (1:1:44) has a much broader understanding of copyright laws which seems to be more of an ethical imperative to respect the work of others.  I don't know if this would include lending without reproducing.</p>\n\n<p>The Rama and the Shach have a dispute in Choshen Mishpat siman 73 if the law of the land can override the halacha in awarding monetary rights.  The Rama holds that it can (his case being that the halacha says a person cannot sell collateral that was not redeemed even after a year, and the law of the land says that he can sell it after a year, that he can sell it as per the law of the land).  Many later authorities adopt this Rama.  One could therefore reasonably rely on the Rama to give you the right to lend it as per the First Sale Doctrine.</p>\n\n<p>However, the Ramban says that the injunction of \"You shall do the just and the good\" requires us to do the \"right thing\" even when it is technically permitted.  Respecting the wishes of others could fall into this category, although this is a much fuzzier guideline.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is shogeg beyond my control?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In havdalla in chonein hada'as of motzai shabbos maariv, we say \"חשוכים מכל חטא [ופשע] ומנוקים מכל עון\"</p>\n\n<p>חשוכים means to be prevented from, as in ואחשוך גם אנכי אותך מחטוא לי (Bereishis 20:6).</p>\n\n<p>The Etz Yosef commentary explains that חשוכים מכל חטא means to be prevented from doing any shogeg, accidental sin.  מנוקים מכל עון means that we should be cleansed of any intentional sin that was done.  But חשוכים could not be said by עון because we have the bechira to sin intentionally.</p>\n\n<p>My understanding of the difference between אונס and שוגג is that one (אונס) is beyond your control and completely unavoidable, and the other (שוגג) is a result of a degree of carelessness on your part, which was not intentional but was avoidable.  Thus we find שוגג קרוב לאונס by cases of accidents which were difficult but not impossible to avoid.</p>\n\n<p>So why is שוגג outside my bechira and acceptable to pray that it be withheld from me?  I seemingly have the choice to be careful enough to avoid שוגג as well as intentional sins.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This seems to parallel <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16383#showrashi=true&v=21\" rel=\"nofollow\">לא יאונה לצדיק כל און</a> - No wrong shall be caused for the righteous, certainly according to Rashi (there on the verse and other places) that this applies to all sin, but even according to Tosfos that this only applies to food or things which are degrading for the Tzaddik, it is certainly appropriate to ask for that protection.</p>\n\n<p>Note in a similar way, the Arizal says (brought in באר היטב on O.C. 447) that anyone careful about a Mashehu of Chametz on Pesach will be spared from sins the whole year, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe explains (Sichos Kodesh 5740 Achron Shel Pesach) that this refers to שוגג only, as free choice is not removed from the person.</p>\n\n<p>So the point being it is possible to get divine help in avoiding accidental sin, and this is what we are asking for. Since we see that it is something that Hashem clearly does for deserving people, it is something worthy to ask for.</p>\n\n<p>As for the last part of the question, you can't chose to do a Shoggeg. Rather you choose to ensure that your circumstances and actions prevent one. If a situation happens that was preventable but potentially leads to a sin, whether or not it actually does is up to Hashem. He can prevent the improper preparation from leading to a sin, thus forgiving the improper preparation.</p>\n\n<p>(Parenthetically, I doubt it is humanly possible to prevent all shoggegs in everything in life. That is why there is a concept of לא יאונה לצדיק כל און - once you have done what you can do, Hashem takes care of the rest).</p>\n\n<p>With a Meizid, you can ask to be forgiven, you can ask to not be tempted, but you cannot ask to be stopped from doing it, as that is your choice. With a Shoggeg, you can still do the things you shouldn't have done, and still be prevented, because your choice wasn't to do an Aveirah, it was simply to do something that could have not been done and avoided the situation. But since you have no control over if the situation will actually lead to an Aveira, you can ask that it not actually go there. This is a form of forgiveness, for sure, but it is a more powerful one, as it prevents the sin in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Or put another way, to use the other example, the food could turn out to be Kosher, at which point the whole sin is avoided. That is what we are asking for. Not to be prevented from the things we chose, but from their consequences.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Firstly, forgiveness from accidental sins far predates the <em>havdallah</em>,we find in Psalm 90,  .שגיאות מי יבין, מנסתרות נקני \"Who can discern <em>shogegim</em>, cleanse (?) me from hidden sins.\" In fact, the Thirteen Attributes of Mercy include נושא...וחטאה \"Who forgives...accidental sin.\"</p>\n\n<p>Presumably, while one could be careful enough to avoid such sins, in practice many of us aren't. So we pray that even if we do the wrong thing by being careless, HaShem should still prevent a sin from happening. For example, if we aren't careful about making sure food is kosher, we ask that HaShem make sure it is.</p>\n\n<p>This is similar to the morning blessing \"and do not bring us..to the hands of temptation.\" While we do have the <em>bechirah</em> to withstand the temptation, we still want HaShem to limit the opportunity for us to exercise that <em>bechirah</em> in the wrong way.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>there are different levels of shogeg.</p>\n\n<p>The Rambam writes in Hilchot Rotzeach ch.6\n(there's a chabad translation on this <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1088922/jewish/Chapter-Six.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <ol>\n  <li><p>There are three categories of unintentional killers.</p></li>\n  <li><p>There is a person who kills unintentionally (b'shgaga), he is exiled...</p></li>\n  <li><p>There is a person who kills unintentionally (b'shgaga) but the shgaga (accident) is karov l'oness (close to being beyond his\n  control)... he is exempt from Galut (exile)</p></li>\n  <li><p>There is a person who kills unintentionally (b'shgaga) but the shgaga (accident) is karov l'zadon (close to intentional), this is\n  where there was a negligence, or that he should have been more\n  careful. He is not exiled, because his sin is great and exile is not\n  enough to atone for him.</p></li>\n  </ol>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>hence, there are 3 levels of shogeg.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>close to oness (beyond control). for that he does not need atonement</p></li>\n<li><p>close to negligent. </p></li>\n<li><p>somewhere in between. this is what the torah refers to in the shogeg murderer who needs atonement.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>However for a total oness (i.e. something totally beyond one's control, The Gemara (see Nedarim 27a) derives from a verse in the Torah that \"Ones Rachmana Patrei\" )</p>\n\n<p>As to why we pray to avoid shogeg (which implies some negligence), we are after all human beings. So we ask for help that we don't err as in Yishai's answer</p>\n\n<p>furthermore some things are totally unintended and blameless but damage one spiritually. such as eating bugs in food. so we can pray for help in that.</p>\n\n\n",

(Depending which translation you look at, the term \"belief\" is in the text of the Principle itself, but in Kapach's translation it is not in the description of the Principle, but is in the Rambam's concluding paragraph, in which he says about all 13 \"belief.\")  The Rambam (in Kapach's translation) sums up with:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וכאשר יהיו קיימים לאדם כל היסודות הללו <strong>ואמונתו</strong> בהם אמתית הרי הוא נכנס בכלל ישראל</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(paraphrased):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>\"anyone who <strong>believes</strong> these 13 principles is not an apikorus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the other hand, in Yesodei Hatorah, both in the koseres and in the first halacha, the Rambam says that the <em>mitzvah</em> is to <strong>know</strong> that G-d exists:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>יש בכללן עשר מצוות--שש מצוות עשה, וארבע מצוות לא תעשה; וזה הוא פרטן:  (א) <strong>לידע</strong> שיש שם אלוה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(paraphrased):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The first Mitzvah is to <strong>know</strong> that G-d exists.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(In the Sefer Hamitzvos many printings have \"להאמין\" by the Mitzvah, but the mistake in that translation has been pointed out numerous times.  See the notes in the Frankel Rambam there for a nice summary.)</p>\n\n<p>R' Yaakov Weinberg explained that the discrepancy is because in the 13 Principles, the Rambam is not listing Mitzvos - he is making statements - <em>if</em> you believe these 13 things, you will not be an apikorus.  For not being an apikorus, belief is enough.  But the <em>Mitzvah</em> of awareness of G-d is to <em>know</em> that He exists - to take that belief and develop it into knowledge.</p>\n\n<p>As an extra credit point, R' Weinberg explained why both sides of this contrast make sense.  The Mitzvah <em>has to be</em> to know, because you cannot have a <em>Mitzvah</em> to believe in G-d - if you believe He exists, then the Mitzvah is unnecessary, and if you don't believe He exists, then you won't be accepting a commandment from someone you don't believe exists.  The Principle is to believe, because <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/38249/4794\">the nature of the Principles</a> is forming the framework in which you will not be able to justify for yourself to not serve Hashem.  For that, belief that He exists is enough.</p>\n\n<p>However, this just means that 100% is not the requirement to leave the category of apikorus.  If someone is just playing the odds, but doesn't <em>really</em> believe that He exists, that would not suffice.  They would need to have strong enough belief to not be able to convince themselves that He doesn't exist when it becomes convenient to do so. (I can't put a percentage on that #.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/68831/jewish/What-do-Agnostics-Believe.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This Chabad Article</a> deals with agnosticism which Thomas Huxley defined as the \"doctrine that humans cannot know of the existence of anything beyond the phenomena of their experience\" (and therefore, my words, cannot be sure of the existence of G-d). </p>\n\n<p>The article quotes the sixth Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn (1880-1950) who told one self-proclaimed atheist, \"We are all believers in G-d. It is just a matter of definition.\"</p>\n\n<p>Therefore someone who isn't 100% certain of God's existence should not be considered a unbeliever.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>There is perhaps an indication from Rashi that someone who is unsure is not a kofer. In <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=2&daf=31&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maseches Shabbos 31a</a>, in referring to someone whom Hillel had converted even though the person had said that he believes in the Written Law but not the Oral Law, Rashi writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שלא היה כופר בתורה שבעל פה אלא שלא היה מאמין שהיא מפי הגבורה </p>\n  \n  <p>That he did not deny the Oral Law; he just didn't believe that it was\n  from the mouth of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>While the simple reading of this is that Rashi is contrasting the complete denial of the Oral Law with the acceptance of the Oral Law while not acknowledging its Divine origin, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Strashun\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Shmuel Strashun</a> interprets it differently.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>נ\"ל כוונתו דכופר לא מיקרי אלא אחר החקירה בכל חלקי הסותר אבל זה לא חקר\n  ולא נוכח אלא שלא היה מאמין</p>\n  \n  <p>It appears to me that his [Rashi's] intent is that one is not called a\n  \"denier\" (כופר) except after investigating all aspects of the issue.\n  But this person did not investigate or study; he simply didn't\n  believe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think that R. Strashun is saying that the contrast Rashi is making is between someone who denies, and someone who doesn't believe. In other words, in order to be considered a kofer you have to actually actively conclude that the idea in question is false. Simply being unsure of its truth does not qualify someone as a kofer.</p>\n\n\n",

Argaman in Hebrew. Others state that it is similar to lake, a purplish red dye extracted from lac (Radak, Sherashim; Rambam on Kelayim 9:1; cf.Yad, Kley HaMikdash 8:13). Although the Septuagint translates argaman as porphura or porphoreus, which means purple, in ancient times, 'purple' denoted a deep crimson, most notably the dye obtained from the purpura snail. Ancient sources indicate that it was close to the color of fresh blood (Iliad 4:141).\n  Talmudic sources state that argaman was obtained from a living creature (Yerushalmi, Kelayim 9:1), and other sources indicate that it was an aquatic creature (I Maccabees 4:23; Abarbanel on Exodus 25:10). Like tekheleth it was obtained from Tyre (2 Chronicles 2:6, cf. Ezekiel 27:16) as well as Greece or Italy (Ezekiel 27:7, Targum ad loc.).</p>\n  \n  <p>This dye was therefore most probably derived from a species of the murex or purpura snail. The Septuagint translation, porphura, also denotes the purpura snail. Ancient sources indicate that snails caught in the north yielded a blue dye, while those from the south yielded a reddish dye (Aristotle, History of Animals 5:15).

Others say that it is related to the root arag, meaning 'to weave' (BeMidbar Rabbah 4:17, 12:4). Some therefore say that it consisted of two types of thread or three colors woven together (Raavad, Kley HaMikdash 8:13). Some say that it is an irridescent dye, having greenish overtones (Zohar 2:139a; Tikkuney Zohar 70, 127b, top, 124a, top; Maaseh Choshev 3:2).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.otzar.org/wotzar/book.aspx?103265\" rel=\"nofollow\">Meor L'Afeila - Rabbeinu Nesanel ben Yeshaya</a> Parshas Teruma says that it is a light red color.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>וארגמן הוא הצבע האדום הממוזג בצהיבות</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.temple.org.il/show.asp?id=31714\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mechon HaMikdash</a> also seems to translate it as some sort of red.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this a rabbinic or biblical prohibition?\nCan one at least do chazarah for him?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tabc.org/kol-torah/article/index.aspx?pageaction=ViewSinglePublic&LinkID=121&ModuleID=43&StartDate=3/23/2012\" rel=\"nofollow\">This article</a> details multiple viewpoints on the issue. I am excerpting the end / author's conclusion. Readers can agree or disagree, or better, follow M.Y.'s adage of consulting their Rav:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Common practice among our community is to host non-observant relatives\n  for Yom Tov. Moreover, it is common practice for observant Jewish\n  hotel owners to host and feed Jews who are obviously non-observant.\n  Outreach professionals routinely invite non-observant Jews for Yom\n  Tov, especially for the Seder. People either rely on the opinions that\n  this prohibition does not apply to non-observant Jews or that\n  contemporary non-observant Jews are regarded as Tinokot SheNishbeh’u.\n  <strong>It is certainly preferable in such a situation to cook all the Yom Tov\n  food in advance in order to eliminate concern for violating a Torah\n  level prohibition</strong>. In any event, the Halacha (Mishnah Berurah 495:5)\n  prefers preparing food before Yom Tov so as not to be preoccupied with\n  food preparation during the holiday.</p>\n  \n  <p>Conclusion</p>\n  \n  <p>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach (ad. loc.) laments the inability to\n  properly observe this Halacha in today’s circumstances. Nonetheless,\n  we should aspire to create highly joyful and spiritual Yom Tov\n  atmospheres in our homes that will inspire non-observant Yom Tov\n  guests to return to a life of Torah observance.</p>\n  \n  <p>Postscript</p>\n  \n  <p>It is ironic that we rely on the opinions that contemporary\n  non-observant Jews are compared to a Tinok SheNishbah in regard to\n  inviting them for Yom Tov. However, in many circumstances we rely on\n  Rav Moshe Feinstein’s opinion that today’s non-observant Jews are not\n  classified as Tinok SheNishbah, and are considered to be invalid\n  witnesses. These circumstances include situations regarding a child of\n  a woman’s second marriage who did not receive a proper Get from her\n  first husband. In such cases, we embrace Rav Moshe’s opinion that the\n  child is not a Mamzeir (illegitimate) if all witnesses to the mother’s\n  first marriage were non-observant. (For further discussion of this\n  issue, see Gray Matter: Volume One pages 83-92.) While there are ways\n  to resolve this inconsistency, it highlights the fact that Rav Moshe’s\n  ruling should be relied upon only if no other options exist. We should\n  all make efforts to ensure that civilly divorced non-observant Jews\n  should receive a proper Get even if they were married in a\n  non-Orthodox ceremony where all witnesses were non-observant Jews. Our\n  discussion raises the very distinct possibility that non-observant\n  Jews are not necessarily disqualified from serving as witnesses, since\n  they may be regarded as Tinokot SheNishbe’u.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The halacha is stated with regards to those who break Shabbat (see Yalkut Yosef 512:2), <strong>and the reason given is that they are considered, in halacha, like non-Jews for these purposes</strong>. The Bene Tziyon Hachadashot #23 states that Shabbat desecration is widespread nowadays, and thus we do not consider Jews who desecrate it as akin to non-Jews, forbidden to invite for Yom Tov. He limits this provision to those who at least go to shul and make kiddush, but break it in other ways. One is permitted to invite them so long as one is cooking together with food for one's own family in the same pot.</p>\n<p>Or Letziyon (Vol. III p.200) concurs, and adds that people who are simply ignorant of Jewish festivals are considered <em>tinokei shenishba</em>, akin to Jews raised in captivity and are thus blameless for their sins, and states, citing Hilchot Mamrim 3:3 (Rambam) that it is a very noble thing to invite such people on Yom Tov, as opposed to being forbidden!</p>\n<p><em>Sources for the above are Yalkut Yosef 512:2 and footnote 154.</em></p>\n<p>I'll add: It's hard to imagine a genuine case nowadays of a genuine Shabbat desecrator that this law would apply to, especially in light of all the big gedolim over the last century who have paskined that we are ALL <em>tinokei shenishba</em> (see The Tinok Shenishbah written by Rabbi Chaim Rapoport for the London Beth Din in 5757). Please CLYOR with regards to what to do in a practical situation.</p>\n\n\n",

The verse recommends modesty, cleanliness & chastity so that \"your camp shall be holy\" so that \"He not see an unseemly thing (\"ervah\") in you, and turn away from you.\" We derive laws like defecating modestly from here.\nTzniut vis a vis men (or for men, women) seems to be derived from Leviticus 18:6, \"None of you should APPROACH to any that is near of kin to him to uncover their nakedness; I am the Lord!\" Since the word for approach, TIKRAVU, has a connotation of coming close in some way, the Rabbis understood that to mean anything that increases the likelihood of inappropriate sexual conduct, e.g., suggestive or unduly attractive clothing, suggestive remarks, spending time together in private, etc. (With men tending to become stimulated visually, modesty for women has often revolved around clothes & make-up.)\nEarly non-Biblical sources, but before the Talmud's \"Hair in a woman is ervah\" & \"The thigh (shok, translated by many as the calf) in a woman is ervah\", is the Midrash Rabbah Beraishit that while G-d formed Eve, He repeated, \"Tznuah te'hei! Tzenuah te'hei!\" (Be modest! Be modest!), yet Woman is still challenged in issues of modesty. Also, the Mishnah in Bava Kamah (Ch. 8) where Rabbi Akiva levies a heavy fine on a man who pulled off a woman's head covering for \"boshet\", personal embarrassment. Though the man proves that she wasn't so careful about uncovering her own hair, Rabbi Akiva doesn't lower the fine.\n(Sorry if incomplete, I'm working without books here...)</p>\n\n\n",

Is it permissible to learn about them and be involved with them for healing purposes?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>There are different groups/individuals who discuss these ideas. Certainly, this use of the term \"energy\" has nothing to do with the scientific definition of the word. This \"energy\" idea has pagan roots and is known by many different names- In Hinduism the terms prana and chakra are used. In Chinese systems the terms are Chi or Qi. And there are many other variants. Most major poskim (rabbis who are expert in practical Jewish law) have expressed concerns with these ideas/methods and some have forbidden to be involved with them. </p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/42292938/%D7%A1%D7%91-%D7%93-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for example for a decision against the use of various \"energy\" medicines by Rabbis Yisroel Belsky, Shmuel Auerbach and Dovid Feinstein. \nAnd see <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50002&pgnum=345\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> from Rabbi Y.S. Elyashiv:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>אין היתר להשתמש ברפואות אלטרנטיביות שמקורם בדעות עובדי עבודה זרה\n  ויסודם בפעולת כחות לא טבעיים ־ אלא אם כין אפשר להוכיח שהוא עובד בדרך\n  ״הטבע״ בדרכי הבירור, ולא סגי בכך שהעוסקים ברפואות אלו מאמינים שהוא\n  ״טבע״. ויש לחוש בזה משום קוסם קסמים מעונן ומנחש, או משום דרכי האמורי.\n  וקל וחומר אם לא השמיטו מכלל הלימודים את חלק הע״ז שבדבר, שיש בזה איסורי\n  ע״ז</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Tendler is well known for being against unproven alternative medicine and probably forbids \"energy\" medicine as well.   </p>\n\n<p>The most pertinent aspect of Jewish law here is the prohibition against superstitious practices. That is codified in Shulchan Aruch, OC:301. The basic idea is that unproven (or perhaps dis-proven) remedies which are not based on science are forbidden. There are also may be other prohibitions involved, including divination and idolatry. (I need not mention the general obligation to guard ones health, and seek out medical intention in case of illness.) </p>\n\n<p>Of course, there are subtleties involved and this answer is not meant to substitute for a competent rabbi's decision. Be sure to ask a rabbi who knows the subject well, as many people are simply unaware of the pagan roots of some alternative medicine and may be unaware of the medical literature that has proven them ineffective.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In kabbalistic and other rabbinical literature, the terms \"nefesh\" (and sometimes \"ruach\"), understood as the lower souls, or levels of the soul, are often described as consisting of a \"life energy\" pulsating through the body, which is similar to the concept of \"qi\" found in Chinese medicine, and similar concepts found in many cultures worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>There are also more general references to a \"vital spirit\" within chassidic literature. For example, here are a couple quotes from Rebbe Nachman of Breslov, which describe the nature of this \"vital spirit.\"</p>\n\n<p>\"From the very beginning of life there is a vital spirit in the heart which causes it to contract and beat. This beat affects all the blood and fluids in the body. It beats in all the limbs of the body, and by constantly beating and churning them, it keeps them from stagnating and degenerating, just as the wind blows over the sea and beats and stirs the waters so that they do not stagnate. Most importantly, this beat pulsates in the arms and hands, which are constantly active and therefore need this beating, churning and cleansing more than anywhere else in the body. This is why the doctor can discover everything about a patient's condition by laying his hand on the patient's wrist and taking his pulse. This is because the arms are the main place where it is possible to feel the action of the heartbeat, which is responsible for the life of the whole body\" (Likutey Moharan I, 56:9).</p>\n\n<p>\"The depression which descends on a person when he has to struggle excessively for a living is the `filth of the serpent.' All the limbs of the body become heavy, and the vital spirit which pulsates in the body -- the very basis of life -- is weakened. The weaker it becomes, the heavier the limbs become, and they in turn weigh down the spirit even more. This vicious cycle can actually bring a person to the point of death.\" (Likutei Eitzot, Money and Livelihood).</p>\n\n<p>Some rabbis have disapproved of learning about or participating in energy-based practices. Rabbi Yitzchak Ginsburg, a well-known Israeli kabbalist, posits that alternative healing practices can harness energy \"from impure sources.\"</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.inner.org/responsa/leter1/resp49.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.inner.org/responsa/leter1/resp49.htm</a></p>\n\n<p>However, such negative appraisals are not universally held. Rabbi Yerachmiel Fried, for example, seems to approve of practicing Tai Chi (including sensing the flow of life energy stimulated by the exercise) in this article: </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.aish.com/atr/Tai-Chi.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.aish.com/atr/Tai-Chi.html</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rabbi Zamir Cohen in his book the discusses Auras as a scientific fact.

    "content": "# Making a tanoim/vort for a zivug sheini (2nd marriage)\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have heard from many that there is a minhag (custom) not to make what many call a \"tanoim\" or a \"vort\" (the celebration when a couple gets engaged) for 2 people that were once divorced. They base it on a Medresh in Bereshis Rabba that since the first luchos (tablets) were given in a loud way and they were broken therefore the 2nd luchos were given quietly. A comparison I suppose is drawn from there that there shouldn't be a \"big event\" or a publicized \"tanoim/vort\" by a zivug sheini. Although this comparison is made and mentioned by many (many poskim I called to ask) others told me it's not brought in any earlier seforim and is a relatively new minhag that is lacking a proper makor. <strong>Does anyone know where it come from that this medresh become the sort of \"source\" for not making a \"big event\" by a the tanoim or vort of a zivug sheini?</strong> I understand this is why we don't make a \"big deal\" by the wedding as well. </p>\n\n<p>(Note: Like I mentioned I asked many Rabbonim about this, many told me simply the minhag is to not make an noted the medresh as a \"source\". However it happened to be that the 2 \"biggest\" Rabbonim that I asked who are both dayanim that deal a lot with Evan HaEzer shailos, and especially one who is involved in Shalom Bayis, being m'seder Kedushin, etc (i.e. has a \"hand\" in these inyunim) both told me there is officially no reason not to make something \"normal\".

In the letter the Rabbi handwrote the words V'Yair Mazolam - ויאיר מזלם. The <a href=\"http://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/headlines-breaking-stories/212417/lubavitcher-rebbe-ztls-letter-to-yair-netanyahu.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">article</a> went on to say about the term V'Yair Mazolam as quoted:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Chabadniks explain [it] is generally not a term used by the Rebbe as a good\n  omen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Where did the Rabbi use this term with a negative connotation?

On those rare occasions where he did use such a phrase, however, it can indicate a positive blessing (that their mazal should brighten, i.e. be good).</p>\n\n<p>It seems like the Rebbe just used this as a cute way of wishing the baby a more personal blessing, since the baby's name was Yair. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does Judaism have a double standard?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have asked two questions on Mi Yodeya regarding discrepancies between claims found in Torah and what we think we know about the world.</p>\n\n<p>One is a small one: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35041/rivers-in-genesis\">Rivers in Genesis</a></p>\n\n<p>And one is a huge one: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/35059/how-to-reconcile-biblical-flood-story-vs-science-and-history?noredirect=1\">How to reconcile Biblical Flood story vs science and history?</a></p>\n\n<p>How would you explain to someone who does not a priori take for granted that the Torah was given on mount Sinai and that the Rabbis (continuing the Pharisaic tradition in the exile) are the one and only authoritative group of people to interpret what it says, that Judaism does not have a double standard with respect to every other religion?</p>\n\n<p>Here is what I mean. Given almost any other religion - let's say Christianity for example, orthodox Jews don't believe in it for one of two reasons:</p>\n\n<p>1) They didn't investigate it, and therefore they don't care enough or know enough about it.</p>\n\n<p>2) The rabbis found some objection, typically a discrepancy with what it says in Torah, and therefore this objection renders the religion a false one.</p>\n\n<p>Now, Protestant Christianity warns that without proper acceptance of the salvation through the sacrifice of Jesus, a person is likely to go to an eternal hell which, unlike the Jewish hell, lasts forever. It would seem that Pascal's wager would at least make one consider Christianity if one considers Judaism's blessings and curses section in Deuteronomy. If one indeed wishes to \"choose life\" then one should also be concerned with Christianity, it seems.</p>\n\n<p>And yet, it is largely dismissed by orthodox Jews. I am using Christianity as an example, but we may as well use Islam, which shares a belief in one God but has different requirements in order to get into heaven (depending on who you ask).</p>\n\n<p>So my question, simply put, is this: if orthodox Judaism does not consider any scientific objections or theological objections fatal to its belief system, how come it considers the most introductory objections to Christianity already completely fatal? Isn't this a double standard? As one specific example out of many:</p>\n\n<p>Skepticism vs Judaism: \"Do you really think after the flood that killed everyone on earth, animals teleported to Australia, two guys built egypt, and all ecosystems started with 2 predators and 2 prey 4k years ago?\" \"It's possible, why not. God can do anything, it says in the Mishnah that ...\"</p>\n\n<p>Judaism vs Christianity: \"Do you really think that God can have three different persons? Do you think he would make the Messiah die on the cross for everyone's sins and change the covenant after telling us that the law is forever?\" \"Well you see, the Law wasn't abolished, it was fulfilled, and as far as the Messiah and sins, you see you have no temple and no messiah for 2,000 years, maybe you missed him?\" \"Yeah but the rabbis tell us this is wrong.\" \"Well yeah, Jewish leadership sinned in previous generations so God passed the baton onto the Christian sect, who have the true authority to interpret scripture now.\"</p>\n\n<p>Basically, the reaction of Jews to the second conversation would be \"yeah, ok\". But remember - the stakes are greater if they are wrong. If the atheist is wrong, and Orthodox Judaism turns out to be the correct view of the world, he just gets a few months in Gehinnom or his soul is annihilated just as he expects anyway. If the Jew is wrong about Christianity, it would really suck. So what justifies this double standard, if a priori we are not assuming Orthodox Judaism of the Talmud is correct and just being rational?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I'm going to mostly ignore the examples you gave in your question, because I think they are a red herring.  Just to address your examples quickly, none of what you described seems rational to me. What difference does eternal hell make if I don't believe in the existence of hell in the first place? My human experiences tell me that no matter how bad a situation is, I will eventually \"get used to it.\"  So really, this is a non starter.</p>\n\n<p>In your Judaism vs skeptic paragraph, in that line of argument, I would side with the skeptic. It's a really bad response, and not at all convincing.</p>\n\n<p>However, you would be correct to suggest that I am more willing to work with a contradiction over differences in science and Judaism than I am willing to work through a contradiction between another religion and Judaism.</p>\n\n<p>My thoughts on this topic are basically the approaches of Rambam and the Kuzari.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>When it comes to Christianity or Islam, both religions base their premise on the Torah. Any arguments they have, must be consistent with Judaism.  Any arguments that they have which is inconsistent with Judaism, must be backed up with facts that are inarguable. (None exist).</p></li>\n<li><p>When it comes to science, it's really a question of reality. There are many declarations of science which I do not believe to be true, because I do not think that those statements are actually backed up by the facts, or there are multiple theories which are not yet conclusive.  However, the majority of science can be replicated, is observable, or leads directly to a usable technology which I can verify. This means that I know for a fact that some statement of science is true.  (I have seen fruit flies mutate from generation to generation for example)  I believe the Torah to be true, and I believe this scientific fact to be true.  Because I believe both idea to be true, I must reconcile them.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If it ever happened, that Jesus appeared on earth, and I knew for a fact that it happened, then I would be required to reconcile the Torah with that fact. (It's not going to happen, btw) Because, reality can not contradict the Torah.</p>\n\n<p>If however, I was not certain that the Torah was true, then I would be equally uncertain if Christianity was true, (since it's based on the Torah being true), and same with Islam.  I would also have to investigate if Hinduism or Buddhism, or Shinto, or Animalism, or any of 1,000 different other religions were true.  But rationally, the fact that a religion make some claim about eternity or the afterlife, will have absolutely zero impact on how I decide if that religion is true.</p>\n\n<p>So to repeat myself.  I know that most of science is true, and I know that some of science is false.  I also know that Judaism is true.  Those constructs, must then be reconciled.</p>\n\n<p>If I don't know if Christianity or Judaism or Zoroastrianism is true, then I don't need to attempt to reconcile any of them together. There is no starting point of truth to even give me a desire of reconciliation.</p>\n\n<p>When it comes to religion, I personally find that reconciling Jewish behavior with Jewish theory, is much harder to reconcile, than Science and Religion, or different religious texts and views.  But the standard by which these judgements are the same.  There is no double standard.</p>\n\n<p>If two things are true, they must be reconciled, if only one is true and the other is unkown, then first you must prove the unknown before reconciliation is required.</p>\n\n<p>And just to prove to you that threats of damnation are meaningless...</p>\n\n<p>Pirkei Avot:\n\"Do not be like slaves who serve the master in order to obtain a reward. Rather, be like slaves who serve the master not to receive a reward. And let the awe of Heaven be upon you.\" (1:3)\n\"Be as careful in observance of a minor commandment as in a major commandment, because you don't know the respective rewards for the commandments.\" (2:1)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The big difference between Judaism and other religions is that Judaism holds that millions of people saw God give the Torah at Mount Sinai. No other religion in the world claims such a thing.</p>\n\n<p>This matters because it's one thing for one person to announce that they had a vision or dream or prophecy, and then persuade lots of other people (using words or swords) to believe him. On the other hand, you can't convince millions of people that millions of their ancestors saw something. Hence, a tradition based on that many witnesses is far superior and more credible than a tradition based on one.</p>\n\n<p>Therefore, when Jews say that Christianity or Islam is wrong because XYZ doesn't make sense, I don't think that they're trying to make a watertight argument against those religions; they're just making a point.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>All of your examples of inconsistencies are reasons why no sane person should switch religions based on the integrity of the narrative.</p>\n\n<p>A priori sticking to the Talmud is the rational option for Jews that started out as Jews. Since both Christianity and  Judaism have apparent narrative flaws to switch  one lame horse for the other would not be helpful from an objective truth seeking perspective.</p>\n\n<p>Even Atheism is flawed in this way because one ultimately has to get around how either something came from nothing or something existed without a precursor. Both of these phenomena are currently considered to be supernatural.</p>\n\n<p>Judaism is thus not less true than its leading competitors but the Jew is expected to stick with it not based solely on its truth value, but also because it is the lore of our tribe and community. From my understanding, the big deal about apostasy is not so much the incorrectness of the new set of tenets, but the turning away from the tribe. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Does the Torah ever mention jail as a punishment for a crime?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have learned that punishments in the Torah often (always?) have a rehabilitative aspect to them as well as providing justice to the victim, e.g. someone who steals and can't pay back the value of what he stole becomes a slave, and through this experience it is hoped he will learn how to live properly. Or, even when a murderer is killed for his crime, this punishment is ultimately the best thing for his neshama.</p>\n<p>My question is, is there ever a scenario where the Torah prescribes locking someone away as a punishment - not for the waiting period before the case is heard, but as the punishment itself?</p>\n<p>In the world in general, prison is not rehabilitative and there is a high rate of recidivism among the people who go there.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.talkreason.org/articles/kuzariflaws.cfm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this website</a> (which I have not yet reviewed) presents multiple comprehensively sourced refutations.</p>\n<p>Some of the arguments (more to come):</p>\n<p><strong>Arguments by example against the uniqueness of the Revelation story</strong></p>\n<p>There are similar stories of public miracles witnessed by many thousands of people, which are believed by certain religions by not by others.  Examples include the Feeding of the Masses by Jesus and the death of Husain ben Ali.  Thus we see that stories similar to the National Revelation at Sinai can be invented and believed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>R' Gottlieb responds to this argument by saying there is a <em>qualitative</em> difference between the several thousand witnesses to the Jesus story and the 600k witnesses to the Revelation, but does not explain <em>why</em> there is such a difference.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He also responds that the descendants of the witnesses are not the ones making these claims, ignoring the fact that at least some of the descendants of the witnesses of the Jesus event indeed believe this story.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are similar stories which affect the character of a nation's culture, such as the multitude of origin stories.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gottlieb responds by saying \"If a story places the event so far in the past that no records whatsoever survive from that time, then indeed one can make up stories about one's ancestors... But the revelation at Sinai was accepted at a time when many records existed.\"  He appears not to realize that there are indeed origin stories that appear in many records (such as the Sumerian and Greek myths).  Perhaps he means that there are no records from the time the origin story is set in, whereas there are clear records that civilizations existed at the time of the Revelation.  This is not relevant, as there are no records (other than the Torah, whose authenticity is precisely what we are trying to prove) that the Revelation occurred.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A similar story appears in Joshua chapter 10, which states that the Sun stood still.  This miracle would have been witnessed by the whole world, and surely would appear in other records or traditions had it actually occurred.  Since it does not, this disproves Gottlieb's argument that such an event would have been remembered.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gottlieb responds by referring two three online articles, none of which are scholarly or peer reviewed.  In fact, two of his links are dead, and the third is a long rambling thing about Jesus.  He also says, \"We can argue that even so spectacular an event as the stopping of the sun would not necessarily be recorded.\"  He does not appear to realize that he's just conceded the point - if the stopping of the sun would not necessarily be recorded, then <em>many</em> such events may have not been recorded, thus completely shattering his remembrance argument.  He then attempts to shore up his argument by saying it would have recorded only by nations which attach historical or cultural significance to it, which is both weak and, I think, a form of the No True Scotsman fallacy.  He finally attempts to respond by questioning the record-keeping of ancient nations, which is both incomplete (since he doesn't provide any facts), and an example of Lack of Evidence fallacy.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Arguments from lack of corroborating evidence</strong></p>\n<p>The event of the Revelation, and all the details concerning it, are recorded in just a single source, the Torah.  There has yet to be found any corroborating evidence, whether records from other nations or archaeological remains.  Thus, there is, in effect, just a single witness, not a multitude.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>R' Gottlieb responds by saying that historical records from that period tend to record only the history of the nation writing it, and thus it is unsurprising that there is no corroborating evidence.  This is true, but misses the main point of the argument.  In addition, Gottlieb notes that many of the records of the time contain exaggerations and falsifications, without realizing that the exact same argument could be leveled against the Torah.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Straw-Man Fallacy Argument</strong></p>\n<p>Gottlieb is arguing against a Straw-Man, that is to say, he's inventing a weak position and the arguing against it.  However, he does not address the actual academic theories about the origin of the Torah.  Specifically, Gottlieb argues against a single person suddenly inventing the story, but the theories posit multiple people slowly evolving such a story.  We have many examples of this type of evolution of stories among ancient peoples, and thus it is not a stretch to posit that a similar evolution took place among the Jews.</p>\n<p>In addition, Gottlieb's presentation of the theories against which he's arguing is backwards.  The theories do <em>not</em> claim that first there was a story, based on which the people invented religious practices and rituals.  The theories claim that the rituals and practices came first, and the story was slowly invented to explain the rituals and practices.</p>\n<p>The invention and believability of such stories can be demonstrated from our own (Orthodox Judaism) history.  The traditional explanation for <em>Dreidels</em> on Chanuka is that the Jews in Roman times used to play them to hide the fact that they were learning Torah.  However, it has been well established that \"spinning tops\" started as a secular game in Europe, and a \"traditional\" explanation was later invented to authenticate and Judaize the practice.  (<a href=\"http://www.myjewishlearning.com/holidays/Jewish_Holidays/Hanukkah/At_Home/Dreidel.shtml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Source</a>)</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Argument from Lack of Multiple Traditions</strong></p>\n<p>Assume, as Gottlieb does, that there hundreds of thousands of witnesses to the Revelation.  Each witness, being human and thus subjective, would have had a slightly different experience at the Revelation.  More importantly, due to flaws in human memory and differing educational abilities, each one would have told a slightly different story to their children.  Even with periodic corrections, over time, this should have led to many different (but similar) versions of what occurred at Sinai, which should be represented either in our records or our tradition.  However, a <em>single</em> version of the events is recorded and universally believed by traditional Judaism.  This indicates, even given Gottlieb's assumptions, that at some point all the variant traditions were eradicated or forgotten, which raises serious issues on the integrity of both the parent-child tradition which Gottlieb bases his argument, and on the Torah, which records but a single version of the events, thereby eliminating the \"multitude of witnesses.\"</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Argument against the Logic presented by R' Gottleib</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What about the logical proofs offered by Gottlieb to explain Kuzari? These also wither under scrutiny. Let's look at Gottlieb's main syllogism:</p>\n<p>(1) Let E be a possible event: Why are we assuming that an event--any event--actually happened? Whether the event really happened is what we are trying to figure out! We also need to clarify the parameters of \"possible,\" as I don't grant automatically that a god appearing to the multitude is itself a possible event. Finally, notice how we begin here with an event, something empirical, but then move in #2 to something that could be empirical or subjective, and end up in #3 with a purely subjective belief. With every step, the reasoning takes us away from the empirical.</p>\n<p>(2) had it really occurred, would have left behind enormous, easily available evidence of its occurrence: What is meant by evidence? If I tell you something and you tell your brother, is your tale considered \"evidence\"? What's meant by \"enormous\" and \"easily available\"? I am not engaging in sophistry by asking that the vital terms of an important argument be made with the utmost clarity and specificity. I have little problem with the phrasing of the principle on its own, but when we apply the principle to Sinai, we need to have the key terms mapped unambiguously to details of the story. When we're talking about Sinai, the fact is that we don't have good evidence and we don't have enormous and easily available evidence. We basically now have only the Torah. If the only evidence is testimony and/or social memory, then the evidence is poor: it doesn't bring us to the truth of what the event might actually have been.</p>\n<p>(3) If the evidence does not exist, people will not believe that E occurred: This is ultimately the money statement of Kuzari, the assertion that people won't believe just anything. Some claims are so extraordinary that people will demand to see the evidence, the assertion says. In this way, Jewish belief is supposed to be proof of Jewish belief--hence, we go around in a circle. But the big flaw in much Kuzari-based reasoning on Sinai is the assumption that the story appears suddenly, as if the story itself were specially created by a god and placed in a culture that also was largely static. Claims evolve and societies evolve--both are dynamic.</p>\n<p>The evolutionary nature of both stories and societies thus undermines Kuzari's premises. This evolutionary development is extremely plausible and very well attested. I am not here proposing that a band of actual pre-Jews were stupefied before a real volcano (for instance), and that this event was the true and singular origin of the Torah's revelation story. Indeed, if Kuzari were right, then the Torah would the one and only instance in human history of a cultural text emerging fully formed and never, ever changing across the centuries. I am instead proposing that the existence of the Torah report and that the traditional Jewish interpretation are not and never were necessarily credible as evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Argument from Occam's Razor</strong></p>\n<p>Let's assume there were 600k Jews in the wilderness, and they witnessed some kind of great event there, with thunder and lightning and earthquakes and whatnot.  Claiming that they witnessed a miracle - Divine Revelation - which is entirely unique is the most extraordinary explanation one could give for such an experience.  It is far more likely they witnessed a natural event.</p>\n<p>In addition, contrary to Gottlieb's claims, it is far more likely for one to believe a mundane explanation than a fantastical one. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Argument against the integrity of our chain of tradition \\ Refutation via forgetting \"national unforgettables\"</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Nehamia, 8th Perek, it is clear that the Jews of the second temple era hear the torah for the first time in many many years, and weep because of their sense of loss.</p>\n<p>What happens next is amazing: They learn for the first time about Succos! Now, Succos is supposed to be a remembrance of the exodus.</p>\n<p>Moreover, it states clearly that Succos had not been observed since the days of Joshua ben Nun! Since he took over from Moshe, and I don't believe Moshe observed Succos, that would mean Succos had never been observed until the days of the second temple! (I could be wrong about Moshe not observing succos, but it wouldn't affect this refutation of the Kuzari, btw).</p>\n<p>Now, if they didn't remember the \"remembrance\", how exactly did they all collectively (from their \"bubbes and zaydes\") remember the Sinai experience itself?</p>\n<p>And another question, separate and apart from this (and there are lots of opinions that address this question in the gemara and the commentaries, so it is not my main refutation): why didn't the Jews remember <em>where</em> Sinai was?! That would seem to be an important place. The apologetic answer is because God didn't want them to worship the mountain itself. Why, then, do we essentially worship the temple mount and the kotel? Some say the temple mount was sinai. Some say, the location was lost during the initial dispersion.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Refutation by Demonstration of Circular Argument</strong></p>\n<p>How do we know that there were 600k witnesses to the Revelation in the first place (or any of the details, for that matter)?  From the records in Torah, the authenticity of which is precisely what we are trying to prove.  This a circular argument, for it assumes its own conclusions.</p>\n<p>If you claim that we know that there were 600k there via tradition, then why don't we know the other details via tradition, such as where Mt Sinai is, or the names of (y)our ancestors who were present, and presumably transmitted their testimony throughout the generations.  Fact of the matter is that the <em>only</em> details we know about the Revelation are those that are recorded in the Torah, making the integrity of our tradition on this issue very suspect, and leading to the logical conclusion that our only source is the Torah itself.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Sources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/works/SinaiArgument.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.dovidgottlieb.com/works/SinaiArgument.htm</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://larrytanner.blogspot.com/2010/07/definitively-refuting-kuzari-principle.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://larrytanner.blogspot.com/2010/07/definitively-refuting-kuzari-principle.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://offthederech.blogspot.com/2006/01/debunking-kuzari.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://offthederech.blogspot.com/2006/01/debunking-kuzari.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://www.talkreason.org/articles/letter1.cfm#15\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://www.talkreason.org/articles/letter1.cfm#15</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additional arguments and examples can be found at</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://bpelta.blogspot.com/2010/12/kuzari-principle-proof-from-mass.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://bpelta.blogspot.com/2010/12/kuzari-principle-proof-from-mass.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2006/02/demolishing-dumb-arguments-mass.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://dovbear.blogspot.com/2006/02/demolishing-dumb-arguments-mass.html</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"http://akivah.wordpress.com/essays/the-kuzari-principle/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">http://akivah.wordpress.com/essays/the-kuzari-principle/</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>For a comprehensive counter-argument, see the book <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1690831723\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Breaking the Kuzari\"</a>.</p>\n<p>For how they are addressed, Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has counter-counter-arguments <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xiM_rXbEj00FQSOrv9dOqOC-WQphDvyplvIiMgZc7WQ/edit?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in a Google Doc</a> that he shared on his blog.</p>\n<p>(Personally, I prefer Rabbi Shmuel Phillips's treatment in <a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/judaism-reclaimed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Judaism Reclaimed\"</a> (Chapter 28) as a counter-argument, which interprets the argument as less about a single event of mass revelation than about the plausibility of inventing a 40-year narrative so against the grain of surrounding polytheistic cultures.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>(Note: this answer does not <em>exactly</em> answer the question that was asked.

    "content": "# Nichush- Nichush or Divine Messages?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a question regarding the Torah prohibition of Nichush.</p>\n\n<p>It seems from the Rambam and halacha that signifying occurrences in life with an importance, what is termed hasghacha protis in certain situations, would violate this prohibition.</p>\n\n<p>Why is it not considered nichush in certain instances where religious people see occurrences in life as Divine messages?</p>\n\n<p>For example, there is a story about a couple that filed for divorce and got the <em>get</em>, but as it was being written or signed, coffee spilled on it and therefore the couple abrogated the divorce. The question of nichush was raised to HaRav Zilberstein shlita and I guess he said that it did not fall under the prohibition of nichush, because there seemed to be a logical connection to between the coffee spill and the writing of the get. (Now, I've only heard this, so I don't know the full veracity of the event.)</p>\n\n<p>But the Rambam gives, as an example of nichush, a person's not traveling on his journey because his staff fell (Hilchos Avodah Zarah 11:4). Wouldn't it also be a logical deduction to say that the staff, an item of travel falling, is a bad omen to continue traveling? So I don't understand where the distinction lies; I was wondering if you could help me understand that.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>The story you cite can be found <a href=\"http://www.hidabroot.org/ARDetail.asp?BlogID=112491\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>. Rabbi Zilberstein also discussed ניחוש in the second volume of his והערב נא, on לך לך.</p>\n\n<p>The prohibition against divination does not include a logical prediction based on science. So there's no prohibition for someone to decide to carry an umbrella based on the forecast. On the other hand, it would be a problem if he were to buy a heavy coat if a groundhog saw his shadow on February 2!</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, it's not considered divination if the person doesn't rely on the omen entirely. Eliezer didn't rely solely on the signs when he gave the gifts to Rivka. He had first inquired about her family. See <a href=\"http://www.torahmitzion.org/eng/resources/show.asp?id=719\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> for a brief treatment.</p>\n\n<p>Rabbi Zilberstein in the above cited והערב נא discusses a case of someone who was planning a trip. The money set aside for the plain ticket was kept in a drawer. The night before, a fire broke out in the apartment- and was extinguished. There was no damage, except to the very drawer in which the money was kept in. The individual inquired whether he should take this as a sign not to travel, or whether such concerns would be considered divination. Rabbi Zilberstein writes that in case of \"דבר של פלא\"- a wondrous occurrence, one can be concerned and not violate the prohibition of ניחוש. (This case can be read <a href=\"http://www.hidabroot.org/he/comment/reply/93218\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Now spilling a cup is not an unusual event. (In fact, someone just spilled a cup as I was typing!) But here, the event happened at the last possible moment. And it wasn't an event that was unconnected to the matter of the divorce (consider, in contrast, if a bird would have flown in through a window at that moment). The spilling had a direct effect on the divorce. At the very least, it would have delayed it by requiring the writing of a new גט. Arguably, one could say this was not some common omen, but a highly rare happening- a פלא.</p>\n\n<p>I will also make an assumption about this couple's circumstances. I doubt that this was a case where remaining married would have been madness- i.e. where there was abuse, etc. In a case like that, it's unlikely that the <strong>both</strong> parties would have paid attention to the omen and spend the rest of life in misery. That both the husband and wife were willing to stay married indicates that the marriage was worth salvaging. When they decided not to proceed with the divorce, they implicitly decided to spend more effort at repairing their relationship. (Of course, this is somewhat speculative, but I believe it to be very reasonable.) Thus, they didn't rely entirely on the sign when making their decision. </p>\n\n<p>Thus, this case had two aspects that would avoid the prohibition: it was a very rare bizarre occurrence, and the couple relied on other factors when they made their decision. Both these aspects are absent in the case of someone dropping a walking stick. (By the way, is it correct to translate מקל specifically as \"walking stick\" as oppose to a \"staff\" in general?)  </p>\n\n\n",

If you are washing for Tefillah because you may have touched a sweaty part of your body, there are opinions (Levush 4:18, Shulchan Aruch HaRav 128:27, others) that hold this creates a Ru'ach Ra'ah (evil spirit) and you would have to wash according to the level required for such, which is 3 times on each hand, switching off hands.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the cup discussion (in the comments), the Piskei Teshuva in Siman Daled cites the Shulchan Aruch as saying you should use a cup for washing for all Tefillos, but his citation is to 4:7, which is about washing in the morning, not washing for Tefillah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ramchal and Tzimtzum\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzimtzum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzimtzum</a> is a term said to be used in the teaching of Isaac Luria. It claims that God began the process of creation by \"contracting\" his infinite light in order to allow for a \"conceptual space\" in which finite and seemingly independent realms could exist. (Note that many interpretations of what the Tzimtzum is exists. See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/718/2699\">here</a>)</p>\n\n<p>Where, if he did at all, does the Ramchal give his interpretation of the Tzimtzum? I've come up empty with a Google Search. </p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>In the <strong>ספר הכללים</strong> which can be found in the back of most editions of דעת תבונות (and is the \"basis\" of Daas Tevunos), in siman ב, the Ramchal writes:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>הצמצום הוא מה שהאדון ב\"ה כבש כביכול חוק טובו בבריאת נבראיו, שלא לעשותם שלימים אפילו לפי ערכם, כל שכן לפי ערכו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Roughly translated:\n\"Tzimtzum is that which Hashem restricted the nature of His complete goodness in creating creations, to make them incomplete, not only according to Hashem's completeness, but even in their own level of completeness\"</p>\n\n<p>In the corresponding discussion in Da'as Tevunos siman כו, he explains this further:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>שהאלוק ב\"ה היה יכול ודאי לברוא האדם וכל הבריאה בתכלית השלימות. א\n  ולא עוד, אלא שמחוקו היה ראוי שיהיה כך, כי להיותו שלם בכל מיני שלימות - גם פעולותיו ראוי שתהיינה שלימות כבל שלימות. אלא שכאשר גזרה חכמתו להניח לאדם שישלים הוא את עצמו, ברא הבריות האלה חסרות השלימות. <strong>והרי זה כאילו עכב מדת שלימותו וטובו הגדול שלא לעשות כחק גדולתה בבריות האלה, אלא לעשותם האותה התכונה שרצה בה</strong> לפי התכלית המכוון במחשבתו הנשגבת</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(I bolded the part which most succinctly expresses it)</p>\n\n<p>Hashem really could have, and <em>should have</em>, created complete beings, as He is perfect and the nature of perfection is to produce perfection.  He \"limited\" Himself to complete imperfection, and it is <em>as if</em> He held back the degree of His perfection to create imperfection.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I think the passage YEZ quoted is the best passage. </p>\n\n<p>For additional material, the <a href=\"http://www.aspaklaria.info/090_TSADI/%D7%A6%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%9D.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">entry צמצום</a> in the encyclopedia <a href=\"http://www.aspaklaria.info/\" rel=\"nofollow\">אספקלריא</a> collects several more passages from the writings of the Ramhal on the topic.</p>\n\n<p>There are different aspects to the Tzimtzum for the Ramhal: there is the aspect of our existence not being perfect, as related in that passage quoted by YEZ; there is also an aspect of God choosing to act in a way that would allow the contemplation of human beings, rather than in a way that would be infinitely beyond us. Here is one passage from the encyclopedia entry (from the Ramhal's work <a href=\"http://www.hebrew.grimoar.cz/luzzato/kelalej_milchamot_mose.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">מלחמות משה</a>) that discusses that aspect of the Ramhal's interpretation of Tzimtzum:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>ראשית הכל הוא לדעת שבין בבריאת העולם בין בהנהגת הקב\"ה לא פעל בדרך כל\n  יכול, כמו שהוא באמת, אלא בדרך בני אדם שעושים הדברים מעט מעט, כן כל\n  המציאות עשאה ועושה אותה בהדרגה זאת. שאם היה פועל בדרך כל יכולתו לא\n  היינו יכולים לדבר כלום במעשיו, כי לא היתה לנו הבנה כלל בהם, ומפני שפעל\n  בהדרגה יש לנו מקום להתבונן בהם.</p>\n  \n  <p>וזהו הצמצום שאמרנו, שצמצם אין סוף את אורו, שלא רצה להכנס בענין בריאת\n  העולם בכל יכולתו אלא בדרך משוער, כי שתי דרכים למחשבה העליונה, דרך כל\n  יכולתו ודרך ההדרגה, והנה קודם שברא העולם לא היה צורך בדרך ההדרגה, אלא\n  כשרצה לברא העולם אז היה זמן שיתחלק הדרך הזה, ונמצא, שלא רצה שכל יכולתו\n  יכנס בבריאת העולם, אלא דרך הדרגה, הרי שצמצם כל יכולתו, שלא ליכנס בענין\n  זה, וקבע דרך ההדרגה, וחלקי הדרך הזה ומשפטיו הוא מה שאנו מבינים.</p>\n  \n  <p>הענין הזה במלים הידועות בין חכמי האמת, לכל יכולתו אנו קוראים אין סוף\n  ב\"ה, דהיינו הרצון העליון בשלמותו, ולדרך ההדרגה אנו קוראים ספירות,\n  נמצא, שהמאציל ית\"ש שהוא המצוי הראשון, צמצם את רצונו הכל יכול, וקבע דרך\n  ההדרגה, ולפיכך אנחנו אומרים שהאין סוף נתצמצם, ואז נגלו הספירות, מכאן\n  והלאה נדבר בספירות ובהדרגותיהם</p>\n  \n  <p>The first thing to know is that—whether in creating the world, whether\n  in guiding it—the Holy One did not act in the manner of omnipotence (which\n  would have been appropriate to his true nature) but rather in the\n  manner of human beings who do things bit by bit. So, He made and does\n  make all existence in this step-by-step way. For if he were to act in\n  the manner of his omnipotence, we would be unable to speak of his acts\n  at all, for we would have no understanding of them at all; but because\n  he acted step-by-step, we have an entry into the contemplation of them.</p>\n  \n  <p>And this is the Tzimtzum that we mentioned, that the There-Is-No-End\n  limited His light, for He did not want to enter into the matter of the\n  creation of the world in His omnipotence but rather in a measured way.\n  For the supernal thought has two ways, the way of His omnipotence and\n  the way of step-by-step. Before He created the world there was no need\n  for the way of step-by-step, but when He desired to create the world,\n  the time came to distinguish that way. So one finds that He did not\n  want His omnipotence to enter into the creation of the world, but\n  rather the manner of step-by-step; therefore, He limited His omnipotence,\n  so as not to enter in that way into this matter, and set the way of\n  step-by-step. And the parts of this [step-by-step] way, and its laws,\n  are what we understand.</p>\n  \n  <p>This topic in the vocabulary of the Kabbalists: His omnipotence is\n  referred to as אין סוף ב\"ה, i.e., the supernal will in its unlimitedness, and\n  the way of step-by-step is referred to as ספירות. So,\n  the Emanator, the first existent, limited His all-capable will, and\n  set himself the way of gradation; therefore we say that the אין סוף\n  limited itself and the ספירות were revealed; from that point on,\n  we speak of the ספירות and their processes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The most thorough treatment of tzimtzum in Ramchal that I have seen is in the first several chapters of his 138 gates of wisdom (klach pischei chochma) specifically chapters 24 and 25 (though each chapter builds on the next). </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://ramchal.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This blog</a> goes through each gate in great detail in English.</p>\n\n<p>This is a <a href=\"http://ramchal.wordpress.com/2011/08/15/how-ari-and-ramchal-depicted-the-tzimtzum/\" rel=\"nofollow\">good post to start with</a> </p>\n\n\n",

Like in a Yarmulke which refers to this fear.<em>*</em> </p>\n\n<p>Hopefully someone will be able to answer my questions.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The word can mean a covering in general, or a head-covering in particular. In the Concordance, I only found three places in תנ\"ך where the word appears in this form-</p>\n<p>For example, ישעיהו ט:יג (and repeated later in ישעיהו):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְזָנָב כִּפָּה וְאַגְמוֹן יוֹם אֶחָד</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15940#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad</a> translation, following Rashi translates it as \"arch\", and Artscroll translates it as \"canopy\".\nRashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לשון מלכים ושלטונים כפה ארקוול\"ר בלעז כלומר אותם החופפים עליהם ככיפה\nזו</p>\n<p>An expression denoting kings and sultans. כִּפָּה, arcum voltum,\narvolt in O.F. [an arch] i.e., those who hover over them like an\narch. <em>(Chabad translation)</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand, the מצודות (and the מלבי\"ם) relate the word to branch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצודת דוד-  השרים הדומים לענף יפה</p>\n<p>מצודת ציון- כן נקרא הענף כמו וכפתו\nלא רעננה (איוב טו:לב) לפי שהיא כפופה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This posuk in איוב is the other place where the word כיפה appears. Here's what Rashi writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כפיית ענפיו כל ענפי אילן דומין לכיפה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And here's what the מצודת ציון writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ענפיו כמו כפות תמרים (שם כג) ע\"ש שהמה כפופים</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we have here a close relationship between \"canopy/arch\", \"branch\" and \"bent\".</p>\n<p>Note that the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48231&pgnum=294\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ערוך</a> has an two entries for כפה, one meaning anything circular and the other referring to a covering. Of course, the ערוך is referring to the language of the גמרא, but I believe this reflects the relationship I mentioned above.</p>\n<p>Rashi uses the term arch, which is a semi-circular structure.This appears to follow from כפוף meaning bent- as opposed to straight. כף (as in כפות תמרים) means branch, which have a bent shape. (Indeed, \"arch\" derives from the Latin \"arcus\" meaning bow, which is both \"bent\" and a \"branch\"!) Also consider כף= spoon, which also has the same circular shape- see the <a href=\"http://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=48231&pgnum=285\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ערוך</a>. The letter כ itself is a semi-circle bent shape.</p>\n<p>In summary, kippa- a head-covering derives from the word in תנ\"ך that means canopy/arch/covering. That word is derived from branch/bent. While \"palm\" may be the ultimate etymology, the word כפה is not directly related to it, rather it follows from \"bent\" or \"branch\".</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>'Everything is in HaShem's hand, except the fear of heaven.'</p>\n\n<p>Maimonides said that this means that we have a free choice while some things are determined.

Beside this the laying of the hands upon one's head seems to have the meaning of 'representation' besides subjunction. The laying of the hands of Moshe on Yehoshua so that Yehoshua would resemble some caracteristics of Moshe, or the laying of hands on the Levites as a sign that they would handle in our name. We lay some weight on it. (think also about the children on Shabbat or offerings also). Maybe HaShem lays His hands upon us so that we represent Him, and act for him, that we give our life for him (as the offerings do for us), that we mat be as His children which are blessed by His Words that are laying like the yoke of heaven on our sholders to guide us like an ox is guided by it's yoke. Our heads guide our body maybe the Kipah symbolize that HaShem on it's turn guide our heads?</p>\n\n<p>It's just some thoughts that going on and on in my head.

Perhaps you could say the same thing here; Hashem places His \"hands\" on our \"heads\" to bring shefa to the world. </p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What afterlife awaits a Tinoq Shenishba who studies Torah but fails to observe major halacha?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rambam says that one who does not believe even one of the 13 principles of faith does not get into Olam HaBa.</p>\n\n<p>Here is my question: The same Rambam spoke about the concept of a Tinok shenishba bein hanachrim; supposedly this person is forgiven for not following the halacha. Supposing that person knows a lot of Jewish opinions (including Karaite and Christian opinions) and a lot about Torah, etc. and keeps studying them, but they continue to sin because it's convenient to remain as they are and they don't have enough evidence to change their whole lifestyle. Is there a chance they have stopped having the status of Tinok shenishba bein hanachrim and risk becoming an apikoros or kofer? Do they still get forgiven and admitted into Olam HaBa?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>The Rambam apparently believes that the <em>tinoq shenishba</em> is defined by the attitude he/she was raised with toward Torah, not only their ignorance of it. And so even after learning Torah, as long as his motivation was at least founded on the initial bias against believing its truth or applicability, the <em>tinoq shenishba</em> is not held to account.</p>\n<p>To quote the Rambam's Code, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Rebels.3.3?lang=he&layout=lines&sidebarLang=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhos Mamrim 3:1-3</a> (emphasis mine, tr. R' Zvi Lampel):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בַּמֶּה דְּבָרִים אֲמוּרִים בְּאִישׁ שֶׁכָּפַר בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה בְּמַחֲשַׁבְתּוֹ וּבִדְבָרִים שֶׁנִּרְאוּ לוֹ. וְהָלַךְ אַחַר דַּעְתּוֹ הַקַּלָּה וְאַחַר שְׁרִירוּת לִבּוֹ וְכוֹפֵר בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה תְּחִלָּה כְּצָדוֹק וּבַיְתּוֹס וְכֵן כָּל הַתּוֹעִים אַחֲרָיו. אֲבָל בְּנֵי הַתּוֹעִים הָאֵלֶּה וּבְנֵי בְּנֵיהֶם שֶׁהִדִּיחוּ אוֹתָם אֲבוֹתָם וְנוֹלְדוּ בֵּין הַקָּרָאִים וְגִדְּלוּ אוֹתָם עַל דַּעְתָּם. הֲרֵי הוּא כְּתִינוֹק שֶׁנִּשְׁבָּה בֵּינֵיהֶם וְגִדְּלוּהוּ וְאֵינוֹ זָרִיז לֶאֱחֹז בְּדַרְכֵי הַמִּצְוֹת שֶׁהֲרֵי הוּא כְּאָנוּס <strong>וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁשָּׁמַע אַחַר כָּךְ [שֶׁהוּא יְהוּדִי וְרָאָה הַיְהוּדִים וְדָתָם הֲרֵי הוּא כְּאָנוּס שֶׁהֲרֵי גִּדְּלוּהוּ עַל טָעוּתָם] כָּךְ אֵלּוּ שֶׁאָמַרְנוּ הָאוֹחֲזִים בְּדַרְכֵי אֲבוֹתָם הַקָּרָאִים שֶׁטָּעוּ.</strong> לְפִיכָךְ רָאוּי לְהַחְזִירָן בִּתְשׁוּבָה וּלְמָשְׁכָם בְּדִבְרֵי שָׁלוֹם עַד שֶׁיַּחְזְרוּ לְאֵיתָן הַתּוֹרָה:</p>\n<p>.... However, this is speaking solely of those who ... initiate such   denial, such as Tzadoq and Boethus. But the children and   grandchildren of these kinds of men, who were misled by their   fathers, that is, those who were born into and bred by the Qaraites,   are like people who while still young had been taken into captivity   and raised in another religion. Such captives are not quick to take    hold of the mitzvos, for their situation is prac­tically beyond   their control: <strong>Even if they later hear that they are Jewish and are    exposed to Jews and Judaism, they still are consi­dered people who   practice another religion only by force, since they were raised and   educated erroneously.</strong> The same is true with those who keep the ways   of their erroneous Karaite fathers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A <em>tinoq shenishba</em> is mentioned in the gemara (<a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.68b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 68a</a>) as a kind of <em>oneis</em> (someone who sins through no fault of his own); someone who never knew is less culpable than a <em>shogeig</em> (someone who sins because of forgetting). And thus, \"<em>oneis Rachamana patreih</em> -- the All-Merciful forgives the <em>oneis</em>\". (BQ 28b, AZ 54a, Nedarim 27b) Which is only logical. Someone who forgot is culpable to the extent that they should have taken the matter more seriously, then they could have remembered. But a <em>tinoq shenishba</em>'s attitude toward observance is a product of circumstance.</p>\n<p>And so, a <em>tinoq shenishba</em> would presumably not suffer for it in the afterlife.</p>\n<p>(In general, later sources describe one's fate in the afterlife in terms of one's progress in this world; not absolute accomplishment. While that's a broader topic, you question would fit as one example.)</p>\n<p>I therefore don't think you have to worry about part of your question. The Rambam would say there is no \"chance they have stopped having the status of <em>Tinok shenishba bein hanachrim</em> [nor] risk becoming an <em>apikoros</em> or <em>kofer</em>\".</p>\n<p><strong>However</strong>, you close with, \"Do they still get forgiven and admitted into Olam HaBa?\"</p>\n<p>This presumes the Rambam believes that admition into the World to Come depends on culpability. It can be argued either way. There are <strong>strong</strong> indications he sees one's place in the World to Come as having a cause-and-effect relationship to one's Knowledge.</p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"http://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah,_Repentance.8.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhos Teshuvah 8:1</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... וְזֶה שֶׁאָמְרוּ צַדִּיקִים יוֹשְׁבִין דֶּרֶךְ חִידָה אָמְרוּ. כְּלוֹמַר הַצַּדִּיקִים מְצוּיִין שָׁם בְּלֹא עָמָל וּבְלֹא יְגִיעָה. וְכֵן זֶה שֶׁאָמְרוּ עַטְרוֹתֵיהֶן בְּרָאשֵׁיהֶן כְּלוֹמַר דַּעַת שֶׁיָּדְעוּ שֶׁבִּגְלָלָהּ זָכוּ לְחַיֵּי הָעוֹלָם הַבָּא מְצוּיָה עִמָּהֶן וְהִיא הָעֲטָרָה שֶׁלָּהֶן...</p>\n<p>And that which [the Sages] said that the righteous sit [in the World to Come], they spoke in a metaphoric manner. As to say, the righteous are present there without work of effort. Similarly, that which they said \"their crowns on their heads\", so as to say, the knowledge which they knew because of which they merited to life of the World to Come is found with them and is their \"crown\"...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Or your quote from the opening of his list of 13 Iqarim [Articles of Faith].</p>\n<p>(Similarly, the Guide 3:18 describes knowledge as the key to being a \"person\" in the sense of getting <em>hashgachah peratis</em> [individual Divine Providence], prophecy is defined as the overflow of Knowledge from the Active Intellect to the prophet's intellect, the closing chapter calls Knowledge the highest human perfection, and so on.)</p>\n<p>If he means this causally, then someone who lacks the requisite Knowledge simply lacks what it takes to get a place in the World to Come. Whether it's their fault or not.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This question seems to assume that the status of <em>tinok shenishba</em> is relevant to whether or not one receives heavenly reward in general, and <em>olam haba</em> in particular.</p>\n\n<p>However, this system, in which one does not lose his share in the world to come if his beliefs are innocent or excusable, seems to be more of a description of the view of his famous disputant <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_ben_David\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ra'avad</a> (animadversion to Hilkhot Teshuva 3:7), and there is little indication that Rambam agrees, and much reason to assume that he disagrees. For example, in Moreh Nevukhim (1:36) he writes specifically that: </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If you think that there is an excuse for those who believe in the corporeality of God their training, their ignorance or their defective comprehension, you must make the same concession to the worshipers of idols...You will perhaps say that the literal interpretation of the Bible causes men to fall into that doubt...There is no excuse whatsoever for these people...</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The implication is that questions of fault are irrelevant; even an innocent mistake based on upbringing is nevertheless punished.</p>\n\n<p>Accordingly, someone with heretical beliefs against the principles would most probably be held accountable even if they feel they lack the evidence.</p>\n\n<p>It should also be noted that Rambam often emphasises that intellectual perfection and understanding are core components of entry to the world to come. (cf. <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1509.htm#4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Teshuva (9:4)</a>, <a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1509.htm#7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(9:7)</a>,  Moreh Nevukhim (3:27), (3:54)). He does not peg it on merit alone, but on the presence of certain traits. This is further understood in light of his description of the <em>olam haba</em> which is an intellectual bonding with God (<a href=\"http://mechon-mamre.org/i/1104.htm#16\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhot Teshuva 4:16</a>). One who lacks the basics of Jewish belief loses his share not just as a punishment, but as as an inevitable result of his inability to experience it.</p>\n\n<p>So yes, there is a very real chance that according to Rambam, in spite of upbringing one could be held at fault for heretical beliefs in contradistinction to Ra'avad's view (although some claim that Rambam would agree to Ra'avad which I don't find compelling, for reasons beyond the scope of this post).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>the Ramchal in the Path of the Just says (based on the talmud) that there is no remedy for the evil inclination besides torah study. without torah study, the evil inclination will rule over a person without his knowledge. based on that, it seems they are not blameworthy since they have not had a proper torah education.</p>\n\n\n",

From this we can understand that the gemarah’s story also contains an allusion to the middah of Hod which corresponds kabbalistically to the thigh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The interaction is between Dovid who represents kingship - malchus and Avigail who represents Hod.

However, everyone is already so used to the folio-daf system in the Vilna (Bomberg/Romm) edition that everyone uses those pages for a reference, and we wouldn't want to confuse everyone by having to re-paginate the Gemaras. Basically, the reason is merely that the Jewish people is an ancient people who don't like changing things. Is that a great reason? No, but that's how things are.  </p>\n\n<p>The Koren-Steinsaltz Gemaras that are being published in Hebrew contain these missing parts, and their Hebrew counterparts (the Hebrew Steinsaltz Gemaras) have added these censored passages. </p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The Moznayim, i.e. Vagshal prints have all the censored pieces put back, also of interest is Dikdukei Sofrim which has at least 4 ancient manuscripts predating the printing press standardised shaas. The reason not to put them back is because the Jews in Spain, Poland, Germany and countless other countries taught us a valuable lesson with their lives that no matter how good galus (exile) seems, it's still galus. I've actually read an antisemitic blog quoting translations of gemaras, mostly from Lubavitch websites, citing various censored pieces about Yashka, calling on his antisemite brothers to wake up about the truth of our feelings to their deity. He went on to mock us for foolishly thinking we are safe enough to print these things publicly. Very surreal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>See Chazon Ish (igros vol 3 michtav 2) who claims that no mistake can ever befall the unchangeable torah. if a change occurred it was heavenly divined and must be respected.\nI wonder if the Chazon Ish would claim a similar logic regarding the censors?!</p>\n\n\n",

But the model I saw does not run on electric power, but the lights automatically are powered by the action of the soda canister which is fed into the machine that carbonates the water. So I thought you could argue that since my ultimate desire is to carbonate the water (permitted by such authorities as Rabbi Auerbach and the author of Shmirat Shabbat K'Hilchoso) that the automatic LED display which lights up is a \"Davar She'eino Tzrichah Legufah\"...in other words, is a secondary act which happens not because I want it to happen but which is a result of my primary act which I do want to happen. Much like when you pass a house on Shabbat with security lights which will automatically go on once you go near and pass by the house, even though you do not wish them to go on, you could similarly argue here that the lights are not a necessary part of the desire for carbonated water, and therefore something which you cannot avoid,. and therefore could be permitted. </p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>If you don't need the light then it's permissible, because it's a psik reisha d'lo nicha le</p>\n\n\n",

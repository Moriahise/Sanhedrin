Mordechai\nSchwab,[22] others to R. Aharon Rokeach[23] or R. Michael Ber\nWeissmandl,[24] the teaching is generally brought without any\nattribution.[25] The teaching gained prominence in the 1980s, with the\npublication of Nosson Munk’s article in the March 1986 issue of the\nAmerican Orthodox magazine Jewish Observer as well as in two articles\nin the Israeli Charedi newspaper Yated Neʾeman (“The Faithful\nPeg”).[26]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See the footnotes in the article with expansive sources regarding the attribution to each of these Rabbanim - R' Mordechai Schwab, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aharon_Rokeach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Aharon Rokeach</a>, or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dov_Weissmandl\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Weissmandl</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Michael Ber Weissmandl (1903–1957) was famous both for his\nrescue efforts during the Holocaust, and his teachings based on what\nwould be later be termed Equidistant Letter Sequences (ELS), popularly\nknown as “Bible codes.” For this attribution, see Alexander Firestein,\nYalkut Divrei Assaf (Jerusalem: 2001), 46 [§16]; Moshe Menachem\nLudmir, Yagdil Torah – Megillat Esther (Jerusalem: 2013), 75; R.\nEliezer Ginzburg, Ginzei Hamelech on Megillat Esther (Brooklyn: 2000),\n152, who says that “people say (אומרים)” it in the name of R.\nWeissmandl; Chaim Alexander Neiman, “Leika Midi d’Lo Remiza b’Orayta”\n[Wondrous Hints Regarding Events in the Holocaust Years], Or Yisrael\n29 (Tishrei 5763/Sept 2002), 217.

Weissmandl’s writings, and was first attributed to him in 2002.\nNevertheless, R. Chaim Alexander Neiman wrote that Weissmandl taught\nhim the Purim Code directly, saying that it was his idea</strong>. While the\nNuremberg teaching is not itself an example of ELS, it is often\nmentioned in the context of other “Bible codes,” and viewed as part of\nthat genre.

    "content": "# Are there exceptions to pass exams during Passover?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Context: in France, access to some elite schools is done through an extremely competitive exam that takes place nationally for everyone at the same time. To take part, students go through two years of total devotion to learning (it is insane).<br />\nThis is to say that this exam is the final stage of two years of \"no life\" and you have one shot.</p>\n<p>I heard that a friend of a friend of my son is Jewish and the exam this year falls around the 15 to 29 of April, and that this matches an important Jewish celebration. When I <a href=\"https://icalendrier.fr/religion/fetes-juives/pessah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">had a look at the dates</a> it seems this is Passover.</p>\n<p>He will not be able to take part in the exams because of (again, this is the recollection I got) a strict interdiction of working at that time.</p>\n<p>If this is indeed the case: do you have a mechanism to get an exception for such a unique case?</p>\n<p>I was curious about that because as much as \"normal\" work can stop, there are still medics, firefighters, and workers in places where you cannot just stop the company (metallurgy for instance) - so they must somehow have exceptions. Wouldn't they apply to cases where skipping work voids years of preparation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Passover is comprised of two types of days. Days of the festival, on which there are no exceptions - writing for exams is absolutely forbidden - and intermediate days, on which it is only customary not to work or write and exceptions can be made.</p>\n<p>The intermediate days are the 4 middle days in Passover. This year (2024), passover is on the 23-30 of April. So the night of the 22nd, the entire 23rd, and the 24th until nightfall are part of the festival, as well as the night of the 28th, the entire 29th, and the 30th until nightfall, so no exceptions can be made during those specific times.</p>\n<p>It's also worth noting that any Friday night to Saturday night is equally forbidden, which some universities forget when trying to figure out the complex pattern of Jewish holidays for accommodation purposes.</p>\n\n\n",

[See Lehoros Nassan (Vol 2, Siman 89) who ruled on a paternity case where the husband was considered medically infertile.]</p>\n<p>Additionally, DNA paternity testing may not be halachically accepted to determine <em>mamzerus</em>. Besides for a skepticism to rely solely on newly discovered technology [grounds for skepticism in the scientific method is beyond the scope of this answer], even poskim who would rely on DNA testing in some areas of <em>halacha</em> (eg <em>agunos</em>) posit that they would not determine <em>mamzerus</em> with DNA testing. Also noteworthy, with the advancement of IVF and other fertility treatments, even a reliably negative paternity test would not be evidence of <em>mamzerus</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

In effect it's like leasing out your property for rent. You earn a time dependent reward for the use of your property. The IRS has ruled tokens are NOT currency and NOT securities for tax purposes. They are property.\nAlso, it seems clear there is no other party paying you these awards. They are generated from the community as whole, the blockchain in total. In addition, their payment increases the total tokens available so if every single holder of this token staked their tokens for the same amount of time they would each get a proportionate to holding number of new tokens. This is like a stock split in the security world. There is no overall accretion to wealth. The fact that only some token holders stake, means they earn the award but it's like if a stock offers to split but only for those who apply. It's still a split, not a payment for the use of the stock.\nThats my understanding.</p>\n\n\n",

However, there would be feedback from the hearing aids that can affect the sleep of everyone else. I’ve never been frum, but I was curious about this. I accidentally left a hearing aid on but took it out before a dinner (left it on a counter), and everyone else was going crazy trying to figure out what the annoying sound was. Without the hearing aids, it would be hard to connect and fully participate in Shabbat. With the hearing aids, you might affect everyone else’s sanity/Shabbat.

    "content": "# Why did Mordecai save Achashverosh?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is known that Achashverosh was an evil king and encouraged Haman to kill the Jews in exchange for making money. Moreover,he made a feast for the Jews with the temple vessels. If so, why did Mordechai save Achashverosh and pass on the information that Bigthan and Teresh wanted to kill him? After all, this could have been an excellent opportunity to change the monarchy and perhaps get a king who is good for the Jews? And perhaps because Achashverosh remained on his throne, every issue of the decree of Haman was dragged out and the Jews needed a miracle, and in the way that Bigthan and Teresh were successful in their way, could all the decrees of King Achashverosh have been avoided?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This question is addressed in Rabbi Yosef Deutsch's <em><a href=\"https://www.artscroll.com/Books/9781578197828.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Let My Nation Live</a></em> p.47:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mordechai could, of course, have pretended he had never heard the plotters, allowing them to carry out their plot and kill Achashverosh. Esther would then have been free to return home. But he decided to thwart the plot. If the plotters succeeded, he reasoned, the Jewish chief advisor would be blamed for the lax security. If it were discovered that Esther was Jewish, there would be suspicions of a conspiracy between her and Mordechai. In either case, a chillul Hashem, a desecration of the Name, would result. On the other hand, by speaking up he would make a kiddush Hashem, sanctifying the Name. He would bring honor to the Jewish people and gain royal favor for the reconstruction of the Beis Hamikdash.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, he believed in his heart that Hashem had let him learn about the plot so that he should expose it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.1053.29-32?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni</a>; Midrash Panim Acheirim; Me'am Loez.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Mordecai behave towards Haman in this way?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Haman was enraged at Mordechai's behavior, according to Megilat Esther he investigated his people and directed his hatred and revenge towards Mordecai to all of Mordecai's people, that is, to the Jews. It turns out that the spark for Haman's behavior and the desire to harm the jews began with Mordechai's behavior. Is it permissible to behave as Mordechai did towards Haman and thereby endanger the Jews?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The back story behind the relationship between Mordechai and Haman is found in Sefer Yosifun by Yosef ben Gurion.</p>\n<p>On the face of it, Mordechai's slight seems insignificant. And in truth, Mordechai did not honor Haman because of the idol hanging from Haman's neck.</p>\n<p>But Yosef ben Gurion explains that Modechai specifically, who was a prominent descendant of the tribe of Benyamin was especially hated by Haman, who was a descendant from Amalek.</p>\n<p>That when Saul HaMelech sent his soldiers to attack the Amalekites in Gaza, the specific leadership of the mission was given to the soldiers from the tribe of Benyamin.</p>\n<p>That these soldiers didn't simply defeat the Amalekite soldiers, the men, they killed everyone they came across, including women and children. That this was in keeping with the same type of treatment that happened with Moshe and Yehoshua.</p>\n<p>In the eyes of Haman, Mordechai, a descendant of the tribe that massacred his people deserved a special level of hatred.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As the Lubavitcher Rebbe explains, Mordechai's refusal was a declaration of Jewish eternity. He could not bow, because bowing meant surrendering the Jewish soul to darkness. And THAT would have been the real danger.  Mordechai’s refusal wasn’t what caused the decree—it was what ultimately saved the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe says: “A Jew who stands strong in his identity—even when it seems risky—is what brings salvation. Compromise, not conviction, is the danger.”  It is precisely when Jews stand proud, even under threat, that redemption begins; Mordechai knew this. His stance was not reckless; it was strategic faith.</p>\n\n\n",

That <em>seemingly unnecessary repetitions</em> appear in order to bring new meaning. It happened in the days of Ahasuerus; <em><strong>He</strong></em> is Ahasuerus, <em><strong>The King</strong></em> (The Ruler).</p>\n<p>That <strong>ה֣וּא</strong> is referring to G-d above the level of all names, as  in:</p>\n<p>הקדוש ברוך <strong>הוא</strong> (<em>The Holy One</em>, blessed be <em><strong>He</strong></em>) or like the response upon hearing one of G-d's names in a blessing ברוך <strong>הוא</strong> וברוך שמו (Blessed be <em><strong>He</strong></em> and blessed is <em>His name</em>) and also like the phrase יהוה <strong>הוא</strong> האלהים (The L-rd is <em><strong>He</strong></em>, the (<em>one called</em>) G-d) which is said at the close of Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>This actually follows the paradigm concerning names that is established in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.19?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 2:19</a>, that names are only a vessel (כלי), a tool with which to connect to the actual thing associated with it (מהות). See the comments of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.19?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.19?lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> for more details.</p>\n<p>In this context, it also addresses the surprising fact that <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/purim/article_cdo/aid/849741/jewish/Why-Isnt-Gds-Name-Mentioned-in-the-Megillah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">G-d's names do not appear anywhere in the entire Megillat Esther</a>. Unlike the rest of the Tanach, there is no explicit mention of G-d even once!</p>\n<p>But in that context, it begs the question, what is being emphasized by saying that this transcendent level of G-d that is even beyond his explicit names, relates to Ahasuerus אחשורוש? Who or what is indicated by this name אחשורוש in Megillat Esther and what are we being taught?</p>\n<p>In Hebrew, another general concept is that words are built upon 2, 3 and 4 letter roots generally. When encountering a word with more than 4 letters, it indicates a compound word. The name being applied to this ruler, אחשורוש, contains 7 letters. One of the more obvious word compounds from this is: אח״ש ורו״ש.</p>\n<p>This suggests another common grammatical tool used in Hebrew, that of Notarikon. That <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34968&st=&pgnum=19\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אח״ש</a> ו<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=34968&st=&pgnum=239\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">רו״ש</a> stands for: אגב חרפה שבושה-רצוא ושוב.</p>\n<p>That the beginning of Creation introduced a paradigm of <strong>Ratzoo v'Shuv</strong>, <em><strong>Running from</strong></em> (<em>or toward</em>) and <em><strong>Returning to</strong></em> (<em>or from</em>). And an incidental consequence (בדרך אגב), (<em>perhaps even unintentional consequence</em> see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.6.6?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bereshit 6:6</a>) of the institution of this paradigm of <strong>Ratzoo v'Shuv</strong> within Creation is the existence of the negative qualities associated with <em>disgrace and shame</em> (חרפה שבושה) which include all the negative and contradictory qualities that you enumerate for Ahasuerus and that don't seem to apply to G-d.</p>\n<p>And this is emphasized even more by referring to <em><strong>The Ruler (the King)</strong></em>, with the indicative form of the letter Heh <strong>הַמֹּלֵךְ֙</strong>. It refers to <em>The Ruler</em>, the King of the Universe, that in Megillat Esther, He (<em>the King of the Universe</em>) is referred to in a concealed and hidden way (as in הסתר פניו), without his explicit, known names.</p>\n<p>And in truth, G-d is the source of everything, both the good and <em>what appears to us</em> as the opposite of good like is said in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Ashkenaz%2C_Shabbat%2C_Shacharit%2C_Blessings_of_the_Shema%2C_Barchu.2?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%A2%D7%A9%D7%94&with=Tanakh&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yotzer prayer following Barchu on Shabbat morning</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלהֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעולָם. יוצֵר אור וּבורֵא חשֶׁךְ. עשה שָׁלום <strong>וּבורֵא אֶת הַכּל:</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Blessed are you, L-rd our G-d, King of the Universe, (who) forms light and creates darkness, makes peace (which also has a connotation of <em>completeness</em> or <em>Ganze Weltanschauung</em>) and <em><strong>creates everything</strong></em> (literally: the whole).</p>\n<p>There are not two Kings.

The debate centers around the order of occurrence between a white hair and a leprous spot. If the white hair precedes the leprous spot, the spot is considered impure. Conversely, if the spot appears before the white hair, the hair is deemed impure. In this uncertain situation, the text mentions that the Holy One, blessed be He, declared it pure. Different opinions are presented, with some considering the spot impure and some expressing uncertainty.</p>\n<p>Rabba bar Nachmani is mentioned in connection with this debate, stating that he is unique concerning plagues and tents, possibly referring to his expertise in matters related to impurity and the laws of purification.</p>\n<p>The passage then refers to another discussion in the Gemara, this time in the tractate Nazir. It explains the reason behind the ruling of purity in the previous scenario. The verse \"to pronounce him clean or unclean\" is mentioned, indicating that the scripture begins with purity first, and this is cited as the basis for the ruling.</p>\n<p>The text emphasizes the need to understand the significance of the conditions and the scholars mentioned in these discussions. It acknowledges the tremendous wonders and miracles performed by certain individuals, such as Rabbi Pinchas ben Yair.

It explains that the term \"holy\" refers to the aspect of the Crown (Keter) and that sometimes the aspect of beauty in Atzilut (the World of Emanation) is also referred to as \"holy.\" The connection between Tiferet (Beauty) and the Crown is explored, emphasizing their interrelation and the concept of glorification.</p>\n<p>The text suggests that through the illumination of the Crown, a greater revelation of the Infinite (Ein Sof) is achieved compared to the attributes of Chesed (Kindness), Gevurah (Severity), and Tiferet. It further discusses the integration of these attributes and the role of the Crown in completing this process.</p>\n<p>The passage concludes by stating that the Crown is called holy because it transcends the limitations of the chain of descent, and the Holy One, blessed be He, is associated with both the aspect of the Crown (Keter) and Wisdom (Chochmah), which represents the beginning of the chain of descent and revelation.</p>\n<p>Some snippets:</p>\n<p>בגמרא דב\"מ פרק הפועלים קא מפלגי במתיבתא דרקיע אם בהרת קודמת לשער לבן טמא ואם שער לבן קודםלבהרת טהור ספק הקב\"ה אמר טהור וכולהו מתיבתא דרקיע אמרי טמא ואמרי מאן נוכח. נוכח רבה בר נחמני דאמר רבה בר נחמני אני יחיד בנגעים אני יחיד באהלות כו' עד אמר טהור טהור, ובגמ' במסכת נזיר (דס\"ה ע\"ב) פי' הטעם דאמר קרא לטהרו או לטמאו הואיל ופתח בו הכתוב בטהרה תחלה (והובא בהר\"ש ספ\"ד דנגעים). וצריך להבין ענין התנאים ואמוראים שאנו רואים\n...</p>\n<p>והנה לתוספת ביאור בענין קוב\"ה אומר טהור י\"ל עפמ\"ש בזהר פ' בא דל\"ו ע\"ב בשעתא דקוב\"ה אתחזי על גנתא כו' עד ולא מתפרש מעדן. נמצא שהתגלו' זו הוא מבחי' עדן שהוא בחי' חכמה וכתר משא\"כ השגת המתיבתא דרקיעא בעצמם בג\"ע הוא נמשך מבחי' בינה דאצי' שהיא בחי' רקיע העליון כו'. אבל בחי' הגילוי דקב\"ה אתי לאשתעשע עם צדיקייא בג\"ע זהו הגילוי מלמעלה מעלה מבחי' בינה. ועמ\"ש ע\"פ באתי לגני כו' וע\"פ הזהר בפ' בראשית דכ\"ז ע\"ב אעשה לו עזר בענין מעלת גילוי זה דקב\"ה אתי כו'. וזהו ג\"כ כענין המבואר במ\"א ע\"פ ויהי קול מעל לרקיע. דפי' קול ר\"ל המשכה וגילוי מלמעלה מבחי' הרקיע והפרסא והוא מבחי' סכ\"ע. וכך ענין גילוי זה היא מלמעלה משרש השגת המתיבתא דרקיע ששרש השגתם מבחי' רקיע העליון דבינה. אבל המשכה זו מבחי' עדן זהו מעל לרקיע כו' וכ\"ז נמשך להם ע\"י שבעסק תורתם בהיום לעשותם המשיכו ג\"כ מבחי' כתר עליון מבחי' סוכ\"ע ועי\"ז זוכים ג\"כ בג\"ע לגילוי הארה זו להיות קב\"ה אתי לאשתעשעא כו'\n..\n{See <a href=\"https://chabadlibrary.org/books/4001380176\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://chabadlibrary.org/books/4001380176</a> and on for the full answer}</p>\n\n\n",

One example of such a system would be equipment that logs if the fire goes out and turns back on.

    "content": "# Where do the rabbis get the Noahide Law prohibiting the consumption of the meat from a living animal: \"ever min hachai\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At first, this may seem obvious. The source is Genesis 9:4 -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Only flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Put in other words -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But you must not eat meat with its lifeblood [still] in it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But note that the phrase, \"ever min hachai\" is not found in this Torah passage. The verse says -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַךְ־בָּשָׂ֕ר בְּנַפְשׁ֥וֹ דָמ֖וֹ לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even more interesting, is that it actually means something different. By a simple reading of the verse, this command is kept if the blood of the is removed from the meat. The best way to accomplish this is kosher slaughter, cutting the arteries and pouring the blood on the ground. Noah knew about clean and unclean animals and had just offered a sacrifice. So it wouldn't even be a stretch to suggest the verse is talking about draining the blood from *an animal before eating it.</p>\n<p>\"Ever min hachai\" takes the meaning of the verse in a completely different direction, specifically prohibiting consumption of meat removed from a live animal.</p>\n<p>So where does this law the rabbis include in the Noahide Laws come from? Was this law formed in such a way as to address a specific pagan practice they wanted to discourage?</p>\n<p>*<strong>I originally wrote \"...it wouldn't even be a stretch to suggest the verse is talking about draining the blood from a /-kosher-/ animal before eating it.\" This is INCORRECT. It is crystal clear in the previous verse that God permitted Noah to eat ALL living things. I was reflecting on God's pleasure with Noah's offering and had been researching kosher slaughter, and tried to make a connection that wasn't there. I wanted to leave the \"kosher\" in there and strike it through, but I couldn't figure out how to do it.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The verse literally means “Even Flesh—in its life, its blood, do not eat”.</p>\n<p>The focus of the phrase “in its life its blood” is the word “life”. The word “blood” modifies the word “life”, <em>not</em> vice versa. Therefore, the primary intent of the verse is that one shouldn’t eat from a living animal.</p>\n<p>A consequence of this is that the flesh a living animal is forbidden to gentiles, because it contains \"blood of life\". On the other hand, blood from a <em>dead</em> animal is just plain blood with no attachment to life, and thus the flesh of a dead animal is completely permitted for gentiles to consume. Whatever connection there was between the blood and the life has obviously been severed, because the animal is dead. Plain and simple.</p>\n<p>The verse mentions consumption of the flesh, not of the blood. The blood is what makes the <em>flesh</em> permitted or forbidden; the blood isn’t forbidden itself.</p>\n<p>Leviticus 7:26 holds a different commandment, namely to refrain from consuming blood in general, directed specifically at Jews. Thus, Jews can't even eat the blood of a dead animal.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>So where does this law the rabbis include in the Noahide Laws come from?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.102a?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 102a</a> in the Mishnah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(דברים יב, כג) לא תאכל הנפש עם הבשר ר' יהודה ור' אלעזר סברי כל שאתה מצווה על דמו אתה מצווה על אבריו והני טמאין נמי הואיל ואתה מצווה על דמן אתה מצווה על אברין</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehuda and Rabbi Elazar hold that with regard to any animal whose blood you are commanded not to eat, you are commanded with regard to its limbs, i.e., you are prohibited from eating its limbs that were severed while it was still alive. Consequently, with regard to these non-kosher species also, since you are commanded not to eat their blood, you are commanded with regard to their limbs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p>Was this law formed in such a way as to address a specific pagan practice they wanted to discourage?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not that I'm aware of.  <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_live_animals#Judaism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a> lists some examples of people eating live animals, but none of them are traditional religious practices.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not a Rabbi. The answer is my own opinion but my opinion is based on studying scholarly works about ancient Israelite blood rituals, especially book: <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0801879930\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Blood Ritual in the Hebrew Bible</a>..</p>\n<p>I believe Rabbis get the Noahide law from Genesis 9:4</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אַךְ־בָּשָׂ֕ר בְּנַפְשׁ֥וֹ דָמ֖וֹ לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think we as modern readers translate this a bit incorrectly because we are too far removed from the times these laws were given and we expect only one meaning. Therefore we translate this in English as just:</p>\n<p>\"But flesh, with its soul in its blood, do not eat.\"</p>\n<p>This reads like one commandment, and most people read this verse and conclude that blood is a symbol for life. But it is my opinion that the Bible makes a stronger claim: <em>blood <strong>is</strong> life</em>.</p>\n<p>One of many examples is the blood of Abel cries out to God, because the blood is still life even after Abel is dead. The Nile was turned into blood because of the Israelite children who had been drown there and had been dead for decades. And there are various other scriptures that say life is in the blood, which we should take to mean blood is life, because it's made of life.</p>\n<p>So I argue that an ancient Israelite would translate the verse as:</p>\n<p>\"Do not eat flesh that still has its soul\"</p>\n<p>And so there are two commandments here:</p>\n<p>Do not eat flesh that still has its soul in its lifeblood. If you rip a limb off a living animal the soul remains in the flesh until the animal dies, therefore you cannot tear / remove flesh off a living animal to eat it.</p>\n<p>And do not eat flesh with it's lifeblood still in it. Which is where we get the idea of kosher slaughter and draining of the blood.</p>\n\n\n",

Could they be subject to the rule of <em>bishul yisrael</em>, that foods which can only be eaten cooked and are served as a standalone item at a royal banquet, have to be cooked by Jews? I think peanut butter fails on most of those criteria pretty easily.</p>\n<p>So we have two reasons why something would need a hechsher: there's a Talmudic law inherently requiring one, or we're just concerned about the way it's made in 2024. A good way to determine between those two categories is to search for \"peanut butter\" in the <a href=\"https://www.kosher.org.uk/koshersearch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">London Beth Din's Kosher Search</a> (of course, this only applies to products sold in the United Kingdom).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some peanut butters are determined \"not kosher.\" Presumably they are processed on lines that also do not-kosher, or may include not-kosher additives.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Some are \"<a href=\"https://www.kosher.org.uk/article/what-difference-between-products-are-kosher-certified-klbd-and-those-are-kosher-approved\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">approved, though not certified.</a>\" The contemporary British rabbis did their homework about how they are made, and concluded it should be fine.

The Gemara discusses the issue of <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Techum\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">walking outside of the <em>techum</em></a>. The Gemara discusses whether there is an issue of <em>techum</em> above 10 tefachim from ground level.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בעי רב חנניא יש תחומין למעלה מעשרה או אין תחומין למעלה מעשרה... אי נמי דקאזיל בקפיצה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara explains that the question is regarding to 'flying' in the airspace above 10 tefachim.

The Gemara dismisses this, stating that it was not Eliyahu Hanavi but Yosef the Demon, who didn't observe Shabbos.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הני שב שמעתא דאיתאמרן בצפר' בשבתא קמיה דרב חסדא בסורא בהדי פניא בשבתא\nקמיה דרבא בפומבדיתא, מאן אמרינהו - לאו אליהו אמרינהו? אלמא אין תחומין\nלמעלה מעשרה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is clear from the Gemara that flying - at least at a height of higher than 10 tefachim - would transgress Shabbos.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<h2>Does Batman need permission from Beit Din to act as a police man?</h2>\n<p>Although regarding Mitzva Enforcement (Kesuvos 85a) only a Beis Din is authorized (at least according to Ramban Parshas Yisro), when it comes to ensuring compliance and withholding violations of Negative Commandments, the Gemara (Baba Kama 28a) is clear that any layman may use violence even without authorization from Beis Din. (The Ketzos Hachoshen and Nesivos HaMishpat (CM 3) argue about this point, see also Meshovav where Ketzos defends himself from the Nesivos' arguments).</p>\n<p>However, regarding civil disputes, only a Beis Din is authorized to rule.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>Question:</p>\n<p>In the bustling metropolis of Gotham City, where the shadows danced with the secrets of the night, Rivka emerged as a symbol of justice, cloaked in the guise of Batman. Her vigilance knew no bounds as she prowled the streets, her keen intellect matched only by her unwavering determination.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, across the vast expanse of space and time, Yaacov soared through the skies like a celestial being, his noble heart ablaze with the fire of righteousness. As Superman, he epitomized the ideals of hope and strength, his powers a beacon of light in a world shrouded in darkness.</p>\n<p>But amidst their valiant deeds, questions arose, swirling like whispers in the wind. What laws governed the actions of these extraordinary beings? Was the path of the superhero a righteous one, sanctioned by the laws of Torah?</p>\n<p>In the halls of the Beit Din, scholars deliberated, their voices echoing through the chambers of wisdom. Was it permissible for a hero to soar through the heavens on Shabbat, or did such feats defy the sanctity of the day? Did the mantle of justice require the blessings of the righteous, or could one stand alone against the tide of injustice?</p>\n<p>As the Bat-Signal pierced the night sky and the city cried out for salvation, these questions weighed heavily upon the hearts of the righteous. Was it bittul zman to combat crime on the streets, or did each act of heroism bring the world one step closer to redemption?</p>\n<p>And what of Batman's arsenal of gadgets, forged in the fires of necessity? Were they permissible tools in the pursuit of justice, or did their use on Shabbat risk the delicate balance between life and law?</p>\n<p>As the dawn broke over the horizon, casting its golden rays upon the city below, the answers remained elusive, hidden within the tapestry of tradition and law. Yet, amidst the uncertainty, one truth remained clear: the path of the superhero was one fraught with peril and sacrifice, yet illuminated by the eternal light of justice and righteousness.</p>\n<p>Answers:</p>\n<p>In traditional Jewish law, the prohibition against carrying on Shabbat is based on the act of transferring an object from one domain to another. However, this prohibition does not apply to living beings, as they naturally carry themselves wherever they go. This principle is deeply rooted in halacha and forms the basis for various Shabbat laws.</p>\n<p>When considering the act of flying on Shabbat, whether through supernatural abilities or advanced technology, it raises intriguing questions regarding this principle. Since flying involves the movement of one's own body through the air, akin to walking or running, it may be argued that it falls under the category of \"a living creature carries itself\" and is therefore permissible on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>However, the application of this principle to flying is not straightforward. While it may seem intuitive to view flying as a natural extension of one's own movement, there are nuances to consider. Flying entails a level of control and elevation that surpasses typical modes of terrestrial locomotion, potentially complicating its classification within traditional halachic categories.</p>\n<p>As such, the permissibility of flying on Shabbat requires careful analysis and interpretation within the framework of Jewish law. Halachic authorities may differ in their assessments, weighing factors such as the nature of the flight, its purpose, and its potential impact on Shabbat observance.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the question of whether flying is permissible on Shabbat is subject to interpretation and debate within the halachic community. Seeking guidance from knowledgeable rabbinic authorities who are well-versed in both Jewish law and contemporary issues is essential in navigating this complex terrain and arriving at informed decisions that uphold the sanctity of Shabbat while addressing the realities of modern life.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Flying on Shabbat:</strong> The permissibility of flying on Shabbat hinges on the interpretation of halachic principles regarding carrying and self-transportation. While the concept of \"a living creature carries itself\" suggests that flying might be permissible, it's essential to consult with halachic experts to determine whether flying falls within the parameters of permissible activity on Shabbat.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Permission from Beit Din:</strong> Seeking guidance or approval from a Beit Din can provide moral and ethical clarity for superheroes. While the pursuit of justice is noble, superheroes should strive to operate within established legal frameworks whenever possible, aligning their actions with Jewish law and ethical principles.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Bittul Zman:</strong> Engaging in crime-fighting activities raises questions about the prioritization of time and resources. While combating injustice is commendable, superheroes should ensure that their efforts do not detract from more spiritually meaningful pursuits. Balancing worldly responsibilities with spiritual growth is essential in living a fulfilling Jewish life.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Using Equipment on Shabbat:</strong> The use of specialized equipment, such as Batman's gadgets, on Shabbat must be evaluated based on halachic principles. While saving lives justifies temporary deviations from Shabbat norms, superheroes should exercise caution and consult with halachic authorities to ensure that their actions align with Jewish law and ethical considerations.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Shabbos Taxi:</strong> Once the immediate danger has passed, superheroes should prioritize returning home in accordance with Shabbat observance. Arranging transportation that complies with halachic guidelines demonstrates a commitment to upholding the sanctity of Shabbat while fulfilling the imperative of public safety.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In navigating the complexities of superheroism within the framework of Jewish law, seeking guidance from knowledgeable halachic authorities is crucial. By aligning their actions with Torah principles, superheroes can fulfill their mission of combating injustice while upholding the values of justice, righteousness, and compassion.</p>\n\n\n",

Rem\"a: Today people clap and dance and we do not stop them because it is better that they sin unintentionally . . . There are those who say that today, everything is permitted because we are not proficient in the fixing of instruments, so there is no reason to make decrees preventing the fixing of instruments, as this skill is not pervasive.

    "content": "# Bal tosif on mishloach manos\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If someone gives mishloach manos on the day before or after Purim, does he violate bal tosif?</p>\n<p>Does it make a difference that the day after Purim is Shushan Purim, or for a Shushanite (or more commonly, a Jerusalemite) that the day before is regular Purim?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The question is based on the assumption that performing a mitzvah outside of its specified timeframe [with the intent of fulfilling the mitzvah] is a prohibition of <em><a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2015/07/20/bal-tosif-adding-to-torah-law-what-is-wrong-and-when/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">bal tosif</a></em>, as stated in gemara (Rosh Hashana 28) that one who sits in the <em>sukkah</em> after <em>sukkos</em> transgresses <em>bal tosif</em>.</p>\n<p>I can think of two reasons why <em>mishloach manos</em> would be different, and therefore one would not transgress the prohibition of <em>bal tosif</em> by performing it outside of the specified time frame.</p>\n<p>Firstly, there is an incredible <em>chiddush</em> in the responsa of the Sridei Aish (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yechiel_Yaakov_Weinberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yechiel Yaakov Weinberg</a>). He rules (V1 Siman 81) that one fulfils the <em>mitzvah</em> of <em>mishloach manos</em> the entire year around. Although the <strong>obligation</strong> is only on <em>purim</em>, there is still a fulfillment of the <em>mitzvah</em> at any point in the year.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cn53q.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/cn53q.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Accordingly, it would not only be permitted, but praiseworthy to give <em>mishloach manos</em> at any other time of the year.</p>\n<p>Secondly, R' Moshe Feinstein (Igros Moshe OC Vol 2, Siman 60) and the Chazon Ish (reported by students) suggested that when an action is a mitzvah, and during specific times constitutes a different mitzvah, there is no issue of <em>baal tosif</em> when performing the mitzvah with intention to do the second mitzvah even outside of the timeframe.</p>\n<p>For example, if one says Krias Shema after the <em>sof zman</em> with the intention to fulfil the daily obligation to recite Krias Shema, he does not transgress <em>bal tosif</em>. Since reciting Krias Shema even outside of it's allotted time is always <em>talmud torah</em>, even if one intends on fulfilling Krias Shema, there is no prohibition.</p>\n<p>[It is noteworthy that the Chafetz Chaim disagreed with this ruling, and felt that saying Krias Shema after <em>sof zman</em> could potentially be prohibited]</p>\n<p>Therefore, since giving a gift that is <em>marbeh rei'us</em> would be a <em>mitzvah</em> all year round, there would be no prohibition at all, even if performing <em>lsheim mishloach manos</em>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1z6Ff.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/1z6Ff.png\" alt=\"אגרות משה\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Meir_Teomim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Megadim</a> in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40464&st=&pgnum=8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">introduction 1:40</a> when discussing adding to ner Chanukah, suggests that according to Tosfos there’s no Bal Tosif if you do the mitzvah more times, and according to those who argue with that, there’s no Bal Tosif on a drabbanan.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.664.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MB 664:22</a> says that outside of the time for the mitzvah, one only violates bal tosif if they have specific intention to do the mitzvah.</p>\n\n\n",

Some of these opinions are collected here in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/856/do-we-really-have-free-choice/114432#114432\">this excellent answer by Alex</a>.</p>\n<p>My question is simple- do any of these or similarly-founded opinions explain that Hashem really did \"change His mind\", because our free will was at play?</p>\n<p>E.g. maybe Hashem really was planning to make the world out of justice, but when He saw our free will choices, He saw that it wouldn't work, and changed to a world of mercy.

If we even are meant to. What do the Torah sources say is our job regarding this? Should we change their mind by talking to them, putting forth arguments, use social media and the like? Or do we ignore them completely, and instead focus on our relationship with Hashem; Torah and <em>mitzvot</em>, <em>teshuva</em> and <em>tefilla</em>, being the ultimate source of our problems in the world?</p>\n<p>Sometimes, it seems impossible, either because the lies they believe have produced a hate so impenetrable and a cynicism so mind-closing, that it boggles the mind, or these people are, or influence, policy makers and it rapidly goes way beyond our capabilities to do anything about it (seemingly). It doesn't help that Hashem has planned history so we have very little with which to prove empirically that we were taken out of Egypt, stood at Sinai and were chosen etc.</p>\n<p>So, for the sake of our mental health, I think it would be good to have a solid answer to this, that also answers all the satellite questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If it's true that hatred of Jews is a supernatural force that is caused by our sins, then what is the ultimate destiny of non-Jews? Sure, there are going to be many who are righteous, and have a place in Olam Haba, but what about the rest? Are they really just NPCs? How do we integrate the fact that some of them hate us because we do indeed sin and they do indeed rightly oppose that?</li>\n<li>If it's our responsibility to deal with changing the perceptions of non-Jews directly, then why is it so seemingly impossible, and what about all the strong sources that say the opposite? Is there any practical advice on how to do this? I have no idea what on earth I or anyone can do to fix Twitter/X, for example!</li>\n<li>Do we presume this is the end of days (as we have for 500+ years now), and how does that modify the answer?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> How do we change the minds of our haters (if we even are supposed to, but if not, what is our response)?

Is he trying to imply something else? To the best of my knowledge Rashi almost never mentions that specific language anywhere else, except for a few more times in the Book of Ester, like <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16475/jewish/Chapter-2.htm/showrashi/true#v5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibid 2:5:</a></p>\n<p>אִישׁ יְמִינִי: מִבִּנְיָמִין הָיָה, כַּךְ פְּשׁוּטוֹ. <strong>וְרַבּוֹתֵינוּ דָרְשׁוּ מַה שֶׁדָּרְשׁוּ:</strong></p>\n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16475/jewish/Chapter-2.htm/showrashi/true#v9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibid :9</a>:</p>\n<p>הָרְאֻיוֹת לָתֶת לָהּ: לְשָׁרְתָהּ, וְכֵן עוֹשִׂין לְכֻלָּן. וְרַבּוֹתֵינוּ דָרְשׁוּ מַה שֶּׁדָּרְשׁוּ:</p>\n<p>And the same question would apply there, why tell us that the Rabbis expounded other meanings without telling us what those meanings are? He could just say nothing/stop after his own explanation.</p>\n<p>Why did he say it?</p>\n<p>Any references to commentaries or Sichos would help</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Rashi famously only channels a specific kind of midrash, and will omit others if it doesn't also work well on a peshat level. He discusses this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.8?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">on Bereishit 3:8</a>, with hearing Hashem walking in the garden:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וישמעו AND THEY HEARD — There are many Midrashic explanations and our Teachers have already collected them in their appropriate places in Genesis Rabbah and in other Midrashim. I, however, am only concerned with the plain sense of Scripture and with such Agadoth that explain the words of Scripture in a manner that fits in with them. וישמעו AND THEY HEARD — What did they hear? They heard the sound of the Holy One, blessed be He, as He walked in the garden (see Genesis Rabbah 19:12).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that Rashi doesn't mention the details of the many midrashim he is omitting.</p>\n<p>Similarly, at the start of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9874#showrashi=true\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beshalach</a> (see <a href=\"https://parsha.blogspot.com/2016/01/beshalach-five-midrashim-rashi-doesnt.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">my analysis</a> of what is being omitted), that Hashem didn't take them derech eretz Plishtim ki karov hu, Rashi writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>for it was near</strong>: and it was easy to return by that road to Egypt. There are also many aggadic midrashim [regarding this].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and does not mentioned what exactly these aggadic midrashim said.</p>\n<p>Where Rashi <em>does</em> quote what the Sages say, this may well indicate that while he does not consider it the straightforward peshat, it is a midrash that operates well with the peshat and advances a peshat-oriented idea. So, saying that it was old wine, older that each person drinking it, advancing the idea of how splendorous the party was.</p>\n<p>In terms of the two \"shonot\", the ideas are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>These  were the Temple vessels, and a bat kol called out chastising them for using them \"again\", after the early ones were destroyed for using them. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.12a.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 12a</a>.)</li>\n<li>Their laws are different, in that they work to differentiate themselves from us. They won't eat our food, marry our women, or marry their women off to us. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.13b.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillah 13b</a>.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Apparently, these midrashim are too far removed from the peshat, or don't advance the singular peshat-derash thread that Rashi is trying to cultivate. He still mentions it exists, because that helps us know he is deviating what Chazal say, and that what Chazal say is midrashic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>He means there's a famous Midrash about it, but he doesn't necessarily see that as the simple explanation (or at least critical to the basic narrative). \"What about the midrashic reading? Yeah, there's that too.\" In this case, as Shmosel graciously pointed out, Megillah 12a says that they were looted Temple vessels.</p>\n<p>Another example would be <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.16.21?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judges 16:21</a>; the Philistines capture Samsons and make him \"grind.\" Rashi says -- \"working hard, grinding [wheat] at the millstone.\" And the Sages said ... what they said ... as the Talmud in Sotah reads \"grind\" in a um ... less-rated-G way.</p>\n\n\n",

The Tur eventually seems to conclude like the Shulchan Aruch, that it's actually okay to make matzas mitzvah earlier, only the minhag is to do it Erev Pesach.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh_HaRav%2C_Orach_Chayim.458.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch Harav</a> also makes it clear that that was the \"minhag of all Israel\", even in his time, says it should not be varied, and goes on and on about details of the minhag.</p>\n<p>No one of these suggests you don't need to bother. And yet it seems to be very rare; one local Rav told me that even if he had time, he wouldn't do it: \"The only ones doing it these days are Chassidische Rebbes.\"</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.458.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah there</a> suggests a possible reason for this: Though we poskin that chometz can have bitul until Pesach itself begins, there are poskim who hold that it is assur b'mashehu from the time that it becomes assur, Erev Pesach afternoon. Thus it is inherently more risky to try and make matzah then, just as the custom is not to make matzah on Pesach itself.</p>\n<p>Okay! So the question is, What customs are around now? Are there communities (or other individuals) that try to follow this <em>explicit halacha in the Shulchan Aruch</em>? Are other reasons given why some do not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When I asked this question to several Rabbanim, both Asheknazi and Sepharadi, I couldn't find anyone who follows this practice in a public way. Even amongst many Sepharadim bakeries they make matzot days/weeks before and freeze.</p>\n<p>I believe in either sefer Minhagei Mitzrayim or another book of Egyptian Halakha they mention most people make days before, but they have local non Jewish bakeries bake the matzah based on Rashi. But there are some who are careful to bake themselves (i believe by renting space/time at the bakery) to make their own matzah erev Pesah. But this custom was before the expulsion of the Jews from Egypt.</p>\n<p>I believe there's a completely valid reason for this custom to no longer be so prevalent. The Shulchan Arukh is only discussing soft matzah, and the thing about soft matzah is it does not last. After a day or two it becomes so rock solid it's basically inedible. So Jews a few hundred years ago all the way back to Sinai would make fresh soft matzot very close to the time you wanted to eat it. So for the seder, people would bake a few hours before to make sure the matzah was fresh and soft. But they knew they'd probably need to bake a new batch for the next day as whatever was cooked before might be inedible the next day.</p>\n<p>But now that we have freezers, soft matzah can be made days or weeks before and frozen. And Ashkenazim now have a custom to make matzah with very little water which creates a dry shelf stable matzah that can be made days or even months before the seder.</p>\n<p>I personally make a set of matzot right in accordance with the custom mentioned in the shulchan arukh erev Pesah for my personal seder. I have also met Iraqi Jews who do this practice privately in their homes as well. And I was honored that a congregant from a conservative synagogue that I taught to make matzah has now taken upon themselves the custom of making matzah a few hours before the seder. But all of these examples are a private practice, whereas the Shulchan Arukh is mentioning a public custom.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather than Abraham being addressed by David as \"my lord,\" they see the singer as addressing David in this fashion. According to Rabbi Singer:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The central purpose of the composition of this sacred work [is] for the\nLevites to sing them in the Temple.

Accordingly, the Levites would sing aloud:</p>\n<p><em>The Lord [God] said to my master [King David] “Sit thou at my right\nhand…”</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above interpretation understands the psalm to have been written in praise of David (\"about\" David) rather that by him.</p>\n\n\n",

every place where is says that so-and-so is so-and-so, if he was evil, he was evil from the start to the end, and if he was good, he was good from the start to the end, it's possible that here since he changed his ways in the end and did good for Israel because of Esther and for this did not say at the end \"even to half of the kingdom\", but rather simply \"what is your wish?\" in a manner that allowed inclusion of the construction of the Temple, as we shall clarify BS\"D, and for this reason the [author of the Megillah] tied the beginning of the book with its end [by] saying \"and a full account of the greatness to which the king advanced Mordechai\" and this is why Achashverosh in This World (he) is Achashverosh in the World-to-Come, \"and a full account of the greatness to which the king advanced Mordechai\" to announce that he shall receive a share in the World-to-Come, for a king who did what he did to his people, and did not stop there but also raised a Jew to the rank above all of his ministers is a great thing, and so [the narrator of the Megillah] noted that even with all of that, this bad thing occurred in the time of Achashverosh.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, to summarize, Rabbi Saba suggests that because Achashverosh changed his ways in the end and helped the Jews, he should be considered an exception to the rule that someone whose name is doubled and did evil was evil his entire life.

Most say it counts as learning and thus even if you  don't understand every word or meaning you still get reward for learning. Prayer implies understanding the prayer. Others disagree and say the words themselves have the power of prayer and when coupled with your thinking you can achieve your heart's desire.\nPersonally, I think that if the power of the words being recited is what is effective, then even if the meaning has no bearing on the Noahide, but his/her recitation is sincere in seeking to create Holiness, praise Hashem, bring his soul closer to Hashem, etc., then I don't see why he cannot recite in sincerity and with focus on bringing Holiness to this mundane plane.\nIf cites are needed, I can find them.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hashgacha question - why does Hashem influence the nations to chastise us, in order for us to do Teshuva?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>What is the explanation that in many cases the Tanakh speaks about nations (e.g. Aram) that Hashem sends to chastise the Jewish nation? It implies that Hashem is able to influence pagan nations, but raises the question that why Hashem didn't influence the Jews to repent instead of sending pagan nations? In order to cause an impact on non-Jewish nations as well? In which manner does He influence foreign nations? Can it be considered as a kind of Hashgacha in order to cause a change in that nation's consciousness?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Hashem's entire focus is on Israel, not the nations. This is for everyone's good. When it was clear that the nations were not going to do Teshuva, Hashem, in His mercy, stopped focussing on them, so that He wouldn't find cause to destroy the world (Chesed LeAvraham Maayan 1), and chose Israel to continue His plan and purpose. He saw that the nation of Israel were worth the investment, and through Israel, the rest of the nations could eventually be redeemed (Isaiah 52-53).</p>\n<p>Secondly, if, when you say \"why didn't He influence the Jews to repent\", you mean that Hashem should in some way force them to repent (say, through miracle or some other free-will canceling means), then that defeats the purpose of creation. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/132827/31534\">The world must do teshuva <em>freely</em></a>. If you just mean, to create pressure, or some other indirect, free-will-preserving influence, then He does indeed do that as well. For example:</p>\n<p>He sends us Prophets to come and call for us to do teshuva, such as Yirmiyahu, Amos, Hoshea.</p>\n<p>He causes suffering that are meant to be wake-up calls (Berachot 5a):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a person sees that suffering is coming upon them, they should examine their deeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hashem has many ways, and we know that He personally runs, down to the finest of detail, the lives of Israel (see Derech Hashem 2), and He is always devising means to save (Shmuel 2:14:14, see Arizal's comments on that in Shaar Hagilgulim).</p>\n<p>Why does He sometimes send pagan nations to be the \"teshuva influencers\"? This is generally part of the curses given in Ki Tavo, about how when we are not keeping the mitzvot, the nations will rule over us (see the berachot given to Esav and Yaacov). Some Kabbalistic explanations are also relevant.</p>\n<p>For example, HaRav Mendel Kessin Shlita explains that now that Hashem's focus is not on the nations, they have no connection to Him, and don't get their shefa directly from Him, but instead get it from Esav's angel. The angel also doesn't get shefa from Hashem directly, but except through the sins of Israel, so effectively, we empower the nations against us when we sin!</p>\n<p>In what manner does He influence the nations? See this passage from Chagiga 13b for an example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The verse states: “And I looked and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire flashing up, so that a brightness was round about it; and out of its midst was like the color of electrum, out of the midst of the fire” (Ezekiel 1:4). The Gemara poses a question: Where did that wind go? Rav Yehuda said that Rav said: It went to conquer the entire world under the wicked Nebuchadnezzar. And why was all of this necessary? Why was it necessary that the entire world be subjected to his dominion? So that the nations of the world would not say: The Holy One, Blessed be He, delivered His children into the hands of a lowly nation. Since it was already decreed that the kingdom of Israel would fall into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, God made him into a great conqueror, so that Israel would not be ashamed of being defeated by him. The Holy One, Blessed be He, said with regard to this: Who caused Me to be an attendant to worshippers of molten images, forcing Me to wage their wars? It was the sins of Israel that led Me to do so.

He is spoken of as \"Avichayil.\" This Avichayil would have to be brothers with Ya'ir, Mordechai's father, if we see Mordechai as a paternal cousin. I guess he could have married in if Mordechai has a sister so that would make him a brother in law.</p>\n<p>But what is known about him? What is his personal identity? If he is brother to Ya'ir then his father is Shim'i and he gets traced back with Mordechai. If he is a brother in law then the text isn't detailing his ancestors but Esther's through her mother (and cousin Mordechai).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיותו גדול בעמו ואבי כל חיל המדו׳ טובו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but these are qualities that would become apparent well after he was named so this might be more of a label than a given name. The mention of him at exactly this point is discussed by the Malbim who says that here is appropriate because the section is discussing <strong>her</strong> positive traits and she got those specific traits from her father's side</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצד תולדותה מאביה הצדיק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So this takes for granted a knowledge of Avichayil as a person of exemplary personal characteristics but there is no source for that that I can find. The Malbim does not try to make this connection in 9:29.</p>\n<p>There seem to be many more generations who are named in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Aggadah_on_Esther%2C_Midrash_Panim_Acherim%2C_Version_II.2.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medrash</a> but other than a couple of name explanations (which also seem to reflect behavior as an adult, not a name given to an infant) there is no explanation for Avichayil.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.9.29?lang=bi&with=Alshich&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Alshich</a> on 9:29 writes that Avichayil was a tzaddik and that's why the salvation miracle came through Esther but I don't know of any source for this claim about him (is this just a reverse label based on the end result, that she did merit the salvation and his name is listed here, therefore post hoc muct be propter hoc). The Nachal Eshkol <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.9.29?lang=bi&with=Nachal%20Eshkol&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">there</a> mentions the incredible z'chut of Avichayil and references the gemara but I don't know which gemara and a quick search did not found the name Avichayil in Shas Bavli (though maybe it was spelled differently so anyone who can recheck, that would be great).</p>\n<p>The Ohr Chadash on 2:15 tries to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.2.15?lang=bi&with=Ohr%20Chadash&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explain</a> why, specifically Avichayil is mentioned in those two instances, and explains that \"שהיה איש חשוב ובעל שם\" asserting importance with no proof except that he was named.</p>\n<p>Is there any actual text which connects him to a known Avichayil or which gives any information to help understand more detail about</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer is that this is an application of a general rule of interpretation, taught in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.15a.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maseches Megillah</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּמַתְנִיתָא תָּנָא: כׇּל שֶׁמַּעֲשָׂיו וּמַעֲשֵׂה אֲבוֹתָיו סְתוּמִין, וּפָרַט לְךָ הַכָּתוּב בְּאֶחָד מֵהֶן לְשֶׁבַח, כְּגוֹן: ״דְּבַר ה׳ אֲשֶׁר הָיָה אֶל צְפַנְיָה בֶּן כּוּשִׁי בֶן גְּדַלְיָה״ — בְּיָדוּעַ שֶׁהוּא צַדִּיק בֶּן צַדִּיק. וְכֹל שֶׁפָּרַט לְךָ הַכָּתוּב בְּאֶחָד מֵהֶן לִגְנַאי, כְּגוֹן: ״וַיְהִי בַּחֹדֶשׁ הַשְּׁבִיעִי בָּא יִשְׁמָעֵאל בֶּן נְתַנְיָה בֶּן אֱלִישָׁמָע״ — בְּיָדוּעַ שֶׁהוּא רָשָׁע בֶּן רָשָׁע.<br />\nIt was taught in a baraita: With regard to anyone whose actions and the actions of his ancestors are obscured and not explained, and the verse mentioned one of them favorably, for example, the way in which Zephaniah the prophet is introduced: “The word of the Lord which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah” (Zephaniah 1:1), it is known that not only was he a righteous man, he was also the son of a righteous man. And conversely, whenever the verse mentioned one of them unfavorably, for example, in the verse that introduces Ishmael as the one who killed Gedaliah, which states: “And it came to pass in the seventh month that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama” (Jeremiah 41:1), it is known that not only was he a wicked man, he was also the son of a wicked man.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So since we don't know anything about Avichayil, and we know his daughter was righteous, he must be righteous too. This makes sense, because if his being her father was not relevant to the story, why would it be mentioned? It makes more sense that his character influenced Esther to be righteous herself.</p>\n\n\n",

Also the Mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.8.9?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 8:9</a> states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to one who says: I will sin and then I will repent, I will sin and I will repent, Heaven does not provide him the opportunity to repent, and he will remain a sinner all his days. With regard to one who says: I will sin and Yom Kippur will atone for my sins, Yom Kippur does not atone for his sins. Furthermore, for transgressions between a person and God, Yom Kippur atones; however, for transgressions between a person and another, Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases the other person. Similarly, Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya taught that point from the verse: “From all your sins you shall be cleansed before the Lord” (Leviticus 16:30). For transgressions between a person and God, Yom Kippur atones; however, for transgressions between a person and another, Yom Kippur does not atone until he appeases the other person. In conclusion, Rabbi Akiva said: How fortunate are you, Israel; before Whom are you purified, and Who purifies you? It is your Father in Heaven, as it is stated: “And I will sprinkle purifying water upon you, and you shall be purified” (Ezekiel 36:25). And it says: “The ritual bath of Israel is God” (Jeremiah 17:13). Just as a ritual bath purifies the impure, so too, the Holy One, Blessed be He, purifies Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What about repenting with the intention to time travel back before that repentance and transgress?</p>\n<h1>This question is <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purim_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Purim Torah</a> and is not intended to be taken completely seriously.

If he then has relations with her, is it considered shogeg (and thus requires a korban chatas)? Or do we say that he should have done at least some due diligence (e.g. ascertained when she went to the mikva) before taking her word - and if so what is the amount of due diligence needed, and how can it be quantified? [Again this has practical ramifications of requiring a korban or not]. Is believing her in good faith without having reason to doubt her enough for the action to be deemed unintentional, or are there cases when that's not the case?</p>\n<p>As another example, what are the parameters involved in trusting a kashrut certifying agency before eating let's say something that can be potentially chametz on Pesach - if one believed the agency in good faith, would eating something that was in fact chametz be considered unintentional?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam writes (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/torah-texts/1062903/Mishneh-Torah-Rambam/Sefer-Korbanot/Shegagot/Shegagot-Chapter-2#v8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hil.

Dispensation for such war is subject to approval of the Sanhedrin and acquiescence of the urim ve-tumim. Acquiescence of the urim ve-tumim is tantamount to explicit divine sanction</strong>. Positing this requirement implies recognition that war may be undertaken only upon divine behest. Divine sanction for war in limited situations may be forthcoming even when there exists no imminent threat. Accordingly, it may be understood that it is not economic gain per se, or territorial aggrandizement or enhancement of the prestige of the monarch which justifies war; rather any cogent benefit may serve as justification, subject to divine approval as conveyed through the intermediacy of the urim ve-tumim. Hence, prevention of a possible, albeit remote, danger is no less worthy a motive than economic gain. Therefore, according to the Sages, preemptive war is encompassed within the category of milḥemet reshut but participation in such warfare fails to constitute a mizvah. However, R. Judah's view, which raises such participation to the level of fulfillment of a mizvah, but not to that of ḥovah or a mandatory undertaking, requires further clarification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>As an addendum it is worth referring to the footnote no.42 there which notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Cf., however R.

Four amos is equivalent to 6 feet according to Rav Chaim Noeh, 7 feet 1 inch according to Rav Moshe Feinstein, and 7 feet 7 inches according to the Chazon Ish.

According to the Chamudei Daniel, a walk-in closet is required to have a mezuzah. Other Poskim disagree with the Chamudei Daniel, and the Chazon Ish is quoted as having said that one may be lenient and not concerned about the chumrah of the Chamudei Daniel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>It serves as a connecting room to a larger area</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Reb Akiva Eiger suggests a different reason as to why this walk-in closet requires a mezuzah. He points out that the doorway of the walk-in closet connects two areas, the area of the walk-in closet and the area of the larger room to which the closet is attached. Even though the walk-in closet may have a floor area of less than 16 square amos, the room to which the closet is attached has a floor area of more than 16 square amos. <strong>Reb Akiva Eiger says that the doorway does not require a mezuzah due to the closet, but it does require one due to the larger room</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, for different reasons, the Chamudei Daniel and Reb Akiva Eiger both agree that the doorway of a walk-in closet with a floor area of less than 16 square amos requires a mezuzah. However, there is a significant difference between these opinions. According to the Chamudei Daniel, the mezuzah should be affixed to the doorpost on the right side when walking from the larger room into the closet, and it should be positioned slanting towards the closet. However, according to Reb Akiva Eiger, it is the larger room that necessitates the mezuzah which should be affixed on the right side when walking from the closet into the room (the left side when walking from the room into the closet); it should be positioned slanting towards the room.</p>\n<p>Other Poskim disagree with Reb Akiva Eiger and pasken that the larger room does not necessitate a mezuzah on the doorway of the closet. Rabbi Heinemann, shlit”a, paskens that one should be choshesh for the opinion of Reb Akiva Eiger and affix a mezuzah without a bracha to the doorway of a walk-in closet with a floor area that is less than 16 square amos. The mezuzah should be attached to the left side when walking from the room into the closet. If the floor area of the walk-in closet is so small that one does not actually walk into it when retrieving objects from the closet, then the doorway of the closet does not require a mezuzah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

See <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parashah#cite_note-wayedabber-26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this lengthy footnote</a> to the English Wikipedia article on פרשיות פתוחות וסתומות which gives some good background on the issue.</p>\n<p>A briefer subset of that footnote is the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ashkenazic and Sephardic Torah scrolls lack an open portion at 7:22 (וידבר... דבר... כל חלב) while Yemenite scrolls have one. Conversely, Yemenite scrolls lack an open portion at 7:28 (וידבר... דבר... המקריב) while Ashkenazic and Sephardic scrolls have one. This situation derives from Maimonides' ambiguous formulation in Laws of Tefillin, Mezuzah and Torah Scrolls, chapter 8.........However, there are actually two places where this is found (Leviticus 7:22 and 7:28), and it is unclear which of them Maimonides was referring to.........How this formulation by Maimonides accords with the Aleppo Codex has been discussed at length by.......Furthermore, all other Tiberian masoretic manuscripts have parashot in both places.

Rabbi Neḥemya said: You have rendered the sacred profane; rather, “he will stand before kings,” this is the King of kings, the Holy One blessed be He, as it is stated: “He was there with the Lord forty days” (Exodus 34:28). “He will not stand before dark ones,” this is Pharaoh, as it is stated: “There was a thick darkness [in the entire land of Egypt]” (Exodus 10:22). (Pharaoh is referred to as dark because his land became dark. Alternatively, the reference is due to the fact that Moses announced that he would no longer come to see Pharaoh after the plague of darkness (see Exodus 10:29)).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The plot of the megilla is similar to the events on Mt. Sinai which created a union of G-d and Jewish people. Yet, metaphorically the meeting was overshadowed by the fact that the bride was not ready hinting to the event of the Golden calf.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>G-d willing, this answer will be expanded.</p>\n\n\n",

Some say: One who was standing in prayer when he felt the need to sneeze from below, retreats four cubits, sneezes, waits until the odor dissipates and resumes praying. And before resuming his prayer, he says: Master of the universe, You have formed us with many orifices and cavities; our disgrace and shame in life are clear and evident before You, as is our destiny with maggots and worms, and so we should not be judged harshly. And he resumes his prayer from where he stopped.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Rambam in Hilchot Teffilah and Birkat Kohanim 4:12 paskens like this:</strong></p>\n<p>\"One who desires to pass gas from below and is bothered exceedingly, to the extent that he cannot restrain himself, should walk back four cubits, [expel the gas], and then wait until the gas subsides. He should say:\nMaster of all the world, You created us with many orifices and ducts. Our shame and disgrace is apparent and known before You. Shame and disgrace during our life, worm-eaten and decaying in our death. He then returns to his place and prays.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Shulchan Aruch OC 103:2 says:</strong></p>\n<p>If one had an urge to pass gas from below and is in a lot of discomfort and can't contain oneself, one walks 4 cubits back and passes the gas, waits until the smell dissipates from one, and then says \"Master of the world, You created us with many holes and cavities; It is revealed and known before You our disgrace and shame, disgrace and shame in our life, worm and maggot in our death.\", and then goes back to one's place and goes back to the place one left off.<br />\n<strong>Rema:</strong> And see above in Siman 85. There are those who say that all this is [referring to] when one is praying in one's home, but when praying with the congregation, where there would be a great embarrassment for oneself [if one were to do as described above], one does not need to distance oneself at all backwards, and one also shouldn't say the \"Master [of the worlds]...\" [prayer that was mentioned above], rather one should just wait until the smell dissipates from one. And such is how we practice.

The Midrash says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>These are the garments of Adam the first man, that were similar to the common rue, broad at the bottom and narrow at the top.<br />\nRabbi Yitzḥak Ravya says: They were as smooth as a fingernail and as pretty as jewels. Rabbi Yitzḥak said: It was like the thin linen garments that come from Beit She’an. [And they were called] garments of hide because they adhered to the skin. Rabbi Elazar said: Goat hides. Rabbi Aivu said: Garments that cover the skin. Rabbi Yehoshua ben Levi said: Hare hides. Rabbi Yosei bar Ḥanina said: Hides with their wool. Rabbi Shimon ben Lakish said: Radiant hides. And the firstborn sons would use them. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman said: They were camel wool and hare wool. [And they were called] “garments of hide” because they were garments that come from hide.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, according to the Midrash, the garment could have been made of the skin of:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>(Goat) Hides</li>\n<li>Hare Hides</li>\n<li>Hides with their wool</li>\n<li>Camel wool</li>\n<li>Hare wool</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.21?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> for another opinion:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתנות עור, the term כתונת is familiar to us from the outer garment\nmade for Joseph by his father, and the linen tunic worn by the High\nPriest, was intended to cover their bodies and their flesh, as\ndescribed in Job 5,5, the extremities of their bodies, as opposed to\nthe torso. The point is that the material was not taken from the body\nof a large mammal that had died, as there had not been time as yet for\nsuch skin to have been stretched to make it into leather. Compare\nOnkelos. According to some opinions the material stemmed from the\nLeviathan, the female of which G-d had killed and whose meat had been\nsalted away by G-d for use to serve to the righteous in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rabbeinu Bahya <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.3.21.1-2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps this leather was made from the animal called Tachash which the Jewish people used as a covering for the Tabernacle in the desert .</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the many meforshim, the tunic was leather (hide). There are different opinions, though, but this seems to be a re-occuring explanation.</p>\n\n\n",

This (usually) makes the person tahor, even though he is now completely covered by the nega.<br />\nI was surprised to see the Tosefos in Niddah 19a ד\"ה מה להלן, who originally understood it very differently:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה להלן פרחה בכולו טהור. מדמדמה פריחה דאדם לפריחת בגדים הא דכתיב\n(ויקרא י״ג:י״ב) וכסתה הצרעת את כל עור הנגע מראשו ועד רגליו אגופו של\nאדם קאי <strong>אע\"ג דפשטיה דקרא משמע דאנגע קאי דאיירי לעיל בנגע שנטמא על ידי\nשיש בו מחיית בשר חי ועליה קאי וכסתה הצרעת את כל עור הנגע מראשו של נגע\nעד רגליו כלומר עד סופו</strong> אבל הכא משמע דקאי אאדם דומיא דבגד וכן מוכח בכמה\nמקומות בת\"כ ובריש איזהו מקומן (זבחים מט:):</p>\n<p>...even though <strong>the simple meaning of the verses</strong> implies that [<strong>the\nspreading] goes on the nega itself</strong>: Above the section was dealing with a nega\nthat became tamei because it contained a \"michyah\" (healthy flesh),\nand on this it says that afterward the nega covered <strong>the entire skin of\nthe nega</strong>, from its head to its foot, that is, till the other end.<br />\nBut this gemara implies that it goes on the [whole] person, similar to\nthe tzoraas on clothing (which does not have a din of michyah at\nall)... This is also implied in many places in Toras Cohanim...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Tosefos HaRosh there has a similar discussion. They are making an interesting point: How do <em>we</em> read the words את כל עור הנגע, which doesn't sound like the person's whole body? (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Malbim_on_Leviticus%2C_Tazria.80.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> there.)</p>\n<p>Still and all, I'm astonished at their claim that this gemara is the source for reading it the way we read it (and Toras Cohanim; can someone tell me what they see in the source from Zevachim?) After all, there is a whole perek of the Mishnah talking about פורח, the 8th perek of Negaim. Is it possible to read <em>that</em> according to what they call the simple reading of the Torah? (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Negaim.8.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah 2</a> there is an easy example; there must be others.)</p>\n\n\n",

There seem to me to be much better candidates for Shas Kattan, such as Pesachim or Nedarim, when one considers all six orders of the Mishnah.</p>\n<p>My question is - and one that is worth a bounty of lots of extra points from me - would there be a way to computationally determine which tractate has the most varied connections to other tractates in Shas?</p>\n<p>There are a few (valid) ways one might interpret this question, which could produce different results, but I'm happy to reward any good attempt with lots of bounty points. See below for some possible approaches. Additionally/alternatively, can you make (or reference) a visualization showing the Talmud's interconnectivity with something like a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_diagram_(information_visualization)\" rel=\"noreferrer\">chord diagram</a>? Or a similar kind of visualization that can help display what the \"real Shas Kattan\" would look like? (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/visualizations\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria has some nice visualizations here</a>, but none that answer my specific question about the Talmud Bavli).</p>\n<p>Computationally speaking, which tractate of Talmud Bavli is the real \"Shas Kattan\"?</p>\n<hr />\n<h3>Possible Approaches</h3>\n<p><strong>Page-by-page Seder Score</strong>: give each page of talmud a score between 0-6 for its \"order connectivity breadth,\" defined by the number of orders (out of the 6 orders, or <em>sedarim</em> of the Mishnah) cross-referenced by a single page, and then find the Tractate with the highest score averaged across its pages.</p>\n<p><strong>Simple Point-Per-Tractate Score</strong>: for each tractate, give one point for every other unique tractate (in Mishnah, Talmud, or Tosefta) referenced, with the possible highest score of 63. Perhaps it would be \"more fair\" to divide that score by the number of words in the given tractate.</p>\n<p><strong>Exponential Discounting of Repeated Tractate References</strong>: what I believe would be the most accurate reflection of 'shas-kattan-ness' would be to score each tractate's references as follows: give one point for every unique Tractate referenced. For the second time that tractate is referenced, give 0.5 points, then the third time, give 0.25, etc. (So, for example, if a tractate quotes Berakhot once and Shabbat thrice, it will have a score of 1 + 1.75 = 2.75). Again, perhaps divide the final score by number of words in the tractate for fairness</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 21)\n\n<p>This question has inspired <a href=\"https://seforimblog.com/2024/08/will-the-real-shas-kattan-please-stand-up/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article over at the Seforim blog</a>, most of which is reproduced below.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Using Sefaria's <a href=\"https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export/tree/master/links\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">list of links</a>, we can do either a simple count of how many other tractates of Shas are quoted by each tractate.

In case this is interesting to anyone else, I'll show the results of my data here, but once again Chullin appears to be the winner (except maybe Bekhorot; both of them have very similar calculated deviations from an expected set of values of 1/6 citations to each Seder).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z4Gh3wdm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/Z4Gh3wdm.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>For a colorblind-friendly version, <a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/kEELvD6b.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">click here</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Another legitimate approach would be to understand the term \"shas kattan\" as a non-literal reference to \"all the topics in the Torah,\" and ask the question: which tractate of Talmud Bavli covers the most unique topics?

The upper world corresponds to the innermost part of the sanctuary - this was where the Ark and the Keruvim who spread their wings upwards, like it writes \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.6.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">each one with six wings</a>\". The middle world is the world of gilgulim (reincarnation). This corresponds to the shulchan and the menorah which corresponds to the four luminaries; the sun, moon, stars and the sky that brings forth dew and rain. To take out bread and to arrange the table with the showbread. This is the separation of the peroches - the curtain which separated the Sanctuary and the Holy of Holies. The lower world is the world of the present and that of loss. This corresponds to the altar of the burnt offerings where they slaughtered and offered sacrifices. Therefore, you find that this was where the entrance of the Tent of Meeting was. Since it writes \"and the altar of the burnt offering was where the entrance of the Tent of Meeting was\". The Kiyor (the basin) was there between the Tent of Meeting and between the altar and water to wash was placed there because this hints to this world where a person needs to wash from his state of impurity. Accordingly, this is the world of action. And it writes \"wash them and remove evil from your deeds\". With regards to them ascending to the upper world - this is what said there when they would come to the Tent of Meeting and when they approach the altar they will wash, and if they do not bathe in this, the world will never again say \"water, water\" because it is said, \"He who speaks falsehood shall not be established before My eyes” (cf <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.14b.8?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 14b</a>). Because he who did not bother themselves on Erev Shabbos will not eat on Shabbos. And therefore, as it is written there, the heavens and the earth and all their hosts were completed. And therefore, \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.26.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hashem - I love Your temple abode</a>\". <strong>Because the Mishkan of Your Honour is equal (to it). And the resting place of His glory are all three worlds. Because there are times where He is found in the upper world. And times in the world of reincarnation. And sometimes He fills the whole world with His glory. Like I hinted to in Parshas Bereshis with the word \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.27?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in His image</a>\". Therefore, the parsha includes all there things: The Aron, Kapores and Keruvim - these correspond to the upper world. And after this (you have) the Shulchan and Menorah - corresponding to the middle world. And after this (you have) the altar of the burnt offering corresponding to the lower world which is the entrance of the Mishkan - the Tent of Meeting. And after this you have the courtyard of the Mishkan which marks the beginning point to enter into the Mishkan.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note also the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Terumah%2C_Torah_Ohr.19?vhe=Shenei_Luchot_HaBrit,_based_on_Amsterdam,_1698_ed._Part_III&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah HaKadosh</a> who also sees the Mishkan as being representative of the different segments that make up the world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the Zohar - the image of the Mishkan was the same of that of the upper worlds.</p>\n<p>[Meta: we should prefer primary sources over secondary]</p>\n<p>וְכֻלְּהוּ תְּלָתָא רְמִיזִין בִּקְרָא דָּא, בְּרֵאשִׁית, הַיְינוּ דִּכְתִּיב בְּחָכְמָה. בָּרָא אֱלֹהִים, הַיְינוּ דִּכְתִּיב בִּתְבוּנָה. אֵת הַשָּׁמַיִם, הַיְינוּ דִּכְתִּיב בְּדַעַת. וְכֻלְּהוּ כְּתִיבֵי בַּעֲבִידַת מַשְׁכְּנָא. וּבְרָזָא דָּא כְּתִיב, אֵלֶּה פְקוּדֵי הַמִּשְׁכָּן, דָּא רָזָא דְּחָכְמָה. מִשְׁכַּן הָעֵדוּת, דָּא רָזָא דִּתְבוּנָה, אֲשֶׁר פֻּקַּד עַל פִּי מֹשֶׁה, דָּא רָזָא דְּדַעַת. וְכֹלָּא דָּא לָקֳבֵל דָּא, בְּגִין דְּכָל מַה דְּבָרָא קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא בְּעָלְמָא דֵּין, בָּרָא לֵיהּ כְּגַוְונָא דִּלְעֵילָּא. וְכֹלָּא אִתְרְשִׁים בַּעֲבִידַת מַשְׁכְּנָא.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar,_Pekudei_4.14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar,_Pekudei_4.14</a></p>\n<p>The reason for this is because of the principle: סוף מעשה במחשבה תחילה</p>\n<p>Generally the organization of the upper worlds which are called מחשבה creates the lower worlds which are called מעשה.

    "content": "# What is the \"necessary existence\", and what makes it \"necessary\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>Often times regarding the first halacha of Yesodei Hatorah chapter 1, I hear from different people that the Rambam is discussing the concept of G-d as a \"necessary existence\" as opposed to the world as an \"optional existence\".</p>\n<p>To elaborate on some questions I have about this idea:</p>\n<p>The difficulty is that what is the necessary proof that if everything else would cease to exist, He alone would continue to exist (which is seemingly the simple meaning of \"necessary existence\")?</p>\n<p>I would think necessary existence means that logically it's necessary it exists, which means it can be proven. It's the proof just that it's passed down that He's the necessary existence?</p>\n<p>If so, he doesn't seem to give a source for that. (The verse anochi Hashem elokeicha that he brings doesn't seem to suggest this idea).</p>\n<p>My current understanding of it, is that everything we see doesn't have to exist the way it exists now, and therefore doesn't have to exist at all.</p>\n<p>However, when it comes to the state of \"Nothing\", there's only one way NOTHING can exist. \"Nothing\" can't NOT exist in a state of nothingness, because then it wouldn't be nothing. Therefore, \"Nothing\" is the real, necessary existence. And hashem in essence is what we would call \"Nothing\"--despite being the true \"something\", therefore, He is the necessary existence</p>\n<p>Is this accurate? If not, then what is the explanation for what the necessary existence is, and how we know it's necessary?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rabbi Tauber's commentary on Derech Mitzvotecha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Every other being was created; brought into existence from utter nothingness. In other words, the truth of every other entity's existence is non-being. Since there was a time when it did not exist, even now when it does exist, its fundamental state is non-being. Although it can exist, there is no necessity that it exists. Instead, it exists only because G-d wills that it be.</p>\n<p>G-d's existence, by contrast, has no reason and no motivating rationale. He just is. And He always was and always will be. The very definition of Him as G-d implies that He was not brought into being at any time or by any other cause. Instead He exists independently. He must be, for He is the truth of existence. This is implied by the term <em>mechuyav hametzius</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As R Albo states in Sefer HaIkkarim, His existence must be. His existence is from Himself, and is not the result of any other cause which preceded it.</p>\n<p>The proof of this is therefore the logic of the matter, and this is also a teaching of our tradition: As we know, Avraham Avinu discovered Hashem through a process of logical deduction, and coming up with the definition of Hashem's existence that He is <em>definitionally</em> the ultimate power and source of everything else (brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MT AZ 1:3</a>, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Maaseh_Rokeach_on_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maaseh Rokeach on OP's <em>halacha</em>: MT Y'HT 1:1</a>).</p>\n<p>As for Rambam's source, Migdal Oz <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Migdal_Oz_on_Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.1.1.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> on this halacha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתב רבינו משה ז\"ל יסוד היסודות וכו' עד בלא יד ובלא גוף. זה מקבלתו\nוחכמתו ואמתת אמונתו ואמונתנו וכללו במצות אנכי ה' אלקיך:</p>\n<p>Our teacher Moshe [Rambam] wrote [this halacha] 'The foundation of\nfoundations' etc. until 'with not a hand nor a body'. This was what he\nreceived, understood, and is his true faith, and our faith, and is\nincluded under the mitzva \"I am Hashem your God\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Derech Mitzvotecha makes a strong case that the Mitzva of knowing and believing in Hashem means not knowing and believing that He exists, but deeply understanding this very point, and as such <em>getting to know</em> Him. Without that, it is impossible to feel anything when serving Hashem, and we might end up like the theif who davens to Hashem for success, <em>ch'v</em> (HaEmunat Elokut 1-3).</p>\n\n\n",

He seems to explain that when G-d gives us a mitzvah, doing that mitzvah, without knowing the motive for it, the mitzvah he performs, ultimately elevates him in his holiness. Since Nadav and Avihu did not get commanded to bring the ketores the way they did, they sinned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונתגלה אור המצוה והעבודה האמיתית. והנס הזה הי' לפנחס מכח נשמתם שנתעברה בו שהי' התבערה הזאת שלא השגיח על הציווי ע\"י הלכה הבועל ארמית קנאים וכו' ואין מורים כן, כי העיקר שיעשה הכל רק מצד עצם הקנאה ולא מצד הציווי של הקב\"ה והחטא של נדב ואביהוא הי' ממש חטא זה שעשו שלא בגלל הציווי רק משום שבער בם אש ה' ע\"כ הי' תקונם ג\"כ במעשה הזה שעיקר הדין והמצוה שלא מחמת צווי כלל כי אין מורים כן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נדב ואביהוא היו בל\"ס אנשים גדולים ועשו הכל לשם שמים, אבל הי' חסר להם הציווי, הצו של הקב\"ה צריך להיות כח המניע האיתן ביותר העולה על כל שכל שהוא, ק\"ו אם אדם עושה מצוה בגלל הציווי הגם שאין לו כל מושג על גדלות המצוה וטעמה וערכה, נותן לו הציווי כוח וחיות לרוממו לקדושה עצומה, ובשביל זה אומרים אשר קדשנו במצוותיו וצונו, הציונו הוא עיקר הכח המקדש את האדם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chiddushei HaRim says that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sin of Nadav and Avihu was exactly this sin— they acted not because of the command, but because the fire of G-d burned within them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He continues (loose translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Nadav and Avihu were indeed great men and did everything for the sake of Heaven, but they lacked the command, the command of the Holy One, blessed be He, needs to be the most potent motivating force that surpasses all reason. How much more so if a person performs a commandment because of the command, even though he has no concept of the greatness and the reason and the value of the commandment, the command gives him strength and vitality to elevate him to immense holiness. For this reason, we say 'Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us,' for the command is the essence of the power that sanctifies a person.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But why is this considered a sin?</p>\n<p><strong>Can someone please explain what the Chiddushei HaRim says and how to resolve the seemingly contradiction that G-d <em>did</em> instruct \"the sons of Aharon to put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire\".</strong></p>\n\n\n",

State of Israel Bonds</h4>\n<p>One of the most popular and efficacious means of financing the State of Israel's burgeoning needs is the sale of bonds. Is a <em>Heter Iska</em> required for every transaction? Rav Pinchas Teitz, writing in <em>Hapardes</em> some 30 years ago, rationalizes the practice of selling Israeli bonds without a <em>Heter Iska</em> on the basis that <em>Ribis</em> implies a known creditor and debtor. Here, however, one cannot identify the individuals backing the bonds. Nor at the time of the transaction does the lender know the debtor's identity. Furthermore, it could be argued that all bonds are sold through a broker, invoking Rashi's opinion that ריבית על ידי שליח is not prohibited. He also raises the corporate status of the Jewish State, the fact that the <em>Ribis</em> involved in each bond is less than a <em>Perutah</em> (the halachic equivalent of a penny) per citizen of Israel, and interestingly enough, the argument that Arabs are also issuers of Israeli bonds, thus involving a non-Jewish partner in the transaction. However, a respondent in the periodical <em>Hamaor</em> (Jubilee Volume) strongly disputes Rav Teitz's assertion and requires a <em>Heter Iska</em> for bonds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

[If, however, when saying the\nberachah,] you did not think [about any food that might be served\nlater], then, even if at the time the fish is served there is still\nsome beer left, you must say the berachah over the fish.

If it was because Haman donned an idol, that does not appear explicitly in the narrative. And the verse states that they were bowing to Haman and not to an idol. And so it is clear that whoever explains it this way (idol) is finding an excuse for Mordechai. And to explain the failure to bow due to the fact that Haman was Mordechai's prior slave - again this has no explicit support in the story. Moreover, there is no excuse not to listen to a king's command while in exile and under his jurisdiction. The law of the land is the law. And if it is because he did not want to bow to a man, this is his error in piety and not forbidden to do ... (he brings a long list of pious biblical people who bowed to others) ... why would Mordechai be more 'pious' than them? And if you explain that Mordechai felt that Haman would not notice - as is true until the King's servants brought the matter to Haman - why did Mordechai refuse to bow even after he knew Haman knew? Why would Mordechai gravely endanger himself and the Jews by being stubborn in his matter? And if you say that Mordechai did not know that Haman would punish the Jews over this, the refutation to this approach is written nearby - for even after Mordechai knew that a decree to annihilate the Jews had issued he refused to even perform a light matter such as rising or standing before Haman (such things are customary) at a time when the hour favored Haman and (God's) judgment was outstretched against Israel?! How is it possible to excuse Mordechai's behavior? The narrative tells us why he did not bow - because he was a Jew (and not because of any prior enmity or another reason). But because there is no prohibition in our religion against bowing to a man, one who accustoms himself in this way has not probed the depths of Torah and has made the unimportant into the important and vice-versa.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If one is tempted to say that R' Reggio isn't representative of the mainstream, here is a similar Midrash Tanchuma on Vayechi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהַנָּבִיא צוֹוֵחַ, לֵךְ עַמִּי בֹּא בַחֲדָרֶיךָ וְגוֹ' (ישעיה כו, כ). אָמַר הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, אֲנִי אָמַרְתִּי לָכֶם שֶׁתִּהְיוּ מַטְמִינִים עַצְמְכֶם וְתִתְּנוּ מָקוֹם לַשָּׁעָה. נָבוֹת לֹא נָתַן מָקוֹם לַשָּׁעָה, לְכָךְ כְּתִיב בֵּהּ, כִּי סֻקַּל נָבוֹת וַיָּמֶֹת (מלכים א רא, טו). <strong>מָרְדְּכַי עָמַד כְּנֶגֶד הַשָּׁעָה, וְהָיָה לוֹ לְהַחֲנִיף לָרָשָׁע. וּלְפִי שֶׁעָמַד כְּנֶגֶד הָמָן הָרָשָׁע קִמְעָא,</strong> כְּבָר הָיוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל כָּלִים מִן הָעוֹלָם.\nThe prophet cried out: Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers … hide thyself for a little moment (Isa. 26:20). The Holy One, blessed be He, had declared: I counsel you to restrain yourselves and to surrender to the conditions that prevail at the moment. Naboth would not temporize (when Ahab demanded his land), and so it is written about him: Naboth is stoned, and is dead (I Kings 21:14). <strong>Mordecai likewise refused to temporize. He should have flattered the wicked man. Indeed, Israel was almost obliterated from the earth because he antagonized Haman.</strong>\nדָּוִד בָּרַח וַיִּמָּלֵט מִפְּנֵי שָׁאוּל, וְכֵן בָּרַח מִפְּנֵי אַבְשָׁלוֹם בְנוֹ. וְכֵן מֹשֶׁה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיִּבְרַח מֹשֶׁה מִפְּנֵי פַרְעֹה (שמות ב, טו). וְכֵן יַעֲקֹב בָּרַח מִפְּנֵי עֵשָׂו, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיִּבְרַח יַעֲקֹב שְׂדֵה אֲרָם (הושע יב, יג). וְאַף אֲבוֹת הָעוֹלָם נָתְנוּ מָקוֹם לַשָּׁעָה וְהֶחֱנִיפוּ לְמִי שֶׁהַשָּׁעָה בְיָדוֹ. אַבְרָהָם נִטְפַּל בְּשָׂרָה, לְמַעַן יִיטַב לִי בַעֲבוּרֵךְ. יִצְחָק הֶחֱנִיף לְעֵשָׂו, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: וַיֶּאֱהַב יִצְחָק אֶת עֵשָׂו. וְאַף כָּאן יַעֲקֹב קָרָא לִבְנוֹ לְיוֹסֵף,\nOn the other hand, David fled and escaped from Saul, and he also fled from Absalom. Moses did likewise, as it is said: He fled from the face of Pharaoh (Exod. 2:15). Similarly, Jacob fled from Esau, as it is said: And Jacob fled into the field of Aram (Hos. 12:13). Even the patriarchs temporized and flattered the one in power at the moment. Abraham relied upon Sarah: That it be well with me for thy sake (Gen. 12:13). Isaac demeaned himself before Esau, as is said: Now Isaac loved Esau (ibid. 25:28). Similarly ,in this instance Jacob called his son Joseph.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Megillah then famously goes on to say that Mordechai urged Esther to take steps to save the Jews. And that if she did not, the Jews would be rescued anyway (Esther 4:14):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֣י אִם־הַחֲרֵ֣שׁ תַּחֲרִ֘ישִׁי֮ בָּעֵ֣ת הַזֹּאת֒ רֶ֣וַח וְהַצָּלָ֞ה יַעֲמ֤וֹד לַיְּהוּדִים֙ מִמָּק֣וֹם אַחֵ֔ר וְאַ֥תְּ וּבֵית־אָבִ֖יךְ תֹּאבֵ֑דוּ וּמִ֣י יוֹדֵ֔עַ אִם־לְעֵ֣ת כָּזֹ֔את הִגַּ֖עַתְּ לַמַּלְכֽוּת׃\nOn the contrary, if you keep silent in this crisis, relief and deliverance will come to the Jews from another quarter, while you and your father’s house will perish. And who knows, perhaps you have attained to royal position for just such a crisis.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why was Mordechai certain the Jews would be saved after he <em>poked the bear</em> (it was his 'refusal to temporize' that caused the danger in the first place)? How ironic! His refusal to acknowledge mortal danger requires him to urge Esther to place her own life in jeopardy! Perhaps, notwithstanding his error, he knew that God would never allow all of the Jews to be destroyed. Or maybe he continued to believe that his actions were justified throughout and thus God would rescue them? A bit of both?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Esther.3.2?lang=bi&with=Megillat%20Setarim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megilas S'tarim</a> from the Nesivos on the verse that Mordechai would not bend nor bow. He mostly agrees with your premise, <em>but</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מרדכי לא יכרע ולא ישתחוה. קשה הדבר שנכתב בלשון עתיד שהיה לו לכתוב\nומרדכי לא כרע ולא השתחוה. לכן נראה כי באמת מה שמרדכי לא השתחוה ואיקני'\nבי' בהמן עד שרצה לכלות ישראל הי' כמעט חטא דהא אמרו במגיל' אמרה כנסת\nישראל חזי מה עשה לי יהודי דלא קטלי דוד לשמעי דנפיק מיניה מרדכי וכו'\nהרי חשבו בש\"ס לגנות על שלא השתחוה. והדבר קשה שמרדכי הצדיק יעשה כזאת.\nאך הרמב\"ן בהקדמתו לאיוב כתב שכשהצדיק עושה דבר שהוא נגד הד\"ת בוודאי\nנסתלק ממנו הבחירה והנה בפ' בשלח כתב רש\"י על הקרא דאז ישיר שעלה בלבו\nשישיר וכן כאן כוונת הכתוב שמרדכי לא עלה בלבי שיכרע היות שנסתלק ממנו\nהבחירה:</p>\n<p>\"Mordechai would not bend nor bow\" ... In truth, that which Mordechai\nwould not bow, and thus riled up Haman until he wanted to destroy\nIsrael - it is almost a sin!... It is hard to understand that\nMordechai the Tzaddik would do something like this. But the Ramban\nsays... that when a tzaddik does something against the Torah, you may\nbe certain that <em>free choice was taken from him</em>... [that is why the\nfuture tense (יכרע, ישתחוה) is used here:] It never even <em>occurred</em> to him to bend or\nbow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, this is a similar case to what Chazal say in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.56b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&sbsq=%D7%99%D7%A1%D7%9B%D7%9C&with=SidebarSearch&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the fifth perek of Gittin</a> happened to Rabban Yochanan ben Zakkai when he spoke to Vespasian; \"מֵשִׁיב חֲכָמִים אָחוֹר וְדַעְתָּם יְסַכֵּל\" - \"[Hashem] turns wise men backward and makes their knowledge foolish\": Sometimes Hashem wants a thing to happen in a certain way, and causes our sages to make even obvious mistakes so that it will happen.<br />\nIf you want to learn that Mordechai made a mistake - and <em>most</em> Torah-true opinions do not agree with that at all - this is the way to approach it. Mordechai remains completely innocent here.</p>\n<p>However you approach that question, I don't see that any of it has to do with Esther, or Mordechai's words to her. Of course Hashem is not going to allow Israel to be destroyed, whether or not someone made a huge mistake. Hashem runs the world, not fools or villains. Remember that Chazal describe the whole Purim incident as a huge step forward for our nation in its relationship with Hashem, קִיְּמוּ וְקִבְּלוּ הַיְּהוּדִים — קִיְּימוּ מַה שֶּׁקִּיבְּלוּ כְּבָר: Here they finally accepted the Torah wholeheartedly (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.88a.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&namedEntity=jewish-people&namedEntityText=Jewish%20people&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbos 88a</a>)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# If the rakia is a physical dome, why doesn't it cause tumat ohel on the entire world?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Ohalot (chapter 9) discusses that a corpse without a cover projects tumat meit (impurity imparted by a corpse) up to the rakia (firmament).</p>\n<p>Example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָיְתָה פְחוּתָה וּפְקוּקָה בְקַשׁ אוֹ אֲפוּצָה, אֵיזוֹ הִיא אֲפוּצָה,\nכֹּל שֶׁאֵין לָהּ טֶפַח מִמָּקוֹם אֶחָד, כַּזַּיִת מִן הַמֵּת נָתוּן\nתַּחְתֶּיהָ, כְּנֶגְדּוֹ עַד הַתְּהוֹם טָמֵא. עַל גַּבָּהּ,\nכְּנֶגְדּוֹ עַד הָרָקִיעַ טָמֵא. בַּבַּיִת, אֵין טָמֵא אֶלָּא\nהַבַּיִת. בְּתוֹכָהּ, אֵין טָמֵא אֶלָּא תוֹכָהּ:</p>\n<p>If it is defective, although [it may be] stopped up with straw or it\nis stuck to the side of the door What is \"stuck? Anything which has no\nopening of one handbreadth : Then, if an olive-sized [portion] of a\ncorpse is placed below it, [everything] directly [below the portion]\nto the depths becomes unclean; [If placed] above [the hive everything]\ndirectly above to the sky becomes unclean. [If the uncleanness is] in\nthe house, nothing becomes unclean except the house. [If the\nuncleanness is] within [the hive] nothing becomes unclean except that\nwhich is within [the hive].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My friend and I were arguing whether Chazal thought the rakia is a physical entity or not. I brought this as a proof that they did not hold of a physical dome, because otherwise the tumat ohel would cover the whole world from a corpse anywhere and that's obviously not the case.</p>\n<p>Is that a reasonable proof or is there some other reason it wouldn't cause worldwide impurity?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Perhaps we can compare <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Eruvin.22b.1.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">tosfos</a>\nthat asks that all of ארץ ישראל should be a רשות היחיד due to geographical מחיצות. Tosfos answers by saying that man made מחיצות are considered מחיצות more than non man מחיצות. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ritva_on_Eruvin.22b.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">ritva</a> as well addressed the question, arguing that the depth of the sea should be מחיצות for the whole world and the would not be any רשות הרבים. He answers that there is the limitation of a מחיצה that a person is רואה עצמו תוך המחיצות.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we can say the same here , that the רקיע is not man made, and not considered a מחיצה to be an אוהל, or it is too far away for a person to be רואה עצמו תוך המחיצות, to be a מחיצה to be an אוהל.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>There's a discussion regarding the thickness of the firmament in Bavli Pesachim 94, here's an excerpt</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִן הָאָרֶץ עַד לָרָקִיעַ מַהֲלַךְ חֲמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְעוֹבְיוֹ שֶׁל רָקִיעַ מַהֲלַךְ חֲמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וּבֵין (כׇּל) רָקִיעַ לְרָקִיעַ מַהֲלַךְ חֲמֵשׁ מֵאוֹת שָׁנָה וְכֵן בֵּין כׇּל רָקִיעַ וְרָקִיעַ {ישעיהו י\"ד:ט\"ו} אַךְ אֶל שְׁאוֹל תּוּרָד אֶל יַרְכְּתֵי בוֹר</p>\n<p>In contrast, from the earth to the first firmament of seven (see Ḥagiga 12b) is a walking distance of five hundred years, and the thickness of the firmament is a walking distance of five hundred years, which is equal to approximately 1.8 million parasangs, and between each firmament is another walking distance of five hundred years, and so too between each and every firmament.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(As far as your q regarding tumah I'd venture that it needs to be halachically defined as an ohel or keli to cause the tumah to spread, the entire world isn't defined as such, ergo, despite the firmament being solid, it doesn't cause tumah to spread . .)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>What you are really asking is how is the term <em>Rakia</em> (רקיע) understood when used in the Torah?</p>\n<p>The best way to understand <em>Rakia</em> in English is to think of what is called a <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase_separation#:%7E:text=Phase%20separation%20is%20the%20creation,known%20as%20liquid%2Dliquid%20equilibrium.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">phase separation</a></em> in chemistry.</p>\n<p>Phase separation is the creation of two distinct phases from a single homogeneous mixture. The transition point between the two distinct phases is the <em>Phase Separation</em> which in Hebrew is called רקיע.</p>\n<p>To really grasp the ramifications of the idea of Phase Separation requires looking at the ideas of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Colloid</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture#Homogeneous_and_heterogeneous_mixtures\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mixture</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_(chemistry)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Solution</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Suspension</a> as they apply in chemistry.</p>\n<p>In terms of the Creation of the universe, <em><strong>the two distinct phases</strong></em> are the spiritual domain, meaning the domain of Angels (אלקות) and the physical, material domain (גשמיות), meaning stars, constellations and planets of this world (עולם הזה). This is referred to as <em>Yesh</em> (יש), <em>Being</em>.</p>\n<p>But it is important to note that the two distinct phases actually originate and arise from one, single, homogeneous state, G-d at His essence (מהות), meaning אין סוף. This is often referred to as <em>Creation Ex-Nihilo</em> (יש מאין)</p>\n<p>The point of phase separation itself, meaning the Rakia, is apart from either of the two distinct phases and is equated with the geometric concepts of point (נקודה), line (קו) and field (שטח). Each of these three concepts are associated with greater or lesser states of non-existence or nullification (ביטול היש).</p>\n<p>In the context of your Mishnah, it is addressing the condition and effect of <em>one of the two distinct phases</em>, <em><strong>meaning Tumah as it pertains to the physical, material state</strong></em> (יש). But the Rakia itself is <em>above</em> the distinct phases and in fact, transcends that state of being altogether (ביטול היש היינו אין).</p>\n<p>In truth, to better understand this requires careful reflection  upon Bereshit 1:6-10.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים <strong>יְהִ֥י רָקִ֖יעַ בְּת֣וֹךְ הַמָּ֑יִם וִיהִ֣י מַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין מַ֖יִם לָמָֽיִם׃</strong>\nוַיַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִים֮ אֶת־הָרָקִ֒יעַ֒ <strong>וַיַּבְדֵּ֗ל בֵּ֤ין הַמַּ֙יִם֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ מִתַּ֣חַת לָרָקִ֔יעַ וּבֵ֣ין הַמַּ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵעַ֣ל</strong> לָרָקִ֑יעַ וַֽיְהִי־כֵֽן׃\n<strong>וַיִּקְרָ֧א אֱלֹהִ֛ים לָֽרָקִ֖יעַ שָׁמָ֑יִם</strong> וַֽיְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽיְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי׃ {פ}\nוַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים <strong>יִקָּו֨וּ הַמַּ֜יִם מִתַּ֤חַת הַשָּׁמַ֙יִם֙ אֶל־מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד וְתֵרָאֶ֖ה הַיַּבָּשָׁ֑ה</strong> וַֽיְהִי־כֵֽן׃\n<strong>וַיִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים ׀ לַיַּבָּשָׁה֙ אֶ֔רֶץ</strong> וּלְמִקְוֵ֥ה הַמַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א יַמִּ֑ים וַיַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים כִּי־טֽוֹב׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That Mayim (מים) is alluding to the concept of Tzaddik (צדיק), that Mayim is the gematria value of the letter (צ) Tzadi(<em>k</em>). צדיק יסוד עולם</p>\n<p>Water was at the beginning one, which through the paradigm of Creation will manifest within the universe as two, like it states in Bereshit 1:2,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָאָ֗רֶץ הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֙הוּ֙ וָבֹ֔הוּ וְחֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם וְר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַמָּֽיִם׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>that the <em>Ruach Elokim</em> refers to <em><strong>Moshiach</strong></em> as a single individual <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.2?lang=bi&with=Ba%27al%20HaTurim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like is stated in the commentary of the Tur</a>, (in the example of Moshe Rabbeinu,(<em>the paradigm of the first and final Redeemer</em>) combining both the qualities of Moshiach ben Yosef and Moshiach ben David. That Moshe is spread throughout each and every generation (<em>like the word</em> <strong>רקיע</strong> <em>connotes <strong>spreading</strong></em>), like it states in Tikkunei Zohar 112a:13)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאִתְפַּשְׁטוּתֵיהּ דְּמשֶׁה בְּכָל דָּרָא וְדָרָא וּבְכָל צַדִּיק וְצַדִּיק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is alluded to by the expression, על-פני המים. That על-פני is referring to the פנימיות, the inner letters of the word צדיק, meaning ד״ויד-י״וסף. That single individual, that single צדיק is then separated into two distinct phases like it states in Bereshit 1:6-7.</p>\n<p>That <em>Upper Water</em> is referring to <em>Tzaddik Elyon</em> (צדיק עליון) meaning (צדיק צלמו), the aspect of Yesod of Nukvah (יסוד דנקבה). That עליון is gematria צלמו. This refers to Moshiach ben David (משיח בן דויד).</p>\n<p>So too, Lower Water (המים מתחת) is referring to <em>Tzaddik Tachton</em> (צדיק תחתון), meaning (צדיק יהוה), the aspect of Yesod of Zachar or Ze'ir Anpin (יסוד דזכר). This is Moshiach ben Yosef (משיח בן יוסף).</p>\n<p>When the two separate and distinct personalities of Moshiach ben David and Moshiach ben Yosef are merged together as a single individual, then Tumah is no longer relevant to Moshiach. This is in keeping with the statement from Zechariah 23:2 which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהָיָה֩ בַיּ֨וֹם הַה֜וּא נְאֻ֣ם ׀ יְהֹוָ֣ה צְבָא֗וֹת אַכְרִ֞ית אֶת־שְׁמ֤וֹת הָֽעֲצַבִּים֙ מִן־הָאָ֔רֶץ וְלֹ֥א יִזָּכְר֖וּ ע֑וֹד וְגַ֧ם אֶת־הַנְּבִיאִ֛ים <strong>וְאֶת־ר֥וּחַ הַטֻּמְאָ֖ה אַעֲבִ֥יר מִן־הָאָֽרֶץ׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is referred to as עולם התחיה, the later stage of the Days of Moshiach. This is the resurrected Moshiach referred to in Yechezkel 37:15-19 and also tractate Sukkah 52b.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִ֥י דְבַר־יְהֹוָ֖ה אֵלַ֥י לֵאמֹֽר׃\nוְאַתָּ֣ה בֶן־אָדָ֗ם <strong>קַח־לְךָ֙ עֵ֣ץ אֶחָ֔ד וּכְתֹ֤ב עָלָיו֙ לִֽיהוּדָ֔ה</strong> וְלִבְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חֲבֵרָ֑ו <strong>וּלְקַח֙ עֵ֣ץ אֶחָ֔ד וּכְת֣וֹב עָלָ֗יו לְיוֹסֵף֙ עֵ֣ץ אֶפְרַ֔יִם</strong> וְכׇל־בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חֲבֵרָֽו׃\n<strong>וְקָרַ֨ב אֹתָ֜ם אֶחָ֧ד אֶל־אֶחָ֛ד לְךָ֖ לְעֵ֣ץ אֶחָ֑ד</strong> וְהָי֥וּ לַאֲחָדִ֖ים בְּיָדֶֽךָ׃\nוְכַֽאֲשֶׁר֙ יֹאמְר֣וּ אֵלֶ֔יךָ בְּנֵ֥י עַמְּךָ֖ לֵאמֹ֑ר הֲלֽוֹא־תַגִּ֥יד לָ֖נוּ מָה־אֵ֥לֶּה לָּֽךְ׃\nדַּבֵּ֣ר אֲלֵהֶ֗ם כֹּה־אָמַר֮ אֲדֹנָ֣י יֱהֹוִה֒ <strong>הִנֵּה֩ אֲנִ֨י לֹקֵ֜חַ אֶת־עֵ֤ץ יוֹסֵף֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּיַד־אֶפְרַ֔יִם וְשִׁבְטֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חֲבֵרָ֑ו וְנָתַתִּי֩ אוֹתָ֨ם עָלָ֜יו אֶת־עֵ֣ץ יְהוּדָ֗ה וַֽעֲשִׂיתִם֙ לְעֵ֣ץ אֶחָ֔ד וְהָי֥וּ אֶחָ֖ד בְּיָדִֽי׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That G-d, at His essence (מהות), transcends letters and names altogether. But as part of Creation, G-d dressed, so to speak within His names. This is the meaning of the opening lines of the Adon Olam prayer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲדוֹן עוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר מָלַךְ, בְּטֶֽרֶם כָּל יְצִיר נִבְרָא:\nלְעֵת נַעֲשָׂה בְחֶפְצוֹ כֹּל, אֲזַי מֶֽלֶךְ שְׁמוֹ נִקְרָא:\nוְאַחֲרֵי כִּכְלוֹת הַכֹּל, לְבַדּוֹ יִמְלֹךְ נוֹרָא:\nוְהוּא הָיָה וְהוּא הֹוֶה, וְהוּא יִהְיֶה בְּתִפְאָרָה:\nוְהוּא אֶחָד וְאֵין שֵׁנִי, לְהַמְשִׁיל לוֹ לְהַחְבִּֽירָה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

This is obviously not to be identified with the Achashverosh in Esther, as many meforshim make clear. Is there any reason to assume this Achashverosh is Cyaxares/Astibaras or Astyages (my feeling is towards Cyaxares but I'd like to hear other opinions)? And why does he share a name with Achashverosh (which, based on the name and story, is very likely to have been Xerxes I) in Megillas Esther?</p>\n<p>I did ask on the <a href=\"https://linguistics.stackexchange.com/q/48573/45031\">Linguistics stack-exchange</a> about <em>linguistically</em> connecting the name \"Astibaras\" with \"Achashverosh;\" that theory has quite a few issues.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Chaim Chefetz argued in his Hebrew essay \"<a href=\"https://www.herzog.ac.il/vtc/tvunot/mega14_hefetz.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Kingdom of Persia and Medea in the Second Temple Period and Prior; a New Look</a>\" (PDF), Megadim 14,<sup>1</sup>, which attempts to resolve the mass discrepancies between traditional biblical chronology and external non-biblical historical sources (and between these various external sources), a subject often called \"<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_years_(Jewish_calendar)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the missing years</a>\", that this Achashverosh could be identified with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_I\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Cyrus I of Anshan</a>, as well as Cyaxares, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astyages\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Astyages</a>, and a couple of other figures.

Darius Ochus had a son named after his father Achashverosh I, who grew up to become the Achashverosh of Esther.</p>\n<p>I don't think I'll be able to summarize all of what Chefetz wrote in English because it's long and complicated, but if you can read Hebrew, I recommend at least reading Rabbi Medan's introduction and summary (n. 1 below) and/or his notes at the end of each subsection of Chefetz's essay, where he summarized the main points of each section.

If the handle was removed or the point was broken off it is still clean. R. Yehuda says that it is unclean.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The commentators explain that the dispute is whether, once broken and no longer capable of become <em>tamei</em>, potsherds can be made usable and again capable of becoming <em>tamei</em>. The <em>halacha</em> as recorded by Rambam (in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Vessels.18.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keilim 18:11</a>, right after the one you quoted) is not like R. Yehuda, and once incapable of becoming <em>tamei</em> and losing its status as a vessel, a potsherd will never more be capable of becoming <em>tamei</em>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮הַחֶרֶס שֶׁאֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לֵישֵׁב כְּדֵי שֶׁיְּקַבֵּל מִפְּנֵי אָזְנוֹ אוֹ שֶׁהָיָה בּוֹ חִדּוּד וְהַחִדּוּד מַכְרִיעוֹ לְצַד אַחֵר הֲרֵי זֶה טָהוֹר אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁנִּטְּלָה הָאֹזֶן אוֹ נִשְׁבַּר הַחִדּוּד שֶׁכָּל כְּלִי חֶרֶס שֶׁטָּהַר שָׁעָה אַחַת אֵין לוֹ טֻמְאָה לְעוֹלָם:</p>\n<p>When an earthenware container cannot rest on its base because of a handle or it has a protrusion and the protrusion causes it to lean to one side, it is pure even though the handle was removed or the protrusion was broken. The rationale is that whenever an earthenware container is considered as pure for even one moment, it is never susceptible to impurity again. [using language from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosefta_Kelim_Kamma.3.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Keilim BK 3:4</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam also repeats this in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Vessels.19.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Keilim 19:14</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮אֲבָל חֶרֶס שֶׁנִּקַּב אַחַר שֶׁפֵּרַשׁ מִן הַכְּלִי וְסָתַם הַנֶּקֶב בְּזֶפֶת אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהוּא מַחֲזִיק רְבִיעִית טָהוֹר. שֶׁהַחֶרֶס שֶׁנִּקַּב בָּטַל שֵׁם כְּלִי מֵעָלָיו וְטָהַר וְכָל שֶׁטָּהַר בִּכְלִי חֶרֶס שָׁעָה אַחַת אֵין לוֹ טֻמְאָה לְעוֹלָם:</p>\n<p>If, however, one plugged a hole in a shard with tar after it was separated from the k'li, it is pure, even though it is now capable of holding a revi'it. The rationale is that when a shard is perforated, it is no longer considered as a k'li and it is pure. And once an earthenware container has been considered as pure for even one moment, it never becomes susceptible to impurity again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, an earthenware vessel can only become <em>tamei</em> after being fired in the oven (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.4.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Keilim 4:4</a>), so simply reassembling potsherds does not make this new earthenware vessel capable of becoming <em>tamei</em>. It's irrelevant whether the pieces originally came from a <em>tamei</em> or <em>tahor</em> earthenware pot.</p>\n<p>Note that this rule requires that the potsherds no longer be considered vessels (like in your question). If a pot developed holes such that it no longer served its function, it can no longer become <em>tamei</em>, but remains a vessel; if repaired, it can become <em>tamei</em> again (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Kelim.3.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Keilim 3:4</a>, for example).</p>\n\n\n",

If muktzeh, what type?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Masechet Shabbat 128b, it says one is forbidden to move on Shabbat domesticated animals, wild animals, or birds. The Ra'an says because living creatures are not suitable for any work on Shabbat, and there is nothing to do with them (\"they do not see anything,\" they are not suitable for anything), and therefore, their law is like the law of stones and wood designated for Shabbat because since they have no use on Shabbat, it is forbidden to move them on Shabbat (as also explained in the Beit Yosef Siman 308). And so too is the law regarding birds in a cage, since there is no use for the bodies of the birds on Shabbat, it is forbidden to move them even when they are in a cage. And there is no distinction in this matter between moving domesticated animals and moving birds, as mentioned in Shulchan Aruch 308:39, \"it is forbidden to move domesticated animals and birds on Shabbat.\" However, in truth, according to the opinion of the Or Zarua there is room to be lenient regarding moving birds on Shabbat, since people enjoy their voices on Shabbat, and in this enjoyment, there is no prohibition, and there is also no concern of prohibition in moving them, because no work is done with them at all, and we only enjoy their appearance and their chirping and singing. Therefore, according to the opinion of the Or Zarua, it is permissible to move birds in a cage on Shabbat.</p>\n<p>Rav Ovadia in Yabia Omer 5:26 says that even though we follow the stricter opinion of the Rosh, nevertheless in a situation where there is concern for animal suffering, such as when the cage is in a place where the sun beats down on it, or they are in a very cold place, and there is danger to the birds and great suffering, one should rely on the opinion of the Or Zarua and permit moving the birdcage to a place where there is shade.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Feinstein in Igrot Moshe 5:22:21 writes that small birds that are usually played with are not muktza, though elsewhere (Tiltulei Shabbo, p 119) is quoted as taking a stricter approach. Az Nidberu 8:36 is lenient.</p>\n\n\n",

After the Gemara discusses his reward, R' Chiya exclaimed 'If this is true by one who is not obligated, how much more so [is the reward] for one who is obligated':</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רב יהודה אמר שמואל, שאלו את ר' אליעזר עד היכן כיבוד אב ואם, אמר\nלהם, צאו וראו מה עשה עובד כוכבים אחד לאביו באשקלון, ודמא בן נתינה שמו,\nבקשו ממנו חכמים אבנים לאפוד וכו' והיה מפתח מונח תחת מראשותיו של אביו\nולא ציערו, לשנה האחרת נתן הקב\"ה שכרו שנולדה לו פרה אדומה בעדרו, נכנסו\nחכמי ישראל אצלו, אמר להם, יודע אני בכם שאם אני מבקש מכם כל ממון שבעולם\nאתם נותנין לי, אלא אין אני מבקש מכם אלא אותו ממון שהפסדתי בשביל כבוד\nאבא, וא\"ר חנינא ו<strong>מה מי שאינו מצווה ועושה כך, מצווה ועושה על אחת כמה\nוכמה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A second Gemara that assumes a Noahide is not obligated is Nazir 61a, where the Gemara is seeking the source for a statement that a gentile has no Nezirus. One of the options the Gemara considers is that one who is not obligated in <em>Kibbud Av</em> is also not obligated in <em>Nezirus</em>. Again, the Gemara assumes a Noahide is not obligated in <em>Kibbud Av</em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שאני הכא דאמר קרא 'לאביו ולאמו לא יטמא' במי שיש לו אב, יצא עובד כוכבים\nשאין לו אב. למאי, אילימא לענין ירושה וכו' אלא במי שמוזהר על כיבוד אבי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there is an indication from Shulchan Aruch that seems to conflict these two Gemaras. Shulchan Aruch (YD 241:9) rules that a convert is prohibited from cursing or degrading his parents, so it shouldn't seem that the conversion leads to a lesser degree of Kedusha. [In other words, anything prohibited as a gentile will continue to be prohibited as a convert, even though the conversion would otherwise render it permitted, so as not to appear that Judaism has less sanctity than before the conversion].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גר אינו רשאי לקלל או לבזות הוריו 'כדי שלא יאמרו באו מקדושה חמורה\nלקדושה קלה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The clear implication of this is that prior to his conversion, a gentile is prohibited from cursing or degrading his parents. This is noted by the commentaries, who grapple to reconcile the ruling of the Shulchan Aruch [and the source, Rambam (Mamrim 5:11)] with the above Gemara's, which are clear that there is no obligation.</p>\n<p>R' Akiva Eiger cites Pri Megadim that although there is no obligation, the clear logic behind Kibud Av led to gentiles accepting a form of Kibbud Av in their own laws, although halachically there is no obligation.</p>\n<p>Others (See Malbim to Devarim 27:16, see similar ruling in Kli Chemdah (Yisro, 7, although from a different rationale) rule that although there is no obligation to respect, a gentile is prohibited from cursing or degrading. [See also Rambam, 'מצקת כיבוד', which denotes a lower form of honoring; see also Igros Moshe (YD 2:130) with a definition of 'miktzas kibbud'.]</p>\n\n\n",

He arrived early, and the host wasn't home, so he went off to the Beit Midrash to learn until the evening. After leaving the house to go, the butler of the host came out, yanked Rashi's scarf off, and roughed him up a bit, accused him of stealing the scarf. Then the butler headed back into the house.</p>\n<p>Rashi picked himself up, took a piece of chalk, and wrotes his name 5 times on the door:<br />\nשלמה<br />\nשלמה<br />\nשלמה<br />\nשלמה<br />\nשלמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was all resolved when the host came home. When asked why he wrote his name 5 times on the door, Rashi said he didn't write his name 5 times, he wrote \"<em>Shelama Shelomo shelema Salma shilema</em>\" = \"Why did Shlomo have to pay for the whole scarf?\"</p>\n<p>I am interested in the source of this story, and any commentaries that might be available from any Rabbis on this story. Is there any lesson to draw from it?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Personally, when I heard this story, it painted a tangible protrait of what true humility looks like - to be accused and beaten, and yet see humour in it, and make a particularly good, and wise joke.</p>\n\n\n",

Yaakov Loeberbaum (author of Nesivos HaMishpat), Maaseh Nisim, says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומה שנראה לתת טעם במה שלא תיקנו ברכה, כי עינינו הרואות שבכל דבר שתיקנו ברכה בגוף המצוה לא תיקנו ברכה על צוותו העשיית המצות, כי אינו בדין לתקן בברכה על ברכה. דהא ברכת המזון גם כן מצות עשה דאורייתא היא ולא תיקנו לברך אקבמו\"צ לברך על המזון. אלא ודאי מטעם שכתבתי כיון שמברכין השי\"ת בגוף המצוה אינו בדין לתקן ברכה על ברכה. ומטעם זה לא תיקנו ג\"כ כאן כיון שכבר תיקנו ברכה אגוף הגאולה, והוא ברכת אשר גאלנו לא תיקנו עוד ברכה אחרת על זה.</p>\n<p>It seems [to me] to give a reason regarding that which they [the Rabbis] did not affix a bracha, since we can see that anything that the bracha is done as the body of the Mitzvah, they did not affix a bracha on that which he commanded us to <em>do the mitzvah</em>. It wouldn't make sense to make a brach on a bracha. For instance, Birkat Hamazon is a biblical Mitzvah, and the Bracha \"he who commanded us to bless Him for our food\" is not made, since it wouldn't make sense to make a bracha on a bracha. Likewise here, they didn't make for the body of the Mitzvah, since they already formulated a bracha on the redemption itself - אשר גאנלו. [The Bracha said at the end of Magid.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In essence, we don't make a bracha on making a bracha. The Hagaddah can in essence be boiled down to the bracha אשר גאלנו, which really encompasses the entirety of the story \"we were slaves and God redeemed us\", and therefore we don't make a bracha on magid.</p>\n<p>There are other answers, including the one you mentioned in your question. But this one is (I think) the most famous.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Its a famous question. The answer in you're question, is since you already fulfilled the mitzva in kiddush the bracha cant be before you fulfill the mitzva. And it cant be before kiddush since we wont make a bracha before another bracha. Others explain that the bracha of kiddush is going on sippur as well.\nThe Rashba is brought by maise nissim and abudraham that says mitzvos without a shiur dont have brachas. Some explain that to mean by saying the bracha you already fulfilled the mitzva, when you mentioned mitzraim in the bracha, so cant say the bracha before the mitzva.\nThe Sfas Emes says because sippur is a logical mitzva to thank hashem for the nissim so even without hashem command we would do this so cant say the bracha, which implies we're doing it because of hashems command.\nSome explain that the mitzva of sippur is really part of matza, therefore the bracha on matza covers it.\nRav Mordechai Gifter and ponovetzher rav learn sippur is part of mitzvas talmud torah, so bracha on Torah covers it, or bracha in haggada on torah.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where in his works does Maimonides address how to understand אלו ואלו דברי אלקים חיים and the nature of makhloket more broadly (besides intro to PhM)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Given what Maimonides says in his introduction to his Commentary on the Mishnah (Perush ha-Mishnayot) it seems like he is not a pluralist when it comes to truth in a makhloket (halakhic debate). He states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל מה שאמרו משרבו תלמידי שמאי והלל שלא שמשו כל צרכם רבתה מחלוקת\nבישראל ענין זה מבואר שכל ב' אנשים בהיותם שוים בשכל ובעיון ובידיעת\nהעיקרים שיוציאו מהם הסברות לא תפול ביניהם מחלוקת בסברתם בשום פנים ואם\nנפלה תהיה מעוטא. כמו שלא נמצא שנחלקו שמאי והלל אלא בהלכות יחידות.</p>\n<p>Rather, the matter of that which they said, \"From when the students of\nShammai and Hillel – who did not serve all that was required of them –\nmultiplied, disagreement grew in Israel,\" is evident; in that when two\npeople are of equal intellect and investigation and knowledge of the\nfundamentals from which reasonings extrapolate, no disagreement will\noccur in their reasonings in any way. And if it does occur, it will be\nminimal; as it is only found that Shammai and Hillel disagreed about\nisolated laws.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Two people carrying out the correct deductions should reach the same conclusions about the law. Prima facie, the Gemara in Eiruvin 14b (and Ritva ad. loc.) suggests that multiple opinions can be correct, seemingly contrary to Maimonides' picture.</p>\n<p>The Ritva writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אלו ואלו דברי אלהים חיים. שאלו רבני צרפת ז\"ל היאך אפשר שיהו שניהם דברי\nאלהים חיים וזה אוסר וזה מתיר, ותירצו כי כשעלה משה למרום לקבל תורה הראו\nלו על כל דבר ודבר מ\"ט פנים לאיסור ומ\"ט פנים להיתר, ושאל להקב\"ה על זה,\nואמר שיהא זה מסור לחכמי ישראל שבכל דור ודור ויהיה הכרעה כמותם, ונכון\nהוא לפי הדרש ובדרך האמת יש טעם וסוד בדבר.</p>\n<p>\"These and those are the words of the Living God\" The French rabbis\nasked him, \"how is it possible that both these and those are the words\nof the Living God, this one permits and this one forbids?\" And he\nanswered that when Moshe ascended to receive the Torah, it was\nshown to him that every matter was subject to forty-nine\nlenient and forty-nine stringent approaches. And he asked the Holy One Blessed Be He about\nthis, and He responded that it was transmitted to the scholars of Israel of each generation to decide for themselves [the normative halakhah]. And this is correct according to exegetical\ninterpretation and on the \"path of truth\" there is a rationale and\nesoteric secret in the matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where in his writings does Maimonides address how to understand this?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where in the works of Maimonides does he address how to deal with apparent contradictions between halakha and empirical facts?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Maimonides’ view is that halakha is teleological (see for example Guide III, 27,31) e.g. some laws are to promote societal wellbeing, correct moral beliefs, etc. Where in his works does he deal with how to handle a demonstration on the basis of empirical fact that a particular law promotes suffering or where he explains how such a demonstration is impossible or irrelevant? I am simply looking for references to Maimonides’ works which are relevant.</p>\n<p>I am not asking how to deal with contradictions between aggadata and empirical facts.</p>\n<p>I would also be interested in places in Maimonides’ works where he deals with how to deal with a demonstration that the halakha is not the most effective way to realize the purpose of the law, but some other law is or where he explains how such a demonstration is impossible, or irrelevant.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Rambam is always careful to distinguish between knowledge of facts and knowledge of good and evil (More Nevuchim 1:2). A law can never contradict the fact that it causes suffering. The fact that a law causes suffering could only contradict a claim that a law doesn't cause suffering.</p>\n<p>The Rambam says that all the commandments have a purpose, but having a purpose doesn't mean that they don't cause suffering. Sometimes the suffering of the individual is outweighed by the benefit to the majority. For example, we put criminals to death, causing them suffering, to prevent crime, which damages the rest of society (1:54, 3:34).</p>\n<p>Finally, we don't know the reason for the commandments, because the Torah itself doesn't give them. If we are able to somehow measure the benefit and detriment of the commandments towards attaining particular goals, we still can't say that the benefit of a commandment is outweighed by the suffering it causes, because it's our own problem for not understanding the real reason (3:26).</p>\n\n\n",

Rashi writes, \"And in my heart, I say that one does not bless on the תנופה and on the placing [of hands] so as not to make a blessing in vain,\" implying that the act of waving of the animal that does not require waving can be an interruption between the bracha and the mitzvah.

Cf Megillah 14b</p>\n<p>There are some commentaries on that gemarah which indicate that in fact we can prove from the continuation of the gemarah that in fact a Beit Din is required to kill a mored b'malchut because Yoav was one and Shlomo appealed to Benayahu ben Yehoyada (himself, as chazal say, the head of the sanhedrin) to kill Yoav.</p>\n<p>See Rashba Responsa 5:238, Hatam Sofer Responsa Even HaEzer 1:151</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Tosefta Terumot 7:23 indicates that Sheba ben Bikri's murder was deemed permissible because he was labeled as a mored b'malkhut by the wise woman, though no judiciary process is indicated.</p>\n\n\n",

David says as much to Yehonatan in 20:1 and Shaul reiterates in 20:31 such that finally in v.33 Yehonatan himself concludes that Shaul is in fact trying to kill David.</p>\n<p>My question is, since Shaul is still the king of the Jews, and has made it clear that he wishes to kill David, is it a rebellion against the king for Yehonatan to then assist David or prevent Shaul from killing David?

His reproductive organ was uncovered and then he made fertile and was able to conceive his first son, Yishmael via Hagar, the Egyptian.</p>\n<p>But this still didn't answer the claim from Sarah about why she had been created with breasts to nurse.

There you can also find quotations and discussions of thinkers who attributed more agency to angels and other such beings like Saadia Gaon (e.g. see <em>Beliefs and Opinions</em> ii, 9) and Judah HaLevi (e.g. see <em>Kuzari</em> iv, 3). There is also some discussion of the philosophical significance of these various positions there.</p>\n<p>Here are some sources which may be of interest regarding demons in particular. I won't translate them in their entirety, but I'll summarize what I see as the main inference. Emphases added are mine.</p>\n<p>Avraham ben haRambam's <em>Discourse on the Sayings of the Rabbis</em>. The second section.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המעשיות שנראו ואירעו בהם בחלום, וזכרו אותם בלשון צח ופשוט לדעתם, כי אי\nאיפשר שיטעה בהם בעל שכל ובינה. וכמו שאמרו חז\"ל בברכות. \"תניא אמר ר'\nישמעאל פעם אחת נכנסתי להקטיר קטורת לפני ולפנים\" וכו'. וכזה בדבריהם\nבהרבה מקומות, וכמו כן במעשיות שזכרו בהם מראות הנביאים ושדבר עימהם,\nושהועילו עימהם. וכמו מעשיות שזכרו בהם <strong>שדים</strong>, והרואה שאין לבו עמו יחשוב\nכי הם דברים היו בעולם כמו שנכתבו, ויבוא לחשוב ולהאמין דבר הנמנע שאי\nאפשרי אבל חייב, <strong>וכל זה יקרה לו לרוב פתיותו ומיעוט ידיעתו בטבע העולם,\nובמעשה הנסים ובדרך החכמים ז\"ל שהוא דרך הנביאים, שספרו בלשון הפשוט מה\nשראו במראות הנבואה</strong>, ודרך זו דרכו החכמים כמו שבאר אבא מורי ז\"ל במורה\nהנבוכים למבין.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Basically says that all incidents involving <em>shedim</em> actually occur in dreams and that those who come to believe in such impossible things only due so due to their insufficient understanding of the natural world and the ways of the Sages which was to communicate in simple language what they saw in visions.</p>\n<p>Meiri on Berakhot 4b</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אע\"פ שקרא אדם את שמע בבית הכנסת מצוה לקרותו על מטתו, ולא על המטה ממש\nאלא סמוך לשכיבתו כמו ועליו מטה מנשה ולא על מטתו כאילו שקורין אותו דרך\nהדיוטות ובגלוי הראש אלא באימה וביראה, וטעם קריאה זו פרשו בתלמוד המערב\nלהבריח את המזיקים <strong>וביאורו אצלי המזיקים הידועים והם הדעות הכוזבים</strong>,\nוהזקיקוהו בעתות הפנאי ליחד את השם שלא יטעה באמונות השניות וכשיקרא על\nהכונה הראויה תהא מטתו בטוחה מהם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He is discussing the <em>mazikin</em> that the bedtime <em>shema</em> is supposed to protect against (per Berakhot 4b) and explains that the notion of <em>mazikin</em> is a false notion.</p>\n<p>Perhaps also of significance is that (to the best of my knowledge) Maimonides omitted all statements of the Gemara involving demons from his <em>Mishneh Torah</em>. He sometimes cites the ruling, but completely omits any mention of demons (e.g. Laws of Prayer 5:6. Compare with its source in Berakhot 3a).</p>\n\n\n",

The male only has one special female mate, and therefore, he feels sorry for her. Hence, the male cooes (מנהמת) after his mate because she is special to him. Similarly, Hashem cooes after Bnei Israel, as they are special to Him.\nThen the continuation of the story: And Eliyahu Hanavi said to him, 'Not as you think have you heard, for it is not only this hour that you have heard, and this is not the main intention in this world, but three times every day. For something like this, which is the Temple and Israel, they are the main intention of Hashem in this world. Therefore, every day one says this three times, evening, morning, and afternoon, for the duration of time is evening, morning, and afternoon.'\"</p>\n<p>So it seems that this particular analogy/imagery is given because just as the male dove only has one special female mate, and therefore, he feels sorry for her and cooes (מנהמת) after his mate, so too Hashem cooes after Bnei Israel, as they are special to Him. So it seems that the cooing is not lamentation, but a call out of love and yearning to get close.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 Thanks to @GershonGold who posted the link, but Ill just translate and summarize: It brings many proofs which says that cooing doves are associated with lamentations:</strong></p>\n<p>In Yeshayahu 59:11 it says, \"We all growl like bears; we moan mournfully like doves. We look for justice, but find none; for deliverance, but it is far away.\" The Targum Yonatan translates this as, \"Our eyes are dimmed before the lords of Babylon who gather against us, growling upon us like bears, and cooing like doves, and so on.\" The phrase \"הגה נהגה\" (translated as \"we growl\") is interpreted by Rashi as \"a language of lamentation.\" In a more detailed explanation, Radak elucidates, \"We coo like bears, all of us - the voice of bears is in the voice of lamentation and wailing, and likewise the doves coo with a voice of lamentation, for growling and wailing are found in this matter in the voice of lamentation. Similarly, in Yeshayahu 38:14, \"Like a swallow or a crane I chirp; I coo like a dove,\" the verb refers to the mournful sound made by the doves. This usage is also reflected in the translation by Targum Yonatan as \"cooing.\" In Ezekiel 7:16, it says,  “ופלטו פליטיהם והיו אל־ההרים כיוני הגאיות כלם המות איש בעונו, “And if any survive, they shall take to the mountains; they shall be like doves of the valley, cooing together —everyone for their own iniquity.” The Radak explains, \"cooing - emitting a sound like a moan, so shall the fugitives do with delight.\" Metzudat David comments, \"And they will flee to the mountains and be dispersed, moaning with a voice of lamentation, like doves gathering in the valleys, all cooing.\" Another form referring to the sound of the doves appears in Nachum 2:8, \"And her slave girls shall be led away captive, moaning like doves, beating their breasts.\" Targum Yonatan translates this as cooing like the voice of doves, lamenting in their hearts.”</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n<p>Link used: <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=46592\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://daf-yomi.com/DYItemDetails.aspx?itemId=46592</a></p>\n\n\n",

The event of Sinai establishes the voracity of Torah being God given.  So perhaps, by stating that Moshe received the Torah from Sinai it is pointing to the event of the mass revelation that provides the basis for a historical proof that the Torah was given to us from Hashem.</p>\n<p>The Ramban actually holds the demonstration of Torah from God is a Mitzvah. I will quote the source when I have more time.</p>\n<p>The Bartenurah suggests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moshe received the Torah from Sinai: I say: Since this tractate is not\nfounded on the exegesis of commandments from among the Torah’s\ncommandments, like the rest of the tractates which are in the Mishna,\nbut is rather wholly morals and principles, and whereas the sages of\nthe (other) nations of the world have also composed books according to\nthe fabrication of their hearts, concerning moral paths, how a person\nshould behave with his fellow; therefore, in this tractate the tanna\nbegan \"Moshe received Torah from Sinai,\" to tell you that the\nprinciples and morals which are in this tractate were not fabricated\nby the hearts of the Mishna’s sages; rather, they too were stated at\nSinai.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Maharal addresses this question:</p>\n<p>-To have written that “Moshe received the Torah from God” would have implied that God's ability to transmit Torah was limited specifically to Moshe as the receiver, which was not true.</p>\n<p>-When a Rav teaches Torah, the student learns Torah from the Rav, and this creates a bond between them. But saying that Moshe received the Torah from God would imply that Moshe was able to create this kind of bond with God, which is not respectful to the Almighty.</p>\n<p>-Even though it does say in the Torah (Exodus 31) that God gave Moshe the Luchot HaEdut, the two “Tablets of Testimony,” and in numerous places “And God spoke to Moshe saying...”, these were specific communiqués, and doesn't imply the bond of Rav to student.</p>\n<p>-Moshe's receiving of the Torah from God had a unique quality to it, due to its happening in a designated place, Sinai. A true “receiving” requires the full intention to give on the part of the giver, demonstrated by designating a place for the receiving. Emphasizing that Moshe received the Torah “from Sinai” (not even saying that he received it “from God at Sinai”) shows how integral the place (Sinai) was in the process of Moshe receiving the Torah, making it completely premeditated.</p>\n<p>-At Sinai, the process of communication was one where God appeared to be speaking “to Himself” and it was Moshe's responsibility to strive to receive the Torah. The perception was as if Moshe was receiving the Torah “from Sinai” since God was not required to interact with Moshe in the way a normal Rav must interact with his student</p>\n\n\n",

He basically asks your question, and then says, there are differences between the impurity caused by contact with certain materials, like metals, and the impurity caused by tzara'at. While the impurity from contact with metals extends to the material itself, tzara'at does not necessarily affect the garment or skin it's attached to as mentioned in the Mishneh in Negaim and Torat Kohanim. The passuk then says the המראה is specifically by the garments. He then continues to explain the other items.</p>\n<p>13:51- כאן שינה הכתוב בעור. וגם כאן עיקר ביאור הפרטים מיותר אלא ללמדנו דהפשיון ג״כ אינו אלא בגוף הבגד ולא בטפל לבגד ממין אחר. והנה כנגד זה יש חומר בצרעת משארי טומאת מגע דאם נחתך מטלית מזה הבגד המוסגר או העור וטלה על מקום אחר ואח״כ נמצא באותו מטלית נגע נחשב לפשיון ומועיל לטמא את גוף הבגד או העור שנחתך ממנו בעת שהיה מוסגר כדתנן בנגעים פ״י. מעתה אם לקח חתיכת עור לשמש לכלי עץ או מתכות אע״ג שאם היה מתחלה כך לא היה מק״ט כלל שהרי לא מיקרי כלי עור. דעיקר הכלי הוא עץ ומתכות. אלא השתא שכבר העור הוא בהסגר ואח״כ נמצא פשיון ע״ז החתיכה שמשמש את העץ ומתכות מועיל שיהא נחשב לפשיון לגוף העור שנחתך ממנו. והיינו דמדייק הכתוב או בעור לכל אשר יעשה העור למלאכה. היינו שנטפל העור למלאכת כלי עץ או מתכות. מכ״מ יש בו דין פשיון. All the details here come again to teach us that the manifestation of impurity (פשיון) is indeed only on the body of the garment and not on something attached to it of a different kind. However, regarding this, there is a distinction with tzara'at from the remnants of impurity by contact. If a piece is cut from this garment or skin and placed elsewhere, and then it is found that the same piece has tzara'at, it is considered impure for imparting impurity to the body of the garment or skin from which it was cut when it was attached, as stated in the Mishnah regarding negaim. Now, if one were to take a piece of leather to serve as part of a wooden or metal vessel, even though initially it wouldn't be called a vessel at all because it's not primarily made of leather, as the main material for the vessel is wood and metal. However, now that the leather is already incorporated and then it is found to have tzara'at due to the attachment serving the wood and metal, it is effective in imparting impurity to the body of the skin from which it was cut. This is why the scripture specifies \"or skin for whatever work skin is used for,\" meaning that the skin is attached for the work of making vessels of wood or metal. Therefore, it has the status of impurity.</p>\n<p>13:52- חזר ופירש כל הפרטים ללמדנו שגם השריפה אינה בטפל להם. It's reiterated and explained to teach us that even burning is not considered an attachment to them.</p>\n<p>13:53- חזר המקרא על כל הפרטים להשמענו דכאן יש כיבוס אפילו בכלי עור. וכבר הוי בזה טובא בזבחים פ׳ דם חטאת. The Chumash reiterated all the details to emphasize that here there is laundering even with leather vessels. This is already extensively discussed in Zevachim.</p>\n<p>13:58- חזר המקרא עוד על כל הפרטים ללמדנו דאפי׳ השתי וערב או איזה כלי עור שאינם מקבלים טומאה זולת צרעת. בעי טבילה הנהוג בכל טומאת מגע ג״כ. ולא הוי כמפץ שמקבל טומאת מדרס ואין לה טהרה במקוה משום שאינן כלי כדאי׳ שבת דפ״ד א. The Chumash repeated all the details again to teach us that even vessels such as a sheti or a leather vessel that do not accept impurity except tzara'at require immersion, which is customary for all impurities by contact as well. And it is not like a threshold that becomes impure but cannot be purified in a mikveh because they are not vessels, as discussed in Masechet Shabbat.</p>\n<p>(Just to point out: He does not give an answer for the repetition for Pesukim 56, 57, 59)</p>\n<p>For 13:59 the Malbim says, כל מיני בגדים בפרטות להרות שכולם נכנסים תחת סוג בגד וכולם נכללים במ\"ש שם \"לצרעת הבגד ולבית\" (דס\"ל לת\"ק דבר הלמד בהיקש אן חוזר ומלמד בהיקש וע\"כ מפרש שזה אינו היקש לבגד רק גלה שהם בכלל בגד וכולם מוקשים לבית. ורבי סבר שדבר הלמד בהיקש חוזר ומלמד בהיקש לכן עשה מזה שני היקשים – בגד לבית, וכולם לבגד. וכבר בארנו בפ' צו (סימן כג) שכל מקום שאומר מלת \"זאת\" בא למעט – רק זאת, לא דבר אחר. ולת\"ק ממעט שאין צריך צפרים כבית, ולרבי שההיקש דפה הוא לבגד, ממעט שאין שתי וערב מטמא רק בנגעים, לא ביתר טומאות. The pasuk mentions the clothes in details to teach that all of them are considered under the term בגד which are all under לצרעת הבגד ולבית, and then continues to explain why this is.</p>\n\n\n",

This is animal cruelty and Jews and early Jewish Christians would not abide by this. Secondary to that is the understanding that there must be no eating of blood, which would include requiring the proper draining of the animal's blood.</p>\n<p>I am unwilling to die on the hill of saying if a Noahide is offered a cup of blood he is forbidden from drinking it.

Now when the prophet Jacob saw that the deliverance which was to come through Samson ceased [when he died together with the Philistines], he said, “I hope for Thy aid, O Eternal, not for the aid of ‘the snake’ or ‘the serpent,’ for it is by Thee that I will be helped, not by a judge, as Thy salvation is ‘an everlasting salvation.’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does the Ramban exactly mean by י והיה ה' עם השופט והושיעם מיד אויביהם כל ימי השופט והוא היה האחרון לשופטים ?</p>\n<p>Is he saying that since Samson died an untimely death which is inimical to \"the Eternal was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge\" and since Samson was the last of the Judges this means that Samson in particular, and the Judges in general, were not the stuff of God's salvation?</p>\n<p><strong>If so, what if Samson lived and not fallen into enemy hands (a la the other judges)? Would this have changed Jacob's mind about Samson and Judges?

    "content": "# Does Kabbalah really teach this?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Israel Shahak in his book <em>Jewish History, Jewish Religion: the Weight of Three Thousand Years</em> claims that the majority of Orthodox Jews believe the following quotation.  He does not give sources for any of these claims.  Is this actually true?  Is this only believed by Hasidic Jews?  Is this what it says in the Zohar?  If there are Jews who believe this, is it condemned by others?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>According to the Kabbalah, the universe is ruled not by one god but by several deities of various characters and influences emanated by a dim, distant First Cause.  Omitting many details, one can summarize the system as follows.  From the First Cause, first a male god called ‘Wisdom’ or ‘Father’ and then a female goddess called ‘Knowledge’ or ‘Mother’ were emanated or born.  From the marriage of these two, a pair of younger gods were born: Son, also called by many other names such as ‘Small Face’ or ‘The Holy Blessed One’; and Daughter, also called ‘Lady’ (or ‘Matronit’, a word derived from Latin), ‘Shekhinah,’ ‘Queen’, and so on.  These two younger gods should be united, but their union is prevented by the machinations of Satan, who in this system is a very important and independent personage.  The Creation was undertaken by the First Cause in order to allow them to unite, but because of the Fall they became more disunited than ever, and indeed Satan has managed to come very close to the divine Daughter and even to rape her (either seemingly or in fact– opinions differ on this).  The creation of the Jewish people was undertaken in order to mend the break caused by Adam and Eve, and under Mount Sinai this was for a moment achieved: the male god Son, incarnated in Moses, was united with the goddess Shekhinah.  Unfortunately, the sin of the golden calf again caused disunity in the godhead; but the repentance of the Jewish people has mended matters to some extent.  Similarly, each incident of biblical Jewish history is believed to be associated with the union or disunion of the divine pair.  The Jewish conquest of Palestine from the Canaanites and the building of the first and second Temple are particularly propitious for their union, while the destruction of the Temples and exile of the Jews from the Holy Land are merely external signs not only of the divine disunion but also of a real ‘whoring after strange gods’: Daughter falls closely into the power of Satan, while Son takes various female satanic personages to his bed instead of his proper wife.  The duty of pious Jews is to restore through their prayers and religious acts the perfect divine unity, in the form of sexual union, between the male and female deities.  Thus before most ritual acts, which every devout Jew has to perform many times each day, the following Kabbalistic formula is recited: ‘For the sake of the [sexual] congress of the Holy Blessed One and his Shekhinah.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 18)\n\n<p>Reductionism is the ultimate form of sarcasm.</p>\n<p>Sarcasm is a subset of <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/132605/halachot-of-%D7%9C%D6%B5%D7%99%D7%A6%D6%B8%D7%A0%D7%95%D6%BC%D7%AA-cynicism-scoffing-and-mockery\">cynicism</a> and is forbidden and very dangerous for one's soul, because it makes light of the holy, and that has a powerfully influential psychological effect in putting people off the idea, that is almost impossible to withstand, and thus they lose touch with truth and holiness*. <strong>One shouldn't really even read the above at all.</strong>**</p>\n<p>Some of the above is reductionism of parables given in authentic sources.

This is a fundamental principle of Torah and one of the 13 principles of faith, and discussed in our hashkafic works extensively; that a being that is not capable of self control, is not commandable.</p>\n<p>Therefore the commandment to not do certain mitzvot while drunk seems to imply that we are never allowed to get drunk, because then we will be in a state where we are uncommandable, and there are commandments that apply to that state!</p>\n<p>How to resolve?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://torahanytime.com/speakers/645\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this shiur,</a> (see from 17:22) it is forbidden to become drunk.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Person sells chometz at home and travels west for Pesach. When does he get his chometz back?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Someone is going away from home for Pesach in a westerly direction. He sells his chometz in his home town through his Rav in his home town. Normally the chometz reverts back to the owner immediately after Pesach in the home town. At that time it will still be Yom Tov for the person away from home in the West. Does the traveller have a problem of then owning this sold chometz or does it only become his after he wishes to acquire it which will be after Yom Tov in his holiday location?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><strong>Minchat Yitzchak 6:45</strong>- The issue of repurchasing chametz is addressed by arguing that according to halacha it isn't necessary for the rabbi to conduct a formal act (a kinyan) to buy back the chametz from the non-Jew. The rationale behind this argument lies in the absence of a requirement for the rabbi to possess a document authorizing him to act as an agent for all those whose chametz he sold to the non-Jew. The absence of such a document indicates that a formal act of kinyan isn't truly necessary for the repurchase of the chametz. This is because, since the non-Jew is obligated to pay for any chametz that they choose to keep, their failure to remove the chametz from the Jewish seller's property and pay for it demonstrates their intention to undo the original sale. The suggestion by certain halachic authorities, such as the Bigdei Yesha and Biur Halacha, that the rabbi should perform a kinyan is primarily to avoid the misconception that selling chametz is not a genuine transaction. However, despite its authenticity, a formal act of kinyan is not fundamentally required for the repurchase of the chametz. Therefore, he argues that when the rabbi repurchases the chametz, he does so on his own behalf. Similar to the non-Jew who must pay for the chametz to keep possession, the rabbi must also pay the full value if he wishes to keep possession of the seller's chametz. Consequently, the same reasoning as before applies to the rabbi; namely, if he fails to remove the chametz from the seller's property and pay for it, it indicates his lack of desire to retain ownership. Thus, when the seller takes back the chametz, he acquires it, even without expressing anything to the rabbi.</p>\n<p><strong>Shulchan Aruch Harav OC 448:3; 450:21 in parentheses</strong>- there is no Halachic issue involved with being located in a later time zone and having the Chametz bought back after Pesach in the earlier time zone, as one has no intention to buy back the Chametz until after Pesach ends for him.</p>\n<p><strong>Igrot Moshe 4:94-</strong>- one should sell the Chametz in the earlier time zone and tell the Rav to not buy it back from the gentile on his behalf, until Pesach ends in his later time zone.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n<p><strong>Links used:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://dinonline.org/2023/04/14/shemini-pitfalls-of-people-who-travel-for-pesach-to-a-different-time-zone/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://dinonline.org/2023/04/14/shemini-pitfalls-of-people-who-travel-for-pesach-to-a-different-time-zone/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://shulchanaruchharav.com/mechiras-chometz-when-traveling-to-different-time-zones/#_ftnref8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://shulchanaruchharav.com/mechiras-chometz-when-traveling-to-different-time-zones/#_ftnref8</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

There may be places that claim to offer something online ... they're not well-respected.</p>\n<p>As Ruth said to Naomi, *your people are my people, and your G-d is my G-d.\" Conversion involves accepting the laws/rituals, and also accepting one's lot as a part of the Jewish people. If you're not affiliating with a synagogue, how are you going to live a Jewish life or connect to the Jewish people? (Never mind -- how are you going to see in action how these laws/rituals are actually lived?)</p>\n<p>The answers here default to Orthodox Judaism unless specifically asked otherwise, but I don't think any major denomination is going to treat a free, online conversion as very valid.</p>\n<p>Basically -- if you're not putting much into this, you're not going to get much out of it.</p>\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, if you want an Orthodox conversion that will be universally accepted, then you'll have to make contact with a synagogue, make plans to move within walking distance of it and attend regularly, start taking lessons, keeping kosher, and the like. After living the life for 1--2 years, if it's clear to the rabbi you're sincere (and you understand what you're getting yourself into), then the final step would be a declaring your acceptance to a panel of rabbis, plus a ceremonial dunk in a ritual bath.</p>\n<p>(Now if you live close enough to a synagogue to walk there eh, let's say every other week, it may be you can take some of the conversion lessons on Zoom, but you'll still be checking in \"in real life\" every so often. It's not an \"online conversion.\")</p>\n<p>The rabbis aren't going to charge you for the conversion, but relocating to near an Orthodox synagogue and keeping kosher may be more expensive.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Ritual lapses of the Jews mentioned in the rebuke of the prophets? And why primarily focus on justice and lovingkindness and not rituals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Do the prophets ever rebuke the Jews for not being \"observant\" of all the \"Bain Adam Lamakom\" laws or any failings in these areas other than Avodah Zarah?</p>\n<p>I think Jeremiah does mention carrying burdens on Shabbos.

Not quite.</strong></p>\n<p>I think a change in how you view the Torah will provide the context to reach the correct conclusion. The gemara (e.g. Shabbat 105a), and the deeper sources (e.g. Zohar), <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J2NrV_1tVMA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">describe the Torah as Hashem commiting Himself to writing</a>. Therefore we view it as Him describing, from His point of view, His relationship with us, and therefore can be viewed as a love letter to mankind, especially His people who accepted the Torah, Israel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The first thing He tells us in the Midbar is that the action is non-negotiable. Most of the 613 commandments involve some sort of action or behaviour. They are actions and behaviours that serve Him, because they are His wants and needs in the relationship, and are therefore non-negotiable.</p>\n<p>This (correct) way of looking at the Torah - that it is about the relationship between Hashem and His creations, as e.g. Hoshea explains - now means things make sense, because every relationship has rules, boundaries, for the sake of doing right by each other. These rules and boundaries are based on the desires and needs of those involved.</p>\n<p>We cannot wait until we <em>understand</em> them, or until our heart is ready to perform them with feeling and desire, but we must start learning and doing them immediately. Working on the heart must begin immediately, but that is expected to take time, and maturity.</p>\n<p>Therefore the trajectory of our ever blossoming relationship with our God starts with the action, then gets to the heart, through all of the Tanach that He wrote for us and said to us.</p>\n<p>He first tells us about the action in Tanach (after our origins, and His side of the events of history), and the focus is on its non-negotiability. Sefer Devarim goes into this, and Moshe our Teacher does His best to burn into our souls how vitally important the Mitzvot are, while also beginning to reveal some of the heart behind things...</p>\n<p>After this, it gets more about the heart. The reason is not because the action and ritual should give way to the heart, but because the action <em>without</em> the heart is like a body without a soul. Back to our context of a relationship: a husband indeed should do the action of giving flowers, but it must also be accompanied by his love for his wife, and his desire to please her, in the context of her everpresence in his heart. Without that, it's next-to-worthless for her, and indeed can end up being a grave offense. Especially after the relationship is not young and new, but mature and developed.</p>\n<p>Even when the Nevi'im put a lot of emphasis on justice, corruption, and the interpersonal mitzvot, it is still in order to serve Him, because this is what <em>He</em> wants from His creations. It is just as much His will as the ritual ben-adam-leMakom mitzvot!</p>\n<p>So, the Nevi'im relay for us that our hearts are not in it enough, and we see a more personal side to Hashem, who is looking into our hearts constantly. While reminding us, throughout that the action is non-negotiable (\"If only they'd abandon Me, if it means they will do the Mitzvot\" - Eicha Rabbah on Yirmiyahu 16:11, indeed the Nevi'im are replete with exhortation to keep the Torah), He also tells us things like, a sacrifice without the heart is not what He wants (Hoshea 6:6).</p>\n<p>In the Ketuvim, it becomes very close and personal. Tehillim, love songs for Hashem. Shir Hashirim, the Kodesh Kodashim. King David telling King Shlomo to know the God of his father (I Chronicles 28:9).</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Now we can get to your questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Bli neder I will find specific examples, but hopefully what I have explained above has cleared up the misconception you have that the Nevi'im are not focusing on the action because they view it with less importance. Instead, they take it as given, and refer to it generally all over the place, with phrases such <code>תּוֹרָתִי לֹא שָׁמָרוּ</code> - they did not <em>keep</em> My Torah.</li>\n<li>The Nevi'im exhort us to serve Hashem with our hearts, because this is a real relationship of love, like a marriage. We may have been keeping the Mitzvot on the outside, but on the inside we were doing it without love or desire. Working on these aspects takes place in a more mature stage of our relationship, and thus is the focus of these later Nevi'im.</li>\n<li>Hillel is capturing all of the above in his statement. Don't <em>do</em> to others what you find <em>hateful</em>. Treat people properly <em>in the way you act</em>, and put <em>heart</em> into it (because you hate it when people make you feel alone by mistreating you, or even treating you <em>well</em> but without having you in their heart at all). This includes treating Hashem properly, including the ritual Mitzvot, as well as the interpersonal Mitzvot.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Nadav and Avihu versus Titus the Wicked entering the Holy of Holies\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are commentaries (for example the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.10.1?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.524.7&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Torah 524:7</a>) that explain that the sin of Nadav and Avihu was that they entered the Holy of Holies. This is just one opinion, and that is not the point here. What I was wondering was the following.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Shimon HaKohen, over at Yeshiva.org <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/27796\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentions</a> the Talmudic principle of \"אֵין שׁוֹטֶה נִפְגָּע\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.13b.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Shabbos 13b)</a> - a fool is not hurt.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kohen then quotes a Midrash Rabbah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Vayikra_Rabbah.20.5?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Vayikra Rabbah 20:5)</a> which relates the following story:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Will Aaron’s sons not be like his staff, that entered dry and emerged moist?’ The wicked Titus entered the chamber of the Holy of Holies with his sword drawn in his hand, stabbed the curtain, and his sword emerged full of blood. He entered in peace and emerged in peace. Aaron’s sons entered to sacrifice and emerged burned. That is what is written: “After the death of the two sons of Aaron, [when they approached before the Lord and they died].”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He quotes Rabbi Yitzchak Shelmkish of Galicia and explains that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כשאדם נכנס לבית הכנסת, עליו להרגיש כיצד יראה של רוממות עוטפת אותו, הלוא הוא נכנס כעת אל הקודש, \"בְּבֵית אֱלֹקִים נְהַל</p>\n<p>When a person enters the synagogue, he must feel how an awe of exaltation envelops him, he is now entering the Holy of Holies, \"the house of G-d\" (loose translation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Says Rabbi Kohen, Titus the Wicked was lacking this feeling. He did not feel any enthousiasm in entering the most holy place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טיטוס נכנס אל הקודש ויצא ממנו, והדבר לא הותיר בו שום רושם. הבעיה כאן היא לא של הקודש, הבעיה כאן היא בגברא, יש כלל <a href=\"https://%20https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.13b.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">'אין שוטה נפגע'</a> , טיטוס הוא שוטה, הוא לא שייך אל הקודש ולכן הוא לא נפעל ממנו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נדמה לי שבדברים הנפלאים הללו של רבי יצחק שמלקיש, רמוז עניינה של כל הפרשיה שלפנינו. פרשיית סדר העבודה מוקדשת לביאה אל הקודש, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.16.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"בְּזֹאת יָבֹא אַהֲרֹן אֶל הַקֹּדֶשׁ\"</a> , לא מוזכר בה יום הכיפורים אלא ברמז אף על פי שכל הפרשיה עוסקת ביום הכיפורים, כי מה שחשוב כעת להזכיר זה שכניסה אל הקודש דורשת הכנה ראויה, לא בכל עת ניתן לבוא אל הקודש, צריך להתכונן. אדם שנכנס אל הקודש צריך לדעת מהן המגבלות של העולם החומרי שהוא נמצא בו, מנגד מהו הגודל של המציאות האלקית, ולבסוף עליו לזהות היכן היא נקודת החיבור, מתי ראויה הנשמה הישראלית להיכנס אל הקודש מבלי להיפגם. לא להיות כמו בני אהרן שהדבקו בשורשם ועלו למעלה, אלא להתגדל ולהתפעל ויחד עם זאת להישאר שייכים לעולם הזה. יש כאן שיעור יסודי שמברר כיצד אנו נדרשים להדבק בקב\"ה.\nפרשת העריות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I have trouble understanding this explanation. I really like it, but it is hard for me to get hold on the idea that is conveyed here. Sure, Nadav and Avihu, as the Chiddushei HaRim says, were  righteous individuals, wanting to perform G-ds service. On the other hand, Titus, was extremely wicked and defiled the holy place.</p>\n<p>So, according to the above mentioned explanation, when a person feels that he is entering \"the House of G-d\", and his soul is connected on high, he is punished when defiling the Temple and when entering in the Holy of Holies and getting too close to G-d (there are also ideas that this was not the case anymore, because the Shechina left). However, when a rasha does this (a wicked person), he is not punished. Does this makes any sense?</p>\n<p>Are there any sources that explain this another way, or is someone able to explain this in a more easy-to-understand way?</p>\n\n\n",

The reason I ask is because my understanding is Halacha prohibits Jews from owning things made like the human form, even if not actual avodah zarah themselves.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I think it's not a good idea.\nTHere seem to be four halachic issues: benefitting from a dead body, tumah, not performing the mitzvah of burial, and the one you mentioned.</p>\n<p>Regarding benefitting from the dead, the Shulchan Aruch (YD 349, 1) rules that one may not benefit from a corpse, even of a non-Jew. However, looking at something for entertainment value is probably not considered benefit, because as a rule, \"sound, sight and smell\" are not considered benefit, except for some exceptions. Additionally, it would be an unusual form of benefit (שלא כדרך הנאתן) which would be permitted (ע' אגרות משה יו\"ד חלק א ס' רכט).</p>\n<p>As far as tumah, the Shulchan Aruch says that a kohein should avoid coming in contact with the dead body of a non-Jew by entering the same room (ohel) as the corpse. So if you have any friends who are kohanim, don't invite them over.</p>\n<p>Also, by retaining the head, you are preventing the mitzva of burial from being fulfilled. The chasam sofer (shu\"t OC 208) says this applies to the corpse of a non-Jew too. However, the yerushalmi (nazir 7, 1) says that burying a non-Jewish meis mitzva does not push away the issur tumah of a kohein or nazir, and the korban ha'eisa implies there is no mitzvah whatsoever. So this one may remain a matter of dispute.\nSee Ramban (devarim 21, 22) implies that there's no mitzva of kevura on non-Jewish corpses, but if you live in Israel there's a prohibition of לא תטמא את אדמתך.</p>\n<p>As far as retaining the human form, the chachmas adam (85, 2) is lenient regarding anything which nobody would worship. So there's certainly enough to rely on in that department.</p>\n\n\n",

However, I don't understand how chashad there is Medeoritah because the lashon of the Mishna that the Gemara is explaining is darkei shalom and that's obviously Derabbanan! Also, the Mishneh Berurah and Poskim in Siman 366 say that it is mutar for a very good reason and we don't matir isurei Deoritah for a very good reason. Therefore this understanding of chashad being Deoritah is not accepted.</li>\n<li>Igrot Moshe 4:82 is a major chidush and many argue on him (very lengthy argument on Rav Moshe from both Rabbi’s and that's for another time).</li>\n<li>The sources I listed including: Beitza 9a, Geonim, Rif, and Rosh Beitza 9:14, Shu”t Pnei Yehoshua 2:2 still all hold its derabanan.</li>\n<li>Yabia Omer Yoreah Deah 6:8 (and any teshuvot that Rav Ovadia has on Marit Ayin) has nothing to do with whether Marit Ayin is deorita or derabbanan, and was just talking about not applying Marit Ayin to Derabbanan’s like with the parve milk and chicken, but it doesn’t tell me if its midin deoritah or derabbanan.\nBoth Rabbanim concluded that Rav Ovadia holds Marit Aiyn is mederabbanan.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Overall, besides Rav Moshe (according to my knowledge and the 2 big Rabbanim whom I spoke to) Marit Ayin is derabbanan. This is clear from the Gemara, Rambam, and Shulchan Aruch from all the cases mentioned there.</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>See Igros Moshe (OC vol II, siman 40 and 64) where he explains that there are two distinct concepts of maris ayin.</p>\n<p>One concept is based on והייתם נקיים, that one may not do actions which make others suspect he is violating a torah prohibition.</p>\n<p>The second that when one seems to violate a prohibition which does not seem so bad to the general public, he causes others to be lenient too; this issue is only a problem with prohibitions that others may treat leniently, not something which is publicly known to be a severe prohibition. (this second one seems to be drabanan)</p>\n<p>(Incidentally, Rabbi J.B. Soloveitchik claimed that based on והייתם נקיים, one is forbidden to say lashon hara about himself. The Chafetz Chaim, however, writes that it is permitted to do so, so it is possible that he didn't consider it a prohibition at all, just good advice.)</p>\n\n\n",

The Ben Ish Chai had fallen into some monetary difficulties but wanted to publish his books, so he thought of sending an ancient Torah scroll he had to Baron Rothschild in hopes of the Baron giving him some money in return. The method of the \"transaction\" was supposed to be done in a manner that would not be considered directly selling the scroll, since technically he was gifting the scroll to the Baron and was not conditioning the gift on reception of payment. The Ben Ish Chai had originally requested that Rachel, the daughter of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Sassoon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Albert Sassoon</a>, intercede on his behalf, but after receiving the scroll she informed the Ben Ish Chai that it would be a waste of time.

The Rebbe (Likutei Sichos 1; 249) explains this to refer to the level of chochmah within every Jew (of the 10 bechinos one's soul is made of). The Tanya (chapters 18-19) explains that this bechina of chochma is the innate level in every Jew that is connected and strives to re-unite with Hashem echad.</p>\n\n\n",

See Shulchan Aruch 51:12.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>First of all, there's no 51:12 in Orach Chaim, at least not in the Mechaber's Shulchan Aruch. The correct reference is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.53.19?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">53:19</a>, and here's what it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>'אפי' יחיד יכול לעכב ולומר איני רוצ' שפלוני יהיה חזן אם לא שכבר הסכים עליו מתחיל</p>\n<p>Even an individual can object and say that he doesn't want X to be the chazzan, unless he agreed to have him to begin with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To which Rema adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודוקא שיהי' לאותו יחיד טעם הגון ע\"פ טובי העיר אבל בלאו הכי אין היחיד יכול למחות בש\"ץ [מהרי\"ו סי' ס'] ואם הוא שונאו יכול למחות בו קודם שהסכים עליו [מהר\"ם פדואה סי' ק\"ד ומהרי\"ק שורש מ\"ד]</p>\n<p>Only if that individual has a reason [for his opposition] that appears to the community leaders to be reasonable. Otherwise, an individual can't protest [the appointment of] a shliach tzibbur (Mahari Weil, sec. 60). If he is his enemy, he can object before he agreed to his [appointment] (Maharam Padua, sec. 104, and Maharik, Shoresh 44).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>[That last point means that if he originally agreed that the fellow should be appointed and then later on they had a falling out, his protest is ignored (Magen Avraham).]</p>\n<p>That said, both Taz and Magen Avraham say that most congregations customarily appoint a board whose decisions in this area are final, or they follow the majority of the shul dues-payers. (Furthermore, Magen Avraham notes that nowadays the chazzan isn't really exempting anyone's obligation anyway, since everyone is able to say the Amidah, so that the argument that \"we don't get along and therefore he won't have me in mind during his prayers\" doesn't really hold water.)</p>\n\n\n",

Rav Hamnuna said to him: That is Yom Kippur, when there is no eating or drinking, and so the Torah said: Honor it with a clean garment. Rashi there says since it says וקראת לשבת עונג it implies that לקדוש ה is not going on the Shabbat part but on Yom kippur, that you need to give Yom Kippur some kavod.

We say like this in Perek Eilu Devarim that everyone agrees that we need לָכֶם, and it also says לה, if so  ולִקְדוֹשׁ ה' is not talking about Shabbat, rather it's referring to Yom Kipur which is also called a “Shabbat.” The Rif (Yoma 2b), Rosh (Yoma 8:9), Meiri (Shabbat 119a), Orchot Chaim (Hilchot Yom Kippur 27), and Manhig (Hilchot Fast of Yom Kippur 27), all bring this halacha of kavod Yom Kippur which is achieved by wearing clean and nice clothing, etc.</p>\n<p>The Mordechai (Yoma 725) and Rema 610:4 bring the practice of setting a nice tablecloth on the table for Yom Kippur.</p>\n<p>The Mamar Mordechai 610:3 and the Sdei Chemed (אס\"ד מע' יום הכיפורים א, יז) talk about bringing kavod to Yom Kippur by putting sefarim on the table to learn Torah which is the ultimate kavod.

What is the connection between the lack of dough rising and the Isur of <em>chometz</em>?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As the Haggadah states, the Matza is in order to <strong>remember</strong> the dough of our ancestors. Here's a story that is given on this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A great King was touring his kingdom, when he happened upon a fair maiden, the daughter of a simple farmer. He fell madly in love and proposed marriage to her, and she and her father accepted. The King's love was insatiable, and he simply couldn't wait to be married to her. He badgered the royal staff day in day out to hurry up with their preparations for the wedding constantly.</p>\n<p>Finally the day of the wedding arrives, and it's all going too slow. When sitting down for the wedding banquet, he's finally had enough. He runs into the kitchen and says \"that's it, no more waiting, bring out the food!\". The staff try to complain that the food is not ready, and the bread hasn't even risen yet\". He isn't having any of it, and they bring out the food, and serve these flat, undone pieces of cracker instead of bread. The banquet proceeds and then they are married. The fair maiden, during the wedding, takes a couple of these crackers and keeps them safe.</p>\n<p>It didn't take long, but soon they got into their first fight as husband and wife. During the fight, the King's anger is very great, and he yells at her \"just remember that you were just a poor farmer's daughter, you are only here because of my good grace!\". She storms off, but soon returns, bringing some of the crackers she kept from the wedding, and she shows them to him. She says \"I may be a poor farmer's girl, but remember how you fell in love with me? Don't forget your love! Your love was so great, that you couldn't even wait an extra 20 minutes to marry me, and rushed through the wedding, and here are the crackers you had them serve us on that day\".</p>\n<p>Seeing the crackers indeed brought him back to his senses, and he remembered his great love for her, and they reconciled. Whenever the King was feeling the challenge of being married, she only had to bring out these \"crackers\", and he would remember his eternal love for her, and their marriage was a great success!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, in order to understand the point of the prohibition and its connection with the positive aspect, one must look at the pasuk, and the following pasuk, and the way the sages and the Haggadah explain what it's all about.</p>\n<p>The following <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.13.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pasuk</a> states</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִגַּדְתָּ לְבִנְךָ בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא לֵאמֹר בַּעֲבוּר זֶה עָשָׂה\nיְהֹוָה לִי בְּצֵאתִי מִמִּצְרָיִם׃</p>\n<p>And you shall tell over to your son on that day, saying, \"Because of this Hashem did to me when I went out of Egypt\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We say this when the matza is in front of us, to say \"because of this\", i.e. because of the remembrance of the great love Hashem has for us<sup>1</sup>, and it must be personal - we must really view as though we personally were there, and experienced that great love, because indeed we did<sup>2</sup>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא אֶת־אֲבוֹתֵינוּ בִּלְבַד גָּאַל הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא, אֶלָּא\nאַף אוֹתָנוּ גָּאַל עִמָּהֶם</p>\n<p>It was not only our ancestors whom the Holy One redeemed; He redeemed\nus too along with them</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, because of the fact that we only had matza, and no leaven then, we must recreate this, and strengthen it, on Pesach. We must have matza, and no leaven, בַּיּוֹם הַהוּא\n.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1. and how the Matza is a reminder of that for us; see Pele Yoetz 88:3; note also that this pasuk is invoked against the wicked son, to remind us of the reciprocal nature of this love; see Midrash Sekhel Tov, Shemot 13:8<br />\n2. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Rabban_Gamliel%27s_Three_Things.7?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">בְּכָל־דּוֹר וָדוֹר</a>, see Peninei Halakhah, Pesach 15:9</sup></p>\n\n\n",

The haste, spoken of here, was not on thy part, but on Egypt’s part, for so it states, (Exodus 12:33) “And Egypt was urgent upon the people [hastening to send them out of the land]” (Sifrei Devarim 130:6; cf. Berakhot 9a).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a difference between the ceremony the Jews conducted on the night of the Exodus, and the ceremony we were commanded to do every year afterwards in remembrance of it. That ceremony did involve eating matzot, but the fact that they did not have time to bake bread for the road was not part of the commandment. Afterwards, G-d commanded us to eat matzah for seven days to commemorate that aspect of the Exodus. Ramban Gamliel is telling us that if one did not mention this, he did not fulfill his obligation, based on the verse in Deuteronomy.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shibolei_HaLeket_on_Pesach_Haggadah%2C_Magid%2C_Rabban_Gamliel%27s_Three_Things.4.2?lang=he&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shibolei HaLeket on the Haggada</a>, who answers that Hashem knew that the Bnei Yisrael would leave in a hurry, and therefore commanded them based on the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם תאמר הרי אנו אומרים מצה זו שאנו אוכלין על שום מה על שום שלא הספיק בציקו של אבותינו להחמיץ <strong>כך פירושו מכיון שהקב\"ה רואה את העתיד צופה ומביט מה שעתיד להיות על כן צום מבערב על הנס של מחר</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He also notes in the beginning of the passage that the command that they received in Egypt not to eat chametz for the week only applied to future years, as the Torah implies that they would have baked chametz if they had the time. It is that lack of time we remember (or \"pre-member\") in the command not to eat chametz all Pesach.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the significance of Deuteronomistic and Priestly edits to the Torah once it was canonized?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am a beginner in my studies and was researching a question on why the  Israelites didn’t get circumcised in the wilderness when I found an article that left me a bit confused as to whether the Torah has been changed over time.\nThe article I found goes into a schematic look at the Composition history of this passage and it explains that the earliest account of the passage has Joshua circumcising the men of Israel of his own accord. Then it mentions a Deuteronomistic Redaction where YHWH commands the circumcision.  The article further talks about Deuteronomistic revisions and “glosses” regarding Who was actually circumcised and that comments were added to change Joshua’s circumcision from Israelites who left Egypt to their children. The article provides information about Deuteronomy edits that suggest that an older layer of Dtr in Deuteronomy and Joshua that had Israelites who left Egypt entering the land and later edits made it a two generation schematic. To make matters more confusing, the article introduces Priestly material once the Torah become canonized and mentions the addition and subtraction of verses to clear up contradictions/ conflicts.\nThis has left me wondering if the Torah has been changed once it was canonized and what other changes were made.</p>\n<p>Here is the article:\nDavid Frankel, \"Why Didn’t the Israelites Circumcise in the Wilderness?\" TheTorah.com (2021). <a href=\"https://thetorah.com/article/why-didnt-the-israelites-circumcise-in-the-wilderness\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://thetorah.com/article/why-didnt-the-israelites-circumcise-in-the-wilderness</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Rambam's <a href=\"https://web.oru.edu/current_students/class_pages/grtheo/mmankins/drbyhmpg_files/GBIB766RabbLit/Chapter9Maimonides13Princ/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">principles of faith</a>, we find:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Principle 7</p>\n<p>I believe by complete faith that the prophesy of Moses our teacher,\nmay peace rest upon him, was true and that he was the father of all\nprophets that preceded him as well as all that came after him.</p>\n<p>Principle 8</p>\n<p>I believe by complete faith that the whole Torah now found in our\nhands was the exact same one given to Moses, may peace rest upon him.</p>\n<p>Principle 9</p>\n<p>I believe by complete faith that this is the Torah, and it shall not\nbe changed and it shall not be replaced with another from the Creator,\nblessed be His name.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>These will be accepted by “for those who base their lives on Jewish law and tradition”. Number 8 is clear in answering your question.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I have a lot of respect for articles written on thetorah.com . Having said that, a lot of articles on thetorah.com do not fit within \"Orthodoxy\" as we currently have it. Orthodoxy considers that the Torah was more or less given as a complete unit either by the time Moses died, or by the time that Joshua died. The article you cite does not believe that the Torah as a book was given as a complete unit, but rather the Torah is a series of edits or layers that were eventually merged into a book that we now have as a complete unit.</p>\n<p>The reality is we have zero concrete proof for either argument. Even with a close read of the Biblical account one can come away convinced of both arguments, that either the Torah was given as a complete unit, or that it was given and edited in stages. For example the books of Ezra and Nehemiah are convinced that the Torah they have is a complete unit given by Moses. But when you read the book of Kings and a copy of \"the Torah\" was found after some construction at the Temple, and somehow the current priests and kings can't tell if what's in that Torah is legit or not. The only way that can be the case is if the Torah they currently had was incomplete, or they didn't have a surviving Torah at all.</p>\n<p>So if someone chooses to believe that the Torah was given as a complete unit, they won't discuss the priestly or Deutero authors, they will discuss the \"Priestly voice\" such as Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks does in his book on Leviticus. And they will view all priestly material as speaking from the viewpoint of the priests and during these Torah sections the priestly voice is just one of many voices reflected in the Torah.</p>\n<p>If someone chooses to believe that the Torah was compiled over stages, then there become serious implications. The Israelites in the desert didn't circumcise their kids because they didn't know they were supposed to.</p>\n<p>Personally I don't think either of these situations is \"the truth\" and that reality lies somewhere in the middle. For example, I can completely believe that Moses received the Torah as a complete unit, but then Moses elected elders and judges and had to hand over that Torah for them to adjudicate and decide law. The Torah was always a framework to be given over to Moses and the judges to use and adapt to ongoing situations. Therefore it wouldn't surprise me that after a few generations these different uses of the Torah needed to be tied back into the original source and put together as a unit at some point. And so I don't view the Torah as a series of edits, but rather a series of legitimate collections of the Torah in the different communities as they received it. The Torah according to the Levites/Priests after a few generations is going to be it's own distinctive voice as they will focus on the laws of holiness, sacrifices, purity, etc. To say this \"source\" is just a series of edits doesn't do justice to the legitimacy of the source.</p>\n<p>For the question of whether the Torah was a complete unit or not, you will have to decide for yourself. But even if you do decide to accept that the Torah was not given as a complete unit, I would encourage you to not immediately jump to the conclusion that many atheists do that the Torah is then somehow \"fake.\" I don't believe that anyone at any point in Israelite history viewed the Torah as fake, even when they had multiple different copies of it in their hands. The Essene Community in Qumran had collected many different versions of the Torah and they did not believe that the different versions meant the Torah was fake. Rather they saw all the different received traditions as a window into the Torah and its truth.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a book that addresses the single question of the Torah as a complete unit vs a compiled book, you can read <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/1906764131\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah from Heaven by Normon Solomon</a>.</p>\n<p>If you decide to accept the idea that the Torah and possibly other Biblical books could be compilations, then I highly recommend the book <a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/082760775X\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">How to Read the Bible by Marc Zvi Brettler</a>. It presents the known textual evidence and archaeological record in a very accessible manner. So far it's been one of my favorite books on the topic.</p>\n<p>It's worth noting that while I read and support all honest attempts at understanding the Bible and its history; I find the Documentary Hypothesis to be lacking at times and worthy of being challenged. For example they divide the texts into \"sources\" but now they are arguing over the sources and whether there should be more or less sources. And often times they make grand assumptions like saying this part of the Torah doesn't know what's happening in some other part, but the reality is the Torah comments on so much in very subtle ways that these secular scholars don't notice because it's not obvious enough for them. I heard someone say that the Israelite Children who were thrown into the sea were not known by the rest of the Torah since this ethnic cleansing isn't \"brought up again in the Torah narrative.\" But such an idea could not be farther from the truth in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n",

Also, it's explained elsewhere that the initial act of creation was an \"Awakening from above\", without any efforts from humans.

The best link to that section of <strong>תשובות מהרש\"ל ס' לז</strong> is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Teshuvot_Maharshal.37.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> where he writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אכן תדע שיש חילוק בין פרשה סתומה לסתומה כי פרשה סתומה היא סותמת העניין של הפרשה שלפניה אע\"פ שאותה פרשה שלפניה היא פרשה פתוח' כי בלאו זה צריכין אני לחקור וליתן לב מה הפרש יש בין פר' פתוח' לפרשה סתומה כי רבותינו ז\"ל הקדמוני' לא נתנו סיבה אלא לפרשיו' מה היו הפרשיות משתמשו' כדי ליתן ריוח למשה להתבונן בין פרש' לפרש' כו' אבל בשימוש הפתוחה והסתומה לא הזכירו אם לא תאמר שאין צריך חקירה על זה <strong>כי הוא מובן מעצמו וכשמם כן הוא שפתוחה אין לה חבור עם מה שלמעלה והוא עניין חלוק בפני עצמו וכאילו התחיל פה וסתומה מחוברת וסתו' לדברים שלפניה ואינה חלוקה אלא ליתן ריוח בין הפרשיות</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>where he basically states that while חז\"ל never mentioned a distinction between the underlying meaning for the two types of parshios, it is self-evident that a פתוחה starts a brand new topic and a סתומה is a lesser break and more topically connected to the parsha that precedes it. Best to see the full section there to get a better sense of all the nuances. He does mention shortly after this quote that sometimes the divisions might depend on hidden reasons and סודות that were only known to earlier generations.</p>\n<p>Many years ago I attempted to make brief synopses of each פרשה פתוחה וסתומה in the Chumash to see if there were any patterns. In many cases the words of the Maharshal worked very well as adjacent סתומות fit between one פתוחה and the next פתוחה as neat topically connected sub-chapters within a larger general topic covered by the פתוחה.

This means that as long as it is in a place where it could be seen, this commandment is being violated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואע\"פ שאינו רואה דהא לא כתיב לא תראה חמץ אלא לא יראה משמע לא יהא לך חמץ במקום הראוי לראיה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thankfully, after a bit of digging, I came across the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Chinukh.20.1.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Chinuch 20:1</a> who applies these two differing views to a case of a blind person. Rambam would say that he has not transgressed anything as he can't see the chametz. The Rosh, however, would maintain that it is sufficient in that, theoretically it can be seen. The Minchas Chinuch then reconsiders and concludes that the Rambam would conceivably agree with the Rosh that as the chametz are completely visible, the fact that the blind owner cannot see it is irrelevant and he has transgressed the commandment.</p>\n\n\n",

The\nstory is told that as Rav Chaim ben Atar (the Ohr Hachayim) walked\ndown the steps, he slipped and fainted. The Rabbis laid him on the\nfloor and tried to revive him and meanwhile the stone stair.</p>\n<p>Where he had slipped was dislodged, revealing that underneath it,\nthere had been placed a volume of the Rambam’s Mishnah Torah. When the\nOhr Hachayim regained consciousness, he denounced the Karaites for\ntheir flagrant disrespect, and decreed that they would be responsible\nfor the full tax demanded by the mayor. Furthermore, he cursed them\nthat they would never have a tenth man to make a minyan.</p>\n<p>Although certain elements of the story are undoubtedly correct (the\nBritish consul, <strong>James Finn, recorded a century later - in 1853 - that\n“it was a judgement from Heaven on the Karaites that they were never\nable to muster a prayer quorum</strong>”), the imposing of the full tax on the\nKaraites would have been extremely unlikely given that their entire\ncommunity consisted of a handful of indigent individuals and there was\nno expectation that it was going to grow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am looking to substantiate this original story, this curse, this quote from James Finn, and if there is any evidence of this curse today. The latter seems unlikely (although there may be discussion as to why the curse has been lifted which will also be on topic!), <strong>so I am mainly hoping for the exact source of the quote from James Finn, and the original mention of the episode with the Ohr Hachaim Hakodesh.</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>There's a Karaite synagogue/Museum in Jerusalem that I've visited.

They had never been considered as Russian subjects, and their number was so insignificant that they had been hitherto overlooked. It was always asserted of them by the other (Rabbinical) Jews that it was judgement from heaven on the Karaites that they were never able to muster a <em>minyan</em>, <em>i.e.</em> a quorum of ten adults of families, for forming a lawful congregation according to Jewish ordinance.

R, Fisher states that there are two different vantage points regarding the interaction between the ארון and כפרת.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The ארון is the main component and the כפרת accompanies and serves it <strong>OR</strong></li>\n<li>The כפרת is the main component and the ארון accompanies and serves it</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It could be that the second vantage point is being stressed at the beginning of פרשת אחרי מות.</p>\n<p>Not mentioned in the article but very connected and interesting to note is that the only time the כפרת is mentioned in Tanach outside of the Chumash is when David is described as giving Shlomo the blueprints for the future mikdash:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(דברי הימים א כח:יא) וַיִּתֵּן דָּוִיד לִשְׁלֹמֹה בְנוֹ אֶת תַּבְנִית הָאוּלָם וְאֶת בָּתָּיו וְגַנְזַכָּיו וַעֲלִיֹּתָיו וַחֲדָרָיו הַפְּנִימִים <strong>וּבֵית הַכַּפֹּרֶת</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, the commentaries interpret בֵ֥ית הַכַּפֹּֽרֶת as <strong>קדש הקדשים</strong> (<em>and it's strikingly not mentioned as a בית הארון or בית העדות</em>).</p>\n<p><strong>I will also take a shot at venturing a different idea</strong> that specifically addresses your dilemma and even takes into account the notion that the ארון and לוחות are the primary components.</p>\n<p>This focuses on the need for a form of covering or protection for those who are fit to encounter G-d's presence so that it won't be a direct exposure to גילוי שכינה which no mortal can survive. Once the לוחות were placed in the ארון there was always a sense of danger for someone coming in direct contact.</p>\n<p>Indeed there are extra outer layers of cover for the לוחות in addition to the כפרת such as the כרובים and the פרכת - the latter mainly serving as a wall or partition to the קדש הקדשים but even serving as an actual cover and wrapping for the ארון while the משכן would travel.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of אחרי מות it can be said that the כפרת cover is a close as one can get to the core when the kohen approaches it and sprinkles the blood of the sacrifices upon the כפרת. So here the dual meaning of a cover and a tool for atonement (כפרה) are implied.</p>\n<p>When the כפרת is first introduced in פרשת תרומה and we are told that this would be the focal point where G-d would communicate with Moshe during the travels in the desert - perhaps this also hints to the idea that this is as close as Moshe gets and no closer.</p>\n<p>In אחרי מות, we are also told the key line <strong>בענן</strong> אראה על הכפרת - that G-d will appear upon the כפרת in a cloud - also a notion of covering (<em>and possibly referring to the cloud-smoke of the קטורת</em>).  While this notion appears in a number of places in Tanach, there is an added element here which will connect this section to a critical point in פרשת כי תשא. We learn at the end of this section that this service is to be performed every year on <strong>Yom Kippur</strong>. Our sages tell us that the day Moshe received the 2nd set of <strong>לוחות</strong> (<em>and on which G-d revealed the 13 attributes of mercy</em>) coincided with <strong>Yom Kippur</strong> - each parsha referring to a time of a dramatic atonement and referring to an encounter with an important element of the ארון structure (<em>the כפרת and לוחות</em>). See שמות לג:יב - לד:ט but specifically the words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושכתי <strong>כפי</strong> עליך - indicating a <strong>covering</strong> - note the similarity of the word כפי to כפרת</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and then</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וירד ה' <strong>בענן</strong> ויתיצב עמו שם - noting the appearance of G-d in a <strong>cloud</strong> (<em>interesting that this בענן and the aforementioned one are the only times this word occurs in Tanach with the trop of זקף-קטן</em>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Possibly offering support for the idea that these two parshios inform each other in their notion of the need for a shrouded encounter with G-d are the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.189\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on מלכים א פרק ח (סימן קפט)</a> discusses each of the critical two wordings above in close proximity</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.33.22?with=Ibn%20Ezra\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra on שמות לג:כב</a> interprets ושכתי כפי as <em>\"like a <strong>cloud covers</strong> the light of the sun\"</em> (based on (איוב לו:לב) על כפים כסה אור)</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Abarbanel_on_Torah%2C_Exodus.33.12.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel there in כי תשא</a> agrees with the interpretation of the Ibn Ezra and also states:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ועוד יסוכך עליו בענן הכבוד שמשם היה יוצא הדבור למשה בהיותו באהל ועל זה אמר ושכתי כפי עליך עד עברי רוצה לומר שילוה אליו העזר האלקי מענן כבודו לעזרו בהשגת הדרכים והמדות ההמה כי <strong>מלת כף יאמר על ענן</strong> כמו (איוב ל״ו:ל״ב) על כפים כסה אור</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Prophecy is clearly being offered as a routine alternative to the Canaanites' various fortune-telling practices. And this is Moses telling them what to do <em>when they enter the land</em>, i.e. starting a few days after his death. Not about something that would happen over a millennium later.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>When you enter the land</strong>, don't do horrible things like those nations do -- no putting kids through fire, or sorcery, or divination ... or inquiring of the dead ... God finds all that despicable. Just have faith in God. <em>Those</em> people would use all sorts of diviners and sorcerers, <strong>but that's not what God set up for you: [when you have a question about the future], God will send you a prophet from your brethren, just like I was, and listen to him. [And not to a soothsayer, augur, or whatnot.]</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you look at any of the classical Jewish lists of commandments (such as Maimonides), the commandments here are counted as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not put kids through fire</li>\n<li>Do not inquire of the dead</li>\n<li>Do not fortune-tell by these various other Canaanite ways</li>\n<li><strong>Do</strong> follow the guidance of a prophet.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>None of these were one-time commandments; they are constant ones.</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Tuvia Singer has pointed out; there is no commandment \"go listen to the Messiah\", nor does there need to be. There's already a commandment to listen to any appropriate prophecy (which applied to Moses, Nathan, Ido, Elijah, Isaiah, Jeremiah, etc.). Nor is there a commandment \"go accept a Messiah when he arrives\" because we believe it will be so blazingly obvious, it would be like a command \"believe that your right hand is your right hand.\"</p>\n\n\n",

However,\naccording to the view that this blessing is only made on grain\nproducts, the food eaten in this situation must be something made out\nof one of the five grains (barley, rye, oats, wheat, spelt). The Magen\nAvraham (O.C. 283:11) also allows any product of the five grains. The\nSha'arei Teshuva quotes the Shut Ginat Veradim, who frowns upon the\npractice of making kiddush in the synagogue and then eating cake to\nfulfill the requirement of a meal. However, he then cites the Birchei\nYoseif that such is the custom and there is nothing wrong with it.\nFinally, the Mishna Berura (O.C. 283:25) claims that Rav Akiva Eiger's\npersonal view is that wine should not be used</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Gil Student has an article entitled <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2021/12/when-is-a-kiddush-not-a-kiddush-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">When Is A Kiddush Not A Kiddush?</a> .</p>\n<p>He quotes a teshuvah of Rav Moshe Feinstein (Iggeros Moshe, Orach Chaim 4:63).

    "content": "# Where is God in Judaism?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am actually a Sunni Muslim, only asking this question out of my interest in Jewish interpretations of God as they are similar and distinct in many ways with the Islamic ones.</p>\n<p>So in Sunni Islam, there are 2 main, equally valid (Valid here doesn't mean equally correct, it just means equally valid, or blatantly speaking: both opinions aren't heretical) opinions regarding this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The majority opinion, اللهُ مَوْجُوْدٌ بِلاَ مَكَانٍ: God is present beyond place. This opinion simply states that since God is the creator of everything, he is the creator of space and all the changes that happen within it, the creator of time as well. The opinion holds that since God is transcendent beyond all creation, he is transcendent above being bound by space and the 6 directions as well as he created them in the first place.</li>\n<li>The minority opinion, based on the Quranic verse: الرَّحْمَنُ عَلَى الْعَرْشِ اسْتَوَىٰ, \"the Most Merciful established on the throne.\": This opinion isn't exactly an opinion but more of a negation on holding an opinion to begin with. They say that God says in the Quran that he is above the throne, and we believe it. How he is above the throne? What is the modality of the throne? What does above mean? We refuse to interpret it at all and simply accept the verse on face value and don't get into its meaning at all and say \"only God knows\". Those who hold the prior opinion simply do a different interpretation of this verse that does not have to do with where God is.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>There are other opinions, but they are either considered heretical or amount to disbelief by the standards of orthodox sunnism. That, or they ultimately amount to either of the two I mentioned with only slight details diferring.</p>\n<p>I was wondering what the Jewish view on this is. Is it the same or similar to either of the two opinions I mentioned? Does it entail a physical body for God and binding within a place, or something else entirely?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Torah study vs armed defense\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Midrash tells us that only Torah study protects the Jews:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yehudah HaNasi sent Rabbi Assi and Rabbi Ammi on a mission to organize religious education in the cities of the Land of Israel. They came to a city and said to the people, “Bring us the guardians of the city.” The people then fetched the captain of the guard and the magistrate. The rabbis exclaimed, “You call these the guardians of the city! They are its destroyers!”  [By that they meant:  If you rely only on armed guards and judges, you will be lulled into a false sense of security, and the city will certainly be destroyed.]  The people then asked, “Who, then, are the “guardians of the city”“?  The rabbis answered: They are the teachers of Torah and Mishnah.  It says in the Book of Joshua:\nYou will study Torah day and night. [Joshua 1:8]\" [Lamentations Rabbah, Prologue II]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Today, this argument is being loudly repeated at high levels in the State of Israel, specifically negating the role of the Israeli Defense Forces in protecting the people against the savagery of surrounding Arabs.  This angers many who respond, \"Where was Torah study protection on October 7th?\"</p>\n<p>And Chazal does say, in many places:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If someone comes to kill you, rise early and kill him first. [Berakhot 58a and 62b; Yoma 85b; Sanhedrin 72a; Zohar, Toldot 4:26; Midrash Tanchuma Buber, Pinchas 3:1, 4:1.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's tempting to conclude that you need a good dose of both Torah study and armed defense.

However, the letter hei is the exception which demonstrates how Hashem did not experience any strain or fatigue as a result of having created heaven and earth.</p>\n<p>He also offers a more esoteric, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.4?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.2.4.8&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">kabbalistic approach</a>, noting how the letter hei is the last letter used in Hashem's four letter name. As such, it appears small as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>it was emanated from the energy which is part of the attribute of אלוקים, and it was this part of G-d’s “energy” which created the universe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.4?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.2.4.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> similarly picks up on these two points of the Rabbeinu Bachye.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>First of all, there are many letters in The Scriptures, which, according to tradition are mandatory either written smaller, or larger than the surrounding text. For each one there are explanations given.\nRegarding this instance, our Sages <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.4?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Menachot.29b.10&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachot 29b</a> teach us that G'd created this world with the letter \"heh\" and they read the word as be-heh-boreom = \"He created it with the letter Heh\". That may explain the small \"heh\" (although I have not seen that explicitely).\nAlternatively, our Sages <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.4?lang=he&aliyot=0&p2=Midrash_Aggadah%2C_Genesis.2.4.3&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Medrash Agada</a> also tell us that the letters of this word can be formed to read \"Abraham\", as if to say that the world was mainly created for the sake of Abraham and his descendants i.e. The Jewish People. It could be (again my conjecture) that since Abraham was initially called Abram, with the \"heh\" added later, by writing the \"heh\" smaller, one can read both versions in this word.</p>\n\n\n",

Especially because I have <strong>not</strong> had a chance to review all the sources in depth, which would be a very big job.</p>\n<h4>Peninei Halacha Simchat Habayit Uvirchato 4:15 on getting married to someone one isn't attracted to</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If one spouse will not be attracted to the other, then it is not permitted to get married, as one will not be able to fulfil one's duties regarding <em>Onah</em>.</li>\n<li>If neither are attractive (see 2 bullet points down on whether this even makes sense), but would like to get married and try to create a loving marriage and family, this is considered a very great mitzva<sup>1</sup>.</li>\n<li>This is discussing situations of one or both being homosexual, but the logic would seem to be similar for this situation. As always, consult an Orthodox Rabbi for practical situations (I am mostly theorizing), but I strongly suspect that they will encourage anyone to try to get married!</li>\n<li>There are no easy guidelines to this, and it's not obvious that a physical or mental disability will mean <em>nobody</em> will be attracted to them*, as everyone has a soul mate<sup>2</sup>, and these things are subjective, and everyone is different<sup>3</sup>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ibid 6:3 regarding genetic diseases that could affect the born children:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>If one has a genetic disease that could be passed on to his children, there is a disagreement, with many holding he is exempt from the mitzva of having children, and many holding that no, it still counts as populating the world (especially if they can do IVF, and test the embryos for the disorders before implantation - one should spend up to 20% of his wealth to do this, based on Rema SA OH 656:1 - however, R' Auerbach concludes more research needs to be done)<sup>4</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Ibid 6:5 regarding the obligation to marry and procreate if one is incapable of raising children</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>One who is mentally or psychologically ill, and therefore incapable of shouldering the responsibility of care for children (something to discuss with one's Rabbi), is exempt from the mitzva to procreate. Even though Rav Melamed speaks about mental and psychological illness here, he is basing it on what he wrote in 5:7 and 5:9**, which discuss more generally one's obligation be able to support a family before starting one, so perhaps we can infer from this that this would also apply to <em>physical</em> disabilities, if they would make it impossible for him to be a responsible husband or father<sup>5,6,7</sup>.</li>\n<li>However, those sources explain that such a person, for other reasons<sup>8</sup>, shouldn't delay marriage beyond 24 (or 25), so only a very competent halachic authority should make such a decision. Either way, there seems to be far less reason to not get married, vs. not have children.</li>\n<li>Therefore Rav Melamed holds that when it is possible to be married, but he is exempt from having children for these reasons, one should use contraception, such as IUD, based on R' Auerbach and Minchat Shlomo 3:103:2, in such a case.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: One shouldn't marry someone one isn't attracted to, but that doesn't seem to imply that people should stop looking for a spouse just because they think <em>they</em> are unattractive*.</p>\n<p>One should not have children if one is mentally unfit to do so, and quite possibly this is the case also if one is physically unfit (if one improves, this will no longer apply).</p>\n<p>If one is a <em>saris petzu'a daka</em> by man made means<sup>7</sup>, then one may not get married to a born Jewess (but may marry a convert, if she agrees), but generally physical and mental unfitness is not necessarily a reason to avoid marriage (it <em>may</em>*** be a reason to avoid relations, which <em>may</em> be a reason to get divorced/not marry<sup>9</sup>, see ibid 6:4:3 on HIV).

Do our sources bring this up anywhere (even if the final ruling is not to change) so I can review the discussions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>There is a discussion I found <a href=\"https://www.meshivat-nefesh.org.il/post-445/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (in Hebrew) regarding changing pesukim in general, and the person then applies this to changing Birkat Kohanim to feminine for the reasons brought below.</p>\n<p>I will try to translate and add/delete some stuff to make it flow better:</p>\n<p>In the Mishnah in Megillah 10:4, the Mishnah lists several matters written in the Torah and the Prophets regarding which the question arises whether it is appropriate to read them in public. The Mishnah also discusses whether it is appropriate to translate them during the reading into a language understood by the general public, as was customary in synagogues. Among other things, the Mishnah mentions the incident of Reuven, which is read as it is but not translated, and the incident of Tamar, which is read and translated.</p>\n<p>Regarding, Birkat Kohanim the Mishnah says, \"It is neither read nor translated,\" but the Rif and the Rosh bring another version of the Mishnah which says, \"It is read but not translated.\" This means that Birkat Kohanim is not translated when read in public. From this, it can be understood that there is extra caution in saying Birkat Kohanim and we can infer that this would also apply in changing the wording of the pasuk from masculine to feminine.</p>\n<p>The Gemara (there) briefly states that the reason for this is because it says ' ישא, and Rashi explains that there is a concern that those hearing the translation might think that Hashem shows favoritism to Bnei Yisrael, although it says, \"אשר לא ישא פנים ולא יקח שחד.\" In our context, note that the Mishnah deals with the reading of verses and the translation of verses into Aramaic in public. In the case of a father's blessing to his daughter on Friday night, it is not a public setting, and the verse is said in its original language. Therefore, these two concerns do not apply here.</p>\n<p>The Rosh brings a law from the Tosefta in Masechet Megillah which says, \"הכתובה לרבים אין מכנין אותה ליחיד ליחיד אין מכנין אותה לרבים,” this means that when there is a word in all of Tanach written in the plural, it should not be changed to the singular, and vice versa. This law, along with the special caution regarding reading saying Birkat Kohanim in its original wording, is the basis for those who rule that the wording should not be changed from masculine to feminine in the case of the blessing on Friday night.</p>\n<p>However, the halachic authorities do not necessarily follow this path. The Rambam, in Hilchot Tefillah 12:12, brings the Mishnah's prohibition regarding the reading of the Torah in public, but not regarding every citation of the pasuk. The Rema emphasizes that the Tosefta's prohibition against saying a verse in the singular when it is written in the plural and vice versa applies to the translation of the pasuk, not to its actual recitation. The Rosh mentioned above brings Rabbeinu Yonah in the context of changing pesukim from Tehillim and limits the prohibition to a whole paragraph of tefillin. However, one who recites individual pesukim as part of his prayer may change from singular to plural and vice versa. Following this, and with the agreement of Rabbeinu Yerucham, Tur, and the Shulchan Aruch, the prohibition of changing from singular to plural and vice versa does not apply when one recites a pasuk in the context of prayer and supplication.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, from all the sources combined, it is permissible to change the wording from masculine to feminine in the specific context of the bracha a father gives his daughter every Friday night. We have seen that according to the sources, it is possible to change the wording of a verse in the context of tefillah, provided it is not a whole paragraph. Although there is a reason to be cautious specifically with the Birkat Kohanim, a father's blessing to his daughter does not meet the conditions that require such caution. We are only saying one of the verses of the section, and it is not a public reading of the Torah or a translation of the verse.</p>\n<p>Although the Minhag Haolam is to keep the birkat kohanim pasuk in masculine for women on Friday night, the person is right in the sense that there is no issur done if we change it to the feminine form, and it would therefore be better since it more directly addresses the women (and actually in Sefer Shirat Hayam Page 458 it says that Rabbi Yaakov Moshe Charlap blessed his granddaughter for birkat kohanim Friday night in the feminine). However many Gedolim were hesitant and therefore we should all keep it masculine.</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just wondering if there are any sources to back up this person's point, that one might consider a change of the gender of the blessing, an alternative blessing, or something less drastic, but along the same lines?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I came across this <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/ask/140071\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>שאלה</strong></p>\n<p>אנו נוהגים לברך את הילדים בליל שבת  בפסוקי ברכת כהנים, האם כשאני מברך את הבנות, אפשר לברך אותן בלשון נקבה למרות שהפסוקים כתובים בלשון זכר?</p>\n<p><strong>תשובה</strong></p>\n<p>במחזור של ראש השנה בהוצאת ישיבת כסא רחמים (מהדורת תש\"פ) שעבר את הגהתו של ראש הישיבה הרב מאיר מזוז שליט\"א, נכתב לפני ברכת הבנים: \"כשמברך הבנות ישנה ללשון נקבה\" משמע שהדבר מותר לדעתו.\nמקור זה והרחבה נוספת בנושא מצאתי בשו\"ת \"אדוני שאל\" (יצא בשנת תשפב) של הרב יוסף חיים נחום הלוי, שם בסימן ה' דן בנושא, והביא מדברי השו\"ע בסימן קטז שמותר לשנות לשון פסוקים מלשון יחיד לרבים כשאומר אותם דרך תפילה ובקשה ורק כשאומרים מזמור שלם אין לשנות. ועוד הביא ראיה מחזון עובדיה אבלות חלק א עמוד שכז ושו\"ת תורה לשמה סימן מד. אפשר לעיין שם בהרחבה.</p>\n<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>\n<p>We have the custom to bless the children on Friday night with the verses of Birkas Kohanim (the Priestly Blessing).

Both those readings speak about sexual immorality and avoiding the \"ways of Egypt\", just as the latter half of both Torah sections do. (Notably, both readings also open with a double usage of the unusual word התשפט.) This is still the practice in most communities (Sefardi, Italian, Yemenite).</p>\n<p>In Ashkenazi lands, for reasons yet unknown but presumably related to the very negative feel of the haftara (similar to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Megillah.4.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R' Eliezer's opposition to the haftara for Shemot</a>), they replaced one of those readings with a different reading from Amos 9 (not unlike what Ashkenazim did for <a href=\"https://seforimblog.com/2021/01/the-haftarah-of-parashat-shemot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot</a>, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/120734/759\">Tzav</a>, or <a href=\"https://seforimblog.com/2019/05/the-haftarot-for-behar-and-behukkotai/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Behar/Bechukotai</a>). <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37691&st=&pgnum=22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> and other early Ashkenazi authorities write that they read Amos 9 for Kedoshim, as did <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=8859&st=&pgnum=52\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Terumat HaDeshen</a>. Indeed in most pre-printing-press Ashkenazi chumashim that's what is written: Ezekiel 22 for Acharei and Amos 9 for Kedoshim (call that E22-A9). (References to manuscript counts are from R' Eli Duker's survey in Chitzei Gibborim #11.)</p>\n<p>The Mordechai (Megilla #831) writes that he found in a[n unnamed and not extant] book of local customs that when Acharei and Kedoshim are combined (ie. non leap years) we should exceptionally read from Amos even though it isn't the haftara of the second section. (Some authorities held to always use the haftara from the first of a doubled section, while the Mordechai and others held to generally use the second section's.) R' Isaac Tyrnau in his highly influential book of Polish customs, says based on this that the common chumashim referenced above have it backwards, and Amos 9 is for Acharei while Ezekiel 22 is for Kedoshim (A9-E22).</p>\n<p>Now wait a second. The original order was E22-E20. Rashi read E22-A9 by doing one substitution. I can get that. But how did we get from E22-E20 to A9-E22? Logically, there's only a few options: 1) Someone (either the Mordechai, the custom booklet he found, or earlier) accidentally mixed up a record of Rashi's practice (especially since in non-leap years both sides suspiciously agree), 2) Someone, coincidentally in parallel to the development of Rashi's custom to set Kedoshim to Amos, thought to set Acharei to Amos and <em>pushed off</em> E22 to the next week because it was somehow more worth keeping than E20 (not unlike what happened with Behar), 3) Among pre-printing-press Ashkenazi chumashim with A9 for Acharei, about half have <strong>E20</strong> (!) for Kedoshim (also a single substitution from the Babylonian practice). Perhaps the tradition in the Mordechai derives from a location that read A9-<strong>E20</strong>. The fact that both Ezekiel readings could be referred to in a source as התשפט certainly didn't help avoid mix-ups. Perhaps one day we'll find the Mordechai's referenced booklet and gain some clarity.</p>\n<p>Despite being the apparent minority position (numerous authorities appeal only to the Mordechai for this and not their local custom) of unclear provenance, A9-E22 makes it via the great Polish decisor Rama into the Shulchan Arukh (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%9B%D7%97_%D7%97\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 428:8</a>, cf. Levush who accepts A9-E22 but suggests reading E22 when combined). Most chumashim though continued to print things the same way and we end up with the record in the halachic literature being at odds with the record in the synagogue literature. Surely many shuls who had knowledgeable leadership followed the halachic sources, but also many were clearly following what it says in their chumash (and unwittingly, Rashi). This continued for centuries and was a regular occurrence every leap year.</p>\n<p>Around 200+ years ago, Rabbi Akiva Eiger of Poznań noted that if the Mordechai intended to override readings from Ezekiel when possible by reading Amos, the same ought apply when Acharei's haftara is superseded on Erev Rosh Chodesh (years when Pesach starts on Saturday in the Diaspora) freeing up Amos to be read the next week for Kedoshim. (For Rashi et al. the same would apply when Pesach starts on Thursday and Kedoshim is Rosh Chodesh, or in Israel when Pesach starts on Saturday and Kedoshim is Erev Rosh Chodesh.) This is a non-trivial novel extension of the Mordechai's position since in the case of a double parsha, the haftara of the first section is still related to something in that day's reading, whereas here Amos is not (for this position) at all related to Kedoshim. With the contemporary spread of reading Malachi on Shabbat Hagadol in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/120734/759\">leap years, and not just on Erev Pesach</a>, (eliminating <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/112106/759\">years starting on Thursday</a>) we're left with just one year type (leap year starting on Shabbat with Pesach on Tuesday) where both Acharei and Kedoshim are available for their own haftarot, and thus in the modern day this has become <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/3898/what-is-the-rarest-haftarah#comment11633_3913\">quite rare</a> indeed.</p>\n<p>The rarer it gets the less likely people will insist on sticking to their traditional practice (if they even remember this detail ~20 years later). In the beginning of the 20th century R' YM Tucazinsky and R' YE Henkin in their influential guides to synagogue service in Israel and <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=47667&st=&pgnum=73\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the USA</a> respectively maintained the order of the chumashim (and Rashi) despite various rabbinical critiques on the basis of prominent printed halachic works. There was a big brouhaha in Jerusalem when R' Tucazinsky's guide was first published (and some there (cf. <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=673&pgnum=46\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Yisrael 8:38</a>) went beyond extreme and read Amos two weeks in a row to avoid Ezekiel entirely, against every inch of precedent!) R' Henkin's successors eventually gave in after his death and changed the recommendation in the newer Ezras Torah Luach. Finally in the last ~50 years ArtScroll actually went and switched the order in their printed chumash based on the Mishna Berurah.</p>\n<p>And still many other modern chumashim maintain the old practice. That Rashi's original Ashkenazi practice at all survived centuries of prominent rabbis trying to stamp it out is nothing short of a miracle.</p>\n\n\n",

From here you learn that prayer must be accompanied by sound. The undaunted one wins over the abashed one.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What is the point which the ramban wishes to make with the last words \"חציפא נצח לבישה\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>It is saying that a person has to demonstrate a bit of chutzpah - impudence when davening so that you don't hold back and pray out loud despite being in front of the King of Kings where the initial thought would be to exercise a degree of restraint.</p>\n<p>The Dirshu website <a href=\"https://www.dirshu.co.il/284757/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> explains it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בשבת האחרונה, שמעתי שדיבר הרה׳׳ג רבי אפרים וולך (המשגיח של 'ברכת אפרים') ובדיוק הוא דיבר על המילים הללו ברמב\"ן הזה, ושאל מה ההסבר במילים האלו. והביא שר׳ ירוחם (פרשת כי תבא) והמשגיח ר׳ יחזקאל לוינשטיין מדברים על זה:</p>\n<p>נצייר לעצמנו דוגמא: אדם בא למרן שה׳׳ת ר׳ חיים קנייבסקי שליט׳׳א והוא מאבד עשתונות ומתחיל לצעוק בקול: יש לי חולה בבית! שהרב יברך אותו!!! אז פשוט יגידו לו – לא ככה מדברים אל הרב, ויוציאו אותו מהבית… כאשר אדם בא לתפילה עם רוממות הקול, הוא צועק, עונה אמן יהא שמיה רבא בכל כחו! ההיגיון אומר: מה אתה צועק?… ככה מדברים אל המלך?!… שומעים אותך גם בלי צעקות… איפה הבושה מהקב׳׳ה?…</p>\n<p>אומר ר׳ ירוחם – נכון, זו חוצפה, אך \"חציפא נצח לבישה\". אמנם זה בושה, לא ככה מדברים עם המלך, אך החוצפה ניצחה את הבושה. ולדוגמא, אדם שפסקו על אבא שלו גזר דין חמור, להתלות על עץ בכיכר העיר. הוא מנסה את כל ההשתדלויות, וככל שעובר הזמן הוא הפך עוד עולמות – ולא הועיל. אמרו לו יש לך רק אפשרות אחת, שהמלך יחון אותו. אבל זה מאד רחוק מ-2 סיבות: א) איך תגיע למלך. ב) למה שהמלך יחון אותו. הוא לא אוהב את היהודים יותר מהשופטים…</p>\n<p>אך אותו בן לא אמר נואש. הוא הפעיל פרוטקציות והפך עולם, עד שסוף סוף קבעו לו פגישה אצל המלך כמה שעות לפני ביצוע הגזר דין. הוא בא אל המלך מתוך איבוד עשתונות, הוא פרץ בבכי מתוך צעקות רמות – המלך! תציל את אבא שלי!!! אני לא שולט בעצמי לא לצעוק, אני צועק כי אני יודע שאנחנו בידיים שלך! רק אתה יכול!!! עוד כמה שעות, או שאבא תלוי בכיכר העיר, או שאתה חונן אותנו והוא יחזור אלינו. תרחם עלינו! תציל אותנו! זעק. כולם מבינים את זה… זה פורץ לו…</p>\n<p>אומר ר׳ ירוחם: אותו הדבר צריך יהודי להרגיש כשהוא בא לקדוש ברוך הוא. כל החיים שלי בידיים שלך! החיים, הבריאות, פרנסה, שכל, הורים, חברותא, הכל בידיים שלך, ורק אתה יכול לעזור לי, אם אתה לא עוזר לי חלילה, אני אבוד לגמרי! את זה אני צועק להקב׳׳ה. אמנם זו בושה, אך החוצפה נצחה לבושה, והקב׳׳ה אוהב את זה, שיהודי מרגיש שכולו תלוי רק ביד ה׳</p>\n<p>Last Shabbos, I heard Rabbi Ephraim Wallach (the Mashgiach of <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%AA_%D7%90%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bircas Ephraim</a>) speak, and he spoke precisely about these words in this Ramban, and asked what the explanation was in these words. And he brought Rav Yerucham (parshas Ki Savo) and the Mashgiach Rabbi Yechezkel Levinstein speaks about it.</p>\n<p>Let's draw an example for ourselves: a man comes to Maran Rav Chaim Kanievsky Shlit'a (now sadly zt\"l) and he loses his temper and starts shouting loudly: I have a sick person at home! May the Rabbi bless him!!! Then they will simply tell him - that's not how you talk to the Rov, and they will escort him out of the house... When a person comes to prayer with his voice raised, he shouts, answers Amen, may the heavens be great in all his might! Logic says: What are you shouting?... Is this how you talk to the King?!... You are heard even without shouting... Where is the shame from G-d?...</p>\n<p>Rav Yerucham says - correct this is deemed chutzpah. However, \"The undaunted one wins over the abashed one\". Although it's a shame, that's not how you talk to the King, but the sheer audacity overpowers the shame. And for example, a man whose father was given a severe sentence, to be hanged from a tree in the city square. He tries all the efforts, and as time goes by, he goes above and beyond - and still to no avail. They told him you have only one option, that the king will pardon him. But it is very far for 2 reasons: a) How will you get to the king. b) Why should the king pardon him. He does not like the Jews more than the judges...</p>\n<p>But that son did not give up hope. He exercised some protekzia, managing to somehow flip the odds, until finally they made an appointment with the king a few hours before the execution of the sentence. He came to the king out of losing his temper, he burst into tears out of loud shouts - the king! save my father! I can't control myself not to shout, I shout because I know we are in your hands! Only you can!!! In a few more hours, either father will be hanging in the city square, or you will bail us out and he will return to us. Have mercy on us! Save us!\" He cries out. Everyone understands this... it breaks him...</p>\n<p>Rav Yerucham says: A Jew should feel the same when he comes to the Holy One, blessed be He. My whole life is in your hands! Life, health, livelihood, intellect, parents, chavrusos, everything is in your hands, and only you can help me, if you don't help me, G-d forbid, I'm completely lost! This is what I shout to G-d. <strong>Although it is a shame, but insolence beats shame, and G-d loves it, that a Jew feels that everything depends only on G-d's hand</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is a variant of the phrase <code>חציפא נצח לכשירא</code>, i.e. \"<em>the one with chutzpa beats the proper one</em>\". See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Taanit.2.1.13?vhe=The_Jerusalem_Talmud,_edition_by_Heinrich_W._Guggenheimer._Berlin,_De_Gruyter,_1999-2015&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi 2:1</a>, which teaches a lesson that the people of Ninveh did <em>teshuva</em> by \"blackmailing\" Hashem, separating their calves from their mothers and saying \"if you don't answer our cry, we will not answer theirs\", and it worked.</p>\n<p>The gemara then says <code>כָּל־שֶׁכֵּן לְטוֹבָתוֹ שֶׁלְעוֹלָם</code>, \"<em>all the more so, for the good of the world</em>\" i.e. one who uses this \"chutzpadik\" method of entreating Hashem will have his prayer answered.</p>\n<p>This Ramban is making a startling connection between this concept, and the very reason for creating the world! I.e. that Hashem created the world so that He should have creations that pray and admit their gratitude to Him for creating them. They should do so loudly, unabashed!</p>\n<p>[I think a good mashal is, when we creations do consider how much we are grateful to Hashem, our gratitude shouldn't paralyze us with shame, but energise is with joy!]</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is food that tastes like chometz on Pesach \"not in the spirit of the law\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Various companies have gotten very good at making Pesach cakes and other items that taste almost identical to the chometz version. Do any poskim come out against eating foods like that from the perspective of it not being in the spirit of Pesach? In theory it would be similar to why many poskim are against acapella music during sefirah, though perhaps there's a difference being that the restrictions of sefirah are to demonstrate aveilus, which you lose out on when listening to any sort of music, as opposed to chometz which may be viewed as more of a geziras hakasuv (to put it generally. Obviously reasons are given for not eating chometz but they're beyond the scope of this question, I think)</p>\n\n\n",

There's no such abstract concept that the chazzan can't lead a congregation that distinguishes more letters than he does.</p>\n<p>Rather, it is inappropriate to appoint in permanent fashion a chazzan who cannot properly pronounce the words. (SA,OC 53:12). See Mishna Berurah there who points out a view (Pri Chadash) that if there is no more fitting chazzan, even if he pronounces the hei and ches equivalently, he may be appointed. Note also that in the Beiur Halacha there, he says that we should also be stringent with this on a non-permanent basis.</p>\n<p>Note also that the Taz in SA, OC 128:33 says that this is not considered a disqualifying factor for a chazzan or kohen (this rule also applies to a kohen duchaning) because רוב עמינו אין יודעים להבחין בזה</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What is the halacha on going barefoot outdoors (e.g., swimming on a beach or a \"grounding\" walk for health and getting sunlight in the morning)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Here's some context for my question: I like going for morning walks in my bare feet through the grass or in the sand. In addition to getting a healthy amount of sunlight, many medical and biological professionals believe that this has a positive affect called 'grounding' on the body, which has many health benefits that I won't rabbit trail into in this post.</p>\n<p>I was recently listening to a teaching while working out in the morning, and the Rabbi mentioned something negative about being barefoot that made me question my morning practice.</p>\n<p>Since hearing this, I began researching the subject, and have found a few answers, but none of them answered my question within the intended context that I'm searching for.</p>\n<p>I'm curious if there are any specific parameters to the subject of being barefoot, both indoors and outdoors, but especially outdoors.</p>\n<p>Certain nuanced, context-related questions arise for me on this topic, such as, \"If going barefoot is always bad, does that mean we should also swim with water shoes?\"</p>\n<p>As a note, I do not think biological indicators or health-related measurements are always a proper lens for considering mitzvot or halachah and their spiritual consequences.</p>\n<p>For example, many modern doctors and other medical professionals recommend bacon for brain health, shellfish for joint health, and frequently prescribe medications containing pork. To me, \"health benefits\" can be just another form of temptation.</p>\n<p>One must ask themselves, \"Do I value the physical benefits of this thing, or obedience to HaShem, regardless of benefits?\" Obedience itself IS the benefit, and if it's the only one, it's a blessing.</p>\n<p>This said, I do like these morning walks. Is it proper to continue taking them barefoot, or should I throw on some shoes? If swimming on the beach or anywhere outdoors, what then? Others may be able to think of other instances in which the nuances of halachah on going barefoot become relevant, but I think you get the gist, by now.</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance for any insights! I am excited to learn (and will keep my shoes on, in the meantime, just in case lol).</p>\n<p>History and sources are greatly appreciated.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: I just learned that there are special \"grounding shoes\" created to provide the same health-related benefits. Interestingly enough, most of them are mode of leather or at least have leather soles.</p>\n<p>From my very limited knowledge of shoe fashion throughout history, leather shoes were frequently worn during the time periods of most of the people we read about in the scriptures. Maybe they were benefiting from grounding all along!

The goal though is not pleasure or pain, it is to escape the cycle. It is to be like a good swimmer in a river, staying afloat in one spot, being a constant in an ever-changing environment. The goal is in the middle, peace, which is a constant, a balance between the two poles. The “flow” from pain -> pleasure is a chaotic up/down movement, so it’s not a straight line. It is like the mixing ocean, where things move up and down in a seemingly random fashion, based on their actions and sin.</p>\n<p>In this sense, there is no beginning and end to creation from that perspective. But then I imagine the physical world, which seems to have been evolving toward more perfection, and so seems to be trending toward the upward direction. The Buddhist perspective can be seen like this too, which would mean at some point it reaches pure perfection, and either starts over from scratch, or reverses like a pendulum.

It begins from His Essence and Being<sup>1</sup>.</p>\n<p>Stating that the world is somehow in some infinite cycle is actually a heretical thought according to Torah, because the Zohar clearly states that Hashem is not a creator in essence (that's infinitely beneath Him)<sup>2</sup>; He created the universe out of absolute nothingness. Not just from zero raw materials, but absolute zero - not even potential, not even out of some logical argument<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>He created the world with a purpose and a plan, and it will be accomplished, and in one go (although there is what to discuss about a <strong>finite</strong> number of worlds that came before this<sup>4</sup>).

At this level, we refer to the Awtsmoos in the second person, \"blessed are <em>you</em>\", since it's as of we are looking directly at him and facing Him.</p>\n<p>Another 'level' in how the singular Awtsmoos can be revealed, is in a way of concealment. This refers to Joe the Awtsmoos is \"elevated\", so to speak, into it's own Essence, and away from the potential for existence. Paradoxically, this concealment is actually the source for Creation, because creation exists through the Awtsmoos being hidden in the world, through the tzimtzim</p>\n<p>(Even though the tzimtzim is only in the light but not even in the luminary, and for sure not in the Awtsmoos, but this level is the ultimate \"source\" for the idea of the concealment at all)</p>\n<p>This level is referred to in the third person, when we say \"blessed is He\", since He is hidden, like when one refers to someone who's \"over there\" and so to speak not \"here\" (even though He's also here as He is everywhere, but at this level He is concealed).

    "content": "# Does G-d experience pain?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I am trying to think through how He could create the universe, filled with pleasure and pain (heaven and hell), and yet not experience <strong>all of it</strong> together? In His infinite oneness, permeating all of creation, He would seemingly have to empathize with His creation, and therefore feel pain, and yet at the same time be <em>beyond</em> pain and pleasure somehow. But if the infinite oneness is perfected, or in \"perfect harmony and balance\", wouldn't that mean He only experiences either pure pleasure or pure peace, and so be located on one side of the pain-peace-pleasure spectrum? Or would it mean He experiences the full spectrum at once, and therefore knows complete pain and complete pleasure, or something like that?</p>\n<p>What is the Jewish / Kabbalah perspective on this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>The Mishnah (Sanhedrin 6:5), as printed, seems to indicate that God does participate in human pain:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי מֵאִיר, בְּשָׁעָה שֶׁאָדָם מִצְטַעֵר, שְׁכִינָה מַה הַלָּשׁוֹן אוֹמֶרֶת כִּבְיָכוֹל, קַלַּנִי מֵרֹאשִׁי, קַלַּנִי מִזְּרוֹעִי. אִם כֵּן הַמָּקוֹם מִצְטַעֵר עַל דָּמָם שֶׁל רְשָׁעִים שֶׁנִּשְׁפַּךְ, קַל וָחֹמֶר עַל דָּמָם שֶׁל צַדִּיקִים.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Meir said: The phrase “for he that is hung is a curse [kilelat] of God” should be understood as follows: When a man suffers in the wake of his sin, what expression does the Divine Presence use? I am distressed [kallani] about My head, I am distressed about My arm, meaning, I, too, suffer when the wicked are punished. From here it is derived: If God suffers such distress over the blood of the wicked that is spilled, even though they justly deserved their punishment, it can be inferred a fortiori that He suffers distress over the blood of the righteous.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, if one looks in Rambam's commentary one will see that he possessed a different text of the Mishnah (which omits שכינה) which does away with such a connotation. It jives well with Rambam's notion of a transcendent God.</p>\n<p>(מה הלשון אומרת כלומר איזה דבר הוא מנהג בני אדם לומר כשהוא רוצה לענות מי שמצטער בצערו אין הנאה בזה המעשה ולא בהנחתו והדברים שהיו אומרים בימי ר\"מ קלני מראשי קלני מזרועי כך אמר הכתוב שבמיתת זה החוטא יש חורבן המציאות ולהניח אותו בחיים אין טוב ואם זה אומר במחויב מיתה כ\"ש מי שנהרג נקי)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Hello Lance and welcome to Mi Yodeya.</p>\n<p>Your instinct and reason about this subject are aimed in the right direction.</p>\n<p>The general rule from the traditional Jewish viewpoint (including Kabbalah) is that <strong>G-d is one</strong>. This implies consequentially that <em><strong>nothing from the created universe</strong></em> which we experience and perceive through our senses <em><strong>is separate and apart from G-d</strong></em>.</p>\n<p>But like you raise in your question, doesn't that mean that in terms of how we understand and experience the universe, that there must be some kind of deficiency with G-d if G-d is not lacking what we experience?</p>\n<p>To this, we have a teaching from Elijah the Prophet, who explains to us in regard to G-d, that G-d's thoughts (and consequentially G-d's emotions, feelings, etc., which arise from intellect according to the order implanted and imbued throughout all of creation by the Creator) are not like our thoughts. The Prophet uses similar Hebrew words sharing a common word root, which means they have a common meaning but are categorically different (like for example חכים ולא בחכמה ידיעא, מבין ולא בבינה ידיעא, <em><strong>Wise</strong> and not with <strong>known Wisdom</strong></em>, <em><strong>Understanding</strong> and not with <strong>known understanding</strong></em>), to distinguish our experience from G-d.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You know when people say \"you don't have to let them hurt you, it's your choice\". This is because your essential self is unaffectable - you are a free being. Only you can affect yourself. This is part of the philosophy of essence, which is a philosophy that is not controversial either among the philosophers of Chakira, or the Kabbalists, or the Chassidim who tried to resolve both camps into a unified teaching.</p>\n<p>If a person is a man of strength by Torah standards, then he is able to retain this \"unaffected\" state, and decide, using his own leadership and initiative, based on his own decision, how to feel about anything and everything (and if he is Kadosh, it will be in line with Torah always). As Ben Zoma states in Avot 4:1:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Who is strong? He who conquers his inclination,\nas it is said: “He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty;\nand he that rules his spirit than he that takes a city” (Mishlei 16:32)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam states in the Moreh that attributing human emotions, and things like pain and pleasure to Hashem is nonsensical. Human feelings are reactive, instinctive creations that <em>affect</em> someone, and are also very lowly - definitely non-applicable to Hashem. Hashem's knowledge of our pain, however, is His self knowledge. All is indeed one with Him, like you state, and He knows it with a perfect knowledge (Mishneh Torah). This perfect knowledge is also not something we can describe as \"Hashem experiencing\" either, according to Rambam. \"Experiencing\" is a human way of looking at things (too lowly for Hashem, and also implies He is being affected).</p>\n<p>The Kabbalist the Maharal takes this a step further in Gevurot Hashem, and states that even knowledge is not \"His Essence\". Similar to the Moreh, claiming that Hashem \"knows\" in any way that we can conceive or express is incorrect, and the sublime truth of the matter is level upon level of sublime loftiness, removed from our understanding or grasp. Knowledge, as we know it, is just a creation to Hashem, as distant from His Essence as a stone or physical action is.</p>\n<p>The Ramak (teacher of the Arizal) resolves this in Pardes Rimonim by saying that both are correct (and built upon by the Tzemach Tzedek in Derech Mitzvotecha). The Rambam, when he talks about Hashem being the Knower, the Knowledge and the Known, in a great oneness of knowledge that is beyond our comprehension and our ability to utter or hear, is referring to the Sefirot of Atzilut. From Hashem's point of view, these are indeed as lowly as pebbles, but from our point of view, loftier than the mind can comprehend, infinite and ineffable.</p>\n<p>Despite that, they are created from Godliness, and He identifies with them. So when we say Hashem knows, it is appropriate to say He knows with <em>His</em> Chochma. We can therefore say that what He knows can indeed be pain. It can be the pain of humanity, or it can be pain relevant to the Sefirot of Atzilut themselves. The former is just a mashal of a mashal of the latter, and the latter is a tzimtzum of true Godliness.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובפרט מצד מקור נשמותינו</p>\n<p>And specifically, [how much more so does the pain we share in our\nunified souls be felt] by the Source of our souls (Derech Mitzvotecha Isur Sinat Yisrael, Mitzvat Ahavat Yisrael 1:1)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another source is in Tomer Devorah, by the Ramak, by the fourth Midda of Rachamim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והינו לשארית נחלתו לשון שאר בשר וסוף סוף הם נחלתו. ומה אמר, אם אענישם\nהרי הכאב עלי כדכתיב (ישעיה סג, ט) בכל צרתם לו צר.</p>\n<p>This, too, is the meaning of the words \"the <em>she'erit</em> [remnant] of His\nheritage,\" implying <em>she'er basar</em>, a blood relationship. In the final\nanalysis, the children of Israel are God's inheritance. Says the Holy\nOne, Blessed be He: \"If I punish them, the pain is Mine!\", as it is\nwritten, \"In all their trouble, He is afflicted...\" (Yeshayahu 63:9).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ramak goes on to prove that the pain is <em>His</em>, and not limited to a particular Sefira or level of the Seder Hishtalshelus (the spiritual cosmos, including His revelations within it).</p>\n<p>Now to finish where we started. He can also choose whether on not to actually be hurt or not. We can't affect Him, He is Mighty. But don't limit Hashem, He is beyond limit (even beyond the limit of being beyond limit! See Maamarim Yom Tov shel Rosh HaShana 5666 p. 167). Woe unto the person who does something and Hashem decides to let it hurt Him, because it is a true contradiction to His Essence that He cannot abide by! Generally, it seems that what He lets hurt Him, because it is a perfection to do so, is when He doesn't have us, because we sinned, or abandoned Him. We are His afterall, so this is the biggest violation of His Essence.</p>\n\n\n",

Talmud isn't something to read like how one would read other religious writings, e.g. Christian Church Father writings or Islamic sunnah/tafseers, et cetera. To put it like this: if daf yomi (daily digests of Talmud tractates with additional discussions included) are something one (I tried this when I was still a Noahide, at the time not yet considering geirus... It's like sailing a boat into sea with no sail and no captain to consult) finds challenging, how much more is directly reading the Talmud (which doesn't have the discussions from the daf yomi)? From what the community I stayed with for Pesach told me, it's best to start with the parshas (weekly reading of the sections of Written Torah which mostly includes connections to Oral Torah, mileage may vary depending on your shul's rabbi). Jumping directly into Oral Torah will be tough for a geirus (who is still studying and immersing into following Torah). I also agree with what @mbloch has said about the distinction between reading and learning.</p>\n\n\n",

The first paragraph of Shema is addressed to the Tzaddik, and we know this because it expects the Jew to love Hashem with all his <em>me'od</em>, his extreme.</p>\n<p><strong>The second paragraph of Shema is in reference to a Jew who is not a Tzaddik</strong> (and doesn't say \"with all your extreme\"). It even starts with \"<strong>if</strong> you listen...\".</p>\n<p><strong>So, the fact that there is even an \"if\" implies a lower state. It's not an evil state, but it's certainly lower.

    "content": "# If a Jew accepts Shabbat early, is something new which came into existence then nolad\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Halacha, if a Jew accepts Shabbat early, is something new which comes into existence then (when it is still before when Shabbat would naturally  start) considered nolad? Or no, since it is before when Shabbat would naturally start does nolad not apply?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Great question!</p>\n<p>In no way am I paskening anything, please your LOR about this question:</p>\n<p>The intro:</p>\n<p>The major case where nolad is discussed is in Beitza 2a (and onwards) which discusses a case of a chicken laying an egg on yom tov (or shabbat), which the Gemera says is Nolad. This is paskened in Shulchan Aruch O.C. Siman 322:1. The Mishneh Berurah explains that it's nolad because Chachmim made a gzeira regarding Shabbat that falls after Yom Tov (or the opposite). In such a case, an egg laid on it is forbidden Medeoritah for consumption because any egg laid today was completed yesterday. Therefore, if we eat it, we find that it was prepared from Yom Tov for Shabbat. Also, if an egg is laid on a Yov Tov that falls on a Sunday, it is also forbidden Medeoritah to eat it, because it was certainly completed in the chicken's body the day before. Thus, when we eat it, we find that it was prepared from Shabbat to Yom Tov. Tosefet Shabbat is a machloket Rishonim if its Deoritah or Derabbanan. Rishonim who hold its deoritah are the Rif Yoma 2b, Rosh Yoma 8:8, Tosfoat Rosh Hashanah 9a, and the Ra’an Shabbat 15a etc, and from the Biur Halacha (O.C. Siman 261:2) it sounds like its deoritah since the majority of Rishonim hold that, including Shulchan Aruch (arguably). And Nolad (which is a category of muktzeh) is derabbanan.</p>\n<p>Second intro:</p>\n<p>In the Sefer Kovetz Yesodot Vechakirot page 1014 he writes about a chakirah regarding tosefet shabbat. One opinion holds that upon the early acceptance of Shabbat, it effectively begins in every sense. The other opinion suggests that Shabbat cannot truly start early; rather, Tosefet Shabbat implies that the individual takes on the prohibition of melachah before Shabbat officially begins. According to the ספר רץ כצבי on the topic גדרי תוספת שבת ויום טוב, he quotes the Taz in O.C. 291:6 who says, כתב בס\"ח סי' רס\"ט בליל שבת צריך שיהי' גמר הסעודה בלילה ורש\"ל נהג שלא אכל בליל שבת עד הלילה. The Taz quotes the Sefer Chasidim who says that one must finish their shabbat meat at night (not during the day), and so did the Mahrashal. The Taz then disagrees and says, ול\"נ כיון דתוס' מחול על הקדש הוא דאורייתא ע\"כ יצא שפיר אפי' גמר קודם לילה. That Tosefet Shabbat is Deoritah (which is a machloket Rishonim) and therefore a person can even finish his shabbat meal before nightfall. The ספר רץ כצבי then says that the Sefer Chasidim/Maharshal and the Taz on the yesod of tosefet shabbat. The Sefer Chasidim/Maharshal holds that tosefet shabbat is not שייך (related) to the essence of the shabbat, therefore one can eat even before nightfall, therefore Tosefet Shabbat is a regular weekday just with melachot and things he can't do (like view 2), therefore one can't finish his meal before nightfall. But according to the Taz when one takes in shabbat early, shabbat ממש starts in all its details, even though the sun didn't set, and therefore if one finishes his shabbat meal before nightfall he is yotzei.</p>\n<p>However in our case, there is a melacha being done before shabbat “really came in” and the question is if nolad would apply. According to the above chakirah, everyone agrees that there is issur melacha for someone who takes in shabbat early as mentioned in Shulchan Aruch O.C. Siman 263. However the special thing about tosefet shabbat is that one can ask another Jew to do a melacha for him as mentioned there in Seif 17.</p>\n<p>Intro to the next part:</p>\n<p>The reason that a Jew who accepted shabbat early can do melacha for you is for two main reasons: 1) The Eliyah Rabah O.C. Siman 263 Seif Katan 38 quoting the Beit Yosef says, אי בעי לא היה מקבל שבת עליו, meaning that its allowed since if he wanted to, he didn't need to accept shabbat. 2) The second reason is in the Kaf Hachaim quoting the Taz in Seif Katan 101 who says מיהו הט\"ז סק\"ג כתב הטעם כיוון דלחבירו מותר ואין עליו איסור שבת מותר לזה האמירה דלא נאסר אמירה אלא בדבר שהוא שוה לכל ישראל, that the amira (saying something) is not assur unless its equally assur to all to klal yisrael.</p>\n<p>The answer:</p>\n<p>So with regards to nolad, if as we said by a regular melacha one who accepts shabbat early cannot directly get pleasure from the melacha himself but can ask someone else to give him the pleasure, the same would apply by nolad that if someone already accepted shabbat early he can’t benefit from it directly, but he can ask someone else to give him the pleasure. That would lead us to conclude that someone who accepted shabbat early cannot benefit from nolad that occurred because that's tantamount to him benefiting from the melacha himself.</p>\n<p>Hope this answers it!</p>\n\n\n",

It seems like the entire distinction between the 2 types of natural miracles <strong>is</strong> that the first type are seen, and the second type aren't.</p>\n<p>Now we're saying that in the future, we will also see the currently hidden miracles. In that case, what will be the difference between the two types?</p>\n<p>Surely there will also be a difference between the supernatural miracles of the future (ingathering of the exiles, second splitting of the sea and river, resurrection of the dead etc) and the natural miracles that will also be shown in the future, so it stands to reason that, since some natural miracles are visible even now and some aren't, implying they are different types, these two types of natural miracles will still exist as unique entities.</p>\n<p>Not only does it stand to reason that this is the case, but it's explicitly mentioned in sif 2 that this second category comes from a \"higher source\" than the first.</p>\n<p>In addition, in note 25 in <a href=\"https://dach.dev/meluket/view/4_%D7%A8%D7%9B%D7%94#par=4&eng=emes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sif 3</a>, it explicitly connects the idea that this second type is from a higher source to the advantage it has over even the first type of natural miracles (and especially supernatural miracles), that since one recognizes the miracle (in the first type), it's similar to the miracle \"breaking\" nature; but the second tyoe, which one doesn't realize at all, happens while nature is at it's full strength.</p>\n<p>Technically the language it uses is \"recognize if the garments of nature are only garments\", instead of only relying on the terminology of \"recognizing a miracle\" or not, although both ideas are mentioned...</p>\n<p>But if we will see the second type in the future, then how will it be different from the first type (which even then will clearly have a lesser shoresh as mentioned)?</p>\n<p>I think the key is somehow in the terminology of \"garments of nature\", and understanding what exactly it will mean that we will see the second type, in such a way that it's different than seeing the first type, but I'm not sure exactly the explanation is</p>\n\n\n",

Has anyone come across this before and is there a source for it?  Is it a minhag that should be kept or just something that some people are careful about?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Hopefully this should answer your question which was answered on ShulchanAruchHarav.com</p>\n<p>Sleeping with socks:</p>\n<p>The Halachic issue of removing the socks and revealing the feet:[1] In area that it is not common to ever walk with revealed feet, even in the summer, they must be careful to always have the feet covered, either with socks or by their blanket.[2] In areas that it is common to walk without socks, then it is not necessary to leave them constantly covered, and hence one may sleep without socks and have his feet extend pass the covers.[3]</p>\n<p>The practical ruling and customs: Practically, in today’s times, it is permitted for one to remove his socks and sleep with uncovered feet.[4] This especially applies in a case that one is in pain in leaving his socks on.[5] Furthermore, some Poskim[6] state, based on a ruling in Shulchan Aruch Harav[7], that it is “forbidden” [for men] to sleep with socks [or with the feet covered under a blanket, as doing so can lead to nocturnal emission[8]. Furthermore, there is a tradition based on a directive of the Alter Rebbe[9] that sleeping with socks can lead to lack of memory.[10] Practically, based on all this, it is the custom of some pious and meticulous Jews to be particular to specifically sleep without socks and with the feet out of the blanket.[11] However, on the other hand, there are Chassidim who are stringent even today to never reveal their feet, and they hence change their socks under the covers, and never reveal their feet, or simply sleep with their socks.[12]</p>\n<p>The Chabad custom:[13] Some Chabad Chassidim are particular to always remove their socks and uncover their feet due to the belief that sleeping with socks can cause memory loss, or due to that sleeping with covered feet can cause nocturnal emission to a man. On the other hand, other Chabad Chassidim[14] are particular to specifically sleep with socks or at least sleep with their feet always under the covers in order not to reveal the feet. Practically, one may choose as he sees fit. Certainly, there is no room to obligate Chabad Chassidim to specifically sleep without socks.</p>\n<p>A Maaseh Shehaya</p>\n<p>Sleeping without socks:[15]</p>\n<p>The following story was related by Rav Chaim Mordechai Perlow: I heard from the Mashpia, Rav Shmuel Gronam Estherman, that the Chassid Reb Michal of Optzuk studied in his youth many books of philosophy. In his later years he complained to the Alter Rebbe that the ideas which he read disturb his thoughts and perturb him. The Alter Rebbe told him: “You should sleep with socks, as this matter causes forgetfulness. Consequently, you will forget the ideas you learned from the philosophy books.”</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[1] See Admur Basra 2:2; Kama 2:9; 4:18; 56:17; 75:1; 91:5; 128:4; 619:19; Aruch Hashulchan 2:1; Igros Moshe Yoreh Deah 3:47; Piskeiy Teshuvos 2:1</p>\n<p>[2]  Admur Basra 2:2 in parentheses “(In those areas that it is not common to ever walk with revealed feet, even in the summer, they must be careful to always have the feet covered. Thus, when removing the socks prior to going to sleep one is to first cover his feet with the blanket and remove them under the blanket. Likewise, when putting on socks after awakening one is to put them on little by little under the blanket in order not to reveal it at all. This law applies throughout the day or night whenever he is switching socks.)”; M”B 2:1; However see Igros Moshe Yoreh Deah 3:47 for analysis on opinion of M”B; See regarding the prohibition against walking barefoot, and that one who does so the Sages said is considered excommunicated from G-d: Admur Kama 2:9; Rama 2:6</p>\n<p>[3] Admur 75:1; See also Admur 56:17; 91:5; 128:44; 619:18 which permits revealing the feet</p>\n<p>[4] Aruch Hashulchan 2:1; Piskeiy Teshuvos 2:1; as it is common to walk in slippers, without socks, inside one’s house even when one has company. [see Igros Moshe Yoreh Deah 3:47]</p>\n<p>[5] Igros Moshe Yoreh Deah 3:47</p>\n<p>[6] Chakal Yitzchak Mamar 7:3 [Yitzchak Issac of Spinka, murdered in Aushwitz Al Kiddush Hashem. HY”D]</p>\n<p>[7] See Admur 619:18 based on Shelah and Elya Raba 619:11 that on the night of Yom Kippur one is to sleep with his feet uncovered in order to diminish the heat and prevent improper stimulation. It is told that the Rebbe Rashab gave someone similar instructions, to sleep without socks, as a Tikkun for nocturnal emission. [Otzar Minhagei Chabad Yom Kippur 176]</p>\n<p>[8] Based on 619:18 the issue is not necessarily the socks but the fact the feet are covered.</p>\n<p>[9] See the story of Admur recorded in Chassidim Harishonim 1:92, as brought below</p>\n<p>[10] The reason: Perhaps the reason for this is due to that nocturnal emission causes forgetfulness. [See Tanya Igeres Hateshuvah 9 [blemishes the mind]; Mamarim Haketzarim p. 359; Tocheches Chaim [Falagi] p. 6 in name of Ramak; See Igros Kodesh 16:272 that acting with modesty strengthens the memory]</p>\n<p>[11] Brought in Piskeiy Teshuvos 2 footnote 4</p>\n<p>[12] Shulchan Hatahor “Tznius” chapter 4; This was the ruling of Harav Avraham Hirsh Hakohen, father of Rav Asher Lemel Hakohen, Rav of Anash Beitar Ilit.</p>\n<p>[13] Reply of Rav Eli Landa regarding Chabad custom: “There is no issue to sleep with socks. On the contrary, the elderly Rav of Kefar Chabad, Harav Garelik, was accustomed to specificvally sleep with socks for reasons of Tzenius. However, not everyone is accustomed to do so.”</p>\n<p>[14] See above regaridng Rav Avraham Hirsh Hakohen, and Rav S.Z. Garelik</p>\n<p>[15] Chassidim Harishonim 1:92</p>\n\n\n",

He stressed that this is specifically about not following blindly -- that if you are going to do something like the nations around you, you should not do so simply <em>because</em> that is how they do it. You need a Jewish reason for doing it, and you need to do it in a distinctively Jewish way.</p>\n<p>He seemed to be saying that he was following the Ben Ish Chai in this distinction.

Here is my question:</p>\n<p>The משנה is the collection of <em>Torah Shebe'al Peh</em>, passed down from <em>Matan Torah</em> until today. There are, however, sometimes debates in the משנה which seem to be impossible, since they are about things quite common. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pesachim 10:2</strong> - Beis Shammai and Beis Hillel argue about the order of Kiddush. If this was something done every week, how could they forget the proper order?</li>\n<li><strong>Berachos 6:1</strong> - The Tanna Kamma says that vegetables receive a <em>Borei Pri Ha'adamah,</em> while Rebbi Yehuda says that leafy vegetables require a בורא מיני דשאים. Did they never have leafy greens that a debate could happen regarding something so common?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now, perhaps these two are <em>D'rabanan</em> and were established when those mishnayos were made, but there are some examples which are even <em>D'Oraisa!</em></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Berachos 1:2 and 1:3</strong> - I was told that these a D'oraisa. If there is such a large period between the deadline of R' Eliezer and R' Yehoshua, how could they forget when the deadline <em>MiSinai</em> was? Did most people recite Krias Shema in this small timeframe? The next Mishna discusses a machlokes regarding the proper position to recite Shema in, which surely there could have been no doubt about?</li>\n<li><strong>Pesachim 4:5</strong> - The Machlokes between Rebbi Yehuda and Rebbi Meir is discussing a safeguard from Chazal. Though it could be said this machlokes was talking about what should be implemented rather than what the halacha is, Rebbi Yehuda brings a proof from the time of the Beis HaMikdash, meaning that this decree was in place then, so how could there be a portion of the community which forgot about the proper time to dispose of chametz?!</li>\n<li><strong>Succah 3:4</strong> - The Lulav was taken every year, yet the Tannaim are arguing about how many of each to take? How could there be any doubt? Did Rebbi Akiva really do like Rebbi Yishmael (the amount today), yet disagreed about the minimum to fulfill the mitzvah?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Hif'il tells me this is meant in a non-reflexive sense. That is, the subject of the sentence, the אדם, is accustoming or habituating someone else to something, until it becomes a חק to that person (or maybe to the אדם?). However, other translations interpret it reflexively, and that makes more sense contextually.

E.g. אֶל־לִבּֽוֹ׃ in Gen 6:6.</p>\n<p>In practice, I suspect that it would be hard to re-articulate without adding an unwanted pause. So perhaps I'm asking more about theory than practice.</p>\n<p>Biblically, this most often occurs with <em>lamed</em> (ל־ל). But it is also not rare (dozens of instances) with <em>tav</em> (ת־ת), <em>nun</em> (ן־נ), and <em>mem</em> (ם־מ). It happens on other letters, too, but only rarely. E.g. I find only two cases with <em>tsadi</em> (ץ־צ).</p>\n<p>Rarely, it happens when the same sound is called for, but not using the same letter. E.g. יִשְׁפֹּֽט־תֵּבֵ֥ל in Ps 9:9. (Of course, this example is not calling for the same sound in a dialect that distinguishes <em>tet</em> from <em>tav</em>.) BTW in that example I think the <em>dagesh</em> in the <em>tav</em> is <em>qal</em> not <em>ḥazaq</em> so we need not get into whether this somehow calls for a <strong>triple</strong>-prolonged version of this sound!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There is some discussion about the matter in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.15b.27?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot 15b</a>, relating to the precise reading of the Shema and it's subsequent sections. The phrase בְּכׇל־לְבָבְךָ֥ is cited as an example of where one is prone to slurring the words, and where one therefore ought to pause between enunciating the words.</p>\n<p>Evidently, many Jewish communities took this rule to mean that they should pause between words that could be slurred in reading from Tanach. Morag writes that Yemenite Jews, for example, are careful to not to merge letters of adjacent words, whether the first has conjunctive or disjunctive accents (though he makes no mention of maqef) (העברית שבפי יהודי תימן, 65–6).</p>\n<p>Katz notes that the Jews of Djerba also were careful to distinguish between words, even if there is a maqef between them. In fact, some readers would add an extra vowel between the words as a sort of separator, e.g. בן-נון as bine-nun (מסורת הקריאה של קהילת ג'רבה במקרא ובמשנה, 51).</p>\n<p>There is some evidence that this was also the case in earlier stages of Hebrew. The בגדכפ\"ת consonants were fricatives when they were proceeded by a vowel, unless the consonant was geminated; in this case, the original plosive was preserved. Consequently, if words like עַד־דָּֽן were pronounced without a pause between them, we would expect the pronunciation to be either something like ʿaddān (if the dalet were geminated), or something like ʿaðān (if the dalet were not geminated). However, the niqud indicates the first dalet is a fricative, and the second is a plosive. This suggests that a pause was likely present when the fricativization process took hold (as early as the Second Temple period?).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From what I learned from my Aramaic speaking Torah teacher. In this instance you repeat the sound. The maqaf serves to indicate these words grammatically should be taken as one word in terms of pausing, but not taken as one word in terms of merging letter sounds. Usually to combine 2 Lamed Sounds or two of any letter sounds this is indicated with a Dageish Hazaq</p>\n<p>In the case of a simple doubling of the letter, we end up with a dageish hazak and we pronounce that doubled letter a bit different. For example, Shabbat is not Sha-bbat. It's Shab-bat. In much the same way roommate is pronounced room-mate not roo-mate</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone address why this is, or interpret any particular prayer as referring to such a request?</p>\n<p>Note that I am specifically asking about <em>rabbinically established prayers</em>; anything composed after the 6th century does not count.</p>\n<p>(As a sidepoint, there is a talmudic passage, <a href=\"https://shas.alhatorah.org/Gemara/Moed_Katan/28a.1#m3e0n6\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Moed Kattan 28a</a>, where Rava states that \"children, lifespan, and sustenance depend upon <em>mazal</em>/fate [as opposed to a person's worthiness]\".

Avraham aside, most 100-year-olds are not going to daven to have more children.

There is no prayer to fulfil Mitzvot, i.e. there is no prayer for a Lulav. One must marry a woman who can have children, and even divorce his current wife if she cannot have children (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ketubot.77a.17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ktubot 77a</a>). If he cannot have children, we never pray for a miracle.</p>\n<p>Regarding raising children, there is an established prayer/bracha in the morning brachot, V'haarev na, we pray that our children and descendants should all know and follow Hashem and study Torah. (I also feel that it is alluded to in the blessing for Parnassah. They are bunched together in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.7.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dvarim 7:13</a> and the Gemara quoted. The Ben Ish Hai writes that the blessing of wealth is dependent on children (Od Yosef Hai, Breshit 25:21). The blessing is for wealth but is framed as a blessing on time, eg let what I have already done, planted/children end off well (this works out better with the wording of the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Siddur_Edot_HaMizrach%2C_Weekday_Shacharit%2C_Amida.20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Edot Hamizrah version</a> of the bracha).)</p>\n\n\n",

Around that same area, he also quotes a Gemara that says that “most people fall by theft, few people fall in Arayot, and all fall in Lashon Hara.” This Gemara seems to say that only a minority of the nation fall regarding Arayot.

In the following halacha he says that folks feel a strong pull towards arayos and theft and that ultimately most slip up with theft and only a minority with arayos. That is to say that ultimately, despite how attractive arayos is, and it is more attractive than theft, due to its severity most people are able to abstain, despite the difficulty and overwhelming desire for it. As opposed to theft where despite not as many people coveting it relative to arayos, nevertheless many more people slip up there due to their perception of it as a less severe aveirah.</p>\n\n\n",

The reason for this is debated, either because any קל וחומר can be somehow disproven, or because of the way punishments work, or because of a גזירת הכתוב (i.e., that's just the rule). But the reasoning for this is not what we are discussing.</p>\n<p>The source for this rule can be found in Makkos 5b. The Torah prohibits marriage to both your half sister from your mother, and your half sister from your father. One could make the following קל וחומר - if a half sister is prohibited, shouldn't a full sister be prohibited? However, we learn the prohibition for a full sister from a <em>drasha</em> rather than this קל וחומר, proving that we never use קל וחומר's to learn prohibitions. (See the Gemara for more detail.)</p>\n<p>The question is the following: elsewhere (eg Kiddushin 4a), the Gemara says that \"מילתא דאתיא מק׳׳ו טרח וכתב לה קרא\" - something learned from קל וחומר, the Torah sometimes goes and says anyway, even though I would have logically figured it out on my own.

I know that <em>causing harm</em> can result in liability (e.g. someone who accidentally kills another while driving drunk may be liable to go to a City of Refuge), I am considering cases where only the risk of damage or harm happened, not actual damage or harm. That is, I'm asking about a case where:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Jewish driver drives a motor vehicle while too intoxicated to do so safely, in a manner that <em>could</em> reasonably damage property or harm or kill another.</li>\n<li>No harm as countenanced above actually happens, not because of intent but because of chance factors outside the control of the person. This means that no person was injured or killed, no livestock or other property was damaged, etc.</li>\n<li>The act is not illegal under local law.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In other words, is driving drunk without harming anyone <em>inherently</em> an aveirah, or is an aveirah only because of <em>dina d'malchuta dina</em> and the fact that essentially every country nowadays outlaws DUI?</p>\n\n\n",

Although the two adjacent letters are consecutive, one is חזק\\דגוש, so they represent completely different phonemes. Were these letters pronounced differently in the past? Do any commentators address this question? Where is the source of these examples?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>The source for the Shulchan Aruch's examples is the statement of Rava recorded in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.15b.28?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Berachot 15b</a>. So what we really need to know is how these consonants were pronounced in fourth century Mesopotamia.</p>\n<p>R. Shimon b. Tzemach Duran writes in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9446&st=&pgnum=112\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Magen Avot vol. III p. 54</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הבי\"ת הרפה הוגים אותה ... בדיבוק שפתיים כמו הדגושה בדגש רפה במעט שינוי ברפיון יותר ... שאי אפשר שתהא הגיית הבי\"ת כהגיית הוי\"ו בשום פנים ולא היתה כן הגייתנו בהיותנו בארצנו ויורה זה מה שאמרו בק\"ש שיניח ריוח בין הדבקים ומנו שם כמו עשב בשדך יראה כי הגיית בי\"ת עשב כהגיית בי\"ת בשדך שהיא דגושה</p>\n<p>The \"weak\" <em>bet</em> is pronounced ... with the lips together, in the same way as the \"stressed\" bet (i.e. with a <em>dagesh kal</em>), with a small change in that they are slightly looser... It cannot in any way be that it is pronounced like a <em>vav</em>, and that was not our pronunciation when we were in our land. This is proven from what is said regarding <em>keriat shema</em>, that one leaves a gap between similar-sounding letters, using as an example עשב בשדך. It appears the the pronunciation of <em>bet</em> in עשב is similar to its pronunciation in בשדך, where it is \"stressed\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's interesting to note that Rambam does not provide עשב בשדך as an example in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Reading_the_Shema.2.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Keriat Shema 2:9</a>. Perhaps in his time and place, the phonemes were sufficiently far apart that he was not concerned about running the two together.</p>\n\n\n",

The talmud (Sanhedrin 72a) records a principle that if someone is being pursued with murderous intent his is obligated to arise early and kill the potential assailant.\nאם בא להורגך השכם להורגו</p>\n<p>Based on this principle, did David have a halachic obligation to kill Saul rather than just cut his cloak, or at the very least injure him to prevent future pursuit?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>It would seem that it was pre-meditated act by Dovid.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Sukkah.5.4.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Sukkah 5:4</a> writes that Dovid had the inner turmoil of striking down a tzaddik.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּבֹ֥א שָׁא֖וּל לְהָסֵ֣ךְ אֶת־רַגְלָי֑ו. וַהֲוָה חֲמִי לֵיהּ מְשׁוּלְשָׁל צִיבְחַד וּמְסַלֵּיק צִיבְחַד. מְשׁוּלְשָׁל צִיבְחַד וּמְסַלֵּיק צִיבְחַד. אֲמַר [דָּוִד]. הֵיאַךְ מִינְגַּע בְּהָדֵין גּוּפָא צַדִּיקָא. הָדָא הִיא דוּ אָמַר לֵיהּ. הִנֵּה֩ הַיּ֨וֹם הַזֶּ֜ה רָא֣וּ עֵינֶ֗יךָ אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁר־נְתָֽנְךָ֩ הַיּ֤וֹם ׀ בְּיָדִי֙ בַּמְּעָרָ֔ה וְאָמַ֥ר לַֽהֲרָגְךָ֖. וָאָחוּס עָלֶיךָ אֵין כָּתוּב כָּאן אֶלָּא וַתָּ֣חָס עָלֶי֑ךָ. צְנִיעוּתָךְ חָסָת עָלֶיךָ.</p>\n<p>Shaul came to spread his feet (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.24.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Shmuel 24:3</a>) He saw him how he lifted a little and covered a little. [David] said, how could one touch such a righteous body. That is what he told him, behold, what your eyes saw today which today gave me in your hand in the cave and I could have killed you, etc. Is it not written “I had mercy on you” but it had mercy on you, your modesty had mercy on you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It could also be that he knew that Shaul's death would be brought exclusively by Hashem and he was not worthy to bring it.</p>\n<p>Indeed, it says later on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.26.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Shmuel 26:10</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֤אמֶר דָּוִד֙ חַי־ה' כִּ֥י אִם־ה' יִגֳּפֶ֑נּוּ אֽוֹ־יוֹמ֤וֹ יָבוֹא֙ וָמֵ֔ת א֧וֹ בַמִּלְחָמָ֛ה יֵרֵ֖ד וְנִסְפָּֽה</p>\n<p>And David went on, “As the LORD lives, the LORD Himself will strike him down, or his time will come and he will die, or he will go down to battle and perish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this in mind, note the midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bamidbar_Rabbah.15.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar Rabbah 15:16</a> which expressly answers your question.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכֵן אַתְּ מוֹצֵא בְּדָוִד שֶׁנָּפַל שָׁאוּל בְּיָדוֹ, מָה אָמַר דָּוִד (שמואל א כו, י): וַיֹּאמֶר דָּוִד חַי ה' כִּי אִם ה' יִגֳּפֶנּוּ אוֹ יוֹמוֹ יָבוֹא וגו', וְלָמָּה נִשְׁבַּע שְׁתֵּי פְּעָמִים, אָמַר רַבִּי שְׁמוּאֵל בַּר נַחְמָנִי הָיָה בָּא יִצְרוֹ וְאָמַר לוֹ אִלּוּ נָפַלְתָּ אַתָּה בְּיָדוֹ לֹא הָיָה מְרַחֵם עָלֶיךָ וְהֹרֶגְךָ, <strong>מִן הַתּוֹרָה מֻתָּר לְהָרְגוֹ, בָּא לְהָרְגְּךָ הַשְׁכֵּם לְהָרְגוֹ, שֶׁהֲרֵי רוֹדֵף הוּא. לְפִיכָךְ קָפַץ וְנִשְׁבַּע שְׁתֵּי פְּעָמִים חַי ה', שֶׁאֵינוֹ הוֹרְגוֹ.</strong></p>\n<p>Thus you find it so with David, for when Saul fell into his hands, what did David say (in I Sam. 26:10)? “And David said, ‘As the Lord lives, the Lord shall smite him; either he will die when his day comes [or he will go down and perish in battle; the Lord forbid that I lay my hand on the Lord's anointed].’” Why did he swear two times? R. Samuel bar Nahman said, “His [evil] drive came and said to him, ‘If you had fallen into his hand, he would have shown you no mercy and killed you. <strong>[Moreover] according to the Torah it is permissible to kill him – one who comes to kill you, rise up and kill him – since here he is pursuing [you].’ He therefore hastened to swear two times, ‘As the Lord lives, I will not kill him.</strong>’”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

So if the material of choice in Brooklyn is wood, the ruling would also apply to wood.  <strong>הכל כמנהג המדינה</strong> is a general statement.</p>\n<p>If you mean do we force people to comply with  <strong>הכל כמנהג המדינה</strong>, I believe there is a misunderstanding in the question. The <strong>משנה</strong> does not mean that <strong>בית דין</strong> intervenes on its own to force people to build according to <strong>מנהג המדינה</strong>. Such <strong>משניות</strong> generally deal with a dispute between the two parties - <strong>דיני ממונות</strong>. If both agree <strong>and no one else is impacted</strong>, the relevant parties can do as they please. <strong>הכל מנהג המדינה</strong> means that if there is disagreement among two parties, one wanting <strong>מנהג המדינה</strong>, the other not, the one wanting <strong>מנהג המדינה</strong>  prevails.</p>\n<p>In the event of a dispute, in the USA, you cannot force (Jew or non-Jew) through a <strong>דין תורה</strong> based on <strong>מנהג המדינה</strong>, unless both agree to go to <strong>בית דין</strong> to judge that dispute according to that <strong>בית דין</strong>. Then, since you have both at that point signed a binding agreement that said <strong>בית דין</strong> can arbitrate the dispute, you can 'force' your adversary, according to the remedies that <strong>בית דין</strong> recommends, should they find in your favor.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, <strong>דנא דמלכותא דנא</strong>, and you must settle your dispute in civil court:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bethdin.org/minhag-ha-sochrim-jewish-laws-incorporation-of-mercantile-custom-and-marketplace-norms/#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em><strong>Ha-Kol Ke-Minhag Ha-Medinah</strong></em></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Crucially, the Talmud defers to minhag ha-medinah even when it\ndiverges from the halakhah’s normal set of rules. For instance,\naccording to Jewish law, the workday begins at sunrise and concludes\nat nightfall: If you hired a worker and specified that the work hours\nare defined by din Torah (lit. “Torah law”), the workday would\ncommence at sunrise and conclude at nightfall.[10] Similarly, if you\nwere to hire a worker in a city with no prevailing custom, and you\ndidn’t specify the work hours, the agreement is filled in by din\nTorah, and the worker is obligated to work from sunrise to nightfall.</p>\n<p>Yet the presence of workplace norms overrides the default din Torah.\nAccording to the Mishnah, if you hire a worker in a town with\nestablished workplace norms (e.g., a nine to five workday), the\nunspecified content of the employment agreement is filled out by\nworkplace norms, not by the workday defined by din Torah.

Does this make any sense?</p>\n<p>The clear question is: Do the actual words of Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Melachem 11</a> rule, <strong>as matter of halachah</strong>, that the concept of Moshiach ben Yosef <strong>does not exist</strong>? A simple YES or NO answer with the logic and/or sources backing it would be preferable.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>There is no obvious reason to assume Rambam rules that Moshiach Ben Yosef doesn't exist from his lack of mention. The Rambam himself states that one shouldn't over-contemplate the unfolding of the redemption, as we don't know much. In this halachic work, he only records four halachos. The first collects all of the things we must and must not believe about Moshiach Ben David (and there is no mention of M\"BY for either), the second is one of the halachot that he will follow, and 3-4 are halachot on how to identify Moshiach Ben David.</p>\n<p>The tradition we have about Moshiach Ben Yosef is very mixed and unclear. It appears to be a tradition of Chazal, and is not a certainty. Some hold he will only need to come if we need him (for teshuva). So Rambam doesn't see any halachot regarding him so therefore doesn't mention him in his halachic work.</p>\n<p><strong>So no, Rambam doesn't seem to hold that he will NOT come. Just we don't have any halachot regarding him</strong>. <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/101747/jewish/Mashiach-ben-Yossef.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">This Chabad</a> page by R Schochet presumes that Rambam didn't mention him due to these uncertainties, and brings all the various opinions by other Rishonim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The simple answer is no.</p>\n<p>The Lubavitcher Rebbe wrote a letter about this in 5704 which was printed many years later in the first edition of the Kuntress Torato Shel Moshiach.</p>\n<p>In that letter, the Rebbe brought many of the citations brought by Rambam from Shas related to different activities  that Moshiach is engaged in and how they fall out chronologically. He also demonstrated with related sources that some pertained to Moshiach ben Yosef and some pertained to Moshiach ben David.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe then noted that in the Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim, Rambam does not mention explicitly the terms <em>Moshiach ben Yosef</em> or <em>Moshiach ben David</em>, but uses the innovative terms of <em>Presumed to be Moshiach</em> and <em>Moshiach with certainty</em>.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe points out that this is in spite of the fact that Rambam was certainly familiar with these traditional distinctions.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of that letter, the Rebbe writes that from this <em>it is concluded that <strong>the view of Rambam</strong> is that <strong>Moshiach ben Yosef</strong> and <strong>Moshiach ben David</strong> are speaking of <strong>a single individual</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>For what it is worth, this conclusion of the Rebbe also seems to be supported by the plain meaning from the Prophet <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.37.15-28?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 37:15-28</a> that is read as the Haftorah to parshat VaYigash.</p>\n<p>For more detailed discussion of this subject, see the following: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/59634/7303\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/59634/7303</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>As there is no mention of Moshiach ben Yosef in any of Rambam's writings (to the best of my knowledge) I think it is reasonable to conclude that he did not subscribe to that tradition. He mentions the idea of two Meshichim in Melachim 11:1 however he says that one refers to David and the other to his descendant—King Moshiach. In 12:2 he says that it seems that a Navi—not Moshiach—will come to straighten out the Jews prior to Moshiachs arrival. It is axiomatic to Rambam that Moshiach is descended from David (via Shelomo specifically), ostensibly negating a Moshiach from any other Shevet. Additionally, Rambam's schema of what this Navi and Moshiach will do seems to obviate the need for anyone else.</p>\n<p>As far as these details go bear in mind Rambam's own words in 12:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All these and similar matters cannot be definitely known by man until they occur for these matters are undefined in the prophets' words and even the wise men have no established tradition regarding these matters except their own interpretation of the verses. Therefore, there is a controversy among them regarding these matters.\nRegardless of the debate concerning these questions, neither the order of the occurrence of these events or their precise detail are among the fundamental principles of the faith. A person should not occupy himself with the Aggadot and homiletics concerning these and similar matters, nor should he consider them as essentials, for study of them will neither bring fear or love of God.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Talmud (Megilla 22b) tells us of certain rabbis who didn't fall on their face in prayer even though the rest of the congregation did. Seemingly the same logic applies.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, note the modern practice of many Sefardim to not fall on their face is rooted in a kabbalistic concern of not maintaining appropriate focus when reciting Psalm 25:1. There is no reason not to fall on one's face if supplicating using Psalm 6 for instance as Ashkenazim commonly do. There's also no reason a Sefardi can't choose to say Psalm 6 one time as there is no fixed text for Tachanun. A Sefardi who wants to say Psalm 25 as he is used to can always do so in addition to Psalm 6 (or any other supplication done while fallen).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Theodical arguments from Bereshit Rabbah 69:5 - why are they rarely if ever used?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.65.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabbah 69:5</a>, Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaacov prayed for aging, suffering and sickness, and before this, these conditions did not exist in the human experience.</p>\n<p>The reasons are given for each one, and each would be a good answer for theodical questions. Aging was introduced to give a crown of wisdom. Suffering was introduced to provide earthly atonement (rather than leaving it all for Gehinom). Sickness was introduced to provide a wake up call to teshuva (repentance) before death.</p>\n<p>All of the arguments are used by Chazal on their own, and also in post-Talmudic works, however I have never seen the Midrash itself quoted as a theodical answer - specifically saying that \"Hashem didn't initially do this, because He might have agreed that these conditions are difficult, but when we invited these conditions ourselves then He was willing to introduce them, and their benefits\".</p>\n<p>My question is, why is this argument not used, and if it is, why so rarely?</p>\n<p>If it is used, I'd appreciate to know where, and how. I also wouldn't be opposed to people offering their own rendition of an argument based on their own learning, so long as it is sourced and not just a personal opinion (start a chat for that as I would be happy to hear it unofficially)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I seem to remember this being at least part of subject of a book by Rabbi Adin Even Yisroel Steinsaltz, A”H, called, “<a href=\"https://korenpub.com/products/the-long-shorter-way\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Long Shorter Way</a>”.</p>\n<p>I can’t recall if he actually quoted the source you are mentioning, but it was the contrast between “The short, long way”, which was a very brief period until the final redemption combined with the actual, intense spiritual fires of Gehinom, etc. and what Avraham requested, which was “The long, shorter way”, a very long exile with the hardships and suffering of this world softened by comparison.</p>\n<p>I seem to recall some mention about the introduction of aging with Avraham because he was indistinguishable from his son, Yitzchok.</p>\n<p>If you haven’t read it, it’s a wonderful read in English.</p>\n<p>Regarding the introduction of sickness, this follows the commentary of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hezekiah ben Manoach</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.48.1?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni to Bereshit 48:1</a> which says that sickness was introduced at the request of Yaacov Avinu to be able to prepare for his death.</p>\n<p>Borrowing from the concept discussed by Steinsaltz, this is actually one of the fundamental processes that the Creator of us all implanted within the universe. You can think of it in the context of an idea borrowed from High School or first year College chemistry, namely <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoichiometry\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Stoichiometric equations</a></em>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Stoichiometry</em> is founded on <em><strong>the law of conservation of mass</strong></em> (<em>For any system closed to all transfers of matter and energy, the mass of the system must remain constant over time, as the system's mass cannot change, so the quantity can neither be added nor be removed. Therefore, the quantity of mass is conserved over time.</em>) where the total mass of the reactants equals the total mass of the products.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Everything is always in perfect balance. The only variation relates to the rate of the reaction and in which direction it goes, toward products or reactants. The rate and direction can be changed by introducing energy or catalysts (<em>catalysts are independent of and not part of the actual reaction</em>).</p>\n\n\n",

They conclude therefore that, because the Zionists went ahead and did it anyway, it is treif, and should be opposed.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe differed from other Chassidic Rebbes in that he did not conclude that the Israeli Zionist government is treif. He concluded that what we currently see in Israel <em>is not a true state</em>. Needing permission from America and worrying about world opinion is the proof.</p>\n<p>So he may be philosophically opposed to the secularism in the Israeli government, but sees it as salvageable, rather than treif.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Friedman was a translator for the Rebbe and knew his positions well. This explanation might be an over simplification though, so I look forward to seeing more answers to this interesting question.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Here is what his predecessors said. It sounds like they were in agreement in principle, but that his statements apply <em>bedi'eved</em>, and theirs <em>l'chatchila</em>. After the fact, turns out the Zionists didn't force any redemption, so the Rebbe maintained a positive attitude towards improving the state of Israel, rather than decrying it.</p>\n<p><sub>Once again, I am not an expert, so I look forward to other answers that go into more detail.</sub></p>\n<p>The 5th Rebbe, Rabbi Shalom Dov Ber Schneersohn, the Rebbe Rashab, joined forces with other leading Ultra Orthodox Rabbonim and penned a letter called <a href=\"https://chabadpedia.co.il/index.php/%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Layesharim</a>, a letter laying out a religious opposition to zionism.

Is it not forbidden even to force the end with excessive\nprayher (Rashi Ketuvot 111a)? All the more so that with power and\nwordly methods, that is, to leave exile by force, we are not\npermitted... And this is against our true hope, that Hashem will bring\nus Moshiach Tzidkeinu soon and our redemption will come through Hashem\nHimself\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the 6th Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, the Rebbe Rayatz, in Igrot Kodesh 947:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am against the proposed Jewish state. It would be a calamity for the\nJews, and in a short time they will realize what a calamity it is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and ibid 106:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do not know the nature and goal of this organization [which I have\nbeen asked to join]. If its goal is to strengthen Torah and mitzvot,\nwe already have our ways and methods, the smoothed path we have\ninherited from our holy teachers, in which we lived and which we will\ngive over to our children. And if its goal is for the building of\nEretz Yisrael, as its name indicates - we were once a great nation and\nkingdom, by the grace of the most high G-d, but because of His anger\nat our sins, after thousands of prophetic warnings, we were driven\nfrom our holy Land. Hashem our G-d but us in exile, and promised us\nthat at a time known only to Him He would redeem us. And it is clear\nthat we will not return to the Land by the power of our hands. G-d,\nWho placed us in exile - it is He Wh will redeem His holy people, and\nwith His holy arm will He save us, and He will bring us back to Him\nand to our holy Land, not the organization of \"Fund to Build the Land\"\nor any similar organization.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: I have not got access to these sefarim, so I can't confirm if these translations are correct. I found them on an anti-zionist flier in my shul (nb I don't daven in an anti-zionist shul, I don't know where it came from).

Similarly, after one has studied a matter from the Oral Torah, one may recite the Kaddish deRabbanan. See the Magen Avraham, who concludes that this applies specifically if, afterward, at least a bit of Aggadah (narrative or ethical teachings) is recited—then the Kaddish deRabbanan may be said, since the essence of this Kaddish was established in connection with words of Aggadah. <strong>Therefore, the custom of all Israel is to say, after Pirkei Avot and after Bameh Madlikin, the statement of Rabbi Chananya ben Akashya, or \"Rabbi Elazar said in the name of Rabbi Chanina: Torah scholars increase peace...\" etc.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>According to this, care should be taken that when studying Mishnayot, one should conclude the study with the statement of Rabbi Chananya ben Akashya or something similar, so that afterward the Kaddish deRabbanan can be recited.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The original source for this can be found in Rashi to Pirkei Avot 6:11</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רַבִּי חֲנַנְיָא בֶּן עֲקַשְׁיָא אוֹמֵר וְכוּ'. לֹא אָמַר לְמִלְּתֵיהּ גַּבֵּי מַסֶּכֶת אָבוֹת, אֶלָּא בְּמַסֶּכֶת מַכּוֹת בְּאֵלּוּ הֵן הַלּוֹקִין, <strong>וּלְפִי שֶׁיֵּשׁ בָּהּ סִיּוּם נָאֶה נָהֲגוּ כָּל הָעָם לְאָמְרוֹ בְּסוֹף כָּל פֶּרֶק וּפֶרֶק, לְפִי שֶׁאֵין אוֹמְרִים קַדִּישׁ עַל הַמִּשְׁנָה אֶלָּא עַל הָאַגָּדָה</strong>, דְּאָמַר מַר [סוֹטָה מט.] וִיהֵא שְׁמֵיהּ רַבָּא דְּאַגַּדְתָּא.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chananya ben Akashia says, etc.: He did not say his statement concerning Tractate Avot, but rather in Tractate Makkot in [the chapter entitled] Ellu hen HaLokin. <strong>And since there is a nice ending to it, all the people are accustomed to say it at the end of each and every chapter, since we do not say Kaddish over mishnah but rather over aggadah</strong> (homiletical teachings). As the master said (Sotah 49a), (\"Upon what does the world survive? Upon the Kedushah of the order) and upon the [declaration in Kaddish,] 'May His name be exalted' of aggadah.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly it seems very fitting to bring down the Rambams explanation of this Mishnah and its meaning which really emphasizes specifically why it was chosen to be said before Kadish (although the does not mention this directly it can be applied based on the Rashi and Mishnah Berurah above):</p>\n<p>Rambam Mishnah Makkot 3:16</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רבי חנניא בן עקשיא אומר רצה הקב״ה לזכות את ישראל כו׳ – מעקרי האמונה בתורה כי כשיקיים אדם מצוה מתרי״ג מצות כראוי וכהוגן ולא ישתף עמה כוונה מכוונת העולם בשום פנים אלא שיעשה אותה לשמה מאהבה כמו שבארתי לך הנה זכה בה לחיי העולם הבא ועל זה אמר רבי חנניא כי המצות בהיותם הרבה אי אפשר שלא יעשה אדם בחייו אחת מהם על מתכונתה ושלמותה ובעשותו אותה המצוה תחיה נפשו באותו מעשה וממה שיורה על העקר הזה מה ששאל ר׳ חנניא בן תרדיון מה אני לחיי עוה״ב והשיבו המשיב כלום בא מעשה לידך כלומר נזדמן לך לעשות מצוה כהוגן השיבו כי נזדמנה לו מצות צדקה על דרך שלמות ככל מה שאפשר וזכה לחיי העוה״ב ופירוש הפסוק (ישעי׳ מ״ב) ה׳ חפץ למען צדקו לצדק את ישראל למען כי יגדיל תורה ויאדיר:</p>\n<p>\"Rabbi Chananya ben Akashya says: The Holy One, Blessed be He, desired to give merit to Israel, etc.\" – This is among the fundamental principles of faith in the Torah. For when a person fulfills even one of the 613 commandments properly and fittingly, without mixing into it any worldly intent in any way, but rather performs it for its own sake, out of love—as I have explained to you—then through that commandment, <strong>he merits eternal life in the World to Come.</strong></p>\n<p>And this is what Rabbi Chananya is saying: since there are so many commandments, it is impossible that a person will go through life without at least once performing one of them in its ideal form and completeness. <strong>And by doing that one mitzvah, his soul is brought to life through that action.</strong></p>\n<p>One of the things that illustrates this principle is the incident where Rabbi Chananya ben Teradyon asked, \"Am I destined for life in the World to Come?\" The response he received was, \"Did any good deed ever come to your hand?\"—meaning: did an opportunity arise for you to perform a mitzvah properly? He answered that a mitzvah of charity had come his way, and he had performed it in as complete and perfect a way as possible. And so, he merited life in the World to Come.</p>\n<p>And this is the meaning of the verse (Isaiah 42): “The Lord desired, for the sake of His righteousness, to make the Torah great and glorious”—i.e., God wished to justify Israel (give them merit), and thus gave them many commandments, so that through them the Torah would be magnified and elevated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this we can understand why this specific Mishnah was chosen to be said before Kadish - just as the Mishnah teaches us that Hashem did us a chesed by giving us many opportunities to do good deeds and even if we do one of them properly and with good intentions we can merit The World to Come, so to by us saying this before Kadish with intention to elevate the soul of the deceased we can <em>bring their soul to life</em> which in additional to the Halachic reasons we say it, it becomes very fitting as a way to elevate the soul of the deceased.</p>\n<p>May we merit Moshiahc speedily and the resurrection of the deceased so we should have no reason to say mourners Kadish</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See the following passage extracted from <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/4589/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://outorah.org/p/4589/</a> <em>The Five Types of Kaddish</em> by Rabbi Jack Abramowitz</p>\n<p>The Rabbis’ Kaddish (“Kaddish D’Rabbanan”) is recited after a public lecture in the Oral Torah. <strong>There is an opinion that the primary practice is to recite this Kaddish after learning Aggadah</strong>, the non-legal portions of the Talmud or Midrash. <strong>This is based on Sotah 49a, which tells us that since the Temple was destroyed, the world endures because of the recitation of Kedusha in Uva L’Tziyon and the “yehei shmei rabbah” in the Kaddish after Aggadah.</strong> Accordingly, the practice has become to recite the Aggadic passage of “Rabbi Chananya…” (Makkos 23b) between a public Torah lecture and Kaddish. Since it is related to Torah study, the Rabbis’ Kaddish includes a passage on behalf of “the Jews, the teachers, their students, their students’ students, and all those who engage in the study of Torah.”</p>\n<p>The opinion that Kaddish D’Rabbanan is said after learning a piece of Aggadah is that of the Mishna Berurah at 54:9 <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.54?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.54?lang=bi</a>\nאו אחר תפלה וכמו שכתבנו בס\"ק הקודם וכן אחר שלמד איזה ענין מתורה שבע\"פ יוכל לומר קדיש דרבנן ועיין במ\"א שמסיק דדוקא אם אמר אח\"ז עכ\"פ מקצת דבר אגדה ואז יוכל לומר הקדיש דרבנן כי עיקר הקדיש זה נתקן על דבר אגדה וע\"כ <strong>מנהג כל ישראל לומר אחר פרקי אבות ואחר במה מדליקין המאמר דר' חנניא בן עקשיא או אר\"א א\"ר =אמר רבי= חנינא</strong> ת\"ח מרבים שלום וכו'. ולפ\"ז יש ליזהר כשלומדים משניות יאמרו בסוף הלימוד המאמר דר' חנניא בן עקשיא וכדומה כדי שיהיו יוכלו לומר עי\"ז אח\"כ הקדיש דרבנן\nand the custom is mentioned of reciting either the Rabbi Chananya passage (Makkot 23b) or Rabbi Eleazar said in the name of Rabbi Hanina who said: \"The disciples of the sages [talmidei chachamim] increase peace in the world ..\" (Berachot 64a)</p>\n\n\n",

I recently heard of the concept of an electric pizza maker. It is basically 2 heated trays of metal that cover the dough from above and below.\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rUNsiFFk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/rUNsiFFk.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>To do this I will need to buy kosher for Passover flour, and make sure that the entire process is less than 18 minutes. However, what care needs to be taken so that the pizza cooker stays kosher for Passover? I won't use the device throughout the year, it will be with my Passover supplies. However, is there any issue that dough was in the device and then after I took out the matzo, some crumbs remained, and after 18 minutes turned into Chametz?</p>\n<p>There are two issues that I can think of,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How can I make sure not to make Chametz on Passover?</li>\n<li>After cooking, does the fact that the device cooks crumbs for longer than 18 minutes, cause the device to be not Kosher for Passover?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I don't see how one can make matzos at home with a pizza maker on passover and keep to all the laws.</p>\n<p>The issues you brought up are important.  First of all, Kosher-for-Passover matzo baking requires an especially hot oven.  There are many others details as well.   Here is one source: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/holidays/passover/pesach_cdo/aid/5484651/jewish/Can-We-Bake-Our-Own-Matzah.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">can we bake our own matzos (chabad)</a></p>\n<p>Besides for the many potential problems in amateur matzo baking, baking matzo over the holiday is even more problematic, as even the smallest amount of chametz cannot be nullified.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There's a lot of misconceptions here so I'll try and lay out the facts. As of now I will leave my answer unsourced. As others know I tend to edit my answers a lot to bring in the sources later.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The entire process does not need to be done in 18 minutes. You have 18 minutes from the moment you stop kneading the dough to put that matzah in the oven/hot cooking surface. Ideally you should not wait those 18 minutes but start baking as soon as you are done kneading.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The material of the cooking surfaces of your pizza maker is very important for this discussion. Some materials can't be kashered, so if you accidentally make hameitz one time you may not ever be able to use that pizza oven for matzah again. But if it's made of a material that can be kashered then you don't have to worry.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>One should practice extensively BEFORE Pesah. That way you have all the answers and problems worked out. In terms of crumbs, as long as they are cooked they are not and will never be chameitz. But ideally one should measure out the dough so there are no crumbs. Personally I try and grind my own whole wheat flour because the flour is way cleaner to deal with (it's heavier so it doesn't fly all over the place) and it makes less crumbs. But it definitely makes less \"fluffy\" matzah.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I don't know if you can get Kasher l'Fesah flour all year long, but if you can kasher the pizza maker then again I'd practice with regular flour (which is allowed by the S'A anyways) and then Kasher your Pizza Maker before Pesah</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As @DoubleAA has mentioned, I would not try and learn just from reading sources. At the end of the day you are making bread, there's a feel and a look to dough. If you've never made a dough before, you should learn from literally anyone how to roll dough and deal with dough. Once you've learned that, then you can rely on reading sources a bit more. There are also videos you can watch online, but they still won't give you a feel for the dough</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Aside from Aish, I do not know anyother website/ WhatsApp group that offer this great help. Any suggestions?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Here in the UK we have <a href=\"https://www.federation.org.uk/shailatext/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaila Text</a> made up of group of local, experienced Rabbonim.</p>\n<p>The blurb reads as follows (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>The ShailaText service was never intended to take the place of someone having their own Rov</strong>, someone who knows and understands them and with whom they have an ongoing relationship. However, for people who for whatever reason have not yet managed to establish such a figure in their lives, or who are not able to reach their own Rov, it’s crucial that other avenues exist for them to find answers to their shailos.</p>\n<p>In its first year, ShailaText was <strong>contacted by over 1200 individuals, and answered nearly 7000 questions</strong> on a variety of topics, ranging from kashrus to hilchos Shabbos and yom tov and Taharas Hamishpocha.</p>\n<p>ShailaText guarantees to respond to shailos within <strong>four working hours</strong>. When an SMS is sent to the ShailaText number, it is received by an administrator who ascertains the general topic of the question. Certain shailos are immediately directed to the correct department in the Federation, for example a query on the kashrus of a particular product will go to the Kashrus Department, and a more intricate shaila in Choshen Mishpot would be forwarded to the Beis Din (although as a general rule, such shailos are beyond the scope of the service to respond to in their complexity).</p>\n<p>The majority of questions received by the service, however, are forwarded to a team of Rabbonim with many years of combined experience and wide expertise in different halachic areas. <strong>The ShailaText Rabbonim receive the shailos via an interactive mobile platform; they discuss the shaila amongst themselves and provide a response, with validation via a general consensus</strong>. The final answer is then sent back to the administrator and passed on to the original sho’el.</p>\n<p>This process ensures anonymity every step of the way – no information other than the mobile phone number of the questioner, and any other details they choose to reveal, are seen by the administrator, and the Rabbonim themselves do not even see the number. Many highly sensitive shailos have been processed by the team, some of which may never have been asked had confidentiality and anonymity not been assured in this manner. From time to time situations may arise where further discussion is need – in these cases the sho’el is provided with the phone number of a ShailaText Rov and invited to contact them at their convenience – or if preferred, and with permission, their number is passed on for the Rov to contact them. ShailaText will also encourage the questioner to contact the appropriate organisation to receive further help and support where needed, particularly in situations where their mental health or shalom bayis is in apparent jeopardy.</p>\n<p>Finally, where the shailos received by the service are very complicated with far-reaching ramifications, the ShailaText team is fortunate to have the <strong>full backing of the Federation Beis Din – they meet regularly with Rav Zimmerman, Rov of the Federation and Av Beis Din, and refer shailos to him whenever necessary</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This organization sounds right for what you need.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kavhalacha.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://kavhalacha.org/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>While not an INSTANT chat service, the Chabad.org ask the Rabbi page allows you to send an email to start a conversation, and once you are in contact with a rabbi who responds to your email request, you can talk on the phone with him about the topic or chat with him in real time in another chat service.</p>\n<p>(Source: I've done this)</p>\n\n\n",

Showing such respect and reverence for the Torah during prayer that we do not turn our backs on Aron HaKodesh, it is as if we are in front of Kadosh, Boruch Hu.\nHow ancient is this custom? — I don't know... But I have heard that Cohen Gadol also did this in relation to Kodesh Hakodashim.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Chananel_on_Exodus.32.15.1?ven=Eliyahu_Munk,_HaChut_Hameshulash&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Chananel, on Shemot 32:15</a></p>\n<p>ויפן וירד משה מן ההר. We learn from this word ויפן, he turned around,\nthat Moses descended while facing the cloud just as he had done when\nascending the mountain. In other words, just as he had ascended facing\nthe cloud, he now descended keeping his face toward the cloud, walking backwards. The High Priest, on the Day of Atonement, emulated this when withdrawing from the Holy of Holies by walking backwards after having offered the incense before the lid of the Holy Ark, the kapporet, as well as some of the blood of the two offerings on behalf of the people as well as sprinkling some on the dividing curtain. We have a similar verse in Chronicles II 1,13 describing Solomon’s approach to the altar that was standing in Givon at that time. Even though one could say that the words ויבא שלמה לבמה אשר בגבעון ירושליםmean: “Solomon returned from the altar in Givon to Jerusalem,” [seeing Givon at that time was certainly not part of Jerusalem Ed.] the correct interpretation is that he withdrew in the same way as he had approached. The point of all this was to conform to the principle of שויתי ה' לנגדי תמיד, “I am keeping Hashem in front of Me at all times.” (Psalms 16,8) One does not turn one’s back on G’d. The Mishnah, Yuma 52 states: “in the manner he had entered he also exited.” This is also the way Leviticus 16,24 describes this, writing: “he exited and completed the ritual of his own burnt offering as well as that of the people.” These words have been interpreted by our sages to mean that the word לבמה “to the altar,” must also be read as מבמה.”from the altar,” when he was headed back to Jerusalem (Yuma 53). There is a precedent for this in Numbers 31,21, where the words הבאים למלחמה, must also mean הבאים מן המלחמה, “the ones who were returning from the war.” How do we know that indeed the Shechinah was on the mountain at the time Moses descended? In Deuteronomy 9,15 where Moses refers to his descent from the mountain, he adds the words: “and the mountain was burning in fire while the two tablets of the covenant were on my hands.” We learn from all of this that the student, when taking leave of his teacher, walks backwards until the face of his teacher is no longer directly visible to him. (Yuma 53)  This is also the reason why, at the end of the principal prayer the amidah, we step three steps backwards, as if to take leave of the G’d Whom we had faced and addressed before. (Shulchan Aruch Orach Chayim section 123).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Could the messiah be adopted into the lineage of David like Jesus and if no why?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have a friend who is an evangelical pastor for a baptist Church and we were talking about the criteria for the messiah, one of the criteria is obviously being that they had to be from the linage of David, but the pastors response was that the messiah could have been adopted into the linage and inherited the linage of David, meaning that Christ could be considered the messiah, but how would you respond to this?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>Nope. Not at all in any way whatsoever in the slightest even remotely.</p>\n<p>First of all, Rambam says the criteria of Moshiach is specifically NOT what yushkuh has DONE, and yushkuh is completely and absolutely disqualified as the Messiah according to all Jewish Torah sources completely.</p>\n<p>Regarding the question of if the Messiah can be adopted into the davidic dynasty: nope. Not at all in any way.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently\ncontemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the\nWritten Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all\nof Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches\nin its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance,\nconsider him Mashiach.</p>\n<p>If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and\ngathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Mashiach.</p>\n<p>He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to\nserve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: \"I will transform the\npeoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of\nGod and serve Him with one purpose.\"</p>\n<p>If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not\nthe redeemer promised by the Torah. Rather, he should be considered as\nall the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who\ndied. God caused him to arise only to test the many, as Daniel 11:35\nstates: \"And some of the wise men will stumble, to try them, to\nrefine, and to clarify until the appointed time, because the set time\nis in the future.\"</p>\n<p>Jesus of Nazareth who aspired to be the Mashiach and was executed by\nthe court was also alluded to in Daniel's prophecies, as ibid. 11:14\nstates: \"The vulgar among your people shall exalt themselves in an\nattempt to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.\"</p>\n<p>Can there be a greater stumbling block than Christianity? All the\nprophets spoke of Mashiach as the redeemer of Israel and their savior\nwho would gather their dispersed and strengthen their observance of\nthe mitzvot. In contrast, Christianity caused the Jews to be slain by\nthe sword, their remnants to be scattered and humbled, the Torah to be\naltered, and the majority of the world to err and serve a god other\nthan the Lord.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the intent of the Creator of the world is not within the\npower of man to comprehend, for His ways are not our ways, nor are His\nthoughts, our thoughts. Ultimately, all the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth\nand that Ishmaelite who arose after him will only serve to prepare the\nway for Mashiach's coming and the improvement of the entire world,\nmotivating the nations to serve God together as Tzephaniah 3:9 states:\n\"I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will\ncall upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.\"</p>\n<p>How will this come about? The entire world has already become filled\nwith the mention of Mashiach, Torah, and mitzvot. These matters have\nbeen spread to the furthermost islands to many stubborn-hearted\nnations. They discuss these matters and the mitzvot of the Torah,\nsaying: \"These mitzvot were true, but were already negated in the\npresent age and are not applicable for all time.\"</p>\n<p>Others say: \"Implied in the mitzvot are hidden concepts that can not\nbe understood simply. The Mashiach has already come and revealed those\nhidden truths.\"</p>\n<p>When the true Messianic king will arise and prove successful, his\nposition becoming exalted and uplifted, they will all return and\nrealize that their ancestors endowed them with a false heritage and\ntheir prophets and ancestors caused them to err.</p>\n<p>ד וְאִם יַעֲמֹד מֶלֶךְ מִבֵּית דָּוִד הוֹגֶה בַּתּוֹרָה וְעוֹסֵק\nבְּמִצְוֹת כְּדָוִד אָבִיו. כְּפִי תּוֹרָה שֶׁבִּכְתָב וְשֶׁבְּעַל\nפֶּה. וְיָכֹף כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל לֵילֵךְ בָּהּ וּלְחַזֵּק בִּדְקָהּ.\nוְיִלָּחֵם מִלְחֲמוֹת ה'. הֲרֵי זֶה בְּחֶזְקַת שֶׁהוּא מָשִׁיחַ.

    "content": "# The Zohar on Gog Magog and the Erev Rav\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Satmar Rav (Al HaGeulah Ve Al Temurah, siman 61) mentions a Zohar that says that during the war of Gog and Magog, there would be some people from B'nei Yisroel joining with the forces of Gog U'Magog due to the forces of the Erev Rav - (שבמלחמת גוג ומגוג יהיו גם מבני ישראל).</p>\n<p>I looked online, but could not find any Zohar that describes that how during the days leading up to the battle of Gog and Magog, even some from within Israel will join the forces of Gog, due to their spiritual degradation and disconnection from the Torah and its teachings.</p>\n<p><strong>Does anyone know where this can be found?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are actually many places within the Zohar discussing and explaining the concept of the Erev Rav, how they were a collection of the many non-Jewish nations who came out of Egypt together with the children of Israel and mixed in with the population, for example: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Nasso.4.33?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Nasso 4:33</a>, Zohar, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Ki_Tisa.11.59?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Tisa 11:59</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Ki_Tisa.11.68?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Ki Tisa 11:68</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.20.228?vhe=Hebrew_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Bereshit 20:228</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.20.224?vhe=Hebrew_Translation&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Bereshit 20:224</a>, Zohar, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Ki_Tisa.11.60?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Tisa 11:60</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.19.222?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Bereshit 19:222</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.21.245?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Bereshit 21:245</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar%2C_Bereshit.21.246?vhe=Vocalized_Zohar,_Israel_2013&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar, Bereshit 21:246</a></p>\n<p>These citations are among those explicitly cited by the Satmar Rebbe in קונטרס על הגאולה ועל התמורה in the balance of Sief 61 which you ask about.</p>\n<p>The Satmar Rebbe asks how can anyone actually question <em><strong>that there will be such Jews at the time of the redemption</strong></em> who will behave like this and assist Gog and his soldiers in fighting against <strong>מלך המשיח</strong>. (<em>It is worth noting that the Zohar makes this connection to those who oppose Moshiach ben Yosef specifically.</em>)</p>\n<p>That there are numerous examples from Jewish history of people like this. The Satmar Rebbe even uses a telling term to describe them calling them בריון.</p>\n<p>This expression is often translated as the <em>Palace Guards</em> or <em>Palace Soldiers</em>, but can also have a connotation of <em>Outlaws</em> or <em>Rebels</em>. (<em>The connection to the Palace is referring to G-d’s Palace, Jerusalem. That these guards or soldiers are actually supposed to be defending and protecting Jerusalem.</em>)</p>\n<p>Being composed of 5 letters, it suggests that it is a compound word, which most obviously lends itself to בר יון or <em>Greek Son</em>. That is an allusion to Hellenized Jews, meaning assimilated to non-Jewish culture. This is in fact how Midrash describes Armilus and his followers.</p>\n<p>The Erev Rav are that remnant of Jews in Israel and elsewhere, who have been and are cooperating with the plan from the two biologically related leaders of wealthiest nation on earth during that time. The two related leaders were President Bush 41 and 43. The primary leader of the Erev Rav in Israel during this process was Shimon Peres who was instrumental in the entire Oslo process. (<em>For more background on Gog and Magog, see here:</em> <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/137627/7303\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/137627/7303</a>) But the fallout from all of that continues even today.</p>\n<p>There was a tradition which Moshe had from Avraham, that when the Torah would actually be given, anyone from the nations would again be given the opportunity to become a part of Israel. This is why Moshe, <em>the paradigm for <strong>the Shepherd of faith</strong></em>, insisted upon bringing them out together with the children of Israel. The Zohar records that G-d  told Moshe not to do this because they would be trouble for the Jewish people ultimately. This is why midrash and Zohar refer to the Erev Rav not as <em>Bnai Yisroel</em> בני ישראל, but <em>your people</em>, meaning Moshe's people (<em>see Shemot 34:10, Devarim 3:26, 9:12</em>) or the <em>Congregation of Israel</em> עדת ישראל or the <em>Community of Israel</em> קהילת ישראל.</p>\n<p>So another dimension of the final redemption is that in many ways, it will parallel what took place in the first redemption from Egypt. And this would seem to include the connection of the Erev Rav, Moshe's people, <em>no matter how small or large</em>, with the children of Israel.</p>\n<p>This is also how it is taught in Sefer <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Agra_DeKala%2C_Ki_Tisa.35?vhe=Agra_DeKala,_Brooklyn,_N.Y.,_1993&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Agra d'Kalla, parshat Ki Tisa 35</a> which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והביטו אחרי משה (שמות לג ח). תרין. דין ואידך והביטו את אשר דקרו (זכריה יב י), מה בכאן אית דרשו ליה לשבח, ואית דדרשו וכו' (קידושין ל\"ג ע\"ב) , ותרווייהו קשוט דהערב רב לא האמינו ואמרו מה שאמרו, <strong>כמו כן התם במשיח בן יוסף, ישראל הצדיקים</strong> יביטו ויאמרו כי הם גרמו, וישובו אל י\"י ויאמינו בו, <strong>והערב רב יתחברו עם גיא המון גוג ויהיו לחרפות</strong> עמהם:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The section of Zohar you are looking for is most likely in parshat Toldot, starting on page 139a, beginning with the words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תנן מ׳ שנה קודם קבוץ גליות לתחיית המתים כו׳</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We learned that <em>the ingathering of the exiles</em> precedes the resurrection of the dead by forty years.</p>\n<p>The ingathering mentioned here is the same one mentioned in the Amidah prayer. The <em>exiles</em> being referred to are the 288 Holy Sparks which fell into this world at the beginning of Creation.</p>\n<p>Their ingathering is accomplished through the histalkut of the soul of Moshiach from this world. The sparks ascend with his soul back to their original source.</p>\n<p>From that event, there are 40 years until the beginning of resurrection. 7 years from the histalkut begins the 3rd and final part of the war of Gog u’Magog. That coincided with the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 and the war with the Taliban which began on Hoshanah Rabbah of that year and continues to this day.</p>\n<p>It is worth pointing out that in Sief 83-91 of this same section of the Zohar, it explicitly associates the Rasha’im with <strong>Hamas</strong> and connects it to the spiritual concept of the Nachash from Gan Eden.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְהוּדָה פָּתַח וְאָמַר, (תהילים י״א:ה׳) יְיָ צַדִּיק יִבְחָן וְרָשָׁע וְאוֹהֵב (ר\"ת נחש) חָמָס שָׂנְאָה נַפְשׁוֹ.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this context, it should also be noted that the Nachash, which brought death into the world, and its Tikkun (Moshiach) are related. That נחש and משיח share the same gematria.</p>\n\n\n",

This is reflected in\nmany passages.</p>\n<p>One is Nidda 44b</p>\n<p>\"MISHNA: A girl who is three years and one day old, whose father\narranged her betrothal, is betrothed through intercourse, as the\nhalakhic status of intercourse with her is that of intercourse in all\nhalakhic senses.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Niddah.44b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://sefaria.org/Niddah.44b.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en</a></p>\n<p>This same idea is reiterated in Sanhedrin 55b, which states:</p>\n<p>\"Rav Yosef says: Come and hear a resolution from a mishna (Nidda 44b):\nA girl who is three years and one day old whose father arranged her\nbetrothal is betrothed with intercourse, as the legal status of\nintercourse with her is that of full-fledged intercourse. And in a\ncase where the childless husband of a girl who is three years and one\nday old dies, if his brother, the yavam, engages in intercourse with\nher, he acquires her as his wife; and if she is married, a man other\nthan her husband is liable for engaging in intercourse with her due to\nthe prohibition of intercourse with a married woman.\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.55b.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.55b.4?lang=bi</a></p>\n<p>Today, many Jewish apologists claim that the Talmud does not really\nsay what it appears to say.</p>\n<p>However, the same teaching is explicitly affirmed in Josef Karo's\nShulchan Aruch - one of the two most authoritative texts on Jewish law\nand the interpretation of legal material in the Talmud.</p>\n<p>The relevant passage in Shulchan Aruch reads as follows:</p>\n<p>\"All the Laws Concerning Betrothal of a Minor</p>\n<p>\"The father may betroth his daughter without her consent, all the time\nshe is a minor. Likewise when she is a na’arah the father has control\nover her and the betrothal money belongs to him.</p>\n<p>\"Likewise he is entitled to her finds, to the production of her hands,\nand to her wedding contract. If she be widowed or divorced from the\nbetrothal, he is entitled to everything until she comes of age.\nTherefore the father accepts the betrothal money, etc. of his daughter\nfrom the day she is born until she comes of age. Even if she was a\ndeaf-mute or insane and the father betrothed her, behold she is a\nfully married woman.</p>\n<p><em><strong>If she were three years old and one day she may be betrothed by means of Bi’ah [i.e., sexual intercourse] with the consent of her\nfather.

Or are they a misrepresentation of the religion?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is held that Isaac married his wife Rebecca (Rivka) when she was 3 years old.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even if that is correct she wasn't a three year old the way we think of three year olds today. She was capable of going to a well to get water for her family and then giving water to ten camels so she must have had the physical and mental maturity of a modern teenager.   Secondly even assuming she was biologically  three years old at the time (there are other opinions in the medrash) that does not mean the marriage was consummated at the time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>MISHNA: A girl who is three years and one day old, whose father arranged her betrothal, is betrothed through intercourse,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is a legal technicality. See below</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If she were three years old and one day she may be betrothed by means of Bi’ah [i.e., sexual intercourse] with the consent of her father</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Again this is a legal technicality. It is entirely  conceivable that is specific (but of course  very limited) circumstances it would benefit a girl that her father as her legal guardian marry her off with this being the only way to do so. On a general level however that is not allowed.</p>\n<p>Whoever  misinformed you about this    gave you the location of the Mishna but did not give you the source  of where this is written in  Shulchan Aruch. For a simple reason. He did not want you to read a few lines further because you would see that it clearly says  (SA OH 37:8) you<br />\nמצוה שלא יקדש בתו כשהיא קטנה עד שתגדיל ותאמר בפלוני אני\nרוצה <em>It is a mitzvah that one should not betroth his daughter while she is a minor, rather until she has grown and says “I want(to marry) so and so\"</em> (The Gemara this is based on says it is forbidden) The Rema continues to discuss doing so and says it is done today (then) because of the   benefit the girl and risk to her if you wait until she is older. The Rambam Ishus 3:19 also  says similar to the Shulchan Aruch based on the same Gemara.</p>\n<p>This is discussing child marriage in general. Marriage   through intercourse is forbidden behavior  even for an <strong>adult</strong>. The Rambam Ishus 3:21 says\nאֵין מְקַדְּשִׁין בְּבִיאָה לְכַתְּחִלָּה וְאִם קִדֵּשׁ בְּבִיאָה מַכִּין אוֹתוֹ מַכַּת מַרְדּוּת<br />\n<em>If a man marries through intercourse , he is given lashes</em> This is based on explicit Gemaras</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why doesn't the Rambam disqualify Yushkuh as Moshiach because he's not descended from King David?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>The Rambam writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>4 If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently\ncontemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the\nWritten Law and the Oral Law as David, his ancestor, will compel all\nof Israel to walk in (the way of the Torah) and rectify the breaches\nin its observance, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance,\nconsider him Mashiach.</p>\n<p>If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and\ngathers the dispersed of Israel, he is definitely the Mashiach.</p>\n<p>He will then improve the entire world, motivating all the nations to\nserve God together, as Tzephaniah 3:9 states: \"I will transform the\npeoples to a purer language that they all will call upon the name of\nGod and serve Him with one purpose.\"</p>\n<p>If he did not succeed to this degree or was killed, he surely is not\nthe redeemer promised by the Torah. Rather, he should be considered as\nall the other proper and complete kings of the Davidic dynasty who\ndied. God caused him to arise only to test the many, as Daniel 11:35\nstates: \"And some of the wise men will stumble, to try them, to\nrefine, and to clarify until the appointed time, because the set time\nis in the future.\"</p>\n<p>Jesus of Nazareth who aspired to be the Mashiach and was executed by\nthe court was also alluded to in Daniel's prophecies, as ibid. 11:14\nstates: \"The vulgar among your people shall exalt themselves in an\nattempt to fulfill the vision, but they shall stumble.\"</p>\n<p>Can there be a greater stumbling block than Christianity? All the\nprophets spoke of Mashiach as the redeemer of Israel and their savior\nwho would gather their dispersed and strengthen their observance of\nthe mitzvot. In contrast, Christianity caused the Jews to be slain by\nthe sword, their remnants to be scattered and humbled, the Torah to be\naltered, and the majority of the world to err and serve a god other\nthan the Lord.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the intent of the Creator of the world is not within the\npower of man to comprehend, for His ways are not our ways, nor are His\nthoughts, our thoughts. Ultimately, all the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth\nand that Ishmaelite who arose after him will only serve to prepare the\nway for Mashiach's coming and the improvement of the entire world,\nmotivating the nations to serve God together as Tzephaniah 3:9 states:\n\"I will transform the peoples to a purer language that they all will\ncall upon the name of God and serve Him with one purpose.\"</p>\n<p>How will this come about? The entire world has already become filled\nwith the mention of Mashiach, Torah, and mitzvot. These matters have\nbeen spread to the furthermost islands to many stubborn-hearted\nnations. They discuss these matters and the mitzvot of the Torah,\nsaying: \"These mitzvot were true, but were already negated in the\npresent age and are not applicable for all time.\"</p>\n<p>Others say: \"Implied in the mitzvot are hidden concepts that can not\nbe understood simply. The Mashiach has already come and revealed those\nhidden truths.\"</p>\n<p>When the true Messianic king will arise and prove successful, his\nposition becoming exalted and uplifted, they will all return and\nrealize that their ancestors endowed them with a false heritage and\ntheir prophets and ancestors caused them to err.</p>\n<p>ד וְאִם יַעֲמֹד מֶלֶךְ מִבֵּית דָּוִד הוֹגֶה בַּתּוֹרָה וְעוֹסֵק\nבְּמִצְוֹת כְּדָוִד אָבִיו. כְּפִי תּוֹרָה שֶׁבִּכְתָב וְשֶׁבְּעַל\nפֶּה. וְיָכֹף כָּל יִשְׂרָאֵל לֵילֵךְ בָּהּ וּלְחַזֵּק בִּדְקָהּ.\nוְיִלָּחֵם מִלְחֲמוֹת ה'. הֲרֵי זֶה בְּחֶזְקַת שֶׁהוּא מָשִׁיחַ.

However, this is conditional on the voice being\ngenuinely that of Yaakov . If, Heaven forbid, there are corrupt thoughts\nand ideas within, it can lead to destruction and ruin, G-d forbid,\ngiving strength to the hands of Esav .</p>\n<p>This is like when erroneous and heretical ideas are mixed into the\nTorah, distorting its true meaning. Our sages have said that the hands\nof Esau only prevail when Israel's voice is compromised. In the\ncontext of idol worship, <strong>they said that the markets of Jerusalem were\ndestroyed three years before the city itself because the people\njustified their evil actions with Torah law. This caused the hands of\nEsav to prevail, leading to destruction.</strong> (emphasis mine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Satmar Rav says that the markets of Jerusalem were destroyed three years prior to the destruction of the Beis HaMikdash and the rest of the city itself. Why? Because (some) the people justified their evil actions with Torah Law.</p>\n<p>This seems problematic, since there is a clear Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.30b.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia (30b)</a>, that says that Jerusalem was destroyed because:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>they established their rulings on the basis of Torah law and did not go beyond the letter of the law</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Do our sages really tell us that the markets were destroyed three years prior, due to the justification of evil deeds with Torah Law? If so, how does that fit in with what the Gemara tells us?</p>\n<p>Side note, the Rebbe quotes from \"שפי' בנוע\"מ [פ' מטות]\", does anyone know what and where this is?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שפי' בנוע\"מ [פ' מטות] אמרם ז\"ל מפני מה חרבו חניות של ב\"ה ג' שנים קודם ירושלים, מפני שהעמידו דבריהם על דין תורה, ופירש הוא ז\"ל שכל מעשיהם הרעים שעשו העמידו אותם על דין תורה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Edit edit: this idea is also brought down by the Satmar Rav in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21134&st=&pgnum=17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei Yoel, Parshas Shemos, p. 16 (second right paragraph)</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lNYnOp9F.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lNYnOp9F.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The relevant piece of Talmud is from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Metzia.88a.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metzia 88a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מִפְּנֵי מָה חָרְבוּ חֲנוּיוֹת שֶׁל בֵּית הִינוֹ שָׁלֹשׁ שָׁנִים קוֹדֶם יְרוּשָׁלַיִם – מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהֶעֱמִידוּ דִּבְרֵיהֶם עַל דִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה.</p>\n<p>For what reason were the shops of Beit Hino, a town near Jerusalem, destroyed three years before the destruction of Jerusalem itself? It was because they based their practices strictly on matters of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The interpretation of this piece of Talmud that the Satmar Rav is referring to comes from <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=19758&st=&pgnum=296\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Noam Megadim</a> by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%96%D7%A8_%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%91%D7%99%D7%A5_%D7%9E%D7%98%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">R. Eliezer Horowitz of Tarnogrod</a>, in one his pieces for Parashat Matot:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וביאור הדבר נראה כי לכל חטא אשר יחטא האדם ואשם תגדל אשמתו יותר ויותר אם אינו מכיר ומודה על כל פנים שחטא רק אומר שכך נאה ויפה לו ושורת הדין הוא כך ומראה פני היתר לעצמו ... לא כן המלך שאול שאמר לשמואל הנביא הקימותי את דבר ה' כו' לזבוח כו' ... וזהו ארז\"ל שעהמידו דבריהן על ד\"ת כל דברים שעשו אמרו שזהו דת ודין תורה</p>\n<p>The explanation of the matter [of Bava Metzia 88a] is as follows: For any sin that a person commits, his guilt is greatly increased if he does not admit that at the very least he has sinned. Instead, he says that this is correct and appropriate behavior, and that the letter of the law is as he has acted, and he decides that he was permitted to act leniently...</p>\n<p>[For example,] King Saul did not act in this way [and admit to his guilt. Rather, after disobeying the command to destroy all the animals of Amalek,] he said to Samuel the Prophet, \"I have fulfilled the word of G-d\" etc. (Samuel I:15:13) \"In order to offer sacrifices\" etc. (Samuel I:15:21)...</p>\n<p>This is what our rabbis of blessed memory meant when they said that \"they based their practices on the law\". Whatever they did, they said that it accorded with the custom and law of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><sup>I haven't learned your sources inside, but from the eloquent way you've explained the question, I can take an educated guess at what the Rebbe means, if I may:</sup></p>\n<p>Ramban <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.2?vhe=On_Your_Way_New&lang=bi&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">brings</a> a concept called <code>נבל ברשות התורה</code>, literally \"<em>a scoundrel under the permission of the Torah</em>\". He explains that <strong>if people refuse to go beyond the letter of the law, and in their hearts they are intent on doing evil, they can accomplish a lot of evil simply by sticking to the rigid letter of the law.</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Modern day protests can be considered a good analogy. They want to\ncause as much chaos as possible, without breaking any laws, and as\nwe've seen, they can certainly do a lot in this regard.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is the same with the Torah. The laws of the Torah are aimed at human beings, who are fallible. A person has a right to sue in Beit Din for an insult to his honour (See Bava Kama 8:1, <em>boshesh</em>; Bava Metzia 4:10, <em>ona'at devarim</em>, etc.). We all know that being obsessed with one's honour is sinful, however, the Torah makes room in its laws for our flaws like this, in the obligations it sets on us, effectively saying</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"don't expect everyone to be a <em>mentsch</em> in the way you treat them,\nyou are legally bound to treat them as a human\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, therefore a <em>ba'al ga'ava</em> could certainly use the Torah's obligations on others to prop up his own haughiness, and sue everyone who assaults his honour, without going outside the letter of the law. Yet, he doesn't fool anyone, he is still immersed in sin, and a sinful life.</p>\n<p><strong>To be a true <em>mentsch</em>, we all need to go beyond the letter of the law. Ok, someone shamed us, but we don't have to sue them. As the Ramban says, the Torah will only make you a good person if you want it to.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Babylonian pronunciation for Talmud Bavli?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Did certain traits of the Babylonian Masoretic pronunciation, also apply to the aramaic of the Talmud Bavli?</p>\n<p>For example, in almost every place we have Patach (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Open_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a</a>) or Segol (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel.ogg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">e</a>), Babylonian Masoretic tradition has a single vowel whose quality was somewhere between them (<a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-open_front_unrounded_vowel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">æ</a>). Would the <em>Amōrā’īm</em> have pronounced Aramaic this way—where we have Segol or Patach, they would have pronounced an intermediate vowel?</p>\n<p>Does this also apply to other aspects of the Babylonian pronunciation of Tanakh (e.g. some words with an initial consonant cluster, ר being an “Italian” trill, etc.)?</p>\n<p><em>Edit: My focus is on the first and last paragraphs. If the answer would be “yes” in most cases except regarding the pronunciation of ו, please say so.

One example is Syriac, and here it is with a waw</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/lOD1JC5JLDw?si=CT2xfaLzS7v5ZVvv\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/lOD1JC5JLDw?si=CT2xfaLzS7v5ZVvv</a></p>\n<p>This doesn't prove what the Bavli sounded like. But Waw in Semitic languages seems to be a letter that's part consonant and part vowel, same as yod. Aramaic, Arabic, and other semitic languages usually spoke it as Waw, as making it a Vav shifts it more to being a consonant than a vowel. Most Iraqi Jews I've met also pronounce it as Waw for their Hebrew. Iraqis even have their own Aleph bet song that they teach to their kids and sing for Simhat Torah. The song is called Aleph Bet Gimmel Dalet Heh Waw: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rBDx1TeniU\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rBDx1TeniU</a></p>\n\n\n",

It’s an eye opener because now we have to read the possuk all over again. This time we read it the way the Sages read it: בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם אֵין מֶלֶךְ בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל – In those days the Jewish people did not need a king. They wouldn’t stand for a king who would force them to do certain things because they didn’t require it! אִישׁ כָּל הַיָּשָׁר בְּעֵינָיו יַעֲשֶׂה – Every man was loyal to the real King, Hashem, and everyone did what he considered right!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I’ve heard the statement that a court that executed someone in 70 years is considered a bloody court.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Unless there were a tremendous amount of murderers and other transgressors  it has to have been    true that the Court in the time of the Temple rarely executed anyone. The amount of technicalities required  to give  someone the death penalty made it extremely difficult for anyone to receive it. And at the time there were a lot of murderers they stopped judging capital cases. The Gemara says in more than one place (eg Shabbos 15A) that forty years before the destruction of the second beis hamakdush they stopped judging capital cases (because there were too common).</p>\n<p>However the oft quoted  statement  that a court that executed someone in 70 years is considered a bloody (actually damaging) court is actually only a partial quote of what the Mishna says and one opinion. The Mishna Makkos  1:10 says as following:\nסַנְהֶדְרִין הַהוֹרֶגֶת אֶחָד בְּשָׁבוּעַ נִקְרֵאת חָבְלָנִית. רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר בֶּן עֲזַרְיָה אוֹמֵר, אֶחָד לְשִׁבְעִים שָׁנָה. רַבִּי טַרְפוֹן וְרַבִּי עֲקִיבָא אוֹמְרִים, אִלּוּ הָיִינוּ בַסַּנְהֶדְרִין לֹא נֶהֱרַג אָדָם מֵעוֹלָם.\nרַבָּן שִׁמְעוֹן בֶּן גַּמְלִיאֵל אוֹמֵר, אַף הֵן מַרְבִּין שׁוֹפְכֵי דָמִים בְּיִשְׂרָאֵל</p>\n<p><em>A Sanhedrin that executes a transgressor once in <strong>seven years</strong> is characterized as a destructive tribunal. Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya says: Once in seventy years. Rabbi Tarfon and Rabbi Akiva say: If we had been members of the Sanhedrin, (we would have conducted trials in a manner that) no person would have ever been executed. Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel says: In adopting that approach, they too would increase the number of murderers among the Jewish people.</em></p>\n<p>The Rambam seems to pasken that  the opinion which says seven , not seventy, years is the one we follow. The Rambam Sanhedrin 14:10 says :\nצְרִיכִין בֵּית דִּין לְהִתְיַשֵּׁב בְּדִינֵי נְפָשׁוֹת וּלְהַמְתִּין וְלֹא יָאִיצוּ. וְכָל בֵּית דִּין שֶׁהָרְגוּ נֶפֶשׁ בְּשֶׁבַע שָׁנִים הֲרֵי אֵלּוּ חַבְּלָנִין. אַף עַל פִּי כֵן אִם אֵרַע לָהֶם לַהֲרֹג בְּכָל יוֹם וְיוֹם הוֹרְגִין.</p>\n<p><em>The court must be very patient with regard to laws involving capital punishment and ponder the matter without being hasty. Whenever a court executes a person once in <strong>seven years</strong>, it is considered a destructive tribunal. Nevertheless, if it happens that they must execute a person every day, they do.</em></p>\n\n\n",

Thus, when the minyan reaches Shema, you should slow down a bit and use the congregation's tune.</p>\n<p>B) The Shulchan Aruch was referring to reading Shema with the te'amim (cantillation tunes). During prayer, it is preferable to read quotes from the Tanakh using the appropriate te'amim.

On the other hand, if they're referring to reading the Zohar without understanding what you're reading, there are definitely sources for that. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Degel_Machaneh_Ephraim,_Addenda.51\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Degel Machane Efraim</a>, for example, says as follows in the Likkutim:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לשון הזוה\"ק הוא מסוגל לנשמה אף שאינו מבין כלל מה שאומר\nכמשל הנכנס לחנות של בושם אע\"פ שלא לקח כלום מ\"מ ריח טוב קלט עמו\nכך הוא ממש בההולך למקום והיכל שהצדיק בו א\"א שלא יקלט איזה ריח\nטוב מריחא דצדיק אף שאינו מבין כלל מאמירת הצדיק</p>\n<p>The language of the Zohar is beneficial for the soul even if you don't understand at all what it's saying. As a mashal, one who walks to a market that is selling perfume even if he didn't get anything he'll still imbibe the scent; so it is precisely with someone who goes to a place or a hall where the Tzaddik is, it's impossible for him not to imbibe some of the scent of the Tzaddik, even though he doesn't understand at all what the Tzaddik is saying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(Parenthetically, and to drive the point home even stronger, רוח/נשימה is directly identified in the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan.8.2.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Moharan Torah 8</a> as the Torah of the Tzaddik.)</p>\n<p>I know of a source from the Chida as well, I'll have to add that another time.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Generally, the Jewish way is to pray audibly and to learn texts audibly.

To become tamai, it must first become “muchsher L’kabel tumah.” This means water or other specific liquids have come in contact with the challah. If none of these specified liquids are used, the challah can never become tamai and therefore can not be burned and a bracha is not recited.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why must challah be tamai when it is burned?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 7)\n\n<p>Contrary to popular belief, challah isn't supposed to be burned. It is food for the priests (kohanim) and their families to eat. Eating it is a mitzva with a special blessing (YD 322:5). It's such a holy mitzva that both the priest and the challah must be pure (Leviticus 22:4). Desecrating pure challah is also not allowed (Rambam Terumot 12:1). If the priest becomes impure he can purify himself, but if the challah accidentally becomes impure there's no solution so unfortunately it must be burned not unlike other invalid sacrifices.</p>\n<p>Nowadays when virtually all priests <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/25720/759\">can't fully purify themselves</a>, the challah won't generally be eaten anyway. If it were pure you'd have to just let it sit there till it rots away or accidentally becomes impure, so it's very convenient to render the whole dough impure before declaring a piece holy. That way you can go ahead and burn it and be done with it. But that's just a temporary life-hack until the priests can get back to eating it.</p>\n\n\n",

Did he apply it on Yom Tov too?</p>\n<p>Is it necessary to assume that the whole gezeira was introduced after halacha was decided like Beit Hillel?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Bet Shammai’s view in Mishnah Beitzah 1:5 is <strong>not</strong> that carrying in reshut harabbim (public domain) is prohibited on Yom Tov but that it is permitted only where the person carries in connection with eating.  Carrying a lulav is not done for eating and therefore it is prohibited.  The view of Bet Hillel is that since carrying is permitted for food, it is also permitted in other cases.</p>\n<p>Mishnah Succah 4:2 refers to a different issue: not taking the lulav on Shabbat unless it is the first day of Succot, when taking arbah minim is a biblical obligation. Since Succah 4:2 envisages carrying a lulav on Yom Tov and based on Beitzah 1:5 Bet Shammai does not permit carrying a lulav in reshut harabbim on Yom Tov, Succah 4:2 must be according to the view of Bet Hillel since according to Bet Shammai's view, the issue would not arise.</p>\n<p>Bet Shammai does not permit the carrying of a lulav in reshut harabim, as @Double AA points out in his comment, so the logical extension of Bet Shammai’s view as applied to Succah 4:2 would be to prohibit taking the lulav on Yom Tov lest one carries it. Accordingly it appears that the OP is correct and it would seem that the gezeira was introduced after carrying on Yom Tov was permitted in accordance with the view of Beit Hillel</p>\n<p>For the sake of completeness, I should add that we no longer take the arbah minim on Shabbat, even on the first day of Succot – see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/113485/why-ban-lulav-on-shabbos-in-places-with-eruvin\">Why ban Lulav on Shabbos in places with eruvin?</a> and the article cited in that post <a href=\"https://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2009/10/not-shaking-lulav-on-shabbat.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://lifeinisrael.blogspot.com/2009/10/not-shaking-lulav-on-shabbat.html</a></p>\n\n\n",

I realised this in the middle of shemoneh esrei.</p>\n<p>I learnt that we normally say you don't go back since normally there is no reason why you should have kavono the second time if you didn't the first.</p>\n<p>Does the knowledge that I have a prop which would almost certainly guarantee my kavona I obligate me to go back to the beginning of the shemoneh Esrei?</p>\n<p>If I am on my way to shul am and haven't got this siddur with me am I obligated to go home and get it even if it makes me 5 minutes late for shul?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p>The Ramah in Shulchan Aruch (referenced below) says one <em>cannot</em> go back to repeat the blessings of Avos that one didn't have kavana for. There's no distinction of the individual person is confident that he will have kavana a second time</p>\n<p>(Even without a special siddur if one realized one didn't have kavana and now wants to go back, it stands to reason that he would try to have kavana the second time, but we still do not allow him to do so)</p>\n<p>There are other ways to \"make up\" for the lost kavana without repeating the brochos, as <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/halacha-yomis/middle-shmoneh-esrei-one-realizes-not-kavana-avos-way-can-still-fulfill-obligation-kavana-tefilla/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article</a> details:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If in the middle of Shmoneh Esrei one realizes that he did not have\nkavana during Avos, is there any way that he can still fulfill his\nobligation of having kavana in tefilla?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Beiur Halacha (OC 101 s.v.\nveha’idna) suggests that in this case one should silently wait and\nlisten to the Shliach Tzibur’s repetition of Shmoneh Esrei until the\nplace he reached in Shmoneh Esrei and then recite the rest on his own.\nAlthough the Shliach Tzibur in our time cannot recite Shmoneh Esrei\nfor someone who is able to daven on his own, in this situation the\nShliach Tzibur can be motzi him with the tefilla. The reason for this\nis as follows: The Rama (OC 101:1), in the name of the Tur, rules that\nwe do not allow a person who has not concentrated in Avos to repeat\nthis bracha. Thus, this person now has the status of someone who\ncannot daven on his own, and therefore the Shliach Tzibur can be motzi\nhim. According to Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, zt”l this psak of the\nBeiur Halacha has not been accepted as normative halacha (Halichos\nShlomo, p. 100 in Dvar Halacha 12).</p>\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman Auerbach, zt”l (Halichos Shlomo 8:9, pp. 99-100)\nquotes another solution in the name of the Chazon Ish. One should\nreturn to the place in Shmoneh Esrei where his mind wandered and now\nwith concentration recite in his mind only until the place he is up to\nin Shmoneh Esrei. According to the Chazon Ish, “his kavana will now\njoin with his previous words,” and this is not considered to be\ndavening without words (ibid., p. 100 Dvar Halacha 12).</p>\n<p>Rav Shlomo Zalman continues and states that he “should also try very\nhard to concentrate well in Modim because it is proper to do whatever\nhe can to correct the situation.” The Dvar Halacha (ibid. 13) explains\nthat although the opinion of the Rokeach that if one concentrated only\nin Modim one is yotzei, is not quoted in Shulchan Aruch as normative\nhalacha, in this situation we should follow his practice. Since we do\nnot have the option of repeating Shmoneh Esrei when kavana was lacking\nin Avos, we should at least fulfill tefilla b’dieved according to the\nRokeach. This together with the Chazon Ish’s solution mentioned above\nis the best way to salvage our tefilla.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But not always.</p>\n<p>Please read on.</p>\n<h1>Details</h1>\n<p>One can find sources which argue both ways. Here's an answer from my own experience.</p>\n<p>In my yeshivish upbringing, I was shown the sources and logic that one should definitely not read such books. There are many risks. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One might fall for a false idea.</li>\n<li>One might absorb the cynicism towards Torah inherent in the book.</li>\n<li>Being exposed to forbidden material, or at least highly inappropriate material, for a Ben Torah.</li>\n<li>Being exposed to temptations.</li>\n<li>Protecting the innocence and holiness of one's home and children.</li>\n<li>Protecting the integrity of the authentic Torah tradition (<em>mesorah</em>).</li>\n<li>Et cetera.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I haven't changed my mind on any of these things.</p>\n<p>I've also seen another approach, in this case Chabad. (But see also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/25772/31534\">this very related question</a> for other approaches.) Consider Chabad's philosophy nowadays, doing their various <em>shluchot</em> and <em>mivzoiyim</em>. Therefore, they try to teach resilience, for their inevitable dealings with the outside world. They correctly point out: Although all of the above risks are real, the Torah is meant to refine us. And so, we must refine ourselves, so that we can handle and even elevate the outside world. Therefore, we must build our ability to not just distinguish, but <em>recognise</em>, the difference between good and bad, <em>b'daat</em>.</p>\n<p>I, too, have come to agree that this is necessary. It takes a religious dedication to good over bad, and true over false. It also takes constant improvement in our ability to recognise the difference.</p>\n<p>I don't think that any authority which argues either way on your question would dispute any of the above. The conundrum boils down to: How can we know if we are good enough?</p>\n<p>There's nothing wrong with saying we will never be \"good enough\". We can seek advice from our own mentors, loved ones, and friends, in the context of our own situation and mission in life. They can advise us on whether or not to read these books <em>l'chatchila</em>. It's very probable that the answer strongly leans towards No, unless there is a very pressing concern. However, we shouldn't also say that, because we will never be good enough, we shouldn't even try. We should always <em>aspire</em> to be the kind of person who can read any book and remain holy. Just in case it is ever needed of us, due to some pressing concern.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Definitely not advisable. They are most likely to contain ideas antithetical to Torah. Better to use your time studying Torah, instead of studying interpretations twisted to go against the Torah.</p>\n<p>This addresses the person who writes such things. Someone who interprets the Torah in a way that's against Jewish law has no share in the world to come. (Source: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot</a> 3:11.)</p>\n<p>This addresses what may happen to someone who believes the wrongful teachings. Avtalyon said: Sages, be careful with your words. For you may be penalized with exile, and be banished to a place of evil waters. The disciples who follow you there will drink and die; consequently, the name of heaven will be desecrated.

Or was there a daf yomi movement in the geographical area of the Aruch Hashulchan?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It seems fairly clear that, as the OP points out that the <em>Aruch HaShulchan</em> reports, there were some (perhaps many) who learned a <em>daf</em> of <em>gemara</em> each day. This was sometimes in <em>Chevras Shas</em> (Talmud study groups).</p>\n<p>This article <a href=\"https://www.ou.org/who-originated-the-idea-of-the-daf-yomi-learning-schedule/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.ou.org/who-originated-the-idea-of-the-daf-yomi-learning-schedule/</a> clearly points out that many people put forward the idea of daf yomi before Rabbi Meir Shapiro.</p>\n<p>The article’s conclusion is:</p>\n<p>\"<em>There are also (at least) four sources reporting daf yomi suggestions at earlier dates than those given above. They are: the Rebbe of Ger; Rabbi Ya’akov Lorbeerbaum of Lissa; Rabbi Akiva Eiger; the Jewish Community in Moravia</em>.</p>\n<p>\"<em>The last named appears in the ordinances of the Jewish community of the city from 5519 (<strong>1759</strong>), namely more than one hundred and fifty years before Rabbi Shapiro put forward his proposal to the Knessia Gedolah</em>.\"</p>\n<p>The major innovation of Rabbi Meir Shapiro when he proposed Daf Yomi in August 1923, at the First International Congress of Agudath Israel in Vienna was the establishment of a schedule which would be followed across multiple communities. Rabbi Shapiro’s idea was not just to promote the study of a daf of gemara each day but to unite the Jewish people across many countries in the common study of the same daf. This innovation moved the idea of a Chevra Shas up a notch. And introduced a worldwide element of international Jewish unity.</p>\n<p>The following paragraph from Rabbi Shapiro's speech in August 1923 which is widely quoted in almost every article about Daf Yomi makes that goal clear:</p>\n<p><em>What a great thing! A Jew travels by boat and takes gemara Berachot under his arm. He travels for 15 days from Eretz Yisrael to America, and each day he learns the daf. When he arrives in America, he enters a beis medrash in New York and finds Jews learning the very same daf that he studied on that day, and he gladly joins them</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Another Jew leaves the United States and travels to Brazil or Japan, and he first goes to the beis medrash, where he finds everyone learning the same daf that he himself learned that day. Could there be greater unity of hearts than this?</em></p>\n\n\n",

Several months prior to the establishment of Daf Yomi, the Frierdiker Rebbe said that Chassidim should learn an Amud a day. In addition, in the Hatomim journal, the Frierdiker Rebbe writes that the Alter Rebbe had instituted in his time the study of a Daf a day.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Rebbe was supportive of the Daf Yomi in Yerushalmi started by the Gerrer Rebbe – which is also fixed learning – yet the Rebbe never said that everyone should take it on. What the Rebbe was explaining in the sicha, as can be clearly understood by looking inside, was why Lubavitch didn’t embrace the takana and instate it as a widespread custom. This does not however mean that no one should learn it.</p>\n<p>I should mention that if you find an issue with learning in this format, learning it one day off wouldn’t help.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Regarding the quote from the Rebbe that since the Frierdiker Rebbe didn’t instruct bochurim to follow it shows “tachlis hashelila bazeh” – “clear rejection of it”:</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Although that line is written in one incomplete transcript, in all other hanachos it has it the other way around: that although the Frierdiker Rebbe didn’t reject it explicitly, he never instructed the bochurim to do it.</p>\n<p>Moreover, a careful examination of the Sichos shows that the Rebbeim didn’t oppose Daf Yomi at all. The Rebbe mentioned it on numerous occasions and even encouraged it in multiple letters (see the booklet below). The Frierdiker Rebbe himself demanded of some to learn Daf Yomi. Though this may not be a proof in support, it definitely makes it hard to say that the Rebbeim opposed it.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>The Sicha of the Rebbe must be understood in the context of the Farbrengen.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Rebbe wasn’t saying that Daf Yomi is wrong, but why Daf Yomi isn’t included in what the Rebbe had explained a week earlier, that when we see others doing something good, we must join in, just as Aharon was saddened that he hadn’t brought the opening korbanos like the Nesiim. Following the earlier Sicha, the Rebbe said, he had been asked: Why then don’t we join Daf Yomi which is also a good thing that others are doing?</p>\n<p>The Rebbe, therefore, explained that Aharon was only sad when he saw that all of the Nesiim brought the korbanos. But if only some people are doing something good, it’s not necessarily something that I must do. Similarly, said the Rebbe, Daf Yomi was not adopted by all of Klal Yisroel at the time, for various reasons, rather it was something that certain communities took upon themselves.</p>\n<p>Meaning the Rebbe never said not to learn it, but rather why it’s not something Chabad accepted as an official takana for everyone to do.</p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>In the Sicha of the Frierdiker Rebbe, he derides those who think that due to their study of Daf Yomi millions of malochim rise for them and are building for him a new Gan Eden, while in the past a simple farmer knew that before going to work, he must learn a Daf Gemara.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This clearly indicated that Daf Yomi itself isn’t the issue, but rather it’s the mindset of the person that is an issue, and it can result from other areas of learning and practice as well. In fact, the opposite is implied – that everyone should be learning a Daf of Gemara every day (albeit perhaps not specifically in the widespread cycle).</p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>There is no mention anywhere about any instruction not to learn Daf Yomi due to its association with Agudas Yisroel, though seeing the Frierdiker Rebbe’s opposition to it I can understand if for that reason someone feels more comfortable learning a day off or a different cycle. It should be noted that the Rebbe mentioned that the founder of Daf Yomi, R. Meir Shapiro, was a Chossid, and that it is interesting that the misnagdim nonetheless embraced it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>My goal is not to encourage people to learn Daf Yomi specifically, and everyone can decide what works for them. Of course, we should learn Gemara since it’s Hashem’s Torah and not merely to “finish Shas”, and of course also it should not take away from learning Rambam and Chassidus daily. But if for learning Gemara one finds it helpful to follow a set cycle, it seems clear that there is no objection to following this program. What’s certain is that someone who doesn’t have a daily Kvius for Gemara shouldn’t be running around screaming at people who learn Daf Yomi.</p>\n<p>My sentiments are not to be taken as objectives truth. Those with dissenting opinions and proofs should please share them by emailing inbox@Anash.org.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I heard that the rabbis who started daf yomi didn't consult the 6th Rebbe before doing so, and therefore Chabad doesn't officially learn daf yomi.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Not being consulted about it beforehand is a pretty odd reason not to officially learn daf yomi. By that logic most groups wouldn't or shouldn't.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I heard from  elderly Chabad Chasidim who actually knew the 6th Rebbe that  he specifically avoided voicing his opinion publicly. On the one hand he did not want   to advocate it because he felt that the mass learning of Daf Yomi would replace the type of learning that had been the common approach for hundreds of years in Eastern Europe. There were different groups for people of different abilities and inclination. There was a chevra shas, a chevra mishnoyis, a chevra ein yaakov, a chevra halacha etc. He was uncomfortable with the  promotion  of the mass learning of Daf Yomi which (would have) replace(d) those groups. On the flip side he did not oppose Daf Yomi or have intrinsic  opposition to those who want to learn it doing so.(see below) He therefore did not want to say anything that would discourage it either. Because of his  conflicting considerations he avoided taking a public position at all.</p>\n<p>I was also told that  he himself apparently learned Daf Yomi. Although he never actually said that he did, people claimed to have noticed that the mesechta being learned by Daf Yomi was seen on his desk too often for it to have been a coincidence.</p>\n\n\n",

While in the days of the Messiah, Israel will\nbe independent and free from enslavement to foreign powers, the world\norder will remain otherwise unchanged, as it is stated: “For the poor\nshall not cease from the land” ( Deuteronomy 15:11), which indicates\nthat the ways of the world are set and unchanging.</p>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַבִּי חִיָּיא בַּר אַבָּא אָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן: כׇּל הַנְּבִיאִים כּוּלָּן לֹא נִתְנַבְּאוּ אֶלָּא לְבַעֲלֵי תְשׁוּבָה,\nאֲבָל צַדִּיקִים גְּמוּרִים ״עַיִן לֹא רָאָתָה אֱלֹהִים זוּלָתְךָ״.</p>\n<p>And Rabbi Ḥiyya bar Abba said that Rabbi Yoḥanan said: All of the prophets only prophesied their prophecies of consolation with regard\nto penitents but with regard to the full-fledged righteous it is\nstated: “No eye has seen it, God, aside from You.”</p>\n<p>וּפְלִיגָא דְּרַבִּי אֲבָהוּ, דְּאָמַר רַבִּי אֲבָהוּ: מָקוֹם שֶׁבַּעֲלֵי תְשׁוּבָה עוֹמְדִין — צַדִּיקִים גְּמוּרִים אֵינָם\nעוֹמְדִין, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״שָׁלוֹם שָׁלוֹם לָרָחוֹק וְלַקָּרוֹב״.\n״לָרָחוֹק״ בְּרֵישָׁא, וַהֲדַר ״לַקָּרוֹב״.</p>\n<p>And the Gemara notes that this statement disagrees with the opinion of Rabbi Abbahu...

Rachamim is the attribute/perfection in Hashem that feels compassionate towards His creations, which overcomes His anger towards them, which comes from Gevura - His attribute of judgement and justice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bamidbar.14.17.1-9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This Rabbeinu Bachaye</a> is a great resource in understanding this classic Torah concept, i.e. that Hashem is compassionate and therefore we can find a route out of His anger towards us - which should be eternal - and gain forgiveness and reconciliation through <em>Tefilla</em> and <em>Teshuva</em>.</p>\n<p>The piece brings the Midrash that when Moshe first met Hashem on Sinai, he found Him putting crowns on the letters. Eventually Hashem said to Moshe \"how come you didn't greet me when you saw me? Do people not do that where you come from?\", and Moshe said \"it is not permitted for a slave to greet his Master\". Hashem's response was shocking: \"I need you to help Me\".</p>\n<p>To do something as minor as failing to greet Hashem, the Supreme Master, King of Kings, Perfect, Eternal and Righteous, fitting of all conceivable praises and more... is a grave offense, not to mention the far more serious sins discussed in Yirmiyahu. Therefore it is only fitting that His response to such an offense is anger that is as infinite and eternal as Him.</p>\n<p>Yet, He doesn't want to be angry at us forever. He started this project, and He wants us. Therefore, He teaches Moshe what is the proper way to be in a relationship with Him, and He teaches Moshe about His trait of Rachamim. The piece goes into a lot of detail on what Hashem taught Moshe, in the sense of \"When you make me angry, I need your help so that I won't be angry forever, so I am going to teach you about Myself, and what you need to do to evoke My Compassion for you at such times\".</p>\n<p>For example, with the sin of the spies, invoking His trait of נוצר חסד לאלפים, i.e. the way He remembers the <em>zechut</em> of our forefathers and forgives us on their behalf, would have been inappropriate because the sin specifically was contempt for the land that the forefathers held dear and stood for. All Moshe was able to do is invoke the very trait you are asking about - slow to anger. This means that instead of wiping us out, He spreads the punishment out over many generations, so each gets only a little, bearable amount.</p>\n<p>This conforms with our thesis because indeed, this is the trait Moshe invoked because the people had not done <em>Teshuva</em>. In such a case, Moshe can't really expect Hashem to not be angry forever - exactly as Yirmiyahu said! So he asked Hashem to spread out the anger, and also add some more merit due to His trait of רב חסד, as well as His trait of forgiving even rebellious sins, and of not punishing immediately but seeing up to the third or fourth generation if any of the kids or grandkids will to <em>Teshuva</em>. Otherwise, even Moshe admits that He is לא ינקה - He doesn't completely forgive those who do not do <em>Teshuva</em>.</p>\n<p>We can relate to this to some degree. There are some things that our most beloved and important people in our lives can do, that would upset us so much that we would find it impossible to get over it, unless they sincerely apologise and change. And indeed we see that when they do sincerely apologise and change, we find the strength to forgive them and get over it! We even learn to trust them completely again.</p>\n<p>We also <em>can't</em> relate to it, because Hashem's forgiveness is not like ours - when He forgives, He forgives completely as if it never happened, a trait He did not give over to mankind...</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: there's no contradiction at all. The very <em>pesukim</em> themselves imply that due to His Gevura, when Hashem is angry about certain things, He is angry <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/142714/31534\">עַד־עוֹלָם</a>, and <em>unless His Rachamim is invoked</em>, indeed His anger would last forever <em>ch'v</em>. The first pasuk is explaining what our invoking His Rachamim accomplishes (through <em>Tefilla</em> and/or <em>Teshuva</em>) vis-à-vis the second <em>pasuk</em>; His Gevura.</p>\n\n\n",

It would seem that there is an equal obligation to check any kind of egg for blood spots. And the reason for checking for blood, namely that the egg might be fertilized, applies equally to all bird eggs.</p>\n<p>However, there is one distinction: these days, most supermarket chicken eggs are laid by hens that were grown alone, with no rooster nearby. This means that no blood spots in eggs are the result of fertilization, and therefore the prohibition on eating the blood is not as strong (and if a blood spot is found after eggs are scrambled, for example, you'd be allowed to leave it). However, other birds that aren't commonly raised for eggs might not fall into this category, and therefore these leniencies wouldn't be permitted.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Interesting question!</p>\n<p>Want to be clear here: I’m not paskening anything, just stating the opinions and drawing logical sourced conclusions:</p>\n<p>The Rema in Y.D.

The reason one would not need to check for the blood in the times of the Rema or earlier is because as the Rema says we rely on a rov (majority) that most eggs don't have blood.</p>\n<p>Nowadays we don't need to check it because of what it says <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/41468/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here:</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"“the vast majority of eggs which are found in supermarkets today are the product of hormonal and artificial stimulation and not a result of the natural reproductive process of chickens. Manipulating chickens in this way can generate a new egg every single day, making the process extremely profitable. These mass produced eggs, often referred to as \"commercial eggs\" or \"battery eggs\", will never develop into chickens. As such, the \"blood spots\" found in these eggs are not truly blood. The only eggs which are produced by natural fertilization today are clearly marked as \"natural\" or \"organic\" on the package and are significantly more expensive. When one finds blood in naturally fertilized eggs, the blood is not kosher and the egg must be discarded.  The reason for this is due to the concern that the blood might actually be the early stages of an embryo.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, eggs that come from kosher birds like ducks, geese, turkey, etc would not have to be checked, 1) because most eggs don't have blood (the rov), since the Rema and other Achronim did not differentiate between chickens and other birds. 2) For the reason of most eggs being a product of \"commercial eggs\" or \"battery eggs,” one would not need to check the package if the eggs are \"commercial eggs\" or \"battery eggs,” and even if they are natural or organic eggs one can rely on the Rema that most eggs don't have blood (rov).</p>\n<p>Hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Can God Consider Himself to Be Wrong?",
    "content": "# Can God Consider Himself to Be Wrong?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Hebrew Bible has at least 2 places where God changes course or even regrets his actions. Does that mean God from the Biblical perspective can consider Himself to be wrong?</p>\n<p>I'm not asking from our human perspective whether God can be wrong, but is it possible from God's perspective that God can be wrong?</p>\n<p>I'm defining wrong as \"Someone looking back at their past action and deciding that if given the chance again they would have made a different decision.\" So for example I'm not asking whether from our perspective God was \"wrong\" to make Saul King. I'm asking whether God can look at that decision and decide for Himself whether He \"should\" have made someone else king instead of Saul.</p>\n<p>Note: The argument being made against my question is that because God can see the future, God can't be wrong. My response is if a man is born who sees the future, does that mean they can never be wrong?  Then the goalpost was moved to: God can see all potential futures and therefore God can't be wrong. Paul Atreides in Dune is given this power, to see all potential realities, and he chooses something called the Golden Path. Does that inherently lead to a fact that Paul can't ever consider himself wrong? It seems to me Paul could decide he was wrong, but I'm not sure anyone who doesn't have that level of omniscience could say Paul is wrong.</p>\n<p>My preference is answers that are more based on scripture. I'm open to all answers, but bringing me an answer that just rewrites or ignores the Bible for the sake of some non biblical dogma is not satisfying for an answer. For example saying God doesn't have emotions means ignoring/rewriting a large and consistent part of our Biblical tradition. Or just ignoring Abraham Abinu who implied that God can be wrong or at least act unjustly.</p>\n<p>כה  חָלִלָה לְּךָ מֵעֲשֹׂת כַּדָּבָר הַזֶּה, לְהָמִית צַדִּיק עִם-רָשָׁע, וְהָיָה כַצַּדִּיק, כָּרָשָׁע; חָלִלָה לָּךְ--הֲשֹׁפֵט כָּל-הָאָרֶץ, לֹא יַעֲשֶׂה מִשְׁפָּט.     25 That be far from Thee to do after this manner, to slay the righteous with the wicked, that so the righteous should be as the wicked; that be far from Thee; shall not the Judge of all the earth do justly?'</p>\n<p>In other words, Abraham is implying that if God wipes away the wicked with the just in the city, like God seemed to be saying he was going to do, Abraham implies this would make Gods actions unjust.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Bible has at least 2 places where God changes course or even\nregrets his actions.

In the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/27715/34824\">talmud</a>, which is also accepted the same way as the written Torah is, it says that He regretted 4 things:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ארבעה מתחרט עליהן הקדוש ברוך הוא שבראם ואלו הם: גלות, כשדים, וישמעאלים\nויצר הרע - There are four that the Holy One, Blessed is He, regrets\nhaving created.

Isn't that \"wrong\"?</p>\n<p>But no. There's different ways Hashem relates to the world. Relative to the Awtsmoos, or even higher revelations of the Ohr Ein Sof, everything that has is and will happen, even things people do, is already planned out from the beginning. There is no wrong, everything is exactly as it should be</p>\n<p>Before getting into more sources for that, an obvious reference is when the angels asked Hashem why He was causing Rabbi Akiva to suffer, to which Hashem told them to be quite, lest He bring the world back to chaos as it was in the beginning.</p>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/2017/moadim/rwil_rh.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explained</a> that in order for Hashem to explain why that was happening, He would have to \"unravel\" the entire universe back to it's origins to show us why it should happen. Without all of that context, it's impossible to know.</p>\n<p>Anyways, all the times we see Hashem regretting something, that's only referring to lower levels of how Hashem limits Himself into the system of the world in some way. But I'm Essence, everything is planned out by Him, including right and wrong itself, and He regrets nothing.</p>\n<p>Since you asked specifically about how Hashem \"regretted\" appointing Shaul, <a href=\"https://dach.dev/meluket/view/2_%D7%9E%D7%94#par=5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it's explained</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ג) והנה הטעם על זה שההעלם וההסתר דהגלות (כולל גם ההעלם וההסתר דדרא\nדעקבתא דמשיחא) הוא רק על כחות הפנימיים דהנשמה ולא על מדת הנצח, מבאר\nבהמאמר35, שזהו לפי ששרש הנצח36 הוא בעצם הנפש, דכמו\"כ הוא למעלה, ששרש\nהנצח הוא בפנימיות הכתר, ובפנימיות הכתר לא שייך ענין השינוי.\nוכמ\"ש37 וגם נצח ישראל לא ישקר ולא ינחם כי לא אדם הוא להנחם, דענין\nהנחמה והשינוי שייך רק בבחינת אדם, השתלשלות, ומכיון ששרש הנצח הוא\nבבחינת לא אדם, למעלה מהשתלשלות, לכן אין שייך בו שינוי, וישנו בגילוי גם\nבזמן הגלות. ולא עוד, אלא שבזמן הגלות, ובפרט בעקבתא דמשיחא, כח הנצחון\nוהמס\"נ הוא בגילוי יותר מבזמן הבית38.</p>\n<p>The reason for the concealment and hiding in the time of exile\n(including the concealment and hiding during the generation of the\nfootsteps of the Messiah) affecting only the inner faculties of the\nsoul and not the attribute of Netzach (eternity/victory) is explained\nin the discourse. It is stated that the root of Netzach is in the\nessence of the soul. Similarly, above, the root of Netzach is in the\ninnermost part of Keter (the crown), and within the innermost part of\nKeter, the concept of change does not apply. As it is written, \"The\nEternity of Israel will not lie nor repent, for He is not a man to\nrepent.\" The concepts of repentance and change apply only within the\nrealm of \"man,\" i.e., within the chain of creation (hishtalshelut).\nSince the root of Netzach is in the realm of \"not man,\" beyond\nhishtalshelut, it is not subject to change and remains revealed even\nduring exile. Moreover, during the time of exile, and especially in\nthe generation of the footsteps of the Messiah, the power of victory\nand self-sacrifice is more revealed than during the time of the\nTemple.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the idea of \"regret\", for example when appointing Shaul, is only in \"lower\" levels of Seder Histalshilus; but in the \"inner dimension of the crown\", which is the root of long David's kingdom, there's no concept of change.</p>\n<p>I also assume you're referring to how Hashem \"regretted\" making man, even though you don't say so explicitly.</p>\n<p>It's a similar idea, Hashem in Essence knows what He's doing, but in the context of the limitations and revelations there's differences, which can be changed based on the sacrifices that Noach offered afterwards, specifically through the sacrifices that He offered did Hashem say that He will no longer destroy man, even though the same reason given (for man is bad from His youth) was the <strong>same</strong> reason He used to destroy them in the first place.. the difference of the change of opinion (within Seder Histalshilus) is the sacrifices, because the sacrifices \"ascend to the Ein Sof\", implying that in the Ein Sof itself there was never any question or regret.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://chabadlibrary.org/books/3601330619\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reasons</a> why the sacrifices caused Him to \"change\" His mind:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בס\"ד. ש\"פ נח, תרד\"ע וירח ה' את ריח הניחוח ויאמר לא אוסיף עוד לקלל כו',\nואי' במד\"ר הריח ריח של אברהם אבינו עולה מכבשן האש, הריח ריח של חנני'\nמישאל ועזרי' עולה מכבשן האש כו'. וצ\"ל מהו\"ע שהריח ריח של אברהם אבינו\nוחמו\"ע ועי\"ז דוקא א' לא אוסיף עוד כו', והלא ע\"פ פשוט ריח הניחוח הוא\nריח הקרבנות שהקריב נח שזה ג\"כ ענין גבוה ונעלה דרזא דקורבנא עולה עד רזא\nדא\"ס כו', מה מוסיף ומחדש זה שהריח ריח של א\"א ע\"ה כו'. ולהבין זה ילה\"ק\nמשנת\"ל ההפרש בין הקרבנות לקטרת דקרבנות הן בחי' לחם וכמ\"ש את קרבני לחמי\nלאשי וכמו הלחם שממשיך חיות הנפש ומחברו עם הגוף שמתחזקים כחותיו עי\"ז\nוכמא' עד דלא אכילנא כו' לא צלינא כו', ומ\"מ אין בזה התחדשות החיות כו',\nכמו\"כ הקרבנות ממשיכים מבחי' אוא\"ס דכי לא אדם הוא להתלבש בבחי' ציור\nאדה\"ע כו', מ\"מ ההמשכה היא רק הארה לבד שבאה בבחי' צמצום באדה\"ע כו',\nוהיא המשכת הארה השייכה להשתל' כו', אבל הקטרת הוא בחי' ריח שמשיב את\nהנפש שממשיך מעצם חבור הנשמה עם הגוף ונמשך אור וחיות חדש כו', וכמו\"כ\nענן הקטרת הוא שממשיך בחי' אוא\"ס דכי לא אדם הוא שיאיר בגילוי ממש בבחי'\nאדה\"ע כו'. רטז) והנה עדיין צ\"ל משנת\"ל פרי\"ג דקרבנות נק' לחם שזהו המשכת\nאו\"פ לבד וקטרת הוא בחי' ריח שממשיך האו\"מ כו', והלא בקרבנות כתיב ריח\nניחוח לה' הרי הקרבנות הן ג\"כ בחי' ריח, וא\"כ מהו ההפרש בין הקרבנות\nוהקטרת כו', דמאחר דשניהם הם בחי' ריח וא\"כ מהו ההפרש ביניהם כו'. ולהבין\nזה ילה\"ק תחלה דכללות ענין הריח הוא מה שבא ע\"י בירורי הניצוצות דתהו\nכו', להיות ידוע דריח שרשו מבחי' הגבו' דוקא דהרי כל ריח הוא מדבר החזק\nדוקא, דדבר הבלתי חזק לא יהי' ממנו ריח כ\"א מדבר החזק וחריף, וכמו התבלין\nשמתבלין בהם המאכלים שכולם המה דברים חריפים ומהם בא הריח כו'. דכמו\"כ\nהוא בנמשל דענין הריח הוא מבירורי הניצוצו' דתהו שהן בבחי' הגבו' בחי'\nאורות תקיפים וחזקים כו', וכמארז\"ל לעולם יהא אדם רך כקנה ואל יהא קשה\nכארז, רך כקנה הן בחי' מדות דתקון שהן בבחי' חלישות ובבחי' מיעוט האור\nכו', וקשה כארז הן מדות דתהו שהן בבחי' תוקף ובבחי' ריבוי האור כו', וזהו\nהן בהאורות והן בהכלים</p>\n<p>In the Torah portion of Noah, it is written, \"And the Lord smelled the\npleasing aroma and said, 'I will never again curse the ground...'\" The\nMidrash Rabbah explains that this aroma was the scent of Abraham our\nforefather ascending from the fiery furnace, and similarly, the scent\nof Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah ascending from the fiery furnace.\nThis raises a question: Why did the Lord respond with \"I will never\nagain curse\" specifically because of the scent of Abraham and\nHananiah, Mishael, and Azariah? On the surface, the pleasing aroma\nrefers to the sacrifices that Noah offered, which is also a profound\nconcept, as the mystery of the sacrifice ascends to the Infinite. What\nis added and renewed by the fact that the Lord smelled the scent of\nAbraham and the others?</p>\n<p>To understand this, we need to first distinguish between the\nsacrifices and the incense. Sacrifices are like bread, as it is\nwritten, \"My sacrifice, My bread for My offerings.\" Just as bread\nsustains the soul and connects it to the body, strengthening its\nfaculties, and as the saying goes, \"Until I have eaten, I do not\npray,\" similarly, sacrifices draw down the Infinite Light, which does\nnot manifest in the form of human likeness. However, this drawing down\nis only a limited illumination that descends within the chain of\ncreation. On the other hand, the incense represents a scent that\nrevives the soul, drawing from the essential connection between the\nsoul and the body, bringing forth new light and vitality. The cloud of\nincense draws the Infinite Light to manifest openly within the realm\nof creation.</p>\n<p>Yet, we still need to address the fact that sacrifices are referred to\nas \"a pleasing aroma to the Lord,\" indicating that sacrifices also\nhave the aspect of aroma. What, then, is the difference between\nsacrifices and incense if both are considered aromas?</p>\n<p>To understand this, we first need to establish that the concept of\naroma comes through the refinement of the sparks of Tohu (chaos). It\nis known that aroma originates specifically from strength, as all\naromas derive from strong substances. Weak substances do not produce a\nscent; only strong and sharp substances do, such as spices that are\nused to season food, which are all sharp and from them comes the\nscent. Similarly, in the spiritual realm, aroma comes from the\nrefinement of the sparks of Tohu, which are characterized by strong\nlights. As the sages said, \"A person should always be as soft as a\nreed and not as hard as a cedar,\" where being soft as a reed refers to\nthe attributes of Tikkun (rectification) that are characterized by\nweakness and diminished light. In contrast, being hard as a cedar\nrefers to the attributes of Tohu, which are characterized by strength\nand abundant light.

This is implied\nby the phrase \"the outcry that has come,\" referencing evening arrival,\nas in the expressions \"she came\" and \"Rachel came.\"</p>\n<p>To elucidate this, let's first understand a common phrase in the\nsayings of the sages: \"Revealed and known before Him who spoke and the\nworld came into being.\" The philosophers struggled with the concept of\nDivine providence, like the idea that no person stubs their toe below\nunless it is decreed above. They found it challenging to reconcile\nthat, given His unity and singular truth, how could the Divine know\nparticulars and exercise providence over many details without implying\nmultiplicity?</p>\n<p>The sages addressed this in one statement: \"Revealed and known before\nHim.\" Divine knowledge is not like human knowledge, where a person's\nmind must grasp something it previously did not know. Human knowledge\ninvolves a change and engagement with the known object, whereas Divine\nknowledge is inherently revealed and known. All is revealed before Him\nnaturally, without the need for engagement or change.</p>\n<p>Since it is all inherently revealed and known, the issue of\nmultiplicity does not arise, as it would with human knowledge, which\nrequires the mind to engage with and understand particulars. Divine\nthoughts are not our thoughts, for everything is inherently known to\nHim.</p>\n<p>The scripture states in Zechariah 4:10, \"These seven are the eyes of\nthe Lord, which roam to and fro through the whole earth,\" and in 2\nChronicles 16:9, \"For the eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout\nthe whole earth.\" The term \"run to and fro\" seems to suggest an active\nobservation, implying engagement with the seen objects, seemingly\ncontrary to the idea of inherent knowledge.</p>\n<p>However, this can be understood by noting that within the ten sephirot\n(spheres) there are both lights and vessels. Attributes like love and\njudgment are vessels, whereas the light is an emanation from the\nInfinite that transcends these attributes. The light becomes clothed\nin the vessels, which define and limit it. This allows the light to\nsustain beings appropriately, just as charity is given through a\nphysical hand, with the soul acting through the body.</p>\n<p>Similarly, within the vessels of the ten sephirot, the merits and\nfaults of each creation are elevated. When a person sins, an\naccusatory angel is created, affecting the angel overseeing that\nmatter. There are angels receiving from different attributes, like\nMichael from kindness and Gabriel from severity. This process involves\nthe vessels of the ten sephirot of sovereignty within the worlds of\nBeriah, Yetzirah, and Asiyah (Creation, Formation, and Action), where\nthe Infinite light is clothed.</p>\n<p>Thus, the elevation to the Infinite light occurs through the vessels\nof the ten sephirot. Therefore, the term \"His eyes roam to and fro\"\nrefers to the vessels of the ten sephirot.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This isn't a comprehensive theological answer to your question, but I wanted to expound, from a logical perspective, on something another user mentioned.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's <a href=\"https://www.torahweb.org/torah/2017/moadim/rwil_rh.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explained</a> that in order for Hashem to explain why that was\nhappening, He would have to \"unravel\" the entire universe back to it's\norigins to show us why it should happen.

Why don't they just eat their animals?</p>\n<p>They ask for meat, when scripture makes it clear they left Egypt with many kosher for eating animals.</p>\n<p>They ask for water and make a big deal how the Israelites and their animals are dying of thirst, which again begs the question of why don't they eat their animals?</p>\n<p>And then after the death of Aaron many years later, the Israelites and their animals are still begging for water.</p>\n<p>So my question is, why don't the Israelites eat their animals when it seems like such an obvious answer to a series of very serious problems.</p>\n<p>Edit: In levticus we find that they are then commanded to only eat animals that were offered up in sacrifice.

[...] It is adequate if\nthe mashkof, or lintel, merely provides an aesthetic function of\ngiving the entrance the appearance of a doorway. However, when there\nis no mashkof at all, that is, nothing comes down vertically to give\nthe appearance of a lintel, there is no requirement to install a\nmezuzah, even when there are two proper sideposts and even when there\nis a door.</p>\n<p><strong>Sidepost</strong></p>\n<p>[...] The Rosh (Hilchos Mezuzah #14) explains that the case is where\none entire wall of the room or house is missing, and thus the\nentranceway is created by the wall ending, rather than the existence\nof an actual door.

According to this approach, there is no\nrequirement to place a mezuzah unless the entrance has two sideposts.</p>\n<p><strong>Door</strong></p>\n<p>In this instance, the Rambam’s position is a minority opinion, since\nmost other Rishonim contend that the lack of a door does not absolve\nthe requirement of a mezuzah.

[The OP writes: <em>it has come to my attention that there are “doubts.”</em> and <em>I was told by certain Litvish, Chabad, and Ashkenazi rabbis that they cannot rely on it</em> ] It is a good practice between different communities to resolve doubts by communication.

For example, the lion was the animal of choice in the eponymous lion's den. I'll leave it to other members of Mi Yodeya to find many other examples.</p>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I haven't seen this anywhere, but just some sources I put together:</p>\n<p>When Tosfot Brachot 18b says “ שהוא חמור שבספרים” which we translated as “the most difficult” it could mean the most difficult on a spiritual/emotional level. Let me explain.</p>\n<p>It is first important to give an intro as to why I refer to Vayikra as a whole as Korbanot:</p>\n<p>The Ramban in his Hakdama to Vayikra says, והנה רוב הספר הזה בקרבנות בתורת הקרבן והמקריבין ובמקום שיתקרב בו. ויבואו בו קצת מצות נגררות עם אלה, meaning that most of this sefer deals with korbanot and then you have some mitzvot that get dragged along. And later on, he says, ובפרשת קדושים תהיו קצת מצות לבני ישראל רובן נגררות עם עניני הקרבנות או בדומים להם, that in Parshat Kedoshim there are some mitzvot that address Bnei Yisrael, but most of them are mentioned because of some connection with the offerings or matters similar to them. Therefore it seems like the entire theme of Vayikra is Kohanim and korbanot.</p>\n<p>Next part:</p>\n<p>The Ramban in Vayikra 1:9 (who disagrees with the Rambam) gives the whole explanation as to why we give korbanot. He explains that korbanot are a response to humanity's failures and aveirot. The stages of the sacrificial process are intricately designed to mirror the three facets of human actions through which aveirot are manifested: thoughts, words, and deeds. Actions that are aveirot are addressed through S'micha, where the person bringing the Korban places their hands on the animal before it's slaughtered. Aveirot committed through speech are acknowledged through vidui, the verbal confession made by each person. Lastly, the sinful thoughts and desires that have pervaded the person's mind and neshama are symbolized through the burning of the animal on the altar and the sprinkling of its blood. In other words according to the Ramban, a person should realiz and contemplate every time he brings a korban that it is he that should be on the altar burning. Because he sinned against Hashem with his guf and neshama. It says in Vayikra 1:2, אדם כי־יקריב מכם קרבן, so the Slonimer Rebbe says that the word מכם means, “Don’t simply bring an animal!” The korban should be מכם, from within you! Surrender your desires, and perspectives that arise from your animalistic soul! Only when the sacrifice comes from within you does it become a \"korban laHashem.” Then you become close to Hashem. This is a hard thing to do and takes a lot of strength spiritually speaking to get there!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the Rebbe in Likutei Sichot first volume Parashat Vayikra page 196 the Rebbe explains what korabnot are in the spiritual sense, that a korban, after there is a fixing of blemishes, needs to be shechitah of the body and animalistic soul, meaning, there needs to be an exiting of the live spirit of the animalistic/physical desires. The physical stuff stays complete but it's not living/no spirit anymore to it, and is it now only used for extra strength in avodat Hashem as it says in Yoma 76b (and many more examples like this) where Rava says חמרא וריחני — פקחין, wine and good scents make me wise, meaning that if one uses the physical pleasures for the right reasons (avodat hashem), one becomes wise and stronger in his avodat Hashem. The Rambam in Hilchot Deot in the third chapter and Tur/Shulchan Aruch O.C. in Siman 231 say that a person should use the pleasures of this world leshem shamayim, for avodat Hashem. The Rebbe adds that it's not using the pleasures of this world for holiness, but actually turning the pleasures themselves into חפצא של מצוה. So also based on the Rebbe, we can say that it is difficult and takes a lot of strength to take physical desires and turn them into our avodat Hashem because its against our nature to do such (it's a miracle that the body and soul can function together to do Hashem’s will since they are complete opposites).</p>\n<p>Therefore I think that the lion was the animal the Gemera uses because a lion represents strength. This is seen in many places, including Pirkei Avot 5:20, יהודה בן תימא אומר, הוי עז כנמר, וקל כנשר, ורץ כצבי, וגבור כארי, לעשות רצון אביך שבשמים, meaning strong like a lion to to the will of Hashem. Also in Vezot Habracha it says 33:22, ולדן אמר דן גור אריה יזנק מן־הבשן, and many Rishonim explain like the Daat zekeinim that it means, שהיה עומד על הספר ושוקד ושומר על ישראל שלא יכנסו (אויבים) לארץ, that Dan’s soldiers were constantly guarding the border so the enemies don't attack them like lions. This can be compared spiritually speaking to constantly being on guard on the yetzer hara from us to do aveirot, which takes strength just like lions.</p>\n<p>This maybe explains what it says in Brachot 3a, ועל כל משמר ומשמר יושב הקדוש ברוך הוא ושואג כארי that Hashem roars like a lion. Why is Hashem compared here to roaring like a lion over the beit hamikdash? Perhaps the explanation is that since the beit hamikdash was all about the lion mentality, Hashem misses this mentality of bringing korbanot which represents the strength and difficulty of according to the Ramban surrendering ones desires, and perspectives that arise from their animalistic soul, like sacrificing a part of themselves. Also according to the Rebbe, about subjugation of our physical pleasures and even turning them into ways to serve Hashem even though physical and spiritual are not supposed to go hand in hand.</p>\n<p>Here is the likutei sichot:<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/894kIsTK.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/894kIsTK.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Link used: <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/parsha-insights-5757-vayikra-2/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://torah.org/torah-portion/parsha-insights-5757-vayikra-2/</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I believe that Tosafos is referring to <strong>Sifra</strong> which is the most difficult Sefer, not Sefer Vayikra.</p>\n<p>Presumably it is very difficult because it deals with the very complex laws of tumah.

Even though his intent was only “to\ndo”(לעשות), he is given the ability “to keep”(לשמור) away from sin, in\norder that he not be “one who immerses while holding a rodent”—so\nMidrash Shmuel. In a copy of Avot from the land of Israel the word “to\nkeep”(לשמור) does not appear, and this seems to be the correct text.\nFor “to do”(לעשות) would obviously include keeping away from sin; as I\nwrote earlier, far be it that that doing positive commandments but not\nkeeping away from negative ones be good in G-d’s eyes and an\nexpression of His will! “To do”(לעשות), rather, means simply to keep\nall the laws of the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note: <em>I added the hebrew words within () for better understanding</em></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A couple more reasons in addition to the other answer</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&p2=Yachin_on_Pirkei_Avot.4.30.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yachin</a> says that the two expressions are emphasising \"zachor\" the remembering of the Torah injunctions and \"shamor\" the keeping of the Torah. In his words:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>זכור ושמור ב' עניינים הם. דזכור היינו שיתעסק במחשבתו בעניין ההוא. ואעפ\"כ אפשר שישכחהו לאחר זמן. אבל שמור היינו לאו דוקא שיתעסק עתה מחשבתו בהעניין, רק שהעניין שמור בלבו כמאו דמונח בקופסא, וא\"א שישתכח מלבו, כדבר השמור במקום צנוע, דבכל עת שירצה ימצאנו</p>\n<p>Remember and Keep are two (distinct) matters. Since \"remembering\" means that one busies themselves thinking about the matter, and yet, it is possible that he may forget after some time has elapsed. But \"keeping\" means not specifically thinking about the matter, rather that the matter is preserved in his heart as if it were placed in a box and as a consequence is impossible that he forget it from his heart. It is like something that is kept in a concealed place that whenever he wants he will be able to find it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&p2=Yein_Levanon_on_Avot.4.5.7&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yein Levanon</a> says similar to what has already been suggested. Lishmor is relating to negative mitzvos and Laasos - positive mitzvos. As such, just as a person makes his soul and habituates himself to observe the mitzvos he has done, so too, he must make his soul habituate himself to \"guard\" (\"lishmor\") against the transgression. \"Laasos\" (\"to do\") therefore represents the natural follow-on. In other words, a person acts following the wisdom they have acquired. The wisdom ingrained in one's heart, habituates the soul to turn away from evil and do good, whilst also leading him to do many other mitzvos.</p>\n\n\n",

And Iran is building that nuclear weapon for that purpose.</p>\n<p>5-Now, our hope for millennia has been to end the Exile and for all of us to return to the Land of Israel.  The prophet Isaiah predicted that the Messiah will first usher in a world of peace, then lead the Jewish exiles back into the Land of Israel, where they would not be threatened since there would be peace in the world.  [Isaiah 11:1-13]</p>\n<p>Given all that, and before the Messiah arrives, what fraction of the Jews of the world should live in the Land of Israel, the rest living in the diaspora?  I know the Satmar, Neturei Karta and company want to wait for the Messiah in the diaspora, but how do our mainline commentators answer this question?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is a comment not an answer but too long to write in the comment section.</p>\n<p>The question in general follows the anti-Zionist viewpoint that  Zionism and Jews settling in Israel put Jews in danger therefore it should be opposed. The OP brings a proof for it from the Gemora which says <em>The Holy One, Blessed be He, performed a charitable deed toward Israel in that He scattered them among the nations. [Had He exiled them to a single place, they could all have been destroyed at one time]</em></p>\n<p>That Gemora in itself does not mention and does not lead to asking that question about Eretz Yisroel. You can just as easily ask what fraction of Jews should live <em>anywhere</em> prior to Mosiach given the safety to being scattered around.  100 years ago the Zionist movement was getting  it's momentum from the danger facing Jews who were NOT living in Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n<p>The Chofetz Chaim told people who were facing the danger in Europe before WII that they should go to Eretz Yisreol because there it will be safe prior to mosiach coming based on the posuk in Ovadia 1:17 which says  וּבְהַ֥ר צִיּ֛וֹן תִּֽהְיֶ֥ה פְלֵיטָ֖ה <em>And on Mount Zion there shall be a remnant</em> You would need someone like him to answer this question about today as well.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Moshe have to go to Hashem for what to do about the Shabbos desecrator?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It is a basic and accepted belief in Orthodox Judaism that both the Torah Shebikhsav (Written Torah) and the Torah Sheba Al Peh (Oral Torah) were given to Moshe. Considering this fact, why do we find numerous times in the Torah that Moshe (seemingly) did not know what to do al pi Torah Sheba Al Peh?</p>\n<p>For example, we find in Numbers <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.15.32?ven=Metsudah_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=bi&with=all&lan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">15:32–36</a> the story of a man found carrying wood on Shabbos. Moshe had to go ask Hashem what his fate should be, \"כִּ֚י לֹ֣א פֹרַ֔שׁ מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂ֖ה לֽוֹ\"—<em>\"Because it was not specified what was to be done to him\"</em>. If Moshe truly received the Oral Law from Hashem, why did he need to ask Hashem what to do? Why didn't he already know what to do himself?</p>\n<p>Another example of this problem is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Emor</a>, where the <em>M'kallel</em> who cursed Hashem is temporarily placed in a guardhouse \"לִפְרֹ֥שׁ לָהֶ֖ם עַל־פִּ֥י יְהֹוָֽה\"—<em>\"until [his penalty] would be explained through the word of Hashem\"</em>. Again, we have the same question. There are more examples, but the point is this is all very strange.</p>\n<p>Perhaps one could attempt to answer by saying Moshe did this out of humility, but that is hard to accept:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Why does he do so only in these particular cases?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This is not the way of humility. Moshe had been assigned as the leader of the Jewish people and answered all their questions. Why would he abandon his post merrily to indicate his own humility? Nowadays a Rabbi would <em>never</em> say, when they know the answer to a particular question, \"I don't know, let's go and ask someone else\"!</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Pesukim state each time that the reason for Moshe’s asking G-d is that he didn't know what to do. The Pesukim are talking (Pashtus) from a third-person viewpoint, independent of Moshe's thoughts, and is therefore an objective source of what was <em>really</em> going on (i.e. that Moshe truly didn't know).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Of course, the verse had explicitly already said to give the death penalty for Shabbos violation; the only question was which form to use. Whereas for the blasphemer, it hadn't explicitly stated the penalty anywhere.</p>\n<p>As for \"didn't Moshe already know\" ... and what about Moshe asking God about Pesach Sheni, or Tzlafchad's daughters ... simple answer is that when we say \"at Sinai\" we actually mean \"and follow-on conversations over the course of the desert, until the Torah as we know it was fully compiled just before [or just after] Moshe's death.\"</p>\n<p>An alternative would be that he was already taught everything, but some things weren't yet authorized to be given over to the people until a later date.</p>\n\n\n",

Or id it actually possible to do so?\nIf it is, the answer should provide the calculations to do so, ideally from kiddish hachodesh, and give the number of seconds since the beginning of day one in the answer.</p>\n<p>Although I might be getting confused because there were certain years that the beis din would make months either 29 or 30 days based on the riyah that we don't know about. But still, it's possible that we still do know the total number of days in each year etc. But I can't figure out exactly how, or if.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why isn't the lamb blood on the lintel and the doorposts an eternal commandment?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Exodus Chapter 12, Verses 21-24 read as follows (King James Translation)</p>\n<p>21  Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them: ‘Draw out, and take you lambs according to your families, and kill the passover lamb.</p>\n<p><strong>22  And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>23  For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.</strong></p>\n<p><em><strong>24  And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.</strong></em></p>\n<p>Clarification:\nExodus chapter 12. In traditional Judaism, this is not practiced in the Seder, nor was it practiced in the Second Temple period.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 14)\n\n<p>So the verses go like this:</p>\n<p>21: Slaughter a lamb.</p>\n<p>22: Put blood on the door and stay inside.</p>\n<p>23: [Why?] The blood will prevent being smitten as God smites Egypt.</p>\n<p>24: Do this in future generations too.</p>\n<p>It seems pretty clear that 22 and 23 go together; the reason for putting blood on the door is because God's smiting Egypt. But God is only smiting Egypt this year, not future years. Ergo, 24 -- \"do this in future generations\" is referring back to 21. Yes, it needs a little bit of forward-scanning and back-scanning.</p>\n<p>You were not the first to catch this! The classical commentary <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.12.24?lang=he&with=Ramban&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban (Moses Nachmanides) says exactly this</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND YE SHALL OBSERVE THIS THING. This refers to the Passover-offering\nitself, concerning which He had said above, and slaughter the Passover\nlamb, even though it is removed [by two verses from here]. It does not\nrefer to the putting of the blood [upon the lintel and on the two\nside-posts, mentioned above] in the verse nearby, since only in the\nPassover of Egypt were they commanded to do so, [i.e., to put the\nblood upon the lintel, etc.], as it is said, For the Eternal will pass\nthrough to smite the Egyptians; and when He seeth the blood upon the\nlintel, etc. Similarly, the expression, and ye shall keep this\nservice, means the offering of the Passover. A similar case [of a\nScriptural expression that is connected with one that is far removed\nand not with the one nearby], is the verse, <em>And also unto thy\nbondwoman thou shalt do likewise</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Passover sacrifice is mentioned several other places in the Torah, and it's clear that the blood-and-door thing was only for in Egypt. (In fact, the Talmud tallies the ways that \"Passover offering of Egypt\" was the same, and different, compared to \"the Passover offering of generations.\")</p>\n<p>So Year One Passover had blood on the door; as long as there was a Tabernacle or Temple (the next millennium or so, very roughly speaking), there was a Passover offering without the blood on the door. Today's Passover seder does not feature a Passover offering (in fact, we don't even eat any kind of dry-roasted meat, to avoid anyone even <em>thinking</em> that we're having a real sacrifice outside of Jerusalem) of any kind, and thus certainly doesn't have blood on the door.</p>\n<p>As far as why no Passover offering is brought in Jerusalem today, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/81392/how-come-we-dont-bring-the-pesach-offering-in-israel-now/81404#81404\">that's a separate question</a>. (There are a lot of technical obstacles from a strict Jewish-law perspective, and it's also not seen as politically feasible at the moment.)</p>\n<p>The Talmud actually notes that when there was a Tabernacle or Temple, the blood (caught immediately from slaughter) was placed on the altar there, then the meat taken to a nearby home or inn for consumption. Thus the doorpost actually served as a decentralized altar of sorts in Egypt. After the Exodus, worship was more centralized. (So practically, by the time the slaughtered lamb made it to your house/hotel in Jerusalem, it wasn't dripping blood anymore.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>R Avraham ibn Ezra reads the verses precisely as you do but bows his head to rabbinic tradition.</p>\n<p>Second Commentary Shemot 12:24</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND YE SHALL OBSERVE THIS THING. Many are of the opinion that the placing of the blood on the lintel and on the two side-posts is an obligation for all generations because 'this thing' is connected to the taking of the hyssop and dipping it into the lamb's blood. Furthermore, Scripture afterwards states: 'for that he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt' (v. 27).⁠ This interpretation would be correct from a logical point of view were it not for the true tradition which states otherwise.⁠ The correct interpretation is that 'this thing' refers to 'and kill the passover lamb'.⁠</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Edit: Thanks to DoubleAA.</p>\n<p>These questions can almost always be answered by looking at the context. In this case, the context is the next three verses:</p>\n<p>“And it will be, when you come to the land that [The Name] will give to you, as that which was spoken;—and you shall observe this rite.</p>\n<p>“And it will be, when your children say to you;—‘What is this rite to you?’</p>\n<p>“And you shall say, ‘It is a Passover slaughtering to [The Name], who jumped over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt, during His smiting Egypt; and He saved our houses.’ And the People paid homage and bowed.”</p>\n<p>Thus, the “eternal commandment” is defined by the following verses as the Pascal offering, a commandment which the Jews still have today, but cannot offer without the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Contradiction in Parashat Behukotai Blessings\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parashat Behukotai it is written: \"והשיג לכם דיש את בציר ובציר ישיג את זרע ואכלתם לחמכם לשובע...\" (Your threshing shall overtake the vintage, and your vintage shall overtake the sowing; you shall eat your fill of bread and dwell securely in your land.)\nAccording to the Mefarshim: \"ואכלתם לחמם לשובע\", means that you will not need to eat a lot for feeling satiated (be full of food). On the other hand, the other part of the verse, \"והשיג לכם דיש את בציר ובציר ישיג את זרע\", means that the land will yield a lot of production to harvest. This means that you will have to work continually to harvest the land production. But if we will feel satisfied with minimal amount of production, why would you need to work so hard to harvest, it does not seem blessing and seems to contradict the other part of the verse?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answer can be beautifully explained by analyzing the last bracha in that same verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִשִּׂ֨יג לָכֶ֥ם דַּ֙יִשׁ֙ אֶת־בָּצִ֔יר וּבָצִ֖יר יַשִּׂ֣יג\nאֶת־זָ֑רַע וַאֲכַלְתֶּ֤ם לַחְמְכֶם֙ לָשֹׂ֔בַע <strong>וִֽישַׁבְתֶּ֥ם לָבֶ֖טַח\nבְּאַרְצְכֶֽם׃</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this the Ohr HaChaim HaKadosh comments:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עוד ירצה באומרו וישבתם לבטח פירוש שלא תטרחו אתם בקציר ובבציר אלא זרים\nיעבודו ואתם יושבים בקתדרא, ואומרו לבטח שאין מיחוש על הקנין היותו ביד\nעובדים:</p>\n<p>Another aspect of the blessing contained in this verse is that\nforeigners will perform the heavy labour in our country whereas the\nIsraelites will \"sit securely in your land,\" not even worrying that\nthe foreign labourers may steal and cheat them out of their harvest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So now it can be understood. The first part of the bracha is in regards to the land yielding in abundance. The second part of the bracha is that you will be satiated with little food. The last bracha is that even though the land will produce in abundance and require a lot of work, you will not need to be the ones to do it and can rely on foreign labour. It would then be seemingly logical that with all the “remaining” produce they will sell and therefore make a profit so all the brachas tie in quite nicely with the explanation from the Ohr HaChaim HaKadosh</p>\n<p>See the Ohr HaChaim further on this same verse that also explains that this bracha, specifically of plentiful produce, will make the whole world recognize that the land of Israel belongs to us</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How can we understand the timeline of the Tower of Babel?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I'm not finding a coherent explanation of the ENTIRE timing issue of the Tower of Babel. That I'm seeing the issue talked about so little baffles me, as the basic math from a plain reading doesn't seem to work. I have searched for answers and tried to figure it out and am getting nowhere.</p>\n<p>This is all in relation to Genesis 11 and 12.</p>\n<p>According to the genealogy given in the text, Peleg (named thus \"for in his days the earth was divided\") was born 101 years after the end of the flood, a descendant of Shem. The Tower of Babel story is inserted in the middle of 2 genealogy listings. All of Noah is before, then Babel, then a further genealogy of Shem, giving father's ages which calculate to the 101 years.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> How was there a big enough population in 100 years to not only survive, but begin building a city/tower? I have seen calculations and the estimates from both YEC (Young Earth Creationist) and OEC (Old Earth Creationist) sites have calculated a population of around 1,000 people in 100 years, many of whom would be children and ostensibly, half women who wouldn't be much help as they'd be caring for children, food, etc. This is a very generous estimate, by the way, and I'm not sure it accounts for any deaths. This is pushing normal fertility windows pretty hard.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The timeline as given makes Noah still alive during the building of the tower. The problem I see here is that as the patriarch and his family were just preserved through the flood, that they would then be part of the building of the tower seems strange. They surely would have taught their families to be obedient.</p>\n<p><strong>3.</strong> How did they have the technology and means to make fired bricks in only 100 years? Even if they had the knowledge through Noah's family previously, they are starting from scratch after the flood, with only what is on the ark to work with. They would need food, clothing, shelter, etc - and they're building kilns and a city complex already?</p>\n<p><strong>4.</strong> The text says building the tower was to make a name for themselves. Who were they trying to impress if they were all one family in one area, the flood survivors and their descendants?</p>\n<p>I know Torah readers through the years have been able to do basic math - surely even Moses would have known this is not adding up, and yet here it is. There must be an explanation - or at least feasible possibilities - but I can't figure it out. I don't know Hebrew so I'm wondering if there is something lost in translation or perhaps my errant western understanding that is causing the problem. Please help me work through this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You don't need any specialized technology to make kilns. You can make them from mud bricks.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/wbc443KVWfI?feature=shared\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://youtu.be/wbc443KVWfI?feature=shared</a></p>\n<p>As for number of people, you only need 70 people to get 70 nations, separated by language. If people had children at age 15, that's 6 generations, stemming from Noah's 3 sons and their wives.  They also lived a long time so they had greater fertile windows to have way more children. The 3 sons would have known what cities are so they wouldn't have to reinvent technology.</p>\n<p>As for impressing people, they weren't trying to impress anyone, they were trying to kill God so he couldn't harm humanity any more.</p>\n\n\n",

See also Yechave Daat vol. 5 siman 33 pg. 188.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Following the teaching from Moshe Rabbeinu, the male convert follows what would be defined as Minhag Yisroel, what all Jews have accepted universally. It is in that sense that the response from Yalkut Yosef is intended. <strong>The Shulchan Aruch from Yosef Caro</strong>, the Beit Yosef, <em>was accepted universally as authoritative over the vast majority of the Jewish world at his time</em>. This is an explicit statement from the Lubavitcher Rebbe many times.</p>\n<p>They, meaning converts do not follow the minhag of any particular tribe (meaning specifically Ashkenazi, Polisher, Italian, Mizrachi, Catalani, Teimani or Sefardi minhag, etc.)</p>\n<p>In reality, Moshe Rabbeinu said it is forbidden for the male convert to affiliate with any individual tribe/minhag.</p>\n<p>This is straight from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.24.10-23?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">VaYikra 24:10-23</a>. The argument that arose between the \"<em><strong>son of the Jewish woman</strong></em>\" and the community, meaning <strong>the tribe of his mother</strong> (<em>the Tribe of Dan</em>), was that, unlike his mother, <em><strong>because he was a convert</strong>, he could not be included with the tribe of Dan or join them</em>. He was not included in their inheritance and would ultimately have no inheritance in their portion of the land of Israel (<em>The idea of inheritance also pertains to prayer Nusach.</em>)</p>\n<p>That case was brought before Moshe and his court and <strong>the view of the tribe was sustained as correct</strong> as <em>p'sak halacha l'ma'aseh</em>. The convert was outraged, feeling discriminated against and exited the court cursing G-d's name.</p>\n<p>Just to emphasize, <em>this also relates to the idea</em> repeated often in the Torah <em>of loving the Convert and not discriminating against them.</em> That they are to be considered and treated like a native-born Israeli.</p>\n<p>Consequentially, <strong>a female convert follows her husbands minhag</strong>, like you mention, <strong>because she becomes a part of his tribe <em><strong>like all other native born Jewish women</strong></em>.</strong> Their future children are members of the husbands tribe.</p>\n<p>If they, meaning the husband and wife are both converts, that means Minhag Yisroel only. And their future children <em>(at least the male children)</em> would be in the same situation.</p>\n<p>In terms of nusach of prayer, this is specifically what the innovation of <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380539/jewish/The-Thirteenth-Gate.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the nusach of the Ari z\"l</a> was for. <em><strong>It was intended for those who do not know to which tribe they are affiliated.</strong></em> This is to emphasize, that the nusach of the Ari z\"l is not nusach Sephard, like some claim. It is different.</p>\n<p>It really isn't so wild an idea. Levi'im and Kohanim also have diminished inheritances in the physical, material realm. This is because their inheritance is more in the spiritual realm.</p>\n<p>Part of this idea is that Levi'im and Kohanim pertain more to the idea of <em>the entire nation as a whole</em>, just like the Kohain Gadol <em>who represents the entire nation on Yom Kippur</em>. On Yom Kippur, if the Kohain Gadol entered the Holy of Holies thinking of himself and not the whole nation, he would not exit alive. This is similar to what is recounted on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.19b.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 19B</a>.</p>\n<p>So too, <em><strong>Converts</strong> are not confined within the boundaries of any individual tribe</em>, but <strong>pertain to the whole nation</strong> (קהלת ישראל, עדת ישראל).</p>\n<p>In the end, <em><strong>they will be given an inheritance</strong></em> in the land of Israel that is <em><strong>donated by all the tribes</strong></em> together.</p>\n<p>This is the land donation mentioned in Ezekiel 48:18-20 that will go to the \"City Workers\" (<strong>ה</strong>עבדי <strong>ה</strong>עיר). The double \"Heh\" alludes to their status as being B'nei Avraham and Sarah, the <strong>Children of Avraham and Sarah</strong>.</p>\n<p>When their names were changed from Avram and Sarai (אברם ושרי), the letter Yud (<em>which has a value of 10</em>) from Sarai's name was split into two, forming two Heh's (<em>which have a value of 5</em>). Half was given to her husband and half was retained by her, <em><strong>forever changing the destiny of them both</strong></em>. Their new names became Avraham and Sarah (אברהם ושרה).</p>\n<p>The Double-Heh (ה׳-ה׳) is a sign of being a convert just like is found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.22-23?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avot, 5:22-23</a> which mention Ben Bag-Bag (בן בג בג) and Ben Heh-Heh (בן הא הא).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Genesis Chapters 10 and 11 split seems to be in wrong location?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Regarding the Tower of Babel narrative...</p>\n<p>I have posted elsewhere about the timeline problem of Babel happening only ~100 years after the flood. Population, technology, etc. issues are all raised with such a short time frame. That question was closed as I had too many questions at once.</p>\n<p>I have found an alternate theory that I'd like to get feedback on.</p>\n<p>What if...Chapter 10 should end AFTER the Babel account, with Chapter 11 beginning before Shem's genealogy? This would place Babel after the language dispersion of the families, so 'whole earth' would be using the other definition more like whole area or country - this is not an uncommon interpretation from my understanding.</p>\n<p>Babel would be the end of the section that contains Nimrod (Ham's descendant), who may be the start of the clan that built Babel (Babel is mentioned with him). I have seen him mentioned as the one who built the tower. That then places Peleg (Shem's descendant) in a different section - and his name 'Division' could refer to something else. It usually means something 'cut into parts' more than 'scatter' from what I've seen, so that would also fit better. It is Peleg's birth time that causes the short time issue.</p>\n<p>I realize this is not the traditional understanding. However, it would clear up issues on the timeline. It could also place Babel at a time closer to archeological findings of when this type of brick was used.</p>\n<p>The only other seemingly viable option is that this is an illustration/parable/polemic that was inserted here and not a literal event - at least not in this time frame. I'm tagging this as contradiction because the timeline seems to contradict...well...math, history, and population growth.</p>\n<p>Please let me know your thoughts on this.</p>\n<p>Editing to add what the main question is. It seems the traditional understanding is that Babel happened when Peleg was born ~100 years after the flood, tying Babel to the genealogy following it. My question is if it is actually tied to the genealogy before it (containing Nimrod, founder of Babel). Or possibly something that happened later and is non-chronological. It makes more sense to me if it's tied to the genealogy before it, if it is connected at all. But the 'chapter' breaks I see in English language Torah has the break before the Babel story rather than after.</p>\n<p>A comment says that there is an open section surrounding the Babel story in the Torah before Chapters were put in, which would line up with what I'm thinking.</p>\n\n\n",

Or does this Gemara also mean the utensil used to pickle the meat is treated as <em>Ben Yomo</em> for 24 hours (which for <em>Basar B’chalav/Issur V’heter</em> means you have to wait 24 hours before kashering) like it would be if it were used to cook meat through heat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>You are speaking of the law of <em>kavush ke-mevushal</em>, pickling, and the halacha (YD 105) is that taste transfers even at cold when food is left immersed/soaking in a liquid for 24 hours or longer (and much faster for sharp foods, 6-18 minutes), similarly to the situation where it would have been cooked in the liquid. For instance, leaving milk together with a meat food for 24 hours renders both foods forbidden.</p>\n<p>In this case, <strong>the utensil is forbidden as well and needs <em>hagala</em></strong>. R Pinchas Cohen (in Laws of Kashrut p. 9) writes this does not apply to glass (NB: outside of Pesach where we are strict, see also <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-10-13/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>R Binyomin Forst (The kosher kitchen, pp. 77ff) writes poskim disagree whether this applies only to earthenware and other porous materials (e.g., stone) or to metals as well. He agrees this doesn't apply to glass outside of Pesach.</p>\n<p>Traditionally one waits 24 hours before performing <em>hagala</em>, but if one needs to kasher the utensil before 24 hours, <a href=\"https://ph.yhb.org.il/en/04-10-10/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">one can simply add soap to the kashering water</a>.</p>\n<p>See also Hebrew footnotes to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Peninei_Halakhah%2C_Kashrut.35.9.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Peninei Halacha Kashrut 35:9</a></p>\n\n\n",

There is a machloket if it's deoritah or derabbanan. The Gemera in Chullin 94a says, דאמר שמואל אסור לגנוב דעת הבריות ואפילו דעתו של עובד כוכבים, Shmuel said: It is prohibited to deceive people, and even to deceive a gentile (look at Chullin 94a for examples of gneivat da'at). The Ritva there says that Tosfoat holds gneivat da'at is an issur deoritah, also the Smag (ל\"ת קנ\"ה), the Yereim (מצוה קכ\"ד), and Kriat Sefer פרק י\"ח ממכירה, all hold that it's an issur deoritah. However the Smak (מצוה רס\"ב), Bach in Choshen Mishpat (סי' רכ\"ח), and Shulchan Aruch Harav (הלכות אונאה וגניבת דעת  סעיף י\"ב) all hold its derabbanan.</p>\n<p>This would not be לא תעשוק since in Shulchan Aruch Choshen Mishpat Siman 359:8 he writes that the prohibition of oshek refers to when somebody gives you money willingly, and when it is time to give it back, you refuse to, which is not the case by mortgage fraud because here your willing to give back the money and the person doesn't willing you give the money in a retroactive sense.</p>\n<p><strong>Regarding the second question: הפקעת הלוואה is a complex sugya so I'll do my best:</strong></p>\n<p>הפקעת הלואה <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.org.il/midrash/21873\" rel=\"noreferrer\">is</a> where the lender who could be a non-jew lends money to a Jew and the money has reached the Jew's hand <strong>in a permissible way</strong>. The Halacha is that as long as the non-jew forgets about the loan, the Jew doesn't need to pay it back. This halacha is brought down in the Rema C.M 348:2, where the Rema quotes in the name of the Tur (and basically a lot of Rishonim and Achronim who say it's allowed). However in this case, by mortgage fraud, the Jew taking the money, <strong>takes the money b'issur</strong> (in a prohibited fashion as explained above), and because of this, we cannot apply the הפקעת הלוואה here.</p>\n<p>Hope this makes sense!</p>\n<p><strong>Sources used:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Being_Careful_With_Other_People%27s_Money#cite_ref-47\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Being_Careful_With_Other_People%27s_Money#cite_ref-47</a></p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://minchasasher.com/he/shiur/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%AA-2/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://minchasasher.com/he/shiur/%D7%A4%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%94-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%92%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%91%D7%AA-%D7%93%D7%A2%D7%AA-2/</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

I think it depends on the context of where Tzeva'ot' is mentioned.</p>\n<p>The Gemera in Chagigah 16b says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וריש לקיש אמר: ״ה׳ צבאות שמו״ — אדון הוא בצבא שלו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And Reish Lakish said: He expounded the verse: “The Lord of hosts is His name” (Isaiah 48:2); He is the Master in His host.</p>\n<p>Also in Brachot 31b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמרה חנה לפני הקדוש ברוך הוא: רבונו של עולם, מכל צבאי צבאות שבראת בעולמך קשה בעיניך שתתן לי בן אחד?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Elazar explains that Hannah said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, are You not the Lord of the Hosts, and of all of the hosts and hosts of creations that You created in Your world, is it difficult in Your eyes to grant me one son?</p>\n<p>Also in Rashi in Beresheit 1:16:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עַל יְדֵי שֶׁמִּעֵט אֶת הַלְּבָנָה הִרְבָּה צְבָאָיהָ לְהָפִיס דַּעְתָּהּ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Because He diminished the moon, He increased its attendant hosts to mollify it (Genesis Rabbah 6:4).</p>\n<p>In these examples and many more, there is a common denominator based on what it says <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380329/jewish/Tzeva-ot-Master-of-Legions.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> that \"Tzeva-ot refers to Hashem as He is manifest in the lower worlds, the worlds of Separateness. Tzeva-ot contains the word tzava, meaning \"army\" or \"host\", and ot, meaning \"sign\". (So to fully see if this klal works we would have to all examples where Tzeva'ot' comes up). Assuming this definition is true, then in the context of the first Bracha in Brachot Kriat Shema in Aravit which talks about Hashem creating luminaries and setting them up in their right time, etc, its appropriate to use Tzeva'ot'which talks about Hashem being manifest in the physical world and being a master of the army of luminaries in the heavens and in the universe. That name just fits the context of the bracha.</p>\n\n\n",

That He will provide for us anything we need:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I would say that the reason for this mitzvah is to implant the character traits of faith and trust in Hashem in the people of Israel. Hashem was concerned that perhaps when they would come to the land they would work the soil in the natural way, and when they would be successful they would forget Hashem and remove their trust from Him. They would think that ‘their might and the power of their hand have made them this wealth,’ and the world goes along in its natural way. They would think that the land belongs to them; they are the masters and no one else. Therefore, Hashem took them out of the natural way altogether, for within six years the nations of the world plant their fields for two years and let one year lie fallow, so the land will not be weakened.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Last Shabbos, my chavrusa asked me what the spiritual meaning of Shemittah is nowadays, in our spiritual life. The Sefer HaChinuch says that shemittah is only observed and linked to Eretz Yisroel, since the posuk says: \"When you enter the Land\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Sefer_HaChinukh.84.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Sefer HaChinuch 84)</a>, but, for us being in Galus, there must be a deeper reason behind shemittah.</p>\n<p>My chavrusa came upon <a href=\"https://jewishaction.com/jewish-world/israel/spiritual-significance-shemitah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">an article</a> on Rabbi Kook (although I am not familiair with his teachings), where he says that shemittah in our days refer to refraining from mundane matters. This can be found in the original sefer, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat_HaAretz%2C_Introduction.10?vhe=Rav_Kook%E2%80%99s_Introduction_to_Shabbat_Ha%E2%80%99aretz,_Hazon,_NY_2014&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat HaAretz (Introduction, 10)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What Sabbath does for the individual, shmita does for the nation as a whole. The Jewish people, in whom the godly, creative force is planted eternally and distinctively, has a special need to periodically reveal the divine light within itself with full intensity. Our mundane lives, with their toil, anxiety, anger, and competition do not entirely suffocate this creative force. On the shmita, our pure, inner spirit may be revealed as it truly is. The forcefulness that is inevitably part of our regular, public lives lessens our moral refinement. There is always a tension between the ideal of listening to the voice inside us that calls us to be kind, truthful, and merciful, and the conflict, compulsion, and pressure to be unyielding that surround buying, selling, and acquiring things. These aspects of the world of action distance us from the divine light and prevent its being discerned in the public life of the nation. This distancing also permeates the morality of individuals like poison. Stilling the tumult of social life from time to time in certain predictable ways is meant to move this nation, when it is well-ordered, to rise toward an encounter with the heights of its other, inner moral and spiritual life.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Is this idea, that Rabbi Kook says <strong>echoed in other commentaries?</strong> That shemittah outside of Eretz Yisroel nowadays is for us to abstain from earthly matters for one year?</p>\n\n\n",

And even though the borrower is [still] exempt after the owners left [him], if they were there at the time of the borrowing — it is possible to answer about this that the Torah did not want to give different measures for its words and state that if the owners stay long, he will be exempt, but if [only] a little, he will be liable. [Instead,] the Torah commanded more generally that so long as the owners are there at the time of the borrowing, he will be exempt.\"</p>\n<p><strong>שואל ומשיב (מהדורא קמא, ח\"א סי' רסה), וז\"ל says:</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"... הטעם דפטור שמירה בבעלים הוא משום דאין השמירה כ\"כ חזקה על השומר שהרי גם הבעלים עמו. ולפ\"ז כל שנגרע משמירתו בזה פטור אף מפשיעה ...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"The reason for the exemption of guardianship in the case where the owner is present is because the guardianship is not considered as strong when the owner is with the guardian. According to this, whenever the guardian's level of care is reduced due to the owner's presence, he is exempt even in cases of negligence.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Torah Temimah Shemot 22 הערה קנג says:</strong></p>\n<p>\"ואפשר לומר הסברא בזה משום דבכלל אי אפשר לאדם אחד שיהיה בעת ובעונה אחת משועבד ומשעבד, לאיש אחד, ובאופן כזה אין השעבוד שלו לזולתו שעבוד גמור, ולכן אם היו הבעלים שאולים להשואל שוב אי אפשר שישתעבד לו השואל אז, וממילא אין נפקא מינה בין נשאל לו הבעלים במלאכה זו או במלאכה אחרת, וגם מובן מה שהעיקר תלוי אם היה עמו בשעת שאלה, דאז עיקר חלות ההשתעבדות מצד השואל\".</p>\n<p>\"And it is possible to say that the reasoning behind this is because, in general, it is impossible for one person to be simultaneously both a servant and a master to another person. In such a situation, the servitude of one to the other is not complete. Therefore, if the owners were borrowed by the borrower, it is no longer possible for the borrower to fully obligate them. Consequently, it makes no difference whether the owners were borrowed for this task or for another task. It also explains why the primary consideration is whether the owners were with the borrower at the time of the borrowing, since this is when the main obligation on the part of the borrower takes effect.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Ralbag Shemot Beur HaParashah 22:13-14 says:</strong></p>\n<p>מפני שבעליו היה תחת ידו בשעת שאלה, הנה לא יתכן שישתעבד לו אז בשמירת הבהמה, כי לא יהיה האדם עבד ואדון יחד לאיש אחד. ועוד, כי האדם כשעושה מלאכת אחר ייטב בעינו לההנות בעל המלאכה, כדי שייתן לו שכר המלאכות אשר לו, ולזה לא יחוש אם יקח כליו אע\"פ שלא יקבל שמירתו\".</p>\n<p>\"Since its owner was under his control at the time of the lending, it is not possible for him to be obligated in guarding the animal, for a person cannot be both a servant and a master to the same individual at the same time.

Thus, the key word in Yoma, leharher, is defined by Jastrow as having three different word senses:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הִרְהֵר, הִירְ׳  (Pilp. of הרר; v. הָרָה, cmp. esp. Is. LIX, 13)  1) to conceive in mind, to think, meditate, plan. Ber. III, 4 מְהַרְהֵר בלבו thinks (recites the Sh’ma) in his heart, v. הִרְהוּר. Gitt. 57ᵇ הי׳ תשובה בדעתיה he conceived the idea of repentance. —2) to be heated, entertain impure thoughts.

Snh. 110ᵃ המְהַרְהֵר אחר רבו who speaks evil of his teacher. Num. R. s. 7 אם הִרְהַרְתָּ וכ׳ if thou criticisest them &c. Ber. 19ᵃ אל תְּהַרְהֵר אחריו ביום do not think evil of him the day after (for he surely repented). Sifré Deut. 307 אין להַרְהֵר אחר מדותיו you must not criticise His dealings with man; a. fr. —4) to heat, make sick with fever. Lev. R. s. 17 (play on ח̇ר̇צבות, Ps. LXXIII, 4; v. ה\"א) לא הִרְהַרְתִּים בחלאים (Var. חרחר׳; Ar. s. v. חרצב: ערער׳) I did not make them hot with diseases; Yalk. Ps. 808. [Ukts. III, 11, v. חרְחֵר.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Word sense 3, which occurs when followed by the word אחר, means to disparage. He points to examples such as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.110a.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 110a</a>, where Rabbi Abahu speaks of one who thinks bad things about his own teacher:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ר חנינא בר פפא כל המתרעם על רבו כאילו מתרעם על השכינה שנאמר (שמות טז, ח) לא עלינו תלונותיכם כי (אם) על ה' א\"ר אבהו כל המהרהר אחר רבו כאילו מהרהר אחר שכינה שנאמר (במדבר כא, ה) וידבר העם באלהים ובמשה\nRabbi Ḥanina bar Pappa says: Anyone who expresses resentment against his teacher for wronging him, it is as though he is expressing resentment against the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “Your murmurings are not against us, but against the Lord” (Exodus 16:8). Rabbi Abbahu says: Anyone who suspects his teacher of wrongdoing, it is as though he suspects the Divine Presence, as it is stated: “And the people spoke against God, and against Moses” (Numbers 21:5). The verse likens God and Moses with regard to this matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.67b.4?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9C%D6%B0%D7%94%D6%B7%D7%A8%D6%B0%D7%94%D6%B5%D7%A8&with=Jastrow&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 67a</a> (Rav Steinsaltz's translation, on Sefaria):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דָּבָר אַחֵר: ״גְּזֵירָה״, שֶׁמָּא תֹּאמַר מַעֲשֵׂה תֹהוּ הוּא, תַּלְמוּד לוֹמַר: ״אֲנִי ה׳״, אֲנִי ה׳ גְּזַרְתִּיו, וְאֵין לְךָ רְשׁוּת לְהַרְהֵר בָּהֶן.\nAlternatively, the word gezeira is written lest you say the procedure of the scapegoat is a meaningless act, since what sanctity and atonement is achieved in sending the goat to Azazel and pushing it from the cliff? Therefore, the verse states: “I am the Lord” (Leviticus 18:5), i.e., I, the Lord, decreed it [gezartiv], and you have no right to question it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>though <em>acharav</em> doesn't follow the word. Similarly, Artscroll renders it as no right to ponder them\", but in footnote 10, writes \"i.e. to question\".</p>\n<p>So too, the Chabad Tanach you eventually linked to above has a translation of Rashi. They write that this is the \"English translation of the entire Tanakh (Tanach) with Rashi's commentary. This Hebrew Bible was edited by esteemed translator and scholar, Rabbi A.J. Rosenberg.\"</p>\n<p>Rabbi Rosenberg translated that Rashi, and the gemara in Yoma that Rashi drew it from, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9947/showrashi/true/jewish/Chapter-19.htm#v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thusly</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the statute of the Torah: Because Satan and the nations of the world taunt Israel, saying, “What is this commandment, and what purpose does it have?” Therefore, the Torah uses the term “statute.” I have decreed it; You have no right to challenge it. — [Yoma 67b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the Rambam you have linked to also has an English translation by Rabbi Eliyahu Tauger, and it also renders it \"question\", though you wrote that literally it means \"think about\". Other ideas developed in this chapter of the Rambam have to do with not regarding it \"lightly\" if you cannot find a reason for it, דָבָר שֶׁלֹּא יִמְצָא לוֹ טַעַם וְלֹא יֵדַע לוֹ עִלָּה אַל יְהִי קַל בְּעֵינָיו. Immediately after the hirhur quote is that the nations, and one's inclination, challenges these decrees, \"וְאֵין לְךָ רְשׁוּת לְהַרְהֵר בָּהֶן. וְיִצְרוֹ שֶׁל אָדָם נוֹקְפוֹ בָּהֶן וְאֻמּוֹת הָעוֹלָם מְשִׁיבִין עֲלֵיהֶן\". Question is unquestionably a good translation here.</p>\n<p>The word is therefore \"challenge\", or \"question\", or \"disparage\". It does not need to mean \"think about\", in terms of figuring out the <em>taamei hamitzvot</em>.</p>\n\n\n",

For example, if one says: \"Konam that I speak to you!\" or \"serve you\" or \"go for you\" or \"sleep with you\" - this is no vow. So too, if one phrases it this way: my speech, my servitude, or my going is forbidden to you, or sleep is forbidden to me - this is no vow. However, on a rabbinic level one should have these annulled.\"</p>\n<p>This means that with regards to Nedarim that are not tangible, for example in our case the person makes a neder to not speak, that is not tangible, and only mederabbanan we would need to התרת נדרים through a שאילה which means to find out how to be מתיר the neder.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The first option is that if we are dealing with a women who makes a neder to not speak, according to Rebbi Akiva Eiger in Yoreah Deah Siman 228:16 he says that a man can be a shaliach for a women and matir the neder by using the principle of אשתו כגופו, so then, in that case, a woman wouldn't need to talk at all to be matir the neder since he husband does it for her.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>However if the man made the neder to not speak, then since in Yoreah Deah Siman 228:14 it says, קודם שיתירו לו צריך שיפרט להם הנדר והסיבה שבשבילה נדר ואם לא פרט אין התרתן התרה ומיהו כשיפרוט לאחד מהמתירין סגי, Prior to annulment, [one] must state the vow explicitly and the reason the vow was taken. If the vow was not stated, the nullification is not [considered] a nullification. However, if one states the vow to one [of the people] that are nullifying the vow, then it suffices. So the question is if the person who made the neder can write down the reason for the neder or not? I think that it works because we pasken like Rav Pappa in Gittin 35b who says we need to לְפָרֵט אֶת הַנֶּדֶר, to detail and spell out the neder because מילתא דאיסורא, maybe because the neder was on something prohibited where we can not matir it, so if the goal of לְפָרֵט אֶת הַנֶּדֶר is merely to just to receive information if the neder was concerning something prohibited writing that down would accomplish the same goal, therefore the man just needs to write down what his neder is and the purpose of it and then the Beit Din does there thing. (I still need to check if writing down works but it seems right logically).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Note: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/142322/31534\">non-Jews are exempt</a>, even though this is logical.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>If not, then is it because Chazal are actually saying that God's existence and ownership of the world is also a <em>svara</em>?</strong></p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/133254/31534\">this question</a> and its answers for lots of good sources to look at regarding this.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The phrase from <em>Brachot</em> 35a cited by the OP is from the beginning of the sixth <em>perek</em> of <em>Brachot</em> where the <em>Gemara</em> attempts to find a satisfactory scriptural source <em>passuk</em> (verse) from which to derive the obligation to make a <em>bracha</em> before eating. The <em>Gemara</em> is unable to do so for a variety of largely technical reasons.</p>\n<p>The final conclusion of <em>Brachot</em> 35a is that no source <em>passuk</em> is needed. Instead, the conclusion is that the obligation is a <em>sevarah</em>, a logical inference because the entire world belongs to Hashem (see Tehillim 24:1 cited on Berachot 35a: לַה׳ הָאָרֶץ וּמְלוֹאָהּ – the earth and all it contains belongs to HaShem).\nTherefore, it is logical that we must not derive benefit until we say a bracha and remind ourselves that the world is not ours.</p>\n<p>This logic appears to be that a Scriptural verse is required to tell us something that we may otherwise not know. Gratitude to the Lord creator of the world is so obvious that no Scriptural source <em>passuk</em> is required.</p>\n<p>In answer to the OP’s question:<br />\n\"<em><strong>if someone doesn't believe in G-d, is he patur (exempt) from saying berachot for worldly benefits?</strong></em>\"</p>\n<p>my answer is that as a matter of <em>halacha</em> the obligation to say <em>berachot</em> is not dependent on the reason for <em>brachot</em>.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the non-believer, will not agree that he can be, as a matter of logic, subject to an obligation to thank a deity in whose existence he does not believe.</p>\n\n\n",

I'll summarise:</p>\n<p>The Ishbitzer Rebbe, Rabbi Gershon Chanoch Henech Leiner Ztl, points out that the standard understanding of אין בור ירא חטא is that if someone doesn't fear sin, they won't study Torah; nothing would compel them to do so.</p>\n<p>So, he explains, the <em>chiddush</em> is that fear of sin in this context means <strong>fear of Hashem</strong>, and that isn't truly possible without Torah. This is because Torah brings one to the level of being able to actually fear Hashem, instead of being afraid because of one's own deficiencies:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזה ענין, שיסוד היראה העיקרית הוא אמונה, שעל ידי שיבין ויאמין בדעת\nברוממות הש\"י, ועל ידי זה יירא את הש\"י, אז <strong>תהיה יראתו שלמה</strong>. שהיראה שהיא\nמצד האדם, הוא רק מפני שמכיר חסרונו</p>\n<p>The true foundation of the fear of God is faith. Only by understanding\nand consciously believing in the supreme lofty heights of God, and\nthen actively fearing Him, does <strong>fear become complete</strong>. Man's normal\nexperience of fear usually stems from an awareness of his own\ndeficiencies [borrowed Betzalel Edwards' translation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He goes on to explain that by studying Torah, we learn about Hashem and thus have a different lot to the idolators of the world, who are stuck at the level of fearing their own deficiencies (rather than only using their deficiencies to better recognise the perfection of Hashem, and be in awe).</p>\n<p>So, quote the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tikkunei_Zohar.5b.3?vhe=Tikkunei_Zohar&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tikkunei Zohar</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבלאו אורייתא לית דחילו כד\"א   אין בור ירא חטא וכגוונא דלית אורייתא\nבלא דחילו <strong>אוף הכי לית דחילו בלא אורייתא</strong> וכו׳</p>\n<p>For without Torah, there is no fear of God. This is as it is said\n(Pirkei Avot, 2:5), “An unlearned person does not fear sin.” Just as\nthere is no Torah without the fear of God, <strong>similarly, there is no fear\nof God without the Torah.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, for the second part. Perhaps this is a valid answer based on the Mesilat Yisharim's chapter 24 on יראת חטא, who explains that יראת חטא has two levels. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim.24.5?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">One is suitable לעמי הארץ</a>, and is all about fearing for one's own interests. The second is the real יראת חטא, and is only attainable after having become a חסיד, as he writes at the start of the chapter: כבר לא יוכל להגיע אליו, אלא מי שכבר השיג כל המדות שקדם זכרם</p>\n<p>This I believe is what the Mishna is talking about, because it is noted by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Kamma.30a.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">gemara Bava Kama 30a</a> that Pirkei Avot is aimed at a חסיד, who goes beyond the letter of the law. This type of ירא is the fear of the exaltedness of Hashem, because Hashem is the focus of one's heart and soul (rather than focussing on oneself). This is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim.24.3?lang=bi&lookup=%D7%9C%D7%A2%D7%9E%D7%99%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5&with=Lexicon&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">שלמותה of the ירא according to Ramchal</a>, and indeed quotes the Mishna when explaining that being a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mesillat_Yesharim.18.5?vhe=Sefaria_Vocalized_Edition&lang=bi&sbsq=%D7%A2%D7%9D%20%D7%94%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5%20%D7%97%D7%A1%D7%99%D7%93&with=SidebarSearch&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חסיד in chapter 18</a> requires perfect character, great depth in [Torah] understanding, and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על יסודות חכמה רבה ותקון המעשה בתכלית אשר ראוי לכל חכם לב לרדף אחריו,\nכי רק לחכמים להשיגו באמת, וכן אמרו ז\"ל (אבות פ\"ב): לא עם הארץ חסיד.</p>\n<p>on foundations of great wisdom and utmost rectification of one's\ndeeds, which befits every wise hearted man to pursue. For only the\nwise can truly attain it, as our sages stated: \"an unlearned man\ncannot be pious\" (Avot 2:5) [borrowed translation of Rabbi Yosef Sebag]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>: It seems for many reasons, that the quoted sources are both discussing a unified set of ideas that explain the chiddushim of this Mishna, which become apparent when considering the fact that Avot is speaking to the aspiring חסיד, rather than someone who is merely seeking the <em>din</em>.</p>\n<p>According to the understanding of the Ishbitzher and Ramchal, the Mishna is saying that real fear of sin, i.e. fear of God rather than reward or punishment, is not possible without Torah study. It takes  becoming a חסיד - someone who goes beyond the letter of the law - as a pre-requisite. That is not accessible to an עם הארץ (as it takes being a Tzaddik* and Talmid Chacham).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* as defined by Ramchal. In Chassidus, this level refers to Benoni. Compare Ramchal's definition of Naki (explained as referring to a \"Tzaddik\" in Chapter 13), and the description of Benoni in Tanya Chapter 1</sup></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did the nations reject the Torah if they were obligated regardless as bnei noach?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There's a well known <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.343.6?lang=bi&with=all\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">midrash</a> that HaShem went around offering the Torah to other nations prior to offering it to Israel, with the nations rejecting it for various reasons (restrictions on theft, murder and adultery).</p>\n<p>Weren't they already obligated in those commandments as bnei noach (if anything it would get better for them as it is easier to convict under bnei noach law)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I remember hearing from Rav Yaakov Weinberg z\"l, something like:<br />\nThe Sheva Mitzvos for Bnei Noach are not a ברית, a covenant. They don't define a relationship. They are just a set of rules posted on the wall of the hotel: If you stay here you must do the following...<br />\nThe Torah is very different. They were being offered the opportunity to be part of the ברית with Hashem, with Israel. They would have had a relationship.<br />\nI don't think they were offered the <em>same</em> relationship as Israel - my clear impression from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.343.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifri on V'zos Habracha</a> is that they were bound to be in a less central position (see the part about the donkey and the dog). The Midrash sounds like they would not have had 613 mitzvos; from the Midrash, more than just 7 mitzvos, but less than what Israel was given. I don't know what it would have looked like exactly. Maybe each nation would have emphasized different things?<br />\nBut they were offered a real covenant, and the world would be a better place if they had joined. We would not have to wait until Moshiach for all the nations to serve Hashem.</p>\n<p>So I think the answer to your question is that they never really had to accept it before. Now it was real, and they weren't willing to do that.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are many answers given to this question. Among them are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The scope of mitzvos is different: For an aku\"m, murder means unlawfully killing another person.  Yet, for a Jew, murder goes far beyond that.  Someone who embarrasses his friend publicly, malbin pnei chaveiro b'rabim, is guilty according to Chazal of the dust of shefichus damim, murder.  The same is true of arayos, theft, and many other mitzvos.  You don't need to mug someone to be guilty of gezel. If you make noise that disturbs your neighbor's sleep, it's gezel sheinah.  This is what the nations of the world were rejecting.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Torah is a lifestlye, not just a set of laws.  What Eisav and Yishmael and the other nations were telling G-d is that their culture is one of bloodshed, theft, arayos, etc.  The ben Noach laws require them to curb their natural instinct, but Torah isn't only about that.  The Rambam writes in Shmoneh Perakim that the goal of Torah is to transform a person into someone who does not desire bloodshed, or theft, or other crimes -- not simply to avoid committing them. The nations could not envision changing in that way</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>It's true that the Bnei Noach were already commanded in those laws. But here they were being asked: \"Do you WANT to accept these laws?\" Their response was in the negative.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is Tosefta Avodah Zarah misinterpreting the Talmud with regard to prohibited sexual relations for gentiles?",
    "content": "# Is Tosefta Avodah Zarah misinterpreting the Talmud with regard to prohibited sexual relations for gentiles?\n\n## Frage\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yoḥanan: Any forbidden sexual relations for which a Jewish court administers capital punishment are prohibited to a descendant of Noah, and any forbidden sexual relations for which a Jewish court does not administer capital punishment are not prohibited to a descendant of Noah; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say: There are many types of forbidden sexual relations for which a Jewish court does not administer capital punishment and are nevertheless prohibited to a descendant of Noah (Sanhedrin 57b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Forbidden sexual relations, how so? Any prohibited sexual relation that a Jewish court would inflict capital punishment, the sons of Noach are forbidden [from doing so]. And every prohibited sexual relation that a Jewish court would prohibit, the sons of Noach are put to death on their account according to Rabbi Meir. But the Sages say, there are many forbidden sexual relations on account of which a court would not inflict capital punishment and about which the sons of Noach are not warned (Tosefta Avodah Zarah 9:4).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The tosefta seems to be saying the opposite of the Talmud.  The Talmud says that sexual offenses that Jews receive non-capital punishment for are permitted to gentiles, but the tosefta says that gentiles are executed for anything that is a sexual offense for a Jew.  Also, what does it mean by “not warned”?  Does this mean it is permitted to gentiles or that they are executed for it without a warning?  That sentence in the Talmud seems to be saying there are more sexual offenses for gentiles beyond ones that are capital offenses for Jews, so why wouldn’t they be warned?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>When the Talmud says that it's quoting a baraita, it's most likely referring to this very Tosefta (the Tosefta is a collection of baraitot); it isn't the Tosefta misinterpreting the Talmud. Still, there is a contradiction between the sources (and not a variance in wording which wouldn't be unusual). The printed text of the Tosefta seems to be corrupt here, and needs to be emended:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20419&pgnum=502\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Erfurt manuscript of the Tosefta</a> simply omits the second half of the words attributed to Rabbi Meir (delete the words \"and every prohibited sexual relation that a Jewish court would prohibit, the sons of Noach are put to death on their account\").</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Alternatively the Tosefta could be emended to match the text cited in the Talmud, since the Talmud's citations of the Tosefta are generally more reliable than the text appearing in the Tosefta (\"and every prohibited sexual relation that a Jewish court <em>does not administer capital punishment for are not prohibited to</em> the sons of Noach\").</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Or the Tosefta could be emended by adding the word \"not\" (\"the sons of Noach are <em>not</em> put to death on their account\"; suggested by <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37970&pgnum=341\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchat Bikkurim</a>; at least as I understand it, his suggestion of ממיתין is equivalent to or a mistake for מומתין). But this text is still odd for a few reasons (\"not put to death\" seems to imply that these sexual unions are still prohibited, which would also contradict the text in the Talmud; and ב\"ד של ישראל  מוזהרים is a very strange way to refer to capital punishment and I think it's more likely a scribal error).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As for the meaning of \"not warned,\" it simply means (and should be translated as) \"not prohibited.\" The word used is for prohibition (אזהרה), not a formal warning voiced by witnesses (התראה) which is not part of this discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

The recitation of these verses before engaging in Torah study reminds us daily that an ultimate purpose of Torah is to enable man to feel G-d's love and experience His blessings.  From the very first words of the Torah, which describe how the entire world was created for the sake of man, every letter of the Torah is ultimately a proclamation of how dear man is in the eyes of G-d.  If G-d did not love you, He would have no reason to create you or to care about what you do, and He certainly would have no reason to want to bless you.

Therefore, since he never relinquished ownership from it, it still belongs to him and one who finds it must return it.</p>\n<p>If one lost an object with no recognizable sign on it (also assuming that the original owner didn't know about the witnesses. If he did know, maybe other laws would apply) that means that at the moment the original owner realized the object was lost (with no sign), he <strong>gave up hope</strong> of retrieving it.</p>\n<p>That feeling of giving up hope of retrieving it has legal implications.

There's no difference in principal.</p>\n<p>The phrase, יחי אדונינו מורינו ורבינו מלך המשיח לעולם ועד, \"long live our master, teacher and Rebbe, the King Moshiach, forever and ever\", is typically said by a lot of his followers, while others of his followers oppose it.</p>\n<p>Did the Rebbe ever want it to be said, even after his passing?</p>\n<p>I'm aware he waved his head and hands back and forth a few times between 1993 and 1994 when people were saying it, implying he encouraged it</p>\n<p>But maybe he just didn't want to upset the people who were physically there, and ruin the nice moment, but that wouldn't have any implications about what other people should do in different places and times</p>\n<p>I'm not aware of him ever speaking to people telling them they should say it, or otherwise writing that it should be said.</p>\n<p>When he made other campaigns that he wanted people to do, like learn daily Rambam etc., he gave specific instructions of what to do and how to do it, but I'm not aware of any instructions he gave for this specific phrase</p>\n<p>This question is not asking if there is evidence that he is Moshiach or not, just about if he wanted people to say this specific phrase.</p>\n<p>It's also not asking about the phrase יחי המלך.</p>\n<p>Any sources or first hand accounts of people hearing from the Rebbe, OR from people whom the Rebbe personally appointed to represent Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch and/or other central Chabad organizations that shed light on what he would have wanted people to do about this phrase, would be helpful.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The reason the answer to this question is going to be primarily opinion based is there was never a time in which the Lubavitcher Rebbe ever directly said to say this statement. There were times in which it appeared that the singing was encouraged and other times in which it was discouraged but a direct statement to the matter was not made. This leads the questioner to be left with interpreting other statements on the subject of moshiach and then deciding whether they should sing or not sing this song.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Like I mentioned in my comments to your question, the idea of demanding, meaning ordering people to say the phrase, יחי אדונינו מורינו ורבינו מלך המשיח is contrary to the general concept of Kingship מלכות and the mitzvah of <strong>Appointing a King</strong>.</p>\n<p>That like the Rebbe taught over many years quoting from the <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=16082&st=&pgnum=225\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzemach Tzedek in Sefer Derech Mitzvotecha</a>, the appointment of someone as King is strictly a voluntary act by the people and cannot be demanded. To emphasize, it is the choice of each individual and is not something forced upon the people.</p>\n<p>For context, think about the analogy of what is called the period of <em>Nasirah</em> that occurs on Erev Rosh HaShanah and the night of Rosh HaShanah before we blow shofar in the morning.</p>\n<p>We accept G-d as our King through the blowing of the Shofar on Rosh HaShanah in the morning. Then, after accepting the Kingship of Heaven, <em>the HaNetanah Tokef</em> is recited during Musaf, recalling the judgement by the re-established King of the Universe of each and every created thing, each according to its unique circumstance.</p>\n<p>Making a demand of the people by force is the act of a Moshel המושל or Rodan הרודן, something akin to a Dictator.</p>\n<p>That said, you ask if the Rebbe wanted this phrase to be said. <em><strong>The simple answer is yes.</strong></em> There is a long history of this practice within Chabad like, for example the photo from the book titled בנאות דשא published by Kehot recording the Rebbe's trip to Camp Emunah and Camp Gan Yisroel in the year 1956. The banner placed over the entrance to the camp read: יחי אדונינו מורינו ורבינו מלך המשיח. In other words, this practice was known already when the Rebbe first filled the place of his father-in-law.</p>\n<p>Concerning the importance and significance of saying exactly this phrase voluntarily, an importance both to the people themselves and to the leader, is something addressed by the Rebbe directly. It is not an innovation of the Rebbe, but consistent with the teachings of his predecessors. One of the primary sources for this comes from the talk of the Rebbe from 2 Nisan, 5748. (<em>March 20, 1988</em>)</p>\n<p>In this talk, the Rebbe is speaking about (in his words) <em>the Nasi of our generation</em>, meaning the Nasi of <em>the Rebbe’s</em> generation, (<em>so it is pertaining to his father-in-law, the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe (who said publicly that during his lifetime that we had entered the epoch called</em> עקבתא דמשיחא <em>Heels of Moshiach</em>),)  38 years after his ascent from our world. But as the Rebbe emphasizes, it also pertains to <em>Melech HaMoshiach</em>.</p>\n<p>So in answer to one detail of your question, it is applicable whether the individual is standing before you, soul dressed in a body or not.</p>\n<p>The relevant section begins on page 496, paragraph 4 through page 498, paragraph 6.</p>\n<p>I am providing a link to the talk as it appears in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=59242&st=&pgnum=508\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torat Menachem</a> for those who wish to read the Hebrew. A free translation into English follows:</p>\n<p>...that these concepts are clarified in the Chassidic discourses and a portion of them is collected in the book “Collected Discourses of the Tzemach Tzedek (that among them are also included discourses of the Mitteler Rebbe and the Alter Rebbe), and they are also the foundation to the discourses of our Rebbes, our Nasi’im who followed afterward, up to and including my honored and holy teacher and father-in-law, our lord, master and Rebbe, Nasi of our generation (meaning the generation of the current Rebbe who is speaking and all those included in his generation), that through careful review in these places clarification will be added in regard to what is spoken about above on the matter of the particular distinction of this year (1988) in regard to the aspect of “Give to a Wise Sage and he will become even wiser.”</p>\n<hr />\n<p>[<strong>Translator’s note:</strong> It should be pointed out that the two terms, Rebbe רבי and Nasi נשיא are not random, honorific expressions. They are specific abbreviations with precise intended meaning. Rebbe means: <em>Head of the Children of Israel</em> (ראש בני ישראל). Nasi means: <em>Spark of our Patriarch, Yaacov</em> (נצוץ של יעקב אבינו). These terms are applied and relate to stages of spiritual growth and maturity in a given individual. To put this in the context and language of the Mishnah (see for example Horayot 13a), it is the distinction between the Amarkol אמרכל and the Nasi associated with the Monarchy נשיא like Rambam states below. It should be noted that in the written Torah, the Amarkol is related to the <em>Nasi of each tribe</em>, while Moshe Rabbeinu, who is the idea of the Monarch over the whole nation, is referred to as Nasi.</p>\n<p>In keeping with what the Rebbe says about his father-in-law, the previous Rebbe, the expression <em>our lord, our master, our teacher</em> (אדונינו מורינו ורבינו) is associated with <strong>Nasi</strong>. And in that context, the words of Rambam from Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Shegagot, chapter 15, law 6 are relevant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the connotation of the term <strong>nasi</strong> used in the Torah? <strong>A king</strong> who is not under the jurisdiction of any other man in Israel. There is no one superior to him in his sovereignty except, G-d, his L-rd.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, a third term will shortly be introduced of King מלך which is an abbreviation for Brain (מוח), Heart (לב) Liver (כבד). That <strong>the Brain</strong> is the seat of the intellect and also the central junction through which all neural and lymphatic connections to the rest of the body pass. <strong>The Heart</strong> is the seat of character traits, emotion and temperament. It is also the central junction through which blood and all that it carries, nutrition, hormones, oxygen and electrolytes are pumped to the rest of the body. Finally, <strong>the Liver</strong> is the seat of the process of Tikkun, <em>Refinement</em>. It is the central junction of both the Endocrine (hormones) and Gastrointestinal (digestion) systems and is essential to the production of Bile.</p>\n<p>It is in this sense, that Rambam states (Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Melachim 3:6)  that the King is the heart of the entire nation. The life, health and growth of every aspect of the entire nation is dependant upon its connection with the King and vis-versa.]</p>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>And it is necessary to  add in regard to all that was mentioned above – in greater depth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>And with the introduction, in regard to the relationship between the people (the nation, meaning the Kings subjects) to the Nasi and King – 2 aspects are:</p>\n<p>On one hand – a movement of elevation and separation/distinction, from his shoulders and above, he is higher than the people (<em>a reference to the paradigm for Kingship established with the first King of Israel, Saul, who was head and shoulders taller than his countrymen</em>), People specifically, the term עם (people) also has a connotation linguistically in the sense of an inverse relationship (עוממות), that they (<em>the people</em>) are separate, strange and distant from the level of the King. And like is emphasized in regard to the concept of Fear and nullification of self-awareness (when in the presence of the King) – <em><strong>You will surely place above yourself, a King</strong></em>, that Awe of him is upon you.</p>\n<p>And on the other hand – Ultimate closeness, like it says, that <em>the King is the heart of the entire congregation of Israel</em>, and there is no greater closeness than the closeness of the heart to the limbs of the body.

    "content": "# Source for \"Adam Wanted to Taste the Food\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rav Dessler in Michtav m'Eliyahu 2 p146 & 149 quotes an unsourced chazal that Adam deep down \"wanted to taste the food\" (רצה לטעום התבשיל) ie tree of knowledge. Anyone know the source or something similar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>This is discussed in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=58836&st=&pgnum=102\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">פדה בשלום נפשי בס״ד י״ט כסלו עזר״ת</a>. This <em>ma'amar</em> goes through the difference between spiritual perception vs. physical sensation, and their connection to <em>da'at</em>. It explains that Adam already had the spiritual perception, but in א׳ he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>והחטא הי׳ שרצה בההרגשה דוקא</strong></p>\n<p><strong>But [Adam's] sin was that He wanted to <em>feel</em> it davka.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The context for the fruit is of course the materialised <em>physical</em> <strong>taste</strong>, which was his sin in the level of Asiya. As he explains, before the fruit, Adam only tasted the spiritual delight in the food he ate. This sinful desire for physical sensation wasn't just limited to fruit. As it is written in ב׳:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזה הי׳ חטא אדה״ר בעולם היצירה שרצה בהרגשתה אהבה כו׳</p>\n<p>This was Adam's sin in the world of Yetzirah: that he desired a\nperceptible love.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explains the difference between חסדים מכוסים ומגולים, hidden and revealed love, and how revealed love involves withdrawal of intellectual contemplation in the heart, and involves viewing the object of one's love as separate from oneself. This introduces the perceptible sensation of love, but also the possibility of loving someone or something else, and thus the concept of mixture of good and evil.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the bigger part of this <em>ma'amar</em> is to help us understand how <em>da'at</em> is the root of sensation, and its connection with mixtures of good and evil. Adam ate the fruit because he wanted to have this sensation, and this is not just limited to the taste of the fruit. This is all counted as a sin. All in all a fascinating deep <em>ma'amar</em>, hard to summarise in a few paragraphs.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>So, I believe that Rabbi Dessler got his source from this <em>ma'amar</em>, or a related one</strong>. At the very least, if the Rebbe Rashab learned this Chassidic teaching from a third source, via the Ba'al Shem Tov for instance, then that will be the source but there's no reason to doubt that R' Dessler learned Chabad sources - he was known for doing so. If all else fails, it meets the criteria of \"something similar\" 😊</p>\n<hr />\n<p>As for where the Rebbe Rashab claims his <em>mekor</em> in Chazal for this idea: when he begins discussing the idea that Adam wanted to <em>taste</em> the fruit, he says \"ובמארז״ל עה״ד תפוח הי׳\"...</p>\n<p>The problem is, such a source doesn't exist.</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://files.anash.org/uploads/2022/05/Meir-5.1.22.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> which explains why the Rebbe Rashab said this in the name of Chazal - see pg. 182:</p>\n<p>The Rebbe Rayatz notes that there is no such source, so suggests (in Sefer HaMa'amarim 5703) that his father took a statement about אתרוג from Midrash Rabba 15:3, but used the word תפוח when referring to it, <strong>because תפוח represents his seeing the אתרוג for its <em>physical sweetness</em>, rather than its spiritual sweetness</strong> (a  פרי עץ הדר; a <em>mitzva</em>).</p>\n<p>This derivation is based on a logic from a Tosfot in Shabbat 88a, ד\"ה פריו, regarding Shir HaShirim 2:3 (כתפוח בעצי היער) that explains how אתרוג and תפוח are connected, as well as the Tzemach Tzeddek's statement in Sefer HaChakira, 89b: שם תפוח אתרוג והוא עה\"ד טו\"ר, and more (see the PDF).</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>So, the <em>original mekor</em> for the idea is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.15.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabba 15:3</a></strong> [according to the Rebbe Rayatz's explanation of the Rebbe Rashab's statement]. The teaching itself is not recorded in Bereshit Rabbah explicitly, but unpacked by the Rebbe Rashab in full in the given <em>ma'amar</em>, in the classic Chassidic \"unpacking\" of a \"hint\" in Chazal. <strong>Zohar Vayechi 224b</strong> is also a part of the explanation of the connection between אתרוג and תפוח/spiritual sweetness and physical sweetness, but I haven't followed the trail that far yet. Either way, I think this is enough to answer the OP's search for a source.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I think I found the answer. It's not an actual Hazal but an implication from R. Dessler's understanding of another one.</p>\n<p>In Michtav m'Eliyahu 5 p321, R Dessler quotes the Medrash that Adam repented (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.22.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'reshit Rabbah 22:13</a>, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.8a.10\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zarah 8a</a>). He asks is so why did Adam still die if that was a punishment for eating? He then says that the repentance must be same way of sin.</p>\n<p>This implies Adam's repentance wasn't on the same level as the original sin. I understand this as \"Teshuva m'Yirah\" vs \"Teshuva m'Ahavah\" (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.86b.3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 86b</a>). Adam \"wanted to taste the food\" and only repented because he felt bad.</p>\n\n\n",

How such an international treaty is enforced in a space-faring society is unclear to me; the laws will likely change when it becomes a reality; which will, in turn, impact the halachic implications of the status of the Moon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'm no expert, but it might be relevant that anything above 10 tefachim is not considered a reshus harabim.</p>\n<p>Also, with regards to travel across techum on shabbos and such (which, for a new society in space, which doesn't have houses anywhere, would be relevant every shabbos), check out this article I found.

The laws of changing location as it\neffects blessings on food are complex indeed. You will need to spend\nsome time learning the subject in depth (there are some wonderful\nbooks in English, including \"The Halachos of Brochos\" by Rabbi\nBodner).</p>\n<p>Here are short answers for your particular questions – changing\nlocations from room to room inside one house is a matter of debate\namongst the early Rabbis. Because of this, one is well advised to have\nintent before saying a blessing that one intends to eat the food in\nall the rooms of the house. If such intent was in mind at the time of\nthe blessing, one can move from room to room freely, and no new\nblessing is needed. If one did not have such intent in mind, we nonetheless follow the opinion that no new blessing is needed. (See Biur\nHalacha 178,1 \"BeBeit Echad\").</p>\n<p>Moving from one side of a room to another, even in a very large hall,\ndoes not require a new blessing to be said. (See Shulchan Aruch\n178,1). This is true even if you cannot see your first location.</p>\n<p>The ability to see your first location outside of one building is also\na matter of debate. Because of this debate we try to avoid such\nsituations. However, if one did in fact, for example, leave the house\nto their yard from where one can still see the room they said the\nfirst bracha in, they should not say a new blessing. (The exemption is\nwhere there is a walkway or street between the two locations, when\neven if one can see the first location a new blessing is needed).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope this will be of some help to you.</p>\n\n\n",

It implies that it is not only His Will that we accept; <strong>it is <em>Him</em>, Himself, that we accept</strong> - the One Who Wills.</p>\n<p>His ultimate Will (which goes above and is the source of the desires to benefit creations<sup>2</sup>, to be known<sup>3</sup>, to be complete in action as well as potential<sup>4</sup>), i.e. His <em>Root</em> Desire, is to have a dwelling place in the lowest world, as is well known to those who study Chassidus. What is less well known, however, is that there is a root, even of this \"root\" Desire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שזהו מה שנתאווה הקב\"ה להיות לו ית' דירה בתחתונים,... הם בבחירה דוקא, וכן הוא גם ברצון\nהמוחלט, והחלטת הרצון היא ע\"י נשמות ישראל דוקא, להיותם מושרשים למעלה\nמבחי' הרצון – בבחי' בעל הרצון.</p>\n<p>God's desire to have a dwelling place in the lower worlds... these are\nmatters of free will, and so is the even this root desire. The\n<em><strong>root</strong></em> of the root desire is by the souls of Israel specifically, as they are rooted above the level of desire, i.e. in the level of the\nOne Who Wills.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To put it simply, if we say that His Desire is to get married and make a dwelling with Israel, it was Israel herself who gave Him this Desire, when He \"saw her\" for the first time<sup>5</sup>, so to speak. Or to put it romantically:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I never wanted to get married, and then I met you...\"<sup>6</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This means that Israel, His Beloved, is rooted right in His Very Self - the One Who Wills, Himself. The souls of Israel are rooted in His Essence on this level.

However, it requires some explanation as to why this inverted order, implying a commitment without being informed of the details, is so laudatory; and presuming that it is, one crown would appear sufficient, rather than two.</em></p>\n<p>\"<em>In explanation, the Beit HaLevi (in the introduction to his Responsa; in I, 6 of those Responsa; and in his commentary al haTorah) suggests that Na’aseh actually contains Nishma within it, as it would be impossible to perform the mitzvot without first learning their details. The greatness of stating Nishma after Na’aseh was that it indicated an acceptance of Torah study above and beyond that which was necessary to fufill the mitzvot. Thus, the phrase, which actually means “Nishma V’Na’aseh V’Nishma”, conveys two separate acceptances of the study of Torah: that which is practically necessary for observing the halakhah; and beyond that, study in and of itself, separate from any practical considerations. Hence, two crowns are appropriate: inverting the order of the words turned one acceptance into two. (The Bet HaLevi’s great-grandson, Rav Joseph B. Soloveichik, suggested a different explanation of the greatness of “Na’aseh V’Nishma”; see “Reflections of the Rav”.)</em>\"</p>\n<p><em>The Crowns of Torah</em> by Rabbi Yirmiyahu Ullman at <a href=\"https://ohr.edu/4159\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://ohr.edu/4159</a>   includes this passage:</p>\n<p>\"<em>The Talmud (Shabbat 88a) asserts that when the Jews unconditionally agreed to accept the Torah, preceding their commitment to observe before hearing the reasons and explanations for the commandments, G-d exclaimed, “Who revealed this secret to them, which only the ministering angels know?” And in the merit of this two-phrased, unconditional commitment, 600,000 angels descended from Heaven and conferred two crowns on the head of each Jew – one on account of “we shall observe” and one on account of “we shall hear”.</em>\"</p>\n<p>\"<em>Of course, these were not literal crowns, but special “spheres” of influence that enlightened their minds and enabled them to perceive the depths of the Torah.</em>\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Is a married rape victim to be put to death according to Deuteronomy 22:22?",
    "content": "# Is a married rape victim to be put to death according to Deuteronomy 22:22?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I asked this on the Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange, but I would also appreciate your input greatly.</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 22:22 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a man is found lying with the wife of another man, both of them shall die, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. So you shall purge the evil from Israel. (Deuteronomy 22:22, ESV)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does that mean, then, that Deuteronomy 22:22 implies that a married rape victim should be killed? I think that this question is relevant because there isn't anywhere else in the Torah that I know of that deals with the rape of a married woman.</p>\n<p>I have heard people try to use Deuteronomy 22:25 as proof that the rapist of both a married or an unmarried victim alike should be killed (and the woman not), but is this a valid interpretation? Deuteronomy 22:25 refers to a betrothed woman specifically. But, if it isn't valid, where can we find out what the punishment is for a man who rapes a married woman, and for a man who rapes an unmarried, unbetrothed, woman? And what should be done to her? I know some people will use Deuteronomy 22:28-29 in the case of the unbetrothed woman, but there is debate on whether this passage actually refers to rape or not.</p>\n<p>Is there anywhere else in the Tanakh that implies that the married woman is not considered to be an adulteress?</p>\n<p>What were the interpretations of this? Do we know how it was applied?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>(Usual disclosure -- Jews do not carry out the death penalty today!)</p>\n<p>Goodness no. That was talking about if she cheated of her own free will. Read it in context of the next few verses. (Please use a Jewish translation here. Have a look at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.22.23?ven=Metsudah_Chumash,_Metsudah_Publications,_2009&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>; though honestly, any translation is going to make this clear, if you look forward a few verses and think this through a bit.)</p>\n<p>Rape is covered a few verses later, very, very clearly. You wouldn't blame a murder victim, so why blame a rape victim?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if in the field the man encounters the married girl, and the man holds her and had intercourse with her; then he shall die—<strong>only the man who had intercourse with her.</strong> <strong>But to the girl you will not do a thing, the girl has no death liability; for, just as if a man rises up against his peer and murders him, so is this matter.</strong> For he encountered her in the field; the married girl screamed, but there was no one to rescue her.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If she cheated of her own free will, there are two slightly different cases. If she was still a virgin, but married (they used to do \"betrothal\" a few months before moving in together), then it's especially outrageous for her to have cheated, so the punishment is stoning:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If there will be a virgin girl married to a man, and a man encounters her in the city and has intercourse with her, You are to take them both out to the court of that city and stone them with stones to death, the girl <strong>for the fact that she did not scream in the city</strong> and the man for the fact that he oppressed the wife of his peer; and you will eliminate the evil within you.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"She didn't scream out\", i.e. she did it willingly.</p>\n<p>Verse 22 is a tangent off of that; if she cheated of her own free will but was had already moved in with her husband, it's still the death penalty, but the verse doesn't specify stoning. (The Talmud says it's strangulation instead, which was considered less severe than stoning.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a man is found having intercourse with a woman who is the wife of a man, even both of them shall die—the man who had intercourse with the woman and the woman—and you will eliminate the evil from Yisroel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the overall flow of the verses would then read:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<ol start=\"22\">\n<li>She cheated during full marriage -- strangulation for both of them.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>23--24. She cheated during betrothal -- stoning for both of them.</li>\n<li>25--27. She was raped? Kill the rapist, don't punish her at all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the last case gets the most verses; it's trying to really drive home that point that <strong>we do not blame rape victims!</strong></p>\n<p>(Yes, sometimes you have to scan the text forwards and backwards a bit to understand it properly.)</p>\n<p>If the Torah says <strong>don't blame a rape victim, just as you wouldn't blame a murder victim</strong> and gives that explicit reasoning, it would boggle the mind to claim that somehow if she was cohabitating with her husband that it would somehow be worse than if she was betrothed. (In fact, we can apply <em>a fortiori</em> logic: cheating during betrothal is considered <em>worse</em> than cheating during normal marriage. So if we don't blame her for being raped during betrothal, we certainly don't blame her for being raped during normal marriage.)</p>\n<p>This is how the Talmud and subsequent halachic codes read it, very, very clearly.</p>\n\n\n",

The correct explanation of na’aseh (let us make)\n[which is in the plural form when it should have been in the singular]\nis as follows: It has been shown to you that G-d created something\nfrom nothing only on the first day, and afterwards He formed and made\nthings from those created elements. Thus when He gave the waters the\npower of bringing forth a living soul, the command concerning them was\nLet the waters swarm. The command concerning cattle was Let the earth\nbring forth. But in the case of man He said, Let us make, that is, I\nand the aforementioned earth, let us make man, the earth to bring\nforth the body from its elements as it did with cattle and beasts, as\nit is written, And the Eternal G-d formed man of the dust of the\nground, and He, blessed be He, to give the spirit from His mouth, the\nSupreme One, as it is written, And He breathed into his nostrils the\nbreath of life. And He said, In our image, and after our likeness, as\nman will then be similar to both. In the capacity of his body, he will\nbe similar to the earth from which he was taken, and in spirit he will\nbe similar to the higher beings, because it [the spirit] is not a body\nand will not die. In the second verse, He says, In the image of G-d He\ncreated him, in order to relate the distinction by which man is\ndistinguished from the rest of created beings. The explanation of this\nverse I have found ascribed to Rabbi Joseph the Kimchite, and is the\nmost acceptable of all interpretations that have been advanced\nconcerning it. The meaning of tzelem is as the word to’ar\n(appearance), as in ‘Vetzelem’ (And the appearance) of his face was\nchanged; similarly, Surely ‘b’tzelem’ (as a mere appearance) man\nwalketh; When Thou arousest Thyself ‘tzalmam’ (their appearance) Thou\nwilt despise, that is, the appearance of their countenance. And the\nmeaning of the word d’muth is similarity in form and deed, as things\nthat are akin in a certain matter are called similar to each other.\nThus man is similar both to the lower and higher beings in appearance\nand honor, as it is written, And Thou hast crowned him with glory and\nhonor, meaning that the goal before him is wisdom, knowledge, and\nskill of deed. In real likeness his body thus compares to the earth\nwhile his soul is similar to the higher beings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also view Ramban to verse 21 where he explains why the great sea creatures also needed to be created from nought and not formed like the rest of creation.</p>\n<p>To summarize, the Ramban seems to hold that ברא does mean create from nothing in all cases. However by man, there are two parts - the soul was created from nothing while the body was formed from the ground. This is unique to man because as the Ramban explains, man has a a soul above all other creations which is why it did not need to state ברא by any other creation (for the soul aspect). And it is not contradictory to the great sea creatures because their having being created from nothing was for their physical body (as Ramban explains why specifically them and not all other creations), while man’s having being created from nothing is for the soul, whereas the body of man was formed from the ground.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>B\"H</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://he.m.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%91%22%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%90_%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban to Bereishis 1:1</a> explicitly says that the word \"Bara\" is the only word that can be used in the Hebrew language to describe creation from complete and absolute nothing, and that at first Hashem created the \"initial matter\", and all other creations were only \"formed\" from that matter.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הקב\"ה ברא כל הנבראים מאפיסה מוחלטת. ואין אצלנו בלשון הקדש בהוצאת היש\nמאין אלא לשון \"ברא\"; ואין כל ה\"נעשה\" – תחת השמש או למעלה – הווה מן\nהאין התחלה ראשונה. אבל הוציא מן האפס הגמור המוחלט יסוד דק מאד, אין בו\nממש, אבל הוא כוח ממציא, מוכן לקבל הצורה ולצאת מן הכוח אל הפועל. והוא\nהחומר הראשון, נקרא ליוונים \"היולי\". ואחר ההיולי לא ברא דבר, אבל יצר\nועשה, כי ממנו המציא הכל והלביש הצורות ותיקן אותן.</p>\n<p>The Holy One, Blessed be He, created all creations from absolute\nnothingness. In our Holy Tongue, there is no term for bringing\nexistence out of nothingness other than the term \"bara\" (created). And\nnothing that is made—whether under the sun or above—comes into being\nfrom nothing as a first beginning. Rather, He brought forth from\ncomplete and absolute nothingness a very fine essence, which has no\nsubstance but is a generative force, ready to receive form and\ntransition from potential to actual. This is the primordial matter,\nknown to the Greeks as \"hyle.\" After the creation of the hyle, He did\nnot create anything anew, but rather formed and made, for from it He\nbrought forth everything, clothed them in forms, and perfected them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In orthodox shuls I regularly see boys (even under barmitzvah) reciting Anim Zemirot (this is common). I have seen children lead pesukei d'zimra on shabbat in sephardi minyanim, where they tend to recite paragraphs out loud and the children, as a result, have a good grasp of דיוק מילים. I have also seen children leading אין כאלוהינו at the end of Shabbat shacharit.</p>\n<p>What are the halachic grounds for allowing boys under the age of barmitzvah to lead Kabbalat Shabbat?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>R.

Concerning that light our sages have said that it preceded the first directive of G’d in the Book of Genesis, i.e. “let there be light.” This light which was employed as a tool in G’d’s work of creation is known as ראשית. Moses attained this light in his heart, and it was this light which separated him from all other prophets making him superior to all of them.\nThe light which emerges out of darkness is the essence of fire, it is known as אור מוגרש, ”light which has been expelled.” This is the light which was applied to Moses, the light which is here called as radiating from the face of Moses. He acquired this ability to radiate light as a result of obtaining the second set of Tablets whereas he had not achieved this ability when he received the first set of Tablets when he was described as “turning and descending from the mountain” (32,15). During the period when the first set of Tablets was being prepared the people had still been under the spiritually uplifting experience of the revelation, everyone of them having been a party to insights never before granted to man. Now that they were no longer on that spiritual level and G’d had even warned them that “no one will ascend (spiritually) with you” (34,3), they would not have credited Moses with continuing to be on such a level had there not been some visible evidence of that. G’d provided this when he made Moses’ skin emit rays of light.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Likewise during the initial days of Nissan we do not say tachanun when the heads of the tribes brought their sacrifices and those exact ones were not brought again.</p>\n<p>Likewise we learn from shavuos many of the customs that apply to marriage. And this the days days of tachanun are the 7 days of blessing after the Jewish people were so to speak married to Hashem by accepting the Torah. Likewise we skip tachanun during the week of sheva brachos. Calling a shavuos a marriage and learning customs for marriage from it is brought down by Rabbi Samson ben Tzadok, student of Maharam of Rothenberg, in his sefer Tashbatz Katan #464, 5.</p>\n\n\n",

It is codified by Rif (Shabbos 44b and Beitzah 8b), Rosh (Shabbos 16:5, Beitzah 2:4), Tur (OC 242, 419) - right down to Mishneh Berurah (242:4).</p>\n<p>Rashi (Beitzah 16a) limits this guarantee to standard expenses - 'לפי מה שרגיל ממציאים לו'. This implies that exaggerated expenses that are beyond his regular standard of living are not included.</p>\n<p>The position of many poskim* extend this to include all Shabbos expenses - not just food, but also special Shabbos clothing, generators <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18413/is-one-allowed-to-use-electricity-on-shabbos-in-israel\">for those who don't use electricity in Israel powered by Jews</a>, Eruvin, tableware. Some (see Rivevos Efrayim V6 56:6) even include trips taken over Shabbos.</p>\n<p>There is a minor discussion whether Melave Demalka expenses are included; R' Moshe Shternbuch believed that they are, whereas R' Ahron Leib Shteinman (Ayeles Hashachar Shabbos 119) and R' Chaim Kanievsky were unsure.</p>\n<p>R' Chaim Kanievsky cautioned to be honest when purchasing - is the purchase actually to honour Shabbos, or just self indulgence?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>*Partial list: R' Shlomo Zalman Aurebach (Shulchan Shlomo 529 n4), Rivevos Efrayim (V1 181), R' Elyashiv (cited in Ashrei Haish), R' Nissim Karelitz (Chut Hashani 1:2), R' Chaim Kanievsky (cited by numerous publication; eg אליבא דהילכתא גליון מ\"א). The only dissenting view I found was Mishnas Yosef, who limits this to food only.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This a partial answer</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it is halacha Lemaaseh, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.242.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 242:3 and 4</a> and the Shaar Hatziyun there. The M\"B quotes the Gemara. He even goes as far as bringing the Gr\"a that even borrowing for the purpose of being mechabed Shabbat is allowed, even if the borrower doesn't know how he will repay it.</li>\n<li>Should he spend on items he cannot affors. Based on the Gr\"a mentioned previoulsy yes. The Dirshu Mishna Berura brings Rabbi Nissim Karelitz Zatza\"l that this should only be done by someone who has that level of Bitachon to rely on the words of the gemara, otherwise he should spend within his means.</li>\n<li>Is it only for food - The gemara makes no mention of food items. To the contrary it is brought together with expenses for teaching ones sons Torah, which are unrelated to food. This implies that the Braysa means any type of expense that can be attributed as being made for Kavod Shabbat.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n",

Say to them:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, what if the Kohen dislikes one of the congregants? must he not do Birkat Kohanim given that he cannot bless that person \"with love\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Indeed, Mishna Berurah (on O\"C 128:10) says not to do it in such a case and associates it with the language of the bracha:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כהן שהצבור שונאים אותו או הוא שונא את הצבור, סכנה הוא לכהן אם ישא כפיו\n(ולכן יצא מביהכ\"נ קודם רצה אם אינו יכול לכוף את יצרו ולהסיר השנאה\nמלבו) <strong>וע\"ז תקנו בברכה לברך את עמו ישראל באהבה</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Magen Avraham (ibid., 11) makes the same association and attributes the rule to Zohar (147b), which reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל כהן דהוא לא רחים לעמא או עמא לא רחמין ליה לא יפרוס ידוי לברכא לעמא\nדכתיב טוב עין הוא יבורך אל תקרי יבורך אלא יברך</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>What is the reason for saying the word באהבה (with love), given that the Torah only commands to bless the Jews without explicitly mentioning that it be done \"באהבה\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the sefer Peninei MiShulchan HaGavoah (Parshas Naso, p. 46), it shares the chiddush of Rabbi Aharon Volkin, the author of the Beis Aharon. He quotes a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.38b.3?lang=bi&with=Chidushei%20Agadot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maharsha on Sotah 38b</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] and therefore blessing should only be given to someone who has a good\n(generous) eye, because the potency of  blessing is dependent upon the\nintention of the one who blesses.  This is the meaning of the blessing\nof the priests who bless the Jewish people \"with love\" - which means\nwith a generous intention and goodwill.  (The host receives this\nblessing) because he gave of his food with a good will to the poor.\nHe doesn't give inferior bread to the poor but good bread for himself\nrather he gives the poor of his own bread according to what he has.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Aharon Volkin says that this is the reason why the word \"with love\" is added. Because this is why the Levites were given this task, because they were the only ones that had tremendous Ahavas Yisroel, and in order for a bracha to be complete, the one that blesses, should have good intentions and love for the one to bless.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In order to merit Kabalas Haschina one has to be b'simcha. A Kohen cannot be b'simcha if he is upset with someone in the Kehillah. So they make the Brocho that Hashem commanded them to be loving toward all Jews, and thus b'simcha, so they can act as the conduit of blessings from Hashem.</p>\n<p>As to why the word is not included in the Torah, that is because we were dealing with Aharon Hakohen and his sons in Bamidabar 6:23. We all know that there was no greater Ohev Yisroel than Aharon, and by association his sons, so it was not necessary to specify B'Ahava.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/beVWc6Ur.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/beVWc6Ur.png\" alt=\"bracha\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

(Shulchan Aruch, Rama ibid.)</p>\n<p>When a farm that has non-kosher species provides milk for Jewish\nconsumption, there needs to be an on-site mashgiach who is able to\nwatch the milking at all times (although he can be yotzei v’nichnas,\nsporadically entering and leaving, and is not required to actually\nwatch the milking throughout). A farm that has only kosher animals\nneeds a mashgiach outside its entrance to prevent non-kosher milk or\nanimals from entering. Here also, the mashgiach need not be there at\nall times; yotzei v’nichnas supervision suffices. In all cases, the\nmashgiach must be present before the milking commences in order to\ncheck the milking equipment to ascertain that it has been cleansed of\nany residual unsupervised milk. (Remo ibid. and Shach s.k. 8)\nAdditionally, nearly all Poskim require the mashgiach to be present to\nobserve the beginning of the actual milking, even if there are no\nnon-kosher animals at the farm. (Remo ibid., Shach ibid. s.k. 5-6, Taz\nibid. s.k. 4, Chachmat Adam 67:1, Aruch HaShulchan 115:7)</p>\n<p>The Shach (ibid.) explains that our reliance on yotzei v’nichnas\nsupervision is based on the halachic principle of mirtat, which means\nthat the farmer is afraid to adulterate kosher milk with non-kosher\nmilk out of fear of being caught in the act by the mashgiach. Thus,\nspontaneous in-and-out supervision suffices.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

And since those who recite the blessing of יראו עינינו are maintaining a custom that they have observed, and they are correct in doing so because they end with a blessing, even if he is not praying with them, by being with them in the prayer, therefore he should respond Amen.\"</p>\n<p>Now although he was referring to Bnei Chutz laretz and not sefardim I think we can make the connection to sefardim, that if Jews in Eretz Yisrael who don't have a minhag to say יראו עינינו, say amen, then for sefardim as well who don't have the minhag also can answer amen.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>לע״ד it seems that according to Shulchan Aruch O.C Siman 236:2, there wouldn't be a problem/issur of saying יראו עינינו, and therefore no problem of answering amen as well.</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין לספר בין גאולה דערבית לתפלה ואף הנוהגין לומר י\"ח פסוקים ויראו עינינו אין להפסיק בין יראו עינינו לתפלה ומיהו מה שמכריז ש\"צ ר\"ח בין קדיש לתפלת ערבית לא הוי הפסק כיון שהוא צורך תפלה וכן יכול לומר ברכו להוציא מי שלא שמע ולא הוי הפסק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"One should not talk between the blessing about redemption (ge'ulah) in the evening and the Amidah; even those who routinely say 18 verses and \"yir'u eineinu\" should not pause between that paragraph and the Amidah. What about when the reader announces Rosh Chodesh [so people can remember to say ya'aleh ve'yavo] between Kaddish and the evening Amidah? This is not a pause, since it is a requirement for the Amidah; and thus, one could also say that Barchu, to exempt one who did not hear it, wouldn't be considered a hefsek either.\"</p>\n<p><strong>Edit: Recently I have received an answer from Rabbi Yonatan Nacson who said that he has confirmed with Hagoan HaRav Yitzchak Yosef and Hagoan Rav David Yosef that one can answer amen to יראו עינינו. However Rav Ovadia in Moar Yisrael Volume 1 page 7 did not answer amen when he was praying in a minyan that recited this berachah (on one of his trips to South America), since it is not an obligation to answer amen to this berachah, but one may answer if he wants to.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is there a source that names in the Torah may not be the person's actual name\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Some of the name given in the Torah are frequently explained by Chazal  to mean something about the person. For example the Gemorah (Sanhedrin 82B) says that the real name of Cozbi bas Tzur was Shevilnai bas Tzur. She was called Cozbi because she distorted . The Gemora continues to say similar things about Zimri and some of his names. It ends by saying that his name was  Shelumiel ben Tzurshadey but does not explicitly say that Zimri was <strong>not</strong> his name .</p>\n<p>Question is if there is any source that says that in general names in the Torah are possibly not the persons given name. Some of the names that evil people have in the Torah are very difficult to imagine that their parents called them by such a name at birth. Particularly after seeing what Chazal explain them to have meant</p>\n<p>Other than the Gemorah Sanhedrin mentioned above which is discussing specific people and explicitly says that Cozbi was not her real name is there any source that <strong>in general</strong> a name mentioned in the Torah may not be the persons actual name?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I don't know if there's a source. But sometimes it seems painful to accept the idea that the names are their actual names. For example, names in Ruth.</p>\n<p>Meanings of referenced names in the Book of Ruth</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Mahlon means \"sickness\" and Chilion \"wasting\", which, as is the common\ntheme throughout the scroll, aligns closely with the characters' roles\nin the relevant events.[2] According to some of modern scholarship,\nthis gives a consciously fairytale-like quality to the story.[3] It\nalso reflects the cultural norm pervasive in Tanakh of naming children\nbased on external events, such as Naomi changing her own name to Mara\n(“Call me Mara, because the Almighty has dealt quite bitterly with\nme.\"), Abram having his name changed to Abraham, Peleg (lit.\n\"division\") being named after the division of nations. Mahlon and\nChilion being born in a time of famine follows this trend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlon_and_Chilion\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahlon_and_Chilion</a></p>\n<p>In your opinion, how likely is it that parents would name their children Sickness and Wasting? I'm not saying those names couldn't have existed, we live in an age where people name their kids all sorts of things. But most Jews today are so careful to name their children just the right name, and make sure that it's positive and is filled with good intentions. And the Bible apparently shows a Judaism that names their children awful things which often depict their terrible fates; such as Sickly and Wasting dying. It's up to you to decide what to do with that contradiction.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Numerology in the Plagues\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Going over the plagues in Exodus, I notice a pattern. The first few plagues (blood, frogs, gnats / lice), are general afflictions that affect Egyptian and Hebrew alike. The next few plagues (flies, livestock, boils) affect everyone except the Hebrews - drawing a distinction between Egypt and God’s People. Then with the seventh plague (hail), this plague again only effected areas outside of Goshen (where the Hebrews live) BUT with the addition that those who believe God and do as instructed maybe spared (taking shelter along with one’s servants and animals).</p>\n<p>The final three plagues repeat this pattern: the plague of locusts is a general affliction, the plague of darkness only effects the Egyptians - setting the Hebrews apart, and the final plague of the death of the firstborns is a general affliction BUT with an escape for those who believe God and act as instructed (blood of the Passover lamb).</p>\n<p>Of course, there is one major distinction between the 7th and 10th plagues: in the 7th plague the Egyptians are informed how to be saved, while in the 10th this knowledge is only shared with the Hebrews by Moses (though there doesn’t appear to be any restriction from the Hebrews sharing this knowledge if they so chose with select Egyptians). Also - hypothetically Hebrews could have been afflicted as well. However, uncharacteristically, all of them obeyed this one time so that none were lost.</p>\n<p>Fittingly, there is a nice division between the first 7 plagues and the final 3 within the narrative. After the 7th plague, Pharaoh finally admits that he has sinned (“this time”) and asks for Moses to intercede for him and agrees to let the Hebrews go. A big turn around from the start of the narrative where he claims to not know the LORD and therefore would not let the people go!</p>\n<p>However, the LORD is not finished with them and so he hardens the hearts of Pharaoh and his officials that he might carry out the remaining judgements against Egypt.</p>\n<p>Now, I know that 3, 7, and 10 are all significant numerals in scripture- but I haven’t studied numerology much myself. But I’m wondering what - if any - significance there is in there being 10 plagues broken into sets of 7 and 3.</p>\n<p>Or, again, any potential significance in the first seven plagues being divided into sets of 3, 3, and 1.</p>\n<p>Any insights? :)</p>\n\n\n",

Chapter II), it marched in the rear so that if anyone of the other tribes lost anything, he (Dan) restored it to him. (מאסף לכל המחנת therefore means \"the one who gathered in everything belonging to all the camps\".) – There is one authority that holds that they traveled in formation like a box (i.e. in a military square) and derives this from the text, \"just as they encamp so shall they journey\" (Bemidbar 2:17), and there is another authority that maintains that they traveled in a straight line like a beam, and derives this from the statement that Dan was \"the gatherer of all the camps\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the cloud signaling when it was time to break camp (ibid 9:17) there were also multiple trumpet blows to signal to each degel specifically when it was actually time to hit the road (ibid 10:5-6) which was based upon the different degel quadrants etc departing consecutively vs concurrently (ibid 11-28).</p>\n<p>That makes sense if they traveled in line formation, however, if they traveled as they camped, then presumably they all stuck together and traveled as one, what does it mean that they traveled one after the other?</p>\n<p>Does it mean that they didn't fall into single file and stayed on the side they camped but didn't travel as they actually camped which was as a square?</p>\n\n\n",

From his point of view, complaints resulted from people's bad character traits and from being accustomed to Egyptian practices. Based on etymology of the word מתאננים, he concludes that complaints were an expression of personal desires. People express their desires constantly. The reason these desires did not enter the story of Miriam, is perhaps, there was nothing new in the complaints during these 7 days. I.e. these are parallel stories.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I just thought of an answer based on another post on this site.

They were in a climate-controlled cloud-enclosed environment. Food was heavenly and water was in abundance. Why would they want to decamp and travel to another location - it's not like they were rushing to get anywhere. (Well, they were, but they had a 40-year deadline and they couldn't arrive early.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Besides, the next location was also in the same \"hot desert\" - what do they gain by leaving 7 days earlier or later?</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, you added to the title:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>They complained about everything else?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Well, you seem to have found proof that they didn't complain about everything. I think that's an unfair accusation against our nation. (Considering you're discussing the Parsha of Miriam being punished for speaking against Moshe, you may want to edit that out.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# A difficulty in Parshat Behaalosecha chap. 11\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Rashi on Numbers 11:10 writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בכה למשפחתיו: משפחות משפחות נאספים ובוכים לפרסם תרעמתן בגלוי. ורבותינו\nאמרו (יומא ע\"ה) למשפחתיו, על עסקי משפחות —על עריות הנאסרות להם</p>\n<p>weeping with their families: Families gathered in groups weeping so as\nto publicize their grievance. Our Sages say that the meaning is:\n“concerning family matters,” that is, because intermarriage among\nfamily members was forbidden to them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If as Rashi says, what those people truly craved was forbidden sexual relations, how would stuffing them with quail meat satisfy them?</p>\n<p>Better to let them have a big orgy like at the golden calf, then slaughter them en masse as Korach and his followers were!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Gur Aryeh on this spot explains that this comment is to be understood as follows: the complaint about food was had an underlying component as well: too much focus on physical desires, which arayot often embodies. Thus, it is not saying the did not complain about food, but that the complaint also had an additional dimension. Further, Yoma 75a, the source of this idea, backs up the fact that this was meant as an additional layer of meaning and not to replace the primary meaning of wanting food.</p>\n<p>Yeriot Shlomo suggests two answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>That perhaps the connection is that the manna had a property that it diminished sexual desire, and that is why the complaint for food had this underlying latent meaning.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Arayot were more likely to occur in the field, where people would go to use the bathroom. Since the manna was absorbed by the body, people lost their excuse to go to the field alone.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Further, if we look in Bamidbar Rabbah and Tanchuma, the idea is fleshed out further. The motivation behind this interpretation is that it seems ludicrous to request food when they had animals, and the Manna was reportedly delicious. Thus, the opinion makes a play on words: basar, flesh, can also mean flesh of erva. This additional information suggests another possibility: since their illicit desire was about basar, they were thus punished with basar, albeit of a different form.</p>\n\n\n",

Copying copyrighted material for commercial use is absolutely forbidden.[1]\n\n2.  It is forbidden to buy pirated or illegal software.[2]\n\nFor Personal Use\n1.  Many poskim hold that it is stealing to copy someone else’s intellectual property or copyrighted material.[3] Accordingly, it is forbidden even for personal use.[4] Many other poskim hold that it isn’t actual stealing since intellectual property isn’t something tangible. Rather it is forbidden to commercial violate a copyright but for personal use it would be permitted to copy a small portion of something copyrighted.[5] Within the approach that permits copying for personal use the poskim qualify that it is only permitted to copy small portion such that a person wouldn't have anyway bought the book for that portion. But if copying portions prevents a person from buying the book it is forbidden.[6]\n\nThere are some poskim who are more inclined to allow copying small selections for personal or educational purposes if the material is Torah.[7]\n\n2.  It is a pious practice never to violate the wishes of the copyright holder.[8]\n3.  Some poskim write that a person may not violate a copyright because of chilul Hashem, desecration of God's name.[9] Otherwise disagree.[10]\n4.  Some poskim write that a person must pay for the right to copy copyrighted material otherwise it is considered benefiting from someone else’s property.[11] But others disagree since once one bought the book it is completely his.[12]\n</code></pre>\n<p>In summary, it is potentially against halacha to copy someone's content where the content owner has made it clear that it is not public domain content.

My question is; does he mean that he is not yotzie even on a biblical level? Or that since many rishonim say kiddush on a biblical level need be only \"words\", its only the rabbinic level of kiddush that he is missing. [Nafka mina would be regarding discharging someone else's obligation]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>It is a machlokes Rishonim if Kiddush Bemakom Seuda is rabbinic or mideorayta.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_on_Pesachim.10.5.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Pesachim perek Arvei Peaschim end of siman ב</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומהשתא הוי ברכה לבטלה אם אין שם אורחין <strong>וה\"ר יונה פירש דאינה ברכה לבטלה דהא דאמרינן דאין קידוש אלא במקום סעודה היינו מדרבנן</strong> ואסמכוה רבנן אקראי וקראת לשבת עונג. ועיקר הקידוש מן התורה הוא כדכתיב זכרהו על היין בכניסה. הלכך כיון שיש בני אדם שאינם יודעים לקדש נהגו לקדש בבית הכנסת כדי שיצאו ידי קידוש מן התורה.  <strong>והא דקאמר אין קידוש אלא במקום סעודה לא משמע כפירושו דמשמע שאינו קידוש כלל.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rosh brings Rebbeinu Yonah who rules that Kiddush Bemakom Seuda is Miderabana, but the Rosh Argues and rules that it is modeorayta. Rabbeinu Yonah's argument is that it must be miderabanan given that we make kiddush in synagogue@ (at least there was such a custom , today it's uncommon) despite no one eating in shul. If makom seuda were a deorayta , then the bracha would be considered to be said in vain. Per the Rosh, making kiddush in shul without anyone eating there shouldn't not be allowed (although, see below)</p>\n<p>We can prove the shulachan Aruch's opinion based on his reasoning in SA OC 269 why we make kiddush in shul even though no one eats there.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נוהגין לקדש בבהכ\"נ. ואין למקדש לטעום מיין הקידוש אלא מטעימו לקטן דאין קידוש אלא במקום סעודה  (וע\"ל סי' רע\"ג)  ומעיקרא לא נתקן אלא בשביל אורחים דאכלי ושתי בבי כנישתא להוציאם י\"ח ועכשיו אע\"ג דלא אכלי אורחים בבי כנישתא לא בטלה התקנה זהו טעם המקומו' שנהגו לקדש בבהכ\"נ אבל יותר טוב להנהיג שלא לקדש בבהכ\"נ וכן מנהג א\"י: הגה ונהגו לעמוד בשעה שמקדשין בבהכ\"נ:</p>\n<p>It is the custom to recite Kiddush in the synagogue. The one who recites should not taste the wine of Kiddush but gives it to a minor to taste because Kiddush should be recited only at the place where the meal is eaten. From the outset this was ordained only for the sake of [communal] guests who eat and drink in the synagogue, so that they may fulfill their obligation. And today, even though [communal] guests do not eat and drink in the synagogue, the ordinance is not void. That is the reason of those places who still recite Kiddush in the synagogue. But it is better to ordain NOT to recite Kiddush in the synagogue, and such is the custom in the Land of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The reason the SA provides \"the ordinance is not void\" for allowing to make kiddush in a synagogue without guest eating there, is how the rishonim explain that the one can rule like the Rosh and still make kiddush in a synagogue in which no one will eat after kiddush.\n<strong>This proves the the SA rule like the Rosh that kiddush bemakom seuda is deorayta</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Here is the order\nof precedence: (a) Wine (or grape juice) (b) Challah: One first washes\nand then holds the two challahs in his two hands for the entire\nKiddush. In Kiddush he replaces the blessing “borei pri hagefen” with\n“ha’motzi lechem min ha’aratez.” (c) Chamar Medina: This literally\nmeans “the wine of the country.” It refers to any beverage which is\nconsidered important locally. There are a wide range of opinions\nregarding what drinks fulfill this definition. In virtually all\nWestern countries, beer and hard liquor (e.g. whiskey, scotch)\ndefinitely rate. If you are uncomfortable with those, tea or coffee\nare also acceptable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em><strong>(This final choice of chamar medina would not normally be relevant on Friday night, for a person who can neither have wine or bread will\nnot be able to have a \"meal\" in its technical sense, and so will not\nbe obligated in Kiddush.)</strong></em> On Shabbat morning, Kiddush fulfills a\ndifferent purpose. It is not to remember the Sabbath, as that is done\nat the start of the day. Rather, it is a means of lending importance\nto the Shabbat meal. This is done by beginning it with a special\ndrink. As on Friday night, the drink which would lend the most\nimportance to the meal is wine. But if that is not feasible, <em>Chamar\nMedina</em> may be used.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(Or as Avraham Fried phrased it, <a href=\"https://mostlymusic.com/products/no-jew-will-be-left-behind-cd\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">No Jew Will Be Left Behind</a>.) Indeed it's one of the central distinctions between the redemption from Egypt and the coming redemption. In that vein, the Rebbe reads the rebuke of the Haggadah to the Wicked Son, \"if you were <em>there</em> you would not have been redeemed\" as implying that in the future redemption, he <em>will</em> be redeemed.</p>\n<p>I don't know if the Rebbe directly addressed this Hayom Yom, but it could hardly have escaped his notice, considering he compiled it. I think it needs to be read as a hypothetical alternative, as opposed to an actual possibility. Sort of like how \"don't touch that power line if you value your life\" should be understood to be ruling it out as a reasonable possibility. This can also be inferred from the continuation of the original letter excerpted in Hayom Yom:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי ח\"ו וח\"ו שום איש ואשה בישראל לא יחפוץ להיות כמו אלו שמתו בשלשת ימי\nהאפלה במצרים לפי שלא האמינו בגאולה, ובודאי כי כל החי בישראל, בין איש\nובין אשה מאמין בביאת גואל צדק, לכן כאשר יעוררו אותם יתעוררו בתשובה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the editions with explanatory footnotes, it emphasizes  for the 18th of Sivan that this was relevant to the time of \"the Heels of Moshiach\".</p>\n<p>That implies that after that time period, meaning like today, the possibility for variations in the final redemption are past. That HaYom Yom was published in 5703-4, prior to the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which signaled a different tekufah in regard to Moshiach and the final redemption.</p>\n<p>It also says that the idea relates to the concept of Teshuvah like explained in Mishneh Torah Hilchot Teshuvah, meaning that because all Israel are a part of the whole, and the judgement for meriting redemption is on the whole, when we reach a simple majority of merit in regard to the individuals 51%, those who may have been judged as not meriting redemption are converted to merit like Rambam explains.</p>\n<p>So the focus was on attaining the simple majority of individuals (כל אחד מישראל) to merit redemption for the whole nation, meaning כלל ישראל. No one gets left out.</p>\n<p>It also is focusing on the concept of how quickly everyone will be redeemed. That at that time, it was possible for the redemption to be faster or slower, even in a matter of only a few days.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rambam doesn't say it. Sanhedrin 57a even says a Jew who kills a gentile is exempt. The posuk that prohibits murder, Genesis 9:6, even uses the verbiage of Adam, which suggests the prohibition is to murder limits to Jews. It looks like the only prohibition for killing non-Jews is the government and the laws of the land. Otherwise it would be to keep the peace so that Jews aren't harmed. But a primary prohibition of killing gentiles? Non-existent. Please show me otherwise.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Mishna Sanehdrin 4:5 refers to HaAdam as Jews - \"Therefore, Adam the first man was created alone, to teach you that with regard to anyone who destroys one soul from the Jewish people, i.e., kills one Jew, the verse ascribes him blame as if he destroyed an entire world, as Adam was one person, from whom the population of an entire world came forth.

According to the Hebrew Bible, Adam is a placeholder for \"first man\" or \"mankind.\" This law is a Noahide law which means they are binding on ALL of mankind. We have no evidence from the Torah that God ever intended to replace the Noahide law with another law-system. So if the Torah had not been given, all of the tribes would follow Noahide laws. But since you asked about the Talmud,the Talmud itself even brings down that God made everyone descend from Adam for various moral reasons:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"It was for this reason that man was first created as one person\n[Adam], to teach you that anyone who destroys a life is considered by\nScripture to have destroyed an entire world; and anyone who saves a\nlife is as if he saved an entire world.\" And also, to promote peace\namong the creations, that no man would say to his friend, \"My\nancestors are greater than yours.\" And also, so that heretics will not\nsay, \"there are many rulers up in Heaven.\" And also, to express the\ngrandeur of The Holy One [blessed be He]: For a man strikes many coins\nfrom the same die, and all the coins are alike. But the King, the King\nof Kings, The Holy One [blessed be He] strikes every man from the die\nof the First Man, and yet no man is quite like his friend. Therefore,\nevery person must say, “For my sake ‎the world was created.”‎</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: Sanhedrin 5:4 <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/74049/anyone-who-saves-a-life-is-as-if-he-saved-an-entire-world-jewish-life-or-any\">\"Anyone who saves a life is as if he saved an entire world\": Jewish life or any life?</a></p>\n<p>Please note that the above source is Sanhedrin 5:4. Some manuscripts quote the Mishnah as having \"saved one Israelite soul,\" but if you follow the link you will see this is unlikely to be the original version. The Talmud and Bible doesn't shy away from presenting a universal message, but they spend most of their time dealing with specific Israelite matters. Also the moral message of our tradition can sometimes diverge from our legal tradition.</p>\n<p>Sometimes a section Talmud may consider Adam to be specific to Jews (Yevamot 61), but other times it's obvious Adam is being used universally like in Sanhedrin 4:5. Both are true depending on the lens you are currently looking through. Another example is in the 10 commandments, the vast majority of the commentators explain that all the laws there mean for Jews only, and that \"your neighbor\" means your fellow Israelites. But if you ask if it's okay for a Jew to covet his gentile neighbors wife any religious Jew with any convictions will say no and reference the 10 commandments.</p>\n<p>The Bible's moral message is clear. Anyone who murders another human will have their blood shed, whether by man's court, animal's court, or God's court. We Jews learn not to murder any human from this verse. Whether or not a later Talmudic court feels they have the authority to give the death penalty over different types of murder is a separate issue.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Please provide one Halachic or other source from the Torah that prohibits Jews killing gentiles.

Similarly, a non-Jewish court is not obligated to give the death penalty to a non-Jew who kills a Jew. Murder is still 100% prohibited in both cases. In general the question  seem to be confusing lack of the death penally with permissiblity</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The posuk that prohibits murder, Genesis 9:6, even uses the verbiage of Adam, which suggests the prohibition is to murder limits to Jews.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Pretty off base assumption considering that this posuk  is actually (also) addressed to non-Jews (as per the very Gemora quoted above) . There were no Jews at the time. The  posuk  in the Torah that prohibits murder for Jews is   לֹא  תִרְצָח.</p>\n<p>Not only that this is quoting the verse incorrectly in relation to a crucial point. It says  הָֽאָדָ֗ם both times it mentions Adam. While there is discussion in the Risonim about when the Torah says  Adam it only means Jews and when it doesn't , everyone agrees that when is says HaAdam with a Hey preceding the word it means all of mankind and is <strong>not</strong> limited to Jews.

It is derived from a commentary on Exodus (20:14), ‘when one party schemes against another and kills through treachery, you shall take that person from My very altar to be put to death.’ The Mechilta, Nezikin (4:18) says that “אִישׁ”, ish, man, refers to gentiles. Therefore, premeditated murder of gentiles is directly prohibited by the Torah. Such sins warrant death which cannot be overridden by the pursuit of a positive commandment, if one even exists in such a case.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Hordus' (Herod) demolishing of the Bais Hamikdash prior to rebuilding it\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.3b.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 3b</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַב חִסְדָּא: לֹא לִיסְתּוֹר אִינִישׁ בֵּי כְנִישְׁתָּא, עַד דְּבָנֵי בֵּי כְנִישְׁתָּא אַחֲרִיתִי\n§ Rav Ḥisda says: A person may not demolish a synagogue until he first builds another synagogue</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A bit later the Gemara asks</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וּבָבָא בֶּן בּוּטָא, הֵיכִי אַסְּבֵיהּ לֵיהּ עֵצָה לְהוֹרְדוֹס לְמִיסְתְּרֵיהּ לְבֵית הַמִּקְדָּשׁ? וְהָאָמַר רַב חִסְדָּא: לָא לִיסְתּוֹר אִינִישׁ בֵּי כְנִישְׁתָּא עַד דְּבָנֵי בֵּי כְנִישְׁתָּא אַחְרִיתָא! אִי בָּעֵית אֵימָא: תִּיוְהָא חֲזָא בֵּיהּ, אִיבָּעֵית אֵימָא: מַלְכוּתָא שָׁאנֵי, דְּלָא הָדְרָא בֵּיהּ; דְּאָמַר שְׁמוּאֵל, אִי אָמַר מַלְכוּתָא: ״עָקַרְנָא טוּרֵי״ – עָקַר טוּרֵי וְלָא הָדַר בֵּיהּ.\nThe Gemara asks: How could Bava ben Buta have advised Herod to raze the Temple and build another in its place, as will be described later? But doesn’t Rav Ḥisda say that a person must not demolish a synagogue unless he first builds another synagogue to take its place? The Gemara answers: If you wish, say that he saw cracks in the old Temple structure. And if you wish, say that actions taken by the government are different, as the government does not go back on its decisions. Therefore, there is no need to be concerned about negligence, as there is in the case of ordinary people. As Shmuel says: If the government says it will uproot mountains, it will uproot mountains and not retract</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why couldn't the gemara answer that Rav Chisda's halacha only applies to a synagogue,  as you can build another synagogue elsewhere before demolishing the current one. Given that by the Bais Hamikdash this is impossible, as the new one needs to be build on the same plot the old one is build on, Bava ben Buta was able to advise Hordus to destroy it prior to building the new one?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a great question, although it isn't addressed by many commentators. The only person I found who discussed this was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mattityahu_Strashun\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Mattityahu Strashun</a> (son of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Strashun\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rashash</a>), in his notes on Baba Basra.

Considering that there is a problem to rebuild without first establishing a replacement, although that <em>prohibition</em> may not apply to Beis Hamikdash where establishing a replacement is impossible, the <em>concern</em> is equally relevant, and therefore refurbishing the Beis Hamikdash should not be done without a pressing need.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why are married couples not allowed to touch during niddah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let me start by saying that I understand the general rules of niddah. However, I was initially very confused why the niddah period is still observed at all, even among Orthodox Jews, since the other forms of purity and impurity are no longer upheld. According to this article, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/3709899/jewish/Why-Is-Impurity-Not-Observed.htm#footnoteRef5a3709899\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Why Is Impurity Not Observed?</a>, niddah seems to be the only purity rule that matters anymore to everyday folks.</p>\n<p>I did find a reason why men cannot have sex with a woman in niddah.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Avram Israel Reisner says in \"Observing Niddah in Our Day: An Inquiry on the Status of Purity and the Prohibition of Sexual Activity with a Menstruant:\"</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>With regard to sexual relations with a woman during her menses, the question to be investigated is, given that a\nmenstruant cannot now defile non-existent sancta, is the ban on sexual relations with a menstruant still in force?\nPlainly, the answer to that question must be yes, for the Torah clearly prohibits cohabitation with a woman during her\nmenses as a category of illicit sexual relations, without reference to matters of purity, in two separate verses, Vayikra 18.19 and 20.18.15</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And this makes perfect sense. However, both of these verses refer just to sex.</p>\n<p>Leviticus 18:19</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not approach a woman to have sexual relations during the uncleanness of her monthly period.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Leviticus 20:18</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a man has sexual relations with a woman during her monthly period, he has exposed the source of her flow, and she has also uncovered it.

For example, we have the contextual form (the opposite of a pausal form) שָׁמְרוּ (with accent on the last syllable, eg. Gen 18:19) versus the pausal form שָׁמָרוּ (with accent on the penultimate syllable, eg. Gen 41:35).</p>\n<p>From a historical linguistics point of view, the pausal forms generally preserve an older structure of the word than the contextual form. In the example of שמרו, we know (from comparison to other Semitic languages, as well as internal-to-Hebrew arguments) that the older form is *<em>shamárū</em> (the * represents reconstructed forms), with short <em>a</em> vowels. The word underwent <em>pretonic lengthening</em>, in which the vowel before the stress was lengthened, so we have *<em>shāmárū</em>. In pause, we get <em>pausal lengthening</em> (which is a lengthening of the stress vowel for rhetorical purposes/better pronunciation/etc.), so we have the pausal form <em>shāmā́rū</em>. However, in context, the second vowel remained short, and the accent eventually shifted to the last syllable, *<em>shāmarū́</em>, and then the short (now-)unaccented middle vowel was reduced to a <em>shewa</em>, so we get <em>shāmərū́</em> (this stress shift mainly occurred with either two successive closed syllables, or two successive open syllables with a short penultimate vowel, hence <em>shāmā́rū</em> was unaffected).</p>\n<p><strong>Back to your question:</strong></p>\n<p>To understand which words exhibit a <em>qamats</em> ā in pause but not in context, we have to understand what has happened to older <em>a</em> vowels throughout the history of (proto-)Hebrew. Here are some of the main cases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One simple case is that the <em>a</em> vowel remained as a short <em>pataḥ</em>, and in pause, it gets lengthened to <em>qamats</em>. For example, שָׁמַר comes from *<em>shamára</em> > *<em>shāmára</em> (pretonic lengthening) > <em>shāmár</em> (dropping final short vowels), in context (eg. Gen 37:11). The pausal form exhibits pausal lengthening, so we get <em>shāmā́r</em> שָׁמָר, in pause (eg. Hos 12:13).</li>\n<li>Another possibility, as above, is that the <em>a</em> vowel was reduced to a <em>shewa</em>, but is reappears in pause (or rather, it was never reduced in pause).</li>\n<li>Words that were originally *<em>CaCC</em> (where C is a consonant) usually become segolates <em>CeCeC</em>. For example, כֶּלֶב (eg. Psa 59:7) derives from *<em>kalb</em> by way of an <em>anaptyctic vowel</em> (a vowel added to help pronunciation) to *<em>káleb</em>, and then by vowel assimilation to *<em>kéleb</em> (eventually, also, the <em>b</em> becomes spirantized to <em>v</em>). However, in pause, the <em>a</em> vowel was lengthened (pausal lengthening) to give <em>kā́leb</em>, and long <em>a</em> vowels are strong enough not to assimilate to the following <em>e</em> vowel, so we get pausal form כָּלֶב (eg. Prov 26:17). Note that segolates of this nature might look slightly different, like סֶלַע (due to the influence of the gutteral <em>ʿayin</em>). This includes a word like שֶׁבַע, which looks like it has an original <em>i</em> vowel (with masculine form שִׁבְעָה), but the apparent <em>i</em> vowel is from <em>attenuation</em> (where <em>a</em> vowels in closed unstressed syllables become <em>i</em>; compare the usual כִּבְשָׂה to the unusual unattenuated כַבְשָׂה in Lev 14:10, Num 6:14).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, not all segolates derive from an older <em>a</em> vowel. For example, צֶדֶק derives from *<em>ṣidq</em>, and so in pause we don't get a <em>qamats</em> (eg. Psa 119:172). Internal evidence to the <em>i</em> vowel is often found by looking at the construct form, and here we have <em>ṣidqō</em> צִדְקוֹ (eg. Isa 42:21). Other words that you might think have an <em>a</em> vowel reflect other vowel shifts, and historically derive from an <em>i</em> vowel. For example, מֶלֶךְ remains a segolate in pause (eg. Gen 14:17), even though the construct from has an <em>a</em> vowel in <em>malkō</em> מַלְכּוֹ (eg. Num 24:7). However, מֶלְךְ actually derives from *<em>milk</em>, and the <em>a</em> vowel is due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippi%27s_law\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Phillipi's Law</em></a> — see more details about this vowel shift versus pausal lengthening <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/98964/4940\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>All said, the vowel signs you expect to \"become\" <em>qamats</em> in pause are <em>pataḥ</em>, <em>shewa</em>, and <em>segol</em> (I put \"become\" in quotation marks, because as we see above, the <em>a</em> vowel in pause is really more original than a <em>shewa</em> or <em>segol</em>, and it's only in the <em>pataḥ</em> case that we see pure pausal lengthening). For segolate nouns, you really have to know the original vowel of the word to hope to predict what will happen in pause.</p>\n<p>Extensive details can be found in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehoshua_Blau\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Dr. Joshua Blau</a>'s <em>Phonology and Morphology of Biblical Hebrew</em>, whence most of this information. This answer glosses over the difference between the quantitative difference between short and long <em>a</em> vowels and the qualitative difference between <em>pataḥ</em> and <em>qamats</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<ol>\n<li>See <a href=\"https://hebrew-academy.org.il/2013/10/21/%D7%A6%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A4%D7%A1%D7%A7-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%A9%D7%A8/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this</a> article- in short , in the Torah, whenever there is a מפסיק קיסרי (can maybe be translated  to large break or \"stopping\" cantillation) in the sentence some words will change a Segol to Kamatz. מפסיקים קיסרים are Etnachta and Sof Pasuk. This type of vowel change can also occur at other Mafsikim. I believe that by changing the vowel to a kamatz it forces a slowing down which in turn brings forth that this is where the sentence should have a comma or period.</li>\n<li>It is usually a segol (the even ezra-see below- also mentions Tzeirei as a changing vowel) that will change to a kamatz. but there are unexplained exceptions see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Exodus.5.7.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Ezra Shemos 5:7</a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ללבון מגזרת לבנה. ובנין הלבנים חזק מהאבנים כי בנין העפר יזיקהו המים ובנין האבנים יזיקהו האש וכן כתוב ותהי להם הלבנה לאבן והחמר היה להם לחמר. ודע כי יש שמות לא ישתנו ממעלתם באתנח או בסוף פסוק בבעלי קמץ קטן. כמו ספר. ובבעלי פתח קטן כמו צדק. והנה כן תבן וטעמה לא נודע רק ככה נמצאו:\nTO MAKE BRICK. Lilbon (to make brick) comes from the same root as levenah (brick). A brick structure is stronger than a stone structure, because a structure made out of soil will be damaged by water and a stone structure will be harmed by fire. It is similarly written, And they had brick for stone, and slime had they for mortar (Gen. 11:3). Note, there are nouns that are vocalized with a tzere, such as the word sefer (book), or a segol, i.e., tzedek (righteousness), whose status does not change at an etnach or at the end of a verse. The word teven (straw) falls into this category. We not know the reason for the this; however, such is the case.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Significance of the Year of the Flood?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I've been studying how the biblical creation & re-creation in Genesis, from Adam to Noah, foreshadows the Exodus.</p>\n<p>For instance, Noah is of the 10th generation of mankind. The Hebrews were slaves in Egypt for 400 years = 40 x 10 = 10 generations if we assume 40 years per generation. 10 generations of the righteous line appears to represent a certain fullness of time, after which God enacts judgement.</p>\n<p>Anyways, what I am interested in for this post is the year of the flood (beginning and/or end) and the significance thereof. Genesis is careful to document what year each person was born in, in terms of the age of their father, up through and including Noah. It also tells us that the flood began in Noah's 600th year - and even specifies the month and day.</p>\n<p>From my calculations, it looks like the flood began in the year 1656 (from creation) and ended in 1657 (from creation). Off hand, I don't see the significance of either number. Yet, why would the author of Genesis be so specific about these dates if there were no meaning to it? Please share your insights :)</p>\n\n\n",

Hashem cannot manifest physically at all, even in one location (<a href=\"https://www.daat.ac.il/daat/mahshevt/rambam/hakdamat-2.htm#6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Intro to Heleq</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היסוד השלישי שלילת הגשמות ממנו. וזהו שנאמין כי האחד הזה שזכרנו, אינו\nגוף ולא כוח בגוף, ולא ישיגוהו מאורעות הגופים כמו התנועה והמנוחה\nוהמשכן, לא מצד עצמות ולא במקרה. ולכן שללו ממנו החכמים ז\"ל החיבור\nוהפירוד. ואמרו (חגיגה טו.) אין למעלה לא ישיבה ולא עמידה, לא עורף ולא\nעפוי. כלומר: לא פירוד ולא עורף. והוא חיבור \"ולא עפוי\" מלשון \"ועפו בכתף\nפלשתים\", כלומר ידחפו אותם בכתף להתחברם בהם. ואמר הנביא \"ואל מי תדמיוני\nואשוה יאמר קדוש\". אילו היה גוף, היה דומה לגופים, וכל מה שבא בכתבי\nהקודש שמתארים אותו בתוארי הגופות, כמו ההליכה והעמידה והישיבה והדיבור\nוכיוצא בזה - הכל דרך השאלה. וכן אמרו ז\"ל (ברכות לא ע\"ב) \"דיברה תורה\nכלשון בני אדם\". וכבר דיברו החכמים בזה העניין הרבה. והיסוד השלישי הזה\nהוא מורה עליו מה שנאמר \"כי לא ראיתם כל תמונה\". כלומר: לא הישגתם אותו\nבעל תמונה, לפי שהוא, כמו שזכרנו, אינו גוף ולא כוח בגוף.</p>\n<p>The Third Fundamental principle: We are to believe that he is\nincorporeal, that His unity is physical neither potentially nor\nactually. None of the attributes of matter can be predicated of Him,\nneither motion, nor rest for example. They cannot refer to Him\naccidentally or essentially. That is why our sages denied Him\ncomposition and separation, and said : “On high there is neither\nsitting nor standing, neither want nor weariness” (Hagigah 15a), i.e.,\nneither composition nor separation, and said: “On High there is\nneither sitting nor standing, neither want nor weariness” (Hagigah\n15a), i.e., neither composition nor separation, as the Biblical usage\nof these words attests. The prophet asked: “To whom can you compare\nGod, whom might he resemble?” (Is. 40:18). If He were a body, He would\nbe like other bodies. Whenever Scripture describes Him im corporeal\nterms like walking, standing, sitting, speaking, and the like, it\nspeaks metaphorically. Thus our sages said: “The Torah speaks in human\nlanguage” (Berakhot 31b). This third fundamental principle is taught\nin the Biblical verse: “You have seen no image” (Deut. 4:15). This\nverse means to say, one cannot conceive of Him as one would a Baal\nimage, since, as we have shown, He has no body at all, actually or\npotentially.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is not a limitation of Hashem, but a limit of our physical world.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Yes, and no.</p>\n<p>Answering the title and the first sentence specifically, the Shechina, Hashem's dwelling in the spiritual and physical worlds, can certainly be in multiple places at once.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.3.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avot 3:6</a> demonstrates that Hashem will be present among every gathering of 10 Jews*, and even 5, 3 and 1 Jew(s), and brings pasukim to source these claims. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.21\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 20:21</a> is the most striking:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בכל המקום אשר אזכיר את שמי אבא אליך וברכתיך</p>\n<p>In every place where I cause My Name to be mentioned I will come unto\nyou and bless you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which Sforno, Ohr HaChaim and others explain means that Hashem, when He promised to \"dwell among us\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.25.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 25:8</a>), initially meant dwell in more places than just between the Keruvim, such as within every Jew.</p>\n<p>There is also the concept that Hashem's Presence sits among 3 judges when they judge.

Rabban Gamliel\nsaid to him: <strong>And if the sun, which is one of ten thousand attendants\nthat are before the Holy One, Blessed be He, rests upon all the world,\nthe Divine Presence of the Holy One, Blessed be He, all the more so\nrests upon the world.</strong> [Steinsaltz trans. and commentary]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it's not actually true that He's in multiple places at once, in the sense that He splits up into multiple parts, <em>chas veshalom</em>, but that does not preclude Him from shining the Light of His Presence, as it were, into wherever is <em>zoche</em>, and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.12.5?ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">desirable to Him</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>* See also <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/tanya/tanya_cdo/aid/7968/jewish/Epistle-23.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanya Iggeret HaKodesh 23</a>.

Because sometimes scripture gives the impression that God is somewhere or doing X, and you find out a few verses later that it's an Angel speaking on God's behalf. For example the Pillar of Fire by Night and Pillar of Cloud by Day was both God and not God? So I would argue that even when there's a manifestation of God, whether it's an Angel or some other form, God is also somewhere else in that moment.</p>\n\n\n",

I only know about the ana bekhoach prayer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Think palindrome.</p>\n<p>היהאהיה with the kollel is 42.</p>\n<p>The principle is used often in Torah, like for example, during the rite of the sanctification of the new moon.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואומר לחברו: שָׁלוֹם עֲלֵיכֶם: וחברו משיב עֲלֵיכֶם שָׁלוֹם: ג״פ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The letter 'Aleph' (א) corresponds to <em><strong>Commander of the World</strong></em> (אלופו של עולם) which is manifest as the Molad (the birth of the new moon), absolute nullification of self (בטול במציאות לגמרי היינו אין), when the visual appearance of the moon disappears completely for an instant. While the outer letters are moving toward the full moon on the 15th of the month (5...10...15)     (ה...י...וד׳ה).</p>\n<p>The cycle of the moon is in general associated with the aspect of wife/female (נקבה או אשה) and so too is the name אהיה. In that context, the small sum gematria of the four Matriarchs, שרה, רבקה, לאה, רחל is also 42.</p>\n<p>Just to point out, because it is not as obvious, one of the emphases from the structure of the <strong>palindrome</strong> is the general principle in the <em>structure</em> (עצמות היינו לשון צורה) of G-d’s universe that there is a <em>right</em> and <em>left</em> (חסד וגבורה שהוא קו ימין ושמאל היינו זה לעומת זה) also described as סובב או ממלא כל עלמין או חצוניות, which enclothes an inner aspect (פנימיות) also called קו האמצעי היינו הממוצא המחבר.</p>\n<p>In that context, it is worth pointing out that this also works for יהוה with slight variation.</p>\n<p>The palindrome is הוהיהוה and has a gematria of 42. But the kollel, the whole is not required. The sum is expressed naturally.</p>\n<p>It also alludes to the creation of <strong>the concept of time</strong> and its evolution into how it is expressed in <em>this world</em> (עולם הזה).</p>\n<p>The letter 'Yud' (י) corresponds to what is referred to was <em><strong>Unmeasured Time</strong></em> (זמן בלתי משוער) while the outer letters evolve and transform from <em>past</em> (היה) to <em>present</em> (הוה).</p>\n<p>This name is associated with the aspect of male/husband (זכר או איש).</p>\n<p>That male is פנימי to female and is enclothed within it. (זכר או דכרא הוא מתלבש בתוך הנקבה שהיא ענין הממלא וסובב)</p>\n<p>In this context, the small sum gematria of the Patriarchs (אברהם, יצחק, יעקב) is 44.</p>\n<p>This pertains to the traditional written portrayal of the 42 letter name that you mention.</p>\n<p>It is usually written in 7 rows, corresponding to the 7 days of the week, comprised of 6 letters to each row. But the 6 letters of 7 rows are divided into 2 groups of 3 letters in each row for a total of 42 letters. So visually, the full name appears as two columns comprised of 21 letters.</p>\n<p>If you included the count for the 2 columns to the 42 letters, it corresponds to the Patriarchs.</p>\n<p>So the 7 rows of 6 letters forming 2 columns also corresponds to the 3 Patriarchs and the 4 Matriarchs together as 7.</p>\n<p>And if you combine the small sum gematria for the Matriarchs and the Patriarchs, the resulting sum is 86 which is the name: אלהים, which is also  the gematria for הטבע, Nature, meaning the natural world comprised of <em>the Heavens and the Earth</em></p>\n<p>את-השמים ואת-הארץ,</p>\n<p>which is a notarikon for the <em>Shem Tov</em> אהוה which is gematria 17.</p>\n<p>And implied at the פנימיות of the <em>notarikon</em> for the center of the universe, like a soul enclothed within a body is the <em>Commander of the Universe</em>, the אלופו של עולם, the ‘<strong>Aleph</strong>’, but in a state of absolute humility and nullification of self,\nהבטול האמיתי היינו אין סוף, ב״ה which is implied from the kollel for the whole <em>Shem Tov</em> אהוה itself, 17 plus 1, which is 18.</p>\n<p>And this is:\nחי אני נאום יהוה.\nI am life, says G-d.</p>\n\n\n",

I have heard many <em>shiurim</em> that attest to how much Hashem appreciates us making our personal requests (<em>bakashot</em>) to Him, although I don't think I can find a good solid source to back up this point at the time of writing. Those who know, know I guess!</p>\n<p>So, here's a question with admittedly not a huge amount of solid ground to stand on, but hopefully someone out there will appreciate it and procure an interesting answer: <strong>If someone doesn't want anything at all, because he is truly happy and content with his lot, then is it ok that he doesn't make any <em>bakashot</em> when he prays?

Literally man must engage in physical hard labor in order to survive. Not only is there no rain or steady seasons, but now there are thorns and such to further aggravate the situation. Symbolically, this is a denial of the rest found with God.</li>\n<li>Servitude. Literally woman is now subjugated to man - the loss of equality.

That Adam caused <strong>death</strong> to exist in this world and Kayin caused <strong>murder</strong> to exist in this world and <em>they are the root causes behind war and conflict</em>.</p>\n<p>Based on the order of what Ramchal writes there, it appears that the sin related to Kayin, <em>which is violating the prohibition against coveting</em> (לא תחמוד) is the first priority, <em>even before the sin of Adam</em>. <em>Kayin coveted what his brother, Hevel had, and the consequence was murdering his brother.</em> In fact, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.11.6-9?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 11:6-9</a>, which says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The wolf shall dwell with the lamb. The leopard shall lie down with the kid; the calf, the beast of prey, and the fatling together with a little child to herd them.\nThe cow and the bear shall graze. Their young shall lie down together; and the lion, like the ox, shall eat straw.\nA babe shall play over a viper’s hole, and an infant pass its hand over an adder’s den.\nIn all of My holy mountain nothing evil or vile shall be done; for the land shall be filled with devotion to G-d, as water covers the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>also pertains to this. Many of the aspects of predation and the predator/prey relationship seem to relate to the subject of repairing the damage from Kayin.</p>\n<p>Many years ago, a similar question was posted to this website and closed for lack of details and clarity. Here is one answer that attempted to consider the subject. Perhaps it will provide some suggestions for thought to anyone who wishes to tackle this question today. <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67013/7303\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/67013/7303</a></p>\n<p>In particular, it should be noted that the second half, five of the ten commandments relate directly to the prohibition against coveting.

A less ridiculous scenario would be someone receiving a large sum as income and then having a lot of their wealth arrested (including what they had just received) - think of any Russian-Jewish oligarch that just sold a business or a football club only to find the profit money is locked up.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Punishment for making a statue of YHWH and worshipping/bowing to it\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>After reading \"The Origins of Judaism, An Archaeological Historical Reappraisal\" by Dr. Yonathan Adler, I understood that the practice of not making images of God/gods changed rather abruptly after the Hasmonean revolt. Ever since, the ban on making graven images of God has become an inherent part of Jewish theology and tradition.</p>\n<p>The Second Commandment is constantly cited as the source for such a prohibition, but the text stresses \"אֱלֹהִים <strong>אֲחֵרִים</strong> עַל־פָּנָיַ\" (\"other gods before me\") and, regarding icons and images, \"לֹא־תִשְׁתַּחְוֶה <strong>לָהֶם</strong> וְלֹא <strong>תָעָבְדֵם</strong>\" (\"thou shalt not bow down to <em><strong>them</strong></em>, nor serve <em><strong>them</strong></em>\"). Similarly, all books of the Torah and Prophets mention idols of <em>other</em> gods as abomination.</p>\n<p>I flipped through Rambam's Hilchos of Idolatry but didn't notice him mentioning anything related to images of YHWH/El/Elohim and worshipping YHWH <strong>specifically</strong> \"through\" them like the Christians do with the paintings of Michaelangelo (I refer to \"God the Father\", not Yeshu).</p>\n<p>I wondered, if a (<em>not-necessarily-anthropomorphic</em>) statue of YHWH were placed in a synagogue (<em>with a clear inscription \"שִׁוִּיתִי ה' לְנֶגְדִּי תָמִיד\"</em>) and another person was \"worshipping\" YHWH and bowing to this statue by reciting the Amidah prayer, what would the theoretical punishments of the sculptor and the worshipper be in Jewish Halachah?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>First of all, this Adler's claims are entirely against our tradition. Second, a statue by definition cannot be of Hashem as He has no form. And thirdly, Moses clearly warns us to remember that we saw no image of G-d at Mt. Sinai right before warning us about making idols. See Deuteronomy 4:15 and on.</p>\n\n\n",

Which would means that one cannot teach or learn the aleph beit in a makom metunaf, and one would also not be allowed to teach or learn aleph beit in front of ervah or tzoah.</p>\n<p>He seems to have two main points:</p>\n<p>The first:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והגר״א שם מביא מקור לדברי הרמ״א מהא דאמרו\nבמדרש תנחומא בפר׳ קדושים דשלוש שנים ערלי ם\nיהיו לכם הכתוב מדבר בתינוק דעד שלוש שנים הוא\nכערל ואינו שייך במצוות, ולכאו׳ היינו דוקא בגוף\nהמצוה שייך לומר כיון שהוא כערל אין שייך במצוה\nאבל א׳ ב׳ שהוא רק הכשר ללימוד, שייך אף בפחות\nמכן, וע״כ מבואר דעת הרמ״א דס״ל דלימוד אותיות\nהתורה זהו ג״כ בכלל מצוה דתלמוד תורה, ונכלל\nבכלל מה שמתוייבים ללמד בנו מקרא, שבזה ג ם\nמלמדו לקרוא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"The Gra there (on the Rema in Yoreah Deah 245:8) brings a source for the words of the Rema from what is said in the Midrash Tanchuma in Parashat Kedoshim, that \"שלש שנים יהיה לכם ערלים\" refers to a child, that until three years he is like one uncircumcised and is not obligated in mitzvot. And seemingly, this applies specifically to the body of the mitzvah, where it can be said that since he is like one uncircumcised, he is not obligated in the mitzvah. But the learning of the aleph beit, which is merely a preparation for learning, is applicable even before that age. Therefore, it is explained that the opinion of the Rema is that he holds that the study of the aleph beit is also included in the mitzvah of Talmud Torah, and it is included in the general obligation to teach one's son scripture, in which teaching him to read is also included.\"</p>\n<p>The second:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן נמי בדין דהלוא ידוע דאותיות התורה אינם\nכאותיות של שאר הלשונות, להבדיל, אלא רמוז\nבכל אות ואות סודות התורה, וכל נקודה ונקודה יש\nבה רמזים לעולמות עליונים, [עיין בגמרא שבת דף\nקד. ובב״י בסי׳ ל״ו בצורת האותיות]. והלימוד התור ה\nמתחיל בהכרת האות לקריאה ואח״ב מקרא, ולכן\nודאי יש בזה קיום מ״ע דתלמוד תורה, לידע האותיות\nלקרוא אותם, שהאותיות גופא קבלנו בלוחות הברית\nוהם גופא תורה ומקיים בזה המ״ע</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"Similarly, it is also the case that it is well known that the letters of the Torah are not like the letters of other languages, but rather every letter of the Torah contains secrets of the Torah, and every dot and point has hints to higher worlds (see Gemara Shabbat 104a and Beit Yosef Siman 36 regarding the shapes of the letters]. Torah learning begins with the recognition of the letters for reading, and afterwards with the scripture. Therefore, it is certain that there is the fulfillment of the positive commandment of Torah study in knowing the letters and reading them, as the letters themselves were received on the Tablets of the Covenant, and they themselves are Torah, and in this, one fulfills the positive commandment.\"</p>\n<p>In קונטרס ובשנה הרבעית חלק ב פרק ב הלכה א עם הערות written by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%A1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Mordechai Gross</a> he also says its considered talmud Torah and he adds sources to back this up:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובזוה״ק ח״ג דף עג א מלה קדמאה דאורייתא דיהבין לינוקא אל ף\nבית, דא מלה דלא יכלין בני עלמא לאדבקא בסוכלתנו, דלסלקא ליה\nברעותא, וכל שכן למללא בפומהון. וכן דייקו מגמ׳ שבת לא ע״א\nההוא נכרי וכו׳, ועי׳ שד״ח ח״א מערכת א כלל קב משמיה דהשל״ה\nדמהאי טעמא אין ללמד עכו״ם אותיות התורה, וכ״כ בברכ״י בשיו״ב\nיור״ד סי׳ רמו סק״ד. על כן הנהגה הרצויה היא שאם הבן יודע לומר\nברכות התורה או בעזרת האב, שיאמר הברכות קודם לימוד האותיות. וכן\nכשהבן הוא בר הבנה יאמר לו קודם לימודו, שיכוין לקיים מצוות לימוד\nהתורה.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"In the Zohar (3:73a), the first word of the Torah that is taught to a child is the aleph beit, a word that people cannot grasp with their intellect, to elevate it with intention, and certainly to speak it with their mouths. Similarly, it is inferred from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.31a.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara Shabbat 31a regarding the story of the non-Jew</a>. The Sdei Chemed (ח״א מערכת א כלל קב) in the name of the Shelah Hakadosh says that for this reason, it is prohibited to teach non-Jews the letters of the Torah. This is also written in Birkei Yosef (בשיו״ב\nיור״ד סי׳ רמו סק״ד). Therefore, the proper conduct is that if the child knows how to recite the brachot of the Torah, or with the help of the father, he should recite the brachot before learning the letters.\"</p>\n<p>Sorry for any poor translation and hope this helps!</p>\n\n\n",

Since the paradox assumes the donkey will\nalways go to whichever is closer, it dies of both hunger and thirst\nsince it cannot make any rational decision between the hay and\nwater.[1] A common variant of the paradox substitutes the hay and\nwater for two identical piles of hay; the ass, unable to choose\nbetween the two, dies of hunger.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Obviously in Judaism, when the choice is between evil or good, then we pick good. If there is evil or evil, then (I think this how to say it), we make the voluntary choice not to participate and isn't something we should choose. I think for example with the trolley problem we cannot flip the switch.</p>\n<p>But when there are choices between two good things of equal value, like to become a brain surgeon or a heart surgeon, eat or drink kosher food when hungry and thirsty and both offered equally, prove this theorem over this theorem, read this book or that book, how would one <strong>wisely</strong> choose which one to pick?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Given a choice between two mitzvot, which one should you do?  There are scattered guidelines.  For example:</p>\n<p>-Do first the one that recurs more frequently:\nתָּדִיר וְשֶׁאֵינוֹ תָּדִיר — תָּדִיר קוֹדֵם -- <em>Tadir veshe'eno tadir, tadir kodem</em>. [Berakhot 27a and 51b, Pesachim 114a, Megillah 29b, Sukkah 54b, Horayot 13, and Zevachim Mishna 10:1]\nThe implication is that because it recurs more often, it must be more important.  For example, we put on tzitzit (that is, the tallit) before we put on tefillin, because tzitzit recurs every day, but tefillin recurs every day except Shabbat. [Sefer Ta'amei Haminhagim Umkorei Hadinim]</p>\n<p>-Rav Naḥman of Breslov taught that a mitzvah that costs money is worth more than one that costs nothing.  So do first the one that costs more.</p>\n<p>-The study of Torah is as valuable as many other commandments rolled together:  <em>V’talmud Torah k’neged kullam</em> [Mishnah, Peah 1:1; Shabbat 127a].  So which mitzvah is more likely to enrich your knowledge of Torah?</p>\n<p>If your choices are unrelated to mitzvot, there are no Jewish guidelines.

It\nappears that Scripture saw fit to mention them here according to the\nimportance of the delegates [on the mission], for they were heads and\nprinces of the people, as is related, but they were not all of equal\nstanding, some of them being greater than the others in wisdom and\nhonor; therefore Scripture mentioned first those who were most\nhonored, who were first in status, since it named them according to\ntheir personal standing, not that of their tribe.

The plagues are grouped in many different ways generally, but the last 3 before the death of the firstborn are representative of Hashem's power over all powers (the first three attested to His existence, and the second 3 His authority (Malbim ibid; Haggada of the Ritva).</p>\n<p>I am unaware of any connection between the plagues and the End Times, especially in the sense that you are asking, and the ideas you have come up with (and generally, <a href=\"https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1823/heres-my-devar-torah-do-any-of-the-commentaries-say-this\">site policy considers asking about self-made theories controversial</a>; also note that we still have access to the teachings and explanations given to us by God at Sinai, so it's not common place to come up with self-made theories in the way you are doing). However, the preparation for the 10th plague, as well as the nature of the plagues being both miraculous and within nature (as is specifically explained regarding the plague of Darkness in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5168556/jewish/Bo-What-Darkness-Revealed.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likkutei Sichot 31 p.46</a>) are connected to the End Times.</p>\n<p>With regards to the former, the circumcision and the Pascal lamb were both physical acts that reveal God's Essence in even the lowest levels of existence and life. This is meant to imbibe the Israelites with a faith that doesn't remain lofty and blind, but permeates their intellect. This allows the faith to flow to their hearts and deeds in an internal, authentic way that encompasses their entire being; their entire soul and body:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The power to descend and affect such lowly levels of existence comes\nfrom a very lofty plane. Accordingly, we can appreciate that the power\nof the <em>mitzvah</em> of circumcision - which reveals Godliness within our\nphysical flesh (even with the organ associated with \"yesod, the end of\nthe torso\") - is very great. Based on that logic, the power of the\nPesach sacrifice is even greater, for it draws Godliness into a realm\noutside of the human sphere, into one's portion of the world...</p>\n<p>... It is written (Michah 7:15) \"As in the days of your Exodus from Egypt, I will show [the people] wonders\", indicating that the future Redemption will follow the patter of the Exodus from Egypt. The Exodus from Egypt came about in the mert of the Jews' faith, and because of the expression of that faith within their conscious powers - to the extent that encompassed the lowest levels with their personalities (as reflected by circuscision), and even entities entirely outside the human sphere (as reflected by eating the Pesach sacrifice.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the future Redemption will also come about in the mertif of faith. Despite the overwhelming concealment of Godliness in the present exile, it is possible to arouse simple faith in how close we are to the coming of Mashiach. \"He is standing behind our wall\" (Song of Songs 2:9) - i.e. Mashiach is fast approaching; he is eagerly waiting to come.</p>\n<p>The intent is that this faith should not remain merely an encompassing potential, but that it should permeate a person's character, beginning with his intellect and emotions and continuing until it affects even his lowest potentials (as alluded to by circumcision).</p>\n<p>This is accomplished by studying Chassidus and comprehending them thoroughly. Their study revealse the power of faith and internalizes it within the intellect, enabling it to affect all other potentials, thus causing a change in one's emotional characteristics. [<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/5168542/jewish/Bo-Catalysts-for-Redemption.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Source</a>. Translated by Sichot in English)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As is noted in Derech Mitzvotecha Haamanat Elokut 1 and 2, faith that has not permeated one's intellect will not have any affect on one's emotions or actions. A person may act according to his faith, but it will be rote and can lead to contradictions, such as a thief praying for success in his theft. It must also be accompanied by knowledge - deep, intimate, inner knowledge, and this is how God's desire and ultimate cosmic plan of dwelling in the lowest world is achieved.</p>\n<p>On the latter, the plague of darkness was accompanied by both a miracle, and a natural circumstance. The miracle was the darkness that paralyzed the Egyptians. The natural circumstance was the light that the Jews were able to see with, in order to perform their mission. This will be the same in the times of Mashiach. The Jews will receive miraculous assistance in order to break down any barriers that hinder their Divine service. The Divine service itself though, will take place in a natural, down to earth manner as the mission is, as stated above, to make this lowest world holy - a dwelling for the Almighty - which is the unique mission statement of the Jewish people and religion.</p>\n\n\n",

The specific point is that Hashem is both transcendant, but immanent in creation in the sense that His Essence is the vitaly of our very life, as well as the world at large.</p>\n<p>This perception should be empowered by the innate knowledge of His Oneness in our soul, combined with the results of Torah study, <strong>but it is expressed intuitively</strong>, having integrated it into one's heart, perfected one's character thereby, and then actualized with the performance of mitsvot flowing from this total integration of mind, body and soul.</p>\n<p>With this total integration, <strong>one is able to perceive His Oneness in everything, and at all times</strong> (especially when reciting Shema). The mitsvot one performs then reveal His transcendant Essence within the creation.</p>\n<p>Basically, it is the intuitive perception that Hashem is One with His creation - even though the creation hides Him, it doesn't obscure Him in any way of consequence, similar to how the body that our soul enlivens isn't of consequence - the enlivening vitality that is our soul is who we are and of consequence.</p>\n<h3>Walk through of the ma'amar</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Hashem transcends nature, and that is why we call Him the Ineffable Name, because He is above time and space, and nature completely<sup>1</sup>.</li>\n<li>Hashem is the source of all creation, and the vitality of it<sup>2</sup>.</li>\n<li>When He <strong>actualizes creation</strong>, we call Him Elokim. The analogy is given of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf%E2%80%93Rayet_star\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">core (essence) of the sun</a> being shielded by the outer layers, so that it doesn't utterly scorch the earth, and we can benefit from its light; i.e. the <em>actualization</em> of creation is done in such a way that shields the direct, nullifying Light of Hashem, in Essence<sup>3</sup>.</li>\n<li>All the shield of Elokim does is enable the Light of Hashem to be perceived by the creation, but it doesn't change His Light in any other way, which is still present within creation as well, and this is what the phrase \"Hashem is Elokim\" means (as found in Shema, and Devarim 4:39 etc).</li>\n<li><strong>Perceiving this <em>deeply and intuitively</em> is the mitsva of Unifying Hashem</strong>, and is done especially when we say Shema, where we declare \"Hashem Elokienu, <em>Hashem Echad</em> - Hashem is our God, <em>Hashem is One</em>\". I.e. Elokim, Who is actualizing creation, isn't separate from the vitality of the creation: Hashem. I.e. Hashem is One.</li>\n<li>This Oneness takes intellectual study and contemplation, many levels of it<sup>4</sup>, including studying how He is one with us, and how He is one with creation - and this study is part of the mitsva of Yediyat Hashem<sup>5</sup>.</li>\n<li>We are meant to study how our own soul is an analogy: paying attention to how our soul is the vitality of the body, and without it the body <em>has an eye but can't see, has an ear but can't hear</em> - the vitality of the body is our real life and what is of consequence about us, not the body itself, and use this as a springboard for understanding how Hashem is Elokim<sup>6</sup>.</li>\n<li>Another point of studying to perceive how He is unified with <em>us</em> is in order to understand that, just as we are a microcosm of creation, He is also unifed with <em>creation as a whole</em><sup>7</sup>. We indeed grow to perceive Him in creation.</li>\n<li>As our soul has this knowledge, we can contemplate that which we've mastered with our intellect, <em>with our heart</em>, probing our instinctive sense of this Oneness in our Divine soul<sup>8</sup>.</li>\n<li>This contemplation of the heart is ultimately to transform our character traits to produce every fine quality in all our limbs, filtering down to and producing our good deeds.</li>\n<li><strong>Through the full integration of heart and its corrected character traits, borne from this Torah study and the soul's knowledge of Hashem's Unity, one is able to in theory perceive Hashem's Unity with his entire being, at all times.</strong></li>\n<li>Putting this theory into practice, into <strong>actuality through our heartful deeds</strong>, Hashem's Light is indeed revealed in creation, Elokim is revealed as Hashem, and He attains a dwelling, with Him being fully espoused and at home with the Jew performing the deeds. <strong>Through these perfected deeds, we truly sense that He is the vitality of our soul</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>This is the fulfilment of the Divine desire to have a dwelling place in the lowest world</strong><sup>9</sup>, and <strong>this is the true meaning of Hashem is Elokim, i.e. Hashem is One.</strong> Performance of this mitsva achieves Hashem's very purpose of creation.</li>\n<li>As this is a life time's study and area of growth, every rung on the ladder of this <strong>knowledge and perception of Hashem's Oneness is a fulfilment of the mitsva of Unifying Hashem</strong>, which every Jew can do on their level.</li>\n<li>There are many other fine points in this maamar that warrant full study<sup>10</sup></li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1.

Therefore, they are forbidden.</p>\n<p>The Gemara <strong>raises an objection</strong> from a baraita: <strong>For what</strong> reason did the Sages <strong>say</strong> that <strong>the honey of bees is permitted</strong>? It is <strong>because they bring</strong> the nectar from the flowers <strong>into their body</strong>, but they do not excrete it from their body as a bodily excretion. So too, the urine of a donkey is not an excretion produced by the body itself. Rather, it is simply ejected in the same form that it entered the body. Why, then, should it be forbidden?</p>\n<p>The Gemara answers: Rav Sheshet <strong>stated</strong> his answer <strong>in accordance with</strong> the opinion of <strong>Rabbi Ya’akov, who says</strong> that with regard to <strong>honey, the Merciful One permits</strong> it as an exception to the principle that a substance that emerges from a non-kosher animal is non-kosher.</p>\n<p>This is <strong>as it is taught</strong> in a baraita: <strong>Rabbi Ya’akov says</strong> that it is stated: <strong>“Yet these may you eat of all winged creatures”</strong> (Leviticus 11:21). The word “these” indicates that <strong>you may eat these, but you may not eat a non-kosher winged creature.</strong> The Gemara asks: Why is this inference necessary? The prohibition against eating <strong>a non-kosher winged creature is written explicitly:</strong> “All winged creatures that go upon all fours are a repugnance to you” (Leviticus 11:20). <strong>Rather,</strong> the inference must be understood as follows: <strong>You may not eat a non-kosher winged creature, but you may eat that which a non-kosher winged creature discharges</strong> from its body, <strong>and what is that? That is the honey of bees.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To explain this rather long text: The discussion revolves around whether substances derived from non-kosher animals are themselves non-kosher, and Bechorot 7b examines this through the example of the urine of a donkey. Initially, it is stated that any product from a non-kosher animal is non-kosher. This applies to donkey urine, which some people drink for medicinal purposes. Rav Sheshet refers to a mishna to explain that since the donkey is non-kosher, its urine is also non-kosher.</p>\n<p>However, the Gemara raises an objection based on the example of bee honey, which is permitted even though bees are non-kosher. The reasoning is that bees do not produce honey as a bodily secretion but rather transform nectar collected from flowers. Hence, it is allowed. And Rabbi Ya’akov provides a scriptural basis for this exception, explaining that certain products, like honey, are explicitly permitted by the Torah despite being processed by non-kosher creatures.</p>\n<p>So to summarize it further, either we follow the position that honey is a divine exception (Rav Sheshet and Rabbi Ya'akov) which we can infer from a Beraita or a Beraita directly. The Beraita states that if it is directly from a non-kosher animals, such as milk or eggs, which are from the animal itself, then it's kosher or non-kosher status is transferred. But when the product is indirectly from the animal, such as honey, which is really from the flower, then it is permitted. Even though the nectar in the honeycombs is broken down and transformed into honey by enzymes in the bee, the nectar is never actually digested by the bee. So the honey is not a product of the bee itself—as is milk.</p>\n\n\n",

For whenever a person gives a loan at interest, if fixed interest is involved, it is forbidden by Scriptural Law and may be expropriated through legal process. The judges expropriate it from the lender and return it to the borrower. If the lender dies, it is not expropriated from his children's possessions.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Presumably, this works with the concept of לאו הניתק לעשה.</p>\n<p>This makes sense for the lender, as he has an obligation to return the interest. But how does this concept apply to the borrower, who has no obligation to repay, he is just on the receiving end.</p>\n<p>The leches mishna touches on this subject by proposing that this is what the other poskim who argue, as mentioned in the Maggid Mishne, hold</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש לחלוק על זה ולומר דדוקא מלוה וערב דאינהו מחזירין הממון פטורים אבל לוה דאינו מחזיר כלל חייב **ואפשר דהיינו מ\"ש ה\"ה ויש מדקדק בהיפך כלומר **דדוקא מלוה וערב כדכתיבנא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am looking for an explanation of the Rambam.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Drinking water before Shacharis when one did not make Kidush the night before\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>If one did not make Kidush by night, can he drink water the next morning before Shacharis without making Kidush first?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p><em>Do not base any halachic decisions based on this, consult your LOR</em></p>\n<p>I recently saw this Halacha from Daily Halacha By Rabbi Eli Mansour (June 18, 2024) that answers your question</p>\n<p>Both men and women are obligated to recite (or hear) Kiddush on Friday night. If a person, for whatever reason, did not recite Kiddush on Friday night, then he must recite it on Shabbat morning. This means that instead of reciting the brief Shabbat morning Kiddush, he must recite the Kiddush text that is normally recited on Friday night. Thus, if a person was ill, Heaven forbid, or if he fell asleep before reciting Kiddush or simply forgot to recite Kiddush, he must recite the Friday night Kiddush after Shaharit on Shabbat morning.</p>\n<p>In such a case, when a person did not recite Kiddush on Friday night and must therefore do so on Shabbat morning, is he allowed to drink before Shaharit that morning?</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, although it is forbidden to eat before reciting Shaharit in the morning (both on Shabbat and on weekdays), it is permissible to drink water, tea or coffee before Shaharit. This is allowed even on Shabbat morning, despite the fact that one may not drink before reciting Kiddush, because the Kiddush obligation sets in only after one recites Shaharit. The Sages enacted the recitation of Kiddush on Shabbat morning specifically for after the Shaharit service, and therefore the prohibition against eating and drinking before Kiddush does not apply until after Shaharit. Before Shaharit, one is bound only by the restrictions that apply to eating and drinking before praying in the morning, and thus one may drink water, tea or coffee before Shaharit on Shabbat morning, just as he may on weekday mornings.</p>\n<p>However, in a case where one missed Kiddush on Friday night, he already bears the previous night's obligation to recite Kiddush, and thus, seemingly, he is not allowed to drink anything on Shabbat morning until he recites Kiddush. This is, indeed, the ruling of Rav Shlomo Kluger (1789-1869), in his work Ha'elef Lecha Shelomo (OC 121).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במ\"ש בש\"ע סי' ר\"צ סעיף א' ומיהו לשתות מים קודם קידוש מותר שעדיין לא חל\nעליו חובת קידוש נראה דהיינו דוקא אם עשה קידוש בלילה כדין אבל אם לא עשה\nקידוש בלילה בענין דמחויב לקדש ביום קידוש של לילה כמ\"ש לעיל סי' רע\"א אז\nאסור אף לשתות מים קודם תפלה כיון דחל עליו חובת קידוש של לילה ואף שלא\nהתפלל דבשלמא קידוש של יום שעדיין לא חל עליו ואנו רוצים שיחול כעת בזה\nאנו אומרים קודם תפלה עדיין לא חל עליו חובת קידוש אבל אם כבר חל בלילה\nהחוב עליו כיון שחל שוב לא פקע אף קודם תפלה ואסור לשתות אף בבוקר אף מים\nוז\"ב:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Hacham Ovadia Yosef, however, disagrees, and rules that one may drink water, tea or coffee before Shaharit on Shabbat morning even if he had not recited Kiddush the previous night. This ruling is also brought down in more detail in Yalkut Yosef Siman 271 Halacha 23. There is a Halachic rule called \"En Kiddush Ela Be'makom Se'uda,\" which means that one fulfills the obligation of Kiddush only if he recites Kiddush in the context of a meal. Before Shaharit, Halacha forbids eating a meal, and it is therefore impossible to fulfill the Kiddush obligation on Shabbat morning until after one prays Shaharit. Thus, even if one bears the previous night's obligation of Kiddush, nevertheless, since he is incapable of fulfilling this obligation until after he recites Shaharit, it is permissible for him to drink before reciting Shaharit. In all cases, then, one may drink water, tea or coffee before Shaharit on Shabbat morning.</p>\n<p>Summary: One who did not, for whatever reason, recite Kiddush on Friday night must recite the Friday night Kiddush after Shaharit on Shabbat morning. One is allowed to drink water, tea or coffee before Shaharit on Shabbat morning, even if he did not recite Kiddush on Friday night according to Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Rav Shlomo Kluger disagrees and rules that one is not allowed to drink.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How did Rashi reach the number of eight people carrying the grapes?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The פסוק states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיָּבֹ֜אוּ עַד־נַ֣חַל אֶשְׁכֹּ֗ל וַיִּכְרְת֨וּ מִשָּׁ֤ם זְמוֹרָה֙ וְאֶשְׁכּ֤וֹל עֲנָבִים֙ אֶחָ֔ד וַיִּשָּׂאֻ֥הוּ בַמּ֖וֹט בִּשְׁנָ֑יִם וּמִן־הָרִמֹּנִ֖ים\nוּמִן־הַתְּאֵנִֽים׃ (במדבר יג:כג)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And they came to the brook of Eshkol, and they cut from there a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they carried it on a pole, by two, and of the pomegranates and of the figs. (Numbers 13:23) [Translation mine.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>רש''י explains (ד''ה וישאהו):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>.מִמַּשְׁמַע שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר \"וַיִּשָּׂאֻהוּ בַמּוֹט\" אֵינִי יוֹדֵעַ שֶׁהוּא בִשְׁנַיִם? מַה תַּ\"ל \"בִּשְׁנָיִם\"? בִּשְׁנֵי\nמוֹטוֹת. הָא כֵיצַד? שְׁמוֹנָה נָטְלוּ אֶשְׁכּוֹל, אֶחָד נָטַל תְּאֵנָה וְאֶחָד רִמּוֹן</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From the implication of that which has been said \"And they carried it on a pole,\" don't I know that it is [carried] by two [people]? Why, then, did the verse say \"by two\"? [It means that it was carried] by two poles. How [was] this [done]? <strong>Eight</strong> took a cluster, one took a fig and one took a pomegranate. [Translation mine.]</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If there were two poles, there must have been four people, because there were two people per pole. How then, does רש''י reach the number eight people?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>All text and translation have been taken from Sefaria</p>\n<p>Rashi is basing his comment on the Gmara in Sotah 34a which states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רַבִּי יִצְחָק: טוּרְטָנֵי, וְטוּרְטָנֵי דְטוּרְטָנֵי, הָא\nכֵּיצַד? שְׁמֹנָה נָשְׂאוּ אֶשְׁכֹּל, אֶחָד נָשָׂא רִימּוֹן, וְאֶחָד\nנָשָׂא תְּאֵינָה. יְהוֹשֻׁעַ וְכָלֵב לֹא נָשְׂאוּ כְּלוּם.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yitzḥak said: They were configured like upper rods of scales\n[turtanei] that are balanced on the lower rods of scales, i.e., there\nwere not two but four poles. How so? Eight of the spies carried the\ncluster of grapes, one of them carried a pomegranate, and one carried\na fig. Joshua and Caleb did not carry anything.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And on this Rashi says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי יצחק טורטני וטורטני דטורטני - משאוי ומשאוי תחת משאוי שהתחתונים\nמסייעין את העליונים ובכל אחד היו שני מוטות כיצד שני מוטות הולכין זה\nאצל זה וארבעה נושאין אותם ושני מוטות אחרים וארבעה בני אדם נושאין אותם\nוהם באלכסון מתחת שנים העליונים מוט אחד לראש האחד ומוט אחד לראש השני\nוהולכין באלכסון ורבי יצחק לאו מקרא שמיע ליה אלא דפשיטא ליה דרימון\nותאינה סגי בשנים ויהושע וכלב לא נשאו כלום פשו להו תמניא לאשכול ואם לאו\nמדרש הראשון המלמדנו דלאו מוט אחד קאמר קרא לא היינו יודעים לכוין שמנה\nבני אדם למשאו אלא דשמעינן מיניה דשני מוטות היו ואתא רבי יצחק לאשמועינן\nדשני משאות היו שם וכל אחד שני מוטות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on this understanding when the Pasuk says two poles it seemingly refers to the layer of poles as opposed to the poles themselves, so there were two layers of two poles I.e 4 poles in total. The easiest way to picture it is a grid of Tik-Tak-Toe. According to this view it is understandable why 8 people were needed. 2 poles directly supporting the grapes (4 people) and 2 poles perpendicular supporting the top poles (4 people)</p>\n\n\n",

As we know,\nthere is Chochma and Binah, which correspond to the brain and the\nheart respectively.

According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.18?lang=bi&with=Ibn%20Ezra&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a>, it has a particular meaning and allows the phrase to mean something different from how others might understand it. But he refers to other commentators who see it as \"superfluous\" (שהלמ״ד נוסף) and the meaning should be understood as if the lamed had no impact.</p>\n<p>But if no letter in the Torah is <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/18799/are-there-unnecessary-words-in-torah\">extra</a>, how can there be any understanding in which we simply ignore a letter as extra?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Concerning seemingly extra letters, every case needs to be looked at individually to figure out why it's not extra.</p>\n<p>In this case the Ramban in Vakikra 19:18 answers, and says the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויתכן בעבור שלא אמר \"ואהבת את רעך כמוך\" והשוה אותם במלת \"לרעך\" וכן ואהבת לו כמוך (ויקרא י״ט:ל״ד) דגר שיהיה פירושו להשוות אהבת שניהם בדעתו כי פעמים שיאהב אדם את רעהו בדברים ידועים להטיבו בעושר ולא בחכמה וכיוצא בזה ואם יהיה אוהבו בכל יחפוץ שיזכה רעהו האהוב לו בעושר ובנכסים וכבוד ובדעת ובחכמה ולא שישוה אליו אבל יהיה חפץ בלבו לעולם שיהיה הוא יותר ממנו בכל טובה ויצוה הכתוב שלא תהיה פחיתות הקנאה הזאת בלבו אבל יאהב ברבות הטובה לחבירו כאשר אדם עושה לנפשו ולא יתן שיעורין באהבה ועל כן אמר ביהונתן (שמואל א כ יז) כי אהבת נפשו אהבו בעבור שהסיר מדת הקנאה מלבו ואמר (שם כג יז) ואתה תמלוך על ישראל וגו' וענין הנקימה והנטירה כבר פירשוהו רבותינו (תו\"כ קדושים ד י יא) שהוא בדבר שאין בו חיוב ממון השאילני מגלך השאילני קרדומך כי בדבר שנתחייב לו חברו ממון כגון בנזיקין וכיוצא בהן אינו מחוייב להניח לו אבל יתבענו בב\"ד וישולם ממנו מפסוק כאשר עשה כן יעשה לו (ויקרא כ״ד:י״ט) והוא מעצמו חייב לשלם כאשר ישלם מה שלוה או מה שגזל וכל שכן בענין נפש שיהיה נוקם ונוטר לו עד שיגאל דמי אחיו מידו על פי בית דין המורים במשפטי התורה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"And perhaps, because it does not say \"Love your neighbor as yourself\" but instead equates them with the word \"<strong>to</strong> your neighbor,\" and similarly \"and you shall love him as yourself\" (Vayikra 19:34) regarding the stranger, the intention is to equalize the love of both in one's mind. For sometimes a person loves their neighbor in specific matters, benefiting them with wealth but not with wisdom, and so on. And if they love them in everything, they will desire for their beloved neighbor to attain wealth, assets, honor, and wisdom, but not to be equal to them. Instead, they will always wish in their heart to be greater than their neighbor in every good thing. The Torah commands that this deficiency of jealousy should not exist in their heart, but rather, they should love the increase of good for their friend as a person does for themselves, without setting limits to the love. Therefore, it says about Yonatan (Samuel Aleph 20:17) that he loved him as his own soul, because he removed the attribute of jealousy from his heart. And it says (ibid. 23:17), \"You will reign over Israel,\" etc. The matter of vengeance and bearing a grudge has already been explained by our Sages (Sifra Kedoshim 4:10-11) as concerning matters without financial obligation: \"Lend me your sickle,\" \"Lend me your hatchet.\" For in matters where one's friend owes them money, such as damages and similar cases, one is not obligated to forgive but can demand it in court and it will be repaid to them, as it says, \"As he has done, so shall it be done to him\" (Vayikra 24:19). One is personally obligated to repay, just as they repay a loan or something they stole. All the more so in the matter of life, where one will take vengeance and bear a grudge until the blood of their brother is avenged by the court following the judgments of the Torah.\"</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Minhag when Changing Money from a Tzedaka Pushka\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I observed a minhag that when changing money with money in a tzedakah Pushka, not to change the full amount. For example, if you try to change 5 dollars into quarters one would leave the last quarter (or any amount) in the Pushka, hence only ending up with a lesser amount.\nThe reason I recall hearing is, that one doesn't use a Pushka for changing money, and by doing it this way it is considered giving a donation.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know of sources for this minhag?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the Sefer Laws of Tzedakah and Maaser Page 115 he quotes this minhag you mentioned.</p>\n<p>The reason for this is found <a href=\"https://mevakeshlev.blogspot.com/2015/01/making-change-from-tzedakah-box.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in Arachin 6a says: “[If one declares]: ‘This coin shall go\nto tzedakah,’ before it reaches the gabbai’s hand (the one in charge\nof tzedakah), it is permitted to change it. Once it reaches the\ngabbai’s hand, it is forbidden to change it.” The gemara asks from the\nstory of Rabbi Yannai, who borrowed tzedakah money after it reached\nthe gabbai. It explains that he did so in order to tell others that\nthere were no liquid funds, and people would give more. Thus, his\nborrowing helped the poor.   Rishonim differ as to the meaning of\n“changing” money. Rashi and Tosafot (ad loc.) explain that the donor\ncould lend the money to himself or to others before he gave the\nassigned money to the gabbai. The Rambam (Matnot Ani’im 8:4) seems to\nrelate the gemara to switching the coins to different ones of the same\ncumulative value. The Beit Yosef (Yoreh Deah 259) finds difficulty\nfitting the Rambam’s explanation into the gemara and incorporates only\nRashi’s into his halachic work (Shulchan Aruch YD 259:1).</p>\n<p>There is much discussion among Acharonim on the question if the status\nof a tzedakah box is like that of a gabbai or not. Without delving\ndeeply into this question, most treat it like a gabbai (see Tzitz\nEliezer XVI, 29 and Tzedakah U’Mishpat 8:(25)). It might seem then\nthat our question depends on the differing approaches to the gemara.\nAccording to the Rambam, it is forbidden even to switch the coins in a\ntzedakah box. According to Rashi, which the Shulchan Aruch accepts as\nhalacha, perhaps it is forbidden only to borrow the money, but it is\npermitted to simply make change. After all, tzedakah money does not\nhave intrinsic holiness, making it religiously forbidden to use (Rama,\nYD 259:1).</p>\n<p>Rather, the pauper(s) has rights to the money. On the other hand, the\nRif (Bava Kamma 18b) seems to agree with the Rambam that after the\ntzedakah has reached the gabbai, its coins cannot even be exchanged.\nFurthermore, it is likely that the Shulchan Aruch argues with the\nRambam only regarding the gemara’s interpretation, not regarding\nhalacha (Aruch Hashulchan, YD 259:1). It is likely the same as using a\nfriend’s money without his permission. Indeed, is one permitted to use\nmoney that someone entrusted in his hands? The Shulchan Aruch (Choshen\nMishpat 292:7) rules that it depends on whether the watchman is one\nwho deals in coins regularly and on whether the owner hinted as to his\nfeelings on the matter, but, as a rule, he may not borrow it. He does\nnot explicitly address the question of exchanging coins, which\nAcharonim dispute (see Pitchei Choshen, Pikadon 5:(67)). Therefore, it\nis unclear if one can use a tzedakah box to make change even when we\nknow of no specific reason that the recipients will thereby lose. <strong>This\njustifies the stringent practice that when leaving even a small\ndonation, the act is considered giving tzedakah rather than taking\nchange, and it is permitted.</strong></p>\n<p>Besides the fact that not all agree to the stated reasons for\nstringency, additional factors play a role. Regarding a general\ntzedakah box which the shul’s gabbai administers at his discretion,\nthere may be an understanding that the money can be used for such\nthings as getting change (see similar cases in Netivot Hamishpat\n301:9; Tzedakah U’Mishpat 8:8). This may depend on local practice. We\nshould also recall the gemara’s idea that when the poor gain from the\nmoney’s use, it is permitted. The question is whether by using the\ntzedakah box to get several coins in order to distribute (some of)\nthem to the poor one will give the poor more tzedakah. One must also\nfactor in whether he has left behind enough coins to enable the next\nperson to give a donation that requires change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As for the friend for enjoyment, this is of two types - the friend for pleasure and the friend for confidence. Indeed, the friend for pleasure is like the friendship of males and females and similar to it; whereas the friend for confidence is when a man has a friend to whom he can confide his soul. He will not keep [anything] from him - not in action and not in speech.  And he will make him know all of his affairs - the good ones and the disgraceful - without fearing from him that any loss will come to him with all of this, not from him and not from another. As when a person has such a level of confidence in a man, he finds great enjoyment in his words and in his great friendship. And a friend for virtue is when the desire of both of them and their intention is for one thing, and that is the good. And each one wants to be helped by his friend in reaching this good for both of them together.

There were apparently local courts of 23 in each city to whom people who had such doubts would address their inquiries. If this local court knew they answer, they would give it, and if not they would forward the question to another such local court nearby. If that didn’t work, the question would go to the third-highest court in the land, which was at the entrance to the Temple Mount, and then to the second-highest court in the land, inside the Temple courtyard, both of which consisted of twenty-three judges. Finally, the inquiry would go to the highest court in the land: the major Sanhedrin of about seventy judges, who sat in a special chamber in the Temple proper. Either they would know the answer or they would issue a ruling on the matter.</p>\n<p>These three highest courts were also used for another purpose: determining whether a sage was a zaken mamre, an elder sage who disputed the halakhic ruling of the high court of about seventy.</p>\n<p>A sage who had a dispute with their colleagues would present both their own (minority) position and their colleagues’ (majority) position to the third-highest court, and if necessary to the second highest court, as above. However, if the inquiry reached the highest court, if the high court ruled against the elder and in favor of their colleagues, then the elder had to comply with their colleagues and cease teaching their own position. If they refused to do so, they would be considered a rebellious elder and be tried by a court of seventy-one, receiving the death penalty if found guilty.</p>\n<p>Since the cases addressed in these situations found include financial disputes, there were indeed times when courts of twenty-three would address financial questions.</p>\n\n\n",

Duolingo, surprisingly, aids somewhat as it does teach Hungarian dialect but I’d like to be able to speak if for a Torah purpose; learning Satmar Chassidus. Any advice? Such as a useful dictionary or a Shirium.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The best technique I know uses the following book: <a href=\"https://seforimdeals.com/products/likkutei-sichos-dictionary-%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://seforimdeals.com/products/likkutei-sichos-dictionary-%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%9F-%D7%9C%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA</a></p>\n<p>It's a tiny dictionary for likkutei sichos (a collection of parsha talks delivered by the Lubavitcher Rebbe) which is a very soft introduction to Yiddish, since it uses lots of Hebrew words where possible. You probably need fewer than 200 words in your working vocabulary to be proficient in sichos.</p>\n<p>However, not any volume of likkutei sichos will do for practicing Yiddish. Stick to volumes 15-29, since the others are either in Hebrew or in more complex Yiddish.</p>\n<p>So pick up the book I linked above, and then a volume or two of likkutei sichos. Fortunately, if you get stuck, <a href=\"https://projectlikkuteisichos.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://projectlikkuteisichos.org/</a> has tons of helpful translated material and shiurim in English and other languages on volumes 10-23 (as of time of writing, I think they're on 23).

Just like the sichos themselves, mix as much hebrew or another language as you wish. It's a good way to practice generatively but at your own pace, which is something that's scarce in either text based or discussion based contexts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In many respects, Hasidic Yiddish is like YIVO's \"Standard Yiddish\", and they are mutually intelligible to a high degree. Some of the differences that Hasidic Yiddish has include small orthographic changes, inclusion of more \"Germanisms\" and dialectal terms, and weakening of grammatical cases and genders. Since YIVO Yiddish, and related historical dialects, have substantial resources available, learning the basics of these types of Yiddish may be a good place for a complete novice to start.</p>\n<p>To date, there is no comprehensive grammar or dictionary published for modern Hasidic dialects of Yiddish, though many articles have now been published on these topics.

    "content": "# Korach - Why Moshe needed to ask Hashem not to accept their incense?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Parshat Korach 16:15 it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיִּ֤חַר לְמֹשֶׁה֙ מְאֹ֔ד וַ<strong>יֹּ֙אמֶר֙ אֶל־יְהֹוָ֔ה אַל־תֵּ֖פֶן</strong>\n<strong>אֶל־מִנְחָתָ֑ם</strong> לֹ֠א חֲמ֨וֹר אֶחָ֤ד מֵהֶם֙ נָשָׂ֔אתִי וְלֹ֥א הֲרֵעֹ֖תִי\nאֶת־אַחַ֥ד מֵהֶֽם׃</p>\n<p>Moses was much aggrieved and he said to יהוה, “<strong>Pay no regard to their\noblation.</strong> I have not taken the ass of any one of them, nor have I\nwronged any one of them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to most commentators, at least that I’ve seen, they see this as directed specifically to them and not on the whole group (as Chizkuni spells out very clearly). According to Sforno it seems that Moshe is basically putting a “block” that even if Hashem wanted to accept their offering, since Moshe does not forgive them and it’s a sin between man and man, then even Hashem can’t forgive them.</p>\n<p>I have two questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Whats the hava Mina to begin with that Moshe thought that Hashem would accept their incense that he had to specifically ask Hashem not to accept it? Ibn Ezra seems to hint at some kind of merit that they have that would have allowed their incense to be accepted. What merit is this and again why would that triumph their actions now (even if you answer according to Ramban that seems to say that they didn’t even participate in the burning of the incense and rather it refers to praying, the question still stands)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Chizkuni understands that because Datan and Aviram were challenging all of priesthood and the rest of the group including Korach were only challenging Aaron specifically being appointed, that’s why Moshe only prayed for their incense/prayers to not get answered. From his words it also seems to hint that there was a chance that the rest of the groups incense would get accepted (but because their intentions weren’t as severe it was ok)… so even if you answer to question one about the tremendous merit Datan and Aviram had that Moshe was “worried”, according to Chizkuni what was the merit the remaining group had that Hashem would have accepted their incense?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Not sure how this community views someone answering their your own question but I thought it’s chaval to delete in the case that someone has a similar question in the future and over Shabbat I found an answer that at least satisfied me so I wanted to share:</p>\n<p>The Ohr HaChaim Hakadosh answers these questions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר אל ה׳ אל תפן, He said to G'd: \"do not turn to their\ngift-offering.\" Moses now understood the depth of Datan and Aviram's\nhatred, that they were thoroughly wicked and actually hated anything\nor anybody who was good. He was aware that there are no people who do\nnot have certain merits due to good deeds they have performed. He\nrealised that G'd does not withhold the reward for such merits from\nanyone, and that if the people in question cannot be rewarded in the\nhereafter because they had forfeited their hereafter, G'd would\ncompensate them in this life. This is based on Deut. 32,4 that \"the\nLord is one of faithfulness without iniquity.\" Sanhedrin 106 provides\nus with an example of the wicked Bileam, who had after all pronounced\nall the blessings on the Jewish people, collecting his fee for having\nthe Moabites seduce the Israelites, prior to his being slain. Moses\ndid not want G'd to accept even the good deeds Korach and associates\nhad performed for whom they had not yet received a reward. This is\nwhat he had in mind when he referred to מנחתם.</p>\n<p>Be aware that the righteous possess the power to annul merits which\nthe wicked have accumulated when they observe that the potential\nrecipients have become thoroughly wicked. This is the mystical\ndimension of Samuel II 23,3 צדיק מושל יראת אלוקים, \"The righteous\nrules in matters of G'd-fearingness.\" This means that G'd has given\nthe righteous leeway to cancel merits that the wicked have acquired.\nThe idea is that although G'd Himself does not do this, He has allowed\nthe righteous to be His surrogates in this respect. This is not so\nsurprising as the same principle which has been adopted by a court in\nour world which has the right to deprive an accused of property he\nowns under the heading of הפקר בית דין הפקר, that when a Jewish court\ndeclares certain property as ownerless such a declaration is binding\n(compare Gittin 36). When Moses said the words את אחד מהם, this\nincluded that he was not even involved when one Jew hurt another Jew\nin some way. He had never given a verdict in which the guilty had been\nexonerated, nor had he issued a verdict in which the innocent had been\ndeclared guilty. If, as a result of his decision, one party had to pay\nmoney to a second party this was not Moses' doing but the guilty party\nhad caused that loss to the other. Seeing that Moses possessed\nsufficient prophetic insight not to make awards to people who did not\ndeserve them from people who were innocent of wrongdoing, he could say\nof himself that he had not wronged anybody during his career as leader\nof the nation. Inasmuch as Datan and Aviram's hatred of him could only\nbe the result of bad character, Moses felt entitled to ask G'd to\ndeprive these men of any merits they might have accumulated in their\nlives and for which they had not yet been recompensed. I believe that\nthe wicked people concerning whom Moses offered this prayer, i.e.\nDatan and Aviram, were not considered by him as part of the\ncongregation of Korach concerning whom we applied the verse from\nSamuel I that their share in the resurrection had already been assured\n(compare Sanhedrin 108). The souls of these men (Datan and Aviram)\nmust have had their roots in the קליפה, the spiritually negative\ndomain of Satan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Here is a ChatGPT translation:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But one should understand and contemplate the entire context of the\nportion, the nature of the dispute, and the punishment that befell\nthem. For Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and the two hundred and fifty men did\nnot all share the same status or intention in their dispute. We see\nthat only Korah and the two hundred and fifty men took the censers,\nnot Dathan and Abiram. Additionally, God honored the two hundred and\nfifty men, not Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, as will be explained. Thus,\nit must be understood that the two hundred and fifty men were truly\ngreat among Israel in every aspect, including their fear of God. Their\ndesire for the priesthood, which brings closeness and love of God,\nburned within them like a fire. This was not for the sake of authority\nor imagined honor but to sanctify and achieve this level through\nservice. They also knew that God's word through Moses was true and did\nnot question it, God forbid. They only questioned in their hearts\nGod's will and were willing to sacrifice themselves and die for the\nlove of God, for love is as strong as death. All this is explained in\nthe Midrash that Rashi brought, which states: \"What did Korah see to\nlead him to this foolishness? It is already written that the two\nhundred and fifty men sinned with their souls.\" But Korah, who was\nwise, what did he see, etc.? At first glance, it is not clear how this\nanswers regarding the two hundred and fifty men who sinned with their\nsouls. [I know there is room to explain according to what is stated in\nSanhedrin (52a) that \"with their souls\" means in matters of their\nsouls, that they ate and drank at Korah's house and were thereby\nswayed. But it seems that the authors of the Midrash intended\nsomething else.] The meaning of the verse is similar to the\nexplanation of the verse regarding a Nazir who became impure (Numbers\n6:11): \"and he shall atone for having sinned regarding the soul.\" We\nexplained there that he suffered from abstaining from wine in order to\nattain the level of the Holy Spirit and be holy to God, which was not\nappropriate for his level. This can be seen from the fact that he\nbecame impure, and the scripture says that one who caused himself\nsuffering.his soul to achieve the level of the Holy Spirit and to be\nholy to God. This was not appropriate for his level. The test for this\nis that he became impure, and the scripture says that one who caused\nhimself suffering to achieve a level beyond his capability is called a\nsinner regarding his soul. Similarly, they sought to achieve the level\nof love for God through service, even though they knew they would not\nbe spared and that Moses' words would certainly come true. This is\ncalled \"these sinners with their souls,\" as they sought to sacrifice\ntheir souls only to achieve the level of love and piety, which is not\nin accordance with God's will. Therefore, this issue is connected to\nthe portion of Tzitzit, where the pious ones were warned with a thread\nof blue, so that in all their piety, they would not stray from God's\ncommandments, as we explained in the warning \"and you shall not\nfollow...\" The two hundred and fifty men rebelled against this and\nthus received their punishment. It was impossible for them to take\ncensers or similar items and offer them in the Tabernacle because the\nLevites guarded against unauthorized persons approaching. Therefore,\nthey had to create a dispute against Moses and Aaron and breach the\nboundaries. <strong>This was the way of the two hundred and fifty men, and\nbecause they intended for the sake of Heaven, they were punished by\nburning with fire that came out from the Holy of Holies, which also\ninvolved an element of honor, as will be explained. Not so with Dathan\nand Abiram. They were far from this lofty desire, being naturally\nargumentative and enemies of Moses even back in Egypt, as stated in\nNedarim 64b. All the more so now, when it was decreed that they would\ndie in the desert and not enter the land flowing with milk and honey.\nTherefore, they were punished by being swallowed up by the earth like\nan animal. However, Korah was truly a great man and fit for the desire\nof the two hundred and fifty men. It appeared to people that he too\nwas seeking this, but in truth, his inner self was not so, and\njealousy for power consumed him. Therefore, he acted like the two\nhundred and fifty men and was punished like Dathan and Abiram.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

In the case of the mountains, the <em>reason</em> why they became uprooted was in the hopes that the Torah would be given on them, but the synagogues already <strong>have</strong> words of Torah being said in them, so what does the words of Torah being said in them have to do with them being uprooted?</p>\n<p>Language from the source in question:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תַּנְיָא, רַבִּי אֶלְעָזָר הַקַּפָּר אוֹמֵר: עֲתִידִין בָּתֵּי\nכְנֵסִיּוֹת וּבָתֵּי מִדְרָשׁוֹת שֶׁבְּבָבֶל שֶׁיִּקָּבְעוּ בְּאֶרֶץ\nיִשְׂרָאֵל, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר: ״כִּי כְּתָבוֹר בֶּהָרִים וּכְכַרְמֶל בַּיָּם\nיָבֹא״, וַהֲלֹא דְּבָרִים קַל וָחוֹמֶר: וּמָה תָּבוֹר וְכַרְמֶל\nשֶׁלֹּא בָּאוּ אֶלָּא לְפִי שָׁעָה לִלְמוֹד תּוֹרָה, נִקְבָּעִים\nבְּאֶרֶץ יִשְׂרָאֵל, בָּתֵּי כְנֵסִיּוֹת וּבָתֵּי מִדְרָשׁוֹת\nשֶׁקּוֹרִין וּמַרְבִּיצִין בָּהֶן תּוֹרָה — עַל אַחַת כַּמָּה\nוְכַמָּה.</p>\n<p>It is taught in a baraita: Rabbi Elazar HaKappar says: In the future,\nthe synagogues and the study halls in Babylonia will be transported\nand reestablished in Eretz Yisrael, as it is stated: “Surely, like\nTabor among the mountains, and like Carmel by the sea, so shall he\ncome” (Jeremiah 46:18).

If you view the relocation to Eretz Israel as the “uprooting” then it makes sense.

If someone does not have documentation to prove uninterrupted matrilineal Jewish ancestry, take the FamilyTreeDNA mtDNA test and If the result is on FamilyTreeDNA's list of Jewish mtDNA branches, will that person need giyur l'chumra to be considered fully Jewish? If so, can giyur l’chumra be made in Brazil? I know that normal conversions cannot be done in Brazil, and I also know that the Modern Orthodox and Religious Zionist rabbis consider this decision by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel to be contrary to Halacha, but the Haredi rabbis accept this 2019 decision.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The shift is towards accepting mtDNA as a <strong>supplementary form</strong> of evidence of halakhic Jewish identity. Rabbis Israel Barenbaum (Moscow) and Ze’ev Litke (Jerusalem) co-authored a halakhic work titled בירורי יהדות לאור מחקרים גנטיים (Clarifying Jewish Identity by Light of Genetic Investigations) advancing the argument in favor its use. Genetic evidence is not typically utilized as stand-alone basis for affirming Jewish identity but rather as a means of corroborating other forms of evidence thought to be tenuous or weak by itself. As this <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20230204220411/https://www.timesofisrael.com/rabbinate-dna-tests-seek-jewishness-in-the-blood-become-a-bone-of-contention/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">informative article in the Times of Israel</a> characterizes the position advanced by the two rabbis:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It must strictly act as corroboration in cases where other\ndocumentation is available, and only as a last resort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Litke notes that despite the more conservative tact he and R. Barenbaum advocated for (ibid):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there have been several “unusual” cases in Israel in which some people\nhave been confirmed Jewish based on the genetic results alone</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I do not know what fact pattern in the particular border cases are that elicited such a result, nevertheless, the tact that the Israeli rabbinate seems to primarily be taking is that advanced by the authors. Which is to accept genetic evidence when considered in tangent with other forms of existing evidence (e.g. marriage/birth certificates, photos, documents of ancestors, graves, etc.) in order to confirm halakhic identity as Jew. Where the court finds that a person is Jewish, no further steps are necessary. A Jew is a Jew.</p>\n<p>However if the court deems the particular fact pattern in a case, along with whatever evidence has been presented do not lend towards such identification, giyur <em>might</em> be advised (or at times told that they are not Jewish, with no advisement being made on how to proceed, such as was initially the case with Veronika Zacharova in the aforementioned TOI article).</p>\n<p>I don't know about the situation in Brazil, but giyur lehumrah is procedurally the same as a regular conversion. Though it is performed in order to eliminate halakhic doubt, it is ultimately a conversion. Accordingly, you answer your own question - if conversions are not performed by Jewish courts in Brazil, then that includes giyur lehumrah.</p>\n<p>As for whether a particular case will necessitate giyur lehumrah depends on the nitty gritty details, totality of circumstance and the court's analysis thereof. This is true of any properly constituted Jewish court that handles conversions. As always, for practical guidance consult a competent halakhic authority.</p>\n\n\n",

(Num 16:33 Koren Bible)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What does the phrase \"descend alive into <em>Sheol</em>\" mean in this context?

For if they had not been condemned to burning, Moses would\nnot have advised them to enter into the danger of the incense. Rather,\nthey were already condemned to burning from the beginning of the\ndispute. Therefore, even Dathan and Abiram were condemned to burning,\nbut they did not want to go up to offer incense. Therefore, they\ndescended to the fire of Gehenna and were burned there, and they received\ntheir punishment. But apparently, before they descended into the fire\nof Gehenna, their souls would have already left them due to the polluted air and the\nimpact, so they would not be burned. Therefore, he prayed that they\nwould descend alive to Sheol and not die until they reached the midst\nof the flames of Gehenom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also see ביאור יש\"ר</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וירדו חיים שאלה, שלא ימותו בנפלם, אלא ישארו חיים מתחת לארץ איזה זמן\nכדי שיכירו רשעתם ואולי ינחמו מרעתם קודם מיתתם, וזה כדברי האומר שיש להם\nחלק לע\"הב ועליהם הכתוב אומר ה' ממית ומחיה מוריד שאול ויעל:</p>\n<p>\"And they will go down alive into Sheol,\" meaning that they will not die by\nfalling, but rather they will remain alive beneath the earth for a\ncertain time, so that they may recognize their wickedness and perhaps\nrepent of their evil before their death. And this accords with the opinion that they have a portion in the World to Come, and concerning\nthem it is said, 'The Lord kills and brings to life; He brings down to\nSheol and raises up.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Because it's good to eat bread at the 3rd meal but it's not an absolute obligation, as opposed to the 2 first meals.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>To answer our original question: The Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (44:14) says that one never has to repeat Benching on Rosh Chodesh if one forgets Ya'aleh VeYovoh in Benching.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>סעיף יד':\n<strong>טָעָה בְּרֹאשׁ חֹדֶשׁ וְלֹא אָמַר יַעֲלֶה וְיָבֹא</strong>, אוֹמֵר בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹקֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן רָאשֵׁי חֳדָשִׁים לְעַמּוֹ יִשְֹרָאֵל לְזִכָּרוֹן, וְאֵינוֹ חוֹתֵם (וְאֵין חִלּוּק בָּזֶה בֵּין בַּיּוֹם בֵּין בַּלָּיְלָה) וּבְחֹל הַמּוֹעֵד אִם לֹא אָמַר יַעֲלֶה וְיָבֹא יֹאמַר בָּרוּךְ אַתָה ה' אֱלֹקֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן מוֹעֲדִים לְעַמּוֹ יִשְֹרָאֵל לְשָׂשׂוֹן וּלְשִׂמְחָה אֶת יוֹם חַג (פְּלוֹנִי) הַזֶּה, בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' מְקַדֵּשׁ יִשְֹרָאֵל וְהַזְּמַנִּים. וּבְרֹאשׁ הַשָּׁנָה אוֹמֵר, בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' אֱלֹקֵינוּ מֶלֶךְ הָעוֹלָם אֲשֶׁר נָתַן יָמִים טוֹבִים לְעַמּוֹ יִשְֹרָאֵל אֶת יוֹם הַזִּכָּרוֹן הַזֶּה, בָּרוּךְ אַתָּה ה' מְקַדֵּשׁ יִשְֹרָאֵל וְיוֹם הַזִּכָּרוֹן. וְ<strong>אִם לֹא נִזְכַּר עַד לְאַחַר שֶׁהִתְחִיל הַבְּרָכָה שֶׁלְּאַחֲרֶיהָ אֵינוֹ חוֹזֵר לְרֹאשׁ מִשּׁוּם דִּבְרֹאשׁ חֹדֶשׁ וּבְחֹל הַמּוֹעֵד אֵינוֹ מְחֻיָּב לֶאֱכֹל פַּת דַּוְקָא</strong>.‏</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why?

The most similar way I think we can visualize this nowadays is “Oscilloscope Music” - it’s basically seeing sound visually (very cool to see and they are many videos where people actually make full songs and videos showing what waveform the music you listen to looks like). Seeing it this way makes it a little easier to understand, at least to me, what they “actually saw” as it’s a concept we can view ourselves and understand, whereas many generations ago it wasn’t possible and probably more difficult to comprehend how you can see sound</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראים את הקולת ואת הלפידם. כפרש״י היוצאין מפי הגבורה. ר״ל לא בקולות של\nרעמים שבא עם הברקים מיירי. אלא בקול של עשרת הדברות שהיה קול ה׳ בכח\nובהדר. ובקול יצאו ניצוצות אש ולפידים כמו אותיות הדבור. והעם ראו את\nהאותיות וכמש״כ בס׳ דברים ד׳ ט׳ ורעמים וברקים לא היו.</p>\n<p>We saw the voices and the torches, as Rashi interprets, emanating from\nthe mouth of the Almighty. Meaning, not the voices of thunder that\ncome with the lightning, but the voice of the Ten Commandments, which\nwas the voice of God with strength and splendor. And with the voice,\nsparks of fire and torches emerged like the letters of speech. And the\npeople saw the letters, as mentioned in Deuteronomy 4:9, and there\nwere no thunder and lightning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to the Alshich Hakodesh on Shir Hashirim 1:2, Hashem's breath, as it were, is unlike mortal breath, that is of no substance and quickly dissipates. The breath of Hashem is eternal and the words spoken are real entities, higher than angels, because they are intrinsically part of Hashem, so to speak. Angels, are created <em>from</em> His words.</p>\n<p>He quotes the Midrash Rabba 1:13 which brings a discussion about what happened, and basically the conclusion is that Hashem spoke the words, and angels brought them to each individual Jew. The words were not visible, but the angels were, and the Jews could see <em>how</em> the words spoke. The words Hashem spoke here are the mitzvot and all their details, and the angel asked the Jew if they accept them and Hashem's Oneness. Then when the Jew did, the Jew was elevated to a higher level, where the word itself would kiss the Jew.</p>\n<p>So, according to this opinion, the Jews saw the angels who brought the words of Hashem to them. The words are higher entities than angels, although they themselves were not visible, they could be seen as they were spoken by the angel, and it is clear that this experience was above nature so it wouldn't really be possible to picture it or give it any more of a description than we have above.</p>\n\n\n",

In חו''ל this year פסח was observed on Tuesday and Wednesday, necessarily the result of a ספיקא דיומא whether ר\"ח ניסן ought to be on Tuesday or Wednesday. However ר\"ח ניסן was observed on Tuesday only...</p>\n<p>So how is it that following almost every חסר month we are satisfied with one ר\"ח and one מוסף, even though the ספיקא דיומא element is no less than any other month?</p>\n<p>This is especially confusing now that we have a calendar. Surely either we now know everything, or we act as if we know nothing. Why do we keep alternating?</p>\n<p>The mishnah in ערכין פרק ב' discusses the guidelines by which beis din would decide when to set Rosh Chodesh.\nThe ספק element is for those at a distance who don't know what beis din decided.\nThis doubt must have ended with the advent of the calendar. For some reason the חכמים saw it necessary to maintain that, and only every other month, despite there being no danger of coming to eat חמץ on pesach (תחילת גמ' ביצה).</p>\n<p>To be clearer, I'm not asking why months are sometimes 29 or 30 days. I'm asking why it's necessary to call any day besides the 1st of the month, \"Rosh Chodesh\".</p>\n<p>To be fair, the Rambam addresses this. He writes:\nואם היה החודש שעבר מלא, יהיה יום שלושים ראש חודש, <em>הואיל ומקצתו ראש חודש</em> , ויהיה תשלום החודש המלא שעבר.</p>\n<p>This is very challenging to understand. Whatever it means, and I don't pretend to know, it wasn't a reason to bring two קרבנות מוסף, yet it clearly is a reason to daven twice תפילת מוסף.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why did Moshe state \"I didn't even ask for a donkey\"\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In parashat Korach, Moshe states that I didn't even ask these people for a donkey. Why would he say that?\nDonkey was the range rover of the time and was something valuable. If moshe wanted to say that I didn't borrow anything, he should have said \"I didn't even asked them for a Perutah or a penny\" not something expensive.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Rashi based on the Medrash Tanchuma says it was a reference to when he going from Midyan to Mitzroyim and put his wife and children on a donkey. Even then when he travelling for public purposes he paid his own costs and did not ask them for a donkey. Rashi (second explanation) , The Rashbam and the Ramban say he specified a donkey because that is something that is (was) normal for  kings to take (took) from their  citizens for their personal use. Moshe was giving it as example of how he wasn't looking to be or act like a king. Kings do not demand trivial items that are of little value from  their citizens. The Seperno translates the posuk as saying he didn't take  a donkey as a <em>borrowed item</em>.</p>\n<p>Note: Shmuel Hanavi said something very similar. Shmuel I 12:3 אֶת-שׁוֹר מִי לָקַחְתִּי וַחֲמוֹר מִי לָקַחְתִּי. Rashi and the Rishonim there explain that  he was making almost the exact same point. \"I did not use their donkeys even when I was on official business, I did not take donkeys from them like all other kings do. \"</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Indeed, when King Ptolemy of Egypt forced 72 Elders of Israel to translate the Torah into Greek, each independently, they all tacitly agreed to make certain changes to avoid misunderstandings [Megillah 9a-b, Soferim 1:8].  One of these changes was:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Instead of Moses saying “I have not taken one donkey [ḥamor] from them” [Numbers 16:15], they wrote “I have not taken one item of value [ḥemed] from them”; to avoid giving the impression that Moses may have taken other items.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He saw the revelation at Mount Sinai, where Hashem revealed Himself through fire, lightning, angels etc, for the specific reason that's explicitly mentioned in the verse:</p>\n<p>\"In order that they believe in you (Moshe) forever\".</p>\n<p>Surely Hashem knew what He was doing, and if that revelation is enough even for all future generations to believe in Moshe (according to what Hashem said), then all the more so it should be enough to influence the people who actually say saw it directly to believe in Moshe.</p>\n<p>So, was Korach denying the Torah, or was he making some other argument?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>In addition to what @RabbiKaii said \"This argument comes out in what Korach was saying. \"Why do you need a single mezuza, when you have a house full of books?\" i.e. why do you need one leader, when you have a nation of leaders!\", I would like to share some other insights.</p>\n<p>The mitzvah of the parah adumah was the only mitzvah that even Shlomo HaMelech - the wisest of all (1 Melachim 5:11; Midrash Tanchuma, Emor 20; Orchos Tzadikim, Introduction) - did not know what it meant.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Moshe Wolfson, in the sefer Emunas Itecha  cites a fascinating explanation of the Yismach Moshe, Rabbi  Moshe Teitelbaum of Ujhel (c. 1790- c. 1840). The Yismach Moshe cites a unknown Midrash that asks what moved Korach to rebel against Moshe Rabbeinu. The Midrash says: “פרשת פרה אדומה ראה”- Korach saw the parsha of the parah adumah.</p>\n<p>The Yismach Moshe indeed says that since Korach was wise, and knew what the rational behind the parah adumah was, he thought that, since he possessed this wisdom, he was in the same league as Moshe. He could be like Moshe. He could lead the nation amongst others. Why single out Moshe and Aharon? Why not all people? \"We are all Holy\", said Korach. Meaning, we all have the ability to lead the people.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Good question. Many of the <em>mefarshim</em> take a particular approach in answering this question, and the Lubavitcher Rebbe puts them together in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/2613621/jewish/Likkutei-Sichot-Korach.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a <em>sicha</em></a>.</p>\n<p>Korach specifically waited to bring his argument after they had reached Eretz Yisrael (and turned back due to the sin of the spies). Why?</p>\n<p>Until now, Benei Yisrael were in a heirarchy. There was Moshe and Aharon at the top, closest to Hashem, who were outstanding in their greatness, their intellect, their character traits. It was due to this greatness that they deserved to be at the top. It was indeed of necessity, as the children of Israel were like innocent children, in need of the guidance of these leaders.</p>\n<p>However, the point of coming out of Egypt was not to remain in the desert, learning Torah <em>forever</em>. In fact, that's not correct; the point of learning Torah is in order to actually live in the land, and perform the mitzvot, translating the learning into action and deed. And this is the point:</p>\n<p>When it comes to doing a mitzva, every Jew is on the same level. I.e. Every Jew's mitzva is equally holy, and great.</p>\n<p><strong>Korach therefore was arguing that it doesn't make sense anymore to have a single, outstanding leader - what does that achieve? The destination of the Jews is to go and <em>do</em> the <em>mitzvot</em>, and in that state we will all be equal.</strong></p>\n<p>This argument comes out in what Korach was saying. \"Why do you need a <em>single</em> mezuza, when you have a house full of books?\" i.e. why do you need one leader, when you have a nation of leaders! \"Why do you need a single strand of blue on your tzitzit <em>if the whole garment is blue</em>\" i.e. if we are all holy, why do we need you to rule over us as \"extra\" holy? It's ridiculous and that's why he laughed.</p>\n<p>He was wrong, as the lesson is that the mitzva itself is indeed equally holy for everyone, but the kavana that goes behind the mitzva is also of importance. Therefore, an outstanding leader like Moshe does indeed accomplish more for Hashem's plan when he does a mitzva.</p>\n<p>Some mefarshim even say that Korach is right - but it's not the time yet.

The Gemera says that one of the things a father is obligated to do is teach his son trade (which the Gemera later on 82a and 82b says should be an easy and clean trade). Rebbi Yehudah says if one doesn't teach him trade it's like teaching him banditry. Rashi explains that since he has no profession and will lack sustenance, he will go to the crossroads and rob people. Not only is this an obligation on the father but we can also say that this is a tremendous chesed that a) the father does so that it's a safe world, b) his children don't do terrible aveirot by stealing and cheating. So now instead of the father teaching them himself and sending them to school, the teachers become a \"shaliach\" of the father to accomplish both goals which is a chesed and they would probably get rewarded for the good they are doing in the world, even though they get paid.</p>\n\n\n",

If he cannot find a reason or a motivating rationale for a practice, he should not regard it lightly. Nor should he break through to ascend to God, lest God burst forth against him. One's thoughts concerning them should not be like his thoughts concerning other ordinary matters. See how severe the Torah rules concerning misappropriating sacred property. Now if wood, stones, earth, and ash become holy because the name of the Lord of the world was called upon them through speech alone and anyone who treats them as ordinary articles violates the prohibition against me'ilah and even if he acted unknowingly, he is required to secure atonement, how much more so with regard to the mitzvot which God ordained for us should a person not treat them derisively, because he does not understand their rationale. He should not conjure up matters that are not true concerning God, nor should he think about them with his mind as he would ordinary matters. For Leviticus 19:37 states: \"And you shall guard all My decrees and all My judgments and perform them.\" Our Sages commented:This adjures us to guard and perform both the decrees and the judgments. The meaning of \"performing\" is well known, i.e,. that one should observe the decrees. \"Guarding\" means to treat them with caution and not think that they are any less than the judgments.The judgments are those mitzvot whose motivating rationale is openly revealed and the benefit of their observance in this world is known, e.g., the prohibitions against robbery and bloodshed and honoring one's father and mother. The decrees are the mitzvot whose motivating rationales are not known. Our Sages said: \"I ordained decrees and you have no license to question them.\" A person's natural inclination confronts him concerning them and the nations of the world challenge them, e.g., the prohibition of the meat of a pig, milk and meat, the calf whose neck is broken, the red heifer, and the goat sent to Azazel. To what degree did King David suffer because of the heretics and the idolaters who would issue challenges concerning the decrees! As long as they would pursue him with false retorts that they would arrange according to man's limited knowledge, he would increase his clinging to the Torah, as Psalms 119:69 states: \"Willful transgressors have stacked falsehoods against me, but I guard Your precepts with a full heart.\" And ibid.:86 states concerning this matter: \"All of Your mitzvot are faithful; they pursue me with falsehood; help me.\" All of the sacrifices are in the category of decrees. Our Sages said: \"The world exists for the sake of the service of the sacrifices.\" For through the performance of the decrees and the judgments the righteous merit the life of the world to come. And between the two of them, the Torah gave precedence to the command for the decrees, as Leviticus 18:5 states: \"And you shall heed My decrees and judgments which a person will perform and live through them.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The reason that I posit that the Rambam holds that Meilah itself is a mishpat is because it's a stretch/circular to derive a kal v'chomer that tells us to take chukim seriously from a mitzva which itself is a chok (and thus something which I may not take seriously).</strong></p>\n<p>It's thus necessary to say that meilah makes rational sense and that as a result of probing it for ultimate purpose and sense (as I am urged to do) I will realize that I can derive a kal v'chomer from Meilah to a wholly different set of mitzvot - chukim - a series of mitzvot that make no rational sense.</p>\n\n\n",

The passage focuses on\npaternal lineage for the census, likely due to the patriarchal\nstructure of the time. However, it doesn't negate the concept of\nmatrilineal descent established elsewhere in Jewish tradition.</p>\n<p>In traditional Judaism, lineage for determining Jewish identity is\ntraced through the mother. This is known as matrilineal descent. If\nyour mother is Jewish, you are considered Jewish as well. If your\nfather is Jewish but your mother is not, you are not considered Jewish\naccording to traditional halakha (Jewish law).</p>\n<p>Rabbinic interpretations of several passages in the Torah are used to\nsupport matrilineal descent in Judaism. Here are two examples:</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy 7:3-4: This passage warns against intermarriage and its\npotential consequence of turning one's children away from following\nGod's teachings. The Talmud interprets the emphasis on \"your son\" in\nthe context of a Jewish mother as implying that only children of\nJewish mothers are considered inherently part of the covenant.</p>\n<p>Exodus 21:4: This verse speaks of a Hebrew slave who is freed. If he\nhas a Canaanite wife during his slavery, his children remain enslaved.\nThis is interpreted to mean that the children's status follows their\nmother's non-Jewish status.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The above citations are to places where it's clear that the Heh isn't a suffix meaning direction (to [place X]) but rather part of the root of the toponym itself, along with examples of the same toponyms without a final Heh.</p>\n<p>Ben-Tzion Eshel, 'Dialects and Pronunciations according to Biblical Names' (להגים והגיות לפי שמות שבמקרא), in: Menachem Haran and Ben-Tzion Luria (eds.), <em>Sefer Tur-Sinai</em>, Jerusalem 5720, pp. 263-264 concluded based on the above list (along with several other examples) that the affixed Heh was born from a Hebraic tendency to elongate or drag out the pronunciation of some words (compare certain English dialects such as the American southern drawl).</p>\n<p>In other words, יהצה was at the same time both יהצה and יהץ, largely dependent on the speaker. Given that it is more commonly referred to as יהצה, it's possible that more Israelites referred to it as יהצה. However, it seems that the version יהץ (Yahatz) was the one used by the local Moabites: In the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesha_Stele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mesha Stele</a>, the form יהצ appears twice (see <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A6%D7%91%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A2#:%7E:text=19.%20%D7%99%D7%94%D7%A6.%20%D7%95%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%91.%20%D7%91%D7%94.%20%D7%91%D7%94%D7%9C%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%94.%20%D7%91%D7%99%20%7C%20%D7%95%D7%99%D7%92%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%94.%20%D7%9B%D7%9E%D7%A9.%20%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%A0%D7%99%20%7C%20%D7%95%0A20.%20%D7%90%D7%A7%D7%97.%20%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%91.%20%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%9F.%20%D7%90%D7%A9.%20%D7%9B%D7%9C.%20%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%94%20%7C%20%D7%95%D7%90%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%94.%20%D7%91%D7%99%D7%94%D7%A5.%20%D7%95%D7%90%D7%97%D7%96%D7%94.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). While the starting point of usage of <em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_lectionis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mater lectionis</a></em> (<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%90%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">אימות הקריאה</a>) among both Moabites, Israelites and other contemporary Hebrew-dialect-speaking ethnic groups is highly debatable, it seems likely that the Moabite scribe of the inscription intended Yahatz rather than Yahatzah (with an \"invisible\" final Heh, the /a/ sound at the end merged into the final letter Tzadi). Evidence for this likely pronunciation comes from other toponyms and names in general in the inscription that show that Moabites did use Heh as an affix: Davidoh (דודה), Nevoh (נבה = Nevo - נבו), Korchah (קרחה), etc. Given that, it seems that were the Moabite pronunciation (or at least that of the 9th century BCE) had been Yahatzah (יהצה), they would have included a final Heh.</p>\n<p>Some suppose that יהצה (and other names with a final Heh) is a more archaic form that was gradually filtered out of spoken language, until finally it was only preserved in textual traditions.<sup>1</sup> We do not know how the Moabites pronounced יהצה/יהץ prior to the 9th century, but it's possible that the appearance of יהצ in 9th century Moav reflects the beginning of the transition from יהצה to יהץ among Hebraic people.</p>\n<p>This is a phenomenon often known as ניוון השפה (the degeneracy of the language). Over the centuries and millennia we find a significant expansion of this phenomenon in the Hebrew used by Israelites/Jews. For example, by the time Targum Onkelos was created, elongated pronunciation was less common in Hebrew (and Hebrew in general was used less on a daily basis). In fact, we find more and more of the reverse phenomenon: The syncopated Heh, whereby a final Heh or a definitive Heh (ה\"א הידיעה) was \"swallowed\" up by the preceding letter, leading to more condensed pronunciations. This phenomenon was born out of the development of a faster colloquial manner of speaking.<sup>2</sup> Especially in Eretz Yisrael we find that by the time of Chazal, fast, condensed colloquial pronunciations were very widespread. A good example of this is the fact that in the Yerushalmi the names אלעזר (Elazar) and אליעזר (Eliezer) are usually spelled לעזר (Lazar) and ליעזר (Liezer), and יהודה (Yehudah) is usually spelled יודן (Yudan).<sup>3</sup></p>\n<p>So, in response to the question of the city's name: It was both יהץ and יהצה, depending on who used the toponym, and when. However, it is important to note that the version יהצה occasionally featured a final Heh as a directive, i.e., \"to Yahatz(ah)\" can be written either as ליהץ or יהצה.

Specifically not lishma from honour. What I mean is, while it’s impossible to know one’s true intentions, you can sometimes “tell” that someone is just doing it for honour and Im wondering if you can learn from such a person</p>\n<p>This question is based on the principle that one should not learn Torah from a heretic (lehavdil) and the story with Rabbi Meir and Acher and how he was able to learn from him because he could pick out the good and throw out the bad but not everyone can do that. We learn that Torah is not just about the knowledge that is transmitted it’s also about the receptacle from which it is being transmitted. Therefore I feel the question of learning from someone who is only learning for the sake of honour (they want to boast their knowledge even at the expense of putting other people down) may have some source but I haven’t found anything</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Obviously if one has a choice, he follows the best possible teacher who \"is like an angel\" (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/108997/how-should-a-rabbi-resemble-an-angel\">explanations here</a>). Ribbi Meir says that one is allowed to study from an imperfect teacher, since he is learning not \"his (the teacher's) wisdom, but My (Hashem's) wisdom\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chagigah.15b.6-7\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hagigah 15b</a>).</p>\n<p>Although I don't have a source for this particular case of not <em>lishma</em>, there is a source for something worse.</p>\n<p>One is not allowed to charge for teaching the oral torah, but if one cannot find a teacher who will teach him for free he should pay (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhorot.29a.7-8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">B'chorot 29a</a>).</p>\n<p>This is even though this teacher is not following the law himself.

But if you have bad midot and learn Torah it will be even more destructive because Torah learning on its own has power, and whichever way you lead it that’s where you go.

The commentaries from here learned that it is good practice to act in this manner and if two people are really having this argument (whether financial or otherwise) for the sake of heaven then this is the way they should act to prove that they are really only after the “Dvar Hashem” and not to fight to prove that he is right</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Wow B”H I found the answer after some extensive research Baruch Hashem!

A better source would be <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Taanit.5b.11-12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Taanit 5b</a>, where one thanks a tree, but its only used as an example to thank another person so I don't think that's a good proof.

One can argue that this is even worse since the AI cannot be an idol worshipper whereas non-Jews are assumed to be.

So from this there is no indication that one should actively thank the inanimate object which helped him.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There is what to say for the importance of one working on his middot and not letting himself to be trained in a negative middah (such as ungratefulness). This idea is demonstrated by the story with R' Shimon Ben Shatach telling his son not to switch what he was asking his wife for so as not to train himself in falsehood (if anyone has the source for this story I'm happy to add it in bl\"n).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>There are many articles discussing the amount of resources wasted as a result of saying please and thank you and being polite in wording to AI. It seems that we should not be proactively advocating to do so if not necessary or positive in a spiritual way.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Putting all of these together: as there is no demonstrated requirement to actually verbalize the thanks, it would be enough to think the appreciation, thereby maintaining your middot while not wasting resources.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# When is 40 years before the destruction of the 2nd Temple?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>We read in the Jerusalem Talmud:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Forty years before the destruction of the Temple, the western light\nwent out, the crimson thread remained crimson, and the lot for the\nLord always came up in the left hand. They would close the gates of\nthe Temple by night and get up in the morning and find them wide open\"\n(Jacob Neusner, The Yerushalmi, p.156-157).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>A similar passage in the Babylonian Talmud states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Our rabbis taught: During the last forty years before the destruction\nof the Temple the lot ['For the Lord'] did not come up in the right\nhand; nor did the crimson-colored strap become white; nor did the\nwestern most light shine; and the doors of the Hekel [Temple] would\nopen by themselves\" (Soncino version, Yoma 39b).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The 2nd Temple was destroyed in 70 CE August on Tisha B'Av. So when is 40 years before it? Was it 30 CE or 31 CE? Those who favor 31 CE say that Jews generally count the first year as well.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>עבודה זרה ט ע\"ב <a href=\"https://kodesh.snunit.k12.il/b/l/l4701_009b.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>records</strong></a> that the year 4231 לבה״ע (*not accounting for שנת תוהו which adds 1) was THREE years later than \"FOUR HUNDRED years after the Temple's destruction\", which means that the destruction of the Temple must have occurred in 4231 - 403 years = 3828 לבה״ע.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>​אמר רבי חנינא: \"אחר ארבע מאות לחורבן הבית, אם יאמר לך אדם 'קח שדה שוה אלף דינרים בדינר אחד'—לא תקח!\" במתניתא תנא: \"אחר ארבעת אלפים ומאתים ושלשים ואחת שנה לבריאת עולם, אם יאמר לך אדם 'קח לך שדה שוה אלף דינרים בדינר אחד'—אל תקח!\" מאי בינייהו? איכא בינייהו תלת שנין דמתניתא טפיא תלת שני׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*However, the Jewish calendar actually begins almost a full year BEFORE the creation of Man, because אדם הראשון is considered to have been created on 1st <em>Tishri</em> of Year 2, the first five of the ששת ימי בראשית being deemed as the last five days of <em>Ellul</em> of Year 1 - known as the Void Year (שנת תוהו, because all but its last six days were before anything existed) - following the principle \"יום אחד בשנה חשוב שנה\" (e.g. ראש השנה ב ע\"ב, נידה מה ע\"א).</p>\n<p>And Hebrew dates exceed the corresponding civil dates by 3760 years for dates between the beginning of January and the end of אלול (the difference is 3761 years from the beginning of תשרי to the end of December), so it follows that the Temple was destroyed in the summer of 3828 + 1 − 3760 years = 69 CE. And 40 years before <em>that</em> would have been 3789 by our calendar or 29 CE.</p>\n\n\n",

The Rebbe talks about this in Maamar VeAtat Tetzaveh, 5741. He also quotes the Rebbe Raayatz in the Mamaar \"VeKibeil HaYehudim\". It is explained that:</p>\n<p>a) a faithful shepherd of the Jewish people means that he faithfully tends to the needs of the Jewish people\nb) a shepherd of faith means that he sustains and nurtures the faith of the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Both terms apply to the description of Moshe Rabbeinu as the \"raaya mehemna\".</p>\n<p>However, I found something interesting.</p>\n<p>The Chida, in his Pnei David, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Penei_David%2C_Numbers%2C_Pinchas.7.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">writes</a> that the meaning of the posuk \"Let the L-rd, the G-d of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation\" is that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is possible that the manner of the leader is that he goes ahead of the people, whereas the manner of a shepherd is that he follows the flock. Our Sages, may their memory be blessed, have also said this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Chida goes on to quote different meforshim that say that our posuk, al-pi-peshat, refers to when the people are going out to war. Then they need a leader.</p>\n<p>Based on the idea that a leader goes \"ahead of the people\", whereas a shepherd \"follows his flock\". How can we interpret Moshe's plea to G-d that the Jewish people? It would seem that they need someone like Moshe, like tending his flock, and not leading people in case of war.</p>\n<p>They needed someone who nurtures the faith, and not prepare them for war. Right? Any ideas on this?</p>\n\n\n",

Their effort is truely remarkable because only because of them and other righteous women we had true shvatim coming out of the Egyptian bondage.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of one was Shifra and the name of the other was Pu’a” (Exodus 1:15).</p>\n<p>When he saw that they were procreating, he issued a decree against the males  – that is what is written: “The king of Egypt said to the midwives….” Who were the midwives? Rav said: A daughter-in-law and her mother-in-law, Yokheved and Elisheva daughter of Aminadav. Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥman says: A woman and her daughter, Yokheved and Miriam.</p>\n<p>And Miriam was no more than five years old, as Aaron was three years older than Moses. Our Rabbis, of blessed memory, said: She would go with her mother Yokheved and assist her, and she was very quick. While the child is still young, his [character] is recognizable. That is what Solomon said: “Even a lad is recognized through his deeds” (Proverbs 20:11).</p>\n<p>“…the name of one was Shifra [and the name of the other was Pu’a],” because she would attend to [meshaperet] the baby when he would emerge covered in blood; “Pu’a,” because she would express [nofa’at] wine into the babies after her mother [had attended to them].</p>\n<p>Alternatively, Shifra, because Israel procreated [sheparu veravu] in her day; Pu’a, who would revive [mapia] the baby when they would say it was dead.\nAlternatively, Shifra, because she made her actions pleasing [shipera] before God; Pu’a, because she caused Israel to appear [hofia] before God. Alternatively, Pu’a, because she was impudent [hofia panim] to Pharaoh and had her nose in the air toward him, and she said to him: ‘Woe unto that man when God will come and punish him.’ He became filled with fury and sought to kill her. Shifra, because she eased [meshaperet] the words of her daughter and placated him toward her. She said to him: ‘Are you paying attention to her? She is a child and knows nothing.’</p>\n<p>Rabbi Ḥanina bar Rav Yitzḥak said: Shifra, because she preserved Israel for God, and it was for their sake that the heavens were created, regarding which it is written: “By his wind the heavens are calm [shifra]” (Job 26:13). Pu’a, because she was impudent [hofia panim] toward her father. Amram was the head of the Sanhedrin at that time. Once Pharaoh issued his decree and said: “Every son that is born you shall cast him into the Nile” (Exodus 1:22), Amram said: ‘Isn’t Israel begetting children for naught?’ Immediately, he separated from Yokheved and abstained from sexual relations. He divorced his wife when she was three months pregnant. All Israel arose and divorced their wives. His daughter said to him: ‘Your decree is harsher than Pharaoh’s, as Pharaoh decreed only against the males, and you, against the males and the females. Pharaoh is wicked and it is uncertain whether his decree will be fulfilled or whether it will not be fulfilled. However, you are righteous and your decree will be fulfilled.’ He arose and remarried his wife.

As it is written: “The name of one was Shifra and the name of the second was Pu’a” (Exodus 1:15). Shifra, this is Yokheved, who would tend to [mishaperet] the children. Alternatively, it is because she procreated [shepara verava]. Alternatively, it is because the Israelites procreated due to her. Alternatively, it is because they bettered [shiperu] [the Israelite women] with mitzvot and good deeds. Alternatively, Shifra [is the name given her] as praise [of her character], as it is stated: “With His breath the heavens were calmed [shifra]” (Job 26:13).\nPu’a, this is Miriam, as she would make a comforting sound [po’a] to the woman, and the child would emerge. Alternatively, Pu’a, as she would cry [po’a] and weep over her brother Moses who was cast into the Nile, as it is stated: “His sister stood at a distance” (Exodus 2:4). Alternatively, Pu’a, as she revealed [hofia] the actions of her brother. Alternatively, as she stood boldly [pa’at] before Pharaoh and said to him: ‘Woe to you on the Day of Judgment.’</p>\n<p><strong>It is taught: A man is called by three names; one that his father and his mother called him, one that others called him, and one that he is called in the book of his lineage.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Don Yitzchak Abarbanel (ad loc) explains that midwifery consisted of a pair, with each midwife possessing a unique and complementary skill.</p>\n<p>He explains that 'Shifra' and 'Puah' were not proper names but rather were terms that denoted these specific skillsets (similar to Chazal).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה המילדות א\"א שנאמר שהיו שתים בלבד כי איך יספיקו שתי נשים לעם כבד ועצום כבני ישראל ואין לומר שהיו שתים אלא שרות המילדות כלן כדברי המפרשים כי היה ראוי שיקראם הכתוב שרות המילדות כמו שר המשקים ושר האופים ושר הטבחים גם כי מה הועיל פרעה בתקנתו לדבר זה לשרות ההנה אם לא יצוה כן למשרתות שלהן וגם שלא צוה להן שתצוינה זה למילדו' אשר תחתיהן אלא שהענין כך הוא שהיה מנהג במצרים שהיו באות שתים מילדות לעמוד עם כל אשה שהיתה יולדת והאחת מהן היה עסקה בהוצאת הולד ובשכלולו ולכן נקראת שפרה ע\"ש שמשפיר' את הולד. והשנית היה עסקה להחזיק ביולדת ולעוזרה בדברים וקולות ותפלות ולכן נקראת פועה מלשון כיולדה אפעה.\nואמר שדבר פרעה למילדות העבריות – ר\"ל לכולנה כי לא אמר לשתי המילדו' אלא לפי שלכל המילדו' הרבות ההנה דבר וצוה זה וכלן היו נחלקות לשתי אומניות ההם וזה אמרו ששם האחת שפרה ושם השנית פועה. ולא היו עבריות כי איך יבטח לבו בנשים העבריות שימיתו ולדיהן אבל היו מצריות מילדות את העבריות ר\"ל עוזרות אותן ללדת כמ\"ש בילדכן את העבריות.</p>\n<p>\"And behold, the midwives cannot be said to be only two, for how could two women suffice for such a heavy and numerous people as the children of Israel? And one cannot say that there were only two, for the midwives were all in charge, as explained by the commentators, for it would have been fitting for the text to call them the head midwives, like the cupbearer, the baker, and the chief cook. Moreover, what benefit did Pharaoh gain from this decree to speak of the head midwives if he did not command this also for their servants? And he did not command them to kill the children that were under them. Rather, the matter is such that there was a custom in Egypt for two midwives to come to attend to each woman giving birth, one of whom was occupied with delivering the child and assisting it, and therefore she was called Shifra, because she beautifies the birth. The second was responsible for holding the mother and assisting her with words and cries and prayers, and thus she was called Puah, from the language of ‘to help the birthing woman.’</p>\n<p>And it is said that Pharaoh spoke to the Hebrew midwives—meaning to all of them—because he did not say to the two midwives, but rather to all the many midwives, that this is what he commanded and all of them were divided into those two professions. This is why it is said that the name of one was Shifra and the name of the second was Puah. And they were not Hebrew women, for how could he trust his heart in Hebrew women that they would kill their children? Rather, they were Egyptian women who assisted the Hebrews, meaning they helped them to give birth, as it is said, ‘when you help the Hebrew women.’\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(There is considerable dispute amongst the commentaries as to if the midwives were Jewish or not.</p>\n<p>Don Abarbanel holds that they were not, see Shadal at length)</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps most famously, Rashi <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Genesis.1.1.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">writes</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שֶׁאֵין לְךָ רֵאשִׁית בַּמִּקְרָא שֶׁאֵינוֹ דָבוּק לַתֵּבָה שֶׁלְּאַחֲרָיו</p>\n<p>Because, wherever the word ראשית occurs in Scripture, it is in the construct state</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, this seems not to be true. Ibn Ezra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.1.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">points out</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויש אומרים כי בראשית לעולם סמוך והטעם בראשית הערב או הלילה או החשך והנה שכחו וירא ראשית לו</p>\n<p>Other scholars maintain that the word bereshit is always in the construct and its meaning in our verse is: “In the beginning of the evening, or of the night, or of the darkness.” However, they have overlooked And he chose a first part (reshit) for himself (Deuteronomy 33:21).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I can add Lev 2:12 (קרבן ראשית תקריבו אתם לה׳), Is 46:10 (מגיד מראשית אחרית), Ps 105:36 (ראשית לכל־אונם), and Neh 12:44 (על־הנשכות לאוצרות לתרומות לראשית ולמעשרות), all of which (apparently) have ראשית in absolute form, not construct form. I can add some examples of אחרית, which I imagine would be a similar pattern to ראשית: Jer 29:11 (לתת לכם אחרית ותקוה), Ps 37:37 (כי־אחרית לאיש שלום), Prov 23:18 (כי אם־יש אחרית), Prov 24:14 (ויש אחרית), Prov 24:20 (כי לא־תהיה אחרית לרע).</p>\n<p>Is there anyone who defends Rashi (and those who agree) and explains all of these examples as actually being in construct? I'd rather not have to ask about each example individually, so if there is one place that discusses all (or many) of these examples, that'd be great.</p>\n\n\n",

E.g. when a person breaks Shabbos, eats non-Kosher food, or has illicit relations, no immediate and direct Godly retribution is observed, because otherwise, free will would be revoked, a person would turn into a puppet, and the idea of Heavenly reward and punishment would be invalidated.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, God explicitly commands us, humans, to establish a system of courts and police with tight surveillance and harsh and dreadful punishments, e.g. (Deut 17):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the man that will act presumptuously, and will not hearken to the priest that stands to minister there before thy God, or to the judge, <strong>that man shall die</strong>: and thou shalt put away the evil from Yisra᾽el.<br />\n<strong>And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously</strong>.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, a powerful and properly functioning legal system that enforces Biblical laws represents the opposite of the cultivation of personal free will.</p>\n<p>The Talmud advocates for a similar approach in educating children about Torah and Mitzvot, emphasizing corporal punishment as a means to instill a deep-rooted aversion to sin through learned behavior.</p>\n<p>How do our sources deal with this contradiction?</p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>N.B. I understand that historically, the idea of free will was developed in the times when Jewish Sanhedrins ceased to exist under Roman rule, and Jewish transgressors were left to the \"Heavenly court\". I would only like to see if any pro-free-will commentators noticed this contradiction.</em></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is an attempt to answer based on my understanding (and as I can tell from the comments, the understanding of other as well)</p>\n<p>The concept of free choice means that it is a person has the freedom to choose his actions and is not forced by anyone to choose one way or the other.</p>\n<p>Having a court system that imposes death penalties, lashes or fines can act as deterrences but they do not force someone to act a certain way.</p>\n<p>On a side note, just to address some of the points made in by the OP</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the sifrei mussar say that the reason Hashem doesn't punish immediately at time of transgression is to give the transgression time and ability to repent (sources to follow)</li>\n<li>most transgressions do not carry death penalties, and no lashes exist when one does not observe מצוות עשה. Even when punishments can be given by bais din, one needs witnesses and warnings.

For example, Hashem creates it that the <em>yeitzer hara</em> is more attracted to the forbidden, and finds it harder to do good that is expected vs. good \"that comes from the heart\". This contradicts what we might think, that forbidding something makes it harder for people to choose, or demanding something makes it easier for them.</p>\n<p>Another way Hashem ensures free will is by equalizing pleasure. If only good things \"tasted good\", we would have no trouble being good and avoiding evil. However, it is not like that, and as above, sometimes the forbidden tastes better!</p>\n<p>I don't think we need to have a very analytical answer as to how Hashem ensures free will. His ways are too numerous and holistic for us to fathom, not that we can fathom His vast thoughts in general!</p>\n<p>I will note though that the Lubavitcher Rebbe makes a very related point - we are living in a time where there is very little \"pressure\" to do the right thing. This is unprecedented in Jewish History, whether it be that we were on the Land seeing open miracles, or living in Ghettoes where being religious was the ticket to good business and shidduchim for our children, there has, until today, always been something detracting from our good deeds being \"<em>lishma</em>\".</p>\n<p>The whole of history has been a gradual \"letting go\" of our hand from Hashem, letting us learn to crawl and then walk and seeing how we can behave \"by ourself\", to get a true measure of our goodness through giving us \"truer and truer\" free will.</p>\n<p>We can trace this from the point of the Megilla, that Hashem's name is not mentioned, and all miracles are \"hidden\", so as not to provide \"supernatural pressure\" on us to be good. This state of affairs was so lofty and beneficial, we are described as \"only then\" having truly accepted the Torah, due to our great response to those challenges.</p>\n<p>We can even trace it further back still, and there are sichot that we were initially given a chance to play around with our freedom before the flood, and look what we did. After that, we were more restrained in our freedom by witnessing great leaders, miracles etc. The goal was to refine us internally, with the end result that we should have our hands \"let go\" again towards the end of history, and we will see that indeed, we have changed and become good deep down.</p>\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> So, this answer is basically saying that no, it is not a contradiction, it does indeed affect our free will. However, Hashem has ways of balancing that out, and even if not, there is a purpose to our free will being more restrained at certain times, and more \"truly free\" at other times.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Per Rashi in Genesis, who were the Nefilim?",
    "content": "# Per Rashi in Genesis, who were the Nefilim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah states (Genesis 6:4):</p>\n<p>הַנְּפִלִ֞ים הָי֣וּ בָאָ֘רֶץ֮ בַּיָּמִ֣ים הָהֵם֒ וְגַ֣ם אַֽחֲרֵי־כֵ֗ן אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָבֹ֜אוּ בְּנֵ֤י הָֽאֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽאָדָ֔ם וְיָלְד֖וּ לָהֶ֑ם הֵ֧מָּה הַגִּבֹּרִ֛ים אֲשׁר מֵעוֹלָ֖ם אַנְשֵׁ֥י הַשֵּֽׁם׃ {פ}\nIt was then, and later too, that the Nephilim appeared on earth—when divine beings cohabited with the human women, who bore them offspring. Such were the heroes of old, the men of renown.</p>\n<p>Rashi -\nהנפלים. עַל שֵׁם שֶׁנָּפְלוּ וְהִפִּילוּ אֶת הָעוֹלָם, וּבְלָשׁוֹן עִבְרִית לְשׁוֹן עֲנָקִים הוּא: THE GIANTS — Thy were called נפילים because they fell (נפלו) and caused the downfall of (הפילו) the world (Genesis Rabbah 26:7).</p>\n<p>Are these two different interpretations? Let's focus on the first one.</p>\n<p><em>if we accept the premise that Rashi holds that these Nefilim were prior-angels who fell from heaven. (see further)</em> several questions emerge.</p>\n<p>Rashi Bamidbar 13:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנפילים. עֲנָקִים, מִבְּנֵי שַׁמְחָזַאי וַעֲזָאֵל שֶׁנָּפְלוּ מִן הַשָּׁמַיִם בִּימֵי דּוֹר אֱנוֹשׁ\nthe giants: Heb. נְפִילִים, giants, descended from Shamhazai (Nidah 61a) and Azael (Yoma 67b), who fell (שֶׁנָּפְלוּ) from heaven in the generation of Enosh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Rashi in numbers is telling us that the Nefilim spotted by the spies were descendants of fallen angels. Thus, again, it may be fair to say that when Nefilim are mentioned for the very first time in Genesis without the word \"sons,\" it is a reference to those original fallen angels.</p>\n<p><strong>Then Rashi in Genesis explains the next part of the verse which follows the phrase 'who bore them offspring' (\"such were ... men of renown\") - presumably he will 1) elaborate on how/why the offspring of the fallen angels were men of renown or 2) further identify the fallen angels as to how/why they were men of renown ... <strong>but instead:</strong></strong></p>\n<p>אנשי השם. אוֹתָן שֶׁנִּקְּבוּ בְשֵׁמוֹת עִירָד מְחוּיָאֵל מְתוּשָׁאֵל שֶׁנִּקְּבוּ עַל שֵׁם אָבְדָּן, שֶׁנִּמֹּחוּ וְהֻתְּשׁוּ.אנשי שם MEN OF RENOWN (literally, men of name) — Men who bore distinctive names: עירד, מחויאל, מתושאל being so named because these names have reference to their destruction, for they were wiped out and torn out from the world (מחוי-אל would signify “wiped-out-by-God”, מתושאל “Torn-out-by-God).</p>\n<p><em>quite the non-sequitur ...</em> Rashi suddenly describes a non-fallen angel paternal set - sons of Cain.</p>\n<p>****** these men however descended from the human - Kayin. There are no fallen angels in their genetics/DNA/paternity tests nor are these men the original fallen angels?!!**</p>\n<p>By way of example, the Beer Basadeh rejects the Mizrachi and Nachalot Yaakov and states that per Rashi and Zohar, Nefilim here in Genesis, is a reference to the original angels cast out of heaven.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G7RS2XQE.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/G7RS2XQE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>So how then did we get to a discussion regarding Cain's children?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is rashi rejecting the premise that the genesis Nefilim were fallen angels a la his comment in numbers? Is he instead claiming that they were humans of Cain's paternal line and that they fell spiritually and caused others to fall?</li>\n<li>Does Rashi agree the Nefilim are fallen angels but then interprets bnei elohim as a different set  - from Kain?</li>\n<li>or could the genes of the fallen angels be manifest in Cain's line through maternal descent? There is a fascinating sforno on numbers 13:33</li>\n</ol>\n<p>בני ענק. מצד האב:\nבני ענק, descended paternally from giants\nמן הנפילים. מצד האם: descended maternally from Nefillim</p>\n\n\n",

And every action that Abraham performed through a messenger, the Holy One, Blessed be He, likewise performed for his descendants through a messenger. The Gemara elaborates: With regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And Abraham ran to the herd” (Genesis 18:7), bringing the meat himself, and in reference to God’s actions for Abraham’s descendants the verse states: “And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought across quails from the sea” (Numbers 11:31), that God brought meat to them. In reference to Abraham, the verse states: “And he took curd and milk” (Genesis 18:8), and God says to the Jewish people: “Behold, I will cause to rain bread from heaven for you” (Exodus 16:4), which shows that God gave food to the Jewish people.\nWith regard to Abraham, the verse states: “And he stood by them under the tree, and they ate” (Genesis 18:8), and in reference to God, the verse states: “Behold, I will stand before you there upon the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it” (Exodus 17:6). In the case of Abraham it is written: “And Abraham went with them to bring them on the way” (Genesis 18:16), and the verse states: “And the Lord went before them by day” (Exodus 13:21). By contrast, Abraham performed certain actions through an agent. He said: “Let now a little water be fetched” (Genesis 18:4), and correspondingly the verse states in reference to Moses, God’s messenger: “And you shall strike the rock, and there shall come water out of it, that the people may drink” (Exodus 17:6).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rabbi Pinchas Horowitz, the Baal Haflaah, explains in the Haggadah by the phrase \"I and not an angel\", that there are two redemptions - outer and inner. The outer redemption was the physical freedom from slavery, and this was given to Moshe. The inner redemption was the redemption from idol worship; Hashem Himself had to work on the inside of the Neshamot of Benei Yisrael to redeem them from this.</p>\n<p>This is a general theme - sparks can only actually be rescued by Hashem Himself. We do the work, but the actual extracting of the spark from the <em>klipa</em> is beyond our power and is only in the power of the One Who is above, and the Master of Good and Evil, i.e. the \"Ba'al HaRatzon\" - Hashem Himself.</p>\n\n\n",

Until the Mishneh Torah, not only did no Halachic codexes exist, but rabbinic disputes did not strive to arrive at clear-cut conclusions and become widespread practical Halachic knowledge.</p>\n<p>If we hold that the laws were meant to be widely observed, why did no Halachic codexes for the Jewish masses exist until the 12th century CE? Why didn't Jewish leaders from Joshua to Judah the Prince or Babylonian Resh Galutas attempt to compile such works?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Based on the Rambam himself, in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Transmission_of_the_Oral_Law.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the introduction to this work</a>, he states that he produced this work in response to a widespread deterioration in understanding the law (<em>halacha</em>) from the Gemara.</p>\n<p>Initially once the Gemara was redacted, the Rabbis of the communities of the diaspora (the Geonim) would be available to the masses to help clear up any difficulties in <em>halacha</em> that arose. They would teach these according to their wisdom, and over time collect these in \"She'elot u'Teshuvot\" (Q&A) works.</p>\n<p>It got to the point where the difficulties in understanding the Gemara and <em>paskening</em> <em>halacha</em> were accumulating, and finding authoritative answers was proving difficult, especially as each work was specialised, either on a topic or certain tractates. By the time of the Rambam, he writes that...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...we have been beset by additional difficulties, everyone feels\n[financial] pressure, <strong>the wisdom of our Sages has become lost, and the\ncomprehension of our men of understanding has become hidden.\nTherefore, those explanations, laws, and replies which the Geonim\ncomposed and considered to be fully explained material have become\ndifficult to grasp in our age</strong>, and only a select few comprehend these\nmatters in the proper way. Needless to say, [there is confusion] with\nregard to the Talmud itself - both the Jerusalem and Babylonian\nTalmuds - the Sifra, the Sifre, and the Tosefta, for they require a\nbreadth of knowledge, a spirit of wisdom, and much time, for\nappreciating the proper path regarding what is permitted and\nforbidden, and the other laws of the Torah.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I girded my loins - I, Moses, the son of Maimon, of Spain. I relied upon the Rock, blessed be He. I contemplated all these texts and <strong>sought to compose [a work which would include the conclusions] derived from all these texts regarding the forbidden and the permitted, the impure and the pure, and the remainder of the Torah's laws, all in clear and concise terms</strong>, so that the entire Oral Law could be organized in each person's mouth without questions or objections. Instead of [arguments], this one claiming such and another such, [this text will allow for] clear and correct statements based on the judgments that result from all the texts and explanations mentioned above, from the days of Rabbenu Hakadosh until the present.</p>\n<p>[This will make it possible] for <strong>all the laws to be revealed to both those of lesser stature and those of greater stature</strong>, regarding every single mitzvah, and also all the practices that were ordained by the Sages and the Prophets. <strong>To summarize: [The intent of this text is] that a person will not need another text at all with regard to any Jewish law.</strong> [Trans. by Eliyahu Touger, Moznaim Publishing]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note how the Rambam is trying to avoid recording any debates. He claims that it takes a depth of knowledge, learning and skill to be able to fathom direct law from the debates of the Oral Law's transmission process. Until then, this hadn't posed a problem due to everyone's level of learning*, as the Torah's transmission was indeed meant to foster this hands-on \"debate\" style, producing an intimate relationship with the Torah. As beautiful as that was, it can't take precedence over maintaining the integrity of the <em>halacha</em>.</p>\n<p>Recording and reducing it stifles the process, and isn't ideal in the same spirt of \"לא ניתנה תורה שבעל פה ליכתב\" - the Oral Torah shouldn't be written down. Each stage of writing it down has caused it to become more stale, and less innovative. Only \"times of great need\" would allow such a thing and Rambam was indeed at the precipice of a \"time of great need\" that only got worse since**.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>In answer to your specific question of how did people learn <em>halacha</em> before we had these written-down Oral Torah works, the Rambam addresses this as well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbenu Hakadosh composed the Mishnah. From the days of Moses, our\nteacher, until Rabbenu Hakadosh, no one had composed a text for the\npurpose of teaching the Oral Law in public. <strong>Instead, in each\ngeneration, the head of the court or the prophet of that generation\nwould take notes of the teachings which he received from his masters\nfor himself, and teach them verbally in public</strong>.</p>\n<p>Similarly, according to his own potential, <strong>each individual would write\nnotes for himself of what he heard regarding the explanation of the\nTorah, its laws, and the new concepts that were deduced in each\ngeneration concerning laws that were not communicated by the oral\ntradition, but rather deduced using one of the thirteen principles of\nBiblical exegesis and accepted by the high court.</strong> This situation\ncontinued until [the age of] Rabbenu Hakadosh.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I strongly recommend reading the whole of the introduction as it will answer these questions in more detail and be a spring board for further reading.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> There was no need for such a work before the Rambam, but due a decline in the level of learning of both the leaders and the average Jew, the time had come for a work that boiled down the law into a set of dos and donts, concise and free of debate.</p>\n<p><sup>* although do note that the redactions of the Mishna and the Gemara both represented similar junctures of deterioration in our history<br />\n**\nWelcome to the age of Kitzur Shulchan Aruchs, Sefarias, and Halacha Lines. We are even training computers to look up stuff for you. </sup></p>\n\n\n",

The same idea is developed further in the introduction to the Netziv's commentary <a href=\"https://mysefer.com/products/sheiltot_de_rav_achai_gaon_3_vol?_pos=10&_sid=44298e06c&_ss=r\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ha’amek Sh’alah</em> to <em>Sheiltos of Rav Hai Gaon</em></a> (translated as \"<a href=\"https://mysefer.com/products/the_path_of_torah__the_introduction_to_haamek_sheelah?_pos=11&_sid=44298e06c&_ss=r\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Path of Torah</a>\"). Netziv notes that development of <em>halachah</em> is a 2-tiered process, which was performed by <em>Sanhedrin</em>. The process consisted of</p>\n<p>1-st tier - legislation: issue of psak halacha to various life circumstances</p>\n<p>2-nd tier - adjudication: combining of similar laws into a single <em>halacha l'ma'aseh</em>.</p>\n<p>One can see an example of such a system not only in halacha but also in the 2nd perek of masechet Pirkei Avot with 5 students of Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai. There are 4 students who work hard arriving at an independent psak: Rabbi Eliezer ben Hyrcanus, Rabbi Joshua ben Hananiah, Rabbi Yose haKohein, and Rabbi Shimon ben Nethanel, and then comes the smartest of all Rabbi Eleazar ben Arach and makes the punchline. What is the purpose of the discussion in Avos? It is precisely to explain with simple examples how the 2-tiered process at arriving at <em>halacha</em> worked. R. Eleazar ben Arach did not work as a <em>posek</em> / legislator, he worked as an adjudicator, while the four other rabbis covered all the possibilities with their independent and diverse <em>psak</em>.</p>\n<p>Such was development of the Mishnah. As evidence shows, the previous halachic work included mostly halachic commentary on Chumash and other books of Nach, which were available in some form and evidently edited later. Rabbi Yehuda haNassi's job was to produce a singular halachic work, which would unite approaches of other hachamim. He was a great adjudicator, while others produced <em>psak</em> to make the system work.</p>\n<p>Mishnah was written in circumstances which radically differed from previous halachic work, when there was the Temple. Netziv explains that the holiness of the Temple somehow allowed to effortlessly arrive at the correct formulation, and no painful process of halachic argumentation was necessary. As a result, towards the end of the Temple, under Roman occupation, hachamim lacked the skill neccessary to make a correct psak. In Netziv's opinion, that's precisely what caused hesitation of R. Zecharia ben Avkulos regarding Bar Kamtza in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.56a.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 56a</a>.</p>\n<p>After the Temple destruction, a diverse legislative work was performed for several generations until a mature body of <em>halacha</em> emerged, and Mishna united these approaches at the end. In fact, many discussions in the gemara one can also view in exactly the same 2-tiered format as actually pointed out by sefer <em>Havot Yair</em> (see <em><a href=\"https://mosaicapress.com/product/talmud-reclaimed/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmud Reclaimed</a></em> by R. Shmuel Phillips). Ravina and Rav Ashi were adjudicators of Gemara. R. Yosef Caro and R. Moshe Isserlish were adjudicators of Shulchan Aruch, etc.</p>\n\n\n",

So choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, 20 by loving the Lord your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding close to Him; for this is your life and the length of your days, so that you may live in the land which the Lord swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to give them.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based upon this correlation, it seems that Life is found / cultivated through obedience to God; had Adam and Eve obeyed God then they would not have been bared from the Tree of Life.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, the Tree of the Knowledge of Good & Evil seems to figure the Law? For through it, man becomes aware of his sin and it produces guilt and shame and fear of the Lord's presence. Atonement becomes a necessity in order to address man's guilty conscience so that he can once more appear before God without fear.</p>\n<p><strong>Yet is it not through knowledge of the Law that we may obey God and thus cultivate life?</strong></p>\n<p>Does death then become a prerequisite to life? (EDIT: Leaving this here as part of my thought process, but don't answer it here. I will create a separate question for it later).</p>\n<p>Or perhaps, continuing the correlation with Deuteronomy 30, it is not the knowledge that brought death so much as it was the fact that they were \"led astray and worshiped other gods (the serpent / Egypt?) and served them.\"</p>\n\n\n",

The narrative describes Wisdom as present even during the creation of the heavens (the second day of creation). However, it does not say that Wisdom was present when God created the light on the first day. And since the light was the first creation, this would seem to imply that the Light is God’s Wisdom.</p>\n<p>Is this association made in Judaism. Or, if the Wisdom is not the Light, how is Wisdom interpreted as part of the creation story? And what is the Light?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Light of the first day refers to Hashem's intent and goal in Creation, and is therefore God's Will. Will always precedes, and acts as the power of, Wisdom.</p>\n<p>God's purpose is that the world be transformed to Light, i.e. His very Self should find a dwelling in the lowest world.</p>\n<p>The Light of the first day was hidden away, and a ray of it was channeled into the creation of every detail of all that was created. In this mode, this small vector of a ray is more associated with Kindness. The act(s) of Creation is indeed a pure act of Kindness, as what is Kindness if not giving. In this mode, the light is hidden, and it is the mission of the Jewish people to expose it through Torah and Mitzvot.</p>\n<p>The Torah is where God hid the Light, and its Wisdom is indeed associated with the Light as God's desire is expressed as a plan; a blueprint, and hence the association with Light and Wisdom (Sotah 12a). The Light is also associated with Goodness, which is what every phrase \"it was good\" is really referring to - the Light that is in all the details of creation, that will one day be revealed.</p>\n<p>A practical lesson, that also helps us understand this deep idea, is how we also go about fulfilling our desires. At first, we transform the desire into a plan, and then we hide away the desire somewhere in the background, while we execute the plan. The desire is what empowers the entire process, but during that process it is not focussed on, but when the plan is accomplished, the desire is able to be fully revealed once again, in enjoying the fruits of the labour.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/therebbe/article_cdo/aid/4561342/jewish/Bereishis-A-Mission-of-Light.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this Sicha</a> for more information, explanation, and plenty of sources.</p>\n\n\n",

Christians are bewildered by this rejection because it\nappears so obvious to them that every aspect of Jesus' life - from his\nmiraculous conception to his crucifixion and ressurection - was\nclearly predicted in the Jewish Scriptures. They wonder why the Jews\nthen fail to embrace Jesus as their messiah. Can't they grasp that the\nprophecies in their own Bible predict that the messiah would suffer\nand die and then rise from the grave? How can a people who produced so\nmany Nobel Prize winners be so dense? Are they just plain stubborn?</p>\n<p>Why then did the Jews reject the claim that the messiah would suffer\nand die for the sins of the world? <strong>The answer is quite simple: Jewish\nmessianic expectations are firmly rooted in hundreds of prophecies\nrecorded throughout the Hebrew Bible. And Jews who are anticipating a\nmessiah are not looking for anyone remotely like Jesus.</strong> They are\nawaiting the messiah who will destroy the enemies of God, usher in\nworldwide peace, the universal knowledge of God, the ingathering of\nthe exiles, the resurrection of the dead, and the rebuilding of the\nTemple in Jerusalem.</p>\n<p>Who then was Jesus?</p>\n<p>While it is difficult to answer this question with certainty because\nno contemporaneous historian mentioned Jesus, it is possible that he\nwas one of hundreds—perhaps thousands—of obscure, itinerant preachers\nduring the first century who came from the backwoods of the Galilee,\nwound up on the wrong side of the law, and was summarily executed by\nthe empire. He then would have been one of hundreds of thousands of\nJews who were crucified by the Romans during the turbulent first\ncentury.</p>\n<p>For Jews, calling Jesus the messiah and God, Creator of the universe,\nis foolish and blasphemous.</p>\n<p><strong>But aren’t there Scriptures that Christians frequently cite like\nIsaiah 53 and Psalm 22 that predict that the messiah would be tortured\nand killed for the sins of mankind?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The answer to this question is simple as well: the messiah is never\nmentioned in any of these chapters. Look it up for yourself! As it\nturns out, originally these passages had nothing to do with a future\nmessiah. These chapters were ripped out of context and key words were\nmistranslated. Prior to the advent of Christianity, there was not a\nsingle prediction by anyone that the messiah would be executed for the\nsins of mankind. In fact, these texts do not refer to the messiah but\nto someone or something else.</strong></p>\n<p>This raises an important question: If there was no expectation that\nthe messiah would die for the sins of the world, how did Jews, who\nwere among the earliest Christians, come to believe in a suffering\nmessiah? It is not difficult to figure out how this belief could have\ndeveloped.</p>\n<p>If Jesus was proclaiming that the tyranny of Rome would soon come to\nan end—which would explain what got him into trouble with the\nempire—some people may have considered him to be the messiah in a\ntraditional Jewish sense: he would fulfill prophecies which predict\nthat a final Davidic ruler would drive Israel’s oppressors out of the\nHoly Land and restore the complete sovereignty of God on earth. This\nhope would have been shattered when Jesus failed to fulfill this\ndream, and instead was summarily executed by the Romans. While some of\nhis followers presumably concluded that their belief was therefore\nunfounded, others came to believe that Jesus somehow rose from the\ndead and was the son of God. <strong>This was their line of reasoning: Jesus\nis the messiah. Jesus was crucified. Therefore, the messiah had to be\ncrucified.</strong></p>\n<p>But this belief raised a monumental problem for these zealous\nbelievers: There were no prophecies in the Jewish Scriptures that\nsuggested that the messiah was to suffer and die. They solved this\nproblem by searching the Bible for any support for their new belief.\n<strong>The verses they came up with, however, do not refer to the messiah,\nbut rather the suffering of God’s faithful remnant. When they tried to\nconvince fellow Jews that passages in the Hebrew Bible were speaking\nabout Jesus the messiah, the sparks began to fly!</strong></p>\n<p>It is precisely for this reason that until this day Christians are\nbaffled by the Jewish rejection of Jesus, and Jews are bewildered why\nChristians would even entertain the notion that Jesus is the messiah.</p>\n<p>The belief that the messiah was to suffer and die is an idea that\nearly Christians invented. Not surprisingly, years after Christians\nconcocted this idea, Paul viewed this notion as the greatest\n“stumbling block” for Jews, and because Jews considered this belief so\nfoolish it had to be true (I Corinthians 1:18-25).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sup>* And note, different chapters do not necessarily mean different topics, and certainly not in these cases, as the book of Isaiah is a cohesive prophecy, and all of these verses are part of the same narrative that 53 is a continuation of.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are certainly some Jewish sources which view (at least part of) Isaiah 53 as a messianic prophecy, but there is no reason to believe that the Messiah alluded to is Jesus.</p>\n<p>See, for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.98b.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 98b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ורבנן אמרי חיוורא דבי רבי שמו שנאמר (ישעיהו נג, ד) אכן חליינו הוא נשא ומכאובינו סבלם ואנחנו חשבנוהו נגוע מוכה אלהים ומעונה</p>\n<p>And the Rabbis say: The leper of the house of Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi is his [the Messiah's] name, as it is stated: “Indeed our illnesses he did bear and our pains he endured; yet we did esteem him injured, stricken by God, and afflicted” (Isaiah 53:4)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I will answer both.</p>\n<p>A) A Segolate is a word that ends with one unstressed Segol, such as חֶסֶד and קֹדֶשׁ.<br />\nThe most common type of Segolate ends with two Segols in a row. This includes דֶרֶך, לֶחֶם, יֶרֶך, דֶגֶל, מַחְבֶרֶת, and more.<br />\nWhen such a Segolate is at a <strong>major break</strong> in a פסוק—that is, when it takes an <strong>אֶתנַחתָא/אַתנָח</strong> or when it’s the <strong>last word</strong> in a פסוק—the first Segol changes to a Kamatz. Thus, דֶרֶך becomes דָרֶך, and לֶחֶם becomes לָחֶם, and more.</p>\n<p>B) There are two types of Dagesh: Dagesh Chazzaq and Dagesh Qal.<br />\nDagesh Chazzaq indicates that a letter is <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gemination\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">geminated</a>, i.e. that it lasts twice as long and is pronounced with a little extra force. It is not relevant to your question.<br />\nDagesh Qal occurs only on the letters בגדכפ״ת. It gives them their “hard” pronunciation. For example, it turns Vet into Bet.</p>\n<p>Dagesh Qal occurs on a letter only if it <em>doesn’t</em> come after a vowel. This is easy to understand <em>within</em> a word, but it’s a bit more complicated when we’re talking about the first letter of a word, like the ב in בלק. For that, the rule is as follows:<br />\nIf the <strong>preceding</strong> word 1) <em>ends</em> in a vowel, AND 2) has a conjunctive trope sign, then the first letter of the next word <em>doesn’t</em> get a Dagesh Qal. In every <em>other</em> case, it DOES get a Dagesh Qal.<br />\nThus, for example, in the phrase דִּבְרֵי בָלָק, Balaq’s name is pronounced with a Vet, because the previous word ends in a vowel and has a conjunctive trope.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>If it's דָ֫רֶך it means the word is in pause, meaning that the accent is a disjunctive one, so it lengthens it. Sometimes a shva become a qamets or a tsere if it's in pause</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why were only men allowed to divorce for sexual impurity? Did men not also commit sexual misconduct?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><em>Note: <a href=\"https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/96203/why-were-only-men-allowed-to-divorce-for-sexual-impurity-did-men-not-also-commi\">this question was posted to Biblical Hermeneutics yesterday</a>, and did not attract a response. As this is a question about the Law of Moses, I'm open to a Jewish explanation as well. This question seems related, though not the same; but I am looking for a more Bible-focused explanation, as the rest of additional Jewish traditions are unfamiliar to me: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/71354/can-a-wife-demand-a-divorce-from-a-cheating-husband\">Can a wife demand a divorce from a cheating husband</a></em>.</p>\n<p>In Deuteronomy 22 and 24, only men were allowed to produce a bill of divorce. Although in the case of adultery, both sexes are criminally responsible, in the case of Deuteronomy 22 and 24, there does not seem to be an equivalent law for women finding such uncleanness in their husband.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(Deuteronomy 24:1, Koren trans.) When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he has found some unseemliness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.</p>\n<p>(Deuteronomy 22:13-15, Koren trans.) If any man take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,\nand lay accusing speeches against her, and bring out an evil name upon her, saying, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not to be a virgin:\nthen shall the father of the girl, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the girl’s virginity to the elders of the city in the gate</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is my understanding that rabbis generally also allowed women to divorce their husbands. That is a broader issue. But the more specific question is, could there not be uncleanness found in a man, as in general sexual indecency, impropriety, or something of the like, which, though not at the level of adultery (for which the punishment is death), would legally allow divorce -- a male equivalent to women's purity laws? And if not, why not?</p>\n<p>Obviously the Bible is not completely egalitarian, but I wonder how to address this in today's context, where this is seen as a slight against women, who would not have had the same recourse as men. How do theologians explain this apparent unfairness towards women?</p>\n<p>Duplicate note:</p>\n<p>The following duplicate has been suggested: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/33477/in-adultery-why-is-a-wife-is-guilty-and-a-husband-not\">In adultery, why is a wife is guilty, and a husband not?</a>.

There's no unique \"sin\" for a man to commit adultery as there is for a woman (besides for the <em>other</em> sins involved for having relations with someone he's not married to/a niddah etc), although if he does cheat on her then that is grounds for her to initiate a divorce (see later).</p>\n<p>In terms of being \"fair\" and \"moral\": morality is defined by the Creator. He made everything, He decides what's good and what's bad.</p>\n<p>The Rambam tells us that all of the laws of forbidden relationships are known as chukim, Mitzvos who's reasoning is not known to us.</p>\n<p>They have deep spiritual reasons, some that only the Creator knows about, but not all of them can be understood by the intellect of created beings.</p>\n<p>The Rambam does say that however much reason one can give these commandments, one should give (end of h. Meila), but (ibid) the main reason of them is still hidden from us.</p>\n<p>In terms of a woman being able to divorce a man because of immodest behavior, <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/560111/jewish/The-Wifes-Grounds-for-Divorce.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">many rabbis</a> say that if she simply doesn't want to continue being with him then she can initiate a divorce, especially if the man has been involved excessively with other women, even when no adultery was found.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A woman may demand a divorce from her husband, if he has been found to\nbe philandering with other women. There need not be proof of his\nhaving committed adultery, just of his having cavorted with other\nwomen. Even his causing her a bad name through his lecherous actions\nis likewise considered legitimate justification for the wife launching\na divorce action. If the wife feels repulsed by her husband, it is\nwrong to force her to remain in the union</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now to the question of what specifically is meant by \"immodest behavior\" by the women, the Rambam references the verse in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/957715/jewish/Gerushin-Chapter-Ten.htm#v22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hilchos geirushin 10:20-22</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>22 It is a mitzvah to divorce a woman who possesses unsavory character\ntraits and does not conduct herself modestly73, as is the practice of\nproper daughters of Israel, as [implied by Proverbs 22:10]: \"Drive\naway the scoffer, and contention will depart.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a woman has been divorced for loose moral conduct,74 it is not\nfitting for a proper man to marry her, lest people say: \"This one sent\naway this wicked woman, and this one brought her home.\"</p>\n<p>כב אִשָּׁה רָעָה בְּדֵעוֹתֶיהָ וְשֶׁאֵינָהּ צְנוּעָה כִּבְנוֹת\nיִשְׂרָאֵל הַכְּשֵׁרוֹת מִצְוָה לְגָרְשָׁהּ שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (משלי כב י)\n״‎גָּרֵשׁ לֵץ וְיֵצֵא מָדוֹן״‎. וְאִשָּׁה שֶׁנִּתְגָּרְשָׁה מִשּׁוּם\nפְּרִיצוּת אֵין רָאוּי לְאָדָם כָּשֵׁר שֶׁיִּשָּׂאֶנָּה. שֶׁלֹּא\nיֹאמְרוּ זֶה הוֹצִיא רְשָׁעָה מִבֵּיתוֹ וְזֶה מַכְנִיסָהּ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/952899/jewish/Ishut-Chapter-Twenty-Four.htm#v12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">hilchos ishus 24:11-12</a> the Rambam explains exactly what is meant:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>11 The following are the actions for which a woman is considered to\nhave \"violated the faith of Moses\":</p>\n<p>a) going out to the marketplace with her hair uncovered;25</p>\n<p>b) taking vows or oaths that she does not keep;</p>\n<p>c) engaging in sexual relations [with her husband] while in the niddah\nstate;</p>\n<p>d) failing to separate challah or feeding her husband food that is\nforbidden to eat - needless to say, this applies to forbidden crawling\nanimals and animals that were not ritually slaughtered; it applies\neven to produce that was not tithed.26</p>\n<p>How can the latter [two] matters be known? For example, she said: \"So\nand so, the priest, [separated tithes] from this produce for me,\" \"So\nand so separated challah [from this dough],\" \"So and so, the Sage,\nsaid this stain does not render me a niddah\" - and after eating the\nfood or engaging in sexual relations with her, the husband asked the\nperson whose name was mentioned and he denied the occurrence of the\nincident. Another example: a woman's [conduct caused] it to be\nestablished in her neighborhood that she was in the niddah state,27\nbut she told her husband that she was ritually pure.

See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143737/31534\">Y DJ's answer</a> for a basic Scriptual source that proves men are not allowed to be indecent, and there are many more.</p>\n<p>The Torah is very concerned about <em>marriages</em>. A marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman. The Torah recognises that sometimes a marriage has lost certain qualities - including a solid bond between the husband and wife - and therefore it would be better that they are divorced rather than remain married.</p>\n<p>The verses you are quoting are not providing any more information than the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A husband must initiate a divorce (24)</li>\n<li>A husband must do so willingly (24)</li>\n<li>A example of grounds for him to do so would be if he finds his wife to be repulsive (24, and the Torah is recognising that most men find sexual indecency in women to be repuslive, <em>as an example</em>)</li>\n<li>If a woman tells her husband she is a virgin before marriage, and he discovers that she isn't, that is grounds for divorce (22 - see also <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/143736/31534\">Core of reality's answer</a> regarding how this is related to actual adultery, rather than virginity - it is allowed for a Jew to marry a non-virgin)</li>\n<li>Her family has the opportunity to prove her innocence, and clear her name (22).</li>\n<li>If her innocence is proven, he is punished (22).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are general principles and they do not imply anything about what a woman can and can't ask for a divorce for, so there is no use making presumptions. Indeed, looking at point 3) we can learn that if a woman finds her husband repulsive, she very likely has the right to demand a divorce, and courts will enforce it.</p>\n<p>This can include him being sexually promiscuous, not providing her conjugal rights, not supporting her financially, losing a limb, or even developing bad breath! See SA EH 154.</p>\n<p>It is fair to note that the Torah does concern itself with a woman's sexual purity more than a man's, but that is for several reasons that, again, do not imply that there is no such thing as indecency by men. It's partly legal, partly practical, and partly just recognition of basic human psychology - men and women's concerns are asymmetrical, but asymmetry does not imply bias or unfairness.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There is a clear prohibition for promiscuity Devarim 23:18 for both men and women:</p>\n<p>לֹא־תִהְיֶ֥ה קְדֵשָׁ֖ה מִבְּנ֣וֹת יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל וְלֹֽא־יִהְיֶ֥ה קָדֵ֖שׁ מִבְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃</p>\n<p>There shall be no Jewish woman promiscuous/prostitute, and not a Jewish man be promiscuous/prostitute.</p>\n<p>The understanding of the words קָדֵ֖שׁ / קְדֵשָׁ֖ה may have association with ancient cults like Babylonian Ishtar, but in modern times it seems to be interpreted as promiscuous on the OU website <a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/6168\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://outorah.org/p/6168</a>.

In doing so, I ran into the ~30 or so Hebrew cantillation marks, and wanted to learn a little about them, how they work, how the writer knows where to put the marks, how the notes and rhythms get defined/allowed, and generally the theory behind how to interpret them.</p>\n<p>The best and pretty much only example I could find on the web was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i9J3kuJoWo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this quick video</a>, leading to <a href=\"https://learntrope.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">learntrope.com</a>, which at least provides a somewhat simple introduction immersion.

If so, how do the authors decide where to put the cantillation marks?</li>\n<li>Is it possible to learn without the melody/singing/chanting aspect of it, and at first just focus on the pausing and rhythms? If so, what is a recommended technique? If not, why not?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Basically, I would like to learn how this works in more detail, but didn't find anything good online to really dig into, beyond the few resources I linked.</p>\n\n\n",

But this is a wonder! As behold, every creature only desires its species, as it is found in Tractate Bava Metzia 91b: \"Its species - it is drawn after its species.\" And behold the serpent was not lacking its female. And if it was on account of their having intercourse before the eyes of all, the serpent also did not know shame.</p>\n<p>Rather the matter is that it sensed that the clinging of the women to her husband was not like its female to it, which only occurred at the time of arousal for copulation. And that is only by happenstance and preparation for the thing. Which was not the case with the woman, who constantly clung to him: Given that she was the bone of his bones, the clinging was even more than a brother and sister. For they too are one flesh. However they are nevertheless not truly so like the first woman to Adam, who was like a limb to the head. <em>And it was jealous of this</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>And behold the matter is understood</strong> that the serpent never spoke. For if it had originally spoken but was cursed to be dumb and silent, why is this curse not mentioned? Moreover, speech depends on intelligence, and as per Rashi's explanation of, \"and so man became a living soul\" Genesis 2:7) - with speech and intelligence. And likewise did Onkelos translate, \"With a speaking spirit.\" <em>Behold man was unique in this virtue</em>. However it was the constellation of the serpent that clothed himself with jealousy and spoke at that time from the throat of the serpent.</p>\n<p>As every species from all that was created - even the botanic - has a constellation; and that is the angel that is appointed upon that species to protect it and grow it, so that it not cease from the world. And this is like the Sages, may their memory be blessed, said, \"You have no [blade of] grass below without its constellation above striking it and saying to it, 'Grow!'\"  And the constellation of the serpent was like [the serpent]; as it was jealous of man's clinging to his Creator, may He be blessed. And it is just as we explained in the previous section, that Adam clung so greatly to God, like a portion that always yearns for its source; which is not the case with an angel. It is just separated and it is not clinging and yearning for His light, may He be blessed, except for at the time designated for song and that which is similar. And the angel was jealous about Adam; and the physical serpent about his wife. And [about] that which all of this is not explained in Scripture, the Ramban has already written, in Parashat Bechukotai - and we brought it earlier (Haamek Davar on Bereishit 1:1) - that regarding things that are not grasped by everyone, the Torah only spoke about it by hinting.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Isi taught that the obligation of the first sheared wool applies only in the case of sheep [reḥelim], the masculine plural form of raḥel, meaning a sheep. Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Isi: You should teach him using the term reḥelot, the feminine plural form. Isi said to him in reply: I teach the mishna in accordance with that which is written: “Two hundred reḥelim” (Genesis 32:15). <strong>Rabbi Yoḥanan said to Isi: The language of the Torah is distinct and the language of the Sages is distinct, i.e., these are like two separate languages, and the Sages do not always use the same forms that appear in the Bible.</strong> In this case, they use reḥelot rather than reḥelim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The commentary Ben Yehoyada says that the form that ends with ת implies more connection between the individuals than the one that doesn't (see there for why that is important in the Rabbinic context.)

And Bilam in his great arrogance wanted to show that he was needed more than anyone else, for there is no power of Balak even in the actions of others. Therefore, Tzippor is spelt without the vav, since you already know that vav intimates/teaches about action (and here Balak was not able to show that sense of action), likewise when he said \"Give ear unto me, son of Tzippor\".

Since Hashem is not always aware (according to what Bilam thinks), Bilam needs to tell Hashem  of the speacil powers that Balak posseses, which gives importance and a claim/good reason to go and curse Bnei Yisrael.

Bilam said\nto Him: “Balak son of Tzipor, king of Moav, sent to me” (Numbers\n22:10). Rabbi Abba bar Kahana said: This is one of three people whom\nthe Holy One blessed be He examined but found them to be a jug of\nurine. They are Cain, Hezekiah, and Bilam. Cain, when the Holy One\nblessed be He said to him: ‘Where is your brother Abel?’ he sought, as\nit were, to mislead. He should have said: ‘Master of the universe, the\nconcealed and the revealed are revealed before You, and You are asking\nme regarding my brother?’ Instead, he said to Him: “I do not know; am\nI my brother’s keeper?” (Genesis 4:9). The Holy One blessed be He said\nto him: ‘This is how you speak? “The voice of your brother's blood\ncries out to Me from the ground. [Now, you are cursed…]”’ (Genesis\n4:10–11).  Hezekiah, when he recovered from his illness, Merodakh\nBaladan sent him a gift, as it is stated: “At that time, Merodakh\nBaladan…sent [scrolls and a gift to Hezekiah]” (Isaiah 39:1). Isaiah\ncame and said to him: “What did those men say, and from where did they\ncome to you?” (Isaiah 39:3). He [Hezekiah] should have said to him:\n‘You are a prophet of the Omnipresent, and you are asking me?’\nInstead, he began boasting: “They came to me from a distant land, from\nBabylonia” (Isaiah 39:3). Isaiah said to him: ‘Since that is what you\nsaid: “Behold, days are coming and everything that is in your\nhouse…will be carried [to Babylonia]…From your sons, who will descend\nfrom you…they will be officials in the palace of the king of Babylon”’\n(Isaiah 39:6–7).  <strong>Likewise, the wicked Bilam, when Balak sent to him,\nthe Holy One blessed be He said to him: “Who are these men with you?”\n(Numbers 22:9), he should have said: ‘Master of the universe,\neverything is revealed before You and nothing is obscured from You,\nand You are asking me?’ Instead he said to him: “Balak son of Tzipor,\nking of Moav, sent to me.” The Holy One blessed be He said to him:\n‘Since that is how you speak, “do not curse the people” (Numbers\n22:12).</strong> The Holy One blessed be He said: ‘Wicked one of the world, it\nis written in Israel’s regard: “For one who touches you, touches the\npupil of his eye” (Zechariah 2:12), and you go to accost them and\ncurse them? Let his eye be removed, as it is stated: “One with an open\neye” (Numbers 24:3), to realize: “For one who touches you, touches the\npupil of his eye.”’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From here was can see that Bilam having mentioned anything to Hashem was a mistake and was “<em>the reason</em>” why Hashem didn’t let him curse the Jewish people. So now that we know that he didn’t mention Balak Ben Tzipor as part of a claim (as he did when he mentions “King of Moab” as Aderet Eliyahu explains that it was his hava mina that Hashem would accept his claim, if not he would not have asked), we need to understand why mention it at all? So really you can ask the same question on Cain and Adam Harishon and Chizkiyahu and say that they made a mistake and didn’t answer Hashem properly. But in this specific case we are given a glimpse of answer by taking what @Avishai Tebeka has answered and fitting it into this explanation as follows:</p>\n<p>Bilam was a prophet and understood the greatness and power of Hashem. But as Rashi quoting Midrash Tanchuma Balak 5 says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי האנשים האלה עמך. לְהַטְעוֹתוֹ בָא, אָמַר פְּעָמִים שֶׁאֵין הַכֹּל\nגָּלוּי לְפָנָיו, אֵין דַּעְתּוֹ שָׁוָה עָלָיו, אַף אֲנִי אֶרְאֶה עֵת\nשֶׁאוּכַל לְקַלֵּל וְלֹא יָבִין (תנחומא):</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Bilam clearly mistakenly believed that there are times where Hashem, Chas veShalom, isn’t aware/doesn’t know and can be taken advantage of. Now in the context of this explanation it is difficult to understand how Bilam used this as a reason to ask Hashem to curse because if he truly believed that there are these times where he can curse without Hashem knowing then why even bring it up to Hashem? Just curse at this moment?! So leaving that aside we can use this to answer our question by saying that Bilam answered Hashem in this way because he believed that sometimes Hashem is not aware and when he was asked “Who are these people” he gave Hashem a genuine answer, and that was exactly his mistake. He should have understood that it’s a rhetorical question because Hashem knows everything. So he answered Hashem Balak Ben Tzipor because he thought that there are times when Hashem does not know certain things and since Hashem asked him this question he wanted to answer accordingly (he didn’t have a hava mina that it’s a rhetorical question because he didn’t believe that Hashem is always all knowing). And he mentioned King of Moab either for this same reason, or more fittingly, as a claim to be able to even ask Hashem to curse the Jewish nation as Aderet Eliyahu explains in his comment</p>\n<p>With this we can understand not only why Bilam mentioned Ben Tzipor, but further why he mentioned Balak at all and by looking at Aderet Eliyahu also understanding why he mentioned King of Moab</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why is There a Switch in Grammar in Sh'ma?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Sh'ma begins with Dvarim 6:4:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>:שְׁמַ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל ה׳ אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ ה׳ | אֶחָֽד</p>\n<p>Hear, O Israel: The Lord is our God; the Lord is one.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe speaks to the nation in the imperative/command form - \"Hear\"! This form is used to issue a command in the second person — that is, the command is directed at the person being spoken to.</p>\n<p>But then the next verse immediately switches grammatical form:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָ֣הַבְתָּ֔ אֵ֖ת ה׳ אֱלֹהֶ֑יךָ בְּכָל־לְבָֽבְךָ֥\nוּבְכָל־נַפְשְׁך וּבְכָל־מְאֹדֶֽךָ:</p>\n<p>And you shall love the Lord, your God, with all your heart and with\nall your soul, and with all your means.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Moshe now tells the nation to love God, but it is in the sequential perfect form. The sequential perfect form, true to its name, discusses a sequence of events. Here it can carry the same meaning as the verb before it - command form. Such as in לֵ֤ךְ וְאָֽמַרְתָּ֙ אֶל־עַבְדִּ֣י אֶל־דָּוִ֔ד/Go and say to my servant David (Samuel 2 7:5). And so is this a normal example of Hebrew Grammar (שמע and ואהבת are both commands) or is something else going on here?</p>\n<p>Is the fact that the verses discuss different mitzvot - the Mitzva of God's Oneness v. the Mitzva of loving God - a clue?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Yes I believe your suggestion is correct - the switch in grammar has to do with the context of each statement. Let’s break it down:</p>\n<p>The first statement that Hashem is our Gd and He is one is stated as a fact. No room to argue or to need to comprehend anything, it just is</p>\n<p>Whereas the next verse which commands us to love Gd, even though it’s a commandment and we must do it, you cannot force someone to love something unless they do. Therefore the statement could not have been in the command form because it is something which requires each individual to think about and contemplate to reach this level of love. It’s not something black and white like knowing that Gd is one and can therefore be commanded. This is about emotions and therefore must come from a place of self desire and cannot be commanded upon.</p>\n<p>My proof from this comes from Sefer Hamitzvot positive commandments 1, 2 and 3. It is evident from his wording that knowing that Gd exists and that He is one is just a fact that was commanded to us without room for us to think and comprehend. Whereas loving Gd he mentions how we need to contemplate and bring ourselves to understanding etc proving that it’s not something that can be commanded and therefore explains the change in grammar in the verse</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>According to Sefer haChinuch mitzvah 420, the first passuk is acceptance of kingship for the entire Jewish nation, while the rest of the verses speak of other important individual mitzvos listed elsewhere in the Sefer. There are also different halachic requirements to the 1st verse (Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chaim, 61:5-7, Ram\"a and Mishna Berura there. For example, one cannot walk when reciting the first verse as a result.</p>\n\n\n",

Or where\nwere the upright cut off? According to what I have seen, those who\nplow iniquity and sow trouble, reap the same.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, he also seems to give credit to Elihu's perspective, presented in Job 32-37, which suggests that suffering can be a test or a divine lesson, and that the ways of God are often beyond our understanding. Elihu states in Job 33:14:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and further in Job 34:10-12, he insists on God's justice:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, listen to me, you men of understanding: far be it from God\nto do wickedness, and from the Almighty to commit iniquity. For\naccording to the work of a man, He will repay him, and according to\nhis ways, He will make it befall him. Of a truth, God will not do\nwickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This appears to be a significant nuance compared to Eliphaz's view. Is Maimonides deviating from the Jewish tradition by incorporating Elihu's perspective?</p>\n<p>I must admit, I am a bit lost, and most of the commentaries I have seen on this haven't helped.

At the end of tractate Kiddushin it lists different groups of Jews and indicates which groups are allowed to marry each other. There is no indication there that Sadducees are a group that is forbidden to marry.</p>\n<p>My question is, are there any sources in the mishna, midrash halacha, tosefta or talmudim which would indicate whether or not Rabbinic Jews would have been permitted to marry Sadducees (and vice versa) or not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Saducees only existed for a short amount of time, from the middle of the Hasmonean period to the destruction of the temple. They wouldn't be relevant in the time of the Gemara but you might find references to min(im) - heretical sects of Judaism.</p>\n<p>The Karites are a sect that is still around today. They also held views different from normative Jews. Like the Saducees, they also deny aspects/authority of the oral law. They claim a connection to the Saducees, though they were separated by about 1000 years.</p>\n<p>There is a presumption that they are all Mamzerim (bastards) because over the years, more and more people will be descended from remarried divorcees who did not divorce in a rabbinically approved manner. However, in 1972 R' Ovadia Yosef ruled you can marry a Karite who accepts rabbinic law, which would imply the bastardy really isn't a problem.(Perhaps he held that rabbinic bastardy is only a fence and the Karites aren't held to be d'orita bastards).</p>\n<p>In contrast to the Karites, the Saducees wouldn't have enough time to propagate bastards and, since many of them lived and died before the Mishna Rabbis, rabbinic bastardy might not have been codified yet. If you wanted to marry a Saducee, asking around on an individual level would probably suffice to rule out an improper divorce.</p>\n\n\n",

Your question is answered by both Ramban and Chizkuni on the relevant verses; I’ve quoted them below for reference:</p>\n<p>Exodus 4:3</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ הַשְׁלִיכֵ֣הוּ אַ֔רְצָה וַיַּשְׁלִכֵ֥הוּ אַ֖רְצָה וַיְהִ֣י\nלְנָחָ֑שׁ וַיָּ֥נׇס מֹשֶׁ֖ה מִפָּנָֽיו׃</p>\n<p>[God] said, “Cast it on the ground.” He cast it on the ground and it\nbecame a snake; and Moses recoiled from it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ramban on this verse says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>AND HE SAID: CAST IT ON THE GROUND. AND HE CAST IT ON THE GROUND. I do\nnot understand why G-d performed the signs before Moses. Moses\nbelieved that it is the Holy One, blessed be He, Who speaks with him,\nand it would have been fitting for Him to say, “The staff that is in\nyour hand you shall cast on the ground before them, and it shall\nbecome a serpent,” and the same also with respect to the second sign,\n[i.e., his hand becoming leprous], just as He said at the third sign,\nand thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the\ndry land, etc. <strong>It is for this reason that the words of our Rabbis can\nbe relied upon, namely, that the first sign, [i.e., the staff turning\ninto a serpent], was a hint to Moses that he had slandered the\nIsraelites [when he said that they would not believe him], and the\nsecond sign was for the purpose of punishing him. And this is the\nsense of the expression, and Moses fled from before it [the serpent].\nHe feared lest he would be punished and the serpent would bite him,\nsince every person naturally avoids danger, even though Moses knew\nthat if it was indeed G-d’s desire [to punish him], there was no one\nthat could deliver him out of His hand. Perhaps even though He\ninformed Moses of the Great Name with which the world was created and\neverything came into existence, He wished to show him that with this\nName signs and wonders would be done, changing the natural order of\nthings, so that the matter would be firmly established in Moses’ heart\nand that he should in truth know that with the Great Name he will\nperform new things in the world.</strong> The first two signs were sufficient\nfor Moses, and therefore the third miracle of the water [turning into\nblood] was not done here. Instead, G-d commanded him to do the third\nsign in the sight of the people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then Exodus 7:9</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּי֩ יְדַבֵּ֨ר אֲלֵכֶ֤ם פַּרְעֹה֙ לֵאמֹ֔ר תְּנ֥וּ לָכֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת\nוְאָמַרְתָּ֣ אֶֽל־אַהֲרֹ֗ן קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּךָ֛ וְהַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ\nלִפְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְתַנִּֽין׃</p>\n<p>“When Pharaoh speaks to you and says, ‘Produce your marvel,’ you shall\nsay to Aaron, ‘Take your rod and cast it down before Pharaoh.’ It\nshall turn into a serpent.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this Chizkuni says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והשלך לפני פרעה יהי לתניו, “throw it in front of Pharaoh so that it\nwill turn into a sea monster.” The reason for this was that Pharaoh\nboasted of his power to the extent that G-d in Ezekiel 29,3 called him\n“the great sea monster.” The prophet there ridicules the actual power\nof Pharaoh who people were afraid of. Moses’ performing the miracle,\nwas to show him that awe-inspiring monsters are only an illusion and\ncan be turned into a stick by merely taking hold of their tail.\nSimilarly, Pharaoh’s power is also only an illusion. Even though it\nappears that at this time he is all-powerful, this can change in the\ntime it takes to drop a stick to the ground.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I thought I'd answered this before here but can't find it; here goes.

    "content": "# Angels creation and free will\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Where does the belief come from that angels have no free will? I have searched the scriptures and find nothing that speaks to this. Is it a belief that has entered through commentaries or traditions? There is no mention in the Scriptures that God created angels either, so how do we just accept that?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Talmud in tractate Shabbat 89a relates the background story when Moshe was on Har Sinai that the angels were complaining and saying that they should receive the Torah and Gd tells Moshe to relate to them why they should not get the Torah and the Jewish nation should. I’ve cited the relevant point below in which Moshe says that they do not have an evil inclination (and thus free will)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…Again Moses asked: What else is written in it? God said to him: “You\nshall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal”\n(Exodus 20:13) Moses asked the angels: Is there jealousy among you, or\nis there an evil inclination within you that would render these\ncommandments relevant? Immediately they agreed with the Holy One,\nBlessed be He, that He made the right decision to give the Torah to\nthe people, and as it is stated: “God our Lord, how glorious is Your\nname in all the earth” (Psalms 8:10), while “that Your majesty is\nplaced above the heavens” is not written because the angels agreed\nwith God that it is appropriate to give the Torah to the people on\nearth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can see here proof for both points you questioned. The first, that yes Gd did create angels. The second, they do not have free will since Moshes argument as to why they should not receive the Torah is because they do not have an evil inclination, and without an evil inclination you do not have free will</p>\n<p>Hope that helps!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<ol>\n<li>The Tanach, unlike the New Testament and other religious books, almost never concerns itself with anything beyond the sphere of human experience, including things pertaining to heaven and the afterlife.</li>\n<li>The angels' creation therefore is captured in the statement \"And God <strong>created the heavens</strong> and...\". Angels are heavenly beings, so were created when the heavens were (although Bereshit Rabbah records a tradition that they were only created on the second day, or perhaps the fifth day, in order to prevent people from claiming Hashem needed help creating the world).</li>\n<li>We are not allowed to pray to angels, e.g. Exodus 20:4. It's hard to fathom how someone could possibly argue that this is not one of, if not <em>the</em> major theme of the Torah - it is a mistake to bow to idols of any kind, even if you still believe in God etc.</li>\n<li>The reason we do not bow down to idols is because they do not have free will*. This is considered one of the main errors regarding idols - eyes but can't see, ears but can't hear etc.</li>\n<li>We also note that the only arena in which free will can take place is with regards to right and wrong, i.e. the Mitzvot. The Mitzvot were only given to mankind. No Mitzvot are given to angels, nowhere in the Torah does Hashem address Himself to angels.</li>\n<li>We can therefore see that it's very clear in the Torah that angels don't have \"free\" will. They cannot abandon their mission (and of course, there isn't a single example or hint anywhere in Torah of an angel abandoning its mission). They may have will, and consciousness (and are likely so esoteric that we cannot fathom their existence and being anyway so let's not speculate any further), but it's clear that it's not free.</li>\n<li>Can there be exceptions to this? Of course. We do have traditions of angels Hashem gave free will to as a test, and they failed. Hashem can do anything He likes, this answer is just general.</li>\n<li>Finally, that point about tradition. Please note that this is Mi Yodeya and it is highly unusual here to ask for an only-Scripture-based answer. As <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/136236/contradiction-in-the-torah-please-explain-this-i-have-heard-many-times-that-a/136248#136248\">I wrote here</a> (and strongly recommend you read the first part), Scripture was never meant to be standalone. Torah is supposed to be interpreted with the commentary that God gave at Sinai, and gave authority to the Sages to preserve, involve themselves with, and even develop (which they have done so so well, you'll be amazed if you take the time to look into it). See <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/136448/31534\">this answer for more on that</a> and feel free to ask any questions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, the \"things the Tanach doesn't concern itself with\" (see point 1) will be found in this rich tradition, and this is why it's completely fair we give you an answer from the Gemara, although I hope you have enjoyed the arguments I've made from simple analysis of the Tanach in this one case.</p>\n<p><sup>* This is one of several reasons, but I will not get into the whole subject here</sup></p>\n\n\n",

I remember learning that if Adam and Chava hadn't sinned by eating the forbidden fruit that the snake would not have gained power over them (full force evil inclination) and rather would have become subrserviant to their good deeds.  When I read it it seems that the snake's first sentence (initially) opened the subject of Hashem's discussion but didn't actually slander Hashem directly or lie (yet).  The snake's words stimulated\nChava's by making a misleading statement but didn't actually say UNTRUE words (the DOUBLE negative mathmatically equates to Hashem's positive you CAN eat ALL....etc.)</p>\n<p>Rereading it a few times in the text copied below, I noticed a seeming contradiction by HASHEM... I'm not sure how the second sentence doesn't contradict the first one like a lie.  If you \"MAY EAT FROM ALL OF THE TREES\" then how can the next sentence explain that one is forbidden??</p>\n<p>Here is the actual Chumash text of those verses which I found: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/4426636/jewish/Hebrew-Alphabet-PDF-Chart.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chabad online tanach</a>:\n\"16And the Lord God commanded man, saying, \"Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat.     טזוַיְצַו֙ יְהֹוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַל־הָֽאָדָ֖ם לֵאמֹ֑ר מִכֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ־הַגָּ֖ן אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל:\n17But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die.\"        יזוּמֵעֵ֗ץ הַדַּ֨עַת֙ ט֣וֹב וָרָ֔ע לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑נּוּ כִּ֗י בְּי֛וֹם אֲכָלְךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖נּוּ מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת:\"</p>\n<p>I looked at the question(S) that were asked about this section of the Chumash on Mi Yodeya 5 years ago]<a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/105872/who-is-more-truthful-in-the-garden-of-eden-story-god-or-the-serpent\">2</a> but not neither of those questions specifically addressed the wording and context of H\" words/ language which is what I'm inquiring about here.  My question in this case addresses ONLY the language in vs 16 vs. 17 with regards to Hashem's words only not the errors of Chava and/or the snake.</p>\n<p>Related specifically to the WORDING and ORDER of the language of Chava and the snake which I looked to see how it was in line with the constant that H\" encourages a person in the way they WANT to go, I suspected that Chava would have had to have been the FIRST one to say a lie to open the gate for the snake to go full scale into lie about who H\" is and what H\" said zone and noticed that at first the snake said his inquiry in the double negative (opposite of Hashem's positive) which only INFERS that a contradiction MAY exist but doesn't actually say that Hashem lied: in English the snake's statement would sound like \"did Hashem NOT say that you can NOT eat from ALL of the trees in the Garden?\"  The correct answer would be \"no, H\" said you CAN eat from all of the fruits in the Garden\", so it seems to me that the snakes first attempt was only to stir the thought that Hashem MAY have lied but not actually saying that Hashem actually lied (which never happens - right?) But if Chava HAD answered with the English response above, how could she follow with a second statement which would indicate that ONE tree wasn't included in the \"ALL TREES\" specified previously - which is basically my whole issue.  Please help clear this up my understanding of these words if you can.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It seems to me that you understand the two verses as being independent items. Further as @Rabbi Kaii implies you understand the translation of the second verse to be</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“<strong>and</strong> as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of\nit; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Torah is not written in verse form. In the Torah scroll verses are not delineated. There is no reason to see the two statements as  independent. This is to be seen in the Sefaria translation that has:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>but</strong> as for the tree of knowledge of good and bad, you must not eat of\nit; for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note two items. [1] the verse does not begin with a capital letter; it is a continuation of the previous verse. [2] The conjunction וּ in the word וּמֵעֵ֗ץ is translated as “but”.</p>\n<p>Thus we see that these two verses are really one statement. The second verse qualifies the statement in the first one. Thus there is no “seeming contradiction” in Hashem's words, chas vesholom.</p>\n\n\n",

Is this normative halacha or do other opinions disagree with this?

Now in respect to the shadow\nof a single palm-tree this holds good only where the shadow of the\nneighboring [tree] does not fall upon it; but if the shadow of the\nneighboring tree falls upon it, it does not matter. Then when it was\ntaught: He who sleeps in the shadow of a single palm-tree in a\ncourtyard and <strong>he who sleeps in the shadow of the moon, has his\nblood on is own head</strong>, how is it meant? Shall we say that the shadow\nof the neighbouring tree does not fall upon it, — then even in a field\ntoo [it is dangerous]? Hence you may surely infer from this that in a courtyard [there is danger] even if the shadow of the neighboring tree\nfall on it. This proves it. And in respect to the shadow of the moon\ntoo, this holds good only when [it falls] in the west, but when it is\nin the east it does not matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ibn 'Ezra on Psalms 121:6 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלבנה בלילה תוסיף לחה מולדת תחלואים וזה דבר ברור ומנוסה</p>\n<p>The moon at night generates phlegm and breeds diseases and this is an\nobvious and proven thing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Eliezer ha-Gadol (11th c. Germany) left the following instruction to his son (Orhoth Haim 63):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בני אל תשב בצל החמה בימי תמוז ואב וכל שכן שלא תישן בלילה לאור הלבנה\nועל זה נאמר יומם השמש לא יככה וירח בלילה ביום מפני מרירי ובלילה מפני\nאיגרת בת מחלת וכל שכן כשהלבנה בחידושה ה' ישמור את נפשך ה' ישמור צאתך\nובואך מעתה ועד עולם</p>\n<p>My son, do not dwell in the shadow of the sun in the season of Tamuz\nand Abh and all the more so certainly do not sleep at night in the\nlight of the moon, and on this it was said (Psalms 121:6) \"The sun\nshall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night\" by day because of\n<em>Meriri</em> and by night because of <em>Agerath bath-Mahalath</em>, and all the more so when the moon is renewed may God guard over your life and may\nHe guard over you in your comings and goings now and forever.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14556&st=&pgnum=217\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ta'maei ha-Minhagim 464</a> cites the abovementioned view of R.

Shemirath ha-Nefesh 9)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא יישן בחצר בצל לבנה של כתל החצר, מפני שהשדים דרכם להלך בלילה, ובזמן\nשהלבנה זורחת מתיראין לילך במקום האור והולכין במקום הצל. ואם הלבנה\nבמערב והוא ישן בצל הכתל במזרחו — אין לחש.</p>\n<p>And not to sleep in a courtyard in the shadow of the moon of the wall\nof the courtyard, since it is the manner of shedim to so go at night,\nat times when the moon is shining they are afraid to go in the places\nof light and go instead in the shadow. And if the moon is in the west\nand he sleeps in the shade of the the wall to its east, there is no\nconcern.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam and Shulhan Arukh altogether omit any such concern. Nevertheless in light of the aforementioned sources, some more recent sources take up the issue.</p>\n<p>The Shu\"T Mishnath Yosef of R. Yosef Lieberman (11, 142) holds as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הנה הרשב\"ם בפסחים קיא א פי' בצלה של לבנה ההולך בלילה כשהלבנה זורחת\nוהוא הולך בצל הכתלים שדרך השדים להלוך בלילה ובזמן שהלבנה זורחת\nמתייראין לילך במקום האור והולכין במקום הצל עכ\"ל...וא\"כ הסכנה היא רק אם\nישן בצל הלבנה דהיינו במקום שמוצל מאור הלבנה אבל באור הלבנה עצמה מותר\nלישן</p>\n<p>The Rashbam on Pesahim 111a explains that in the shadow of the moon,\none who goes at night while the moon shines and walks in the shadow of\nthe walls, in the manner of <em>sheidim</em> that at night are afraid to go\nwhere the moon shines and so walk in the shade... and if that is so,\nthe danger is only if one sleeps in the shade of the moon, which is a\nplace protected from the light of the moon, however in the light of\nthe moon itself it is permitted to sleep.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Barukh Sheraga addressing the question of whether soldiers may sleep out in the field beneath the moonlight writes (Barukh Omer YD #34):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומדברי הגמרא נראה שהסכנה היא רק בצל הלבנה אבל לאור הלבנה אין סכנה אולם\nבצוואתו של רבי אליעזר הגדול כתוב שיש סכנה לישן לאור הלבנה ועל זה נאמר\nתהלים קכא ו יומם השמש לא יככה וירח בלילה ב וגם בדרך הטבע יש בזה קצת\nסכנה כמו שכתב האבן עזרא תהלים קכא ו שידוע כי השמש תזיק ברוב החום שלה\nוהלבנה בלילה תוסיף לחה מולדת תחלואים וזה הדבר ברור ומנוסה. ולמעשה\nלכתחילה ראוי לחוש לזה ולישון כמקום מכוסה שהלמה אינה זורחת שם אולם\nכמקום הצורך אפשר להקל כזה כשם שאנחנו מקילים כזוגות מפני שהשדים אינם\nמצויים כינינו ג וגם הסכנה שכתב האכן עזרא כיום לא ידוע שיש כזה סכנה\nויתכן שנשתנו הטכעים</p>\n<p>From the words of the Gemara it seems that the danger is only in the\nshadow of the moon but that in the light of the moon there is no\ndanger, however in the will of R. Eli'ezer ha-Gadol it is written that\nthere is a danger to sleep in the light of the moon and it is that\nwhich is referred to in \"The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night\" , and similarly within the\nnaturalistic view there is some danger as the Ibn 'Ezra attests on\nPsalms 121:6 that it is known that the sun damages through the\nintensity of its heat and that the moon increases phlegm and brings\ndisease and that such is clear and obvious. In practice, ab initio, it\nis proper to be concerned with this and to sleep in a place that is\ncovered and where the moon doesn't shine, however in a place of need\nit is possible to be lenient in this in the same manner as we are\nlenient regarding zugoth since the sheidim are not found among us and\nbecause the danger that the Ibn 'Ezra attests to is not known to us\ntoday and perhaps nature changed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in short, it would be unsurprising to find certain pious minded individuals concerned for the abovementioned views avoiding sleeping in the moonlight.</p>\n\n\n",

The Waw, which usually precedes the inf. abs., sometimes has the value of a simple <em>and</em>, and sometimes that of <em>and (then)</em>, indicating succession. The reasons which have motivated the choice of the inf. abs. are not clearly understood: sometimes there is probably a desire for variety or a stylistic affectation; sometimes the author wished to use a form with a vague subject like <em>one</em> or <em>they</em>. The inf. abs. virtually has the same temporal or modal value as the preceding verb.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here, the preceding verb is היתה, a qal perfect (suffix conjugation) form, which has past tense meaning, so we attribute the same to הותר.

    "content": "# Are there still red heifers פרות אדומות in Ethiopia?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Shulchan Orit The Halacha of Ethiopian Jewry states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In Ethiopia, the synagogue was called masgid or beit mikdas or\nyetzulot bayit. People related to the synagogue with awe, as a real\nTemple. Villagers lived in huts, but the synagogue in every village\nwas a stone structure, quite large, stable and respectable. The\nbuilding stood out in its form, and could be seen and identified from\nafar. In large villages, the synagogue was built in the center of the\nvillage. It could be identified from afar by the red clay pot attached\nto a pole in the middle of the roof. My grandfather used to say that\nwhoever came from afar to participate in the prayer services had great\nmerit – long distances were not a disadvantage, but rather an\nadvantage. The synagogue structure was divided into three parts – the\ncourtyard, the hall, and the kadesta kedusan (kodesh ha-kodashim or\n“Holy of Holies”). Only the kohanim entered the Holy of Holies, and\nthe Orit (Torah scroll) was placed there.</p>\n<p>The public gathered in the\nhall. There were no chairs in the synagogue. Prayers were conducted\nwhile standing, and lasted many hours. Thus many people carried\nwalking sticks, on which they leaned when they grew tired of standing,\nas in the verse, “Your rod and Your staff, they comfort me” (Psalms\n23:4). The synagogue courtyard also served as a gathering place for\nsermons, study, offering sacrifices, reading the Torah, and any event\nof sacred character. The inside of the synagogue was used for prayer\nservices only. When praying, the congregants faced Jerusalem. Before\nentering the synagogue, congregants removed their shoes in respect for\nthe sanctity of the site. They spread leaves on the synagogue floor,\nso as not to have direct contact with the floor. Inside the Holy of\nHolies stood the tevot (ark), and the Orit stood on top. Next to the\nOrit were additional garments for the kohanim and two jars – one with\nashes from the parah adumah (red heifer), the other with holy water\nfor sprinkling on the sacrifices.</p>\n<p>Up until the aliyah to Eretz\nYisrael, the Beta Israel had a continuous tradition for the observance\nof all the biblical laws of purity and impurity. This included the\nlaws of impurity relating to tumat hamet, contact with a dead body,\nand the means of purifying oneself from it with the ashes of the red\nheifer. In Ethiopia, some animals met the biblical qualifications of a\nparah adumah. Against this backdrop, we must ask why the rabbinic and\nTalmudic tradition testifies that the parah adumah no longer exists.\nWas it the intention of the Sages to cease the observance of all laws\nof purity and impurity in the wake of the destruction of the Holy\nTemple? Perhaps they felt that since the destruction of the Second\nTemple ended the use of the parah adumah in Jerusalem, therefore the\npractice should be halted everywhere. In Ethiopia, however, the Beta\nIsrael were careful to observe all laws of purity and impurity as\nspecified in the Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Are there still red heifers פרות אדומות in Ethiopia today?\nIf so, has their usage been continuous in Ethiopia?\nIf not when did it cease?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/From_Sinai_to_Ethiopia%2C_Shulhan_haOrit%3B_The_Halakhah_of_Ethiopian_Jewry%2C_Then_and_Now%2C_1_Daily_Practices.5.3?ven=From_Sinai_to_Ethiopia,_the_halakhic_and_conceptual_world_of_Ethiopian_Jewry._Dr._Sharon_Shalom._Trans._by_Jessica_Setbon._Jerusalem,_Gefen,_2016&lang=en&sbsq=ashes&with=SidebarSearch&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Orit: From Sinai to Ethiopia, Halacha of Ethiopian Jewry</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It is doubtful there were ever any red-heifers that halakhah, as it stands within Rabbinic Judaism, would recognize (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Red_Heifer.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilkhoth Parah</a>). As this article in <a href=\"https://www.makorrishon.co.il/judaism/57615/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makor Rishon</a> explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ההקפדות התלמודיות הרבות בעניין כשרות פרה אדומה לא נהגו שם, וכל פרה\nבגוון חום בהיר נחשבה לכשרה</p>\n<p>The many strictures regarding the kashruth of the red heifer attested\nto in Talmudic literature were not practiced there [in Ethiopia], and\nany light-brown cow was considered kosher [to the Beta Israel for this ritual purpose]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>R. Menachem Waldman, a well known champion of the Beta Israel, similarly confirms (Mas'a El Shearith Yehude Itiyopia, p. 47):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לצורך היטהרות מטומאת מת הכינו אפר של פרה אדומה שלמעשה הייתה פרה חומה\nשנזבחה ונשרפה</p>\n<p>For the purpose of purification from impurity imparted by death, they\nprepared ash from a red-heifer which in practicality/reality was a\nbrown cow that was sacrificed and burnt</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whereas the Beta Israel understood a red-heifer to be a fairly common brown-heifer, traditional Rabbinic Judaism understands the red-heifer to be spectacularly uncommon, given the many strictures by which it may be identified. Traditionally only nine are known to have existed (H. Parah 3:):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ותשע פרות אדמות נעשו משנצטוו במצוה זו עד שחרב הבית בשניה. ראשונה עשה\nמשה רבנו. שניה עשה עזרא. ושבע מעזרא עד חרבן הבית. והעשירית יעשה המלך\nהמשיח מהרה יגלה אמן כן יהי רצון</p>\n<p>Nine red heifers were offered from the time that they were commanded\nto fulfill this miswah until the time when the Temple was destroyed a\nsecond time. The first was brought by Moses our teacher. The second\nwas brought by 'Ezra. Seven others were offered until the destruction\nof the Second Temple. And the tenth will be brought by the king\nMoshiah; may he speedily be revealed. Amen, so may it be God's will.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here are some photos showing a Kes with his holy objects, which include a satchel of ash from what they deemed a red-heifer (ibid):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/O94jFz18.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/O94jFz18.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8MRthco.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/v8MRthco.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>Dr. Steven Kaplan, one of the leading scholars on the origins of the Beta Israel, writes (The Beta Israel (Falasha) in Ethiopia, p. 196, fn. 32):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Beta Israel laws of social purity known as <em>attenkugn</em> (don't touch\nme) are attributed to the fifteenth-century monastic leader Abba Sabra\n... Given the tendency in oral traditions to date virtually all\nimportant religious institutions to his time, some caution must be\nexercised in dating these laws. It is difficult to discern any period\nin which they could have been observed strictly by all Beta Israel.\nIndeed, tenant farmers, soldiers, and craftsmen would all have found\nthem an onerous burden. In all probability such laws represent an\nideal for behavior practiced in reality primarily by only the monastic\nclergy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Given that the evidence for this community's observance of purity laws dates back to the 15th century, it would be hard to characterize their observance as \"continuous\". In fact it seems that it was a practice that was not really emphasized as much until the 19th c. as a reactionary measure against Christian persecution (coming in contact with Christians was believed by them to impart impurity, thus necessitating purification via the ashes). As for when it ceased, it would seem that (at least according to the abovementioned Makor Rishon article) that the last time a red-heifer (as defined by Ethiopian custom) was slaughtered was in 1952:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הפרה האדומה האחרונה של 'ביתא ישראל' נשחטה באתיופיה בשנת 1952</p>\n<p>The last red-heifer to be slaughtered by the Beta Israel in Ethiopia was in 1952</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The practice seems to have been disbanded as a result of the wars in Ethiopia and later absorption of the community by Israel.</p>\n\n\n",

As we procede to the Sefirot of Atzilut, this unified time starts to divide. The first division is into 6 parts, each 1,000 years long (each of the 6 emotional attributes of Atzilut is the source of each 1,000 years, and the order of time arises from the fact that there is an order of Sefirot - see the source for more information). This is \"Hashem's time\", because the Sefirot of Atzilut represent, from our point of view, the \"perspective\" of Hashem, so to speak.</p>\n<p>These further divide and divide until we get the continuum of time as we know it on the material plane. Picture, if you will, time as an upside down tree with one trunk, and then 6 branches, and these branches divide and divide and divide, and on the bottom level we have the flow of time we experience in our world.</p>\n<p>Is it used in other places other than the 6 days of creation? It is used in Midrash Tanchuma VaYeshev 4 to explain that the Torah preceded the world by 2,000 years, due to combining Tehillim 90:4's logic with Mishlei 8:31:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The Torah] was reared by Him and was His play thing day by day</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>2 days = 2,000 years.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Traditionally, the book of Psalms is said to be written by David, not Moses.</p>\n<p>And the way I understand that verse, it doesn't put an upper limit on G-d's time factor, as time since \"yesterday\" can be anything from a full 47 hours and 59 minutes and 59 seconds (start of yesterday to end of today) to a tiny amount of time (end of yesterday to start of today), it does imply that 1 day counted by G-d is usually at least 500 years by our counting.</p>\n<p>As G-d can vary His speed at will, this also makes the 6 day creation in Genesis 1 consistent with the conception of the modern cosmological and evolutionary timeline as reported by many faithful scientists .  It even allows G-d to temporarily slow down to human speed to have conversations with Adam, Abraham, Israel and others, while also giving attention to believers created near other stars.</p>\n<p>Just as G-d told Jakob a way to rear additional black sheep during the stay with Laban, He could equally have given a command for all the land based animals to evolve on Earth while He spent most of that day creating a nature in many other places .</p>\n<p>Human counting of years didn't become accurate until late in the first scroll of the Torah, thus the seemingly impossible lifespans of early humans written there, while the time before Adam is known only from what G-d has told us from His perspective.  Just as a herder of sheep does not control the placement of each straw in the mouths of the flock, G-d need not have adjusted every word about time in the Torah to reflect an accurate count of human years between events.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How would you respond to this claim by Christians?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My friend is an evangelical pastor and he argues that Christ could be the messiah through the female linage of Mary, I am currently struggling to respond to this and wondered how you would respond? I've included a transcript of what he said below:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The was from the direct linage of David. You say “The biological father\ndecides which tribe the son belongs to.”. This isn’t so in Jewish\ntradition. Although it’s difficult to show why the Rabbis use the\nmaternal line, nevertheless they do. So Mary's genealogy (Luke 3) is\nthe determining factor.</p>\n<p>You need to remember that the eligibility of Jesus for being entitled\nto the throne is a question for the Jews to settle. Not ‘us\nwesterners’. Let’s look at some criteria they expect. Remember that\ndue to the historical split, there are two distinct branches for this\nnation. Judah, (and Benjamin), and Israel (Northern 10 tribes).</p>\n<p>The requirements for sitting on the throne for Judah was Davidic\ndescendancy. No one was allowed to sit on David's throne unless he was\na member of the house of David. Now the ‘key point’ here is house of\nDavid. Not bloodline.</p>\n<p>This is crucial - because there was a curse put onto Davids bloodline.\nFrom Jeconiah. (Jeremiah 22 24-30). So Jesus couldn’t be a ‘blood’\ndescendant of David! That’s why Jesus couldn’t have a ‘blood’\nconnection to Joseph. But nevertheless had a connection to David\nthrough Joseph, as Joseph was ‘legally’ [in Jewish/Mosaic law] Jesus’s\nfather.</p>\n<p>So Jesus had a ‘legally accepted’ connection to the house of David\nthrough both Joseph, and Mary - and also was not ‘under’ the curse God\npronounced on Jeconiah.</p>\n<p>Now for the Northern house of Israel - to be King here, came by\nprophetic sanction or divine appointment. So ‘technically’ Jesus had\nto be eligible under two sets of requirements.</p>\n<p>So, why or how could Jesus claim the throne of David? He was a member\nof the house of David apart from Jeconiah. And, He alone received\ndivine appointment to that throne: (“The Lord God will give him the\nthrone of his father David</p>\n<p>I</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>You can't win of you argue this point. If you focus on minutiae, the pastor will call you a minutiae oriented Pharisee who misses the big picture.</p>\n<p>He could say that Jesus inherits his kingship from his father, God. (Or that. David dies, God inherits him, passes to his son). Remember, protestants don't have a stodgy pope holding their theology in check.</p>\n<p>Jesus's non Messiahship is based on his failure to actually rule, ingather exiles, revive all of the dead (not just a few people) etc. its the big things that matter.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><strong>God's word in the Hebrew Bible indicates that Tribal affiliation is <strong>patrilinear</strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Numbers 1:2</strong></p>\n<p>Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel, by families following their <strong>fathers'</strong> houses.</p>\n<p><strong>Ibid. 1:18</strong></p>\n<p>and they assembled all the congregation on the first day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees according to their families according to their <strong>fathers'</strong> houses.</p>\n<p><strong>Ezra 2:59</strong></p>\n<p>but they could not tell their <strong>fathers'</strong> houses and their children, if they were from Israel.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>Given the great lengths the gospel writers went to spell out Jesus' \"exact\" genealogy from David, they were evidently well aware that according to Biblical Law tribal affiliation goes exclusively via the father, and they intended to establish that.</strong></p>\n<p>In both putative genealogies of Jesus; in Matthew 1:6, and the other in Luke 3:31, the ancestry of David is mentioned ... for Jesus (<strong>not Mary</strong>).</p>\n<p>Consider also Luke 1:27, which plainly asserts that it is Joseph who was from the House of David, <strong>not Mary</strong>.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in Luke 2:4, the author writes that the reason it was necessary for Joseph and Mary to return to Bethlehem, was because it was Joseph, <strong>not Mary</strong>, who was from the House of David.</p>\n<p><strong>According to the Hebrew Bible, the Messiah will be a patrilineal descendant of King David, something that Jesus could never be; since according to the legend of the virgin birth, he did not have a biological father.</strong></p>\n<p>There is no basis in Jewish law for a father passing on his tribal line by adoption. So Joseph adopting baby Jesus, who allegedly had no Jewish tribal lineage, could not make Jesus part of Joseph's tribe.</p>\n\n\n",

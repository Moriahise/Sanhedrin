    "content": "# Is everyone capable of prophecy?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I have spoken to people who bring the idea that Bilaam was a prophet and therefore non-Jews can be prophets. But that was specific to the context and hence is no proof. G-d wanted to give the non-Jews a leader of equal spiritual calibre so that they would not have the excuse of not having the likes of Moshe. Does it say anywhere that non-Jews can be prophets? Or anyone can be prophets for that matter?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In his <em>Epistle to Yemen</em>, Rambam writes very clearly that non-Jews can be prophets:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our disbelief in the prophecies of Omar and Zeid is not due to the fact that they are non-Jews, as the unlettered folk imagine, and in consequence of it are compelled to establish their stand from the biblical phrase <em>from among your own people</em>. For Job, Zophar, Bildd, Eliphaz, and Elihu are all considered prophets by us although they are not Israelites.</p>\n<p>(Halkin translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that this does not mean that <em>anyone</em> can be a prophet though. In <em>Guide for the Perplexed</em> 2:32 Rambam describes the limitations on who can become a prophet:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly there are three different opinions on Prophecy. I will not notice the view of the Atheist; he does not believe in the Existence of God, much less in Prophecy; but I will content myself with discussing the various opinions [on Prophecy] held by those who believe in God.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Among those who believe in Prophecy, and even among our coreligionists, there are some ignorant people who think as follows: God selects any person He pleases, inspires him with the spirit of Prophecy, and entrusts him with a mission. It makes no difference whether that person be wise or stupid, old or young; provided he be, to some extent, morally good. For these people have not yet gone so far as to maintain that God might also inspire a wicked person with His spirit. They admit that this is impossible, unless God has previously caused him to improve his ways.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The philosophers hold that prophecy is a certain faculty of man in a state of perfection, which can only be obtained by study. Although the faculty is common to the whole race, yet it is not fully developed in each individual, either on account of the individual's defective constitution, or on account of some other external cause. This is the case with every faculty common to a class. It is only brought to a state of perfection in some individuals, and not in all; but it is impossible that it should not be perfect in some individual of the class; and if the perfection is of such a nature that it can only be produced by an agent, such an agent must exist. Accordingly, it is impossible that an ignorant person should be a prophet; or that a person being no prophet in the evening, should, unexpectedly on the following morning, find himself a prophet, as if prophecy were a thing that could be found unintentionally. But if a person, perfect in his intellectual and moral faculties, and also perfect, as far as possible, in his imaginative faculty, prepares himself in the manner which will be described, he must become a prophet; for prophecy is a natural faculty of man. It is impossible that a man who has the capacity for prophecy should prepare himself for it without attaining it, just as it is impossible that a person with a healthy constitution should be fed well, and yet not properly assimilate his food; and the like.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>The third view is that which is taught in Scripture, and which forms one of the principles of our religion. It coincides with the opinion of the philosophers in all points except one. For we believe that, even if one has the capacity for prophecy, and has duly prepared himself, it may yet happen that he does not actually prophesy. It is in that case the will of God [that withholds from him the use of the faculty]. According to my opinion, this fact is as exceptional as any other miracle, and acts in the same way. For the laws of Nature demand that every one should be a prophet, who has a proper physical constitution, and has been duly prepared as regards education and training. If such a person is not a prophet, he is in the same position as a person who, like Jeroboam (1 Kings xiii.), is deprived of the use of his hand, or of his eyes, as was the case with the army of Syria, in the history of Elisha (2 Kings vi. 18). As for the principle which I laid down, that preparation and perfection of moral and rational faculties are the <em>sine quâ non</em>, our Sages say exactly the same: \"The spirit of prophecy only rests upon persons who are wise, strong, and rich.\" We have explained these words in our Commentary on the Mishnah, and in our large work.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(<a href=\"https://www.sacred-texts.com/jud/gfp/gfp119.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Friedlander translation</a>, my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>According to Rambam anyone with a high level of intellect and moral perfection can become a potential prophet.

Hello Mi Yodeya!</p>\n<p>Edit: Sefaria has some cool visualizations like the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/visualize/library\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Words Sunburst</a> and this <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/visualize/sefer-hachinukh-mitzvot\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">parallel sets chart</a> that categorizes mitzvot mentioned in Sefer HaChinukh.  I wonder what kind of structure would be able to properly visualize this wider understand of authorities and their spheres of influence.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>I think the linked infographic could use significant modification.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don't know why the transmission of the Torah to Moshe is termed \"Semicha\". It might be termed prophecy, or \"receiving.\" Semicha is a term describing the (ancient) process of rabbinic ordination in which the elder rabbi would rest his hands on the newly ordained, deeming him a reliable authority for ruling in matters of jewish law.</li>\n<li>There seems to be general blurring between canonicity and legally binding material. The books of Nakh are certainly more authoritative than the later rabbinic works, even if they are not legal in nature.</li>\n<li>Within legal literature the binding/opinion dichotomy is misleading. While later works of rabbinic interpretation might not have the force of a ruling from the sanhedrin, terming them mere opinion that they are therefore only suggestions. There are positions found in the Mishna, Tosefta, Talmuds etc that are not followed because they are disputed by an equal authority, while the opinion that is accepted would be deemed authoritative by later scholars.</li>\n<li>\"these works are authoritative only when reiterating the sanhedrin's rulings\" Firstly, \"reiterating\" betrays the very significant role interpretation plays. Only a fraction of the legal literature is merely reiterating what has already been made clear. Secondly, and more significantly, the role of rabbinic enactments is wholly ignored. These enactments are binding by authority of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.17.11?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Devarim 17:11</a> and can be enacted even after the sanhedrin.</li>\n<li>The division between codification of court rulings and commentaries is simply incorrect.</li>\n<li>The assertion that non legal parts of the mishna are not part of the oral law is subject to dispute. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.1?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">See here</a>.</li>\n<li>Even after the authentic semicha tradition ceased, the title was still used throughout the medieval period, well before the re-establishment of the semicha by R Yaakov BeiRav.</li>\n<li>R Yaakov BeiRav's revival of semicha was not meant to be ceremonial but was actually an attempt to revive the ancient Semicha, on the basis of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_The_Sanhedrin_and_the_Penalties_within_their_Jurisdiction.4.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam's position</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p>Regarding your last question: Mishneh Torah was Rambam's monumental work of halacha. He took the whole of the jewish legal tradition (mainly the Mishna/Talmuds but also the other books in the green bar in the graphic) and organized it topically, translated it into a simpler dialect of hebrew, and decided between opinions in cases of dispute. Shulchan Arukh is R' Yosef Karo's summary of his Beit Yosef which was written some 500 years after Rambam and aims to update the discussion by collecting much of what had been discussed by subsequent works. This might be best thought of as the opposite of Rambam's approach to codification-- while decisions are met and material is reorganized, the text serves to extend the discussions in their original form in rabbinic hebrew and centered around the talmudic discussion (in substance even if not in form-- it is written as a commentary on yet another code called the Tur.) It is this summary that has gained significant popularity since it's composition, serving as the starting point for subsequent discussions, and is colloquially synonymous with Halacha as it is practiced today.</p>\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodea. I hope this helps to clarify some of the finer points of the tradition of Jewish texts.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Welcome to Mi Yodeya. I am not sure who made this list, but it contains major errors. For one thing, Semicha did not end until the time of the Amoraim. As a general rule, anyone who is given the title Rav or Rebbe in the Gemara received Semicha.</p>\n<p>For another, the ultimate source for Jewish Law is not the Mishnah, but the Talmud Bavli. There are many cases where the Talmud says the law does not follow a particular Mishnah. Since the \"sealing\" of the Talmud, almost all discussions of law are to interpret the Talmud Bavli.</p>\n<p>And even where there are disputes, the opinions of various Rabbis are binding on their communities. To say no opinions after the Sanhedrin are binding is flat out wrong.</p>\n<p>And the various lists seem very haphazardly done.

So G-d commanded that when one sins, he should bring an offering, lean his hands on it (deed); confess verbally (speech); burn the innards and the kidneys (the organs of thought and desire) and the legs (corresponding to the human being's hands and feet, with which he does his work); and sprinkle the blood (corresponding to the blood that is his life-force). He should think, when all of the above is done, that he sinned against his G-d with his body and soul, and deserves to have his own blood spilled and his body burned, were it not for G-d's kindness, Who takes from him a substitute...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaChinukh.95.10?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Hachinuch (95)</a> cites this and adds another point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צִוָּנוּ הָאֵל לְהַקְרִיב לְעוֹלָם מֵהַדְּבָרִים שֶׁלֵּב בְּנֵי אָדָם חוֹמֵד מֵהֶם כְּמוֹ הַבָּשָׂר וְהַיַּיִן וְהַפַּת כְּדֵי שֶׁיִּתְעוֹרֵר הַלֵּב יוֹתֵר עִם הָעֵסֶק בָּהֶם, וְלֶעָנִי חִיֵּב לְהָבִיא מִמְּעַט קִמְחוֹ אֲשֶׁר עֵינָיו וְלִבּוֹ עָלָיו כָּל הַיּוֹם.</p>\n<p>G-d commanded us to offer things that people desire, such as meat, wine and bread, so that one's thoughts are more powerfully affected by dealing with them.

A story from A Treasury of Chassidic Tales (Festivals, pp. 73-4) illustrates this well:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...Does that sound to you like a fitting punishment - that a sinner... should bring a guilt-offering that costs him two silver coins?...</p>\n<p>...\"Mind you, it was not as simple as some people might fancy. Imagine some villager coming up to Jerusalem in order to offer such a sacrifice. The poor ignoramus probably isn't familiar with the ins and outs of the law, so first he has to call on the Sanhedrin high court in order to be told exactly what sacrifice he is obliged to offer... the guards at the door no doubt ask him what business brings him there. So he has to tell them just what happened... Then he appears before the Sanhedrin and repeats his story. They rebuke him sternly, and send him off to the <em>Kohen Gadol</em>. The High Priest likewise makes sure that he grasps the seriousness of his sin... these two <em>kohanim</em> utilize the opportunity of making their moralistic observations on the regrettable circumstances...</p>\n<p>\"Feeling very sorry for himself, the poor fellow makes his way miserably toward the <em>kohen</em> who will actually perform the sacrifice - but at this point he has to make his confession. The <em>kohen</em> gives a signal to the Levites who are waiting there with their musical instruments. Within seconds the air is made heavy by a gloomy melody, whose somber strains cleave his innards and arouse in him pangs of conscience and intense remorse. He is overcome by the tears of a true penitent, until by the time the sacrifice is over he is like a man reborn, resurrected from the dead.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(There is, by the way, a hilarious adaptation of this - which in turn helps us absorb the message - in R. Fischel Schachter's A World of Middos CDs for Parshas Vayikra.)</p>\n<p>If only we could summon up the same panoply of emotions every time we pray!</p>\n\n\n",

To demonstrate his zeal for his\nnewly adopted faith, he began preaching to the Jewish communities that\nMohammed was a divinely sent prophet alluded to in the Bible and that\nIslam was a new, divinely revealed religion superseding Judaism.\nHence, the apostate argued, the Jews should yield to the ruler's\ndemand and embrace Mohammedanism.

He\nconsoled them by telling them that the Jews are a unique and\nindestructible nation; that all the past and present sufferings and\npersecutions were foretold by the Prophets, and just as in the past\nthe nations had failed to annihilate the Jewish people or destroy the\nJewish religion, so will the present persecution fail, and peace and\ntranquility will return to the community.</p>\n<p>He contemptuously dismissed and disproved the assertion that Judaism has been supplanted by Islam and <strong>showed that the claim that Mohammed\nis alluded to in the Bible is based upon nonsensical interpretations\nrecognized as such even by the Moslems themselves.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Rambam advised that the self-proclaimed Messiah is nothing but an impostor and no doubt a madman.</strong> He urged them to remain firm in the\nbelief that G‑d will send the true Moshiach to redeem the Jewish\npeople from suffering in exile at the proper time.</p>\n<p>The epistle accomplished its purpose - the Yemenite Jews remained\nfaithful to their religion in the face of their bitter suffering.\nRabbi Moshe ben Maimon used his influence at the court of Saladin in\nEgypt to intervene in their behalf, and the persecution came to an\nend.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As noted in your original source, in his compendium of Jewish Law (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Melachim-uMilchamot-Chapter-11.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mishne Torah Melachim 11:4</a>), Maimonides wrote that Jesus and Muhamad served to prepare the way for the true Messiah by turning people to monotheists.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ultimately, all the deeds of Jesus of Nazareth and that Ishmaelite who\narose after him will only serve to prepare the way for Mashiach's\ncoming and the improvement of the entire world, motivating the nations\nto serve God together</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Assembly decreased in size until they returned to a quorum of seventy, at which point, once someone died, his colleagues appointed in his place one of the great sages of that generation and that person had the authority to act on behalf of Israel. And other sages of that generation could not say, \"We are also Hashem's disciples, we are elders,\" because the number of members of the great tribunal was by virtue of the ordination of the members of the Great Assembly, followed by the \"Remnants of the Great Assembly,\" so called once they started decreasing from one hundred and twenty. The members of the tribunal in the second generation were appointed by a decision of the members of the Great Assembly, and so each of the sages of the third were appointed according to the instruction of the sages of the second generation. This was the association of those who were re-appointed as heads of all of that generation's sages, and it was not possible to challenge their expertise.

From my understanding there is no real difference between halacha/hashkafa since the Rambam paskens both of them and many times hashkafa crosses into halacha. Therefore the same \"growth\" would follow both. Listen to one person, as you grow you should hear other opinions but still follow your \"rebbi\".

Instead, it is a book with a message, and written by a prophet.</p>\n<p>The book of Samuel contains the prophecy that King David is G-d's choice to be the king, and that all future kings must be his descendants. This is an extremely important prophecy.</p>\n<p>The reason why there is a discussion of Esther and the works of Shlomo HaMelech is that there were disputes as to whether they were part of Tanakh at all. Everyone agreed that if they were part of Tanakh they were written with Ruach HaKodesh and vica versa. The question is if they were.</p>\n<p>The question by Esther is that it was written specifically to be read on Purim. Perhaps it was never meant to be part of Tanakh. Perhaps it was not even written with Ruach HaKodesh; it was just a chronicle of a miracle to be recited annually. Therefore the Gemara discusses proofs that it <em>was</em> written with Ruach HaKodesh, and the disputes whether it was meant to <em>also</em> be part of Tanakh.</p>\n<p>The question about the books of Shlomo HaMelech is similar. Perhaps these are records of the saying of the wisest of men, and therefore very worthy of study and transmission, but not written with Ruach HaKodesh. Some Tannnaim followed this view. So the Gemara brings proofs to show that these works are more than just Shlomo's wisdom.</p>\n\n\n",

It should be noted that this does not necessarily contradict the gemara; we may say that the gemara refers to the earlier version of Sefer Shmuel, before it was edited by Yirmiyahu.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> I noticed something interesting today. There are (at least) two parts in Shoftim that hint at a significantly later re-edit of the book. The first is pretty explicit: In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Judges.18.30?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shoftim 18:30</a> it says that \"and Jonathan son of Gershom son of Manasseh and his descendants, served as priests to the Danite tribe until the land went into exile.\" - while obviously any prophet could potentially foresee the exile, adding it into a book addressed to generations that knew nothing of the exile would make it pretty meaningless. Therefore, that means that this verse was added in by someone - likely Yirmiyahu - who lived after the exile of Dan.</p>\n<p>The second point is less explicit. In the same verse, it says that the Levite who became a priest of idolatry to the Danites was Yehonatan ben Gershom ben Menashe, and the Nun of Menashe is written in the Masoretic text as hanging above the word. The gemara <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.109b.8-9?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that this Yehonatan was a descendant of Moshe and \"Rather, although he was the son of Moses, because he acted as Manasseh the king of Judah, who was notorious for idol worship, acted, the verse linked him to Manasseh by calling him “the son of Manasseh.\" - obviously such a reference would have only been understood by people from Menashe's time and after, so it seems that even the gemara admits the existence of a later re-edit of Shoftim by another person - again, likely Yirmiyahu.</p>\n\n\n",

[This is presumably in line with the opinion that says that Eliyahu was the same as Pinchas (either literally or spiritually)].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיה סלוקו בעבר הירדן, הוא המקום שבו נתכהן פינחס כשהרג את זמרי וזכה\nלברית שלום תחת אשר קינא לאלקיו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>4</strong>. In another approach; the “Rama MiPano” explains  (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=7366&st=&pgnum=32\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yonas Eilem, Chapter 15</a>) that the eastern side of the Jordan River, is unique in that it is a <strong>ממוצע</strong>, a state of holiness that is between the sanctity of Eretz Yisrael and the status of Chutz La’aretz. It was therefore appropriate for Eliyahu to depart this world from such an in-between place, since he was destined to make future appearances, both in Eretz Yisrael, and in Chutz La’aretz.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיה בעבר הירדן, מקום ממוצע בין קדושת הארץ וחוצה לה, הואיל ויש לו רשות\nלהראות בכל מקום אשר ישאהו רוח השם</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Animal Sentience in Judaism\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Leaving aside related concepts that might stem from this conversation such as veganism or animal rights...The more I read Tanakh the more it seems to me that the Torah and Tanakh as a whole view animals as sentient beings. God open's up the Donkey's mouth, but scripture doesn't imply that God told the donkey what to say. The donkey instead takes the opportunity to air its personal grievances, and even discusses its long memory of being good to its master.</p>\n<p>Nineveh is spared not just because of people, but because of the animals who live there. The psalms discuss how the animals cry to God for their food. The animals in the story of Noah seem to travel to the ark on their own, as if God told them to go there and they figured it out without needing to be rounded up. God sends ravens to feed Elijah, and it's spoken of in a matter of fact way and not in a overtly miraculous way. We can't forget the serpent in the garden of eden, who was described as the most wise of the animals, implying that animals were made with a capacity for wisdom. Proverbs discusses learning from ants and other animals. But even after Tanakh I've also noticed various midrashim that discuss speaking animals that argue and reason, such as Elijah's bull which didn't want to be sacrificed to Baal. Or a donkey sold to a non Jew that refused to work on the Sabbath. Or Rabbis talking about learning traits of holiness from animals. It seems like Judaism early on took for granted that animals possessed more sentience than what we see in later Jewish works.</p>\n<p>As other's have answered, the Rambam is a pivotal figure in arguing that animals have emotion and imagination but he also argues that animals have no intellect or reasoning abilities. This argument seems to be counter not only to Tanakh and Talmudic sayings, but also to modern science which shows without a doubt that <a href=\"https://www.sciencealert.com/crows-are-so-smart-they-can-make-compound-tools-out-of-multiple-parts\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">animals can reason, plan ahead, and build compound tools.</a></p>\n<p>So does Judaism have a core concept of animals being sentient (not just emotional) beings?

Past aveirot can be so severe that a person cannot yet reincarnate as a human being. Instead, he or she may need to reincarnate as an animal, vegetation, or something inanimate like a rock.

(Sha’ar HaGilgulim, chap. 22).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as the difference between an animal and human in regards to their soul, many sefarim discuss the \"nefesh habahamis\" referring to an animalistic soul within a person. It would infer that animals themselves possess this trait as well.

However, not all souls are created equal. As described in Genesis 2:7, every human being has both a \"nefesh\" and a \"neshama.\" The nefesh is defined as an animal soul – the life force, the instinctual, animalistic drives. The neshama, in contrast, is a purely spiritual component, a divine spark which distinguishes man from animal. This is the part of us which yearns for spirituality and closeness to God.</p>\n<p>Humans and animals all engage in emotional responses such as love, fear, loyalty, imagination, memory, intelligence, etc. We run from danger, have survival instincts, and are driven to procreate. This all emanates from the lower animal soul.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Lastly, you mentioned Billam's donkey. The Gemarah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.54a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 54a</a> mentions it as one of the 10 things created on the first Erev Shabbos of creation,  so it was not an ordinary donkey but rather a special creation which may not have bearing on other animals.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>As one of the answers noted, Rambam is what first comes to mind. The Rambam had compassion for animals. For example, Rambam explains that we scare away the mother bird to prevent her from seeing her young being taken. If, however, the eggs are unfit for food, we may leave them as they are.[1]</p>\n<p>In the Guide of the Perplexed, (3:48. Translation of M. Friedlander) Rambam explained that animals also have feelings. Yet despite this ruling, today many still practice cruelty when they do kapparos. It is a horrible mistreating of chickens. It is why Rambam did not list it in his code of Jewish law book. Rambam felt the pain of animals. He was very sensitive and showed compassion for them. This was why Rambam took a strong stand against sacrifices, saying that G-d neither needs nor wants sacrifices. G-d declares:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“For I (G-d) spoke not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day\nthat I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt\nofferings or sacrifice. But this thing I commanded them, saying, <em>‘Obey\nMy voice.’</em>”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding the animals mentioned in Scripture, snakes do not speak and neither did the donkey to Balaam. These are metaphors. Regarding the feeding by ravens, it was most likely locals (ravens) who brought Elijah food. But yes, animals are sentient beings and have souls. They must be treated as you wish to be treated. For example, according to Jewish law, you must feed your pet before yourself.</p>\n<p>[1] The Zohar takes the cruel position that it is permitted to eat the eggs regardless.</p>\n\n\n",

But it is a very interesting question! On Erev Shabbos they needed a double portion of Manna for a combination of two reasons:\n#1) No Manna would fall on Shabbos; and\n#2) They needed to eat meals on Shabbos.\nOn Yom Kippur, consideration #1 indeed applies, since no Manna would fall on Yom Kippur [1]. But consideration #2 might appear to be irrelevant, since we are not supposed to eat anything on Yom Kippur. Therefore, one might argue that no extra portion of Manna should be necessary on Erev Yom Kippur.\nOn the other hand, there typically are people who need to eat on Yom Kippur for health reasons; and so an extra portion of Manna might be appropriate for those special cases.

Rabbi Elazar, son of Rabbi Shimon, says: Since the world is judged by its majority, i.e., depending on whether people have performed a majority of mitzvot or a majority of sins, and an individual is likewise judged by his majority, each person must consider that if he performs one mitzva he is praiseworthy, as he tilts the balance of himself and the entire world to the scale of merit. Conversely, if he transgresses one prohibition, woe to him, as he tilts the balance for himself and the entire world to the scale of liability, as it is stated: “But one sin destroys much good,” i.e., due to one sin that this individual commits, he squanders much goodness from himself and from the entire world.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There is a disagreement among both the Rishonim and later Poskim if this applies to non-Jews in general, or only to idol worshippers. According to the latter view this prohibition would not be relevant in most cases. Even according to the former view exceptions can often be made for a variety of reasons, including darkei shalom and other principles which greatly limit the practical scope of the prohibition. A Rav is <a href=\"https://torasavigdor.org/rav-avigdor-miller-on-being-kind-hearted-to-gentiles/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">quoted here</a> as arguing that the prohibition only applies in cases where it's being done for no reason (this idea is found in the achronim, see for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Turei_Zahav_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.151.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Taz</a>), but doing something to improve your character counts as a valid reason and takes it out of the realm of the prohibition altogether even according to the more stringent view. In his words,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Decent Jews are kind hearted and polite to everybody!  אמרו עליו על רבן יוחנן בן זכאי שלא הקדימו אדם שלום מעולם – It was said about Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakai that nobody ever said shalom to him in the street before he said shalom to them.  He was the first one to greet a man.  ואפילו נכרי בשוק – even gentiles in the street; when he encountered a gentile, he was the first one to greet him.  That’s politeness. That’s how a Jew behaves.\n...The truth is that Jews are always kind hearted to everybody; only that the mitzvah of loving a Jew is a specific mitzvah that’s only for fellow Jews. You don’t have that mitzvah for anybody else.</p>\n<p>But to be kind and polite, that’s not even a question. It’s not an\nissur of lo sechanem.

Part of that proof, they say, is that the Torah states that no other people will claim a national revelation and live. I'm not asking if that statement is true or not, but I'm wondering if the Torah really says that. The verse they cite is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.4.32?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&a\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 4:32</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כִּ֣י שְׁאַל־נָא֩ לְיָמִ֨ים רִֽאשֹׁנִ֜ים אֲשֶׁר־הָי֣וּ לְפָנֶ֗יךָ לְמִן־הַיּוֹם֙ אֲשֶׁר֩ בָּרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים ׀ אָדָם֙ עַל־הָאָ֔רֶץ וּלְמִקְצֵ֥ה הַשָּׁמַ֖יִם וְעַד־קְצֵ֣ה הַשָּׁמָ֑יִם הֲנִֽהְיָ֗ה כַּדָּבָ֤ר הַגָּדוֹל֙ הַזֶּ֔ה א֖וֹ הֲנִשְׁמַ֥ע כָּמֹֽהוּ׃</p>\n<p>You have but to inquire about bygone ages that came before you, ever since God created man on earth, from one end of heaven to the other: has anything as grand as this ever happened, or has its like ever been known?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, this verse is explicitly talking about the past. Never before the Jewish people was there a claim of national revelation. Fine. But where is it evident this verse is also talking about the future? Is it something that is perforce somewhere in the verse, with regards to its wording or grammar? Do any of the commentaries point this out?</p>\n<p>I'm interested in a demonstration from the verse itself, as this verse is supposed to convince the non-believer.</p>\n<p>Note: I once asked one of these outreach Rabbis where they saw it in the verse. They said it's obvious that it's included in the verse, because otherwise there's no reason for the Torah to say it. Meaning, there isn't a novelty in the verse unless it includes the future as well.

None of the first born objected to the priesthood being set up. Nor did anyone object to commandments that would not be logical restrictions nor did they object to sudden restrictions (such as shaatnez or kashrus) which would (supposedly) never have existed before.

The evidence is as\nfollows: Universally, there is a single account of how the Jewish\npeople received the Torah. It states that on the sixth day of the\nthird month of the year 2448 from Creation, an entire nation full of\ndissidents and skeptics gathered at the foot of a mountain in the\nSinai Desert and witnessed how G‑d spoke with Moses. Rather\noverwhelmed by the experience, they asked Moses to kindly fetch all\nthe details of what exactly G‑d would like from them and report on it.\nWhich he did, over a period of forty years wandering in the desert.\nMoses also charged the people to keep multiple copies of the written\nrecord, which they did, and so we have many copies of that record to\nthis day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

It was compiled by Rabi Yehuda Hanasi, after the understanding was reached that the oral Torah must be written down to prevent important parts of it being forgotten, although ideally it should have remained oral.\nIn the Mishna, Rebi (short for Rabi Yehuda Hanasi) included the Rabbi's opinions which he saw most clear, and cited the opinion which he believed was most concrete first, unnamed, so that learners not refrain from concluding Halachah according to that opinion out of concern that it may only be a singular opinion. He aimed to be as brief and as to the point as he could - as the sages tell us (Pesachim 3b) לעולם ישנה אדם לתלמידו דרך קצרה - one must always strive to teach his student the abridged version. Rashi explains there, since the abridged version will be easier to memorise.</p>\n<p>However, with the decline of the generations it was harder for us to grasp the true meaning and understanding of such an abridged abridged compilation. Thus the Amoraim Rabbis had to assist in translating and determining the meaning of alot of Mishnas. In fact, the name Amoraim means \"translators\" in Aramaic, as that it the role they fulfilled. Many times, the used 'Braitas' to help understand, or refute an understanding of the Mishna, literally meaning 'external', as they are the teachings from the Tannaim which didn't make the final cut into the Mishnah. The Tosefta is one such compilation of teachings.</p>\n\n\n",

Knowing that we the readers may not know what a לווקן is, the Mehaber tells us that it is דהיינו שהוא לבן הרבה (a person that is very white). It is important to note however, that he is furnishing an interpretation of what a לווקן is.</p>\n<p>The term in its non-elaborated form appears in Berakhoth 58b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ראה את הכושי ואת הגיחור ואת <strong>הלווקן</strong> ואת הקפח ואת הננס ואת הדרניקוס\nאומר ברוך משנה הבריות</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where it states, without elaboration, that one is obligated to recite the blessing upon seeing the lavqan.</p>\n<p>The term לבקן/לווקן/לוקן is likely a borrowing of the Greek λευκον (<em>levkon</em> literally, white).</p>\n<p>In determining what this term means it is helpful to consider other instances where it is found in Hazalic literature.</p>\n<p>The term is also utilized in the Mishnah Bekhoroth 7:6:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הכושי, והגיחור, <strong>והלבקן</strong>, והקפח, והננס, והחרש, והשוטה, והשכור, ובעלי\nנגעים טהורין, פסולין באדם, וכשרין בבהמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where it is specified that a לבקן is disqualified from performing Temple duties.</p>\n<p>The Gemara on the Mishnah (Bekhoroth 45b) attempts to clarify what לבקן means by citing the case of a peddler:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לבקן חיוורא כההוא דאמר להו מאן בעי לוקיאני ואישתכח חיוורי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>a lavqan is one who is white, as in the case of that person who said: \"Who wants [to purchase] a lavqiyani?\", and it was found to be white.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi (ad loc) explains that lavqiyani were white sheep:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לוקייני - טלאים לבנים היו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rambam in his perush on the Mishnah there characterizes the לבקן as:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הלבן כחלב</p>\n<p>one that is white like cheese</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Out of all this all that emerges is that a lavqan is someone who is \"white\" or perhaps excessively white... however this doesn't really explain whether it is describing a phenotypic difference (e.g. racially \"white\") or whether it intends something more anomalous (e.g. those lacking pigmentation and thus appearing to be very \"white\" relative to the rest of the population).</p>\n<p>I believe that it is the Tifereth Yisrael (R. Yisrael Lifshitz, 1782–1860) that first <em>explicitly</em> identified the לבקן with albinism (Yakhin uBoaz Negaim 2:1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יש שנולד כך משונה בעורו ונקרא בל\"א אלבינוס והוא מום באדם ונקרא בלשון\nהמשנה לבקן בכורות פ\"ז מ\"ו</p>\n<p>There are those born with different skin, who are called in the\nvernacular \"<strong>albinus</strong>\" which is a human defect described in the\nlanguage of the Mishnah as <strong>\"lavqan\"</strong> (e.g. Bekhoroth 7:6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While I believe it is fair to assume that albinism was intended by the nomenclature all along, it isn't until the early 19th c. that it was explicitly fleshed out as such. Assuming that the language of lavqan employed by the Mishnah/Talmud intended albinism all along, then yes - as per Berakhoth 58b and as codified (OH 225:8), one ought recite the blessing of משנה הבריות upon witnessing such a person.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Tangentially, it ought be noted that where reciting it aloud is likely to bring feelings of embarrassment or shame to the person about whom the blessing is recited, it should be recited discreetly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Piskei Teshuvos 225:20 concludes that the Bracha should only be recited upon seeing a person who has a very significant change.</p>\n\n\n",

He explains that there are four differences between the two censuses:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In the second census, there was no order to count specifically the males like in the first census.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>No women are mentioned in the first census, while in the second one the daughters of Tzelophchad and Serach bat Asher are mentioned.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the first census the people were counted according to tribes while in the second one, they were counted according to tribes and families/clans.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the first census, the Torah writes twice that the census came to count those that were aged twenty and above and were military-able, which is not mentioned in the second census. Rather, it simply says there \"This is the enrollment of the Israelites\" and nothing else.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>From these differences it may be inferred that in the first census, only males aged twenty and above and able to serve in the military were counted, while in the second census, heads of households were counted. This is why women were included: When there was no male at the head of the household, the females assumed that position.</p>\n<p>Based on this understanding, we now see that the number of Israelites at the time of the second census was significantly less than what it was during the first census. The total numbers of the censuses are similar - but the <em>percentage</em> of people counted differs significantly. A much larger percent of people from the nation was counted in the second census. Thus we might say that Am Yisrael was made up of a few million or so during the time of the first census, but was made up of many fewer people during the second one. Dr. Meitlis figures they numbered about a third of what they did during the first census.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Your question poses 3 verses that seem to indicate that Israel was a smaller nation.

That all 7 nations together were larger than the Israelites. Then it goes on to state that they shouldn't think the reason they're going to win the wars were due to the fact that they were larger than each one individually, because they were actually smaller than all 7 together.\nThis explanation should answer the last verse as well along the same lines.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>When my son was very little, he commented on this verse to me: Israel must have been in the desert for a really long time, if they didn't know if they were the biggest nation or the smallest nation!<br />\nI don't think the Torah was being \"sarcastic\", ח\"ו. Israel's numbers were actually great; Moses said they were \"like the stars in heaven for their multitude\" (Devarim 1:10). But as the verse says, they were not <i>chosen</i> for that reason. That would be confusing cause and effect. He loved us, and he wanted to keep the oath he made to our fathers - <em>therefore</em>, he blessed us and multiplied our numbers. In the natural course of events, Avraham could not have had children at all; by nature, we are the least of the nations. Our numbers are only from his blessing.</p>\n\n\n",

When that happens, we always read the section containing Numbers 33:38 about Aharon's death on Rosh Chodesh Av. In most communities this week a double portion will be read, placing that calendrical coincidence well over halfway into the reading. However, even more rarely in leap years (next in 5812 and 5839) the weekly reading for Shabbat Rosh Chodesh Av is just the section <em>Mas'ei</em> placing that calendrical coincidence well within striking distance for the first reader.</p>\n<p>When <em>Mas'ei</em> is read alone the first reader generally reads until after verse 9*, but years ago when <em>Mas'ei</em> was last read alone on Shabbat Rosh Chodesh I recall a local rabbi announcing before the Torah reading that due to the rare calendrical coincidence, in order to have Aharon's death be read by a descendant of his, the first reader (a priest) would read all the way up to verse 50.</p>\n<p>*<sub>I know that some communities rearrange the printed section breaks whenever <em>Mas'ei</em> is read alone in order to not interrupt the list of 42 encampments (MA to OC 428:6), but this is generally done by having the first reader read only 3 verses and having the second reader read until verse 50. There may be other variations out there which have the priest read to verse 50 always, but nevertheless that isn't the practice asked about here.</sub></p>\n<p>Can someone point me to any information about this practice?

However from verse 39 and 40 it seems that Bnei Menashe conquered it and Moshe gave it them.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.26.29?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Numbers 26:29</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בְּנֵ֣י מְנַשֶּׁ֗ה לְמָכִיר֙ מִשְׁפַּ֣חַת הַמָּכִירִ֔י וּמָכִ֖יר הוֹלִ֣יד אֶת־גִּלְעָ֑ד לְגִלְעָ֕ד מִשְׁפַּ֖חַת הַגִּלְעָדִֽי׃\nDescendants of Manasseh: Of Machir, the clan of the Machirites.—Machir begot Gilead.—Of Gilead,\nthe clan of the Gileadites.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Question number 2 - Is there any source that connects the fact that the children of Machir were from Gilad and they conquered a place named Gilad?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.50.23?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 50:23</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיַּ֤רְא יוֹסֵף֙ לְאֶפְרַ֔יִם בְּנֵ֖י שִׁלֵּשִׁ֑ים גַּ֗ם בְּנֵ֤י מָכִיר֙ בֶּן־מְנַשֶּׁ֔ה יֻלְּד֖וּ עַל־בִּרְכֵּ֥י יוֹסֵֽף׃\nJoseph lived to see children of the third generation of Ephraim; the children of Machir son of\nManasseh were likewise born upon Joseph’s knees.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Question number 3 - Is there any source that connect the fact that Bnei Machir ben Menashe grew up with Yosef hatzaddik to the fact that they were able to conquer Gilad? Moreover, by Bnos Tzalfchod Rashi states that the verse mentions that they were from Yosef to tell us that just like Yosef loved Eretz Yisroel so did his offspring. However, here we see Bnei Menashe conquering and settling in Gilad instead of Eretz Yisroel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.26.24?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Numbers.26.24.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi Numbers 26:24</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אוֹמֵר אֲנִי שֶׁהָיוּ לְבֶלַע בְּנֵי בָנִים הַרְבֵּה, וּמִשְּׁנַיִם הַלָּלוּ, אַרְדְּ וְנַעֲמָן, יָצְאָה מִכָּל אֶחָד מִשְׁפָּחָה רַבָּה, וְנִקְרְאוּ תוֹלְדוֹת שְׁאָר הַבָּנִים עַל שֵׁם בֶּלַע, וְתוֹלְדוֹת הַשְּׁנַיִם הַלָּלוּ נִקְרְאוּ עַל שְׁמָם, וְכֵן אֲנִי אוֹמֵר בִּבְנֵי מָכִיר שֶׁנֶּחְלְקוּ לִשְׁתֵּי מִשְׁפָּחוֹת, אַחַת נִקְרֵאת עַל שְׁמוֹ, וְאַחַת נִקְרֵאת עַל שֵׁם  גִּלְעָד בְּנוֹ;\nI say that Bela had many grandchildren and that from these two, Ard and Naaman, there issued\nfrom each a large family, and the offspring of the other sons were called after Bela’s name,\nbut the offspring of these two were called after their name.

While obviously Rashi and the Ramban can argue, they both seem to be presenting it as a known fact not an opinion.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Q1:</strong> Your first question is a good one. I can suggest a couple of possible answers:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>אין מוקדם ומאוחר בתורה - It's possible that the story of Menashe's conquest of Gilad happened prior to the two tribes talking to Moshe.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This is another piece of evidence that Bnei Yisrael always intended to capture the Gilad - and didn't just happen to capture it because they ended up battling Og. This is a lead-off to an answer to your next question.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Q2:</strong> There are a number of sources that connect Bnei Machir to the land of Gilad. Both Rabbi Yehudah Hachassid and the Student of Rasag suggest that the conquests of Yair and Novach actually took place before the slavery in Egypt, at a time in which pharaoh allowed Bnei Yisrael to go to Canaan to create settlements there. Therefore, the reason that Bnei Menashe appear out of nowhere and Moshe never argues with them about settling in Gilad, unlike with Bnei Reuven and Bnei Gad is because it was always a given that they would re-settle the land of their fathers (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/61579/why-did-moses-add-part-of-the-tribe-of-menashe-to-join-reuven-and-gad-on-the-ea/110990#110990\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>As for your third question, I heard a suggestion a couple of years ago that Gilad was named after the land because the Yishma'elim that bought Yosef came from there (see previous link), but I don't have a source for that. However, it explains why when they created settlements, they settled in Gilad of all places. Yosef wanted to clean out the place from injustice.</p>\n<p>And as I commented, I disagree with your reading of Rashi and Ramban. I think usage of the phrases אולי and אומר אני indicate that these are, in fact, their own opinions.</p>\n\n\n",

I know that in your heart you feel some resentment against me. Know, however, that I buried her there by the command of God”. And the future proved that God had commanded him to do this in order that she might help her children when Nebuzaradan would take them into captivity. For when they were passing along that road Rachel came forth from her grave and stood by her tomb weeping and beseeching mercy for them, as it is said, (Jeremiah 31:15) “A voice is heard in Rama, [the sound of weeping … Rachel weeping for her children]”, and the Holy One, blessed be He, replied to her (v. 16) “There is a reward for thy work, says the Lord etc. (v. 17) for thy children will return to their own border”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Kinas for the Day of Tisha B'av Chapter 26, R' Elazar Haklir talks about the trip of Yirmiyahu to the Mearas Hamchpeila to awaken them to beseech G-D for mercy for their children. It is based on Medrash <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eichah_Rabbah%2C_Petichta.24\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eicha Rabbasi Introduction number 24</a>. Although the Medrash does not mention the Imahos, only the Avos and Moshe, in the Kinna he clearly includes them.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָז בַּהֲלוֹךְ יִרְמְיָהוּ עַל קִבְרֵי אָבוֹת וְנָם עֲצָמוֹת חֲבִיבוֹת\nמָה אַתֶּם שׁוֹכְבוֹת בְּנֵיכֶם גָּלוּ וּבָתֵּיהֶם חֲרֵבוֹת\nוְאַיֵּה זְכוּת אָבוֹת בְּאֶרֶץ תַּלְאוּבוֹת:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then further in the Kinna;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קוֹל בְּכִי לֵאָה מְתוֹפֶפֶת עַל לְבָבֶהָ\nרָחֵל אֲחוֹתָהּ מְבַכָּה עַל בָּנֶיהָ זִלְפָּה מַכָּה פָּנֶיהָ\nבִּלְהָה מְקוֹנֶנֶת בִּשְׁתֵּי יָדֶיהָ:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, even if Rachel had been buried in the Mearas Hamachpeila she would have heard about it through Yermiyahu. Why then did Yackov have to bury on the road so that the Children of Israel can stop by her kever and awaken her to beseech G-D? Even if she could not have been buried in the Mearas Hamachpeila because she gave a night to Leah, she could have been buried in the city and Yirmiyahu could of gone there to awaken her just like he did for Moshe Rabbeinu.</p>\n\n\n",

That's the answer to your first question. As for your second question, how is it that a wise man cries over the past?

In some passages the plural is used of God, e.g., \"Let us make man in our image\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.1.26?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 1:26</a>); \"Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.11.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 11:7</a>). Our Sages explain this in the following manner: God, as it were, does nothing without contemplating the host above. <strong>I wonder at the expression \"contemplating,\" which is the very expression used by Plato: God, as it were, \"contemplates the world of ideals, and thus produces the existing beings.\"</strong> In other passages our Sages expressed it more decidedly: \"God does nothing without consulting the host above\" (the word familia, used in the original, is a Greek noun, and signifies \"host\"). On the words, \"what they have already made\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.2.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eccles. 2:12</a>), the following remark is made in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.12.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit Rabba</a> and in Midrash Koheleth: \"It is not said 'what He has made,' but 'what they have made'; hence we infer that He, as it were, with His court, have agreed upon the form of each of the limbs of man before placing it in its position, as it is said, 'He hath made thee and established thee'\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.32.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 32:6</a>). In Bereshit Rabba (chap. li.) it is also stated, that wherever the term \"and the Lord\" occurred in Scripture, the Lord with His court is to be understood. These passages do not convey the idea that God spoke, thought, reflected, or that He consulted and employed the opinion of other beings, as ignorant persons have believed.

This is the truth, the real faith, and everything else may be abandoned. Perhaps this was Abraham's point of view when divine power and unity dawned upon him prior to the revelation accorded to him. As soon as this took place, he gave up all his speculations and only strove to gain favour of God, having ascertained what this was and how and where it could be obtained. The Sages explain the words: 'And he brought him forth abroad' (Genesis 15), thus: Give up thy horoscopy! This means: Forsake astrology as well as any other doubtful study of nature. <strong>Plato relates that a prophet, who lived at the time of the king Morinus, said prophetically to a philosopher who was zealously devoted to his art: Thou canst not reach me on this road, but only those whom I have placed as intermediaries between me and mankind, viz. the prophets and the true law.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rav Yosef Albo</strong> in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaIkkarim%2C_Maamar_1.8.3?vhe=Sefer_Ha-%27ikkarim&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer HaIkarrim</a> when exploring Divine law vs conventional law notes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויתבאר מזה שאי אפשר לשום מסדר נימוס אנושי שלא יטה בטבעו לצד איזה פחיתות, וישפוט על הנאה שהוא מגונה ועל המגונה שהוא נאה, ולזה לא יהיה עדותו על הנאה והמגונה אמת. <strong>הלא תראה כי אפלטון טעה בזה טעות גדולה ואמר על המגונה שהוא נאה, כי אמר שראוי שיהיו הנשים במדינה משותפות לבעלי ראשיות אחת, כאלו תאמר נשי השרים משותפות לכל השרים ונשי הסוחרים לכל הסוחרים, וכן נשי בני אומנות אחת משותפות לכל בני האומנות ההיא, וזה דבר הרחיקה אותו התורה, ואפילו תורת בני נח</strong>, שהרי נאמר לאבימלך הנך מת על האשה אשר לקחת והיא בעולת בעל, והוא התנצל בשלא ידע שהיתה אשת איש. וכבר גנה אריסטו דעת אפלטון בזה.</p>\n<p>It becomes clear now that it is impossible for any author of a human code not to show a natural deficiency in some direction, and regard the becoming as unbecoming and the unbecoming as becoming. His testimony concerning the becoming and the unbecoming will therefore not be true. <strong>Thus Plato made a grievous mistake, advocating the unbecoming as though it were becoming. For his idea is that all the women of a given class should be held in common by the men of that class. Thus, the wives of the rulers should be common to all the rulers, the wives of the merchants common to all the merchants, and similarly the wives of the men of a given trade or occupation should be common to the men of that trade or occupation. This is a matter which the Torah forbids; even the Noachian law prohibits it</strong>, for Abimelech was told, Behold, thou shalt die, because of the woman whom thou hast taken; for she is a man’s wife, and his excuse was that he did not know she had a husband. Aristotle, as is known, criticized Plato’s idea in this matter. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I am looking for any biblical or taanitic source that might indicate such an understanding. (looked at Bamidbar 35, Devarim 19, Yehoshua 20, Mishna, Tosefta, Midrash, Yerushalmi makos.) Although the Talmud's question above quotes ועליהם תתנו ארבעים ושתים עיר that pasuk does not show that those 42 have the same function-- the section is discussion the territory to be given to the Leveim. Answers that distinguish drash from pshat here should please explain a compelling reason to have the drash diverge in this way. I am more interested in precedent than the drasha itself as the Talmud takes it as a given rather than asking it as a contradiction between some other source that makes such a drasha, indicating that it was accepted and clear that the 42 serve as cities of refuge.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>According to Rabbi Prof. Yoel Elitzur in his <a href=\"https://daf-yomi.com/Data/UploadedFiles/DY_Item/40326-sFile.docx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">essay</a> on this question, the Bavli's understanding seems to come from the list of cities in Divrei Hayamim, where it says, for example (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.6.42?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1:6:42</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וְלִבְנֵי אַהֲרֹן נָתְנוּ אֶת <strong>עָרֵי הַמִּקְלָט</strong> אֶת חֶבְרוֹן וְאֶת לִבְנָה וְאֶת מִגְרָשֶׁיהָ וְאֶת יַתִּר וְאֶת אֶשְׁתְּמֹעַ וְאֶת מִגְרָשֶׁיהָ\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While in Yehoshua it says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Joshua.21.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yehoshua 21:13</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וְלִבְנֵי אַהֲרֹן הַכֹּהֵן נָתְנוּ אֶת <strong>עִיר מִקְלַט הָרֹצֵחַ</strong> אֶת חֶבְרוֹן וְאֶת מִגְרָשֶׁהָ וְאֶת לִבְנָה וְאֶת מִגְרָשֶׁהָ\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key difference being that in Yehoshua only the chosen six cities are referred to as a \"city of refuge\", while the phrase \"cities of refuge\" in Divrei Hayamim seems to refer also to the rest of the cities, and not only the original six.</p>\n<p>However, he also explains that this view was not widely-accepted, neither in the Bavli - the previous sugiya hinges on the understanding that there are only six cities - nor in the Yerushalmi (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Makkot.7b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 7b</a>), where they go to great lengths to explain that in the future there will be at most 15 cities of refuge.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>It seems perfectly reasonable to read the passuk as saying the 42 cities should serve the same function as the six cities mentioned in the beginning of the verse. The Torah went out of its way to mention that these six cities are for refuge specifically in this verse.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Numbers.35.14.1?lang=bi&with=Numbers&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a> does imply that this is not the only way to read the verse, as he writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואני תמה <strong>כי על דעת רז\"ל</strong> (מכות י) הכתוב שאמר (במדבר ל״ה:ו׳) ועליהם תתנו ארבעים ושתים עיר כולם למקלט צוה בהם</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which implies that this is not obvious from the verses, but something we learn from Chazal. However, it seems to me that this interpretation is consistent with Chazal always paying close attention to how things are grouped together in the parsha. If the Torah was just teaching us that the six cities are the same ones that protect, it should have mentioned that detail in the next parsha that describes Cities of Refuge. Since this detail is mentioned here next to the 42 cities, it seems that the Torah is making a היקש, just as these six protect, so do the next 42.</p>\n\n\n",

I want to know if there is a final psak on this machlokes, especially according to Rashi. Does Rashi ever say which way to pasken? Or are there examples of Rashi explaining a passuk only according to one opinion? Or does a reliable authority (esp. Mizrachi, Gur Aryeh, etc.) say which way Rashi held?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There are many instances in Shas where this term is brought up. Almost every instance is problematic because the same Tanna seems to hold in a different place the exact opposite. To start,  see Bsva Metzia 31a-b and Tosfos Bava Metzia 31b Dibra Torah. Tosfos there seems to say that it some places the pesukim must be Klashon Bnei Adam and in other places it's not. Not much elaboration.\nTosfos in Menachos 17b Mai Haochel, brings a huge list of places in Shas that are contradictory, and tries to offer the same answer. However, he asks from Bava Metzia 74b and Nedarim 3a where the Gemarah states \" according to the one who holds Dibra Torah\" that obviously there is a shita that holds that everywhere, and its not variable based on the passuk.\nFinally,  Tosfos in Sota 24a has a long list of contradictions, and offers a third answer. He says there is one shita of R' Akiva who says we never say Dibra Torah, there's another shita that says that if you can find something to darshan that's similar to what the passuk is taking about then you can darshan, but if you can only find something to darshan in a different subject then we say Dibra Torah. There's a third shita who says that even if you could darshan the repetition for a different subject you would also say it instead of Dibra Torah, however even this shita agrees that in some cases you say Dibra Torah.\nSo, in conclusion, it's clear from these Tosfos that nearly all Tannaim at some point agree that we can say Dibra Torah. That is indeed the halacha as we see from the Rambam Hilchos Martnas Aniyim 7:9 where he paskens like the shita that says your not mechuyav to give tzedaka to a rich person who doesn't want to use his own money. This shita is R' Shimon who says Dibrah Torah. However, in many other cases (i.e. giving tochocha 100 times)  we don't say Dibra Torah L'halacha. So it depends on each case and each passuk, and there's no over arching rule for all cases.</p>\n<p>Additionally, specifically to Rashi and the Mizrachi, see the Mizrachi in Lech Lecha 12:1 where he points out that even though in some cases we say Dibra Torah, we still say in other cases that we can darshan the extra word even though it may not necessarily be extra because the Torah does sometimes say Dibra Torah. With this he explains Rashi in Parshas Lech Lecha who seems to be darshaning the extra word.</p>\n\n\n",

(in fact it is interesting that at the end of that piece the Malbim explains that the current exile will also represent the same 42 wanderings)</p>\n<p>The Radak in King II 2:24;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואמרו בשביל ארבעים ושתים קרבנות שהקריב בלק מלך מואב הובקעו מישראל ארבעים ושנים ילדים:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Which means that the 42 children were killed in lieu of the 42 sacrifices brought by Balak.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>\"the world was graven with forty-two letters, all of which are the ornamentation of the Holy Name.\" (Zohar I, 30a)</p>\n<p>Maybe since it is part of creation, it is used significantly. And thats why the Baal Shem Tov compares the 42 journeys of the Bnei Yisroel to the 42 letter name, and also says that these are 42 stages which each and everyone of us encounter in our lives, as it is really rooted into our formation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It would seem that the number 42 has a deeper Divine underpinning which makes it foundational to the Jewish people.</p>\n<p>Similar to what has already been pointed out about the 42 stops of the Bnei Yisrael, it is worth noting the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.428.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham 428:8</a> who writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כתוב בצרור המור מ\"ב מסעות שבפרשת ואלה מסעי אין להפסיק בהם שהוא נגד שם מ\"ב</p>\n<p>The Tzror Hamor writes that the 42 journeys that are enumerated in Massei, we don't make a break (in their recitation) as they correspond to the 42 letter name of G-d.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tzror Hamor explanation on Massei <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tzror_HaMor_on_Torah%2C_Numbers.33.1.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> is deeply Kabbalistic and I don't understand it all. He starts by saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולהורות שיש באלו המסעות דבר גדול. אמרו רבותינו ז\"ל שנכתבו כאן שנים וארבעים מסעות. רמז לשם המפורש של שנים וארבעים</p>\n<p>To teach that in these journeys there is a great thing. Our Rabbis of blessed memory write here that there were 42 journeys. <strong>This is a hint to the (42-letter) name of G-d which correlate with the 42 (journeys)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then goes on to point out how this 42 can be seen to have its link with the creation of the world, how there are 7 words each with 6 letters which equate (7 x 6) to 42.</p>\n<p>And thus:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכמו שהתורה התחילה בימי בראשית שבם רמוז שם ה' ב\"ם. כן סיימה בפרשת אלה מסעי בספור שנים וארבעים מסעות שהם כנגד שם של שנים וארבעים שהזכרנו. <strong>לרמוז שהתורה כולה כלולה וקשורה וחתומה בחותם אחד. בסוד ה' אחד ובסוד ה' בם. ואין בה פירוד וחילוק אלא שהיא קשורה תחלתה בסופה וסופה בתחלתה. ולכן כתב באלו המסעות ויכתוב משה את מוצאיהם למסעיהם ע\"פ השם</strong></p>\n<p>And like the Torah begins with the days of creation that alludes to the 42-letter (ב\"ם) name of Hashem, so too it concludes in Parshas Massei with counting 42 journeys corresponding to the 42-letter name like we mentioned. <strong>To hint that the whole Torah is included and bound and signed in one seal. In the secret of the one G-d, and in the secret of Hashem (ב\"ם) in it / 42. And there is no separation and division in it but it is connected with its beginning at the end and its end with its beginning. Therefore it writes about these journeys, \"And Moshe recorded the starting points of their journeys\" through Hashem i.e. through His 42-letter name.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the number 42 has its roots in the Divine and that is why halachically we don't make any breaks when reading about the 42 journeys and could possibly be why the number 42 pops up in various places throughout Tanach as it involves some form of Divine intervention.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>When viewing this in light of the other instances where 42 is mentioned in Tanach it is clear to see similarly, some form of Divine input.</p>\n<p>We know as has already been mentioned in some other answers, that Balak offered up 42 sacrifices (14 offerings x 3 different locations = 42). Whilst famously, the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.105b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 105b</a> notes that as a result he merited that Rus / Ruth descended from him. There is also a noteworthy Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.47a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 47a</a> which writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבי חנינא בשביל ארבעים ושנים קרבנות שהקריב בלק מלך מואב הובקעו מישראל ארבעים ושנים ילדים</p>\n<p>Rabbi Chanina said: due to the 42 offerings that Balak, king of Moav brought, 42 children were broken off from Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the 42 offerings that Balak brought, impacted on another 42, this time the 42 boys that were killed by the bears (that you also reference in your question).</p>\n<p>So the question is, what was this connection, and how does the number 42 have any bearings (excuse the pun!).</p>\n<p>Interestingly when doing some searching on Sefaria, I stumbled on the Zohar which also links these two incidents but sheds some more light. In the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Zohar.2.224a.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Zohar 2:224a</a> it writes that Rabbi Shimon comments that these 42 sacrifices directed a \"סִטְרָא אַחֲרָא לְגַבֵּי קוּדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא\" - lit. \"an other side towards Hashem\" (the סִטְרָא אַחֲרָא is normally understood Kabbalistically as the side of impurity or in layman term the 'realm of evil' etc.) and this \"other side\" was called \"curse\". I believe what the Zohar goes on to say, is that the actions of Balak, whilst weren't of righteous nature created some sort of Divine 'debt' that had to be repaid which came in the form of these 42 children that were killed.</p>\n<p>Indeed the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.47a.2?lang=bi&p2=Ben_Yehoyada_on_Sotah.47a.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ben Yehoyada</a> on the Gemara in Sotah concludes that this 'curse' is hinted to in the incident of the bears. He writes that the verse in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.2.24?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Kings 2:24</a> the word for \"bears\" - \"דֻּבִּים֙\" is missing the \"ו\" which hints to \"יד ב\"ם\" - \"the hand of Bam\" (i.e. the 42 letter name).</p>\n<p>So once again we see in another two instances that the number 42 connects in some way to the revered 42-letter name of Hashem and has a far-reaching Divine impact.</p>\n\n\n",

However stories of other Tzaddikim and Gedolei Yisrael seemingly may be read in a bathroom.<sup>2</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<blockquote>\n<p><sup>1</sup>Piskeiy Teshuvos 85/3; Vayivarech David 15</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> ibid; To note that the sons of the Alter Rebbe read him stories of Tzaddikim while he was receiving medical treatment in the bathtub, seemingly in order to prevent him from thinking words of Torah. However when they came to talk of the Tzaddik Rav Shmelka of Nikulsberg Admur stated that of such a holy Tzaddik they cannot talk about in a bathroom. [Shmuoes Usipurim Vol. 1 p. 241]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If the content of the book contains Torah or shiurim of the said Gadol. Rav Moshe Shternbach shlita in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20026&st=&pgnum=395&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Teshuvos V'hanhagos, cheilek beis, siman 466</a> brings a case that is perhaps transferable, namely the topic of frum newspapers that contain divrei Torah and whether one can enter into the bathroom with them.</p>\n<p>It writes <a href=\"https://www.yeshiva.co/ask/7842\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When there is a newspaper which mentions, by the way, these Torah like ideas, where it is clear that one's intent is to read the story, and not to learn the words of Torah, it is permitted to take them into the bathroom. If though the name of G-d is written out fully, then it is forbidden.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However it is worth noting that he states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולכן לע\"ד יש יסוד למקילין להכניס עתונים לבית הכסא, אכן להכניס לשם מאמר מיוחד לדברי תורה זהו בזיא מלתא ואסור מעיקר הדין אלא יקרענו מהעתון ולא יכנס עמו</p>\n<p>And therefore according to my humble opinion, there is a basis to be lenient to enter into the bathroom with such newspapers. <strong>However, if there is a special article that contains divrei Torah then it is disgrace (to enter it into the bathroom) and it is forbidden from the fundamental din (law) and rather one should tear it out from the newspaper and not bring it (into the bathroom) with him</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from Rav Shternbach shlita that one could bring in the book if it only has Torah-like expressions but one should avoid bringing it in if it contains divrei Torah and the like.</p>\n\n\n",

Perhaps you can add to your question to make it clearer what you mean.</p>\n<p>However as far as understanding the use of the letter \"ב\" it is worth noting the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Exodus.20.13.4&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a> who writes the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא תענה. שנים רבות חפשתי בלבי טעם זאת המלה לאמר עד שקר ולא אמר עדות שקר. <strong>ולפי דעתי עתה כי הוא מדבר עם עד שקר</strong>. כאילו כתב לא תענה אם אתה עד שקר ומשמע זאת המלה כטעם לא תכחשו ולא תשקרו. ומצאנו מלת ענות בבי\"ת. כמו שקר ענה באחיו. ובלא בי\"ת כמו ישמע אל ויענם. והטעם יענה בם. וכמוהו וכאשר לא נגענוך. לא נגענו בך. ויש עד שקר שהוא בן מות. והוא שכתוב עליו ועשיתם לו כאשר זמם לעשות לאחיו:</p>\n<p>THOU SHALT NOT BEAR FALSE WITNESS. For many years I asked myself why Scripture employs the phrase ed sheker (false witness) and not edut sheker (false testimony). I now believe that Scripture is addressing the false witness, <strong>and our verse is to be interpreted as if it read, “Thou shalt not give testimony if thou art a false witness.”</strong> The implication of this clause is the same as that of neither shall ye deal falsely, nor lie one to another (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.19.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev. 19:11</a>). We find that a bet follows the word for testimony in and hath testified (anah) falsely against his brother (be-achiv) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.19.18?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 19:18</a>). We also find this verb employed without a bet following it in yishma El ve-ya’anem (God shall hear, and testify against them) (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.55.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ps. 55:20</a>). Now ve-ya’anem is a compound of ve-ya’aneh (and shall testify) and bam (against them).273 The phrase lo nega’anukha (not touched thee) in as we have not touched thee (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.26.29?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 26:29</a>) is similar, as the meaning of lo nega’anukha is lo naganu bakh (we have not touched thee). There is a type of false witness who incurs the death penalty, namely, the one concerning whom it is written, then shall ye do unto him, as he had purposed to do unto his brother (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.19.19?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deut. 19:19</a>). (sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The relative openness of the command which I think you are finding difficult to understand as far as which we to read the injunction is addressed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.20.13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Shemot.20.13.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachya</a> who notes that the ambiguous wording is designed to maintain a universal application of the <strong>negative</strong> impact of being a false witness. As he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לא תענה ברעך. לא אמר באחיך כמשפט הכתובים (דברים כ״ג:כ׳) לא תשיך לאחיך, (שם כב) לכל אבדת אחיך, וכיוצא בזה, כי שם אנו דורשים אחיך ולא עכו\"ם וכאן הזהיר אפילו על העכו\"ם כי כן מצינו (שמות י״א:ב׳) וישאלו איש מאת רעהו והוא נאמר על המצריים, ועוד שאלו אמר באחיך היה נראה שהעדות כשרה בקרובים כי לא יזהירנו אלא מעדות שקר אבל עדות של אמת כשר ואין הדבר כן כי כל עדות פסולה בקרובים הן שיהיה שקר הן שיהיה אמת הן יהיה לתועלתו או להפסדו. והיה הכתוב ראוי לומר לא תענה ברעך עדות שקר, ואלו אמר כן לא היתה האזהרה כי אם למעיד עצמו שלא יעיד הוא עצמו עדות שקר, <strong>אבל כשאמר עד שקר יתבאר מזה שהוא אזהרה שלא יהיה נסכם להזמין עד שקר</strong>, וזהו לשון לא תענה לא תסייע ולא תזמין ברעך עד שקר שיעיד עליו.</p>\n<p>לא תענה ברעך עד שקר, “do not bear false witness against your fellow.” Please note that the Torah does not write “against your brother,” as it does when forbidding charging interest, (Deut. 23,20) or when it commands you to return found property (Deut. 22,3), or in similar legislation. In all those instances our sages explain the word אחיך as excluding non-Jews. In other words, while it is forbidden to charge (or pay) interest to a Jew, it is not forbidden to charge interest to a Gentile. While one must go out of one’s way to restore lost property owned by a Jew, there is no legal obligation to spend time, energy, and even money to restore lost property to a Gentile. Here the reason the Torah fails to limit the legislation to אחיך, “your brother.” It is clear that one must not bear false testimony against a Gentile, i.e. against Egyptians. Moreover, we find in Exodus 11,20 וישאלו איש מאת רעהו, “they asked each person from his fellow;” it is clear that the word רעהו refers to the Egyptians as the verse would not make any sense otherwise. Not bearing false testimony therefore is a commandment of universal application. Furthermore, if the Torah had written the word אחיך in our verse we might have concluded that it is in order to testify against (or on behalf of) other relatives, whereas generally speaking a whole list of relatives are unfit to testify together (as a team), on behalf of each other or against each other. Not only is false testimony illegal in such instances but even true testimony is unacceptable. Were this not so the Torah should have written לא תענה ברעך עדות שקר, “do not lie in your testimony against your fellow.” Such wording would have been very misleading as it would have meant that only the actual false testimony is prohibited but that someone who is in collusion with people arranging false testimony would be exonerated by the legal process. <strong>The Torah therefore uses ambiguous wording to cover as much ground as possible, i.e. in order to include as many people as possible in the parameters of guilt governing the subject of false testimony.</strong> The very word תענה means to “assist,” or “invite.” (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

We describe Him by the qualities given to His creations, so that the ear may hear what it is able to comprehend.

Rather, God created a miraculous sound, and this spoke to the prophets. Rambam takes it a step further and says that “spoke” means “thought” or “willed.” G-d has no vocal cords. G-d did not speak during creation (Genesis 1). G-d “willed” the creation (Guide, 1:65). Thus, G-d never spoke to anyone. Prophecy is not a miraculous communication. Prophecy is a natural event.</p>\n\n\n",

Here is the מהרש\"א Yoma 19B in חידושי אגדות</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רגל עגל כו'. כתב הריטב\"א הקשו התוס' דהא כתיב וכל אדם לא יהיה באוהל מועד וגו' ודרשינן אפי' אותם שנאמר עליהם ודמות פניהם פני אדם ותירצו דשאני הכא שלא נעשה הקטורת כמצותה עכ\"ל והוא דחוק אבל הנראה דלא קאמר דבכניסתו לקדשי קדשים ניגף מה\"ט שלא היה רשות שם למלאך ליכנס שם לנוגפו אבל דקדק לומר דביציאתו מבית ק\"ק ובא להיכל שם ניגף ע\"י מלאך שאז היה רשות למלאך לבא לאהל מועד כדכתיב עד צאתו וז\"ש כששמעו אחיו הכהנים בעזרה קול יוצא מהיכל נכנסו להיכל במקום שהותרו ליכנס ומצאו כף רגל כו' ותו לא מידי ובירושלמי מצאתי כמ\"ש התוס':</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, the יכין in יומא 5:1:22 seems to hold that it could only be in the היכל while the תיו\"ט holds it could be in the ק\"ק.</p>\n<p>Another good source on this subject is found in the discussion about whether the common held assumption that the כ\"ג had a string on his foot is accurate or not. See this article for a very interesting read on the subject</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/5694/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://outorah.org/p/5694/</a></p>\n<p>The article addresses the issue of משא and the כהנים getting טמא.</p>\n<p>On the issue of the כלים getting טמא, the גמ' חגיגה says (26B) that there were replacements for everything handy;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כׇּל הַכֵּלִים שֶׁהָיוּ בַּמִּקְדָּשׁ יֵשׁ לָהֶם שְׁנִיִּים וּשְׁלִישִׁים שֶׁאִם נִטְמְאוּ הָרִאשׁוֹנִים יָבִיאוּ שְׁנִיִּים תַּחְתֵּיהֶן כׇּל הַכֵּלִים שֶׁהָיוּ בַּמִּקְדָּשׁ טְעוּנִין טְבִילָה חוּץ מִמִּזְבַּח הַזָּהָב וּמִזְבַּח הַנְּחֹשֶׁת מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהֵן כַּקַּרְקַע דִּבְרֵי רַבִּי אֱלִיעֶזֶר וַחֲכָמִים אוֹמְרִים מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהֵן מְצוּפִּין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The mishna continues: All the vessels that were in the Temple had second and third substitute vessels, so that if the first ones became impure they could bring the second ones in their place. All the vessels that were in the Temple required immersion after the Festival, apart from the golden altar and the bronze altar, because they are considered like the ground and therefore, like land itself, not susceptible to impurity. This is the statement of Rabbi Eliezer. And the Rabbis say: It is because they are coated.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In conclusion, while it definitely would be somewhat of a delay and require some extra work, it does not seem out of the realm of possibility, with most issues already covered in other areas of ש\"ס.</p>\n\n\n",

The technique I am using is surprisingly effective.</p>\n<p>This came as a result of my feeling nostalgic for the days when the Oral Torah was truly oral. This makes me curious about the actual process of transmitting the  mishna to students. My dilemma is this: in order to memorize the mishna you'd need to have someone who already has the text memorized teach it to you mishna by mishna. And not only this but you need to hear from the mouth of this teacher for a considerable number of years before you actually receive the entire six orders. You need to be a devoted student of a teacher for many, many years to get the whole text.</p>\n<p>Presumably then, the text would have to be reviewed constantly in order to keep it in memory, and moreover because not all students come at the same time, different sections would need to be taught concurrently.</p>\n<p>Thus I'm wondering how widespread actually were those who actually had the entire six tractates memorized. I am aware that each academy had those specifically designated for memorizing the mishna. But the memorization had to extend beyond these people only for the fact that the mishna's rulings would otherwise not have been retained by the nation at large.</p>\n<p>Does anyone have an idea about what it literally took to get this body of knowledge down the generations, in more than the vague \"Moshe kibel torah misinai, umesorah leyehoshua, etc.\"\nAnd then the early mishnayot which came from Moshe himself were probably much more numerous than the reduced form we have today (I once heard Rebi Hakadosh had 900 orders of mishna he reduced to six)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The Mishna (<a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%A0%D7%94_%D7%90%D7%91%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94_%D7%9B%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avos 5:21</a>) says in the name of Yehuda Ben Teima, sets out a study program for Jewish males:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בֶּן חָמֵשׁ שָׁנִים לַמִּקְרָא</p>\n<p><strong>בֶּן עֶשֶׂר לַמִּשְׁנָה</strong></p>\n<p>בֶּן שְׁלֹשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה לַמִּצְווֹת</p>\n<p><strong>בֶּן חֲמֵשׁ עֶשְׂרֵה לַתַּלְמוּד</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>From the age of five, the study of Mikra (the Hebrew Bible).  From age ten, the study of Mishna. At thirteen, he becomes Bar Mitzvah, and from the age of 15, he begins the study of Talmud.</p>\n<p>The presumption is that he has completed a basic knowledge the Mishna by the age of fifteen, and now begins \"Talmud\", which is an in depth analysis and discussion of the Mishna.</p>\n<p>The great academies were for schools of higher education, where the Mishna was expounded upon, and which we refer to as Talmud.

They didn't have phones, social media, and commercial sports events, which fill up people's time today. So the average preteen and young teenager, that wanted to master the Mishna, would theoretically have access to teachers, who would help him achieve his goal of completing the study of the Mishna by the age of 15.</p>\n<p>Note: Even in today’s day and age, there are many boys that complete the study of all six orders of Mishna, in honor of their Bar Mitzvah, at age 13. Granted that today they don't study it by heart, nevertheless, it's not far-fetched to imagine, that in the olden days, a boy devoting themselves full time to the project, could learn the Mishna by heart, in 5 years (from age 10-15).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From the Gemarah it seems that this was a significant issue and fear.</p>\n<p>Kesubos 103b;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיינו דכי הוו מינצו ר' חנינא ור' חייא א\"ל ר' חנינא לר' חייא בהדי דידי מינצת דאם חס ושלום נשתכחה תורה מישראל מהדרנא ליה מפלפולי</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And this is the background to an exchange that took place when Rabbi Ḥanina and Rabbi Ḥiyya argued.

This collection eventually came to be called \"Midrash Rabbot\" (i.e., \"Midrash of the Rabbot\"), to which the midrashim most in use in connection with prayers—to Shir HaShirim, Ruth, Esther, Lamentations, and Ecclesiastes—were subsequently added.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Still more inexact and misleading is the term \"Midrash Rabbah to the Five Books of the Pentateuch and the Five Megillot,\" as found on the title-page of the two parts in the much-used Vilna edition. After Zunz, it is not necessary to point out that the Midrash Rabbah consists of 10 entirely different midrashim.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, despite the name, Shemot Rabba and Vayikra Rabba are separate midrashim, by different authors. Shemot Rabba is fairly late, post-Rashi. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemot_Rabbah?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a 1200 CE authorship date.)

Therefore, they called this day notzri, because it was the day celebrated by Nebuchadnezzar because the Sun presided over it; this is reasonable and clear\".</em></p>\n<p>(Beit ha-Bechirah on Avodah Zarah 2a)</p>\n<p>Unless I'm mistaken, in the rabbinic literature the term “notzrim” always means “christians\", from “Yeshu ha Notzri” (Jesus the Nazarene).</p>\n<p>I would therefore like to know:</p>\n<p>-Whether the term \"notzrim\" used in Jeremiah 4:16 is entirely identical, on the linguistic level, to what we find in the aforementioned Talmudic passages;</p>\n<p>-Whether this interpretation of Rav ha Meiri is also endorsed by other masters of the Jewish tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

However, that question/answer seems to me to be referring to set order of tefillah I.e, shacharit, mincha, maariv.</p>\n<p>My question is solely about quick prayers outside of set tefillah. A quick sentence for a personal request? Does the answer given to the linked question apply, or is that only for set tefillah?

He actually discusses how you should have a set time to be doing this every day.

That is, to set aside for oneself at least an hour or more for secluding oneself in some room or a field, and, using claims and excuses, speak one’s piece with one’s Maker; using words that evoke favor, placate and conciliate in order to entreat and plead with God that He bring one closer to Him—to genuine Divine worship.\nThis prayer and conversation should be in the language one normally uses, one’s native tongue, because it is difficult for a person to say everything he wants to say in the Holy Tongue. Also, being unfamiliar with that language, one’s heart is not moved by the words, as we are not accustomed to speaking Hebrew. But in our native tongue, in which we normally speak and converse, it is much easier and so more likely for one to feel contrition. This is because the heart is drawn to a person’s native tongue and closer to it, on account of his familiarity with it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sichot_HaRan.233.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sichos haRan 233</a> (translation by R' Aryeh Kaplan):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁמַעְתִּי מֵאִישׁ אֶחָד מֵאֲנָשָׁיו שֶׁפַּעַם אַחַת דִּבֵּר רַבֵּנוּ זִכְרוֹנוֹ לִבְרָכָה, עִמּוֹ מֵעִנְיַן בְּגָדִים וְאָמַר לוֹ שֶׁעַל כָּל דָּבָר צְרִיכִין לְהִתְפַּלֵּל הַיְנוּ אִם בִּגְדּוֹ קָרוּעַ וְצָרִיךְ לְבֶגֶד יִתְפַּלֵּל לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ שֶׁיִּתֵּן לוֹ בֶּגֶד לִלְבּשׁ וְכֵן בְּכָל כַּיּוֹצֵא בָּזֶה דָּבָר גָּדוֹל וְדָבָר קָטָן עַל הַכּל יַרְגִּיל עַצְמוֹ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל תָּמִיד לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ עַל כָּל מַה שֶּׁיֶּחְסַר לוֹ אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהָעִקָּר לְהִתְפַּלֵּל עַל הָעִקָּר דְּהַיְנוּ עַל עֲבוֹדַת הַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ לִזְכּוֹת לְהִתְקָרֵב אֵלָיו יִתְבָּרַךְ אַף עַל פִּי כֵן גַּם עַל זֶה צְרִיכִין לְהִתְפַּלֵּל וְאָמַר: שֶׁמִּי שֶׁאֵינוֹ מִתְנַהֵג כָּךְ אַף עַל פִּי שֶׁהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ נוֹתֵן לוֹ בְּגָדִים וּפַרְנָסָה וְהִצְטָרְכוּת חִיּוּתוֹ אֲבָל כָּל חִיּוּתוֹ הוּא כְּמוֹ בְּהֵמָה שֶׁגַּם כֵּן הַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ נוֹתֵן לָהּ לַחְמָהּ וְכוּ כֵּן הוּא חִיּוּתוֹ שֶׁנּוֹתֵן לוֹ הַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ כִּי מֵאַחַר שֶׁאֵינוֹ מַמְשִׁיךְ כָּל חִיּוּתוֹ עַל יְדֵי תְּפִלָּה מֵהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ עַל כֵּן כָּל חִיּוּתוֹ הוּא כְּמוֹ חִיּוּת בְּהֵמָה מַמָּשׁ כִּי הָאָדָם צָרִיךְ לְהַמְשִׁיךְ כָּל חִיּוּתוֹ וְהִצְטָרְכוּתוֹ מֵהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ עַל יְדֵי תְּפִלָּה וְתַחֲנוּנִים דַּוְקָא וְכֵן שָׁמַעְתִּי אָנכִי גַּם כֵּן מִפִּיו הַקָּדוֹשׁ עַל דָּבָר קָטָן וּפָחוּת מְאד שֶׁהָיָה קְצָת מֻכְרָח לִי וְאָמַר: תִּתְפַּלֵּל עַל זֶה לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ וְעָמַדְתִּי מִשְׁתּוֹמֵם כִּי הָיָה לִי לִדְבַר פֶּלֶא בְּעֵינַי לְהִתְפַּלֵּל לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ עַל דָּבָר פָּחוּת כָּזֶה וְגַם כִּי לא הָיָה מֻכְרָח בְּיוֹתֵר עָנָה וְאָמַר [בִּלְשׁוֹן תֵּמַהּ]. אֵין זֶה כְּבוֹדְךָ שֶׁתִּתְפַּלֵּל לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ עַל דָּבָר קָטָן כָּזֶה ? ! וְאַחַר כָּךְ סִפֵּר מַעֲשֶׂה קְטַנָּה מֵעִנְיַן בִּטָּחוֹן אֲפִלּוּ עַל דְּבָרִים קְטַנִּים מֵאִישׁ אֶחָד מִמֶּזְבּוּז וְהַכְּלָל שֶׁעַל כָּל הַדְּבָרִים שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם צְרִיכִין לְהִתְפַּלֵּל לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ וְכֵן מְבאָר בָּאָלֶף בֵּית עַיֵּן שָׁם</p>\n<p>The Rebbe once spoke to one of his disciples about clothing. He said, \"You must pray for everything. If your garment is torn and must be replaced, pray to God for a new one. Do this for everything. Make it a habit to pray for all your needs, large and small. Your main prayers should be for fundamentals - that God help you in your devotion, that you be worthy of coming close to Him. Still, you should also pray even for these other things. God may give you food and clothing and everything else you need even though you do not ask for them. But then you are like an animal. God gives every living thing its bread (Psalms 147:9) without being asked. He can certainly give it to you that way. But if you do not draw your life through prayer, it is like that of a beast. A man must draw all necessities of life from God through prayer alone.\"</p>\n<p>I once had a slight need for some insignificant thing. When I mentioned it to the Rebbe, he said, \"Pray to God for it.\" I was quite astonished to learn that one must pray to God even for such trivial things, especially in a case like this where it was not even a necessity. Seeing my surprise, the Rebbe asked me, \" Is it beneath your dignity to pray to God for a minor thing like this?\"</p>\n<p>He then told me a short story along similar lines, involving a man from Medzeboz. The main lesson is that you must pray for every single thing. This is also explained in <em>Sefer HaMidot (The Aleph-Bet Book, Prayer A37).</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Etzot,_Prayer.25\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Eitzos Tefillah 25</a> (translation my own):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>. צָרִיךְ לְהַרְגִּיל אֶת עַצְמוֹ לְהִתְפַּלֵּל עַל כָּל מַה שֶּׁחָסֵר לוֹ בְּכָל עֵת, הֵן פַּרְנָסָה אוֹ בָּנִים אוֹ כְּשֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ חוֹלֶה חַ\"ו בְּבֵיתוֹ וְצָרִיךְ רְפוּאָה וְכוּ', עַל כֻּלָּם יִהְיֶה עִקַּר עֲצָתוֹ רַק לְהִתְפַּלֵּל לְהַשֵּׁם יִתְבָּרַךְ. וְיַאֲמִין בַּה' שֶׁהַקָּדוֹשׁ־בָּרוּךְ־הוּא טוֹב לַכֹּל, הֵן לִרְפוּאָה הֵן לְפַרְנָסָה הֵן לְכָל הַדְּבָרִים. וְיִהְיֶה עִקַּר הִשְׁתַּדְּלוּתוֹ בָּתַר קֻדְשָׁא בְּרִיךְ הוּא, וְלֹא יִרְדֹּף אַחַר תַּחְבּוּלוֹת רַבּוֹת, כִּי רֻבָּם אֵינָם מוֹעִילִין כְּלוּם, וּמְעַט דִּמְעַט הַמּוֹעִילִין אֵינוֹ יוֹדֵעַ מֵהֶם וְאֵינוֹ יָכוֹל לְמֹצְאָם. אֲבָל לִקְרֹא לְהַקָּדוֹשׁ־בָּרוּךְ־הוּא זֶה טוֹב וּמוֹעִיל לְכָל דָּבָר שֶׁבָּעוֹלָם, וְזֶה יָכוֹל לִמְצֹא תָּמִיד, כִּי הוּא יִתְבָּרַךְ בַּנִּמְצָא תָּמִיד: (שם אות י\"א)</p>\n<p>A person must accustom himself to pray for all that he lacks at all times, be it sustenance, or children, or there is a sick person chas v'shalom in his household who needs a recovery. On everything the main recommendation is to pray to God and to believe that God is good to all. As it says, \"God is good to all\" (Psalms 145:9), that is, for all things, whether recovery, sustenance, or anything, when one believes so, certainly his main effort is [to pursue after] God and not to run after all various machinations, because most of those will amount to nothing. And a small minority of things that help are known and one is not able to find them. But to call out to God is good and it helps for all things in the world. And this can always be found, because God can always be found.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

If this is not available, then\nhe is to ask a gentile to cut the branches.</p>\n<p><strong>It is permitted to prune branches off a fruit tree for the purpose of\nbenefiting the health of the tree</strong>, so it grows healthy fruit, in\naccordance with the directives of a professional gardener. <strong>However, it\nis forbidden to prune the branches simply for beauty purposes, to\nbeautify the tree</strong>.

From the Talmud and poskim it emerges that there are several exemptions to this restriction.</p>\n<p>The prohibition does not apply in any of the following situations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>(a) the tree is old and no longer produces a kav of fruit (volume of 24 eggs)</li>\n<li>(b) the tree would be more valuable for its wood than as a fruit bearing tree</li>\n<li>(c) the tree is causing damage</li>\n<li>(d) the removal of the tree will allow for expansion of extremely cramped living space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nevertheless, Rav Yaakov Emden (1697-1776) in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1408&st=&pgnum=101&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">She’eilas Yaavetz 1:76</a> takes the dramatic position that, while there is no Biblical prohibition to remove the tree in the above situations, it is nonetheless a sakana (danger) to do so. Rav Yaakov Emden’s position has been intensely debated for the past three centuries (See Yabia Omer, YD 5:12, for sources).</p>\n<p>Because there is a concern of sakana, many poskim recommend transferring ownership of the tree to a non-Jew, and then having a non-Jew remove the tree.

Had the Torah only written the word כל, I would have concluded that all kind of meat is permissible for human consumption (including that of creeping things, etc. as argued by the Gentile interpreters of the Bible). The mention of the words כירק עשב, “like the green herbs,” limits the type of meat permitted for consumption by human beings. Just as not all herbs are intended for human consumption so not all meat is intended for human consumption. Poisonous herbs and certain (most) mushrooms are certainly not fit for consumption by humans. Similarly, there are categories of meat which are harmful to human beings. The Torah permitted only the kind of meat which is beneficial for man. The plain meaning of the verse is certainly not that it permits indiscriminate consumption of all manner of meat.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>There are the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noahidism\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Noahide Laws</a> that applied to all of humanity, post-Flood.

    "content": "# Why does the Torah give so much detail in the War on Midyan?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Moshe Rabbeinu and Israel fought a number of wars. Maybe starting with Egypt at the Yam Suf, but certainly against Amalek, Melech Arad, Sichon, and Og. Only by Midyan, apparently the last war chronologically, do we hear: The size and makeup of the army sent against them. A fuss about which prisoners were spared. The quantity and division of the spoils, in very great detail. There are further details on a tax imposed. Also there was a special gift by the leaders of the army. And the basis for our laws of hagalas keilim and t'vilas keilim are stated there. Did some or all of these apply in earlier wars? We know spoils were taken from Sichon and Og at least, see Parshas Devarim 2:35, 3:7; presumably some of those were pots as well.\nWhy is this war described in so much detail?<br />\nUpdate: Given some of the comments, I think I should take hagalas keilim off the list.

Rabbi Elazar, Rabbi Aba, Rabbi Chiya, Rabbi Yosi and the rest of the friends were present. They said that it is written: \"Do not harass Moab, nor contend with them in battle...\" (Devarim 2:9). That was for the sake of Ruth and Naamah, who were destined to come from their midst. AND IF SO, Tziporah, the wife of Moses who came from Midian, and Jethro and his offspring, who came out of Midian, who were all truly just, most certainly SHOULD HAVE PROTECTED MIDIAN. Furthermore, Moses grew up in Midian and still, the Holy One, blessed be He, told him, \"Execute the vengeance of the children of Yisrael on the Midianites\" (Bemidbar 31:2), YET MOSES' MERIT DID NOT PROTECT THEM. Therefore, there is an inappropriate bias in this matter, since Midian appeared worthier to be saved than Moab.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rabbi Shimon said, There is no comparison to the one who is going to gather the figs to the one who already gathered them, SINCE RUTH AND NAAMAH HAD NOT YET EMERGED FROM AMON AND MOAB, WHICH IS NOT THE CASE WITH TZIPORAH, WHO HAD ALREADY EMERGED FROM MIDIAN. Rabbi Elazar said to him, Although they already gathered THE FIGS, it is still a merit AND THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IN THEIR MERIT. He said to him, Like whoever has not collected the figs yet constantly guards that fig tree, so that it should not get any harm for the sake of the figs that are still to grow in the future. He abandons the tree and does not watch it after collecting the figs.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>So with Moab, that was to produce in the future these figs, RUTH, AND HER OFFSPRING, the Holy One, blessed be He, guarded them, as it says, \"Do not harass Moab.\" <strong>Midian had already produced the figs and they were collected, as it is written: \"Vex the Midianites\" (Bemidbar 25:17), since from here on, this fig tree will no longer produce fruit. Therefore, it deserves to be burned by fire. He opened the discussion saying, \"And Moab said to the elders of Midian...\" (Bemidbar 22:4). Moabites are the ones who started TO DISTRESS YISRAEL.</strong> For the sake of the figs, RUTH AND HER OFFSPRING, that Moab is destined to produce in the future, they were saved from punishment.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>...</p>\n<ol start=\"93\">\n<li><p>He [the toddler, \"Yanuka,\" child of R' Hamnuna Saba] opened by saying, \"And Moab said to the elders of Midian\" (Bemidbar 22:4). HE ASKS: It does not say, 'The elders of Moab said to the elders of Midian', but \"Moab said.\" That means that the young OF MOAB took counsel of the elders OF MIDIAN, and the older ones followed after THE WISHES OF THE YOUNGER ONES and gave them advice. What was the advice with which they counseled them? They took for themselves bad advice. The ELDERS OF MIDIAN said to Moab, We have grown a bad crop among us. And who is it? It is their master, Moses. There was among us a priest who took care of him and supported him in his house and gave him his daughter for a wife. Furthermore, he gave him money and sent him to Egypt to destroy the whole country. And he, THE PRIEST, and his entire household got carried away after him. If we could root out from the world that master of theirs, all his people would be uprooted from the world. <strong>The entire disastrous advice in the matters of Pe'or stemmed from Midian.</strong></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Come and see that everything stemmed from Midian; the thrust of their counsel was about Moses, and with the advice of Midian they hired Bilaam. When they realized that Bilaam was incapable, they followed another bad idea, and they freely loosened their women and daughters even more than Moab. About the women of Midian, it is written: \"Behold, these caused the children of Yisrael...\" (Bemidbar 31:16). <strong>Everything stemmed from Midian.</strong> They took counsel with their chief that he should loosen his daughter, since they were plotting to ensnare Moses in their net. They adorned her with how many spells, so she should successfully catch the head OF YISRAEL. And the Holy One, blessed be He, \"turns wise men back\" (Yeshayah 44:25).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>...</p>\n<ol start=\"96\">\n<li><p><strong>Everything originated in Midian in several ways. Therefore, Midian was punished and the Holy One, blessed be He, said to Moses, \"Execute the vengeance of the children of Yisrael on the Midianites\" (Bemidbar 31:2).</strong> For you, it is appropriate and becoming. As for Moab, I leave them alone until the two jewels will come out from among them. Here's David son of Yishai who will take revenge on Moab, and will rinse the loaded pot of filth from Pe'or. This is what it says, \"Moab is my washpot\" (Tehilim 60:10) assuredly. As long as these two jewels did not come out of there, they were not punished. As soon as they came out, David came and washed clean the pot from their filth, and all received their punishment, Midian during the time of Moses and Moab during the time of David.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Come and see that, in spite of all this, the wicked of Midian did not rest from all their evil. Generations later, when they saw that Joshua had died, together with all the elders who were worthy to have miracles caused through them, they figured that the time was now opportune. What did they do? They approached Amalek and told them, It is worth it for you to remember what the children of Yisrael and their master Moses and his disciple Joshua have brought upon you that will destroy you from the world. Now is the opportune time, for they have no one to shield them. We will go and accompany you, as is written: \"Midian and Amalek and the children of the east...\" (Shoftim 6:33). \"And because of Midian the children of Yisrael made for themselves the tunnels...\" (Ibid. 2). <strong>There was no one in the world who wished to harm the children of YISRAEL like Midian.</strong> You might say Amalek; because of jealousy of the covenant, they approached the covenant TO HARM IT. <strong>Therefore, the Holy One, blessed be He, took everlasting vengeance, which was not to be forgotten. They agreed that it was certainly so and there was no doubt in the world.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Is it pious even if not required?</p>\n<p>I am aware the Shma Al Hamittah includes a paragraph of forgiveness but my question is more in terms of our obligation: is forgiving someone who hadn’t asked required, recommended, or perhaps neither?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There is no requirement to forgive someone that does not petition for forgiveness. Nevertheless forgiving someone that has not requested it can be an expression of piety.</p>\n<p>The Talmud (Megillah 28a) attributes Nehunya b. ha-Qana's longevity to his practice of forgiving all those that wronged him before going to sleep:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא עלתה על מטתי קללת חברי כי הא דמר זוטרא כי הוה סליק לפורייה אמר שרי\nליה לכל מאן דצערן</p>\n<p>Rabbi Neḥunya also said: Nor did I ever allow the resentment caused by\nmy fellow’s curse to go up with me upon my bed. This is referring to\nconduct such as that of Mar Zutra. When he would go to bed at night,\nhe would first say: I forgive anyone who has vexed me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Within the context of discussing the misvah of rebuking one's fellow, where such rebuke would be of no avail, the Rambam in H. Deoth 6:9 states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מי שחטא עליו חברו ולא רצה להוכיחו ולא לדבר לו כלום, מפני שהיה החוטא\nהדיוט ביותר או שהייתה דעתו משובשת, ומחל לו בליבו, ולא שטמו ולא\nהוכיחו--הרי זו מידת חסידות:  לא הקפידה תורה, אלא על המשטמה.</p>\n<p>It is pious behavior if a person who was wronged by a colleague would\nrather not admonish him or mention the matter at all because the\nperson who wronged him was very boorish or because he was mentally\ndisturbed, [provided] he forgives him totally without bearing any\nfeelings of hate or admonishing him. The Torah is concerned only with\nthose who carry feelings of hate.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This does not mean that under all circumstances that it is pious to forgive others without their having requested of it.</p>\n<p>The Talmud recounts (Yoma 87a) that R. Zera sought to give those that offended him the opportunity to repent and ask for forgiveness:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ר' זירא כי הוה ליה מילתא בהדי איניש הוה חליף ותני לקמיה וממציא ליה כי\nהיכי דניתי וניפוק ליה מדעתיה</p>\n<p>It is related that when Rabbi Zeira had a complaint against a person\nwho insulted him, he would pace back and forth before him and present\nhimself, so that the person could come and appease him. Rabbi Zeira\nmade himself available so that it would be easy for the other person\nto apologize to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In summary it appears that where there is no utility in rebuking the offender, then forgiving them is meritorious (though not mandatory), and where there is potential utility (i.e. the offender may repent of their ways), then withholding forgiveness is an appropriate tact.</p>\n\n\n",

When he would stand up, they would stand up. When he would sit down again, they would sit down again. When he ate, they would eat. When he drank, they would drink. Finally, he asked permission to speak, as it says (Job 3:1, 3), “Afterward, Job began to speak, and cursed the day of his birth.” And he said, “Perish the day on which I was born, and the night it was announced: A male has been conceived!” Perish the day that my father came to my mother and she told him: I am pregnant.</strong> And how do we know that they did not all start speaking at the same time? For it says (Job 3:2), “Job answered and said…” and then (Job 4:1), “Elifaz HaTeimani answered and said…” and then (Job 8:1), “Bildad HaShukhi answered and said…” and then (Job 11:1), “Tzofar HaNa’amati answered and said…” and then (Job. 32:6), “Elihu ben Berakhel HaBuzi answered and said….” <strong>The book lays them out one at a time (however), to let everyone know that a wise person does not speak before someone who is greater in wisdom.

    "content": "# Sukkos 2a ~ Reality shows the need for 13-אמות while the Gemara states that the smallest Sukkah is enough?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sukkah.2a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reb Zeira says</a> that a sukkah lower than 20 amot is kosher because the <strong>s’chach</strong> (roof covering) is what provides the shade, not the walls. This follows the verse:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וסוכה תהיה לצל יומם\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In Tishrei (when Sukkot occurs), the sun in Israel is 32 degrees away from the zenith. If you calculate, a wall 20 amot tall casts a shadow of length = TAN(32°) * 20 \\≈ 13 amot.</p>\n<p>Does this mean the sukkah must be at least 13 amot wide so that the shade is from the <strong>s’chach</strong> rather than the wall?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The purpose of the s'chach of any sukkah is to provide protection from the daytime heat when the sun is directly overhead at a 90-degree angle, Sukkah 2b. We are not concerned about the angle of the sun to the s'chach at sunrise, sunset, nighttime, or various locations in the world where the sun does not achieve a complete 90-degree angle. Therefore, since the mitzvah of dwelling in a sukkah applies around the world in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres at the same time during Yom Tov of Sukkot, Reb Zeira's sukkah would not have a different minimum area than 4x4 amos which scales from there with a 1:5 ratio if he would happened to be on different continents during Yom Tov. This would is also true of Rav Huna at 7x7 tefachim which also scales with a 1:5 ratio and Rav Chanan bar Rabbah at 7x7 tefacim scaling at a 1.17:20 ratio. These ratios represent <strong>minimum amounts of shade time</strong> when the sun passes over the sukkah at a perpendicular angle of 90-degrees to produce equal or more shade from the s'chach at the floor level where one dwells, Sukkah 22b. This understanding accounts for locations in the world where Jews are dwelling in exile and the sunlight and heat of the day is the most direct and intense. The fact that these shade ratios and their resulting physical dimensions will produce less to even no shade time of the s’chach at the floor level in other locations of the world (such as Israel, Russia, or Australia) is not a concern.</p>\n<p>For example, in the name of Rav, Rav Huna and Rav Chanan bar Rabbah argue over a matter of length on 2b, but what is the source of their dispute? The Gemara on 22b states that when Mishna 2a says ושחמתה מרובה מצלתה פסולה it means that equal or greater shade of the s’chach must be present at the ground level where a person dwells, otherwise the sukkah is invalid.  This is the opinion of all and not a unique requirement of Rebbi Zeira on 2a or Rav Huna on 2b.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wiXVKcpY.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/wiXVKcpY.gif\" alt=\"Shade of the floor\" /></a></p>\n<p>Therefore, it can deduced that an additional factor involved in the disputes between the Tanna Kamma and Rebbi Yehuda according to Rav Huna and Rav Chanan bar Rabbah in the name of Rav, is not that the s’chach must be capable of producing shade at the floor of the sukkah where a person dwells (regarding this everyone agrees), but more specifically regarding the amount of time that the s’chach (and not the walls) must provide protection from the daytime heat in order for the sukkah to be valid, as the Torah states וסוכה תהיה לצל <strong>יומם מחורב</strong>.</p>\n<p>Imagine a person in a very hot desert.  He needs protection from the daytime heat.  Would a structure with a length to height ratio that provides only 5 minutes of shade at חצות be called a sukkah?  Perhaps a legal sukkah must provide one or more hours of shade at the floor of the sukkah where a person dwells to be valid.</p>\n<p>The Gemara 2b explains that the Tanna Kamma of Rav Huna in the name of Rav understands that the source of the 20 amos height limitation of a sukkah is derived directly from the requirement that a sukkah must provide a certain amount of protective shade during the daytime heat, which according to him is minimally accomplished with a length to height ratio of 1:5, as the Gemara states: כמאן כרבי זירא דאמר משום צל הוא וכיון דרויחא איכא צל סוכה.</p>\n<p>However, Rav Chanan bar Rabbah’s opinion also holds that a valid sukkah must provide equal or more shade at the ground level where a person dwells as described in Gemara 22b and Mishna 2a, but he does not hold that the 20 amos height limitation of a sukkah is derived from the requirement of shade, as does Rav Huna.  Rather, the 20 amos height limitation of a sukkah is derived from the law of noticeability (למען ידעו), like Rabbah stated on 2a.</p>\n<p>Consequently, this opinion of the Tanna Kamma did not have an answer for what the minimum amount of time is that a sukkah had to provide shade from the daytime heat. Therefore, the Tanna Kamma of Rav Chanan bar Rabbah’s opinion utilized the principle of תפשת מרובה לא תפשת תפשת מועט תפשת and determined the shade ratio from their understanding of the minimum size sukkah.  And since this opinion of the Tanna Kamma holds that a sukkah is valid until 20 amos in height on the basis of למען ידעו and Beis Shammai’s opinion that a sukkah is a דירת קבע, which requires a minimum size sukkah of ראשו ורובו ושולחנו in regards to its length, it used these factors to define its opinion of what the minimum amount of time is that a legal sukkah must provide shade during the daytime heat.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lQwgcRw9.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/lQwgcRw9.jpg\" alt=\"Rav Chanan bar Rabah\" /></a></p>\n<p>Therefore, Rav Huna maintained that a valid sukkah required 1 hour and 31 minutes of shade from the s’chach at the floor of the sukkah, while Rav Chanan bar Rabbah maintained that the minimum amount of shade from the s’chach is 27 minutes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/65uFOesB.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/65uFOesB.jpg\" alt=\"Shade of the S'chach Calculations\" /></a>\n<a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4aM4ndeL.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/4aM4ndeL.jpg\" alt=\"Shade Formulas\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The math works out almost exactly if you make slightly different assumptions than you're making.</p>\n<p>Instead of Yerushalayim on Sukkos, look at <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jabal+Mousa/@28.5395242,33.9709379,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x1454855532dfc1cf:0x8f6d107a766ebf7!8m2!3d28.5392576!4d33.9749193\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Jebel Musa</a>, the mountain commonly identified as Har Sinai, on the summer solstice.  This is the place and approximate date when Sukkos was first mentioned at the end of parshas Mishpatim.</p>\n<p>Also, we're going to want to rotate the minimal sized sukkah so that the diagonal is north to south.  That means the length of the sukkah is 7sqrt(2) tefachim ~= 1.65 amos.</p>\n<p>The latitude of the peak is about 28.5 degrees north, and at the time of Matan Torah the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axial_tilt#/media/File:Obliquity_of_the_ecliptic_laskar.PNG\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tropic of Cancer</a> was at approximately 23.9 degrees north, so the angle of the sun at noon on the summer solstice is about 4.6 degrees.  tan(4.6 degrees) = 0.0804, which is within 3% of (7sqrt(2) tefachim) / (20 amos).  That's well within my errors in identifying the exact spot on Har Sinai and in reading the plot from Wikipedia.</p>\n\n\n",

Consider the meridian (the line along the longitude) at clock noon in the middle of the time zone. Thus, any location east of the center of the time zone would have the meridian before noon clock time. For example, Yerushalayim is approximately 20 minutes east of the center of its time zone. Thus, when chatzos is at noon in the center of the time zone, it would be at 11:40 AM clock time in Yerushalayim. Perhaps this is the situation that you are observing.</p>\n<p>As an example, <a href=\"https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/israel/jerusalem\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">solar noon</a> today in Jerusalem was 12:45 (Daylight Savings Time) which would be 11:45 AM standard time.

For even one who kills another by accident needs atonement: therefore if there are no witnesses to the deed to make him liable to banishment and he does not humble himself, the Holy One, blessed be He, will require it of him</strong>, just as our Rabbis explain the text, (Exodus 21:13) ‘‘But God causes it to come to hand”, in Treatise Makkot (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.10b.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkot 10b</a>): The Holy One, blessed be He, causes them (the man who killed by accident and had not expiated the murder and the man who killed with premeditation) to meet at the same inn.

We find the word אדרוש in both senses depending on circumstances, compare Ezekiel 34,10. <strong>The emphasis on איש את אחיו, refers to G’d exacting such retribution from humans for killing humans, seeing that this is not their nature, or should not be their nature.</strong> He will not exact retribution from an animal which killed a human being who, in G’d’s eyes, had already forfeited its right to live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Bekhor_Shor%2C_Genesis.9.5.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bechor Shor</a> - Hashem will seek reckoning from both the hand of a man who kills and likewise that of his brother.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.9.5.5&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> - Hashem demands an accounting for anyone that kills themselves or another person, and in the case of straight out murder, G-d demands that the case be settled by tribunal through human court (beis din).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.9.5?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.9.5.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ha'amek Davar</a> - Hashem as it were is explaining here specifically  when a person should be punished. It is different to a time of war and a time of hatred, as then there is a time to kill the perpetrator and there is no resulting punishment. (Like it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shevuot.35b.17?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shevuos 35b</a> that a monarchy that kills one of every six individuals in the world is not punished , and even a Jewish king may wage war even if many other Jews will be killed.)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Rabbeinu Bachya - Similar to Chizkuni, if a man kills and there are witnesses there should be human intervention through the courts and if no witnesses then Hashem Himself will serve as Judge.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah continues ומיד האדם, “and from the human being, etc.” This refers to instances where there are witnesses to the murder. <strong>In other words: man must judge murder when there are witnesses, whereas G-d will judge the murderer when there is no evidence which is admissible in a human tribunal.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I think it depends on whether you count Ramesses. It's considered a stop in the overall 42, but they didn't actually travel there. That's where they left Egypt from.</p>\n<p>On your first question, the first 11 encampments being in the first year is based on the verses that say that Bnei Yisrael were still in the Sinai Desert after the start of the second year (the second Passover):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The LORD spoke to Moses in <strong>the wilderness of Sinai</strong>, on the first new moon of <strong>the second year following the exodus from the land of Egypt</strong>, saying: Let the Israelite people offer the passover sacrifice at its set time...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.9.1-2?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 9:1-2</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Turning over to the list of encampments, we see that there ten before Sinai (not including Ramesses, which is where they left Egypt from), and Sinai makes eleven: Sukkot, Etam, Pi Hachirot, Marah, Eilim, Yam Suf, Sin Desert, Dofkah, Alush, Refidim, Sinai Desert.</p>\n<p>The last set of journeys start off from Etzion Gaver, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.2.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etzion Gaver was in the edge of Edom</a> (and see Chizkuni <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.33.36?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Numbers.20.1.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), where they were for most of the forty years:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Thus, after you had remained at Kadesh all that long time, we marched back into the wilderness by the way of the Sea of Reeds, as the LORD had spoken to me, a<strong>nd skirted the hill country of Seir a long time</strong>. Then the LORD said to me: <strong>You have been skirting this hill country long enough</strong>; now turn north.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.1.46-2.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 1:46-2:3</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Israelites arrived in a body at the wilderness of Zin on the first month, <strong>and the people stayed at Kadesh</strong>. Miriam died there and was buried there.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.20.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 20:1</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>and:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Now we are in <strong>Kadesh</strong>, the town on the border of your territory.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Numbers.20.16?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bamidbar 20:16</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now, evidently, Chabad and other commentators hold that the journey to Etzion Gaver also happened in the fortieth year, so we can add that to the list. And so we get the last eleven: Etzion Gaver, Kadesh, Hor Hahar, Tzalmonah, Punon, Ovot, Iyei Ha'avarim, Divon Gad, Almon Divlataim, Harei Ha'avarim, Arvot Moav.</p>\n<p>And so we have nineteen journeys remaining: Kivrot Ha'taavah, Chatzerot, Ritmah, Rimon Paretz, Livnah, Rissah, Kehelatah, Har Shafer, Charadah, Makhelot, Tachat, Tarach, Mitkah, Chashmonah, Moserot, Bnei Ya'akan, Chor Hagidgad, Yotvatah, Evronah.</p>\n<p>For more info, I recommend checking out the Wikipedia table (in Hebrew) <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99_%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99_%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%9E%D7%93%D7%91%D7%A8#%D7%AA%D7%97%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%AA_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%A1%D7%A2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Its name in the Septuagint and in the writings of the Church Fathers (Eusebius and Clement) is Τα Μακκαβαïκά, i.e., “Maccabean matters” or “the Book of the Maccabees.” The original Hebrew name of the book is unknown. According to Origin it was “Sarbeth Sabaniel.” Different hypotheses have been suggested to explain these words, which should perhaps read: סֵפֶר בֵּית סָרְבָנֵי אֵל (Sefer Beit Sarevanei El), the words Sarevanei El (“who strive for God”) being a translation into contemporary (mishnaic) Hebrew of Jehoiarib, the name of the priestly order (see I Chron. 24:7; Neh. 12:6, 19) to which the Hasmonean family belonged. In support of this conjecture is the fact that in later times, after the glamor of the Hasmonean dynasty had become tarnished, the name Jehoiarib is found translated by the above word in its Aramaic form מסרבי (mesarevei; TJ, Ta’an. 4:8, 68d) though it is there used in a pejorative sense as “rebellious,” “fractious.”....<strong>The many expressions in the Greek version which occur only in biblical Hebrew (e.g., from the hands of the gentiles: mi-yad ha-goyim; and his heart was raised: va-yarom libbo; before his face: al panav; and the matter found favor in their eyes: va-yitav ha-davar be-eineihem) clearly confirm the testimony of the Church Fathers that the original language of the book was Hebrew.</strong> The style was biblical Hebrew (including use of the vav conversive), and particularly that of the historical books of the Bible. Like Joshua and Judges, it begins with the vav conversive, but reflects the style of Ezra and Nehemiah in including historical documents and similar testimony.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it writes <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/maccabees-second-book-of\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> about the second book:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Second Book of Maccabees, known in Greek as Τά Μακκαβαïκά, that is, the narratives about (Judah called) the Maccabee. It was this title which gave the title to the other books of the Apocrypha bearing the same name. It is an abridgment of a larger work of five books written by a *Jason of Cyrene who is otherwise unknown (see 2:23–28). Traces of the original division may be preserved in the similar conclusions in several chapters (3:40; 7:42; 10:9; 13:26; 15:37–39). <strong>Unlike I Maccabees which was written in Hebrew, the original language of this book was Greek;</strong> and unlike the former, which begins with an account of the revolt of Mattathias and tells of the wars of his sons the Hasmoneans up to the days of John Hyrcanus, this book deals solely with the deeds of *Judah Maccabee, and only until his victory over Nicanor on 13 Adar II, 164 B.C.E.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although if helpful there do exist translations into Hebrew.

However, to add a regular, fixed prayer in the Shemoneh Esrei is an excessively arrogant and disrespectful [act] against the Men of the Great Assembly [who composed the Shemoneh Esrei].  And regarding this every Torah scholar agrees, as do all in whom the fear of G-d is in their midst.  Accordingly, one should cry out against the publishers who have added in the prayer books in \"Hear our voices\" a fixed prayer: \"Please G-d, I have sinned...\" \"You are the One who feeds and sustains...\".  Many of the commoners say this [insertion] regularly like all the prayer of Shemoneh Esrei\", and my heart is sick upon me over this act.    I have heard that one of the leaders of the past generation [protested] loudly over this.  However, because of our many sins, \"the world has been given over to fools\" (see Sanhedrin 46b), and the publishers do whatever they want and we don't have the ability to [successfully] object.  [Regarding] this that they cite from the Zohar that it is good to request regularly regarding one's sustenance even if one is wealthy, or to confess one's sins (Magen Avraham 1), this is indeed the case, but not to make a fixed formulation in the middle of the prayers of the Men of the Great Assembly.  And if he wants to he can say them after the [Shemoneh Esrei] prayer, and after [he says the completing verse] \"May they find favor...\" (Psalms 19:15), and [then] who would protest [his doing this]?

I have seen people say that it was an attempt to stop daily usage of hebrew and turn it into a language used exclusively for religious purposes.</em></p>\n<p>There is an assumption here that Hebrew was the spoken language in the time of the Mishna. The Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.49b.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 49b</a>) seems to indicate otherwise:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>איני והאמר רבי בא\"י לשון סורסי למה אלא אי לשון הקודש אי לשון יוונית ואמר רב יוסף בבבל לשון ארמי למה אלא או לשון הקודש או לשון פרסי</p>\n<p>It is understood from both the mishna and the baraita that it is prohibited to learn Greek. The Gemara raises a question: Is that so? But didn’t Rabbi Yehuda HaNasi say: In Eretz Yisrael, why should people speak the tongue of Syriac [Sursi], the Aramaic commonly spoken in Eretz Yisrael? Rather, they should speak either in the sacred tongue, Hebrew, or in the beautiful tongue of Greek. And Rav Yosef similarly said: In Babylonia, why should they speak in the vernacular tongue of Aramaic? Rather, they should speak either in the sacred tongue, Hebrew, or in the tongue of Persian, used by the authorities.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>And why was a scholarly text, which was created for individuals who also obviously understood Hebrew, written in Aramaic?</em></p>\n<p>Part of the answer is that this was the common language, and the original wording was kept when possible. But that begs the question, why is the Gemara different than the Mishna in this regard?</p>\n<p>I heard an interesting answer from a student of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Weiss_Halivni\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav(?) David Weiss Halivni</a>, that the Gemara is composed of two main strata, the statements of the Ammoraim and the discussions. He points out that the statements are for the most part in Hebrew, and similar to the style of the Mishna in their brevity and precise language, while the discussions of the Gemara use mainly a limited Aramaic vocabulary. His theory is that the statements where memorized in their specific formulation  and passed down in essentially the same way as the Mishna was passed down orally, while the discussions where not meant to be passed down in their specific language, just as a traditional argument, and the wording that was used in the Yeshivos of the Geonim is what eventually became the text of the Gemara when it was finally written down in the mid-Geonic period.</p>\n<p>(By the way, the same process happened with the Rishonim. Some explanations became a canonized text that is preserved in many Rishonim who explain a point wherever and by whomever it comes up, whereas the arguments from other sources or logic are preserved in abstract from one generation to the next, but the wording is not at all preserved.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Maharal <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derech_Chaim.5.23.6?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Derech Chayim, 5, 23)</a> writes that the notion of Aramaic being the common vernacular at that time is tenable as to why the Talmud Bavli was written in Aramaic, however with regard to the Talmid Yeushalmi, where the primary language was Hebrew, such an answer is unsatisfactory.

Pretty much all of Mesopotamia spoke Aramaic, so even  if you were Jewish you  had to speak it in everyday existence to do business or speak with other groups. Even during the second temple era Aramaic was common due to those who had returned from exile in Aramaic speaking countries. Once Aramaic was common in all secular conversation it began to dominate.</p>\n<p>The above is also part of why the Gemara is written in Aramaic.

    "content": "# In the yearly cycle, how many offerings, tithes, and sacrifices would an Israelite household provide?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The purpose of this question is to understand the amount that a household would give to the tabernacle following the law found in the books of Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.  One example of this law is found in Numbers 29 and 29.  These chapters describe a yearly cycle of offering and sacrifice.  Yet, it is unclear how much of the offering was done by the priests for the entire nation and how much it was obligatory on households.</p>\n<p>For example, Numbers 28:3-8 -  “3 And you shall say to them, This is the food offering that you shall offer to the LORD: two male lambs a year old without blemish, day by day, as a regular offering. 4 The one lamb you shall offer in the morning, and the other lamb you shall offer at twilight; 5 also a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with a quarter of a hin of beaten oil. 6 It is a regular burnt offering, which was ordained at Mount Sinai for a pleasing aroma, a food offering to the LORD. 7 Its drink offering shall be a quarter of a hin for each lamb. In the Holy Place, you shall pour out a drink offering of strong drink to the LORD. 8 The other lamb you shall offer at twilight. Like the grain offering of the morning, and like its drink offering, you shall offer it as a food offering, with a pleasing aroma to the LORD.”  Is this daily morning and night offering made by the priests only for the whole nation? Does each household perform the morning and evening offerings?</p>\n<p>Reading on in Numbers 28 and 29, there are prescribed offerings and sacrifices for each Sabbath day, the beginning of each month, and then the high holy days.  Adding it all together, what would the average household have given in a year?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Numbers 28--29 is communal offerings. Those were done by Temple priests, and funded by everyone's annual half-shekel dues. (In fact, the Talmud's tractate <em>Shekalim</em> is all about said public funds. These communal sacrifices <em>must</em> come from public monies!)</p>\n<p>The average family was responsible for a Passover lamb (which they could \"go in on\" with other families if needed), and <em>some</em> kind of offering at each pilgrimage. If someone wasn't wealthy, those could be lambs too, so we're talking four lambs. (Even then, the Passover lamb was mostly eaten by its owners.)</p>\n<p>Firstborn male livestock were given to priests; tithes of new livestock had to be eaten in Jerusalem (by the owners). A few symbolic first fruits to the priest annually; recommend-2%-but-it-could-be-a-single-kernel to the priests; 10% of crops to the Levites, and a subsequent 10% either to the poor or eat-it-yourself-in-Jerusalem, depending on the year.</p>\n<p>A couple more offerings for childbirth -- but those explicitly offered a cheaper option of doves for those who couldn't afford livestock.</p>\n<p>All in all, if you average the eat-it-yourself-in-Jerusalem years with the give-it-to-the-Levite years, you're looking at 14% annually of your produce that you can't eat yourself, plus four lambs, maybe two doves, one fruit basket, and a half shekel of cash. Oh and a couple pounds of wool when shearing. Quite reasonable; a lot of these are really symbolic. And then a tenth your livestock plus eh, 6% on average of your produce that had to be eaten in Jerusalem. Still, really not that hefty. A lot of it was really symbolic, small amounts throughout the agricultural cycle, to constantly reinforce the religious message.</p>\n\n\n",

Goren wrote a 200 page book explaining his position (linked in Joel K's answer). If you're looking for something shorter and easier, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._David_Bleich\" rel=\"noreferrer\">R. J. David Bleich</a> discussed this topic in the first volume of <em>Contemporary Halachic Problems</em> (p. 167 - 176). He summarizes R. Goren's five pronged argument as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Goren, claiming to have had additional evidence not available to the rabbinical courts which had previously held hearings on the matter, bases his decision on the following considerations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There exists no admissible evidence attesting to Avraham Borokovsky's conversion to Judaism.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>In the event that a valid conversion ceremony did take place, the conversion was nullified by virtue of the fact that Borokovsky continued to live as a practicing Christian. Rabbi Goren cites <em>Zofnat Pa'aneah</em>, (a commentary on the <em>Mishneh Torah</em> authored by the late Rabbi Yosef Rosen, in which Rabbi Rosen interprets Rambam as maintaining that subsequent idolatry on the part of a convert is tantamount to proof that the original conversion was insincere and hence invalid.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The original wedding ceremony between Chava Ginsberg and Avraham Borokovsky took place in a church. There is no evidence, argues Rabbi Goren, that they were subsequently married in accordance with the law of Israel.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The conversion of Avraham Borokovsky, if it indeed did take place, was the result of coercion on the part of Chava Ginsberg's father hence is null and void.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Even if the conversion were to be accepted as valid, Borokovsky, since he subsequently reverted to the practice of Christianity, would have the status of an apostate. <em>Ba'al ha-Ma'or</em> maintains that an apostate is not biblically qualified to issue a bill of divorce; according to <em>Ba'al ha-Ma'or</em>, a divorce executed by an apostate is valid only by virtue of rabbinic decree. It is, however, axiomatic that rabbinic legislation cannot validate a divorce which is biblically invalid. The formula invoked in such situations is an annulment of the original marriage. Such annulment is within the province of rabbinic jurisdiction, since all marriages are conducted according to \"the law of Moses and Israel.\" The term \"law of Moses\" refers to biblical law, while \"law of Israel\" encompasses rabbinic legislation. Rabbi Goren argues that since Borokovsky is to be deemed an apostate, the bill of divorce which he ultimately delivered to Chava Langer had the effect of retroactively annulling their marriage. As a result, she was yet an \"unwed woman\" in the eyes of Jewish law at the time of her involvement with Otto Langer and hence the issue of that union are not to be considered bastards.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(This should not be taken to mean that R. Bleich supported R. Goren's position. Indeed, much of the rest of the article consists of counterpoints to these arguments.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>You can read Rav Goren’s own explanation of his <em>pesak din</em> <a href=\"https://marriage-il.com/%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9F-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%97-%D7%95%D7%94%D7%90%D7%97%D7%95%D7%AA-19-12-1972/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n",

Such as in <code>Genesis (2:23)</code> when Adam names Eve \"אישה\" -</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then the man said, “This one at last Is bone of my bones And flesh of\nmy flesh. This one shall be called Woman, For from man was she taken.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And if the explanation for a certain name is not mentioned explicitly in the Torah, it is at least explained by the sages.  Thus indeed angels could be named individually according to the role that they come to play and task they come to fulfil, so why weren't they clearly named from the beginning? He cites a Midrash. The Midrash (Bamidbar Raba 10) about Manoach, when the angle came to inform him and his barren wife that they will give birth to Shimshon, Manoach asks of his name. The angel replies (13:18):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“You must not ask for my name; it is beyond me!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash explains that the angel could not name himself as his name depends on Hashems mission for him, which is dynamic.</p>\n<p>Therefore in previous times angels are not named explicitly due to Godliness being revealed within Israel, the angels were constantly changing names, Hashem always commanding them to change forces going \"beyond\" their nature. However, with the exile to Babylonia, miracles and changes to nature becoming a very rare occasion, the angels could be called static names.</p>\n<p>I recommend opening this inside, he has a wonderful and profound in-depth explanation over there about the role of angels.</p>\n\n\n",

Stopping and taking out the recipient's heart would seem to be technically considered as causing halachic death (i.e. murder).

Do not read it as even [shinan], rather read it as: That which are not [she’einan]. Since the minimum of thousands is two thousand, the phrase: That which are not thousands, indicates that two thousand are not present, i.e., the chariots of God are twenty thousand minus two thousand, which means that God rides in eighteen thousand worlds.

    "content": "# How do Jewish sects view the role of the legal law of the Halacha in today's society?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The legal laws of the books of Moses included rulings on stoning adulterers, homosexuals, disobedient children, etc. Christians view these laws as no longer binding on Christians today through the atonement of Christ but how do Jews view the role of these laws? What do Jewish sects (Orthodox, Conservative, etc.) think about these laws and the role they play in modern society? Do some Jews think these laws should be applied to the Holy Land? And what reasoning do those Jews who think they shouldn't be applied anymore give?</p>\n<p>I would greatly appreciate references for further reading on this topic would be included.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Orthodox/Conservative/Reform are \"denominations\" of Judaism; \"sect\" isn't quite the right term. (\"Sects\" tend to vote in a bloc; good luck getting all Orthodox Jews to agree on anything politically.)</p>\n<p>Unless otherwise specified, you'll hear an Orthodox perspective here. The following answer reflects Orthodox Judaism.</p>\n<p>The Talmud takes for granted that there was a spoken law accompanying the written one; often what was written to sound as a very harsh punishment was actually intended under extremely limited conditions. (Similarly, \"an eye for an eye\" meant that was what was deserved, but the courts actually just demanded financial restitution.) Talmud said the death penalty was incredibly rare; when murder rates shot up, the unsolved-murder ritual stopped being used as the sight of a murdered body no longer shocked anyone; similarly when the general state of marriage in society fell apart, they stopped doing the suspected-adulteress ritual as it no longer shocked anyone. So the prescribed death penalties were only used when the crime was rare and shocking. And the perpetrator warned, and s/he verbally acknowledged the warning, and ...</p>\n<p>(The Talmud further adds so many caveats and provisos to the rebellious-son law that at least in one opinion, it was never actually carried out. Rather it's there for the moral teachings behind it.)</p>\n<p>Furthermore any application of the death penalty requires Jewish self-rule (the Jews told Jerome that's why the Book of Susannah wasn't canonized).</p>\n<p><em>Furthermore</em>, corporal punishment requires a panel of rabbis who have \"super-ordination\", which was ended by the Romans c. 600 CE. (There have been some interesting attempts to reboot such ordination ... but that's another conversation.)</p>\n<p>Thus: anything that Leviticus says deserves death is still deemed \"a very great sin\", and if someone is stuck in a situation choosing the lesser of two evils, then a sin that never warranted the death penalty is less-bad than one that theoretically could. But to actually carry out such penalties required very rare circumstances that are entirely impractical today.</p>\n<p>There's a letter from Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, the most prominent American Orthodox authority on <em>halacha</em> for a good part of the late 20th Century, to Governor Carey of New York, as the latter (a Catholic) was considering ending New York's death penalty. Rabbi Feinstein was not pushing for or against New York's penalty, simply defending Judaism's past use of capital punishment as being very rare and having appropriate safeguards.</p>\n<p>As your question stated \"halacha\" in general (no definite article required, just as you wouldn't say \"the canon law\") -- Jewish civil law is alive and well. If two Jews in Omaha have a contract dispute, they are supposed to go to a rabbinic panel and have it settled according to <em>halacha</em>, rather than duke it out in Nebraska state court. (Of course as far as the State of Nebraska is concerned, if two parties in a civil suit want to settle out-of-court, or go for arbitration/mediation, go for it! So the parties will ideally sign a legally-binding arbitration agreement agreeing to follow the ruling of the rabbinic panel.)</p>\n<p>On the other hand if you live in Omaha and someone breaks into your house and shoots at you, that's not a job for the rabbis! That's a job for local law enforcement and the criminal-justice system.</p>\n<p>In Israel, parties in civil cases have the option of going before a rabbinic panel following <em>Halacha</em>, or instead using \"secular\" Israeli law -- itself largely derived from the colonial empires (Britain and the Ottomans) previously ruling there. Israel's first chief rabbi, Isaac Herzog, wanted to see more of Halacha implemented in civil law, and to this day there is a school of thought trying to incorporate more <em>Mishpat Ivri</em> -- \"Hebraic Code\" in civil suits. As people have their choice on this (and a large portion of the Israeli public has no interest in the rabbis), the status quo seems to work pretty well on this.</p>\n<p>Lastly we get to family law. For instance, the Talmud says there is simply no way a marriage can be effected <em>halachically</em> between a Jew and a non-Jew. Ergo virtually no Orthodox rabbi will perform an intermarriage (barring some very, very interesting mental gymnastics). The US, of course, lets people get married by a justice of the peace irrespective of their faiths (or lack thereof). You don't hear American rabbis trying to change US law on that; history has shown that once you single out Jews for special treatment in the law, it doesn't end well.</p>\n<p>The Ottoman Empire left family law up to each community's faith group; this became British policy, and then shifted smoothly to the Israeli policy. This means anyone who wants to get married or divorced in Israel has to go to officially-recognized clergy for their faith. (<em>Or</em> they can get a civil marriage/divorce in another country, which will then be recognized by the \"secular\" legal authorities upon their return to Israel.) A Jew-and-non-Jew couple, or for that matter a <em>kohen</em> and a divorcee, will be turned down by the Israeli rabbinate even if the couple doesn't care a fig about <em>halacha.</em> There has thus been a push for Israel to allow civil marriages. (To be fair: there are other reasons at play here.) I'd imagine most Orthodox rabbis prefer the status quo as it does prevent many problems, but there are some who feel that the mixing of political power with religious influence is toxic and that Israeli law should be more liberal on this too. (Not that they would marry a kohen and a divorcee, but that religion is best spent convincing than forcing.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This answer must be read with the perspective of the <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/124416/19563\">previous answer</a> about the very limited application of capital punishment in Jewish law.

We find that it is written (Judges 16,30) concerning Samson who was able to kill so many of his adversaries: ויט בכח, “he pulled with (his) might,” though we would have expected the prophet Samuel to write: ויט בכחו, “he pulled with his might.” The implication is that the word בכח refers to G’d’s strength. Samson “co-opted” G’d’s strength to that of his own in order to bring about this impressive result, i.e. that 3,000 Philistines died as a result of his uprooting two pillars of the temple. The name of G’d which emerges from this verse is to be read in an unusual order. [The author refers to the custom of reading the words 'לישועתך קיויתי ה in three different sequences. He bases this on the fact that the mystique of the כח which assisted Samson lay in the re-arrangement of these three words in different permutations, קיויתי ה' לישועתך, לישועתך ה' קיויתי as well as ה' לישועתך קיויתי. When a prayer containing these words is offered in that manner it is liable to be effective. Ed.] By reversing the words, the enemy “falls ”backwards,” so to speak.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This specifically answers why we say it out of order and that it's allowed. It does not explain why we say the Onkelus version, nor does it explain why we say it after Ani Maamin. (unless it's connected to leaving shul and starting the day, and we say it as a protection from our enemies).</p>\n\n\n",

If I am wrong please correct me.</p>\n<p>It would seem that Mishna Berura would permit this, if needed, as it would not be much different than tucking it into the \"corner\" or pockets of the pants.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>על בגדיו – ובכתבים איתא דטלית קטן תחת בגדיו. וכתב המגן אברהם, דעל כל פנים צריך שיהיו הציצית מבחוץ, ולא כאינך שתוחבין אותן בהכנפות. אך האנשים שהולכים בין העכו\"ם יוצאין בזה. ומכל מקום בשעת הברכה יהיו מגולין [כדי הילוך] ארבע אמות.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Over his clothing - And in כתבים it is brought that a טלית קטן [should be worn] under his clothing. And the Magen Avraham wrote, that in any case, the ציצית [strings] need to be outside, <strong>and not like those that tuck them into the corners. However, the people that go/work amongst the non-Jews fulfill their obligation with that (ie. tucked in the corners)</strong>. Nevertheless, at the time of [making] the blessing, they should be exposed [for the amount of time it takes to walk] four cubits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(כו) יראהו – כמה דכתיב: \"וראיתם אותו וזכרתם\" וגו'. ואותן האנשים המשימין הציצית בהמכנסים שלהם, לא די שמעלימין עיניהם ממאי דכתיב: \"וראיתם אותו וזכרתם\" וגו', עוד מבזין הן את מצוַת השם יתברך, ועתידין הן ליתן את הדין על זה. ומה שאומרין שהולכים בין הנוכרים, לזה היה די שישימו הציצית בתוך הכנף. ואילו היה להם איזה דורון ממלך בשר ודם שחקוק עליו שם המלך, כמה היו מתקשטין בו לפני האנשים תמיד; וקל וחומר בציצית, שמרמז על שם מלך מלכי המלכים הקדוש ברוך הוא, וכדלקמן בסימן כ\"ד סעיף ה' – כמה מתכבד האדם הנושא שמו עליו! ואמרו חז\"ל: \"הזהיר במצוַת ציצית, זוכה ורואה פני השכינה\". ומשמע מן הכתובים, דהיהודים שישארו לעת קץ יהיו מצויינים במצווה זו, כמה דכתיב: \"ובאו עשרה אנשים מכל לשונות הגוים והחזיקו בכנף איש יהודי\" וגו' (זכריה ח, כג). ואמרו חז\"ל על זה (שבת לב ב): כל הזהיר במצות ציצית זוכה ומשמשין לו שני אלפים ושמונה מאות עבדים וכו'.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>See them - Like it is written \"And you shall see it and remember\" etc. And those people that put the ציצית into their pants, not only do they hide their eyes from (ie. ignore) what is written \"And you shall see it and remember\" etc... they also disgrace the mitzvah of השם יתברך, and they will have to make a reckoning over this. And this that they say that [they must do that because] they go amongst the non-Jews, <strong>for that it would be enough to tuck the ציצית into the corner</strong>. And if they had some gift from a king of flesh and blood which had the name of the king engraved in it... how much would they adorn themselves in front of other people constantly?; How much more so by ציצית, which is an allusion to the name of the King of all Kings, the Holy One Blessed Be He. And as is seen later in Siman 24, Se'if 5 - How honorable is the man who carries His Name on him! And חז\"ל said: \"One who is careful with the מצוה of ציצית, he merits to see the Face of the שכינה\". And it is inferred from the verses, that they Jews that are remaining at the time [of redemption] will be found with this מצוה, as it is written: \"And ten men from nations of every tongue will take hold of every Jew by a corner of his cloak\" etc (Zechariah 9, 23). And חז\"ל said on this (Shabbos 32, 2): Anyone who is careful in performing the מצוה of ציצית merits that two thousand eight hundred servants will serve him [in the World-to-Come]\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Moreover, to look at it is forbidden, as it is said: \"Turn ye not unto idols\" (Lev. 19.4.); and of thinking on this subject it is said: \"And that thou inquire not after their gods, saying, How did these nations serve their god\"? (Ibid.), which is a warning that thou shalt not inquire concerning its manner of practice, though thou art not worshiping it, for this very inquiry causes a turning after it and to imitate their practice, as it is further said: \"Even so will I do likewise\" (Ibid.).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, according to Maimonides, one incurs lashes for violating this prohibition (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments.10.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Sefer HaMitzvoth</em>, Prohibition 10</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהזהירנו מנטות אחר ע\"ז ומהתעסק בספוריה, רוצה לומר בזה העיון ברוחניות, כלומר הכוכב פלוני ירד על תאר כך ויעשה כך והפלוני יקטירו לו ויעמדו לפניו על תאר כך ויעשה הדבר הפלוני ומה שילך על הדרך הזה, כי המחשבה באלו הדברים והעיון באלו הלשונות הוא מה שיעורר האדם לבקש אותם ועבודתם, והכתוב אשר הזהירנו מזה הענין הוא אמרו אל תפנו אל האלילים. ולשון ספרי אם פונה אתה אחריהם אתה עושה אותם אלהות. ושם אמרו רבי יהודה אומר אל תפנה לראותם, אפילו להסתכל צורת הצלם הנראית והמחשבה בעשיתה אינו מותר כדי שלא יתעסק חלק הזמן בחלק ממנה. ובפרק שואל אדם (דף קמ\"ט) אמרו כתב המהלך תחת הצורה ותחת הדיוקנאות אסור לקרותו בשבת ודיוקנא עצמה אפילו בחול אסור להסתכל בה משום שנאמר אל תפנו אל האלילים מאי תלמודא א\"ר יוחנן אל תפנו אל מדעתכם. וכבר נכפלה האזהרה בזה הענין בעצמו רוצה לומר באיסור מחשבה בע\"ז, והוא אמרו יתעלה השמרו לכם פן יפתה לבבכם רוצה לומר כי כשתעמיק לבך לחשוב בה יהיה מביא אותך לסור מן הדרך ולהתעסק בעבודתה. ואמר גם כן בזה הענין בעצמו ופן תשא עיניך השמימה, כי לא בא להזהיר האדם (ראשונה) שלא לראות אותם בעיניו, ואמנם הזהיר מן הענין במה שיתיחס אל עבודתם בעיון הלב. וכן אמר פן תדרוש לאלהיהם יזהיר מלדרוש איכות עבודתם אע\"פ שלא יעבדם שזה כולו מביא לטעות בהם. ודע שהעובר על זה חייב מלקות. וכבר התבאר בסוף פ\"ק מעירובין (דף י\"ז:) על מה שאמרו לוקים על עירובי תחומין ושמו ראיית זה אמרו אל יצא איש ממקומו, והקשה אחד ואמר ואיך ילקה מלקות על אזהרה במלת אל ולא באה האזהרה במלת לא, והשיבו על צד הקושיא וכי כל מה שיבא במלת אל אין לוקין עליו אלא מעתה אל תפנו אל האלילים ה\"נ דלא לקי, הנה הורה כי לאו זה לוקין עליו. (קדושים תהיו, שם פ\"ב):</p>\n<p>That He prohibited us from inclining towards idolatry and occupying ourselves with its narratives - meaning to say, into this study of spirituality. [That] means, star x descends according to this description and [then] does such; and [when] they burn incense to y and stand before it according to this description, it does thing z - and that which goes in this way. For thought about these things and study with these [types of] expressions is what arouses a person to seek them and their worship. And the verse that prohibited us from this content is His saying, \"Do not turn to the idols\" (Leviticus 19:4). And the language of the [Sifra] (Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 1:11) is, \"If you turn to them, you make them gods.\" And there (Sifra, Kedoshim, Chapter 1:10), they said, \"Rabbi Yehudah says, 'Do not turn to see them'\" - it is not even permissible to observe the appearance of the image's form and the thought of its construction, so that one not spend any time [involved with any] part of it. And in the chapter [entitled] Shoel Adam (Shabbat 149a), they said, \"[Regarding] writing that is under a picture or under graven images (deyokenaot), it is prohibited to read it on Shabbat. And [regarding] the image itself, even on a weekday it is prohibited to look at it, because it it is stated, 'Do not turn to the idols.' What is the [derivation from this verse]? Rabbi Yochanan said, 'Do not make a god from your minds.'\" And the prohibition about this very content - meaning about the prohibition of the thought of idolatry - has already been repeated. And that is His, may He be exalted, saying, \"Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be seduced\" (Deuteronomy 11:16). [This] means to say [that] if you have your heart delve into it, it will bring you to veer from the [true] path, and to become involved in its [actual] worship. And He also said about this exact content, \"And lest you lift your eyes to the sky\" (Deuteronomy 4:19). For He did not come to forbid a person from seeing them with his eyes, but rather forbade the matter in which one relates to their worship with the interest of the heart. And likewise, His saying, \"lest you inquire about their gods,\" is forbidding the inquiry about the nature of their worship, even though one does not worship them. For this all leads to erring about them. And you should know that one who transgresses this is liable for lashes. And this has already been made clear at the end of the first chapter of Eruvin (Eruvin 17b), regarding that which they said, [that] we give lashes for [going outside of] the mixing of perimeters (eruvei techumin). And they gave as a proof, His saying, \"let no (al) man go out of his place\" (Exodus 16:29); and someone asked and said, \"But how can they give lashes for a prohibition, with the word, al, when the commandment did not come with the word, lo? And they answered him rhetorically, \"And do we not give lashes for anything that comes with the word, al? But if so, we would also not give lashes for, 'Do not turn to the idols!'\" Behold this indicates that we give lashes for this negative commandment. (See Parashat Kedoshim; Mishneh Torah, Foreign Worship and Customs of the Nations 2.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Was not his burial at Mount Nevo, as it is written below (34:1), Moshe went up from the plains of Moav to Mount Nevo etc. and Mount Nevo was in the inheritance of Reuvein as it is written in parshas Matos (Bamidbar 32:37-38), The tribe of Reuvein built up Cheshbon, etc. [and] Nevo, etc. <strong>It seems to me that the plain of Nevo was large and the town was established in the plain, while the mountain was in the portion of Gad. And because the mountain and town originally belonged to one person, the mountain was called by the town’s name. Also, it was not all that far from the town and it was situated in the plain of the town. Therefore the mountain was named after the town.</strong> (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in conclusion, the region was seemingly quite large and whilst the actual town belonged to Reuven, the mountain was in the portion of Gad but retained the name of the town as it was originally owned by one person, or alternatively, it was not that far from the town so likewise kept the name.</p>\n<p>This point is reiterated by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Numbers.32.37?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Deuteronomy.34.1.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> and makes specific reference to the pasuk in Bamidbar 32:37 also:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The name in this verse appears to relate to the summit of that range of mountains which was situated on the territory of Reuven, as pointed out in Numbers 32,37 where the members of the tribe of Reuven are described as having built Nebo, etc.; when it is written concerning the territory of the tribe of Gad: “for that is where the grave of the lawgiver is situated,” (Deut. 33,21) it appears that this must have been at the boundary between the territories of Reuven and Gad.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Do the sages claim that animals possess basic morality, that they are subject to basic moral laws, maybe the 7 Noahide laws, or that their behavior is completely habitual, but we would interpret it as moral?</p>\n<p>So here comes my second question:</p>\n<p>In my understanding, we recognize that what cats do is moral only because the Torah teaches us so, and without such prior knowledge we couldn't differentiate between cats' and dogs' modesty.</p>\n<p>In such situation, without divine guidance, how would we differentiate between moral and immoral animals?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Hutner (Mamarei Pachad Yitzchak, Pesach) implies that that which animals display good traits is a true reflection of a godly nobleness that is inherent in the nature of that animal.</p>\n<p>On a similar note, Rb Wolbe (Alei Shur chelek beis, on <em>frumkeit</em>) says that animals pray to Hashem.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Note: The following is my opinion and is based primarily from the written Torah.</p>\n<p>The Bible seems to take it for granted that animals naturally have some form of morality, wisdom/understanding, and holiness. In the story of Gan Eden the serpent is called the \"most wise\" of the animals, as if other animals are wise and the serpent simply happens to be the wisest. And when the snake sins, it is punished for its sin because <em>it should have known better</em>, just like Adam and Eve.</p>\n<p>When we get to the flood story God beholds the whole earth and concludes that all flesh has become corrupt. Many commentaries limit this corruption to people, and limit it further to the corruption being the act of theft. This doesn't make sense on a peshat level because we know God is loathe to kill animals for no reason, for he says so very clearly in the book of Jonah.</p>\n<p>Jonah 4:11</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יא  וַאֲנִי לֹא אָחוּס, עַל-נִינְוֵה הָעִיר הַגְּדוֹלָה--אֲשֶׁר יֶשׁ-בָּהּ הַרְבֵּה מִשְׁתֵּים-עֶשְׂרֵה רִבּוֹ אָדָם, אֲשֶׁר לֹא-יָדַע בֵּין-יְמִינוֹ לִשְׂמֹאלוֹ, וּבְהֵמָה, רַבָּה.  {ש}   11 11 And should I not have concern for the great city of Nineveh, in which there are more than a hundred and twenty thousand people who cannot tell their right hand from their left—<strong>and also many animals?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems to me that God has concluded that nearly the entire animal kingdom has become corrupt just like mankind, and therefore he will destroy people and animals who are guilty of the same sin. It's beyond the scope of this answer to discuss what this joint sin might be, but feel free to ask that question as a separate post if you wish.</p>\n<p>To further the point that the Bible views morality and wisdom/understanding as intrinsic to animals is the fact that God not only feels compelled to destroy animal life with man, God also establishes a <strong>covenant with animals</strong> and men as <em>equal parties</em> which is something most commentaries gloss over. We know they are being treated as equal parties because covenants are agreed upon with words and then a physical representation is made. Think the big rock for the covenant with Jacob and Lavan, the copies of the stones of the ten commandments. Usually each party gets either their own copy or has access to the physical representation of the covenant. Both Laban and Jacob can go back to the stone pillar, we hold both copies of the 10 commandments (one set for us the other for God) but we place them in the holy of holies where God resides. In the case of this covenant the rainbow is given which is in heaven, but also visible to man and animals.</p>\n<p>Genesis 6:11-13, 17-22</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יא  וַתִּשָּׁחֵת הָאָרֶץ, לִפְנֵי הָאֱלֹהִים; וַתִּמָּלֵא הָאָרֶץ,\nחָמָס.    11 And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was\nfilled with violence. יב  וַיַּרְא אֱלֹהִים אֶת-הָאָרֶץ, וְהִנֵּה\nנִשְׁחָתָה:  כִּי-הִשְׁחִית כָּל-בָּשָׂר אֶת-דַּרְכּוֹ, עַל-הָאָרֶץ.\n{ס}   12 And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt; for all\nflesh had corrupted their way upon the earth. {S} יג  וַיֹּאמֶר\nאֱלֹהִים לְנֹחַ, קֵץ כָּל-בָּשָׂר בָּא לְפָנַי--כִּי-מָלְאָה הָאָרֶץ\nחָמָס, מִפְּנֵיהֶם; וְהִנְנִי מַשְׁחִיתָם, אֶת-הָאָרֶץ.   13 And God\nsaid unto Noah: 'The end of all flesh is come before Me; for the earth\nis filled with violence through them; and, behold, I will destroy them\nwith the earth....... יז  וַאֲנִי, הִנְנִי מֵבִיא אֶת-הַמַּבּוּל מַיִם\nעַל-הָאָרֶץ, לְשַׁחֵת כָּל-בָּשָׂר אֲשֶׁר-בּוֹ רוּחַ חַיִּים, מִתַּחַת\nהַשָּׁמָיִם:  כֹּל אֲשֶׁר-בָּאָרֶץ, יִגְוָע.  17 And I, behold, I do\nbring the flood of waters upon the earth, to destroy all flesh,\nwherein is the breath of life, from under heaven; every thing that is\nin the earth shall perish. יח  וַהֲקִמֹתִי אֶת-בְּרִיתִי, אִתָּךְ;\nוּבָאתָ, אֶל-הַתֵּבָה--אַתָּה, וּבָנֶיךָ וְאִשְׁתְּךָ וּנְשֵׁי-בָנֶיךָ\nאִתָּךְ.  18 But I will establish My covenant with thee; and thou\nshalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy\nsons' wives with thee. יט  וּמִכָּל-הָחַי מִכָּל-בָּשָׂר שְׁנַיִם\nמִכֹּל, תָּבִיא אֶל-הַתֵּבָה--לְהַחֲיֹת אִתָּךְ:  זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה,\nיִהְיוּ.  19 And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort\nshalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee; they\nshall be male and female. כ  מֵהָעוֹף לְמִינֵהוּ, וּמִן-הַבְּהֵמָה\nלְמִינָהּ, מִכֹּל רֶמֶשׂ הָאֲדָמָה, לְמִינֵהוּ--שְׁנַיִם מִכֹּל\nיָבֹאוּ אֵלֶיךָ, לְהַחֲיוֹת.  20 Of the fowl after their kind, and of\nthe cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground\nafter its kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them\nalive. כא  וְאַתָּה קַח-לְךָ, מִכָּל-מַאֲכָל אֲשֶׁר יֵאָכֵל,\nוְאָסַפְתָּ, אֵלֶיךָ; וְהָיָה לְךָ וְלָהֶם, לְאָכְלָה.    21 And take\nthou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee; and\nit shall be for food for thee, and for them.' כב  וַיַּעַשׂ, נֹחַ:\nכְּכֹל אֲשֶׁר צִוָּה אֹתוֹ, אֱלֹהִים--כֵּן עָשָׂה.    22 Thus did Noah;\naccording to all that God commanded him, so did he.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Genesis 9:9-10</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ט  וַאֲנִי, הִנְנִי מֵקִים אֶת-בְּרִיתִי אִתְּכֶם, וְאֶת-זַרְעֲכֶם,\nאַחֲרֵיכֶם.   9 'As for Me, behold, I establish My covenant with you,\nand with your seed after you; י  וְאֵת כָּל-נֶפֶשׁ הַחַיָּה אֲשֶׁר\nאִתְּכֶם, בָּעוֹף בַּבְּהֵמָה וּבְכָל-חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ אִתְּכֶם; מִכֹּל\nיֹצְאֵי הַתֵּבָה, לְכֹל חַיַּת הָאָרֶץ.   10 and with every living\ncreature that is with you, the fowl, the cattle, and every beast of\nthe earth with you; of all that go out of the ark, even every beast of\nthe earth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So just to recap, God seems to want to destroy all flesh because all flesh is corrupt. And for those that haven't become corrupted (both man and animal), God is going to save them AND establish a covenant with both man and animal kind. So without getting into the detail of just how much morality or wisdom the animal kingdom has, the Bible takes for granted that both exist naturally in animals to such an extent that animals can be judged as sinners worthy of the death penalty, or redeemed and have covenants established with them.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In regards to the basic question,  the Ben Yohada on that Gemara mentions in passing that these traits are natural to these species</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונמצא דלמדין צניעות משני מדות טבעיות שבו</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How are humans that were formed \"from dust\" different from animals that were formed \"from earth\"?\n\n## Frage\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וַיִּיצֶר ה\"א אֶת־הָאָדָם עָפָר מִן־הָאֲדָמָה\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Genesis.2.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis.2.7</a><br />\n\"וַיִּצֶר ה\"א מִן־הָאֲדָמָה כָּל־חַיַּת הַשָּׂדֶה...\" ibid. 19</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to Rashi and others, Adam was formed from dust, while animals were formed from the earth.</p>\n<p>What does this difference mean and how is this difference is manifested in reality?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Refer to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Sforno_on_Genesis.2.7.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sforno</a> there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וייצר ה' אלהים אמנם להוית בעלי חיים לא הספיק זה אבל היתה יצירת היוצר ית' על אופנים מתחלפים וזה כי ליצירת האדם בירר עפר מן האדמה חלק נכבד ממנה:</p>\n<p>וייצר ה' אלוקים, the animals had not rated involvement of both attributes of G-d in their creation and formation. Not only that, but in order to create man G-d had used עפר מן האדמה, the choicest of the dust available on earth. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus we see that the creation of man differed to the animals in that Hashem 'took pains' (kviyachol) to create Adam from the choicest of dust.</p>\n<p>Indeed, following on from your comment, it is worth noting the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=HaKtav_VeHaKabalah%2C_Genesis.2.7.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HaKsav VeHakabalah</a> which does indeed note a physiological element to this specific use of dust. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עפר מן האדמה. עפר הוא עפר תיחוח, אדמה היא אדמת סלע הקשה, ולפי שיצר אותו בשר ועצמות והוא עיקר בנין האדם, כי הגידים הם לחבור האברים, והעור לסככו, לכן יצר הבשר מן עפר תיחוח, והעצמות מן האדמה הקשה....</p>\n<p>Dust of the earth - עפר is crushed/loose earth, whilst אדמה is hard rock soil, and since He (Hashem) created flesh and bones, this is the essence of human structure. Because the sinews connect to the limbs, and the skin shield/cover it. Therefore, he created the flesh from the loose earth and the bones from hard ground....</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, if we return to the initial point that Adam was created from the choicest earth and that is the reason for the phraseology of \"עפר מן האדמה\" - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.2.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.2.7.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> helps to underline this difference between man and animals.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>עפר מן האדמה, זכר העפר אע\"פ שארבע היסודות היו מעורבות בו, זכר העפר לפי שהוא עיקר היצירה בנבראי היבשה, ובנבראי המים הם העיקר, אע\"פ שהם משרר היסודות ג\"כ ולפיכך חיותם במים; ובעוף האויר הוא עיקר יסודו לפיכך הוא עף באויר. ואמר שיצר את האדם עפר כלומר צוה שיעשה גולם אחד מזה משאר הגלמים וצורת איבריו עפר מוגבל והיה אותו הגולם ברצון האל בשר עצמות וגידים, ואמר מן האדמה כלומר מן המשובח שבה, כי גוף האדם הוא תואר נקי משאר ב\"ח, וצורתו השלמה בצורות, לפיכך הוא הולך בקומה זקופה.</strong> וכתב החכם ר' יוסף בן צדיק כי זה לפי שהחמר שלו זך ודק בין שאר הגופים כמו שאנו רואים שמן הנר בעודו זך תעלה השלהבת ממנו על קו יושר לזכות השמן, ואם לא יהיה זך אלא עכור תהיה השלהבת עולה ממנו מעוותת ולא תלך על קו יושר. והעילה האחרת שהאדם צומח מן השמים, כלומ' שכל צמח צומח מעקרו ונהיה העיקר בזה ממול השמי' לפיכך אנו צומחים מן השמים, ומפני זה נקרא אדם פרי מהופך.</p>\n<p>עפר מן האדמה, <strong>the Torah here mentions only one of the four raw materials man is made of, seeing it is the predominant one, at least quantitatively, in all land based living creatures as opposed to the creatures whose habitat is the water, whose predominant raw material is the water. In the case of the birds, air is the quantitatively predominant raw material. This fact enables the birds to fly in the air. Mention of the raw material עפר means that this raw material distinguishes man, is the most visible, the result of G’d’s directive to earth to bring forth a lifeless human being beautifully shaped, functional, awaiting only the soul G’d would insert to turn it into a living creature. מן האדמה, the prefix ה was used here to let us know that only the choicest earth was employed in constructing this golem. Man’s body is superior to the bodies of the other mammals that had also been produced by primarily using earth as their raw material. Proof that this claim is correct is the fact that man alone of all the mammals on earth walks upright.</strong> The scholar Rabbi Yoseph ben Tzadik (in a book called olam hakatan) writes that we can understand this by comparing pure oil and impure oil respectively supplying a wick with its fuel. When pure oil is used, the flame rises perpendicularly, not flickering from one side to another, whereas when impure, insufficiently refined oil is used, the flame does not rise in an uninterrupted upward motion. Similarly, the fact that man walks upright is a reflection of the purity of the raw material used in his composition. An additional reason why man is able to walk upright is the fact that he contains the soul whose origin is in heaven. This fact would reflect that whatever grows reflects its origin in the manner in which it grows. Seeing that man’s head is his most important part, it being higher than the rest of his body, it is no more than natural that he would walk in a manner which illustrates the superior importance of his head, i.e. walking upright, head held high. By holding his head high, he symbolically points toward heaven, his origin. (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rashi on that verse states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עפר מן האדמה. צָבַר עֲפְרוֹ מִכָּל הָאֲדָמָה מֵאַרְבַּע רוּחוֹת, שֶׁכָּל מָקוֹם שֶׁיָּמוּת שָׁם תְּהֵא קוֹלַטְתּוֹ לִקְבוּרָה. דָּ\"אַ נָטַל עֲפָרוֹ מִמָּקוֹם שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר בּוֹ מִזְבַּח אֲדָמָה תַּעֲשֶׂה לִּי (שמות כ'), הַלְוַאי תִּהְיֶה לוֹ כַפָּרָה וְיוּכַל לַעֲמֹד: עפר מן האדמה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>DUST OF THE EARTH — He gathered his dust (i. e. that from which he was made) from the entire earth — from its four corners — in order that wherever he might die, it should receive him for burial (Midrash Tanchuma, Pekudei 3). Another explanation: He took his dust from that spot on which the Holy Temple with the altar of atonement was in later timesto be built of which it is said, (Exodus 20:24) “An altar of earth thou shalt make for Me” saying, “Would that this sacred earth may be an expiation for him so that he may be able to endure” (Genesis Rabbah 14:8).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Sifsei Chachamim says Rashi was bothered by this exact question! Why does it add a word of dust before the word of earth (like by animals where it only says earth). He proposes that this is what Rashi means to answer, that the extra word implies that he was gathered from all 4 corners of the earth etc.:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>צבר עפרו כו'. דאל\"כ עפר מן האדמה ל\"ל בחד סגי אבל קשה דהל\"ל מכל הארץ לכך אמר ד\"א וכו' ולד\"א קשה הל\"ל מאדמה מלת מן ל\"ל לכך פי' מד' רוחות. [מהרש\"ל]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He gathered dust... [Rashi knows this] because if not, why does it say, “Dust from the ground?” One term is sufficient! But this explanation raises a difficulty: It should say, “From all the earth.” Thus Rashi offers the other explanation. And the other explanation also raises a difficulty: It should say: “מֵאדמה”. Why the word מִן? Thus Rashi offered the first explanation, “From all four corners.” (Maharshal)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In his next piece he addresses why animals didn't need to be gathered from all 4 corners (thereby not having the extra word of dust)  even though they're also buried.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קולטתו לקבורה. ועי\"ל לתרץ הקושיא הלא גם הבהמה נקברת אע\"פ שלא נצבר עפרה אלא רוצה לומר קולטת ושמורה בתוכה עד תחיית המתים. [דבק טוב]:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Will receive him for burial. This raises a difficulty: Animals are received for burial, although their dust was never gathered! Rather, Rashi is saying that the earth receives and guards man’s body within it until the dead will be resurrected (Devek Tov).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Jungians do not understand it as divination but a kind of revealing of the unconscious. Any thoughts as to whether this falls under the issur of magic?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Unfortunately, I did not find any contemporary rabbinic literature that addresses this specific activity (should I come across something, I will update accordingly). That said, we are left with trying to ascertain whether the activity in its basic contours has already been described in halakhah.</p>\n<p>The Rambam describes the prohibition against <em>nihush</em> as follows (H. AZ 11:4):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין מנחשין כגויים, שנאמר \"לא תנחשו\" (ויקרא יט,כו).  כיצד הוא הניחוש:\nכגון אלו שאומרין הואיל ונפלה פיתי מפי, או נפל מקלי מידי, איני הולך\nלמקום פלוני היום, שאם אלך אין חפציי נעשין; הואיל ועבר שועל מימיני,\nאיני יוצא מפתח ביתי היום, שאם יצאתי, יפגעני אדם רמאי.  וכן אלו ששומעין\nצפצוף העופות ואומרין יהיה כך ולא יהיה כך, טוב לעשות דבר פלוני ורע\nלעשות דבר פלוני.  וכן אלו שאומרין שחוט תרנגול זה שקרא ערבית, שחוט\nתרנגולת זו שקראת כמו תרנגול.  <strong>וכן המשים לעצמו סימנים, אם יארע לי כך\nוכך אעשה דבר פלוני, ואם לא יארע לא אעשה</strong>, כאליעזר עבד אברהם.  וכל כיוצא\nבדברים האלו, הכול אסור; וכל העושה מעשה מפני דבר מדברים אלו, לוקה.</p>\n<p>It is forbidden to practice <em>nihush</em> as the gentiles do, as [Leviticus\n19:26] states: \"Do not act as a soothsayer.\" What is meant by a\nsoothsayer? For example, those who say: Since my piece of bread fell\nout of my mouth, or my staff fell from my hand, I will not travel to\nthis place today, since if I were to go I would not be able to\naccomplish my desires. Since a fox passed on my right side, I will not\ngo out of my door today, since if I were to go out I would meet a\ndeceiver. Similarly, [this category includes] those who hear the\nchirping of a bird and say: This will happen or this will not happen;\nit is beneficial to do this or it is detrimental to do this. [Also, it\nincludes] those who say: Slaughter this rooster that crowed like a\nraven; slaughter this hen that crowed like a rooster. <strong>Similarly, a\nperson who sets up <em>simanim</em> for himself; e.g., if this and this\nhappens, I will do this. If it will not happen, I will not do it</strong>, as\nEliezer, the servant of Abraham did, and the things of the like - all\nthis is forbidden. Anyone who does one of these things because of such\nomens is [liable for] lashes.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In \"I Ching The Oracle A Practical Guide to the Book of Changes\", the author explains (p. 77):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The I Ching was first used for divining on matters of political\nimportance, the outcome of battles, and marriage prospects. These\nearly forms of divination utilized yarrow stalks, which were counted\nand arranged in numerologically significant groupings. Both the\npredecessor Shang dynasty oracle bone divination and the I Ching began\nwith prayers to the spirits. The request would be purposefully stated\nin the prayer. Then a sacrifice or offering was often presented to the\nspirit, though not always. Finally, the oracle reading was performed.\nElucidating the cryptic oracle messages was a challenge then as it is\na challenge today.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems the I Ching in all its various iterations, going back to its ancient roots, follows the same basic trajectory:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>There is some perceived challenge on the horizon in the imminent future and the proper course of action is uncertain (e.g. war strategy, decisions concerning marriage, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A ritual is performed involving some prop: drawing yarrow stalks and arranging them according to a procedure that involves chance, poking a turtle shell with a hot poker so that cracks are produced, tossing/arranging coins with pre-designated meanings, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Interpreting the results: number/arrangement of stalks, coins, cracks in the shell, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Making a decision about #1 by light of #3.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>IMHO, this is precisely what the Rambam describes as being prohibited, namely:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>המשים לעצמו סימנים, אם יארע לי כך וכך אעשה דבר פלוני, ואם לא יארע לא\nאעשה -</p>\n<p>a person who sets up <em>simanim</em> for himself; e.g. if this and this\nhappens, I will do this. If it not happen, I will not do it.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An I Ching practitioner has a decision to make and sets up props, he tells himself that based on the outcome of a, b, c, he will choose to engage/disengage in x, y, z behavior... i.e. it will be a siman to him, a sign, about how to proceed.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I would argue that I-Ching is forbidden as being in violation of the biblical prohibition against <em>nihush</em>.</p>\n<p>As for the attestation that it is used by Jungian analysts, it is well known that Jung dabbled in the occult and endorsed pseudo-scientific beliefs not widely accepted in the contemporary world of psychology. I'm not saying that Jungian analysis ought be chucked altogether, but his endorsement of a particular activity doesn't mean it gets an automatic hekhsher (in either halakhah or psychology).</p>\n<p>I think that even in a psycho-analytic context, it is drawing very close to if not over a line. The least controversial way I can conceive of it being utilized is as a sort of Rorschach inkblot test, or something akin to dream analysis. That is to say, that if one simply uses it as a tool to understand the self, i.e. analyzing one's own analysis of the I-Ching results in order to better understand their own unconscious forces there may perhaps be room for leniency. However, this newfound self knowledge and consequent action taking can mistakenly give a person the impression over time that there is something outside the self at play and that one is resorting to or petitioning (indeed this may have been Jung's error in seeing it as evidence of his theory of synchronicity). When I-Ching becomes a repeated and first resort in the psycho-analytic process, rather than other more conventional methods, I think it must be questioned whether one has lapsed into overt <em>nihush</em>, as the practice seems to have been classically utilized.</p>\n<p>In the aforementioned proposed psycho-analytic process, in which context it <em>may</em> not be <em>nihush</em>, it is still possible that it involves <em>huqath ha-goyim</em> (i.e. the prohibition against emulating gentile practices). In which case, I think there may be a practical distinction to be made between the pursuit of self-knowledge/enlightenment (in which case even if it is not <em>nihush</em> it might still be prohibited as <em>huqath ha-goyim</em>) and cases more therapeutic/<em>refuah</em>-based in nature (in which case there <em>may</em> be room for leniency).</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I would argue that I-Ching is generally prohibited as <em>nihush</em>, and that within a psycho-analytic context, the lines easily blur and it might still be prohibited as <em>huqath ha-goy</em>, context depending.</p>\n<p>As with all matters, if this is a practical issue for anyone, it is highly advised that one consult with a poseq competent in such issues.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>I think the question can be answered when broken down into parts:\nYou'd be hard pressed to call it divination when even its own users do not consider it to be that. However, I think therefore that the permissibility of  this method simply depends on what the <em>perceived</em> mechanism of the process is.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If it is supernatural, then it is either following omens, which is forbidden, or belief in a source of power other than G-d and is avoda zarah (assur).</li>\n<li>But if it's assumed to be natural, although perhaps the mechanism is not well understood, then it is no different than any other natural effect that has not yet been explained. Just because we don't know how it works doesn't mean that it is supernatural! (mutar)</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if perhaps it is known to not really work, but is done as a religious/societal ritual (or the like), then it would likely be assur as chukas hagoyim; doing actions that have no rationale other then to fit in with the other nations.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, these 3 approaches miss one instance; if it actually works through supernatural means. Should it do that, then yeah; it's kishuf, but considering that kishuf is considered to be no longer in this world, that wouldn't seem like a possibility.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>As you've phrased the question namely that it involves an action of throwing sticks etc. it's divination.</p>\n<p>However when studied and read as a study of dynamics and relations it's neutral.  For example, Tai (泰 pervading peace), <a href=\"https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/I_Ching_oracle#Inner_Peace_(Pervading)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">three broken lines above three solid lines</a>, is an Earth trigram on top of the Heaven trigram (water), but the grams are read bottom up, so this is Heaven above Earth.  Viewed another way, the water is settled, under earth, and there is peace.  One may choose to study this hexagram or any of the 63 others without throwing sticks etc.</p>\n<p>So it <em>can</em> be learned as a science, a way of observation, a way to peace, which is the essence of Dao, the Daoist way that the Yi Jing represents.</p>\n<p>You may take somewhat of a parallel, l'havdil, with Kabbalah.  Practical kabbalah (actions, prayers or meditations to specifically effect something forcefully) are frowned upon and viewed as close to magic (because they detract from the simplicity and essence of Emunah, faith and trust in Hashem), while theoretical kabbalah (learning, reading) and meditative kabbalah are good or at least more widely accepted.</p>\n\n\n",

This is in contrast to certain atheistic viewpoints, in which the punishment is what makes something a crime.

All of this is only accepted if your eyes have actually seen all the great deeds that Hashem did, and if so, you know all of this from the perspective of knowledge.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Malbim is essentially saying that if a person has seen firsthand the wondrous deeds of Hashem they know with absolute certainty about the Divine quality of Hashem's Torah and mitzvos. However, the next generation lacked this clarity as they were never zoche to see such wonders. This is why the onus is more on the parents.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>[Chabad.org]on <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9975/showrashi/true#v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eikev 11:2</a> translates this as</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And you shall know this day; that [I speak] not with your children,\nwho did not know and who did not see the chastisement of the Lord,\nyour God, His greatness, His mighty hand, and His outstretched arm,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong> says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>And you shall know this day:</strong> Set your attention to know, understand, and accept my reproof.</p>\n<p><strong>that not with your children:</strong> am I now speaking, who would be able to say, “We did not know or see all this.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus it does not mean that the children are not required to love Hashem, but that Moshe is speaking directly to those who saw the miracles of Hashem and heard the revelation at Sinai.</p>\n<p>Rav Hirsch explains that 11:1 applies to future generations and 11:2 is referring to the current generation who actually saw the miracles and the revelation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>היום is probably in contrast to the כל הימים of the previous verse.\nThe mission of guarding, keeping the Torah applies to all generations\nof sll time.

This is not special to the Jews, there's no reason to assume that gentile souls are unfamiliar with God before coming down to Earth (and they aren't having any traumatic experiences with angels).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Elchanan Wasserman asks a similar question in Kovetz Ma'amarim 1.</p>\n<p>He writes that just by looking around the world in a simple manner, one is aware that G-d created the world and one does not need to be convinced by complicated philosophical arguments.\nHe brings evidence to this approach from the fact that the Rambam counts belief in God as one of the six hundred and thirteen commandments. Since every thirteen-year-old Jewish boy and twelve-year-old Jewish girl is obligated in this commandment, it is clear that belief in God does not require intense philosophical training or advanced intellectual ability. Additionally, the Halakha obligates every gentile to believe in God and fulfill the seven Noahide commandments, including even those whose lifestyle does not allow for academic achievement or intellectual advancement. This expectation would be unjust if belief in God is not easily attained by any normal human being.</p>\n<p>R. Elchonon asks if it is a basic fact how can anyone honestly doubt the existence of God?</p>\n<p>He answers that in fact it is impossible to honestly doubt God’s existence. Rather, R. Elchanan finds the explanation for the phenomenon of disbelief in the Torah’s prohibition of bribery. The Torah, when forbidding the acceptance of bribes, explains that “you shall not take bribes, for bribes blind the eyes of the discerning” (Devarim 16:19). Bribery has the power to corrupt the intellect and prevent one from thinking logically, as evidenced by the testimony of the Torah and the many stories of Talmudic sages whose judgment was biased by a whiff of bribery. If a small sum of money has the power to corrupt our reasoning, then certainly the bribe offered by the evil inclination – i.e. that if we deny God’s existence then we can then indulge our passions without restraint – has the power to blind us to the truth and pervert our intellect to the extent that we can deny the undeniable fact of God’s existence. The sole explanation for disbelief is that it stems from a moral failing. One who is beholden to his desires will experience a strong subconscious bias to reach a conclusion that justifies his lifestyle, and will therefore conclude, against all logic, that God does not exist.</p>\n<p>@DoubleAA Look at the Chovos Halvovos 1:6 who brings a parable to explain the absurdity of atheists.<br />\nOnce a rabbi met with a king. The king asked him the question, “How do you know of the existence of the Creator?” The Rabbi asked the king to leave the room. On the table was a quill, an inkwell and some paper. While the king was out of the room, the rabbi wrote a beautiful poem on the paper. When the king returned he noticed the poem and was amazed at its poetic style. The ink was still wet and the king praised the rabbi for writing such a beautiful poem. The Rabbi replied that he had not written the poem, rather, he had taken the inkwell, poured it onto the paper and the letters had formed themselves.</p>\n<p>The king ridiculed such a suggestion saying that it was impossible for the ink to arrange itself into a single letter, let alone a word, let alone a sentence, and certainly not into a beautiful poem! The rabbi replied, “There is your answer. If the ink can't form a poem without the hand of a poet, then certainly the world, which is infinitely more complex than the poem, could not possibly form itself without the hand of a Master Creator!”</p>\n\n\n",

However, while those two were kohanim, the passage states Paltiya was 'of Yisrael' or 'one of the Jews' (per Patshegen Haketav). <strong>Edit:</strong> In his commentary on Esther \"Yonah Dedahava\", Rabbi Elchanan Gibli brings a version of the Targum that says Paltiya was a kohen. I have no idea which version is more accurate.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>As pcoz noted in a comment, פְּלַטְיָהוּ בֶּן בְּנָיָהוּ is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.11.1?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yechezkel 11:1</a> and :13, and in the former place he's described as one of שָׂרֵי הָעָם, the noblemen/princes of the people. So it's likely that the Targum is referring to him, the more so since the Gemara, <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=20&daf=72b&format=pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 72b</a>, also has him intervening personally with Nevuchadnetzar in a different connection.</p>\n<p>Now, one problem with that, which the OP mentioned in a comment, is that Yechezkel there describes seeing his death, and this was several years before the destruction of the first Beis Hamikdash. However, the Gemara there tells of Pelatiah's intervention with Nevuchadnetzar after the Destruction and the exile, about where the Jewish exiles vs. their slaves should be settled. Accordingly, Yechezkel is seeing prophetically Pelatiah's future death at an early age, and cries out about it. (The Gemara there cites two opinions why he cried out - the second is that Pelatiah was wicked and didn't deserve a peaceful death - but not necessarily does that opinion have to disagree about the timing of his death, and anyway the Targum might simply be following one opinion.)</p>\n<p>Another problem is his patronymic, since in Yechezkel he's called the son of Benayah(u), while the Targum identifies him as the son of Yehoyada. It's plausible, as the OP suggested, that the Targum is thinking of Benayahu not as his father but as his ancestor, and identifying him with the Benayahu ben Yehoyada who was King Shlomo's general (or with an otherwise unrecorded son or descendant of Yehoyada the Kohen Gadol). That could still fit with the Targum calling him חַד מִיִּשְׂרָאֵל, one of Yisrael, since (a) that might refer to his national affiliation rather than his tribal one, (b) he might have been descended from Benayahu in the maternal line (and still been distinguished for that), or (c) the version quoted in the OP, that Pelatiah was a kohen, is in fact the correct one.</p>\n<p>(Yet another possibility, perhaps, is that Targum Sheni assumes that Benayahu ben Yehoyada wasn't a kohen at all. It is true that he is so called in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.27.5?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Chronicles 27:5</a>, and the commentaries there and to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.2.25?lang=he&with=Commentary&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 2:25</a> take that literally (and have to contend with how, as a kohen, he was allowed to kill Adoniyahu and others), but perhaps the author of Targum assumed that כהן can mean a high-ranking minister, as in וּבְנֵי דָוִד כֹּהֲנִים הָיוּ of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.8.18?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">II Samuel 8:18</a>.)</p>\n\n\n",

As the Talmud in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Hosea.1.2?lang=bi&p2=Pesachim.87a.13-87b.5&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 87</a> put it (emphasis mine):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"<strong>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Hosea: Your sons, the Jewish people, have sinned. Hosea should have said to God in response: But they are Your sons</strong>; they are the sons of Your beloved ones, the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Extend Your mercy over them. N<strong>ot only did he fail to say that, but instead he said before Him</strong>: Master of the Universe, the entire world is Yours; <strong>since Israel has sinned, exchange them for another nation</strong>. <strong>The Holy One, Blessed be He, said: What shall I do to this Elder who does not know how to defend Israel?</strong> <strong>I will say to him: Go and take a prostitute and bear for yourself children of prostitution. And after that I will say to him: Send her away from before you.</strong> If he is able to send her away, I will also send away the Jewish people. This deliberation provides the background of the opening prophecy in Hosea, as it is stated: “The Lord said to Hosea: Go, take for yourself a wife of prostitution and children of prostitution”...After two sons and one daughter had been born to him, the Holy One, Blessed be He, said to Hosea: Shouldn’t you have learned from the example of your master Moses, who, once I spoke with him, separated from his wife? You too, separate yourself from your wife. <strong>He said to Him: Master of the Universe, I have sons from her and I am unable to dismiss her or to divorce her. In response to Hosea’s show of loyalty to his family, the Holy One, Blessed be He, rebuked him and said to him: Just as you, whose wife is a prostitute and your children from her are children of prostitution, and you do not even know if they are yours or if they are children of other men, despite this, you are still attached to them and will not forsake them, so too, I am still attached to the Jewish people, who are My sons</strong>, the sons of My faithful who withstood ordeals, the sons of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They are so special that they are one of the four acquisitions that I acquired in My world.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We find, therefore, that Hashem came to explain to Hoshea why, despite being angry at Yisrael's betrayal, He still keeps them as His nation. That's why in the end of Hoshea 2, the names are reversed:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And the earth shall respond With new grain and wine and oil, And they shall respond to Jezreel. I will sow her in the land as My own; And take Lo-ruhamah back in favor; And I will say to Lo-ammi, “You are My people,” [Ami atah in Hebrew] And he will respond, “[You are] my God.”\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Hosea.2.24-25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2:24-25</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I wrote in the comments, Yechezkel uses the terms \"Yisrael\" and \"Yehudah\" almost interchangeably. That's why we find that when the elders of the community came to sit before him, sometimes they are called \"elders of Yisrael\" (for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.20.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">20:1</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.14.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">14:1</a>) and sometimes \"elders of Yehudah\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.8.1?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:1</a>). And when he sees the elders of those that remained in Judea in the time of Tzidkiyahu, he refers to them as \"the elders of the House of Yisrael\" (for example, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezekiel.8.11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:11</a>). And in the Vision of the Dry Bones, he then sees them gaining new life - so it can't be that they were really cut off completely.</p>\n<p>With that said, there are some sources that bear witness to that fact that some of the descendants of the Ten Tribes were still around during the Second Temple period:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Rabbi Prof. Shmuel Klein points out in Eretz Hagalil (Land of the Galilee), pg. 2, that there's evidence in Tanach that not the whole of the Kingdom of Yisrael was exiled by the Assyrians.

The theory in short is that since it says in Chronicles 1:9:3 that people of Efraim and Menashe came to live in Yerushalayim after Cyrus's proclamation, and a<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.2.64?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&p2=Seder_Olam_Rabbah.29.2&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">s there's a discrepancy between the total number of returnees and the individual numbers of each household that returned</a>, it seems there's evidence that people from the Ten Tribes really did return, but were rejected by the people from the Kingdom of Yehudah. He ties to this certain prophecies in Zechariah that, according to him, can only be explained as referring to people from other tribes. The reason the people were rejected by the Judeans was because: a. The Judeans were proud and looked down upon these people. b. These people, having lived separate from the Judeans for about 150 years, had their Judaism develop in a different direction than that of the Judeans. This led to harsh arguments about how to worship Hashem in Yerushalayim. Tempers flared, and eventually Zechariah decided to kick them out, as these people weren't willing to submit to the Judean halacha. They were told to go live in their ancestral homes in northern Yisrael. Samaria was taken by the Samaritans (Cuthites and other nations), and so they headed further north to the Galiliee, which was part of the Aram-Damascus Persian province. They settled there and vowed revenge against the Judeans that they believed had wronged them, thus forming \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_Document\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Damascus Covenant</a>\". The early layers of the text of the covenant are practically biblical in style - because these people were from the last years of the Tanach.</sub></p>\n<p><sub>(I personally think this theory is way too wild. For one, it paints the picture of Zechariah basically being a big bully. There are other reasons, too, but I won't get into that).</sub></p>\n\n\n",

In this regard, the red wine helps serve as a reminder of this process.</p>\n<p>The starting point is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.472.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch OC 472:11</a> where it writes expressly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מצוה לחזור אחר יין אדום (אם אין הלבן משובח ממנו) (טור):</p>\n<p>It's a mitzvah to seek red wine (if the white wine is not better) [Tur].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kitzur_Shulchan_Arukh.118.1?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitzur Shulchan Aruch 118:1</a> writes further the reason why:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יְהַדֵּר אַחַר יַיִן יָפֶה לְמִצְוֹת אַרְבָּעָה כּוֹסוֹת. וְאִם יֵשׁ בַּנִּמְצָא יַיִן אָדֹם יָפֶה כְּמוֹ הַלָּבָן, וְגַם הוּא כָּשֵׁר כְּמוֹ הַלָּבָן, מִצְוָה בּוֹ יוֹתֵר מִבַּלָּבָן, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר, אַל תֵּרֶא יַיִן כִּי יִתְאַדָּם, מַשְׁמַע שֶׁחֲשִׁיבוּתוֹ שֶׁל יַיִן הוּא כְּשֶׁהוּא אָדֹם. וְעוֹד, <strong>לְפִי שֶׁיֵּשׁ בּוֹ זֵכֶר לְדָּם, שֶׁהָיָה פַּרְעֹה שׁוֹחֵט יַלְדֵי בְּנֵי יִשְֹרָאֵל.</strong> וּבִמְדִינוֹת שֶׁהָאֻמּוֹת טִפְּשִׁים וּסְכָלִים לְהַעֲלִיל עֲלִילוֹת שְׁקָרִים, נִמְנְעוּ מִלִּקַּח יַיִן אָדֹם לְפֶּסַח (תעב).</p>\n<p>You should do your best to obtain choice wine to perform the mitzvah of drinking the Four Cups. If red wine is available, that is, of the same quality as white wine, and its kashrus is as reliable as white wine, the red wine is preferred for the Four Cups, for it is said, \"Look not after wine when it is red,\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.23.31?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 23:31</a>) indicating that wine is most desirable, when it is red. <strong>In addition, because it reminds us of the blood, which flowed, when Pharaoh slaughtered innocent Jewish children</strong>. In backward and ignorant countries, where people, make slanderous accusations, Jews refrain from using red wine on Pesach. (Sefaria translation my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This point about the slaughtered children is also mentioned in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14580&st=&pgnum=120&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr Zaruah, Vol. II, Siman 256</a> (Left column, bottom quarter) and he adds two other symbolic cases of blood. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יין אדום זכר לדבר שהיה פרעה שוחט תינוקות כשנצטרע <strong>ועוד זכר לדם פסח ולדם מילה</strong></p>\n<p>Red wine as a remembrance for Pharoah who slaughtered the babies (and bathed in their blood) when he was suffering with leprosy. <strong>And furthermore, it is a remembrance for the blood of the Korban Pesach (the Paschal Lamb) and the blood of milah (circumcision)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, it is also worth noting the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=41248&st=&pgnum=293&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Megadim, OC, Eishel Avraham 472:13</a> who writes that when using wine it should be red as it resembles blood and is a <strong>remembrance of the first plague of blood</strong>, thus symbolically appropriate for the evening, in the same way that Charoses is a remembrance to the cement/clay that the Jews used.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather, say that the discussion concerns a case of a courtyard that stands to be rented out, and the man squatting there would have rented other living quarters.

    "content": "# Is interfaith dialogue with Karaites permitted?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>R' Joseph Soloveitchik famously <a href=\"https://storage.ning.com/topology/rest/1.0/file/get/2057599423?profile=original\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">objects</a> to interfaith dialogue. @mbloch provides a thorough <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/71279/17821\">examination</a> of the halachic issues surrounding interfaith dialogue.</p>\n<p>My question is, while this obviously applies to Jewish-Christian dialogue, does this apply to Rabbinic Judaism-Karaite Judaism? On the one hand, the opinions written can be understood as applying to those who believe in a different god, while Karaite Judaism ostensibly believes in the same Hashem; on the other hand, R' Soloveitchik writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We are, therefore, opposed to any public debate, dialogue or symposium concerning the doctrinal, dogmatic or ritual aspects of our faith vis a vis “similar” aspects of another faith community. We believe in and are committed to our Maker in a specific manner and we will not question, defend, offer apologies, analyze or rationalize our faith in dialogues centered about these “private” topics which express our personal relationship to the God of Israel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...suggesting that, due to its rejection of the Oral Law, the Karaite community constitutes \"another faith community\" and therefore cannot be engaged with in dialogue.</p>\n<p>(Note: I added the <code>haskkafah-philosophy</code> tag as well because this question does contain a component of hashkafah as well as the pure halchachic discussion.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Perhaps we can apply Rambam's approach in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1181854/jewish/Mamrim-Chapter-3.htm#v3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Mamrim 3:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בַּמֶּה דְּבָרִים אֲמוּרִים בְּאִישׁ שֶׁכָּפַר בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה בְּמַחֲשַׁבְתּוֹ וּבִדְבָרִים שֶׁנִּרְאוּ לוֹ. וְהָלַךְ אַחַר דַּעְתּוֹ הַקַּלָּה וְאַחַר שְׁרִירוּת לִבּוֹ וְכוֹפֵר בַּתּוֹרָה שֶׁבְּעַל פֶּה תְּחִלָּה כְּצָדוֹק וּבַיְתּוֹס וְכֵן כָּל הַתּוֹעִים אַחֲרָיו. <strong>אֲבָל בְּנֵי הַתּוֹעִים הָאֵלֶּה וּבְנֵי בְּנֵיהֶם שֶׁהִדִּיחוּ אוֹתָם אֲבוֹתָם וְנוֹלְדוּ בֵּין הַקָּרָאִים וְגִדְּלוּ אוֹתָם עַל דַּעְתָּם. הֲרֵי הוּא כְּתִינוֹק שֶׁנִּשְׁבָּה בֵּינֵיהֶם</strong> וְגִדְּלוּהוּ וְאֵינוֹ זָרִיז לֶאֱחֹז בְּדַרְכֵי הַמִּצְוֹת שֶׁהֲרֵי הוּא כְּאָנוּס וְאַף עַל פִּי שֶׁשָּׁמַע אַחַר כָּךְ [שֶׁהוּא יְהוּדִי וְרָאָה הַיְהוּדִים וְדָתָם הֲרֵי הוּא כְּאָנוּס שֶׁהֲרֵי גִּדְּלוּהוּ עַל טָעוּתָם] כָּךְ אֵלּוּ שֶׁאָמַרְנוּ הָאוֹחֲזִים בְּדַרְכֵי אֲבוֹתָם הַקָּרָאִים שֶׁטָּעוּ. <strong>לְפִיכָךְ רָאוּי לְהַחְזִירָן בִּתְשׁוּבָה וּלְמָשְׁכָם בְּדִבְרֵי שָׁלוֹם עַד שֶׁיַּחְזְרוּ לְאֵיתָן הַתּוֹרָה</strong></p>\n<p>To whom does the above apply? To a person who denied the Oral Law consciously, according to his perception of things. He follows after his frivolous thoughts and his capricious heart and denies the Oral Law first, as did Tzadok and Beitus and those who erred in following them.</p>\n<p><strong>The children of these errant people and their grandchildren whose parents led them away and they were born among these Karaities and raised according to their conception, they are considered as a children captured and raised by them</strong>. Such a child may not be eager to follow the path of mitzvot, for it is as if he was compelled not to. Even if later, he hears that he is Jewish and saw Jews and their faith, he is still considered as one who was compelled against observance, for he was raised according to their mistaken path. This applies to those who we mentioned who follow the erroneous Karaite path of their ancestors. <strong>Therefore it is appropriate to motivate them to repent and draw them to the power of the Torah with words of peace</strong>.(Touger translation my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So arguably, one could make the case that since those of Karaite origin are regarded as a תִינוֹק שֶׁנִּשְׁבָּה and it is therefore fitting to try and draw them closer to Torah, it might be considered okay to engage in some form of dialogue if it will have the desired effect. However, I would assume that if the person engaging in the conversation might become enamoured with the Karaite tradition, and want to pursue it themselves, then this should obviously be avoided.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in terms of the Hashkafic perspective, it is interesting to note the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_B._Soloveitchik\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia page</a> on Rav Soloveitchik as saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Soloveitchik was a life-long critic of all forms of non-Orthodox Judaism, including Reform Judaism and Conservative Judaism. <strong>He believed that these denominations were in significant error where they differed from Orthodox Judaism. He compared religious dialogue with Reform and Conservative leaders to dialogue between Pharisees and Karaites, considering it ridiculous</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So possibly if we read between the lines, it would seem at least to Rabbi Soloveitchik's view that such dialogues should be avoided.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In Megilas Taanis for Nissan in the first entry we find that Chazal did engage in dialogue with the Tzedukim;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שהיו צדוקין אומרים מביאים תמידין משל יחיד וזה מביא שבת אחד וזה מביא ב' שבתות וזה מביא שלשים יום. ומה היו דורשים אמרו כתוב בתורה את הכבש אחד תעשה בבקר. ליחיד משמע. אמרו להם חכמים אין אתם רשאים לעשות כן לפי שאין קרבן צבור בא אלא משל כל ישראל שנאמר צו את בני ישראל וגו' קרבני זה הדם לחמי אלו חלבים. לאשי זה הקטרת. ריח זו הלבונה. ניחחי אלו הנסכים. וכל שהוא כריח ניחוחיתשמרו להקריב לי במועדו שיהא כולם באים מתרומת הלשכה: ר' עקיבא אומר מניין שלא יצא וירעה בעדר ת\"ל תשמרו להקריב לי במועדו. ולהלן הוא אומר והיה לכם למשמרת עד ארבעה עשר יום. מה להלן מבקרין אותו ד' ימים קודם לשחיטתו. אף כאן מבקרין אותו ד' ימים קודם לשחיטתו. וכשגברו עליהם ונצחום התקינו שיהיו שוקלין שקליהן ומניחין אותן בלשכה והיו תמידין קריבין משל צבור. וכל אותן הימים שדנום עשאום י\"ט:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Having said that, the Gedolim of the previous generation ( R' Moshe, and others) were opposed to such to participation with other Jewish groups.\nAbout 20 years ago,  Random House published a book that featured a debate between an Orthodox Rabbi and a Reform rabbi. (One people, Two worlds). The work generated a lot of controversy within the ultra orthodox community due to the general rulings of Reb Moshe, Reb Aron and others.\nSo although it seems allowed according to the letter of the law, the Hashkafa of it is the source of fierce controversy.</p>\n\n\n",

I came up with a question because I was born Jewish but I grew up Christian and believed that music is sometimes bad . Does Judaism allow me to listen freely to every music genre I want or does it have a problem with some specific genres ( for example Black Metal ) ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Hi @JewliusCeasar and welcome to Mi Yodeya.</p>\n<p>I think it is worth stating by way of introduction that if you are on your own personal spiritual journey it does make sense to find a mentor to help you with the process (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/9146/why-is-it-necessary-to-ask-a-rabbi\">here</a>). By the same token, I would advise you not to rush the process and do too much too soon. Go at a pace that is right for you otherwise a dramatic change in lifestyle can prove to be too overburdening.</p>\n<p>I will start by detailing some sources about music that will help to frame the Jewish outlook.</p>\n<p>It writes in the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.6a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 6a</a> the following:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בִּמְקוֹם רִנָּה — שָׁם תְּהֵא תְּפִלָּה</p>\n<p>In a place of song, there prayer should be.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst this source is a reference to a synagogue where G-d's praises are sung, it nevertheless introduces the concept that song has an innately spiritual side to it.</p>\n<p>Indeed within <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/sheets/222780.5?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chassidic thought</a>, song and music represent a gateway to a much higher spiritual attachment and is a means through which one can connect with G-d. One such example in Tanach can be brought in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.3.15?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Melachim II 3:15</a> where Elisha the prophet requests the use of a musician:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now then, get me a musician.” As the musician played, the hand of the LORD came upon him,</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Kings.3.15?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_II_Kings.3.15.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> relates there, the music helped bring the spirit of prophecy upon him.</p>\n<p>In addition to music helping to forge a Divine connection, it also played a prevalent role in Jewish worship. The Leviim would sing in the Beis Hamikdash, and musical instruments were used and are mentioned several times throughout Tanach and beyond. As Rambam asserts in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_3.45?ven=Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_English_Translation,_Friedlander_(1903)&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim (Guide to the Perplexed) Part III, Chapter 45:9</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The object of the singing is to produce certain emotions; this object can only be attained by pleasing sounds and melodies accompanied by music, as was always the case in the Temple. (Friedlander translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, even the malachim (angels) we are told, relate to G-d through song e.g. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chullin.91b.15?ven=William_Davidson_Edition_-_English&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chullin 91b</a></p>\n<p>So with this in mind let us return to your question....</p>\n<p>If we regard song and music as something that has a spiritual strength to it, it does stand to reason that we should try and listen to songs that are meaningful and help us strengthen this connection. Therefore, songs that lack a sense of tznius (modesty) or morality, celebrate idol worship / pagan deities, or songs that use lyrics that are full of obscenities / inappropriate content obviously run counter to this approach.</p>\n<p>Perhaps as Rav Nachman of Breslov best encapsulates in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Likutei_Moharan.3.1.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likutei Moharan 3:1</a> (hat tip to @Yehuda):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Behold! when someone listens to the singing of a singer who is wicked, it is detrimental to his serving the Creator. But when he listens to a singer who is virtuous and worthy, it helps him</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I hope this helps to begin to answer your question and I wish much hatzlacha (luck) with your journey going forward.</p>\n\n\n",

Accordingly, the two sons of his (Kayin & Hevel) - one was killed and the second was cursed, thus his (Adam's) seed was preserved through Sheis and this is the book of generations of Adam, and so he alone are the important descendants. <strong>And even though the Torah has so far related many descendants, the descendants of Kayin were not the descendants of Adam but rather the descendants of Chava from the rider of the snake, Samael.</strong> These descendants were Chanoch, Iyrad, and Lemech. And from them are signed in the name of G-d as the names of the angels, and they are  Mechuyael and Mesushael. And with regards to the descendants of Kayin that verse says, \"And the sons of G-d saw the daughters of man\", for they were the sons of G-d and not the children of Adam. <strong>And about this, our Rabbis of blessed memory expound that the Book of Descendants of Adam - these are indeed the descendants of Adam, but not the first descendants (my point: important to note though whilst not the first they are the true descendants of Adam)</strong> What then is the meaning of the verse which appears to attribute some of the descendants of Kayin to a divine origin? It is because they were all born from Kayin who was from Chava from (lit.) the strength of a stranger (i.e. Samael).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So based on this perhaps we can make a compromise, while Kayin can be seen as the product of Chava and the Satan, he is still grouped among the descendants of Adam even though he wasn't truly from him which would at least satisfy the Gemara in Sanhedrin.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Katz made a point of approaching his own congressman who arranged  an appointment with Senator Buckley of Rabbi Katz's state of Ohio, which also eventually led to him gaining access to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Borah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Senator William Edgar Borah</a>, who had served as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</p>\n<p>On p.79 the narrative picks up on when the visa was finally granted. It writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The visa to America was finally granted, in large measure thanks to a plan devised by Rabbi Nechemiah Katz and approved by his congregation. Rabbi Katz called a meeting of his shul's board of directors and proposed the following suggestion: Should Reb Moshe be granted entry into the U.S., Rabbi Katz would resign his position and it would be given to Reb Moshe. The proposal was accepted. In fact, after arriving in America, Reb Moshe served as Rav of Bnei Yaakov for a few weeks. He then resigned the position and it was returned to his brother-in-law.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Katz informed the secretary of the Aguda HaRabbanim, <a href=\"https://forum.otzar.org/viewtopic.php?t=26597\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehudah Leib Seltzer</a>, of his shul's decision and Rabbi Seltzer then contacted <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_F._Wagner\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Senator Robert Wagner</a> of New York. A letter from the American consul in Riga to Senator Wagner dated November 2, 1936, begins:</p>\n<p><em>I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter dated October 6, 1936, in which  you request to be advised with regard to the status of the application for an immigration visa of Rabbi Moses Feinstein, now a resident of Riga, who desires to proceed to the United States to join the Congregation Bnei Jacob of Toledo, Ohio...</em></p>\n<p>However, even this move did not produce immediate results. Again Rabbi Katz thought of a plan. he appealed to the secretary of the Ohio Democratic Party, a gentile who was know as a warm, sympathetic person. The secretary enlisted the aid of the state's lieutenant governor, who beamed as he listened to Rabbi Katz's story. The American consul in Riga, Latvia, was an old friend of his! He got word to the consul, who agreed to process the papers for the family. So it was that - as Rabbi Katz put it - they had the indescribable privilege of saving the future gadol hador!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

There are a number of levels of Gehennom which accomplish different objectives in different ways, including through various destructive angels (\"malachei chavalah,\" as @Chatzkel points out). The Reishis Chochmah then proceeds to discuss the potential need for a gilgul, if the damage is too extensive. I do warn you, this read is rather arcane and abstruse.</p>\n<p>Regarding your question about whether there is a physical place called Gehennom, the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.19a.18\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 19a</a> asks this and concludes that it is a valley (גיא \"gei\") which is as deep as Gehennom - in other words, just a metaphor, rather than a physical location of Gehennom. The entrances discussed there can be understood as locations where individuals were sent to Gehennom rather than a physical manifestation of Gehennom on earth. And all of this makes sense from a logical perspective, as it is a place of cleansing for the Neshamah once it is separated from the body - thus it is an entirely spiritual experience.</p>\n\n\n",

Can a person engage in relations if she stipulates that the relationship will last for a week, or until both parties decide to move on, and so forth.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I know of no Halachic problem with a Noahide having premarital hookups with non-Jewish women; including “one-night stands”.</p>\n<p>The thesis posited in <a href=\"https://asknoah.org/forum/showthread.php?tid=2027\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the linked article</a>; that for Gentile men, having sex without the bond of marriage “<em>is deemed to be immoral and disdainful in G-d's eyes</em>”, is not supported by any Halachic sources.</p>\n<p>The article later appears to backtrack a bit, and states, “<em>Although such relations are not clearly forbidden for Gentiles, it is a repulsive act, even if done in a temporary fashion.</em>” This is an admission, that the author has no clear Torah source that forbids gentiles from engaging in such relations. Additionally, his pejorative assertion, that even for Gentiles, it is a repulsive act; is likewise not sourced in Halacha.</p>\n<p>Non-Jews do not necessarily need to be married, in order to be allowed to engage in sexual intercourse. See Maimonides (Yad, Ishus 1:4) regarding harlotry between Noahides, and there is no apparent moral fault in a non-Jew paying a sex worker for her services.</p>\n<p>Also in his Guide to the Perplexed (3:49) he says that prior to Sinai, having relations with a sex worker was a permissible act, on equal moral footing of an Israelite, post-Sinai, having relations with his wife.</p>\n<p>Maimonides (ibid.) refers to the story of Judah and Tamar (Genesis 38), and explains that the “shame” mentioned there (v. 23) merely refers to the fact that even in their society, matters of sexuality were best left un-discussed. Judah was also concerned that he would loyally fulfill his contractual obligation of paying the harlot for her services, and neglect to do so would constitute a form of theft.</p>\n<p>While non-Jews are not necessarily considered to be married, even if they engage in sexual intercourse, however if a Noahide is interested in having a longer-term relationship, then that might be considered the Noahide equivalent of “marriage”. That will have Halachic implications, in that the woman can’t have any relations with other men during this time period, as long as she’s considered married to her current sexual partner. The time period of Noahide “marriage”, is until one of the parties decides dissolve their relationship [see Maimonides (Yad, Melachim 9:8)].</p>\n\n\n",

Although the Shulchan Aruch says to cover your eyes with your hands, the Mishna Berura (65:17) says it means your right hand. The Shaare Teshuva brings some who say differently. However, since it's helping to do a mitzvah, the minhag became to use the right hand since the right hand is considered more chashuv for a mitzvah. (Chabad.org)</p>\n<p>By candle lighting the point is to cover the candles so that you don't have benefit from the candles until after the bracha. The language of Shulchan Aruch (263:5) is that you use your hand to cover the candles not your eyes. Since the minimum amount of candles to light is 2, it was more prudent to use both hands. Over time it became simpler to just cover your eyes, but since it started with 2 hands they continued using both.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is killing a robber by shooting first considered murder?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apologies if this has already been answered :</p>\n<p>If someone comes up to you on the street waving a gun and demanding your money and you immediately draw your concealed weapon and shoot and kill them, is that considered murder or valid self defense? Is it like when a thief enters your house in the middle of the night, or different because it happened on public property? Could you claim the robber was a rodef because as soon as he pointed a gun at you he could have shot you at any point, and so your life was in danger?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Talmud says: lf someone comes to kill you, kill him first (if that is the only way to stop him).  Pointing a gun at you can only be interpreted as a threat to kill you.  So you would be justified in taking his life first.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>The Talmud says (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.74a.11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 74a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The ruling of the mishna is stated with regard to a young woman who was raped in a case where one was able to save her by injuring the pursuer in one of his limbs, so that it was not necessary to kill him in order to achieve her rescue, and it is in accordance with the opinion of Rabbi Yonatan ben Shaul. As it is taught in a baraita: Rabbi Yonatan ben Shaul says: If a pursuer was pursuing another to kill him, and one was able to save the pursued party without killing the pursuer, but instead by injuring him in one of his limbs, but he did not save him in this manner and rather chose to kill him, he is executed on his account as a murderer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So even killing a certain perpetrator of a very serious crime (rape), who <strong>certainly committed</strong> the crime, when that killing was avoidable, makes one a murderer. Therefore in the context of the question here, where one kills someone who has <strong>not even committed</strong> the very serious crime (murder), <strong>and apparently does not wish to do</strong> (it appears they want a threat not to actually kill), to kill them when avoidable, is surely murder.</p>\n<p>Since their action appears to be avoidable by handing over the wallet, shooting them instead would apparently be murder.</p>\n<p>And again (same source):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From where do we derive this halakha with regard to a murderer himself, that one must allow himself to be killed rather than commit murder? The Gemara answers: It is based on logical reasoning that one life is not preferable to another, and therefore there is no need for a verse to teach this halakha. The Gemara relates an incident to demonstrate this: As when a certain person came before Rabba and said to him: The lord of my place, a local official, said to me: Go kill so-and-so, and if not I will kill you, what shall I do? Rabba said to him: It is preferable that he should kill you and you should not kill. Who is to say that your blood is redder than his, that your life is worth more than the one he wants you to kill? Perhaps that man’s blood is redder. This logical reasoning is the basis for the halakha that one may not save his own life by killing another.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So a person is not permitted to <strong>certainly</strong> save their own life (which will <strong>certainly</strong> be ended in an unlawful manner) by committing a killing themself. Therefore it is hard to see how a person could be permitted to only <strong>potentially</strong> save their own life (which is only <strong>maybe</strong> going to be ended in an unlawful manner) by committing a killing themself.</p>\n\n\n",

Is it ok to learn about foreign cultures and religions? Why or why not?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -2)\n\n<p>Yes, it is ok. We need to understand Christianity in order to refute Christian beliefs, such as the notion that a trinity exists or “original sin.” Indeed, Rambam tells us that he studied the Sabian religion quite rigorously. As an anthropologist, he hoped to better understand Judaism and the reasons for its many commandments. After much study, the Rambam concluded that many commands are directly linked to Sabian idolatry, but that the Torah refines, restricts, or gives new meaning to these practices. For example, the Sabians revered cows as holy animals (no relation to Hinduism) and thus prohibited their slaughter. The Rambam explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As for the slaughter of oxen, the majority of idolaters abominated it,\nas all of them held this species in very great esteem. Hence you will\nfind that up to our time, the Indians do not slaughter oxen, even in\ncountries where other species of animals are slaughtered. (Guide,\n3:46)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://libertarianjew.blogspot.com/2010/05/studying-foreign-theologies-is-it.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Here</a> is a good essay about why it is permitted to study foreign theologies.</p>\n\n\n",

An accurate translation of ותפילות ופיוטים שחמור פירושם would be \"tefillos and piyutim whose explanations are difficult\", meaning that they are hard to understand. So one should review difficult sections of the prayers. Presumably the definition of difficult varies from person to person. In addition, over the years you should become more and more familiar.</p>\n<p>So one should review portions of the prayers they are not familiar with. Personally I try to review the piyutim from selichos the day before, as they use very poetic language and unusual words.</p>\n<p>See the Shaarei Teshuva referenced by the Mishna Berura that memorable tefillos such as Al HaNissim do not need to be prepared, and a discussion of the prayers of Moadim.</p>\n<p>So if I know someone does not prepare, I would be dan l'kaf zechus that they think they are familiar with all the piyutim already for previous years.

The second word in your link that's translated as \"milk\" is a verb that in the interlinear English is left unconjugated; it's not a noun (you can look at the V underneath it to tell). It helps to look at a proper translation, not just at an interlinear one.

In Aruch Chaim 108:1 it says</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טעה או נאנס ולא התפלל שחרית מתפלל מנחה שתים הראשונה מנחה והשני' לתשלומין ואם היפך לא יצא ידי תפלה שהיא תשלומין וצריך לחזור ולהתפלל אותה וכן הדין בכל מקום שצריך להתפלל תפלה לתשלומין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If one erred or was forced [by circumstance] and did not pray the morning prayer, he should pray the afternoon prayer twice: the first is the afternoon prayer, and the second as a make-up. If one inverted [the order], he has not fulfilled his obligation in prayer for the make-up one, and one needs to go back and pray it. And the same law applies in every case in which one must pray a make-up prayer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna Berura brings a qualification by some Achronim who say that if it's not absolutely clear from his davening that he did the first for tashlumin then we can assume his intention was for the proper tefilla.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם היפך - פי' שהיתה בדעתו שתהא הראשונה לתשלומין לא יצא דלא תקנו רבנן השלמה אלא בזמן התעסקות בתפילה חיובית ולא קודם לכן ויש מפקפקים לומר שא\"צ לחזור ולהתפלל אא\"כ גילה דעתו בפירוש בתפילתו שהשניה היא לשם חובה והראשונה לתשלומין וכגון שהוא מוצאי שבת והבדיל בשניה ולא הבדיל בראשונה כמו שיתבאר ולענין דינא כתב הפר\"ח והפמ\"ג שאין לנו אלא דברי המחבר וכן העתיק הדה\"ח להלכה ומ\"מ טוב יותר שבעת שחוזר ומתפלל יתנה ויאמר אם איני מחוייב להתפלל פעם שנית אני מתפלל אותה בתורת נדבה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Although here he concludes stringently, in his sefer Machneh Yisroel and Nidchei Yisroel he rules leniently not to repeat davening again if it will cause too much aggravation.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Choice between financial success and Torah study\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Let us assume for the sake of discussion the following scenario.</p>\n<p>There is a young, devout man[1] who has reached a point life where he earns more than enough money to sustain himself. He's by no means rich as in a millionaire or billionaire, but he owns a business that can allow him to live a more-or-less care free life.</p>\n<p>He also has plenty of extra time. He could use this extra time in one of two ways.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>He could put more time into his work, expand his business and acquire wealth, which he could then use to perform charity and good works.</li>\n<li>He could be content with his current standard of living, and use all the spare time he has to devote himself to Torah study.</li>\n<li>There is no number 3. Balance between the two is not possible in his situation. He either chooses one route, or the other. If he pursues the path of Torah study, he will not be left with enough time and energy to increase his business. If he pursues the path of business, his time and energy for Torah study will be severely hampered and limited at best.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Please also cite sources for your answers.</p>\n<p>What should the said person do in this situation ?\n[1] I did not specify whether he was a Jew or a Noachide. If there's a difference, please treat both scenarios.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>This is a loaded question that I am sure will generate a lot of feedback. The plain and simple answer is that each and every situation is unique and different, and therefore needs to be asked to a competent Rabbi or Mentor for specific personal guidance. It depends if the person will really be able to sit and learn properly or they will waste their time. There are many sources that discuss this topic in Sifrei Mussar and other places. Here are some I can think of to start;</p>\n<p>Berachos 35B (link in previous comments) mentions that the allowance to work at all is based on the Passuk of ואספת דגנך so it seems that once that is complete, there would no longer be a heter to continue working.</p>\n<p>Kiddushin 29B The gemarah relates a story with R' Acha Bar Yackov who told his son that since he was not being succesful with his learning, they should switch places and the son should work and he will learn. The option of both working and giving charity was not raised.</p>\n<p>Mishna Pe'ah 1:1 brings a list of mitzvohs that have reward in both worlds, it includes doing chesed and others, and then ends off that Torah is above all - וְתַלְמוּד תּוֹרָה כְּנֶֽגֶד כֻּלָּם , so it seems that if you are presented with an opportunity to either do tzedaka or learn, learning is more important as long as the chesed will be done by others.</p>\n<p>The Mishna in Avos in the 6th Perek brings a story from R' Yossi ben Kisma who was asked about moving to a far away city and he would be given a lot of money. He declined, saying that he only wants to live in a Makom Torah. I heard from R' Shmuel Berenbaum zt\"l (RY Mir Brokklyn) that he asked why didn't Reb Yossi take the  money and do tzedaka, build yeshivos, do mitzvohs? You know how much more he could of done had he of taken the money? They weren't even asking him to stop learning, just to move to their city and learn there?? He answered that we see from here that even for a lower level of quality of Torah, not even less quantity, you do not give that up for extra money beyond what you need to live.</p>\n<p>Having said all this, I personally know someone very very well who was told by his Rosh Hayeshiva when an opportunity presented itself, that Klal Yisroel needs people who will go work and donate 50% of their money to tzedaka and he should leave learning to go to work in the opportunity that was presented. When he asked R' Chaim Kanievsky he agreed.</p>\n<p>(I have heard from others who were told that the guideline is that once you have enough you do not go out to look for more income. However if an opportunity presents itself without you going to look for it, then you need to determine if it is a test from Heaven or your Tafkid right now. For that you need to ask your mentor for guidance.)</p>\n<p>As for a Noachide, he only has the 7 commandments, there is no commandment for him to learn all day so it would be perfectly fine for him to work as much as he wants.</p>\n<p>I am sure many will disagree with a lot that I mentioned here, I am just presenting one angle to the equation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>\"better to be a tail to lions than a head to foxes\" (Ethics of the Fathers 4:16</p>\n<p>see the Tiferes Yisrael commentary who says the lions refer to torah scholars while foxes refers to businessmen.</p>\n<p>i.e. better to be learning torah even if you are not going to be a big scholar, rather than to be a head of businessmen.</p>\n<p>however, as the answer by chatzkel, best to consult a wise torah scholar</p>\n\n\n",

Aaron’s sons entered, and Moses taught them their lesson while Aaron listened. Aaron’s sons moved aside; Elazar sat to the right of Moses and Itamar sat to the left of Aaron... The elders entered and Moses taught them their lesson. The elders moved aside, and the entire nation entered and Moses taught them their lesson. Therefore, Aaron had heard the lesson four times, his sons heard it three times, the elders heard it twice, and the entire nation heard it once.<br />\nMoses then departed to his tent, and Aaron taught the others his lesson as he had learned it from Moses. Aaron then departed and his sons taught the others their lesson. His sons then departed and the elders taught the rest of the people their lesson.

The Gemara answers: Since Moses had studied directly from the mouth of the Almighty, it would be more effective for everyone to hear the Torah at least once from Moses himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharsha says that the process of who went first, second etc. was learned from the setup on Har Sinai where Hashem said Aron goes Higher than his sons who go higher than the Elders who go higher than the rest of the nation.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>משה למד כו' נר' שסמכו דבריהם אקרא דפרשת משפטים ויעל משה ואהרן נדב ואביהוא ושבעים מזקני ישראל כסדרן בקרא כך סדר למודן וכל המוקדם בפסוק נכנס בתחלה וכדמסיק כדי לחלוק כבוד כו'. ואמר</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ben Yoadah on the Gemarah says that the reason all Klal Yisroel did not just hear it 4 times from Moshe was because it was too much to teach it to 600,000 at one time. Doing it more than once would be too much for Moshe. Therefore Moshe did it once, Aron did it once, and so forth.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובזה ניחא לתרץ קושיא אחריתי, השתא דמשני כיון דמשה רבינו ע\"ה למד מפי הגבורה מסתייעא מילתא תחזור קושיא ראשונה לדוכתא, שיכנסו כולם בבת אחת וילמדו ממשה רבינו ע\"ה? כי מאחר דמסתייעא מילתא טפי לא משגחינן בעבור הכבוד! וכפי האמור ניחא, דבזה האופן צריך דמשה רבינו ע\"ה ילמד את כולם וישמיע קולו לכולם ארבעה פעמים, ואיכא בזה טרחא טובא</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharsha adds that only on the fourth time is it called Lishmah.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ונמצא ביד אהרן ד' כו' דאיתא במדרש דמשה נמי למדה מפי הגבורה ד' פעמים דכתיב אז ראה ויספרה הכינה וגם חקרה וגו' וענינו נראה שאחר שנתחזק להם הלימוד בג\"פ יהיה לימוד הד' לימוד אמיתי לשמה וע\"פ מה שכתבנו במסכת נדרים שהלימוד שלא לשמה הוא בג' דרכים והד' הוא לימוד לשמה והסימן שלהן אגד\"ל שאלו ד' אותיות יש להן למ\"ד ובג\"פ יצא מכלל ג' לימוד שלא לשמה שיהיה להם הלימוד הד' לשמה:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So perhaps we can now answer all your questions.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>It is learned from the set up on Har Sinai</li>\n<li>It gave proper honor to those who deserved it - Kavod Hatorah, plus it gave everyone a chance to learn it 4 times and to hear it from each person on their 4th time which is the time of Lishmah.</li>\n<li>It would of been too much tircha for Moshe to do it 4 times for the whole nation at once.

After he emigrated to Babylonia, the Sages related this same halakha in the name of Rabbi Yoḥanan, and he accepted it. Then Abaye said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲמַר: אִי זְכַאי, גְּמִירְתַּיהּ לִשְׁמַעְתֵּיהּ מֵעִיקָּרָא\n-- If I had been worthy, I would have learned this halakha from the beginning.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara continues: Well, didn’t he ultimately learn it and accept it? What difference does it make from whom and when he learned it? And it answers: The practical difference is that knowledge acquired in one’s youth is remembered better.</p>\n<p>My problem is with \"אִי זְכַאי -- if I had been worthy\".  Are the less \"worthy\" among us not entitled to the same Torah teaching and learning as all other Jews?  There is an implication of \"punishment\" here that I can't understand.  Perhaps the Gemara simply means that knowledge acquired earlier in life stays with us longer.  Sure, but that's a natural matter, independent of one's \"worthiness\", not a punishment.  If Abaye had said: If I had been smarter, more dedicated, more learned, etc., I would have understood.</p>\n<p>The Talmud says elsewhere that the Torah is the very antidote to the evil inclination.  [Kiddushin 30b]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Like @Chatzkel noted in the comments I think a fairer translation is \"If I merited\" not \"If I was worthy\".</p>\n<p>The Ishbitzer, Rabbi Mordechai Yosef Leiner zt\"l in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mei_HaShiloach%2C_Volume_I%2C_Talmud%2C_Shabbat.21b.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mei HaShiloach</a> on the Gemara addresses this point:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אי זכאי היינו שהייתי מזוכך במדת קבל אמת ממי שאמרו גמירתיה מעיקרא, הלא הדבר הוא אמת מפני מה לא קבלתי אותה כשנאמרה משמיה דר' ירמיה, אף אם סוף דבר מארץ תצמח שלא הפסידו לגמרי, אך עכ\"פ הפסיד הגירסא דינקותא, היינו שיש חילוק בין הלומד דבר תיכף ומיד כשנתחדש בעולם אז יש בו יותר כח וטעם מאשר כבר נתחדש, וזה פי' גירסא דינקותא היינו כמו שהתינוק יונק משדי אמו יונק חלב מה שלא היה עוד בעולם שלא נתיישן אפילו רגע ונמצא טעם טוב מדבר שנתיישן, כמו שנאמר בלחם הפנים (שמואל א' כ\"א,י\"ז) לשום לחם חם היינו שלא נתיישן רק היה תמיד חדש.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In essence he underscores the fact that when Abaye says \"אי זכאי\" - \"If I had merited\", he is bemoaning the fact that he didn't merit learning it when he was younger as something learnt in one's young age is much more fresh and therefore more easily retained. i.e. there is a significant difference between someone who learns something straight away when there's a sense of freshness compared to someone who learns it when their mind lacks the vitality of youth. He likens it to a baby nursing, the milk is there and provides immediate nourishment and is much better than something that has become old and left to fester which obviously will not be nearly as beneficial.</p>\n<p>It is a lesson in making the most of our time when we are young as the mind is much sharper and can recall the Torah learnt much more effectively. It draws parallels with the Mishna in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.20?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:20</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֱלִישָׁע בֶּן אֲבוּיָה אוֹמֵר, הַלּוֹמֵד יֶלֶד לְמַה הוּא דוֹמֶה, לִדְיוֹ כְתוּבָה עַל נְיָר חָדָשׁ. וְהַלּוֹמֵד זָקֵן לְמַה הוּא דוֹמֶה, לִדְיוֹ כְתוּבָה עַל נְיָר מָחוּק.</p>\n<p>Elisha ben Avuya says: A child that learns, to whom is he comparable? To ink that is written on fresh paper. And he who learns when an old man, to what is he compared? To ink written on a rubbed writing sheet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The message being that just like fresh paper instantly soaks up the ink, retaining that which has been inscribed on its pages, so too, children’s receptive minds maintain that which they have learnt.  Whilst Rashi and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.20?lang=bi&p2=Rambam_on_Pirkei_Avot.4.20.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> render this Mishnah as a reference to young students absorbing the words from their Rebbeim, the same would ring true in all areas. When a human being is in their younger years the brain is much sharper and more responsive. Conversely, as a human reaches old age the alertness that they enjoyed in their youth has significantly diminished.</p>\n\n\n",

It can harm us and others spiritually, physically, emotionally, and socially. Anger, powerful and negative though it is, can also serve as our teacher (see Eruvin 65b). It shows us who we are, what is important to us, our level of self-mastery, and how we cope with adversity and frustration. We must learn from anger and, in the process, master not only it, but ourselves -- because we can. We are not doomed to repeat our tantrums and indignation, constantly and endlessly. We can change. But how? In Anger: The Inner Teacher, Rabbi Zelig Pliskin, a noted author and insightful counselor, presents a nine-step program to help us purge anger from ourselves. The author draws on Torah literature and his extensive counseling experience to build a comprehensive approach for coping with anger. This book is a practical guide offering underlying concepts and practical hands-on tools for decreasing and preventing anger. This step-by-step program is for anyone wishing to gain greater mastery over his other emotions. It also provides a useful model for those in the helping professions. As long as we are alive we can choose to correct the way we live. Anger is a natural human emotion. Refining and transcending it provides us with the opportunity to become the type of human being we wish tobe. Rabbi Pliskin has gained an international following as someone who sets his sights high but keeps his approach down-to-earth.

In Orchos Rabbeinu (Chelek 3, Page 208) it says the Chazon Ish holds that as long as even one person who started along with the Tzibbur is still davening, then you can start and still be considered Tefilla B'tzibbur. He even says this could work in a chain, meaning you start before one person finishes and someone else starts before you finish and so forth.

And if you wish, say instead that in the place where this tanna lived, a large quantity of bread was simply called pat ava, thick bread. (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How would a Rabbinic Jew refute the Karaites' claims?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>How would a Rabbinic Jew refute the Karaites claims? That they're the original Judaism? That their customs are correct and ours are wrong? Will you please provide sources too?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>[I apologize that the answer came out so long. It's a complex subject in my opinion, and so a lot of ground needed to be covered].</p>\n<p>I have been thinking about this question for several days now. I was trying to decide whether the answer should be a really easy one, for the impracticality of the halacha of early Karaites (which, for this exact reason, is not kept by modern Karaites) and for the sources later ones used to explain their history, or a difficult one, for the complexity of some of the roots of early Karaite and pre-Karaites (but still not Rabbinic) theology. Not for nothing, the Geonim and the Rishonim had a difficult time holding off Karaite influence, and again, not for nothing, at one time, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karaite_Judaism#The_Golden_Age\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the Karaites comprised some 40% of the Jewish people</a> (!). If it was truly so simple to disprove their claim, I would think that it would have been easier to \"defeat\" them, so to speak (though I may be mistaken about the rationale<sup>1</sup>). On the face of things, the problem is that we're dealing here with <strong>tradition</strong> and without a time machine or nevuah, disproving <strong>tradition</strong> is difficult. However, in the Karaites case, this may not be quite so difficult. Let me explain:</p>\n<p>The modern consensus among scholars is that the Karaites weren't started by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anan_ben_David\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Anan ben David</a> (<a href=\"http://www.karaite.org.il/news/%D7%A2%D7%A0%D7%9F-%D7%91%D7%9F-%D7%93%D7%95%D7%93\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">and so say the Karaites nowadays</a> as well). Rather, Anan's group of ex-Rabbanites, the Ananites, joined up with some of the remnants of various older Jewish sects, thought nowadays to have been the spiritual descendants of, among other groups, certain Second Temple-era sects such as the Qumranites. Qumranite influence can be seen by various terms Karaite texts have that were then found, over the last 75 years, in the Dead Sea Scrolls (see for example <a href=\"https://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/vip/Erder-Yoram.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Yoram Erder</a> <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23438292.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A2addd4ad8d24408b0f5d64f44902ea96\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/23437831.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A9128c5914370f59dcc51fa0dde4e0bba\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) and by the testament of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Qirqisani\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yaakov Qirqisani</a>, a 10th century Karaite, who, when speaking of the views of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Nahawandi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Binyamin Nahawandi</a>, probably the most prominent of the second-generation Karaites, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/collectionpamph00harkgoog/page/n315/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">said</a><sup>2</sup> that those views were similar to the views of \"the Magarites\" (אלמגאריה), which means \"cave people\" because <em>their writings were found in caves</em> - this is nowadays thought to be one point of evidence that earlier Jews also found some of the DSS (for a summary of other points, see <a href=\"http://www.machonso.org/hamaayan/?gilayon=61&id=1812\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>). Qirqisani also mentions some of the other early Karaites who today are thought to have been members of other sects that had joined together to form the Karaite movement.</p>\n<p>Qumranite influence upon Karaite theology is problematic because I'm not sure we know enough about the Qumranites in order to disprove their views and traditions. This is the difficult aspect of the answer. The flip-side of the matter is that it seems that Qumranite theology mostly influenced the fringe Karaite groups, such as the one led by <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%9E%D7%A2%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%9B%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yishmael the Akubarite</a>, or even prominent ones, such as Nahawandi's, but Nahawandi's influence died out quickly, which shows that his views weren't too popular in the long run. The bottom line is that mainstream Karaism (as much as any part of Karaism may be referred to as such) may have still borrowed some terms, but that's pretty much where the similarities end. As <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A0%D7%AA%D7%9F_%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Natan Shur</a> put it in his book \"The History of the Karaites\", pg. 19 (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Against the argument that there's a connection between the Karaites and the Dead Sea Scrolls stand a number of heavy-weight counter-arguments, and these are:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Qirqisani the Karaite does not give the discovery of the ancient manuscripts any particularly special attention, and in fact, he believes that most [of what was found] were nonsensical. Besides, the discovery of these scrolls was not mentioned in any other early Karaite source.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The faith that is presented in the scrolls, the faith in pre-determined fate, does not line up with the commonly-accepted Karaite faith - the belief in free will.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poor Hebraic stylization of the scrolls hints that their authors didn't study Tanach very deeply. The Karaites, on the other hand, placed the Tanach in the center of their faith. [...]</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And so forth. And he concludes (pg. 20):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...From here we see that at this stage of the research, it is difficult to conclude that the DSS had any direct influence upon early Karaism...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As I said, mainstream Karaism almost certainly had little to do with Qumranism.</p>\n<p>So what exactly is \"mainstream Karaism\"? The Ananites perhaps weren't the central Karaite group at first, but by the tenth century, they were considered the forefathers of Karaism and from this time onwards, Karaism was heavily influenced by the Ananites' teachings. This leads us to the simpler aspect of the answer: Disproving the <em>roots</em> of mainstream Karaism. This is divided into two points: The impracticality of early Karaite halacha and the sources later Karaites use to explain the history of the movement.</p>\n<p><strong>1.</strong> The impracticality of early Karaite halacha - early Karaite halacha was essentially a free-for-all, anything-goes sort of school of thought. As the Rambam put it in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Pirkei_Avot.1.3?lang=bi&p2=Rambam_on_Pirkei_Avot.1.3.1&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary on Avot 1:3</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...And they are called Karaites in these lands - I mean to say, Egypt. And their names among the sages are Sadducees and Boethusians. And they are the ones that began to question the transmission and to explain all of the verse according to what appears to them without listening to the sage at all...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in an anonymously-authored anti-Karaite polemical manuscript, <a href=\"https://hebrew.bodleian.ox.ac.uk/fragments/full/MS_HEB_f_18_1a.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it says</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"They [the Karaites] are loyal to a view that can be summarized per their saying: \"one Torah and one law\". They deny any book written per Oral Torah explanations and not per the Written Torah. They, in any case, create a variety of books, differing commentaries and explanations that dispute one another. It began with Anan, continued with Binyamin, and Malach, one after the next...\" (English translation per the Hebrew translation <a href=\"https://humanities.tau.ac.il/sites/humanities.tau.ac.il/files/media_server/Jewish%20History/Teuda/Teuda-%20vol%2029-%20English/Teuda-%20Vol%2029-%2005-%20Sklare.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pg. 96)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as <a href=\"https://he.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Yerachmiel Brody</a> <a href=\"https://lib.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=21136\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">summarized</a> the issue:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Lacking any sort of binding tradition or authoritative body in charge of deciding the halacha, any Karaite author was free to interpret the text as he wished...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is of course a major problem for Karaite theology, for two reasons: a. It is obvious from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.17.9-10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 17:9-10</a> that there must be a governing body and a widely-accepted interpretation of the law. b. If it was truly the case that since the giving of the Torah in Sinai, any man was free to interpret the Torah as he saw fit, then how is it possible that generations of prophets rebuked Am Yisrael for not keeping the Torah?! After all, any man could approach the prophet and tell him: \"Excuse me, who are you to say that I'm not keeping the commandments? I keep them as I see fit!\"</p>\n<p>Later Karaites apparently came to these same conclusions, for they began to institute new rules within Karaism, so that not every interpretation was truly acceptable, at least in practical terms. And they also created governing bodies - the \"Chachamim\" as they call them. Nonetheless, <em>this</em> aspect of their roots appears to have been refuted.</p>\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The sources later Karaites use to explain the history of the movement - strange as it may seem, Karaites from the 10th century and onwards used Geonic and Rishonic Rabbinical writings as a basis for their accounts of Karaite history. For example, many used Rihal's version in the Kuzari (see <a href=\"https://www.nli.org.il/en/newspapers/?a=is&oid=hzf19190413-01&type=staticpdf&submitted=1&e=-------en-20--1--img-txIN%7CtxTI--------------1&g-recaptcha-response=03AGdBq26q4vfRV2BDfZ3usoRl3UK3QWBIOKoEON3GOaYBoNHkSGNg70DPFzORpwTQ_URaQiTZV4flhQYIOozeiXugCHUfPigJ62CUpX1cTlCLsIOvcnr5cJDkN_D082EFJuTAVpdNvYroqIUM0PRDHTBWhqZvgRkYNkR3U7v8LrDHI61Tc7Pp5wQEsz78CvvUVy6RxsgY0sWJFZnfBN2NOze5qG9_lABOU70HUSj--TMeA9U9Hr0brRbUnDVW6YNirjzu0OfJpT2xJ59IJul_yGVl0bJcI7Q49qP9WHOFyUvAngN4BVBVnVr7qIqwn5S0N_ZLI63S_K1D-TsuC_NyQYQAi-B_YoIHt8FH03hPuEKS5wihOfXSsY8gMeKDSG-1HUWFYsZKPJex_S5VybVSpORTmEzcaCiqrSSyqjISYmoa2hJhVfWECEYGJ4Is3g751mxq99oUnUyA\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pg. 14, right column). This is problematic on their end, because it shows that they had no non-Rabbinical sources to tell the story of how their sect came to be. And since they contended that the Rabbanites invented things such as the Oral Torah, how could they trust their historical accounts, which are <em>part</em> of the Oral Torah?</p>\n<p>Therefore, the other aspect of their roots has also been shown to not hold any water.</p>\n<p><strong>To summarize</strong>: There are some aspects of early Karaism that we do not have enough information about them to properly refute them. But the central tenants of early <em>mainstream</em> Karaism can be refuted in my opinion, and these - in particular the first point - were indeed subject to the continuous attacks of the Geonim and Rishonim.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Perhaps most Jews weren't drawn to them because of their logic but for other reasons, such as frustration with the contemporary model of Jewish leadership. There were also times in which some Karaite communities told European Christians that they weren't Jewish, and so received more lenient treatment from the Christians. Some contend that most cultic Jews were simple people with little theological knowledge and were simply drawn to the messianic façade displayed by the charismatic leaders of these sects.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> As far as I know, Qirqisani's book \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Qirqisani#Kitab_al-Anwar\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kitab al-anwar wal-marakib</a>\" on the history of the Karaites has yet to have been translated into Hebrew or English, so quotes from his book come from those that studied the original Arabic.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Karaites don't believe the oral law. Many things in the Torah can't be understood without the oral tradition. For example it says to wear totafos between your eyes. What are Totafos? Without the oral law, the Torah can't be understood.  It says a person who does \"work\" on Shabbos is put to death. What defines work.(I once asked a Karaite this question and he said he was wondering the same thing.)</p>\n<p>Without the oral tradition you just give your own interpretation what the verses mean. That would lead to thousands of interpretations, without knowing which is right. Obviously the Oral law was given with the Torah, since if not for it, people wouldn't understand the Torah. Therefore obviously people who claim that the oral law is fake can't be the ones that received the Torah. (Or they were Jewish and started a new cult, denying the oral law...)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>If you are looking for a refutation with sources see the Sefer Kuzari Sheni.</p>\n<p>If you want a more simple one just use the following observation. Karaites barely exist. Ditto for Samaritans and Sadducees and other group that rejected Rabbinic traditions. (there have been others over the millennia) If the groups who reject rabbinic law represent the  divine will  why do they appear and disappear over time?\nShouldn't the groups who truly who represents Gods will remain eternally?</p>\n<p>(the main point is that  the Sefer Kuzari Sheni gives the sources answer in Kariate claims. I won't debate the second proof)</p>\n\n\n",

Our teaching is that that is the reason we remove the middle thirteen berachot of Shemoneh Esrei on Shabbat.

In two separate online shiurim that I have listened to (dafyomi.org and realcleardaf.com) the maggid shiur not only does this, but <i>continues</i> replacing every instance of “beitza” with “bei’a” in the gemara as well.</p>\n<p>For an example from realcleardaf.com, see <a href=\"https://www.realcleardaf.com/shiurim/moed/beitzah/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> (it is possible that you need to register to listen to the content); for an example from dafyomi.org, see <a href=\"http://download.dafyomi.org/content/dafyomi/mp3/beitzah/beitzah_002a.mp3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>And yet, wherever the word beitza appears in <em>other</em> masekhtas (eg: at the bottom of Shabbes 19b), the maggid shiur in question keeps it as “beitza”.</p>\n<p>Where does the tradition of replacing the Hebrew with the Aramaic come from, and why is it done only in this one masekhta? It is obviously not an issue with the word itself, but an issue with its appearance in this particular tractate. What is the reason for that, and when did this tradition develop?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Refer to this website <a href=\"http://www.shemayisrael.co.il/dafyomi2/beitzah/intro.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Many have the custom to refer to the Maseches as \"Bei'a,\" which is the Aramaic term for \"egg.\" The source for this practice is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Magen_Avraham.156.2?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">MAGEN AVRAHAM (end of OC 156)</a> in the name of the MAHARSHAL (Yam Shel Shlomo, Bava Kama 4:11), who writes that it is proper to say [\"Bei'a\" or] \"Bei'im\" instead of [\"Beitzah\" or] \"Beitzim,\" in order to maintain a high standard of purity of speech.<sup>1</sup> (The word \"Beitzah\" is used in Chazal to connote part of the reproductive organ, and thus it is improper to utter it.)</p>\n<p>The IYEI HA'YAM (cited by the Likutim on the Mishnayos), however, refutes this practice, pointing out that there is no source anywhere in Shas that the Sages refrained from pronouncing the word as \"Beitzah\" or that they classified it as improper speech. In fact, we find that Chazal even borrowed the term and described many oblong objects as \"Beitzah\" (such as \"Beitzah ha'Gir,\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Beitzah.15a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beitzah 15a</a>). Furthermore, what is gained by translating the word to Aramaic? It means the same thing in any language! As a clear proof that the word was indeed pronounced \"Beitzim\" in the days of Chazal, he cites the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.5b.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin (5b)</a> which relates an incident whereby a certain Talmid made a Halachic statement regarding \"Mei Beitzim\" (eggs) and people erred Halachically because they thought that he said \"Mei Bitzim\" (swamp water, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.5b.6?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Sanhedrin.5b.6.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos</a> there). Had he said \"Bei'im,\" no misunderstanding would have occurred! This prompts the TIFERES YISRAEL to suggest that indeed, the practice of not pronouncing the word as \"Beitzah\" has nothing to do with improper speech. Rather, since a Halachic error occurred because of the similarity between the words \"Beitzim\" and \"Bitzim,\" the practice arose to pronounce the word \"Bei'a,\" when used in a Halachic context. (The Iyei ha'Yam, though, quotes the son of the Vilna Ga'on as saying that the VILNA GA'ON called the Maseches \"Beitzah,\" in contrast to the words of the Magen Avraham.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אל יוציא דבר מגונה מפיו ולכן לא יאמר בתלמוד ביצים אלא בעים [יש\"ש ב\"ק פ\"ד]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Instead of “These are the ones who hit” I would’ve expected it to be “these are the ones who are hit.” One thought would be that it’s shortened from something like “these are the ones that we hit” but I don’t find that to be a satisfactory answer.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Good point, first, I want to strengthen your question by providing a Talmudic example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"שמעתי שכל הזורע ברביעה ראשונה <strong>ברד מלקה אותו</strong>.<br />\nהלך הוא וזרע ברביעה שניה. של כל העולם כולו <strong>לקה, שלו לא לקה</strong>.\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.18b.7?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berakhot.18b</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As we can see here, לקה is used in direct connection with הלקה (הפעיל) suggesting a passive form. <em>(Maybe you should copy it to your question.)</em></p>\n<p>I would offer two propositions (there are no true explanations, of course):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>If you look at other usages of the word it is closer to signifying a state, such as Hebrew גדל, or חסר, or כואב, or חולה. For example: \"כהן שלקה באצבעו כורך עליו גמי\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Eruvin.64a.2?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">JT Eruvin 64a</a>), \"החושד בכשרים לוקה בגופו\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.97a.4?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat.97a</a>). So like saying \"אני מכאיב לו והוא כואב\", we can say \"אני מלקה אותו והוא לוקה\".</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The word ללקות is originally Mishnaic (Aramaic), not Biblical, so Rabbis were free to put it in any form they like. In my observation (as a native Hebrew speaker) they weren't particularly grammar-savvy, as Hebrew wasn't spoken language at their times. To wit, they frequently use weird grammatical forms (like הן לוקין instead of הם לוקים, confusing לקרות and לקרוא), disagreement in gender, and more.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Rashba (IIRC, siman 694 in teshuvos) deals with a similar question: Why does the Mishna always refer to the man doing chalitza, when in reality it is the woman who performs chalitza? He answers that the Mishna doesn't usually care about these issues when it is just a matter of grammar and there is no room for error in understanding.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Disclaimer that this is just a theory, but here goes:</p>\n<p>The Tiferes Yisrael to Arachin Ch. 4 theorizes that many of the oddities of Mishna could be explained as means to help memorization. (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.32a.12?lang=he&p2=Tosafot_on_Megillah.32a.12.1&lang2=he&w2=all&lang3=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> to Megillah) He uses this to explain extraneous halachos (such as <em>Lo zu af zu</em> and <em>Zu v'ein tzarich lomar zu</em>) and also cases of the Gemara saying the Mishnah is missing words (חסורי מחסרא והכי קתני).</p>\n<p>Perhaps this could also explain Mishnayos switching terms from passive to active voice. This would be a technique to make the Mishnah more memorable, without sacrificing clarity.</p>\n\n\n",

Here comes the usage of the hermeneutics that clarify the Torah, whose result is the halacha and not the simple understanding of the text. This is a form of study that requires a set institution that decides what is right in unresolved cases, and this duty is implemented by the priests and elders.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Written Torah teaches the ethical direction that forms the base of the Torah, which is learned from the wording of the text, even if it is not halacha...the one in charge of passing on the ethics of the Torah is the king, who reads from the Torah \"so that he may learn to revere the LORD his God\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.17.19?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 17:19</a>), and even actively acts according to the Written Torah with regards to leading the state (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.24.16?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Haamek_Davar_on_Deuteronomy.24.16.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Natziv on Devarim 24:16</a>).</p>\n<p>This is evident from our parsha: \"Then Moses called Joshua and said to him...“Be strong and resolute, for it is you who shall go with this people into the land...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.31.7?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 31:7</a>). On the face of things, Yehoshua is only given military and state duties alone. Immediately afterwards it says: \"Moses wrote down this Teaching and gave it to the priests, sons of Levi...and to all the elders of Israel.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.31.9?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 9</a>). We find here that this matches with what is said in Eruvin, where it is evident that Yehoshua does not take part in the giving over of the Torah. However, immediately afterwards it says: \"And Moses instructed them as follows: Every seventh year...you shall read this Teaching aloud in the presence of all Israel.\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Deuteronomy.31.10-11?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 10-11</a>). It says תקרא (singular) and not תקראו (plural). Therefore, Moshe is speaking to Yehoshua specifically, who remained at Moshe's side, as the passer of the ethics of the Torah in the Hak'hel...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see, therefore, that according to Rabbi Cherki, Yehoshua was not mentioned in the \"order of teaching\" because he was not tasked with passing on the laws, but instead mentioned in Avot because he was tasked with the giving over of the ethics of the Torah.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> As for the anachronism between the \"order of teaching\" and the fact that Yehoshua was only chosen as leader at the end of Moshe's life, it's possible, in my opinion, that Yehoshua was always intended to be some sort of military leader/statesman - we see this from the fact that he was chosen by Moshe to fight the Amalekites, plus his tribe chose him to be their spy. Therefore, from the beginning he was already excluded from the role of potential law-giving elder.</p>\n\n\n",

Any change in the avodah would invalidate it. However, this particular action was something that the heretics known as tzedukim would insist on. Thus, they had to make sure that the kohen gadol (who at that time was often a political appointee) was not a secret tzeduki.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>7</strong> In the era of the Second Temple, heresy erupted in Israel, and the\nSadducees emerged, may they speedily perish, who did not believe in\nthe Oral Law and who maintained that the incense offering of Yom\nKippur would be placed on fire in the Sanctuary outside the Parochet\nand when its smoke rose up, they would bring it into the Holy of\nHolies. Their rationale was that they interpreted the Torah's phrase\nLeviticus 16:2: \"For in a cloud I will appear on the Kaporet,\"as\nreferring to the cloud of the incense offering. In contrast, according\nto the Oral Tradition, our Sages learned that the High Priest should\nnot place the incense on the coals only in the Holy of Holies, before\nthe Ark, as ibid.:13 states: \"And he shall place the incense on the\nfire before God.\" Since in the Second Temple era, the Sages suspected\nthat the High Priests would tend towards such heresy, they would have\nhim take an oath on the day preceding Yom Kippur. They would tell him:\n\"My sir, the High Priest, we are agents of the court and you are our\nagent and an agent of the court, we administer an oath to you in the\nname of He Who causes His name to dwell in this house that you not\ndeviate at all from what we told you.\"</p>\n<p>The High Priest would turn away and cry because they suspected him of\nheresy and they would turn away and cry, because they placed suspicion\non a person's whose conduct was unknown.

Yet he can't say Aneinu. In order to be able to say Aneinu and have the law of Taanis, the Shulchan Aruch says in 562:1</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל תענית שלא שקעה עליו חמה דהיינו שלא השלימו עד צאת הכוכבים דהיינו שיראה ג' כוכבים בינונים או שהלבנה זורחת בכח ותאיר על הארץ (הגהות אשירי פ\"ק דתענית והגהות מיימוני פ\"א) אינו תענית ואם דעתו לאכול קודם לכן אינו מתפלל עננו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rama argues and says one could say Aneinu if he fasted until Mincha</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הגה מיהו נוהגין להתפלל עננו אע\"פ שאין משלימין עד צאת הכוכבים וכן דעת מקצת רבוותא (תה\"ד סי' קנ\"ז) ונראה לי דדוקא ביחיד דאומר עננו בשומע תפלה דבלאו הכי יכול להוסיף כמו שנתבאר לעיל סי' קי\"ט אבל שליח ציבור לא יאמר עננו אא\"כ משלימין וכן נוהגין:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishna Berura explains the Rama:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אף על פי שאין משלימין - והא דסתם רמ\"א להקל בפירש בשעת קבלה היינו דוקא במתפלל תפלת מנחה קודם אכילתו אבל כשאכל מתחלה בכל גווני אינו מתפלל עננו:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן דעת מקצת רבוותא - טעמם דס\"ל דמה שאמר הגמרא כל תענית שלא שקעה עליו חמה אינו תענית והיינו אף לענין עננו הוא רק אם קיבל עליו להתענות יום שלם ולא השלים דאינו תענית אז אינו מתפלל עננו אבל אם קיבל עליו רק עד מנחה דהוא לצעורי בעלמא הוי תענית לענין זה שמתפלל עננו בתוך תפלתו אף שאיננו משלים אכן רוב הפוסקים חולקים ע\"ז וע\"כ הכריע רמ\"א דלא נסמוך עליה רק לענין יחיד דיאמרנה בש\"ת ויחתום כי אתה שומע וכו' ולא יאמר בא\"י העונה בעת צרה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, although he says it's just to cause pain, the Rama still holds it has some level of Taanis and one can say Aneinu</p>\n\n\n",

For instance, when the Torah is read in syangogue, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sefer_Torah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">it is read from a scroll and in Hebrew</a>. This is the standard in all communities regardless of affiliation be it Orthodox, Conservative, or Reform.</p>\n<p>There is no \"standard translation\" of the Tanakh in any branch of Judaism.

If it exceeds the other court in wisdom but not in number, or in number but not in wisdom, it cannot annul its instructions. Even if the reason for which the predecessors introduced the decree or ordinance exists no more, the successors cannot revoke anything introduced by the predecessors unless they exceed them. But how can any Supreme Court exceed another in number when each Supreme Court consists of seventy-one members? The reference is to the number of contemporary sages who have agreed to accept the decision of the Supreme Court, or have not opposed it.</p>\n<p>בַּמֶּה דְּבָרִים אֲמוּרִים? בִּדְבָרִים שֶׁלֹּא אָסְרוּ אוֹתָן כְּדֵי לַעֲשׂוֹת סְיָג לַתּוֹרָה אֶלָּא כִּשְׁאָר דִּינֵי תּוֹרָה. אֲבָל דְּבָרִים שֶׁרָאוּ בֵּית דִּין לִגְזֹר וּלְאָסְרָן לַעֲשׂוֹת סְיָג אִם פָּשַׁט אִסּוּרָן בְּכָל [יִשְׂרָאֵל] אֵין בֵּית דִּין גָּדוֹל אַחֵר יָכוֹל לְעָקְרָן וּלְהַתִּירָן אֲפִלּוּ הָיָה גָּדוֹל מִן הָרִאשׁוֹנִים:</p>\n<p>With what case are we dealing? With matters that they did not prohibit in order to create a fence [protecting from violating the laws] of the Torah, rather like the other laws of the Torah.  However, matters that the court saw to decree and prohibit in order to create [such] a fence, if their prohibition has spread in all of Israel, another high court can not uproot and allow [the decreed safeguards]  even if it is greater than the original [court that created the safeguard].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, according to Maimonides, a greater court can override general enactments as they see fit.  Notably, Maimonides concludes his <em>Yad Hachazaka</em> describing the anticipated heights of wisdom reached in the messianic age (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.12.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Laws of Kings and their Wars 12:5</a>), so the court of that time should qualify for this ability.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in terms of deriving halachos, even a later, lesser court can argue with the judicial interpretation of an earlier, greater one (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.2.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rebels 2:1</a>).</p>\n<p>With regard to Maimonides' qualifier of Rebels 2:3, it seems possible that he is referring only to the more limited case of a סייג enacted explicitly for all generations.  See for instance <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Avodah_Zarah.36a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Avoda Zara 36a</a> which Rav Yosef Kairo in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Rebels.2.3?lang=bi&with=Kessef%20Mishneh&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Kesef Mishna</a> suggests is the Rambam's source for this ruling:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר רבה בר בר חנה אמר ר' יוחנן בכל יכול לבטל בית דין דברי בית דין חבירו חוץ משמונה עשר דבר שאפילו יבא אליהו ובית דינו אין שומעין לו</p>\n<p>...Rabba bar bar Ḥana said that Rabbi Yoḥanan says: With regard to all issues, a court can void the statements of another court, except the eighteen matters decreed by the students of Beit Shammai, as, even if Elijah and his court were to come and rescind them, one would not listen to him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My understanding is that these \"18 matters\" were explicitly and (very) atypically decreed in a manner to prevent their later reversal by a greater court (upon their acceptance by most of Israel).  See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Avodah_Zarah.36a.10.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosafoth s.v. והתנן</a> citing the Jerusalem Talmud.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -5)\n\n<p>First, yes, for different reasons.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The Messiah is a king, and as such, he is absolutely unlimited in his power and authority.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Messiah is a \"super prophet\" and super wise, therefore he will preside the Sanhedrin and nobody would be able to object to him (as nobody could even object R' Gamliel, remember?)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\"Changing times\" or \"changing natures\" was one of the main reasons for centuries of rabbis to override the Talmudic prohibition of overruling previous sages. The Messiah could always claim that those are \"changing times\", and different Halochos apply in this different reality.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Messia can always invoke the edict of \"Time to do for God, to override the Torah\", and declare a state of emergency. Then he can rule anything he thinks as fit.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Second, (as I pointed out in #3 and 4) subserving to decrees of previous generations is just a dogma in Judaism, it is not a real prohibition. For centuries, rabbis ruled against previous rabbis even when they admitted their intellectual inferiority. So in fact, there's nothing in Judaism, that would prevent any renowned rabbi now (let alone the Messiah, and let alone the Sanhedrin) from ruling anything he sees as important and applicable.</p>\n\n\n",

Additionally, Rashi explains that someone who does not build a parapet could come to have someone else who deserves death fall by accident. Thus building the parapet would prevent someone else from being hurt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9986/showrashi/true#v8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 22:8</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you build a new house, you shall make a guard rail for your roof,\nso that you shall not cause blood [to be spilled] in your house, that\nthe one who falls should fall from it [the roof].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>RASHI</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>When you build a new house, [you shall make a guard-rail for your roof]:</strong> If you have fulfilled the commandment of שִׁלּוּחַ\nהַקֵּן,“sending away [the mother bird from her] nest,” you will\neventually build a new house and fulfill the commandment of מַעֲקֶה,\nguard-rail, because [the fulfillment of] one commandment pulls along\nwith it [an opportunity to fulfill] another commandment [i.e., one\ncommandment leads to another].

This is more so true for the Septuagints of the Prophets and Writings, which weren’t even translated by the elders:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Septuagint Pentateuch, which is all that is discussed [in the Letter of Aristeas], does, however, constitute an independent corpus within the Greek Bible, and it was probably first translated as a unit by a company of scholars in Alexandria about the middle of the 3rd century BCE.</p>\n<p>The Septuagint, as the entire Greek Bible came to be called, has a long and complex history and took well over a century to be completed. It is for this reason not a unified or consistent translation.\" (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/biblical-literature/Early-versions\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Britannica</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I heard once somewhere that the original Septuagint may have been lost when Caesar burned down the Library of Alexandria, but I don’t think there’s any way to truly verify that claim (unless there's a source that recorded this). Some evidence to this may be found in the time of Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer, who commissioned Aquilas the Ger to create a new Greek Targum (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Megillah.10b.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Megillah 10b</a>) – apparently because the original one could no longer be accessed in order to create exact copies. It seems that by their time, so many mistakes and subjective interpolations had been included by generations of scribes that it became necessary to start again from scratch. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Krauss\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Shmuel Krauss</a> in his essay \"<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&url=https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/api/datastream%3FpublicationPid%3Duk-ac-man-scw:1m1514%26datastreamId%3DPOST-PEER-REVIEW-PUBLISHERS-DOCUMENT.PDF&ved=2ahUKEwjSjJDKvsbyAhVnMVkFHbeJBRUQFnoECAQQAQ&sqi=2&usg=AOvVaw2sroneUpaUwPhI84UIcPLv\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Two Hitherto Unknown Bible Versions In Greek</a>\" suggests that there may have been more than one new Jewish Greek Targum around this time, and at least one of these was created by ben-Tigla (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kohelet_Rabbah.12.12.1?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kohelet Rabbah 12:12</a>).</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Christians continued using the older targums, or else went about creating new ones, but did not yet see a need to create a uniform version. By the time we arrive in the early Amoraic period, there were dozens, perhaps hundreds of different Greek targums floating around with many errors and subjective interpolations (see for example <a href=\"https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.iv.lxxii.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Justin Martyr's claim</a> that the Jews removed verses from the Tanach – evidence of verses added in by Christians (the verses don't make sense in context and obviously are only there to show that Jesus is in Tanach)). It was around the time of Rabban Gamliel III, son of Rebbi (who, by the way, is alluded to <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0414.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), that the Church Father <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origen\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Origen</a> realized that the significant differentiation between the targums was causing problems in terms of understanding the Bible within the Christian community, and so set out to create a new Septuagint, called the Hexapla:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Despite the tradition that it was perfectly translated, there are large differences in style and usage between the Septuagint’s translation of the Torah and its translations of the later books in the Old Testament. In the 3rd century CE Origen attempted to clear up copyists’ errors that had crept into the text of the Septuagint, which by then varied widely from copy to copy, and a number of other scholars consulted the Hebrew texts in order to make the Septuagint more accurate.\" (<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Britannica</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Hexapla consisted of six columns of text: The Hebrew, the Hebrew transliterated in Greek letters, three different Greek targums and a recension, a combined version of all of the three targums used by Origen. Unfortunately (for Christians and academic scholars), most later scribes only copied the combined version and not the earlier, uncombined versions. A later Church Father, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucian_of_Antioch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lucian</a>, and a non-Christian, <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesychius_of_Alexandria\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hesychius</a>, also attempted to create Septuagint recensions as well.</p>\n<p>The sages were certainly aware of these new Septuagintal projects. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuvein_Margolies\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Reuven Margolies</a> in his essay \"The Sages of the Talmud and the LXX\" (המקרא והמסורה, pg. 59–62) brings eight examples of places in which the sages hinted at knowledge of the new Septuagints. For example:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosefta_Bava_Kamma.6.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosefta Bava Kama 6:7</a>: Rabbi Yossi said in the name of Rabbi Yishmael: \"In the first commandments it says: \"You and your son and your daughter and your ox and your donkey and all of your livestock\", the ox and the donkey are included in livestock, so why were they excluded? To teach etc\", yet it's interesting that before us, in the first commandments, it doesn't say \"ox and donkey\"; only the LXX translated based on the second commandments: βοῦς σου καὶ τὸ ὑποζύγιόν σου καὶ πᾶν κτῆνός (Your ox and your donkey and every beast).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We find, therefore, that the Amoraim were aware of the new translations but weren’t able to pull out the original to point out the faults in the new ones. What they had was their era’s Masoretic Text and the tradition of the list of changes that the 72 elders made in the original Septuagint (note that Aquilas or any other translator didn't need to adhere to the changes made by the 72 elders because they were made due to the fact that the translation was commissioned by Ptolemy).</p>\n<p>Fast-forward to the time of Rashi and the Tosfot: While I don’t have proof right now that Rashi didn’t have a Septuagint in front of him, it wouldn’t surprise me that he didn't have one for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>In Eruvin 65a <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rashi_on_Eruvin.65a.10.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">he attributes</a> the verse \"בצר אל יורה\" to \"possibly ben Sira\". As this verse does not exist in ben Sira, we see that he did not have ben Sira before him (and this is also understood from his phrasing of \"possibly\" (שמא)). Moreover, he did not go to any neighboring Christian libraries to check their copies of ben Sira. I would say that the same would have been the case with the Septuagint or any other book that was only available at the time in Greek.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>I doubt Rashi knew enough Greek to be able to read the Septuagint in any case. No evidence specifically for Rashi, but there's some pieces of evidence that the Tosafists didn’t know Greek (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/26897/secular-studies-in-the-rhineland-academies-of-the-11th-13th-centuries/120610#120610\">here</a>), and since they came from the same school of thought and the same area of Europe, I think that the same could be said of Rashi (I'm aware Rashbam knew Latin, though).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It's important to note that although the number of differences between the modern LXXs and the MT is much more significant than those between the original LXX and the MT, and the differences in the lists are mostly not the same ones, there's at least one difference recorded in the gemara and midrashim as pertaining to the original LXX that was preserved within the new one(s) – that of <a href=\"https://www.internationalstandardbible.com/H/hare.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the change from \"hare\" to \"hairy-legged/rough-footed\"</a> (ואת שעירת הרגלים, spelled צעירת In some versions, see <a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/42265348/Avigdor_Victor_Aptowitzer_Die_rabbinischen_Berichte_uber_die_Entstehung_der_Septuaginta_ha_Kedem_vol_2_1908_11_27?email_work_card=title\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, pg. 13, footnote 1). So while some scholars and/or Christians may be left scratching their heads about the usage of a rarer synonym for \"hare\" - Jews at least know the reason for this. At the same time, we have evidence that the later Septuagints still contain traces of the first one.</p>\n\n\n",

He also rejects the possibility that it was referring to a different place, based on geographical support:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קשה איך כבר בימי אברהם או לכל הפחות בימי משה הכותב נקראת העיר על שם דן אולי היתה שם עיר מימים קדמונים וטרם הקראה בשם לשם ליש או דן (יהושע י\"ז שופטים י\"ח) קראוה בשם אחר בלתי נודע והסופרים תקנו והחליפו השם הקדמון במחודש להקל ההבנה לפי שטוב מכל מקום להניח שיהיה תיקון סופרים מלהניח שנכתב כל סיפור זה כמה שנים אחרי מות משה ושהיתה שם עיר אחרת בלתי ליש ששמה דן דבר רחוק הוא ומושב עיר דן בקצה האחרון לצד צפונית (דברים ל\"ד:א' ובכמה מקומות) מכוון יפה למסופר כאן וכמהלך שעה אחת מעיר Banias (היא ליש או דן הקדמונית) נמצא מקום בשם Meschad el Tir שענינו בערבי ברית הצפור (ואת הצפור לא בתר בראשית ט\"ו:י') ויש קבלה ביד אנשי המקום ששם כרת ה' עם אברהם ברית בין הבתרים (הח׳ שווארץ בספרו תבואות הארץ)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Between these commentators we have three possible approaches:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Torah called the place Dan prophetically.</li>\n<li>The Torah referred to a different place which was actually called Dan at the time the events occurred.</li>\n<li>The Torah originally called the place by it's name at that time, and the text was later updated to reflect the current name.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8209/showrashi/true#v14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">LECH LECHA 14:14</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Abram heard that his kinsman had been taken captive, he mustered\nhis retainers, born into his household, numbering three hundred and\neighteen, and went in pursuit as far as Dan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>is not an anachronism as it was written in the time of Moshe and is describing the history of Avraham.

Why there is a difference, given that both texts where taken from the same tables?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>This is a great question that all the commentators deal with directly or indirectly. A related question is what is meant when the verse in Devarim says,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שָׁמ֛֣וֹר אֶת־י֥וֹם֩ הַשַּׁבָּ֖֨ת לְקַדְּשׁ֑֜וֹ <strong>כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוְּךָ֖֣ ׀ יְהֹוָ֥֣ה אֱלֹהֶֽ֗יךָ</strong>׃<br />\nObserve the sabbath day and keep it holy, <strong>as the LORD your God has commanded you.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Ibn Ezra interprets this phrase to be referring back to the original commandment in Shemos. So the Torah says, \"Keep the Shabbos as I commanded you already\", and the reason would be because of the six days of Creation and G-d resting on the seventh, as it says there. The Exodus from Egypt is only mentioned to explain why one's servants also have to rest.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This explanation does not work in Rashi, who understands that phrase to be referring to the commandments the Jews received at Marah before the revelation at Sinai. Rashi does not address your question directly, but he comments on the verse in Devarim saying:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וזכרת כי עבד היית וגו'. עַל מְנָת כֵּן פְּדָאֲךָ שֶׁתִּהְיֶה לוֹ עֶבֶד וְתִשְׁמֹר מִצְווֹתָיו:<br />\nOn this condition you were redeemed, that you would be a servant to him and keep his commandments.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This comment is explained by the Sifsei Chachamim as being related to the prohibition for labor:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He freed you on the condition, etc. Because Hashem knows that it is difficult for them to abstain from work. We find this regarding Purim, that they accepted upon themselves a day of drinking and rejoicing, but not for [abstaining from] work (Maseches Megillah 5b). Therefore, he mentions to them that they were slaves. That is to say, when a master tells his slave to abstain from work, it is only right that the slave obeys him because the work [he does] is only for his master. Otherwise, why is slavery mentioned here? [Maharai].</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in Shemos, where it discusses the concept of זכור/<em>zachor</em> remembering the concept of Shabbos and keeping its positive commandments, the Torah gives the basic reason of Shabbos, which is to remember the seven days of Creation. In Devarim, where the Torah discusses שמור/<em>shamor</em>, keeping the negative commandments, the Torah mentions the Exodus from Egypt to explain why one must observe the prohibitions against doing labor despite the difficulty involved.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Ramban adds another factor, which is that in Kiddush we say that Shabbos is זכר ליציאת מצרים, a remembrance to the Exodus from Egypt. This indicates that Yetzias Mitzrayim is more fundamental to Shabbos. He quotes the Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed%2C_Part_2.31.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Moreh Nevuchim</a> who says that there are basically two purposes to the Shabbos: First, to remember and honor that day, as it says in Devarim; second, to rest on the Sabbath in contrast to the slavery in Egypt when Jews could not rest from their labors. [As with Rashi, the first reason fits better with zachor, the second with shamor.]\nThis approach is also endorsed by Abarbanel and Bechor Shor.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The Ramban argues on the Rambam because he feels that just not doing melacha is not an adequate way to remember the Exodus from Egypt. Instead, he resolves the contradiction by means of his oft-stated principle that the Exodus from Egypt demonstrated that G-d created and completely controls the world. Thus, focusing on the Exodus (per Devarim) <em>reinforces</em> the reason of remembering that G-d created the world (as per Shemos).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Read the context carefully between the two Ten Commandments texts.</p>\n<p>Exodus: <code>God rested on the seventh day, *therefore* He blessed the seventh day.</code></p>\n<p>(Why is the seventh day special? Because of creation.)</p>\n<p>(Okay but why should the Jews specifically keep the Sabbath?)</p>\n<p>Deuteronomy: <code>Remember you were slaves in Egypt, *therefore* God commanded you to keep the Sabbath.</code></p>\n\n\n",

[Deut. 23:2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The parenthetical remark in Sefaria says that Ashkenazim put a heh at the end of daka instead of an aleph.  Does this variation affect the meaning of the verse in any way?  (This is the only place where daka, in the meaning of testicle, appears in the Torah.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Torah shows sensitivity, as it avoids using the word for <em>testes</em> in this case as to avoid potentially foul language, it uses a euphemism instead. The spelling of the word has been extensively discussed by <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Shai_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.23.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Minchas Shai commentary</a>. But he does not reveal any change in meaning. Since one of the forms דַּכָּ֛א that Minchas Shai discusses is from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.90.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehilim 90:3</a>, where it is a <em>noun</em> meaning dust/pulp, it is logical to assume that either forms דכא or דכה in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 23:2</a> is a noun or a gerund with פְצֽוּעַ being a participle <em>wounded</em> turned into noun or gerund to make a smikhut: <em>wounded of crushing</em>.</p>\n<p>According to \"Etymologycal dictionary of Hebrew\" by Ernest Klein, דַּכָּ֛א has root דכא meaning <em>crush</em> and דַּכָּ֛ה has root דכה, which also identically means crush (Although it is not clear why there exist two words with the same meaning, unless one is Aramaic). The <em>Etymological Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew</em> by Matittyahu Clark, however, interprets the word דַּכָּ֛ה as <em>squeezing</em> not <em>crushing</em>, which is a slight change in meaning. Clark's dictionary claims to implement methodology of Rav S. R. Hirsch, however some readings in it might be hypothetical. One could also interpret דכה as female adjective turned into a noun from the root דכך, which has meaning of a violent crushing, indicating emasculation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here's a wild, albeit interesting guess: either דכא or דכה does not mean literally testicle, they both mean \"severely or badly distressed\", throughout Tanach.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>As you know, א and ה were very highly interchangeable both in Tanach and Mishnah (for example, קורה instead of קורא).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>A fast search through Sefaria \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%90&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=chronological&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דכא</a>\" and \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%93%D7%9B%D7%94&tab=text&tvar=1&tsort=chronological&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">דכה</a>\" reveals that both mean \"severely or badly distressed\".</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Torah already knows the word for testes- \"אשך\", see \"אוֹ מְרוֹחַ אָשֶׁךְ\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.21.20?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Targum%20Jonathan%20on%20Leviticus&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lev.21.20</a>), and none of the Targumim on \"פְצֽוּעַ־דַּכָּ֛א\" hints on testes.</p>\n<p>So, in conclusion, indeed the Torah does not say \"testes\" at all, it's the oral tradition, and there's no difference in the meaning of דכא or דכה in the Tanach.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The better manuscripts have an א but there's absolutely no difference.

Her neighbor was a non-Jew who was impressed by her middot. One day, a Roman legion passed through Lod and kidnapped Sarah, planning on making her a slave in Rome. Her neighbor decided to try to save her. He followed her all the way to Rome. Shortly after arriving in Rome, he wandered outside of the city. He came upon a hunter whom he recognized as the son of the emperor. The hunter attempted to kill a lion, but the lion attacked him. The man grabbed a stick and beat the lion, until it turned and ran away. The prince was badly injured, and so the man did for him what he could and then carried him back to the city. The royal doctors managed to save his life. Grateful, the emperor asked the man what he could do for him. The man requested he let Sarah return with him to Judea. The emperor agreed. Upon returning, the man, still impressed by Sarah's middot and faith, decided to convert. He changed his name to Yosef and studied for five years. After that, he married Sarah. Shortly after she became pregnant, Yosef passed away. Sarah decided to move to Yerushalayim, where she became a cook in Kalba Savua's household. While there, her son Akiva was born, and he grew up and became a shepherd in the household (and the rest is history...).</p>\n<p>I had never heard this story before. Does anyone know where this appears?</p>\n<p>Edit: As stated in <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/130977/what-is-the-sefer-ruach-chen-mentioned-by-rabbi-mashash?noredirect=1&lq=1\">this question</a>, the story was slightly popularized through its appearance in the book Nachalat Avot by Rabbi Mashash. He stated it he found it in a book called \"Ruach Chen\", which is not the more well-known commentary on Moreh Nevuchim. I have not yet managed to identify the book. Any information on the book or other sources that mention the story would be greatly appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>One part of the story that could be corroborated, is the fact that R' Akiva came from a convert (although it may not of been his father, possibly a grandfather).

Rav Nissim Gaon in Brachos 27b says this was R' Akiva (it seems he had this language in his Gemara)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>נוקי לר' עקיבא לית ליה זכות אבות. איתה בסנהדרין בפרק כל ישראל יש להן חלק (דף צו) מבני בניו של סיסרא למדו תורה בירושלים ומאן אינון ר' עקיבא ואיתה נמי בפ' הניזקין דמסכת גיטין (דף נז):</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

One famous example has to do with the rocks that Yaakov put under his head.

This switch even happens mid verse in some cases.</p>\n<p>I know that some of the switches are functions of grammar (the the Sh'ma verse, Moshe speaks to the people as a singular so the verb is \"sh'ma\" and not \"shim'u\", but then includes himself at the end of the posuk saying Hashem is OUR God) and some, I have heard reflect a more homiletic approach (one people with one heart explains the singular while division or a lack of spiritual focus points to the plural).</p>\n<p>Is there any comprehensive treatment of the shift between singular and plural through Tanach as it relates to the nation, explaining the reason for the switch (through reference to grammar, logic or medrash)?</p>\n\n\n",

If you intend to have enough, either when you start or in the middle of eating before you finish (or say a Bracha Achrona), then it is considered eaten together. If you intended to finish eating (or made a Bracha Achrona) then  it would be a new start after that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>איתא בגמרא (מ\"ב.) דפת הבאה בכיסנים מברך עליו 'בורא מיני מזונות' ולא 'המוציא', ומהו פת הבאה בכיסני יתבאר לפנינו. אך זהו כשאוכלם אכילת עראי, אבל כשקובע סעודה עליהם - מברך 'המוציא' וברכת המזון וטעון נטילת ידים. ואם בתחלה היה בדעתו לאכול מעט ובירך 'בורא מיני מזונות' ואחר כך אכל הרבה - צריך לברך ברכת המזון. וזהו אם לא נמלך בתחלת אכילתו לאכול הרבה אלא שכן היה שאכל הרבה, דממילא לא שייך כאן ברכת 'המוציא' ונטילת ידים. <strong>ואפילו אם באמצע אכילתו נמלך לאכול הרבה, מכל מקום כשלא נשאר מזמן ההמלכה עד סוף אכילתו שיעור קביעת סעודה</strong> - אין צריך ליטול ידיו ולברך 'המוציא', אבל אם בתחלת אכילתו נמלך לאכול הרבה - צריך ליטול ידיו ולברך 'המוציא' (וזהו כוונת המגן אברהם סקי\"ד).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is said in the Gemara (Brachot 42a) that bread which comes as dessert, one blesses over it \"who creates kinds of nourishment\" and not \"Who brings [bread from the earth]\", and what bread which comes as dessert is will be explained shortly. So, [our previous ruling is in effect] specifically when one eats it casually, but when one bases a meal on bread which comes as dessert, one blesses \"Who brings [bread from the earth]\" and [after eating] the blessing of the meal, and it requires washing of the hands. And if one originally intended to eat a little, and blessed \"Who creates many types of nourishment\", and then ate much -- one needs to bless the blessing of the meal. And this is in a case where one did not decide at the beginning of eating to eat a lot, and then it happened that one ate a lot, in which case the blessing of \"Who brings [forth bread from the earth]\" and hand-washing would not be appropriate. <strong>And even if, in the middle of one's eating, one changed one's mind and decided to eat a lot, nevertheless when from the time of the decision until the end of the eating there does not remain enough time to 'fix a meal'</strong> -- it's not necessary to wash one's hands and to bless \"Who brings\". But if one changed one's mind and decided to eat a lot at the beginning of one's eating, one does need to wahs one's hands (and this was the intention of the Magen Avraham on Shulchan Aruch, Orach Chayim 114)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, he says later on that it may be dependent on <em>the way</em> you eat not the amount you eat. He says this in defense of those who eat a lot by Kiddushim and do not make Hamotzai or Birchas Hamazon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודע שכמה גדולים צעקו ככרוכיא על מה שנתפשט בדורינו בכל המדינה שבעת איזה שמחה עורכים שלחן עם כמה מיני דגים וכמה מיני בשר, ואוכלים עם פת הבאה בכיסנין ואוכלים בלא נטילת ידים ובלא 'המוציא' וברכת המזון, אלא בברכת 'מזונות' ולבסוף 'על המחיה', ואוכלים הרבה מאוד מהגלוסקאות ומחלה האפוי על שמן שקורין בוימי\"ל חלה. ואין שום ספק בזה דצריכין ליטול ידיהם ו'המוציא' וברכת המזון, ואפילו אם יזהרו שלא לאכול הרבה מהפת, מכל מקום הא לדעת הגדולים שבסעיף הקודם אם שבעו מהלפתן חייבים ליטול ידיהם וכו' אף כשאוכלים מעט פת, ובוודאי כד' ביצים אוכלים. ורק מעט מהיריאים נזהרים בישבם על שלחן כזה לבלי לאכול הרבה, או שנוטלים ידיהם ומברכים 'המוציא' על פת סתם, אבל רוב המון ישראל אין שומרים עצמם מזה. על כן בוודאי חלילה לעשות כן, אך אין בידינו למחות כידוע. (וכדי ללמד קצת זכות נראה לעניות דעתי קולא מלשון הרי\"ף בעניין זה, שכתב בזה הלשון: \"מסקנא: היכא דאכל לה בתורת כיסנין מברך 'בורא מיני מזונות' וכו', והיכא דאכל לה בתורת קביעותא - מברך עליה 'המוציא' וג' ברכות\" עכ\"ל. ומשמע מלשונו דאינו תלוי בשיעור קביעת הסעודה אלא באופן האכילה, בין ההכנה לאכילת עראי ובין ההכנה לאכילת קבע. וזה ידוע שבאכילת סעודה גמורה פושטין הבגדים העליונים ויושבים סביב השלחן, אבל באכילות אלו חוטפין ואוכלין כמה שהן בלי הכנה, ויש אוכלין מעומד ומהלך כידוע וסוברים דזה לא מקרי קביעת סעודה. וזה שאמרו בגמרא: \"כל שאחרים קובעין וכו'” צריך לדחוק לפירוש זה גם כן באופן שכתבנו, וכל ירא אלקים ירחק את עצמו מזה, והוא רחום יכפר עון).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=31039&st=&pgnum=57\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Birchas Habayis (9:4)</a> also agrees with the Aruch Hashulchan and further, clearly states that once you were מסיח דעת or made a Bracha Achrona then you are considered to be starting over and it is not מצרף.</p>\n\n\n",

(Shulchan Aruch EH 4:3-8)</p>\n<p>Traditionally, the Assyrian king Sancheriv mixed up the nations of the Middle East during his conquests and therefore we don't know anymore who is a genetic Edomite; thus any gentile coming to convert can be assumed to come from the majority of non-Edomites.

However, if we assume that not all items are not cooked e.g. aside for the soup mix there is also vegetables like peas and corn present inside, at first glance if this is the case, you should pour the water using a keli sheini. BUT, although we don't normally say there is bishul with a keli sheini, when it comes to kalei habishul (i.e. things that are cooked very easily e.g. tea) you can argue that the items in the tradition soup are indeed kalei habishul and a keli sheini would not suffice. Rav Moshe Feinstein is meikel that when making tea one can use a keli shelishi - and thus if you hold like this, a keli shelishi would work to make these tradition soup.</p>\n<p>Makeh B'Patish - There is a halachic discussion as to whether this melacha is applicable to foods. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.318.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 318</a> says you can't pour hot water on a raw fish as the action helps to complete the food - \"והדחתן היא גמר מלאכתן\".</p>\n<p>The Rema there adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וה\"ה כל דבר קשה שאינו ראוי לאכול כלל בלא שרייה דאסור לשרותו בשבת דהוי גמר מלאכה</p>\n<p>This rule applies to all hard foods that cannot be eaten without first marinating them. Therefore one may not soak them (in hot water) on Shabbos, as it is a completion of a Melacha.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Wosner zt\"l in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1418&st=&pgnum=53&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Shevet HaLevi, cheilek 8, siman 63</a> concludes on this Rema that we do say גמר מלאכתן on food. Rav Wosner over there is specifically speaking about cubes of soup mix that would be considered makeh b'patish. So arguably, even if we consider all the ingredients as being cooked, plus using a keli shelishi, we would still have to say that the hot water is transforming it from an inedible object to a now edible food i.e. it is now ראוי לאכילה (fitting to eat).</p>\n<p>He says that we can argue that not everyone holds this way, so we don't have to rely on this Rav Wosner. Although he notes that Rav Shechter is machmir and says that we do say makeh b'patish applies to food. However, he says that Rav Shechter counters that these Tradition Soups in their initial state are actually edible and therefore he feels that Makeh B'patish would not apply to these soups.</p>\n<p>Obviously, best practise is to ask your LOR.</p>\n\n\n",

The money that is withheld for tax purposes is not counted for ma'aser. As a matter of fact, any money that one receives, even if it is tax free is subject to ma'aaser.

    "title": "If revenge is prohibited, how can there be business contracts?",
    "content": "# If revenge is prohibited, how can there be business contracts?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Rambam brings this down in his discussion of the <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/940341/jewish/Negative-Commandment-304.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">negative commandment of revenge</a> :</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the words of the Sifra, \"How far does the prohibition against\ntaking revenge go? If a person requests, 'Lend me your sickle,' and\nthe other won't lend it; and tomorrow [the latter] requests, 'Lend me\nyour ax,' and he answers, 'I won't lend to you just as you didn't lend\nme your sickle.' In this case the Torah says, 'Do not take revenge.'\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But consider this scenario : two people A and B draft a business contract, A will deliver a shipment of axes to B by a certain date, and upon receipt B will deliver a shipment of sickles to A. When the deadline passes and A fails to deliver, B says \"You didn't fulfill your part of the deal, so I won't fulfill mine\".</p>\n<p>So we have :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\"I won't lend to you just as you didn't lend me your sickle\" - Forbidden because of revenge</li>\n<li>\"I won't fulfill my part of the deal, just as you didn't fulfill yours\" - (seemingly) Permitted because it's just a commonplace business dealing</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But how and why are these two cases intrinsically different?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Perhaps this category of (prohibited) action of revenge is when one avoids doing something that benefits another person, <strong>which one would ordinarily do</strong>, because of a grudge or negative deed done by that other person.  So in the example you give, if Ploni asks his friend Yosef to lend him his axe, ordinarily Yosef would lend his axe to a friend. In that case, Yosef is not allowed to change that favorable behavior based on some act that Ploni performed in the past (failure to loan a sickle); that would be issur revenge.</p>\n<p>Similarly, Yosef would not, ordinarily, punch Ploni in the nose. If Ploni has just rudely stepped on Yosef's foot, Yosef is still forbidden to punch him in the nose; to do so would be taking revenge.  But the Rambam would not need to mention that case, because it involves a positive action that Yosef is forbidden to do in the first place.</p>\n<p>Here is the intrinsic difference between your two cases (the second being the incomplete business transaction):</p>\n<p>Yosef would not ordinarily, out of the blue, deliver a load of his own axes as a gift a casual friend.  That sort of action would never happen absent some sort of incentive (for example, Ploni sending Yosef a box of sickles).  Therefore, the type of revenge that the Rambam forbids here doesn't apply in the case of such a transaction.</p>\n\n\n",

When there is persecution, they shall be fast days.  When there is no persecution but not yet peace, [these fasts are optional].

Neither of those obtains nowadays. (Note that, by contrast, Zechariah's prophecy was while the Second Temple was being rebuilt - it was completed two years later - and later during the Second Temple era there were periods when the Jews had full independence.)</p>\n<p>As for the second question, which is where Rav Papa's three-way distinction (peace, persecution, or neither) comes in - for that we have <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=oc_x2905\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avraham, Orach Chaim 550:1</a>, who says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אע\"ג דמדינא בזמן שאין סכנה אין חייבי' להתענות אלא בט\"ב מ\"מ כיון שנהגו להתענות כולם אסור לפרוץ גדר</p>\n<p>Even though legally, when there's no danger, we're not required to fast except on Tisha B'Av, nonetheless since everyone has made it customary to fast, one may not \"breach the fence.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(To be sure, as Shalom noted in comments, that's a consequence, not a punishment, and it applies even if she was raped.)</p>\n<p>As for actual punishments: if it was in a marital relationship (and with her consent), then Rambam <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/960660/jewish/Issurei-Biah-Chapter-Twelve.htm#v1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 12:1</a> states that she's liable to lashes by biblical law, although Shulchan Aruch <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/tursa.aspx?a=eh_x7541\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid. 16:1</a> cites a dissenting opinion. If it was a casual relationship (and again, she consented to it), then I'm not sure: Rambam and Shulchan Aruch there say that a Jewish man who has such relations with a non-Jewish woman is subject to lashes by rabbinical law, but they don't say anything about the converse case.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Is a child born to a Jewish father and non-Jewish mother, considered a non-Jew in the same regard as a child born to two non-Jewish parents?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I thought to myself it must be, in general, considered differently in Judaism, but I haven't found written sources for that yet. Is the first considered differently in the Torah than the second?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Judaism is a very law based religion, and just like any society based on laws there are subdivisions that can add context. A child born of a religiously Jewish father and non Jewish mother is <strong>not considered</strong> Jewish. This is the law on the books for normative Jewish law.</p>\n<p>Having said that, there are some subtleties to the situation which have practical ramifications. In many Middle Eastern Jewish communities for example, if there was a Jewish man from the community who married a non Jewish woman the relationship was not initially accepted by the community. However, if the man continued to attend services, and his wife showed devotion to Judaism within the community, then the community would make conversion for her much easier if she was to become pregnant. Because there is an idea that we want to keep the seed of Israel ongoing.</p>\n<p>This \"seed of Israel\" concept has been officially coined for situations in which a child is born to a Jewish father and non Jewish mother. Certain Rabbis have argued in the past that conversions for these children should be made easier, especially if these children are raised practicing Judaism. I will now quote an answer from another question that applies here and provide a link at the end:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Tzvi Hirsch Kalischer was the first to coin the phrase: Zera\nYisrael</p>\n<p>Rabbi Kalischer used this in reference to someone born to a non-Jewish\nmother but had a jewish father. He referred to them as Zera Kadosh -\nHoly Lineage. However, Rabbi Kalischer did not use it in a halachic\ncontext.</p>\n<p>The most vocal and bold Halachist to apply this concept was the Former\nSephardic Chief Rabbi of the State of Israel Rav Ben Zion Meir Chai\nUziel (שו”ת משפטי עוזיאל, כרך ב יו”ד סי’ נב) who argued that the\nconcept of Zera Yisrael is considered so legitimate that it can be\napplied to determine lineage. For example, if the non Jew -zera\nYisrael father is a Kohen, despite his mother being a gentile, once he\nconverts his \"zera Yisrael\" kicks in and he is considered a full\nfledged Kohen and can partake in the many benefits/ prohibitions that\napply to Kohanim.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Uziel was deeply concerned about the fate of children born to a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother. Such children, although of\nJewish stock (zera Yisrael), are in fact not halakhically Jewish.\nChildren raised in such intermarriages will be lost to the Jewish\npeople entirely. Thus, it is obligatory for rabbis to convert the\nnon-Jewish mother in order to keep the children in the Jewish fold.\nRabbi Uziel noted: “And I fear that if we push them [the children]\naway completely by not accepting their parents for conversion, we\nshall be brought to judgment and they shall say to us: ‘You did not\nbring back those who were driven away, and those who were lost you did\nnot seek.’ (Yehezkel 34:4).”</p>\n<p>Some (source for quote above as well) have argued that the concept of\nZera Yisrael is also used as a justification to streamline the\nconversion process. Where traditionally a certain amount of time is\ngiven in order to bring the prospective convert up to speed in torah\nknowledge, or acclimation to an observance life, as well as to discern\ntheir true motivation for conversion. Some have argued that in the\ncase of a Zera yisrael, we speed up the process and accept them right\naway as it is a mitzvah to bring that back under The Wings of the\nSchechina.</p>\n<p>However, this concept (if legitimate) is only limited to those that\nare literal descendants of Jewish lineage.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/73864/9045\">https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/73864/9045</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Great question! Given that your question has orthodox tagged in, I assume you want an approach of Jewish law. In Judaism, matrilineal descent can be the only defining factor of a persons Jewish status (unless geirus), regardless of whether the father is an \"observant\" Jew or not, the children can never be Jewish unless they convert and until then they do, they are completely as non-Jews as a person born to 2 non-Jewish parents.  Matrilineal descent is evidenced by when Ezra returned back from exile he returned and saw many of the Jewish men taking non-Jewish wives, he then cried out and as the verse states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“Now then, let us make a covenant with our G‑d to expel all these\nwomen and those who have been born to them, in accordance with the\nbidding of the Lord and of all who are concerned over the commandment\nof our G‑d, and let the Torah be obeyed.” aka those that are born to\nnon-Jewish women are expelled from being considered Jewish.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second and most compelling explanation is found:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter\nto his son, and you shall not take his daughter for your son. <em>For he\nwill turn away your son from following Me</em>, and they will worship the\ngods of others, and the wrath of G‑d will be kindled against you, and\nHe will quickly destroy you.- Deuteronomy 7:4</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whilst all marriages between Jews and a non-Jew is forbidden and not considered a marriage this special mention of marrying non-Jewish women turning away your son from following G-d means that they are not considered Jewish once they are born to a non-Jewish woman.</p>\n<p>In terms of conversion, it is much easier to convert and exposure to Judaism helps inform the beis din that you are serious and know what you are talking about.</p>\n<p>I hope I helped and feel free to ask more questions.</p>\n<p>Please read this for further reading:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/601092/jewish/Why-Is-Jewishness-Matrilineal.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/601092/jewish/Why-Is-Jewishness-Matrilineal.htm</a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It depends on a number of factors, in Orthodox Judaism yes you would be considered fully non-Jewish. However they'll often give you an easier time if you want to convert.</p>\n<p>In Reform Judaism if you were raised Jewish with either of your parents being Jewish than they consider you a Jew.</p>\n<p>In Conservative Judaism it's a more complex question that depends on the community.</p>\n\n\n",

In fact according to Kabbalah a person's soul is divided into five levels of which each one represents a higher part.

Just looking.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The answer to your question is, yes, one is <strong>not allowed</strong> to even glance (3) at the normally-covered parts of a woman's body (which is the basic halachic definition of \"erva\"/\"nakedness\", and includes also the hair of a married/widowed/divorced woman, and a woman's singing voice), even if one isn't trying to derive enjoyment from the glance<sup>2</sup>.</p>\n<p>If the looking is \"leering\" or \"gazing\" (1 or 2) i.e. deliberate watching/staring, and the woman is forbidden to him, then it is forbidden <em>even if she is appropriately dressed</em> (if he knows her, then even if one isn't looking at <em>her</em>, but just looking at her clothes!)<sup>3</sup>.</p>\n<p>With regards to all of this, known as \"<em>shemirat enayim</em>\" (guarding one's eyes), the consensus is it is <em>d'oraita</em><sup>4</sup>. See the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sefer_HaMitzvot%2C_Negative_Commandments.47.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefer HaMitzvot Negative Mitzvah 47</a><sup>5</sup>. All the more so if she is inappropriately dressed.</p>\n<p>It is based off of Bamidbar 15:39:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא תתורו אחרי לבבכם ואחרי עיניכם אשר אתם זונים אחריהם</p>\n<p>Do not follow your heart and eyes after which you are going astray.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.4.4\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hilchot Teshuva 4:4</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Someone who looks at forbidden women will think that there is no problem, since he will say: “Did I have intercourse or draw close to her?”  But he does not know that looking is a great sin.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<h4>Exceptions</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is permissible to look (3) at a woman when talking to her, if he does not do so for the purposes of enjoying her appearance<sup>2</sup>, and certainly he must not look at <em>ervah</em>. Following the advice of Rabbeinu Yonah in Sefer HaYira (starting from Vayetze mibeit hakneset), as a precaution one should minimise the looking to avoid improper thoughts coming against one's will.</li>\n<li>It is permissible for a male doctor to look (3) at a female patient, even her normally covered parts, as part of his examination and treatment - he is totally absorbed in his work and therefore the authorities permitted it<sup>6</sup>.</li>\n<li>We are less strict about gazing (2) at one's mother, daughter and sister, as well as any Jewish girl under the age of 11, although of course lustful thoughts are completely forbidden even here<sup>7</sup>.</li>\n<li>A man looking to marry may look at (2) and intentionally examine the beauty of his suitors, in order to determine if he finds them attractive. This is not only permitted, but fitting, as one is not allowed to marry someone he is not attracted to. Once this is determined he may continue looking at her while they continue to meet before marriage, but he must avoid deriving pleasure from her beauty<sup>8</sup>.</li>\n<li>One may look at one's wife (2) during the time of Niddah<sup>9</sup>, as she will become permissible to him soon so we are not worried about anything improper. However, he may not look at her nakedness i.e. parts that are normally covered, including her hair.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h4>David's Looking at Bat Sheva</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tractate_Soferim.9.10\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tractate Soferim 9:10</a> and others (e.g. Or HaChaim on Vayikra 18:2, 11, Rashi on Tehillim 17:3, 2) hold it against David.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.107a.5\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 107a</a> describes it as a deliberate test, and David saw her by accident (Satan tricked him). The sin came as a result.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.11.2\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Malbim blames him</a> - once he accidentally saw, he didn't look away from the evil, however Malbim writes much to defend David overall in Shmuel Bet 11, against Abarbanel on the same.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>There are commentaries that discuss also how David didn't really sin with Bat Sheva, at least not in the way that is commonly understood<sup>10</sup>. We don't like to venerate adulterers, so many feel the need to find a deeper more Divine message in the story of David and Bat Sheva.</p>\n<p>There is a concept whereby holiness must be concealed in order that we should have free will<sup>11</sup>. God is recreating the whole world every instant, and at the very time He is creating me, I am able to not see Him and one might even deny Him (<em>chas veshalom</em>). In Kabbalah and Chassidus, the claim is made that the <em>most holy</em> needs to be the <em>most concealed</em> (see shiur quoted below, I can look up <em>ma'amarim</em> on this if anyone is interested); in order to conceal a lamp, one needs nothing but a piece of thick paper, but in order to conceal the sun, one has to build a building. When something is so holy that it would take away our free will in an instant, it must be buried in the darkest of places.</p>\n<p>This concept is applied to anything related to the development and process of the coming of Moshiach, a very great light. David HaMelech, and Shlomo HaMelech are the grandfathers of Moshiach, and thus the birth of Shlomo was concealed by a great darkness - the apparent adultery of his father (see also story of Yehuda and Tamar, Ruth etc).</p>\n<p>These facts are less commonly known about the story:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All husbands would divorce their wives when going to war<sup>12</sup>, so Bat Sheva was not married.</li>\n<li>Her husband, Uriah, had committed an act of treason (insulted the King) and the punishment was death. David had actually forgone that and instead sent him out to the front lines of war.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So this is not technically a sin.

While it IS considered a sin for laymen, for the leaders of the nation it is a deep understanding of genuine divine will camouflaged as a sin.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -6)\n\n<p>I don't believe it's inherently sinful to watch a naked woman. But I am drawing a distinct difference between sin and forbidden by halakhah. Halakha forbids a man from even walking by the door of a prostitute or a promiscuous woman, but if he did walk by I doubt God would mark that as a sin against him. But walking past the door is halakhically forbidden because it's so easy for a sin to arise that it's best to avoid the situation. The same applies with seeing a naked man or woman.</p>\n<p>Adam and Eve saw each other naked in the beginning, and there was no sin mentioned. In fact God seems more concerned about Adam and Eve being concerned than about them being naked. But once sin and potentially lust entered the narrative, things changed. Adam and Eve were embarassed from their nakedness, and this embarassment is inherently linked to nudity and sin later. There's also the concept of desire which is separate from nudity. Consider that some people can lust after a woman who has nearly her entire body covered.</p>\n<p>\" If one gazes even at the little finger of a woman with the intent to have pleasure from it, it is as though he gazed at her shameful place.\"\nSource: <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Shulchan_Aruch/Even_ha-Ezer/21#cite_note-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch/Even ha-Ezer/21</a></p>\n<p>Most of us can look at a woman's pinky without lusting after her, so most of us don't sin by looking at a woman's hand to look at her ring for example. But when it comes to naked bodies most of us are only capable at looking at our direct family members or children without lust and even then some people struggle. And then there's the concept of embarassment, once someone becomes aware of their nakedness it can become improper to see them naked afterward. What was once not a sin becomes so close to sin that we need to separate from it.</p>\n<p>\"A father is permitted to hug his daughter, kiss her, and sleep next to her [naked] with flesh touching, and so too a mother with her son, as long as they are minors....If the daughter is embarrassed to stand before her father naked, or she is betrothed, and likewise if the mother is embarrassed to stand before her son naked – even if they are minors, when they reach the point of being embarrassed, they may not sleep together except clothed.\"\nSource: <a href=\"https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Translation:Shulchan_Aruch/Even_ha-Ezer/21#cite_note-3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">ibid</a></p>\n<p>But even if it may not be inherently sinful to look at someone who is naked, one must realize that almost all of us will sin when seeing someone naked. Recall that our king Dawid was far from sin most of his life, but one day he saw a naked woman and he could/would not stop himself from doing many sins. First he saw her, then he inquired of her, then he ignored the fact that she was married, then he had her brought to him by royal guards, then he impregnated her, then he killed her husband to hide the fact that he impregnated her. If he wouldn't have seen her naked, I doubt that the sins that followed would have happened.</p>\n<p>Conclusion: Just like looking at a pinky finger may not inherently be sinful, looking at a naked women may not be inherently sinful. But don't let that distract you from the reality that even the greatest of us when seeing a naked women or a naked person of the opposite gender will immediately have sinful thoughts or be emboldened to do even worse sins such as the case with Dawid after seeing Bathsheba naked. Therefore it is halakhically forbidden to look at a naked woman and one should refrain from doing so.</p>\n\n\n",

When the Torah speaks of ורוח אלוקים, we would actually have expected ורוח האלוקים, i.e. “the wind (spirit) of G'd;\" the reason the Torah chose to omit the letter ה , thereby apparently identifying wind as something divine, this is because of all matters in the physical universe wind is the closest to the invisible abstract force called G'd.

In fact, the Torah prescribes the punishment but never details how the Sanhedrin should be elected, beyond Moses' elders, that were chosen by his Holy Spirit. The Mishnaic proposition (Sanhedrin 4,4) of \"<em>everyone (simply) knows his relative position</em>\" without the need for elections seems somewhat problematic.</p>\n<p>In my understanding, (without actually explaining how it worked in fact) there's no way to obtain judicial authority in the eyes of the people, but by adjoining the Sanhedrin to the Temple, and claiming [some] Holy spirit \"intervention\" with the judges, as the verse says \"כִּי מִצִּיּוֹן תֵּצֵא תוֹרָה וּדְבַר־ה' מִירוּשָׁלִָם\" - <strong>the closeness to the Temple gives Sanhedrin's decrees and sanctions the necessitated divinity</strong>. (See also Rashi on \"אלה המשפטים\" - \"ולמה נסמכה פרשת דינין לפרשת מזבח, לומר לך שתשים סנהדרין אצל המזבח\".)</p>\n<p>Naturally, when the Temple was destroyed and the Sanhedrin lost its associated divinity, it also completely lost its authority in the eyes of the people. This can clearly be seen throughout the Talmud - rabbis themselves never appeal to the Sanhedrin, never even mention a functioning one.</p>\n<p>Indeed, without the authority of the Roman government, without national elections, or a prophet, or a divine revelation, why would people trust a bunch of rabbis who can't agree between themselves even on how the Sanhedrin should operate? (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/94384/how-sanhedrin-was-possible-if-there-was-no-agreement-about-the-juridical-procedu?r=SearchResults&s=14%7C25.9795\">how-sanhedrin-was-possible-without-agreement-on-procedures\"</a>.)</p>\n<p>This seems to be the real (down-to-earth) explanation, why capital and corporal punishment at large was abandoned right after the destruction of the Temple.</p>\n\n\n",

R' Ziv also added some extra time for mussar to counteract the bad influence from those studies.\nAnd it's interesting to note that רי\"ס did not let the ישיבה be called under his name (like all other schools that followed רי\"ס mussar movement), nor did he ever visit the ישיבה, lest others think he allows secular studies.</p>\n<p>I have also seen that there was a lot of backlash towards the yeshiva (ha'mayon issue 50 pg 104), but no details were given.</p>\n<p>In לקט רשומות (from ר' נתן וואכטפויגל) it says that when he was a young teenager and learning in Kelm (under R' Elya Lopian), they one day started learning secular studies, so he got up and left the yeshiva and went to Mir, saying that an institution that learns secular studies is not a ישיבה!</p>\n\n\n",

Nevertheless, the language used by various authorities, including the Shulchan Aruch  and Rema (Orach Chaim 581:1) is language of \"minhag\". This status of minhag is why there are so many conflicting customs about selichot, including which selichot are said and when selichot are said (see Rema there, among others).</p>\n<p>The various selichot used by different communities were composed at different times. As per the OP's comment specifically asking about the Pizmon \"Malachei Rachamim\", that selichah was composed by Rabbi Shmuel ben Rabbi Yehudah of Mainz (<a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90%D7%9B%D7%99_%D7%A8%D7%97%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D#%D7%A2%D7%9C_%D7%94%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%91%D7%A8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>), who lived just under 1000 years ago.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>You can usually distinguish a minhag from halakha when the minhag varies drastically from community to community. Selichot definitely fall under the category of minhag, and there are very different minhagim between the different communities.</p>\n<p>In general the texts of the selichot are different between communities. Sephardic selichot are different than Ashkenazi selichot which are different from Yemenite selichot. So asking who wrote \"the selichot\" is really too broad of a question, maybe you could ask who wrote the Iraqi selichot, or who wrote the German Ashkenazi Selichot.</p>\n<p>Even when to say selichot differents wildly between communities. Sepharadim who generally fall under the umbrella of Edot HaMizrah typically recite Selichot for the entire month of elul either after midnight or early in the morning and carry through until the end of Yom Kippur. They do this for Kabbalistic reasons.</p>\n<p>Sepharadim from the West typically recite selichot right after 'arbit (ma'ariv), some do it for elul, some do it only between rosh hashannah and yom kippur. Their selichot are also shorter than other Sepharadim.</p>\n<p>I believe Ashkenazim only start reciting selichot the Sabbath before Rosh HaShannah (Festival of Trumpets/Shofarot) and according to Wikipedia there are 13 variants of the texts of selichot.</p>\n<p>As far as I'm aware, the Rambam didn't codify saying of selichot as halakha, but mentioned the custom of selichot as being only during the 10 days of repentance between Rosh HaShannah and Yom Kippur. His words can be found in Mishneh Torah, Sefer Madda, Teshuvah 3:4</p>\n<p>\"וְנָהֲגוּ כֻּלָּם לָקוּם בַּלַּיְלָה בַּעֲשָׂרָה יָמִים אֵלּוּ וּלְהִתְפַּלֵּל בְּבָתֵּי כְּנֵסִיּוֹת בְּדִבְרֵי תַּחֲנוּנִים וּבְכִבּוּשִׁין עַד שֶׁיֵּאוֹר הַיּוֹם:</p>\n<p>During these ten days, the custom is for everyone to rise [while it is still] night and pray in the synagogues with heart-rending words of supplication until daybreak.\"</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911896/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-Three.htm</a></p>\n\n\n",

There is a verse which states that we need to \"pass a shofar, truah\" (ותעביר שופר תרועה).  The Malbim understands this verse to mean that we need to pass our air or breath through the shofar uninterrupted.</p>\n<p>According to the Malbim, this is the source for the uninterrupted sound of a Tikiah that we sound on Rosh HaShana. This contrasts with a truah which is an sound formed by interrupting the air flow through the shofar.</p>\n<p>Now, if we can assume that the above understanding of the verse has halachic validity, then we see that the Torah instructs us to pass air through the Shofar, not to draw air out of the shofar.</p>\n<p>As such, we could reasonably conclude that a sound formed by drawing air out of the shofar is not a valid means of producing a shofar sound and therefore one cannot fulfill their halachic obligation this way.</p>\n<p>This would be so even though we also paskin that \"all sounds are kosher in a Shofar\".  We would have to reinterpret that halacha to mean that all sounds legitimately made in the shofar are kosher.</p>\n<p>A sound made by passing air is legitimate -- and therefore it is kosher whether it is loud or soft, high pitched or low, etc.  On the other hand, a sound made by drawing air would be illegitimate and would be pasul (nullified) regardless of how it sounds.</p>\n<p>Of course, this assumes that we actually paskin according to the Malbim's understanding of the verse.  And that assumption may be false. I don't know, which is why I am offering it merely as a suggestion.</p>\n\n\n",

We see that Hashem did not bring them in front of the bais din as the entire congregation of Israel were not in a position to actually serve as a court. Instead He brought them in front of the <em>bais din shel shamaim</em> and decreed the punishment upon them as the Creator and Master of the Universe. An example could be like the punishment decreed upon the people of S'dom. That is Hashem decrees the punishment that is worthy of being done. In this case, those who would follow Hashem were being tested to determine if they were able to carry out the decree of Hashem. Verse 25 shows that the people could not bring themselves to act even if they had not succumbed to the sin. That is why Moshe had to call upon them to take their swords and rally to the service of Hashem in verse 26.</p>\n<p>See Rav Hirsch in his commentary on verse 25 and 26.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/9893/showrashi/true#v20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ki Sisa 32:20</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then he took the calf they had made, burned it in fire, ground it to\nfine powder, scattered [it] upon the surface of the water, and gave\n[it to] the children of Israel to drink.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>RASHI</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>and gave [it to] the children of Israel to drink:</strong> He intended to test them like women suspected of adultery [are tested, as prescribed\nin Num. 5:11-31] (A.Z. 44a).

This is why they had to be executed, just as the inhabitants of the idolatrous town in Deuteronomy chapter 14 have to be executed and their belongings have to be burned. (Based on Daat Baaley Tossaphot)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_DeRabbi_Eliezer.45.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">The Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer (chapter 45:11)</a> explains something similair to what the Chizkuni writes, e.g. that these people intended that their conduct should be viewed as idolatrous. The Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer explains that all the people who kissed the golden calf with all his heart, his upper lip and his bones became golden:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He made Israel drink the water (with the dust of the calf). Everyone who had kissed the calf with all his heart, his upper lip and his bones became golden, and the tribe of Levi slew him, until there fell of Israel about three thousand men, as it is said, \"And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses\" (Ex. 32:28).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Note that the Pirkei DeRabbi Eliezer mentions the words \"with all his heart\", it seems to me that this supports the view of the Chizkuni, that their hearts were filled with the intention of worshipping the golden calf.</p>\n<p>A really interesting approach to this is given by the Shelah in his commentary on this pasuk. He mentions that they (the 3.000 men) were already sentenced to death when they leaved Mitzrayim, however, their sentence was suspended temporarily. The episode of the sin with the golden calf was however when the sentence was fulfilled (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Ki_Tisa%2C_Torah_Ohr.26?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Ki Tisa, Torah Ohr</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Presumably, their guilt had been that they had already then harboured thoughts of an idolatrous nature, but had only found an outlet for these thoughts during the episode of the golden calf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shelah here mentions the\n\"thoughts of an idolatrous nature\", as does the Chizkuni.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.20?lang=he&with=Rashi&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to 32:20</a>, from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.66b.14?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 66b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אִם יֵשׁ עֵדִים וְהַתְרָאָה בְּסַיִף – כְּמִשְׁפַּט אַנְשֵׁי עִיר הַנִּדַּחַת שֶׁהֵן מְרֻבִּין – עֵדִים בְּלֹא הַתְרָאָה בְּמַגֵּפָה, שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר וַיִּגֹּף ה' אֶת הָעָם, לֹא עֵדִים וְלֹא הַתְרָאָה בְּהִדְרוֹקָן</p>\n<p>If there were witnesses and a warning [that they worshipped the Calf], they were executed by the sword, like the citizens of an Ir Hanidachas when they're the majority.

The Gemara provides an alternative explanation: And if you wish, say instead: She came and began the act, and Moses came and completed the circumcision</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Indeed it's possible that Tzipporah did only the first step of the <em>milah</em>, the cutting of the foreskin, and not the second, peeling back the membrane <em>(periah)</em>. The Talmud (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yevamot.71b.14?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot 71b</a>) states that the latter step was not part of the original commandment given to Abraham. The first record we have of it being obligatory, according to that opinion, is when Joshua performed a mass circumcision of the Jewish males upon their entry into the Land of Israel (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Joshua.5.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joshua 5:2</a>; the Talmud understands the word שנית (\"a second time\") in that verse to mean a second step of the circumcision).</p>\n<p>Now, some of the commentaries there (Tosafot, Ramban, et al) argue that <em>periah</em> might have been performed earlier too, just that it wasn't required. But not necessarily does that mean that Tzipporah would have done so.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'm not sure if non-Jewish sources would be allowed but it was quite a common practice in ancient Egypt [500 years before Abraham] so it would not be impossible for her to know based on general knowledge.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FVsJk.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FVsJk.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_circumcision#Ancient_world\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">History_of_circumcision</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sixth Dynasty (2345–2181 BCE) tomb artwork in Egypt has been thought to be the oldest documentary evidence of circumcision, the most ancient depiction being a bas-relief from the necropolis at Saqqara (c. 2400 BCE) with the inscriptions reading: \"The ointment is to make it acceptable.\" and \"Hold him so that he does not fall\".[citation needed] In the oldest written account, by an Egyptian named Uha, in the 23rd century BCE, he describes a mass circumcision and boasts of his ability to stoically endure the pain: \"When I was circumcised, together with one hundred and twenty men ... there was none thereof who hit out, there was none thereof who was hit, and there was none thereof who scratched and there was none thereof who was scratched.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

(I understand that honey is a distinctly Ashkenazi minhag. I am asking from an Ashkenazi perspective.)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>So your question is addressed by Rav Yosef Chaim Sonnenfeld zt\"l in his <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=46247&st=&pgnum=117&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shu\"t Shalmas Chaim 326</a>.</p>\n<p>He begins by asking why one would not dip the challah in salt on Rosh Hashanah and he answers initially:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לכאורה יש לומר, אחרי דנוהגין לטבול פרוסת המוציא בדבש, ואם יתן עליה גם מלח יהיה נותן טעם לפגם, ואין ראוי לעשות זה בליל ראש השנה, והרי העיקר שהוא טובל בדבש הוא לסימן טוב על שהוא מתוק</p>\n<p>At first glance there is to say, that there are those who are accustomed to dip the slice of hamotzi in honey, and if you also place it in salt it will impart a flavour that ruins it, and this is not fitting to be done on the night of Rosh Hashanah when the main thing is to dip it in honey as a siman - a good sign that it (i.e. the forthcoming year) should be sweet.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He reasons therefore that we should avoid using the salt when we have the honey. He brings the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ba%27er_Hetev_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.167.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Be'er Heitev 167</a> who expands on the Rema's words and gives more Kabbalistic reasoning for the salt, however...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מכל מקום כאן אי אפשר</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, here it is impossible</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as far as the Rema's point about the table being compared to a mizbeach (altar) and therefore requires salt, he writes that the implication is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דהבאת מלח על השלחן אפילו אם לא יטבול הוא בעצמו מצוה</p>\n<p>Bringing salt on the table even if he does not dip is itself a mitzvah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Accordingly, even if we don't dip our challah in salt, we still make a point of bringing it to the table.</p>\n<p>However, he counters as per the fourth perek of Tamid there was salt required afterwards on the meat of the Korban, and if so, the salt would need to be on the food (which is compared to the Korban) and it is not enough for it to be just on the table.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, he therefore takes the middle ground and concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>תשובה: בפשיטות שוודאי נכון להביא מלח ולטבול בדבש ולטעום, ושוב אני טובל במלח, אבל לא בפעם אחת כי אם משני צדדים, ואני טועם מקודם הדבש עם הלחם לסימנא טבא, ושוב אני טובל במלח ג\"כ ולהזכיר ברית מלח עולם</p>\n<p>Answer: It is definitely correct to bring salt, and dip in honey and taste, and I (make a point of) dipping again in salt - but not once because of the two sides. I dip first in honey with the challah as that is as good sign (for the forthcoming year) and then I dip again in salt also to remember the everlasting covenant of salt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Mishnah Berura in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.167.33?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">167:33</a> seems to indicate that since our bread already has salt in it, we only need to have it on the table to be yotzei the Rema;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לג) וע\"ל סוף סי' ק\"ע - פי' אע\"ג דמבואר שם דלדידן דפת שלנו הוא במלח אין אנו נוהגין באכילת מלח אחר הסעודה מ\"מ מצוה להניחו על השלחן וכתבו המקובלים לטבול פרוסת המוציא במלח ג\"פ</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Reb Shlomo Zalman (<a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=147026&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=16091555989699682&pagenum=29\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Halichos Shlomo Rosh Hashana Perek 1 note 77</a>) understood this to be the case, and just dipped in honey but had salt on the table.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What advice do you have for learning rishonim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In my yeshiva, I've joined a b'iyun shiur that makes extensive use of a variety of rishonim. I find its hard to keep track of differences in the language of each specific rishon. What advice do you have for clarifying each rishon's approach, especially the Ramban?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>In my personal experience, I find that the better I prepare the Gemara with Rashi, the easier it is to understand the Rishonim. If you know all the steps clearly and how they link together, it becomes much easier to follow the reasoning of the Rishonim. So often I would review a Gemara and Rashi four times or so until I felt I knew how all the steps connected according to Rashi. This also helps to separate where the links are obvious, and where there is room for interpretation. (An example of what this should look like when you are done is Rashbam on Bava Basra.)</p>\n<p>Once you review the Rishonim, go back to the Gemara to make sure you know how they read it. I like to do the Rishonim in roughly chronological order (after Rashi, Tosafos, Maharsha), to keep track of who is responding to whom. This won't help for Ramban, who is famously harder to understand than other Rishonim, because of his terseness. For Ramban, it can be easier to skim it quickly to see what he addresses, then compare it to later, lengthier Rishonim that were heavily influenced by him: Rashba, Ritva and Ran. On many masechtos, the Chiddushei HaRan is almost like a lengthier version of Ramban, and can be very useful to understand what the Ramban means. But again, the most important thing is to make sure you know the gemara very well.</p>\n<p>But finally, ultimately it just takes putting in the effort. Over time you'll find a method/system that works for you. Whatever method you take, there won't be a shortcut; just a system that you find reliable and self-correcting so you end up understanding the gemara correctly. To quote the famous <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Megillah.6b.3?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאָמַר רַבִּי יִצְחָק אִם יֹאמַר לְךָ אָדָם יָגַעְתִּי וְלֹא מָצָאתִי אַל תַּאֲמֵן לֹא יָגַעְתִּי וּמָצָאתִי אַל תַּאֲמֵן יָגַעְתִּי וּמָצָאתִי תַּאֲמֵן      Rabbi Yitzḥak said in the style of a previous passage: If a person says to you: I have labored and not found success, do not believe him. Similarly, if he says to you: I have not labored but nevertheless I have found success, do not believe him. If, however, he says to you: I have labored and I have found success, believe him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'll close with an actual description of learning gemara from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.29b.10?lang=he&with=Ramban&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל עכשיו שנהגו לכתוב התלמוד אם השאילו מסכתא אינו [כן] שכל אדם שוין בו, והשונה פרקו מאה פעמים ומי שלא שנה אותו מעולם כלם נוגעין בהם ומשמשין בהם שאין לך אדם רגיל שלא יהא צריך עיון ומחשבה יתירא ולמשוך אילך ואילך ולגלול אותו מתחלתו לסופו ומסופו לתחלתו כדי לעין בהלכות הצריכות לו לאותה הלכה שהוא שונה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# What role did the Jews play in the Medieval money system (pre-banking, merchants, etc.)?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I just read <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_banking#Emergence_of_merchant_banks\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In the middle of the 13th century, groups of Italian Christians, particularly the Cahorsins and Lombards, invented legal fictions to get around the ban on Christian usury;[147] for example, one method of effecting a loan with interest was to offer money without interest, but also require that the loan be insured against possible loss or injury, and/or delays in repayment (see contractum trinius).[147] The Christians affecting these legal fictions became known as the pope's usurers, and <strong>reduced the importance of the Jews to European monarchs.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why were the Jews important to European monarchs?</p>\n<p>Searching \"medieval jewish merchants\" leads to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radhanite\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radhanite</a>, which was from 500-1000, just before the 1100-1200 Venetian bank. What role did the Jews play in the medieval or even ancient pre-banking days, and why did they fill that role? I feel like I remember reading something (related to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usury\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">usury</a>) but I am at a loss in searching for the <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/moneylending\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">religious significance</a>. What did they do with their money, how did they hold onto it, how did they manage it? Some more related to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_Jew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Court Jews</a>, but that's a little later in history after banking.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Jews prospered in the Middle Ages largely due to their acumen in banking and trade which is why they were valued amongst European Monarchs as they represented a major player in the economic stability of their host country.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/anti-Semitism/Anti-Semitism-in-medieval-Europe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Encyclopaedia Britannica</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>As European commerce grew in the late Middle Ages, some Jews became prominent in trade, banking, and moneylending, and Jews’ economic and cultural successes tended to arouse the envy of the populace.</strong> This economic resentment, allied with traditional religious prejudice, prompted the forced expulsion of Jews from several countries and regions, including England (1290), France (14th century), Germany (1350s), Portugal (1496), Provence (1512), and the Papal States (1569). Intensifying persecution in Spain culminated in 1492 in the forced expulsion of that country’s large and long-established Jewish population. Only Jews who had converted to Christianity were allowed to remain, and those suspected of continuing to practice Judaism faced persecution in the Spanish Inquisition. As a result of these mass expulsions, the centres of Jewish life shifted from western Europe and Germany to Turkey and then to Poland and Russia.</p>\n<p>But where they were needed, Jews were tolerated. <strong>Living as they did at the margins of society, Jews performed economic functions that were vital to trade and commerce. Because premodern Christianity did not permit moneylending for interest and because Jews generally could not own land, Jews played a vital role as moneylenders and traders.</strong> Where they were permitted to participate in the larger society, Jews thrived. During the Middle Ages in Spain, before their expulsion in 1492, Jewish philosophers, physicians, poets, and writers were among the leaders of a rich cultural and intellectual life shared with Muslims and Christians. In collaboration with Arab scholars and thinkers in the tolerant society of Muslim Spain, they were instrumental in transmitting the intellectual heritage of the Classical world to medieval Christendom.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as \" the Jews being the only ones worthy of dealing with money in these complex ways (related to usury)\" - it is largely due to the fact that Usury is something forbidden in the Torah between Jews but not between Jews and non-Jews.</p>\n<p>It writes in Vayikra <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Leviticus.25.35-37?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">25:35-37</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If your kinsman, being in straits, comes under your authority, and you hold him as though a resident alien, let him live by your side: do not exact from him advance or accrued interest (I.e., interest deducted in advance, or interest added at the time of repayment.), but fear your God. Let him live by your side as your kinsman. Do not lend him your money at advance interest, or give him your food at accrued interest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is codified in Halacha. Rambam in his Mishneh Torah, in <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1159441/jewish/Malveh-veLoveh-Chapter-4.htm#v2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malveh VeLoveh (Lenders and Borrowers) 4:2</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Just as it is forbidden to give a loan at interest; so, too, it is forbidden to borrow at interest, as Deuteronomy, ibid., states: \"Do not offer interest to your brother.\" According to the Oral Tradition, we learned that this is a warning to the borrower.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it is forbidden to act as a broker between the borrower and the lender when interest is involved. Anyone involved, a guarantor, a scribe or a witness transgresses a negative commandment, as Exodus 22:24 states: \"Do not lay interest upon him.\" This is a warning against the witnesses, the guarantor and the scribe.</p>\n<p>Thus, we see that a person who offers a loan at interest violates six prohibitions:</p>\n<p>\"Do not act like a creditor toward him,\" \"Do not give him your money with neshech\" \"Do not put forth your food at marbit\" \"Do not take neshech and tarbit from him\" (Leviticus 25:36), \"Do not lay interest upon him,\" and \"Do not place a stumbling block in front of the blind\" (Leviticus 19:14).</p>\n<p>A person who borrows at interest violates two prohibitions: \"Do not offer interest to your brother.\" \"Do not place a stumbling block in front of the blind\"</p>\n<p>The guarantor, the witnesses and the like violate only the prohibition: \"Do not lay interest upon him.\" Any broker who connects between the lender and the borrower or assists or instructs one of them with regard to making the loan transgresses the commandment: \"Do not place a stumbling block in front of the blind\" (Touger translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now although the issur of ribbis (usury) exists only between Jews it is worth noting the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.70b.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 70b</a> which notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rav Naḥman said: Rav Huna said to me that this verse is necessary only to state that even interest that a Jew took from a gentile will ultimately reach the government treasury, and the one who took it will not be successful. Rava raised an objection to the statement of Rav Naḥman: The verse states: “Unto a gentile tashikh” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.23.21?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>), which indicates that it is permitted for a Jew to take interest from a gentile, as what is the meaning of “tashikh”? Doesn’t it mean the same as tishokh, take interest, thereby teaching that one may take interest from a gentile? The Gemara refutes this claim: No, it means to pay interest, meaning that you must pay him interest. (Sefaria translation and notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.70b.10?lang=bi&p2=Tosafot_on_Bava_Metzia.70b.10.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosafos</a> on this piece develops this idea of \"tashikh\" and mentions a point that it is pertinent to your question. The noteworthy excerpt reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא אסרו מעולם רב נחמן ורב הונא רבית דנכרי ואפי' ללישנא קמא יש להתיר לפי שיש עלינו מס מלך ושרים והכל הוי כדי חיינו ועוד שאנו שרויין בין האומות ואי אפשר לנו להשתכר בשום דבר אם לא נישא וניתן עמהם הלכך אין לאסור רבית שמא ילמוד ממעשיו יותר משאר משא ומתן</p>\n<p>And Rav Nachman and Rav Hunah don't ever forbid usury with a gentile, and even according to the first teaching one can permit it since there is on us (Jews) tax from the king and officers and all of it is part of our lives. Furthermore, we are permitted to charge interest amongst the nations (i.e. non-Jews) and it is impossible for us to earn wages (i.e. subsist) unless we  maintain business with them. Therefore we don't need to forbid usury since perhaps he will learn from his actions more than any other business.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So with this Tosafos in mind, we see that Jews are allowed to deal in moneylending etc. especially when it is their main means of subsistence. The fact that they were proficient in trade and banking etc coupled with the point already mentioned that Christianity did not allow moneylending for interest meant that they were well placed to take the lead on the European stage, thereby making them a powerful player on the economic grand scale which allowed them to forge important connections with monarchs and other European leaders.</p>\n<p>As far as the Radhanites that you mention, they dominated the trade routes throughout the medieval period which is why they enjoyed the good relationship with European monarchs as they controlled much of the economic development of the period.</p>\n<p>There is a fascinating website <a href=\"https://www.ancient-origins.net/history-ancient-traditions/radhanites-0013876\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Radhanite Jewish trade routes prospered from roughly 750 to the late 800’s. Almost all key scholars agree that for more than a century, “virtually every drop of spice that entered Europe did so through the hands of the Radhanite Jews”, as they held the monopoly on spices, slaves, and luxury goods. <strong>One of the biggest sources of income for the Radhanites was mediating between East and West, between Christendom and Islam, and between the Kings, Caliphs, and Khagans, who all engaged in enslavement of tribes and peoples</strong>. Radhanite Jews came to dominate all early medieval trade routes and river systems, and gained a virtual monopoly on the transit of slaves , which they took with them throughout the world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

As far as I remember, there are 2 opinions: one to bless before the blessing on the fruit itself, while the other opinion claims that you bless Shehechyanu after the blessing of the fruit, right before eating. In the second evening of Rosh Hashana, we bless Shehechyanu in the Kiddush, long before eating the new fruit. Moreover, there are many blessings and distractions between them such as Birkat Hamotizi, Netilat Yadaim etc. Why shouldn't we repeat the Shehechyanu right before eating the fruit? How is the Kiddush Shehechyanu blessing is applicable in advance?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>See Shulchan Aruch Orach Chaim 225:3.

Thus, as far as I understand, the <em>shehecheyanu</em> of <em>kiddush</em> also applies to seeing the new fruit on the table.</p>\n<p>(Similarly, Mishnah Berurah 600:4 recommends that a woman who has the custom to recite <em>shehecheyanu</em> at candle lighting should have a new fruit in front of her while lighting on the second night of Rosh HaShanah. Again, the <em>shehecheyanu</em> will apply to seeing the new fruit in front of her, although she won’t eat it until later.)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Isaiah 58 and the way we fast\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I certainly don't want to offend anyone, but if it is asked in Isaiah 58 whether it is this manner of fasting that G-d has chose; when one starves oneself, practices self-denial, afflicting one's soul or answers for one's soul, and bows the head, spreading sackcloth and ashes, and so on.. what's the answer? Are such habits acceptable to G-d? Because it seems we have similar habits on Yom Kippur, while from from Isaiah 58:6 on [isn't this the fast that I've chosen?] it becomes clear that G-d might hold a different point of view when He talks about fasting, i.e. that it should be about breaking/loosing the chains of wickedness etc..</p>\n<p>(Or should I translate the words in Isaiah 58:5 הכזה יהיה צום אבחרהו יום as \"Such will be the fast I will choose, a day upon\", and the words הלזה תקרא צום, ויום רצון ליהוה as \"This will be called a fasting, a day acceptable to the Lord\", in such a case the beginning of Isaiah 58:6  הלוא זה צום אבחרהו could be confirmatory \"After all, this is the fast I will choose\")</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It's not an either/or.

Yes, if you're not attuned to the nuances of Biblical Hebrew, you can wind up reading those backwards:</p>\n<p>ה הֲכָזֶה, יִהְיֶה צוֹם אֶבְחָרֵהוּ--יוֹם עַנּוֹת אָדָם, נַפְשׁוֹ; הֲלָכֹף כְּאַגְמֹן רֹאשׁוֹ, וְשַׂק וָאֵפֶר יַצִּיעַ--הֲלָזֶה תִּקְרָא-צוֹם, וְיוֹם רָצוֹן לַיהוָה.  ו הֲלוֹא זֶה, צוֹם אֶבְחָרֵהוּ--פַּתֵּחַ חַרְצֻבּוֹת רֶשַׁע, הַתֵּר אֲגֻדּוֹת מוֹטָה; וְשַׁלַּח רְצוּצִים חָפְשִׁים, וְכָל-מוֹטָה תְּנַתֵּקוּ.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>Do you think that behavior like this would make a fast that I'd choose?!

Yehuda, son of converts, went and related their statements to his household, and those statements continued to spread until they were heard by the monarchy. They ruled and said: Yehuda, who elevated the Roman regime, shall be elevated and appointed as head of the Sages, the head of the speakers in every place. Yosei, who remained silent, shall be exiled from his home in Judea as punishment, and sent to the city of Tzippori in the Galilee. And Shimon, who denounced the government, shall be killed.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In both stories, there's a discussion between three wise men: One suggests a bad thing, one says nothing and one suggests a good thing. Each receives a punishment or a reward according to what he said/did. In Sotah, the matter at hand is what should be done to Bnei Yisrael. The person who pushed for negative action against them is punished while the person who rejected this is rewarded. The silent one receives a middle-of-the-road punishment. In Shabbat, the story is reversed: The matter at hand is what do the sages think about the Romans. The person who praised them is rewarded while the person who rejected them and attacked them is punished. But here as well, the silent one receives a middle-of-the-road punishment.</p>\n<p>Has the connection been made by anyone? Any sources discussing this?</p>\n\n\n",

Deliver me from evildoers and save me from bloodthirsty men.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is simply to establish if headings actually appear in the Hebrew manuscripts, or if this is a tradition common to the Hebrew Scriptures.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 9)\n\n<p>Yes, these headings appear in Hebrew manuscripts. Here are two of the most famous manuscripts with the heading for your psalm: למנצח אל־תשחת לדוד מכתם בשלח שאול וישמרו את־הבית להמיתו.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://manuscripts.sefaria.org/leningrad-color/BIB_LENCDX_F377A.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Leningrad Codex</a> — dated to 1008/9 CE — right column, bottom paragraph is the beginning of the psalm.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://barhama.com/ajaxzoom/pic/AleppoWM/28-250-v_photo_by_Ardon_Bar-Hama.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Aleppo Codex</a> — dated to ca. 920 CE — right column, bottom paragraph (it's faded, but you can still see enough to find the words)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Among the manuscripts examined by C. D. Ginsburg for his 4-volume edition of Tanakh, none omit the heading for Psalm 59. (I haven't checked every psalm, but there's no reason to expect large-scale omission of Psalm headings.) The headings also appear in our printed (and online) texts, eg. in <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c2659.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Mechon Mamre</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.59?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Sefaria</a>. Note that in Jewish texts, the heading is included in the verses, unlike what is often the case in Christian versions. This is why many psalms are off by one verse when comparing Jewish and Christian versifications.</p>\n<p>There are a few headings that appear in old translations (eg. Syriac, Septuagint) that don't appear in the Hebrew editions, but these are isolated examples of disagreements, and not a wholesale rejection of headings as a phenomenon. For example, <a href=\"http://ericlevy.com/lxx/?Book=Ps&Chapter=92\" rel=\"noreferrer\">some Septuagint editions</a> have \"for the day before Shabbat, when the earth had been settled\" as a heading for Psalm 92 (= 93 in Hebrew editions), which is the daily psalm we generally read on Friday in current Jewish practice; our <a href=\"https://mechon-mamre.org/c/ct/c2693.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Hebrew</a> <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.93?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">texts</a> do not contain such a heading.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How does one do Teshuva?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Apologies for the seemingly simple question, but I feel it is appropriate for this time of year.</p>\n<p>How do we actually do it? I know the Rambam says Regret, Confess, and Resolve, but I also know that Shaarei Teshuva has a much lengthier process. I am sure there are other sources too. So. my question is, if someone asked you how to do teshuva, what would you tell them, and what would you source?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>There really is no conflict between the Rambam and Sha'arei Teshuva. People tend to overlook a key paragraph in the beginning of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shaarei_Teshuvah.1.9?lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'arei Teshuva</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And behold that there are many levels of repentance. <strong>It is true that you will find forgiveness for any repentance</strong>. However the soul will only find complete purification - to be as if the iniquities never had been - when a person purifies his heart and prepares his spirit, as will be explained. And so is it written (Psalms 32:2), \"Happy is the man whom the Lord does not hold guilty, and in whose spirit there is no deceit.\" <strong>And it is like the matter of a garment that needs washing: For a little washing will be effective to remove its soiling.</strong> However, it will [only] whiten according to the amount of washing. And so is it written there (Psalms 51:4), \"Wash me thoroughly of my iniquity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the immediate and basic act of repentance does remove the sin, however, more repentance is needed to completely remove all its effects. This is the  regret, confession, and resolve. (As an aside, it is not clear that the Sha'arei Teshuva requires verbal confession.)</p>\n<p>I saw in a sefer about the Chofetz Chaim a rabbi who was going to South Africa asked him what he could tell the people in the name of the Chofetz Chaim. He replied: \"Tell them teshuva is a simple matter, regret over the past and resolve for the future, but the yetzer hara makes it look difficult.\"</p>\n<p>And finally, there is a much shorter essay by Rabbeinu Yonah called Yesod Hateshuva that is printed in many Rosh Hashana Machzorim that gives a more basic guide for the person on the day he chooses to do teshuva. [In that essay he says not to think about the past. This would seem to contradict much of Sha'arei Teshuva, but I think the difference is that to immediately break one's habit, it is better to ignore the past. Later, one can do a more thorough teshuva when the actual habit is broken.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I guess I'll mention something that I have found to be controversial. People seem to think that teshuvah is synonymous with \"working on yourself\". You know, It's almost Yom Kippur, I should try to improve my davening, and maybe try a mussar seder, and think about feeling closer to Hashem. Beautiful things, but it isn't surprising that people are disappointed when Yom Kippur passed and they find it hard to hang on to whatever they decided to do.<br />\nIt's no accident that the Rambam <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">begins Hilchos Teshuvah</a> with \"All <em>mitzvos of the Torah</em>, positive or negative, if a man violated any one of them, on purpose or by mistake\"<br />\nIn the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.7.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">7th chapter</a>, he gets up to discussing doing teshuvah on one's <em>character traits</em>. But that takes a long time, as he detailed in his Hilchos Deios. You surely aren't going to finish before Yom Kippur, and he said it was a positive obligation to do teshuvah before Yom Kippur (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Repentance.2.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">2(7)</a>).<br />\nRather, the \"usual\" obligation of teshuvah is to seek out the <em>short list of things</em> where a person really messed up. Where he let himself down, where he can have real regret because these are things he would never normally do. Find those and fix them, make sure that they won't happen again. And apologize.<br />\n[Because people think of teshuvah in the first way I described, that's why I frequently hear drashos even by very big talmidei chachamim, telling people not to worry if they know perfectly well that they can't live up to their inspiration at Ne'ilah. That the Rambam says that the Master of Secrets knows that the person will never slip back, but that means that the person sincerely wants that, not that he will make it truly happen. And that in our generation, we just aren't so good at feeling regret...<br />\nBut of course you can't really feel regret on something that is going to take you years to fix. And you can't honestly resolve to fix it in one minute at Neilah.]</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>Maimonides put it this way: true teshuva is when a person abandons the wrong, resolves not to do it again, comes up with ways to correct the wrong, and makes new habits that assure that the wrong is not repeated. This, Rambam says, is true repentence.</p>\n\n\n",

The final five lines read as follow:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָבִֽינוּ מַלְכֵּֽנוּ כָּתְבֵֽנוּ בְּסֵֽפֶר חַיִּים טוֹבִים - Our Father, Our King! inscribe us in the Book of the Good Life.</p>\n<p>אָבִֽינוּ מַלְכֵּֽנוּ כָּתְבֵֽנוּ בְּסֵֽפֶר גְּאֻלָּה וִישׁוּעָה - Our Father, Our King! inscribe us in the Book of Redemption and Salvation.</p>\n<p>אָבִֽינוּ מַלְכֵּֽנוּ כָּתְבֵֽנוּ בְּסֵֽפֶר פַּרְנָסָה וְכַלְכָּלָה - Our Father, Our King! inscribe us in the Book of Sustenance and Support.</p>\n<p>אָבִֽינוּ מַלְכֵּֽנוּ כָּתְבֵֽנוּ בְּסֵֽפֶר זְכֻיּוֹת - Our Father, Our King! inscribe us in the Book of Merits.</p>\n<p>אָבִֽינוּ מַלְכֵּֽנוּ כָּתְבֵֽנוּ בְּסֵֽפֶר סְלִיחָה וּמְחִילָה - Our Father, Our King! inscribe us in the Book of Forgiveness and Pardon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we ask Hashem that we be written in certain books so that we have a good year ahead. However, I have always been bothered by the fact that we ask for all the things we want, namely, a good life, redemption and salvation, sustenance and support, and for merits. However, we then end by asking that Hashem inscribe us into the book of forgiveness and pardon.</p>\n<p>Would it not make sense to first ask that Hashem forgives our sins and then only ask for all the good things afterwards? Is it not like a child going shopping in a toy shop, returning with a whole bundle of things he wants and then apologising to his parent?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>אדרבא had we first asked כתבינו בספר סליחה ומחילה and only then for everything else, it would have sounded like \"the kid who apologizes to his parents only to ask them for a trip to the toy store\".</p>\n<p>Only by asking for the \"toys\" first are we showing that everything we get is a מתנת חנם that in truth we don't deserve anyway (regardless of apologizing), and only then can we sincerely ask for forgiveness.</p>\n<p>IMHO anyway...</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Can you use jute twine to hold down the schach of a sukka\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In one of the Lakewood weekly (free) papers, I recently came across an ad from Rabbi Yehuda Shain in which he notes that <a href=\"https://www.thepackagingcompany.us/knowledge-sharing/5-remarkable-ways-to-use-jute-twine/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">jute twine</a> is acceptable to tie and hold down schach. Keeping the lecatchila din of only using something you would use for schach in order to fasten the schach in mind, is jute twine not mekabel tum'ah? Would one be allowed to use it as schach? The following is what I found after a google search: in <a href=\"https://oukosher.org/faqs/can-one-tie-schach-mats-sukkah-string/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this responsum</a> the OU discusses hemp and cotton strings. We can probably assume that the same applies for jute. But I am still looking for sources - <strong>mekoros</strong> discussing the acceptance of jute or other \"gidulei karka\" strings for fastening schach.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>From Star K</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In addition, l’chatchila, kosher schach may not be supported by anything which is mekabel tumah (see Rama O.C. 629:7). According to the opinion of Rashi (as brought in Shaar Hatziyun 629:20) spun or woven threads (e.g. string, yarn) are mekabel tumah. Rav Moshe Feinstein states (Igros Moshe, O.C. 1:177) based on a Mishna, if something which is mekabel tumah is used to hold wooden slats together, the slats themselves are also mekabel tumah and are no longer kosher for schach use. Therefore, Rav Moshe Feinstein explains that wooden venetian blinds held together with cloth tape or string are not kosher for schach. It follows that according to Rashi bamboo slats held together by multi-filament cord (i.e. it is braided or twisted) are also not kosher for schach (even if they are not made to sit or walk on).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>However, monofilament (commonly used for fishing line) is not woven or spun material. Therefore, it is not mekabel tumah and may be used to hold bamboo slats together. All Star-K certified bamboo schach is held together with monofilament cord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if the jute twine is spun or woven, it might be problematic. It seems that the Jute fabric is spun and woven, so if the twine came from fabric it would be a problem. If it’s straight jute without any spinning or wearing it should be fine.</p>\n\n\n",

Does that play a role?<br />\nI'm asking for sources for practical rulings, but also advice on the right attitude.</p>\n<p>Update: On re-reading, I don't want the impression that the question is based on my physical situation, as if I'm tired all the time. The real question is more based on a <em>mental</em> weariness, on one's ability to \"hold kop\", the point where one feels prayers turning into mechanical reading without really paying attention.<br />\nUpdate: tesvov has suggested in a number of comments that the principle stated by the Tur <em>only</em> applies to optional additions, like the Tikkun Chatzos that is the topic where he states it. Interesting suggestion - obviously Rav Avigdor Miller quoted below disagrees - and it would be good to have an explicit statement by a posek about it. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.34a.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"> [Berachos 34a</a> might be a good source on this, but of course in those days prayers were more fluid.]<br />\nThird update: My son-in-law suggested what may be a compromise position, though personally I find it rather a depressing one: The requirement for kavannah is indeed absolute, and according to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Prayer_and_the_Priestly_Blessing.4.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> one should perhaps never say any part of the davening, even the Amidah, without proper kavannah. <em>However</em>, since in our times we don't have so much kavannah anyhow, this no longer serves as an excuse to skip anything.</p>\n<p>You really have to see the wording of the Rambam there - not really quoted by later poskim, but super-powerful and perfectly clear [ital. mine].</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any prayer uttered without mental concentration <em>is not prayer</em>. If a service has been recited without such concentration, it must be recited again devoutly. A person finds that his thoughts are confused and his mind is\ndistracted: He is <em>forbidden to pray</em> till he has recovered his mental\ncomposure. Hence, on returning from a journey or if one is weary or\ndistressed, it is forbidden to pray till his mind is composed. The\nsages said that <em>he should wait three days</em> till he is rested and his\nmind is calm, and then he recites the prayers...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I wonder if the much less sharp language of the poskim in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.98.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OH 98</a> is evidence to the contrary: These more recent poskim seem to say instead that <em>you really really need</em> to have kavannah, but... let's talk about whether you have to pray again if you pray without. I'm not seeing a nice clear, Don't pray. Still, might that be the logical conclusion?</p>\n<p>Further update: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DwAVyvl5MIEwj8I6jzKFNsEvOCWom5lX/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Reflections on Yomim Noraim davening</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>A related question was the topic of an episode of \"Dimensions of the Daf.\"  Rambam in one place (which I think is your citation) says about the Amidah that if you did not have kavanah, you must start again. But elsewhere he says that if one had kavanah at the beginning but not in the middle of the Amidah then you don't restart.</p>\n<p>The explanation given (in the episode) is that there are two sorts of kavanah.  The first is that without the kavanah that you are engaging in a conversation before hakadosh baruch hu, you aren't praying at all; so without that appreciation in mind, you haven't started the Amidah and must daven \"in the first place.\"  The second sort is an understanding of the words you are saying and their implications (as opposed to just saying them from habit).  It is this second sort of kavanah that the Rambam says if you had it at the start (of the Amidah) you need not repeat the prayer (which of course would not even have been a prayer in the first place if you didn't have kavanah that you are addressing hashem).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I'd like to add my best impression of the answer to my question, taking into account what I've heard so far. I am still sorely lacking in poskim who deal with this directly.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Rambam quoted is pretty clear. Prayer without kavannah doesn't exist and is actually not allowed. [One might restrict the latter to the Amidah; perhaps its special status means that it's sacrilege to devalue it.]</li>\n<li>The Tur quoted is also pretty clear: It is better to skip prayers rather than say them without kavannah. <em>However</em>, he says what he says in a section on Tikkun Chatzos and it may therefore apply only to voluntary prayers, לפנים משורת הדין. I'll clarify that shortly בע\"ה.</li>\n<li>Many people I've asked have responded pretty sharply [as usual without clear sources]: You cannot use this as an excuse to skip all your prayers. What is in the siddur's prayer service, or - at least - whatever we can determine is from the Anshei Knesses Hagedolah, you ought to be saying. It's a terrible slippery slope to start skipping half the davening.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let me bring an idea I once heard from R' Tzvi Berkowitz shlit\"a. He called it \"blackmailing Hashem\". Say A is required, B and C are not acceptable. Someone might say, Well, you should be happy I did B, because I might have done C which is even worse!<br />\n-You should be happy I only said <em>some</em> of the prayers, but with kavannah, because I might have just bopped through all of them fast without any kavannah at all, like so many other people.<br />\n-You should be happy I said the prayers at least, even if I paid zero attention, because so many other people skip and don't say all of them or even any of them.<br />\nYou can't do either one. There are set prayers, and you must say them with proper concentration and kavannah.<br />\nOf course, if you really can't, then that Rambam and the Shulchan Aruch suggest alternatives. You're late for the minyan and can't say all of them properly, skip these and then these. Optional additions, the Tur says it's better only to say what you can say properly. You just came from a journey and can't think straight - don't pray till you can!<br />\nBut one needs to be erlich and there's a reason the Rambam gave a case of coming from a difficult journey. It probably isn't a proper excuse that you aren't in the mood right now.</p>\n<p>On the \"slippery slope\" argument quoted above, I would add that the slippery slope runs both ways, and I think we might be pretty far down the other way! I'm not sure that the average person davening knows that if he is just rattling off the words without kavannah, he needs to stop doing that and do something else. Could be he heard enough times, \"Well, what are you going to do - not daven?\" that he thinks this is fine b'dieved, and he'll work on it when he's older.</p>\n<p>After all this, I need to point out that I did not say a word about what \"kavannah\" means exactly. See that Rambam further on, see the R' Chaim, see the poskim. That is an important part of the issue, of course. I don't mean to suggest that something isn't good enough if it really is. And, it would be a further discussion how to choose tradeoffs between different <em>levels</em> of kavannah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is not a direct answer to your question but it's worth mentioning here for any readers. I have a Rambam \"Siddur\" that has every prayer needed for every Jewish event and it all fits into one book. But if you hand this siddur to an average Jew today they will marvel at all the prayers that are \"missing.\" However, the reality is that most of the prayers that we take for granted as being necessary are often recent additions and aren't really required. Even such \"standard prayers\" like Modeh Ani weren't considered essential even in the time of the Shulchan Arukh. Rambam's son famously complained that people didn't have the proper Kawwanah for the Amidah (required prayer) because they were up all night doing dirges/selihot which aren't required at all.</p>\n<p>Based on this I've advised friends who struggle with having enough Kawwanah for prayers to spend time finding out what prayers are actually required vs recent additions/recommendations. Because it's certainly possible that they (or you) have enough proper concentration for the required prayers, but maybe not for all the additions that fill many siddurs nowadays.</p>\n<p>When praying alone I use the Rambam siddur or a similar Yemenite siddur so that way I can focus on my prayer and not have to spend mental energy filtering everything else out. I reserve my Sephardic and Ashkenazic siddurs to be used when I'm at synagogue.</p>\n\n\n",

The person I spoke with insisted the the yod would create a sound exactly the same as ַי . Conversely, if we take the word חַיֵינוּ I would pronounce it cha-yeh-nu rather than chai-yeh-nu. For לְהַחַיוֹת I would pronounce it l’ha-cha-yot rather than l’ha-chai-yot. That said, one example he offered was דַיֵנּ. To provide some context, I taught myself Hebrew as an adult which makes me less confident when more experienced people talk to me about the finer details of pronunciation.

This fanciful explanation found no credence, even among Karaites.\" (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/karaitehalakahit00reverich/page/4/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pg. 4</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And in Kirkisani's (translated) words (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23502854?refreqid=excelsior%3Ace75b1027e7e28f582b7ed49a594764a&seq=9#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">HUCA VII, pg. 322-325</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Jeroboam was the first who introduced differences in religion and sowed rebellion in Israel after the establishment of the kingdom by making changes and alterations in the laws...This is what the Scripture reports concerning the differences and innovations introduced by Jeroboam...After the Samaritans appeared the chiefs of the Assembly, i.e., the (chiefs of the) Rabbanites, namely at the (time of the) second Temple...The Rabbanites acknowledged the authority of (the members of) the Assembly, merely because they, too, were following the licentious customs inherited from Jeroboam...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That's one view - that the Oral Law was invented by King Yerov'am in order to ensure that the schism between the Kingdom of Judah and the Kingdom of Israel become permanent, and the sages carried on this legacy.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Revel continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The Karaites felt keenly the need of some account of their origin that would silence the reproach of the Rabbanites and found in the event recorded in the Baraita (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Kiddushin.66a.8-12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 66a</a>; see Josephus <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link132HCH0013\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ant. XIII, 13</a>, 5) a basis for claim of ancient origin for their sect. As stated in that narrative, the disagreement between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hyrcanus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">John Hyrcanus</a> and the teachers of the Law resulted in the extermination of the latter, excepting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simeon_ben_Shetach\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Simeon b. Shatah</a>. As a consequence, ignorance of the Law prevailed until Simeon appeared and reinstated it.</p>\n<p>\"והיה העולם משתומם עד שבא שמעון בן שטח והחזיר התורה ליושנה\" Simeon, say the Karaites, being at that time the sole authority, introduced many innovations upon his return and changed the true interpretation of the Law. To enforce these new laws, he invented the fiction that besides the Written there is also an Oral Law given to Moses on Sinai and handed down from generation to generation, and that the laws proclaimed by him went back to this real tradition.</p>\n<p>The people followed him blindly. But some of them, knowing the false basis of these changes, rejected them and adhered to the ancient Tradition in all its purity; those were the Karaites.\" (<a href=\"https://archive.org/details/karaitehalakahit00reverich/page/5/mode/1up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pg. 5</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And that's the second view - that it was invented by Rabbi Shimon ben Shetach as part of a conspiracy to convince all of the Jews that these \"new\" laws had always been around.</p>\n<p>See the footnotes in the book for a list of Karaites who state this and quotes from their books.</p>\n\n\n",

He's always called a \"navi\", a prophet. From an initial search online, I found that the term appears in the Alshech's commentary on Daniel, as well as multiple old Machzorim from the last 500 years or so (I have yet to search older ones):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"וזהו אומרו ה' הקשיבה כי תבחר ותקרב אותנו על ידי הסליחה וגם כי כאשר תסלח ותעביר אשמותינו גם כי לא נעתיר אליך תשיב שבותנו כי אותו יעדת על ידי <strong>ירמיה חוזך</strong> אשר אוחילה לפניך הוא על המהירות שלא תתמהמה...\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chavatzelet_HaSharon_on_Daniel.9.19.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I was wondering if anyone knows the origin of the term. Why is Yirmiyahu referred to here as a \"seer\" (note that most prophets are called \"navi\" and only precious few received other titles (Yechezkel - \"tzofeh\", Shmuel - \"ro'eh\" and a handful of \"chozim\" - <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/I_Chronicles.21.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gad</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Amos.7.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Amos</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.12.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ido</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.19.2?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chanani (or Yehu or both)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.29.30?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Asaf</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/II_Chronicles.35.15?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yedutun</a>)? And is it known who first used the phrase?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Commenting on II Kings 17:13 (which employs both the term “navi” and the term “chozeh”) Ralbag explains that a chozeh has a greater form of prophecy than a navi:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וידמה שהחוזה הוא יותר שלם מהנביא כי הנביא יקרא נביא אפילו בא אליו דבר ה’ בחלום כאמרו אם יהיה נביאכם ה’ במראה אליו אתודע בחלום אדבר בו ואולם החוזה יקרא אשר יבא אליו דבר ה’ במראה והוא למעלה מהחלום</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this, Yirmiyahu being called a chozeh may be indicative of his stature as a superior prophet (as he is indeed classified by Rambam as I mentioned <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/22946/how-many-prophets-were-there-and-who-were-they/93425#93425\">here</a>).</p>\n\n\n",

To be honest it's a little hard to understand his intent. At the very least, this is how the contemporary <em>sefer</em> <strong>Shalal Rav</strong> <em>Sukkos</em> p. 121 understands him. He explains the reason is because אני השם אלוקיכם tells us that this <em>mitzvah</em> requires an acceptance of Hashem as our Lord. If we don't fulfill the <em>mitzvah</em>, even if we wanted to and were prevented, nevertheless we didn't \"accept him as our Lord\".</p>\n<p>The Meshech Chochmah gives a few examples, like the <em>mitzvah</em> of Shofar and Sukkah, which mention אני השם אלוקיכם.</p>\n<p>Worth noting is the <a href=\"https://parshaponders.com/sukkos-5779/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasam Sofer</a> seems to disagree, as he explicitly applies the above principle to Sukkah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.6?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Exodus.6.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi in Parshas Vaera</a> says that usually this is a warning that Hashem will reward those who keep the mitzvos and punish those who don't:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויאמר אליו אני ה'. נֶאֱמָן לְשַׁלֵּם שָׂכָר טוֹב לַמִּתְהַלְּכִים לְפָנַי, וְלֹא לְחִנָּם שְׁלַחְתִּיךָ כִּי אִם לְקַיֵּם דְּבָרִי שֶׁדִּבַּרְתִּי לָאָבוֹת הָרִאשׁוֹנִים. וּבַלָּשׁוֹן הַזֶּה מָצִינוּ שֶׁהוּא נִדְרָשׁ בְּכַמָּה מְקוֹמוֹת אֲנִי ה' נֶאֱמָן לְהִפָּרַע – כְּשֶׁהוּא אָמוּר אֵצֶל עֹנֶשׁ – כְּגוֹן \"וְחִלַּלְתָּ אֶת שֵׁם אֱלֹהֶיךָ אֲנִי ה'\" (ויקרא י״ט:י״ב), וּכְשֶׁהוּא אוֹמֵר אֵצֶל קִיּוּם מִצְווֹת – כְּגוֹן \"וּשְׁמַרְתֶּם מִצְוֹתַי וַעֲשִׂיתֶם אוֹתָם אֲנִי ה'\" (שם כ\"ב) – נֶאֱמָן לִתֵּן שָׂכָר:<br />\nAND HE SAID UNTO HIM, I AM THE LORD, Who am faithful to recompense with a full reward those who walk before Me. Nor have I sent you with no purpose in view (cf. 5:22), but to fulfil the promise which I made to the early patriarchs. In this sense we find that the phrase is to be explained in many passages: אני ה׳ signifies, I am the Lord, Who am faithful to exact punishment — when it is spoken in reference to a matter that demands punishment, as, for instance, (Leviticus 19:12) “And thou profanest the name of thy God; I am the Lord”; and when it is spoken in reference to observing the Divine commands — as in, (Leviticus 22:31) “Ye shall keep my commandments and do them; I am the Lord” — it signifies, “I am the Lord Who am faithful to give reward.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I assume the mitzvos that have this added are more difficult mitzvos that need extra encouragement.</p>\n\n\n",

The difference here is that instead of preserving him to survive the transport to a hospital, we preserve him to survive the passage of time until the technology to resuscitate him becomes available. From this point of view, we are not cryopreserving a dead person. Instead we are preserving someone who is still alive and able to be revived, from irreparably destabilizing and decomposing (i.e. dying).</p>\n\n\n",

HaShem spoke to Avraham Avinu many times; why here was an angel used (twice!)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>So the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.11?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Malbim_on_Genesis.22.11.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim</a> takes a novel approach:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויקרא אליו מלאך ה'. הנה הדבור קח נא את בנך היה ע\"י ה' בעצמו, והקריאה אל תשלח היה ע\"י מלאך ולמה לא עכבו ה' בעצמו. הנה מלבד מה שיתבאר שהיה נסיון גם בזה, י\"ל עפ\"י מ\"ש חז\"ל שמכל מצוה יולד מלאך שליח ה' לגמלו טוב בעד המצוה ההיא כמ\"ש שכר מצוה מצוה, שהמצוה עצמה תגמלהו שכרו, <strong>והנה מצוה הגדולה הזאת נגמרה עתה בשלמות בכל פרטיה ונברא ממנה מלאך ה'</strong>, אבל אם היה אברהם שוחט את יצחק, אז היה נחשב כרוצח, כי לא היה רצון ה' רק שיעלהו לא שישחטהו, <strong>וע\"כ קרא אליו מלאך הזה בעצמו לעכבו מן המעשה שבה תלוי מציאותו וקיומו</strong>, וע\"כ אמר במד' שהמלאכים בכו כשרצה אברהם לשחוט את יצחק, רצו שהמלאכים שנבראו מן המצוה הזאת שהיה בה כמה חלקים, הקיחה וההליכה ובנין המזבח ועריכת העצים והעקדה והעליה על המזבח, שמכ\"א נברא מלאך, וחיות המלאך וקיומו הוא מן המצוה הזאת, ואם היה שוחט אותו היו כל המעשים הקודמים הכנה אל רצח ותועבת ה', וע\"כ בכו מלאכים אלה כי יהיו כאין וכאפס</p>\n<p>And an angel of Hashem called to him - The request to 'take now your son...\" came through Hashem Himself, and yet the calling out to not send (his hand i.e. to kill)  was done through an angel. Why didn't Hashem Himself delay it? (I.e. why the need for the angel if the original command came directly from Hashem). It must be that  that there was a test in this also. One can answer as per Chazal, that out of every mitzvah (command) an angel of G-d is born to reward him well for that mitzvah, like it writes, the reward for performing a mitzvah is another mitzvah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.4.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 4:2</a>) i.e. that the mitzvah itself will reward him for his reward. <strong>And here this great mitzvah has now ended in its entirety in all its details and an angel of G-d was created from it</strong>. But if Avraham had slaughtered Yitzchak, he would then be considered a murderer, because it was not the will of G-d; (Hashem's intention was) only for him to ascend and not to be slaughtered. <strong>And so this angel himself called upon him to prevent him from the act on which his reality and existence depended</strong>. Therefore, it says in the Midrash that the angels wept when Abraham wanted to slaughter Isaac, the angels wanted that he (this angel) be created from this commandment which had several parts - the taking and the going, the building of the altar, the arranging of the wood, the binding, and the ascending to the altar - each action created the angel, and the life of the angel and his existence is from this mitzvah, and if he (Avraham) had slaughtered him (Yitzchak), all the earlier actions would have been preparation for murder and abomination of G-d . Therefore, these angels wept that there would be absolutely nothing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As far as the subsequent, second calling:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Radak_on_Genesis.22.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> writes that the angel was now informing him that as compensation for what he had just been prepared to do, Hashem would likewise compensate his children when the occasion would arise to do so.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Alternatively, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.22.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> asserts that the angel was acting as an intermediary for G-d and he was given permission to speak on behalf of Hashem.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.22.15?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Tzror_HaMor_on_Torah%2C_Genesis.22.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tzror Hamor</a> notes that since the angel had been involved first time round, he returned a second time to speak with him. He posits that Avraham at that point must have been wondering over the turn of events, i.e. that he had come incredibly close to killing his son and that he had been commanded to  sacrifice his son, only for nothing to then actually happen. He was therefore carefully weighing everything up, deliberating if he had acted in the correct manner. Thus the angel came a second time to put his mind to rest.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Tosafos addresses the fact that a Jew is exempt if they perform an abortion, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.57b.2?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Sanhedrin.57b.2.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">whereas a non-Jew is executed</a>. Tosafos clarifies that a Jew is also forbidden, just exempt from capital punishment.</p>\n<p>However, the <em>gemarra</em> says that as long as the head didn't come out, it's permissible to abort a baby to save the mother's life. Tosafos assumes <strong>this isn't permitted</strong> for a non-Jew. This seems to break the rule that nothing is forbidden for a non-Jew and permitted for a Jew. Tosafos explains that this is an exemption to the rule, for this is a case where it's a <em>mitzvah</em> for the Jew to save the mother. Something can be forbidden for a non-Jew, yet a <em>mitzvah</em> for a Jew, as we see by Shabbos (see the earlier comments of Tosafos, which I didn't copy).</p>\n<p>Tosafos then ends off that <strong>perhaps it's permitted</strong> for a non-Jew to abort the fetus to save the mother.</p>\n<p>What exactly is Tosafos' doubt? I'm looking for Achronim who speak this out.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I found the Minchas Chinuch in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Minchat_Chinukh.296.1.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mitzvah 296 (4-7)</a> has a long debate about what exactly the status of an embryo is in relation to the laws of murder and how it relates to a Non-Jew. For a full background, see the whole piece. Relevant to this Tosfos here is what he says;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואם רודף אחר עובר להרגו דהיינו דרודף אחר האם ורוצה להרוג העובר תליא במ\"ש לעיל אם נקרא נפש כי ב\"נ נהרג על העוברין רשאי חבירו להרוג אותו אבל כבר כ' שנ\"ל דגם אצל ב\"נ לא נקרא ש\"ד אלא הוי כמו שאר עבירות אם כן אסור לחבירו להרגו כי לא מקרי רודף כנ\"ל בעזה\"י. ובישראל שרוצה להרוג עוברין פשיטא דלא מקרי רודף ואסור לחבירו להרוג עליו כי לאו בכלל נפש הוא. <strong>שוב מצאתי בתוס' סנהדרין נ\"ט ע\"א ד\"ה ליכא מידעם שכתבו שם מתחלה דקודם שיצא ראשו דבישראל מותר לחתוך העובר ובב\"נ אסור כיון דמוזהר על העוברין כצד הראשון שכתבנו ואח\"ז כתבו דאפשר גם בב\"נ שרי לחתוך העובר. נראה מדבריהם דספוקי מספקא להו דין הנ\"ל וגם כתבו סתם דחיה יכולה לחתוך נראה דאף משום הצלת אחר מותר הב\"נ</strong> ומכל מקום צ\"ע בדינים אלו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, the way he explains the \"safek\" of Tosfos is if we say that for a Non-Jew an unborn fetus is the same as a born one, or if we say that just like for a Jew it is not considered a Nefesh, so to for a Non-Jew, even if it is prohibited, it is not murder. The difference would be in a case of someone chasing after a woman to make an abortion, are they considered a rodef? If it is considered a Nefesh then the one performing the abortion is a Rodef, if not then they are just doing an aveira but are not a rodef. According to the second way of understanding, since it is not murder, it would be permitted in a case of saving a life. However, if it is considered murder, that is not permitted in order to save a life since regardless a life is being lost.</p>\n<p>(As an aside, another point that is brought out from Tosfos, even if it is not murder, it is still assur. For a Jew all issurim are mutar for Pikuach Nefesh, however while a Non-Jew themselves can do all issurim to save their own life, it is not clear if another Non-Jew can perform an issur to save their life or only the person in sakana themselves. If it is assur for an outsider to perform an issur, it would be prohibbited for a non-jew to perform the abortion. Tosfos seems to say that a doctor would be allowed to perform the abortion if we say it is not a nefesh, even though they are doing it only to save someone else, not themselves. However he doesn't seem to indicate that this is the Safek of Tosfos, but rather a point that Tosfos holds).</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Rabbi Yosef Maman and the Bukharian Jews\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to Wikipedia, <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%95%D7%A1%D7%A3_%D7%9E%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yosef Maman</a>, a Shad\"ar who came to Bukhara in the late 18th century, discovered that the Bukharian Jews believed they were descendants of the Ten Tribes and used the Persian Nusach, which was based on Rav Saadya's siddur (and, at the time, not used anymore by the Persian Jews themselves). Rabbi Maman <a href=\"https://beta.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpagefeed.aspx?req=25473&pgnum=20\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">told them</a> that they were actually originally Spanish Jews and convinced them to use the Spanish Nusach.</p>\n<p>Changing a nusach is a big deal. According to Wikipedia, not everyone agreed with Rabbi Maman's opinion. I was wondering if it's known what made him think they were descendants of Spanish Jews. Did he have some sort of tradition? And is there perhaps a more in-depth discussion somewhere about this particular story?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>So it turns out that there are a number of books that discuss the history of the Bukharian Jews including this important turning-point in their history, such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>מסע בארץ הקדם by אפרים ניימארק</li>\n<li>מבוכארה לירושלים by גיורא פוזיילוב</li>\n<li>מסירות נפש של יהודי בוכרה by שלמה ניאזוב</li>\n<li>שלוחי ארץ ישראל by אברהם יערי</li>\n<li>תולדות יהודי בוכארה by נסים טג'ר</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On whether it is known why Rabbi Maman made this claim, Giyora Pozeilov wrote in his book מבוכארה לירושלים (From Bukhara to Yerushalayim), p. 39:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"לא ידוע לנו אם באמת סבור היה חכם יוסף כי הם מגולי ספרד, או שמא התכוון ביודעין להפיץ בקרבם את מנהגי יהודי ספרד כדי לקשרם אל אחיהם בשאר תפוצות ישראל ולעשותם חטיבה אחת בהלכה ובמנהג.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Translation: \"It is not known whether Chacham Yosef truly thought that they were descendants of the exiled from Spain, or perhaps he intended to spread among them the traditions of the Sephardic Jews to connect them to the rest of their brethren in the Jewish diaspora and to make them a unified unit in halacha and tradition.\"</p>\n<p>As a side-note, it turns out that when Rabbi Maman was there, a Yemenite rabbi named Rabbi Zechariah Matzliach was also there trying to spread the Yemenite traditions among the Bukharians, and a rivalry broke out between the two and their students. Whenever the students of Rabbi Maman claimed that prior to his arrival, the Bukharians were illiterate boors, the students of Rabbi Matzliach countered and claimed that it is known there were Bukharian poets in the 18th century, as well as Jews who died as a Kiddush Hashem. Other evidence presented by some of the other authors suggests that the situation was far from being as-bad as described by that one source that states that Rabbi Maman found an illiterate, boorish and practically spiritually-desolate community.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why we start to say Barchi Nafshi only from Bereshit Sidra?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Ashkenazim Minhag is to say Pirkei Avot all along the summer and Barchi Nafshi after Shabat Mincha in winter. Usually the only gaps are Shabat Tshuva and Shabat Hagadol, when there is used to be the Rabbi speech to all the community. However, sometimes there are gaps like this year. The previous Shabat we said neither Pirkei Avot nor Barchi Nafshi. My question is why the Minhag to say Barchi Nafshi starts only from Bereshit Sidra and on and not from the first Shabat that we stop to say Pirkei Avot (and is not Shabat Tshuva)?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I'm not sure if by \"why\" you mean \"what's the reason behind it\" or \"what's the source for this custom\". If it's the latter, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.624.5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Rema</strong> to <strong>Shulchan Aruch</strong> <em>Orach Chaim</em> 624:5</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אין אומרים תחינות ולא צו\"ץ מי\"כ עד סוכות</p>\n<p>We don't say Tachanun or Tzidkasecha from Yom Kippur until Sukkos</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.624.5?lang=he&p2=Mishnah_Berurah.625.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Mishnah Berurah</strong></a> (§ 18) adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולא פרקים ולא שיר המעלות</p>\n<p>And not Pirkei Avos, nor Shir HaMa'alos (Barchi Nafshi)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I'm not sure where your premise came from but he says we say neither from Yom Kippur until Sukkos, which would seemingly include Shemini Atzeres and Simchas Torah. Thus, the first week we would say Barchi Nafshi would be Shabbos Bereishis.</p>\n<p>Now, looking into the reasons, the Rema in his <strong>Darkei Moshe</strong> (<em>ad. loc.</em>) cites the <strong>Maharil</strong>. There, the Maharil writes that we don't say Tachanun between Yom Kippur and Sukkos, because those four days are a gift to the Jews, that their sins aren't counted, as it says in the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.651.8?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Yalkut Shimoni</strong> § 651</a>, quoting <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tanchuma,_Emor.22.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Midrash Tanchuma</strong> <em>Emor</em> § 22</a>) that Sukkos is the beginning of the accounting of sins. According to this, the Rema only meant the four days between Yom Kippur and Sukkos. This also doesn't seem to explain why not say Barchi Nafshi.</p>\n<p>Now, the Mishnah Berurah in his <strong>Sha'ar HaTizyun</strong> (§ 22) cites what he writes about Pirkei Avos and Barchi Nafshi from <strong>Derech HaChaim</strong>, in the name of <strong>Eliyah Rabbah</strong>. I don't have access to Derech HaChaim, but the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eliyah_Rabbah_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.624.14?lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eliyah Rabbah</a> (§ 14) says not to say it, as \"he\" writes at the end of Simman 669. Now, the Eliyah Rabbah is a commentary on the <strong>Levush</strong>, so I assume he's referring to him. Indeed, I see the Levush at the end of Simman 669 writes extensively about this. I don't know how to provide an accessible link to it (here's <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/en/book/book.php?book=147099&pagenum=527\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar HaChochmah</a>, which isn't free), but I'll summarize what he writes:</p>\n<p>He says we start saying Barchi Nafshi on Shabbos Bereishis. The reason is because the entire chapter of Barchi Nafshi discusses creation. We subsequently read it every Shabbos afterwards, in order to remember the act of creation. He says the 15 Shir HaMa'alos are for the same reason.</p>\n<p>He then says the reason we don't say Barchi Nafshi or Pirkei Avos on a Shabbos which has Yom Tov on it, is because there's a rule Yom Tov has to be חצי לשם וחצי לכם, half for Hashem and half for you. Since we say Barchi Nafshi after Mincha, that occurs in our half. This is unlike all other Shabboses, as they're entirely dedicated to Hashem. He says that since if Yom Tov would be on Shabbos we wouldn't say them, we also don't say them on Shabbos Chol HaMoed. He says this is also why we don't say them in the Shabboses between Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkos. Honestly, I don't get this last point.</p>\n<p>For what it's worth, in my Artscroll Yom Kippur Machzor, in the \"Laws\" section, the very last law (§ 158) says we don't say Tachanun, Av Harachamim, Tzidkasecha, Pirkei Avos, or Barchi Nafshi, between Yom Kippur and Sukkos, as these days are the days that the Temple was dedicated (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Moed_Katan.9a.4\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Moed Katan 9a</strong></a>). They cite the Rema and Mishnah Berurah, although these sources didn't say this reason. It does appear in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.624.5?lang=he&p2=Beur_HaGra_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.624.5.10&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><strong>Biur HaGra</strong></a>, however (he also brings the reason of the Maharil). This reason doesn't seem satisfying, as why not say Pirkei Avos or Barchi Nafshi? Perhaps they only meant the Tachanun etc. which are mournful (this is clearly the intent of the Gra, who doesn't mention Pirkei Avos/Barchi Nafshi). In any event, this also only explains up until Sukkos.</p>\n\n\n",

Yom Kippur (8:9) says that Yom Kippur is not mechapeir sins that are bein adam l'chaveiro, between a man and his friend. Therefore, it seems that our prayers for forgiveness on that day should be centered on sins between ourselves and hamakom because for those, the day is efficacious. But in the litany of sins (the al cheit) we confess and ask forgiveness for, the following sins (<em>or sin categories</em>) are included:</p>\n<p>hona'at re'a</p>\n<p>zilzul horim umorim</p>\n<p>chozek yad</p>\n<p>chapat shochad</p>\n<p>lashon hara</p>\n<p>masa u'vmatan</p>\n<p>neshech u'vmarbit</p>\n<p>tzdiyat re'a</p>\n<p>r'chiliut</p>\n<p>I can understand how one could extend any of these to include an aspect of bein adam l'makom, or how some could be offensive to hashem even though they don't somehow, rise to the level of actionable when involving another person in a certain way, but some these, especially ones about extortion or bribing seem pretty clearly about our interactions with others. If so, why are they included if Yom Kippur is not designed to be mechapeir them?</p>\n<p>Or are there other sins which are not on this list that are purely between people so they aren't covered but somehow, the ones on this list are.

[This is] as our Rabbis, may their memory be blessed, said (Bava Kamma 110a) concerning a robber or one who swears falsely [about his debt] who is obligated to pay the principal and a fifth, and to bring a guilt-offering - that one who brings his theft before he has brought his guilt-offering has fulfilled [his obligation]; his guilt-offering before he has brought his theft has not fulfilled [his obligation]. For it is stated concerning the robber of a convert that has no heirs, such that [the robber] must give the repayments to a priest, (Numbers 5:8) “then the guilt shall be to the Lord for the priest; besides the ram of atonement with which atonement is made on his behalf.” Its explanation: The guilt that is mentioned in this verse is referring to the repayment - from the usage (Numbers 5:7), “and he shall give it to whom he is guilty.” And he brings the repayment [first], “besides the ram of atonement with which atonement is made on his behalf” afterwards.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

How do we reconcile the dichotomy?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As has been mentioned, for the most part Yoav is regarded as a Tzaddik who unfortunately erred which led to his eventual demise.</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.49a.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 49a</a> has already been mentioned in the comments that Yoav's house was open to all, or alternatively is to be understood as being clean from theft or immorality, but it also adds there the verse from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Chronicles.11.8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Divrei HaYamim I 11:8</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְיוֹאָ֕ב יְחַיֶּ֖ה אֶת־שְׁאָ֥ר הָעִֽיר</p>\n<p>And Yoav kept alive the rest of the city</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The gemara understands from there that he made a point of not only sustaining the poor but even going so far as providing them with various kinds of delicacies.</p>\n<p>In addition, it is worth noting the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesikta_Rabbati.11.1?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesikta Rabbasi 11</a> which sheds more light on how much of a tzaddik Yoav was. Firstly it notes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר לו יוסף ה' על העם כהם וכהם מאה פעמים (שמואל שם ג') ולמה לא אמר כברכת משה רבו משה אמר יוסף עליכם ככם אלף פעמים (דברים א' י\"א) ויואב אמר מאה פעמים אלא ברכתו של יואב הייתה טובה משל משה אמר ועיני אדני המלך רואות (שמואל שם שם) אמר לו בימיך יהא כן</p>\n<p>He (Yoav) said to him (Dovid), \"May the LORD your G-d increase the number of the people a hundredfold\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.24.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel II 24:3</a>). And why did he not say it like the blessing of Moshe? Moshe said \"Increase your numbers a thousandfold\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.1.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim 1:11</a>) - i.e. Yoav said \"hundredfold\"? Rather it must be be that Yoav's blessing was better than that of Moshe. He (Yoav) said, \"While your own eyes see it\" (Shmuel Ibid.) i.e. Yoav said to Dovid that the blessing will be in your lifetime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And then it continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ואתה מוצא חכם יושב ראשו של סנהדרין היה יושב בשבת תחכמוני (שם כ\"ג ח') הוא היה יואב שהיה גדול בתורה וגיבור במלחמה</p>\n<p>And you find that he (Yoav) was a sage that sat as the head of the Sanhedrin. He was Yosheiv Basheves Tachkemoni (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/II_Samuel.23.8?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shmuel 23:8</a>) - this was Yoav who was great in Torah and mighty in battle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So from Pesikta Rabbasi we find in addition to the Gemara in Sanhedrin that shows his charitable side, that his blessing to Dovid was further reaching than Moshe's equivalent bracha as it would be realised in Dovid's lifetime, and that he was also considered a great sage.</p>\n\n\n",

It is for this reason that bamboo carpet mats cannot be used for schach as they are mekabel tumah. All Star-K certified schach is not made to sit or walk on and is therefore not mekabel tumah.</p>\n<p>In addition, l’chatchila, kosher schach may not be supported by anything which is mekabel tumah (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.629.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama O.C. 629:7</a>).

Therefore, Rav Moshe Feinstein explains that wooden venetian blinds held together with cloth tape or string are not kosher for schach. It follows that according to Rashi bamboo slats held together by multi-filament cord (i.e. it is braided or twisted) are also not kosher for schach (even if they are not made to sit or walk on).</p>\n<p>However, monofilament (commonly used for fishing line) is not woven or spun material. Therefore, it is not mekabel tumah and may be used to hold bamboo slats together. All Star-K certified bamboo schach is held together with monofilament cord.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So based on this, it would only be an issue if the string is woven or spun which would make it mekabel tumah. If it isn't it would be allowed to hold the slats together.</p>\n\n\n",

How do Jews discern genuine spiritual experiences from hallucinations or 'mind tricks' in general?</p>\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: this question is inspired by a <a href=\"https://christianity.stackexchange.com/q/86124/50422\">similar question</a> recently asked on Christianity Stack Exchange.</p>\n<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: I'm not sure if my choice of tags was the best. If it wasn't, amendments by more experienced users will be appreciated.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As time has gone on, Jews have tended to believe in miracles and hallucinations less and less. Jews originally believed in exorcisms, and discussed how to perform them in the Talmud and other ancient texts. But thanks to the modern psychology movement almost no Jews believe in exorcism anymore.</p>\n<p>I would argue that for a modern Jew to believe his spiritual experience was real he would probably be like Moses when confronting the burning bush.</p>\n<p>In Exodus 3-4 we see Moses struggle with his spiritual experience. In the end Moses wasn't convinced by the signs that God had shown him, and he said that other people wouldn't believe him. Therefore God gave Moses signs that OTHERS would also see. And God and Moses even expect that people won't believe just from the first sign, but might need the second or even the third miraculous sign.</p>\n<p>In that vein I think most Jews would only believe that their vision from God was real if there was a later physical manifestation that others could see.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>According to Mamionides, one of the basic fundamentals of Jewish belief is belief in prophecy, especially the prophecy of Moses. The concept of prophecy is difficult to  relate to, because according to tradition it has not been around since the time of the second Temple. However, part of the experience of true prophecy is the clarity that this is real prophecy. This goes beyond normal intellectual certainty, as the clarity is divine.</p>\n<p>However, this alone is not a \"proof\" so to speak, because based on logic alone, the argument is circular. The real proof is the historical experience of prophecy given to the Jewish nation at Sinai. Personal experiences of spirituality, while very meaningful to those who had them, are absolutely useless for convincing skeptics of anything.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The answers given above are excellent. I want to mention another aspect of belief in spiritual experience/prophecy; verification.</p>\n<p>As in most aspects of Judaism, a healthy amount of skepticism is required. In the case of prophecy, for instance, a double measure is necessitated to prevent charismatic people from convincing the nation that they are prophets.</p>\n<h2>Mass Revelation as A Proof</h2>\n<p>One of the major 'proofs' for Judaism is that the initial prophetic insight they received at Mount Sinai was a mass event. Other major religions, such as Christianity or Islam, have a single founder who claimed prophecy, whereas ~three million Jews at Mount Sinai had the <em>exact same</em> experience. Even if one were to claim that someone dosed the entire nation with LSD before the supposed event, it is without doubt that each person would have a dramatically individual \"trip\"/hallucination, and not leave that nation-building event with a cohesive understanding and goal, nor with a commonly shared experience that would stand up to the many arguments and quarrels the famously stubborn nation had.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Mount Sinai revelation was supposed to have been experienced (at least in part) by the entire population of the world. Even barring a miraculous/prophetic transmission, I claim at least preliminary scientific backing for this by examining the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1883_eruption_of_Krakatoa\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Krakatoa eruption</a> where the sound waves circled the earth multiple times, enabling literally the entire plane to experience the event. Nonetheless, the Mount Sinai revelation has been undisputed fact in major religions and society for thousands of years.</p>\n<h2>Testing Individual Prophets</h2>\n<p>How do we prove the veracity of prophecy that does not come via mass revelation?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now if you say to yourself, \"How will we know the word that the Lord\ndid not speak? If the prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, and the thing does not occur and does not come about, that is the thing the Lord did not speak. The prophet has spoken it wantonly; you shall not be afraid of him. (Devarim - Deuteronomy - Chapter 18)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi writes on this verse that you must slay such a prophet, if his prophecy is proven to be incorrect.  He also writes that the admonition \"do not be afraid of him\" means \"do not be afraid to prosecute him (and kill him) because of fear that you will incur punishment\".</p>\n<p>Additionally, Rashi states in the same verse that a prophet that claims that the Jewish nation is no longer required/allowed to perform certain biblical commandments  (Rambam adds the test if he tries to establish a new religion (as Jesus did)), he is <em>by default</em> a false prophet, even if his prophecy came true. Rambam further discusses it</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, if a person will arise, whether Jew or gentile, and perform\na sign or wonder and say that God sent him to:</p>\n<p>a) add a mitzvah,</p>\n<p>b) withdraw a mitzvah</p>\n<p>c) explain a mitzvah in a manner which differs from the tradition\nreceived from Moses, or</p>\n<p>d) if he says that the mitzvot commanded to the Jews are not forever,\nbut rather were given for a limited time,</p>\n<p>he is a false prophet. He comes to deny the prophecy of Moses and\nshould be executed by strangulation, because he dared to make\nstatements in God's name which God never made. (\nYesodei haTorah - Chapter Nine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, there is a provision for a temporary ability to overrule biblical commandments by \"someone who is widely known to be an expert and a complete and total righteous person, such as Elijah the Prophet on Mount Carmel, for at that time offering sacrifices on personal alters was forbidden\" (Rashi, ibid).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When a prophet - who has already proven himself to be a prophet -\ninstructs us to violate one of the mitzvot of the Torah or many\nmitzvot, whether they be of a severe or light nature, for a limited\namount of time, it is a mitzvah to listen to him\n(Rambam - Yesodei haTorah - Chapter Nine)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Additionally, if a prophet prophesies calamity and it fails to occur, he is not immediately proven a false prophet. Only if he prophesies a positive outcome which fails to pass, is he immediately labelled a false prophet. As Rambam writes</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As to calamities predicted by a prophet, if, for example, he foretells\nthe death of a certain individual or declares that in particular year\nthere will be famine or war and so forth, the non-fulfillment of his\nforecast does not disprove his prophetic character. We are not to say,\n“See, he spoke G‑d does not retract from a promise He has made of good,\nor peace, or return and his prediction has not come to pass.” For G‑d\nis long-suffering and abounding in kindness and repents of evil. It\nmay also be that those who were threatened repented and were therefore\nforgiven, as happened to the men of Nineveh. Possibly too, the\nexecution of the sentence is only deferred, as in the case of\nHezekiah. But if the prophet, in the name of G‑d, assures good\nfortune, declaring that a particular event would come to pass, and the\nbenefit promised has not been realized, he is unquestionably a false\nprophet, for no blessing decreed by the Almighty, even if promised\nconditionally, is ever revoked . . . Hence we learn that only when he\npredicts good fortune can the prophet be tested</p>\n<p>Yesodei haTorah 10:4</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, the only way to test a prophet is to test a positive prophecy he or she makes.</p>\n<p>Often miracles were used by prophets to partially prove their veracity (such as Moses did in front of Pharaoh's magicians).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not everyone who performs signs or wonders should be accepted as a\nprophet: only a person who is known to be fit for prophecy beforehand;\ni.e. his wisdom and his [good] deeds surpass those of all his\ncontemporaries. If he follows the paths of prophecy in holiness,\nseparating himself from worldly matters, and afterwards performs a\nsign or wonder and states that he was sent by G‑d, it is a mitzvah to\nlisten to him (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380357/jewish/Becoming-a-Prophet.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Yesodei haTorah - Chapter Seven, Verse 7</a>), as the verse states: \"Listen to him\" (Deut. 18:15).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/5183322/jewish/Prophecy-in-Judaism.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">This link</a> has a more in-depth layout of prophecy in Judaism.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/dailystudy/rambam.asp?tdate=5/25/2022&rambamChapters=3\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam in Chapter seven</a> discusses how prophecy works.

The Midrash notes how both Doeg and Achisophel were considered rich in Torah as they were both heads of the Sanhedrin however they did not do enough with this 'wealth' and were accordingly destined to fail. Similarly, those who are 'poor' means those who have the ability to learn but choose not to.

It is worth noting that it says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.4.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 4:3</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>בְּנֵ֥י אִ֡ישׁ</strong> עַד־מֶ֬ה כְבוֹדִ֣י לִ֭כְלִמָּה תֶּאֱהָב֣וּן רִ֑יק תְּבַקְשׁ֖וּ כָזָ֣ב סֶֽלָה</p>\n<p><strong>You men</strong>, how long will my glory be mocked, will you love illusions, have recourse to frauds?

So \"both low (בני אדם) and high (אישׁ בני)\" (Ps. 49:3): <strong>בני אדם (are) the multitude, אישׁ בני the great ones</strong>. So also, \"Art not thou a great man (אישׁ) and who is like to thee in Israel?\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.26.15?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">1 Sam. 26:15</a>); \"Gideon the son of Joash, the great man (אישׁ) 0f Israel\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Judges.7.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Judges 7:14</a>) (Sefaria translation).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem from this that בני אדם is generally a reference to the many whilst בני איש is attributed to those of greater stature. This idea is also supported by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.49.3?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_Zion_on_Psalms.49.3.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Zion</a> on the pasuk you bring.</p>\n\n\n",

The back of these sets is called the tyomet. If the tyomet is split (in most of the leaves) (Tur, Beit Yosef) it is invalid. If the leaves grew individually from the beginning, such that there is no tyomet, or if all double leaves are on one side and the other side has no leaves, it is invalid. RAMA: <strong>Some interpret this as meaning that if the central top leaf on top of the spine is split across the spine, it is considered a split tyomet and is invalid, and this is our practice (Trumat Hadeshen 97)</strong>. However, initially it is the preferred way to do the mitzvah to get a lulav whose top leaf is not split at all, because there are those who are stringent when even some of it is split. If that leaf is not double from the beginning of its growth, it is invalid (Kol Bo).

(If split along the) majority (it) is considered like the whole thing (and therefore the whole lulav is regarded as being invalid), and if split only partially, one doesn't need to be strict as all.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.645.20?lang=bi&with=Shulchan%20Arukh,%20Orach%20Chayim&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah Berurah 645:19</a> continues:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כי יש מחמירין וכו' - וטעמם דע\"י הנענועים רגיל להיות בסופו סדוק כולו ועיין בט\"ז דלדעתו אין להחמיר בזה רק אם נחלק כשיעור טפח ובח\"א כתב דלדעה זו יש להחמיר אפילו במשהו ועיין במה שכתבנו בסקט\"ז בשם הגר\"א וע\"כ אם יש לו לולב אחר יותר טוב לברך עליו משום מהיות טוב וגו' אבל מדינא אין לחוש לזה כלל כ\"ז שלא נחלק רובו ועיין לקמיה בס\"ז דאם נתרחקו ב' סדקיו זה מזה עד שנראה כשנים פסול</p>\n<p>There are those who are stringent - The reason is because through the waving (of the lulav) it is normal for to become completely cracked at the end. And refer to the Taz who holds one does not have to be strict in this but only if it becomes split up to the measurement of a tefach.  And in the Chayei Adam it writes that according to this opinion one should be strict even for a little bit (i.e. even less than a tefach). And refer to that which is written in se'if kattan 16 in the name of the Gra. Thus if he has another lulav it is better for him to make a blessing on it due to it being better. But as far as the actual halacha one need not worry with this since it is not split along the majority of the lulav. And see prior that if it became split - one leaf from the other until it appears like two it would be invalid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So as far as the practical halacha, it would seem the most problematic if it was split along the majority of the spine of the Lulav with the two leaves effectively forking significantly along the end.</p>\n\n\n",

But still, there was a break.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p><strong>When did it happen relatively to his reign in Sanhedrin?</strong></p>\n<p>It seems that it happened fairly in the beginning of his time in the Sanhedrin, as it's stated that one of the sages that escaped at the time was Yehoshua ben Perachiah, who was of course part of the zug that preceded Shimon ben Shetach and Rabbi Yehuda ben Tabbai (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.107b.12?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 107b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What is the incident involving Yehoshua ben Peraḥya? The Gemara relates: <strong>When King Yannai was killing the Sages, Yehoshua ben Peraḥya and Jesus, his student, went to Alexandria of Egypt</strong>. When there was peace between King Yannai and the Sages, Shimon ben Shataḥ sent a message to Yehoshua ben Peraḥya: From me, Jerusalem, the holy city, to you, Alexandria of Egypt: My sister, my husband is located among you and I sit desolate. The head of the Sages of Israel is out of the country and Jerusalem requires his return.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If Yehoshua ben Perachiah was still alive at the time, it seems that Rabbi Shimon was still fairly new in the Sanhedrin.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Is \"כל חכמי ישראל\" metaphorical or literal?</strong></p>\n<p>It's definitely metaphorical. We know this because the gemara records other sages who managed to escape Yannai's wrath. The source about Yehoshua ben Perachiah was brought above. Together with him, his student Yeshu survived. Like it or not, this Yeshu started out as a talmid chacham. Yehuda ben Tabbai also survived (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Chagigah.11a.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Chagigah 11a</a>, my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Yehuda ben Tabbai...escaped to Alexandria and the people of Jerusalem wrote to him: From me, Jerusalem, the holy city, to you, Alexandria of Egypt: My sister, my husband is located among you and I sit desolate.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Though the Yerushalmi doesn't state when this story happened, as this is the same letter that was sent to Yehoshua ben Perachiah, this happened most likely in the same time (and so writes <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%94%D7%9D_%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%9E%D7%9F\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Korman</a> in \"Sects and Cults in Judaism\", pg. 234, footnote 28, although Rabbi Aharon Heiman <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43958&st=&pgnum=382\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">disagreed</a> with this conclusion).</p>\n<p>And since we find that three of the biggest sages at the time managed to escape, it is very likely that some of the lesser-known ones managed as well (such as Yeshu, student of Yehoshua ben Perachiah).</p>\n<p>It's also possible that Choni Ha'Me'agel was already active at the time. Though Shimon ben Shetach was evidently already one of the heads of the Sanhedrin (as opposed to a \"regular\" member) when Choni prayed for rain, as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Taanit.23a.9?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">the power of excommunication was in his hands</a>, Rambam in his Introduction to the Mishna <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Rambam_Introduction_to_the_Mishnah.23.5?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mentions</a> Choni together with the group of Shimon ben Shetach and Yehuda ben Tabbai, which makes it sound like Choni was not a student of the rabbis of Shimon's generation but of those of the previous generation. Moreover, the respect he receives in that story hints to him having already been well-known, a status usually found by an older sage. Rambam also mentions <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Parah.3.5?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Elyehoeinei ben Hakof</a> in that group, so he may have already been active at that time as well.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Yehoshua ben Gamla was probably also active at the time as well. As Avraham Korman in his book \"Sects and Cults in Judaism\", pg. 233-234 and footnote 28 there, wrote (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"How did Shimon ben Shetach manage to restore the Torah to its former glory? There are hints to that in aggadot Chazal. [Footnote:] The turning of the young children away from their faith pushed Shimon ben Shetach to organize a network of schools to teach Torah from a young age. He was successful in this task thanks to assistance from the High Priest Yehoshua ben Gamla, who was also very wealthy (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Bava_Batra.21a.1-4?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Batra 21</a>). He was also mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yevamot.61a.9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yevamot (61)</a> where it is told that his wife managed to secure the role of High Priest for him, by giving a large amount of money to King Yannai. See the Rashash Bava Batra there, who says that that which is said here that Yehoshua ben Gamla established teachers of children in every city and if it were not for him, Torah would have been forgotten from Yisrael, that it is said in the Yerushalmi (the end of the eighth chapter of Ketubot) that Shimon ben Shetach was the one who did that. It seems that they helped one another until they were successful.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It should be noted that this understanding of the story of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Gamla does not line up with other sources about him and his wife, Marta bat Baitos, so some suggest that there were two Rabbi Yehoshua ben Gamla (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Tosafot_Yeshanim_on_Yevamot.61a.4?vhe=Vilna_Edition&qh=%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%A9%D7%A2%20%D7%91%D7%9F%20%D7%92%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%90\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfot Yeshanim on Yevamot 61a</a>).</p>\n<p>Lastly, Shimon ben Shetach replaced all Sadducean members of the Sanhedrin with Pharisaic sages (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillat_Taanit%2C_Tevet.1-2?vhe=Warsaw,_1874&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillat Taanit, 28th of Tevet</a>), so there were likely enough sages still alive to be able to join the Sanhedrin.</p>\n<p><strong>What did the \"restoration\" include?</strong></p>\n<p>The restoration included a number of things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>He instituted, apparently with the assistance of Rabbi Yehoshua ben Gamla, a \"mandatory education law\" (see above). This was necessary in order to weaken the Sadducean hold upon the younger generations.<sup>2</sup></p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He managed to remove the Sadducees from the Sanhedrin and return the halachic reigns to the Pharisees. This was achieved thanks to the fact that most of the nation followed the Pharisaic teachings, so even when the Sanhedrin was turned over to the Sadducees, they acted as though they were Pharisees, otherwise no one would follow them (Korman, pg. 235, footnote 34, per Josephus, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link182HCH0001\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities 18:1:4</a>). When <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Berakhot.48a.5?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">his sister got him pardoned</a> (and similarly <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Jerusalem_Talmud_Berakhot.54a.1?vhe=Mechon_Mamre_Talmud_Yerushalmi&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> too), he joined the Sanhedrin. From this position he was gradually able to prove that each of the Sadducean judges was unfit for the role of being on the Sanhedrin, which allowed him to get them fired (described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Megillat_Taanit%2C_Tevet.1-2?vhe=Warsaw,_1874&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Megillat Taanit, 28th of Tevet</a> and in aggadic fashion in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.19a.16-19b.1?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 19</a>) and return the Sanhedrin to Pharisaic hands (the day this task was completed was recorded as a day of festivities in Megillat Taanit).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>He probably had a hand in influencing Yannai's return to Pharaseeism at the end of his life (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sotah.22b.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 22b</a>), thus returning the royal family to its halachic roots.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>How did he replace all other rabbis? Did he incorporate other's sources or only his own tradition?</strong></p>\n<p>As shown above, it was not necessary to replace all of the rabbis because at least some survived the \"Pharisaic genocide\". In fact, he wasn't really \"restoring\" all of the Oral Torah. What he did was make sure it remained rooted in Am Yisrael. He was <em>restoring the status</em> of the Oral Law to its former legal and judicial glory. For the completion of this important task, he was credited in aggadic fashion as the restorer of all of the Torah. The break mentioned by Daf Shevui might refer to the knowledge preserved only by sages that <em>were</em> killed in the genocide, which was apparently lost when they were killed. That said, it seems that the vast majority of the knowledge was preserved.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Interestingly, this might partially resolve a dispute in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chagigah.16a.18-16b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 16</a> where it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"...The first members of each pair served as Nasi, and their counterparts served as deputy Nasi. GEMARA: The Sages taught: Three of the first pairs who say not to place hands and two of the last pairs who say to place hands served as Nasi, and their counterparts served as deputy Nasi; this is the statement of Rabbi Meir. And the Rabbis say the opposite: Yehuda ben Tabbai was deputy Nasi and Shimon ben Shataḥ was the Nasi.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Per the story of Yehoshua ben Perachiah, we might say that first Shimon ben Shetach replaced Nitai Ha'Arbeli as head of the court while Yehoshua ben Perachiah was still alive, and when he died, Shimon became the Nasi and Yehuda ben Tabbai became head of the court (and so appears to hint Rabbi Aharon Heiman in <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=43958&st=&pgnum=380\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"Toldot Tannaim v'Amoraim\", pg. 380</a>).</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> According to the Rashbetz (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=39932&pgnum=199\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Magen Avot, pg. 193</a>), the first Karaites came into existence during the time of Shimon ben Shetach. Korman, pg. 232 explains that since most of the nation followed Pharisaic teachings, the Sadducees, even when in power, could not teach their hashkafic views. So they taught them Tanach as Sadducees learn Tanach. Thus, the Karaites were born: People possessing the normative hashkafic views of Am Yisrael (such as belief in the Resurrection) but with the Sadducean understanding of Tanach and halacha (a literal, p'shat understanding).</p>\n\n\n",

It doesn't say, 'I lay down with my ancestors in a cave, etc.' We need to answer what Rashi's difficulty is. It is obvious that I could not interpret it as wanting to say 'When I lie down with my ancestors in a cave' as he already says 'Bury me in their burial place'. And furthermore, <strong>it seems obvious that is an expression of death, like Rashi himself brings</strong>. And we can say that Rashi's difficulty is why Yaakov changed his expression/language when he spoke to Yosef he said, \"I will lie down with my ancestors' and when he commanded his sons he said, 'I am gathered to my people'. Therefore I am able to explain that it means to lie down with my ancestors in a cave, and that it was necessary to be said afterwards, 'and bury me in their burial place', so that he would not be mistaken for being buried elsewhere in the Land of Israel. Therefore it is not able to be written afterwards, 'And carry me from Egypt and bury me in their burial place'. So, two things can be inferred from this: From the fact that it writes 'and carry me from Egypt' after this we learn that it doesn't mean 'when I lie down with my ancestors in a cave', since the going/travelling happens before the burial. Moreover, when it writes 'bury me in their burial place' it doesn't then need to write, \"When I lie down with my ancestors'. It must be that afterwards it bring another proof, since if you want to say based on the strength of the earlier question that the pasuk doesn't work, after all, he wrote \"and carry me out of Egypt and when I lie with my ancestors and bury me in their burial place', and let it be 'and bury me' means 'when I lie with my fathers', <strong>so we find in all places that 'When I lie down with my fathers' is a reference to dying. Since it writes 'And Dovid lay with his father and he was buried in the city of Dovid' and there he can not interpret that the lying is the burial because his father Yishai was buried in the city of Bethlehem which was his city and David was buried in Jerusalem [see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Kings.2.10?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I Kings 2:10]</a></strong> (my translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I believe what he is trying to say is that the way the verse is constructed can only be a reference to death as the words after would not work otherwise. It says וקברתני בקבורתם afterwards which can only happen after he had died otherwise if you understand the former as burial it would be repetitive and thus superfluous, and moreover, this is one of other examples where we see it as a reference to death as per the case by Dovid.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Sources on the Divine Documentary hypothesis\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>First, to accommodate contradicting Tannaic views, the Rabbinic tradition allows for multiple Halachic lineages stemming from Moses (see \"אלו ואלו דברי א' חיים\" regarding Hillel and Shamai). This could be regarded as \"<strong>Oral Documentary Hypothesis</strong>\" - different Halachic sources existed from Moses (originating from God) and those were merged later by rabbis in different ways into our current codex.</p>\n<p>Second, the written Torah contains uncountable contradictions, that all interpreters try to reconcile, for example (just to mention a few):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Narrative</strong>: Gen 1 describes the creation of humans following that of the animals, while Gen 2 tells the opposite story.</li>\n<li><strong>God names</strong>: different names of God in different places, the use of \"אלהים\" for different deities, did Abraham's descendants know the know YHWH before Moses, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Names</strong>: different names for the same places (Horeb/Sinai), people (Yithro/Hobab, Ketura/Hagar), etc</li>\n<li><strong>Phrasing</strong>: שמור vs זכור in the TC</li>\n<li><strong>Timing</strong>: 400/430 years of the Egyptian exile vs factual 210.</li>\n<li><strong>Hierarchy</strong>: the importance of the Levites vs Judah's dynasty, Josef vs Judah, the place of Aharon, etc.</li>\n<li><strong>Theology</strong>: there are no other gods vs there are other gods that our God destroys/fights, God is single vs God is plural (literally of course), etc</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, the interpreters square off many of those contradictions, but they remain an integral part of the text.</p>\n<p><strong>Assuming our Torah was given by God to Moses as is</strong>, do our sources consider a possibility that there were originally different heavenly sources (roots, emanations, names of God, Sefiros, whatever) that were incorporated in the final text of the Torah as we know it today?</p>\n<p>PS. please do not comment on the list as if \"there's no contradiction at all\".</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>There's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mordechai_Breuer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Mordechai Breuer</a>'s \"שיטת הבחינות\" - \"Theory of Aspects\". He first presented it in <a href=\"https://daat.ac.il/he-il/kitveyet/deot/emuna_umada_beparshanut/broyer-emuna.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this essay</a>, published in 1960.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom_Carmy\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shalom Carmy</a> in his essay \"Concepts of Scripture in Mordechai Breuer\", Jewish Concepts of Scripture, ch. 15, summarized the theory:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On the one hand, Breuer maintains that all the literary phenomena adduced by the critics to show that the Pentateuch is the product of multiple authors are compatible with divine authorship. On the other hand, he insists that unitary authorship by a human being is impossible. In each instance when the critics posit multiple authors, Breuer too discerns different voices. One task of the religious student is to grasp each of these voices in isolation, unearthing the theology, narrative vision, or legal positions implicit in each one. Finally, one also investigates the ways in which the Torah as a whole integrates and mediates these voices. No human author, in his opinion, could have orchestrated this multiplicity of voices. Thus, either the critics are right, in which case we have a jumble of\nconflicting writers spliced together, or there is a divine Author expressing a complex message by employing different voices. This, in a nutshell, is Breuer’s thesis.\" (pg. 268)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To summarize even further, Rabbi Breuer held that Hashem purposefully wrote the Torah in a contradictory manner because it reflected the multiple aspects of Hashem - Din (judgement), Chesed (grace), etc. It is this exact contradictory manner that shows the Godliness of the Torah.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Rabbi Breuer first began developing the theory because he had come to accept that much of the central points of the Documentary Hypothesis made sense. As he wrote in his first essay (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We will not complain about Spinoza who wished to prove the later dating of the Torah - from the words of the Torah itself. Indeed, <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/106285/who-wrote-deuteronomy/110693#110693\">the twelve sections that are brought in the Ibn Ezra's commentary</a>, and are copied in Spinoza's essay, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt, that this Torah - within the frame of possibilities of the laws of literature and history - was written in Eretz Yisrael many generations after the conquest. Indeed: No man could have listed the kings of Edom alongside the kings of Yisrael, or that the Canaanites were \"then\" in the land - in the era before Yehoshua...\" (6th section, 1st paragraph)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In light of the DH, and after discussing the classic harmonistic explanations for contradictions in the Torah, he writes (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But perhaps it is the opposite? Perhaps we should not decide the form and content of the Torah, but rather we will learn from the Torah [itself] what form and content it has decided for us? Perhaps we should cancel our will before His will and believe in the unity of the Torah - out of the multiplicity of its sheets? Has not the time come that we free ourselves from the weight of all mortal views, and to learn the Torah of Hashem - without any prior prejudices? Is the Torah really only straight and bringing of happiness - out of the outdated, harmonistic exegesis? Truly, can't the Torah be beautiful and graceful - even when it remains as it is?\" (11th section, 3rd paragraph)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Breuer concluded that the key to the DH is Torat Ha'Sod. As stated above, each contradiction may be solved by saying that it reflects a different aspect in Hashem's \"essence\".</p>\n<p>Stating that different names of Hashem represent different aspects of Him is, of course, nothing new, but it was Rabbi Breuer's idea to turn it into a key (not a weapon!!) to the DH. With that said, Rabbi Carmy in his own essay thought that Rabbi Breuer was inspired to reach this conclusion by a number of figures. The first two were his great-grandfather the Rashar Hirsch and his uncle, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_Breuer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dr. Yitzchak Breuer</a>. They were the proponent and \"the most creative exponent\" of neo-Orthodoxy, respectively. Dr. Breuer's views were heavily inspired by Kant and Kantian thought.</p>\n<p>The next source of inspiration was Rabbi Breuer's friend, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Amital\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yehuda Amital</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Breuer claimed that the need to assimilate biblical\ncriticism prior to combating it was first suggested to him by his colleague\nR. Yehuda Amital, whose own worldview is rooted in the mystical teaching of R. Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Palestine in the 1920s and ’30s, whose mystical thought has been enormously influential on modern Orthodoxy. The early essays explicitly cite R. Kook, especially his view that heresy is overcome not through immediate rejection but via a dialectical confrontation in which the “palace of Torah” is rebuilt so as to take over what is valid in the heretical ideas...\" (pg. 270)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Fourth, Rabbi Breuer was likely inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisker_method\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brisker method</a> of gemara study, the \"צווי דינים\" (two laws) method, which solves discrepancies within certain laws in the gemara by explaining that each POV is referring to a different aspect of the same situation.</p>\n<p>Finally, he may have been inspired by the fact that there have been several commentators over history who have used both p'shat and derash in their commentaries, without seeing any apparent contradiction in this.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Similarly, no two prophets prophesize in the same style - because saying that there is only one style of Hashem limits Him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>WADR to Rabbi/Dr. Mordechai Breur, I do not understand why someone who truly believes in <em>Torah sheBe'al Peh</em> has any motive to consider a multiple document theory.</p>\n<p>Let me explain what I mean by just looking at one example: Do slaves go free on the seventh year (Exod. 21:1-6, Deut. 15:12-18), or do they go free in the Jubilee (50th) year (Lev. 25:39-55)?</p>\n<p>Chazal, of course, note the same contradiction. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Kiddushin.7a.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Qiddushin 7a</a> (may be better known via the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Slaves.2.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam, Avadim 2:2</a>) which says that a Jewish slave is freed after six years, if they sold themselves or if court sold them (e.g. to repay a debt incurred stealing an item) and they wish to leave. If someone sold by court chooses not to, they go through an ear piecing ceremony (mentioned in the quoted portion of Shemos) and remain slaves until no later than <em>yovel</em>. And this is as the Rambam codifies it as well (Avadim ch. 3).</p>\n<p>In general, Bible Criticism is based on different assumptions about the nature of the text than Jewish Tradition does. We believe that the Torah, and Tanakh in general, describes events that were not typical. In fact, that the events themselves were as much part of how Hashem “wrote” His message to mankind as the books. We believe that the written Torah is Cliff Notes to a fuller body of wisdom, “merely” the seed to a Tree of Life planted among us, a process we were given and instructed how to work.  So, yes, Hashem orchestrated similar but different events, wanted Yaaqov to have 7 children in 12 years, tells the same story in different ways or calls the same person by different names, and presented the term limits of a Jewish slave in terms that engender halachic discourse.</p>\n<p>If someone believes that Hashem planned the Oral Torah and halachic process as part of His Intent when He composed the text, there is no question for the Bible Critic to address. That is not to dismiss the need to understand the <em>peshat</em>, the plain meaning of the verse. But there is no “why?”, we know the Author’s motivation to at times make that <em>peshat</em> less than obvious or to repeat the same idea with subtle differences — there are other layers that we can only find through those indicators.</p>\n<p>Underlying the whole exercise was the presumption that Oral Torah and halakhah are an afterthought, and not part of the original texts. Thus Chazal’s answers come across as weak apologetics, rather than reflecting the true body of the full corpus of the Torah in which the Oral and Written are a single entity. And I do not believe that traditional Shabbos observance can stand on that foundation.</p>\n<p>The Jewish community already tried that experiment. The Conservative Movement build on the Historical School, which explains halakhos using historical and sociological analysis. The idea that <em>derashos</em> themselves are not the driving force of rulings on <em>deOraisa</em> laws fit their methodology nicely. And so, no longer believing that these textual anomoloies serve the original Author's Intent, the majority of the movement's teachers and rabbis accept document hypothesis. (The tide turns just a few years after Solomon Schechter wrote \"Higher Criticism -- Higher Anti-Semitism\".) But the result was the movement's idea of Tradition and Change, and a legal process that simple is not Orthodoxy's definition of halakhah.</p>\n<p>If you believe that <em>derashos</em> are markers Hashem intentionally put in the text to guide Oral Torah, you simply have no reason to seek other explanations for them. And having those other explanations seems to inevitably weaken our belief in the authority of a halachic process built upon those <em>derashos</em>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Side-note 1: Among Bible Critics, Document Hypothesis lost the consensus as being the manner writing allegedly by multiple authors combined to become the Torah. So, I am not sure it is even the model one would want to look at. If this is news to you, you can start looking into the topic with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Documentary_hypothesis#Critical_reassessment\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia: Documentary Hypothesis (sec. Critical Reassessment)</a>.</p>\n<p>Side-note 2: The then-future-Rabbi Gil Student, some 20 years ago (10/17/2001), <a href=\"https://www.aishdas.org/toratemet/en_torah.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote on the idea</a>. He suggested that what looks like documents in the Torah are either those named in the Torah itself or the scroll after scroll that Hashem dictated to Moshe during the 40 years in the desert. Hashem then redacts them in Arvos Moav. Take a look at that essay. But, I must warn you, today's R Gil Student said he himself doesn't agree or maybe doesn't fully agree with what he posted then.</p>\n\n\n",

NRSV - if anyone is aware of a better, more Jewishy English translation, please edit it in) it says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"On the next day, as had now become necessary, Judas and his men went to take up the bodies of the fallen and to bring them back to lie with their kindred in the sepulchres of their ancestors. Then under the tunic of each one of the dead they found sacred tokens of the idols of Jamnia, which the law forbids the Jews to wear. And it became clear to all that this was the reason these men had fallen. So they all blessed the ways of the Lord, the righteous judge, who reveals the things that are hidden; and they turned to supplication, praying that the sin that had been committed might be wholly blotted out. The noble Judas exhorted the people to keep themselves free from sin, for they had seen with their own eyes what had happened as the result of the sin of those who had fallen. He also took up a collection, man by man, to the amount of two thousand drachmas of silver, and sent it to Jerusalem to provide for a sin offering. In doing this he acted very well and honorably, taking account of the resurrection. For if he were not expecting that those who had fallen would rise again, it would have been superfluous and foolish to pray for the dead.

The elders of the community shall lay their hands upon the head of the bull before the LORD, and the bull shall be slaughtered before the LORD. The anointed priest shall bring some of the blood of the bull into the Tent of Meeting, and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of it seven times before the LORD, in front of the curtain. Some of the blood he shall put on the horns of the altar which is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting, and all the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the entrance of the Tent of Meeting. He shall remove all its fat from it and turn it into smoke on the altar. He shall do with this bull just as is done with the [priest’s] bull of sin offering; he shall do the same with it. Thus the priest shall make expiation for them, and they shall be forgiven. He shall carry the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering of the congregation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Of course, Yehuda's actions are different from the halakhic procedure of the <em>ḥatat</em>. According to the Oral Torah, \"the whole community of Israel\" refers to the seventy members of the Sanhedrin, if they make a mistake in a law that the whole community follows. Nevertheless, it appears this was the biblical source through which Yehuda sought to rectify the Jews' idolatry, once it was discovered. Goldstein claims that, in contrast to the then contemporary Chashmonaim--Yehuda's descendants--who were against the idea of resurrection, the writer interpreted the act of collecting money as proof that Yehuda did indeed believe in the resurrection of the dead:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Judas and his surviving force may have believed their case to be the one en­visaged at Lev 4:13, taken literally. The rabbinic interpretation of that verse is different (see Rashi's commentary ad loc). The <em>Sifra</em> to Lev 4:13 (p. 19a Weiss) considers and rejects the interpretation that \"whole congregation\" is to be taken literally. Judas and his men, however, lived long before the rabbis. Lev 4:13 is almost echoed in vss. 40-41: the community had unknowingly been tainted with the sin of idolatry through the secret misconduct of the sol­diers, but the sin had now been exposed. If <strong>Judas and his men took Lev 4:13 to apply to their case, they found that Lev 4:14-21 required the community to bring a bull as a sin offering</strong>. Later, rabbinic law provided for a special collec­tion from the community to pay for the bull (To. <em>Sheqalim</em> 2:6; TB <em>Menahot</em> 52a; see Lieberman, <em>Tosefta Ki-fshutah</em>, Part IV [<em>Mo'ed</em>], pp. 682 - 83), similar to Judas' procedure. Two thousand silver drachmas was far too much for a bull. According to rabbinic law, the extra money would be treated as a dona­tion to the temple, and the law may have been the same in Judas' time. It is noteworthy that Jason himself, surely following his source, speaks in vs. 43 only of a singu­lar sin offering. Had the sin requiring the sacrifice been the individual sin of the possessors of idolatrous objects, there would have been an offering for each sinner.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, Jason believes that the sin offering was brought to secure ex­piation for the dead! His view disagrees with rabbinic law. There, the principle holds that sacrifices do not secure expiation for the dead. The experience of death itself is their expiation. See TB <em>Zebahim</em> 9b and \"Eyn kapparah Pmetim\" Talmudic Encyclopedia, I (5707=1946-47), 293b-294b. Again, nei­ther Jason nor Judas and his men had to agree with rabbinic law, but we have found many indications that <strong>Jason misinterpreted his source</strong>. The words he took over from the source do not fit his opinion; indeed, the words hint that <strong>Judas and his men acted in literal fulfillment of Lev 4:13-21</strong>.</p>\n<p>Jason was driven to this kind of interpretation because he firmly believed in resurrection and had to justify his own approval of Judas, a member of a fam­ily notorious for rejecting the doctrine. If Jason had had direct evidence of Judas' acceptance of the doctrine, he surely would have quoted it. Judas did win the loyalty of many pious believers in resur­rection, perhaps by avoiding any public expression of disbelief.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### ✅ Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanoch_Albeck\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Prof. Chanoch Albeck</a> in his book Mevo Lamishna (Introduction to the Mishna), ch. 2, pp. 21-22, finds support for this having been an old halacha in the gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Horayot.6a.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Horayot 6a</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Similarly, Rabbi Yosei said that it is stated with regard to those who returned to Zion from Babylonia in the days of Ezra: “The children of the captivity who came out of exile sacrificed burnt-offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, twelve goats as a sin-offering; all this was a burnt-offering unto the Lord” (Ezra 8:35). The question arises: Does it enter your mind to say: “All this was a burnt-offering”? Is it possible that a sin-offering is a burnt-offering? Rather, say: All this was like a burnt-offering. Just as a burnt-offering is not eaten, so too, this sin-offering is not eaten, as it is taught in a baraita that Rabbi Yehuda says: It was as atonement for idol worship that they brought them; and Rav Yehuda says that Shmuel says: It was atonement for the idol worship that they practiced during the days of Zedekiah.\"</p>\n<p>...The Gemara asks: But didn’t those who sinned by engaging in idol worship during the time of Zedekiah and the Babylonian exile already die? How can their descendants bring a sin-offering on their behalf? Rav Pappa said: When it is learned as a tradition that the fate of a sin-offering whose owners have died is to allow the animal to die without its being sacrificed, this matter applies specifically with regard to an individual who died but not with regard to a congregation, <strong>because there is no death with regard to a congregation; the entity of the congregation remains even when specific members die</strong>...\" (and similarly <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Temurah.15b.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Temurah 15b</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore we see that a congregation indeed needs to bring a sin-offering to atone for a communal sin, as can be seen even in the time of Ezra.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In Biblical times, did the Israelites ever wear sleeveless tunics?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Genesis 3:21, G-d clothed Adam and Eve with the <em>kuttoneth</em> (in this case, made with animal skin). Apparently, such was worn in multiple Biblical passages (e.g., Gen. 37:3; Ex. 28:39-40; 2 Sam. 13:18-19; 15:32; Job 30:18; Song 5:3). Did the Israelites ever wear them without sleeves? According to one source, the <em>kuttoneth</em> was \"a kind of shirt <strong>without sleeves</strong>, reaching down to the knees\" (<em>Cambridge Bible for Schools and College</em>, bold emphasis mine). Similarly, <a href=\"https://archive.is/20130416003356/http://new.studylight.org/enc/tje/view.cgi?n=4426&search=coat%23coat#coat\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>the Jewish Encyclopedia</em></a>, discussing the <em>kuttoneth</em> in English using the terms \"coat\" and \"shirt,\" says, \"The shirt was made at first <strong>without sleeves</strong>, and also failed to cover the left shoulder (see Müller, l.c. pp. 296 et seq.). The working classes continued to wear the 'primitive loin-cloth' (Müller, ib. p. 297), or the <strong>sleeveless coat</strong>, as this allowed full freedom of movement for both arms and legs\" (bold emphasis mine). Also the <em>Encyclopedia</em> appears to say it was the \"more luxurious classes of society— e.g., women of royal blood (2 Samuel 13:18,19 ) and men of leisure—[that] wore tunics with sleeves\" (ibid), not necessarily other classes.</p>\n<p>Are these sources accurate in saying that the <em>kuttoneth</em> was sometimes worn without sleeves? If so, then is a person not inherently guilty of <em>Ervah</em> when wearing sleeveless clothing, at least not in the Tanakh?

As can be seen, no one here has sleeves. Whilst there are some, like the Encyclopedia (which was written, by the way, way back in 1901...), that hold that this is definitive evidence that all ancient Semitic people dressed this way, there is evidence to the contrary. For example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mSFe2.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/mSFe2.jpg\" alt=\"West Asiatics in the tomb of Sobekhhotep\" /></a></p>\n<p>(from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobekhotep_(New_Kingdom_treasurer)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p>\n<p>These are identified as Levantians visiting Egypt in the 15th century BCE.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oVIHy.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/oVIHy.jpg\" alt=\"Asiatic prisoners in Horemheb's tomb\" /></a></p>\n<p>(from <a href=\"https://www.osirisnet.net/tombes/saqqara_nouvel_empire/horemheb_saqqara/e_horemheb_saqqara_01.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Osirisnet</a>)</p>\n<p>This image shows Asiatic prisoners led to Egypt. One of them definitely has sleeves. The others are at least wearing shirts (given that their navels are not depicted, as opposed to the Egyptians). This inscription is from the 14th century BCE.</p>\n<p>For some more examples, see <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/levantines-in-15th-and-14th-century-egyptian-art\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehu#/media/File:Jehu-Obelisk-cropped.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>. Whoever authored this article in the Jewish Encyclopedia would have been aware of at least some of these examples, as some are brought by Müller, though he used them to prove his theory of the gradual \"elongation\" of clothing in the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Now, although the oldest image currently known, that of Beni Hassan, does depict sleeveless clothing, this may not necessarily accurately reflect reality. As Dr. Rachel Kreiter <a href=\"https://www.thetorah.com/article/ancient-egyptian-clothing-real-and-ideal\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"it’s important to remember that Ancient Egyptian art does not employ realism as we understand it. Due to their use of the “aspective,” a focus on the most important view of a subject, Egyptian people are seen with distorted proportions that do not add up to a realistic human form. Information about what the Egyptians wore has to be extracted, carefully, from the art...It’s important to remember that these were images of non-elites and children as privileged adults wanted to see them for the purpose of expressing their own self-perceptions. This doesn’t mean such images are inaccurate per se, but does indicate care in interpretation...As for what the ancient Egyptians actually wore in this period...Egyptian men and women wore baggy tunic-like garments. Women sometimes wore detachable bodices and sleeves. Descriptions of clothing on itemized legal documents can be very general, including vague-sounding cloaks, sheets, and loincloths of thin and/or fine cloth...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that the Egyptians often exaggerated greatly their art. Foreigners, for example, might have been depicted in a certain way to emphasize their exoticness, perhaps. But just as the average Egyptians wore much more modest clothing than those that they were usually depicted with, it's quite possible that even the Semitics from the 20th century BCE wore more modest clothing than that which is depicted in the Beni Hassan tomb.</p>\n<p>And as Dr. Pnina Galpaz-Feller <a href=\"https://mikranet.cet.ac.il/pages/item.asp?item=21327&source=1358\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">wrote</a> (my translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Despite all of the attempts to recreate the coat of many stripes, it is difficult to determine with certainty what it looked like.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>One last thing to note is that Avraham and his family were not Canaanites. They were Hebrews who came from the area of Mesopotamia, an area with cooler temperatures than Canaan, thus it is more likely that they wore longer clothes than the Canaanites, and probably continued to do so during their wanderings, to preserve their Hebraic roots.</p>\n<p>I will therefore say that the conclusiveness of the sources you brought seems questionable, and in my opinion, it is more likely that the Hebrews, and later the Israelites, did in fact have sleeves (short ones at the very least, as seen worn by King Yehu).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.10b.7?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Shabbat.10b.7.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Maseches Shabbos</a>, the striped tunic (כתונת פסים) worn by Joseph had sleeves: The Talmud there says that what distinguished the coat of Joseph was two selaim worth of fine wool.

    "title": "Bar Enash a designation of an authoritative representative of another?",
    "content": "# Bar Enash a designation of an authoritative representative of another?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Daniel 7:13. In that prophetic verse, Daniel declares that he sees one like a son of (mortal) man coming with clouds to the Ancient of Days to be presented before Him.</p>\n<p>The expression ‘like a son of man’ here is Aramaic: k‘bar enash.</p>\n<p>[Now Rabbi Shlomo Aharon Wertheimer (1866-1935) writes that the root of enosh (enash) is ish, with the additional NUN to serve as a diminutive].</p>\n<p><strong>Are the words ‘bar enash’ a designation of an authoritative representative of another?</strong> I’m asking this based on the following assumptions:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Analyzing all the instances of ish in the Tenach one may conclude that\nish is primarily a designation of affiliation, not an individual (like\n“person”). Certain semantic fields will evoke this noun’s contextual\nsemantic domain of representation: ‘one who acts on behalf of others.’\nWhen the group in question is a corporate household (Israelite\nsociety’s basic unit of organization), its ish is its authoritative\nrepresentative: the ‘householder’ or paterfamilias. Hence rendering\nish in English as ‘man’ kind of distorts the text more than is usually\nrecognized.</p>\n<p>If ish is primarily a noun of group affiliation representation, then\nany expression that implies individual gender identity is misleading.\nSince Aramaic and Hebrew are closely related sister languages from the\nsame cultural base, we can be reasonably certain that the same\nsocietal assumptions are also true of Aramaic. Therefore, “son of man”\nis not a designation of an individual “person” who fulfills a divine\nrole. <strong>It is a designation of an authoritative representative of\nanother</strong>, just as a “man” is the authoritative representative of the\nhousehold. The term enash or ish is a term designating the summary of\nrelationships that result in representation of the unit. When Daniel\nuses the words bar enash (within the semantic domain of Israel), he is\nnot suggesting that he saw a divine “person”, as some claim. Instead\nhe’s claiming that, as Messiah, that person is the authorized\nrepresentative of the Ancient of Days. The concept of “person”\ndistorts this meaning, forcing one to interpret the text as if it\nincluded a Western idea of individual identity. In fact, the text\nsuggests that the son of man is presented to the Ancient of Days\nprecisely as the authoritative representative, perfectly consistent\nwith the semantic domain in Hebrew/Aramaic thought.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I don't think the assumptions in your quotation are true. \"Ish\" translates very well as \"man\". It's basic meaning is a human male, but it can sometimes be used to represent a person in charge, e.g. man of the house. A simple <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/search?q=%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A9&tab=text&tpathFilters=Tanakh&tvar=0&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria search</a> of the word Ish will show that generally it just means a regular man, just as \"Ishah\" means a regular woman.</p>\n<p>\"Bar Enash\" is just the Aramaic version of the very common Hebrew expression \"Ben Adam\", which means \"son of man\". See for example <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.5?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=he&with=Aramaic%20Targum%20to%20Psalms&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this verse</a> from Psalms with its Aramaic translation.

Considering that God is supposedly the creator of the entire world, was Moses's hesitation legitimate? Could he have failed God's mission even with all the help God was willing to offer him?</p>\n<p>I'm not speaking about \"What if Moses says no or decides to do a terrible job as a prophet.\" I'm speaking about \"What if Moses does everything he can to fulfill God's mission, but could he still fail?\"</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I would answer \"yes.\" Rambam wrote somewhere that people have free will and can decide to use it for good or for evil as they choose. Understood this way, it is possible that Moses decides not to follow G-d's mission, either because he does not believe he had a real vision or he does not think he is up to the task. On the other hand, it is possible that G-d would intervene and force him to complete the mission. Or, find someone who will.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I'm not sure what conversation you are referring but as Turk Hill said people have free will.</p>\n<p>In fact God himself confirms the possibility of a mission failing due to free will of other people.</p>\n<p>The Posuk Shmuel 1:16:2 says</p>\n<p>וַיֹּ֚אמֶר שְׁמוּאֵל֙ אֵ֣יךְ אֵלֵ֔ךְ וְשָׁמַ֥ע שָׁא֖וּל וַהֲרָגָ֑נִי\nוַיֹּ֣אמֶר יְ\nעֶגְלַ֚ת בָּקָר֙ תִּקַּ֣ח בְּיָדֶ֔ךָ וְאָ֣מַרְתָּ֔ לִזְבֹּ֥חַ לִה' בָּֽאתִי</p>\n<p>When Hashem told Shmuel to anoint a son of Yishai to become king, Shmuel asked that  Shaul Hamelech may find out beforehand and kill him.

Hashem didn't say \"If I told you to do it will happen safely\"</p>\n<p>While of course Hashem CAN do anything and Hashem COULD have said \" There is nothing to worry about because I want this done\" (see Yermaiyah 1:8)it isn't so guaranteed when you are dealing with people who have bechira. Therefore Shmuel asked about the danger.</p>\n<p>Note: Not all Meforshim understand Shmuel's question about Shaul  hearing and killing him being because he was afraid. At least one understands  that he simply  did not want to be saved by the way of a miracle. They further point out that many neveim were sent to do dangerous things and did not bring up the danger. They distinguish between the case of a Novi being told to do something <em>inherently</em> dangerous as part of the mission and the case of Shmuel where there was no inherit danger in anointing a son of Yishai as king. There was only a side danger of Shaul finding out. Being that the danger was not intrinsic to the mission Shmuel asked about it. Otherwise he would not not have.</p>\n\n\n",

The Psalmist reassures Israel that G-d's <em>kindness endures forever</em> and that it will definitely manifest itself again after the period of concealment.</p>\n<p><strong>In the next three verses, the Psalmist exhorts various groups to repeat the second part of the verse (but not the first part) because although these groups will praise G-d for specific acts of Divine <em>kindness</em> which they have witnessed, they do not always appreciate G-d's constant, unfailing goodness (which is lauded in the first section of the verse).</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, it is worth noting the Maharal on Tehillim 115:9 where he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ישראל בטח בה' - זכר ג' כתות, בית ישראל, בית אהרן, ירא ה'. פירוש, כי אלו ג' כתות, ישראל, מצד שהם בניו, הרי הם דבקים בעצם. [כי] כמו שיש דביקות [מצד] הבן אל האב, כך יש דביקות [מצד] ישראל לאביהן שבשמים. ומפני כך ראוי להם לבטוח בו יתברך, מצד הדביקות הזה. אמנם 'בית אהרן' עובדים לא מאהבה, כמו מי שהוא אוהב את אחר, כך הם בית אהרן אוהבים [את] הקדוש ברוך הוא עובדים מאהבה, וזהו הדביקות הזה מצד האהבה. ואחר כך זכר 'יראי ה' בטחו בה'', שהם עובדים השם מיראה, ומצד היראה יש להם דביקות בו יתברך. הנה ג'כתות, הא' בית ישראל דביקות עצמי, מה שהם בנים אל השם יתברך. בית אהרן אוהבים אל הקדוש ברוך הוא, ועובדים לפניו [מאהבה]. הג' יראי ה', עובדים מיראה. ועוד יתבארו אלו ג' כתות. ובמזמור 'הללו עבדי ה'' זכר גם [את] 'בית הלוי', אבל [כאן] בכל ההלל לא זכר 'בית הלוי'. והטעם, מפני כי כל הלל [לא בא אלא] על החסד והטוב שהקדוש ברוך הוא עושה עם ישראל. ומפני שהלוים דבקים במדת הדין, ולא יבא מזאת המדה החסד והטוב, לכך בכל ההלל לא נזכר כלל בית הלוי</p>\n<p>O' Israel! Trust in Hashem - This is a reminder of three groups: 1) The House of Israel, 2) The House of Aharon & 3) Those who fear Hashem. These three groups can be explained as follows: Israel - from the perspective that they are His sons and they are actually clinging to Him, because it is like the clinging of a son to his father, so too Israel cleave to their father in Heaven. Accordingly, they deserve to be blessed in Him, due to this attachment. However, 'the House of Aharon' serve not out of love. It is like\none who loves another, so too the house of Aaron love [the] Blessed One who serves out of love, and it this attachment from the perspective of love. And after that we mention \"You who fear Hashem - trust in Hashem, since they love out of fear. And from the perspective of fear they have an attachment to Hashem. Thus we have three groups; the first is the house of Israel which is a personal attachment like that of sons to Hashem. The House of Aharon who love Hashem and serve Him out love, And the third, those who fear Hashem who serve out of fear. And one can explain these three groups further. In the song, \"Servants of Hashem, give praise\" it also mentions 'the house of Levi\" whereas in Hallel it doesn't mention the house of Levi! And the reason is because all of Hallel [does not come except] for the grace and goodness that Hashem does with Israel. And because the Leviim adhere to the measure of law, the measure of grace and goodness will not come from this, and so it 'the house of Levi' is not mentioned at all in Hallel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see from the Maharal that these groups each have a different basis for serving Hashem and that is why we mention each one in turn.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In his commentary to Tehillim 115:10, Malbim explains that this progression is one of greater bitachon and higher spiritual level, which leads to greater help from Hashem:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומפרש שכל שיגדל הבטחון ומעלת הבוטח כן יגדל העזר וההגנה, עד שבית אהרן שגדול מעלתם ובטחונם מבית ישראל כן עזרם ומגנם הוא בעזר פרטי יתר על בית ישראל, וכן יראי ה׳ שגדול מעלתם מבית אהרן מצד שהם עובדים ע״י בחירתם בקדושה מופלגת יותר, יגדל עזרם ביחוד.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since they received greater help from Hashem, they must each add a level of thanks to Hashem, so the progression follows the same order. As Malbim writes in 118:2:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וביחוד יודוהו ישראל שעמהם עשה טובה פרטית יותר, ובית אהרן שהם קבלו יותר טובות פרטיות, וכן יראי ה׳, כל אחד לפי רוב הטובה שקבל התחייב בהודאה יתירה</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

When we perform mitzvos those sparks are further refined thereby strengthening that individual's form. Conversely, the opposite is true when a person chooses to not engage with Hashem's mitzvos. (Interestingly, the Ohr HaChaim explains this is the reasoning behind the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.57b.13?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Berachos 57b</a> which says sleep accounts for 1/60th of death, as when one sleeps one of these sparks leaves the body).</p>\n<p>He brings a mashal (a parable) to illustrate this idea and begins to shed light on why after the flood mankind's lifespan was reduced:</p>\n<p>There was a king who distributed gems to a number of craftsmen, requesting that they make beautiful, ornate pieces of jewellery by a certain deadline. He provided a different number of gems to each craftsman dependent on their skill and what he expected them to achieve. When they were asked to present their final work, much to the king's chagrin, most of the craftsmen had produced inferior goods, and many had actually ruined the gems in the process. In his anger he killed the craftsmen and told their children not to repeat the same mistakes. The king then issued new gems to the second generation craftsmen but only provided 1/10 the amount of gems that he had given to their forebears. The king believed that by making the task less onerous it would result in a better end product. Thus, the gemstones are like the souls that Hashem distributes, and the condition of the soul improves proportionally to the performance of mitzvos and abstention from sins by the personality it inhabits.</p>\n<p>As a result:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולראשונים התחיל ה' להרבות להם המלאכה ונתן להם נשמות גדולות שבכל אחת יש בה חלקים רבים, והגביל לכל חלק מלאכתו יום א'. והוא סוד (שמות ט\"ז ד') דבר יום ביומו כי הענף יקרא יום ונתן להם ימים רבים כנגד חלקים אשר בנפשותם, לאדם נתן יותר משלש מאות אלף חלקים שהם מספר ימיו תתק\"ל וכשיעור זה הן חסר הן יתר לדורות ההמה, <strong>וכשקלקלו ופרץ ה' בהם פרץ ואת בניהם הקים תחתם נח ובניו משם והלאה הקיל ה' מתת רוב הטורח ההוא כדי שתהיה הפקידה קרובה ויתחלחלו האנשים מעת הפקידה, וכשראה כי לא יכלו לעמוד היה מחסר והולך להקל, והן היום בעונותינו ימי שנותינו בהם ע' שנה שהם בקירוב חמשה ועשרים אלף יום ורבים מבני עמינו לא עמדו בעבודה קלה כזו</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the earlier generations were set a much weightier tasks which required a lot more 'sparks' to help them achieve their spiritual goals. However, after the failings of the generation of Noach, Hashem had to provide less days i.e. lessen the human lifespan, in order to help us achieve what is expected of us, resulting in a downgrading of lifespan averaging 70 years.</p>\n\n\n",

He has already finishing grad school (mid-20s).</p>\n<p>He has some knowledge of the basics of observant life and is really pushing to figure out how to take on more. Wants a place that's really academically-oriented and where he will gain basic textual knowledge and skills. I'd appreciate any ideas or suggestions (Google basically just showed me two options but I'm sure there are more).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 11)\n\n<p>So there are a number of options in Israel - I will try and provide a bit of background for each one. Just an aside, please note there is no such a thing as a bad yeshiva, it is always about finding the right fit for the right person.</p>\n<p>As has been mentioned, the two most 'famous' ones are Aish and Ohr Sameach.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://ohr.edu/7414\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshivas Ohr Sameach</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Founded in 1972 and situated in a beautiful complex in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ma%27alot_Dafna\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Maalot Dafna</a>. The Yeshiva has over 400 full-time students and hundreds more participating in short-term programs. They have a phenomenal set of Rebbeim that are all noted speakers and warm personalities. The faculty includes <a href=\"https://www.jle.org.uk/showperson.php?id=322\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Breitowitz</a>, rav of the kehilla, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nota_Schiller\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Nota Schiller</a> - rosh yeshiva, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovid_Gottlieb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb</a>, a former professor of analytical philosophy at Johns Hopkins University and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dovid_Kaplan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dovid Kaplan</a>, author of The Kiruv Files and the Impact! series. Perhaps two major pros of Yeshivas Ohr Sameach is the fact that they have a range of programmes depending on where the individual is holding from beginner courses through to Rabbinic teacher training, so the bochur in question can therefore choose the programme that best suits where he is up to and go on from there. Additionally, like Aish, Ohr Sameach is an international institution and has many programmes abroad which ensures that any returning bochur can still maintain links afterwards.</p>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aish_HaTorah\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish HaTorah</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Aish was founded in 1974 by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah_Weinberg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Noach Weinberg zt\"l</a> and is situated overlooking the Kosel. The current Rosh Yeshiva is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitzchak_Berkovits\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yitzchak Berkovits shlita</a> who is regarded as a leading posek and one of the first ports of call when it comes to Baalei Teshuva related shailos. Like Ohr Sameach, there are a number of <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/jw/s/Think-about-Taking-a-Gap-Year-In-Israel.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">educational programmes</a> available including the famous Foundations Programme which doesn’t expect any background knowledge, just a desire to learn and is thus personalised accordingly. This runs for three months. Following this, there is the Beit Midrash Program which helps to foster skills in learning Gemara as well as providing answers to a plethora of questions thereby providing them with a firm foundation for life after yeshiva. Finally, there is the <a href=\"http://aishgesher.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish Gesher</a> programme  which is for those graduating high school (so possibly not relevant to your friend) with  diverse backgrounds. The program offers the chance to spend a year living in the Old City of Jerusalem, studying Jewish texts at a serious level.</p>\n<hr />\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><a href=\"https://darchenoam.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yeshivas Darchei Noam / Shapells</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Based in Yerushalayim and led by <a href=\"https://torah.org/rabbi-shaya-karlinsky/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Shaya Karlinsky</a> and <a href=\"http://shapellsjerusalem.com/wp-content/uploads/RH-Newsletter-5778.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Dovid Schoonmaker</a>, the Yeshiva caters for university-educated and professional men committed to spiritual and personal growth.

Whether their backgrounds were in business, law, medicine, or the arts, the only criteria was that they wanted to learn. Like Rabbi Rosenberg did himself, these students would learn to balance a life of Torah with a life of family and work. They would learn that true greatness must be realized in every facet of life. Those initial students went on to lead extraordinary lives, proving that a small, focused program could generate large waves in the Jewish world.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following Rabbi Rosenberg's passing in 1999, the yeshiva was placed under the direction of his sons-in-law, Rabbi Beryl Gershenfeld and Rabbi Pinchas Auerbach. Its tradition draws from the Slabodka mussar approach, emphasising that success can be achieved only when a person can realise his inner greatness.</p>\n<p>Their website reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Machon Shlomo offers both a one and two-year program for highly motivated students with little or no formal Jewish educational background interested in spiritual, intellectual, and ethical growth.  Successful building requires a deeply rooted foundation.  Building a foundation for life is no exception.  For almost 40 years, Machon Shlomo has been providing that foundation by exploring the richness of classical Jewish texts in philosophy, law, and ethics, and their interface with modern day reality.

Even leviathan the slant serpent and leviathan the tortuous serpent He created male and female. And if they would have coupled and produced offspring, they would have destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and killed the female, and salted the female to preserve it for the banquet for the righteous in the future. As it is stated: “And He will slay the serpent that is in the sea” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.27.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 27:1</a>).</p>\n<p>וְאַף בְּהֵמוֹת בְּהַרְרֵי אֶלֶף זָכָר וּנְקֵבָה בְּרָאָם וְאִלְמָלֵי נִזְקָקִין זֶה לָזֶה מַחֲרִיבִין כָּל הָעוֹלָם כּוּלּוֹ מָה עָשָׂה הַקָּדוֹשׁ בָּרוּךְ הוּא סֵירַס הַזָּכָר וְצִינֵּן הַנְּקֵבָה וּשְׁמָרָהּ לַצַּדִּיקִים לֶעָתִיד לָבֹא שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר הִנֵּה נָא כֹחוֹ בְמׇתְנָיו זֶה זָכָר וְאוֹנוֹ בִּשְׁרִירֵי בִטְנוֹ זוֹ נְקֵבָה</p>\n<p>And He created even the beasts on the thousand hills (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.50.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalms 50:10</a>) male and female. And they were so enormous that if they would have coupled and produced offspring, they would have destroyed the entire world. What did the Holy One, Blessed be He, do? He castrated the male and cooled the sexual desire of the female and preserved it for the righteous in the future. As it is stated about the beasts: “Lo now, his strength is in his loins” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.40.16?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Job 40:16</a>); this is referring to the male. The continuation of the verse: “And his force is in the stays of his body”; this is the female, alluding to the idea that they did not use their genitals for the purpose of procreation.\n(Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We know Hashem is perfect and does not make mistakes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הָאֵל֮ תָּמִ֢ים דַּ֫רְכּ֥וֹ אִמְרַֽת־יְהֹוָ֥ה צְרוּפָ֑ה</p>\n<p>The way of G-d is perfect; the word of the LORD is pure (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.18.31?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 18:31</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And as <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Radak_on_Psalms.18.31.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Radak</a> asserts there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>האל תמים דרכו הוא אלי שהיכלת בידו <strong>ומה שעושה עושה בתמימות וביושר</strong>, ומשלם לאיש כמעשהו והשיב לי כצדקתי ולאיבי כרשעתם</p>\n<p>The way of G-d is perfect - He is my G-d who has the power in his hand, <strong>and what he does is done in perfection and uprightness/honesty</strong>, and He pays to man according to his actions, and He restores me according to my righteousness and to my enemies according to their evil.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate that the female levyason will be used in the future, and that we recite upon leaving the Succah \"שנזכה לישב בסוכה של לויתן\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.667.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">SA OC 667:1</a>), and likewise with the Behemoth \"וּשְׁמָרָהּ לַצַּדִּיקִים לֶעָתִיד לָבֹא\" - \"He kept it for the righteous in the future\", but <strong>why make two at the beginning if Hashem knew that He would have to destroy this coupling?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>I had the same question as I was reading רש״י this week.

We see this also with the creation of light itself, which Hashem stored for the righteous in the future (רש״י בראשית א:ד ד״ה וירא אלקים את האור כי טוב ויבדל).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Hashem created both the male and female Leviathan with the ultimate potential to destroy the world. Hashem took something with the Ultimate potential for Negativity and Destruction and used it for the purpose of the Ultimate Good. It's possible that we are meant to replicate that. (The מצוה of והלכת בדרכיו).

The lesson of the Leviathan's partner is that no matter a person's accomplishments, \"it is not good\" for him to be alone. Even a great man needs a partner to assist in their service of Hashem, if only to serve as an example to the public.</p>\n<p>See the rest of the Sicha for further elaboration of how Chassidus understands the symbolism of the male Leviathan and the female partner, as well as the meaning of \"killing\" and \"salting\" and \"eating\" it, and why it has to be in that order.</p>\n\n\n",

The process is described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The test kit is a hand-held device with an absorbent pad at one end and a reading window at the other. Inside the device is a strip of test paper that changes colour in the presence of COVID-19 proteins (antigens).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I am aware of this question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/8338/may-a-lady-take-a-pregnancy-test-on-shabbos\">here</a> about the pregnancy test.</p>\n<p>There in @jake's answer he draws a parallel to diabetic test sticks. He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One issue with taking such a test is tzovaya, as usually the test involves chemicals in the stick changing colors by reacting to the urine. R' Ribiat, in 39 Melachos, with regard to clinical test sticks used by diabetics to determine urine-sugar level, cites Sh'miras Shabbos K'Hilchasa (33:20), who is unsure about this (see footnotes 81-83 there), and recommends that one not urinate directly onto the stick, but rather such that the urine comes by way of g'rama onto the stick.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now I appreciate this is not exactly the same scenario and equally, given the small area in which one drops the solution, it would be quite hard to do it indirectly.</p>\n<p>So therefore:</p>\n<p>Is it a definitive that this is simply not allowed due to tzoveya, or due to the pandemic is there a difference as unlike the case of pregnancy and diabetes one needs to be mindful of potentially infecting others and there is more halachic leniency? Should one proceed with some form of shinui, or in such a scenario is it advised to ask a goy to do the test for you?</p>\n\n\n",

It’s in Aramaic. I often hear that these words would be a translation for the Hebrew k’ben Adam. But because Aramaic and Hebrew are often very similar I was wondering if these words aren’t or couldn’t be a translation of k’ben enosh (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.144.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Psalm 144:3</a> uses the words ben enosh).</p>\n<p>In my own words: This one like a human, just like the beasts, seem to represent something other  than what they appear to be. Daniel didn’t understood what he saw and he asked the messenger (angel) in his dream to explain the meaning to him. As the beasts represent empires, it seems that the one like a human also represents an empire, nation, a people - the Jewish people. It seems that the messenger is telling Daniel that the Jews will live under four kingdoms (periods of reign) who will rule over them, but eventually the Jews will inherit the kingdom.</p>\n<p>Now Rashi opines that k’bar enash is the Messiah (it could refer to the Messianic era that will come after the four periods of reign?).</p>\n<p>So who or what is referred to with the words ‘like a human’?</p>\n<p>Now what I would like to know is what the contrast between those like beasts and the one like a human implies/means.</p>\n<p>So:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What’s the right translation of the Aramaic words k’bar enash in Hebrew.</li>\n<li>To what or who(m) are these words referring to.</li>\n<li>Why the the ‘beasts v.s. human being’ images to contrast/differentiate between these.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>So interestingly as a starting point, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ibn_Yahya_ben_Solomon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yosef Ibn Yahya</a> who translates the Aramaic in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.7.13?lang=bi&p2=Joseph_ibn_Yahya_on_Daniel.7.13.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">commentary</a> into Hebrew, writes it as כבן אדם - 'like a son of man' so there is definitely scope to do so.</p>\n<p>As far as the exact wording of Enosh vs Adam, it is worth noting parenthetically that the two terms have specific meanings and therefore the usage is relevant and appropriate based on their definition.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>As a result, the reference of כְּבַ֥ר אֱנָ֖שׁ based on the Malbim (as brought in the footnote below) could well be specifically used to show how Moshiach (as per Rashi's commentary) will ascend from mankind and to help lead the Jews above the pagan nations and this is the reason for the juxtaposition with 'beasts'.</p>\n<p>When looking at <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Daniel.7.12?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Daniel.7.12&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> in the preceding verse that bring the reference to 'beasts' he writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ושאר חיותא העדיו שלטנהון. ולשאר המלכיות הסירו מן השמים ממשלתהון:</p>\n<p>But as for the other beasts, their dominion was removed And from the other kingdoms, their dominion was removed by Heaven.</p>\n<p>וארכה בחיין יהיבת להון. וזמן נתן להם בחיים עד יום מועד לעתיד לבא מלחמות גוג ומגוג:</p>\n<p>and they were given an extension of life And He gave them time to live until a set day in the future, the wars of Gog and Magog.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So to answer in summary:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>It makes sense to translate in Hebrew as 'k'ben adam' as the whole reference is someone that specifically comes from mankind. And the 'enosh' usage is to show how it comes from man despite our flaws and limits.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>This person will rise to become Moshiach like Rashi references</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And this fits with the juxtaposition of 'beasts' to show how he will rise whilst the other pagan nations will fall away when their time comes.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> In Tehillim (psalms) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:5</a> it uses both terms:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מָה־<strong>אֱנ֥וֹשׁ</strong> כִּֽי־תִזְכְּרֶ֑נּוּ <strong>וּבֶן־אָ֝דָ֗ם</strong> כִּ֣י תִפְקְדֶֽנּוּ׃</p>\n<p>What is man that You have been mindful of him, mortal man that You have taken note of him (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is worth noting that Malbim gives a clear definition in both instances. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.5?lang=bi&p2=Malbim_Beur_Hamilot_on_Psalms.8.5.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Malbim Biur Hamilos</a> notes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אנוש, בן אדם. האנוש מורה על חולשתו מצד עצמו ובן אדם מציין חולשתו מצד מינו שאינו מתקיים זמן רב (ישעיה נ''א י''ב)</p>\n<p>Man...son of man - The term 'Enosh' teaches us about the inherent weakness of man (lit. on his own), and 'Ben Adam' indicates his weakness on the part of his kind which does not last long (refer to <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.51.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 51:12</a> which also uses both terms).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the term Enosh denotes that mankind is essentially flawed, with limitation imposed upon their nature. Unlike Hashem Who is described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.2?lang=bi&with=Torah%20Temimah&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:2</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.8.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">8:10</a> as being \"מָה־אַדִּ֥יר\", mighty, here the verse is exposing how confined man is by being a lowly human in comparison. Conversely, the term Ben Adam is more a reference to the mortality of mankind - how every human has a designated time period on this earth.</p>\n\n\n",

The Mishna in shabbos 12:5 writes that writing on sand(see Bartanura who explains that is what avak derachim is)would be patur from the issur of writing on shabbos. It seems from these sources that sand would not be a valid means of writing a get.</p>\n<p>Text from Taz 125:1 :שרישומו ניכר פירוש הרושם מתקיים וניכר תמיד לאפוקי מדבר שאינו מתקיים כמו משקין ומי פירות</p>\n<p>See also the the Bach on the Tur siman 125 which discusses a possible difference between the the Tur and the Rambam whether one needs just to recognize the letters  or that it needs to be permanent as well.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The first thing that needs to be clarified is ON what was it written. I'm assuming you are talking about a scenario where the sand is carved out of sand sitting in a box, not a case of using sand to write letters on a klaf.</p>\n<p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.124.2?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rama 124:2</a> it should be written ON something that has lasting power;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וי\"א דוקא בדבר שהוא של קיימא אבל אם כתב בעלה של בצלים או ירקות וכדומה לזה פסול (הר\"ן פ\"ב)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Writing on (or in) sand, is debatable if it can be considered lasting.</p>\n<p>Another point to consider is how the letters are formed. If they carved out (as my assumption) then perhaps it would be good, however if they are embossed it would be problematic. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Even_HaEzer.125.4?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 125:4</a> mentions this</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>חקק גט על הלוח או על האבן או על טס של מתכת אם חפר יריכי האותיות כשר וכן אם חקק יריכי האותיות מאחורי הטס עד שבלטו בפני הטס אבל אם חפר תוך האות עד שיראו היריכות גבוהות מכאן ומכאן או שהכה על פני הטס בחותם עד שנמצאו האותיות בולטות כדרך שעושין דינר זהב אינו גט: הגה י\"א דלכתחילה יש להחמיר שלא לכתוב בקולמוס של ברזל שלא לבא לידי חקיקה (סדר גיטין) וע\"ל סי' זה סעיף כ\"ב ולא מקרי חק תוכות אלא כשכל האות נעשה כך אבל אם צריך עדיין לתקן שיהיה אות כשר (ת\"ה סי' רכ\"ח)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, there is the main issue of writing with something that is not long lasting. The cases that are used as examples in Shulchan Aruch and elsewhere, are about fruit juices and the like, things that will fade on their own over time. Sand, if left alone will remain as is. However, since it can be easily erased, there will have to be witnesses at the time of giving that will attest to what was written. Yet, we can perhaps learn from Hilchos Shabbos where the poskim include sand as the same as fruit juice</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.340.4?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shulchan Aruch 340:4</a> says that one should not write in fruit juices or ashes, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.340.20?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna Berura 340:20</a> mentions that the same issur would apply to sand. So, for Shabbos, writing in sand would be assur M'drabbanan, just like fruit juices.</p>\n<p>There might be another point to consider from Hilchos Shabbos, that since it is only assur M'drabbanan it is not good enough for a Get;</p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gittin.19a.11?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gittin 19A</a> says in the name of R' Yochanon;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>א\"ל והלא לימדתנו רבינו כתב עליון כתב לענין שבת א\"ל וכי מפני שאנו מדמין נעשה מעשה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi there explains that even on Shabbos, such a writing would not bring a Korban. Seemingly, a ksav that is only assur M'drabbanan on Shabbos is not good enough for a Get.</p>\n\n\n",

Please share the make and model of halachically-compliant warmers.</p>\n<p>I ask because, regarding the warming trays on the market, there is ambiguity about the purpose of these trays. If they are used on Friday night to keep food warm, it doesn't matter how hot they get if they were put on the tray before Shabbos began, while if they are used on Saturday to warm up cold food, the above restrictions may apply. For example, I have seen warming trays advertised for use on Shabbos for which the reviews say they get the food extremely hot, suggesting they are not suitable for Saturday use.</p>\n\n\n",

Even the parable says that the poor man \"treated it like a daughter\", not a wife. So the poor man would definitely prefer having four fine goats over his lousy ewe. This can not be said about a beloved wife (unless it's Job's sons, which God thinks can be replaced).</li>\n<li>David's sin is clearly adultery, not even coveting (he did not beg Uriah to divorce her), but the parable speaks about theft. That's not even in the same category.</li>\n<li>in the parable, the rich man had no feelings for the lamb and only used it to spare his own, which I can't think to attribute to David, as if he slept with another man's wife to spare himself sleeping with Michal (or other women).

THe Gemmorah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shabbat.56a.6?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat.56a</a>) suggests that David didn't sin:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"As Rabbi Shmuel bar Naḥmani said that Rabbi Yonatan said: Anyone who goes to a war waged by the royal house of David writes a [conditional] bill of divorce to his wife.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For all those who suggest that Bat Shevah was free to have relations with David, why didn't he marry her openly and publicly right away?</p>\n<hr />\n<p>For those who suggested that \"it would not look nice in the eyes of people\", I remind the speech that Samuel gave before people (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/I_Samuel.8.16?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">I_Samuel.8</a>) where he explicitly warned them of the king's unlimited rights.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam seems to be the one who holds that a full, non-conditional, divorce was given before going out to war. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Ketubot.9b.1.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfos in Kesubos 9B</a> explains that even so it was done in secret so that people would not marry them in the meantime and then they would be unable to marry again when they return.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וניחא לפירוש זה הא דאמרינן בפרק הזהב (ב\"מ נט. ושם) נוח לו לאדם שיבעול ספק אשת איש ואל ילבין פני חבירו ברבים ומפיק ליה מהאי מעשה דבת שבע דספק אשת איש הואי דדלמא יחזור מן המלחמה ור\"ת מפרש כותב גט כריתות לגמרי בלא שום תנאי ולפי' קשה אמאי קרי לה ספק אשת איש הא הואי גרושה גמורה ואר\"ת דקרי לה ספק אשת איש לפי שהיו מגרשין בצינעא שלא יהא נודע ויקפצו עליהם בני אדם לקדשם ולפי' הקונטרס קשה קצת איך בא עליה למה לא היה ירא שמא יחזור:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbeinu Tam has a different approach to the divorce that was written by King David’s soldiers. Rabbeinu Tam explains that when the Gemara says: he writes a divorce for his wife, it means unconditionally, without any stipulation. Eventually, those soldiers that did return would remarry their wives.\nAccording to [Rabbeinu Tam’s] explanation we have the following difficulty: Why is [the wife] called a married woman whose status is dubious, she is absolutely divorced? There is no question about her status according to Rabbeinu Tam.\nSays Rabbeinu Tam: That she is called a dubious married woman because they used to divorce secretly, so that it should not be known that they were divorced, for people would be anxious to marry them if they would have divorced publicly. Since it was not well-known that they were divorced, the Gemara refers to them as married women whose status is dubious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, if Dovid would have married her publicly, all of his soldiers would be reluctant to give a divorce in a future war, since it would become public knowledge and people would start marrying their wives and they would be unable to remarry after the war.</p>\n\n\n",

If so, please recommend!</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>It should go without saying that this question varies greatly for each couple, so I will give some general considerations before my suggestions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take care to select works accessible to your study partner's level of training with Jewish texts.</li>\n<li>As with most aspects of relationships, early and clear communication will clear up problems as they arise.</li>\n<li>Think about what you would each like to get out of the experience: Are you trying to convey the beauty of delving into an esoteric gemara, brush up on your knowledge of Jewish history, come away with moral teachings, etc.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>With that being said, the following works have been enjoyable for my wife and me:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tomer Devorah (M. Cordovero). A work that encourages us to think about our relationships with others and our relationship with Hashem</li>\n<li>The Sabbath (A.J. Heschel). Uses poetry to foster a love for the unique beauty of Shabbat</li>\n<li>Nineteen Letters (S.R. Hirsch). Brings many of the complexities of reconciling Torah Judaism with modern Enlightenment, and in a powerful, elegant tour de force</li>\n<li>Shaar Ha'Bitachon. A foundational work concerning a Jew's everyday faith in Hashem.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Happy reading!</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As has been mentioned, every couple is different so it does require a bit of thought based on where you are both holding.</p>\n<p>Secondly, it is worth remembering that your wife is not your yeshiva chavrusa(!). The story is told about a newlywed couple who decided to learn chumash and Rashi together. It was not long before they got into the swing of things, and his wife who suggested a p'shat had it quickly dismissed by the husband who was used to the milchemta shel Torah of yeshiva life and arguing out points with his chavrusa. When the husband noticed his wife had gone quiet, he looked up to see her crying. Needless to say, one has to remember that one's wife is one's ezer kenegdo and should be treated with sensitivity and respect.</p>\n<p>I found it helpful to learn things that are relevant to both one's life, so sefarim on inyanei chinuch is definitely a good one. My wife and I particularly enjoyed Rav Wolbe's <em>Zeriyah Ubinyan b'Chinuch</em>. It comes in both <a href=\"https://www.sefer.org.il/Product/48832/%D7%96%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9F-%D7%91%D7%97%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%9A---%D7%94%D7%A8%D7%91-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%91%D7%94\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew</a> and <a href=\"https://www.shopeichlers.com/products/planting-building-raising-a-jewish-child/4378\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English</a></p>\n<p>Another option is to work on something that is Mussar based. As growing Jews we all need help on  the self-improvement front. I recommend <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Orchot_Tzadikim\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefer Orchos Tzaddikim</a> also available in both <a href=\"https://www.lehmanns.co.uk/arhvt-cdiqim-em-hervt-vcivnim-mpel-tvrt-hmvsr.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwzOqKBhAWEiwArQGwaFkrqrLAuvEJdObIZo8OmrYhn8Tk2tdhYAYn1nmtxuc7QPjk0PLgihoC2AAQAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hebrew</a> and <a href=\"https://www.lehmanns.co.uk/the-ways-of-the-tzaddikim-orchos-tzaddikim-pocket-edition-1-volume.html?gclid=CjwKCAjwzOqKBhAWEiwArQGwaDvLSWAIqe3MohEuCUJAcTeBTlTYiP53Z2i1QQuv3S4IgFmsh-rHthoCh-8QAvD_BwE\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">English</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, something on Jewish philosophy / machshava is also quite nice to learn together. I have learnt with my wife Michtav M'Eliyahu and Alei Shur which is also very nice as it looks at all areas of Jewish life.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Hilchos Nidda (esp. harchakot) is a good idea.</p>\n\n\n",

We can't see him or sense him or really know what it means for G-d to be our king, but we know about human kings and that helps us appreciate what he does for us in that aspect. We can't really grasp what it would mean for G-d to be a husband and Israel his wife, so to speak, but Shir Hashirim (Song of Songs) brings that concept to us, by using the analogy of a woman and her beloved. So too for master and slave, judge and defendant, rich man and beggar, and even <em>neighbor</em> (שכן) - that G-d desires, so to speak [I'm going to run out of כביולs], to dwell among us (his שכינה).<br />\nSo too for every relationship between human beings. Father and child is one of those and we see in it one of the many ways that G-d deals with us and cares for us.<br />\n[I heard this idea from R' Chaim Mintz shlit\"a.]</p>\n\n\n",

Sometimes this is only in regards to a specific tefillah. For example:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>In some of the Polish chassidic courts (i.e. Gur) an emphasis is put on davening fast. A known Mashal is told as explanation - when traveling through a dark forest at night one travels as fast as possible so that robbers don't have an easy time attacking. The Nimshal - Daven fast and you will be able to focus/have kavannah on the words without having unrelated thoughts to davening.</li>\n<li>Mincha on Shabbes and especially on Yom Kippur many chassidic courts daven fast as Mincha is a time of Din.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Are there any written sources  for this minhag?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>This is probably a side effect to Ashkenazim having the custom of the Shaliach Tzibbur (the communal reader) not reading all the prayers out loud. People tend to read faster in their heads than when they are reciting out loud, so having so many prayers read \"silently\" by the prayer leader and the congregation would make the prayers go faster. From there I think it would kind of become a loop in which speed becomes an integral part of the loop.</p>\n<p>Contrast this to Yemenites and Sepharadim who read many more of the prayers out loud. Sure someone could try reading them faster, but their speed will  always be limited by the fact it takes longer to say something than to read something.</p>\n\n\n",

Now my question is what qualifies as cheese, or what is the halachic definition of cheese. For it cannot be that something is prohibited simply because the Gentiles call it \"cheese\", e.g. a type of chocolate called 'cheese' because it tastes a bit like cheese while being entirely kosher. There has to be assumed a genus of 'cheese' which is common to kosher as well as non-kosher cheese. So what is the definition of this common genus called 'cheese'?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Chalav becomes Gevinah when the kosher milk is \"curdled\" or thickened, as stated in [Iyov 10:10].</p>\n<blockquote>\n\"Did You not pour me like milk and curdle me like cheese?\" (הֲלֹ֣א כֶֽ֖חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑נִי וְ֜כַגְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽנִי)</blockquote>\n<p>“Hard” cheese is made by souring (fermenting) the milk to impart the desired flavor and then curdling the casein fraction of the milk. This curd forms a matrix, which entraps whey and fat to form cheese. Historically, milk was curdled by using an enzyme called rennin, which is a protease (an enzyme which affects protein) derived from the stomach of a suckling calf. In the times of חז“ל this enzyme came either from the flesh of the stomach itself (עור הקיבה) or from the milk found in the calf’s stomach (קיבה).</p>\n<p><strong>Cheeses which use rennet as the primary coagulant (e.g. Cheddar, Muenster, Mozzarella) are called rennet set cheeses and are subject to the laws of גבינת עכו“ם. This גזירה applies equally both to cheeses made with microbial rennet as well as to those using animal rennet. In addition to conventional Kosher ingredient concerns, the גזירה of גבינת עכו“ם requires that a Mashgiach be present during the production and, according to many שיטות, he must add the rennet to each vat. The only exception to this requirement is where a Jew owns the milk, in which case only the ingredients are of consequence.</strong></p>\n<p>[https://oukosher.org/blog/consumer-kosher/dairy-primer/]</p>\n\n\n",

If one were to not make the bracha, is the mitzvah valid bedi’eved or does the fact that the bracha wasn’t made means the mitzvah wasn’t done?</p>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<p>If you put on a tallis but didn’t made the bracha, does it count as wearing a tallis?</p>\n<p>If you washed before bread but didn’t make an Al Netilas Yadayim, does it count as washing?</p>\n<p>If you searched for chametz in the correct time but didn’t make the Bracha, does it count as a valid bedika?</p>\n<p>I think the point is clear after all those examples 😁</p>\n<p>Ps: these halachos (<a href=\"https://outorah.org/p/32929/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://outorah.org/p/32929/</a>) seem to say the rule about whether you can <em>still</em> make the Bracha, but it doesn’t say whether or not you were mikayim the mitzvah after the fact.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The beracha is not me'akev the mitzavah. In fact, when there's a doubt about when you're required to do a mitzvah d'oraita the halacha is to do the mitzvah, but not make the beracha. (Because if you aren't required to do the mitzvah, making the beracha is a beracha levatellah, which is itself an issur d'oraita.)</p>\n<p>Sefirat HaOmer is a great example. There's a machloket rishonim whether the whole 49-day period is one mitzvah, or whether each night is its own separate mitzvah. If you miss a day, then for the rest of the Omer you'd only be chayav according to the rishonim who say that each night is its own separate mitzvah. So we're machmir for those rishonim, and require you to keep counting, but because maybe the other rishonim are correct, we don't make the beracha.</p>\n<p>There's another example to answer your question in the halachot of the Omer. What if you casually mentioned \"It's Lag Baomer\" to a friend before having a chance to count the Omer on the 33rd night? You may have just been yotzae the mitzvah, so now you can't count with a beracha anymore that night. (But you can continue to do so on subsequent nights.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>There are many cases where the rule “Brachos Einon Meakvos” is brought.</p>\n<p>One that comes to mind from the recent Yom Tov of Sukkos is the Biur Halacha 649:1 in regards to an esrog that was used after being stolen with yiush;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומיהו לא יברך - ואם עבר ונטלו א\"צ ליטול שוב לולב אחר וכ\"ש שלא יברך עליו דכיון דמדינא יצא בנטילה ראשונה שוב הוי ברכה לבטלה [בכורי יעקב</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Even though a bracha cannot be said, he is yotzei the mitzvah</p>\n\n\n",

However, G-d saw that humans desired meat, and so He \"allowed\" Noah to consume meat, but under the conditions of the seven laws and later for Jews under the conditions of kosher foods.

Because in the case of Avraham he literally had two sons. And to refer to one’s soul as one’s only seems rather strange. People who are separated (alone), set apart (Yitzchak?), only offspring/sole heir, self (soul) etc. are all terms to translate and understand verses. So how would one define the common denominator in this case?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>On a very basic p'shat level, whilst Avraham did indeed have two sons - they were both 'only' sons, one from Sarah and one from Hagar, and so the term yechidcha would work in this context.</p>\n<p>Alternatively according to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ramban_on_Genesis.22.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ramban</a></strong> it was more to do with the sense of legacy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>קח נא את בנך את יחידך <strong>בעבור היותו בן הגבירה והוא לבדו אשר יקרא לו זרע קראו יחידו</strong> ובא הלשון להגדיל המצוה אמר קח נא את בנך היחיד האהוב יצחק והעלהו עולה לפני</p>\n<p>TAKE NOW THY SON, THINE ONLY SON. <strong>Since Isaac was the son of the mistress and he alone was to be the one to carry his name, He called him Abraham’s only son.</strong> The description was for the purpose of magnifying the command, thus saying: “Take now thy only son, the beloved one, Isaac, and bring him up before Me as a burnt-offering.” (Sefaria translation my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So as a starting point, Yitzchak was the son who would continue Avraham's legacy and inheritance and that is why he is referenced as 'Yechidcha' despite Avraham also having the son Yishmael.</p>\n<p>The <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.22.2.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim</a></strong> provides another explanation that as you suggest, based on the verses in Tehillim, that it is an expression of love that comes from the soul. He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכנגד בכל נפשך אמר את יחידך וכיון שאין לו אלא הוא הוא הנפש כי מי שאין לו בנים חשוב כמת</p>\n<p>Concerning love with one's soul, the Torah mentions יחידך; when a person has no children he is alone and considered as dead. Love with one's soul is therefore love with the only thing one has left to love with.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So here according to the Ohr HaChaim, the word 'yechidcha' is an expression that alludes to the fact that Avraham loved Yitzchak with all his soul and to part with him, would leave him alone and bereft of his son.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In this particular case, you are dealing with the precise language of the Akeidah.</p>\n<p>In this sentence “et Yachidcha asher ahavtah” means the <em>unique or distinguished</em> individual who you love.</p>\n<p>It is actually referring to his servant, Eliezer who was in charge of running Abraham’s business affairs.</p>\n<p>Eliezer was one of those who Avraham thought would inherit his household before Yitzchok was born. The first one mentioned in that sentence (et Bincha) is in fact referring to his eldest son, Yishmael. While the third one mentioned in that sentence, by name is his youngest son, Yitzchok (et Yitzchok).</p>\n<p>Part of the test of the Akeidah was to reveal to Avraham who G-d wanted to inherit his household and his covenant with G-d and his special blessings.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The simple meaning of אחד is \"one\" to the exclusion of others.</p>\n<p>When something is מיוחד or \"unique\" it means that is has the attribute of being one relative to the rest of it's category, for example a unique vase is only unique in the sense that other vases are not like it, meaning it's \"one\".</p>\n<p>Speaking about a יחיד is speaking about \"one\" individual to the exclusion of others.</p>\n<p>While probably not intended, your question about יחד \"together\", still fits this mold, being that two individuals who are together, are a unit that excludes others.</p>\n\n\n",

(without doing any bad deed)</p>\n<p>Note: This question is related to another <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/126036/25377\">question</a> on this site</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I would approach from an answer from a moral philosophy perspective based on fact patterns that could substantiate <em>theoretically</em> moral wrong which gives me the cue that, in fact, certain states of mind (thoughts) could arguably deemed sins from a stand point of religion:</p>\n<p>In general a thought directed to committing a crime and knowing that a crime would be committed if such thought would manifest in action will not be a crime if it is not followed by action aimed at committing the crime.</p>\n<p>However, if the reason is such that is outside of the control of the mind, for e.g. the state of mind is of such determination that action would follow the thought to manifest within a subjectively defined period of time, and manifest crime would ensue absent the sudden and unexpected death of a sinner-to-be, the wrong is equal morally on them as if such unexpected circumstance would not impeded the manifestation of the moral wrong.</p>\n<p>A more halachic hypothetical relates to a question I discussed with my hazan recently:</p>\n<p>If, instead of using Siri, you would be able to turn on the lights at home on Shabbat by a simple brain chip, would that be labor and therein a sin? Clearly.</p>\n<p>Since even if you use Siri, you may say words that, if a phone is not present to cause the lights to turn on, would not be a sin. Just because you use different body parts to cause change in the world of nature that is inappropriate on Shabbat, it is still inappropriate. So what was the difference with the phone being present and not for one to be deemed to have sinned? The state of mind. The fact you knew the phone was there and still said what you knew would cause such change in the world that is inappropriate.</p>\n<p>To further this and in a sense return to the first hypothetical: What if the state of mind is such that includes the (incorrect) information that the phone is on, and the determination to cause the phone to cause the lights to turn on manifests in action and the proper commands are said, but the lights not turn on merely for the reason that the battery of the phone depleted? In half jest: A sinner is born.</p>\n<p>To look at the silent-Siri fact pattern again, let’s presume the same fact pattern, but consider this: Does merely thinking “I want Siri to turn on the lights” or “I should get Siri turn on the lights” are divisible from “Siri turn on the lights” or “Let there be light”. The former are of contemplative in nature the later are not only reflections of determination, but are manifest actions in the mind (presuming you know such technology is available to you and therefore you have the belief such sentences will cause action).</p>\n<p>Now if the phone was dead unbeknownst to you, and you still pronounce the sentence (mentally) or manifest mental action otherwise absent the linguistic concepts like how you call your arms to action, it will still remain equally wrong morally or sinful from a halachic perspective as if the battery would be sufficiently charged and the phone was operable to carry out the mental command.</p>\n<p>If these hypotheticals feel “less than thin air” you may consider similar fact patterns where capital sins or crimes are induced in similar technological context: Turning off autopilot or self-driving on a vehicle transporting at high speeds its otherwise unconscious single occupant by a “spell of thought”.</p>\n<p>But, as you can see, in each of these cases we have had to consider the a determined state of mind or such actually bringing change in the world outside of the mind.</p>\n<p>While it appears clear to me, that by any moral or religious standards, the determined or acting mind cannot, but be deemed prone to condemnable, but the contemplating one does not seem plausibily fallible to these arguments.</p>\n\n\n",

He just wants you to be aware of the second opinion.</p>\n<p>Now, sometimes the Shulchan Aruch writes a different expression, \"there are some who require\" (יש מי שמצריך). I would think this is no different than the rule above. However, here's an example where that seems to not hold true (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.69.19?lang=he&p2=Siftei_Kohen_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.69.78.1&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 69:19</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אחר שנמלח הבשר והודח מותר ליתנו אפילו במים שאינן רותחין ויש מי שמצריך ליתנו במים רותחין</p>\n<p>After the meat has been salted and rinsed, it is permissible to put it in boiling water. And there are some who require you to put it in boiling water.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Shach (§ 78) there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ולהכי הביא המחבר סברא זו דהיכא דאפשר יש לחוש לעשות כן וכמ\"ש בב\"י</p>\n<p>And this is the reason that the Shulchan Aruch brought this opinion, since in cases that it's possible one should be diligent to do so, like he writes in his Beis Yosef.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Where does the Shach see this is the intent of the Shulchan Aruch? He does bring that the Shulchan Aruch in his Beis Yosef writes that when possible one should put it in boiling water, but who says when he wrote his Shulchan Aruch he still held so? Does the Shach somehow see this from the wording of \"יש מי שמצריך\". Meaning, if the Shulchan Aruch didn't hold of it, he would have written ויש אומרים?

    "content": "# What is the difference between Almah vs. Ha-Almah?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>My understanding is that adding \"Ha-\" at the beginning of a noun in Hebrew is the same as adding \"The\" to the beginning of a noun in English. In other words, it means you're pointing to the noun and the noun is specific and known as opposed to being generic and unknown. If that is the case, then who is \"The Almah\" in Isaiah 7:14? Who is Isaiah pointing to?</p>\n<p>To clarify, for the sake of this question, I'm looking for \"The Almah\" pointed out explicitly somewhere in Isaiah's scroll with evidence suggesting why she's \"The Almah\". To give an example, I believe \"Ha-Na'ar\" in verse 16, same chapter, refers to Isaiah's son whereas verse 15, refers to the son \"The Almah\" is going to conceive. Isaiah's son is explicitly mentioned in verse 3 and my reasoning for this is why else would God ask Isaiah to take his son with him? However, I cannot find \"The Almah\" anywhere in Isaiah's scroll. The prophetess in verse 3, the next chapter doesn't really fit the criteria because firstly, the son there is called \"Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz\" not \"Immanuel\"; secondly, Isaiah is explicitly asked to take his son in 7:3 and he's pointed at in verse 16 while he's not asked to take his wife with him to point at her in verse 14. And there's no explicit mention of the wife of Ahaz in this context so I can't see how it could be her either. The reason I believe explicit mention is necessary is because of the \"Ha\" emphasis. Surely the author of Isaiah knew that the scripture must have an explicit pointer somewhere for future readers to be able to identify \"The Almah\". Otherwise, it is my opinion that it opens the door to all sorts of interpretation. If you disagree, I'm open to hear your reasoning.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Since there appears to be no explicit mention of which particular woman the navi is pointing to, the meforshim state that it would be a woman who would normally accompany navi or the king. Thus it is either the queen or the wife of the navi. Any other woman would be referred to specifically. It could theoretically be one of the servants who would normally be found in the \"washing place\", but it is not likely. The king would not normally go there unless it is some sort of official inspection, which is why I think his wife would be with him.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15938/showrashi/true#v14\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Isaiah 7:14</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, the Lord, of His own, shall give you a sign; behold, the\nyoung woman is with child, and she shall bear a son, and she shall\ncall his name Immanuel.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>the young woman:</strong> My wife will conceive this year.

(Like in ראשי תבות, ראשי תיבות)</p>\n<p>That if her status as his wife was revealed, the Torah would have said, \"they came to Egypt...\"emphasizing that they <em>plural</em> are together as a married couple and came to Egypt.</p>\n<p>But by his concealing that status through the term he used to describe her (my sister), the Torah only emphasizes Avram's coming to Egypt individually (<em>not as a married man</em>) even though she accompanied him. When the tax collectors investigated, they discovered her true status demanding more taxes (שתבעו את המכס).</p>\n<p>In other words, this story is discussing the idea of how taxes are determined (<em><strong>in both cases, truthfully</strong></em>) according to how you declare objects, something common to anyone who travels abroad or, for example, makes aliyah, as in immigration to another country.</p>\n<p>If you declare a possession in a particular taxable category, <em>for example a tapestry that can hang on the wall as artwork</em>, the taxes will be higher. If declared in another category, <em>in the example, it can also be declared as a rug to cover your floor</em>, the tax is lower. In both  cases, the declaration is truthful, but one will bring a much higher tax rate and the resulting financial loss.</p>\n<p>In the case of immigration, taxes on property are often not applied for essential items that a single household brings with them. But duplicate items above those essentials are taxed. If Avram and Sarai immigrate as married, the duplicate items of Sarai's household would be charged tax to Avram. What's more, Avram was not entitled to use the items from Sarai's household to pay the tax charged to him because those items do not belong to him in the type of marriage they  had.</p>\n<p>Tax collectors try to determine if belongings are declared properly in order to collect more tax. Anyone who has been involved with aliyah knows this situation well. If declared wrong, it can cost a great deal of money needlessly. Like is known, causing needless financial loss is considered in halacha to be a danger to life (סכנה נפשות). <em>See in this context Sefer S'dei Chemed, on the subject of selling a Beit Kenesset within a Jewish community where it results in a drop in the property value of those Jewish homeowners who remain behind.</em></p>\n<p>Just to clarify further, early Indian (Ceylon) and Arab (pre-Islamic) practice at that time had 2 forms of marriage, <em><strong>Digah marriage</strong></em> and <em><strong>Binah marriage</strong></em>. In <em><strong>Binah marriage</strong></em>, the wife retains her own property, household and inheritance rights.</p>\n<p>This is the origin of the term and idea that women, meaning wives are given <em>\"Binah Yiterah\"</em> like is found in Shas and elsewhere (See <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Niddah.45b.11?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Niddah 45b</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sotah.35b.9?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sotah 35b</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Torah_Temimah_on_Torah%2C_Deuteronomy.11.19.6?vhe=Torah_Temimah,_Vilna,_1904&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Torah Temimah to Devarim 11:19:6</a>).</p>\n<p>The wife in a Binah marriage is financially independent by law, more like a sister, than the wife of a Digah marriage, who is considered like property of her husband (her earnings and belongings become his).</p>\n<p>It should be noted in this context, that the Matriarchs, Sarah, Rivkah, Leah and Rochel maintained their own households (their own tents) apart from the household of their husbands. In other words, the Avot were practicing <em><strong>Binah marriage</strong></em> as was the common practice where Avram and Sarai lived before coming to the land of Israel.</p>\n<p>So in coming to Egypt, where the culture was different, Avram asked Sarai to declare herself as his sister, which was also true, in order that the entry taxes would be lower. They would be immigrating as two individuals with two separate households and the taxes charged to Avram would be substantially lower. Avram would not be <em>killed</em> (like mentioned above from the S'dei Chemed) with the additional taxes like is mentioned in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.12?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 12:12</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, both Avram and Sarai understood (<em>they were both wise</em>), before they ever reached Egypt, (see <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=173\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'al HaTurim to Bereshit 12:13 to אחותי את</a>) that it was likely that the Egyptians would try to acquire Sarai as a wife through the giving of gifts. She, at least, would be enriched materially. This is emphasized by both the commentary of <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=173\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ba'al HaTurim to Bereshit  12:12 on the word יחיו</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9597&st=&pgnum=173\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi to Bereshit 12:13 on למען ייטב לי בעבורך</a>. It wasn't a surprise. They planned together how best to approach this situation and to profit from it materially. This is what is meant when Avram emphasizes that his life would be <em>bound/rolled up</em> with Sarai's future (והיתה נפשי בגללך).</p>\n<p>So to summarize, the translation of the Hebrew doesn't mean that Sarai was hidden in a crate by Avram, like some abusive husband (Even the expression from Bereshit Rabbah, \"נְתָנָהּ בְּתֵבָה וְנָעַל בְּפָנֶיהָ\" is only referring to applying the term <em>my sister</em> to her and covering her face with a veil which was the common practice for all modest women when in public.), but rather that she (meaning her status as Avram's wife) was concealed by a single word, saying that she was Avram's sister.</p>\n\n\n",

Abraham did not start monotheism, according to Jewish tradition, although it wouldn't have survived to the modern era without him. Whether there was ALSO a NON-faithful (monolatrous) Canaanite cult around El Almighty is not a matter of Jewish religious concern but is certainly possible, much as we find in I Kings 18:21 and other places about the Biblical Israelites. Half-belief is often more popular than true belief, but it tends to develop in the context of a pre-existing true belief rather than the true belief springing from out of a half-belief.</p>\n<p>It should be noted that the term, Y-H-W-H, translates as \" He who always was and always will be\". It kind of excludes the idea of being part of a pantheon.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>The Torah explains that Hashem created the world 5780-ish years ago, and spoke to the first man. It then explains that children of man eventually lost sight of Him and developed their own pagan religions. See the first chapters of Genesis.</p>\n<p>Therefore (and this is in the sources, as brought by other answers), <em>one would expect</em> that we will find, in the archeological records, ancient peoples who spoke about God using similar terminology and narrative that the Torah uses. It was known to the first man that the correct way to refer to God is \"El\" and \"Y-H-W-H\", so why is it a surprise that this terminology was also used by his descendants at the time, even the pagan ones that preceded Avraham, and the giving of the Torah? This is exactly what is described in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foreign_Worship_and_Customs_of_the_Nations.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah Hilchot Avodah Zara 1</a> - the pagan religions arose in steps, starting from true worship of God, down to the polytheistic worship of the religions that are recorded in the Torah's history, and the archaeological record.</p>\n<p>The Torah itself shows this in several ways. For example, Rashi says on בראשית 4:16, which says Enosh was אז הוחל לקרוא בשם י-הוה - someone who called in Hashem's Name:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לעשותן עבודה זרה ולקרותן אלהות</p>\n<p>Making idols and calling them after God</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Torah explicitly says that a third generation man on earth, Enosh, worshipped Hashem as Avodah Zara. See also Malkitzedek, in ancient Canaan, blessing Avraham in the name of E-l Elyon in Bereshit 14:18.</p>\n<p>If one <em>starts out</em> with the <em>assumption</em> that Torah is not true, and all religion is made up, then of course one would look at this evidence and understand it <em>backwards</em> - that Judaism evolved from previous pagan cults, and incorporated their terminology, but we know that it's the other way around.</p>\n<p>Therefore, his/her conclusion that Judaism incorporated this terminology is nothing but an theory - educated guess work to try to make sense of something through a non-Torah, secular/agnostic and evolution-based lens. It is certainly not evidence, let alone <em>proof</em> that the Torah and its narrative is incorrect. Unfortunately, a lot of people are swayed by this argument due to its plausibility (as well as generally shared secular outlook), just like they are swayed by the argument that it is <em>plausible</em> that religion is made up to explain the things that the ignorant people who lived before science didn't have an explanation for. It is bad thinking to conclude something is true simply because it is plausible.</p>\n<p>Some more rationalist Orthodox Jews do take this \"plausible theory\", and other similar ones from archeological findings, very seriously, and will try to find a \"nice way\" to say that Judaism did indeed evolve from pagan religions, but it's ok, it's all part of Hashem's plan etc, and there are more middle of the road theories* in contemporary Jewish thinking, but it's certainly not necessary, nor the mainstream Orthodox or especially Ultra Orthodox way of looking at things, and absent from traditional sources, as the other answers have demonstrated.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>* It's worth noting as an aside that there is more complexity to be found in our sources about the past than the simple and popular 6000 years model. Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan zl brings many of them in his works (e.g. <a href=\"http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/9562914550\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kabbalah and the Age of the Universe</a>), and <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/a/103222/31534\">here is an answer</a> that contains some further information on this.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>In a not-widely-known piece on Bereishis 14:18 (\"MalkiTzedek... priest to El Elyon\"), the Ohr Hachaim says the following:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.14.18.5?with=all&lang=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.14.18.5?with=all&lang=he</a></p>\n<p>ואומרו לאל עליון, להיות שהיה להם אלוהות אמצעיים כידוע לכסילים אמר כי זה כהן לאל עליון על כל האלוהות שהיו להם אז</p>\n<p>\"[and regarding the verse’s] statement \"El Elyon\", since they had intermediate deities as is known to fools, it says that he was the priest to the God that was above all the gods that they had in those days…\"</p>\n<p>This would answer the question asked by many, which is how Avraham was different from the monotheism that preceded him, known in traditional sources as \"Yeshivat Shem Ve'Ever\". Presumably, his uniqueness was that he completely rejected all the lesser gods. It is interesting that he seems to respect MalkiTzedek. In fact, rabbinic tradition, fully upheld by the Ohr Hachaim himself, identifies MalkiTzedek as Shem, son of Noah, teacher of Avraham, Jacob and Joseph, and paradigm of righteousness.</p>\n<p>As the disciple of MalkiTzedek/Shem, Avraham forged a new path. Judaism, according to the Ohr Hachaim, developed from a monolatrous Canaanite cult devoted to El Elyon.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "What are Sabbath Observing Animals? What are the implications of Sabbath Observant Animals?",
    "content": "# What are Sabbath Observing Animals? What are the implications of Sabbath Observant Animals?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A friend of mine brought me a source/comment from Avodah Zarah 1:6 which stated Jews are prohibited from putting Sabbath observant animals into the position where they will have to break the Sabbath.</p>\n<p>I have many questions about this. Such as \"What counts as a Sabbath observant animal?\" \"Is there limits to which species of animals that can be considered Sabbath Observant? Could a pig become Sabbath observant?\" (I'm thinking of pigs trained to look for mushrooms and the like) And \"Since our animals can apparently become Sabbath observant, are we under any obligation to teach them Sabbath observance?\"</p>\n<p>I know these rules were originally set when animals \"working\" was typically limited to farm animals like oxen who plow fields. But now we have animals trained for myriads of work. Dogs are trained to work for the blind, or to comfort those that are sick, or to shepherd sheep, etc. Even smaller animals such as rats are trained and put to work to detect land mines. Would all of these animals if owned by a Jew be deserving of Sabbath rest? And is a Jew required to teach any animals that work for him to observe the Sabbath? Or is there limitations?</p>\n<p>Note: I've attached a screenshot of what my friend sent me. I don't know the source other than Avodah Zarah 1:6 and Sefaria</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z7IER.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/z7IER.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>(Some of this is drawn from <a href=\"https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Animals_on_Shabbat\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://www.halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Animals_on_Shabbat</a>)</p>\n<p>I think Sefaria's language of \"Sabbath-observant animal\" was a bit confusing.</p>\n<p><strong>Any animal</strong> owned by a Jew may not <strong>be prompted</strong> to do activity <strong>prohibited for a Jew themselves to do on Sabbath.</strong></p>\n<p>Let's break that statement down, and hopefully all your questions will be answered. The key verse on this is Exodus 23:12; <em>so that your ox and donkey can rest like you.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Any animal</strong></p>\n<p>Maimonides Sabbath 20:1.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אסור להוציא משא על הבהמה בשבת, שנאמר \"למען ינוח, שורך וחמורך\" (שמות כג,יב)--אחד שור ואחד חמור, ואחד כל בהמה וחיה ועוף.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One may not have an animal carry out a burden on the Sabbath, as it says <em>so that your ox and donkey shall rest</em> -- this applies whether it's an ox, a donkey, or <em>any domesticated animal, wild animal, or even bird.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Can't be prompted</strong></p>\n<p>Rashi on Exodus 23:12 (quoting Mechilta):</p>\n<p>למען ינוח שורך וחמרך. תן לו ניח, להתיר שיהא תולש ואוכל עשבים מן הקרקע; או אינו אלא יחבשנו בתוך הבית? אמרת אין זה ניח אלא צער:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Give your animal a rest -- but that allows the animal itself to detach grass from the earth and eat it [though you couldn't use it to power your own reaping]. Does \"let your animals rest\" instead mean \"lock your animal inside?\" No; that's not rest for the animal; it's painful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So that's where the \"Sabbath-observant\" language got confusing. My cow is welcome to go do whatever it wants to do. I just can't <em>work</em> it.</p>\n<p><strong>Sabbath-prohibited activity</strong></p>\n<p>A lot to unpack there. Let's start with \"carrying in a public space.\" I'm allowed to wear clothes in an unenclosed public space (for modesty, decoration, or protection from the elements) but not carry a backpack. Same thing -- I can put a sweater on my animal if it's cold, but not have my animal carry a burden for me. I could hire a Sabbath-observant improv troupe to perform at my event as there's no <em>melacha</em> per se involved (there are some additional conditions on that, but that's for another time), so I can ask my dog to entertain folks by rolling over.</p>\n<p>The case in the Mishna concerned oxen, which everyone knew were used to carry loads in the public thoroughfare, plow, or otherwise do Sabbath-prohibited labor.</p>\n<p>Let's get to your questions, then:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>are we under any obligation to teach them Sabbath observance?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It's not about teaching the animal. It can do as it pleases. If it's a day when you can't work, you can't tell it to work. (It's not just Sabbaths, it's holidays too by the way.)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Could a pig become Sabbath observant?\" (I'm thinking of pigs trained to look for mushrooms and the like)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We're generally not sanguine about Jews raising pigs, but the point is the same. I suppose sniffing <em>per se</em> is not prohibited labor (I could hire a Sabbath-observant chef to sniff my salad and tell me what it needs), but the digging/detaching of the mushroom would be.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I know these rules were originally set when animals \"working\" was typically limited to farm animals like oxen who plow fields. But now we have animals trained for myriads of work.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The key here is <em>Sabbath-prohibited labor.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dogs are trained to work for the blind, or to comfort those that are sick, or to shepherd sheep, etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therapy's the easy one, as there's no \"Sabbath labor\" involved. If you can cuddle with your own dog, you could have your dog provide therapy for others.</p>\n<p>Service dogs: let's do an easy one -- a dog smells indications of an epileptic seizure and warns the human. Sniffing is allowed on Sabbath. Moving on to the seeing-eye dog: if the neighborhood has an <em>eruv</em> enclosure and carrying is permitted, then you're fine. If not, this gets slightly trickier. I can walk my dog on a leash because the leash benefits the dog (like when I wear a raincoat); it keeps the dog from running away where it could be hurt. The harness on a seeing-eye dog could, however, be viewed as entirely there to help the human and thus more akin to an ox carrying my burden. (<em>Shemirat Shabbath Kehilchata</em> Ch. 18, footnote 62. Rabbi Auerbach allowed it, though his student Rabbi Neuwirth isn't so sure.)</p>\n<p>Herding sheep -- anything you'd be ordering the dog to do? Once it's trained to herd, you don't have to stop it from doing what's normal.</p>\n<p>Bomb-sniffing rodents -- obviously, \"save a life by stopping bombs\" comes above all else. But even without that -- sniffing isn't Sabbath-prohibited labor.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And is a Jew required to teach any animals that work for him to observe the Sabbath?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Your obligation is entirely <em>passive.</em> No obligation to \"Sabbath-train\" your animal. (There is a fun story about some holy rabbi's animal that refused to work on Sabbath, even when stolen by a non-Jew; but that's not what the law requires.)</p>\n\n\n",

This means that a garment requires fringes when it has four corners but not when it has three. But cannot the text also mean that the garment must have four fringes but not five? To guard against this inference, the text concludes, \"wherewith thou coverest thyself\", i.e., even if it has five corners or more. Why however should a garment with five corners be included in the obligation and one with three corners be exempted, seeing that neither has four corners? The answer is that the number five includes the number four. Accordingly, when fringes are inserted in a garment with five or six corners, they are to be inserted in those four of the five or six corners, that are furthest from each other, for it is said, \"On the four corners of thy vesture.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>More explicitly, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_on_Menachot%2C_Hilchot_Tzitzit.3.1?lang=he&with=all&lang2=he\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh (Laws of Tzitzith 3:1)</a> (cited by the Kesef Mishna) explaining a Sifrei, as well as Menachoth 37b, rules that any garment with more than four corners, including an eight cornered garment, only requires tzitzith on the outermost four corners:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והא דתניא בספרי בפרש' ועשו להם ציצית על כנפי בגדיהם שומע אני אף בעלי ג' ובעלי ה' ובעלי ו' ובעלי ז' ובעלי <strong>ח'</strong> במשמע ת\"ל ארבע כנפות יצאו בעלי ג' ובעלי ה' ובעלי ו' ובעלי ז' ובעלי ח'. נ\"ל דהכי פירושו אי לא כתיב אלא על כנפי בגדיהם ה\"א דכל (ס\"א שבכל) כנפים שיש לבגד אמרה תורה לעשות ציצית הן מעט הן הרבה ת\"ל על ד' כנפות ונתמעטו מעט והרבה. ובעלי ג' פסול אף אם הטיל ארבע (ס\"א והרבה ונתמעטו בעלי ג' שהוא פסול אף אם הטיל בו בד' ציצית) דעל ארבע בעיא וליכא. ונתמעטו בעלת ה' <strong>ויותר</strong> שאין להטיל בכל הכנפים אלא בד' מהם:</p>\n<p>That which was taught in the Sifrei regarding the passage \"and they shall make for themselves fringes on the corners of their garments\": \"I hear even [garments] of three, five, six, seven, or <strong>eight</strong> [corners] are implied...\" [implying that they are actually not required to have fringes]. It appears to me that this is the explanation [of this passage of Sifrei]: If it was only written \"...on the corners of their garments\", I would have thought that all the corners of the garment are required by the Torah to have fringes, whether there are few or many.  Thus, [we derive from the verse:] \"on the <em>four</em> corners\" and many and few are excluded.  And three-cornered [garments] are invalid [for the commandment] even if he put [on them fringes] for [they] need to be placed on four corners which they do not have.  And [a garment] with five <strong>or more</strong> corners are excluded [from having the fringes on all their corners] for [the fringes] are not to be put on all the corners, rather only on four of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, the Shulchan Arukh rules (without caveat or comment of the Ramo):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>טלית שאין לה ד' כנפו' פטורה יש לה יותר מארבע חייבת ועושה לה ארבע ציציות בארבע כנפו' המרוחקות זו מזו יותר:</p>\n<p>A tallit with less than four corners is exempt [from the requirement of tzitzit]. One with more than four corners requires tzitzit, and they should be put on the four corners that are the furthest from each other.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Because just like a seal that is on a document cannot be done through someone else, with another person signing this name, this would be regarded as a forgery, and every seal is not worth anything unless the the owner (of the letter/document) himself seals it, so too with a bris milah, Hashem Himself seals it and testifies on the bris (the covenant) between Himself and Israel.</p>\n<p>And with this we can now answer the question in the Teshuvas Chasam Sofer why we call the Sandek the 'baal habris' (lit. the owner of the covenant) even though the main mitzvah is done by the mohel.

But the main bris is performed by Hashem Himself and that is how we understand \"You made a covenant with him\".</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I appreciate that I am missing the rest of this piece, and therefore I am missing some points that I would love to have clarity on.

Now God says \"what comes next logically? Aha, that would be the plant life, and only after that there will be planets, and after that, there will be animals\".</p>\n<p>In this blueprint, the plants are envisioned on the third day, before the planets, that are envisioned on the fourth, according to some Godly idea.</p>\n<p>What is this idea (not implementation) of putting the plant life after the firmament and before the celestial bodies?</p>\n<p>Does it mean the plants are more or less important?

Therefore they can't move (intentionally), they can only grow.

If Betulah really means virgin, my question is why does <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.24.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis 24:16</a> which uses this word to describe Rebekah, feels the need to also say \"no man had known her\" וְאִ֖ישׁ לֹ֣א יְדָעָ֑הּ?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 6)\n\n<p>Betulah specifically means a woman whose hymen is intact. The hebrew word for a woman's hymen is בְּתוּלִים (betulim), from the same root. This is borne out of a careful read of the following verses.</p>\n<p>First, note that the passage in Deuteronomy 22:13-21 about a man who defames his wife, hinges on the woman having had a hymen. The man comes and says \"אֶת־הָאִשָּׁ֤ה הַזֹּאת֙ לָקַ֔חְתִּי וָאֶקְרַ֣ב אֵלֶ֔יהָ וְלֹא־מָצָ֥אתִי לָ֖הּ <strong>בְּתוּלִֽים</strong>.\" This means that he slept with her after their wedding and found that she did not have <strong>betulim</strong>, an intact hymen, and therefore must have cheated on him. Her parents then respond by וְהוֹצִיאוּ אֶת־<strong>בְּתוּלֵי</strong> הַֽנַּעֲרָה (lit. bring out the <strong>betulim</strong> of the young woman) bringing out evidence in the form of a bloody sheet that she was a virgin on their wedding night. This determines the meaning of <strong>בתולים betulim</strong> as the hymen.</p>\n<p>Next, note the Kohen Gadol is commanded to marry only a specific kind of woman, described twice in the passage: first in Leviticus 21:13 as אִשָּׁה בִבְתוּלֶיהָ יִקָּח which literally means \"and a women with her <strong>betulim</strong> he should take\", and then in the next verse the requirement is repeated as \"כִּ֛י אִם־<strong>בְּתוּלָ֥ה</strong> מֵעַמָּ֖יו יִקַּ֥ח אִשָּֽׁה a <strong>betulah</strong> from his people as a wife\". The parallel structure indicates that בתולה betulah is equivalent to אשה בבתוליה a woman with her hymen.</p>\n<p>There remains your question about Genesis 24:16 (or other places where the word \"betulah\" isn't used to indicate virginity, such as Leviticus 21:3 or Numbers 31:17-18). Rashi on your verse explains that betulah only means having an intact hymen, whereas וְאִ֖ישׁ לֹ֣א יְדָעָ֑הּ \"and no man had known her\" comes to exclude other types of sexual interaction that don't involve breaking the hymen. Rebekah had not engaged in any such activity.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rashi explains that that phrase was added to praise Rivka. It was no novelty that she had her hymen intact, as even her neighbors protected their’s. However to not have known a man at all, even through the untraditional means was praiseworthy and therefore added.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Тhere is a difference here between the language of the Torah (the Pentateuch) and the language of the Sages.</p>\n<p>In case you think this is the plain meaning, see Rambam, Mishneh Torah, The Laws of Forbidden Intercourse, Ch.17:</p>\n\n    מצות עשה על כוהן גדול, שיישא נערה בתולה; ומשתבגור, תיאסר עליו:\nשנאמר \"והוא, אישה בבתוליה ייקח\" (ויקרא כא,יג)--\"אישה\", לא קטנה;\n    \"בבתוליה\", לא בוגרת.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Was the man who wrestled with Jacob, God?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>It seems to me that the most plain reading of the passage in Genesis 32:22-32 suggests the man who wrestled with Jacob was somehow God, as crazy or as insane as it may sound. I'm looking for alternative understandings that can make proper sense of verse 30 which says: \"So Jacob called the place Peniel, saying, “It is because I saw God face to face, and yet my life was spared.\"</p>\n<p>I understand that the word Elohim that is translated to \"God\" above can be used to even refer to human beings or angelic creatures. However, I believe God is the correct translation here because Jacob talks about his life being spared in spite of seeing Elohim face to face. We see a similar wording in Exodus 24:9-11 which is irrefutably talking about God. So if Jacob didn't wrestle with God, was he simply wrong in verse 30? And if so, why would the Torah not correct him, knowing that this may be interpreted as a true statement?</p>\n<p>There are other examples in the Torah such as Genesis 16 in which we're told explicitly that an angel of God (Mal-ach Adonay) appears to Hagar for example yet Hagar refers to this angel as YHWH and names him (Attah El Roi) meaning You are the God who sees me. There's more examples of this of course. And there's another interesting example in Genesis 22 in which the angel of God who stops Abraham says to him that you have not withheld your son from Me, even though Abraham was about to offer his son to God so here we have this angel speaking as if somehow he himself is God. Thoughts?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>The verse you quote from <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.33.20?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&ven=The_Koren_Jerusalem_Bible&lang=bi&with=Translations&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Exodus</a> actually disproves your theory. There G-d said</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for no man shall see me, and live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>yet here Jacob says he saw Elohim face to face. So this would prove that Jacob is referring to an angel, and not G-d.</p>\n<p>In the case of the last paragraph, Hagar was speaking to G-d directly, as all humans can. G-d was speaking to her through an angel because she was not a prophetess, but she responded to G-d directly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Genesis 32:25-33 is about Esau - there's a number of parallels with him and the entity that wrestles with Jacob.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Jacob wrestles with the \"man\" (Genesis 32:25).

    "content": "# Signing off the bracha of 'magen Avraham' with just Avraham\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Parshas Lech Lecha 12:2</a>, the pasuk famously reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְאֶֽעֶשְׂךָ֙ לְג֣וֹי גָּד֔וֹל וַאֲבָ֣רֶכְךָ֔ וַאֲגַדְּלָ֖ה שְׁמֶ֑ךָ וֶהְיֵ֖ה בְּרָכָֽה׃</p>\n<p>I will make of you a great nation, And I will bless you; I will make your name great, And you shall be a blessing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.12-17?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.12.2.3&lang2=bi&w2=all&lang3=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> there writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והיה ברכה. הַבְּרָכוֹת נְתוּנוֹת בְּיָדְךָ; עַד עַכְשָׁו הָיוּ בְיָדִי, בֵּרַכְתִּי לְאָדָם וְנֹחַ, וּמֵעַכְשָׁו אַתָּה תְבָרֵךְ אֶת אֲשֶׁר תַּחְפֹּץ (בראשית רבה). דָּבָר אַחֵר ואעשך לגוי גדול זֶה שֶׁאוֹמְרִים אֱלֹהֵי אַבְרָהָם, ואברכך זֶה שֶׁאוֹמְרִים אֱלֹהֵי יִצְחָק, ואגדלה שמך זֶה שֶׁאוֹמְרִים אֱלֹהֵי יַעֲקֹב. יָכוֹל יִהְיוּ חוֹתְמִין בְּכֻלָּן, תַּלְמוּד לוֹמַר וֶהְיֵה בְּרָכָה, <strong>בְּךָ חוֹתְמִין וְלֹא בָהֶם</strong></p>\n<p>והיה ברכה AND BE THOU A BLESSING — Blessings are entrusted to you; hitherto they were in My power — I blessed Adam and Noah — but from now on you shall bless whomsoever you wish (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.39.11?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Genesis Rabbah 39:11</a>) Another explanation is: AND I WILL MAKE THEE A GREAT NATION, this alludes to the fact that we say in our prayer “God of Abraham”; AND I WILL BLESS THEE — that we say, “God of Isaac”; AND I WILL MAKE THY NAME GREAT — that we say, “God of Jacob”. One might think that we should conclude the benediction in which these invocations are recited by mentioning again the names of all the patriarchs — the text therefore states “Be thou a blessing” meaning, <strong>with you (i.e. with your name only) shall they conclude the benediction and not with them (their names)</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.117b.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 117b</a>). (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see based off the Gemara in Pesachim that rather than conclude the bracha with all the avos, we only do so with Avraham.</p>\n<p>The Maharal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Gur_Aryeh_on_Bereishit.12.2.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gur Aryeh</a> helps provide a reason why:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בך חותמין כו'. ואם תאמר מאחר שכלם אבות למה לא יחתום בכולם, ואין זה קשיא, דאין חותמין בשתים, כדאמרינן במסכת ברכות (מט.). ואם תאמר מאי שנא אברהם, נראה מפני שהבן בכח האב ואין האב בכח הבן, ולכך בחתימת אברהם יש חתימה יצחק ויעקב. ואלו דברים הם אמת למבינים, והוא דבר נעלם</p>\n<p>With you (i.e. Just Avraham's name) they conclude the Bracha etc. And if you will say since they are all fathers why not sign off with them all (i.e. say Avraham, Yitzchak and Yaakov)? And this is not a problem, since we do not conclude with two (themes). Like we say in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.49a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Brachos 49a</a> and if you say how is Avraham different it would seem that the son is in the power of the father and the father is not in the power of the son , and therefore included in the signing off of Avraham is both Yitzchak and Yaakov. And these words are true to those who understand them and it is a hidden matter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So my questions are as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>How are the individual Avos to be regarded as a separate themes? Surely, whilst they embodied different core middos e.g. Avraham - chesed, Yitzchak - gevurah and Yaakov - emes/Torah they <strong>all</strong> still represent the concept of being our forebears, i.e. the Patriarchs who established the standard for us all?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And if we say like the Maharal that the 'son is in the power of the father' and thus Avraham encompasses all of them - why then do we make a point of starting the bracha mentioning all three. Surely there too we could just say Avraham?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In regard to your  second question, the answer is that all the Avos are separate, and deserve to be mentioned separately. However,  it is not possible to mention them all in the closing, so we mention the one that includes the most, which is Avraham.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>From the perspective of the <em>binyan</em> (structure) of <em>Chesed</em>, <em>Gevurah</em> and <em>Emes</em>, <em>Chesed</em> is a \"child element\", not an <em>av</em>. I.e. <em>chesed</em> is not intrinsically associated with the <em>koach ha'holadah</em> (power to father/beget). This is because <em>chesed</em> implies there is happiness/fulfilment in the current state so there is no need to be <em>molid</em> (beget future generations). Therefore the <em>koach ha'avhus</em> of Avraham Avinu (that which he was a \"Father\" to the Jewish people) is not a <em>toldah</em> (derivative) of his <em>middas ha'chesed</em>.</p>\n<p>From this perspective, Yitzchak and Yaakov were not <em>toldos</em> (derivatives) of Avraham's <em>middas ha'chesed</em>. Rather each created anew their own <em>derech</em> (way) in serving Hashem. That is why each is mentioned separately in the <em>berachah</em>. However, from the perspective of <em>koach gufa</em>, i.e. from the perspective that is was Avraham who had the perspicacity, endurance and strength to found the Jewish people, Yitzchak and Yaakov are included in Avraham, because that is where they got their own perspicacity from.</p>\n<p>Therefore we can conceive of the entity of the Jewish people in two ways. We can consider the Jewish people to be a coalescing of the individual avodah of each of the <em>avos</em> or we can consider the Jewish people to come entirely from the <em>koach</em> of Avraham.</p>\n<p>Relative to the second perspective, we are <em>mesayem</em> (complete the first blessing of Shemone Esrei) with just Avraham, as he is the <em>amud ha'kol</em> (foundation of everything). Relative to the first perspective, we mention each <em>av</em> separately within the <em>berachah</em>.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Midrash_Tehillim.18.25?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Midrash Shocher Tov/Tehillim 18:25</a> notes that what stands Avraham apart, is Hashem refined him through 10 tests:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דבר אחר האל תמים דרכו. זה אברהם שנאמר (בראשית יז א) התהלך לפני והיה תמים. אמרת ה' צרופה. שצרפו הקב\"ה בעשר נסיונות. ואלו הן - כשירד לתוך כבשן האש שנאמר (שם טו ז) אני ה' אשר הוצאתיך מאור כשדים. שנים כשאמר לו לך לך. ושנים בשרה. בהגר (שם טז ב) בא נא אל שפחתי. ובישמעאל (שם כא י) גרש האמה הזאת. ובמלכים (שם יד יד) וירק את חניכיו. ובמילה שאמר לו הקב\"ה (שם יז א) התהלך לפני והיה תמים. ובין הבתרים כשראה המלכיות משעבדות לבניו. וביצחק (שם כב ב) קח נא את בנך את יחידך. הוי אמרת ה' צרופה מגן הוא. אומות העכו\"ם אומרים למה הקב\"ה מחבב לאברהם הצילו מכבשן האש ומן תשעה מלכים ואוכלוסין ומכל הצרות שעברו עליו. אמר להן הקב\"ה הריני אומר לו שיקריב את בנו והוא שומע לי וחוסה בי לפיכך אני מגינו. הוי מגן הוא לכל החוסים בו. ולמחר מברכין בניו בתפלה ברוך מגן אברהם.</p>\n<p>Another thing: God's way is perfect. This refers to Abraham, as it says, \"And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God; walk before me, and be thou perfect.\" (Genesis 17:1) You have said, \"The LORD is a shield.\" This means that the Lord refined Abraham through ten trials. These are: when he was thrown into the fiery furnace, as it says, \"I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans\" (Genesis 15:7); twice when God told him to go, and twice with Sarah, in Gerar when he said, \"Come to my handmaid\" (Genesis 16:2), with Ishmael when he sent away Hagar, and when he smote the kings (Genesis 14:14); and when God said to him, \"Walk before me, and be thou perfect\" (Genesis 17:1). And during the latter trials, when he saw that the kingdoms were enslaving his descendants, and in Isaac, when God said, \"Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac\" (Genesis 22:2). Therefore, you have said, \"The LORD is a shield\" for all who seek refuge in Him. The nations of the world ask, \"Why did God love Abraham so much, that He saved him from the fiery furnace, from nine kings and populations, and from all the troubles that he experienced?\" God replied, \"I am saying to him, 'Sacrifice your son,' and he listens to me and trusts in me. Therefore, I shield him. He is a shield for all who trust in Him.\" And tomorrow, his children will bless him in prayer, saying, \"Blessed be the shield of Abraham...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Lech_Lecha%2C_Torah_Ohr.41?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shelah HaKadosh, Torah Shebichsav, Lech Lecha, Torah Ohr</a> provides a more Kabbalistic answer, that the closing of the bracha in Avraham's name is because he is regarded as the \"father\" of all of them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והגם שהאבות הם מרכבה (בר\"ר מז, ו), מכל מקום אברהם אבינו שהוא אב הראשון הוא כולל כלם, על כן חתימתו מגן אברהם, כי מגן הם שרי מרכבה דמדריגת האבות חסד גבורה תפארת כדפירשתי.</p>\n<p>Although all the patriarchs have been described as the מרכבה (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereshit_Rabbah.47.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis Rabbah 47:6</a>), they are all included when Abraham is mentioned; he, being the \"father\" of them all, represents them also. This is the reason that the first benediction in the daily עמידה prayer concludes with the signature מגן אברהם, \"shield of Abraham.\" The term \"shield\" is used to describe those who support the מרכבה, namely חסד, גבורה, תפארת.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

    "title": "How is there \"peace\" bimromav?",
    "content": "# How is there \"peace\" bimromav?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>At the end of a full(er) Kaddish, and at the end of shmoneh esrei there is a line \"oseh shalom bimromav\". The meaning seems to be an invocation of Hashem as the one who makes peace in his high places.</p>\n<p>Rashi and the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Job.25.2?lang=bi&with=Malbim&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Malbim</a> on Iyov 25:2 point to \"peace\" in the sky (the ascension of the constellations and the power of natural forces) but is the sky, home to the stars and sun the \"marom\" in which Hashem makes peace?</p>\n<p>The constellations have order imposed on them, not really \"peace\" and the idea that the natural forces have independent wills that would otherwise not work in harmony with each other and therefore need to be kept at peace seems strange.</p>\n<p>Are there other explanations as to what peace Hashem has to (present tense) continually make bimromav, in His high places? [and is there a specific peace, HAshalom, that has to be made during the 10 days of T'shuva according to those opinions which recommend this change?]</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Rashi Iyov 25:2 has another explanation, that fire and water are intermingled and the water doesn't douse the fire.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לשון אחר עושה שלום במרומיו - אש ומים בלולין , ואין מים מכבין את האש.\nכך שמעתי</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>A lot of ideas have already been mentioned, I will just add the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.23b.14?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 23b</a> which writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דְּאָמַר רַבִּי יוֹחָנָן מַאי דִּכְתִיב הַמְשֵׁל וָפַחַד עִמּוֹ עוֹשֶׂה שָׁלוֹם בִּמְרוֹמָיו מֵעוֹלָם לֹא רָאֲתָה חַמָּה פְּגִימָתָהּ שֶׁל לְבָנָה וְלֹא פְּגִימָתָהּ שֶׁל קֶשֶׁת פְּגִימָתָהּ שֶׁל לְבָנָה דְּחָלְשָׁה דַּעְתַּהּ פְּגִימָתָהּ שֶׁל קֶשֶׁת דְּלָא לֵימְרוּ עוֹבְדֵי הַחַמָּה</p>\n<p>As Rabbi Yoḥanan said: What is the meaning of that which is written: “Dominion and fear are with Him, He makes peace in His high places” (Job 25:2)? It means that the sun has never seen the concave side of the new moon, nor has it ever seen the concave side of a rainbow, both of which always face away from the sun. It has never seen the concave side of the moon, as the moon would be distressed by a sense of inadequacy if its concave side faced the sun. Therefore the sun sees only the full roundness of its convex side. In this way He makes peace in His high places between the sun and the moon. Furthermore, the sun has never seen the concave side of a rainbow, so that the worshippers of the sun not say, as though the sun is a god...\n(Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the idea is that Hashem created the celestial bodies in a way that neither would feel outdone or overawed by the other. Hashem's place on high is one in which peace is the overarching order of the day.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Akeidat_Yitzchak.87.1.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Akeidas Yitzchak 87</a> explains the mechanics of this chazal:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומאמר זה הוא נפלא מאד אל כוונתינו כי הנה באמת הבלתי אפשרות והנמנע הקיים שיפול בשתרא' החמה פגימתה של לבנה בשום צד הוא עצמו ענין השלום וההסכמה המחוייבת לקיום מציאותם שאם תראה החמה פגימת הלבנה הנה תבטל החמה מטבעה ויפסד כחה אשר הוא להאיר אל עבר פניה ושלא יראה לפניו דבר סמוך ועל זה הענין נמצא ג\"כ (במדרש ד\"ר פ' ה') אמר רבי לוי אין אחד מהמזלות הללו שהם מהלכים ברקיע שרואה מה שלפניו אלא מה שאחריו כאדם שעולה בסולם ופניו לאחוריו שיהא כל מזל ומזל אומר אני ראשון הוי עושה שלום במרומיו <strong>הנה שקראו שלום אל תכלית יושר סדרן ותיכן מצבן עד שאי אפשר ליפול שום שבוש ובלבול בשום מעשה ממעשיהם</strong></p>\n<p>And this piece (i.e. Rosh Hashanah 23b) is a great wonder to us, since it is truly impossible and implausible that the sun might come to see the defect of the moon on either side and this is a matter of peace? And the accepted view to the existence of their reality, that if the sun sees the defect of the moon it will cancel out its natural heat and deplete its power which illuminates from itself, or that it can't see something so close? And this matter we find also in the Midrash, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Devarim_Rabbah.5.12?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim Rabbah chapt. 5</a> - Rabbi Levi said there is not one of the constellations that does not go in the sky that sees what is before it, but rather only that which is behind it. It is like a man ascending a ladder, facing behind him, so that each and every constellation will say I am first thereby making peace in His heights.\" <strong>So here they called \"peace\" for the purpose of orderly honesty, and there is a situation where it is impossible to fall into any disorder and confusion in any of their deeds.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Alternatively, the Maharal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Derekh_Chayim.1.18.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Derech Hashem</a> understands the word \"shalom\" in the context of \"bimromav\" to mean a sense of completeness. It is this completeness which lend a state of harmony in the creation of G-d's world. The fact that the celestial bodies do not change as they were made perfect by Hashem means there is no need for any strife in the Heavenly realm.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>(I heard the following wonderful explanation like 10 years ago which really touched me, but I unfortunately cannot find the source for this anymore.

We should also know that Hashem has in mind for each and every one of us a special place to \"shine\", to fulfill our potential.

Therefore we wish that we should be able to rise like stars, confident of our own orbit or rising, and not envy about others.</p>\n\n\n",

In order to say 248 words in , the chazzan repeats the words \"ה' אלוקיכם אמת\". If one davens without a minyan one should say \"אל מלך נאמן\" in order to reach 248 words. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berurah.61.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">משנה ברורה, או\"ח ס\"א, ס\"ק ו.</a></p>\n<p>Hearing the words from the chazzan works with the concept of שומע כעונה.

The Tanna Kama says that none of them are, while R' Eliezer (Gemara) or Rabbi Yosi (Sofrim) says that יהוה is, אלהים is not with one exception.  The Minchas Shai points out that Yonasan ben Uziel, who was also a Tanna, doesn't exactly follow either of those opinions and treats more instances of אלהים as holy.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Foundations_of_the_Torah.6.9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> follows the Tanna Kama that all of the names are not holy.  The Radak, followed by the Minchas Shai, doesn't exactly disagree, but says it's better to be strict like R' Yosi and not erase those names.  (The Minchas Shai also adds that כל ימי היות בית אלהים בשילה, which R' Yosi brings as an exception, is holy according to everyone.)</p>\n<p>How should you pronounce יהוה when reading these verses?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>אדני, like we do in most places?  That seems very strange if it's not holy.</li>\n<li>אדנַי, with a patach, which is <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.19.2\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">apparently</a> the chol version of אדנָי?</li>\n<li>אלהים, like we do where it's next to אדני?</li>\n<li>As it's written?  If so, with what nekudos?  This seems to be the simplest answer, because there's seemingly no reason to change the pronunciation out of respect, but I've never heard anything like it before.  If anything, I've heard <em>not</em> to say Jehovah's Witnesses when referring to the Christian group, which would seem to be an analagous case.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: -3)\n\n<p>I believe the premise of the question is incorrect. When we say that this or that shem (name of God) is not holy, we are always referring to an ambiguous case. Yud he is always holy without exception.</p>\n<p>In the passages in question, there are two types of names used, yud he and alef lamed. The question is only on the second name, which is often used to refer to other gods. The Gemmara on this point can be misread, but it would seem that the line about yud he being holy is agreed upon by all sides, and is not part of the discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Chanina said: The Sages were lenient on the villages to allow them to bring the reading forward to the court day so that they can supply food and water to their brothers in the cities.Is this to say that it's for the benefit of the cities? but it was taught in the Mishnah: If Purim falls on Monday, the villages and large towns read on that day. And if it's as you say, they should bring the reading forward to the previous court day! <em><strong>This would bring it to the 10th, and the Sages did not enact the 10th as a possible day.</strong></em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>TL;DR: The <a href=\"https://www.themercava.com/app/books/metanav/7153\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a> asks, \"Why can't we do this?\" and it answers \"Because the rabbis didn't establish it.</p>\n<p>My question is, is that the question is \"Why did the Rabbis not allow this?\" and the answer is \"It's because they didn't allow it.\" <em>But the question is WHY the rabbis didn't allow it</em> so this answer is not very satisfactory. IN summary, my 2 questions are\n1)Why did the Gemara use such flimsy logic?\n2) What's the <em>real</em> reason why the Rabbis didn't allow it?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Your question is asked in the sefer <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=36267&st=&pgnum=32&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Beis Yitzchak</a>. He answers that the original takanah was not about reading on Monday and Thursday, because the decree that the courts should sit on Monday and Thursday hadn't been decreed yet. That decree came later in the time of Ezra. Rather, the sages in the time of Mordechai decreed that the courts of later generations could institute to read the Megillah earlier if they saw the need, but only up to the eleventh.</p>\n<p>Now you really run into the same problem in the next step of the gemara, so see what he answers there.</p>\n<p>A simpler approach is that sometimes the gemara says things that could be disproven in multiple ways, but only uses one way to disprove them. What matters is that at the end of the day we get to the truth.

How do we reconcile this statement with the verses 4-6 from which we deduced that Noach entered the ark already 7 days before the onset of the deluge? We must conclude that whereas the animals entered the ark at the beginning of the seven day period, Noach, who entered with them and made things comfortable for them, still commuted between the ark and his regular home. It is possible that even the animals and the birds still grazed in the vicinity of the ark, knowing that as soon as the rains would start their place was only inside the ark. They did not look forward to having to spend any more time than absolutely necessary for their survival inside the ark. On the seventh day, i.e. the 17th of the month, they all entered the ark for the last time prior to the earth having dried sufficiently after the deluge to enable them to disembark. As soon as everybody was inside, Noach locked the exit door, as well as the window which he had built into the roof of the ark, seeing the waters of the deluge would commence to descend on this very day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When the Torah had described the donations for the making of the golden calf which, according to Aaron (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.32.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">32:2</a>), should have been given by the women and the girls, the Torah did not report any of the women giving up their jewellery for such a project. This is why the Torah reports the men as divesting themselves of their own jewelry instead (in that verse). Solomon alluded to this when he wrote in Kohelet 7,28: אדם אחד מאלף מצאתי ואשה בכל אלה לא מצאתי, “I have found one man in a thousand, but I have not even found one woman amongst these,” (who contributed to אלה, the word used when the Israelites were told to look upon that calf as a deity).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to the Rabbeinu Bachaye this verse is actually a praise to the women and not something that views them negatively.</p>\n\n\n",

He therefore asks Dovid to sit on His right so that he can truly recognise that Dovid is a mere mortal king and only serves as Hashem's assistant.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שב לימיני, יצייר שכסא דוד הוא כסא ה' כמ\"ש וישב שלמה על כסא ה' למלך, כאלו ה' יושב על כסא ההנהגה להנהיג את ישראל בהשגחה מיוחדת, כמלך המנהיג את עמו, ודוד יושב על כסא המלוכה לימינו, ובאשר היושב על הכסא צריך הדום לרגליו</p>\n<p>Sit at my right: Hashem is delineating that the throne of Dovid is really the throne of Hashem.

If someone merits that G-d helps them regularly, we say G-d's presence is \"with\" them, metaphorically speaking. So G-d's presence is at David's right hand, assisting him.

This spelling can also be seen in the Tal'mūdh where the name is written as מיטטרון, including Yōdh acting as a mater lectionis.</p>\n<p>Could this perhaps indicate that the first vowel at least was most likely either a Ṣērēy or Ḥīrīq originally? There is also the question as to whether the first Ṭēyth should be vowelised with a Qāmāṣ or Pathaḥ? It seems that most variations would agree with Pathaḥ, but what of Dāghēsh Ḥāzaq being placed in Ṭēyth? It seems the majority would disagree with this.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough the earliest Arabic form of his name is: ميططرون‎ (Mīṭaṭrūn), also referred to as Mīṭaṭrūsh. This could indicate that Ḥīrīq and Pathaḥ are the original vowelisation, with Ḥōlām becoming a Ū in Arabic as it lacks an Ō sound. Although one could also argue that Arabic lacks an E sound, hence it becomes an Ī. Then again, why would the Tal'mūdh add a Yōdh too? I find this very fascinating.</p>\n<p>It could also be that the variety in the name's pronounciation also reflects a difference in the old vocalisation traditions. Namely Tiberian and Babylonian. From what I know of the two and their general notation, I would have to theorise that \"Meṭāṭ'rōn\" for example would be the Tiberian pronounciation. While \"Mīṭaṭ'rōn\" would better suit the Babylonian pronounciation.</p>\n<p>In the Babylonian Tradition one would often find a Ḥīrīq or Pathaḥ where a Seghōl or Shă'wā would be in the Tiberian. In th Babylonian Tradition however, there is no Seghōl. E is represented Ṣērēy only, and Pathaḥ and Seghōl are one and the same. Producing an A sound as still can be seen in the Yemenite Tradition.</p>\n<p>It would appear that since the spelling \"מיטטרון\" (with Yōdh as Mater Lectionis) is found in the Tal'mūdh Bāv'lī, that it does indeed reflect a Babylonian Tradition with Ḥīrīq being the first vowel. From my own study and personal opinion, the Babylonian Tradition also seems much older and natural in pronounciation than the Tiberian. Controversial perhaps, seeing how the Tiberian became and still is the dominant notation system. However it is indisputable that the Babylonian Notation predates it and came first (dating to at least the 6th Century C.E.).</p>\n<p>The Babylonian Pronounciation also better represents the Ancient Greek and Latin Transliterations of Hebrew from Antiquity. Such examples can be taken from Jerome of Stridon (347–420 C.E.), famed as the translator who created the Latin Vulgate. Jerome transliterated \"Burnings\" as \"Masarfoth\". In the Babylonian pronounciation this would be מַשִׂרפוֹת‬‎ (Maśīrfōth), while in the Tiberian it would be מִשְׂרְפ֣וֹת‬‎ (Mīś'ră'fōth). Origen of Alexandria (185–254 C.E.), who created the Hexapla (A collection of the Biblical Texts in Hebrew, Greek Transliteration and Greek for comparative study) also provides us many examples of the Babylonian pronounciation being the most ancient. One is the transliteration ϊκερσου (Ikersou) \"let them (not) wink\", which in the Babylonian Tradition is pronounced יִקִרצוּ (Yīqīrṣū). While in the Tiberian it is יִקְרְצוּ‬‎ (Yīq'ră'ṣū). Many other examples showing the Antiquity of the Babylonian Tradition can be found in the Septuagint (last quarter of first millennium B.C.E.) of course. One great example being the name of the Prophet Jeremiah (ע\"ה), which in Greek is written Ιερεμιας (Ieremias). The Babylonian Notation marks this as יִרִמיָהוּ (Yīrīmyāhū), while the Tiberian marks his name as יִרְמְיָהוּ (Yīr'mă'yāhū).‬‎ My apologies for skewing off topic a little, I do feel that more light should be shed upon this rich and ancient tradition though.</p>\n<p>Anyway thank you for any help anyone can give, and for sharing your opinions on this too!</p>\n\n\n",

Namely, your lulav itself was sued for a mitzvah, whereas the leftover food was not. It may of been set aside for a mitzvah, but was never actually used since in the end it was not eaten.</p>\n<p>Same can be said for left over matzah or maror, food from seudas mitzvah etc. In fact the same is said for leftover oil of shabbos candles as well as other left overs of a mitzvah. Since in the end they were not actually used, but only set aside, they are permitted to be used as normal. Unless the person had in mind to dedicate the entire amount to the mitzvah even if it would not be needed, in which case it would be assur.</p>\n<p>Tosfos in Shabbos 44A mentions this as the reason we do not use the leftover oil of Chanuka while we do use the leftover from Shabbos and even leftover from Succos. He explains that the difference is that by Chanuka the person specifically wants to dedicate it all out of his love for this mitzvah, whereas by the other cases, if it is not needed he does not mean to dedicate it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שבנר ושבקערה אסור ור' שמעון מתיר - ואחר השבת מותר אפי' לר' יהודה וה\"נ תניא לקמן גבי נויי סוכה אסור להסתפק מהן עד מוצאי י\"ט האחרון אבל בתר הכי שרי וקשה לר\"י דמ\"ש מנר חנוכה דתניא כבה ליל ראשון מוסיף עליו בליל ב' ומדליק בו כבה ליל ח' עושה לו מדורה בפני עצמו מפני שהוקצה למצותו ואומר ר\"י דנר חנוכה עיקרו לא להנאתו בא אלא לפרסומי ניסא ומשום חביבותא דנס אינו מצפה שיכבה אלא מקצה לגמרי למצוה אבל נר שבת להנאתו בא יושב ומצפה שיכבה ולכך מותר</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Spanish Rishonim generally speaking had sundry variations on that in their prayer books.</p>\n<p>In [our editions of] the Yerushalmi (Berakhot 6:1) the text is presented as אשר ברא נפשות רבות להחיות בהם נפש כל חי ברוך אתה יי חי העולמים which is a typical long-form blessing structure. The Geonim and Ashkenazi Rishonim generally speaking had sundry variations on that in their prayer books. (See <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=20685&st=&pgnum=142\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Siddur R' Saadya Gaon</a>, Machzor Vitri #54, Siddur Rashi #75, <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=4&daf=104b\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfot Pesachim 104b</a>, Or Zarua 1:183, Raavyah Berakhot 98, Rokeach 341, Berakhot Maharam [of Rothenberg] #1, Tashbetz Katan #322, Rosh/Tur OC 207.

Shu\"t R' Natronai Gaon OC #9.)</p>\n<p>The Spanish-born Rambam (#184) and Rashba (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1376&pgnum=84\" rel=\"noreferrer\">1:149</a>) were both asked about the practice of using a long-form blessing structure and answered in the negative, almost even confused at the question. Apparently it seems the Ashkenazi tradition continued [or was willing to accept] the Yerushalmi tradition whilst the Spanish tradition continued [or balked at straying from] the Bavli text.</p>\n<p>Prima facie, this isn't really an issue of potential blessings in vain since the whole thing is still one blessing (eg. we wouldn't ordinarily say that someone who says a long-form blessing by accident has said <em>two</em> blessings in vain). The Mishna (Berakhot 1:4) does warn us to not add conclusions to short-form blessings AND to not remove conclusions from long-form blessings. Accordingly, we're stuck and have to pick a side and that's what people did.</p>\n<p>Rabbenu Yonah (Berakhot 32a) following his local Spanish practice viewed the blessing as a short-form one, but in light of the text in the Yerushalmi thought it worthwhile to add a pseudo-conclusion without God's name. R' Yosef Karo (OC 207) views this stringency of adding to the short-form blessing as worthwhile (ראוי) and writes to do so in his Shulchan Arukh. (This compromise position definitely doesn't hurt but it's not so clear that it really helps anything; perhaps he was really trying to include the phrase חי העולמים which was apparently \"original\" into a straight short-form text.)</p>\n<p>However we mustn't let this stringency become a leniency. Usually one much answer Amen to a blessing within a short time span after hearing it (OC 124:8). Seemingly, for this position the time starts after נפש כל חי since that's really the end of the blessing. Additionally, some are strict to recite Tefillat HaDerekh after another blessing (OC 110:6) which seemingly needs to be a long-form one (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/shas.aspx?mesechta=15&daf=8\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Tosfot Ketubbot 8a</a>); accordingly, this blessing would not work since it's really a short-form blessing.</p>\n<p>But what of the Ashkenazi practice? Rama notes the common practice to use a proper conclusion without qualms in his Darkei Moshe (at least in the parallel case of OC 127) but makes no comment in the Shulchan Arukh, which might indicate he saw the compromise position of Rabbenu Yonah as worthwhile as well, though the full conclusion was still around in his student's code (<a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=9222&st=&pgnum=125\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Levush 207</a>) which may indicate Rama may have simply not felt a need to comment on every small detail of Nusach that people knew from their prayer books. The Vilna Gaon (Maaseh Rav #45 and #76) accepted the traditional Ashkenazi Nusach, as he generally did, but even among his students it's generally unheard of these days probably due to the influence of the Shulchan Arukh.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>This is actually a machlokes between the rishonim.\nThe Bavli doesn't mention any chasima but the Yerushalmi does.

Following this \"newer\" addition, Rav Moshe Feinstein ZT\"L (as brought in the Dirshu Mishnah Berurah) holds that one should not prolong that part of the beracha so that anyone answering Amein can still correspond to the original Nusach of the bavli (which excludes \"barch chay haolamim\")</p>\n\n\n",

But \"Sefer\" (book -- whether bound pages or a scroll) is a masculine one. So that \"Sefer Torah\", is a masculine idiom, since the noun is \"sefer\" and \"Torah\" just modifying it.</p>\n<p>Which leads to this interesting contrast between verses.</p>\n<p>Devarim 28:61:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>גַּ֤ם כׇּל־חֳלִי֙ וְכׇל־מַכָּ֔ה אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א כָת֔וּב בְּסֵ֖פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֣ה הַזֹּ֑את יַעְלֵ֤ם יְהֹוָה֙ עָלֶ֔יךָ עַ֖ד הִשָּׁמְדָֽךְ׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Also every sickness and every plague which is not written in this (הזאת, feminine) Seifer Torah, Hashem will raised against you until you are destroyed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Devarim 29:20:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְהִבְדִּיל֤וֹ ה֙' לְרָעָ֔ה מִכֹּ֖ל שִׁבְטֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל כְּכֹל֙ אָל֣וֹת הַבְּרִ֔ית הַכְּתוּבָ֕ה בְּסֵ֥פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֖ה הַזֶּֽה׃</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hashem will single them out from all the tribes of Israel for misfortune, in accordance with all the sanctions of the covenant recorded in this (הזה, masculine) book of Torah.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Deuteronomy.29.20?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi on the latter verse</a> notes the difference in gender, and explains that the difference is in the <em>trop</em>. In the first case, there is a <em>tipecha</em> on the word \"בְּסֵ֖פֶר - <em>basefer</em> / in the book\" (look under the ס), distancing it a bit from the word \"<em>Torah</em>\". This \"this\" is the Torah, so it is \"<em>zos</em>\", in the feminine. In the second case, the בְּסֵ֥פֶר הַתּוֹרָ֖ה are joined -- <em>basefer</em> getting a <em>mercha</em> and only \"<em>Torah</em>\" getting the <em>tipecha</em>. The \"this\" is \"<em>Sefer Torah</em>\", not just \"<em>Torah</em>\".</p>\n<p>I don't know any exception to the above in the Talmuds.

    "content": "# Why isn't Moses mentioned teaching Torah to his sons?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The Torah says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the line of Aaron and Moses at the time that the Lord spoke with Moses on Mount Sinai.  These were the names of Aaron’s sons: Nadav, the first-born, and Avihu, Eleazar and Ithamar. [Numbers 3:1-2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But only Aaron’s four sons are listed!  Moses’ sons are not.  The Talmud says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moses’ nephews are considered as his children because he taught them Torah … Anyone who teaches another person’s son Torah, it is as if he fathered him. [Sanhedrin 19b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Midrash adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Nathan says: Moses was saddened that one of his sons did not stand [in his place], whereupon the Lord said to him: Are the sons of your brother Aaron not like your sons? [Sifrei Devarim 305:2]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Moses taught the sons of Aaron but not his own?  Why?  The Torah that he preached says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְשִׁנַּנְתָּ֣ם לְבָנֶ֔יךָ -- And you will teach it to <strong>your</strong> children. [Deut. 6:7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Does teaching the children of others exempt you from teaching your own?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I'd speculate that because the Cohanim are considered to be the future teachers of the Torah more than the Levi'im to the whole nation (even though they represent the same tribe), it is important to mention that Aharon's sons received the tradition straight from Moses.</p>\n<p>Mentioning that Moses taught his sons is irrelevant to the tradition of passing the Torah.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with what the Gemmarah says in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eruvin.54b.11?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Eruvin 54b</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What was the order of teaching the Oral Law? Moses learned directly from the mouth of the Almighty. Aaron entered ... and Moses taught him ... Aaron’s sons entered, and Moses taught them their lesson...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Your question is premised on the fact that sons of Moshe Rabbeinu aren’t mentioned as being present by Har Sinai. Furthermore, although you didn’t mention it, the process of teaching Torah to the Jews included Aron, his sons, the Elders, the rest of the nation. Moshe’s sons weren’t included together with Aaron’s sons. However, that was also due to the set up on Har Sinai and so we’re back to the original premise that his sons were there and not included on Har Sinai.</p>\n<p>However, in Medrash Rabba (Vayikra 9:6) there is a machlokes as to when Yisro arrived.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ויקח יתרו חותן משה עולה וזבחים לאלהים דא מה עבד לה רבי יוסי בר חנינא עבד כמאן דאמר לאחר מתן תורה נתגייר יתרו איפלגו רבי חייא בר אבא ורבי ינאי חד אמר לאחר מתן תורה נתגייר יתרו וחד אמר קודם מתן תורה נתגייר יתרו א\"ר הונא ולא פליגי מ\"ד קודם מתן תורה נתגייר יתרו כמ\"ד שלמים הקריבו בני נח, ומאן דאמר לאחר מתן תורה נתגייר יתרו כמאן דאמר עולות הקריבו בני נח</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to the one who says that they weren’t there, it would explain why they weren’t mentioned in these places. So even if Moshe taught his sons Torah, they wouldn’t of been mentioned due to the fact that they missed Matan Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Does anyone defend Rashi's interpretation?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>Many Achronim offer an answer for Rashi. The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Penei_Yehoshua_on_Makkot.5a.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Pnei Yehoshua</a> gives an answer based on a sugya in Bava Kama in regards to a מודה בקנס</p>\n<p>I will attempt to try and summarize his answer here.</p>\n<p>Rashi agrees that if someone walks into Bais Din one day and makes an announcement that he is chayiv misah, of course he would not be able to avoid the death penalty that way. (As an aside, the Marharitz Chiyus points out that if someone does not want to get the death penalty he could just avoid saying \"Al das Kein\" when the witnesses warn him which is a prerequisite to get the death penalty).</p>\n<p>What Rashi is talking about is a case where the Bais Din is judging the case and the person admits a further transgression. In the example he brings, a person stole and the Bais Din was judging this issue when he admitted that he also butchered the animal and sold it. In such a situation, any further witnesses that come will be אינן יכול להזימה  since he already admitted it. However this would only work if the Bais Din was already discussing his case.</p>\n<p>Therefore in this case as well, since Bais Din was already discussing his case, if he would admit that he actually killed the person, just not in front of these witnesses but in front of others and on a different day, those second witnesses would be impossible to be mazim and would become passul on that account, and he would get off scot free. However, if he walked in out of nowhere, since it was not in middle of a din torah it would not make them  אינן יכול להזימה and they would be accepted as witnesses afterwards.</p>\n<p>He also explains what Tosfos holds as to why this answer is not sufficient.</p>\n\n\n",

Here are two examples:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RRiZi.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/RRiZi.jpg\" alt=\"unhewn Kotel bottom block\" /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FDO0b.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/FDO0b.jpg\" alt=\"unhewn lower-level Kotel block\" /></a></p>\n<p>Archeologists learned some fascinating things about the architectural process of the building of the Temple from the fact that many or perhaps even most of the bottom blocks were not completely hewn, but I was a little shocked (still am), because in my mind the Temple was supposed to have been built perfectly. It seemed not okay to me to have cut corners (excuse the pun) in the building of the Temple, even if this was part of the outer wall and was ultimately covered in mounds of dirt (this latter reason was why the university lecturer who had organized the trip hadn't been bothered by this fact).</p>\n<p>I am aware that when the Second Temple was first built, corners were cut (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Ezra.3.12-13?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ezra 3:12-13</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Haggai.2.3-9?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagai 2:3-9</a>). But it was my impression that it was simply smaller than intended, probably even not decorated as nicely as the first one. That didn't mean that they didn't do their best to make the small structure itself as perfect as possible. Kal v'chomer, I would think with Herod's Temple, a project that was much better-funded. Were things like this truly okay?</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# In terms of Jewish status, what is the difference between a person who has a sheilah and being plainly non-Jewish?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>A person says he's Jewish. Deeper inquiry reveals that there are sheilos. For Halachically significant areas (e.g. aliyas, minyanim), he's not considered Jewish. But what's the difference between a person who is not Jewish and a person for whom there is a sheiloh that they are Jewish. Are the latter usually from mixed families, and that there is murkiness even though overall it's Jewish. Is the latter more of an honest mistake? A person who claims to be Jewish when there is a sheilah, is he considered a liar?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Someone who is definitely non-Jewish can marry another non-Jew, and has no obligation to keep the specific commandments of Jews. Someone who might be Jewish and might not can't really marry anyone: they can't marry a Jew because they might be non-Jewish, and they can't marry a non-Jew because they might be Jewish. And whether and how they keep the commandments applying to Jews would be a tricky question a competent rabbi would have to answer for their specific circumstances.</p>\n\n\n",

He brought Rivka back home with him.</p>\n<p>I could imagine one reason they wanted to kill him is they simply weren't interested in him taking Rivka with them. I also saw in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Torah.109.5?lang=en&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni loc. cit.</a> that they saw his riches and wanted to kill him, I guess to steal them (although I don't get that, since he gave them to Rivka already...I guess in order to keep Rivka and the riches as well).</p>\n<p>I was wondering if any commentary suggests a different reason why they wanted to kill him.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Hadar Zikeinim Bireishis 24:33 says Besual wanted to kill him.\nBesual was called Besual since he was the leader of the town and all the besulas (virgins) who got married, had to live with him first. The people said you have to do the same to your daughter or we'll kill you. Therefore Besual tried to break the shidduch by trying to kill Eliezer.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>I found an explanation from Rav Chaim Kanievsky <em>shlita</em>, brought in Derech Sicha <em>parshas Bo</em> p. 244</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אומרים בשם ר' העשיל, שלבן רצה על ידי סם שבאוכל להרוג את אליעזר, וקיימא לן במס' נזיר (י\"ב ע\"א) האומר לשלוחו צא וקדש לי אשה סתם ומת השליח אסור בכל הנשים שבעולם, ונמצא שיצחק היה נאסר בכולן.‏</p>\n<p>They say in the name of Rav Heshel, that Lavan wanted to kill Eliezer by putting poison in his food. Since we hold from Nazir 12a that someone who appoints an agent to marry an unspecified woman for them, and the agent dies, that the one who appointed them is forbidden to all women in the world, it turns out then that Yitzchak would be forbidden to all women.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>First of all, he assumes it was Lavan (and not just Besuel, although I don't know why Besuel died and not Lavan) who tried to kill Eliezer. He uses this to explain what we say in the <em>Haggadah</em>: בקש לבן לעקור את הכל, Lavan intended to uproot everything. Meaning, by making Yitzchak forbidden to marry all women, it would prevent him from producing progeny. This would result in the end of the Jewish people, before they ever had a chance to be formed.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Rav Hirsch points out in Chayei Sarah 24:53</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And the servant took out silver articles and golden articles and\ngarments, and he gave [them] to Rebecca, and he gave delicacies to her\nbrother and to her mother.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Hirsch translates מגדנות as <em>delicious fruits</em></p>\n<p><strong>Rashi</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>and… delicacies: Heb. וּמִגְדָּנוֹת.

By the prohibition to look back Lot recognized that the\nloss of all his possessions had been deliberately imposed upon him, it\nwas intended that he should escape with his bare life and leave\neverything behind him.

Yerhamiel Zelcer shlit”a wrote it is difficult to\nunderstand how Bava b. Buta gave advice such as this that the Temple\nbe built [by Herod] for it is written (I Chronicles 22:8) that the\nprophet said to David the King, servant of God, that “you have shed\nmuch blood and fought great battles; you shall not build a House for\nMy name, for you have shed much blood on the earth in My sight.” And\nif this such, all the more so it ought apply to Herod that murdered all\nthe rabbis and certainly it wouldn’t be fit for him to build the\nTemple.</p>\n<p>And when I discussed this matter with Our Master the Admo”r the Penei\nMenahem [R. Pinhas Menahem Alter, the 7th Gerer Rebbe] he told me in\nthe name of the Imrei Emeth [R. Avraham Mordekhai Alter, the fourth\nGerrer Rebbe] David did was not in need of building the Temple, since\nthe fundamental purpose of the Temple is to bring sacrifices, and we\nsee in the Midrash on Parshath Pinhas that “whoever spills the blood\nof the wicked is as if he brought a sacrifice” and also in the Gemara\n(Makkoth 10) “David, addressing himself to the Holy One, blessed be\nHe, said: Lord of the Universe! I heard men saying, ‘When will this\nold man die and let his son Solomon come and build us the Chosen\nShrine and we shall go up there [as pilgrims]?’ and I rejoiced at\nthat. Said the Holy One, blessed be He, to him, a day in thy courts is\nbetter than a thousand! Better to Me one day spent by you in study of\nTorah than a thousand sacrifices that your son Solomon will [some day]\noffer before Me, on the altar!” And so David was not in need of\nsacrifices as such. And it said in the Yalqut Shemuel 2:6 “You shall\nnot build a Temple for My name, for you have shed much blood – the\nHoly One Blessed Be He said to David, do not fear for your life is as\nbefore me like a sacrifice as it is written “you have spilt much blood\nbefore me” and there is naught before me but sacrifice, as is written\n“and you shall slaughter bullock before God”, see there. And I said to\nhim [the Penei Menahem] immediately that this resolves the difficult\nquestion I raised from the episode of Herod since David killed the\nwicked it was well considered as a sacrifice and he was not in need of\nbuilding the Temple, however Herod who had killed the righteous was in\nneed of many sacrifices to atone for his crimes, and quite evidently\nrequired that the Temple be built in order so that he may bring\nsacrifices. And I said, this is indeed a very good answer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Gemara Bava Basra 4A seems to indirectly  answer that question</p>\n<p>וּבָבָא בַּר בּוּטָא הֵיכִי עֲבַד הָכִי וְהָאָמַר רַב יְהוּדָה אָמַר רַב וְאִיתֵּימָא רַבִּי יְהוֹשֻׁעַ בֶּן לֵוִי מִפְּנֵי מָה נֶעֱנַשׁ דָּנִיֵּאל מִפְּנֵי שֶׁהִשִּׂיא עֵצָה\nלִנְבוּכַדְנֶצַּר</p>\n<p><em>And how did Bava ben Buta do this (give advice to Herod the wicked?)

The Gemara elaborates: When the issar increased in value, twenty-four issar stood at one dinar; when they decreased in value, thirty-two issar stood at one dinar. If so, there is a set ratio between the value of a peruta and the value of silver, and there are 192 perutot in one dinar.

    "content": "# Did Rav Hai Gaon pray maariv twice on Friday night when the tsibbur prayed before tseit hakokhavim?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>According to most early decisors, the evening <em>shema</em> should be said after <em>tseit hakokhavim</em> (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Berakhot.1.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">mishna Berakhot 1:1</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.2a.12?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">its gemara</a>), and the <em>rishonim</em> debate how to deal with a <em>tsibbur</em> that is praying <em>maariv</em> before that time. One oft-quoted suggestion in the name of Rav Hai Gaon (see <a href=\"https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=38274&st=&pgnum=11\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Otzar HaGeonim</a>) is to pray the <em>maariv amida</em> with the <em>tsibbur</em> and then say <em>shema</em> with its <em>brakhot</em> after <em>tseit hakokhavim</em> (without repeating the <em>amida</em>). Rav Hai Gaon then adds:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮ואי חזי איניש לצלוי ראשונה בדהדי צבורא רשות ושניה חובה, שפיר דמי.</p>\n<p>If it's possible for one to pray the first as an optional prayer and the second as a required prayer, even better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That is, pray <em>amida</em> twice, first as an <em>nedava</em> prayer (I assume that this is what \"optional\" means, but if there are better suggestions, please profer them), and the second prayer-time (after dark) is a \"normal\" <em>maariv</em> (<em>brakhot shema</em> + <em>shema</em> + <em>amida</em>).</p>\n<p>I am wondering how this last idea might work on Friday. On the one hand, it is forbidden to pray a <em>nedava</em> prayer on Shabbat or Yom Tov (see <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/15623/4940\">here</a>), and saying a Shabbat/Y\"T <em>maariv amida</em> seems to include accepting Shabbat on oneself at that time. On the other hand, perhaps the fact that it is not yet night means that this prohibition on <em>nedava</em> prayers on Shabbat/Y\"T doesn't kick in. Additionally, none of the commentaries that I've seen that quote Rav Hai Gaon mention any difference on Shabbat — while one might expect some to omit mention of Shabbat/Y\"T (since it may be \"obvious\" that it's not possible to do on erev Shabbat/Y\"T), I'd expect at least a few commentaries to bring it up. Compounding the issue, there are versions of what Rav Hai Gaon said that switch around the order of the <em>amidot</em>: first the required <em>amida</em> and later the <em>nedava</em> prayer, when it's certainly fully Shabbat (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=37952&st=&pgnum=325\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Talmidei Rabbeinu Yonah s.v. ומי</a>, with <em>girsaot</em>) — how is this practice permitted?</p>\n<p>Are there any sources that discuss this directly?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Rosh (Berakhot 3:15) quotes R' Hai Gaon as permitting voluntary prayers on Shabbat:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מה שכתב רב אלפס ז\"ל שאין היחיד מתפלל תפלת המוספין נדבה לפי שאינו מתנדב יש מקשים עליו אע\"פ שאינו מתנדב קרבן מוסף סתם מ\"מ מקריב עולות שהן מקרבנות מוסף כמו יחיד שאין מקריב תמיד אלא מתנדב עולה כמו התמיד שהיה עולה. ומתרצי' מפני שעיר חטאת שבמוסף שאינו בא בתורת נדבה. מיהו קשה ממוסף של שבת שאין בו שעיר ואמאי קאמר על כל מוסף סתם שאין היחיד קרב אותו נדבה. וי\"ל אע\"פ שיכול להביא קרבנות של מוסף שבת בתורת נדבה מ\"מ אין יכול להביאם בשבת. לפי תירוץ זה אפילו תפלת יוצר אין להתפלל נדבה בשבת לפי שאין שום קרבן קרב נדבה בשבת. <strong>ורב האי ז\"ל כתב שהיחיד מתפלל תפלת שבת נדבה בין תפלת שחרית ומנחה בין תפלת מוסף</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

I’ll add that it goes further: dead people get the full picture which is ultimately good, so they have no questions but also are at peace. This is illustrated by the famous story involving the Rambam and a young Talmud of his who passed away, but not before promising to come back with answers to specific questions. The legend goes that this Talmud returned and explained how the total picture became crystal clear and he had no reason to question anything.</p>\n<p>When Avraham passed away, it would seem that he would get the entire picture and not be in pain. While alive he wouldn’t see the entire picture: just that Esav would have gone bad, and that alone would have caused him untold grief.</p>\n\n\n",

Some Galician Karaites apparently were also able to understand not only Hebrew and Karaim, but also Yiddish, the language of their Rabbanite neighbours. An anonymous traveller (Reuven Fahn?) mentioned that in addition to their excellent command of Hebrew, the Karaites of Halicz could also speak Yiddish. Another report by Fahn also mentioned the fact that most Karaites could speak Yiddish in the 1890s. The Karaites’ ability to understand Yiddish, in addition to their knowledge of Hebrew, Karaim, and Slavic languages, may be explained only by their rapprochement with the Galician Rabbanite Jews. It seems that Yiddish literacy became even more common among the Galician Karaites in the interwar period...\" (pg. 167)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Later on in the book (ch. 4), Kizilov lists their customs. The following is a summary of what he wrote:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The architectural designs of the synagogues and tombstones were similar to those of the Galician Rabbanites. The key difference was that their arks and tombstones faced the south, the direction they considered Yerushalayim to be, whilst the Rabbanites' faced the east. (pg. 138)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They did not celebrate Chanukah because it was post-biblical. (pg. 139)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>They did not necessitate a minyan for prayer; often there were, indeed, less than ten people in synagogue during prayer times. (pg. 140)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Both men and women wore tzitzit and tallit gadol (unlike in the east, where they wore only tallit gadol). (pp. 140-141)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>At least from the 19th century they had mezuzot on the doorposts. (pg. 142)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Circumcision took place on the seventh day, in the synagogue. After the circumcision, the chazzan took a drop of the child's blood and smeared his forehead with it. There was no priah and metzitzah. (pg. 143)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Most matzot were made of flour, water, eggs and milk. Four special matzot were, If I understood correctly, inscribed with the words \"לחם עני אמן\" and \"מצה ומרור אמן\". (pg. 146)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Strict Shabbat observance, including not warming food and not keeping light/warming fires in synagogues and homes. (pg. 147)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Engagement was via matchmaking. The process included the giving of a dowry by the bride's family to the groom's family. There was also an engagement event called a \"kelesmek\". The marital ceremony always took place on Thursday evening. There was a chuppah. The whole ceremony - songs and everything - was in Hebrew. Only one song was traditionally sung in Karaim (the Karaite language): \"Bu oł bijenc kinimizni kuvanaik (GVKar. “Let us celebrate this happy day of ours”)\". (pp. 152-153)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Anything else you're looking to know?</p>\n\n\n",

If the other witness claims that the elevation was 5 plow handles when the measuring stick was located 10 plow handles away, he has said the exact same thing (elevation ~27 degrees). If the 3rd witness reports that the elevation was 2 meters (same as 1st!) when the ruler was located 2 meters away (half of what the 1st used!), then he is saying that the elevation was 45 degrees which is significantly different from what the 1st observer says.</p>\n<p>If, instead of the plow handles, the Baraisah mentioned <em>fingers</em>, it would have made sense because the assumption would have been that the distance to the measurement device (palm with fingers) is the length of the observer's arm, and the ratio of finger size to the arm's length is sufficiently close for most people to be within the general measuring error for a common person (although, let it be made clear that, 500 years before Mishnah, <em>professional</em> Babylonian astronomers made observations with precision of <em>minutes</em>).</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>Very much like the OP's answer, I suggest that the thickness of and distance to the plow handle is standard.</p>\n<p>First of all, the thickness of a standard plow handle is stated in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishnah_Kelim.17.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishna (Kelim 17:8)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כָּל הַמִּטַּלְטְלִין מְבִיאִין אֶת הַטֻּמְאָה בָּעֳבִי הַמַּרְדֵּעַ, לֹא גָדוֹל וְלֹא קָטָן אֶלָּא בֵינוֹנִי. אֵיזֶה הוּא בֵינוֹנִי, כֹּל שֶׁהֶקֵּפוֹ טָפַח:</p>\n<p>\"Any movable object conveys uncleanness if it is of the thickness of an ox goad\" it is one that is neither big nor small but of moderate size. What is meant by \"one of moderate size?\" One whose circumference is just a handbreadth.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(The commentators give different translations of מרדע, but that's beside the point.)</p>\n<p>It seems like the reason for using this particular common object for measuring an observed height is because it is a long, flat, <em>handheld</em> item. One would hold it flat at arms length and estimate how many of them could be placed on top of each other between the horizon and the new moon.</p>\n<p>The thickness of the handle then is 1/3 of a tefach (handbreath), approximately. The distance is a little less than two amos (cubits), let's say 10 tefachim. So the angles have tangents of about 2/30, 3/30 and 5/30, and the angles are 3.8, 5.7 and 9.5 degrees. Of course, none of these inputs are exact, but there is a very specific ballpark estimate.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>One <em>possible</em> resolution (hinted at in the <em>mathematical background</em> of the question) is that the \"plow handles\" were more or less standard <em>thickness</em> <strong>and</strong> <em>length</em>. and</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>two plow handles high above the horizon</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>means 2 <em>thicknesses</em> over the <em>length</em> (which is reasonably low, as it <em>should</em> be for the new moon on the 1st night it appears -- which is why the alternative of 2 <em>lengths</em> over the <em>length</em> is unacceptable because this is far too high for the new moon on the 1st night it appears).</p>\n<p>E.g., if a <em>plow handle</em> has length/thickness of ~10, then \"two plow handles\" means ~11.3 degrees and \"5 plow handles\" means ~26.6 degrees.</p>\n\n\n",

Such an attribution (for the ch 37 midrash) can be seen in Abarbanel's <a href=\"https://ravzuriel.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/%D7%90%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%91%D7%A0%D7%90%D7%9C-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%9E%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%97%D7%95.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Yeshu'ot M'shiḥo</a> (p. 217 of PDF), but the midrash isn't found in the Bereishit Rabbati that we have today, and neither is the one from ch 35 (even Abarbanel only says that the midrash is \"said to be from Bereishit Rabbati\"). The citations that you are seeing are probably from Pugio Fidei, a medieval Christian polemic by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Martini\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Raymond Martini</a> that allegedly contains extracts of R. Moshe HaDarshan's midrash. The accuracy of these citations is in dispute (as you can see on the linked page).</p>\n<p>The midrash Bereishit Rabbati is not well-known, in my experience, and hardly forms a \"standard interpretation\" of Jewish beliefs (besides the fact that many midrashim are contradictory, and one can't take all midrash at face-value; see especially the question <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/53349/is-belief-in-midrashim-optional\">Is belief in midrashim optional?</a>). Add to that the midrash's late authorship (where the Jewish author was certainly aware of Christianity and its claims) and the fact that the midrash may or may not be in the original, and it's likely that some misinterpretation (to be generous) is going on here.</p>\n<p>But as you asked for an interpretation, let's give the full text of the midrash (the ch 37 one) that Abarbanel cites.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>‮ויאמר אליהם ראובן אל תשפכו דם (בראשית לז, כב), זה שאמר הכתוב: יתומים\nהיינו ואין אב (איכה ה, ג). אמר רבי ברכיה: אמר הקב״ה לישראל אתם אמרתם\nלפני: יתומים היינו ואין אב, אף גואל שאני עתיד להעמיד מכם - אין לו אב,\nשנאמר: הנה איש צמח שמו ומתחתיו יצמח (זכריה ו, יב). וכן הוא אומר: ויעל\nכיונק לפניו (ישעיה נג, ב). ועליו אמר דוד: אני היום ילדתיך (תהלים ב, ז).</p>\n<p>And Reuben went on, \"Shed no blood! ... \" (Genesis 37:22), this is like what the verse says: \"We have become orphans, fatherless\" (Lamentations 5:3). R. Berachya says: the Holy One said to Israel, \"you said to me 'we have become orphans, fatherless', so too the redeemer that I will bring from among you will be fatherless, as it says: 'a man called the Branch shall branch out from the place where he is' (Zechariah 6:12). And it also says: 'for he has grown, by His favor' (Isaiah 53:2). And David said about him: 'I have fathered you this day' (Psalms 2:7).\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Abarbanel says that \"father\" here means \"teacher\" — the Messiah will learn everything via prophecy — and in fact bring back prophecy to Israel — and not gain his wisdom from a human teacher. He then points out that part of the midrash (including the Lamentations verse) is similar to what's found in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eichah_Rabbah.5.3?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Eicha Rabba</a>, where the redeemer refers to Queen Esther, and \"no father\" means \"orphan\". Abarbanel then cites a midrash on Isaiah 53:2 that we no longer have, saying that when the Messiah enters the world, his father will die. He then gives another understanding of \"no father\" as \"no comforter\", and also points out that if God is bringing the Messiah from \"among you\", the Messiah must be like us. He has a few more comments, but the gist of it is here.</p>\n<p>Please be wary of citations to Jewish sources from Christian sites, especially from missionary sources.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>Props to the other answerers (Yaacov Deane, Derdeer) for locating the citation.</sup></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I found on google books a <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=wy-8MPaxC30C&pg=PA68&lpg=PA68&dq=%D7%92%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C+%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99+%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%93+%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F+%D7%9C%D7%95+%D7%90%D7%91&source=bl&ots=W6IZD9n0nP&sig=ACfU3U30JHf4NY1SfTVrrKmzRn6ueAl-4w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjBnKy46Yf0AhW7oXIEHfw4CJEQ6AF6BAgbEAI#v=onepage&q=%D7%92%D7%95%D7%90%D7%9C%20%D7%A9%D7%90%D7%A0%D7%99%20%D7%A2%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%93%20%D7%90%D7%99%D7%9F%20%D7%9C%D7%95%20%D7%90%D7%91&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"sefer yeshuot meshichu\"</a> by Isaac Abrabanel (Don.)

Among other things, he compares it to a similar exigiesis by the same rabbi in Eicha Rabbasi where Esther is referred to as \"a redeemer with no father\", where it clearly means an orphan (Esther 2:7), and explains that the intention here is that the Moshiach will herald the renewal of prophecy, and that although prophets typically study by other prophets of the older generation, the Moshiach will come to prophecy \"without a father\" meaning without a prophet-teacher to raise him up spiritually. It's a long piece, so if you're interested you can read it yourself.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The midrash does exist but not as the Christian missionaries cite it.</p>\n<p>It is actually Midrash Bereshit Rabbati which is based upon the book of Rabbi Moshe HaDarshan (someone quoted by Rashi frequently)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eCKMI.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/eCKMI.jpg\" alt=\"title page of Midrash Bereshit Rabbati\" /></a></p>\n<p>The interpretation of the missionaries is also not correct.</p>\n<p>This midrash is not discussing the birth of Moshiach but rather is discussing a kabbalistic concept found in Torah teaching relating to the concept of the Redeemer who is described in some places by the name Tzemach, which means <em>Sprout</em>, like sprouting from the ground.</p>\n<p>This appears in chapter 35:21 beginning with the words, <em>The Rabbis say Yaacov is a sign for his descendants…</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/84gHX.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/84gHX.jpg\" alt=\"Bereshit Rabbati 35:21\" /></a></p>\n<p>That all that is explained below in regard to what G-d will do for us in connection with this aspect of the final Redemption is a consequence, <em>measure for measure</em> with the actions that Yaacov Avinu took to bury his wife, Rachel at Beit Lechem (Bethlehem) on the road to Efrat.</p>\n<p>In the Talmud and other midrashim it indicates that this midrashic name is specifically associated to the Hebrew name <em>Menachem</em> because they (צמח and מנחם) share the same numerical value. This individual is also referenced in the service of Hoshanah Rabbah during Sukkot.</p>\n<p>This redeemer dies (<em>meaning he is not murdered nor executed, like is emphasized by Rambam in Mishneh Torah, Laws of Kings and their Wars, 11:4</em> ), gets buried in the ground and through that process brings about what is referred to as the ingathering of the <em>Exiles.</em></p>\n<p>This <em>spiritual ingathering</em> is how all the <em>sparks</em>, which are also referred to as <em>Tikkunim</em> in other kabbalistic texts, which have been partially elevated via the blessings (like for example over the food which we eat every day) made by all the Righteous throughout every generation, are elevated to their final intended state (the <em>Source from which they were hewn</em>) through attachment to the soul of this individual who bears the name Tzemach during its ascent from this world to the <em>World of Souls</em>. The sparks <em>hitch a ride</em>, so to speak.</p>\n<p>This ingathering is what is intended in the Amidah prayer in the blessing about <em>Sound the Great Shofar…</em> which is said before the blessings for the re-establishment of the Sanhedrin, the rebuilding of the Temple (<em>the emphasis being that the ingathering precedes the rebuilding of the Temple in Jerusalem</em>) and the <em>resurrection</em> of that same redeemer called both Tzemach and Menachem. This ingathering is also referenced according to Midrash Bereshit Rabbati in Micha 4:6.</p>\n<p>This spiritual ingathering is also referenced by the Ari z”l in Eitz Chaim and also by Rabbi Moshe Chaim Luzzato in his classic, Derech HaShem in context of how the very highest individuals on the spiritual level will perfect not only themselves and those alive during their generation but also all those both before and after them.</p>\n\n\n",

This was indicated by the fact that his hand held on to his brother’s heel. Our Sages tell us that G-d gave him this name (Jacob) to show that he will survive after the destruction of all the nations, as it is written [in Yermiyahu 46:28].’</p>\n<p>We thus might conclude from this that the order of birth was for the sake of the names they would be given (it is said somewhere, I forget where, that names influence character).</p>\n<p>Hope that helps.</p>\n<p>P.S.

Yitzchak's wilful ignorance / self-deception is given away by the fact that he consciously recognizes Yaakov's voice, but he lets himself \"be led astray\" by a single piece of weak evidence because deep down he knows that his taste for meat is not as important as his concern for the welfare of his future generations (kind of like us right now, history does tend to repeat itself).</p>\n<p>There's still a pretense at following the tradition of blessing the first born - humans may be highly adaptable, but for the most part don't like change - but his heart's clearly not in it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# How could Leah daven to change her fetus's gender?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>The gemara brachos 60a asks how could Leah daven for her fetus to change genders if the mishna calls that a wasted tefilla.\nThe gemara gives 2 answers.The first is, acts of miracles are different. I don't understand what this answer is saying. The mishna seems to be saying one can't daven for a miracle.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>Let’s look at what precisely the Mishnah had said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והצועק לשעבר הרי זו תפלת שוא היתה אשתו מעוברת ואומר יהי רצון שתלד אשתי זכר הרי זו תפלת שוא היה בא בדרך ושמע קול צוחה\nבעיר ואומר יהי רצון שלא תהא בתוך ביתי הרי זו תפלת שוא</p>\n<p>BUT TO CRY OVER THE PAST IS TO UTTER A VAIN PRAYER. IF A MAN'S WIFE IS PREGNANT AND HE SAYS, [GOD] GRANT THAT MY WIFE BEAR A MALE CHILD, THIS A VAIN PRAYER. IF HE IS COMING HOME FROM A JOURNEY AND HE HEARS CRIES OF DISTRESS IN THE TOWN AND SAYS, [GOD] GRANT THAT THIS IS NOT IN MY HOUSE, THIS IS A VAIN PRAYER.</p>\n<p>(Soncino translation, capitals in original)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Mishnah seems to be stating a general rule, and then giving two examples of how that rule would apply in practice. The general rule is that you can’t pray for something that has already happened. The two examples of things that you can’t pray for because they have already happened are the sex of your unborn child and the who the victims in the town are.</p>\n<p>Thus far we have seen nothing about miracles. The Mishnah is simply saying that you can’t pray for something that has already happened. It is too late to beseech God for mercy because the act is already done.</p>\n<p>The Talmud then raises a very specific question. It does not challenge the general principle about praying for the past, nor does it being up anything about miracles. The Talmud’s question is simply that praying for the sex of your inborn child cannot be an example of this forbidden prayer, since Leah did it. The simplest explanation of this is that the Talmud has no reason to assume that the sex of the child has already been chosen, and Leah was in fact praying for the future.</p>\n<p>The Talmud then presents two answers. The first answer retains the assumption in the Mishnah that the sex has already been chosen, and acknowledges that in most cases such a prayer would indeed be inappropriate. In this particular case, though, Leah wasn’t actually praying about the past. She acknowledged that the sex had already been chosen; she was specifically asking for a miracle to change the sex. (The miracle is to change the sex now, not to change the past.) This no longer conflicts with the Mishnah’s rule about praying for the past.</p>\n<p>The second answer instead modifies the assumption about the sex having already been chosen. It maintains that in some cases the sex has in fact not been chosen yet, and in those cases it is indeed appropriate to pray for the sex.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Do commentaries address/question the morality of Leah and Rachel's actions against Yaakov regarding switching places?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Leah switches with Rachel to marry Yaakov (parashat ויצא). Following this, Yaakov is surprised (to say the least!), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereshit 29:25</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיְהִ֣י בַבֹּ֔קֶר וְהִנֵּה־הִ֖וא לֵאָ֑ה וַיֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל־לָבָ֗ן מַה־זֹּאת֙ עָשִׂ֣יתָ לִּ֔י הֲלֹ֤א בְרָחֵל֙ עָבַ֣דְתִּי עִמָּ֔ךְ וְלָ֖מָּה רִמִּיתָֽנִי׃</p>\n<p>When morning came, there was Leah! So he said to Laban, “What is this you have done to me? I was in your service for Rachel! Why did you deceive me?”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On this pasuk <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.29.25?lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.29.25.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אֲבָל בַּלַּיְלָה לֹא הָיְתָה לֵאָה, לְפִי שֶׁמָּסַר יַעֲקֹב סִימָנִים לְרָחֵל, וּכְשֶׁרָאֲתָה רָחֵל שֶׁמַּכְנִיסִין לוֹ לֵאָה אָמְרָה: עַכְשָׁו\nתִּכָּלֵם אֲחוֹתִי, עָמְדָה וּמָסְרָה לָהּ אוֹתָן סִימָנִים</p>\n<p>But at night it was not Leah (i. e. he failed to recognise that it was Leah) because Jacob had given Rachel certain secret signs by which they could at all times recognise one another, and <strong>when Rachel saw that they were about to bring Leah to him for the marriage ceremony, she thought, “My sister may now be put to shame”, and she therefore readily transmitted these signs to her</strong> (Megillah 13b)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However, Yaakov directs his anger at <strong>Lavan</strong>.</p>\n<p>Although Rashi shows the 'good intentions' of Rachel, this suggests that Rachel and Leah had colluded against Yaakov. On the face of it, two sisters colluding to misdirect someone to marry the unintended woman, is simply wrong:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Do any commentaries discuss why Yaakov was not angered at Leah and Rachel?</li>\n<li>Do any commentaries imply that what Leah and Rachel did was (morally) wrong?</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As far as your first queston:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do any commentaries discuss why Yaakov was not angered at Leah and Rachel?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Or_HaChaim_on_Genesis.29.25.5-6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ohr HaChaim HaKodosh</a> notes two worthwhile points:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It is also possible that <strong>Jacob referred to the humiliation experienced by Leah who now found herself Jacob's wife and had to expect that her husband would hate her instead of love her</strong>. Jacob's question \"why did you deceive me?\" indicates that he had immediately decided not to divorce Leah but to keep her as a wife.</p>\n<p>He also displayed wisdom by the choice of his words, realising that what had been done could not be undone. <strong>He realised that it would not have been moral to reverse what had been done but resolved to marry Rachel also</strong>. In this manner he hoped that Laban would not now demand an even higher price for Rachel by suggesting that they make a new agreement. He complained to Laban that the latter had seen fit to achieve something by deception which he could have achieved amicably (i.e. that Jacob marry Leah also). (Sefaria translation my emphasis)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So from this we see that his anger was only at Lavan. Lavan was a trickster who swindled Yaakov out of what was rightly his. He acknowledged that Leah had no power against her father and was equally sensitive to her plight.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Midrash Rabba (Parsha 70)discusses a conversation Yackov has with Leah about her not revealing who she was beforehand, and her response.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכָל הַהוּא לֵילְיָא הֲוָה צָוַח לָהּ רָחֵל, וְהִיא עָנְיָא לֵיהּ. בְּצַפְרָא וְהִנֵּה הִיא לֵאָה, אָמַר לָהּ מָה רַמָּיְתָא בַּת רַמָּאָה, לָאו בְּלֵילְיָא הֲוָה קָרֵינָא רָחֵל וְאַתְּ עֲנֵית לִי. אָמְרָה לֵיהּ אִית סַפָּר דְּלֵית לֵיהּ תַּלְמִידִים, לֹא כָךְ הָיָה צוֹוֵחַ לָךְ אֲבוּךְ, עֵשָׂו, וְאַתְּ עָנֵי לֵיהּ. וַיֹּאמֶר אֶל לָבָן מַה זֹּאת עָשִׂיתָ לִי וגו</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In essence, she said just like he tricked his father because his mother told him to, she tricked him because her father told her to.</p>\n<p>There are many commentaries and explanations on deeper levels, but on the surface, this was the discussion.</p>\n\n\n",

On the other hand , modern chassidic music takes arrangements form 80s dance club music which is not appropriate for Jewish music .</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>In his book With Hearts Full of Faith, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matisyahu_Salomon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Matisyahu Salomon</a> says that it is fine to listen to classical music, as long as you don't know that the composer was a bad person. So you could listen to music composed by a good person, or just avoid learning about the composer's personal life.</p>\n<p>As for what qualifies as Jewish music, there is no official definition. The most sensible standard for your request would be to teach tunes popular among Jews, regardless of their origin. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Ovadia Yosef</a> writes in his work Yabia Omer that almost all Jewish tunes originated with non-Jewish songs. He says it is fine to repurpose any song for use in the synagogue except songs composed for idol worship (and brings some opinions that even permit that, although he seems to disagree or consider them a minority).</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -4)\n\n<p>\"Jewish music\" is almost undefinable. Jewish music between Ashkenazim and Sepharadim is wildly different in almost every conceivable way: From modes, rhythms, or even how words are pronounced. Jews don't even chant the Torah in a similar way across our musical systems, and we would expect Torah chanting to be the least \"changed\" or \"diverse\" amongst ourselves. And as you are asking this question in English and are raising objections to where \"Chabad\" and Klezmer music comes from, it sounds like you are dealing with an additional problem of defining Jewish music: Ashkenormativity. Ashkenormativity is often defined as \"<a href=\"https://www.heyalma.com/ashkenormativity-is-a-threat-to-all-jewish-communities/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">a unique form of eurocentrism that has found its way into Jewish culture.</a>\"</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=jewish%20music\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">When people in English talk about Jewish music, they almost always mean European Jewish Music, and almost never any other kind of Jewish music.</a> Even in the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_music#Jewish_prayer_modes\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia Page on Jewish Music</a>, the \"prayer modes\" section is strictly about European Jewish Music, <a href=\"https://www.pizmonim.org/maqamoftheweek.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">completely ignoring the dozens of prayer modes of Sephardic Jews</a>. But what makes klezmer more Jewish than say Yemenite folksongs in Arabic? If you ask the Yemenites, they believe their music is the most closely related to what was done in Judea and therefore Jewish music should really be defined as their music. But their musical tradition is different than the rest of world Jewry, which leads to the following question: Is \"Jewish Music\" better defined as what many Jews do musically, or the music most closely related to what was done in ancient Judea? This is a question that has yet to be answered but it hasn't stopped many English speaking Jews from talking about \"Jewish music\" or \"Jewish food.\"</p>\n<p>As if the idea that Jewish music being limited to European music wasn't odd enough considering how vast and different Jewish music is amongst the different communities, I've noticed the following fallacy amongst Ashkenazi Jews in America. They have some weird notion that their music and food are unique to them and not just copied from their non Jewish neighbors back in Eastern Europe. I think this fallacy is constantly re-enforced because in America only Ashkenazi bakeries make \"Challah,\" and only Ashkenazim play music in public from the Eastern European traditions, and so they think these things are unique to them. What I've also found fascinating is I've often heard these American Ashkenazim sharing their view of Sephardic culture as being \"less unique\" because they view Sepharadim as just \"copying\" Middle Eastern Food and Middle Eastern Music, not realizing they've done the same thing themselves. I haven't noticed this fallacy amongst Ashkenazim who are still in Europe, because they are able to see on a daily basis how their musical and food culture are related to the peoples around them. So as a teacher you may have to push back against these Ashkenormative ideas as part of your teaching.</p>\n<p>My opinion: If your students want to learn Jewish music, then a good place to start is having you and your students grapple with the question: Is it the music that many Jews use? Or is it the music most original to Judea? As part of answering that question teach them where all Jewish music came from, whether it's Eastern European folk music or Church/Choral music, or Arabic Balads and love songs. And then teach them that Jewish music as we have it now is not unique, but rather it's our personal interpretation/appreciation of the musical cultures we find ourselves surrounded by. This is true for Ashkenazim and Sepharadim alike. I'm not versed enough in the music of Yemen to know if Yemenite music is unique compared to their Arab neighbors, I also have the same ignorance regarding Ethiopians.</p>\n\n\n",

Needless to say, corporal punishment was an integral part of all Jewish elementary institutions up to mid 20th century.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, hitting a person is severely prohibited in Judaism, (MT, Hil. Khovel 5.1):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"\"אסור לאדם לחבול בין בעצמו בין בחבירו, ולא החובל בלבד אלא כל המכה אדם כשר מישראל, בין קטן בין גדול בין איש בין אשה דרך נציון, הרי זה עובר בלא תעשה, שנאמר: לא יוסיף להכותו. <strong>אם הזהירה תורה שלא להוסיף בהכאת החוטא, קל וחומר למכה את הצדיק</strong>\".\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If so, how is it Halachicly permitted de-facto for educational purposes? Why do vague suspicions regarding the distant future (Rashi above) override the (Biblical?) prohibition?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Elchanan (Kovetz Hoaros 70:1)says a yesod that by aveiros bein adam lichaveiro (Sins between man and his fellow) you're allowed to do them for your friends benefit that he'll get from it. That's how he explains the gemara in Kesubos 32a that hitting someone is hutra miclalo (there's a time when this issur is permitted)in beis din (giving lashes as a punishment). Why doesn't gemara say it's hutra miclalo when you hit your child to be michanech him or when you give him a bris mila. He answers that, that's not assur (forbidden) since it's for his tikun (perfection). However getting lashes in beis din is for something you did, not future tikun. He also brings the Rambam that the issur of hitting someone is only when you're trying to fight him.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Rav Chaim Kanievsky shlita in <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=50216&st=&pgnum=13&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">חנוך לנער</a> explores this idea and subscribes to the view that hitting is valid in certain circumstances.</p>\n<p>He writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לפעמים צריך להכות, וה\"חושך שבטו שונה את בנו\". מתי שהילד עושה עוולה גדולה, בוודאי שצריך להכותו, אלא שעל האב להתנהג בתבונה ובדעת ולהכותו פעם אחת בהרבה זמן, כי כאשר יכהו בכל יום נאבד כל הערך של העניין. (ועיין בס' \"אבן שלמה\" פרק ו'אות ד')</p>\n<p>Sometime one needs to hit and \"He who spares the rod hates his son\". When the child commits a great injustice (i.e. a very bad thing), he must certainly be hit, but the father must act wisely and knowingly and hit him once in a long time, because when he is hit every day we will lose all value of the matter. (See <a href=\"https://tablet.otzar.org/book/book.php?book=105649&width=-17&scroll=0&udid=16091555989699682&pagenum=76\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Even Sheleima 6:4</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the first point is that a child needs to learn that what was done is incorrect and therefore the father administers a \"potsch\", but one that is done once to teach the lesson. Hitting routinely is counter-intuitive. As the Even Sheleima writes the whole purpose is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רק כונת ההכאה תהיה להצילהו מן העתיד ולא יעול עוד דרכיו</p>\n<p>The intention of the hitting is only that it should save him from the future, that he won't sin/deviate further from his path.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rav Chaim continues by bringing the Midrash you do and notes how Yishmael was left to do as he pleased without any discipline and he ended up becoming the person he was. As Rav Chaim asserts, when a father chastises his son it increases a sense of honour and love and it is this that makes them learn from a parent's example. The same is true (also brought down in the Midrash) with Dovid HaMelech and Adoniyahu. Therefore, hitting is to be viewed as a correctional tool that will serve to help the child in the long run.</p>\n<p>Rav Chaim brings the Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Makkot.8a.14?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Makkos 8a</a> which helps bring this idea out:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אע\"ג דגמיר מצוה דכתיב (משלי כט, יז) יסר בנך ויניחך ויתן מעדנים לנפשך</p>\n<p>Even though the son is learned, it is a mitzva to strike him from time to time, as it is written: “Chastise your son, and he will give you rest; and he will give delight to your soul” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.29.17?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Proverbs 29:17</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

However, Selichos are often labeled nusach Lita or nusach Polin. My understanding is that Lita is Ashkenaz, and Polin is Sefard. In other contexts, it seems that nusach Ashkenaz might be broken down into Lita and Polin sub-dialects. Even inside a standard Sefard siddur there are two versions of the Kel erech apayim prayer when taking out a sefer Torah, titled Ashkenaz Lita and Polin versions.</p>\n<p>I'm a bit confused how this taxonomy works. Can someone explain it to me please?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Each town had its own slight variations in davening, and these differences were especially pronounced in Selichos and other piyutim.  When they started mass producing siddurim, and especially in America when everyone was mixed up and they had to print \"common denominator\" siddurim, things got simplified, and in some cases oversimplified.  It's mostly visible in things that depend on minhag, like piyutim.</p>\n<p>The situation is even worse for Yom Kippur.  The <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/q/85352/11532\">selichos for Yom Kippur</a> didn't make it into most machzorim at all.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Really what Artscroll and others today calls Ashkenaz is a bit of a misnomer.\nNusach Ashkenaz really means the German/Yekkish rite of davening with today is called \"Minhag Ashkenaz\". What Artscroll calls Nusach Ashkenaz is really what in the past was referred to as Nusach Polin. Nusach Lita has pretty much fallen out of use although some aspects of it are incorporated into modern \"Ashkenaz\" siddurim. I personally have never seen a selichos labeled as Nusach Polin. The Artscroll Selichos that says Lita on it means that it is the standar Eastern European selichos rather than the Yekkish/German aka \"Ashkenaz\" selichos. I am not 100% if Nusach Lita is minhag Ha-Gra or something else that was done in Lithuania. Before WWII there was also \"Nusach Ungar\" from Hungary which has survived to some degree in non Chasidish Hungarian Shuls and there was also \"Nusah Russ\" from Russia.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The concept of a universal minhag or nusach is very much a modern invention. In previous generations, these things could change and vary depending on the region. In other words, each locale might have had its own unique customs and variations. As mentioned by other users on this question, Nusach Ashkenaz generally refers to the nusach of German Jewry and eventually this term broadened to include other areas of Europe as well such as Lithuania, Poland, etc.</p>\n<p>Nusach Lita refers to the way non-Hasidic Ashkenazi Jews would pray, while Nusach Polin refers to the Hasidic rite. This can be seen in the way that ArtScroll labels their \"Ashkenaz\" Selichos as Lita (Lithuanian) and their \"Sefard\" Selichos as Polin (Polish).</p>\n<p>Many communities in Poland were Hasidic, and even those that were not sometimes still followed the Hasidic nusach. It is not uncommon to find a non-Hasidic person of Polish ancestry who davens Nusach Sefard, wraps tefillin outwards, etc. customs that are Hasidic in nature.</p>\n\n\n",

And it is written thereafter: “And he encountered the place, and he slept there, because the sun had set” (Genesis 28:11). When Jacob arrived at Haran, he said: Is it possible that I passed a place where my fathers prayed and I did not pray there? When he set his mind to return, the land contracted for him.

    "content": "# How do we know the Rambam is so exact?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There are many yeshiva systems and darchei halimud (most famously Brisk) who analyze the Rambam \"k'chut hasa'arah\" - that is to say, exacting to the point that if the Rambam uses one word, specifically doesn't use another word, or puts a certain halachah in one place versus another. Tremendous amounts of Torah have come out based on these types of questions, but the axiomatic theme is that the Rambam <em>is</em> so exacting in his writing of the Mishnah Torah.</p>\n<p>On what basis is that assumption made?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 8)\n\n<p>This approach, which sees the Rambam as having been precise, systematic and rigorous, in his restatement of the halakhah in the Mishneh Torah, has roots way further than Brisk or the other contemporary methodologies. It can be found expressed in diverse rabbinic characters going back for centuries.</p>\n<p>R. Shem Tobh ibn Gaon (1283 – c. 1330), in his commentary on the Mishneh Torah <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/rambam.aspx?mfid=96190&rid=5090\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Migdal Oz (H. Shehitah 6:8)</a> wrote:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודברי ר\"מ ז\"ל מקובלים מפי רבותיו נ\"ע מפי הגאונים ז\"ל וכפי לשון הגמרא\nלא פחות ולא יתר דקדק על לשונו כמו שתדקדק על לשון הגמרא</p>\n<p>The words of the Rambam were recieved from his masters, and from the\nGeonim, and just as the language of the Talmud is precise and doesn't\ninclude more or less than necessary, so to may be scrutinize his\nlanguage just as we scrutinize the language of the Talmud</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to this perspective, not only are the Rambam's words precise, they are deserving of the same degree of scrutiny as the words of Hazal!</p>\n<p>Discussing a case where the Rambam appears to have overlooked a rabbinic passage in his formulation of the law, R. Yaaqobh Emden (1697 – 1776) wrote (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21198&st=&pgnum=69&hilite=\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Lehem Shamayim, Sheqalim 8:8</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמנם על כרחנו צריך שנפרש דברי הרמב\"ם ז\"ל בענין שיסכימו להלכה ואל האמת,\nכי אי אפשר להמאור הגדול שיטעה בדבר ברור . . . ואף אנו יודעין כמה קושי\nיש בהבנה זו. ומה נעשה וצער גדול היה לנו להחליט הטעות ח\"ו בדברי הרמב\"ם\nז\"ל. על כן לא נמנענו מללמוד עליו זכות מה, שכך היא  חובתינו וכך יפה\nלנו.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, though we must read the Rambam as being in consonance with the halakhah and the truth, it's not possible that the Rambam - the \"Great Illuminator\" made a simple mistake and overlooked a known/relevant rabbinic passage. We must develop a limmud zekhuth when facing such perplexities, and to do so is fit and proper.</p>\n<p>In response to a scholar that sought to resolve a difficulty in the Rambam by alleging that the Rambam was less than exacting in his formulation of the halakhah, the Hida (1724 - 1806) wrote (<a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=821&pgnum=35\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Haim Shaal, vol. 1, s. 15</a>):</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GvpQe.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/GvpQe.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If such approaches are adopted every insignificant student will be\nable to offer them, and what value is there in writing such things?\nFurthermore, Maimonides' greatness is renowned. A number of\nMaimonides' words are difficult to understand, yet the later\nauthorities found a proper explanation, for all of his words are\ncarefully formulated. Therefore, if due to the weakness of our\nintellect we cannot resolve his words, assume that the fault lies with\nus, and if it is empty, it is because of us. This is something that\ndoesn't need to be said and is obvious, and so have I received from my\nteachers that in our day far be it to offer such explanations... The\ngreat authorities of years past were masters of the Torah and they\ncould say whatever appealed to them, but not us.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In others words, saying the Rambam was imprecise is a cheap way of getting out of a difficulty and doing so detracts from learning. If we apply ourselves, we will come to a resolution just like previous generations that faced such questions.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in exploring this topic further, I highly suggest Marc. B. Shapiro's \"Studies in Maimonides and His Interpreters\" which spends about 85 pages navigating it.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Why were Beni Israel, with their numerous number, in panic from the army of the Pharaoh during the Exodus?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>In Exodus 14:\n5 When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the minds of Pharaoh and his officials were changed toward the people, and they said, “What have we done, letting Israel leave our service?” 6 So he had his chariot made ready, and took his army with him; 7 he took six hundred picked chariots and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers over all of them. 8 The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued the Israelites, who were going out boldly. 9 The Egyptians pursued them, all Pharaoh’s horses and chariots, his chariot drivers and his army; they overtook them camped by the sea, by Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.</p>\n<p>and in\nExodus 12:37 The Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides children.</p>\n<p>The following comment from: A Plain Account of Christian Faithfulness: Essays in Honor of David B. McEwan:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\"All the chariots\" did not include those stationed in Upper Egypt, nor even every chariot in Lower Egypt. It simply means every chariot Pharaoh could mobilize quickly in the northeastern Nile Delta, where this narrative is set. Six hundred chariots constituted a formidable force. Yet here, too, the Israelites would have had an insurmountable edge in forces-in-the-field. As nasty a fighting machine as the ancient chariot was against soldiers on foot, in this scenario each chariot would have faced one thousand Israelites. We may trust that Moses, a scion of Pharaoh's house, would have known how to deploy his overwhelming numbers so as to defeat even the best fighting machine of the day. Yet the appearance of Pharaoh and his six hundred chariots threw Israel into a panic?!</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other critics wonder the same...</p>\n<p>Why were Beni Israel, with their numerous number, in panic from the army of the Pharaoh during the Exodus??</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 5)\n\n<p>While he does not point out the superior numbers of Israel, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_ben_Isaac_Bekhor_Shor\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Bekhor Shor</a>  does say <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.10?lang=bi&with=Bekhor%20Shor&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">as follows</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“They were very scared.” because they had been subjected by the\nEgyptians for such a long time, they retained their fear of them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hezekiah_ben_Manoah\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a> answers the question explicitly and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Exodus.14.10?lang=bi&with=Chizkuni&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">in a similar way</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וייראו מאד, “They were very scared.” Why would 600000 male, able\nbodied, Israelites, be so scared of 5000 Egyptians?

They could then jump out of the chariot and attack with swords or spears (as depicted <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avShZS2GJMc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>), but even 1200 or 1800 well-trained men would have difficulty against the few hundred thousand that would have survived the initial attack. Something that I don't think most realize is that there's a chance that the Israelites might have had a minimal amount of training - we find that they were able to actually go out and fight the Amalekites a short time later (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.17.8-13?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemot 17:8-13</a>).<sup>1</sup> But even if they weren't trained at all, they were still <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Exodus.13.18?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">armed</a> - probably with Egyptian weapons.</p>\n<p>The clincher, from what I can tell, is that the 600 hundred chariots were 'only' Pharaoh's <em>elite fighting unit</em> - but other units were part of the strike.

It is very clear from context that a few thousand trained warriors are a better fighting force than an entire nation.

If you know you've been wronged, it's very painful if no one is willing to acknowledge it and pretends nothing happened. \"Ah - just get over it!

Furthermore, it was incumbent upon him\nto soften his words and abate Esav's anger, but he did the opposite!</p>\n<p>Indeed, when we understand it properly, we find that Yitzchak's\nintention all along (by telling Esav 'בא אחיך וגו) was for the benefit and sake of Yaacov. When he saw\nthat this matter was brought about by heaven and realised that it's from\nHashem, he endeavoured to keep the brachot firmly in his hands against Esav's will and despite his disagreement, because it is better that the brachot should be\nfulfilled right now even though\nthis would end up angering Esav. <strong>But for the brachot to be fulfilled, they needed to be heard\nand acknowledged by Esav by grudgingly</strong> (there is a\nprinciple that you can force someone to agree to transfer ownership in\ncertain circumstances: אונסיה גמר ומקני ליה). Proof of this is that it\nwas necessary to tell Esav's angel to admit to the blessings as it is\nwritten: \"I will not let you go, unless you bless me\" (Bereshit\n32:27). It is clear he (Esav) needed <strong>a chance to admit</strong>, and that's why Yitzchak\ndeliberately told him that \"your brother came deceitfully\" and\n\"I have made him a master over you\" etc.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short: Yitzchak, upon figuring out what was going on <em>(halevai we should also be able to immediately recognise the Will of Hashem in tense moments of things going wrong for us, and still keep our faculties and do the right thing!)</em>, proceeded to secure the bracha for Yaacov. He realised that for that to happen: Esav had to <strong>acknowledge and admit</strong> that Yaacov received his own bracha, (and he had to know exactly what happened including the trickery and his new status as Yaacov's subordinate), so that the \"ownership\" of the bracha could transfer effectively. <strong>All of this was l'toelet</strong>.</p>\n<p>Trust me, Saba Yitzchak A\"H <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.27.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">knew</a> how to <em>give a bracha</em>!</p>\n\n\n",

Note that the creation of the Babylonian Talmud was actually an out of the ordinary event, as most Tannaic/Amoraic texts that we have are from Eretz Yisrael. Ultimately, it seems that all Torah centers in the world looked to the Yisraeli center for guidance.</p>\n<p>The first hints at a split between the diaspora and Eretz Yisrael may be seen when we find mentions of halachot of the Babylonians and mishnayot of Babylonians (see my recent answer <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/94644/why-theres-no-mishnah-bavli/127136#127136\">here</a>). This chasm widened as the Babylonians sages continued to become more independent over the course of the Amoraic period. Finally, we find the harsh disagreements between the Babylonian Geonim and the Yisraeli Geonim - so harsh were some of these disagreements, that at times the Geonim of each group actively undermined and minimized the rulings of the other group (I don't have time right now to gather the sources, but see <a href=\"https://elinoarbareket.com/%D7%9E%D7%90%D7%9E%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D/%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%A4%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%92%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%95-%D7%91%D7%91%D7%9C-%D7%A0%D7%92%D7%93-%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%A5-%D7%99%D7%A9%D7%A8%D7%90%D7%9C\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> for a summary).</p>\n<p>I say this to point out that it seems that it was only at the end of the Tannaic period that we see some hints of a split, and even then it was only between Babylon and Eretz Yisrael. As far as we know, the other communities continued to view Eretz Yisrael as the more authoritative center of Torah leadership. In the past I've seen studies that point out that in the early Rishonic period, most European communities were more closely aligned with the halachot of Eretz Yisrael, so we see that in Europe Eretz Yisrael held dominance for many centuries, while the Asian and African communities eventually became aligned with the halachot of Babylon as that center became dominant in the Persian and Muslim empires. I'll bring sources when I'll be able to.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> It occurs to me that the \"Masechet Kelim\" mentioned by the Aruch (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sefer_HeArukh%2C_Letter_Mem.549?vhe=Sefer_HeArukh,_Lublin_1883&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>, but Sefaria's version is corrupted.

So a non Jew may \"assume\" that all Jews eat gefilte fish and latkes and speak Yiddish. Even googling \"Jewish Music\" in English brings the assumption that you would also be searching for Yiddish music.</p>\n<p>Note 3: Only answers that provide sources will be accepted. Posts strictly with personal opinions will likely be deleted.</p>\n<p>Note 4: Ashkenormativity is not simply a matter of \"there are more Ashkenazim so of course more material is Ashkenazi.\" <a href=\"https://www.jewishideas.org/blog/sephardic-rabbis-ashkenazic-garb\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">When people talk about Ashkenormativity they are talking about situations like Sephardic Rabbis being forced to dress like Ashkenazim to be \"taken seriously.\"</a> Or the weird orientalism that sometimes Ashkenazim manifest toward Sephardim/Mizrahim <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7A8JdFC8nc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">like in this video</a>. The Ashkenazi Rabbi in the video repeatedly refers to Rabbi Drori as a \"Sephardi\" and even tells the audience to \"look at him,\" while Rabbi Drori has to wait and inform him that he's actually Yemenite.

Ashkenormativity does indeed exist in some countries, particularly in the US. I myself grew up without any idea that I was Sephardic, let alone with any more than the faintest notion of what the Sephardic legacy pertained to beyond the Rambam, the Spanish Inquisition and jelly doughnuts on Chanukkah.</p>\n<p>Now to put things in perspective, a quick Mashel, which also happens to be a true story. A friend of mine here in Jerusalem has a SUPER Ashkenazi last name, spent years and years in yeshivot, and prays nusach Sepharad at a Sephardi Beit HaKenesset here. One time I asked him \"So did you switch nusachs, or what?\" He laughed and told me \"it's a crazy story\" which he then proceeded to tell me:\nHis grandfather was a German Jew from a middle-claas family that like many other families, Jew and Gentile alike, lost everything except their home during the hyperinflation of the 1920's. As a result, he joined the French Foreign Legion, and was eventually stationed in Algeria, where he proceeded to marry a nice local Jewish girl- of, of course Sephardi extraction. Now, Algerian Jews were indeed subjected to a series of terrible restrictions by Vichy France- they were thrown out of government schools and jobs, some were forced into internment camps in the desert- etc. etc. And yet I think we can say with some confidence that they fared significantly better than those in Germany! At any rate this man was quite happy to have a Sephardi Beit HaKenesset to pray in, and his descendants are religious BH and pray utilizing a North African nusach. Should he have complained about \"Sephardanormativity\"? That he was being marginalized in some way?</p>\n<p>When someone tells you about their minhag, you are free to cheerfully share yours. If they try to correct you (e.g. \"No, when you daven for someone you have to use their mother's name [as per standard Ashkenazi practice]), you can again cheerfully but firmly insist (e.g. \"In my community when we pray for someone's parnassah or shidduch, we use their father's name, that's the way we've always done it\")</p>\n<p>If that grows tiring, you could consider moving to Israel, which has a slight Sephardic majority, and where people are quite aware that different communities have different minhagim. According to the Ramban, all Jews are d'orayta required to live in Israel as soon as it's safe to do so, and most would argue that's been the case since at least 1967.</p>\n<p>Concerning your later points- everyone (for better or worse) adopted Western dress when the State of Israel was founded. For the non-religious, that means jeans and t-shirts, and for the religious, that means Ashkenazi religious garb. It is a bit jarring to see, absolutely. But it's been a social convention for decades now and given how change-resistant religious Israeli society is, it seems unlikely to change. Incidentally, with the exception of the Gulf States this same process occurred throughout the Middle East and North Africa- from Morrocco to Iran, the urban population wears Western garb exclusively.</p>\n<p>Regarding the kidnapped Temani children and the Aleppo codex- the actions of the Israeli government are another category entirely, and are not to be judged within the context you're asking about here</p>\n\n\n",

I have heard a wide range of individual opinions, from activism and awareness to brushing it off as a product of the Exile, an unsolvable issue until the Messianic era (or that it is something left for God to judge and that we should not interfere but rather continue to be a good example to others).</p>\n<p>I'm mainly looking for traditional Jewish responses and less personal opinion. Although I myself believe that we should take great offense to antisemitic remarks, perhaps \"<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Proverbs.15.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a soft answer</a>\" is the proper way.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>On a spiritual level, the Rabbis tell us that anti-semitism is caused by our actions- that is, by our failure to keep the mitzvot. It is often said in the name of <a href=\"https://torah.org/torah-portion/shmuz-parsha-5777-behaaloscha/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rav Chaim Volozhin </a> that  “If the Jew doesn’t make kiddush, the goy will make havdalah.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, a logical response to antisemitism would be to redouble your own Avodat Hashem and do whatever you can to encourage other Jews to keep the mitzvot. Should you be successful, not only will you eliminate antisemitism, you could very well bring the Geulah.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I agree with @robev.  Chazal advises us not to flaunt our blessings to avoid the envy and jealousy that cause antisemitism.  They are tied to this line in Torah:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When Jacob saw that there was grain being sold in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why do you keep looking at one another?” [Genesis 42:1]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Interpretations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since you are strong and handsome, do not stand together in one place, lest the evil eye prevail over you. [Midrash Tanḥuma, Miketz 8:1]  (In other words, I don’t want to lose all of you at once.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Do not show yourselves, when you are satiated, before Esau or Ishmael, so that they not be jealous of you. [Taanit 10b]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Zohar: Even God is displeased when you flaunt your blessings. By provoking the envy of your neighbors, you also provoke Heavenly judgment. [Quoted in Shenei Luchot HaBrit, Torah Shebiktav, Vayeshev, Miketz, Vayigash, Derekh Ḥayyim, Miketz 5]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We can't hide everything -- financial, intellectual, military, social action successes, etc.. The only solution is:  We should be prepared to endure and fight the consequences of our good fortune.</p>\n\n\n",

The Gemara asks: What is this melancholy temper?

And given that ben Temalion in the story in Me'ilah caused mischief by making the daughter of the emperor seem insane, Rashi and Rabbeinu Gershom identified him as a Nutiun.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Reuven Knoll, \"<a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/17558306/Demonology_in_the_literature_of_the_sages_thesis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Demonology in the Literature of the Sages</a>\" [Hebrew], pp. 124-125 and n. 429; Chaggai Dagan, \"Jewish Demons\" [Hebrew], pp. 156, 158.</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Where do the severely depressed and mentally ill fit in within Judaism's view of the world?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>Mental illness is a strange topic because I find it creates conflict with a lot of the beliefs I've been taught about sin and free will.</p>\n<p>The vast majority of the world operates under their own choice. They have the capacity to make decisions and those decisions relate to their judgement. Whether in favor or against.</p>\n<p>The mentally ill don't seem to make sense in this understanding.</p>\n<p>Judaism tends to make these people an exception to the rule. What I mean by that is the severely mentally ill are not typically held to the same standard when it comes to mitzvot observance. There is even a category of people known as <em>shoteh</em> who can't be held responsible for their actions as they were driven by their mental illness.</p>\n<p><strong>My question is this. If Judaism teaches that Jews are brought into this world to observe mitzvot and to live an observant life, why would hashem create Jews who are incapable of observing Jewish law? Not due to personal choice but due to a disease they don't have control over?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Where does a Jew fit into the plan if that Jew was born with the inability to observe due to mental illness? How has this been rationalized by the Rabbis?</strong></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>\"Then, Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years, at an appointed time, in the Festival of Succoth, [after] the year of release,</p>\n<p>When all Israel comes to appear before the Lord, your God, in the place He will choose, you shall read this Torah before all Israel, in their ears.</p>\n<p>Assemble the people: the men, the women, <strong>and the children</strong>, and your stranger in your cities, in order that they hear, and in order that they learn and fear the Lord, your God, and they will observe to do all the words of this Torah.\" ...</p>\n<p>(Deut. 30: 10-12) (Translation - Chabad.org)</p>\n<p>Rashi: <strong>the children</strong>: Why did they come? So that a reward would be given to those who bring them along. — [Chag. 3a]</p>\n<p>Here, the Hebrew word for specifically very small children is used (\"Taf\")</p>\n<p>The Gemara in Talmud tractate Chagigah page 3a wonders why the Torah would command us to bring these small children to hear the public Torah study during the \"Mitzvah of Hakhel\" ?</p>\n<p>\"They said to him that Rabbi Elazar ben Azarya interpreted the following verse: “Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones” (Deuteronomy 31:12). This verse is puzzling: If men come to learn, and women, who might not understand, come at least to hear, why do the little ones come? <strong>They come in order for G-d to give a reward to those who bring them</strong>, i.e., G-d credits those who bring their children to the assembly. Rabbi Yehoshua said to them: This good pearl of wisdom was in your hands, and you tried to conceal it from me?\"</p>\n<p>(Talmud Tractate Chagigah 3a - Translation- Sefaria)</p>\n<p>So we see from here that when dealing with people who will not be able to absorb anything from the Torah lecture (very small children), the Torah is still very excited when they participate and a reward is bestowed upon their parents and family for bringing them along.</p>\n<p>Sometimes those who are incapable of themselves observing Jewish law are in fact created so that others may involve them in the Torah environment and thereby these \"children\" help us all do more mitzvos and gain reward.</p>\n<p>(as an aside, if you will argue that those children would at least eventually grow up as normal adults who would in fact be self-observant etc., and their position as infants is only temporary; still that is no objection, as G-d Himself knows that a certain minority of these \"Taf\" are created and destined to pass away at that young age and were never created to \"grow up\" passed the age of \"Taf\". Still, the Torah commands us to bring these created children to the Torah reading ; who will never absorb or understand it in the simple sense.)</p>\n<p>The second thing we learn from \"the Mitzvah of Hakhel\" is the very fact that G-d does not only value observance made by the stand alone free choice of the worshipper.</p>\n<p>The fact that these children are \"involved\" in the Mitzvah and can thereby bring reward to their family, is worth it all by itself. They do not need to have been able to choose an observant life to be leading an observant life. (For instance, all observant families I know of in the Orthodox Jewish community, will always spend the extra funds and feed their mentally challenged family members exclusively Kosher meals.)</p>\n<p>The Ben Yehoyada (a Talmudic commentary) explains on this passage of Chag. 3a, that we learn from here on a mystical level, that people who could not possibly understand the Torah learning still can absorb it in their soul, and will receive reward for it and even grow to understand it in the World to Come. In fact, he proves this from the hint given that R' Yehoshua ben Chananiah exclaimed: \"This good pearl of wisdom was in your hands, and you tried to conceal it from me?\"</p>\n<p>R' Yehoshua was praised by his Rebbe R' Yochanan ben Zakkai with the term \"happy are those who gave birth to you\". (See Pirkei Avos Ch 2. ) This is considered by some commentators, as a reference to the known practice of R' Yehoshua's mother who used to park his stroller when he was a baby, inside the Torah study hall.</p>\n<p>Of course there are some stories brought in the mystical writings of the Arizal that show how souls can be reincarnated with defects in this world in order to repair sins of past lives. (See Shaar HaGilgulim of R' Chaim Vital, student of the Arizal, at length.)</p>\n<p>On this note, one might wish to read the modern day book \"Galia: Messages from Heaven\" about the revelations from children of autism (or brain damage) about their past lives.</p>\n<p>However, this is not to say that all insane people sinned in a past life.</p>\n<p>\"Hakhel\" teaches that they were created so we should love them, involve them in Torah life, and gain reward.</p>\n<p>The Talmud in Tractate Bava Basra 12b states:</p>\n<p>\"Rabbi Yochanan said: \"After the destruction of the Holy Temple the power of prophecy was taken from the prophets and given to the mentally ill and to children.\"</p>\n<p>My personal take on this teaching is that since the world without the Temple is a very difficult battleground for succeeding in spirituality, prophecy was given to these, so that man can have an excuse for why he didn't obey the prophecy.... that guy was nuts, I didn't know I should take it that seriously!</p>\n<p>Also, I remember learning a Medrash in Yeshiva that said that once King David asked G-d what purpose insanity could possibly have in the world?</p>\n<p>G-d promised him that one day he himself would find use for it. Eventually King David was forced to flee before King Saul and joined the Phillistine King's army for a time. The Phillistines eventually suspected him of still being a loyal Jew. So, before they could imprison him, King David faked insanity and they let him go.</p>\n<p>The Medrash says that the Phillistine King Achish of Gath had an insane daughter at that time and King David and that girl would howl at the moon all night while King David also wrote messages on the palace walls about how Achish and the Queen owed him money.</p>\n<p>The royals couldn't take it anymore, but were very convinced that David was no threat.</p>\n<p>(See I Samuel 21: 11-16, and also Medrash Tehillim 34)</p>\n<p>Finally, I remember an anecdote with no real source, except that I have heard it told more than once, in different Yeshivahs where I learned :</p>\n<p>The Rambam was also a famous doctor. Once, some sages asked him how many physical illnesses are there in the world? The Rambam calculated and gave them a certain number, such and such.</p>\n<p>Then they asked the Rambam how many forms of mental illness were in the world?</p>\n<p>The Rambam quickly retorted: \"What is the number of the population of the Earth right now?\"</p>\n<p>So apparently, the OP might not be so bothered if we realize that somewhere along the line, in this world, we are all a little crazy. That shouldn't stop you from being Torah observant :)</p>\n<p>(If someone can find a source for this story, I would love to hear about it.)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The Ramban says on Exodus 13:16:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְכַוָּנַת כָּל הַמִּצְוֹת שֶׁנַּאֲמִין בֵּאלֹהֵינוּ וְנוֹדֶה אֵלָיו שֶׁהוּא בְּרָאָנוּ, וְהִיא כַּוָּנַת הַיְּצִירָה, שֶׁאֵין לָנוּ טַעַם אַחֵר בַּיְּצִירָה הָרִאשׁוֹנָה, וְאֵין אֵל עֶלְיוֹן חָפֵץ בַּתַּחְתּוֹנִים מִלְּבַד שֶׁיֵּדַע הָאָדָם וְיוֹדֶה לֵאלֹהָיו שֶׁבְּרָאוֹ</p>\n<p>And the purpose of all the commandments is that we believe in our G-d and be thankful to Him for having created us, for we know of no other reason for the first creation [i.e. Adam], and G-d the Most High has no demand on the lower creatures, excepting that man should know and be thankful to G-d for having created him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At least according to the Ramban, your statement that \"Jews are brought into this world to observe mitzvot and to live an observant life\" is possibly inaccurate: the mitzvot (at least in a certain aspect) are a means to the actual purpose of life, which is to know G-d and be thankful to G-d.</p>\n<p>It is possible that for people with mental disabilities the mitzvot are not necessary to achieve their purpose (similar to women, who are exempt from most mitzvot, or gentiles or people before matan torah, who have fewer mitzvot, or even angels who were given no mitzvot, but praise G-d in Heaven regardless; or for example the nation during the splitting of the red sea, about which it says \"a maidservant saw what Ezekiel did not see\"). From my experience this makes sense, as they seem to be often naturally very positive and outstanding people.</p>\n<p>To support the idea that mitzvot are a means to an end, I heard an explanation of \"Beshalach\" that the Torah was only given be'dieved to Bnei Israel as a result of their low moral/spiritual level. This is proved by Exodus 13:17, which says that G-d's original plan was to take them straight to Israel through the land of the Philistines, however because seeing war would cause them to \"return to Egypt,\" a sign of their moral degeneracy, he led them through the desert of Sinai and gave them the Torah instead. If Bnei Israel on leaving Egypt were spiritually on the same level of the Avot, for instance, they could have entered Israel directly without receiving the Torah (this explanation was taught by Rabbi Sharki).</p>\n<p>I think we can find support of this in the Rashi on Exodus 2:13 and\nExodus 3:11-12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַ֠יֹּ֠אמֶר מִ֣י שָֽׂמְךָ֞ לְאִ֨ישׁ שַׂ֤ר וְשֹׁפֵט֙ עָלֵ֔ינוּ הַלְהׇרְגֵ֙נִי֙ אַתָּ֣ה אֹמֵ֔ר כַּאֲשֶׁ֥ר הָרַ֖גְתָּ אֶת־הַמִּצְרִ֑י וַיִּירָ֤א מֹשֶׁה֙ וַיֹּאמַ֔ר אָכֵ֖ן נוֹדַ֥ע הַדָּבָֽר׃</p>\n<p>He retorted, “Who made you chief and ruler over us? Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Moses was frightened, and thought: Then the matter is known!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explains there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אכן נודע הדבר. כְּמַשְׁמָעוֹ. וּמִדְרָשׁוֹ, נוֹדַע לִי הַדָּבָר שֶׁהָיִיתִי תָּמֵהַּ עָלָיו, מֶה חָטְאוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל מִכָּל שִׁבְעִים אֻמּוֹת לִהְיוֹת נִרְדִּים בַּעֲבוֹדַת פֶּרֶךְ, אֲבָל רוֹאֶה אֲנִי שֶׁהֵם רְאוּיִים לְכָךְ (שמות רבה א'):</p>\n<p>אכן נדע הדבר SURELY THE THING IS KNOWN — Explain it in its literal sense: the fact that I have killed the Egyptian is known. A Midrashic explanation is: now there is known to me that matter about which I have been puzzled — <strong>how has Israel sinned more than all the seventy nations, that they should be oppressed by this crushing servitude? But now I see that they deserve this</strong> (Exodus Rabbah 1:30).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This proves the low moral level of Israel (they were more sinful than all seventy nations!).\nFurthermore in Exodus 3:11-12:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וַיֹּ֤אמֶר מֹשֶׁה֙ אֶל־הָ֣אֱלֹהִ֔ים מִ֣י אָנֹ֔כִי כִּ֥י אֵלֵ֖ךְ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה וְכִ֥י אוֹצִ֛יא אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מִמִּצְרָֽיִם׃</p>\n<p>But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and free the Israelites from Egypt?”</p>\n<p>וַיֹּ֙אמֶר֙ כִּֽי־אֶֽהְיֶ֣ה עִמָּ֔ךְ וְזֶה־לְּךָ֣ הָא֔וֹת כִּ֥י אָנֹכִ֖י שְׁלַחְתִּ֑יךָ בְּהוֹצִֽיאֲךָ֤ אֶת־הָעָם֙ מִמִּצְרַ֔יִם תַּֽעַבְדוּן֙ אֶת־הָ֣אֱלֹהִ֔ים עַ֖ל הָהָ֥ר הַזֶּֽה׃</p>\n<p>And [God] said, “I will be with you; that shall be your sign that it was I who sent you. And when you have freed the people from Egypt, you shall worship God at this mountain.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rashi explains there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...\nוכי אוציא את בני ישראל. וְאַף אִם חָשׁוּב אֲנִי, מַה זָּכוּ יִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁיֵּעָשֶׂה לָהֶם נֵס וְאוֹצִיאֵם מִמִּצְרַיִם?:</p>\n<p>וכי אוציא את בני ישראל AND THAT I SHOULD BRING FORTH THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL — and even if I am of sufficient importance for this, <strong>how has Israel merited that a miracle should be wrought for them and that I should bring them forth from Egypt?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דָּ\"אַ: כי אהיה עמך, וזה שֶׁתַּצְלִיחַ בִּשְׁלִיחוּתְךָ לך האות עַל הַבְטָחָה אַחֶרֶת, שֶׁאֲנִי מַבְטִיחֲךָ שֶׁכְּשֶׁתּוֹצִיאֵם מִמִּצְרַיִם תַּעַבְדוּן אוֹתִי עַל הָהָר הַזֶּה, שֶׁתְּקַבְּלוּ הַתּוֹרָה עָלָיו, <strong>וְהִיא הַזְּכוּת הָעוֹמֶדֶת לְיִשְׂרָאֵל</strong>. וְדֻגְמַת לָשׁוֹן זֶה מָצִינוּ: \"וְזֶה לְּךָ הָאוֹת אָכוֹל הַשָּׁנָה סָפִיחַ וְגוֹ'\" (ישעיהו ל\"ז), מַפָּלַת סַנְחֵרִיב תִּהְיֶה לְךָ אוֹת עַל הַבְטָחָה אַחֶרֶת, שֶׁאַרְצְכֶם חֲרֵבָה מִפֵּרוֹת וַאֲנִי אֲבָרֵךְ הַסְּפִיחִים:</p>\n<p>...Another explanation is: כי אהיה עמך FOR I WILL BE WITH THEE and thou wilt therefore succeed, וזה AND THIS — viz., the fact that thou wilt succeed in thy mission לך האות WILL BE A SIGN UNTO THEE with respect to another promise: <strong>for I promise thee that when thou hast brought them forth from Egypt ye will serve Me upon this mountain — i. e. that ye will receive the Torah upon it. This is the merit which is an advocate for Israel.</strong> ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In other words, the mechanism by which the judgement allowed the sinful nation to merit the exodus from Egypt is by promising that they will receive the Torah on Sinai, the means of rectifying their low moral state. This proves that the Torah was given as a result of the low moral state of the nation, supporting what the Ramban says that the mitzvot are intended as a means to an end.</p>\n<p>To further support this idea, from a simple high-level reading of Beshalach-Yitro: The low moral state of the nation was constantly demonstrated throughout parashat Beshalach, the parasha which immediately precedes the giving of the Torah. Bnei Israel were constantly complaining and not appreciating what G-d was doing for them, and in response to this G-d gives them the mitzvot, as it says in Kiddushin 30b:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"I have created the evil inclination, and I have created the torah as its antidote (tavlin)\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On the other hand there is also an aspect of the mitzvot which makes them an end rather than a means. This is perhaps expressed by the first interpretation of Rashi on Exodus 3:12, above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וְשֶׁשָּׁאַלְתָּ מַה זְּכוּת יֵשׁ לְיִשְׂרָאֵל שֶׁיֵּצְאוּ מִמִּצְרַיִם? דָּבָר גָּדוֹל יֵשׁ לִי עַל הוֹצָאָה זוֹ, שֶׁהֲרֵי עֲתִידִים לְקַבֵּל הַתּוֹרָה עַל הָהָר הַזֶּה לְסוֹף ג' חֳדָשִׁים שֶׁיֵּצְאוּ מִמִּצְרָיִם.</p>\n<p>And as regards thy question: What merit have the Israelites that they should go forth from Egypt? — <strong>I reply that I have a great purpose in this, My bringing them forth, for they are destined to accept the Torah upon this mountain at the expiration of three months after they leave Egypt (cf. Exodus Rabbah 3:4)</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Meaning, this speaks of G-d's \"great purpose\" for the mitzvot themselves, perhaps that in doing them Israel will bring about the rectification of the world as a whole, rather than the Torah as the \"merit\" of Israel (the second interpretation). On this level, the mitzvot are understood as logical actions which have a positive effect on reality, not just as something for \"tikkun hamidot.\"</p>\n<p>As the mitzvot bring about tikkun ha'olam, they bring about that people in general will know G-d and be thankful to G-d, as the Ramban says above, which is one of the prophecies of the Messianic times (Isaiah 11:9):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>לֹא־יָרֵ֥עוּ וְלֹֽא־יַשְׁחִ֖יתוּ בְּכׇל־הַ֣ר קׇדְשִׁ֑י כִּֽי־מָלְאָ֣ה הָאָ֗רֶץ דֵּעָה֙ אֶת־יְהֹוָ֔ה כַּמַּ֖יִם לַיָּ֥ם מְכַסִּֽים׃ {ס}</p>\n<p>In all of My sacred mount\nNothing evil or vile shall be done;\nFor the land shall be filled with devotion to  GOD\nAs water covers the sea.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As to how mentally disabled people have to do with the general tikkun (how they fit in with the non-\"Na'aseh Venishma\" paradigm for mitzvot, i.e. not as a rectification, which they perhaps don't need), I would say from personal experience there is much a person can learn from them, which can bring one to being thankful and knowing G-d, and thus they also participate in the general tikkun.</p>\n<p>If you say that nevertheless it is difficult for people with mental disabilities to achieve their purpose of knowing G-d and being thankful to G-d, given their mental handicap, there is this midrash (Dvarim Rabbah 11:10):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Moses said before the Holy One blessed be He: ‘Master of the universe, if you do not take me into the Land of Israel [i.e. where mitzvot are done], leave me like the beasts of the field, who eat greenery, drink water, live, and see the world. So, let my soul be like one of them.’</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this teaches that according to Judaism one should seek to  choose life over death, even if one has no hope of achieving anything in that life besides \"eating, drinking, and seeing the world.\" That life apparently still has meaning, otherwise why would Moses beg for it?</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>In parshas nitzavim in the seventh Aliya verse 19 it says,</p>\n<p>\"I invoke heaven and earth today as witnesses for you. I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse. You should choose life, in order that you and your offspring will live\" (<a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/parshah/torahreading.asp?aid=2495825&p=7&jewish=Nitzavim-Torah-Reading.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">translation from chabad.org)</a></p>\n<p>Choosing to fulfill Gd's commandments is equivalent to choosing life so much so that when saving life becomes necessary we can even break mitzvos to save someone's life. In choosing life this includes all aspects of healing the body. When a person has mental illness this is also part of healing the body and must be done so the person can continue to live and be able to choose to fulfill Gd's commandments.</p>\n\n\n",

Jews in Fostat, near Cairo, Egypt, in the 10th-12th centuries, regularly read the Ten Commandments after services [Jacob Mann, The Jews in Egypt and in Palestine under the Fatimid caliphs I, p 221].  The Baal Ha-Turim, from 14th-century Spain, said that people should say them privately before services. Rabbi Yosef Karo, from 16th-century Israel [Shulḥan Arukh, Orach Ḥayyim 1:5] confirms in his Code of Jewish Law that the ban only applies to public recitation during services.

We find that the birth of Yaakov’s children was influenced by the power of the evil eye. Leah had made a single comment in that she thanked the Lord for allowing her to have born a fourth son, i.e. more than the three sons out of twelve which she could expect to bear by right, and as a result of this comment she became subject to the power of the evil eye. Immediately after she had made this comment we read ותעמוד מלדת “she stopped giving birth.” The mere fact that she had said herself that she had received more than she was entitled to exposed her to the envy of others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Leah “became subject to the power of the evil eye” because the Torah says she thanked God for having allowed her to bear a fourth son, and immediately after that it says “she stopped giving birth.” [Genesis 29:35]</p>\n<p>How can thanking God for blessings received become, <em>ipso facto</em>, the reason for future misfortune?  Is the lesson here that thanks to God should be given quietly, out of everybody's earshot (if indeed Leah said it within somebody's earshot)?  Is this covered anywhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>It wasn't for thanking Hashem per se but rather the way she expressed it.

(There are other way the sentiment can be expressed without saying it, like \"I thank Hashem for the tremendous amount of Brocha he has given in my life. I do not know why he saw fit to give it to me\" etc)</p>\n<p>Leah calling him Yehuda because she received more than her portion was saying she received more than she deserved and causing scrutiny.</p>\n<p>Sorry I don't have the exact  mekoros offhand.

Mahu, offer a different explanation.\nAccording to Tosafot, one needs to add Al HaNisim in tefilla since\ntefilla is held in public and there is pirsumei nisa. Benching, which\nis recited privately in one’s home, does not have a pirsumei nisa\nelement to the same extent that tefilla does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The text of the Tosfos reads</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>מהו להזכיר של חנוכה בבהמ\"ז. בתפלה פשיטא ליה דמזכיר משום דתפלה בצבור\nהוא ואיכא פרסומי ניסא אבל בבהמ\"ז שבבית ליכא פרסומי ניסא כולי האי:</p>\n<p>What about mentioning Hanukkah in Grace after Meals. It's obvious that\nHanukkah must be mentioned in communal prayer because there is the\nelement of publicising the miracle but in Grace there is not so much\npublicity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Schwartz says further:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It seems that for Tosafot, even private prayer counts as pirsumei\nnisa. The conclusion of the Gemara that one can or perhaps should\nrecite Al HaNisim in Birkat HaMazon, indicates for Tosafot that\npirsumei nisa is not as it is commonly understood: a public\ndeclaration of the miracle. Instead, even a personal awareness of the\nneis can constitute pirsumei nisa. Pirsumei nisa is as much to oneself\nas it is to others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Jastrow has,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>פִּרְסֵם, פִּירְ׳ (enlargement of פָּרַס) to spread, divulge, publish;\nto uncover, expose.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>How can I understand the idea that “Pirsumei nisa is as much to oneself as it is to others.”</p>\n<p>related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/87589/lighting-hanukkah-candles-alone\">Lighting Hanukkah Candles Alone</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=40668&st=&pgnum=95&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pri Megadim in the Rosh Yosef (s.v. <em>v'hevei</em>)</a> disagrees with R' Schwartz' conclusion on whether Tosfos would say there is <em>pirsumei nisa</em> happening by the individual prayer. He writes that for Tosfos, <em>al hanisim</em> for the purpose of <em>pirsumei nisa</em> really does only apply by the communal prayer and not by the individual prayer. The Cheishek Shlomo (ibid, s.v. <em>mahu</em>) says that by Purim, we definitely would say <em>al hanisim</em> by bentching since it speaks about gathering together by a seudah per \"<em>mishpacha u'mishpacha</em>\" (Esther 9:28), while on Chanukkah we don't have that requirement.</p>\n\n\n",

[Now,] they were [certainly] righteous people, and if not for them, Torah and mitzvot would have been forgotten by the Jewish People.

We couldn't demand people go on a suicide mission. (This explains the line from the historians about the <em>mashuach milchama</em> giving the \"go-home\" talk before the battle.)

Because it continues to cling to the body until the day of death</strong>. It is wet on the surface and dry inside. In another passage, however, Scripture gives the name גרב to a boil which is wet on the surface and dry inside, as it is said (Deuteronomy 28:27) \"[The Lord will smite thee…] ובגרב ובחרס”, where גרב necessarily denotes a wet boil since חרס (identical with חרש, potsherd) denotes the dry species. But the explanation is as follows: חרס always denotes the dry skin disease, ילפח always the wet one; as to גרב it depends: When Scripture mentions גרב together with חרס it is calling a ילפת by the term ,גרב and when it mentions it (גרב) together with ילפת (as is the case here) it is calling a חרס by the term גרב. Thus is it explained in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bekhorot.41a.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bekhorot 41a</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, the term is used to imply something that \"hugs\" and encircles the object, in this case the skin condition \"clings\" to the body until the day of death.</p>\n<p>In a similar context, when the Shulchan Aruch details the things that invalidate an esrog - one of the disqualifying features are boils. Indeed in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.648.9?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 648:9</a> when introducing the notion of a חזזית (boil) the text writes two definitions in parenthesis - \"תרגום או <strong>ילפת</strong> או חזזן\".</p>\n<p>As the SA develops the concept in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.648.13?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">OC 648:13</a> the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sha%27arei_Teshuvah_on_Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Orach_Chayim.648.22?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shaarei Teshuva</a> explains why the word ילפת is an appropriate synonym bringing the Gemara in Bechoros cited above, and notes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וכן איתא בבכורות דף מ\"א ילפת זו חזזית המצרית ואמר ר\"ל שמלפפת והולכת כו' פירש\"י מלפפת דבוקה בו כדמתרגמינן ויחבר וילפף ע\"ש וענין דבוק בו...</p>\n<p>And similarly it is brought in Bechoros 41a the word \"ילפת\" - this is the boils that the Egyptians were afflicted with, and Reish Lakish says (why is it then called \"ילפת\"?) as it grabs [melapefes] continuously. <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rashi_on_Bekhorot.41a.7.6?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a> explains \"מלפפת\" as meaning clinging to it and hugging it. And this word over there is a matter of 'clinging' to something...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, in the quote you bring the word is to be understood as an 'clinging' or 'enveloping'</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Another example that expands this idea is the midrash in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Devarim_Rabbah.3.12?vhe=Midrash_Rabbah_--_TE&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Devarim Rabbah 3:12</a> which discusses how Moshe was given the Torah. It writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אָמַר רֵישׁ לָקִישׁ הַתּוֹרָה שֶׁנִּתְּנָה לְמשֶׁה, עוֹרָהּ שֶׁל אֵשׁ לְבָנָה, וּכְתוּבָה בְּאֵשׁ שְׁחוֹרָה, וַחֲתוּמָה בְּאֵשׁ, <strong>וּמְלֻפֶּפֶת בְּאֵשׁ</strong></p>\n<p>Resh Lakish said,\"The Torah was given to Moshe, its skin of white fire and written with black fire, and sealed in fire, and <strong>wrapped with fire</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Etz_Yosef_on_Devarim_Rabbah.3.12.10?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Etz Yosef</a> over there helps to translate the text by saying \"תרגום וחיבר ומלפף\" - that the fire was literally 'hugging' and enveloped the Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

Following\nthe Septuagint, the fourth-century Latin Vulgate translates ketonet\npassim as “tunicam polymitam”—a tunic woven with many threads, usually\ntaken to mean different colored threads. The early seventeenth-century\nEnglish King James Bible calls it a “coat of many colours.” Possibly\nbased on this, the once standard Jewish English translation, the 1917\nJewish Publication Society (JPS) Tanakh, calls it “a coat of many\ncolors.” Some traditional commentaries adopted this interpretation.\nThe influential eleventh-century Hebrew grammarian Jonah ibn Janach\n(Sefer HaShorashim, entry “pas” [p. 405]) assumes “passim” is the\nplural of “pas,” and based on Daniel and the Targum to Kings, “pas” is\na handbreadth; thus, the ketonet passim was a silk garment in which\neach handspan was a different color. Radak (1160-1235; Provence),\nbased on Daniel, derives that the garment was made of stripes of\nvarious colors. Ralbag (II Samuel 13:18) says that each handspan of\nthe garment was a different color, and it included many colors.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the well-known commentators who subscribe to the colours idea are the Radak and the Ralbag.</p>\n\n\n",

And so it says (in the verse) (Amos. 6:8), \"The Lord God hath sworn by Himself (בנפשׁו).\" And the word as written, נפשׁו, i.e. with waw, means his soul, viz. the swearer's; a man shall not lift up unto vanity nor swear deceitfully, but in truth and righteousness. And such swearing is a mitzvah to the fearers of the Name, as is said (in the text) (Deut. 6:13), \"And shalt swear by His Name\"; and another verse says (ibid. 10:20), \"The Lord thy God shalt thou fear, Him shalt thou serve, and to Him shalt thou cleave, and by His Name shalt thou swear.\" When these attributes (i.e. service, fear, adhesion) are thine, then by His Name shalt thou swear. And so it says (Jer. 4:2), \"And thou shalt swear 'As the Lord liveth,' in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness.\" (Sefaria translation my emphasis)</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

The Yaavetz, as @JoelK commented, likely based his knowledge on Sefer Yehudit, also known as the Book of Judith. This is likely for two reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Sefer Yehudit <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Book_of_Judith.1.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">appears to describe itself</a> as taking place during the Babylonian Exile, though there's a disagreement between scholars as to what sub-era of the exile it was referring to (for a summary of several different views, see Prof. Yehoshua Grintz's introduction to his edition of the book).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The Yaavetz seems to have had intimate knowledge of the Christian canon, which included Yehudit, among other books. One proof of this is right there in his answer, where he mentions that in the Book of the Wars of Chashmonaim, which is most likely either Maccabees I or Maccabees II (and most probable Maccabees I<sup>1</sup>), women are not described as key factors in the causation of the miracle of Chanukah. Maccabees during the Yaavetz's time had <a href=\"https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%A1%D7%A4%D7%A8_%D7%9E%D7%A7%D7%91%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%90%27#%D7%9E%D7%94%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA\" rel=\"noreferrer\">not yet been translated into Hebrew</a>, and it was also <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon#Table\" rel=\"noreferrer\">part of the Catholic canon</a>. Another piece of evidence is from a letter he sent to the Vaad Arba Aratzot in 1757<sup>2</sup> in which he references specific chapters in Luke and Matthew (his seemingly respectful mannerism actually hid deep sarcasm, but he clearly knew what he was talking about).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For these reasons, it seems very likely that the Yaavetz had read Yehudit and that was how he reached his conclusions about the time of the tale. It should be noted that Sefer Yehudit is also mentioned in Shalshelet Hakabbalah. He <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6618&pgnum=169\" rel=\"noreferrer\">seemed to think</a> that the story took place in the early days of the Greeks and Chazal <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=6618&pgnum=63\" rel=\"noreferrer\">decided</a> to use it as a basis for eating dairy products on Chanukah, i.e., they decided to remember those events together with events that are directly related to the Chanukah story.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Because Maccabees II is basically a biography of Yehudah the Maccabee, whilst Maccabees I describes the campaigns of several leaders from the House of Chashmonai, hence, perhaps, \"Wars of Chashmonaim\" in plural.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Pinkas Vaad Arba Aratzot, pp. 421-422, compiled by Yisrael Halperin.</p>\n\n\n",

In  an <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=11643&st=&pgnum=204\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">older edition</a> of the book from 5347, the word is אקוילה, which refers to Aquila of Sinope, known in Jewish sources as עקילס, who translated the Torah into Greek in the time of Rabbi Yehoshua and Rabbi Eliezer. And I made a mistake in my above English translation: Ibn Yachya meant \"the city of Isola in Pontos\". According to Avraham David in his PhD (מפעלו ההיסטוריוגרפי של גדליה אבן יחיא בעל שלשלת הקבלה), pp. 50-51, Ibn Yachya's source in this case was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Guevara\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antonio de Guevara</a>'s <em>Familiar Epistles</em>, where it <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/bim_early-english-books-1475-1640_the-familiar-epistles-of_guevara-antonio-de-bp_1575/page/396/mode/2up?q=bible\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">says</a> (in a 16th century English translation):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"The translation of Abemiziel (=Yonatan b. Uziel) beeyng condemned by the common consent of the Jewes, it came to passe in the first yeare of the sayde Emperor Traian, a certane greate and famous heathen Priest, borne in the Isle of Pont, named Aquile, did convert himselfe to the lawe of Moyses, the which conuersion (=conversion) hee did not performe of conscience to saue (=save) his soule, but to obtaine in mariage an excellent fayre Jewishe woman, with whome he was farre inflamed. And for that this Aquile, was a man very skilfull in the Greeke and Hebrewe tongues, hee founde no better opportunitie more aptly to shewe his spirite, than to take in hande the translation of all the holy Scripture, out of Hebrewe into Greeke.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It was apparently Ibn Yachya's idea to identify Onkelos with Aquila, per the version of Aquila's life brought by de Guevara, and the similarities between Onkelos and Aquila's lives according to Jewish sources (and as we know, this identification has been proposed by many others, particularly modern scholars).</p>\n<p>Regarding \"the city of Isola in Pontos\" (העיר איסולה בפונטו), I think the word city may be a printing error even in the older edition, and perhaps the entire phrase is faulty. The phrase likely refers to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontine_Islands\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pontine Islands</a>, an archipelago not far from Italy. While they had been abandoned by the time Ibn Yachya was alive, given that he was Italian, it's not a stretch to imagine that he was familiar with these islands (the other possibility, that it's a reference to Pontos in what is now Turkey, seems unlikely, as Pontos is a region, not an island). Furthermore, <em>Isola Pontine</em> in Italian literarily means \"Pontine Islands\". The original phrase was probably something like האי איסולה פונטו (the isle Isola Pontine).</p>\n<p>But why did de Guevara think Aquila was from the Pontine Islands (which apparently led to Ibn Yachya holding this belief as well)?<sup>1</sup> Aquila is usually referred to today as Aquilla of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinop,_Turkey\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sinope</a>, once the capital of the kingdom of the <strong>land</strong> of Pontos. However, in some ancient sources, Aquila was called <em>Aqula Ponticus</em> in Latin (e.g., Ireneus, <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/thirdbookstirena00irenuoft/page/92/mode/2up\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Adversus Hieresies</em>, 3:21:1</a>) or <em>Ἀκύλας ὁ Ποντικός</em> (Akulas of Pontikos) in Greek (e.g., Eusebius, <a href=\"https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=5.8.10&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0640\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><em>Ecclesiastical History</em>, 5:8:10</a>), meaning: Aquila of Pontos. This seems to have led de Guevara (though perhaps he based himself off of another source) to interpret Aquila's place of origin as the Pontine Islands, rather than Pontos.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Though it's possible that Ibn Yachya did think of Pontos itself, but misunderstood de Guevara's reference to \"the Isle of Pont\" (in whichever language he read it; de Guevara's books were translated into multiple European languages) and did indeed think he meant a city called Isola in Pontos.</p>\n<p><sup>2</sup> Which does make more sense in light of Midrash Tanchuma (Buber), <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma_Buber%2C_Mishpatim.3.1?vhe=hebrew%7CMidrash_Tanhuma_haKadum_veHaYashan,_S._Buber,_1885&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpatim 3:1</a>/Tanchuma <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Midrash_Tanchuma%2C_Mishpatim.5.1?vhe=hebrew%7CMidrash_Tanchuma_--_Torat_Emet&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishpatim 5:1</a> which states that Aquila was Hadrian's nephew; Hadrian's family <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadrian#:%7E:text=the%20Aeli%20Hadriani%2C%20came%20from%20the%20town%20of%20Hadria%20in%20eastern%20Italy.\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">originated</a> in Italy.</p>\n\n\n",

One theory is that he does research on you before you come in, aka, hot reading.

In the last two sets, repetition means time. By the sommelier and baker, Yosef says that the three branches are three days (Genesis 40:12) and the three baskets are three days (40:18): the events he describes will happen then. By Pharaoh's dreams, the seven cows or the seven ears of corn are seven years (41:26), and again the events will happen after that time.<br />\nBut Yosef's second dream also had repetition: eleven stars, and the sun and the moon. I know that Yaakov Avinu interpreted that as having to do with eleven brothers and Yosef's father and his \"mother\". But I wonder if it might also have to do with time. Yosef was 17 years old (37:2), and in 11+2 years he'd be thirty, which is how old he was (41:46) when Pharaoh appointed him over Egypt and everyone bowed to him (not his brothers, not for several more years). Also, he <em>should</em> have been appointed two years earlier, after just eleven years, as the Midrash says.<br />\nHis first dream doesn't mention numbers so I wouldn't know what to do with it.<br />\nAnyhow, does this idea appear anywhere?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<h2>בָּרוּךְ שֶׁכִּוַּנְתָּ</h2>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=30801&st=&pgnum=100&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">צרור המור</a> provides this explanation, albeit with some variations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>And behold Hashem showed Yosef two things [in the second dream]: one the fulfillment of what he saw in the first dream, second  the number of years in which his domination will come into fruition. To explain, in the first dream he saw his domination and its cause. In this dream he saw the timing, which comes from the sun and moon. This is why the verse specifically singles out the sun and moon but leaves the eleven stars general. <strong>So this dream is coming to inform Yosef that the peace, ruling, and interpretation of the dream will be after thirteen years -- equal to the two luminaries plus the eleven stars.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/avKO8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/avKO8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n",

He explains that technically, yes, David should have gone to where Uriah was buried, but according to the Abarbanel, the sin was not made public, so taking a minyan to Uriah's grave - especially if it was, as at least one person has <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=61438&pgnum=225\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">suggested</a>, near the battlefield in Ammon - would have certainly made it public and would have been a major desecration of Hashem's name (chillul Hashem).

Rav Yehoshua who died about sixty years afterwards was unwilling to pasken on a machlokes between Beis Shamal and Beis Hillel saying he was unworthy (Yevomos 15B). The Gemora also mentions Rav Akiva and other Tannaim who died about sixty five years after the destruction of the second Beis Hamakdush discussing  with Rav Dosa Ben Horkonos about whether the halacha is like Beis Shamai or Beis Hillel about  Tzoras HaBas. He told them  that his younger  brother Yonasan Ben Horkonos  is a Talmid of Beis Shamal and he was the one who gave the pask to allow it but they should not argue with him  due to him greatness in learning (they did anyway)  (Yevomos 16A) Etc.</p>\n<p>Presumably Beis Shamai closed after the Bas KKol said that Halacha is like Beis Hillel (Eiruvin 13B) Although  there is one opinion in the Gemara (see below) that even after the Bas Kol, Beis Shamai continued to follow their own rulings they probably did not get new Talmidim afterwards. So  by default everyone joined Beis Hillel.</p>\n<p>The Gemora does not say when that happened but it happened early enough in time that by the first generation of Amoriam (Rav and Shmuel) they were no longer certain about whether Beis Shamai went in accordance with their own rulings or not (Yevomos 14a-the Gemora concludes that they did)</p>\n<p>Being that Rav and Shmuel died about two hundred years after the destruction of the second Beis Hamakdush and one hundred and forty years after Rav Yeshoua and Rav Akiva it must have happened soon after the death of Rav Akiva, Rav Yeshoua and that generation of Tannaim. Otherwise by the first generation of Amoraim they still would have been familiar with the practices of  Beis Shamai as they would have been recent enough history</p>\n<p>(Timelines in this answer are estimated and not exact)</p>\n\n\n",

For the name \"Yaakov\" indicates the depressed mood, in which a failed person feels dependent on others, and the sense of \"lameness/crippling\" after the events. And instead of leading the events he is dragged after them. But the true Jew feels depressed only as long as he does not know what he must do. Only two things can bring a righteous Jew to depression: 1) A sense of guilt, and 2) Doubt as to what he should do, not what might happen to him. As long as Yaakov is in doubt and feels that he is not allowed to send Binyamin, he appears as \"Yaakov.\" But as soon as he realizes the absolute necessity for this, and he comes to the realisation that Binyamin's life will be in danger, whether he goes with his brother or stays at home, Yaakov settles down and becomes stronger within himself and becomes \"Yisrael.\" Since the Jew recognises that there is no human power that can help him, he says to himself: \"Leave it all to Hashem\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.37.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 37:5</a>) - What is too heavy for you to bear alone, will \"roll\" on to Hashem. What is difficult to do but should not be avoided, the Jew will do with renewed vigour and courage; For where the human hand will be shortened, that is where the dominion of G-d begins, as the name \"Yisrael\" indicates. That is why Yisrael has no other complaint other than to prove to his sons that they unnecessarily mentioned to the Egyptian tyrant that they had another younger brother at home.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, Rav Hirsch notes that this represented a watershed moment in Yaakov's development. It demonstrated a strengthening of faith on the part of Yaakov. Whereas previously he was perhaps \"held back\" (at least on his level), when he realised that he could let Binyamin go as it is dangerous either way, there is now a paradigm shift as Yaakov leaves it all in the hands of Hashem and therefore now deserves the appellation \"Yisrael\".</p>\n\n\n",

Evidently because of the importance that he saw in this act of public service, he named one of his sons Ner. In turn, Ner seems to have wanted to also preserve memory of this service, and so named his son Avner. In a way, Avner fulfilled his name by giving several years of his life to public service as a military general.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Jumping elephants",
    "content": "# Jumping elephants\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>There has been a conflict for a while between Orthodox Jews, some of them gedolim, concerning works by a certain author. One of the points of conflict is something he said about a Tosefos in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Kiddushin.26a.1?lang=bi&with=Tosafot&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Kiddushin 25b</a>, concerning how to do a kinyan (acquisition) on very large animals.\nRav Meshulam in Tosefos suggests that an elephant (פיל) can be acquired by getting it to jump, which would count as a \"hagbahah\" - lifting.<br />\nThis author said that Tosefos is wrong, because it is known that <a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/elephants-can-t-jump-and-here-s-why\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">elephants cannot jump</a>. They didn't know, because there were no elephants in their area. Others took strong umbrage to this suggestion.<br />\nFirst of all, my son suggests that an elephant probably could jump if you put it in a swimming pool, or in a liquid with even higher specific gravity (mercury? :( ). I'm assuming this kinyan would also work in a swimming pool.<br />\nBut that is really beside the point. Anyone who has learned Tosefos knows that their whole presentation is to gather all the available information - gemara, Tosefta, Yerushalmi, piyutim, whatever they have - and <em>suggest as many answers as fit with all the evidence</em>, and try to work each of them out. They do this all the time. They don't generally concern themselves over which answer is <em>the</em> right one, and they are perfectly comfortable with suggesting answers that contradict one another. They find the ways to fit the information they have.<br />\nJust as one example among very many, I just did a Tosefos in Menachos Perek 6 that was trying to work out which types of grain and produce can be used for different korbonos. They quote several gemaras, and then they say, Well, if the produce of these areas (valleys, mountains,...) is better than the produce of these areas, then __ is pshat. If it's worse, then __ is pshat.<br />\nThey aren't in Israel and don't claim to know which it is, and it doesn't worry them at all. Not their job.<br />\nThe same is true here. It is silly to say that they're \"wrong\"; if their answer doesn't work for elephants, it might work for lions - \"פיל\" is a placeholder for \"animal you can't lift\".<br />\nAnd on the flip side, if you say, How dare you say that Tosefos is \"wrong\" about elephants, if Tosefos says it then it must be true! - that seems silly to me too. They are not <em>saying</em> anything about elephants - <em>they don't do that</em>, they're talking about what works in the gemara.<br />\nCould someone explain this conflict to me? It seems to have caused division and discord, and I think both sides are taking something out of Tosefos which was never there.</p>\n<p>Addendum: As I mentioned there, I think <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/127964/greek-chi-and-anointment\">this discussion</a> on the Greek letter chi might be relevant.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I understood that the conflict involved the general attitude of the author. This is something subjective by nature, but those who took umbrage saw in the author cavalier manner and flippant dismissal of the words of Tosafos, disregard for our sages.</p>\n<p>Another example of this is that there is a prevalent manner of speech in the world of academia that does not sit well with the non-secular non-modern segment of Orthodoxy. For example, when addressing Rishonim and Achronim, their last names are used in the same manner as one would address a layman (i.e. Grossman takes issue with Abarbanel's stance...)</p>\n<p>Herein lies the conflict: The infamous author and his ilk talk about Tosafos with the cold unfeeling manner of academia, without any show of the respect we are used seeing in Sefarim. When a Rishon or Achron refer to a sage, they use titles like רבינו, מורינו, הרה\"ג and the like. When arguing with a sage of a previous generation, there is generally a show of respect, using such phrases as לולי דמיסתפינא, במחילת כבוד תורתו and the like. It is a great turnoff when some guy who studies zoology flatly declares Tos. as being \"wrong\", with the same confidence and uncaring attitude as he would disregard the same statement of a child. I am pretty sure that if he would have shown the respect mentioned above, he would not have gotten the slack that he did. It's ok to ask a question, and to suggest a way to resolve the question, such as you did with your son, but it has to be done respectfully.</p>\n<p>(As to your suggestion that this can be resolved because it is clear that Tos. was not sure about everything, I disagree, as you showed, Tos. will be clear if they do not know something. I will agree, however, that it is possible that Tos. was just suggesting a theoretical option, which is applicable in other cases.)</p>\n\n\n",

It is said that Jerome corresponded with Jewish sages of his time (Rav Ashi perhaps?) if anyone can expand in this I would greatly appreciate it.</p>\n<p>Happy Chanukah 🕎</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>To my knowledge, save for some of Jesus's (who may or may not have been the Jesus of the NT) students and students of students, none of the early Christians are mentioned by name in Chazalic sources, and the same goes for the Church Fathers. A few debates between sages and anonymous Christians are recorded, though they are sometimes referred to as \"minai\" (heretics). For example, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Sanhedrin.37a.6?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 37a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And this is like an incident involving Rav Kahana, as a certain heretic said to Rav Kahana: You say that it is permitted for a menstruating woman to seclude herself with a man, i.e., her husband. Is it possible to set fire to chips of kindling and not have them blaze and burn? How can the couple be relied upon not to engage in sexual intercourse? Rav Kahana said to him: The Torah testifies concerning us that we are “set about with lilies,” as the Jewish people do not breach even a fence made of lilies.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Other mentions include <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.500.4?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 500:4</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.4a.11-14?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 4a</a>, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.992.31?vhe=Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni on Nach 992:31</a> and <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.116a.11-116b.2?vhe=William_Davidson_Edition_-_Vocalized_Aramaic&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 116</a>.</p>\n<p>But more commonly, the censor changed it to \"Tzdoki\" (we can easily tell that these \"tzodkim\" are not so for two reasons: a. The context shows us that these people were not Jewish. b. The term is usually used with regards to debates that took place long after the destruction of the Temple and the fall from prominence of the Sadduceans). For example (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Shabbat.88a.9-88b.1?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shabbat 88</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"a heretic saw that Rava was immersed in studying halakha, and his fingers were beneath his leg and he was squeezing them, and his fingers were spurting blood. Rava did not notice that he was bleeding because he was engrossed in study. The heretic said to Rava: You impulsive nation, who accorded precedence to your mouths over your ears. You still bear your impulsiveness, as you act without thinking. You should listen first. Then, if you are capable of fulfilling the commands, accept them. And if not, do not accept them. He said to him: About us, who proceed wholeheartedly and with integrity, it is written: “The integrity of the upright will guide them” (Proverbs 11:3), whereas about those people who walk in deceit, it is written at the end of the same verse: “And the perverseness of the faithless will destroy them.”\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For more instances, see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/search?q=%D7%94%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90%20%D7%A6%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A7%D7%99&tab=text&tpathFilters=Talmud%7CMidrash%7CKabbalah%2FHechalot%20Rabbati%7CKabbalah%2FZohar%7CTargum&tvar=1&tsort=relevance&svar=1&ssort=relevance\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>But in one instance, the Talmud names one of the minim (Christians) who came into contact with Rabbi Abahu - \"Yaakov Minai (the heretic)\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Avodah_Zarah.28a.11?vhe=Wikisource_Talmud_Bavli&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avodah Zara 28a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But Rabbi Abbahu was an important person, and yet Ya’akov the heretic placed upon his leg a salve that was actually a poison...\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Here's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_the_Heretic\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">some discussion</a> on this person.</p>\n<p>It is likely that at least some of these Christians were well-known figures, considering the usage of the term \"ההוא מינאי\", as though referring to a particular Christian well-known to everyone (Prof. Shmuel Krauss wrote similarly <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1449915?seq=11#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> on the \"Notzrim\"). It is entirely possible that some explicit mentions of these Christians did exist and were censored by the Church, because typically the sages managed to wipe the floor with these guys, so to speak. That might also explain why Yaakov is named, being that he managed to poison Rabbi Abahu.</p>\n<p>However, we should also bear in mind that it was halachically forbidden for Jews to teach non-Jews (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Chagigah.13a.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chagigah 13a</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And Rabbi Ami said further: The words of Torah may not be transmitted to a gentile, as it is stated: “He has not dealt so with any nation, and as for His ordinances, they have not known them”.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And it seems that for this reason, Jerome wrote the following about his Jewish teacher in his <a href=\"https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/3001084.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">84th epistle</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"What trouble and expense it cost me to get Baraninas<sup>1</sup> to teach me under cover of night. For by his fear of the Jews he presented to me in his own person a second edition of Nicodemus.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Therefore, it is equally feasible that the sages themselves decided not to record their encounters with the Christians, or at least not in great detail.</p>\n<p>Note: I did a quick search in later sources and so far have not seen any mention of such encounters by later rabbis. There were some rabbis who did bring the Church Fathers in their commentaries, such as the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Abarbanel_on_Joshua%2C_Introduction.35?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Abarbanel</a> and Shadal. Consider this section of the answer as more of a WIP as I continue looking for other sources.</p>\n<p>Note 2: The Church Fathers themselves did name some of the Jews they came in contact with - Origen with Rabbi Hillel, son of Rabbi Yehudah Ha'Nasi, Jerome with \"Bar Chaninah\", Justin Martyr with \"Trypho\" and \"Mnesias\", and so forth. However, most of the time, they merely referred to them as \"the Jews\" or \"the Hebrews\". It seems that for various reasons, they, too, did not see the need to record all of the names of the people they came in contact with.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Moritz Rahmer <a href=\"https://books.google.co.il/books?id=gdg7AAAAcAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q=bar&f=false\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">thought</a> he may be identified with Rabbi Chama bar Chaninah. Why any sage would have willingly risked his life to teach a Christian is entirely unclear to me, although obviously there were positive results in the case of Jerome's attitude towards Jews and Jewish tradition.</p>\n\n\n",

This derives from the root שחת, which carries meanings like decay, destruction, corruption; the מ of משחת is part of the form of the noun (ie. there are nouns formed from root letters XYZ that look like miXYaZ, where in this case, X=Sh, Y=Ḥ, and Z=T). There is another root משח that means anoint, and a noun משחה <em>MIShḤA</em>/<em>MOShḤA</em> that in certain forms (namely, in construct form, when it means \"anointing of\") becomes משחת (ie. the same consonantal form as in Isaiah 52:14; cf. <a href=\"https://www.mgketer.org/tanach/2/30/25\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Ex 30:25</a> and many others), but the context is not right for that reading in Isaiah 52:14. Although משחת doesn't appear again in Tanakh with the meaning of our verse, the root שחת appears with this meaning many times (eg. Gen 6:11-13, 13:10, Ex 32:7, Deut 9:12, 32:5, ...). However, ignoring the printed vowels, the consonantal text could also be read as <em>MUShShAḤTA</em>, which would mean \"you were anointed\", or <em>MOShḤAT</em>, which would mean \"marred\" (as a participle, cf. <a href=\"https://www.mgketer.org/tanach/26/1/14\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Malachi 1:14</a>).</p>\n<p>The correct word in the Septuagint to look at is ἀδοξήσει <em>adoksēsei</em>, and the phrase is translated (in <a href=\"http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/33-esaias-nets.pdf\" rel=\"noreferrer\">NETS</a>) as \"so shall your appearance be without glory from men\" or \"so shall your appearance be held in no esteem by men\" (and translated in your link as \"shall be despised\").</p>\n<p>Targum Yonatan on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Isaiah.52.14?lang=bi&p2=Targum_Jonathan_on_Isaiah.52.14&lang2=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this verse</a> has the text דַהֲוָה חֲשִׁיךְ בֵּינֵי עַמְמַיָא חֶזְוֵהוֹן, with the key word חשיך. This has meanings of luckless, poor, dark (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jastrow%2C_%D7%97%D6%B2%D7%A9%D6%B4%D7%81%D7%99%D7%9A%D6%B0.1\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Jastrow</a>).</p>\n<p>The appropriate location of the Great Isaiah Scroll can be seen <a href=\"https://www.ao.net/%7Efmoeller/qum-44.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. The fourth word of the second line is משחתי, which is our word with an extra letter on the end. This letter might make the marring plural, without changing the meaning, or make the word mean \"be marred\" (as translated <a href=\"http://dss.collections.imj.org.il/chapters_pg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ao.net/%7Efmoeller/qa-tran.htm\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>) — but as I mentioned above, this latter is already a possible reading of the Masoretic consonantal text as well, so I don't see anything new here. The word could also be read as <em>MAShAḤTI</em>, which means \"I anointed\", but this is difficult to understand in context.</p>\n<p>In short, I don't see anything special about the Great Isaiah Scroll that points to anointing more than the Masoretic text does. Caveat: I don't have the book you're quoting, so I can't check for more details. But without more details, I don't find her comments persuasive.</p>\n\n\n",

It also seems to have contradictory implications as to what should be learned first; in one place the author writes regarding Chazal: \"Their efforts were <strong>first</strong> spent on determining the general principles of judgment, to make clear what is permitted and what is forbidden. <strong>Afterwards,</strong> they busied and strove to clarify their active obligations and inward duties...\".\nLater, however, he writes: \"The thinking, intelligent man, when he reads [the Torah] and understands it clearly, will divide it into three divisions. The first is the knowledge of fine spiritual themes, namely, the inner wisdom, such as the duties of the heart, the discipline of the soul and will obligate his soul on them always. <strong>Afterwards,</strong> he will select the second portion, namely, the practical duties of the limbs, doing each one in its proper time and place.\" (Translation from Sefaria)\nIs there a way to resolve this apparent contradiction? It seems that common practice in Orthodox Jewish circles is to study classical halacha first. Is that correct? Or, in practical terms, should I first study Shulchan Aruch or a Chovos Halevavos?\nIf possible, please provide sources (those other R.

That a child will learn Torah and Mikra first and would be given additional education with philosophy, grammar, poetry and mussar to make sense of Mikra. It's during that phase that learning Chovot HaLevavot would come in. Then they would be taught Mishnah followed by Gemara.</p>\n<p>Note: The OP is asking about the Shulchan Arukh but Chovot HaLevavot predates the Shulchan Arukh by hundreds of years, and predates the Rambam's Mishneh Torah as well. It would seem to me that if one wanted to put in the Shulchan Arukh as part of the study structure listed above then it would be using Alfasi's works as part of the dedicated Talmud study typically reserved for adulthood.</p>\n\n\n",

In addition, since the concept of shepherding was seen as a blasphemous occupation in Egypt, Yosef suggested that they also call themselves breeders of livestock so that it implies they handle other domesticated animals that were not worshipped, to detract from their job as shepherds allowing them to slip more readily under the radar.</p>\n<p>It is also worth noting the <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rabbeinu_Bahya%2C_Bereshit.46.32.1-2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbeinu Bachaye</a></strong> who says that the naming of both occupations served a dual purpose. By saying they were shepherds could imply they were employed by others, but by also saying they were cattleman it implies that there were wealthy in that it was a very profitable trade. Namely the gain from milk, wool etc as well as being not too labour intensive meaning they would not become engaged in dishonest and sinful pursuits. Secondly the reference to shepherds was also with one mind on the fact that this marked the beginning of the exile, and they wanted future generations to know despite living in a place where the country worshipped sheep, they chose an occupation which demonstrates the relative limitation and ungodly nature of such animals.</p>\n<p>With this in mind we can understand the ensuing conversation. Yosef goes on to say that when Pharoah ask you about your occupation, you should answer that you are cattlemen (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.46.33-34?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">46:33-34</a>). As he says there is a genuine concern that they would be ostracised as sheep were an Egyptian deity. <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.46.34.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a></strong> notes that Yosef was worried that his brothers would likely be given senior roles in Pharoah's palace and they should specifically say they were cattleman so that it would avoid a situation where Yosef's detractors could use something against him to reduce his status.</p>\n<p>However, when the brothers come face-to-face with Pharoah (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.3?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">47:3</a>) they say they are shepherds. According to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Davar_on_Genesis.47.3.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netziv</a> this was a calculated response. He notes that rather than call themselves cattlemen they reverted to saying they were shepherds in order to preserve a sense of honour and to avoid any sort of boasting on their part. They were merely answering Pharoah's question as they heard it, and to answer that they were cattleman, would be perceived in a way in which they would appear as gloating before the king which would not reflect well. <strong>Rav Shimshon Raphael Hirsch</strong> says similarly, that Yoseph left to their discretion the possibility of saying \"Cattleman\", but they were not ashamed of their work and said openly: \"Shepherds\".</p>\n<p>Pharoah's response (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">47:6</a>) of putting them in charge of his livestock (שָׂרֵ֥י מִקְנֶ֖ה) is actually a point of contention amongst the commentaries. <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Rashi_on_Genesis.47.6.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi</a></strong> says expressly this is a reference to looking after his sheep. Whereas <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Ibn_Ezra_on_Genesis.47.6.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ibn Ezra</a></strong> says it is a reference to horses and mules. Similarly, <strong><a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.47.6?vhe=Tanach_with_Ta%27amei_Hamikra&lang=bi&aliyot=0&p2=Chizkuni%2C_Genesis.47.6.3&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chizkuni</a></strong> says that Pharoah was most interested in camels, mules and horses.</p>\n\n\n",

Rather it is following the paradigm that was already established in creation in the preceding days.</p>\n<p>Like is discussed in many kabbalistic books, like Sefer Yetzirah, Otiot d'Rabbi Akiva and elsewhere, the language of the Torah, particularly in the first parsha of the first book is written with multiple layers of meaning and conveys many concepts that form the basis and foundation of our faith. The study of the various methods and rules that pertain to this type of understanding is sometimes referred to as <em><strong>Dikduk</strong></em>, <em>the rules of Grammar</em>.</p>\n<p>This deceptively simple expression implies that without proper application of all these various methods, which includes Crowns, Trop, Nekudot, Letters, Verb form and structure and much more, it is impossible to truly understanding the plain meaning of the text.</p>\n<p>With this brief introduction, the first thing to point out is that the two expressions being asked about, צלמו and דמות are actually referring to two names of G-d used in the Torah. The first, צלמו, is explicit and is actually the name intended when referring to אל עליון in the beginning of the Amidah prayer. That like is taught in Sefer HaShemot from Rabbi Moshe Zacuto, עליון is actually the numerical (<em>gematria</em>) value of צלמו.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that gematria (numerical quantification, like the English derivation of <em>Cipher</em>) is another method contained within the rules of grammar mentioned previously like is stated explicitly in Sefer Yetzirah 1:1. The other two general categories mentioned pertain to letter formation and structure (as in <em>Safrut</em>) and pronunciation, both with and without sound, like in Sipur.</p>\n<p>The second expression, דמות, requires a more complex permutation to understand to which name of G-d it is referring.</p>\n<p>Another principle within the field of grammar is what is called in Hebrew, the <em>Miluy</em> (מלוי). It is the pronunciation of the individual letter name.</p>\n<p>In trying to conceive of the concept of Miluy in relation to the individual letter, it is best to view this from the first letter used in all of creation, namely the letter Yud (י). Yud in the Miluy is (יו״ד).</p>\n<p>It illustrates through the form of the letters of the Miluy another level of understanding of what is taught in the beginning of the Torah.</p>\n<p>That the beginning of creation starts with Nekudah (Point, as in singularity and also what is referred to as unmeasured time, זמן בלתי משוער), proceeds to Kav (Line which includes the idea of linear time זמן משוער, past, present and future) and matures into Shetach (Field which is the beginning of space or place, מקום).</p>\n<p>In other Torah nomenclature, this is called World עולם, Year שנה (or Change) and Soul נפש, like is found in Bereshit 15:17 and Shemot 19:18 and 20:14 (עש״ן) and in the writings of the Chida (Midbar Kedmot) as the Fangs of the Serpent (עטיו של נחש) because it was the beginning of the concealment of G-d through the creation of the world or universe.</p>\n<p>The last two letters of the word דמות form one of the variants of the Miluy of the last letter of the Aleph-Beit, namely Tav (ת). Its Miluy in this variant is תו. The reversal of direction in this case relates to the letter transformation taught by Yaacov Avinu, which is At-Bash (א׳ת-ב׳ש).</p>\n<p>And so the expression, דמות, is actually referring to the word אדם. And this word refers to G-d's name (יהוה) like is taught by Rabbi Menachem Azariya of Fano in his Sefer Kanfei Yonah which explains the source for the name of the first human being (Adam) meaning דומה לעליון (<em><strong>Similar to Above</strong></em> Please note the specific reference to Elyon previously) just as the text of the Torah states: בְּצַלְמֵנוּ כִּדְמוּתֵנוּ. The Kanfei Yonah points out that this is based upon the Gematria value of the Trop which appears over the letter Dalet in the word ולאדם (a value of 26, like יהוה) in Bereshit 2:20.</p>\n<p>So what is being referenced is actually two of G-d's names (צלמו and יהוה). And these two names are the source for the division within Humans between male and female, husband and wife.</p>\n<p>That based upon the form and structure of the letters of these two names, is found the form and structure of the human male and female that pertain to procreation. This is in keeping with the teaching of both Rabbi Moshe Kordevero in Sefer Pardes Rimonim and also Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKaneh in Sefer Temunah.</p>\n<p>And the final element of your question relates to the change of the name relating to the Human female from a name possessing four letters to that of three (from צלמו to צלם).</p>\n<p>This change is in keeping with the paradigm already established on day four of creation and the reduction of one of the two great(and equal)  sources of light (the sun and the moon). In keeping with that paradigm, the letter Vav from צלמו was concealed leaving it with only three letters. So while the name of G-d pertaining to the wife possessed only three revealed letters, the name pertaining to the husband possessed four.</p>\n<p>It should also be noted that these letters correspond to the number of Patriarchs and Matriarchs and that the union of these two names means \"He commands Milah.\" (צוה מילה)</p>\n<p>So to recap, nothing went wrong with the Divine plan and in fact, with careful reading it is understood to have executed perfectly.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/8165/showrashi/true#v26\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rashi explains</a> that even though the malachim could not actually create Adam and he was not in their image, Hashem used this to teach a lesson in proper behavior.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Let us make man: Even though they [the angels] did not assist Him in\nHis creation, and there is an opportunity for the heretics to rebel\n(to misconstrue the plural as a basis for their heresies), Scripture\ndid not hesitate to teach proper conduct and the trait of humility,\nthat a great person should consult with and receive permission from a\nsmaller one.

And when they placed it there they would say: “The earth and all that fills it is God’s, the world and all that inhabit it” (Psalms 24:1).

How do they compare to the <em>original</em> original texts (manuscripts)? I.e., are even the hardcover editions found in synagogues \"full of errors\"? If not full, aren't there pretty much guaranteed to be mistakes in transcriptions along the way? If so, how are these \"mistakes\" conceptualized of in Judaism? If the texts are known to have transcription mistakes/inconsistencies, wouldn't that mean that the Word is evolving or not quite the original Word? How is that conceptualized / rationalized or otherwise handled in Judaism?</li>\n<li><strong>How do you arrive at a \"canonical\" text in Judaism?</strong> Given that there are many versions of texts, such as found <a href=\"https://github.com/NLPH/NLPH_Resources#structured-corpora\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">in this list on GitHub</a> or in the <a href=\"https://github.com/Sefaria/Sefaria-Export/tree/master/json/Talmud/Bavli/Seder%20Kodashim/Bekhorot/Hebrew\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sefaria exports like this</a> <code>Seder Kodashim - Bekhorot</code> which has 2 versions, but some books have 3 or 4+ versions.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The reason I ask is, it seems that the Sefaria collection of texts, beyond being extremely messy, is guaranteed to be full of errors in one way or another.

I would like to obtain a high quality Unicode (i.e. standard digital text-based) copy of all the books in Sefaria, but they don't look to have a high quality bar (yet?), so I'm not sure how they are perceived in the Jewish community in general. Though I can see them being useful as a \"rough draft / introduction\" to the texts for free, I don't know if they would live up to the standard of quality which I imagine is required in Judaism in some way or another. Then if I go and try and \"clean up\" the Sefaria texts (as per that literature question), I am modifying them further, so wondering what the end result would be.</p>\n<p>Basically, wondering how to obtain <strong>high quality</strong> digital text-based (i.e. non-image, non-PDF) versions of all the Hebrew texts.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Every text has to be evaluated by how close it is to the original. A tremendous amount of scholarship goes into correcting errors. The most accurate versions are usually not available for free, because of the high cost involved. Sefaria especially can have problems because anyone can edit it. It is very useful for people with enough knowledge to avoid the pitfalls, but ultimately you get what you pay for. Any high-quality version of texts is protected  by copyright.</p>\n\n\n",

    "title": "Why did Joseph let his brothers off the hook so easily?",
    "content": "# Why did Joseph let his brothers off the hook so easily?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I would love to see a discussion of the following point.  In <em>Vayigash</em>, Joseph reveals his identity to his brothers, and tells them:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am your brother Joseph, the one you sold into Egypt! And now, do not be distressed or reproach yourselves for selling me here, because it was to save lives that God sent me ahead of you.  It is now two years that there has been famine in the land, and there are still five years to come in which there shall be no yield from tilling.  But God has sent me ahead of you to ensure your survival on earth, and to save your lives in an extraordinary deliverance.  So then, it was not you who sent me here, but God... [<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.45.4-8?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 45:4-8</a>] And so, do not be afraid... You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good so as to bring about the present result—the survival of many people.  And so, fear not. I will sustain you and your children.[<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.50.19-21?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gen. 50:19-21</a>]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Why did Joseph let his brothers off the hook so easily?  He could have told them, “You did me a terrible wrong and you should be ashamed of yourselves.  But I will not seek revenge, and instead will give you the means to survive the famine, because I am not evil like you.”  But he didn’t.  He said, “Don’t worry and don’t feel guilty: It was all God’s plan.”  It appears that the sinners are even rewarded for their sin.</p>\n<p>Is this the proper way to confront those who have done evil to us, <em>even</em> if we really think God engineered it all for His plan?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>I saw two similar approaches to this question.</p>\n<p>Firstly by Rabbi Avi Geller on <a href=\"https://www.aish.com/tp/b/lp/48961151.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Aish</a> who notes that the grand reveal was carefully orchestrated in such a way that it helped to eliminate any bad feeling that Yosef might have had. He writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Parshat Vayigash is the climax of the story of Joseph and his brothers. The master planner had his brothers exactly where he wanted them: To know that they were under his total control and he could easily have taken his revenge, while in fact he really loved them and could never hurt them. On the contrary, he actually saved them from the famine.</p>\n<p>Joseph also harbored some bad feelings toward his brothers after being sold into slavery and being treated so cruelly. By putting his brother Benjamin into a similar situation and observing their efforts to save him, Joseph would be able to forgive them with a full heart. This way, the rift between them would be sealed, and the Jewish people would survive this ordeal!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yosef did not need to become enraged because his unmasking proved to them that they had made a mistake. As they bowed down to him it proved that his dreams had come to prophetic fruition. As a result:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Joseph had accomplished his mission: The brothers realized their mistake, and Joseph was able to overcome his bad feelings toward them. The brothers were now able to return home. Joseph told them not to tarry (for fear they might come to incriminate each other), but to hurry and bring their father down to Egypt.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Another approach is taken by that of the late <a href=\"https://rabbisacks.org/birth-forgiveness-vayigash-5775/#_ftn1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Lord Rabbi Jonathan Sacks</a> z\"l. He notes that this episode represented the first true example of forgiveness in the Torah. He posits that the whole dialogue between Yosef and the brothers was contrived in such a way to allow the brothers to go through a form of atonement for their past misdeeds, and as a result there was no need for him to feel angry.</p>\n<p>Rabbi Sacks writes;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That is the explanation for Joseph’s behaviour from the moment the brothers appear before him in Egypt for the first time to the point where, in this week’s parsha, he announces his identity and forgives his brothers. It is a textbook case of putting the brothers through a course in atonement, the first in literature. Joseph is thus teaching them, and the Torah is teaching us, what it is to earn forgiveness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Firstly, he imprisons Shimon and demands that they bring Binyomin. He is essentially forcing them to re-enact an earlier occurrence, i.e. to return to their father without one of the other brothers. They then realise that they are being punished on account of their treatment of Yosef (see <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.42.21-23?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 42:21-23</a>) - so they now admit that they have done wrong. Then when Yosef plants the goblet in Binyomin's sack they confess to their wrongdoing (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.16?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 44:16</a>). Finally when Yehuda asks that he be imprisoned in Binyomin's place (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.44.33?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bereishis 44:33</a>) - Yehuda the one who originally sold Yosef into slavery is the one willing to pay the prize thereby representing a teshuva gemura (a complete repentance).</p>\n<p>So according to this approach from Rabbi Sacks we see that Yosef did not need to harbour any sense of anger or bitterness. He concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now Joseph can forgive, because his brothers, led by Judah, have gone through all three stages of repentance: (1) admission of guilt, (2) confession and (3) behavioural change....Humanity changed the day Joseph forgave his brothers. When we forgive and are worthy of being forgiven, we are no longer prisoners of our past.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

But if the hair is folded back, as is often done with a chup, and the Tefillin is resting on the part that's folded back it would be an issue since it's not the natural way for the hair to grow.</p>\n\n\n",

(When one sees someone sinning it makes it less severe in his eyes), and therefore they need to see the severity of the consequence more than anyone else.\n(Michtav Me'eliyahu)</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The Mishna, which contains the essence of the Oral Torah going back to Moses at Mt.

It must be that His will is\nthrough these sufferings I will remember my Creator, and repent before\nHim with a full <em>teshuva</em>, and return to His Torah and His <em>mitzvot</em>\nand serve Him with all my heart.</p>\n<p>When a person takes this to heart... they will be happy recognising\nthe great good that Hashem did for them, and the fact that He is\nlooking after them and being concerned with their affairs... bringing\nthem close to Him with the love of a parent for a child. As it is\nwritten \"For the one whom Hashem loves, He reproves\" (Mishlei 3:12);\nand it says: \"Fortunate is the person whom Hashem afflicts\" (Tehillim\n94:12). This blow is a great kindness and healing from Hashem, healing\nthe person's soul and assuring their ultimate good.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is also the concept of testing and refining. Not only does that allow us to gain reward for actions rather than merely the potential/thought/character, but it also improves our potential/thought/character (see Ramban and Ran on Bereshit 22:1)</p>\n<p>Note how this modifies our understanding of typical examples: \"he didn't board the plane because he forgot his tefillin, and therefore survived 9/11\". They are not meant to imply that if he had gotten on the plane, ch'v, that would have been \"not meant to be\"; bad. If we conclude that, we've missed the entire lesson. The small suffering of missing a flight, the large suffering of losing one's life tragically, are both the same: they are meant to be and for the ultimate good. <strong>There's no two way street because there is only one way!</strong></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>No it isn't we infer from the popular phrase found throughout Shas</p>\n<p>הכל בשמיים חוץ מיראת שמיים</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The extent to which we can understand that everything is part of Hashem's plan is proportional to the extent to which we can be <em>masig</em> (comprehend) the <em>tachlis schar ve'onesh</em> (the ultimate extent of Divine reward and punishment).</p>\n<p>For example, let's say that I would say, \"The Holocaust cannot possibly be part of Hashem's plan, because what could justify such suffering?\"</p>\n<p>This question can be transliterated as follows: Since I cannot comprehend any Good that can be greater than and achieved by the suffering of the Holocaust, hence there could have been no rationale for the Holocaust.</p>\n\n\n",

And if someone suggests they'll make a statue of an imposing-looking male (or female, for that matter) figure only as a symbol to inspire people to pray to a non-corporeal deity, well... that's an incredibly slippery slope to idolatry.</p>\n<p>But let's stick with something safe! Decorative or commemorative statues!</p>\n<p>Shortly after President Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, the mayor of McKeesport, Pennsylvania decided that his town should have the first statue of JFK in his memory. He asked Rabbi Chinn to be on the planning board and help raise funds for it. Rabbi Chinn consulted with Rabbi Moshe Feinstein, who replied in January 1964 -- the responsum is found in <em>Igros Moshe Yoreh Deah II #54</em>. Rabbi Feinstein explicitly allows it for your reason -- non-Jews aren't prohibited from making, having, or using statues that have nothing to do with worship.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now making a statue in the image of man, even for decoration, is prohibited – whether to make them or to have them (when made by a gentile for him), as is ruled in Shulchan Aruch YD141:4.\n… however non-Jews are not commanded in the prohibition against making a statue for decorative or political purposes. Though we need no proof to this as it is not in the seven [Noahide] commandments, it can be proven from Tosafot … and thus it follows that it is not prohibited for a Jew to assist a non-Jew in his making of a political statue, or even to assist him financially, as for non-Jews this is a permitted act.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>(He also points to R' Akiva Eiger, Rosh Hashana 2.11.)</p>\n\n\n",

These meforshim explain that the problem is one of complete waste of time, and therefore the Bartenura says in maseches avos (5:22) that it is permitted to read these books in the restroom because there it is asur to think in Torah. According to this, given that everyone wastes so much time with useless stuff anyway, there would seem to be a strong leg to stand on from here to say it's permissible.</p>\n<p>Also see shu\"t Rashba chelek aleph simanim 414-418 (warning, 418 is very, very long) about what is seemingly the same topic where he is quite machmir.</p>\n<p>There is also a teshuva of the Rivash (chelek aleph siman 45) which is very helpful, where he speaks out his view of chachmas yevanis (lit.

Joseph's method was of benefit both to him and to the purchasers. By refusing to sell large quantities at one time, Joseph could take advantage of any rise in price when it occurred. The customers benefited by what he did since Joseph did not raise prices unreasonably.

    "content": "# What is the proper balance between halacha and social life?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I guess the question that I'm going to ask is an aspect of a much broader question on the tension between halacha and openness and I'm not even sure whether the question is halachic or hashkafic ... But anyway ...\nLet's say, Reuven is a single guy, who lives in a small apartment and he considers to elevate his level of kashrut. Let's also assume that Reuven has a couple of friends who are married and have children which means, that practically he can not invite them for a shabbos meal to his house and the only way they can eat together, is for him to visit them at their house. Let's also assume that these friends are not keeping that level of kashrut that he is considering. Therefore Reuven understands that the price for elevating his level of kashrut would be reducing the connection to some of his good friends, or, in more general terms, limiting his social life. What would be the true way to look at this dilemma from the perspective of the Torah ? Here are some of the answers that I consider:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>The ratzon Hashem is primarily expressed through the halacha. Therefore, in order to observe the halachot of kashrut more properly, Reuven should be willing to pay the cost of practicing friendships/ social life in a more limited way.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The ratzon Hashem is not limited to halacha but Hashem equally appreciates the value of friendship/ social life. Therefore the proper balance between these 2 aspects is a question of personal preference.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Hashem has such a high appreciation for certain aspects of a persons life, such as friendships, that he does not want Reuven to limit them for the sake of fulfilling halacha more properly.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course there might be also other practical solutions to the described dilemma (e.g. Reuven could come to his friends with his own food – a solution that is rather unpractical and moreover, might make them feel a bit uncomfortable) but at this point I’m not considering them, because the question is designed to illustrate a more general dilemma. I realize that the proposed answers sound rather simplistic and maybe it would be more  proper to express them in a more sophisticated way. I also assume that dozens of essays have been written on this dilemma by various jewish thinkers since it is so fundamental and, probably, is relevant to most orthodox jews. Therefore, I would also appreciate both personal opinions and literature suggestions on the dilemma described above.</p>\n\n\n",

A strainer, which lets out the wine and retains the\nlees; A sieve, which lets out the kemach and retains the choice\nflour (סֹּלֶת).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Rav <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.5.15?lang=bi&with=Bartenura&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a> that, unlike the \"strainer\":</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The sieve: After we take out the bran and the bruised grain from the\nground flour, the [inferior powdery] flour is left with the coarse\nfine flour, and [the latter] is the [more] important one; we pass it\nthrough a very fine sieve. And all of the [powdery] flour - which is\nlike white dust - falls from it, and the coarse important flour\nremains. And so would they do with grain offerings.<br />\nSo [too], there is\none who has the ability to separate and to cleanse his teachings and\ntake the truth from the false and wasteful.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You see that the \"סולת\" required for all the menachos (grain-offerings) in the Torah is the <em>coarse</em> flour. The powdery dust is what you sift out.<br />\nWe see the same in the mishnah in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Menachot.8.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Menachos, 9(2)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כֵּיצַד הוּא בוֹדֵק. הַגִּזְבָּר מַכְנִיס אֶת יָדוֹ לְתוֹכָהּ. עָלָה\nבָהּ אָבָק, פְּסוּלָה, עַד שֶׁיְּנִיפֶנָּה<br />\nHow does the Temple treasurer inspect the flour to determine whether\nit is of sufficiently high quality? The treasurer inserts his hand\ninto the flour. If, when he removes his hand, flour powder (\"dust\") covers it,\nthe flour is unfit, until one sifts it with a fine sifter, so that no\npowder will remain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Any bakers who could explain this? Do we have this today, \"coarse fine flour\" and worthless \"powdery flour\"? Where the \"fine flour\" wouldn't stick to your hand if you stuck it in? It doesn't seem to fit with my impression of the bags of flour my wife brings home.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>Okay! With Kazi bacsi's help (and R' Tzvi Rozen of the Star-K), plus I found a Rashi that addresses this.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There is something called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flour\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"first break\"</a>, where wheat or grain is not fully ground, but is broken into smaller pieces. In addition to the endosperm, that is the point where you can sift out the shells, the bran, and any other low quality junk <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_middlings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"middlings\"</a>, also see <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semolina\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">\"semolina\"</a>. It seems complicated.<br />\nThat will be the point that the Mishnah in Menachos is describing, where the solet brought in to the treasurer should contain nothing large or small besides endosperm.<br />\nAfter that you finish grinding it.<br />\nHere's (the early published form of) Rashi at the end of the seventh perek, 76b: <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.76b.10?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.sefaria.org/Menachot.76b.10?lang=bi&with=Rashi&lang2=en</a></li>\n</ol>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בדקה בגסה - כו'ובתחילה היו מניפין בדקה והיתה קולטת הסלת והסובין והיה\nהקמח הולך כו' ואח\"כ נותנין אותו בגסה שקולטת הסובין שנשתיירו בסלת\nוהגרוסות כעין קרטין שממנו הסלת נעשה היה הולך לעבר הנפה כו' וכן חוזרין\nחלילה עד שיהא מנופה שלש עשרה פעמים ובלבד שלא ישתייר מן הקמח ומן הסובין\nעם הסלת וחוזרין וטוחנין קרטין והגרוסות והויין סלת עכ\"ל</p>\n<p>With fine and\ncoarse sieves... At first they would sift with the fine sieve and it\nwould collect the solet and the bran, and the powder would sift out...\nThen they would put it in a coarse sieve to screen out the bran, and\nlet through the solet (and) pieces like chunks from which solet is made. Then they would do it again, 13\ntimes... till all the powder and all the bran are gone. <em>Then they go back and\ngrind up the chunks, and that is solet.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Addendum</strong>:\nI’m wondering if this could also help me with a different issue. The mishnah there says that you need more grain to start with for the Shtei Halechem than for the Lechem Hapanim (two סאה per עשרון instead of just one). The reason given in the gemara is that the Shtei Halechem is chadash, Lechem Hapanim is yashan. Rashi says that as a result, the Shtei Halechem will have more סובין. Rambam in פיה\"מ explains</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אבל לחם הפנים שהוא מחטה שנקצרה זה ימים והיא יבשה כל צרכה ויש בה סלת\nהרבה בלי ספק</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It bothered me: Why would the quantity of solet compared to סובין change as it gets dryer? אם קבלה נקבל, but how does that work?\nA description of the part that is not semolina endosperm (Wikipedia on “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_middlings\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">middlings</a>”):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>…<strong>shorts</strong> (making up approximately 12% of the original grain, consisting\nof fractions of endosperm, bran, and germ with an average particle\nsize of 500-900 microns) and <strong>red dog</strong> (actually a low-grade flour,\nmaking up approximately 3% of the original grain, consisting of\nfractions of endosperm and bran, with an average particle size of\n100-300 microns).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It describes the קמח powder, here called “red dog”. And the “shorts”, much bigger pieces. Both also contain some endosperm.<br />\nI wonder if when the Rishonim are talking about “סולת” and “סובין” after grinding, they’re using rough descriptions of the two main large components (along with the “קמח” powder) of what you get after the first break partial grinding process. The part you want, and the part you don’t want. You’re hoping that all the real wheat stays together, and the shells and bran stay together, so you can sift them out. It’s important that they end up different sizes for the sifting; it’s touchy. But some of the pieces containing shells and bran (and powder too) also contain some of the wheat (endosperm), as the article says. That gets lost, sifted out.<br />\nGuesswork: It could be that when the kernel is dry, the separation can be cleaner and you end up with a better result, less wheat getting lost. This would need more research.</p>\n\n\n",

There is an axiom, I don't know where to source it, that says that an Amora quoted by name in the Gemara was someone who could successfully daven to bring back the dead. So clearly if someone's name is in the Gemara they are a person of stature. So when the Gemara goes out of its way to <em>not</em> name Rabbah bar bar Channah's father, and to instead to name his grandmother (I'm assuming, from a name like Channah), I wonder why. I know we can just declare that \"Channah could bring back people from the dead, and bar Channah couldn't\" but I'm wondering if there's more out there in terms of specifics.</p>\n<p>Is there a history associated with Channah that indicates her (or his) greatness, or why Rabbah and R' Yitzchok are named after Channah instead of their father?</p>\n\n\n",

In essence, they are likened to a person who seeks to travel to a city but does not know the way. Thus, they spend their time on the road stumbling and wearying themselves without ever arriving at their end goal.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>עמל. דמה הכסיל שיעמוד לבקש גדולות ונפלאות ממנו והוא לא ידע הנראות והידועות כאדם רוצה ללכת אל עיר ולא ידע הדרך וייגע ולא יראה חפצו</p>\n<p>Toil - It compares a fool to one that seeks great and wonderful things from him and he lacks the proper knowledge/comprehension - like a man who want to go to a city and he does not know the way and will become weary and will not see his object (i.e. the final destination of the city).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a similar vein, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ecclesiastes.10.15?lang=bi&p2=Metzudat_David_on_Ecclesiastes.10.15.1&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Metzudas Dovid</a> notes how the fool exerts a great deal of effort in things that they don't need to bother with.

He transfers to another system and yet another, giving each one up in turn because something has made it reprehensible to him. Such a person may be compared to one who wishes to go to a certain city but does not know which road leads there; consequently he tries many roads.\" (Rav Saadiah Gaon)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Being that it is a religious period that adds to the sheva mitzvot (Muslims must fast and is completely obligatory), seems like it would be forbidden since they are creating a mitzvah to fast, although I am not sure.</p>\n<p>However, lets say there is a Muslim who fasts extra days throughout the year.

So it is like a refinement process that a person goes through in order to come out 'purer' and free of sin. This is what it means when it says that Gehinnom will end but they will not end - i.e. the process will initiate the 'reset' button but then as reshaim they will need to experience a new process of gehinnom. So the process ends but they will not and will have to go through it afresh.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n",

Along those lines, the Midrash notes that bereshit can also mean “with reshit”, that is “with the beginning”, “the beginning” being the Torah.  So the first phrase should read: “With the beginning (that is, with the Torah) God created the world.” [Gen.

Furthermore if the person did not die on the other planet the amount of time it would take to get there would be a forbidden delay in the burial as the Torah says people are to be buried on the day of death.(Some are of the opinion that this obligation  is Rabbinic) If the question is the opposite, the person was on the other planet and died and the question is returning the body to Earth it would  possibly   fall into one of the categories listed in Shulchan Aruch (YD 357:1) when it is permitted to delay burial to honor the deceased.</p>\n\n\n",

Abraham ibn Ezra cites him on three occasions in his commentary on the Pentateuch, once in his commentary on Isaiah, twice in his commentary on Psalms, and once in his commentary on Daniel. All these instances, however, are examples of the allegorical method of interpretation, and it is possible that they were taken from some philosophical work of Gabirol or from some special work on the subject of biblical allegory. In fact we have two citations from Gabirol in David Kimḥi’s commentary on Psalms (37-8, 23) which are taken from his ethical work. But the biblical illustrations in which this very work on ethics abounds lend countenance to the suggestion that Gabirol also engaged in biblical exegesis.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In short, though there may have been a commentary on the Bible or at least parts of it, there doesn't appear to currently be any evidence that there was one specifically on Psalms.</p>\n\n\n",

To escape the decree of Paroh to kill Jewish male babies, Yocheved places her son in a basket in the water. None other than Paroh's daughter discovers him and saves him.  Paroh's daughter agrees to Miriam's suggestion that she find a Jewish wet-nurse to feed the baby and the result is that Paroh's daughter is paying Yocheved to nurse her own son. This seems to be a miraculous turn of events. The Chumash makes no mention of the  <strong>miraculous nature</strong> of the incident nor of the feelings of Yocheved and Miriam.</p>\n<p>Why is there no mention of the miraculous nature of the incident with Bas Paroh and baby Moshe in the text. Do any of the meforshim speak about it?</p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/75692/why-did-shifrah-give-moses-back-to-pharaohs-daughter\">Why did Shifrah give Moses back to Pharaoh's daughter?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://judaism.stackexchange.com/questions/88346/how-did-paros-daughter-explain-suddenly-having-a-child\">How did Paro's daughter explain suddenly having a child?</a></p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>The verses say that Miriam, Moshe's sister, stood watch to see what would happen with Moshe. When the daughter of Pharaoh pulled Moshe from the water, Miriam suggested Yocheved as a nurse. So it was not so much a miracle as a result of Miriam's dedication.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: -1)\n\n<p>Perhaps, our cultural take on how one should react to miracles may yield misunderstanding of the Egyptians' reaction to the miracle of Moshe's rescue. I.e. while the Torah does not seem to present the situation as miraculous, our tradition tells us that Mitzrim indeed interpreted events of Moshe's rescue as miraculous and attributed him supernatural powers from that moment on. Moshe survived because he was an unusually big child. Because Moshe did not drown in the Nile river (an object of worship), Egyptians felt that he had powers over it. Later Pharaoh considered himself a god and would not speak to Moshe if there was no known supernatural reputation about him, as Shemot 4:16 states literally. Therefore, Torah does indeed present the whole incident as miraculous from its very beginning by noting how egyptians reacted to it.</p>\n<p>Finally, we know that daughter of Pharao call the baby Moshe, as the root משה means draw out of water. However, daughter of Pharao could not speak Hebrew, so the question is what does the name mean in Ancient Egyptian language.  According to the book \"Accuracy of the Bible\" by egyptologist Abraham S. Yahuda (section II, chapter 1), the etymology of the name Mosheh is an expression of two words: \"mu\" - seed, son, child and \"sheh\" - body of water, pond, lake, specifically applied to water of the Nile river itself. I.e. Mu-sheh - son of the Nile - an Egyptian divine name.</p>\n\n\n",

During the second year of that period, arrows of famine will be shot, indicating that there will be famine only in certain places. During the third year there will be a great famine, and men, women, children, the pious, and men of action will die, and the Torah is forgotten by those who study it. During the fourth year there will be plenty but not great plenty. During the fifth year there will be great plenty and they will eat, and drink, and rejoice, and the Torah will return to those who study it. During the sixth year, heavenly voices will be heard.

R' Yehoshua ben Chananya holds that the period is 7 years, yet The Emporer claims that the Sabei Debei Atuna - The Sages of Athens bred snakes who were only pregnant for 3 years. R' Yehoshua ben Chananya retorted that those snakes were already pregnant for 4 years when The Sages of Athens bred them, as snakes can cohabitate for purely carnal reasons.</p>\n<p>Rav Moshe Shapiro is explaining the debate to be referring to the final 7 years building up to the coming of the Mashiach. As the Gemara here in Sanhedrin states, in the first 4 years the state of the world will gradually decline, whereas in the final 3 years the world will gradually improve. The Sages of Athens understand this to mean that only the final 3 years represent the build-up to the Mashiach, as the purpose of the Mashiach is to ultimately perfect the world, therefore the final 3 years in which the state of affairs of the world will improve must in fact be the groundwork for the arrival of the Mashiach. It is for this reason that The Sages of Athens believe the birth period of a snake to be only 3 years, as the embryo inside the snake homiletically represents the development of the Mashiach. The 4 years prior in which the world only declines cannot be related to the totality of the Mashiach's arrival, as it is in diametric opposition to what the Mashiach represents.</p>\n<p>R' Yehoshua ben Chananya, however, disagrees fundamentally. Although it is true that the goal of the Mashiach is to perfect the state of the world, the understanding of this perfection is unique.</p>\n<p>The ultimate perfection of the world is found in the deep secret of how the root of all evil is in fact goodness itself. The Ramcha\"l (Klach Pischei Chochmah, 1-3) describes this phenomenon as God's ultimate will manifesting completely. God's will is goodness itself, and being that God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent, nothing exists outside of his will. That which seems antithetical to God's will of goodness is only due to our lack of understanding, this is our test of faith, to believe that even the existence of evil is only a part of God's ultimate will of goodness. The transition of this concept from a belief to reality is the perfection of the world and is what the arrival of Mashiach represents.</p>\n<p>With that said, we now understand the opinion of R' Yehoshua ben Chananya. In the first 4 years prior to the coming of Mashiach the world will decline in the most extreme way, a seemingly pure manifestation of evil. Yet this is specifically part of the arrival of Mashiach, for these 4 years of evil are in fact the groundwork for the Mashiach's arrival, being that we will see how even the most extreme form of evil is rooted in God's will of goodness. We will gradually begin to understand this reality and when the Mashiach arrives, he will bring with him the ultimate manifestation of this reality, as it won't just be a belief, or even an understanding, it will be a tangible perception.</p>\n<p>This explains why R' Yehoshua ben Chananya claimed that The Sages of Athens bred their snakes when they were already 4 years pregnant, this means that they completely disregard the first 4 years prior to the coming of the Mashiach as being the groundwork of his arrival, rather only the last 3 years relate to his arrival. The Sages of Athens believe that the gestation and birth, or the conception and ultimate arrival of the Mashiach is only a 3 year process in which the world will improve.</p>\n<p>As to the opinion of other commentators I cannot say much as I have not researched the topic in such length.</p>\n<p>The last paragraph you cited is explaining the point made earlier in the text of the Gemara. The 7 year period of pregnancy is parallel to the 7 years prior to the arrival of the Mashiach. The first year represents the conception of the Mashiach, just like an embryo must be conceived before birth. The conception of the Mashiach can happen at any time if we are worthy, yet we must continue in our righteous ways devoted to the Torah in order for the Mashiach to gestate and ultimately reveal himself. Even if we were worthy and the Mashiach was conceived, if we don't persist in our righteous ways then the Mashiach will not gestate, like that of a miscarriage.</p>\n<p>This idea is written clearly in the Zohar Chadash (Sifra Tanina, 62) which describes the development of the Mashiach as a fetus, and the Pesikta Rabbasi (15,1) which describes more details on the years leading up to arrival of the Mashiach.</p>\n\n\n",

Nothing at all! Leave business alone and bury your dead!\"\nSforno expands, \"“after all it is a very minor transaction! It is so insignificant a matter that the acquisition can be made by a mere declaration without being recorded in a document. As soon as you have handed over the money you may consider yourself as burying Sarah in your property.”\"</p>\n<p>The Radak explains it as \"what difference does such a paltry sum make, whether you want to pay it or do not want to pay it, go ahead and bury your dead.\"</p>\n<p>With the Rashbam echpoing \"Take it and bury your dead for free if you so desire.”</p>\n<p>The Rabbeinu Bahya has a more complex take on it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On the words ביני ובינך מה היא, “what is such a paltry sum between me and you,” the Midrash (Baba Metzia 86) says that the righteous promise little and perform in excess of what they promise. An example is Avraham who promised to serve his guests only a piece of bread, whereas he prepared a sumptuous feast (Genesis 18,8), instructing Sarah to bake cakes from the finest flour, while he himself ran to the stables to prepare the best calves for the meal. The wicked, on the other hand, promise a lot and do not keep any of it, such as Efron who kept speaking about what he was going “to give” to Avraham whereas when it came to the conclusion of the transaction he overcharged him.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Torah testified that Avraham paid him in hard cash, the price being exorbitant. As proof of the miserly and avaricious attitude of Efron the sages in the Talmud draw our attention to the numerical value of the name עפרון which the Torah abbreviated to עפרן when it became clear that he did not give Avraham anything. The remaining letters in his name amount to 400, the same as the numerical value of the letters in the expression רע עין, grudging, envious.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Avraham did not want to accept any gifts from him but to pay full value, בכסף מלא, as is the custom of righteous people. We find that King David (Samuel II chapter 24) also did not want to accept any gifts and paid handsomely for the threshing ground of Aravnah the Jebusite, although offered the site plus animals to serve as sacrifices as well the animals’ yokes to serve as fire-wood. David paid 50 shekels for the threshing ground plus the animals and their yokes as he did not want to appear cheap in the eyes of G’d (Samuel II 24,24).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The second quote is a statement that the currency/coins that Avraham used was in a form that a merchant would accept (the highest quality, according to some commentaries). The point is that the specie used was above reproach in its value.</p>\n<p>(all quotes from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.23.15?lang=bi&with=Commentary&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">sefaria</a> page)</p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Are these bicycles hefker?\n\n## Frage\n\n<p>I work on a University campus. Adjacent to my building is a bicycle rack, to which several bikes have been locked since the start of the academic year (end of August). It's clear that these bikes have been abandoned; they have not been moved in four months, and some of them have been scavenged for parts (missing tires, seats, etc.).  Some of them, surprisingly, still have good, usable parts, including quick-release seats and tires that, inexplicably, have not been taken.</p>\n<p>In mid-November, the University public safety department put tags on all of these bikes reading:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This bike appears to be abandoned and per Regents ordinance will be impounded.  If this bike is not abandoned it must be removed within 15 days.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It is now late December; more than a month has passed since the bikes were tagged, but as of today they have still not yet been removed, either by their owners or by the authorities (although I expect the latter will do so soon).</p>\n<p>From a <strong>halachic</strong> point of view, are these bikes <em>hefker</em>?  At this point it seems undeniable to me that the owners have given up any hope of reclaiming their property.  Is it permissible to take possession of them, or of any usable parts that remain?  Or have they now, by virtue of the tagging, become the property of the local authorities?</p>\n<p>Just to be clear:  I have no intention of actually taking the bikes, or any of their parts.  Quite apart from the questions of whether it is legal (under civil law) or permissible (under Halacha), I do not wish to be <em>seen</em> to be stealing bicycles parked on public property; I think for a <em>kippah</em>-wearing Jew to do so would raise serious <em>marit ayin</em> issues.  I am interested in the theoretical status of the bicycles:  at what point do / did they become <em>hefker</em>, does the city’s tagging of the bikes alter their status, etc.?</p>\n<p>(For those who are curious, <a href=\"https://law.stackexchange.com/questions/76497/is-it-illegal-to-take-a-bicycle-or-parts-from-one-that-the-local-authorities-h\">I have posted a parallel question about the status of these bicycles under civil law on a different SE site.</a>)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>From your description it would seem that there is some university bylaw that states that leaving a bicycle on the rack for an extended period constitutes abandonment. Anyone who brings a bicycle on campus accepts the rules. The owner thus abandons the bike.</p>\n<p>In this case, it seems like the university has not claimed the bike but intends to do so. If they change their language a bit, they could aquire the bike at the end of the 15 days by affixing the tag.</p>\n<p>Once the groundskeeper has cut the bolt off and begins the acquisition process, you can't come running up and ask him for the bike, for free or for money. At this point, it belongs to the university.</p>\n<p>The pious thing to do would be to wait until the 15 days ends, take the bike, but post a flyer explaining that you have done so and allow the owner 3 chagim to claim it from you.</p>\n<p>Source: I asked the question when I acquired a bicycle in a similar situation.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.feldheim.com/halachos-of-other-peoples-money-1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Yisroel Pinchas Bodner</a> cites <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh,_Choshen_Mishpat.260.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CM 260:1</a> to the effect that the zman hefker depends on the <a href=\"https://halachipedia.com/index.php?title=Returning_Lost_Objects#cite_ref-48\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">time</a> and place.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Similarly, if it’s evident that the object has been lost for a long\ntime such as if one sees moss or rust on the object, then it’s permissible to take and keep the object.

Moshe was on his way to save the Jewish people, and the Torah says that he stayed with his wife and children in a hotel. Next, we're told that Hashem wants to kill Moshe, and Tziporra takes a rock and circumcises their son. Moshe is saved. She then calls Moshe her husband of blood.</p>\n<p>Rashi brings from Chazal (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Nedarim.31b.13\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nedarim 31b</a>–32a) that Moshe was negligent in giving his son a <em>bris milah</em>, so he was punished, or some say that he was busy occupying himself with the hotel, so he was punished. An angel came in the form of a snake and tried to eat Moshe. The angel stopped eating Moshe around his private area, showing Tziporra that the solution would be to give her son a circumcision. She did so, and they were saved.</p>\n<p>This doesn't make the story any easier to understand. <strong>Is there any commentary which gives some sort of satisfactory explanation for what exactly happened here</strong>? Why would Moshe be killed for such a minor infraction? Won't this prevent the redemption of the Jewish people? Why was the angel in the form of a snake? Why did Tziporra touch Moshe's leg with the knife? What are we to take from Tziporra's response that Moshe is her \"husband of blood\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>The Midrash says that Jethro worshipped all existing idols and concluded only God was real:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Jethro said: I have not neglected to worship any idol in this world, but I have found no god like the God of Israel. [Midrash Tanḥuma, Yitro 7]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So Jethro wanted a grandson to do as he did: Worship all existing idols and conclude only God was real.  This would give him a better appreciation of monotheism. [Mayan Bet Hashoeva on Yitro 18, 4] Moses agreed.  To be sure, this is a dubious interpretation of the injunction to teach Torah to our children:</p>\n<p>וְשִׁנַּנְתָּ֣ם לְבָנֶ֔יךָ -- Veshinantam levanecha -- and you will teach it to your children. [Deut. 6:7]</p>\n<p>One may wonder: Is this why Moses at first did not circumcize Gershom, and God threatened to kill him, and his wife Zipporah had to do it in his stead?</p>\n<p>Perhaps Moses intentionally did not want Gershom circumcised because of his promise to Jethro.  In the end, the Midrash says that Moses' son became an idolater.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Based on your question, it sounds like you want an explanation of the story that will appeal to a more rational audience.</p>\n<p>Ralbag explains the story as follows:\nMoshe wanted to follow Hashem's instructions to return to Egypt. He assumed that there was a conflict between leaving right away and circumcising his newborn son, since it would be dangerous to travel with a newly circumcised child, so he chose to leave with his family (Ralbag gives Moshe's rational(s) for bringing his family along), intending to circumcise his child afterwards. However, due to Moshe's high spiritual level, G-d made Moshe fall ill (to the point that he requested [?] death), to show him that he must be extremely zealous to perform Hashem's commandments in the future. Moshe was aware, through prophecy, that this sin of delaying the circumcision caused his illness. Hashem waited until they were at an inn to punish Moshe, so that the child could reasonably be circumcised without being endangered, and Tzipporah was to remain with the child at the inn following.\nIn regards to the latter part of the story, due to Moshe's illness, Tzipporah performs the circumcision, but not very skillfully, and thus, the blood of the child reached his feet, meaning there was a lot of bleeding. She then proclaimed the child a \"chatan damim\", since the word chatan can refer to any beginning, and this was the first time she had \"spilled blood\". However, once Moshe recovered, and explained to her that she had not properly stopped the blood, she knew that this was \"chatan damim lamulot\", the first time one who had been circumcised lost so much blood.</p>\n<p>I later noticed <a href=\"https://alhatorah.org/Mystery_at_the_Malon/2/en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this excellent summary article</a>; I trust that there is lots of discussion of the important issues there.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 3 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>Here is an answer that I wrote: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1USASSHSZVGAmMhMA8AXQyPY9oiixRh7t/view?usp=sharing\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chasan Damim</a>.

So you have an inclined surface, which is sopping wet, and sitting on it (on the water) are the balls of dough.</p>\n\n\n",

And how do we repent from something we have no access to?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>I assume that you are discussing the \"sin\" of eating of the tree of knowledge of good/evil. I would also like to say I appreciate Rosend's comment because I believe it to be true, but maybe not in the way they would expect. The comment was:</p>\n<p>\"The consequence of the action was a change in nature of humanity. It isn't about a punishment.\"</p>\n<p>Even though we as Jews are often taught by our tradition (and further reinforced by outside Christian traditions) that Adam did the \"original sin\" and therefore we are living in a punished/fallen world, it seems to me the Tanakh views things entirely differently.</p>\n<p>We would EXPECT the Bible to say that Adam was kicked out of the garden for sinning. But it doesn't. What it does say is something much more confusing and religiously problematic.</p>\n<p>Genesis 3:22</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כב  וַיֹּאמֶר יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים, הֵן הָאָדָם הָיָה כְּאַחַד מִמֶּנּוּ,\nלָדַעַת, טוֹב וָרָע; וְעַתָּה פֶּן-יִשְׁלַח יָדוֹ, וְלָקַח גַּם מֵעֵץ\nהַחַיִּים, וְאָכַל, וָחַי לְעֹלָם.    22 And the LORD God said: 'Behold,\nthe man is become as one of us, to know good and evil; and now, lest\nhe put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and\nlive for ever.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So according to God, Adam was NOT kicked out because of sinning like we might have expected. Theologically this verse is very difficult, and I would prefer if it would say that man was kicked out for sinning, but it doesn't. Rather the verse is clear that Adam was kicked out because of the change in his humanity, and this change gave Adam some kind of potential that forced God to kick Adam out of the garden. Even more confusingly, God doesn't kick Adam out because of his potential in that moment. So for example, the verse doesn't say that God is kicking man out because of the singular event of eating from the tree. God is kicking mankind out because if Adam were to ALSO eat from the tree of life (which is not a sin), <em><strong>then</strong></em> things would potentially be catastrophic. The verse also hints that if the tree of life was not also in the garden, then Adam would never have been kicked out of the garden since there wouldn't have been a risk of him living forever.</p>\n<p>I would argue that because we as humans now have the capacity to make moral judgments for ourselves, the potential harm we could do if we could also live for ever would be devastating. And this potential devastation is exactly what the verse is scared of. Imagine how much faster we could have had nuclear weapons if people didn't die every generation, imagine if knowledge didn't get lost because of the death or destruction of a particular culture in time.</p>\n<p>Also when we go back to the punishments, I would argue that most of the punishments are really just a description of the future reality of living outside the garden. Adam had cursed the grounds of the garden and could no longer live there, and would be forced to farm outside the garden which is difficult.</p>\n<p>Genesis 3:17-19</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>יז  וּלְאָדָם אָמַר, כִּי-שָׁמַעְתָּ לְקוֹל אִשְׁתֶּךָ, וַתֹּאכַל\nמִן-הָעֵץ, אֲשֶׁר צִוִּיתִיךָ לֵאמֹר לֹא תֹאכַל מִמֶּנּוּ--אֲרוּרָה\nהָאֲדָמָה, בַּעֲבוּרֶךָ, בְּעִצָּבוֹן תֹּאכְלֶנָּה, כֹּל יְמֵי\nחַיֶּיךָ.     17 And unto Adam He said: 'Because thou hast hearkened unto\nthe voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I\ncommanded thee, saying: Thou shalt not eat of it; cursed is the ground\nfor thy sake; in toil shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.\nיח  וְקוֹץ וְדַרְדַּר, תַּצְמִיחַ לָךְ; וְאָכַלְתָּ, אֶת-עֵשֶׂב\nהַשָּׂדֶה.    18 Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee;\nand thou shalt eat the herb of the field. יט  בְּזֵעַת אַפֶּיךָ,\nתֹּאכַל לֶחֶם, עַד שׁוּבְךָ אֶל-הָאֲדָמָה, כִּי מִמֶּנָּה לֻקָּחְתָּ:\nכִּי-עָפָר אַתָּה, וְאֶל-עָפָר תָּשׁוּב.  19 In the sweat of thy face\nshalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it\nwast thou taken; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.'</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So I would argue that there is no forgiveness for Adam's sin because Adam's sin is not ongoing. God intervened in Adam's life directly to offset the choice that Adam made by eating the fruit of good/evil by kicking him out of the garden. The rest of us just happen to live life outside of the garden, which is not paradise. And now we all have the capacity to decide right and wrong for ourselves and therefore we <strong>must</strong> die.</p>\n<p>Genesis 2:17</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat\nof it; for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>I totally agree with what @rosends writes in his comment:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The consequence of the action was a change in nature of humanity. It isn't about a punishment</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Sefer Yechezkel begins with the words (translation includes the commentary of Rashi there) <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ezekiel.1.1?lang=bi&p2=Rashi_on_Ezekiel.1.1.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Yechezkel 1:1)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As I was in the midst of the exile</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The sin was not simply eating from the Eitz Hadaat, but the sin has a deeper meaning. Rav Avraham Yitzchak HaCohen Kook writes in his work <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shemonah_Kevatzim.3.24.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemonah Kevatzim (3:24)</a> that when G-d asks Adam \"Where are you?\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Genesis.3.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bereishis 3:9)</a>, G-d meant \"where are you, did you sin?\" (see: <a href=\"https://torahmitzion.org/learn/correcting-sin-adam/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this article written by Rabbi Zvi Alon from Torah Mitzion</a>).</p>\n<p>On this, Rav Kook explains that by doing this sin, Adam was alienated with himself/ from his own essence:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He turned to the consciousness of the serpent and lost himself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, Adam was not able anymore to answer a simple question: did you sin? Why did you sin?</p>\n<p>Recognising a sin is prerequisite for doing teshuva, as the Rambam writes in his <a href=\"https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/911888/jewish/Teshuvah-Chapter-One.htm#:%7E:text=How%20does%20one%20confess%3A%20He%20states%3A%20%22I%20implore%20You%2C%20God%2C%20I%20sinned%2C%20I%20transgressed%2C%20I%20committed%20iniquity%20before%20You%20by%20doing%20the%20following.%20Behold%2C%20I%20regret%20and%20am%20embarrassed%20for%20my%20deeds.%20I%20promise%20never%20to%20repeat%20this%20act%20again.%22\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Hilchos Teshuva (chapter 1)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How does one confess: He states: \"I implore You, G-d, I sinned, I transgressed, I committed iniquity before You by doing the following. Behold, I regret and am embarrassed for my deeds. I promise never to repeat this act again.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This very essence: confessing to G-d that you did a sin was lacking from Adam HaRishon because, as Rav Kook says \"He turned to the concsciousness of the serpent and lost himself\".</p>\n<p>And this is, according to Rav Kook, why we still \"feel\" the effects of the sin of Adam HaRishon:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Thus does the world continue to sink, with the loss of the “I” of every [entity] – of the individual and of the whole.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The word Adam has in itself three names, three essences, three possibilites to rectify the sin of Adam HaRishon. The name of Adam HaRishon is an acronym for three names in Judaism: Adam, David and Moshiach <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shenei_Luchot_HaBerit%2C_Torah_Shebikhtav%2C_Toldot%2C_Torah_Ohr.58?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(see: Shenei Luchot HaBerit, Torah Shebikhtav, Toldot, Torah Ohr)</a></p>\n<p>The Shelah explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You may ask how it is that Joseph is included in the list of patriarchs, and even contributed more than the other patriarchs combined? The answer is that Joseph was the moral equal of all the other patriarchs combined, seeing that all our literature describes him as יוסף הצדיק, Joseph the righteous. In that capacity he \"illuminated the moon,\" the symbol of all that is feminine, more than any of the others. This is why he could contribute more years of life to David than all the others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What our sages said about Adam giving 70 years of his life to David is also true. The whole point of granting life to David was to repair the damage done to G–d's universe by Adam, without which a Messianic age and all its benefits to mankind would not be needed. Adam's צלם אלוקים, divine image, needed to be restored first and foremost through the constructive lives of the patriarchs. We explained all this in our commentary on Parshat Chayey Sarah. The 70 years Adam donated to David were \"illuminated,\" assumed a positive meaning through Jacob and Joseph having donated 70 years of their already meaningful lives. We have explained earlier that the \"beauty\" of Jacob was of the same quality as the beauty of Adam [before his sin, of course. Ed.]. Genesis 39,6 describes Joseph as: ויהי יוסף יפה תואר, he had handsome features for he evidently inherited these from his father, seeing Joseph is viewed as his father's replica. We have seen from Samuel I 16,12 that David's features are described in similar terms. Once the Messiah will arrive on earth, Adam will be rehabilitated completely, will be אד\"ם, the first letters respectively of the incarnations in אדם דוד משיח.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>According to Rav Kook, in order to rectify the sin of Adam HaRishon, the people must first recognise who they are, what they are doing wrong if they, G-d forbid, do a sin and then do teshuva. Our purpose is to fix ourselves, as the Midrash explains <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bereishit_Rabbah.11.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">(Bereishis Rabbah 11:6)</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He said to him: Anything created in the first six days, needs further actions, for example mustard seeds need sweetening, peas needs sweetening, wheat needs grinding, even humans need fixing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Rather, the righteous will sit with their crowns on their heads and delight in the radiance of the Divine Presence.\"</p>\n<p>(Touger translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>To clarify Alex's answer, the term \"world-to-come\" is ill-defined in Judaism, and for different authors, and different writings it means different eschatological stages. We can basically divide it into three distinctive realms:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Afterdeath</strong> - the world of souls</li>\n<li><strong>Post-Messianic</strong> earthy world</li>\n<li><strong>Post-Resuscitational</strong> world (unclear)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Usually, to have sex (as we know it, unless it's Bullock and Stallone in \"Demolition Man\") you need a functioning body. So automatically, option #1 is irrelevant.</p>\n<p>Regarding option #2 Rambam explicitly suggests that sex would be practiced during that era:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Our Sages have said that there is no difference between This World and the Days of the Messiah except (our) subservience to the kingdoms of the world alone.\" <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org.il/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Kings_and_Wars.12.2?vhe=Torat_Emet_363&lang=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh_Torah Kings_and_Wars.12.2</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Now regarding option #3, here Rambam somewhat hits the wall when he discusses the \"world-to-come\" in Hilchot Kings and Wars (ibid), and unlike his recap on the aforementioned Gemmora in Hilchot Teshuva, he states that not only that the future is impossible to know, but we have no tradition:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"But regarding all these matters and similar, no one knows how it will be until it will be. For these matters were unclear to the Prophets. Even <strong>the Sages themselves did not have a Tradition</strong> regarding these matters and only could attempt to understand the verses. Thus, there were disagreements in these matters.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So how do we resolve Rambam's discrepancy? My personal approach to reconciling two Rambams without refuting either statement is to declare some of his statements as \"educational\" and not \"factual\". Because he saw himself as an educator, many of his statements (Sefer Hamadah especially) focus on \"experiential truth\" rather than \"factual truth\". Just like we don't care to be precise when we instruct our kids (\"if you touch those wires you'll die\"), or like God, when he said: \"<em>for as soon as you eat of it, you shall die</em>.”</p>\n<p>Therefore, Alex's popular answer is not factual (as it refutes Rambam in Kings), but rather educational, meaning that undoubtedly, in some final idealistic form, there will only be the highest form of purely spiritual enjoyment, but the exact details are sealed.</p>\n<p>However, there's another option, that the sages (Berachot 17a and Rambam in Hil. Teshuva) did not refer to #2 and #3 on my list, but called afterlife \"the world-to-come\". And we're back to square one - to my opening sentence.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>NB: You asked about some mysticism. According to the Kabbalistic tradition, this world is the Tikkun to the primordial sin (i.g.

According to Josephus, Herod's father Antipater was the son of Antipas, one of the Edomites converted by Yochanan Hyrcanus. I asked one of the rabbis in my yeshiva and he said that though in the first place the conversion was problematic, בדיעבד it counts, which means that Herod's paternal side was Jewish. The problem starts with his mother Cypros, who, again according to Josephus, was born a Nabatean-Arab princess (<a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link142HCH0007\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Antiquities 14:7:3</a>). There is no evidence that she properly converted, though as the note there in the Gutenberg version <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2848/2848-h/2848-h.htm#link14note-12\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">states</a>, her name as it appears in Josephus is the Judaic/Hebraic version of the Greek name Cypris.<sup>1</sup></p>\n<p>Though I can't find it right now, I remember that the Talmud concludes that he was a \"Canaanite slave\", though I'm not really sure how that makes sense in light of Josephus - was that statement meant to be taken at face value? Yes, I'm aware that there are discrepancies between Josephus and the sages. But is that really the case here?</p>\n<p>Therefore, I was wondering whether anyone was aware of sources that discuss the status of Herod's Jewishness, other than the gemara. I'm particularly interested in sources that are familiar with what Josephus or other historians wrote about his lineage.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><sup>1</sup> Likewise, many Greek names were altered through the Second Temple and Talmudic eras' Hebrew/Jewish Aramaic, such as Nicodemus becoming Nakdimon.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p>Why did you reject :בבא בתרא ג? The גמרא seems pretty explicit.</p>\n<p>For example, Herod says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>אמר: מאן דריש ״מקרב אחיך תשים עליך מלך״? רבנן. קם קטלינהו לכולהו רבנן</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We see that he wasn't Jewish, because if he was Jewish, he wouldn't have to kill the רבנן.</p>\n\n\n",

(without implying it a revenge)</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p><strong>Halachah</strong>, that's what makes it justice. If you act halachicly you do justice, because that's what God called justice. If you act against the Halachah you're driven by your feelings.</p>\n<p>Indeed, reciprocity and retaliation are innate biological behaviors observed even with animals, so both revenge and justice come from the same biological urge. But the only difference between the two is whether it is sanctioned by the Torah or not. If it is, for example paying for damages (eye for an eye), it is considered justice, it is permitted and even a Mitzvah to do, if it is not - it is revenge (or driven by revenge) and it is prohibited.</p>\n<p>Here's a simple example: someone is calling you names and you know that no Rabbi allowed to call names back. So if you retaliate, you're taking revenge. But if the next day you consult your rabbi and he permits you to respond, you suddenly do justice. As I said, just because it was sanctioned by the Torah authority.</p>\n<p>So in your case, ask a rabbi, as his ruling will determine what your behavior is.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>It could be generalized, of course to other native behaviors - murdering is bad but stoning heretics is  Mitzvah, stealing is bad, but looting in war is good, adultery is bad but for heavenly purposes it's OK, breaking Shabbos is bad but for saving lives it's good, etc. Basically, we can not know apriori if certain behavior is good or bad until it is ruled Halachicly.</p>\n\n\n",

Furthermore, why is it juxtaposed to <em>“Abaye said, this Torah scholar”</em> etc., this is not related to these reasons, and our mishnah <em>“on the eve of fourteenth”</em> didn't state his words.</p>\n<p>והנה, כאשר הבינותי מדברי הר\"ן, פירוש הגמרא כך הוא, בשעה שבני אדם מצויים ואור הנר, כלומר ואור הנר ג\"כ מצוי אז, לפי שב\"א צריכין אז לנר להשתמש לאורו, ולכן נר מצוי אז בבתיהם, משא\"כ (מה שאין כן) בשעה אחרת, אפשר לא יהא נר מצוי לו.‏<br>\nAnd behold, as I understood from the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ran_on_Pesachim.1b.8\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">words of the Ran</a>, the interpretation of the gemara is like this: <em>“when people are found at home”</em> <em>“and the candlelight,”</em> that is to say <em>“and the candlelight”</em> is also there then, because people need then the candle to use its light, so candle can be found at that time in their houses, which is not like this at another hour, it is possible that there wouldn't be a candle.</p>\n<p>וא\"ת מאי מעליותא דנר,לזה אמר ואור הנר יפה לבדיקה.‏<br>\nAnd should you say, what is the excellence of the candle? For this he said <em>“and the candlelight is favourable for the search.”</em></p>\n<p>ונראה דשני הטעמים צריכי, לפי שמטעם בני אדם מצויין יהא כל הלילה זמן בדיקה, ודי אם יבדקנו קודם עלות השחר.‏<br>\nAnd it seems that two reasons are necessary, because of the reason <em>“people are found”</em> the whole night would be the time of the search, and it would be enough if we searched before dawn.</p>\n<p>לכך צריך לטעם שאור הנר מצוי אז, וזה דוקא בתחלת הלילה, שהיא זמן סעודה, ומאן דאית ליה סעודתא נכלי' כעין יממא ויש לו נר.‏<br>\nTherefore, the <em>“because the candlelight is there”</em> reason is needed, and it is especially at the beginning of the night, because it is a time of meal, <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.75b.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">and the one who has a meal should eat like during the day</a> and he has candle.</p>\n<p>וטעם הנר מצוי לחודו אי אפשר לומר, דהרי מ\"ט אור הנר מצוי אז. לפי שבני אדם מצויין בבתיה', (ו)צריך להם אור הנר להאיר חשכת לילה.‏<br>\nAnd the reason <em>“there is candle”</em> on its own cannot be said, because why can candlelight be found then? Because people are in their houses, and they need the candlelight to illuminate the darkness of the night.</p>\n<p>ושני הטעמים לדבר א' נתכוונו, ולפי זה שפיר אמר אביי הלכך, דאי ממשנתינו לא שמענו רק שיבדוק אור לי\"ד, וכל הלילה הוא אור ל(י)\"ד, אבל לטעמי' דרנב\"י שפיר אמר הלכך, דדלמא משכא שמעתתא ובין כך יכלה נר שבביתו, ואתי לאמנועי ממצות בדיקה לאור הנר.‏<br>\nAnd the two reasons were intended for one thing, and because of this it is right that <em>“Abaye said therefore,”</em> because from our mishnah we didn't learn just that one should search in the eve of the 14th, and the whole night is the eve of the 14th, but for the reasons of R' Nachman bar Yitzchak it is right that he said <em>“therefore,</em>” because he may be engrossed in the studies and in the meantime his candle in his house will be over, and he would come to neglect his duty of searching at the candlelight.</p>\n<p>ובזה מתורץ קושיית הב\"ח, שהקשה מ\"ש (מאי שנא) מק\"ש שמותר ללמוד קודם ק\"ש. ולדידי ניחא, דבשלמא ק\"ש יכול לקרות אח\"כ, משא\"כ (מה שאין כן) כאן שיש חשש שיכלה הנר שהכין. והט\"ז בסי' תל\"א נדחק בזה, והנלע\"ד (והנראה לפי עניות דעתי) כתבתי.‏<br>\nAnd in this stands the answer to the question of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Sirkis\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bach</a>, who raised the <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%98%D7%95%D7%A8_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%90#%D7%91%D7%99%D7%AA_%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9_(%D7%91%22%D7%97)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">question</a>, why is it different from the recital of the Shema, as it is permitted to learn before the recital of the Shema. And for me it is fine, because it is right that one may say the Shema afterwards, which is not like this here, as there is a concern that the candle will be over which he prepared. And the Taz on <a href=\"https://he.wikisource.org/wiki/%D7%A9%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%97%D7%9F_%D7%A2%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%90%D7%95%D7%A8%D7%97_%D7%97%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D_%D7%AA%D7%9C%D7%90_%D7%91\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">431:2</a> is a strained answer, and it seems in my humble opinion as I wrote.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><sub>This is my own translation, and I would much appreciate corrections and suggestions to improve it!</sub></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>You ask whether Abaye's observation not to start learning on the evening of the 13th going into the 14th is related to people being at home at that hour or the fact that it is ideal to perform the search with the light of the candle or is it unconnected with those reasons.</p>\n<p>It seems that the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.4a.8?lang=bi&with=Penei%20Yehoshua&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pnei Yehoshua</a> touches on this question when he says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>דלמאי דס\"ד מעיקרא היה באפשר לומר דלעולם אור היום טפי עדיף מאור הנר אלא\nכיון דתקנו זמן הבדיקה בליל י\"ד משום זריזות או משום שמתחיל הזמן תקנו\nשיבדוק לאור הנר וא\"כ לא היה מקום לאסור ליפתח בעידנא שאף אם יעבור ואתי\nלאמשוכי כל הלילה אפ\"ה יבדוק למחר אור היום משא\"כ השתא דקאמר ר\"נ ב\"י\nשאור הנר יפה לבדיקה טפי מאור היום דע\"כ זה עיקר הטעם לר\"נ דאי משום שבני\nאדם מצויין בבתיהם יבדוק בהשכמה קודם יציאתו מביתו דאז יותר מצויים\nבבתיהם אלא ע\"כ דעיקר הטעם דאור הנר יפה לבדיקה וא\"כ לא ליפתח כו' כנ\"ל</p>\n<p>We thought initially that daylight is better for searching than using\na candle. Then they fixed the time for searching as nighttime for\nwhatever reason and they instituted that searching should be done with\na candle. Even so there was no reason not to start learning on the\nnight of the 13th because even if one got involved in the learning\nthere was always the following morning to do the search. But now that\nRav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak says the light of the candle is better for\nsearching than daylight and that is the main reason of Rav Naḥman\n(because if the reason was that people would be found at home he could\njust as well search in the morning). <strong>So we see that the main reason\nfor searching at night is because  it is ideal to perform the search\nwith the light of the candle.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So one should not start learning on the evening of the 13th going into the 14th because it is ideal to perform the search with the light of the candle.</p>\n<p>This is also the way the Sefaria translation understands it</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara cites an answer to its initial question of why the search\nfor leaven is not conducted in the morning. Rav Naḥman bar Yitzḥak\nsaid: One searches for leaven in the evening as it is a time when\npeople are found in their homes, and they have the opportunity to\nperform the search. And furthermore, the light of the lamp is\nfavorable for conducting a search specifically at night. <strong>As the search\nis conducted with a lamp, it is preferable to search at night.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

Once we gain appreciation for maintaining the correct sense of fear it will inevitably remove a sense of recklessness as we act with a more measured approach.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>דע כי יש יראה ויש יראה: יש יראה ראויה ויש יראה שוטה, יש בטחון ויש הוללות</strong>. כי הנה האדון ברוך הוא עשה את האדם בעל שכל נכון וסברא נכוחה לשינהג עצמו על דרך טוב וישמר מן הדברים המזיקים אשר נבראו לענוש את הרשעים. ומי שירצה שלא ינהג עצמו בדרך החכמה ויפקיר עצמו לסכנות, הנה אין זה בטחון, אלא הוללות. והנה הוא חוטא במה שהוא נגד רצון הבורא יתברך שמו, שרוצה שישמור האדם את עצמו. ונמצא שמלבד הסכנה המוטבעת בדבר אשר הוא עלול אליה מפני חסרון שמירתו, הנה עוד הוא מתחיב בנפשו בקום עשה בחטא אשר הוא חוטא, ונמצא החטא עצמו מביאו ליענש ואולם השמירה הזאת, וזאת היראה המיוסדת על הנהגת החכמה והשכל, היא הראויה, שעליה נאמר (משלי כב): ערום ראה רעה ונסתר ופתיים עברו ונענשו</p>\n<p><strong>Know that there is fear and there is fear. There is justified fear and there is foolish fear. There is trust [in G-d] and there is recklessness</strong>. The L-rd, blessed be He, has made man with sound intellect and clear reasoning in order that he may guide himself in the right way and guard from harmful things which were created to punish the wicked. But someone who does not want to guide himself in an intelligent manner and exposes himself to dangers - this is not trust in G-d but rather foolishness. Such a person sins in that he is acting against the will of G-d who desires that a man guard himself. Hence, besides the inherent danger which he is exposing himself to due to failing to guard himself properly, he also actively brings punishment down upon himself for the sin which he commits. Thus the sin itself is what brings upon him the punishment. The type of fear and guarding of oneself which is appropriate is that which is based on the guidance of wisdom and reason. On this scripture says: \"the clever man sees the evil and escapes but the fool continues through and is punished\" (Mishlei 22:3). (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Rambam in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.1.4?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishneh Torah, Hilchos Deos 1:4</a> provides some helpful corrective advice. He notes that the ideal way of acting is to try and orient oneself to the more middle-of-the-road mentality. Meaning if a person finds that they get easily wound up, agitated, or in your case reckless, the best form of response is to try and work on an inner-compass. If you feel a sense of recklessness emerge, to try and recalibrate and try to revert to the middle ground. In so doing it prevents you from going to either extreme. In the case of recklessness that means, either reacting in an explosive manner and saying something you know you will regret, but at the same time also not being too meek and a pushover:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>הַדֶּרֶךְ הַיְשָׁרָה הִיא מִדָּה בֵּינוֹנִית שֶׁבְּכָל דֵּעָה וְדֵעָה מִכָּל הַדֵּעוֹת שֶׁיֵּשׁ לוֹ לָאָדָם. וְהִיא הַדֵּעָה שֶׁהִיא רְחוֹקָה מִשְּׁתֵּי הַקְּצָווֹת רִחוּק שָׁוֶה וְאֵינָהּ קְרוֹבָה לֹא לָזוֹ וְלֹא לָזוֹ. לְפִיכָךְ צִוּוּ חֲכָמִים הָרִאשׁוֹנִים שֶׁיְּהֵא אָדָם שָׁם דֵּעוֹתָיו תָּמִיד וּמְשַׁעֵר אוֹתָם וּמְכַוִּן אוֹתָם בַּדֶּרֶךְ הָאֶמְצָעִית כְּדֵי שֶׁיְּהֵא שָׁלֵם בְּגוּפוֹ. כֵּיצַד. לֹא יְהֵא בַּעַל חֵמָה נוֹחַ לִכְעֹס וְלֹא כְּמֵת שֶׁאֵינוֹ מַרְגִּישׁ אֶלָּא בֵּינוֹנִי. לֹא יִכְעֹס אֶלָּא עַל דָּבָר גָּדוֹל שֶׁרָאוּי לִכְעֹס עָלָיו כְּדֵי שֶׁלֹּא יֵעָשֶׂה כַּיּוֹצֵא בּוֹ פַּעַם אַחֶרֶת. וְכֵן לֹא יִתְאַוֶּה אֶלָּא לִדְבָרִים שֶׁהַגּוּף צָרִיךְ לָהֶן וְאִי אֶפְשָׁר לִהְיוֹת בְּזוּלָתָן כָּעִנְיָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (משלי יג כה) \"צַדִּיק אֹכֵל לְשֹׂבַע נַפְשׁוֹ\". וְכֵן לֹא יִהְיֶה עָמֵל בְּעִסְקוֹ אֶלָּא לְהַשִּׂיג דָּבָר שֶׁצָּרִיךְ לוֹ לְחַיֵּי שָׁעָה כָּעִנְיָן שֶׁנֶּאֱמַר (תהילים לז טז) \"טוֹב מְעַט לַצַּדִּיק\". וְלֹא יִקְפֹּץ יָדוֹ בְּיוֹתֵר. וְלֹא יְפַזֵּר מָמוֹנוֹ אֶלָּא נוֹתֵן צְדָקָה כְּפִי מִסַּת יָדוֹ וּמַלְוֶה כָּרָאוּי לְמִי שֶׁצָּרִיךְ. וְלֹא יְהֵא מְהוֹלֵל וְשׂוֹחֵק וְלֹא עָצֵב וְאוֹנֵן אֶלָּא שָׂמֵחַ כָּל יָמָיו בְּנַחַת בְּסֵבֶר פָּנִים יָפוֹת. וְכֵן שְׁאָר דֵּעוֹתָיו. וְדֶרֶךְ זוֹ הִיא דֶּרֶךְ הַחֲכָמִים. כָּל אָדָם שֶׁדֵּעוֹתָיו דֵּעוֹת (בֵּינוֹנִית) [בֵּינוֹנִיּוֹת] מְמֻצָּעוֹת נִקְרָא חָכָם:</p>\n<p>The straight path is the mean disposition found in each and every tendency of all the human tendencies.

He should not be an excitable person, easily angered; nor like the dead without feelings, but adopt a middle-course, not to become indignant, save only at something big which is worthy enough to be angry at, so that the like should not be done another time. Likewise shall he not crave for aught save the things which the body requires, and without which it is impossible to be, as the subject is spoken of: \"The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul\" (Pro. 13.25). Likewise shall he not continue to fatigue himself in his affairs, save to acquire what is necessary for him to live on for the time being as the subject is mentioned, saying: \"A little that a righteous man hath is better\" (Ps. 37.16). He should not be too close-fisted, nor yet squander his money, but give Z'dakah within the means of his hand, and lend accordingly to the needy. He should not be too optimistic and playful, nor too pessimistic and mournful, but spend all of his days in good cheer and with a pleasant countenance. So should he measure all the rest of his tendencies. And this path is the path of the wise men. Every man whose tendencies are mean tendencies of the middle-course, is called wise.

If someone is mapkid to wear two coverings if his hat blew off he is allowed to pick it up again between brachos if it causes him to lose kavanah. This is similar to the case of a siddur dropped during the amidah as brought forth in the other answer here.

I pointed out to him that tasks such as קיץ המזבח necessitated the continuous presence of at least a certain number of kohanim, so evidently, not all of the kohanim could leave the Mikdash.</p>\n<p>This got me wondering: Is there any estimate as to how many kohanim were needed for the basic upkeep of the Mikdash on a regular day? Detailed calculations welcome.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Yoma.2.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Mishnah</a> teaches us:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daily offering is sacrificed and its limbs are carried by nine priests, as mentioned in a previous mishna. These nine carry the limbs and the accompanying libations and meal-offerings. Occasionally, the service is performed by ten priests, occasionally by eleven, and sometimes by twelve priests; no fewer than nine and no more than twelve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura_on_Mishnah_Yoma.2.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> in his commentary on this Mishnah explains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>on every day, nine [priests]; six for the limbs and the innards, as we stated above (Mishnah 3) and one for the fine flour, and one for the baked cakes and one for the wine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Jerusalem_Talmud_Yoma.2.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yerushalmi Yoma 2:4</a> explains similary:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The daily sacrifice is brought by nine persons, by ten, by eleven, by twelve, neither less nor more.

The Mishna teaches, for example, that the korban tamid, which was the first sacrifice brought every day, was brought by nine, ten, eleven or twelve kohanim, depending on the day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The English explanation on the Mishnah <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/English_Explanation_of_Mishnah_Yoma.2.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">explains</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[The offering] itself by nine; In mishnah three we learned that it took nine priests to carry the various parts of the tamid offering up the ramp and then afterwards from the ramp to the altar. This referred to the morning tamid offering. As we shall see below in section four, the evening tamid required two more priests.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>At the festival [of Sukkot] in the hand of one a flask of water, behold there were ten. On Sukkot at the morning tamid they would also offer a water libation. We shall learn more about this water libation when we study Tractate Sukkah.</p>\n<p>In the evening by eleven: [The offering] itself by nine and in the hands of two men were two logs of wood. The evening tamid, offered at dusk, required eleven priests. Nine to carry the offering itself and two to carry about two logs of wood to add to the altar’s fires. They also added wood in the morning, but in the morning the wood was added by the priest who cleaned out the old ashes (see above mishayot 1-2). This was done before the tamid was offered.</p>\n<p>On Shabbat by eleven: [The offering] itself by nine, in the hands of two men two handfuls of incense for the showbread. On Shabbat the morning tamid also required eleven priests. Nine to offer the sacrifice itself and two to carry the incense which was offered every Shabbat in honor of the outgoing showbread (see Leviticus 24:6-7).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>There is even a Gemara that explains that sometimes, there were 17 Kohanim who perfomed the service (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.26b.11?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 26b</a>):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara asks with regard to Rabbi Ḥiyya’s statement: But wasn’t it taught in a baraita that sometimes there are seventeen priests involved in the daily offering?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/insites/yo-dt-026.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And see the explanation given by the Rosh Kollel of Kollel Iyun Hadaf of Yerushalayim: Rabbi Mordecai Kornfeld of </a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>RASHI explains that the Beraisa counts all of the Kohanim who were selected by the Payis to perform an Avodah specifically related to the Korban Tamid. The Avodah of the Machtah was not an Avodah related to the Korban Tamid, but to the Ketores. (In this case, two separate Payesos were conducted to select the Kohanim for the Avodos related to the Korban Tamid. The first 16 Kohanim were selected with the first Payis, and the Kohen who would bring the Evarim from the Kevesh to the Mizbe'ach was selected by the fourth Payis.)\nAn Avodah that is unrelated to the Korban Tamid (such as the Machtah) is not included in the Beraisa's count of Kohanim. Thus, the Beraisa which says that 17 Kohanim were selected cannot follow the view of Rebbi Eliezer ben Yakov, because he says that no Payis was done to select a Kohen to bring the Evarim to the Mizbe'ach.\nThe Rishonim reject this explanation. Whether or not the Beraisa follows Rebbi Yehudah is irrelevant. Even if the Beraisa disagrees with Rebbi Yehudah and maintains that an extra Kohen was selected by the Payis to bring the Machtah, that Avodah cannot be included in the count because it is not related to the Korban Tamid.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Tosfos on this Gemara explains the <a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/tosfos/yo-ts-026.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">following</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Implied question: The Reisha of the Reisha says that 13 Kohanim merited in it (the Tamid, and according to Rabanan, there are 14 including the one who brings limbs from the ramp to the Mizbe'ach</p>\n<p>Answer: We can answer that it is even like Rabanan. We count only the 13 who merit in the second lottery. The one who brings limbs from the ramp to the Mizbe'ach is in the fourth lottery by itself.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p><a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/tosfos/yo-ts-026.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">And</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Explanation #1: Rather, because we want to say \"no less and no more\", we say that <strong>no one holds that it is offered with less than nine</strong>. However, [even Rabanan hold that] <strong>it is not always 10</strong>;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\"it is offered wiht not less than nine\"- this seems to be the opinion of the Tosfos, but can also be found in the Gemara (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.26b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoma 26b</a>) \"The daily offering itself is sacrificed by nine\".</p>\n<p>See the commentary of <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Steinsaltz_on_Yoma.26b.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Steinsaltz</a> on this Gemara:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>בין הערבים בכל יום היו באים אחד עשר כהנים, כיצד? הוא קרבן התמיד עצמו היה נעשה בתשעה, ושנים נוספים שבידם שני גזירי עצים שהיו מניחים על המזבח, ומצות נתינת שני עצים על המזבח מיוחדת לבין הערבים בלבד. בשבת היה בא באחד עשר, כיצד? הוא עצמו בתשעה, ושנים נוספים שבידם שני בזיכי לבונה של לחם הפנים שאותם היו מקטירים ביום השבת. ובשבת שבתוך חג הסוכות נוסף להם עוד כהן כי ביד אחד צלוחית של מים לניסוך המים, הרי בסך הכל שנים עשר.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, based on the above, there were not less than 9 kohanim performing the services in the Beis HaMikdash. However, the Yerushalmi cited above says that the daily sacrifice is brought by 9,10,11 or 12. But no less or more. This I find puzzling, since the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tosafot_on_Yoma.26b.1.1?vhe=Vilna_Edition&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tosfos</a> writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>וגירסת הספרים ודלא כר' יהודה נ\"ל לפרש והתניא י\"ז פי' בכל בוקר היה י\"ז לכל הפחות ולא משכחת לה אא\"כ חשבת כל הכהנים הזוכין בכל הפייסות\nThe text in all Seforim is \"and not like R. Yehudah.\" I explain the question \"a Beraisa says 17\", i.e. every morning there were at least 17, and we find this only if you count all the Kohanim who merit in all the lotteries (<a href=\"https://dafyomi.co.il/yoma/tosfos/yo-ts-026.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">source for English translation</a>).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>So, to summarize, it seems to me that in the Gemara, there are different opinions, but the Tosfos seems to say that there were, on a regular day, 17 Kohanim performing the services, not only the Avodos of the Tamid, but all Avodos.</em></p>\n\n\n",

    "content": "# Spared from the pains of the birthpangs of Moshiach\n\n## Frage\n\n<p><strong>I am looking for some explanations given by modern commentators on the following question:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>The question is: why does studying Torah protects a person against the pains of the birthpangs of Moshiach?</strong> We study Torah, but there are still the birthpangs of Moshiach. Has this something to do with the following <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.97a.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Gemara</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Yoḥanan says: During the generation in which the Messiah, son of David, comes, Torah scholars decrease</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><em>Context of question:</em></p>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sanhedrin.98b.4?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sanhedrin 98b</a> states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rabbi Elazar’s students asked Rabbi Elazar: What shall a person do to be spared from the pains preceding the coming of the Messiah? Rabbi Elazar said to them: They shall engage in Torah study and acts of kindness.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The ArtScroll Gemara on this statement learns us (Sanhedrin 98b:1, footnote 9):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>by studying Torah, which is the ultimate good in the spiritual realm, and bestowing kindness, which is the ultimate good in the material realm, a person is completely protected against the evil of the travail of the Mashiach.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rosh_Hashanah.18a.9?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rosh Hashanah 18</a> a writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Go and engage in Torah study, in the merit of which you will live.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This explanation in Rosh Hashanah is also given by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Ahavat_Chesed%2C_Foreword?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Ahavat Chesed</a>.</p>\n<p>In the sefer <a href=\"https://beta.otzar.org/#/book/179692/p/160/t/0.95954175320910371234/fs/DJA77wolDs7bRtRuioAaq094N0bB0PvoTneSRAbcfa0Q/start/9317/end/9559/c\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">מבשר טוב - כח קיום ישראל</a> found at Otzar HaChochma, it writes, please correct me if I'm wrong, but that studying (learning) Torah, is as if a person brings an offering to the altar. Is this the reason why studying Torah protects a person against the pain from the birthpangs of Moshiach?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### ✅ Antwort 1 (Score: 4)\n\n<p>This is an observation that the Chofetz Chaim addresses in his Likkutim in his Kuntres on Talmid Torah (see <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21077&st=&pgnum=125&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>) where he brings the Gemara from Sanhedrin. However, whilst he points out the importance of Torah study he does not mention how it actually saves a person.</p>\n<p>Perhaps a good starting point, at least on a simple level, is the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanna_Debei_Eliyahu_Rabbah.18.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tanna DeVei Eliyahu, chapter 18</a> which notes that Hashem himself makes a point of protecting someone who learns Torah and therefore one who engages in Torah study can rest assured knowing they have a personal, Divine protection guaranteed.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל העוסק בתורה אינו רואה מדת פורעניות בין בעוה\"ז בין לימות בן דוד ובין לעוה\"ב</p>\n<p>Anyone who engages in Torah will not see the measure of punishment whether in This World or whether in the days of (Moshiach) ben Dovid or whether in the Next World.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>With this in mind we can now draw on Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Ruderman zt\"l who writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sichot_Avodat_Levi.5.10?vhe=Sichot_Avodat_Levi,_Baltimore,_2018&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sichos Avodas HaLevi</a> that the learning of Torah provides basic zechuyos (merits) that ensures that one is saved from harm:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>והנה זכות לימוד התורה מצלת את האדם מן הדין [וכעין מה שאמרו חז\"ל (סנהדרין צ\"ח ב') \"מה יעשה אדם וינצל מחבלו של משיח, יעסוק בתורה ובגמילות חסדים\"]. נלך ונתחזק בלימוד התורה ונתפלל להקב\"ה שיציל את כלל ישראל, ובעז\"ה נזכה להגאל בקרוב</p>\n<p>And behold the merit of learning the Torah saves a person from din, like Chazal say (Sanhedrin 98b) \"What should a person do that he will be saved from the birth pangs of Moshiach - he should engage in Torah study and acts of kindness\". So let us go and strengthen in Torah study and we will pray to G-d that he will save Klal Yisroel and with Hashem's help we will merit to be redeemed soon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This idea segues well with another quote from Tanna Devei Eliyahu, this time in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Tanna_Debei_Eliyahu_Rabbah.4.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chapter 4</a> where it writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>כל ת\"ח שעוסק בתורה בכל יום תמיד בשביל להרבות כבוד שמים אינו צריך לא חרב ולא חנית ולא כל דבר שיהיה לו שומר אלא הקב\"ה משמרו בעצמו ומלאכי השרת עומדין סביב לו וחרב ביד כולם ומשמרין אותו שנאמר (תהילים קמט) רוממות אל בגרונם וחרב פיפיות בידם וגו' חיים שלא בצער ושלא ביצר הרע לימות בן דוד ולעולם הבא</p>\n<p>Every sage who engages in Torah constantly every day to increase the honour of heaven will not need neither a sword, nor a spear, not anything for his protection, because Hashem Himself will watch over him and the ministering angels will encircle him with a sword in each of their hands guarding him, as it says, (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.149.6?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Tehillim 149</a>) “The exaltation of Hashem is in their throat and a double edged sword in their hand.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So we see that the act of learning Torah affords a person personal G-dly protection and that is why a person who learns Torah does not have to fear the birth pangs of Moshiach as Hashem serves as his personal bodyguard!</p>\n<p>In a similar context, this idea is also supported in a midrash in the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Yalkut_Shimoni_on_Nach.42.12?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yalkut Shimoni (on Nach) 42</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>במי הקב\"ה מושיע את ישראל בבני אדם שמשכימין ומעריבין לב\"ה ולבית המדרש ועוסיקין בתורה בכל יום תמיד</p>\n<p>Through whom does Hashem save the Jews? Through those that get up early and  frequent the shuls and study hall and engage in Torah throughout the day.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<hr />\n<p>Another approach I saw mentioned in the name of the Maharal <a href=\"https://www.torahmusings.com/2016/12/maharals-yemot-hamashiach-getting-roots/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a> by R' Gidon Rothstein. He writes there as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>That same Gemara has Abbaye reminding Rabbah that a person who is involved in Torah and acts of kindness can feel confident that s/he will be spared the troubles of Yemot HaMashiach. For Maharal, that’s because Torah is a non-physical good, while kindnesses are done in the physical world; a person who does both is combining the two so well that a move from a largely physical world to one where that’s not the central factor will not be as traumatic as for others...</p>\n<p>Two assumptions important to Maharal’s views here are that change is always difficult and, largely, undesirable, and that the highest level is simplicity. Torah and acts of kindness, in his view, have the quality of peshitut, simplicity, and involve no change, so that one involved in those two has reached a stable high level.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When trying to trace the source of this point I came across the Maharal in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Netzach_Yisrael.36.5?vhe=Netzach_Yisrael&lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Netzach Yisroel 36</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ומצד הפשיטות שיש באלו שתי מדות נצול מן חבלי המשיח, שהוא שנוי בעולם. כי הפשיטות אין בו שנוי</p>\n<p>And from the point of simplicity, there is in these two attributes (i.e. Torah and chessed) the means to be saved from the birth pangs of Moshiach since there is change in the world but these in their simplicity never change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The Maharal there alludes to the fact that this idea is also mentioned in his Gevuros Hashem but I am yet to find the source.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/naaux.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/naaux.png\" alt=\"This is from the weekly email of Reb Itche Meir Morgenstern Shlita.\" /></a></p>\n<p>I don't know if this will answer your question directly. However, I think it is very important to add to the conversation.</p>\n<p>This is an excerpt from one of Reb Itche Meir Morgenstern Shlita's weekly emails. (To be precise, it's from Parshas Mikeitz 5781.) It is part of the Nishmasin Chaditin section of the email. It is where they record many things the Tzaddik said over in a particular week.</p>\n<p>I'll try to translate to the best of my ability.</p>\n<p>He (The Rebbe) spoke on which is brought in the Zohar Hakadosh in the beginning of our Parshah, which speaks about the concept that there are two end of times. The Zohar says there is an end of times which comes from the right, which is associated with the holy side of things. And there is a end of times associated with the verse of \"The end of all flesh\" (Genesis 6, 13), which is associated with the evil side of things.</p>\n<p>The Rebbe explained. There are people in which depression overtakes them, which causes them to worry about the future. Therefore, they depict all of the circumstances of the world, that it will come to obliteration and wars in which the whole world would be destroyed, etc. God forbid</p>\n<p>However, in truth all of these things don't have to happen. Even though we find prophecies and statements of our sages regarding the wars of Gog Umagog. (Which speak about these ideas that the world will come to a state of destruction at the end of time). You don't have to believe they will come true, since it's already brought in the Rambam, that a prophecy which describes punishments isn't required to be fulfilled.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is known from many statements of the true Tzaddikim, in which they state clearly that the lengthening and hardships of the exile, sweetened the \"birth pangs of Moshiach\". With this, they explained that this is the reason which Hashem lengthened the exile so much. In order that in the end when Moshiach will come, it will be with no destructions, wars or killings, God forbid. Rather by way of simple compassion and revealed kindness.</p>\n<p>With the way of repairing the world and removing the spirit of impurity. By removing the sins, not the sinners. As is described by our sages. That is, Hashem will pour a pure spirit and spray on us pure waters. And through this, everyone will return with a complete Teshuvah out of love.</p>\n<p>Similarly, it is brought from the Baal Shem Tov, Rebbi Nachman, Reb Elimelech of Lizhensk and many other Tzadikkim. (Many of these sources are brought in the Sefer Dor Achahron.)</p>\n<p>However, the depression, which is entrenched in these people (who constantly make negative predictions about the future), pulls them not to accept the words of the Tzadikkim. And they will continue to depict the future in a way of destruction.</p>\n<p>This is what the Zohar Hakadosh refers to, when he says the verse of \"The end of all flesh\" (Genesis 6, 13) comes from the side of evil in the world.</p>\n<p>And in truth, someone who falls into the aforementioned depression. is destined (God forbid) to ruin one of the foundations of Jewish faith. For the nature of a person is, that he can only hope for something which he desires, since he knows (that this which he desires) is only good and kindness. However, those who depict the end of times in a depiction which is negative are destroying the anticipation for redemption. Which is one of the foundations of Jewish faith. Which is so severe, that the Rambam states that one who doesn't anticipate the redemption, his judgment is extremely harsh. Since he is considered a heretic in all of the Torah and the Prophets.</p>\n<p>(Translators note: I don't think the Rebbe is bringing this down to make anyone feel they are a heretic, God forbid. Since all that would do is pull the person further away from the service of God. Rather, I believe he brings this Rambam to show the severity of the matter at hand. God forbid for someone to think they are a heretic. Since the purpose of these harsh statements is not to label ourselves. Rather, they are there to give us an understanding of the importance of the matter at hand.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, the Tzadikkim work to suppress the evil end of times under the holy end of times. For the way of Tzadikkim is to strengthen themselves with faith in the kindness of Hashem, and with TRUE yearning that Hashem will bring the end of days from a place of kindness. And they teach all their listeners to strengthen themselves like this. And through this very hope will help speed up the redemption in a way of open and revealed goodness.</p>\n<p>As our sages teach us, \"if Klal Yisroel will only have the merit of the hope and anticipation for redemption, they will get redeemed through this very merit.\"</p>\n<p>I tried translating to the best of my abilities. I definitely didn't do anything close to a perfect job. Therefore, I want to make it clear that all mistakes, misunderstanding and errors etc. should be attributed to me and me alone. And God forbid, to the Holy Tzaddik Reb Itche Meir Morgenstern Shlita, and his holy students. Additionally, some of the concepts mentioned here are sourced in Kabbalah, making it very hard to translate literally.</p>\n<p>In summary, the point I am trying to bring is, many have people a false understanding of what Ikvisa Dimeshicha (birth pangs of Moshiach) actually represents. And the repercussions of one who misunderstands what Ikvisa Demeshicha represents.</p>\n<p>The main point is that we should continue to hope and anticipate for the day which Hashem's full glory will be revealed in the most awesome and loving way!</p>\n\n\n",

Rabbi Rosenfeld (n.d.) explains that a person should have humility and not flaunt his blessings. One who shows off draws the attention of others and incites them to jealousy. By doing this, the person may cause the Heavenly court to reconsider the good fortune bestowed on the flaunter. Several commentaries note that the sages did not intend to harm Rabbi Acha but this resulted from their surprise at his amazing achievement. In any case, the lesson to be learned from this story is to be discreet with one’s accomplishments and not boast about them. The Talmud frowned on ostentation (see Friedman, 2002).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When looking into this more deeply, a different idea emerges that it wasn't so much him flaunting his successes, but rather it was his successes that perhaps made him more bold in his actions. This resulted in him acting on a level that he was not able to do so, which brought about his untimely death.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Batra.14a.6?lang=bi&p2=Chidushei_Chatam_Sofer_on_Bava_Batra.14a.2&lang2=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Chiddushei Chasam Sofer</a> writes as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>רב אחא בר יעקב כ' חד וכו' ונח נפשי' אולי חשבו שע\"י השבעת שם נזדמן לו כך ולא חשבוהו ראוי לשמש בשמו' ע\"כ יהבו בי עיני' ונח נפשי' כדפי' הרע\"ב על ודאשתמש בתגא חלף ע\"ש וברמ\"א י\"ד סס\"י רמ\"ו ובש\"ך שם סק\"ו:</p>\n<p>Rav Acha bar Yaakov...and he died - Perhaps they thought that through the swearing in of a name (i.e. the sheim Hashem) happened to him and he was not considered worthy to use His name. Therefore the Sages looked at him and he died - like the explanation of Rav Ovadia Bartenura on the words \"One who makes [unworthy] use of the crown [of learning] shall pass away\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.13?vhe=Torat_Emet_357&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pirkei Avos 1:13</a>) over there. And in the Rema YD 246, and the Shach there in seif kattan 6.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Taking our cue from this, the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bartenura_on_Pirkei_Avot.1.13.5?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bartenura</a> on pirkei avos writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"And one uses the taga (crown)\": One who makes use of the crown of Torah in the way a man uses his tools, passes and leaves the world. And there are those that explain taga to be the initials of talmid gavra acharina (the student of another man), as it is forbidden to take service from students that are not his students. And I have heard, \"'And one uses the taga,' meaning to say one who makes use of [God's] explicit name passes and is lost, as he does not have a share in the world to come.\" (Sefaria translation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So it would seem, however we are meant to understand it, that Rav Acha whether knowingly or not, did not \"use\" Torah in the appropriate way and that led to his ultimate downfall.</p>\n<p>Based on the Rema in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Shulchan_Arukh%2C_Yoreh_De%27ah.246.21?vhe=Ashlei_Ravrevei:_Shulchan_Aruch_Yoreh_Deah,_Lemberg,_1888&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Yoreh Deah 246</a> I came across the Avos D'Rebbi Nosson which ties in with the Chiddushei Chasam Sofer above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ודאשתמש בתגא אבד ואזיל ליה כיצד שכל המשתמש בשם המפורש אין לו חלק לעולם הבא</p>\n<p>He who uses it as a crown, perishes, and then it is lost to him. How so? For anyone who uses the Ineffable Name of God has no share in the World to Come.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So conceivably, he used the sheim Hashem but wasn't on the level to use it which possibly led to his death.</p>\n<hr />\n<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>\n<p>I saw another more esoteric approach in the Chazon Ish, Choshen Mishpat - Bava Basra in the <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=14332&st=&pgnum=508&hilite=\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Likuttim siman 21</a> (see half way down the right column with the bolded word \"sham\") which demonstrates the power of ayin hara which does not negate Rav Acha's piety or tzidkus (and therefore preserves a good view of him unlike the first answer). In short, <strong>Hashem's hashgacha is often performed by a tool called the ayin hara which was triggered in this case causing Rav Acha to die.</strong></p>\n<p>He writes there:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שם יהבו ביה רבנן עינייהו ונח נפשיה\nמסודות הבריאה כי האדם במחשבתו הוא מניע גורמים נסתרים בעולם המעשה ומחשבתו הקלה תוכל לשמש גורם\nלהרס ולחרבן של גשמים מוצקים וכדאמר פסחים דף נ' ב' כיון דנפיש אפחזייהו שלטא בהו עינא ובב\"מ פ\"ד א' לא מסתפי מר מעינא בישא</p>\n<p>The Sages looked at him and he died - The secrets of creation are such that man in his mind motivates hidden factors in the world of action, and his light/simple thoughts can serve as a cause of destructive rains. Like we say in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Pesachim.50b.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Pesachim 50b</a> \" Since their volume is great, the evil eye dominates them\" (i.e. because he has such bulky merchandise it appears like he has a quite significant business which can bring an ayin hara), and in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.84a.10?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 84a</a> \"Isn’t the Master worried about (being harmed by) the evil eye (by displaying yourself in this manner)?\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So the Chazon Ish explains that human thought can influence and impact on the physical world in a  destructive way.</p>\n<p>He continues that sometimes while humans admire a successful reality they actually place that reality in jeopardy.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ובשעה שבני אדם מתפעלים על מציאות מוצלחה מעמידים את מציאות זו בסכנה</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As a result, the Chazon Ish reasons that הכל בידי שמים - everything is in the hands of Heaven, and anything that is not decreed with heavenly judgement to be lost/removed is accordingly saved. However, if that thing has indeed been judged to be \"lost\"/removed than the end result is sometimes rolled over on to an \"עין תמהון\" - \"wondering eye(?)\" and it is through this that the thing comes to an end.</p>\n<p>He explains based on <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Bava_Metzia.107b.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Bava Metziah 107b</a> the overwhelming power of the evil eye and how it is responsible for death far more than normal natural death. The Gemara there reads:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara returns to expounding the themes of blessings and the evil eye. The Torah states: “And the Lord will take away from you all sickness” (Deuteronomy 7:15). In interpreting this verse, Rav says: This verse is speaking about the evil eye. The Gemara comments: Rav conforms to his line of reasoning, as Rav went to a graveyard, and did what he did, i.e., he used an incantation to find out how those buried there died, and he said: Ninety-nine of these died by the evil eye, and only one died by entirely natural means. (Sefaria translation & notation)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He explains the Gemara to mean that when they were sentenced to death on Yom Kippur, they were confronted by an evil eye and it was that \"rolled\" on their death.</p>\n<p>As a result he concludes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>וכן ראב\"י כשהגיע זמנו ליפטר מן העולם ונגזר עליו זמנו גלגלו מן השמים סיבת מותו ע\"י הערת תמהון בלב רבנן</strong></p>\n<p><strong>And similarly, with Rav Acha bar Yaakov when his time came to depart from the world and his time was decreed, the cause of his death was rolled up from heaven by a note of astonishment in the heart of Rabbanan.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>So in short, I believe this is saying that Rav Acha bar Yaakov was due to die but there needed to be a reason for this death to come about and this presented itself when the Rabbonim looked on at him with wonder, which initiated some sort of ayin hara which duly triggered his death.</strong></p>\n\n\n",

Therefore, it may be the case that he did not think it was necessary to provide names of opinions, because he just wanted to give a quick summary. \"The is the mishna, this is the gemara, some explain like this, some explain like this, and the halacha is like this\".</p>\n\n\n",

In the work <a href=\"https://hebrewbooks.org/45081\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">עלבונה של תורה</a> this is listed as one of the cases of Christians corrupting our writings. The \"new Torah\" is meant to provide justification for the New Testament.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xksBo.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.sstatic.net/xksBo.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>In the general case, yes, sometimes midrashim absolutely interpret pesukim which are in variance with the masoretic text, and which we can find in the Septuagint, or the Samaritan text, or the Dead Sea Scrolls. I've written about this extensively, and <a href=\"https://parsha.blogspot.com/2010/03/did-entire-word-fall-out-of-torah-pt-ii.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">linked is one such example</a>.</p>\n<p>So, it is not impossible that Rabbi Avin bar Kahana (a third/fourth generation Amora of Eretz Yisrael) had an alternative text before him. Supporting this read is that the midrash, in the version as we have it, seems to take the Biblical phrase and interpret it. So תּוֹרָה חֲדָשָׁה coming from Hashem is interpreted not as a new Torah supplanting the old, but as חִדּוּשׁ תּוֹרָה, an innovation within Torah.</p>\n<p>However, while variants certainly crept into the Biblical text, there was an internal process by which scribes attempted to maintain the integrity of the Biblical text. There were codices such as the one kept in the Temple Courtyard, and later the Leningrad and Aleppo Codex, and others. This is not the case for the text of gemaras, midrashim, and so on. If so, the error could also plausibly be in the midrashic text, rather than in the verse it quotes. Especially since we don't know of any extant variant text of Yeshaya (I checked Vetus Testamentum) that has this change, and we don't even see this in Christian translations, where they have all the reason to maintain this variant.</p>\n<p>Indeed, in the Beur Maharif on Vayikra Rabba, by Rabbi Yechezkel Feivel, the Maggid of Vilna, he asserts that the midrashic text is erroneous and that the correct text doesn't have חֲדָשָׁה in the Biblical citation. I have not checked variant manuscripts of the midrash, and I don't know if he based himself on logic (that that isn't the Biblical text) or on some extant manuscript of the midrash.</p>\n<p>If the word חֲדָשָׁה isn't present in the citation within the midrash, the interpretation still can work. The derasha is based on the word תֵצֵא in the imperfect (that is, future) tense. With that, the verse implies that Torah comes forth from Hashem in the future. This is thus a new Torah. And Rabbi Avin b. Kahana essentially says that this refers to innovations in Torah.</p>\n\n\n",

I'm not necessarily talking about either of those. I'm referring to the fact that even after the close of the Bible there continue to be stories about divine voices or statements that God said to certain Rabbis.

His doctor urged him to make lifestyle changes, but who had the motivation for that?</p>\n<p>And then he chanced upon some information that would eventually change his life — that the Rambam had a lot to say about health. A mild curiosity evolved into a seven-year megaproject that involved tracking down and studying the translations of all ten of the Rambam’s medical works, and then creating a user-friendly diet approach based on those principles that has helped thousands lose weight and keep it off.</p>\n<p>Zulberg, today a popular media personality and certified health coach and fitness specialist, wrote three books on health (The Life Transforming Diet, The 5 Skinny Habits, and The Mind Body Synergy Diet) and designed his food plan around the three main health principles of the Rambam: food quantity, exercise, and food quality, in that order.</p>\n<p>Regarding portion size: “<strong>Overeating is like poison to the body</strong> and it is the main cause of all illness… One should not eat until his stomach is full. Rather, [he should stop when] he is close to three-quarters satiated” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.4.15?ven=Maimonides%27_Mishneh_Torah,_edited_by_Philip_Birnbaum,_New_York,_1967&lang=bi\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam, Mishnah Torah, Hilchos Deios</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>The Rambam says that overeating puts a strain on the digestive system that with time will lead to various illnesses. Based on recent studies, the Mayo Clinic, American Obesity Association, and American Diabetes Association have all urged reducing food quantity for improved health.</strong></p>\n<p>Regarding exercise: “<strong>Without exercise, a good diet alone is not sufficient</strong>, and eventually medical treatment will be needed” (Rambam, Medical Aphorisms). “Exercise repels the damage done by most of man’s bad habits” (Rambam, Regimen of Health).</p>\n<p>The Rambam defines exercise as physical activity that raises the rate of respiration. The best time to exercise, he says, is at the beginning of the day, before a person eats; exercising after a meal impairs digestion and can lead to illness.</p>\n<p>Regarding food quality: “<strong>Most illnesses are caused by unhealthy foods</strong>” (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Mishneh_Torah%2C_Human_Dispositions.4.15?ven=Maimonides%27_Mishneh_Torah,_edited_by_Philip_Birnbaum,_New_York,_1967&lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rambam, Hilchos Deios</a>).</p>\n<p>Remarkably, the most current knowledge of various foods’ effects on health, brought to light in recent years, was spelled out by the Rambam during the Middle Ages. For example, writes the Rambam, “Foods to be limited include flour that has been sifted until no bran remains (white flour). Fatty food should be avoided… it cleaves to the organs. The best type of cheese is that which is made from milk whose fat has been removed. Of the different types of meat, one should choose fowl… other harmful products include fried pastries….”</p>\n<p>To reduce food quantity, and in line with the Rambam’s belief that a person should only eat two main meals a day, one meal a day on the Life Transforming Diet consists of either just fruit, or just vegetables (this wouldn’t count as a meal according to the Rambam, but gives one a way to eat the three “meals” a day to which our society is accustomed).</p>\n<p>The Rambam suggests eating a single dish at a meal. Digesting various foods at the same time, he maintains, has a deleterious effect on digestion and can lead to illness (there are conflicting viewpoints on this point among nutritionists today). In addition, every food eaten stimulates the appetite separately. When only a single food is eaten, according to the Rambam, the appetite is satiated earlier, and this will prevent overeating. Indeed, multiple published studies have substantiated the Rambam’s claim, showing that food consumption increases when there is more variety at a meal, and that increased food variety is associated with increased body weight. One such study published in Health Psychology in 2008 showed that children presented with a variety of foods at a meal ate 42 percent more than those presented with a single food.</p>\n<p>Because of this, one of the two main meals a day on Zulberg’s plan is either primarily protein, or primarily carbohydrate, but the two are generally not combined. Vegetables can be eaten with either choice. The third meal of the day can include both starch and protein. Eating this way, according to Zulberg, will naturally reduce a person’s appetite, resulting in automatic weight loss.</p>\n<p>But food is only half the equation — the other half is exercise. According to Zulberg, cardiovascular and strengthening exercises should be done five times a week. He believes that those who follow his plan will benefit from the Rambam’s wisdom and gain the benefits of better health and a more energetic constitution.</p>\n<p>The Rambam, who lived from 1135 to 1204, was not only one of the greatest Torah scholars in Jewish history, but was also known as the greatest medical expert of his time. While living in Egypt, he had a thriving private practice to which people flocked from great distances. By age 39, he served as royal physician in the court of Sultan Saladin, famed Muslim military leader who fought the Crusaders and later became ruler of Egypt. The Rambam authored ten major medical works in Arabic, which combined his extensive knowledge of the ancient works of Greek physicians such as Hippocrates and Galen with the most current medical knowledge of his own time. An extensive amount of the Rambam’s medical advice proves to be remarkably current, some even at the vanguard of health conversation today (for example, the Rambam suggests eating only free-range cattle).</p>\n<p>In addition to his medical tomes, some of the Rambam’s halachic works, such as Hilchos Deios in the Mishnah Torah, are laden with medical directives, although that doesn’t necessarily give them halachic weight. “The Maharshal in Chullin says that it’s assur to cite medical advice from the Gemara, lest it not work and will besmirch the good names of those quoted,” says Rabbi Moshe Plutchok, rav of Congregation Shaarei Torah in Manhattan Beach, Brooklyn, an eminent talmid chacham with a broad base of historical knowledge. “The Rambam heeded this, and never quoted from the Talmud in his medical works. The general consensus among poskim is that these medical directives are not halachically binding.”</p>\n<p><strong>Still, the main health principles of the Rambam are substantiated with current research and are universally agreed upon today, says Zulberg.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The article also notes the impact of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj1-N6gkpH1AhUCQkEAHbQdBzoQFnoECAIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.israelnationalnews.com%2FArticles%2FArticle.aspx%2F18946&usg=AOvVaw1EoSjK28lo2hm-XDOSLR6X&cshid=1641060379197566\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Rabbi Yechezkel Ishayek</a>, a close talmid of Rav Shach, and his book <em><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/9659092326\" rel=\"noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">To Your Health - The Torah Way to a Healthy Life in Modern Times</a></em> which is largely based on the Rambam's diet and has since been translated into 6 languages and has sold in excess of 150,000 copies a sure sign that the Rambam's outlook towards food is as relevant as ever.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 3)\n\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7571434/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Segal, I., & Blazer, S.

This must be taken into consideration when considering the recommendations of Maimonides. For example, there was no refrigeration or pasteurization, and the cause of most diseases was unknown. Despite this, what is most interesting is that many of his recommendations remain true today. This is remarkable given the available knowledge and customs of his time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The fact that most of Maimonides’ nutritional recommendations are basically accepted by some of the major authorities worldwide is remarkable. Maimonides based his recommendations on astute observation of his patients throughout decades of medical practice. The only total disagreement between the modern recommendations and Maimonides relates to the consumption of fresh fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Hence it is important to understand his rationale for these recommendations (Segal, I., & Blazer, S., 2020).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>See table 1 for agreements between the Rambam's recommendations and the contemporary recommendations.</strong></p>\n<p>Similary, the Rambam (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.3.2?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemonah Perakim 3:2</a>) writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Likewise, just as when people, unacquainted with the science of medicine, realize that they are sick, and consult a physician, who tells them what they must do, forbidding them to partake of that which they imagine beneficial, and prescribing for them things which are unpleasant and bitter, in order that their bodies may become healthy.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The end-goal of all the advices the Rambam gives, especially in his Hilchot De'ot, but also in Shemonah Perakim, is in order to preserve of bodily health (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Eight_Chapters.5.2?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shemonah Perakim 5:2</a>)</p>\n<p>Reference list</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Segal, I., & Blazer, S.

On the other hand, the Jews were exiled to numerous cities in the Babylonian kingdom, not just \"the city\".</p>\n<p>Why does the prophet use \"city\" and not \"kingdom\"?</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 1)\n\n<p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson_Raphael_Hirsch\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch</a> in his <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nineteen_Letters.16.3?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nineteen Letters</a> writes on this pasuk in Jeremiah that \"And seek the peace of the city whither I have exiled you, and pray for it to the Lord, for in its peace there will be unto you peace.\"- means that</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"it is our duty to join ourselves as closely as possible to the state\nwhich receives us into its midst, to promote its welfare and not to\nconsider our well-being as in any way separate from that of the state\nto which we belong.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>It seems that Rabbi Hirsch is connecting this pasuk to the idea of אור לגויים.</p>\n<p>Thus, the meaning of \"And seek the welfare of the city to which I have exiled you and pray to the LORD in its behalf\" seems to mean that we are meant to \"exhibit to mankind a better example of \"Israel\" than did our ancestors the first time\". By doing this, \"the entire race will be, hand in hand with us, joined in universal brotherhood through the recognition of G-d, the All-One\" (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Nineteen_Letters.16.7?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Nineteen Letters, 16:7</a>).</p>\n<p>Similary, the following explanation is given by the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Haamek_Sheilah_on_Sheiltot_d%27Rav_Achai_Gaon%2C_Kidmat_HaEmek%2C_Part_I.13.1?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Haamek Sheilah on Sheiltot d'Rav Achai Gaon, Kidmat HaEmek, Part I 13:1</a> in the commentary on the pasuk in Isaiah 60:3.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>FOR THE SAKE of [Israel’s] righteousness,1 G-d desired to sharpen the glittering sword of Torah and to enlarge the Torah and its splendor.

It was a land [whose inhabitants] had not seen the well-arranged light of tradition, [and they therefore] needed to search for the doorway of the palace2 through examination and analysis. They toiled and discovered a new path that [shone] as brilliantly as the sun.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So, it seems to me that the idea of \"And seek the peace of the city whither I have exiled you, and pray for it to the Lord\" learns us to make sure the \"cities\" we live in, discover the \"new path\"- e.g. the path of Torah and that will bring them closer to G-d.</p>\n\n\n### Antwort 2 (Score: 0)\n\n<p>A good reason to specify to seek the welfare of the city and not the empire/state/kingdom: A city is characterized by the spectrum of society living together. An empire is characterized by a big hierarchy with the emperor on the top. If you disregard the wellbeing of the subjects while trying to get favor with the emperor, you create a tension that will one day snap in your face.</p>\n<p>In Joseph's Egypt and in all of the places Jews have lived in Christendom until Emancipation, Jews have fulfilled a role in which they serve as a go between between the King and the peasants. Moneychangers, moneylenders, tax farmers, landlords, tax collectors, \"arrendator\"s. They served as the instrument by which the nobility would extract wealth from the peasants and burghers (townies).</p>\n<p>When the milk hits the fleisch, the nobility would cast aside the Jews and the peasants would take out their anger against them (because it was the Jews, not the king, who would hassle them)</p>\n<p>You should also seek the benefit of the emperor but the prophet doesn't need to warn you because it's obvious.

(On this basis, one can estimate the future size of Jerusalem.)\"</p>\n<p>And it says in the Midrash that which it writes in <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Song_of_Songs.7.5?lang=bi&with=all&lang2=en\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Shir HaShirim 7:5</a> -  \"Your nose is like the Lebanon tower that faces toward Damascus.\" which teaches that <strong>in the future the gates of Yerushalayim will reach as far as Damasacus</strong>. And it says in the Midrash (<a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Sifrei_Devarim.1.20?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sifrei, Devarim 1</a>) \"A pronouncement: The word of the LORD.

Yossi b. Dormaskith said to him: Yehudah, why do you distort the verses for us? I testify by heaven and earth that I am from Damascus and there is a place called Chadrach there. And how do I understand \"and Damascus is (its) resting place\"? (As meaning) that Yerushalayim is destined to extend until Damascus; \"(its) resting place\" is Jerusalem, as it is written (Psalms 132:19) \"This (Jerusalem) is My resting place forever.\" And similarly it says: \"Your nose is like the Lebanon tower that faces toward Damascus\".</p>\n<p>Furthermore it is brought in the Midrash that <strong>in the future Jerusalem will reach to the ocean</strong>. And the Abarbanel already brings this in his explanation on Yeshaya (siman 49).

The ministering angels said before the Holy One, Blessed be He: Master of the Universe, You have created many cities in Your world for the nations of the world, and You did not give the measure of their length or the measure of their width, (i.e., they are not limited by any set measure, but expand as they develop). With regard to Jerusalem, which has Your name in it, and Your Temple in it, and righteous people in it, will You give it a measure? Immediately: (“And, behold, the angel that spoke with me went forth, and another angel went out to meet him,) and said to him: Run, speak to this young man, saying: Jerusalem shall be inhabited without walls for the multitude of men and cattle\".</p>\n<p>And Rashi explains on the words \"Jerusalem shall be \"פְּרָזוֹת\" - inhabited without walls\" - Just as these \"פְּרָזוֹת - prazos\" that don't have any measure in the building but are like the ones who want to build - so too the same is for Yerushalayim. <strong>Thus the matter is known that these \"פְּרָזוֹת\" are cities without walls and Hashem promises us that Jerusalem in the future will be like these פְּרָזוֹת that don't have any measurements and it is in the greatness of its vast expanse.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n",

With extensive citations of his writings, it will be an entry point to his thought for many American readers. To illuminate R. Zadok's innovative spiritual path, in which one attains mystical experience through intellectual study of Torah, Brill explores the realm of spiritual psychology with particular attention to individual growth, sin, determinism, and pluralism. He shows that R. Zadok's thought combined mystical, Aristotelian, and psychological elements. This work also sheds important light on Lithuanian talmudic intellectualism and Polish Hasidism. It is the first book to present a critical, analytical portrait of hasidic theology. Particular attention is paid to R. Zadok's teacher, Rabbi Mordekhai Leiner of Izbica, whose individualistic philosophy undergirds R. Zadok's teachings on the subject of free will. Finally, this superb study addresses the question of how a Jewish thinker in a traditional milieu was able to derive a theology with many elements we would consider \"modern, \" even though he was largely insulated from and, in theory, opposed to contemporary Western, non-religious thinkers.

However, telescopes which use lenses to focus were invented (at least in Europe) only around 1608. We do not know the name of the inventor, though in October of that year a Dutchman by the name of Hans Lipperhey had submitted a patent for a telescope. Did Rabban Gamliel really use a telescope over 1,500 years prior to this patent?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He writes that modern day translations have analysed it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Koren English Talmud suggests in a note that the tube was “a kind of precise protractor, similar to those used for astronomical measurements, i.e a type of sextant, the early form of which is known as an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrolabe\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">astrolabe</a>.” The ArtScroll Schottenstein Talmud notes that Rabban Gamliel’s tube “operated without lenses, which were not invented until some fourteen centuries later.” It is challenging to figure out what exactly this tube was.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He notes how the mathematician and President of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem Selig Brodetsky (1888-1954) wrote a lengthy essay titled <em><a href=\"https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/B0006E6ZN6\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Astronomy in the Babylonian Talmud</a></em> and notes that he finds it very difficult for Rashi to assert that it is a telescope given the period of the gemara and its relation to the technological advancement of the telescope.</p>\n<p>As such, he moves on to the <a href=\"https://www.sefaria.org/Rambam_on_Mishnah_Eruvin.4.2.1?lang=bi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Rambam</a> who views the instrument as being the astrolabe (like the Koren wanted to suggest).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>שמסתכלין בו החוזים בכוכבים ונקרא בערבי אצטרל\"ב ואיני רוצה להאריך ולהזכיר איך יושג כי זה הדבר בזה הענין ארוך ואפילו באריכות לא יבין זה אלא מי שידע בחכמת התשבורת</p>\n<p>…It was the device used by astronomers and known in Arabic as an “astrolabe.” I do not want to go into lengthy details and describe how it is used, because it is a lengthy process.

There is however an academic dispute over its use, but at the very least it raises the possibility that people were using lenses long before the time of Galileo.</p>\n<p>The author goes on to list various influential figures and their studies that hint to the possibility that the Rabbonim of the Gemara did in fact have access to some crude form of telescope or alternatively, \"telescopes\" served varying purposes throughout the ages.</p>\n<p>Either way, his conclusions are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>To sum, telescopes have served a number of different purposes for both rabbis and lay Jews.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>For Rabban Gamliel it was used as a measuring device, (though it likely wasn't a telescope at all).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_of_Tudela\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Benjamin of Tudela</a> is was a wondrous device to see for a distance of twenty days’ journey (though it was not a telescopes as we know them today, but some kind of mirror).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/rabbi-azariah-figo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Azariah Figo</a> it was a device that taught a religious lesson: just as physical weaknesses may be overcome with human ingenuity, so too might spiritual weaknesses be overcome.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_of_Modena\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Leon of Modena</a> it was a proof of the greatness of Rabban Gamliel, who had used the device centuries before it was used in Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Yagel\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Avraham Yagel</a>, it was was a similar message: the rabbis of the Talmud had previously invented the telescope, long before it began to be used in Europe.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Solomon_Delmedigo\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Joseph Delmedigo</a> it was a scientific device that demonstrated the truth of the Copernican model.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>For the Chofetz Chaim its invention reminded us of God’s providence in the world.

It is derived\nfrom a verse, as it is stated: “He shall not die at the mouth of one\nwitness” (Deuteronomy 17:6). The exposition is as follows: What is the\nmeaning of “one witness”? If we say that it means one witness\nliterally, we learn it from the first portion of the verse: “At the\nmouth of two witnesses,” indicating that the testimony of fewer than\ntwo witnesses is not valid. Rather, what is the meaning of “one\nwitness”? It means that the accused is not executed based on the\ntestimony of people who witnessed an incident with one witness here\nand one witness elsewhere.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>PARA 2</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The Gemara notes: תניא נמי הכי This is also taught in a baraita: It is\nwritten: “He shall not die at the mouth of one witness,” from which it\nis derived to include the halakha that in the case of two witnesses\nwho observe an individual violating a capital transgression, one from\nthis window and one from that window, and they do not see each other,\nthat they do not join to constitute a set of witnesses. Moreover, even\nif they witnessed the same transgression from the same perspective,\nwatching the incident not at the same time but one after the other in\none window, they do not join to constitute a set of witnesses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My question is whether  תניא נמי הכי always comes to support one view of a preceding number of views or (as I thought until now) just to confirm the last statement being made.</p>\n\n\n## Antworten\n\n### Antwort 1 (Score: 2)\n\n<p>As I am to new to place a comment but am able to write an answer, my comment is that N.T. first comment is correct answer to your original question. Toisfois is saying that the Braisoh could support both elements of Rav's statement a) the concept b) the source in the Torah of Rav. But toisfois initially says a) is not required as this can be deduced from the Mishne which is more authentic than a Braisoh and therefore The Braisoh is only required for element b). Toisfois then retracts and says then says that we cannot prove element a) from the Mishne and the Braisoh is required for both a) and b). But N.T. is correct תניא נמי הכי will generally be a support for the last opinion being made</p>\n\n\n",

I can recommend the following for Masechet Berachot, which you mentioned that you were studying.</p>\n<p>On Orach Chaim, where most of the laws in Masechet Berachot can be found there are two very valuable collections of responsa. The first is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayyim_Mordecai_Margolioth\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Sha'arei Teshuvah</a>, which is printed in standard Shulchan Aruch/Mishnah Berurah books. The second is Piskei Teshuvot, which is a separate work. Both collect important responsa related to the topic at hand, and either summarize or reference various responsa. Piskei Teshuvot is more recent, and often brings very recent authorities on modern-day issues, and is extremely thorough. Sha'arei Teshuvah is much shorter, and generally brings responsa from 200-400 years ago, and many times brings those which relate to kabbalah.</p>\n<p>There are other similar works on other areas of halacha (such as pesakim uteshuvot, pitchei teshuvah, etc.). The Bar Ilan responsa project also has a nice selection of responsa related to certain topics, although those are generally from fairly recent authorities as well. Also, many early responsa (such as those of the Rishonim) are brought by other broader halachic works, such as Beit Yosef.
